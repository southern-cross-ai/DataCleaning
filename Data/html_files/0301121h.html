<h1>1</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>The traffic policemen and the two detectives from the homicide
squad examined the tracks of the car and were convinced that a
soft shoulder of the road had given way.</p>

<p>They had been returning from Bison Park, after midnight but
quite sober. Hayden Chart was driving the convertible and hating
his wife, Caprice, and hating himself for hating her. He was not
given to grudges and, despite her glitter of pale-green dinner
dress and her glitter of derisive gossip, Caprice was a simpleton
who no more deserved hatred than did a noisy child. But she did
chatter so. It wore Hayden down like a telephone bell ringing
incessantly in an empty house.</p>

<p>She gabbled, "Jesse Bradbin is so dumb! He's an absolute hick,
and he's about as much of an architect as my left foot. Why
couldn't you get a smarter partner? And <i>is</i> he a lousy
bridge player! Is he ever!"</p>

<p>"He's not bad."</p>

<p>"No, it's his cluck of a wife that really gets me down. In my
candid opinion, Mary Eliza Bradbin is the worst dose of vinegar
in Newlife; the most hypocritical combination of piousness and
secret drinking I ever ran into. And always criticizing some poor
bunny. You pretend like you like everybody, but even you got to
admit Mary Eliza is a pain in the neck. Isn't she, huh? Isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Stupid. But means well," said Hayden Chart.</p>

<p>"She means poison, that's what she means!"</p>

<p>The scolding did not become Caprice, thought Hayden. She was
elfin, tiny and quick and rose and pale gold, given to
affectionate giggles in between her miaows. If she would only
shut up, he sighed, he could go on loving her like a dutiful
husband--perhaps.</p>

<p>He longed for silence. Especially on a moony night like this,
driving on smooth cement with this suave engine, he liked to look
up at the mountains against the moon-pale sky, to look with
satisfaction at the houses he himself had planned in these comely
new suburbs of Newlife, "the fastest-growing city in
Colorado"--Newlife, with its skyscrapers set among flat one-story
supply-houses for silver miners and sheep-ranchers; Newlife and
its symphony orchestra, with a Spanish conductor, playing in a
Renaissance temple where a fiery dance-hall had stood but twenty
years before. Newlife had swollen from 30,000 to 300,000 in
thirty years, and it expected a million in another thirty.</p>

<p>And in Newlife no firm was more enterprising than Chart,
Bradbin &amp; Chart, architects: the heavy-handed Jesse Bradbin,
aged sixty, and the thirty-five-year-old Hayden, who was slim and
compact and patient, and given to playing tennis and reading
biography.</p>

<p>He did not know Caprice. It would always be his fault with
women that his imagination darted into their inner minds, thought
with and through their minds. He took their side even against
himself, and saw to it, thus, that he invariably lost in the war
against women.</p>

<p>He could not even be thunderous with a woman client guilty of
the most sickening of crimes (except for not paying the bill):
wanting what she wanted in a house and not what the architect
knew was good for her. He was both maddened and sympathetic now
when Caprice, exasperated at not having made him pay more
attention to her, started all her little tricks of propaganda,
which mutely shrieked, "Notice me--notice me!"</p>

<p>Holding it visibly high, from her lizard-skin evening bag she
took out her gold-link purse; out of the purse she took a package
in silver paper; out of the silver paper she took the prize she
had just won at bridge: a brooch of imitation jade. Then she
wrapped up the brooch, put the silver paper in her purse, put the
purse in the bag, loudly clicked the bag shut, loudly clicked it
open again, took out the purse, took out the silver paper . .
.</p>

<p>She was capable of doing this over and over until he testified
to her powers of torture by scolding her.</p>

<p>But tonight his anger at her petty bullying was lost in pity
that, at slightly over thirty, she should still have the mind of
a child delighted by any sort of gift. He made himself say to
her, civilly, "That's a nice jade charm. I'm glad you won
it."</p>

<p>Now that she had made him recognize her presence, she returned
to her gabbing, but more spitefully; she did what she gleefully
called "needling him a little."</p>

<p>"But you, big boy, were <i>you</i> ever terrible tonight! You
played worse than Mary Eliza. You got no more card sense than a
zebra. But what amused me, when it didn't get me sore--oh, you
didn't think I noticed; you think you're such a smoothie about
covering up your sniffing around after women--what had me sunk
was the way you kept sneaking in a look at Roxanna's ankles and
Alice's buz-<i>zoom</i> and Jane's god-awful lipstick. You'd be
<i>the</i> most ridiculous tail-waving cat out on the tiles, if
it wasn't that you're such a coward!"</p>

<p>His irritation, sparking into wrath at this injustice, may
have made his hand twitch on the steering wheel, or it may have
been entirely the soft shoulder of the highway caving in.
Whichever, the car was suddenly and appallingly shooting off the
embanked road, and as he protested, "This can't be happening to
me!" they were turning over and over in air.</p>

<p>There was something comic in that grotesque horror. The roof
was below him, then the car upended like a rearing horse, then
his head had struck the roof and afterward the windshield, then
the whirling cosmos banged down, and the side window was below
him, on the earth, then up beside him again, and they were still.
The huge noise dissolved into a huge blank silence, and the car
shook like a panting animal. They were tilted, but nearly
right-side-up.</p>

<p>He thought that his head was bleeding and both his arms broken
and he knew that he was very sick and that Caprice was not there
beside him.</p>

<p>"Where are you? Darling!" he was screaming--he was trying to
scream, while he realized that his voice was choked. He thought
he could hear a small shaky answer from her, but he was so dazed
that he could not be sure whether it was a moan or a sneer. With
agony he managed to turn his head enough to make out their
situation. With a freakishness like that of a tornado, Caprice
seemed to have been thrown into the shallow back seat, and the
light fabric top of the convertible had been so deeply dented
that she was imprisoned there, with only an aperture between the
two seats large enough for him to hear her sobbing; not large
enough for either of them to pass. In any case, he could not move
far. He was jammed between the seat and the twisted steering
post. The glass had been ripped clear out of the windshield; it
seemed to have slashed his scalp.</p>

<p>"Caprice!"</p>

<p>"Ohhhhhh . . ."</p>

<p>"Can you move? Can you reach me?"</p>

<p>"Ohhhhhh . . ."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt badly?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. . . . Oh, yes, my neck--hurts dreadfully."</p>

<p>More than the pain which beat in a steady rhythm of agony in
an arc that traversed his head, he felt anxiety for her--with her
poor, pretty jade charm. For perhaps the first time this past
year or so, he felt not just a resigned endurance of her malice,
but an active affection, a desire to sacrifice himself to help
her.</p>

<p>He was trying to shout for help, expecting to be rescued, to
have aid at once. But his voice was a parched trickle, weak as
that of an ailing baby. He struggled to raise his head from the
cool upholstery against which his cheek rested, and look through
the empty windshield frame. He perceived, in a dull, sick way,
that they were in a brush-thick hollow far down below the level
of the highway, hidden from it. Even were it not night, they
would not be seen, be heard, from any of the rushing automobiles
whose lights, innumerable and swift, level comet-tracks, were
darting above them, with the steady swish of tires on cement.</p>

<p>Caprice and he might lie here, bleeding, stranglingly thirsty,
for many nights and days.</p>

<p>He could hear Caprice's voice, in a tiny angry scolding:</p>

<p>"Inexcusable carelessness, and you always claim to be such a
good driver and then practically killing me!"</p>

<p>He agreed with her. He did love her so much! If he had of late
thought himself indifferent to her, it had been only the
self-absorbed busyness of a craftsman, he told himself.</p>

<p>He was not sure just how conscious she was, back there, as she
prattled away more and more spitefully:</p>

<p>"Why don't you <i>do</i> something? Get out and get some help,
not sit there and wait for somebody to find us! Always so
helpless and never, never think about what I may want or need or
anything!"</p>

<p>A snigger then of dainty malice, the cat sniggering as it
patted the dying mouse:</p>

<p>"Oh, not you! Always so high-and-mighty and cultured, telling
everybody about these big thick history books you're always
reading, and you never really finish any of 'em! Ridiculous
spectacle of yourself, and everybody laughing at you. Pretending
you're so hot and bothered about classical music and oh yes, of
course, just have to have it on the radio when you're reading,
and never hear one note! Oh, I've proved it! I've switched it to
jazz and you never even noticed. Not mind your being so phony if
you weren't so clumsy about it and everybody gets onto you--what
a goat!"</p>

<p>In his mind he pleaded with her, "Don't, oh, please don't, not
now when I've turned back to you. Let me go on loving you!"</p>

<p>His head seemed to have stopped bleeding but it was all a
thick mass of aching, his throat was dry as a desert water-hole,
and he could not make out a word now as she cackled on, delirious
and incomprehensible. He was losing account of time. Had he
passed out, had he been unconscious?</p>

<p>They could both die here before they were found. Was this the
end of everything?</p>

<p>"Is this all I'm going to get from life? I've done so little
and seen so little out of all I wanted. In college, that Kipling
thing, 'For to admire and for to see, I've wandered o'er the
world so wide.' I was going to see everything, everywhere."</p>

<p>He made a monstrous list of the things he had wanted, now that
it was, no doubt, too late ever to do them. To be state tennis
champion. To camp in British Columbia and have a winter in the
Caribbean. To speak French and live in Paris and know wines and
meet dashing actresses and wise old men with spade beards. To
live for months overlooking a monastery garden, mystic and
contemplative.</p>

<p>(It would have to be an Episcopal monastery, though, wouldn't
it? His great-great-grandfather had been Church of England Bishop
of North Carolina.)</p>

<p>And--a familiar dream which he had illustrated with drawings
on stray envelopes--now he would never build that prairie village
which was to have been all housed in one skyscraper: the first
solution in history of rural isolation and loneliness. He could
have done it, too! He was amazed that these hands, this aching
brain, so hotly alive now, might at a moment crumble in
dissolution.</p>

<p>Too late? But if he did get free from this prison, he would
renounce his routine provincial life and follow every one of his
fantasies.</p>

<p>Surely Caprice would come with him--<i>perhaps</i> she would.
There were no children to consider, even after their eight years
of marriage, nor did Caprice really want any. At thirty-five,
with enough money earned by himself or inherited from his father,
who had founded their architectural firm, he was freer than at
eighteen.</p>

<p>With his even tan, his small mustache, his erect slenderness,
Hayden Chart might have been a Scotch major or a Yorkshire man.
His face was thin, and people said that his eyes were kind. In a
business world where so many hustlers like Jesse Bradbin were
inclined to be damply enthusiastic and clammy to the handshake,
there was a fine, dry, hard quality about Hayden, the quality of
a polished dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger had been too long sheathed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Caprice was still muttering on, scarcely heard, with a sound
like dry leaves shifting in an autumn breeze. His pity for her
grew more passionate. She was so youthful, at thirty-one; she had
so loved this new automobile and everything in their new Georgian
brick house, from the deep-freeze and the red-and-black tiled
rumpus-room to her dressing room, all crystal and frilly
curtains. With a heartier, blunter, more alcoholic husband, she
would have exulted in a life of dancing and risky gambling. He
had always hurt her, Hayden sighed, and he hadn't meant to, he
never had meant to.</p>

<p>He was keeping up, this while, an effort to shout which
mangled his throat yet seemed no louder than a moan. But he may
have been heard.</p>

<p>Near them, a match was lighted and held up, revealing the
twisted hood of the car and a scared, bearded, rustic face
peering in through the windshield frame. Hayden managed a gasp of
"Get help!" The match went out, and his battered consciousness
went out with it.</p>

<p>In a shaky dream he saw or thought he saw the car flooded with
light from a wrecker, felt himself being eased out from behind
the steering wheel and lifted from the car, and swift surgical
fingers about his scalp and his arms. His mind faded again,
complete, and he never knew whether he had seen or merely thought
he had seen the broken, still body of Caprice. For years he
seemed to have been protesting, "Such a pretty toy and so frail;
they shouldn't have hurt her."</p>

<p>He came clearly to in a hospital, with his head bandaged and
Dr. Crittenham, their mild indecisive family physician, by the
bed. He felt miraculously safe, and not for two days did he know
that Caprice had been buried the day before, and that he was
desolatingly free to wander in a world too bleakly, too
intimidatingly wide.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>2</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He could feel the strength flowing back into him, like a slow
and steady sea tide, and that flowing life, that mysterious busy
workmanship of nature, was repairing his broken arms, his
contused skull, though it could not yet repair the bruised mind
in which, incessantly, he agonized that he had killed his
helpless child, Caprice, and with her killed the right to
love.</p>

<p>He feebly wanted to get out of this, away from clucking nurses
and Dr. Crittenham's owlish peering and the horrible scrambled
eggs and cold toast. He wanted to be working, to be taken
seriously again as part of the cheerful world that goes daily to
its work. But, hazily forming, more and more resentful, was a
realization that for a long while yet he could not endure fussy
clients: well-to-do women demanding tiled baths, an assembly-line
kitchen, a forty-by-thirty living room and innumerable cedar
closets, for the price of a four-room bungalow.</p>

<p>As indignant as though he were still in his office arguing
with them, he remembered the mean and cheating determination not
to be cheated which was characteristic of women who had never
been in business: those tight lips, that smell of rotten
carnations, that snarling, "Well, I must <i>say,</i> I thought a'
architect was supposed to look after folks' interests, not try
and rob them!"</p>

<p>He recalled whole families of clients: Father standing back,
looking anxious, hoping that The Wife wouldn't run him into too
much money. Father himself would be satisfied with anything from
a domestic tomb made of cement blocks to a Samoan grass hut,
provided they got a good heating plant, but Sistie kept repeating
that they must have a place to dance, and Junior had incessant
new ideas: a closet for skis, a bowling alley, a swimming pool
and, while they were about it, why not a four-car garage instead
of a two-car shanty?</p>

<p>"I can't take it! What they all demand! Now I know how the
doctor feels when I complain about the diet here, and the
injections!"</p>

<p>Nor could he take the demands of the unions, nor the
shiftiness of tough contractors, nor the delays in bank loans
nor, least of all, the violently active idleness of his older
partner.</p>

<p>Jesse objected to the wages of the draftsmen, to time spent on
twice-daily inspections of operations; he tried to wiggle into
every new building job in town; and he repeated everything he
said to you, repeated it with emphasis, as though--even when he
had nothing weightier to communicate than the chance of rain
today--he were revealing a message from Heaven.</p>

<p>Between the two sections of his thundering verbal trains,
Jesse always put in a "See whatta mean?" He ruled, "Dead certain
to be a cold fall, this fall, see whatta mean? Dead
certain--whatta mean--a cold fall!"</p>

<p>Life could have been tremulous with noble emotions and
cultivated senses--or so the poets informed him, Hayden
sighed--and was he to spend its swift flicker in listening to an
old miser bellowing, "See whatta mean"? Whenever Hayden had a
notion for a warehouse that should be something more than a
prison, Jesse protested, "You long-haired artists give me a pain.
I'm a practical man!"</p>

<p>It was painful that while Jesse regarded him as an anarchist,
the local Modernist and Functionalist and general Impossiblist,
Mr. Kivi from Finland--<i>Doctor</i> Kivi--considered Hayden "a
nize fella personal, but yoost anudder old-fashion architectural
tailor, giffing the dumb bourgeois whateffer kind suitings dey
tink dey vant."</p>

<p>"I need, in fact, a year off," reflected Hayden, "and I'm
going to take that year off, and find out whether I can do
anything more amusing than being batted over the net by Jesse and
batted back by Kivi. I think that I would like to be a
self-respecting human being, and even learn to read!"</p>

<p>He could amply afford the year off. As a young architect he
had, on speculation, planned a large Merchandise Mart, and his
share in that alone would give him a rather tight living. He
renewed now his regret, in the prison of the wrecked car, that he
had missed so many treasures of learning. Compared with Jesse
Bradbin, he was an encyclopedia but, lying in bed, annoyed when
the day nurse tried to entertain him with what she thought she
remembered of a radio skit, he made lists of the things he did
not know.</p>

<p>He knew nothing, very nearly, of Byzantine or Egyptian,
Chinese or Hindu architecture. He spoke no foreign
language--should not an educated man be able to speak French and
German, along with Italian or Spanish? He had only a mail-order
smattering of music, painting; he had never read Dante or Goethe
nor anything of Shakespeare except the plays on which he had been
spoon-fed at Amherst; he was innocent of chemistry and astronomy;
and of history before 1776 he was certain only that there had
been Gothic and Renaissance churches and that America had been
discovered, from time to time, by a lot of Scandinavians and by a
gentleman called Christopher Columbus, who had trained for it by
continually standing eggs on end.</p>

<p>He had assumed that he would be classed as a Civilized Man. He
wondered now if he was not a jungle-dwelling cannibal without
even an expert knowledge of how to catch and cook prime human
beings. How proud he had been that--to Caprice's rage--on many
evenings, instead of highball parties, he had gone to bed at
nine-thirty and "got ten good hours of sleep." Now he speculated
that he had probably been wasting three hours a day of this
too-brief life in snoozing like a hobo by the railroad
tracks.</p>

<p>Could he make up for all that?</p>

<p>As a starter, he longed for first-hand sight of the Europe
which is the mother of most Americans as it is of the
Mongolian-Chaldaic-Saracen-Slav races who call themselves
European. His nearest step to it had been a wander-month in
England with a couple of classmates after their graduation from
Amherst. The glory of the English cathedrals had decided him to
be an architect, like his father. Before he could go on to the
Continent, he had been called home by the illness of his mother.
He had gone to a New York school of architecture, and that was
the end of Romany Rye.</p>

<p>In World War II, he had been a major, but he had been kept in
the United States, constructing miles of huts and warehouses.
Before it, he had sat in on the designing of banks, office
buildings, churches, but he had become a specialist in
"medium-priced housing," along with an occasional
Labrador-Spanish palace for a stockman, or this very hospital
that was his detention camp.</p>

<p>He loved Litchfield, Sharon, Williamsburg; he preferred the
Georgian, and he had theories about developing a truly American
style. He was called a plodder by all the Kivis, and in turn he
disliked their bleak blocks of Modernist cement, their
glass-fronted hen-houses, their architectural spiders with
cantilever claws.</p>

<p>Yet now he wanted to desert his solid American brick and
timber and flee to the stone and thatch of the heathen gods of
Europe.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>With all his dismaying thoughts, he excitedly worked out a
philosophy of hope which he called the Doctrine of Recovered
Youth.</p>

<p>He meditated upon it through the motionless hours when he
awoke at three in the morning and could not sleep again till
after breakfast. He heard the small derisive night noises: a
policeman plodding down the street, a drunk singing, a wild
ambulance screaming, a woman crying, then the banging of the ash
cans. He looked for hours at the plaster walls and wished that
instead of making this hospital crisp and hygienic, he had
created an orgy of Alhambra harem decoration, to entertain
sleepless patients suffering through the gray hours. Over and
over he sighed about the lost wisdoms he had missed, till from
nowhere, sharp, exhilarating, came the faith that he had not
missed them, that they could be ahead of him.</p>

<p><i>The Doctrine of Recovered Youth.</i> He was to spend no
time in regretting failures but to concentrate on what he could
do in a future that was ready to his hand.</p>

<p>He was not to think back fifteen years to the time when he was
twenty, credulous and enthusiastic, when he was strong for
walking, for singing, for making love. He was to look fifteen
years ahead to the time when he would be fifty--and a fine,
sound, competent age that was, too, when he ought to be able to
eat and laugh and make love as well as ever. Compared with fifty,
he still <i>was</i> young, he <i>had</i> recovered youth. Ah, the
blazing wonders he was going to experience in these fifteen years
ahead, with perhaps another twenty-five years on top of that! He
was going to see all of the world so wide.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>His acquaintances were presently allowed to call on him, and
the strange thing, in his fast-recovering strength, was that he
did not want to see many of them. He was impatient with the
tedious past which these fellow-clansmen so tenderly dragged in,
certain that he would be delighted to hear how everything had
been going with Dear Old Bill Smith, the celebrated fisherman and
drunk, delighted to get all the shivery details of the membership
drive of the Bison Park Country Club.</p>

<p>It had been assumed, he himself had half assumed, that he was
gregarious, fond of being yelled at by a dozen people in a small
room, for this was expected of any competent professional man in
Newlife. He discovered in this, his first pious retreat since
college, that it had been an enforced habit, and that he
preferred the sweetness of silence to even the newest smutty
story.</p>

<p>But such treachery to American good-fellowship he kept
concealed. He tried to be grateful to all the kind men who, at
such inconvenience, during busy days, took off an hour to "run in
and cheer up good ole Hay," by bellowing at him, "Well, well,
well, well, you certainly look fine today, you certainly do, you
look well on the way to recovery, so take good care yourself, be
sure and take care yourself now, and let me know anything I can
do for you."</p>

<p>They would have been shocked, Civic Virtue in Newlife would
have rocked, if he had said, "There is one thing you can do: go
away and don't come back."</p>

<p>The agonizing crisis of these visitations was when they
stopped mid-sentence and he knew that, with obscene tact, they
were avoiding even a natural mention of the dead Caprice, or
when, instead, they dragged in her poor remains and overpraised
her. He told himself that the profoundest reason why he wished
they would forget Caprice was that he was in love with his
purified memory of her. All round her shrine was a cloister where
no heathen were allowed to tread.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He felt wan and reedy as he sat up in bed in his coarse
hospital nightgown, while Jesse Bradbin, tilting back and forth,
back and forth, in a straight chair, looked like a fly-blown leg
of beef. Jesse held out his whisky flask with a roar of, "Try a
nip of this--Mother's Knee Bourbon. Your doc would throw a fit,
but it's time for you to get back in harness again, see whatta
mean, get back in shape and have a little fun, see whatta
mean?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, no. Uh--Jesse, I may take some time off when I'm out
of the hospital."</p>

<p>"What d' you think you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I might skip out to California--try loafing in the sun, maybe
catch up on my reading."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose a month of that wouldn't hurt you, though
it'll be blame inconvenient."</p>

<p>"Not a month. Maybe I'll take a year off."</p>

<p>"A--a <i>year?</i> Great good suffering catfish! That accident
knocked all the whatever sense you've got clean out of your head,
see whatta mean, knocked out all what sense you got! You're crazy
as a loon! A <i>year</i>? With a bunch of new contracts in
sight?"</p>

<p>"I'll find you a good substitute."</p>

<p>"If you went and found me a Cass Gilbert--at thirty bucks a
week--I'd still be dodging my duty toward you, as a partner, as
an intimate friend, as a fellow-Coloradan, see whatta
mean--dodging my duty. I got a moral responsibility toward you,
now that Caprice has passed on. Got to be somebody to take care
of you and get you straightened out and direct you and try to put
some common sense and dependability into that damn-fool poetical
brain of yours. No, sir-ee! The way to forget that poor girl and
your own shaking up is to hustle and get back on the job and work
harder than ever. You'll be surprised how you'll enjoy it,
getting away from all this unhealthy <i>thinking!</i> Back into
the fray! You'll enjoy it, see whatta mean--enjoy it. You always
did like chatting and chinning and visiting with the lady
clients, you old rogue! Heh, heh?"</p>

<p>"Got to have some sleep now," muttered Hayden wearily.</p>

<p>But that missionary of manly enterprise, Mr. Bradbin, had not
been entirely without moral effect. Hayden reflected, "To go back
to the office now would be the most horrible punishment I can
think of, and perhaps that's why I must do it. I must endure a
heavy penance to make up, in some tiny degree, for killing
Caprice. Oh, she only wanted to dance in the sun! I murdered her,
and her revenge is that I have never been so bound to her as
now.</p>

<p>"I shall not look at another woman, all my life. I shall never
be that romantic wanderer, that troubadour in a ribbon-tied jeep
singing through Provence, that I dreamed of. Suffering has made
me prosaic. I may just as well go back to the office and sell
everybody on attic-insulation. I'm finished. If I were only
twenty again, and strong and unafraid . . ."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The day nurse, who considered Mr. Hayden Chart an edifying but
somewhat depressing model of dignity who "will never give any
skirt a tumble since his wife had passed away," was surprised by
the vigor with which he demanded, "Show her right in!" when she
announced Miss Roxanna Eldritch.</p>

<p>Roxanna Eldritch--Roxy--had been a friend of Caprice, as fond
as she of gin-rummy and skiing and aquaplaning, but three or four
years younger and altogether a more solid and good-tempered
citizeness. She was a reporter on the Newlife <i>Evening
Telescope,</i> and she wrote not only of Society and its fabulous
orange-flavored weddings (or Nuptials, if the groom made over ten
thousand a year) but capably handled general assignments:
interviews with lecturers and with remarkably intelligent horses,
hardware-association dinners, and even such big news as an
alderman's explanation of how he had just happened to pick up on
the street the marked bills found in his desk.</p>

<p>Roxy came in like a shy mouse, but a mouse that will
immediately start waltzing if the cat is asleep. She was a
smallish, blue-eyed redhead, with the richest deep-copper hair,
and the fair skin and jaunty freckles of the redhead. She was not
plump, and her ankles were fine-drawn, but she was rounded and
appetizing. Even old friends of her father, an unimportant
beet-sugar broker, though they feared that Roxy would laugh at
them, found it hard to keep their hands off her.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in white flannel at ten in the morning, she looked
twenty-two and ready for tennis; sometimes, late in the evening,
she looked an old, old, haggard twenty-nine, a veteran who has
met too many public men and heard them boasting, for the benefit
of Press &amp; Public, of how many extraordinary things they were
going to do as soon as this astonishing grand-jury indictment was
quashed.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway, glancing sharply at Hayden as he
yanked a red-and-yellow Navajo blanket about his shoulders and
smoothed his hair.</p>

<p>"My gracious, you look like a lily!" said Roxy. "How's
everything in Astolat? Elaine back from Camelot yet? But
honestly, Hay, you're in wonderful shape. I am so glad!"</p>

<p>Her voice was warm and kind, though it did have a bit of
western flatness, the voice of a bird flying at dun twilight over
the western plains.</p>

<p>"I'm getting all right, Roxy. Nice you came."</p>

<p>"Sit down a minute? Really came to ask you whether you'd like
cigarettes or candy or detective stories. I'm sure you've had too
many flowers."</p>

<p>"Enough so that they rather horribly suggested a funeral. The
steamfitters' union sent me about half a mile of forget-me-nots.
I thought that was rather sinister."</p>

<p>"When do you think you'll be ready for some tennis, Hay? I'm
your man. You'll have to be careful, and of course I gambol
around the court like a furniture truck, but you're so much
neater than I am that you'll still lick me every set."</p>

<p>He had been thinking that she was very like Caprice, that
essentially she <i>was</i> Caprice, was every dance-mad,
cocktail-gulping young female in Newlife, but he reflected that,
no, Roxanna had more humor, sympathy, industry than the Caprices.
But he was jarred to find, in the zest with which he looked at
Roxy's luscious throat and breast, that he had fallen with
ludicrous haste from his mystic worship of Caprice's wistful and
shadowy image.</p>

<p>Roxanna could not have noticed any ruefulness in him. She was
too excited about making her announcement:</p>

<p>"I just wanted to say, if we do get in any tennis, it will
have to be quick, because as soon as I get my passport and learn
how to say 'Where's the depot?' in English English, I'm going to
Europe. By myself!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"My managing editor--next year there'll be a lot of pilgrims
from here going to Rome and so on for the Holy Year, and he
allowed it might be a good idea to get the lowdown on what makes
there now, all over Europe. I'm to do a series for the
<i>Telescope</i> and outlying sheets on how you eat and sleep and
<i>per combien</i> on good American dollars--or is it <i>par
combien?</i>--in the Old Country. Oh, Hay, I try to be flippant
about it, but I'm awed to death and scared to death! Think, pal,
I'll be seeing English rose gardens and the midnight sun in
Sweden and Paris caf&eacute;s and the Colosseum!"</p>

<p>It was at that moment that, without knowing it, Hayden started
for Europe.</p>

<p>There were hesitations, worries, preparations to be got
through. Dr. and Mrs. Windelbank called on him. He was a dentist
with a taste for attending lectures, about which he discoursed to
patients when he had them racked in the chair with cotton rolls
in their mouths, and his lady gave talks on gardening. They came
in now to boast that they too were going to Europe, and not on
one of your ridiculous three-week tours. No, they would fly
across and have an entire month just for sightseeing, with two
entire days in Venice, two in Florence, and three in Rome!</p>

<p>For years the Windelbanks had gloried in their annual
adventures: their journeys to Mexico, to Alaska, and the Famous
Homes of New England, including Coolidge's, and they implied that
Hayden was a stick-in-the-mud, without imagination.</p>

<p>Clearly, he had to go and spend a couple of months abroad in
revenge upon these loving neighbors. Yet even this natural human
spite may have moved him less than the superiority of Dr.
Kivi.</p>

<p>That priest of Modernism in Architecture came in as
condescendingly as a duke or a headwaiter, and when Hayden
fretted. "Do you think I would get much out of seeing Europe as
it is now, Maestro?" the Finnish orchid seemed amused.</p>

<p>He was made up to look the great artist, with bushy hair,
bushy mustache, black bow tie with bushy canary-colored
waistcoat--a squat man, full of salt herring and energy. He hated
his titanic rivals, Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright and Neutra and
Saarinen and Van der Rohe; he said "efen a gang of carpenters
like Chart-Bradbin are better dan dose swindlers dat mess on de
sacred name off Modarnism." He looked at Hayden not with loathing
but with such fondness as one might give to a silky Pekingese--if
it stayed out of your armchair. He said blandly, "Vy not go? Even
an American bourgeois can look on naked beauty vidout much
injury, as my friend Sibelius iss often saying to me. But as you
don't know de t'ree t'ousand years of history, as you neffer had
a <i>Kinderstube,</i> don't expect too much or you vill be ferry
lonely and disappointet."</p>

<p>Afterwards, Hayden grumbled to himself. He recalled rumors
that Dr. Kivi had no bracing Finnish blood in him at all, but was
actually a German named Hans Schmuck. But to Hayden he was
formidable. He had seen Kivi beat the local chess champion who,
being named Perkins, could not conceivably rival a master who
smelled of beer and gherkins. In Denver, Hayden had heard Kivi
publicly affirm his faith:</p>

<p>"I am not going to let my clients haf all the pingpong tables
and leetle antique furniture they vant, efen if I go broke and
take to honest farming." That Augustinian creed had set all the
Rocky Mountain architects debating, and enabled Kivi to charge an
extra thousand dollars on every house.</p>

<p>But Kivi's discouragement built up in Hayden a stubborn
Western-Yankee resentment. Probably, he admitted, he was nearer
to the capering Kivi than to the mulish Jess Bradbin. He vowed,
"All right, I <i>will</i> go abroad! I'll learn at least one
language, and I'll bring back more of the genius of Rome than
this bounding baboon Kivi could ever understand!"</p>

<p>The news enlivened Newlife that Hayden Chart was going abroad.
Himself, he was not yet quite sure, and he did not remember
having told any one definitely, but in that ardent community, so
proud of having transcended the village and become urban and
urbane, every one knew your affairs better than you did. His
neighbors came to the hospital to give him advice based on
affection and a superb ignorance of both Europe and Hayden. In
World War II, some hundreds of local young people had campaigned
in Italy and France, and the general city belief was now, and for
another ten years probably would be, that all through Europe
"conditions" were exactly what they had been in a bombed city in
1944.</p>

<p>"Be sure and take along plenty of soap," they urged him, "and
toothbrushes and sugar and toilet paper and aspirin and razor
blades, and you better carry plenty of food. I'd advise your
taking some nice boxes of crackers and a few cans of pork and
beans. And <i>hundreds</i> of rolls of film for your camera."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to take a camera--if I decide to go at all,"
said Hayden.</p>

<p>"You're--not--going--to take a--<i>camera?"</i> they howled.
"Then what are you going to Europe for?"</p>

<p>"Post-card photographs would be better than anything I could
take."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Hay, I shudder to think what's going to happen to
a poor innocent like you among them pirates! I never been in
Europe--<i>personally</i>--but I been reading where right in
Paris you got to bring your own bed sheets, even in the best
hotels!"</p>

<p>Often in any country of Europe, months later, when he stood
admiring show windows that were positively a Versailles of soap
and toothbrushes and inconceivable millions of razor blades, he
sighed to think how unknown this frontier wilderness called
Europe was to that ancient home of decorum and conservatism,
America, so hoary with outdated wisdom that it could not
appreciate the venturesome young barbarians of Rome and
London.</p>

<p>Many among these valued neighborhood counselors begged him not
to go at all. "Or if for some fool reason you feel you simply got
to, don't go making a fool of yourself blundering around alone,"
they implored. "Join some nice conducted tourist party of twenty
or thirty, and they'll tell you what to see and just when to see
it, and what hotels to stay at, and you'll always have some folks
from home to visit with, wherever you are, and not go crazy with
loneliness, or have to depend on natives with their queer
ideas!"</p>

<p>The chief among his guardians was Jesse Bradbin.</p>

<p>"I guess the Old Country was all right in its day, but now we
got the world by the tail; we got the bulge on Europe not only in
banking and university work and the soft-drink business, but in
architecture and even in music and story-writing and all that
guff. A European guy that wants to make good in any high-class
artistic racket today has got to come to America--hat in hand.
But then, you and I are alike. We don't fall for the arty pose.
We know that it's just another way of making a living and cashing
in big--like the chain-grocery game. No, no. Come to your senses
and have a nice sensible rest, playing golf in Florida for maybe
couple weeks, and get back to work. Then you'll thank me for
having steered you away from your schoolboy notions about going
off half-cocked to the Old Country. Yes-sir-ee! You'll thank me
big!"</p>

<p>Hayden lay fuming that Bradbin, after knowing him for
thirty-five years--ever since his first day in this surprising
and slightly unsatisfactory world--should not know him at all,
and yet should often dare to explain him to others. He reflected
that he was like Bradbin in being industrious and in always
paying his bills on the second of the month, but that otherwise
he was less like Bradbin than like the clammiest, dirty-haired
Left Bank female pseudo-painter whose only completed designs,
year after year, were patterns of wet rings on smoke-dizzy
caf&eacute; tables.</p>

<p>He sighed, "And I wonder if Caprice knew me any better? Or
anybody else in this town, except maybe Roxy Eldritch? The rest
of them think I'm a steady, contented, home-loving man of
business. And I'm a tramp that only wants to see new towns and
learn to read Plato in the Greek. Or I think I am!</p>

<p>"Do I know myself any better than they do? I must voyage away
from everybody who is familiar with the shape of my nose and the
contents of my checkbook, find a world where I've never seen a
soul, and so find some one who knows what I'm really like--and
who will tell <i>me,</i> because I'd be interested to learn!</p>

<p>"What I want is less to voyage in any geographical land than
travel in my own self. I may be shocked by what I find there.
Maybe I'm not the master of my fate and the captain of my soul.
Maybe the real captain is a foul-minded sadist and I'm his scared
cabin boy. All right! That'll be no worse than being the safe and
busy Young Mr. Chart, whom you can always count on for a
subscription!"</p>

<p>He was, then, planning to take abroad with him something even
more important than his folding slippers or a dependable can of
pork and beans. In accordance with his own Doctrine of Recovered
Youth, he was going to take a defiant young man who was willing
to burn his own house, destroy his own city, so that he might in
fiery freedom see all of this world so wide.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In college days, the art of reading had given to Hayden
prospects of a richer universe but, like most of his classmates
thirteen years later, he was sometimes inclined to consider books
a genteel way of getting through the desert hours between
dictating business letters and playing bridge. But he had not
quite lost them; he had followed the novels of Hemingway and
Steinbeck and Willa Cather, he had read at history, mostly the
history of America since 1776, according to Van Doren, De Voto,
Durant, Holbrook--scholars who believed that the purpose of
scholarship is to nourish human beings, not professors of
pedagogy.</p>

<p>Jesse Bradbin read only an architectural magazine which dealt
pontifically with Costs and Accounting and in the newspapers read
the murder trials and the national weather reports. Jesse could,
and firmly did, tell you what the temperature was yesterday in
Abilene, Texas, Butte, Montana, and Trenton, New Jersey, and the
comparative snowfall in Devil's Lake, North Dakota, on this same
date in 1944, 1934, 1924 and 1870. Caprice had read only the
society page, the fashion notes, and those same murder trials.
Both of them regarded Hayden as a Francis Bacon, and he had been
tempted to that thought himself till now when, in growing horror,
he decided that he was an unlettered hillbilly.</p>

<p>"We'll repair some of that, as soon as we make the voyage and
look into who this zero, Chart, really is and whether, with his
miraculous new youth, he is worth saving!"</p>

<p>He leapt into an orgy of books, most of them obligingly
fetched to him by his friend, the city librarian: Walter Pater,
Jacob Burckhardt, Thompson and Johnson's epic <i>Introduction to
Medieval Europe,</i> and the good red guidebooks of the good gray
master, Herr Baedeker. Europe came to him not as a heap of
abraded stones stenciled with dates, but as a dome filled with
the softest chanting, broken by the shout of young warriors.</p>

<p>Before he left the hospital for good, he was able to take a
few drives. He avoided even a sight of his own house, but he was
in the gang which saw Roxanna Eldritch off for New York and
Europe: Miss Roxanna in a flying, mouse-gray cloak, holding a
bunch of red roses, herself a red rose, a flushed and rosy
American missionary to the gloom of Europe. She waved to them and
then her face puckered and she was crying--not the dashing lady
journalist, but an affectionate child.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>His dreaming in the hospital seemed to him the only reality,
and reality an uncomfortable dream, when he unlocked his wide
white front door and walked into the hallway with its pictorial
wallpaper of beaux and ladies in victorias. He stared at the
living room: the chintz chairs, the tall white fireplace, the
ruby and emerald and apricot of liqueur bottles pyramided behind
his mahogany bar.</p>

<p>He looked at their bedroom: the chaise longue, the tapestry
wallpaper, the black and silver desk. Though he had designed it
all himself, it seemed to him a dream of luxury fabulous and
wasteful and a little vulgar.</p>

<p>The whole house was a dead thing now that it was deserted by
Caprice's yelling and flouncing and running up- and downstairs
and telephoning violently and for hours. A dream and a languid,
draining dream then was his hasty giving-away of Caprice's
clothes and her poor treasures: the silver-gilt vanity case, the
onyx desk-set, her stout little ski boots, the flimsy bathing
suits that she had loved. It was a dream of a life in which he
had been busy and important and well-bedded and well-fed and had
glowingly possessed everything except friends and contentment and
any reason for living: a dream, a fable, a caricature of
grandeur.</p>

<p>He first awoke from dreaming when he found himself telephoning
to a travel agency about sailings for England, and awoke again
when he stood on the promenade deck of the steamer, in October,
looking wonderingly down at the horde of two classmates who were
seeing him off. He tried to remember where he was going and just
why he was going there.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>4</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He stared at the gangplank, that awning-covered bridge between
the vast black wall of the ship and the surly black wall of the
deckhouse. There was time; he could still go back and be a
sensible architect, and not go off to a hostile camp where he
knew no language, where he had no friends, no way of earning a
living.</p>

<p>He watched the gangplank with apprehension. He saw the pier
crew at the ropes, and he did not stir. And now the plank was
drawn in, and his link to land, to America, to Newlife, to Hayden
Chart of Chart, Bradbin &amp; Chart, was cut, and he was in for
it--an exile. And he did not feel that he had recovered youth at
all. He was a tired man; too tired, surely, to make a new life or
do anything but regret the old life that he had known as safe and
profitable.</p>

<p>He had seen no one whom he knew coming aboard. The intolerably
long lines of the deck planks belonged to a prison corridor. He
drifted to his stateroom, but for all its pertness of cretonne
bedcover and varnished wardrobe and a mechanical bunch of
flowers, it was no place to live in; just big enough to contain
him impatiently until it flung him out again, six days from
now.</p>

<p>Already he knew what every exile before Dante or since has had
to learn: that in the whole world only a few neighborly streets
are interested in letting you live, and if you challenge
strangers, "But I have the high purpose of exploring and
conquering and colonizing my soul," they yawn, "Oh, yes? But why
do it here?"</p>

<p>So this was the joyous venture into the unknown that the
novelists loved to talk about!</p>

<p>At the head steward's window he asked for a table by himself
in the dining salon. There, he dabbled at cavalcades of hors
d'oeuvres and duck reeking with orange sauce, and went up to the
Corinthian Smoking Room and was just as solitary and unspeaking
as he had been below. It seemed to him that his fellow passengers
were all a vast nonsense, and he could not see why any of them
should go abroad.</p>

<p>Except for his hospital sentence, it was the first time in
years when he had been alone, day after day, and for four days he
felt abused and more misunderstood than ever. He suddenly found
that he was enjoying it; that he had resented being alone here on
shipboard only because for years all his acquaintances had
believed that a man was not successful or even decent unless six
people an hour were exulting, "Fine day, isn't!" and sixteen were
telephoning, "Well, we got a fine day all right! May I bother you
for a couple minutes?"</p>

<p>It was a luxury more difficult than a great wine vintage to
appreciate, to be able, hour by hour, to sit still and not try to
sell himself and his charms to anybody--not even to himself. He
decided, "I'll get something out of this trip even if I never see
a cathedral but learn to sit still in a caf&eacute; and not feel
guilty at not jumping up and rushing around to save America."</p>

<p>The life that had been flowing back into him became a full,
sun-warmed tide; he became so sure of himself and his ability to
do anything he wanted that he did not have to do anything to
prove it. He spent hours walking the deck, contented with the
companionship of beckoning waves and, as they approached land, of
the gulls that were less birds than flashes of light.</p>

<p>He discovered that a ship is always the center of the enormous
round of sea, the center and purpose of the universe, man's
justification of his skinny insignificance, and he landed at
Southampton and climbed up into a compartment of the boat train
with the holy peace of the hermit upon him.</p>

<p>He did most of the proper tourist things in London.</p>

<p>He ate roast beef and saw the guard-mounting at Buckingham
Palace and viewed the crown jewels in the Tower--he agreed that
they really did sparkle more importantly than even a windowful of
costume jewelry in a five-and-ten-cent store. He drank bitter
beer and admired all the tombs of all the kings in the Abbey. He
liked the rows of houses, frowning and supercilious but somberly
enduring, indifferent to publicity and the stare of
strangers.</p>

<p>He supposed that he ought to be lively here where, any moment
on any street, he might encounter Mr. Pickwick or David
Copperfield or Sherlock Holmes or Sir John Falstaff or even
Winston Churchill, those triumphs of the imagination, more
fabulous than Lord Beaverbrook yet more real. But incessantly he
remembered how, with his classmates thirteen years ago, he had
experimented with these same omnibuses, listened to Cockneys in
these same Whitechapel pubs, coursed through Hampstead Heath half
the night, singing; and in contrast his solitude made him
melancholy. Was it not sacrilegious for an old tragedian of
thirty-five to thrust his lumbering gloom into the gay ghost
company of two-and-twenty?</p>

<p>He did not consider himself particularly good company for
anybody and, as on the steamer, he walked alone and silent. He
used none of the letters of introduction which the magnates at
home had heaped on him, urging, "Now be sure and look up my
friend Bill Brown-Potts; swell guy--for an Englishman; just like
you and me, Hay--plain as an old shoe, but a very important guy
in the coke business, a good golfer with a lovely wife and
kiddies."</p>

<p>Hayden did not feel that even the most dependable
old-shoe-ishness would raise his spirits. He was comfortable in
London, particularly well fed, but he planlessly hired a car to
go out and search for a flowery England of Anne Hathaway
cottages. But he was broodingly unable to see even the most ivied
tower as anything but a pile of stones till, inexplicably, the
miracle of recovered hope and courage transformed him.</p>

<p>He was on the Cornish coast, looking from the mainland at St.
Michael's Mount: the castled isle, the cherubic little clouds,
the gulls, the fishing boats drawn up on the flashing wet sand
and, beyond them, in the sun, the sea that rolled down to Spain
and Africa. Instantly, on his road to Damascus, the world so wide
turned beautiful and free. It was worth taking, and it was his to
take. There was no longer a pall of futility between him and the
sun; he had truly recovered his youth; he was back in the magic
and breathlessness of youth. He cried to himself, "Oh, <i>let</i>
yourself be happy!"</p>

<p>His soul lifted above all the several Hayden Charts that had
hitherto trudged the road of indecision, dusty and self-doubting.
That crustiest of taskmasters, himself, did let himself be
happy.</p>

<p>Again he had that lift, definite as sudden music, on the
steamer to Calais when first he left the England on which his
other youth had staked out too many claims, and for the first
time ventured on the new land that was so old beneath the towers
of Eldorado.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the American Express in Paris, there was a note from
Roxanna Eldritch of Newlife:</p>

<p>"Dear Hay, welcome to our instructive little continent. I've
been working hard, my editor seems to like my pieces explaining
how Trouville, Montreux, etc. almost as good as Colorado Sprgs.
Going to stay w. old sidekicks Mr &amp; Mrs Solly Evans of
Denver--oodles of money (inherited a railroad). They've taken a
show-place villa at Cannes rite on the shore. They know yr cousin
Edgar &amp; heard all about you &amp; be tickled pink if you
joined house-party for few days, do come. Your friend, Roxy."</p>

<p>Northern France was brown and drawn-in with late autumn, and
when he descended from his train at Cannes, it was like the
surprise of Pasadena: roses and palms and oranges and bamboo
after the desert. There was a light, gay quality in the air. It
seemed to have a sparkle of its own, and seemingly no one
strolling in the streets of the old provincial town had any care
more serious than the design to have another ap&eacute;ritif. And
out on the Mediterranean, so ancient, so sacred, now first seen
by Hayden, there were colored sails.</p>

<p>The Solly Evans villa was a rackety collection of terraces,
yellow plaster walls, an old stone tower to which had been tacked
a flimsy barracks of bedrooms, and a garden for oleanders and
mammoth grape vines, all on the edge of the sea, with a
rock-edged inlet for a swimming pool, and airy diving boards and
scarlet-cushioned lounge chairs under orange-and-black sunshades.
When Hayden crossed the terrace, ushered by a butler like a
Chicago undertaker, he first saw his host, a thin, browned young
man in a tattered rag for bathing suit, standing out on a diving
raft, bouncing a chrome-and-glass cocktail shaker.</p>

<p>"You're Hay, aren't you? Hi! I'm Solly!"</p>

<p>And on a rock bench beside the pool Hay saw Roxanna Eldritch,
in a French bathing suit which had, by the most skilled hands in
Paris, been thoughtfully made to look twice as nude as any
American bathing dress of one-half the dimensions. And when she
ran to kiss him, though her kiss was a light tap on his cheek,
rustic and innocent as Roxy herself had been on the train
platform in Newlife, yet he had a dismaying urge to curl his hand
about her bare waist.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" thought the pious hermit.</p>

<p>He was introduced to fellow guests: an American miss with
jolly eyes, hard mouth and hair like glass fiber, who had
something to do with the radio in Paris, a young Brazilian who
seemed to have no identity beyond owning a country house in
Switzerland, an Irish aviator, a young man who was something
important in an American bank in Brussels but who was English,
real or synthetic, an excessively gloomy but rich older American
manufacturer, a Spanish countess and a Swedish baron.</p>

<p>Among them the only one whose speech Hay could understand was
the Swede, so feverishly did the others scream. When lunch came
out from the main house, on wheeled wagons with things in aspic
and two-litre flasks of wine, the guests and the host and lean,
cheery hostess went off in shrieks in which Hayden could make out
only such indigestible bits as, "Actually, it was too, too
amusing," and, "Actually, it was too unutterably foul."</p>

<p>And with them, as passionately pointless as any of them,
chattered Roxanna Eldritch, once of Colorado.</p>

<p>After lunch they all had a siesta which, they said languidly,
was enforced by their admirable activity in dancing and gambling
till three in the morning. Hayden could not settle down to a
siesta. He sat grousing in his bedchamber, in which the white bed
and the white wardrobe doors were adorned with carved garlands
and indiscreet angels thickly gilded. He thought of Roxy as a
dear daughter gone regrettably mad, and then as a very
undaughterly girl with silky bare legs.</p>

<p>For the tennis hour, Roxy came out in a thin sweater and the
shortest shorts Hayden had ever seen; and for eight-thirty
dinner, she had a simple dress which, even to Hayden's eye, had
the simplicity of a masterful Parisian dressmaker; one which, as
a cub journalist and daughter of a small beet-sugar exploiter,
she certainly could not afford. It was of rather violent green,
and could not possibly have gone with her red hair, and did.</p>

<p>He contrived to segregate her from the backgammon players for
a talk, and it seemed to him that her slippery new slickness was
not borne easily, but was a little defiant and head-tossing, as
though she were saying, "I dare you to go back to that supid old
Newlife and say that I've turned fast!"</p>

<p>The note she had written to him had been full of the
colloquialisms of a soda fountain in Newlife, but her speech as
she lolled, neat knees showing, among scarlet cushions on the
gigantic eight-place davenport, was mostly a rattling imitation
of the English bright young things.</p>

<p>"I can see you're having a good time," he said paternally.</p>

<p>"I've been up to my eyebrows in the most amusing madnesses! My
new young man is the most appallingly brilliant young Hungarian
writer. He writes plays, verses, novels, criticism, everything. I
don't think any of it has been published yet, but he'll be
another Evelyn Waugh. Actually. And the Baronessa Gabinettaccio,
who is <i>the</i> most beautiful and most immoral <i>femme</i> in
Europe. Oh, <i>say</i> it, Uncle Hay! But don't you think Baby
has improved over here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You don't?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You might sugar it a little! Don't you think these people are
frightfully amusing?"</p>

<p>"No. And I liked you natural."</p>

<p>"My dear man, I am natural now! It was when I thought porridge
was something to eat that I wasn't natural. Besides! As Dicky
Floriat says, the post-war gen is too weary to live up to the
ardors of being their simple selves. . . . Oh, don't look so
glum, Grampa Hay! You're so middle-class. You dislike gaiety not
because it's immoral but because it's gay."</p>

<p>"I know. I've read some Oscar Wilde myself. But isn't he
slightly old-fashioned now? Sixty years ago!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Solly Evans insisted that the gambling rooms at the Casino,
over at Monte Carlo, were "great fun," and Hayden went to them
expecting a cinema circus of exiled grand dukes, with broad
ribbons of honor across their shirt fronts, quaffing champagne
from goblets and escorting ladies with tiaras and ermine, and,
with the barbaric splendid laughter of the steppes, winning and
losing millions of roubles. He expected, as guaranteed to him by
Hollywood, Greek millionaires and Argentine cattle-kings and
ruined princesses, in a somber magnificence rather like the new
D. and R. G. Depot, and caviar handed about like paper napkins,
and at least one suicide, nightly, at 11:17, of a young
Englishman of high family.</p>

<p>He found plenty of magnificence at the Casino, but it was a
magnificence in which large plaster lady roustabouts supported
baroque pillars, and chilly young women were depicted walking
through dewy meadows. Even in the inner gambling room, at the
roulette tables there was not so much as one obvious duke, grand
or Class B, but only faceless men in unpressed business suits and
yellowing-skinned old women of a dozen nationalities, quietly
hysterical as they risked, and so often lost, another fifty
cents. One of them half rose from her chair each time she
wagered, clutching her baggy throat as though she were very
sensibly choking herself to death here and now.</p>

<p>These disinterred witches were either frowsy or too
elaborately shingled and weather-sheathed; they were either
twitchingly agitated or dreadfully still, so intent on play that
nothing else existed for them. They were like corpses as the
croupier swiftly and callously paid out or raked in the bone
chips--dead men's bones.</p>

<p>As Roxanna looked at these derelict remittance-women she
shuddered. "I get what you mean, Hay! Yes. Let's go have a
wholesome banana split and then stay home and see a basketball
epic on the television. I'm having a frightful vision! I'm
married to a rich old monster over here and he dies and I'm so
bored with all the other sensations that I come here to play,
every evening. I live in a flat, like these old bags, and I don't
do anything till late afternoon, when it's time to come and start
gambling. Hay! Is Europe all played out?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! You'd find just as dreary dope-fiends shooting
crap in New York or Nevada--I guess. There is a great, stately
Europe--I think. I want to find it, to know it, to
<i>know!"</i></p>

<p>"Okay. I'll go back to Paris and swap my commutation ticket at
the Joujou Bar for a library card."</p>

<p>But Roxanna's estimable resolutions were sunk next day, when
they came on a Sadie Lurcher Big-Name party at the Hotel
Concilier, on Cap Attente.</p>

<p>The Concilier is so fashionable and international that it is
not merely a luxury hotel--an inn, a boarding-house, though it is
that, too, no doubt, with a vulgar balance-sheet and
dividends--but a purpose in life. The bath towels are nine feet
long, its food is as good as the average village inn, with more
parsley, and all the clerks speak six languages, not so much to
assist the accepted guests as to keep unwanted applicants away;
to snub undesirable persons like American millionaires who cannot
read French menus and even earls and countesses if they have been
suspected of voting Labor.</p>

<p>To a small rich man like Solly Evans, when he dares to sneak
in and buy a drink even in the larger and less exclusive Bayeux
Bar of the Concilier, the waiter says "Yes?" as if Solly's
intrusion is an astonishing mistake and, unless he tips three
times the amount of his bill, every waiter in the place turns
into a revolving electric refrigerator, wheeling toward him and
emitting a refreshing blizzard.</p>

<p>Sadie Lurcher was as <i>fin de tout</i> as the Concilier
itself. She was a stringy lady, immensely tall and virginal,
whose super-ambassadorial function was introducing munition
magnates, minor royalty and theatrical comets to one another. She
gave the most photographed luncheons in France, and nobody ever
quite seemed to know how she financed them. As to her origin,
there were different schools. She was variously reported as
having been born in America, Scotland, Russia and Smyrna.</p>

<p>She owned a modest castle above Cannes, fifty-six rooms with
fourteen habitable, but, for the greater convenience of the press
photographers, she gave her more intimate luncheons at the Hotel
Concilier pool, with its Petit Trianon Snack Bar, its vast
rock-pool of lofty diving boards and a raft made of balsa wood
and glass, and the world-renowned Picnic Plateau, up on a
sea-fronting cliff, where lunches were served outdoors by a
diplomatic corps of waiters in wigs and gold-laced mauve
tail-coats. This was to distinguish them from the guests, for the
richer, more notorious, oftener-divorced and wittier a male guest
was, the more likely he was to wear, at Sadie's repasts, nothing
but shorts, sandals, a revoltingly hairy chest, and a
toup&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Today, Sadie Lurcher was giving one of her nobler luncheons on
the Plateau. Her troupe included several ladies, beautiful or
titled or rich, and among the men, all in the uniform of hairy
chest and the light, easy friendliness that marks the more
perfected snob, were some of the world's most notorious names: an
ex-king, an ex-commanding general, an English author so proud of
everything British that he lived entirely in France, and two of
the most titanic of the Hollywood hierarchy, freshly flown in to
make a picture in Italy: a ducal producer, and a movie actor
twenty-six times as famous as the President of the United States.
You may see him scowling at you from posters startlingly
encountered in back alleys in Greece or China, and his brilliant
changes from barefacedness to wearing a ferocious beard are
pictured in the newspapers of thirty-nine countries.</p>

<p>From their humble distance Roxy looked adoringly up at this
Olympus, and snapped at Hayden, "It's all very well to talk, but
actually now, <i>actually,</i> the international set like that
has a wonderful life!"</p>

<p>"I know," mused Hayden. "Yes. It was to transfer power from
the munition-sellers and the old aristocracy to the airlines and
the movies and the radio and oil, from the eugenic to the
photogenic, that the young men died in the war and I heroically
built a billion cubic feet of hutments. When I look up there at
Rupert Osgoswold's Hemingwayesque bosom in person, I feel
rewarded. Roxy! Not so cheap!"</p>

<p>She looked at him irritably, and went off to get a
cocktail.</p>

<p>He was to leave for Italy. Probably Roxy would be taking her
newly excavated European glitter back to New York and become a
streamlined career woman, lively and expensive and elegant,
slippery as quicksilver and as hard. Himself, he would have a few
weeks in Florence and Rome and Naples, and go home. He thought
that now he could endure Jesse Bradbin and the querulous clients
who wanted Louis Seize redwood.</p>

<p>He would be missing nothing in Europe. He had not made one
friend here, and in Roxanna he had lost the one friend he
had.</p>

<p>At the Cannes station, in a limp dawn when the palm trees were
too damp to clatter and the sunshine-yellow awnings of the
caf&eacute;s were pulled up and dripping, he said good-bye to
Roxanna and Solly Evans, who were mechanical and regretful and
very sleepy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The railway station at Florence had a fine, flaring Mussolini
touch, very spacious and inclined to marble and wood panels, but
the piazza in front of it was of a suburban drabness, and the
back of the church of S. Maria Novella was a mud-colored
bareness, sullen with evening. He would not be staying here long!
His taxi-driver was learning English, and was willing to make it
a bi-lingual party, but as Hayden's Italian was limited to
<i>bravo, spaghetti, zabaglione</i> and the notations on sheet
music, this promising friendship did not get far, and he went to
bed blankly at the admirable Hotel Excelsior.</p>

<p>But in the bright morning of late autumn he looked from his
hotel and began to fall in love with a city.</p>

<p>He saw the Arno, in full brown tide after recent mountain
rains, with old palaces along it and cypress-waving hills beyond.
On one side was the tower of Bellosguardo and a fragment of the
old city wall, and on the other the marvel of the church of San
Miniato, white striped with a dark green that seemed black from
afar. Hayden saw a city of ancient reticences and modern energy,
with old passageways, crooked and mysterious, arched over with
stone that bore carven heraldic shields.</p>

<p>"I like this! Maybe I'll stay out the week."</p>

<p>There was then living in Florence a friend and classmate of
Hayden's father: a retired American automobile-manufacturer,
competent engineer and man of business, aged seventy-five or so,
named Samuel Dodsworth. Hayden sent a letter up to him by hand at
his Villa Canterbury on Torre del Gallo Hill, and the Dodsworth
chauffeur brought down a note inviting Hayden to cocktails that
afternoon.</p>

<p>In between, he trudged the erratic streets of Florence, so
unchanged from medieval days that from a secret courtyard you
expected to see emerge a lady with peaked headdress and a gallant
in satin with a falcon perched on his wrist, and he came full on
the Piazza della Signoria, where Savonarola was martyred, where
rears the Palazzo Vecchio, with its heaven-high tower.</p>

<p>He was deeply contented as he was driven up the hill to Samuel
Dodsworth's.</p>

<p>Unlike most Italian villas, which show to the passer-by only a
plastered wall flush with the street and a small door that opens
on the delights of garden and terrace within, the Dodsworths'
Villa Canterbury, which had been built for Lord Chevanier in
1880, was set back from the street, with a lawn and an ilex
alley. It was a timbered manor house, half-English and
half-Yonkers. The interior was chintz and willow plate and
Jacobean oak, and the chief change from his Lordship's day was
that the Paris <i>Herald Tribune</i> had ousted the London
<i>Times,</i> and the <i>Yale Alumni Magazine</i> the
<i>Fortnightly Review.</i></p>

<p>Not even yet was Hayden up to an eight-thirty-dinner schedule
and, arriving at six, he was half an hour early for cocktails,
which gave him a chance to study his hosts. Dodsworth was a tall,
portly, gray-mustached man, given to quiet listening, and his
wife, to whom he referred as Edith, looked somewhat Italian,
though Hayden thought that she might have been born in Canada or
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Dodsworth, in his armchair, was a largeness and a solidity; he
looked as though he would not willingly move from it. He asked of
Hayden, amiably, "Let's see: how long is it now since Monty--your
father--died?"</p>

<p>"Ten years ago, and my mother just afterward."</p>

<p>"They were mighty good Americans. Did you know your father
used to make applejack in college? Once he gave a party that
started at three A.M. and lasted till noon. I lost eleven dollars
and a photograph of Sarah Bernhardt, playing penny ante."</p>

<p>"No! Why, he was a crank, though very gentle about it, on the
evils of booze and gambling!"</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to have known! How long you staying in Italy,
Hayden?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell yet. I had a motor smash, and I'm taking a few
months off. I may stay in Florence for--for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Don't stay in Italy too long--or anywhere else abroad. It
gets you. Since I was fool enough to sell the Revelation Motor
Company, Edith and I have drifted through India and China and
Austria and God knows where all, and this time, we've been back
in Italy for three years--course, Edith's been coming here off
and on for many years. Well, we tried to go back and live in the
States, in Zenith, but we're kind of spoiled for it. Everybody is
so damn busy making money there that you can't find anybody to
talk with, unless you're willing to pay for it by busting a gut
playing golf. And I got to dislike servants that hate you and
hate every part of their job except drawing their pay. I like
having the girl here bring me my slippers without feeling so
doggone humiliated that she rushes out and joins the Communist
Party!</p>

<p>"And back home, this last time, I was bored listening to all
the men I used to know talking about hunting and fishing and
baseball and same old golf. Fishing! Hell, I used to skip down to
Florida, one time, and enjoy yanking in a mean tarpon as much as
anybody, but when you hear most of those old, gray-haired
galoots, the way they talk about catching a vest-pocket black
bass, you'd think the man was a ten-year-old brat that had just
hooked his first crappie. Kind of immature, they struck me--even
fellows that could swing a big traction deal and skin a board of
directors that had cut their first teeth on broken bottles.</p>

<p>"And--when I was still in harness in Zenith, I never was the
skittish kind, much. I never did like our brand of humor any too
well. I always got kind of sour when a smart banker that was a
good friend of mine, nice fellow, too, but he always had to yell
at you, 'Well, you old horse thief!' After the first
twenty-thirty thousand times, I thought that got less
original--and every time he saw you, he tried to tickle you. I
can get along with awful little tickling! And now I cotton to
hearty humor even less than I used to.</p>

<p>"And then I like these hills in Tuscany and the monasteries
and villas and the variety of it--get in your car and in an hour
or so you're in San Gimignano, looking at those old towers.
Starts your imagination working about the old wars and battles
right there where you're standing. Or you're in Siena and have
lunch out in that old square there and look at that big slender
tower and wonder how the devil those old fellows managed to raise
those enormous blocks of stone without any of our machinery.</p>

<p>"Afraid I'm not putting up any very good argument about
chasing you back home, but I mean--that's what's so dangerous
here; you do get to like it and hesitate to go back and face
responsibilities, and that would be bad for a young fellow like
you. Me--I never can learn this cursed Italian language; Edith
has an awful time getting me to say <i>acqua fresca</i> when I
want a glass of water. But I do like to have food that you can
eat and wine that you can drink without paying four and a half
bucks at a restaurant for a burnt steak and some fried spuds
flavored with penicillin!</p>

<p>"Still, I do get homesick, and I never miss my class reunion
in New Haven, never!</p>

<p>"Edith, you better shut me up! I haven't gassed this long for
a year. It's having Hayden here, and get in the first crack at
him and tell him to beat it, go right home and stay there--and
then go downtown and sign another two-year lease on this house.
In which, Hayden, we may have Italian servants, but you bet your
life we got first-class American central heating!"</p>

<p>Guests were beginning to chatter in, but before the cocktails
came, Mrs. Dodsworth led Hayden out on the terrace for the View
which, by Florence custom, is advertised along with laundry
equipment, garage, cost of upkeep and distance from Leland's
Bar.</p>

<p>Although it was masked by the early darkness, Hayden was
conscious of power in the aspect of Florence below them in its
golden basket, between this hill range of Arcetri and, far
across, the Fiesole Hill. Mrs. Dodsworth could point out the
scarcely seen tower of the Bargello, Giotto's bell tower, the
spire of Santa Croce while, flaunting, soaring, even more
whelming than by day in the floodlights which the mists turned to
wreaths of floating rose, the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio
dominated the world more than any bullying skyscraper of a
hundred steel-strapped stories.</p>

<p>As an architect, as a tongueless poet, Hayden was uplifted; as
a lonely man on a voyage to find himself, he wondered if down
there, in that pattern of sunken stars, he might not find a clue
to his lost highway. He was in love, and if only with a city, he
knew that he could still move to the magic of love for
something.</p>

<p>And then he went in to say Yes, he thought an olive in his dry
martini would be fine.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The guests were most of them from the Florentine
Anglo-American Colony, which is united only in a firm avoidance
of their beloved native lands. There were a few of the scholarly
eccentrics for whom Florence has been renowned ever since Dante,
but the rest were of the active militia of card players.</p>

<p>Of high rank among the bridge-brigade was Mrs. Orlando
Weepswell, a sixty-year-old widow, very rich. She had lived in
the handsome Villa Portogallo for twenty years now, and had
learned forty-seven words of Italian, most of them meaning "too
much" or "too late." She was the daughter of a country pastor
and, as a girl, had in a surprised and doubtful way become the
bride of a banker and shipowner who was occasionally a
congressman, often a Sunday-school teacher, and always a crook.
Her Florentine villa had wine-red brocaded walls and
hypothetically antique chairs with tooled-leather seats, but in
her bedroom, safe from the jeers of the Colonists, she kept the
Hon. Mr. Weepswell's favorite Morris chair.</p>

<p>She was the first person except the amiable Dodsworths to make
Hayden feel so warmly at home that he believed he could live as
securely and as naturally in Florence as in Newlife.</p>

<p>When you looked at Tessie Weepswell you did not see a woman of
sixty but the glove-soft credulous girl who had been sandbagged
by the Honorable Orlando. You saw her pretty fleetness and
innocence all unchanged, and her eyes undimmed. Her voice was
still quivery with enthusiasms about ice cream and kittens and
James Whitcomb Riley. It was just that over her face was a dusty
veil of many years' weaving which, surely, she could twitch away
whenever she chose.</p>

<p>"Now you <i>must</i> rent a villa and live here, Mr. Chart,"
she panted. "Honestly, we need you!" (One likes to hear that,
especially a shy and warm-hearted man like Hayden.) "The minute I
spotted you here I said to myself, 'Now there's a man with
sensitive feelings, that ain't a lotus-eater like the rest of us
gilded snobs, and that would be real nice to sit and visit with!'
And I'll bet you'll learn Italian like a house afire! Do you know
any yet?"</p>

<p>"Well, today I've picked up the Italian for 'where is?' and
'veal' and 'consomm&eacute; with noodles.'"</p>

<p>"My, that's wonderful! In one day! You're a real linguist! But
how well do you know your Ely Culbertson?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"I <i>knew</i> you were a scholar, minute I laid eyes on you.
You're invited to tea at my little shack whenever you feel the
least mite lonely."</p>

<p>Hayden was pounced upon then by Augusta Terby--Gus--a fine,
flushed, tennis-leaping English girl of thirty, who looked like a
roan horse and who was attended by a mamma who looked like a
suspicious pony. Augusta believed that all American males were
rich, and willing to be espoused and have some one to send out
the laundry. She invited Hayden to play tennis and have a nice
cup of tea at their villa. He felt more than ever a citizen of
this generous frontier village, the Colony, and Augusta felt, as
she had not for nearly a week now, that this time she really had
solved her matrimonial puzzle, while Augusta's mother asked
Hayden how he liked London--a sign of recognition with which she
favored very few of these strange, loud American Cousins.</p>

<p>With these pawns there were larger chessmen on the Dodsworths'
black-and-white checkered-marble music-room floor. Hayden was
privileged to see Sir Henry Belfont, Bart., that mossiest and
most moated of British historical monuments, an outsize
donjon-tower in morning clothes, with a deerpark of eyebrows, and
Lady Belfont, a small and silent American heiress.</p>

<p>Sir Henry welcomed Hayden with what he considered absolute
folksiness:</p>

<p>"Ah. An American!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! You are staying for some time?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find our Florentia very provincial,
after your resplendent Hollywood and New York!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sir Henry had apparently let him in.</p>

<p>Hayden was most taken with a Santa Claus of a man, beard and
round belly and kind, discriminating eyes: Professor Nathaniel
Friar, who had come here from Boston almost half a century ago.
Friar was talking with his friend Prince Ugo Tramontana, shaven
and tall and lean, the last of a fabulous but decayed Tuscan
family. Mrs. Dodsworth whispered that these two men were the only
near-rivals in Florence of Bernard Berenson in knowledge of early
Italian art and love for it. They attended the Dodsworths'
clinics because they liked the host and hostess, and because the
food was rich and piled high, and neither of them got very much
of it at home. They bowed to Hayden amiably, and he felt that he
would like such men as neighbors. They were the keepers of the
learning that he desired.</p>

<p>All this while, even when he was being bright about backhand
shots with Gus Terby, he had been looking past the others at a
young woman of twenty-seven or -eight who seemed as out of place
as Hayden himself. He thought of ivory as he noted the curious
Mediterranean pale-dark hue of her oval face, of her competent
hands, which would be smooth to the touch: her cheeks and brow
and hands smooth as a horn spoon, as a tortoise-shell box, as an
ivory crucifix. Her black hair was parted above the oval ivory
face; over her head was a gold-threaded ivory-colored scarf, and
her dress was of pure cream-colored wool with no adornment except
a broad belt of golden fabric. There was something Latin,
something royal in her, something almost holy, free from human
vulgarity and all desire except for the perfection of
sainthood.</p>

<p>When this paragon joined Professor Friar and Prince Ugo, with
whom she seemed to be on terms of familiarity and respect, Hayden
asked Mrs. Dodsworth, "Is that girl talking to Mr. Friar an
Italian? She could be a <i>principessa.</i>"</p>

<p>"No, she's a plain Miss, and she's an American, but she does
speak Italian almost well enough for a native. Her name is Olivia
Lomond--Dr. Lomond, I suppose it is. She's a professor, or
assistant professor or something, in the history department at
the State University of Winnemac, of which my Sam is a trustee.
That's how we happen to know her, because I imagine she looks
down on us bridge maniacs. She's doing research on some
manuscript records in the Laurentian Library for a year or so.
Would you like to meet her?"</p>

<p>He earnestly would.</p>

<p>Olivia Lomond, when he talked with her, was a little blank;
civil enough but not interested. Yes, she was collating some
Machiavelli and Guicciardini manuscripts with early official
records of Florence; a dusty job, not very rewarding. Yes, she
taught at Winnemac: Early European History, especially the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance in Italy.</p>

<p>Hayden tried, "That's a period that, just now, I'd like to
know more than anything in the world, and I'm as ignorant of it
as a Colorado sheepherder. It must have so much more than just
sword-and-roses romance."</p>

<p>She nodded and she said nothing, but her expression said
clearly enough, "Yes, of course you would be ignorant of it; you,
the American businessman, the tourist!"</p>

<p>He was piqued, and he boasted, "Naturally, as an architect, I
suppose I could draw from memory the floor plans of the
Riccardi-Medici palace."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, you're an architect? In the States?"</p>

<p>"Out West. Newlife. Do you know it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not--afraid not." Nor did she seem very much to
want to know it. She was merely paying a conversational rent on
her cocktail. "Do you speak any Italian?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not--no." He was determined to be as lofty as this
goddess whose ivory veins were filled with ice-cold ink.</p>

<p>"You should speak it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If you ask that, you answer me."</p>

<p>"It's not a very important commodity in Newlife. But then, you
probably don't think much of Newlife."</p>

<p>"How could I? It just hasn't entered my philosophy of life. I
have no doubt it's a very friendly community, with lovely shade
trees--one of the most enterprising spots in Nebraska."</p>

<p>He let it go. He disliked her; perhaps, with a little
attention to it, he could hate her. She seemed indifferent not
only to him but, as she glanced about while they talked, to all
males. Only when it fell on old Professor Friar, in his shabby
sack suit and ill-regimented beard, was her look kindly. She had
bartered her soul for trifles of learning that were no more
important, in the atomic age, than a list of Assyrian kings.
Suave as ivory, passionless as ivory, Olivia Lomond made him
suddenly prize the file-rasping fussing of Mary Eliza
Bradbin--about bidding and rubber overshoes and sandwich
fillings--as fecund and womanly.</p>

<p>Uninterestedly continuing her social duty, Dr. Lomond droned
at Hayden, "Are you staying here for some days?"</p>

<p>Astounded by his own news, he heard himself asserting, "I may
stay here for some years!"</p>

<p>"No! Really?"</p>

<p>He had aroused her--to at least as much attention as she would
give to a donkey cart in the street, and, as she said "Really?"
he had perceived that her voice was beautiful: melodious, rather
grave, suitable to a woman all of ivory.</p>

<p>She sounded almost half-interested with, "Are you to have an
official position here?"</p>

<p>"No. No job. I shall just be studying--go back to school in my
senility. I want to master your blasted Italian speech and
history."</p>

<p>But there never was anything so cold as her, "I'm sure that
will be amusing," and she turned to talk to Augusta Terby.</p>

<p>He had meant it--for that moment he had. He would set up shop
as a scholar; he would be an Erasmus, a Grosseteste, an Albertus
Magnus, if only to <i>show</i> this intellectual snob of a lady
professor.</p>

<p>But he did not like her enough to hate her; to want to hurt
her. Dr. Lomond fascinated him like a rattlesnake on a putting
green. He kept looking at her for the rest of the cocktail hour,
while she talked, seemingly on level terms, with that great
gentleman, that superior historian, Prince Ugo Tramontana. Her
voice came across the room to him like the flowing of small
waters, not the flat, provincial quacking of so many vigorous
young women at home. Whether or not he would attain it, Dr.
Lomond was worthy of a good healthy hating.</p>

<p>He would <i>show</i> her, and in her show the whole wide
world.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>His good-night from Dr. Lomond was as curt as though she did
not remember ever having seen him. Her eyes were beautiful, and
so unmoved, so superior to all the angry, corrupting temptations
of life, he reflected, because she did not know that there were
any temptations. He thought rudely, "I'm going to get a D Minus
in her class and there is no use trying to bluff her. She
wouldn't be angry. She'd just efficiently flunk me."</p>

<p>But the Dodsworths so warmly invited him to return that he
still felt at home in Florence.</p>

<p>He planned to walk down the hill to his hotel, and considered
himself rather heroic over a foot journey of half an hour. In
Newlife a man, unless he be strengthened by carrying a golf club,
has to take out his car for any distance of more than three
blocks. He found Professor Nathaniel Friar also intending to
walk. Apparently to him, walking was not a new invention,
startling and rather risky, but a normal means of getting places.
So old-fashioned had this Bostonian become in his four decades
abroad. They jogged downhill together, looking at the
light-pricked city below and at the road lamps looping up the
hill to Fiesole, miles away.</p>

<p>"You had an agreeable time, talking to Miss Lomond?" said
Professor Friar.</p>

<p>"She seems intelligent. But a little distant."</p>

<p>"She's cool. Women scholars occasionally get like that.
They're dedicated. Frequently they aren't certain to what they're
dedicated, but clearly it can't be to such wingless objects in
trousers as you and I. This Lomond girl is a really competent and
accurate compiler of quite useless facts, so naturally she seems
a bit suspect to most men--and to all women. You can't ask
females to 'burn with a hard, gemlike flame' and still be
obliging about waffles at midnight. Here we are. This is my
place. Do come in and see it."</p>

<p>"Professor" Friar, oftener known as Nat, had never been a
regularly enlisted professor of anything beyond Veronese wines
and the more acceptable sorts of Italian sausages, nor had he
ever written anything more popular than articles in journals of
art criticism so learned that just the look of the gray, close
pages made your eyes ache. But he had explored every Tuscan and
Umbrian church and village, and he could tell you the name and
dates of every third-cousin of Domenico Ghirlandaio.</p>

<p>For twenty years he had lived in this five-room wing of the
massive Palazzo Gilbercini, sharing the geometric gardens and
their cypress alleys ending at coy nude statues. He had never
been rich, but the securities left to him by his mother, a
Trenchard of Braintree, had provided him with a few casks of
wine, a great many books in eight languages, a Perugian altar
cloth of 1235, half a dozen chairs, a canister of Earl Grey's
Mixture tea for his friends, and one noble picture: an
Annunciation by Getto di Jacopo, a picture reverent and softly
human, soft blues and grays against lambent gold, the kneeling
angel so exalted, the Madonna so timidly proud, her head bent
over the lily in her fragile hand.</p>

<p>As Hayden stared at the Getto, hung against a faded Egyptian
rug above a table bristly with old pipes, he began to take hold
of the medieval passion for identification with the divine spirit
and its longing for authority, earthly and heavenly. He drank his
vermouth and lemon juice--Nat Friar considered cocktails as he
would a griffin: exciting but not practical--and he looked at the
comfortable frowsiness of Nat and felt at home as he never had
felt at home at home.</p>

<p>Nat Friar was large and fat and thick-bearded and his eyes
were cheerful. There always was pipe-ash on his vest; his rather
small living room smelled of tobacco and brandy; and he loved to
sit up all night and talk about immortality and Baron Corvo and
the Lucca Cathedral.</p>

<p>"Why have you lived here so long?" demanded Hayden. "Or is
that impertinent?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing more pertinent. In my case, it might seem to be a
self-indulgent escape from reality and the dry-goods business, of
which my paternal grandfather was a ferocious pioneer armed with
a yardstick. But I think my life has been devoted to proving that
one can be just as smugly self-righteous and still do no honest
work.</p>

<p>"My occupation and my vice are hoarding useless knowledge, I
know more about the history of the Palazzo dei Consoli at Gubbio
than any other living man, and nobody cares, including myself.
And I like to go on sprees of something new: biology or Sanskrit.
Learning, for its own winsome, perverse self--hug it to you but
keep a club handy. It is the most entertaining of all mistresses,
and the least to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Particularly must one avoid the superstition that there is
some mystical virtue in erudition. We all feel that some day we
shall be sought after by the pretty girls for our spoken Arabic,
our kindness to Cousin Mimosa, or the neatness in which we keep
our medicine cabinets. We shan't! These virtuous doings should be
cultivated for their own sake alone.</p>

<p>"I have of late been peeping into the history of the Baglioni
family of Perugia, a charming chronicle, all iron and gold
clotted with fraternal blood and the tears of ardent young
widows. What subject could be more beautiful and useless? Guard
your idleness. You are surrounded by barbarians armored with
sobriety and punctuality and the Book of 1001 Useful Facts. Be ye
watchful in sloth, lest ye be corrupted into industriousness and
become a Public Figure, a supporter of all worthy causes, a
member of the Elks Club and the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur, and have
five hundred citizens enjoy your funeral--at fifty."</p>

<p>"I'm safe," insisted Hayden. "My partner--I'm an
architect--thinks I'm poetically impractical. Tell me: how shall
I go about learning Italian?"</p>

<p>"Look over the several accredited springs of Tuscan undefiled:
the university, the commercial language schools, the highly
educated decayed professors who combine Italian grammar with
voice-culture and the black-market exchange of dollars. Then
forget all of them and get a girl."</p>

<p>"I might!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean one like Miss Lomond, who would teach you
Dante's directions to Hell, but one who will teach you
<i>important</i> things, like 'These pair of socks by favor to
darn' and, 'Bring to me suddenly a plate of anchovies.'"</p>

<p>"Are Dante and anchovies incompatible?"</p>

<p>"Linguistically. I speak an Italian which would thrill the
archbishop by its accuracy; I can address a learned academy on
the Battle of Cortenuova in Italian, and they will wail with
admiration, but when I ask for a pair of shoelaces, the clerk
answers me in bad English, and wants to know whether I'm staying
in Florence overnight. . . . By the way, if you'd like, I'll
invite you to tea with Miss Lomond. You may find her
admirable."</p>

<p>"Well, she might introduce me to some American students more
nearly my own mental age--sixteen!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He sat in what was to become his favorite room in Florence,
the bar of the Hotel Excelsior with its dark mirroring wood and
its two bartenders, Enrico and Raffaele, the men in town most
worth cultivating, and he contentedly planned to stay in Florence
for a week, a month, a season. He would pray for a Biblical
miracle: to become again as a little child, and go back to
school.</p>

<p>Next morning he again climbed the Torre del Gallo Hill, to
have by clear light the view he had seen in twilight enchantment.
Below him he saw the bronze-red majesty of the cathedral dome,
and Giotto's tower--as ivory as Olivia Lomond. Fiesole, across
the valley, was sharply defined on a hill silver-gray with olive
trees. Florence is a thousand years less old than Rome, yet in
its medieval reds and yellows and dark passageways, it seems
older, as in New England a moldering gingerbread mansion of 1875
seems more venerable than a severe white parsonage of 1675.</p>

<p>"I'll do it. I'll stay. I'll hunt for Michelozzos, not
mallards!" said Hayden.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dr. Olivia Lomond was at Nat Friar's modest tea, frowning and
duskily beautiful in her plain brown dress--that is, all of her
was there except her heart and soul and manners. But Hayden was
diverted by the presence of Nat's prim and aged sweetheart, Mrs.
Shaliston Baker, whose unbubbling fount had been Boston. She was
as small and quiet as a sparrow that has been discreetly reared
in the Harvard Yard, and she wore her grandmother's cameo brooch.
She spoke exquisite Italian, even if her English did smack a
little of flapping codfish tails and the clatter of lead-foil in
chests for China tea. She belonged to the Dante Society, which
meets to discuss the longing of Florence to get Dante's poor
exiled corpse back from stubborn Ravenna. It is an up-to-date
topic, and has been so since 1320.</p>

<p>Every Sunday for a fifth of a century, these reserved lovers,
Ada Baker and Nat, had had tea together.</p>

<p>Nat gave them food as noble as the Samuel Dodsworths', and
Hayden guessed that he would by considerable omission in his own
meals make up for this fedora cake, which is the Florentine
specialty, with chocolate and whipped cream on it, and for the
hot American toast, the honey from Monte Rosa, the tea and
blackberry jam and ginger from London.</p>

<p>There were peacefulness and chatter. Nat chronicled his search
for a lost altarpiece of Guiduccio Palmerucci through lofty,
wind-raked hill towns of Umbria; a tale of sleeping on stone
floors, living on bread and olives, and finding that one village
was gaily planning to beat him to death as a tax-spy from Rome.
Hayden suspected that Nat's confession of being unable to buy
shoelaces in Italian had been a great and gentlemanly lie, and
that the old fraud could actually speak an Italian as colloquial,
bloodthirsty and beautiful as a Neapolitan taxi-driver's.</p>

<p>As the talk passed to Dr. Lomond, hers was no glimpse of
romantic espionage in mountain passes at twilight, but a
complaint about the dusty-eyed, head-cracking drudgery of pawing
over a thousand papers in her present investigation of the
maternal source of Duke Alessandro de' Medici--the one who was so
wholesomely murdered in 1537. The Duke's mother, sighed Dr.
Lomond, did not seem to have been a lady of doubtful virtue. She
just didn't have any virtue to be doubtful about.</p>

<p>From both of these hygienic ghouls Hayden had clues to an
erudition which should not be a smart assemblage of facts to
equip a man who should have been an auctioneer or a train-caller
to "get a Ph.D.", nor a putting on of spangled intellectual
costumes to impress the dullards, nor a job, nor a gentlemanly
way of passing the time, but a gently ruthless, secretly panting,
rival-murdering hunt for the facts which are the bones of truth;
an unremitting war in which your quick and sympathetic allies are
men and women who have themselves been historic facts for five
hundred years.</p>

<p>Such scholarship he had never beheld in Newlife, and even in
Amherst College and in his school of architecture, it had been
rare, and not considered quite well bred, nor useful for grabbing
a Full Professorship.</p>

<p>When Jesse Bradbin went in his swift automobile on a
sightseeing tour, Jesse explained, "Ah, what the hell, you don't
want to learn too doggone much about all these Beauty Spots and
Points of Interest. Just give 'em the once-over and see what
they're like and be able to say you've been there. When I'm on a
tower, if I can't kill five hundred miles a day, I figure I'm
wasting my time, and if my wife hollers about missing the
scenery, I tell her, 'Oh, we'll catch that on the way
back--maybe!'"</p>

<p>That philosophy of Bradbin, pompously offered at the
country-club bar as something new and valuable, caused no riots
or harsh cries of offended dignity. "Yuh, that's so," agreed the
president of the Ranchers and Silver National Bank.</p>

<p>The tyro Hayden was as moved. It was not with hostility or
with a flirtatiousness that winked to itself that he petitioned
Dr. Lomond, as they tramped together from Nat's down to the
tramline, "I wish you'd do me the favor of having dinner with me
this evening, if you are free."</p>

<p>"I don't know--uh--Mister--Chart? I'm not sure I can. . .
."</p>

<p>He was sick of all his meekness. "Then you know damn well you
can! Come on!"</p>

<p>"But I would prefer . . ."</p>

<p>"If you're one of these independent females that insist on
paying their own share, I don't mind. We can go dutch."</p>

<p>"I don't insist on anything of the kind! I'm delighted to find
a man who will buy me a dinner! I'm lucky when I'm out with some
wistful young male student--<i>so</i> sensitive and clever--and
don't have to buy <i>his!</i> Italy may be the home of gallantry,
but lone lady grinds don't often get invited to dinner."</p>

<p>"Not even when they're beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Not even when they're <i>very</i> beautiful!"</p>

<p>With that, she surprisingly smiled at him, and looked nearly
human.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Let's see--maybe Oliviero's or the Paoli or Nandina's.
Nandina's is light and bright and quiet and great food. Usually,
when I don't mournfully stay at my <i>pensione</i> for dinner, I
get taken to one of these frantic student hang-outs, the kind
they call 'Bohemian,' which means noisy and not very clean,
tables elbow-to-elbow, filled with American G.I. graduate
students and Belgian painters and White Russians whose only
profession is being White Russians and English ladies whose only
profession is living in small villas back of other villas.
They're all so poor. I hate poor people! I'm so poor myself!"</p>

<p>"Those--uh--Bohemian restaurants sound pretty interesting,
though," confessed the tourist. "But we'll go to Nandina's
tonight."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He so far reverted to the meekness which he had sworn to
forswear as to chuck masculine pride and ask her to do the
ordering of dinner. While she rattled the menu, he was fixed on
Dr. Olivia Lomond; he saw that at her neck and the wrists of her
sexless workaday brown dress were little edgings of fine Burano
lace, somehow touching. Her hands were not small. They had the
untiring competence of a workman, of a peasant, but they were
extraordinarily smooth, and there was an anxious gesture toward
feminineness in the two small, ruby rings that betrayed her
strong fingers. And he noticed that her nails were slightly
tinted now. They had not been so at the Dodsworths'. Had she put
this on for the tea-party--for him?</p>

<p>But his feeling that there might be ardor buried in her was
killed by her mechanical questions, neither liking him enough to
rejoice in his presence nor yet fearing him enough to be at all
wary with him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have made some progress in your plan to study
Florence?"</p>

<p>"No--just wandered around, you know, walked 'round."</p>

<p>"Anything you've especially liked?"</p>

<p>"No--oh, lot of different things."</p>

<p>And they fell silent and looked at a family birthday party at
a table across the room. There was about the family nothing of
the faded gold of aristocracy nor yet of the "quaint and
picturesque natives" for whom the three-day tripper seeks. They
were all volubly Italian, but in look and dress the father might
have been a businessman of London or Glasgow or Pittsburgh. He
was the type of tall, busy and competent engineer or salesman who
was trying to rebuild Italy after two wars and two million
foreign tourists. His wife would have seemed normal in Stockholm
or Des Moines. But in their exuberant family affection they did
differ from the couples whom Hayden knew. And the grandmother
laughed in secret intimacy with the youngest child; the
middle-sized small boy burlesqued his bachelor uncle's
flourishing way of eating an artichoke, and the uncle laughed
loudest of them all.</p>

<p>"Families! They seem to exist here, still," wondered
Hayden.</p>

<p>"And they did all through Italian history. A brother would
either murder his brother--which, I suppose, may be one way of
showing keen domestic interest--or else he would go out to a
neighboring tower and murder a rival family there, to keep his
brother in the Council. All Italian history is made up of layers
of families."</p>

<p>Hayden complained, "Seems to me that at home the children
consider the house just a free inn and rental garage. And we
older deserters: I have two sisters and a brother who live in
four different states and don't see one another twice in a
decade, and I have three nephews--no, four it is now, I
guess--that I've never seen at all!"</p>

<p>Dr. Lomond sounded regretful, her cold independence betrayed
by memory. "Sometimes I've thought I'd like to be the founder of
a family, like those grand old American women who went West in a
Conestoga wagon. Then, maybe, one would never be lonely."</p>

<p>"Ah! You get lonely here, too!"</p>

<p>She abruptly cloaked her wistfulness again, and said sharply,
"Never! Not now, I mean."</p>

<p>"Didn't you a little when you first came to Europe?"</p>

<p>She studied her forkful of long ivory-colored strands of
<i>tagliatelli;</i> she seemed shyly to be remembering the girl
student that had been, and she answered with some March-morning
warmth in her voice:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I was, first. I would tell myself that I was a
trained traveler. Hadn't I gone way off to graduate school at
Columbia, with mother's lunch, deviled-ham sandwiches and
hard-boiled eggs, in a shoebox? And in <i>Europe</i>--oh, I
<i>couldn't</i> get lonely, all this to see, and I had plenty of
resources in myself; I could read and think, couldn't I? Not like
girls who had to have flattery from slobbering men all the while.
Besides, I scolded myself, I had been adequately conditioned to
loneliness in my first year of teaching at Winnemac; I just
corrected papers there and took long walks.</p>

<p>"So I surely couldn't be anything but cheerful in the panorama
of Europe. But I was lonely in Paris, I was lonely in Rome, and
when I first came to Florence, nearly two years ago . . . I'm not
impressed by these celebrated lonely prisoners who made a pet of
a rat. I made a pet of a housefly."</p>

<p>"But you can't!"</p>

<p>"I did!"</p>

<p>"How could you tell . . . ?'</p>

<p>"There was only one in my room--winter it was, too cold for
flies, but this one, really, he was the bravest, most clever
little fly. His name was Nicky."</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"He told me so."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"The minute I'd come back to my room from the library and take
off my jacket, he'd be there lighting on it--perhaps barking a
welcome in some infinitesimal way. Nights, he slept on the
hot-water tap, always. He never touched my breakfast till I had
finished it; just walk on the rim of the tray and look at the pot
of honey. He would take walks on my hand without tickling
me--quite the most refined fly in Florence--and the only person
here that I knew well, till I met Professor Friar. Don't you call
that a loneliness of distinction--to be ecstatic over a
housefly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's big league. What happened to Nicky?"</p>

<p>"He passed away. From pneumonia. He is now buried, though
without a tombstone, in a volume of Mirandola manuscript letters
in the Laurentian Library."</p>

<p>"I understand him, slightly," said Hayden. "When I first went
off to college, there was an imitation oriental rug in my room,
and because I was too scared to find one single happy thing to
do, the first four-five days, I sat mooning over that rug till it
occurred to me that one of the figures in it was like a dancing
girl, young and gay, with whirling ballet skirts and gold
stockings--darling, rather small face, excited and innocent.</p>

<p>"Her imaginary smile kept me alive all that first week in
college. The next fall, she had vanished, sold along with her
rug, to some sordid flesh-dealer. But last night, here at my
hotel, when I was drearily thinking that, after all, I might
drift on to Rome, I saw her again in my bedroom rug: dancing in a
different show now, very different costume, silly costume,
feather boa and a huge muff and a lively little pillbox cap, but
there she was, cheering me again, bidding me stay here, for she
would comfort me. . . . Seventeen years later!"</p>

<p>"I would not have supposed you were so imaginative, Mr.
Chart."</p>

<p>"Why not?" (A little huffily.)</p>

<p>"No reason. Just my stupidity. I'm a hermit, in a cell roofed
over with books, looking for gallantry in the <i>trecento,</i>
and so I miss it when it stands right in front of my cell, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"What did you think I'd be like--Olivia?"</p>

<p>"Oh--efficient, clean, kind, devoted to your wife and children
and your friends and your favorite daily paper--though I'm sure
you have risen from the sports page to the editorial."</p>

<p>"Is that a rise? Well, my wife is dead, I have no children,
and only very casual friends, and my partner in architecture--at
least by preference he would not be an architect at all but a
salesman and a penny-grinder: Jesse Bradbin--he's an illiterate,
and yet I like him and admire him and his wife, Mary Eliza,
better than anybody else in Newlife. I was as lonely as I am
here--only busier there."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"But I don't know that your diagnosis of me as a page with
nothing printed on it except dollar signs is so far wrong. I
think most of us are simply patterns of clothes and habits of
work and the same way of saying good morning, invariably.
'Mornin', mornin', mornin', well, how are you, this fine
beautiful morning!' Jesse screams, every day, rain, shine, or
snow, and then I feel so superior to him, but I'm no better. . .
. I just glare, and probably it's always the same glare. That
must be one of the great pleas of religion: that if a man hasn't
a precious soul behind all this unchanging blankness, then he's a
pretty shabby animal!</p>

<p>"I've always been busy; busy as a son, busy as a college brat.
My specialties then were tennis (gone rusty) and history
(forgotten) and draftsmanship (good). Afterwards I was busy as an
architect. And as the husband of my popular wife . . . I don't
know that I have any personality at all, really. (Not that you
have ever asked me about it!) Maybe I'll find a personality
here."</p>

<p>"I think you're probably hard on yourself, Mr. Chart."</p>

<p>"No. Let's face it--as people say when they want to be
unpleasant."</p>

<p>"But you seem to be unusually kind and fair--for a
<i>man!</i>"</p>

<p>"You don't like men much?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? From my university president, that
back-slapping, endowment-hounding old fraud, looking for generals
and judges to whom he can give honorary degrees in return for
publicity, from him or from the head of my department, that
dyspeptic old phonograph--and he thinks Cesare Borgia should have
been a Y.M.C.A. secretary--from them to the dumbest young man in
my classes--who's only a bit younger than me, really, and not as
good a dancer, but he says he hates being taught by a stringy old
maid like me--oh, the whole lot of males that I know best have
very successfully combined to keep me an apologetic schoolteacher
instead of a hard-boiled scholar who would slap down my academic
betters when they're my worse."</p>

<p>"But isn't there--isn't there something else, some resentment,
something personal . . ."</p>

<p>"We won't go into that!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Olivia--honestly. It was just the intrusion of a
lonely pilgrim who considers you splendid and somewhat
intimidating. You'll forgive me, Olivia? I'm so
harmless--disgustingly so!"</p>

<p>"It's all right. Let's forget it--Hayden."</p>

<p>"Okay. Olivia, do you plan to stay very long in Italy?"</p>

<p>"Just as long as I can manage it, by swindling or armed
robbery."</p>

<p>"What is your home--I mean, what do you think of as your home?
Zenith, like Mr. Dodsworth?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Where then? In America, I mean."</p>

<p>"Nowhere in America! My real home is anywhere, anywhere at
all, on the Continent of Europe--except maybe Russia; any place
where they drink wine instead of ice water and tomato juice, and
where they don't consider the World's Series and madam's new
vanity case the most exalted topic of conversation."</p>

<p>"So you're that famous scoundrel, the escapist, the
expatriate."</p>

<p>"Escape? Why not escape from a world of gas pumps and canned
soup to a world where 'the wind sets in with the autumn that
blows from the region of stories'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I still like Swinburne."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>He could but grin at her slight inflation, and something
resembling a smile warmed her face, like the sun after cold
dawning. She demanded, "You read poetry?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I used to. But there are men who do read it."</p>

<p>"Oh--<i>men!</i> Lumbering, lecherous, jocular animals! But
they don't smell clean, like the animals; they smell of pipes and
pork chops and onions and shaving cream. With their grimaces that
are supposed to delight a maiden's heart and that just give away
their itch for sly conquest. Men! My dear Mr. Chart! My innocent
Hayden!"</p>

<p>No. She was detestable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>7</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>No. She was little likely to be an intimate of his, he thought
as they finished dinner. He had that chilled feeling, familiar
even to so unflirtatious a man, of finding a pretty girl at a
party, finding her warm and fetching, then having her, for no
evident reason, turn into a stranger.</p>

<p>But he still admired Olivia's assured tautness and a moving
strength in her that was fantastically different from the
swishing excitements of an Art Appreciation Class. When he was
with her he felt that it would not be an effeminate hobby but
solid work for a man to stay here--for a while--and labor to
understand the strangely flowering beauty of the Middle Ages. He
would bathe in the magic and perilous waters of medieval history:
proud-colored, hot, heroic, vicious knights in armor that had
been decorated by voluptuous goldsmiths, dungeons and silent
convents, exiles on Venetian galleys standing east for Cyprus. He
was lost in an enchantment of which he did not understand even
the vocabulary.</p>

<p>If only he could be guided through this wizardry by Olivia,
whose hands lay still on the table, hands not thin and meanly
desirous but arrogant, ivory in every line carved to loveliness.
The hollow between her thumb and forefinger was a polished curve.
They were hands that could grasp and hold, and they excited him
even while he was talking prosily:</p>

<p>"If I stay here, I'd like to get a sort of permanent place
cheaper than the big hotels. Have you any ideas?"</p>

<p>"The <i>pensione</i> I'm living in, the Tre Corone, is all
right. The furniture is simple and the food is good and--this
interests a professional romanticist like myself--it occupies two
floors of one of the oldest Florentine houses, the Palazzo
Spizzi."</p>

<p>To invite him, or at least permit him, to be near to her, near
to her ivory hands, her lips that were dark-red in a lovely and
tragic ivory mask--that stirred him, till he reflected that she
was probably so indifferent to him that she did not care whether
he lived next door or in Novaya Zemlya.</p>

<p>Nor did she mention the <i>pensione</i> again, as they
finished dinner and tramped to the Spizzi. But next day he was
busily inspecting it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A palazzo in Italy signifies only a large house, usually of
stone, built a few hundred years ago for a very rich and very
noble family who became very rich and noble by conducting a war,
with a large cut in the pillage, or by lending money to popes and
kings and dukes who conducted wars. These houses are lordly,
rivaled today only by movie theaters. In Florence, the Palazzo
Spizzi, on the Lungarno not far from the Ponte Vecchio, is one of
the lordliest, with granite walls in rough rustica.</p>

<p>There are surly, prison-barred windows on the ground floor,
but on the four floors above, elegant Gothic windows with stone
tracery. Along the street are bronze torch-holders, and rings for
tethering the horses of knights dead these five hundred years,
with a long stone bench on which once lounged the armed servants
of the magnate, waiting for commands which might mean fun or
death, and probably both.</p>

<p>You go through an arched gateway into an arcaded central
court, with high-colored heraldic shields and one sacred fresco
on the smooth stone walls. The court and its little statues of
lyric fauns are dominated by a vast stone stairway. Here, the
Medici hurried, and the Pazzi, Bardi, Rucellai, Cavalcanti. One
of them, one day, walked in white carnival satin that suddenly,
here on this green-molded spot, became streakily variegated with
red, as the expert assassin from Forli slid in his dagger. And
over there, most briefly afterward, the assassin had his toes
lightly toasted before his head was jaggedly hacked off.</p>

<p>In this niche of crimson and gold and crocus-colored mosaic, a
Spizzi garroted his ardent bride. It is now a rented storage
space for bicycles.</p>

<p>Since 1550, even Florence has changed. Today, the doors along
the arcade give on the office of a Polish refugee specialist in
radiotherapy, a tearoom kept by an old English lady, an
embroidery shop kept by an even older Scotch lady, and a
ferocious left-wing book shop kept by two young Welsh ladies who
play piano duets and admire Jacob Epstein and drink nothing but
vodka and diuretic mineral water.</p>

<p>You pant up the stairs to the offices of machinery agents and
of buyers representing stores in Dallas, Montreal and Oslo. The
two floors above these constitute the Pensione Tre Corone, and up
to it climbed Hayden Chart. It was a racking ascension, but
Hayden felt strong and fresh, his accident healed over.</p>

<p>In a standard <i>pensione</i> hallway of green rep walls, a
reed chair and a mummied palm, a door painted with ferocious
roses was opened for him by an extremely handsome Italian young
man wearing the man-about-Florence standard uniform of wavy black
hair, cigarette, checkered brown-and-gray sports jacket and gray
slacks. Hayden did not at all care for the thought of this jazz
satyr living in the house with Olivia, and he was relieved at the
coming of Mrs. Manse, the manager.</p>

<p>She was a small, active Italian widow who had married a
Birmingham traveling salesman and lived for years in England. She
spoke English like an A.B.C. teashop waitress, a refined duchess,
a Cardiff coal miner and a Tuscan peasant, all at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we have a very nice room with a love-ely view of the
Duomo and the Santa Annunziata and Fiesole and <i>everything</i>
and a private bath--ooh, just like home. But you're not English,
are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm an American."</p>

<p>"Ow . . . Well, we quite like Americans here--the better
class. You are not married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But then, you're not the wild sort that would want to be
entertaining--uh--<i>people</i> in your room, and I'm sure you
will want full <i>pensione."</i></p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Both luncheon and dinner here daily. It's so much more
satisfactory, you know, to have your meals here, <i>all</i> of
them, and not go risking your digestion at these restaurants.
Res-tau-rants! And not knowing what you're getting and the
<i>pasta</i> stale and the veal tough and no pure Chianti, such
as we serve. Mrs. Engineer Purdy, one of our very oldest guests,
often says to me, 'Signora, I simply do not understand how you
can afford to serve such love-ely pure unmixed Chianti at the
shockingly low price we pay here!' And of course she
<i>knows!</i> So shall we say full <i>pensione?"</i></p>

<p>"No, I plan to take at least one meal a day out."</p>

<p>"It's a mistake, but of course I never even give advice to my
gentlemen but it's a mistake and quite hard on me, with such
love-ely clean rooms and serving such a variety of food and the
butter always fresh, at such shockingly low prices as you pay,
but shall we say half<i>-pensione</i> then?"</p>

<p>They would say that, yes, with luncheon taken here, Hayden
agreed, proud of being so businesslike in securing his first
Italian home and forgetting only to ask the amount of those
shockingly low prices. He was dazed by the Anglo-Italian verbal
hemorrhage and yet he felt secure. He had lived with Mrs. Manse,
under different names and accents, in Newlife, Amherst, Denver,
New York, London, and he knew that he would be cheated only the
correct proportion.</p>

<p>"And when you are not able to be here for <i>colazione,</i>
will you kindly let me know twenty-four hours beforehand? So many
gentlemen are thoughtless about that," said Mrs. Manse.</p>

<p>She introduced him to a bedroom, smallish, square, with blank
plaster walls, which yet delighted him, for the one window was
Gothic-pointed and the ceiling was groined. It had surely been
part of some greater salon in the early palace, or perhaps of a
chapel, and the clean bareness of it was proper for the studious
monk he meant to become.</p>

<p>The varnished yellow pine bed was narrow, not bad; there was a
large white wardrobe for clothes, a large white table for the
notes on Italian history that he would certainly be making and
for the profound books that he would certainly buy and possibly
even read.</p>

<p>There was a hideous but comfortable yellow-velvet armchair
with a fiddle-shaped back, a straight chair, a pinched radiator,
and a composition stone floor, with a rug beside the bed. . . .
But he looked unsuccessfully for his dancing girl in the rug.</p>

<p>The bathroom was little larger than the ancient tub, but it
was adequate, and even contained articles which seemed to Hayden
somewhat perplexing and certainly of great superfluousness. One
of these was a bootjack. He had ridden horses in the Berkshire
Hills, on dude ranches, on the cheery camping journeys through
the Rockies on which Caprice had been both at her most
complaining and her most recklessly gay, but he did not think it
likely that he would ride a Western pony up to the Palazzo Spizzi
and tether it to one of the great bronze rings below.</p>

<p>The place seemed to him almost voluptuous when Mrs. Manse
explained that only one bedroom in three at the Tre Corone had
its private bath.</p>

<p>What starred his room and filled it with light and stimulation
for the daytime was the window and the vista of towers and
fourteenth-century battlements and, down below, the humbler roofs
of tiles, cherry-colored, soft rose, violent crimson or pale
orange, above yellow-plaster walls. A top-floor tenement down
there--it was, he learned afterwards, above a ground-floor
leather shop full of gold-tooled purses and small jewel
boxes--had an open loggia and a terrace with geraniums and with
goldfinches in cages, and a broad-sterned woman was hanging out a
hot red shirt to dry. He would be seeing real Florentines, and
not just palace walls, spacious but decaying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manse, that unlaureated mistress of psychology, knew that
he would take this room. She knew! When he did, at last, remember
to confer delicately about the price, he was so under the spell
that she overcharged him grossly: she charged him at least
one-half as much as such a cell would have cost in America.</p>

<p>He did not quite dare to ask how near to his own door was that
of Dr. Olivia Lomond. He found later that it was eight from his,
round a corner of the matting-covered stone corridor.</p>

<p>All this was on the upper floor of the <i>pensione.</i> On the
floor below were still more bedrooms--there were twenty-eight in
all--with the office, the dining room, the lounge. The dining
room was simple and white and cheerful, with white-clothed tables
for one or two or four, each of them with coquettish napkin rings
and a tight bouquet of asters and, usually, a Chianti bottle. The
serving-table--the <i>credenza</i>--had once been an
over-gorgeous drawing-room table of marquetry with gilded metal
edges.</p>

<p>The lounge must have been a great salon of the ferocious and
devoutly pious Spizzi family: lofty, vaulted, cold. Around
somewhat dreary damask-covered tables, displaying Italian
motoring magazines, were modern chairs artfully but unhappily
devised of twisted red-stained wood, or aged refugee chairs from
destroyed parlors, resembling indigent gentlewomen. There was a
case of novels and travel books which fleeing guests had
intelligently left behind: a French guidebook to Sicily dated
1899 and such romances as <i>Lively Lassie o' London Town,</i> by
Mrs. Beth Levinson Knibbs-Crochet.</p>

<p>In this clean shabbiness you could rest familiarly enough, and
the lounge windows looked down on the Ponte Vecchio, that
venerable bridge of shops devoted now to sellers of artificial
pearls and not to Donati defending the crossing with loud
swords.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, with small trunk and ill-assorted bags
and a hastily purchased new blue-silk cravat, Hayden moved into
his cell at the Tre Corone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He met his floor maid, Perpetua, a smiling, black-eyed,
powerful woman of fifty, only just slightly felonious, who would
also be his waitress, valet, chamberlain, social arbiter, and
chief professor in the Italian tongue: a low-built peasant in
black dress and white apron who seemed to be on duty from five
A.M. to midnight.</p>

<p>Shyly, not knowing how he should dress, he went down to his
first dinner, at eight, to <i>risotto</i> and boiled beef, and
met most of the Tre Corone guests. They too were in lounge
clothes. In treachery to all tradition, there was no retired
British colonel with lady, nor even a British major or vicar.</p>

<p>He encountered, instead, a Hungarian widow of fifty and her
daughter, highly polylingual and undevoted to Bolsheviks, a
round-faced American graduate student who listened to and
sometimes understood lectures on Italian art at the university,
an out-of-favor Italian ex-diplomat, a Dutch baron devoted to
cameos, to Americans and other novelties, an Italian lawyer with
three daughters, a soured French silk-buyer, and an
Italo-American agent for documentary films, who wanted to discuss
trout-fishing in Maine with Hayden.</p>

<p>Dr. Lomond--Olivia--sat by herself at a small table and read
the air-mail continental <i>Time.</i> She looked at Hayden twice
before she remembered him (that is what she thought he would
think) and she nodded and said nothing and went back to reading
about Congressman Marcantonio, the latest biography of Susan B.
Anthony, murder by a balding man late at night in a rubber-boot
warehouse, revolution in the Celebes, the mortality rate in
successor-disease affecting former confidants of Stalin,
chemobiologimicrophotography in the University of Leyden, and the
other brighter topics of the day. Olivia's compressed lips were
hidden from him by the <i>Time</i> cover, portraying, in color, a
fabulous chain-store organizer, with a background of prunes,
motorcycles, cash registers and bathing caps, and instead of
Olivia's glass-smooth cheeks or hostile, inquiring eyes, Hayden
studied only his plate of saffron-yellow rice.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>8</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Out of his plastered cell, Hayden made a cluttered and
familiar home. It was, possibly, the first home he had ever had.
In boyhood, "home" had been aggressively his father's house, and
in his marriage, their three successive houses had been saturated
with Caprice and her clamorous friends.</p>

<p>In a second-hand shop he bought a couple of low tables, a
small rosy armchair and a shaky set of bookshelves that had been
used for bottles. At Alinari's he got color prints of the
<i>Primavera</i> and Angelico's <i>Great Crucifixion</i> and the
fairyland of Benozzo Gozzoli's gold and crimson courtier
pilgrims.</p>

<p>In the book shops he went on a spree. He bought histories of
Florence in English, English-Italian grammars and dictionaries, a
Cambridge history of the Renaissance, and in Italian he had books
which he certainly would not be able to tackle for two years:
Dante and Petrarch, Manzoni's classic <i>I</i> <i>Promessi
Sposi,</i> which is written in hedgerows and not in lines,
Machiavelli's <i>Prince,</i> and a volume of Giovanni Villani's
Florentine history--a brand-new edition, dated 1650.</p>

<p>He had, in fact, all of a university except the yell and the
bursar's office.</p>

<p>His exploration of Florence, begun immediately, was not
altogether that of the enraptured and credulous tourist, for
Hayden Chart was an architect, a good one, not unlearned, and he
saw the purposes of arches and buttresses; his eye picked up
ornamental iron balconies and in apparent mere gaps between
buildings he detected minute streets leading to some lost square
with a little church, an old, very old, very holy church
sheltering the tomb of a spacious Platonist who in 1492 was
discovering the old world as dangerously as Columbus was finding
the new.</p>

<p>He went graspingly at learning Italian, a tongue reputed among
the untutored to be all melody and tra-la-la's and mobile dames
and ice-cream cries, but actually so thorny with perverse
irregular verbs and pronouns that have more exceptions than rules
and suffixes meaning Big, Pretty Big, Very Big, Enormously Big,
Little, Delightfully Little, Nasty, or Perfectly Horrible that
most tenderfoot students give it up, moaning, after learning how
to make love and order a meal.</p>

<p>He looked into the official Italian Language course at the
University, but it was all in Italian from the first, too much
for the halting brain of thirty-five. He tried a School of
Languages, but he did not feel stimulated by his fellow-students:
Anglo-American women who, after housekeeping in Florence for a
decade, had decided that it was time to find out what they had
really been eating all these years, or English businessmen who
wanted to sell British machinery, or the aunts of American
European Relief Program officials, all of whom interrupted the
lessons to explain what they thought about Italy, with an urgency
which indicated that they believed the natives, from dope-runners
to the President, were pantingly waiting for their verdicts.</p>

<p>Hayden found, through Mrs. Dodsworth, a Signora Pendola, an
oldish fat widow with an umbrella and elastic-sided shoes,
afflicted with bronchitis and sadness of the heart, tired, so
poor and tired, but a patient teacher, with a voice like Eleonora
Duse. Hayden was fond of her and treated her as though she were
his mother. Before each lesson, down in the salon, he had the
waiter bring the Signora a cup of tea, and she announced that he
was the kindest American since that born Yankee hustler, Julius
Caesar.</p>

<p>Along with her instruction, he daily studied his book of
grammar, but this seemed to be another Italian. Rarely did any of
the words which he painfully drilled into himself from the
printed lists slip over into normal conversation.</p>

<p>As he learned each phrase from the Signora, Hayden tried it
out on the maid, Perpetua, who, being Italian and generous, did
not find it funny when he meant to ask her to sew on a button,
but gravely made it, "By favor, I pray of cook those stick on my
shirtmakeress." He tried his new words in shops, in small
restaurants. The friendly Florentines were pleased that the
stranger should want to know their tongue, and he began to love
the gently grave men, the flexibly moving women.</p>

<p>He had thought, at first, that the Italian women had noses too
long--from the nasal standard of American magazine-cover
girls--but presently he was convinced that these <i>almost</i>
long noses were part of a medieval grace and long flying lines
that ought to be seen not in the chopped-off smart New York
styles which prosperous Italian women wear today, but in a
fluency of trailing silk, soft green trimmed with silver and rare
furs. He noted with comfort that Olivia Lomond's nose was one
one-hundredth of an inch longer than the severe Colorado norm,
and he felt that if he should ever see Roxanna Eldritch's pert
snub nose again he would consider it truncated and vulgar.</p>

<p>As rudely as though he were flagrantly picking her up at a
railroad station, he tackled Olivia at her icy island table and
insisted that she go on a walk with him. She consented
indifferently, and as they tramped together, squeezed close by
the exigency of a two-man-wide alley, they still seemed as far
apart as at the <i>pensione.</i> He worked hard then, as young
men of thirty-five or eighty-five do, to convince her that he was
a devilish clever fellow. She might know all about the bellicose
families who once had fought from these rough towers, but he
could tell her what foundation a tower must have and how much it
tapered and what the square holes in the walls were for.</p>

<p>She came to treat him as being almost as decent and capable a
human being as Perpetua. She did not mock him--much.</p>

<p>With Olivia or by himself he looked at the great churches--Or
San Michele, Miniato, Santa Croce, Maria Novella, San Marco, the
Battistero--and at the galleries till he understood how a Giotto
differed from a Spinello Aretino. He began, a little, to follow
the symbolism whereby a pictured saint portrayed both the saint
and a Medici, and a red star marked St. Dominic; to see that a
picture in which the misdrawn toes were as long as fingers and
the children were only dwarf grown-ups could yet in the whole
composition hold ecstasy and delight.</p>

<p>But he also discovered that the one place colder than his own
room at two A. M. was any Italian church, north of Naples, at ten
A. M. on a February day. The rosiest Madonna looked blue-frozen
as the malicious air crept up from a crypt that had grown colder,
winter by winter, for centuries. He admired the fortitude of the
Italians: beardster and babies cheerful at Mass while he fled
outdoors to get warm.</p>

<p>And he found the smoochers--he worked out the Doctrine of
Smoochers.</p>

<p><i>Smoochers</i>--the word was Hayden's own; first blooming of
his Florentine poetic revelations--are those shaggy and lumbering
men who in a church or a ruined palace or a public square pop out
of a vacuum, guides and sextons and loafers and plain
floor-sweepers, who with hazy but persistent firmness wreck and
ruin and shatter the still raptness in which you have been
contemplating a facade or, say, a Ghirlandaio by telling you
that, remarkably enough, it <i>is</i> a church or a Ghirlandaio.
You knew it already. That is why you went there.</p>

<p>The English spoken by smoochers lacks not only verbs but
adjectives and they good-naturedly date Simone Martini as
anywhere from 1140 to 1760. But if you are sorry for them as
being needy, you can usually persuade them to let you alone by
instantly insulting them with a fifty-lire note.</p>

<p>Subdivisions of the smoochers, indoors and out, include
insistent post-card sellers, sellers of bead necklaces and of
fountain pens, and would-be changers of dollar bills.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the great churches, he thought often of how Jesse Bradbin
would have snorted, "But what's the <i>practical</i> use of all
this old art?" And in imaginary answer he insisted that it seemed
to him improbable that one who had much contemplated Or San
Michele or a Botticelli would willingly allow himself or any one
else to become just a file number in a bureaucracy such as Russia
now is and America and Great Britain threaten to be.</p>

<p>Along with the English Cemetery, where rests Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, and such little-altered medieval quarters as the toy
Piazzetta Elisabetta, he paid suit to modern Florence: to some
dozen restaurants, to shops for silver and china and lace and
gold-embossed leather, and to the county-family pleasantness of
the Anglo-American Pharmacy, and he studied the tribal rites of
the resident Americans at Doney's and Leland's, the tearoom bars,
to which go equally the more dependable drunks and the crisp
American girls being finished off in finishing schools, who
believe that to see Inside Italy means to go downtown and have
pastry with whipped cream.</p>

<p>The American Colony is divided into three parts: those who
have their cocktails at Leland's or Doney's, a small sect who
have them at home, either with firelight and old silver and a
butler and many guests or, by the good tradition of Bohemian
poverty, with boxes to sit on round the kitchen stove and the
drinks mixed in a broken-nosed pitcher, and the third part, a
tiny and suspect group, which does not have cocktails.</p>

<p>Hayden himself--he had daily only an Americano, that mixture
of vermouth and kindness of which no American ever hears till he
comes to Italy.</p>

<p>A Florentine might have pointed out to Hayden that in defining
a city of palaces and paintings and bars, he was missing
nine-tenths of the living community: a post-war world of workers
jobless or anxious in hospitals, small officials with meat once a
month and wine at Christmas, repressed but angry citizens hating
the well-fed foreigners who came brightly to gloat over a Filippo
Lippi Madonna and never learned that a descendant of Filippo was
hauling garbage. But Hayden understood all of this. Even in new
Newlife he had built tenements. He was more moved by poverty
among American students here.</p>

<p>He met American girl students whose life here was a storm of
frustration, between a passion to stay in Florence and
apprehension that it would keep them from going on to see the
rest of Italy--Rome, Milan, Turin; a passion to remain in Italy
and fear that they were becoming unfitted for the ways, the
friends, back home. Half their anxieties, thought Hayden, would
be soothed if they only had enough money to move flexibly, and he
a little despised such burghers as himself and the Dodsworths,
who were so amiably and pointlessly advisory to the shabby
students.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The most exhilarating part of his new life was in his quiet
room at the Tre Corone, finding himself.</p>

<p>It was a secret life, a life that he hugged to him. In
studious solitude he saw winter pass like blown smoke. Half the
night he sat up trying to read medieval history in the Italian of
Villani, of Guicciardini, and meditating upon the meaning, to
himself and to his day, of that world of authority, ceremony,
color, and enchanting but just slightly cockeyed fables. To rest
his eyes he had, on his portable radio, Mozart from Milan.</p>

<p>He read on nightly, till he felt uncomfortable and was
dismayed to find that his room was slush-cold. The Florentine
winter lasts only from mid-December to March, and in that season
there are luminous days, but there are also jeeringly cold nights
and days together when the <i>tramontana</i> wind comes
devastatingly down from the Alps three pinched days at a spell,
blowing pitilessly, playing rowdy with the tiles and shutters,
chasing the night policemen down the streets and into
bicycle-storage alcoves, marching through Hayden's
northward-facing window as though it were a paper screen.</p>

<p>In the <i>tramontana's</i> shriek of an ice-tortured fiend,
Hayden thought he could catch a stated tune: rising, rising,
rising to a scream, a sullen sinking down again, and rising,
rising.</p>

<p>By day, he could see the olive tree on a terrace below him
turn altogether silver, with its sheet of leaves so lifted by the
gale that he saw only the undersides, while a cypress tree bent
over in twisting pain. The tempest seemed worst during the fits
of grudging sunshine when, afar, he could see the aloof and
whitened peaks of the Pistoia Mountains coldly leering at this
uncouth stranger who once had talked of "sunny Italy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Manse let her radiators go cold before midnight, and at
one in the morning the cold in Hayden's room seemed visible, a
part of the pallid walls and glistening stone floor. Cold was in
his eyeballs, in his chest, and his breath was coldly vaporous.
He understood why beggars, hopeless at night on winter doorsteps,
crouched themselves together.</p>

<p>He had had words with Mrs. Manse about an electric heater, and
had bought one for himself: a good little Italian electric stove
composed of two sheets of glass with wires between. It glowed
obedience to its scholar-master, but it could not do much more
than keep itself warm and, impatiently determined to go on
reading, Hayden huddled his overcoat and scarf over his woolen
dressing-gown and, to crown this costume of a lone miser, he put
on his polite brown hat.</p>

<p>His immensest luxury was a cup-size Italian aluminum stove
with sticks of Meta compound for fuel, and pulverized instant
coffee. Nearly warmed by his coffee, he thought of what he had
been reading: Lodovico il Moro, taking his nephew's throne in
Milan, playing gaudy host and patron to religious painters and
dying a flea-tortured prisoner in France. . . . Pico della
Mirandola, fairest and most febrile youth of the Renaissance,
learning Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, challenging the College of
Cardinals, and dying at thirty-one, to be buried over here in the
cold gloom of San Marco.</p>

<p>It was all magic. With pleasant recognition he found himself
and his vigils in <i>Il</i> <i>Penseroso</i> when he picked up
some English poetry on a book barrow on the Piazza D'Avanzati.
The night-bewitched scholar, timeless and immortal, from a
Colorado boomtown of 1950 or from the Florence of 1490, Hayden or
Count Pico, all of them in all their shabby majesty he found as
he read Milton's "lamp at midnight hour, seen in some high lonely
tower," where the hermit sought "forests and enchantments drear,
where more is meant than meets the ear."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodsworth examined him, woman-wise, when he went to the
Villa Canterbury to play bridge.</p>

<p>"Have you got yourself a girl yet?"</p>

<p>"None in sight."</p>

<p>"What about Miss Lomond--this <i>professoressa?"</i></p>

<p>"She'd be interested only in Professor Santayana."</p>

<p>"What do you do with yourself? You can't spend all your time
sightseeing."</p>

<p>"I tinker with Italian maps--try to find the best route to
forests and enchantments drear."</p>

<p>"You're very young, Hayden--pleasantly so."</p>

<p><i>"Or</i> very old, and repentant of a wasted life in which
the only poetry I ever learned was 'Yes, we have no bananas.' I
think I ought to tell the press services to send out a story that
a man can read poetry without getting kicked out of the Athletic
Club."</p>

<p>"I doubt that! I've been in Zenith!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>With the other guests--but privately he thought of them as
"the boarders"--at the Tre Corone, he had after-dinner coffee,
and they all asked "Have you seen the Bargello?" He went to Nat
Friar's again and found him reading an Eric Ambler thriller. Nat
said he was rather off Great Books, since the University of
Chicago had taken a lease on them and was now sponsoring Great
Books for Juveniles 7-11, Great Book neckties and Great Book Bran
Brainfood for Breakfast.</p>

<p>And he had a night-club evening with Vito Zenzero, the
wavy-black-haired dancing man, nephew of Mrs. Manse, who was the
<i>pensione's</i> desk-clerk, head waiter and entertainer of
spinsters. Vito spoke energetic English, learned from the less
refined members of the American Expeditionary Forces, and he took
Hayden to a hot spot in a thick-walled basement under an old
palace. Hayden had noted that Olivia was blank to Vito when,
looking like the best of B films in his yellow-green jacket and
brown slacks, he teetered and tittered about the dining room,
encouraging the guests to buy Frascati wines.</p>

<p>"Why are you so cranky? Poor Vito, he flowers in the
sunshine." Hayden desired to know of Olivia.</p>

<p>"Poor Vito flowers in manure! He sells black-market cigarettes
and gets a commission on all the guests whom he coaxes to take
him to night clubs. . . ."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>". . . and he's seduced every girl in this district."</p>

<p>"That's what I said. He's a real medieval character. You like
them only in books, Olivia. If you'd been in Italy in 1400, you'd
have fled to Ireland and a nunnery."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh!" she said, not very convincingly.</p>

<p>This evening, Hayden had, without any noticeable invitation,
firmly sat down at her table for coffee. Her manner toward him
still had the persistent grayness of a <i>tramontana,</i> and
this admirably strong-willed woman was apparently able to keep it
up forever. More with a collector's curiosity than with any
sympathy she asked, "What are you 'studying' now, Hayden?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get into Dante, with a trot."</p>

<p>"You really are naive!"</p>

<p>"It's you that are naive, in not understanding that I'm having
an adventure. For me it's as novel to try to wallow through Dante
as it would be for you to plan a modern low-price bathroom with
compartments--plastic and stainless steel--green and silver."</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't <i>care</i> to plan a green bathroom--with
compartments--nor to use one, either!"</p>

<p>He thought about slapping her. He told himself that, with this
conceited grind, there was no merit in even a boarding-house
courtesy. He left her gruffly, and it was an astonishment to him,
a week later, when she invited him to take her to the Camillo for
dinner.</p>

<p>That brisk restaurant, across the river in the Oltrarno
quarter, on the Borgo San Jacopo with its ancient walls, is a
favorite of the scores of American students in Florence, and of
students German, French, Swedish, Burmese. A few of them had
learned Italian and had actually met an Italian, but most of them
were as innocently detached from the local life as were their
financial betters, the Colonists. They met nightly in zealously
argumentative groups devoted to the prose of Henry Miller and the
pastoral delights of Marxism, while they let down their
<i>fettuccine</i> noodles and drank carafes of <i>vino rosso
sciolto.</i></p>

<p>At most Florentine restaurants, eight o'clock is a charming
hour in the early dawn, but at the Camillo every table is full by
a quarter to eight, and by eight-fifteen, Picasso and
Existentialism have already been mentioned, which means another
regrettable night up till two-thirty, at Danny's or Rachel's
"studio," and the head like a tornado in the morning and the
Sforzas not yet studied.</p>

<p>Olivia had always the art of making Hayden feel wizened and
uncertain, but she had never been so authoritative as at the
Camillo, where all the students recognized her, perhaps feared
her a little, and called her "Doctor" or "Professor." They wanted
to know what she thought of the Delia Robbias, and she told them.
. . . And with considerable comfort Hayden perceived that she had
the three Robbias all mixed up, and that both she and the
convivial students supposed that because she knew the legal and
political history of the fifteenth century, she must be a sound
taster of its art.</p>

<p>Her insufficiency did not keep her from being confident or the
students from noting down what she said, to be repeated for
decades afterward to the unfortunate future students of these
students, in far-flung crepuscular colleges on the plains or in
the hills--colleges where "far-flung" is considered a novel and
forceful adjective.</p>

<p>When he had been permitted to take Olivia home, even that
friendly pup Hayden had had enough, and he did not speak to her
again for a week. Then, shatteringly, came the embarrassment in
the hall.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>9</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Hayden, in respectable hat and brown topcoat, had respectably
come in from seeing an American film and he was thinking how odd
it was to hear an actor from Ohio making love with Neapolitan
ardor. He was whistling softly and unaware, and he stopped with a
jar as he came full on Olivia, a negligee lacy about her breast,
carrying under her silk-draped arm the intimacies of sponge-bag,
soap, towel, fresh nightgown.</p>

<p>She was astonishingly embarrassed about it. She trembled a
little as she quavered, "Have to use bathroom down here--somebody
in the other one that I often use--I <i>do</i> have a private
bath but it's out of order. <i>Really</i> not accustomed to
parading naked in the hall! I--oh, excuse me--Mr. Chart!"</p>

<p>He attacked: "What's the trouble? What bothers you so about
the nearness of a male lout? Why are you so sufferingly virginal,
Olivia?"</p>

<p>"I am not!" But she was deep-flushed, and panting.</p>

<p>"You're abnormally so!"</p>

<p>"That's silly! I'm not. . . . Oh, I suppose I do get
startled-faunish, leading such a cloistral life here."</p>

<p>The superior Dr. Lomond was defenseless. He felt brutal and
bad-mannered, but she had been so stonily lofty on their evening
at the Camillo that he was not particularly kind. And in soft
oriental silk she was interesting--at least.</p>

<p>"Olivia, my dear, you often give me good advice about not
being an amateur scholar. I can't resist advising you to taste a
little more salty life. Come out to a night club with me. Dance.
Even laugh a little. Don't be an amateur saint!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I--well, I must get on with . . ."</p>

<p>Down the hall they heard the door of Bathroom 2 closing and
the running of water. He laughed. "Cut off on all sides! Forest
fire back of us, mountain lions in front! Come sit in my room
till that swine there has finished his dip. . . . It will be
perfectly proper. I'll leave my door open. Don't be scared."</p>

<p>"I could not conceivably be scared by you or anybody else!"
But the hot flash of blood under her Syrian skin had faded to a
rare paleness, and her voice was uneven. "I think I'd better wait
in my own room, though, thank you."</p>

<p>Her look had such appeal as he would never have expected from
her--appealing, a girl, a woman--and she begged, "Please! It's
kind of you, but I think Mrs. Manse still tries to convince us
she's a born Lancashire woman, with all the proprieties, and she
might not care for our dormitory chat."</p>

<p>"Good night, my dear. Sorry the enemy captured all the baths.
Goodnight!"</p>

<p>He sat thinking that she was as feminine, in a betraying
cloudiness of silk, as Caprice had been; as much the forest nymph
white in the woodland twilight. But there was something wrong;
some nameless injury that she had taken. He was sorry for the
lofty Dr. Lomond, and with his pity came fondness for her.</p>

<p>Next evening, at dinner, she looked at him with a trace of
intimacy, of pleading, yet by after-dinner-coffee time she was as
self-sufficient as ever, and she was noticeably rude to his
friend Vito Zenzero when Vito came pussycatting around to ask,
Had the <i>professoressa</i> enjoyed the beautiful
artichokes?</p>

<p>Nothing seemed to have happened, nothing did happen, and
Hayden was again drawn into a hobo life in the jungles of the
American Colony, trying to find out how innocent these Innocents
Abroad were, and why they were abroad at all.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He saw less of the American students or the Italo-American
businessmen than of the golden loafers of the Colony, the
Dodsworth set with their Louis Seize cabinets and chauffeurs and
hospitality to poor Colonists who were pitiful martyrs in not
having chauffeurs.</p>

<p>Many of these Colonists were content, month on month, to go to
cocktail parties with amiable friends, to play a little bridge,
to dine out, to read the latest books sent over from Home, to
look once a month at a gallery or a church and, all in all,
unknowing all, do nothing but wait for death. Hayden was not
going to wait for death. He had, and not long since, been through
most of its agonies, and he was going to use every energy and
inspired curiosity in him to keep himself consciously living, to
find and cherish life in his new career, in a dozen new
careers.</p>

<p>He believed that Americans could do that, as the Founding
Fathers had. In even the most languid and habitual of the
Florentine Colonists, in even the most fluttering pansy, he
discerned American ore.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry James was breathless over the spectacle of Americans
living abroad and how very queer they are, in English country
houses or Tuscan villas or flats in Rome, and how touchy they
become as they contemplate the correctness of Europeans.</p>

<p>But just how queer they are, Mr. James never knew. He never
saw a radio reporter, never talked to an American Oil Company
proconsul gossiping in the Via Veneto about his native Texas.
Americans are electric with curiosity, and this curiosity has
misled foreigners and Mr. James into crediting them with a
provincial reverence which they do not possess; a reverence which
their ancestors got rid of along with their native costumes, one
month after Ellis Island or after Plymouth Rock.</p>

<p>If a queen comes to America, crowds fill the station squares,
and attendant British journalists rejoice, "You see: the American
Cousins are as respectful to Royalty as we are."</p>

<p>But the Americans have read of queens since babyhood. They
want to see one queen, once, and if another came to town next
week, with twice as handsome a crown, she would not draw more
than two small boys and an Anglophile.</p>

<p>Americans want to see one movie star, one giraffe, one jet
plane, one murder, but only one. They run up a skyscraper or the
fame of generals and evangelists and playwrights in one week and
tear them all down in an hour, and the mark of excellence
everywhere is "under new management."</p>

<p>Nor are they so different when they are expatriates. After
years of Europe, Sam Dodsworth was unalterably midwestern in his
quick humorous glance, his scorn for social climbers, his
monotonous voice, his liking for dry cereals, his belief that if
he met a stranger and took to him, they were friends from that
hour. He had the result of the annual Yale-Princeton football
game cabled to him, and he amused his more Italianized wife by
sometimes addressing a countess as "Missus."</p>

<p>And the much-younger Hayden Chart, listening to the music of
ancient zithers in yellow-spotted books, planning to go on to the
Spice Islands and the red-enameled gates of China, was yet
cynically hard about female compatriots who were too gushingly
reverent toward gray eminences or gray towers. Like Dodsworth, he
thought well of American hospitals and streamlined trains and the
reluctance of Democrats to behead all Republicans.</p>

<p>Mr. James's simple miss has become the young lady at the Ritz
Bar, and his young American suitor, apologetic for having been
reared in the rustic innocence of Harvard instead of the
Byzantine courtliness of a bed-sitting-room at Oxford, has been
replaced by the American flying major who in Africa, Arabia,
China, Paris is used to being courted as the new Milord.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hayden found that the Florentine American Colony considered
itself a community sufficient and significant. The Colonists who
had been here for forty years looked down on the settlers of ten
years standing who looked down on the one-year squatters who
looked down on the newcomers of one month who were extremely
lofty and informative with the one-week horrors. Altogether, the
Colony made up one-tenth of one per cent of the population of
Florence.</p>

<p>And the claims of none of these reversed patriots so much
interested Hayden as his own secret life.</p>

<p>As an Italian gentleman of Hayden's age might develop a quite
new personality among the ranches and mines of Colorado, so
Hayden was developing a new personality in an equally perilous
Italian world of disjunctive pronouns, Gothic triforiums, and the
mystery of Olivia down the hall. As the mercenary Colleoni once
attacked the fortress of a girl's heart, so Hayden attacked the
history of Colleoni and all that insane medieval jumble of wars
and dynasties.</p>

<p>He loved this Italy precisely because it was strange to him.
In his restricted cell of a bedroom here he had but little of an
exile's longing for the luxury and space of his house in Newlife;
for the chaise longue and the shelves of detective stories and
the heated garage, and the breakfast table, of glass and flowery
ironwork, on the sunporch. They were overbalanced by Florence and
its memory of banners and slow deep bells, of towers and swords
and torture.</p>

<p>He believed that he could go beyond the futility of merely
piling up historical timber. It was easy enough for even a
guidebook-tripper to learn a catalogue of the names of painters
and battles, but Hayden wanted out of his scant erudition to make
a solid structure to rest in, to make a signboard that would
point out on what road mankind had marched.</p>

<p>With Henry Adams, he tried to see the same ornament and
soaring ambition in Gothic cathedrals and Gothic hymns, the same
grace and light in Renaissance palaces and villas and sculpture
and song. He sought the relationship of all his new visions to
his own profession.</p>

<p>In Florence, his favorite Newlife brick Georgian houses, with
delicate fanlights and wide windows which promised welcome and
wreaths and Christmas candles (but strictly with movable
partitions and oil-heating and insulated roofs!), still seemed
fitting and dear, though he did not want them in Italy. And
equally from the integrity of old stone walls and from Roman
classic columns he was refreshed in his belief that in no time or
land have there been more imperially beautiful buildings than the
towers of Rockefeller Center, in New York.</p>

<p>In Newlife he had needed some unfamiliarity, some strangeness,
and had needed conversation that should not always be in the same
platitudes, so that from the first two words he could predict
everything else that the oracle was about to thunder. How great
those needs had been he knew when he was called to the
<i>pensione</i> office to answer the telephone, and heard a heavy
American masculine chuckle:</p>

<p>"I'll bet you'll never in the world guess who this is!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I can't."</p>

<p>"Well, try and make a guess now."</p>

<p>"It isn't Mr. Dodsworth?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no no! I ought to needle you a little and punish you
for forgetting your old friends so easy, but I'll put you out of
your misery. It's Bill Windelbank, from Home!"</p>

<p>It was indeed that excellent and intellectual dentist who, as
much as Roxanna Eldritch, had summoned him to the asphodels of
Europe. But Hayden thought, and was ashamed to be caught thinking
it, that he did not desire to see Dr. William Windelbank at all,
nor his nimble lady. Would he have to introduce them to Olivia,
to Nat Friar, to the Dodsworths?</p>

<p>He disliked his own snobbishness and disloyalty, but he did
not think he could ever stand hearing the Windelbanks explain to
Sir Henry Belfont, self-importantly and in detail, how barbaric
Italy was in not serving flapjacks and doughnuts, and insisting
upon giving Belfont's <i>cordon bleu</i> the recipes. Or
jocularly saying to Nat Friar, "Prof, I hope you folks here don't
let Hay put it over on you about what a highbrow he is. Home, he
just reads the comic strips and goes to bed at nine-thirty like
the rest of us, but he always was a great guy for trying to show
off and make like a deep reader--don't you now, Hay?"</p>

<p>But Hayden was cordial.</p>

<p>"Well! Thought Jean and you were only going to stay abroad for
five weeks, and here it must be over four months. Golly!"</p>

<p>One magic touch of Home and he was already back in its
good-fellowship, its sterling virtues and its lack of
vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Yes-sir-ee, it certainly is!" boasted Windelbank. "Four
months, seventeen days and nine and a half hours since we sailed
from little ole New York! But right off the bat, we started
seeing so doggone much and we like it, and I said to Jean, 'We
only live once, and the food is a lot better and tastier in
Europe than we expected, and we'll never come back here--too many
more important points of interest to cover, like Brazil and Nova
Scotia. So,' I said, 'let's go hog-wild and have four-five months
here.'</p>

<p>"But now we've had enough--plenty. The food may be delicious,
but it don't stay by you and nourish the maxillary blood supply
like a good Colorado beefsteak. So we're finishing up the tower
with two days in Florence and three in Rome, just like we
originally planned. We did our two days in Venice, but don't
think too much of it: real picturesque, but awful rundown and
shabby. Where we've put in most of our time was Scandinavia and a
lovely little lake resort we found in Northern England--just like
home. And now--only two days here, Hay! What do we do?"</p>

<p>In terror Hayden perceived that he was expected to spend all
of those two days with the Windelbanks, providing meals,
transportation, interpretage, and learned artistic guidance,
answering rapidly and with apparent accuracy all questions about
the weight of the Duomo cupola, the biographies, with dates, of
all the more important inhabitants of all tombs in all churches,
and the number of members in all political parties in
Tuscany.</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" he rebuked himself. "They'd do the same for
me, even if--especially if!--I didn't want them to!"</p>

<p>Anyway, they were too kind and loyal for him to think of
dodging them, and he trumpeted, "How about my picking you up and
taking you to dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>"Well now, that's real nice of you. Be glad to. Jean--you know
how finicking and suspicious women are--she said, 'Maybe Hay's
gone and gotten in with a lot of snobs here and won't care to see
plain folks like us,' but I says to her, 'Not on your life! I
know Hay's character like I know his bicuspids! He may talk fancy
and highfalutin, but at heart he'll always be just a plain,
back-slappin' Western boy, like all the rest of us!'"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As punishment for his sin of alienation, Hayden found, at
dinner, that Dr. Windelbank had noticed many things that he, in
the same islands of bliss, had never marked: the routes of the
Paris Metro, the wages of bellboys in Belgium, the horsepower of
London taxicabs. The doctor was buoyant about his discoveries; he
made Hayden feel aged and juiceless, as Sam Dodsworth made him
feel credulous and boisterous and infantile.</p>

<p>Dinner was comfortable--and Jean Windelbank's new gray dinner
dress was excellent. Hayden was surprised to find with what
excitement he learned from the Windelbanks, who had assiduously
corresponded with everybody back home, the more salient items of
news: that Mary Eliza Bradbin's new upper plate took all the
wrinkles away from around her mouth, that Dr. Crittenham had
bought a "new Chevvy, a swell two-tone-color job," that Bobby
Tregusis, the nephew of Chan Millward's first wife's first
husband, had a lovely job with the Cripple Creek telephone
company.</p>

<p>And in Paris the Windelbanks had seen Roxanna Eldritch.</p>

<p>"I phoned her--she couldn't guess who it was, at first, but
then she was real glad to hear my voice--I'll bet she was; kid
like that so far away from home among these queer foreigners and
all these moral pitfalls. She bought us a real nice dinner at a
real Parisian restaurant that all these tourists and all never
get to hear about--kidneys, their specialty was. Personally, I
never did care too much for kidneys at home, but the way they did
them there, they was real nice.</p>

<p>"There was a mighty smart lady running the place. She said to
me--she spoke English real good--she said, 'You're Americans,
aren't you?' and I said, 'Yes--how can you tell?' and she just
laughed and she said, 'Oh, I can tell!" and then I said to her,
'But I'm willing to go on record as saying that never even in
America have I tasted a nicer kidney!'</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I said to Roxy, 'I hope you're the same sweet,
fresh, unspoiled young lady you always was at home, even among
all those reporters and politicians,' and she said to me, 'Dr.
Bill, no girl can ever go wrong if she's been brought up to
understand the moral standards of Colorado, and I hope I'm still
the mountainside daisy and not the rank orchid!
Yes-sir-ree!'"</p>

<p>(That sly little devil. I shall send her a volume of
Machiavelli! Hayden privately admired.)</p>

<p>But this conviviality was presently marred by rivalry. There
is, Hayden found, something like a system of credits for
sightseeing: doing a cathedral thoroughly counts, let us say,
eleven points--exterior only, five; looking for not less than one
second at every single picture in a large gallery comes to
thirteen, inspecting a mountain village rarely beheld by tourists
is seventeen, dining at a celebrated restaurant is six, but if
you found it all by yourself, the credit is nine.</p>

<p>By this most reasonable standard for computing good works, the
Windelbanks had acquired at least four times as many points of
merit as Hayden.</p>

<p>They were pained by his evident sloth, and fretted out a
number of queries. Had he seen Madame Tussaud's Waxworks in
London? In Paris, had he done Napoleon's Tomb and had fish at
Prunier's? At his No's the doctor mourned, "Well, I must say!
What have you <i>done</i> with your time over here? How a man
could have this wonderful chance and come all the way to England
and not see Madame Tussaud's is beyond me!"</p>

<p>Hayden childishly reached for equality, tried to show off,
tried to show what an utterly changed and Europeanized and
generally improved edition he had become. He spoke in Italian to
the waiter (who seemed to understand parts of what he said) but
it was no go. The Windelbanks had definitely taken the lead in
culture now, and they brought out a few scientific conclusions
with an air of authority.</p>

<p>The citizens of Bologna (where they had spent three hours)
were definitely more cheerful than the citizens of Padua (two
hours). Throughout France, the sale of American soft drinks
(thanks to the purity of our soldiers who had served in that
untutored land) was practically wiping out the sale of wine. In
Cannes (twenty-two hours) there is always rain, at all seasons of
the year, and the Windelbanks had warned the hotel clerk there
that he was a very silly fellow to remain. He ought to see the
climate in Newlife, Colorado.</p>

<p>But they so far forgave Hayden as to promise to send his
address and telephone number here back to all the human catandogs
whom they had picked up along their way and who might be arriving
here soon: to that delightful young American couple they met in
Glasgow--the husband owned a brickyard, so Hayden and he would
have a lot of professional interests in common, and his little
wife was such a dear little woman; she liked to read the
guidebook aloud, and Hayden would enjoy them both so much, and
enjoy showing them around Florence. And the splendid Holland
Dutchman who was so amusing about salmon-fishing in Scotland, and
the wonderful Baptist pulpit-orator from Chicago, who would enjoy
showing Hayden around Florence and explaining the Catholic Church
to him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hayden had not meant to call for help, but later in the
evening he petitioned Olivia to help him have lunch with the
Windelbanks next day. Once, he knew, she would have refused, but
ever since he had met her, silken and defenseless, in the hall,
she had shown him a shade of pleading humility that almost
slipped into obedience. She accepted, with only a few scurrilous
observations on the sort of people he seemed to know at home.</p>

<p>He put in the morning before lunch in helping the Windelbanks
exchange their dollars and in leading them through pages 400-426
of the tenth edition of Baedeker's <i>Northern Italy,</i> along
with the compulsory daily shopping: the kodak films, the lace
collars and sweater for Jean Jr., their married daughter. It
would not be accurate to say that they had bought a sweater for
Jean Jr. in every country in Europe. They had never been in
Albania.</p>

<p>Hayden also advised them in the daily choice of three plain
and four colored post cards to send home.</p>

<p>"How many folks do you send souvenir cards to regularly, Hay?"
nosed the doctor.</p>

<p>"Why, not any--regularly," admitted Hayden, and then,
guiltily, "or irregularly either!"</p>

<p>"You don't? Why, you're missing half the fun of travel, to say
nothing of the pleasure you might be bringing into people's drab
lives!" From a waistcoat pocket the doctor whipped out a thin
gilt-and-mauve notebook. "I've got the names and addresses here
of my forty-seven very closest friends, relatives and patients
that are prompt pay, and every single week I send each of 'em a
card from somewhere in Europe, always with some cheering message
or interesting piece of information--say, like total population
of Italy. And this treasure-house book, as I call it, also
contains my birthday list for use at home, with folks' names
under the dates of their birthdays <i>and</i> wedding
anniversaries. How many cards do you send out on birthdays and
Easter and Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not as many as I ought to," said the abashed liar, who
darkly detested all standard greeting cards depicting two
sparrows and an antelope, with the apostrophe, "Where'er you are
or go or do, this festal day we think of you!"</p>

<p>"Now, Hay, you mustn't go and make the fatal error of thinking
just because you're getting so much smarter out of all this
classy travel, you can afford to neglect your friends. I may be a
good practitioner--I'll match my bridgework against
anybody's--but even so, I bet I wouldn't get <i>anywhere,</i> I
wouldn't make three thousand bucks a year, without the love and
loyalty of my friends.</p>

<p><i>"They're</i> the guys that understand and support and
recommend you! Don't forget that, among all these snooty
foreigners that they simply don't or won't understand what a real
friend is like! And, mind you, I don't just mean the good old
gang that you see every week at the Kiwanis or at church or the
country-club bar, and that pay their dentist right on the dot,
but the dear and tender chums of the magic bygone days, long
severed but forgotten ne'er, that if they happen to be in your
town for a convention or on a motor tour will honor you by
phoning you first thing and coming right out to the house to take
potluck with you and cheer up the wife by kidding her along.
You're damn tootin'! You may find a lot of stuck-up highbrows
here, always gassing their heads off and talking so much while
guys like us prefer to remain silent and not show off our
ignorance, but you're not going to find the old deep friends like
we know at home! Hm. Home! You know . . ."</p>

<p>Bill Windelbank was dreaming. When he spoke, all the brag and
bumptiousness were for a moment gone from him, and he looked at
Hayden appealingly:</p>

<p>"You know, Jean and me are awful seasoned tourists and we
always make out like we never get homesick, not even for Jean
Junior or her two babies or for the cottonwoods along the crick
just below our house. But one time, this trip, we were in a Paris
joint, real gay but high-toned, and suddenly, with no warning,
the band strikes up <i>Home on the Range</i>--'where never is
heard a discouraging word.' Well, sir, I looked at Jean and Jean
looked at me, and suddenly I could just <i>see</i> those
cottonwoods, and God, how I did long to be back there, safe! I
could have cried! And Jean--she did!"</p>

<p>How good they were, thought Hayden, and how kind--as the
Dodsworths were kind, as Sir Henry Belfont was not, as Olivia was
not.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Olivia met them at the Baglioni roof garden for lunch, and
horror struck immediately.</p>

<p>Hayden could not stop Dr. Windelbank who, to Olivia's small
leering delight, referred to him as Haysy-Daisy, and who
chronicled the one episode of which Hayden was most ashamed, for
its cheap bullying and hysterical loss of temper: the time when
he had threatened a tough sub-contractor with an empty revolver
and the man had caved in, all two hundred and forty hairy pounds
of him.</p>

<p>"Hay was a major in the last war, and a champ pistol shot!"
crowed Dr. Windelbank.</p>

<p>"And Hay was also nothing but a boss draftsman in that crusade
and never heard a shot fired in anger!" glared Hayden.</p>

<p>But it seemed to him that Olivia looked at him almost
affectionately, and on their way back to the <i>pensione</i> she
said, "I like you much better as a competent rowdy than as a
polite dilettante. But how those people hated me! They are very
brave and charitable, but they feel entirely competent to tell me
what to teach--to tell Italy and France what to teach--to tell
the bishop how to pray and God how to listen to the teaching and
the prayer."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the northern rim of Florence, toward the mutely watching
mountains, Fiesole perches on its hilltop like a monstrous eagle,
with its bell-tower for upstretched neck. It looks down on the
flood plain of the Arno, which is Florence, and remembers that it
was a ponderous-walled Etruscan city twenty-five hundred years
ago, when Florence was a nameless huddle of mud huts. Up here,
Boccaccio's maidens stayed the plague with song and most improper
story.</p>

<p>Half a mile from the Fiesole piazza, on the northern edge of
the cliff, is the small Raspanti Inn. The window-side tables look
into the sweetly climbing Mugnone Valley, where the river runs
through vineyards and barley fields, past farmhouses of plaster,
red-tiled and yellow-walled, with airy loggias for the
summer.</p>

<p>Hayden had bought a tiny Italian car--a topolino, people
called it: a "little mouse." To get into it you had to hoist your
knees up to the level of your forehead, but it had a gallant
motor for hill-climbing, and it hugged the corkscrew curves of
the Italian mountains, or went happily cantering past the
enormous blue omnibuses. In it he had flashed to Arezzo, and to
the old walled town of Lucca, now that, in mid-February, spring
was imminent, the grass between the olive trees was tinsel-green
and mimosa was displaying its canary-colored showers. Olivia had
gone with him once or twice, her obedience still astonishing him,
and today, at the Raspanti, she was seemingly contented to be
with him.</p>

<p>"One of those old farmhouses down there," he said, as they
finished their fedora cake and ordered coffee and Strega, "a man,
a family, could live quietly there."</p>

<p>"For a while."</p>

<p>"For keeps!"</p>

<p>"If there's a good bus, so you could go to the Laurentian
Library and the Uffizi," granted Olivia.</p>

<p>"A lazy spring day like this, I can't imagine going on
anywhere else, not even to Egypt."</p>

<p>"But I'm not lazy. Industry is my one poor virtue."</p>

<p>"Olivia! Let's talk--really talk!"</p>

<p>"Must we?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We are two lone ships in a waste of the South Pacific,
the days so empty and the nights so long under the stars. Why
can't we sail together?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the ships are going in opposite directions."</p>

<p>"Can't they stop a moment and get closer together?"</p>

<p>"Your poetic inquiry sounds very much like what my vulgar
students at Winnemac would call 'propositioning me.'"</p>

<p>"Olivia, you say things that shock me! You chatter about
ancient Greek tarts so frankly that it's embarrassing, and yet
you seem afraid of any natural, friendly contact--like this." He
took her hand, across the table, and she flinched. "What makes
you so abnormal?"</p>

<p>She said irritably, "Abnormal! My dear young man! You know
nothing about me. I may have ties that are entirely unknown to
you."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. I look at your mail on the hall
table--shamelessly. If you have some magnet, he's probably
imaginary. Like my own obsession with . . . Olivia, I never have
talked to you about my wife; haven't talked to anybody much, I
guess. I just told you she was killed in a motor accident. The
way she died is important, because sometimes I feel I murdered
her by my careless driving, and start brooding. Now, I make
myself come out of it, and realize I've just been wallowing in a
melodrama of regret, like a child scaring itself by drawing
spiders. I'm trying, at least, to look at her death the way a
good doctor would.</p>

<p>"I do honor her memory. She was extraordinarily plucky and
quick-witted, even if she wasn't kind-hearted like those people
you met--the Windelbanks. (Caprice always thought they were a
pair of stuffed shirts, by the way, with minds that weren't so
much photographic as phonographic.) She was a bluebird. But she
only liked the accidental things about me: my tennis and
swimming, and I used to be not so bad a dancer till I got tired
of the highballs and the shrieking and the swapping of wives. But
she never liked any of my virtues."</p>

<p>"Have you many?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have. As you know. I'm dependable and punctual and a
fine designer of unfine houses. Those tedious virtues. But I also
have a fighting conviction that men can be more than
trout-fishermen; that there must have been human beings who could
build San Miniato. I have much more imagination about possible
ways of living than you have, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Have</i> you!"</p>

<p>"Much. You tackle the Middle Ages to get them down in figures,
as a job, but I take a chance on making myself ridiculous by
feeling them as life, visibly around us still. You--this
continual aversion of yours to the normal male . . ."</p>

<p>"Oh, quit it! Don't try to show off your knowledge of
psychoanalysis as well as of Lucrezia Borgia!"</p>

<p>"Olivia, you've never let yourself live. Lucrezia--they didn't
hate her because she did any poisoning, but because she could
handle so many lovers. Why don't you imitate her, not just dig
her poor lovely bones out of their paper grave? You could be
adorable, but you're nothing but an expert in pedagogy
researching in the quickest methods of teaching knitting."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh!"</p>

<p>"There's an American girl wandering around Europe somewhere,
Roxanna, a redhead, that I despair of because she's gone native
with a gang of artistic heels. She's rackety and undisciplined,
and she doesn't know whether Borgia was a duke or a suburb, and
yet I give her more chance to get the sinful, glorious human
heart of Europe than you'll ever have. Oh, try living! It was
quite well thought of by Titian!"</p>

<p>"You are so breezy and Western and uninhibited. You are so
naive."</p>

<p>"You've called me that before."</p>

<p>"Naturally! So naive in believing that every woman ought to be
a college-campus petter!" She added, with spite and something not
unlike jealousy, "As your redheaded Miss Roxanna apparently
is!"</p>

<p>"She is no friend of petting. She doesn't need to be! Yes, I
am Western. I won't eat my breakfast unless I can lasso it. And
yet in my attitude toward self-repressing women, I am exactly
like Nat Friar or Ugo Tramontana. We consider them
monstrosities."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about. You're
babbling--oh, not so much coarse as boyish nonsense! I'd rather
you <i>were</i> coarse."</p>

<p>She arose, erect and angry in her blue nylon dress. He said to
himself, "She wants me to be coarse? I will be. She's so armored
that a bowman has to try a shot at her. Let's see if she's
human." He slipped his arm round her, his hand over her shoulder,
a sweet slim curve that contented his palm.</p>

<p>She seemed not rigid and prudish but still with terror. She
whimpered, like a bewildered girl shocked by a trusted old
friend, "Oh, don't--oh, don't--oh, please!"</p>

<p>He had quick pity for her. He released her, and she dropped
into her chair at the table again, her face all one raddled blur
of emotion, and as he sat down, she spoke tremblingly:</p>

<p>"Yes, there is. . . . It is true. I'm not quite natural toward
any man younger than Professor Friar. But there is a reason. It's
not me. I was turned so.</p>

<p>"I was twenty--so young and undeveloped but so sure I was
wise. I was a prodigy; I got my bachelor's degree at eighteen and
my master's at nineteen. At a big state university, this was. I
was working for my doctor's degree and teaching a couple of
classes and reading Professor Vintner's themes for him. I thought
I knew all about vices and seductions and the elegant wiles of
gallants in the Middle Ages, but I had never taken time to study
them first-hand, on the U campus in this Middling Age. Though
plenty of invitations! I knew all about Cellini but nothing about
the local quarterback.</p>

<p>"Leslie Vintner, <i>dear</i> Professor Vintner, my faculty
preceptor. European History from 450 to 1750. Tall and gray-eyed
and a little rustic in his looks, but Heavens, so slick and
cosmopolitan in his talk! He was very, very learned and clever;
he had studied at Montpellier and Rome and Berne and the
Sorbonne; he used to read Proven&ccedil;al poetry aloud,
delightful lyrics about roses and Maytime meadows and sighing
lovers. But he knew about all up-to-date diversions in modern
Paris, too--he <i>said:</i> vintages and baronesses and baccarat
and Josephine Baker singing. . . . Of course he had a cautious
wife, with a small income of her own. Dreary and getting
plump.</p>

<p>"He encouraged me--so fatuously, I see now. We used to sit
side by side on the greasy leatherette couch in his office, under
the reproduction of Fra Angelico saints, and smoke cigarettes and
drink tea with gin in it, and he'd tell me I was going to be
another Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;. I was going to be poet,
scholar, court beauty, and Gabriele D'Annunzio would come back
from his private perfumed hell to worship me.</p>

<p>"Leslie and I were most superior to that hustling campus. We
were pagans, we were winged spirits from the High Renaissance,
only (and honestly, he could do the most convincing repressed
sob) just now his wings were being clipped by his nasty big-foot
wife, and only in my sweet, languorous presence could he put on
his rainbow-colored plumes.</p>

<p>"I really worshipped him. I was an innocent, healthy, eager
kid, so devoted, so proud, but it wasn't just lambkin love. I
would have done murder for him, or sung over washing his
undershirts. I wrote sonnets about him that I was too humble to
show him, and I went out of my way to walk past his house (that
nasty gingerbread cake!) late at night, and if there was a party
and they were laughing, I was so jealous that my stomach
quivered. I used to keep a silk-tipped French cigarette butt of
his in my purse, and take it out and kiss it.</p>

<p>"So of course I fell for him completely whenever it amused him
to finish up the torture. Honestly, he shouldn't have killed
anything as young and loyal as I was!</p>

<p>"Then he got impatient. I forgot everything I had learned from
history--I thought he really meant his promises! I thought we
would be found out and both of us fired from the university, of
<i>course,</i> and I was all ready to live in a shack with him
and do the cooking and keep chickens and love it, and then some
day he would be divorced and marry me and Yale or California
would understand what valorous medieval souls we were and give
him a call, and we'd live in a tower of glory and . . . You
know.</p>

<p>"What's worse, I suppose I girlishly trilled all this to him,
and too often. He must have become pretty bored and impatient,
because I certainly wasn't so anesthetic and sneering then that I
chilled demanding gentlemen like Mr. Hayden Chart--<i>or</i>
Prince Ugo! I was recklessly passionate--panting. Poor Leslie! He
did a magnificent job of kicking me out. He really made it all
quite clear--though he must have been irritated by the way I
sobbed.</p>

<p>"He told me that he had never thought of me as anything but a
sentimental fool, very bad at exact dates, very confused in my
literary style, and a perfect pest about telephoning him at home.
And a skinny, ugly untouchable. The way I lavished all the
passion in me, he said, made it seem cheap.</p>

<p>"Even before I had quit sobbing, while I was still wiping my
nose with my coarse little cotton handkerchief--it was all I
could afford but I did like it; it had such a nice rose stamped
in one corner--before I had finished crying I had determined that
I would never again betray passion--or feel any. I never have.
I've ruled my feelings like mutinous soldiers. And so--and
now--that frigidity has become natural. For all my life!"</p>

<p>She rose slowly, and he with her.</p>

<p>He kissed her cheek, very lightly, and sighed, "Poor darling.
Dreadful!" Not till they were packed together in the topolino did
he go on: "It would not be too ridiculous to think of us as
married. We're both lost orphans. We might seek the City of Peace
together."</p>

<p>For a second he took his right hand from the steering wheel to
grip hers; for a second she returned the pressure. But she
answered resolutely:</p>

<p>"Hayden, I wouldn't trust myself to marry anybody. I think
I've controlled my natural storminess, but as a wife I would be
too attentive and absorbing. And I'm ambitious; I want high
academic rank, but that I could moderate. The trouble is that if
I gave it up for marriage, I'd be ambitious then for my poor,
driven husband. I'd push him into absurdly big
undertakings--influential people and get in on all the gaudiest
shows. I've become a cool scholar, not bad, and that's how I want
to stay. Though if I did go native and fall for anybody--it
conceivably could be you, Mr. Chart!"</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"You're gentle, but you aren't obsequious. And you're so young
and credulous. You actually believe that Bertran de Born was a
gorgeous figure of living tapestry, and not Question III, Section
2--if you pass him, you can teach Advanced Principles of Medieval
Mysticism and Chivalry to the hockey team. As I shall. That makes
being your wife sound attractive. But I'm a dynamo; I'm not safe.
Guard yourself!"</p>

<p>When they parted, in the hall of the Tre Corone, he kissed her
cheek again. She clutched his arm, turning her face of an ivory
saint toward him with a sharp breath, and then she fled.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Spring came in with the almonds and cherries and plum trees
blossoming in early March, and Olivia and Hayden wandered through
Florence. The American Colony delightedly recognized them as
potential recruits to matrimony and to the Colony.</p>

<p>From Sir Henry Belfont, whom he had vaguely met at teas,
Hayden had a stiff note informing him, somewhat in the manner of
a court summons, that Sir Henry had a nephew with Shell Oil who,
years ago, had met Hayden in London. The baronet was pleased to
command Hayden to luncheon, and would he care to bring some young
lady of his acquaintance?</p>

<p>He took Olivia. In the topolino. To the disapproval of the
Scotch butler, who preferred a Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>Sir Henry marched them through his house. Leniently, not
expecting them to appreciate such treasures, he showed off his
paintings. His Villa Satiro had started out, as a fortified manor
house, in 1301. It had three-hundred-year-old dwarf lemon trees,
and Dante slept here.</p>

<p>The handsomest room in the villa--it had been the bed chamber
of a grand duchess--was Sir Henry's study. The walls were
bookcases of English oak, with a royal ransom in folios and
illuminated choir books. The ceiling was a fantasy of little
nymphs beckoning to satyrs of no strong moral character, and
under this mocking rout, at an oak desk which had belonged to
William of Orange, Sir Henry wrote his letters. But his desk
chair had nothing of the royal touch about it. It was of the
latest ingenuity, with a sponge-rubber cushion, for while Sir
Henry's rear elevation was imposing, it was not suited to oaken
hardness. Too many tons of cream sauces had gone to the
construction of it.</p>

<p>He was a tall man and portly, and when he was surrounded by
women who admired him, or at least listened to him, he would
stand with his great head slightly on one side, with a fixed and
somewhat silly smile, as though he were shy of his own bulky
splendor. In his black jacket and linen collar--"no gentleman
makes a racetrack spectacle of himself in soft colored
shirts"--Sir Henry's resemblance to the Rock of Gibraltar would
have been remarkable, if it had not been for his untrimmed
eyebrows.</p>

<p>These eyebrows drooped in monumental triangles, like the manes
of little lions. He had a mustache and a precise small beard as
well, but they seemed to be only drippings from the eyebrows.
Sometimes, rather wistfully, he experimented with a monocle, but
it was lost under an eyebrow and left him looking as nearly
foolish as a man so much in love with his own nobility, so
admittedly representative of all that was best in the English
county families, could ever look.</p>

<p>But his wife was an American.</p>

<p>But his wife was rich.</p>

<p>At the luncheon were the Belfonts, Hayden and Olivia, Prince
Ugo Tramontana, and the Marchesa Valdarno, who discomfited the
host by snatching the conversation away from him. She was a thin
scabbard in her fawn suit and tight white turban. She was
American-born, swift, flashing, detestable. Rustically watching
her, Hayden comprehended the ageless elegance which Roxanna
Eldritch envied, but poor Roxy was an acolyte beside the
Marchesa, who suavely jeered not only at America but at Parisian
drunkards, English watering-places, old Roman society, and the
Sadie Lurcher Riviera set, of which Valdarno was herself a
member. Hayden sought the eye of Olivia, shadowed by the snowy
peak of Mt. Sir Henry, and they mutely confided that they didn't
like this.</p>

<p>They said practically nothing at lunch. Prince Ugo--fine,
lean, courteous--said only that Dr. Lomond was much honored at
the Laurentian Library. Olivia glowed, and Sir Henry looked at
her for the first time. The Marchesa Valdarno also looked at
her--with contempt.</p>

<p>Throughout luncheon, Hayden had his usual discomfort over the
European trick of speaking in four languages at once, switching
from English to Italian in the one same sentence, with the next
in French. He longed for the roar and whattameaning of Jesse
Bradbin.</p>

<p>But the soup was good.</p>

<p>But after lunch, as they rode home in the humble topolino,
Olivia yelled with unacademic vigor that she hated Sir Henry and
his mob and wanted never to meet any of them again.</p>

<p>"I would like to see him again, though," said Hayden, "because
I'd like to get to the bottom of why so many Americans and
well-heeled Britishers live permanently in Italy. Most of the
Italians don't much like us. They consider our drinkers too wet
and our hermits too chilly and our outmarrying girls, like that
Valdarno woman, disloyal to their husbands--some of them, I mean.
Yet we cling to this country. Why? I'll go to the Villa Satiro
again, if I get invited, which is not too likely. I don't think
Belfont considers me one of the more tinkling talkers."</p>

<p>"Me neither. And no more villa. It's too Satiro!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At night he was conscious of Olivia, down the hall, and
wondered whether he would again meet her in feminine mufti, free
of her hard uniform of professorial brown serge. But their next
jaunt was considerably less abandoned. In the fashion of Newlife
in his father's era, he took her to church; not to a resounding
Roman basilica but to a home-town church, a Main-Street church,
in English Gothic but flavored, too, with prairie wild roses.</p>

<p>The St. James American Episcopal Church in Florence has no
more Episcopalians than Methodists or Unitarians or plain
indifferentists. In the bright stone chancel, the American flag
hangs along with the Italian, and for an hour every Sunday
morning even the Colonists who seem almost alienated from Home
are betrayed into being American again. Social climbing is
halted, and girl students kneel beside florid gentlemen who have
superbly been in steel.</p>

<p>Most of the Colonists are given to complaining at dinner
parties that America has gone to hell, along with lazy and
overpaid servants, impertinent children, tasteless food and
fiendish labor leaders who will soon be purging all responsible
citizens. Yet at St. James's, as they unite in the old hymns,
there rises in them something primitive.</p>

<p>Colonists who have been asserting that they would as soon die
as go back to the States and see executives being obsequious to
bellboys and subway conductors and their own cooks, now hear
through the music at St. James's the heavy shoes on Plymouth
Rock, the barefoot Confederates marching in the wintry Tennessee
mountains, the plodding of moccasins on the Oregon Trail. In
their flippant unfaith to their lean and bitter mother, America,
there is yet more faith than in their zest for Europe, their
opulent mistress.</p>

<p>Hayden came in Sabbatically double-breasted blue, with a black
Homburg hat, and he was proud of Olivia's blue silk and her
resolutely white gloves and the unexpected prayer-book of
celluloid cover painted with forget-me-nots which she must have
borrowed at the <i>pensione.</i> Through service, he was content
to see how properly she rose and knelt. He remembered the spires
of Newlife, and was faintly lonely for home. He knew then that he
was unalterably an American; he knew what a special and mystical
experience it is, for the American never really emigrates but
only travels; perhaps travels for two or three generations but at
the end is still marked with the gaunt image of Tecumseh.</p>

<p>After church, they had lunch amid the fine linen of the Hotel
Excelsior, and Hayden boasted:</p>

<p>"You did well in church today--for a heathen. I am a correct
Episcopalian, and my firm built Holy Cross Pro-cathedral."</p>

<p>"Not me! I was brought up a Primitive Baptist. 'It's the
old-time religion!' How American I still am, even when I pretend
to have covered it over with Venetian velvet!"</p>

<p>"It's a perfect spring day. Let's wander all afternoon."</p>

<p>"Not me. I have a lot to read," said the sturdy girl from
Professor Vintner's class.</p>

<p>So they wandered all afternoon, through the spring-emblazoned
city, through dark courtyards lighted up equally by gold-decked
shrines to the Virgin and by plaid work-shirts hung up to dry
before a fifth-story window, past the Cerchi tower, among the
Sunday crowd oozing along the Arno, with a Punch and Judy show in
the Piazza Ognissanti. For tea they went not to a bar favored by
the Colony but were so bold as to sit out in the Square of the
Republic, in front of Gilli's.</p>

<p>They climbed up the winding driveway of the Viale dei Colli
and felt not the grandeur of Florence but its simple
pleasantness, under the trees, like the pleasantness of Newlife
in June. For dinner, Olivia guided him to a little basement
<i>trattoria.</i></p>

<p>They went down slippery marble stairs into a cellar with small
tables of transparent oilcloth over green-and-white table-covers.
On the rough walls were very bad landscapes with which art
students had paid their board-bills: landscapes with cow and
river and a mountain composed of cake icing. The one waiter was
guiltless of a white jacket; he wore a sweater and screamed
amiably at the patrons and sometimes sat down with them. The room
was full of cheerfulness: clerks and shopkeepers and soldiers
whirled their strings of spaghetti and acrobatically ate fried
potatoes with their knives.</p>

<p>Olivia was an intimate of the place. The waiter beamed and led
them through a more solemn dining room where, with white
tablecloths, dined the few tourists, on to the delights of the
kitchen, and that was a kitchen out of a Christmas story.</p>

<p>The floor was of red tiles and the charcoal broiler lighted up
a string of copper stewpans. It glared on the swarthy face of the
fat woman cook so that she looked like a lady fiend. But beside
the broiler was a modern electric range, crimson enamel and cool
steel. On a table, ready to be cooked, were all the varieties of
pasta: fat <i>tagliatelli</i> noodles, thin and writhing
<i>taglierini, tortellini</i> like snug little white doughnuts,
and the sage green of <i>lasagne verdi,</i> made with
spinach.</p>

<p>On benches at the long central table five hardy taxi-drivers
were dredging their grassy soup, and they looked up to salute
Olivia with <i>"Ecco! La Dottoressa!"</i></p>

<p>"It's an honor to be allowed to eat in the kitchen," Olivia
explained, as they took places on a bench. "I ate in the outside
room for a long while before the Signora would let me join them
here. Now I'm part of the family, and you will be."</p>

<p>"I appreciate it." And indeed when the drivers nodded to him
as though he were not a Foreigner and a Fare but a man, he felt
more honored than in any toleration by Sir Henry Belfont. Olivia
was hearty with a plate of giant ribbed <i>maccheroni</i> with
meaty Bolognese sauce, and they drank red table wine poured out
of what looked like a Newlife pop bottle.</p>

<p>Roaring with friendliness, the drivers wanted to know how
stood the Dottoressa, and had she dug out of the library any
scandals more recent than 1600? She fenced with them in
colloquial Italian, and they cackled. Though the sharp career
woman is new in Italy, there has always been a tradition of the
Learned Lady, like Camilla Rucellai, like Romola, a tradition of
honor, and Olivia seemed to wear the laurel crown with ease.
Hayden studied her with fond pride. Was he movingly in love with
her, a thing to last? With a throb, with sorrow for the
shallowness of his tribute to Caprice, he wondered if his heart
had forgotten her complete, and her faded little ghost was
wandering now forlorn in the Colorado winter, shelterless.</p>

<p>The restaurant was conducted by a family of whom the
grandmother was chieftain and chef, the youngish father was the
outside waiter in the sweater, his wife was assistant chef, their
two small sons were dishwashers and bus boys, and the baby, with
its dark eyes and humorous mouth, was the most expansive
customer. All evening, it seemed to Hayden, that baby was eating,
eating everything, ham and breast of chicken and peas cooked with
bacon and rather more red wine than strictly modern mothers give
to the hygienic infants of America.</p>

<p>The baby and Olivia found each other delightful and slightly
funny. They winked at each other, and the baby went to sleep with
its head against Olivia's arm. She flushed then; her lips were
tight and she breathed quickly. Hayden could not tell whether
this contact with the flesh of a baby was gratifying or
distressing. She fell altogether silent and stared at the baby
with a sun-and-shadow alternation of frown and tenderness. He
guessed that she was thinking of Professor Leslie Vintner.</p>

<p>When the drivers had gone and the kitchen was somewhat more
quiet, Olivia said carelessly, "I'll have to be leaving Florence
this coming week."</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i></p>

<p>"Oh, only for three-four days, and not till Tuesday. I have to
go to Venice, which it happens I have never seen, to look up some
records in the State Archives."</p>

<p>"I've never been in Venice, either. I'll drive you up
there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think we could do that. No, I'm quite sure we
couldn't. Thank you, though."</p>

<p>"Who's going to mind? It would be only too innocent. Who would
be shocked? Mrs. Manse?"</p>

<p>"I would be!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean . . . We've had a lovely day, and I've enjoyed it, and
all the more reason why I must remember my resolution not to be
dominated by any male."</p>

<p>"Who's trying to dominate you? Just friends."</p>

<p>"Not even too lively a friendship with a man, if it could
possibly grow into too much importance. I've been slack in regard
to you. Spring! I must put on my armor again. There! I have!
You're just an amiable gentleman who lives in my
<i>pensione."</i></p>

<p>He was irritated to ruthlessness by her undependability. She
was being a tease, flirtatious and bogus, encouraging him and
then drawing back. He expected that of a campus hoyden, not of a
devoted scholar. She could, it seemed, be just as phony as
Caprice--in the opposite direction: the Caprice who pretended,
like a man, to be only a breezy companion, uninterested in
love-making, when she was thinking of nothing else.</p>

<p>"So," he said treacherously, "we're just amiable acquaintances
again; very polite."</p>

<p>"That seems to be it."</p>

<p>"With no silly sentiment between us."</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"Two careless laddy-boys together. So we <i>can</i> go to
Venice, without any compromise!"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it!"</p>

<p>"I won't argue, but that's the logic of it."</p>

<p>He thought she looked disappointed when he talked vigorously,
and only, of the Dodsworths' new car. They returned to the Tre
Corone rather silently and, for once, he accompanied her down the
hall to her room and, as she opened the door, for the first time
he saw the interior.</p>

<p>It was decidedly not dusty and doctoral. Her bed was covered
with a fluffy white spread and over it was a cast of smiling
little angels. He seized her hand, and urged, "Olivia! Let's both
go to Venice! Let's not be skittish ing&eacute;nues. We don't
have too many live joys. Let's discover the wonder of Venice
together!"</p>

<p>"But if we should go--oh then, <i>please!"</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>12</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Olivia was youthful in white linen. "For a scholar, she spends
quite a lot on clothes," he reflected. Like a girl back home, she
was not wearing stockings, and there was a glow of bare ivory
knees as she tucked herself into the topolino.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that she has chucked her aloofness, that she
likes me a good deal?" he wondered.</p>

<p>They were close together in the tiny car on this, their first
mammoth excursion. Wisteria was beginning to paint the walls, the
mimosa bush was in yellow cataracts, and the daffodils were like
shy English visitors. The Tuscan spring was sweet with the smell
of plowed fields among the vine rows, where gentle oxen moved in
leisure, great white oxen against the brown earth, and the
liberated lovers were bound for Venice, city to them enchanted
but unknown. They sang together as they crawled, spiraled, sped
up on the road across the Apennines that is the highway to
Bologna and Venice.</p>

<p>After the Futa Pass, before the high notch of Raticosa, there
was a long upland ridge with valleys like unknown kingdoms
castle-starred below them. It was flying. The sheep pastures, the
pocket vineyards, the dumpy plaster farmhouses, and lone
monasteries which were high above the valley floor and yet
hundreds of feet below the car could be comfortably reached, said
Hayden, by a jump and then a good deal of quiet falling. It was a
twisted trail for eagles.</p>

<p>Olivia looked out of the car and directly down. "I'm not much
used to mountain driving. Are you good at it?"</p>

<p>"Used to it, at least."</p>

<p>"You sound confident. Then I am."</p>

<p>Before Raticosa they were in a mountain-top barren of stunted
pine and heather. Up here, it was still late winter, and patches
of sandy snow were dark along the road as they went back in time
two months behind Florence. The higher peaks beyond them were
solid snow.</p>

<p>"This must be frightening, in January. Like your Rockies. I'm
a plodding plainsman and marsh-jumper. A lot of my childhood in
Southern New Jersey," said Olivia.</p>

<p>The Italians have been admirable road-engineers since
centuries before Julius Caesar, and the car came down fast but
securely on the corkscrew road that drops from the pass to
Bologna in its valley, brisk red Bologna with its arcades. Then
it was all flat land across Emilia and the Veneto, and eight
hours from Florence, they left the car at the Piazzale Roma and
magically took a gondola up the canals of Venice, past palaces
whose doorsteps were washed by the sea channels.</p>

<p>Venice, on the map, resembles one large island (which is
really a group of small ones) curved like a heavy thumb and hand,
grasping at the head of another island like a timid animal with
agitated pointed paws. When Hayden pointed this out, rattling a
map in the breeze, Olivia cried, "An architect does get to have
an eye! My poet!"</p>

<p>For propriety, they stayed at two different <i>pensioni</i>
near the Piazza Morosini. They had cocktails at the Palazzo
Gritti, the most luxurious hotel in Italy, and dined at the
Colombo on tiny shrimps fresh from the Adriatic, listening to the
Venetian citizens standing at the wine counter and peacefully
quarreling. Then they walked through Venice till midnight,
getting lost and found and more lost than ever among streets that
changed their names every two blocks and after eight or ten,
ended slap in a courtyard with an ancient wellhead and no exit or
else crept up on a bridge over a canal and down under the bulk of
a palace, in darkness, to emerge on an astonishing square, vast,
empty, palace-walled. They saw arches reflected in the small
interior canals and the more exuberant illumination mirrored
flickeringly in the wide Grand Canal, caught through alleys that
were only three-foot slits between six-story warrens.</p>

<p>Here is the only city without wheeled traffic, the only city
dedicated to human beings and not to dictatorial automobiles, and
over all of it is unreality. They walked with stilled reverence
through the small crowds, free of the horrors of motorcycles and
of the bicycles that elsewhere in Italy stalk pedestrians and
bring them down.</p>

<p>Venice is not a city. It is one colossal palace on a low rock
in the sea. These are not squares and courtyards but roofless
halls, and if the stone is worn and the plaster blotched, there
is gaudy Renaissance history in balconies and Gothic windows.</p>

<p>These are not streets but corridors of the palace, and these
bright bazaars, heaped with figured satin and ivory triptychs and
spun iridescent glass, are not shops but the ancient loot of the
doges, and this is not stone pavement but the palace floor,
polished by centuries of feet that first skipped here, then
strode, then shuffled till they were borne to the funeral gondola
by sturdier feet; a floor so polished thus that by night light
all the granite roughnesses vanish in an even glow.</p>

<p>All round the palace a breeze flickers in from Ragusa and
Albania and the Adriatic isles. Fishing smacks with colored
lateen sails come in with cargoes of devilfish, and disdainful
steamers fresh from Egypt and its musky airs, and the gondolas,
with their small prow lights, lurch over the Grand Canal, the
gondoliers swinging on the poop.</p>

<p>Here and not elsewhere live Neptune and his daughters, whose
hair is spray. They were visible that night to Hayden and his
girl, pacing through hollow-sounding piazzas, their arms round
each other. He had little to say but "To find all this with
<i>you!"</i> and reluctantly he kissed her good night at her
door.</p>

<p>By working late, Olivia finished her research the next day,
and they dined in grandeur at the Gritti and again walked the
night half out. All the morning after they spent in the Piazza
San Marco.</p>

<p>They sat, in an idleness and contentment so profound that they
amounted to activity, at a table outside the Lavena, and watched
the operetta of the crowd: the tourists feeding the pigeons
which, at the bang of the clock struck by the bronze giants, rose
together in a tide of wings; the smoochers--sellers of post cards
and coral necklaces and the guide with the red scarf who was
always saying hopefully, "Guide? Me spik gud English."</p>

<p>An American destroyer was in harbor, and the crew and officers
had flooded ashore, each with a camera, from executive officer to
mess boy. San Marco cathedral must that day have exceeded its
quota of being photographed fifty times an hour.</p>

<p>Of these rangy American boys, with the freshness of Salem
Harbor or the Iowa hills under their salt glaze, Hayden was
proud. "Look at them! And next week, in Greece or Smyrna or
Spain! They've brought back the tradition of the clipper days
when Yankee faces (including a great-something-grandfather of
mine) were seen in every port of China and Africa and the Spice
Islands!"</p>

<p>He was incredibly contented with the friendly presence of
Olivia, the magnificence of the hour and place, where he could
see Byzantine and Gothic and Renaissance all together, in a
tremendous harmony. He thought that Olivia looked almost like a
fond wife when he passed on to her, as a lover's gift, all the
architectural lore he was harvesting.</p>

<p>He dutifully inquired, "But do you think we'd better be
starting? It's going to cloud over."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I've forgotten the responsible Dr. Lomond. Let's
drown in this sun while it lasts. Americans are always so
restless to be off; they follow some mental timetable that
they'll probably take with them to Heaven, to the considerable
annoyance of the timeless angels, who don't mind a bit if you're
a couple of thousand years late for choir practice!"</p>

<p>Her complaint was generously illustrated by an American
tourist couple at a table near.</p>

<p>They were people of sixty, and prosperous; they looked as
though they had retired from the woes of golf and children and
could be at leisure now. But while the wife bent her neck
forward, enraptured by the glow of the San Marco mosaics, the
husband showed his frustration by jiggling his feet, tapping on
the table, violently trying to catch flies, looking at his watch,
clearing his throat, yawning, and making a sporadic sound halfway
between a hum and a band-saw. He blurted at last, "Well, come on,
come on, Heaven's sake, let's get going!"</p>

<p>"Going <i>where?"</i> his wife sighed. "We're here!"</p>

<p>"I know, but good God, you can't just sit around all
<i>day!</i> Let's--we can go back to the hotel and write some
more letters, can't we?"</p>

<p>When the man of affairs and efficiency and death was gone,
Hayden sighed, "I've said that a lot of the Colonists in Florence
are too idle, but that's incomparably better than the
restless-footed sightseers like that man. Yes, you and I'll sit
here for seven years."</p>

<p>But the clouds were coming now, were darkening, and he was
dependable enough to make Olivia go.</p>

<p>When they had reached their topolino and started southward,
rain was already scouting in a sulky afternoon sky. Olivia looked
tired; her youthful white linen, unsuited to motoring, was
somewhat mussy; she was half yawning.</p>

<p>He ordered, "Go to sleep. The late hours these two evenings
have been too much for you. I'll drive fast, but with the care
due to my learned passenger."</p>

<p>She dozed off, with that ivory cheek, that sleek blackness of
hair, near his shoulder. He wanted to touch her, but in his rigid
creed nothing was more enduring than his father's croaking
injunction, "Both hands on the wheel, Son, <i>especially</i> when
you're out with the girls." And he had a memory of a car whirling
off the Bison Park highway, turning over. He remembered, too,
that once before, when they had been coming down from Fiesole, he
had for a second touched her hand in the car. Out of all this he
had now a quite satisfactory nervousness and worry till he made
himself forget it.</p>

<p>It was raining before they reached Bologna, and from her
quivering he knew that Olivia had awakened and was stiffly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"It's all right. Pavement not very slippery. Relax, darling,"
he clucked, and he was surprised at the kindness in his own
voice.</p>

<p>He made a business of getting them home. They did not talk,
and she must again have slid into sleep. As they swung up the
steep climb beyond Bologna, up into the mountains, snowflakes
began shivering down in front of them; tentative wisps of down,
then large, solid-looking flakes against which, he began to
imagine, they might bump and be smashed.</p>

<p>Olivia awoke with a nervous "Oh!"</p>

<p>"I'm used to winter driving. And good road. Don't worry."</p>

<p>But it was hard to see clearly through the windshield. The
blades of the wiper could not do much against the thick grease of
wet snow; the glass was streaky and clouded, and on the sharp
mounting curves he had to slacken speed, waste the momentum he
needed, to see which way the curves were turning.</p>

<p>As she leaned to a curve, Olivia's shoulder touched his, and
he found that she was rigid.</p>

<p>At just over two thousand feet of altitude, they came
instantly, without warning, into a belt of fog. He was blind in
the fog, and he had to keep going or slide back. It was
impossible to see the sides of the road. He opened the window
beside him and drove with his head thrust outside, the snow
licking his forehead and cheeks and chilled nose, the fog soaking
his hair. But moving slowly, sometimes at five miles an hour, he
could make out thus the boulder-marked boundaries of the
highway.</p>

<p>For all the fog, the wind was loud enough so that not till she
had repeated it did he hear Olivia's distressed, "What would
happen if we shot off the road here?"</p>

<p>He drew his head far enough into the car to answer, "Probably
wouldn't hurt a thing. We'd just drop onto a meadow slope and be
stopped by the rocks and brush."</p>

<p>So? To run off the road--again? Was he to crush Olivia as he
had crushed Caprice? Was that his ever-revolving fate?</p>

<p>She went on, "And then again we might keep on going--five
hundred feet?"</p>

<p>"Could be."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Oh, its all right. I'm getting used to it. You
aren't scared?"</p>

<p>"This is just routine fog driving. Bus drivers do this
regularly, and never even notice it."</p>

<p>"But you're not a routine bus driver. You have no idea how I
admire your competence. But think of all the fine scenery that
must be lavishing itself unnoticed, straight down below us
there--on both sides of this ridge. I'm glad I can't see how far
down!"</p>

<p>He was too absorbed to comment. He had never driven in a worse
fog, and with a road so steep, so curving, so slippery with snow,
he could not save their lives if the car skidded and took
charge.</p>

<p>He was back below the Bison Park highway, imprisoned, too late
to begin living again--and then he would not let himself be
there. He bleakly forced himself to be only here, single-minded.
He methodically considered stopping in one of the turnouts, but
with boundary lines so blurred by the fog, he might be hit there
by another car. It was safer to go on.</p>

<p>He was startled when two sickly car lights were conjured up
just in front of him, and he had to swerve, to take the chance of
going off the road and down, bottomlessly down.</p>

<p>She shuddered, "Oh! Shouldn't we stop?"</p>

<p>"We shall, the minute we hit a place, a village or something
where there is room for safe parking, and we can get out and have
a drink. I remember one or two inns up along here. And we've got
to begin thinking about holing up for the night. This fog may
keep up till morning, and if we stayed in the car, we'd about
freeze. But we may find a country inn."</p>

<p>"You mean we may have to sleep there tonight?"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>He was pleased that she should agree, and a little dubious
about his own pleasure in it.</p>

<p>They had now a month, a year, of agony. Snow slid maliciously
through the open window beside Hayden, and he could feel Olivia's
shoulder shaking convulsively as she became more wet and chilled.
The stone markers were only darker blurs in a general dark
drifting gray. But they had to go on.</p>

<p>They were penned in a moving prison for a lifetime sentence,
to be ended, perhaps, by sudden and shocking death. But they had
to go on.</p>

<p>Only with a tired incredulity did he see and lose and see
again a fabulous glow in the smear ahead, and then a cluster of
fog-wrapped lights. "Golly!" he said, and not very logically
wanted to kiss Olivia but, busy with the clammy wheel, did
nothing so reasonable.</p>

<p>They had reached some kind of a fair-sized building, with a
blessed wide parking space. He bade her, "Wait in the car till I
size the place up." Both of them breathed long and sighingly with
the relief of being, for a moment, safe.</p>

<p>Their refuge, he found, was a mountain-country combination of
hotel, grocery shop, wine shop, bar, billiard room and
restaurant. At the counter a dozen young mountaineers were
drinking, tough but not unfriendly, and they nodded to his
greeting. The landlady, in her cascade of striped apron, was a
woman of character and considerable poundage. The walls were
roughcast, and the three dining tables had cloths worn and
darned, but it was all clean enough, and there was a pink
terra-cotta stove that shouted warmth.</p>

<p>Yes, the landlady said, she had three bedrooms for rent, two
still unoccupied; yes, he could have a fine supper here, with the
choicest of veal.</p>

<p>It was toward seven now, with no chance of the fog clearing.
He hurried out to assure Olivia, "Warm! Clean! Two rooms! Grub!
We'll stay the night."</p>

<p>"Yes." She crawled out of the topolino, a comic figure in the
laprobe heaped over her white linen. She tottered with
stiffness--wavering, sobbing. He held her to him, not kissing her
but laying his warmed cheek against her ghostly cheek, and she
clung to him, hands tight about his shoulders, whimpering, "So
childish, nothing but a little cold on a good road, fine main
highway, and me frightened like that! But I was so lost and
scared. But I'm so glad I'm with you!"</p>

<p>"Want a brandy?"</p>

<p><i>"Si, si, certo!</i> And a room that doesn't keep sliding
over into an abyss!"</p>

<p>"Can do."</p>

<p>"My mountaineer! My valiant major!"</p>

<p>"Come on."</p>

<p>In the crowded barroom-restaurant the drinkers looked at
Olivia with relish. Her color was Calabrian, but her unmelting
eyes convinced them that she was not Italian but English, and
from their fathers, who had known the spacious days when all of
the English milords took walking trips in the mountains, they had
heard that all Englishwomen are beautiful and mad.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The landlady showed them the bedrooms: narrow, stone-floored,
cold as outdoors. On each of the narrow beds was one of those
Italian country quilts evidently stuffed with steel-filings and
geology, which, though they are very heavy, on the other hand
induce no warmth at all.</p>

<p>But Olivia said gaily, "You would have your adventure! You'll
have it tonight, sleeping in this Greenland igloo. But there's a
very nice sacred oleograph in each room. <i>Bene!"</i></p>

<p>As they went back downstairs, through the partly open door of
the third bedroom peered an old man with a fall of despondent
mustache and an ancient cape gone gray-green.</p>

<p>"Our fellow guest. He looks all right," Hayden muttered.</p>

<p>(He was in Europe, he actually was in Italy, at an inn, at
night, with his girl, with a man of cloaked mystery down the
hall, and he was not making it all up in his hospital bed in
Newlife, sleepless, looking at the radium dial of his bedside
clock!)</p>

<p>Olivia insisted, "Oh, the old man is fine. Possibly just a
little homicidal--believes that he is a soldier of Garibaldi and
we are Austrians. . . . Of course you noticed that there are no
locks on our bedroom doors."</p>

<p>"You can wedge a chair under the knob."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. I shall depend on you."</p>

<p>They had with them their bags, packed for Venice, but of any
washing save with a can of hot water there was no prospect. In
their glaring hunger, they did not care. "I never allow myself
bath salts nor a bath thermometer, not even since I inherited the
ten million," she said cheerfully; then: "But if we <i>had</i>
gone off the road . . ."</p>

<p>He stroked her cheek, and hastened to get into her the
spiritual solace of hot noodle soup. The mountaineers had gone
home, and the common room became a private dining room and the
landlady their private chef. They had spaghetti, veal cooked with
mozzarella cheese, pink cake and pink local wine. By moving their
table next to the pink terra-cotta stove, into which the landlady
kept stuffing brush roots, they were not cold--not intolerably
cold--just shivering a little.</p>

<p>The mystery man in the cape came down to have his spaghetti,
but he did not seem to be looking at them. He read in a small old
leather-bound book.</p>

<p>The dining room was also the lounge, and they sat at their
table long after dinner.</p>

<p>"Comfortable?" Hayden said. He meant his voice to be only
placid and encouraging, but it sounded tender.</p>

<p>"Very! You know, this place isn't really strange to me. It's
homelike--something warm and littered and casual about it.
Sometimes I get tired of the cold chastity of my room at the Tre
Corone. It's just a hygienic waiting room for tired souls. Your
room is better, a bit more disordered and bachelor-slatternly,
and yet it's almost as bitterly neat as mine."</p>

<p>"What do you know about my room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I look in every time I pass it. You have a neighborly
wild-western way of leaving your door open."</p>

<p>"I suppose I do." He laughed at himself. "My pose is the
solitary scholar--the devout hermit--Marsilio Ficino--mustn't be
disturbed by anything--chase out the dog and strangle the
children. And all the while I guess I want to hear those cheerful
domestic noises: the cook smashing dishes and Vito Zenzero
bawling out Perpetua for stealing the guests' perfume and not
saving any of it for him. And hoping that you <i>will</i> give me
a Hello and come in. Why don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do sometimes--in spirit--and have long grave talks with
you."</p>

<p>"What do we say in those grave talks?"</p>

<p>"I ask your opinion, as an architect, on the merits of
fan-vaulting."</p>

<p>"I see!"</p>

<p>"And sometimes I feel like reading to you my sister's latest
letter--evenings when I'm a little homesick."</p>

<p>"Why don't you?"</p>

<p>"I never get <i>that</i> homesick! Oh, darling . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Let's not waste this one completely quiet evening--maybe the
only one we'll ever have--waste it in being chatty," said Olivia.
"I get worried about you. It's impersonal, really, but it rises
from such a liking for you, and respect.</p>

<p>"As I heard Mr. Dodsworth say to you once, why do you let
Europe get you? For us Americans it's a drug, a sleeping-draught,
all made of poppies and the wonder of old, old civilizations and
religions and dreams, so lulling after our brisk, raw climate at
home, where we have to face the blizzard, fight through it or
freeze. Go home, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Would you go back with me?"</p>

<p>"I can't. Europe <i>has</i> got me. I'm an exile here, but
back in America I'll always be an exile double-distilled."</p>

<p>The old man in the faded cape sighed to himself, "There is an
American couple who are not glib and hustling, but true tender
lovers. Darling forgotten, we were like that, <i>then!"</i></p>

<p>He rose, bowed good-night, and left them.</p>

<p>"But you," Olivia was urging Hayden, "can still go back to
America uninfected."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure. I love Florence. It's very much like you. I
wonder sometimes if I'll ever go home. With Caprice gone, I'd be
lonely there."</p>

<p>He realized with a jar that he ought never to speak of Caprice
to Olivia. He hastened to cover it with a false-hearty, "In
Florence there's a kind of perpetual excitement; not
football-game excitement but a blissful stir. I look in at some
new church, or call on Nat Friar and listen to his newest lies
about Sir Henry Belfont. He swears that for twenty-two years
Belfont was butler for the Duke of Nottingham and sold the
household wine and invested the swag in gambling houses. Or I go
to the Dodsworths' for bridge. But most of all, I can talk to
you, after dinner--when you're not being cold and repulsive."</p>

<p>"Am I cold sometimes?"</p>

<p>"And repulsive."</p>

<p>"Wonderful! I try to be, so that I won't get found out as the
embarrassed village tomboy I am at heart. And you're still the
village high-school hero: the basketball captain and tenor in
your Episcopal choir and valedictorian, with such a thoughtful
Commencement essay comparing Columbus and General Grant. That was
a good life we knew as kids--so much more than the surface
Florence that we see. It was as real as this mountain wind. Go
back to it while you can."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if I left you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him full, ivory softly flushing, and murmured,
"It would be very much safer for me if you left me!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She became warmly sleepy, in relaxation from the cold, the
danger. She stretched her arms out on the table and dropped her
head on them. She turned her pure, shadowy face toward him for a
moment, with a funny, babyish smile, a defenseless smile all
unlike her normal dignity, and went confidently off to sleep.</p>

<p>He passed his hand over her head, her shoulders, her good
arms, not actually touching them but seeming to follow a delicate
invisible integument that sheathed her and kept her inviolate.
Then, unmoving, he watched her. Time was abolished, time and
space were only in her. And the landlady came heavily clumping
and Olivia awoke.</p>

<p>Hayden rather thought that, in her mountain accent, the
landlady was saying, "Good night. When you get ready to go to
bed, put out the lights in this room. Sleep well." She leered at
Hayden and thumped away and upstairs.</p>

<p>"Uuuuuuuh," yawned Olivia.</p>

<p>"What did our hostess say?"</p>

<p>Olivia slowly sat straight, murmured slowly, "She said that
all pleasant things must come to an end and that it's time for us
to say good-night."</p>

<p>Suddenly it all came over him.</p>

<p>He bluntly moved his chair toward hers, put his arm round her,
pulled her toward him.</p>

<p>"Olivia! I had been planning to make love to you--not planning
it all day, not all our journey, but tonight, when you were soft
and warm and near me. But something has hit me hard, something
too basic to allow any experimental love-making. I don't know--I
think I may be desperately in love with you. And when I think of
the dreadful thing I might have done in trying to tempt you, I'm
aghast! I'm not fit to love you. I'm a murderer! I murdered
Caprice by my carelessness. <i>I am not fit!"</i></p>

<p>She sprang up and he agitatedly rose to face her. Her voice
was strained and fierce, with not one evasive civilized qualm in
it.</p>

<p>"You did not murder her! You're a fool to say it! You told me
about her--you've told me much more than you knew--about her and
about you. But if you had meant to kill her, I'd be glad!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did! I hate your damn, curly-headed,
curly-minded leech, Caprice! Sucking your blood--living on your
kindness and your gentleness!"</p>

<p>"That's not true! She was plucky and gay. . . ."</p>

<p>"She was a sneak thief of life!"</p>

<p>"Olivia!"</p>

<p>"O-liv-ia! Professoressa Dottoressa Olivia! That frump! That
good, safe, cautious doctor of frigidity! She's dead, too, and
you murdered her, too--thank God! The wild highlander in me has
come to life again, in this wild, windy highland--thank God.
Dearest Hayden, quit blaming yourself, quit smothering yourself!
I love you!"</p>

<p>Her arms were round his neck and she was pressed against him
before his hands locked behind her shoulders. When he could look
at her, all the restraints in her face were loosened, and she was
as abandoned as the most feckless highland lass, and breathed as
hard.</p>

<p>She said nothing more, and they did not remember to turn off
the lights in the dining room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>13</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The morning sun was warm and shameless, and their eggs,
consumed to a view of snowy Apennine peaks absurdly like piles of
the best peach ice cream, had ozone in them--so Hayden asserted.
They were chatty and they were smiling somewhat smugly, and did
not even see an old man with a cape and a small Elzevir.</p>

<p>"Looks as though we are to be beautifully married," said
Hayden.</p>

<p>"Astonishingly enough, it does! My lord and master, may I go
on studying?"</p>

<p>"You are graciously permitted. Do you want to stay on in
Italy, and maybe France and Holland and so on, for a few
years?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a couple of years or so, if you can stick it. But I do
want to see your Newlife--your house--our house! I want to find
out whether I've learned so much about the terror and splendor of
the Middle Ages that now I can become a halfway decent
commonplace wife and do the job as well as Catherine Sforza
would. Oh, yes, I shall love Newlife--in a controlled way!"</p>

<p>"We'll build a Renaissance church there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean <i>we</i> will? <i>You</i> will! I'm a
simple, admiring wife now. I shan't even give you any advice,
ever. Whatever you do will seem wonderful to me. . . . Except
just this. You are not to build any Renaissance churches or
Gothic churches or Romanesque or anything else imitative of
Europe. Go ahead and develop the American Georgian, as you
planned. Stand for something; don't just copy."</p>

<p>He said meekly, "Yes, that might be--yes."</p>

<p>All the way to Florence, she sang Neapolitan lyrics and
smoothed his sleeve.</p>

<p>With a not very-well-defined feeling that now they should
march out from solitude and take their civic place, Olivia and
Hayden were presently seen flauntingly together everywhere in
Florence, at church, at the bars, walking on the Tornabuoni and
the Lungarno. In the tight environment of their <i>pensione,</i>
which was as close to them and sometimes as itchily intrusive as
a hair shirt, they had not announced any engagement and they kept
their separate tables, but their attachment must have been
clear.</p>

<p>Certainly it was to Vito Zenzero, clerk, headwaiter, and
authority on which countesses in town were authentic. Vito looked
confidently at Olivia as he took her dinner order, and she seemed
contented now to be accepted as merely a woman, betrayed and lost
to scholarship and generally happy. Every time Hayden looked from
his table to hers, he smiled and Olivia smiled and Vito smiled
with them both, and Olivia was not offended.</p>

<p>As a child, Hayden had devotedly trusted in his sturdy father,
his fragile and fanciful mother. But from this serenity the
neighborhood bully, a foul brat, had first startled him. With
Caprice and Jesse Bradbin he had been distrustful, constantly
vigilant. Now, first since the dawn years, he felt, with Olivia,
not only an arousing tension but a secure faith, in which his
mind flowed smooth and full.</p>

<p>He was proud of escorting this young woman, so wise, so warmly
beautiful, so affectionate--but only to him. Her brown dress,
which formerly had seemed merely serviceable and neat, was to him
now a garment of singular gracefulness and fine fabric, and its
choice showed his lady's knowledge of the smart world. It seemed
to him that her darkly pallid face was richer now with new fast
blood. It must have seemed so to every one, for Mrs. Dodsworth
observed, "You're getting out more now, Olivia. You look much
livelier for it."</p>

<p>And said Sam Dodsworth, "I used to be embarrassed with you two
young highbrows, but you've become as simple-hearted a couple as
I ever saw. Glad of it. Edith claims that we old married exhibits
get what she calls vicarious pleasure out of young love. Don't
you two let me down, like a lot of undependable young pups these
days--eight different engagements and two divorces in five years.
You two stick!"</p>

<p>"We'll stick!" proclaimed Hayden, and Olivia looked
complaisant--though, to be precise, their betrothal was most
undefined, with such unromantic business as deciding when and
where they would be married scarcely discussed. But the ardor
between them certainly had not lessened and, in the pallid
cautiousness of the Tre Corone boarding house as in the wild inn,
they roused each other to an ardor that sometimes frightened
Hayden.</p>

<p>"You seem changed, somehow," they all said to Olivia--Tessie
Weepswell, the prima donna of bridge, Mrs. Manse, Prince Ugo
Tramontana, and if Vito Zenzero did not say it, his eyes said it
for him. Most of them all, Hayden was startled by it.</p>

<p>Olivia was a good workman; she was as steadily about her
subway labors at the libraries as ever, but she mocked her own
laboriousness now; she was occasionally willing to sit long over
red Chianti at lunch, and in every inch of her, as Hayden
lovingly surveyed her, he found her blood more torrential--in
moving lips, in hot cheeks, in firmly grasping hands.</p>

<p>It was particularly at Nat Friar's house that they were
accepted as a Young Couple. Not for many years had the
once-gallant young Nathaniel Greenleaf Friar of Boston been an
adventurous amorist. Nowadays he looked upon passion as he looked
upon assassination: as a diversion that had been fashionable in
the Middle Ages, and very useful, but of which, surely, there had
been enough by 1600.</p>

<p>At supper for the Young Couple, served on his living-room
table cleared of books and pipes, with a noble San Daniele ham,
Nat smiled and teased his beard, and addressed Hayden: "I suppose
I must give my sanction to the dangerous exploit that Dr. Lomond
and you are contemplating. People still do get married, do they?
I thought they all got tired of it about twenty-five years
ago.</p>

<p>"Well, marriage is an excellent and almost tolerable
institution for groundlings who have nothing else to keep them
annoyed and occupied in the long evenings, but I have never
commended it for scholars. All through my life I have had
acquaintances who dashed in howling, 'Nat, you need some one to
take care of you, and I've found just the woman for you!' Then
they drag in some weedy virgin or unwieldy widow whose ambition
is to be supported in return for such caretaking as hiding my
slippers where I can never find them, or quarreling with my maid,
whom I have cherished for fifteen years, and replacing her with a
fancy male who cooks with butter and collects even more than the
legal illegal commission of ten per cent on all shopping. These
solitary animals who call themselves 'scholars'--they should
never marry. And Ada will agree."</p>

<p>"You," said Mrs. Shaliston Baker, gently, "are the most
selfish, loquacious and untidy old barbarian living."</p>

<p>"Uncle Nat," said Olivia, "I could kill you with pleasure. I
used to be cynical, too, but now I can see that there may be a
better reason for living than just a knowledge of Etruscan
tombs."</p>

<p>"If you two women really believed any of that, you would
really kill me and not just babble about it, when I make so basic
an attack on your sex, when I judiciously point out that a wife's
notion of being a faithful helpmate is to be willing to wait
while you are paying the bill for the mink coat she has swindled
out of you. But no woman believes in Women. When I attack your
faction, you both gloat."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh!" said Olivia.</p>

<p>"And you, Hayden, you agree with me, or presently will."</p>

<p>Startled, Hayden wondered about that. He admitted to himself
that he was sometimes a little edgy over the panting watchfulness
which the changed Olivia now kept over him. He had been so
free!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Among the yodeling witnesses to their bliss, none was more
fervid than those new <i>pensione</i> boarders, the
Grenadiers.</p>

<p>The Grenadiers, as Vito Zenzero had named them, were
middle-aged twin American ladies. They had been well paid for
divorcing uncouth husbands who were in trade--shoes and wholesale
plumbing; who were not, in short, "creative." <i>Creative</i> was
the Grenadiers' favorite word. It was <i>creative</i> to sell
antiques but not plumbing.</p>

<p>The Grenadiers came from Pennsylvania, but they had lived long
in England, in Bloomsbury boarding houses, and they said
"lift"--when they remembered it--and hoped to be taken for
English.</p>

<p>They took photographs all day long.</p>

<p>They had also lived in Carmel, Taos, Taxco, Greenwich Village
and Montparnasse, tracking down not so much Culture as the
creative and romantic dealers in Culture: ballet-dancers,
summer-theater directors, fiddlers. They had now moved their
field station to Florence.</p>

<p>They took photographs all day long and showed them to you all
evening long.</p>

<p>They were unbeatable at coursing through churches, galleries,
art shops, and they took buses out to Prato and the Certosa. They
had picked up a young male slut who was supposed to be an
American student but whose studies were only of bars. They
introduced him as "such an ardent, creative talent--he speaks
seven languages--he just <i>hates</i> America!"</p>

<p>Whichever the seven languages may have been, they did not
include any Italian, nor much English beyond, "Actually,"
"Amusing" and "Oh, my dears."</p>

<p>The Grenadiers' burlesque of his own Culture-stalking made
Hayden want to go home, where he would cultivate not this
quarter-knowledge of history but his full and accurate knowledge
of Newlife; where he could tell you, offhand, just how much
12,758 Schuyler Boulevard would bring per front foot, and who was
the father of the wife of the third baseman of the Newlife team.
He denied his own denial; he insisted that his white nights of
outwatching the Bear had been fruitful, but he was learning what
older and wearier practitioners of scholarship and the arts all
learn: that their worst enemy is the rich female amateur.</p>

<p>Hayden could endure the winter cold of his room, the contempt
of Jesse Bradbin, but he could not endure the approval of the
Grenadier Sisters when they bubbled to him, "We do think that
your engagement to Dr. Olivia is <i>the</i> most romantic thing
we ever saw. It's truly creative: an architect who
<i>appreciates</i> how vulgar most Americans are marrying a woman
scholar who knows how many gardeners Lorenzo Mag-nifico kept at
his villa!"</p>

<p>Put that way, Hayden saw his interest in Olivia as fairly
sickening.</p>

<p><i>"But,</i> Mr. Chart," croaked the Grenadiers, "you'll have
to watch your step. Very few of you men have the chance to be the
consort of Dr. Olivia--such a rare woman and she can put it over
any of you men, and you got to admit it, when it comes to
creative ability. You may be so efficient and all that, but here
you have to take a back seat. We'll bet a cookie, if Olivia quits
her teaching job when you get married, she'll step right out on
the lecture platform, and my! think how proud you'll be, with
thousands of people listening to her, hundreds anyway, when she
explains what St. Catherine and St. Francis and Boccaccio and all
those deep thinkers were thinking! You let us tell you, Mister
Man, you'll have to be content to share her with the world!"</p>

<p>He brooded to himself, "Perhaps an uninspired routine
draftsman like me would feel more secure with a woman who isn't
in danger of being intoxicated by the limelight and the
microphone and fools like these sisters. No! Nonsense! That's
half treachery and half idiocy. Dear Olivia, she would never ride
a sound-truck in the public square!"</p>

<p>And Olivia joined him in ridiculing the Grenadiers'
proprietorship of the good, the true and the beautiful, but one
evening she listened unsnickering when they gushed, "Oh, Dr.
Olivia, you've got to excuse us if we bore you by raving so about
you. We do love Culture, oh, we think it's simply wonderful, and
so much needed, but we're just amateurs compared with a
wonderful, wonderful trained expert like you!"</p>

<p>Olivia murmured, "Me? I'm a schoolma'am who was lucky in
having hardboiled teachers."</p>

<p>But she did listen while the Grenadiers gave her the useful
information that she was a mistress of medieval law and as
beautiful as Clarice Orsini.</p>

<p>Hayden noted that the Olivia who once, after the
<i>pensione</i> dinner, had taken coffee alone at her table and
then flitted off to her barricaded cell, was staying on for
coffee in the lounge, and now and then holding forth to
eye-brightened circles on what was really worth seeing in
Florence. When the North Italy agent for the Little Dandy
Tractors of Moline said to her admiringly, "Say, Doctor, there's
one thing I never could get straight about these doggone Middle
Ages--maybe you can tell me," then Olivia did tell him, and she
did not look at an impatient Mr. Hayden Chart off in a
corner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>14</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Somewhat less than four weeks after their mountain inn, four
weeks during which Hayden had tried to march on in Italian
history, Olivia demanded, while they dined at Paoli's, in their
familiar escutcheon-brightened corner, "Darling, there's one
quite important thing you might do for me."</p>

<p>"It's done."</p>

<p>"I want to go to lunch at Sir Henry Belfont's some more."</p>

<p>"That pompous old fake? You said you never wanted to see him
again. You disliked him even more than I did."</p>

<p>"I have reasons."</p>

<p>"But how could I arrange it? I can't phone him and say we want
a change from the Tre Corone boiled tongue and spinach, and how
much does he charge?"</p>

<p>"No! Don't try that. He might take you seriously and take us
as boarders and he'd charge enough to ruin us. Whatever the old
pot may be, I'm sure he knows how to make it pay. . . . As you'll
make it pay, my ardent young architect, when I've looked over
your setup in Newlife and probably fired your partner, Bradbin or
whatever his silly name is, for cheating you! With Henry, it will
be extremely easy. Call him up and invite him and Lady Belfont to
lunch at some cheap <i>trattoria</i>--be sure and give him the
name of the place. He'd hate it. So he'll haw a little and then
ask if he can't invite you and Dr. Lomond--you know that lovely
Livy?--to his place instead."</p>

<p>"Do you really want to go there and listen to him tell how
well he knows the Queen of Saxony and His Serene Grace, the
Sixteenth Duke of Brabant?"</p>

<p>"Well now, Henry knows a lot about Italian painting, at least
a quarter as much as Prince Ugo. And he's very rich and vain. If
I could get him interested in our art gallery at my university--I
have a not entirely silly hope that when we're married and I
break my university connections, they may make a new post for me:
lecturer on history and only have to go there a month or so out
of every year, but keep in touch. And they might name the
lecturership after me."</p>

<p>"You'd be away from Newlife that long?"</p>

<p>"You could come along and listen, if you wanted to."</p>

<p>"Yes--yes . . ."</p>

<p>"Anyway, there's no sense in your inverted snobbery about Sir
Henry. He may come in very useful. Imagine him coming to visit at
the university while I'm there, and me introducing the old
windbag to the president and the students. They'd be so impressed
by his tenth-rate title. And then maybe he'll give us the art
gallery. So run along now and do as I tell you, and don't
argue."</p>

<p>"Have you such a definite expectation of being bored in
Newlife--or rather, with me--that you're already sketching an
emergency exit?"</p>

<p>"I'll adore every minute with you, and I expect to run our
servants like a sergeant major. But you know that with the
academic work I've done, I do have other interests. After
<i>all!"</i></p>

<p>"But Olivia, suppose we don't have any servants to run and we
have to do our own housework, you and I together? You've urged me
to freelance, and that may not mean much money for quite a
while."</p>

<p>"Then you'll need my help more than ever, need me making a
little money, too. Darling, why are you so difficult today, so
argumentative? You aren't usually."</p>

<p>"This whole business of catering to a poop like Belfont
revolts me. A little while ago you would have scorned the thought
of toadying to him. You would have slapped down anybody who
suggested that you would ever be willing to introduce him to your
president--whom you also despise!"</p>

<p>"My dear, that scrupulous Dr. Lomond--the chilly, opinionated
old prig!--is gone, and I'm another woman. You ought to know. You
certainly contributed enough to the change. And you can't have me
both the shrinking virgin and the bold earthy lover--you can't
have anything both ways. Now skip in and phone!"</p>

<p>The telephonic swindling worked out as the shrewd new Olivia
had planned. Sir Henry shuddered at the thought of meeting normal
Italians at a restaurant, and he lavishly invited Hayden and
Olivia to the Villa Satiro.</p>

<p>They drove up in the topolino, which again caused an
aggravated spasm of agony in the butler, who was a cheap reprint
of Sir Henry, not bound in the original eyebrows.</p>

<p>As they descended, out from a taxicab just arrived frisked a
stalwart and handsome young man over whom Olivia fluttered, "What
a beautiful animal <i>he</i> is! A Lombard knight, without fear
and splendidly without brains. I can place him within a decade or
two: 875 A.D., I think."</p>

<p>He was almost certainly an American, with a look about him of
Scandinavian ancestry: an extremely large young man in his early
thirties. Over his fresh-looking tweeds a light topcoat was slung
from his shoulders like a cape. He was hatless, with an
exuberance of flaxen hair. Hayden, who looked upon the fellow
with much less exuberance than Olivia, thought that with a show
of knighthood he combined a suggestion of a college football
star, of a vacuum-cleaner salesman, and of a popular singing
evangelist shouting jazz piety.</p>

<p>The stranger waved his wide hand to them and entered the villa
after them, in the manner of royalty standing aside for aged
peasants.</p>

<p>Sir Henry met them in the hall and said to Olivia, as though
nobly amused, "I seem to be specializing today in you streamlined
Yankee scholars. You are all so very brisk about cartelizing
facts and diagrams that you make a shy old British putterer like
me seem incorrigibly provincial.</p>

<p>"This young gentleman who has charged in with you is Professor
Lundsgard--Professor <i>Lorenzo</i> Lundsgard--till recently the
French and Spanish don at Huguenot University, which is somewhere
in your Southern states.</p>

<p>"He has resigned, and I understand that he is to devote
himself to the study of our wistful Italian culture, which
nowadays is so unused to being wooed by anyone so resolute and
twittering with dawn as you two acolytes--you three. In his
letter introducing Professor Lundsgard, a man who calls himself
President Sleman of Huguenot informs me that our youthful friend
is a 'stimulating teacher and an accomplished scholar, who will
stir up the sleeping Tuscan lions.' That is a spectacle that I
shall very much enjoy. . . . Dr. Lundsgard, this your rival
lion-stirrer, Dr. Olivia Lomond of the University of--Winnemac, I
believe it is called. Oh. And Mr. Chart."</p>

<p>Then he let them go in to lunch. Lady Belfont was also there,
though this is noted, like the day's temperature, only as a
matter of record.</p>

<p>As they wavered in to face the butler and the footman,
standing like the Sphinx and the largest pyramid, Hayden noted
how gallantly Lundsgard smiled at Olivia, and how sharply he
sized her up. Her smile in return was warmed by a flirtatiousness
which six weeks ago she would have denounced as cheap. He saw,
too, how the beige vicuna sweater which Lundsgard wore for
waistcoat managed on his hearty torso to get itself to look like
chain mail, and how the sun through the lofty windows brought out
metallic lights in his rough, corn-colored hair.</p>

<p>The five of them, plus the inescapable Marchesa Valdarno, sat
prim about the refectory table of Irish oak, eating their molds
of rice with duck livers served on English plates with views of
Kent, while Belfont, with what he felt to be gentlemanly but
learned humor, pumped Lundsgard, who answered with good-hearted
simplicity.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't claim to be any kind of a real scholar,
Sir Henry. Fact, in college, I was more devoted to football, but
I had a sneaking worship for learning, especially old history.
Like a dumb farmer seeing a vision of chariots in the August sky,
and not daring to even try and explain them. Oh, I did get my Phi
Beta Kappa key, along with my letter in two sports, but that was
an accident."</p>

<p>("This fellow is probably my own age, but he seems much
fresher and younger," thought Hayden, and looked anxiously at
Olivia, who was fixed on Lundsgard, her lips open.)</p>

<p>"In the War I served in North Africa; a very high-ranking
corporal I was, till they demoted me to second looey, and I got
laid up with nothing more than a fool machine-gun wound in one
foot. While I was convalescing, I got acquainted with French
caf&eacute; society there and learned a little of the lingo. Then
I got hit again, really awful light, but they invalided me out
and I went home and got my Ph.D. in Romance languages--never very
good at them, either! But I got a job teaching in that little
university and, by coaching football and taking the president's
son out duck-hunting, I got by.</p>

<p>"Then a sort of ridiculous thing happened. I was spending a
Christmas vacation with a friend, and right out of the blue, a
movie producer offered me a job acting--as a young cop in a Big
City picture, and then couple of Westerns. Seemed like
preposterously big salary: three-fifty a week. Dollars, not
cents! Now here's the funny thing. It wasn't at any college but
on the lot in Hollywood that I first heard the Gospel of Beauty,
from a grand old script writer who had been a playwright in
Hungary.</p>

<p>"I started reading about the Middle Ages, and then by chance,
which is sometimes so kind to a heavy-handed duffer like me, I
was in a Middle Ages costume play, and I was sold on history
complete. The actor and halfback scholar!"</p>

<p>Lundsgard thundered with laughter, in which they vaguely
joined.</p>

<p>("Olivia is looking at him like a Fond Mother.")</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a fighting fool for study. Sir Henry, I've read all
your essays on Tuscan Art, and personally I think they're much
more profound than Bernard Berenson. Much!"</p>

<p>Sir Henry looked lavish. That made two people who thought
so.</p>

<p>"I have a pretty definite idea in coming here. I want to
prepare myself to give the undisciplined people of the United
States a Message of the sublime importance of authority, and I
want to hand on to them at the same time the lofty philosophy of
St. Thomas Aquinas, the magnificence of Lorenzo, the reverence of
Savonarola, and through it all, the superworldly quality of
Leadership."</p>

<p>"Ah," condescended Sir Henry.</p>

<p>"And in America, where any garageman thinks himself just as
good as a bank president, we so lack the phenomenon of sanctified
and yet forceful Leadership. And as a pioneer, I may do something
to create it."</p>

<p>("The man is a fool. But Olivia looks as if she likes him. But
cannibal sandwich with laurel trimmings is not my meat.")</p>

<p>"All of you clever people," said Lundsgard, "will think I am a
ridiculous bumpkin, but I do have some plans that are awfully
exciting. My agent is planning a huge lecture tour for me, on six
subjects, including Mysticism and Leadership and--and this is
something new--the lectures are to be tied in with a feature
movie, which I am to script, about the Medicis, with the lead
played by Rupert Osgoswold--or possibly by your humble
servant!"</p>

<p>Olivia muttered, so softly that it was heard only by Hayden,
"Very exciting!"</p>

<p>Lundsgard caroled on, "The president of Cornucopia Films--do
you know that outfit, Sir Henry?"</p>

<p>"My boy, I am much too secluded and timid to understand the
neologies of the cinema, but it does happen that my Man of
Business, in London, has invested some small sums for me in
Cornucopia."</p>

<p>"Well, that's dandy. Maybe you'll be interested in the fact
that the president of Cornucopia is going to town on this, and
he's advanced a big wad to finance my work here. Being such a
stupid guy and having so little time, I have to depend on
assistants--photographers and secretaries and researchers and so
on. But Cornucopia agrees with me that we must not think of this
as a money-making project--though I got to admit that it'll
probably bring me in several thousand bucks a week! But we think
of it as a public service, to improve the mental stamina and
subtlety of America. A great friend of my father and, I am
honored to say, of mine, a United States Senator who carries a
lot of weight on the Foreign Relations Committee, believes that
my crusade for more authority and leadership might both elevate
our restless American morals and improve our standing everywhere
abroad. That goes to show there are people who see our crying
need!</p>

<p>"Sir Henry, I realize how fortunate I am to be allowed to see
the Villa Satiro. I have read a little of its history as well as
the book of its present owner. I am honored!"</p>

<p>Lundsgard turned on Sir Henry, on the Marchesa Valdarno, on
Olivia a smile full of soul and sunshine, the smile of a brave
young ambassador who loves battle and smitings, but also loves
little children and quotations from <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>
He chanted, "By myself, I never could learn much of the Middle
Ages. I am too much the energetic outdoor man. What I'd like to
do, Sir Henry, is to ask an occasional question of a veteran like
you, and perhaps of Dr. Lomond, of whose accomplishments I have
heard."</p>

<p>In a quarter-hour of well-padded if not particularly
well-turned sentences, Sir Henry said, Yes, the Middle Ages and
the Renaissance make clear the horrors of this so-called
Democracy. Civilization ended with the Fall of the Bastille.
Aristocracy means the Rule of the Best, and how sadly we need
that amid the clamorous and greedy herd of Britain, and no doubt
of your America.</p>

<p>To all this delirium Lundsgard listened with attention, and
Hayden reflected that good listeners are to good talkers as one
to ten.</p>

<p>His Olivia listened also.</p>

<p>Hayden had heard her hold forth on the wickedness of the
popularizers who condense a five-hundred-page book on Einstein
into a two-page article including three racy anecdotes and a
thumb-nail drawing of a relativitized cow. She liked her books
thick and close-printed and accurate about their geography, and
she had demanded that everybody else like them the hard way, too.
And she was now looking tenderly at a man who was going to
lecture on philosophy in the Rose Bowl.</p>

<p>Sir Henry was bestowing on Lundsgard an invitation to frequent
his villa, use his books, come and have lunch with Prince Ugo.
"And I shall write to the president of Cornucopia," said Sir
Henry, "my approval of your Crusade."</p>

<p>Running over with gratitude, Lundsgard took leave. Olivia
burst out, "Have you a taxi coming, Mr. Lundsgard? I'm sure Mr.
Chart would be glad to give you a lift in his funny little
flivver."</p>

<p>"Splendid, Doctor; much obliged," said Lundsgard.</p>

<p>But Hayden was thinking, "It isn't funny and it isn't a
flivver. It has a powerful motor and sweet steering, and how
you're going to get your fat carcass into it, Lundsgard, I don't
know." But aloud, "Surely. Of course. Thank you for a beautiful
lunch--Lady Belfont."</p>

<p>He remembered how generous to guests Caprice had been with
<i>his</i> cigarettes, his Scotch, even his fine large linen
handkerchiefs; how she would insist to a guest after a party, at
three on a winter morning, "Oh, don't phone--Hay will be
<i>glad</i> to drive you home!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>15</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>By sitting sidewise in the back of the topolino and not daring
to breathe, Lundsgard was perilously carted down into town.
Olivia turned her head to discourse with him most of the way,
while Hay drove and sulked. She commented:</p>

<p>"I do think your plan is a little wild, Mr. Lundsgard, but . .
."</p>

<p>Lundsgard shouted, "Listen, baby, I hate this formality among
us Yanks, even when we're in Europe. I wish you'd call me
Lorenzo, or maybe Lorry. I'm certainly going to call you Livy,
even if you are a top-flight history shark, and if your boy
friend don't slap me down for it, I'll call him Hay. Okay, Doc?
Be friendly to the poor cowboy minnesinger."</p>

<p>She giggled. She said, "Very well."</p>

<p>Never had Hayden called her anything more loose than Olivia;
never, he remembered, even in tenderness, had she called him
anything but Mr. Chart and then Hayden.</p>

<p>"But Lorry," she burst out, "do you actually think you can
make ecclesiastical art and thought as simple to Main Street as
the rules of croquet?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but it's worth taking a shot. Holy smoke, don't
you think all this deep stuff, even in my bum version of it, will
be better for the American hoi pollois than a lot of crime and
sex stories? Huh, darling?"</p>

<p>And to Hay's profound gloom, the tawny lily, the one-time nun
of learning, answered, "Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Say, folks," Mr. Lundsgard gurgled, "from all I can learn,
the average age of the Anglo-American Colony here must be about
sixty-five. Kick me out if I get intrusive, but I do hope I'm
going to be friendly with you young brats.</p>

<p>"Say, come see my office at the Excelsior. Maybe it'll hand
you a good laugh. It's pretty commercial for a highbrow crusader,
but if I'm going to collect as many facts about Florence in
couple months as that old gasbag, Belfont, has in maybe twenty
years, I've got to have a regular assembly-belt. I've got Rome
down cold in my notes and snapshots, and some Venice and Ravenna,
and now it's Florry's turn. . . . Listen, I sound brash, but I'm
awful in earnest. Come on!"</p>

<p>Mr. Lundsgard was extremely appealing, yet all the while his
sun-shot basso was extremely dominating. He leaned forward to pat
Olivia's shoulder, and the priestess of the chill twilight let
his hand lie there for a minute.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From a second bedroom in Lundsgard's large suite at the
Excelsior, all bedroom furniture had been removed, and he had
turned it into one of the briskest offices Hayden had ever
seen.</p>

<p>At a typewriter on the newest thing in extra-sized green steel
typists' desks, with a dictation phonograph beside her, a young
woman secretary was working. On an oak table in the center were
at least fifty books on Italian history, with quarterly reviews
in four languages--not looking much perused. An enormous
filing-cabinet had on its various drawers such tasty but
unexpected labels as "Anecdotes of Famous Dukes," "Clothing,
Houses &amp; Dec.," "Jewels &amp; Furs," "Manners, Morals in Med.
Courts," "Beautiful Bits from Poets, Philosophers," "Hunting
Leopards, Falcons, Methods of Execution," "Horses, Heroism."</p>

<p>On one wall was a bulletin board to which a youngish Italian
with dark hair and a wise, thin face was pinning snapshots of
Florentine palaces, city walls, armor from the museums. He looked
like an educated cousin of Vito Zenzero, a cousin who could read
the telephone book without moving his lips.</p>

<p>"This is Angelo Gazza, my photographer--best photographer in
Italy," said Lundsgard. "Born here in Florry, but lived in
England, and chummed with the Yankee troops here. Speaks English
by the book. He saves my life. I see a historic bit, or quaint,
beautiful or native. I always have Angelo following me and Snap!
and he gets the local color for me even better than my notes. . .
. Angelo, this is Dr. Lomond and Mr. Chart. They'll give us a lot
of pointers about what to see in Florry. We'll be plenty grateful
to 'em."</p>

<p>Gazza nodded. If he was grateful now, he did not show it.</p>

<p>Nor was the secretary, when Lundsgard introduced her,
particularly cordial. She had a fine face, but it was too
varnished, too reminiscent of the Marchesa Valdarno, and her hair
was a slide of smooth ash-blond. She seemed hard and competent,
but the near-green eyes which sized up Olivia had in them
resentment and suffering.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Hoxler, Evelyn Hoxler, or Mrs. Baccio, if you
prefer. She's true-blue American, but she's lived here for years;
married to a fine young Italian businessman, friend of mine, Art
Baccio; lives in Rome. She just loves this art work. Hey,
Evelyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Hoxler, and it was as sullen a sound as the
cry of a marsh bird.</p>

<p>"She's unquestionably the finest stenog in Italy, in both
Italian and English. She never forgets an engagement--or lets me
forget one. Hey, Evelyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Miss Hoxler, and went back to typing, and the
machine sounded profane.</p>

<p>"Well, children, we'll go in and have a drink."</p>

<p>Mr. Lundsgard markedly did not include Gazza or Miss Hoxler in
his invitation.</p>

<p>He shut the door between the office and his living room. A
portable bar had been set up; one rich in bourbon, rye and French
brandy. As he mixed a highball, Lundsgard snarled, "That
confounded Hoxler woman is a good machine-pounder, but she's
getting altogether too independent for my taste. I guess she
misses her husband, though he's the most wishy-washy excuse for a
man you ever saw. I found a job for him, in an office, but do you
think he appreciates it? Well, a man who tries to do something
for mankind gets to expect ingratitude. The real trouble with
most folks is that they haven't got any insight."</p>

<p>And Olivia apparently agreed.</p>

<p>Lundsgard was bountiful in suggestions for things they three
could do together: excursions to near-by villages; and if Hayden
was not enthusiastic about the implication that he and his good
little topolino would be at their constant service, Olivia was.
None of Lundsgard's jolly objectives was new to her but she
greeted them with apparent surprise and delight.</p>

<p>That night, late, in Hayden's room, he was as harsh with her
as his tenderness would permit. She was tired, her eyes were
print-tired, and she stretched out in his deepest chair, relaxed,
while he sat primly straight and interrogated her, with an ugly
memory of a time when he had investigated a wartime carpenter
suspected of sabotage.</p>

<p>"You like this fellow, Lundsgard?"</p>

<p>"Like him, dear? How do you mean? He has so much buoyancy and
freshness. They're really charming to a tired old lady like me,
and even his amusing ignorances. He's so naive."</p>

<p>"That's your favorite word."</p>

<p>"Well, it's the favorite quality among the few men who are
attracted by a dried-up old maid like me."</p>

<p>"Not noticeably dried-up now!"</p>

<p>They smiled together.</p>

<p>"'Livy!' This fellow is a clinker. We may see too much of
him," protested Hayden.</p>

<p><i>Clinker</i> was one of their private words. It had been an
invention of Hayden, along with smoocher, and he had worked out a
<i>Doctrine of Clinkers.</i> He may have been thinking of
pre-oil-heating days and how hard it was to get a burnt-out coal,
a clinker, out of a furnace grate.</p>

<p>Clinkers are those newly arrived persons, not friends or their
close kin or people likely to become friends, but acquaintances
of twenty years back, or friends of friends of friends, or
complete strangers, who come bounding into your particular
Florence or your Newlife with letters of introduction, or merely
with a telephone call or a note on hotel stationery, announcing,
"You've probably never heard of me but I know the sister-in-law
of the nephew of a <i>great</i> friend of yours. I'm here only
for three days, but I thought I might have the pleasure of
shaking your hand and buying you a cocktail."</p>

<p>Which, in Florence, meant that they expected a free cocktail,
a free meal, an escorted tour of the city, and perhaps
introductions to Prince Ugo and Sam Dodsworth. They would also
accept a trip to Siena and your assistance in all their shopping.
As many clinkers came to Newlife as to Florence, but there, at
least, they could speak the language and buy their own
cigarettes.</p>

<p>It is the supposition of all clinkers that the chief purpose
of any Americans in coming all the way to Florence is to spend
all his time there with fellow Americans.</p>

<p>In the Doctrine of Clinkers there is no implication that
clinkers are persons of low manners. They may be virtuous
lodge-members and favorite honorary pall-bearers, soft-voiced and
informed about astronomy and the history of West Point. But in
quantities of more than one a season, they are appalling
nuisances.</p>

<p>Frequently they believe that they are being benefactors to
what they call "lonely exiles." One of them clacked to Hayden on
the telephone, "Course I've never met you, but I said to myself,
'What the hell! Hay'll be tickled to death to see an American
face, I guess!'"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Olivia sat up to protest, "That's unfair. Lorry isn't a
clinker. He's going to stay here and be one of us--whatever that
means--delicate connoisseurs, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing delicate about your 'Lorry.' Playful he is,
powerful he is, and a good drinking-man. He'll die of apoplexy at
fifty. But delicate? No!"</p>

<p>"So much the better! He won't just dabble in art criticism.
He's going at it with an earnestness and yet a humility that may
take him far. He's really touching. And he doesn't take himself
too seriously; he has a divine, rough humor about his own
deficiencies. He may become quite a fair scholar."</p>

<p>"Maybe--if he isn't entirely a charlatan."</p>

<p>"Why are you so intolerant?"</p>

<p>"With this fellow, frankly, I'm a little jealous of him. I
didn't expect you--oh, you say you're changed, but it wasn't so
long ago that you were the coolest judge of bumptiousness I ever
met, and I didn't expect you to get so girlish over a ham actor
playing a professor. A real crush!"</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh!"</p>

<p>"I agree."</p>

<p>"Honestly, Hayden, you astonish me, being jealous when I'm
merely amused by the antics of a good-hearted climber. I take
Lorry about as seriously as I do that cocker spaniel we always
meet on the Tornabuoni. I probably wouldn't recognize Lorry if I
saw him tomorrow."</p>

<p>She did protest too much, thought Hayden. Was there a faint
stink of treachery? He urged:</p>

<p>"I'd better get my patent on you filed, quick."</p>

<p>"What am I? An invention?"</p>

<p>"Of the devil! There is a sort of theory that we are engaged
to be married, which seems to me a surprisingly good idea, but we
have never much discussed when or what afterward. Can't we be
married this summer, and take a look at the Alps and maybe
Austria, and then in the fall we'll decide whether we want to go
home or stay on in Europe? What about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing, though I do think one of the charms of our
friendship has been that we haven't had a lot of family around to
drive us into a marital schedule, so they can order their wedding
garments early. Can't we still just drift, for a while yet?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>It was not her evasiveness which dismayed him but the
discovery in himself of relief that she was evading fixed terms,
and that he was not yet going to be tied down to
definiteness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If it had not been for the threat to Olivia's unstable
emotions, he might have liked Lundsgard for his backwoods humor.
The three had comfortable outings at the enticing country
restaurants at Maiano and Pratolino and St. Casciano and sat
there on outdoor terraces for hours. Olivia mockingly called
Lundsgard the "Dazzling Dane" and explained to him that it is not
enough to qualify as an authority to know that Italy is a
peninsula and that the Medicis were bankers. Lundsgard took it
affably, and he danced with Olivia in arbors to the melody of
accordions.</p>

<p>He was taken up by the peerage of the American Colony with
unexpected speed. He had a way of telling retired gentlemen whose
only vocabularies were of the Stock Exchange how profound they
were about international politics, and of looking at their wives
with reverence and surprise. He had a competent game of bridge, a
neatness in mixing drinks, a skill in listening to symptoms,
which caused Hayden to wonder if his story of untutored country
boyhood was quite truthful.</p>

<p>On his own, Lundsgard gave a party which marked him as not
just an acceptable eighth for dinner, but as a social factor of
merit. He hired three suites at the Excelsior for the evening; in
one, he had the bridge-players, in one the more thoughtful
boozers, in the third there was dancing to a Swiss orchestra in
Bulgarian costumes playing Brazilian tunes. Even the testiest
Colonists advanced from bridge to the bar and a few even to the
samba, and Lundsgard was considered a man of the rarest
parts.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the juicy seventeen-year-old granddaughters of the
exiled bankers, who now and then visited Florence, clamored for
the presence of Lundsgard.</p>

<p>Along with the pillars, Lundsgard got in with the dubious and
unexplained who make up an interesting part of all the foreign
colonies in Florence and of the Italians who are close to them:
mysterious owners of villas gorgeous but secluded; ex-officials
of the Allied Military Government who had been minor clerks
before War II and millionaires afterward; royalty in exile;
Italians in whose presence it was not considered tactful to
mention dope-running; men sometimes grave and solid seen usually
with men young and pretty.</p>

<p>In Florence, even the patently proper British and Americans
are often inexplicable. With so many demure ladies you never
quite know whether they are widows, divorced or still married and
of what sort their husbands' grandparents had been. And with all
these (since he did not, like Hayden, have to stay home evenings
and study, having his Miss Evelyn Hoxler to do that for him)
Lundsgard cruised, blithe and free, generally popular, and Hayden
reflected that there is no more useful pose than that of the
honest yokel of whom it would be a shame to take advantage.</p>

<p>However much Hayden doubted Lundsgard, it was a season when
clinkers were trooping into town, and any tested permanent
acquaintance was a refuge. Olivia and Hayden and Lundsgard
escaped from tourists on frequent mountain picnics, and it was on
one of these that Hayden's suspicions of Olivia and Lundsgard
forced him to recognize them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>16</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Lundsgard was a skilled picnic guest. He scrupulously fetched
his share of the lunch, paid for his share of the gasoline, and
once, when there was a tire to be changed, he pushed Hayden aside
and did all the changing. . . . Hayden ungratefully thought that
their family Tristan was somewhat too buoyant and powerful about
it. Though probably a year older than Hayden, he contrived to
look more youthful.</p>

<p>Nowadays he usually called Olivia "Sister," "Cookie" or
"Helena Troy."</p>

<p>They picknicked today up above Settignano in a grove of olive
and apple trees, with a venerable castle nearby, and the towers
and low houses of Florence far below. Throughout lunch--cold duck
and bread and butter and red wine and cheese with dates and
raisins--Lundsgard was jovially teasing Olivia about her
feebleness. He insisted that she had studied so much that she was
unable now to walk two blocks. She lost all detachment and
shouted at Lundsgard, as though he were some one whom it was
important to impress, that in college she could have been woman
track champion if she had taken the time for training.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's see how good you are, Cutie!" bellowed Lundsgard.
"I'll race you down to that old olive tree with the trunk rotted
through."</p>

<p>It is not at all certain that Lundsgard let her win the race;
he was a little cumbersome and wavering, while the Diana of the
Laurentian Library was astonishingly fleet. She did win, and they
came back up the hillside laughing, innocently swinging hand in
hand. But the uncomfortable Hayden wondered whether it <i>was</i>
so innocent. There are things other than purloined letters that
are most artfully concealed by exposing them. But the two
returned to him so clear-eyed and so candidly laughing that he
felt rebuked.</p>

<p>He and his suspicions had it out at three o'clock that night.
He had awakened in the darkness to a memory which tore at him, of
Olivia's eyes utterly fixed on this lout, the tip of her tongue
moving against her upper lip.</p>

<p>He could not sleep again. Could he ever sleep again?</p>

<p>In his old dressing-gown and soft worn Pullman slippers he
padded over to the marble-topped table and, with his little Meta
stove, he made coffee, served with condensed milk.</p>

<p>No, he thought calmly, he was not the typical suspicious
husband, with a vanity which made him surprised that his wife
could like any other male at all, when she was so blessed as to
have <i>his</i> divine favor. There was no suspicion about it; he
was coldly and wretchedly sure that Olivia could surrender to
this lusty Lundsgard animal; the question was whether she had
done so now, and whether she would now go on succumbing to a
dreary line of sneak thieves afterward.</p>

<p>"I coaxed her out of the cold tomb and warmed her. Did I do
that only for the benefit of Lundsgard and his successors?"</p>

<p>Then, "Oh, what nonsense! To be so sick-jealous you can't
stand her even laughing with a lively acquaintance! She's as
single-minded in love as . . .</p>

<p>"She's a reckless fool, she's uncontrollable when she takes a
fancy to a man. I'd like to hear Professor Leslie Vintner's
version of their affair! At least, Caprice was dependable that
way. She never more than flirted at a dance. . . . I don't think
she did. . . . Of course there are some flabby, whimpering
individuals who were born to be cuckolded. . . . Oh, go back to
bed, Chart! Can't you get enough torture without making a hobby
of it?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When the three lunched next, Hayden could not resist probing
the campus Casanova about his opinion of this recently discovered
world-menace, Sex.</p>

<p>Lundsgard had often confided that he had never been married,
and now he was frank and unsparing of himself. He had been
fervently engaged, he said, to a "cute little chick and awful
smart" at Huguenot University, but he admitted that in his
ruthless youth he had been cruel to this young lady. He had
scolded her for not rising to the splendor of his ambition to be
a lord of learning--at several thousand dollars a week.</p>

<p>"I was kind of raw and unsympathetic, I reckon. I wasn't a big
enough, rich enough soul then to appreciate a gentle little saint
like Bessie and be patient with her."</p>

<p>But his humility quickly ran out, and he hinted that in
Hollywood and Rome he had been favored by the handsomest and most
befurred women. And Olivia, Hayden marked, was not angered by
this rakishness. She listened to Lundsgard's advertising without
one of the crisp comments, flavored with mustard and pepper and
ice, for which she had once been dreaded. "I'd better get her out
to Newlife quick!" thought Hayden.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the Tre Corone, now, she did not merely tolerate Vito's
insinuating croons. Hayden heard Vito mutter that they might go
out to a night club, and though she refused, she was not
haughty.</p>

<p>Even at the Villa Satiro, to which they were often invited for
lunch now, along with Lundsgard, she was not above a sly
confidence with Sir Henry, who wagged his fat back and leaned
over her with the coyness of a distinguished circus elephant.</p>

<p>Hayden was bored by Belfont's ponderous way of being salacious
by referring to the reprehensible doings of the less respectable
Grecian gods. Hayden wondered whether Olivia would be spiritually
advancing or declining if she switched from Lundsgard's
boisterous salesmanship to Sir Henry's soggy glory. Yet now, when
he was most distressed by her base transmutation, Hayden was most
held by her ardent love, and the once simple Tre Corone
boarding-house had become for him a splendor of heaven edged with
infernal gloom.</p>

<p>Then the cable from his partner, Jesse Bradbin, from
Newlife:</p>

<p>"Big deal pending you required stop. Big dough quit being
irresponsible come home next boat."</p>

<p>It tempted him to think of leaving paradise and all the heavy
proprieties demanded in an angel, and of being busy and important
in Newlife again; of not having to remember historical dates or
impress the Dodsworths or shepherd his ewe lamb lest she fall
over the most obvious cliffs. He could smell the Rocky Mountain
air, heady with sage instead of olives. And he owed something to
his fatuous yet devoted partner. But to love Olivia was more
important even than to snatch contracts from his worthy rivals in
business.</p>

<p>He refreshed his love by reviewing the virtues of Olivia.
Remember, he coached himself, what unexampled beauty and courage
and knowledge she has. You must be patient while she is getting
over her first real fling, which she takes so much the worse
because, at nearly thirty, she's new to it.</p>

<p>Would Jesse Bradbin ever give up anything he greatly wanted
for him?</p>

<p>His cabled lie was warm and polite.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was harder for him to snub Lundsgard because the man, with
a breezy humbleness, was always turning to him for advice. And
once he said, "I wish you'd get in on some of this movie dough,
Hay, by doing a little research for me, in your spare time."</p>

<p>It was amiably said and amiably refused.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>17</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They were dining, Hayden and Olivia, with Nat Friar and his
love, Mrs. Shaliston Baker. The dinner, served on Nat's
living-room table imperfectly cleared of books and the chess set,
was as good as ever, with curried shrimp and tiny strawberries,
but Nat was less bland. He was restless, he spilled the wine, and
Ada Baker watched him nervously, like a little old cat watching
its good but alarming friend, the woolly setter. Their example
made Hayden and Olivia unusually gentle with each other. When Nat
said, "After you two young people are married, as Ada and I have
never had the courage to be, you mustn't stay in the cautious
splendor of Florence but try the world," then Olivia put out her
hand, to let it lie relaxed in Hayden's.</p>

<p>Hayden explained the tidal phenomenon of Lorenzo Lundsgard,
whom Nat had never seen. "He has depressing energy and touching
reverence. It might interest you to meet him, Nat."</p>

<p>"So that I may then re-enact the very sensible and enjoyable
egotism of the Pharisee in gloating, 'Thank God I am not as these
tourists'?"</p>

<p>"Why not? By the way, Lundsgard sounded me out about making
some money on the side as part-time researcher for him. I turned
it down."</p>

<p>"What," wondered Nat, "is a researcher?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"Young gentleman, I am a frowsty old bachelor. I am also a
lie-abed and a secret drinker. I know what research is: something
unpleasant that men in white jackets, like barbers, do to dogs in
dungeon laboratories. But I don't know what a researcher is."</p>

<p>"He goes out and does the marketing."</p>

<p>"You say that this Dr. Lundsgard," fretted Nat, "would like a
researcher in medieval folkways?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Bring him in two facts and he'll cook them into a whole
lecture."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he could use me, Hayden?"</p>

<p>"Could a village bank 'use' J. Pierpont Morgan? Could a
popular preacher 'use' an archangel?"</p>

<p>"The answer is not necessarily 'yes' in either case. Their
methods might be different. But the fact is . . ."</p>

<p>Nat spoke heavily, looking down into his beard.</p>

<p>"This may be the last dinner I shall ever give. My cable has
finally come, refusing reprieve: the company to which I so
cannily switched all my funds, not long ago, has failed. My
income is finished. I need a job. This is the first time I have
ever said, 'I need a job.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker cried out and she, the fragile and prudent, ran to
Nat and shamelessly sat on his knee, her head against his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have been too cowardly to tell Ada till I should be
fortified by the presence of you strong barbarians. Yes, with
considerable ingenuity, I have managed to lose every cent I
had."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker said harshly, "Nonsense! You have all that I
have."</p>

<p>"But you haven't anything, my beloved; just enough to exist
on. It doesn't matter. For some time I have been preparing for
this. I haven't paid my rent for six months, and my poor servant,
I haven't paid her now for two months and two days, and this past
week she has been bringing me in vegetables from her brother, who
is a market-gardener and a reader of Petrarch. He is really our
host, this evening, but this is the last time I shall impose on
him. By the way, he speaks with an interesting Livornese accent
with a word, now and then, that I cannot spot except as a Greek
survival. . . . Oh, Ada, Ada, don't, my dear!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker was sobbing, close against him, all her pride and
frail austerity gone.</p>

<p>"It's not so bad, Ada. It's a new adventure. I shall now work
according to other people's notions of what my usefulness may be,
instead of my own. If there is anything here, or even back in the
States, that I can do that is not too honest or too cultural, I
shall do it gladly. Meantime, Hayden, do you think this Dr.
Lundsgard might hire me for a season? I am very punctual and
tidy--well, reasonably. And at my age, I shall come very
cheap."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hayden telephoned to Lundsgard that there was a chance he
might be able to get the renowned Professor Friar to give him
some "material," and of course Dr. Friar was one of only eleven
men living who knew European History minute by minute, acre by
acre, from 400 A.D. to 1800.</p>

<p>Lundsgard was excited. "I have some of Dr. Friar's articles
cut out. You honestly think he might brief me? How would I get to
meet him? Should I go and call on him at his home? Would you be
willing to take me there?"</p>

<p>Hayden reflected that the shabbiness of Nat's living room
would cut a hundred dollars a week off his market value, and he
said hastily, "No, I think that as you would be his superior
officer, it would be protocol for him to call on you."</p>

<p>"I don't insist on form, with a big shot like him, though of
course good form--well, you know how it is. Good form is one of
the things that I intend to take back to the States, along with
philosophy; I mean the super-high-tone good form, like Ugo's. So
maybe . . . But ask the Prof to pick his own hour to come here.
Does he ever sneak in a drink?"</p>

<p>"If you had some very dry sherry for him, I think he might
take a sip."</p>

<p>"I'll have some so dry he'll think it's from Kansas."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nat Friar put on his one good gray suit, he washed and combed
his beard, he had a hefty glass of cognac at home, he looked
Olympian and felt even better. But in Lundsgard's suite he spoke
with mild delicacy and only touched the glass of offertory
sherry.</p>

<p>Hayden fretted to himself, "Nat and I are selling the most
honest goods on the market, and yet we're somehow being fakes. I
don't like selling one's own self--for Nat or for Olivia or for
me."</p>

<p>Encouraged by Lundsgard, Nat started on long tales of the old
Italy: Amadeo the Green Count; Pope Anacletus II, who was of the
great Jewish family of the Pierleoni; that poet and gallant,
Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who was to become Pope Pius II, to
build the mountain village of Pienza as his monument and to lead
a crusade; the Wolf of Gubbio, a beast wolf not a human one, who
was converted and became a practising Christian; Clarice Strozzi,
who cursed the tyrants out of the Medici Palace. The stories were
as full of gaiety as they were of erudition, and Lundsgard was in
ecstasy. He humbly addressed Nat as "sir," and he kept
ejaculating over the chronicles, "Why, that's corking, sir,
that's superb, that's just what I need!"</p>

<p>Hayden wondered why Lundsgard did not take notes, till he
discovered that the door to the office was part open and that in
there Evelyn Hoxler was thriftily getting it all down in
shorthand.</p>

<p>Lundsgard hesitated, "I know of course, sir, that if you cared
to give me your invaluable aid for a month or so, I couldn't even
begin to pay you what such priceless learning is worth. But would
a hundred and fifty dollars a week somewhat compensate you?"</p>

<p>Hayden was certain that Nat would not know whether that was
fabulously large or pitifully small, and he stepped in with, "Why
Lundsgard, you ought certainly to pay him at least two hundred a
week!"</p>

<p>Lundsgard's glance was very sharp, somewhat resentful, and he
said curtly, "We'll make it one-seventy-five."</p>

<p>"That sounds very nice," beamed Nat.</p>

<p>With no further "sirs," Lundsgard ordered, "Professor, you
start in here next Monday morning, nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Nine? Nine in the <i>morning?</i> Very well," said Nat
disconsolately.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All day long--that is, from nine-thirty or ten or eleven, when
he arrived, and leaving out the hour that he took off now and
then when he went out for a drink--in an old velvet jacket and an
antique straw gardening hat with which he shaded his eyes, Nat
sat happily dictating anecdotes out of the most unhackneyed
(though reasonably accurate) history.</p>

<p>He thought the dictation machine was the most patient ear he
had ever found. He sat with the mouthpiece tucked into his beard,
smiling at the machine and making explanatory gestures in its
direction, telling it about kings and cardinals as though it was
likely already to have heard a great deal about them. Nat paid no
attention at all to Lundsgard's visitors, such as smoochers who
came in to sell Lundsgard original Botticellis for twenty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>Translated into lire, which just now were about six hundred to
the dollar, Nat's hundred and seventy-five dollars a week seemed
to him like Babylonian wealth. He paid his debts to his servant
and her brother, he gave a little something to his landlord, and
he bought for himself a fine purple corduroy smoking-jacket with
pockets large enough to carry books. For Hayden he bought an
Aldine Aristophanes and for Mrs. Shaliston Baker, a silver
tea-caddy.</p>

<p>Lundsgard never criticized Nat for unpunctuality. He just read
page on page of medieval oddities transcribed by Evelyn Hoxler
from Nat's recorded prattle, and chuckled, "My dear Professor
Friar, you come awful dear, but you sure are a treasure!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Lundsgard is a very kind man," said Nat to Hayden.</p>

<p>"I suppose he is."</p>

<p>"I just wonder why he took up the crabbed calling of being a
medievalist. He would have been so useful as a singing cowboy--if
he can sing."</p>

<p>"If he can punch cattle."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But always very kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes--yes, certainly--very kind."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>18</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the late afternoon, after office hours, Hayden went to see
Lundsgard. He thought he heard <i>"Avanti,"</i> when he tapped at
the outer door of the suite; he opened, and stood aghast. Beyond
the living room, in the office, Lundsgard could be heard talking
to Evelyn Hoxler:</p>

<p>"I've had enough of your bellyaching. Go on! Bawl! I like to
hear it, Eve. It makes you even homelier than when you put on the
white enamel and look like a madam. Lissen. You got no kick
coming at all. You knew what would happen just as well as I did.
In fact, you planned it. You hoped to get a wad of--well, call it
severance money out of me."</p>

<p>"Lorry, I didn't! I wanted to help Arturo. You made me feel
that anything I did for you, when you were so friendly with him,
was really for him."</p>

<p>"The loving Mrs. Baccio! The innocent Miss Hoxler! Just a
country babe! Say, I'd hate to write to the registrar in whatever
hayseed county you really come from and ask him your real birth
date!"</p>

<p>"Don't. Please, Lorry! I won't be angry any more."</p>

<p>"You're damn right you won't. Not around here you won't. And I
don't think you'll be around here at all, much longer."</p>

<p>Hayden hastened away, down the hotel corridor, more sick than
furious. There are maggots too vile to touch. And for tomorrow
there was to have been a giddy lunch with Lundsgard and
Olivia.</p>

<p>At the Tre Corone he found her, very cheerful, and he cried,
"Sweet, I want to call off tomorrow's lunch with Lundsgard."</p>

<p>"Why?" Her disappointment was clear.</p>

<p>"He isn't as decent a fellow as you thought. I've just heard
him talking to Eve Hoxler, viciously."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. At last! That woman has been trying to
nab him. She takes advantage of his good nature and his quite
charming reverence for women."</p>

<p>"Rev--Oh, good God!"</p>

<p>"Don't you ever have any argument but 'Good God'? Aside from
the blasphemy, it's a little undetailed."</p>

<p>"All right. We'll <i>have</i> our lunch with that felthead,
and I'll try to get him to show just how much reverence he really
has for your frail, cast-iron sex!"</p>

<p>At their lunch, at Paoli's, with what he felt to be silken
cunning, not looking at Olivia but being as cunning as a dove and
as innocent as a serpent, he challenged Lundsgard:</p>

<p>"You're always saying that women inspire you, and yet I wonder
what you really think about the ones like Olivia, who are so
independent?"</p>

<p>He wondered if the fault could have been Evelyn Hoxler's, when
he saw how grave and mature Lundsgard became:</p>

<p>"You won't like my sure-enough attitude, Hay, and Livy
won't."</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Hayden, and Olivia said, "Oh!"</p>

<p>"I'll have to give you my whole philosophy, and I'm not very
articulate, you might say. As I see it, the world has been going
through what you might call a multiple revolution, and the uppity
girl who thinks her whole family are dubs and the left-wing
agitator and the psychoanalyst and all these smeary modern
painters belong right together--all anarchists. But I figure
their seven-story revolution is over, all but the shouting. The
whole world wants authority and, you might call it, tradition.
New world coming!</p>

<p>"It'll first of all want <i>heroes</i> and not a gang of
statisticians and wisecracking critics. Unluckily for me, I'm not
big enough, or I'm too early, to be one of the star magnificoes,
but I can help clear the way for them--yes, and you just watch
'em ride in on a golden highway, with flags and trumpets!</p>

<p>"These guys that'll be the leaders, they'll have to have power
and responsibility. They'll want their orders obeyed on the jump,
though they'll be darned generous to their mob in return. They
may not wear any ten-ton armor, but they'll make my ancestor
Lorry the Magnificent, Serial One, look like a ribbon clerk.
They'll use chemistry and jet planes and atomic power, and their
slogan will be that only the best is good enough, and I guess
they'll be willing to get killed for it--and to kill!"</p>

<p>To all this souvenir-post-card Nietzsche, this 1905
pre-Hitlerism, Olivia was listening, with no hostility but with
fond amusement at her Lorry's enthusiasm. Encouraged by her if
not by Hayden, he boomed on:</p>

<p>"But all these high duties for the men leaders mean there's
got to be even higher duties for the women. A guy can't lead an
army and still stay at home and teach the Little Woman golf.
Nowadays the career woman, who was the big news even five years
ago, is as old-fashioned as a buggy whip. Now she's got a better
goal: to be loyal to men that got to be big enough to be loyal
to; to give herself in a real blazing devotion to helping carry
on her man's battle for supremacy; to lead the Leader. Can't you
<i>see</i> it, Livy? She won't get a professor's chair or a
slick, leather-covered desk in an advertising agency, but she'll
share a throne--and believe me, there's going to be thrones to
share! You bet! To be queen in her home isn't old-fashioned but
the most ultramodern, up-to-the-split-second, re-revolutionary
ideal there is!</p>

<p>"So go ahead and shoot me, both of you. Hay, you can report me
to all your revolutionary little friends for wanting to march all
the poor farmboys (like you and me both!) right back to their
peasant huts, unless they can get the Vision of Leadership and
obey it. Okay! I'm ready!"</p>

<p>Afterward, Hayden avoided discussing with Olivia this
scarlet-and-pea-green vision of Lundsgard, the view of the
noblest man as the mining-camp bully. If she had been unhappy
about it, he wanted to spare her; if she had liked it, he wanted
to spare himself.</p>

<p>And that same afternoon, Evelyn Hoxler, who had never talked
to Hayden by himself, telephoned asking him, and anxiously, to
meet her at Gilli's for a drink.</p>

<p>When he met her, there was something rigid and frightening
about Miss Hoxler. He had the impression of a rattlesnake in
ambush, and indeed there was a good deal of hiss in all her S's,
as she rapidly drank down Italian cognacs:</p>

<p>"Lundsgard is sending me sobbing back to Rome, and I asked to
see you, Mr. Chart, so I could try and do the stinker a little
harm before I go skipping back to commit suicide."</p>

<p>She did not strike Hayden as notably benevolent, and he
listened not too willingly to her hatred.</p>

<p>"I gave Lorry the best clerical assistance <i>he'll</i> ever
get and you've probably guessed--I never tried to hide it
especially--I gave him a lot more. He's a quick worker. When you
first meet him, if you can be useful, he'll love you, but the
moment he can get more out of sponging on somebody else's brains,
out you go, without even a handshake. When he gets to be a
dictator, he'll pull off some of the finest purges in history,
and then sleep like a baby.</p>

<p>"By the way, his first name isn't Lorenzo. His fond mother
named her golden-haired Viking rosebud Oley, and in college he
changed that to Lawrence, and he put on the Lorenzo, along with a
shot at English accent (when he remembers it) in Hollywood.</p>

<p>"I want to warn you, with the most evil intentions, that while
I don't think he's had much chance to fool with this conceited
young woman of yours, Miss Lomond, he's certainly licking his
chops."</p>

<p>"I think Dr. Lomond can take care of herself!"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> I can take care of <i>myself!</i> That don't do
you much good when the car hits a patch of grease like Lundsgard
and skids." The appositeness of it jarred Hayden and frightened
him. "Mr. Chart, I have a feeling you plan to get out of this
combination cocktail party and mental sanitarium they call the
American Colony and go home. Home! Beat it, fast, and take that
high-falutin sweetheart of yours along with you. So long. No
flowers!"</p>

<p>He met Angelo Gazza, Lundsgard's photographer, on the street,
and invited him to coffee. He blurted, "What sort of a chap is
this Lundsgard, really?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorenzaccio is all right. He's a pusher. Pays pretty good
but gets his money's worth and then some. . . . Say, you're fond
of Dr. Lomond, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Very. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she comes in to see Professor Friar and maybe Lundsgard
now and then and . . . She's trained too good, for <i>our</i>
shop. She wants us to get our facts--we do an import and export
business in historical facts--she wants 'em catalogued like a
history book, but Lundsgard tells her, 'Never mind the efficiency
stuff. This isn't a factory; this is a solar center for radiating
inspiration.' Dr. Lomond is very well informed--for an
American."</p>

<p>"You don't like us Americans, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, that's the hell of it. I love you. Best chum I ever had
was a master-sergeant from Brooklyn, half-Wop and half-Mick. I'd
like to live in America. That's why I keep panning you--to keep
safe from you hundred-and-eighty pound babies! Why are so many
Americans immature? Why don't you grow up? Half of you pulling
polysyllables, when 'I don't know' would do, and the other
half--medical majors and chaplains and flying colonels--talking
like high-school boys, 'Oh, Boy!' and 'Watch my smoke' and not
enthusiastic about anything except baseball and women.</p>

<p>"And the American woman is the only one I know of whose heart
and brain stay cold and indifferent to you while all the rest of
her body pretends to catch fire. An Italian or French woman
either loves you or she doesn't, but the American lady--she
kisses you hot at eight-thirty and looks at you cold at
eleven--or anyway at eight-thirty next morning. And yet I do
admire so your American enterprise. I am so sick of all the
Memorable Ruins in Italy.</p>

<p>"That's what has turned so many of us into guides and postcard
sellers. We could build the best ships and automobiles and
electrical equipment in the world, but our medieval gateways and
<i>palazzi municipali</i> gum up our city planning.</p>

<p>"I'd like to blow up every building in Italy older than 1890.
All you tourists shrieking that it's so cute of us to have
three-foot alleys for thoroughfares and yelling your heads off
when we put in broad boulevards like you all do at home. Oh, it's
probably real quaint in me to be descended from some Etruscan
gangster. . . . And I'll watch Dr. Lomond for you like a
sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"You think she needs it?"</p>

<p>"Lundsgard is one of these Leaders, and all Leaders think that
all the votes and the applause and the money and the women belong
to them. . . . Good luck! <i>Ciao!"</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Olivia was absent-minded at dinner and it was only after a
quarter-hour of mere thermometric conversation that she said,
"Lorry is going to fire that Hoxler woman."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In fact he has."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"He wants me to come in and help him out, three or four hours
a day, till he finds a new secretary."</p>

<p>"You can't do it! You absolutely can't!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to."</p>

<p>"You, the independent, and you want to be that fellow's
copyist!"</p>

<p>"I shall be nothing of the sort. I'll really be a
fellow-researcher with Uncle Nat, and I'll put the office files
in order--they need it. Or do you <i>insist</i> on my spending
all the rest of my life in libraries where nobody ever comes,
except displaced mice? Or perhaps you prefer to take advantage of
my extreme fondness for you by ordering me to go home!"</p>

<p>"I love you, and when you turn beastly, when you use arguments
that you know are crooked, I am helpless, Olivia--the only person
in the world that I am helpless with."</p>

<p>"I know. Forgive me. And honestly, you can just forget it.
It'll only be a few hours a day with Lorry for a few weeks."</p>

<p>"That seems to me too much, with <i>him!"</i></p>

<p>"But I need the money, Hay--Hayden. Maybe with your sharp
eyes, that can look right through a fat woman and see a ducky
bungalow and a two-thousand-dollar fee, you noticed, when you
first arrived here, that I hadn't many clothes, and most of them
kind of shabby. Well, I haven't a very large scholarship, and
I've been buying quite a wardrobe, entirely for you, and I am
busted."</p>

<p>"Then you must let me . . ."</p>

<p>"No! That much independence I'll still keep. No!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When the wildfire news ran round the hills that Signore il
Professor Friar was paying his debts, he was assaulted by bills a
year old, five years old, most of which he had forgotten and some
of which he did not owe. In particular, his landlord, long a
tolerant friend, once he saw the sheen of ten-thousand-lire notes
wanted to be paid to date, and his former intimates, the
book-sellers, threatened to cart off his library, beloved and a
quarter unpaid-for.</p>

<p>Nat refused to take even a loan from Mrs. Baker, who was
little more affluent than himself. He became grim. Now that he
had started, he would be businesslike.</p>

<p>He said to Hayden, "I would prefer, of course, to desert
Lundsgard, now that the adventure is rusty. I have no complaint
about him; he treats me well. He is the only man living who
thinks my information about Gubbio and Spoleto is worth listening
to, and that, to me, is grateful. Like many people weary with
knowledge, I have perhaps unduly esteemed the fresher wisdoms of
younger people, but this mental passion has rarely been
reciprocated--perhaps only by you and Olivia and Lundsgard. But I
have some difficulty in liking the fact that I am now part of a
cultural swindle.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure but that Dr. Lundsgard is a very bad man. He is
nimble at making historical parallels to prove that the rule of
plain unlettered men has always been disastrous, to prove that we
need louder-voiced millionaires to guide us. But to prove it, he
adulterates all the facts that I go down into the coal pit and
shovel up to him.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure but that it's what you call a racket, I'm not
sure but that he is in the soundest tradition of treason--treason
to love, to friendship, to patriotism, to religion, for the most
sensitive blessings are also the most interesting to betray. In
his case, he is making a cheerful activity of treason to
learning, like the journalists who trap invalids by praising
fraudulent medical discoveries.</p>

<p>"He is even developing prophetic illusions: that all history
has been moving toward a moral goal according to a discernible
scheme, and that he is the only man who can discern it. I have
studied a number of skilled methods of assassination which I
might use with him, but otherwise, what am I to do? Place your
charming girl, Olivia, under my arm and take to the Abruzzi caves
to escape my remaining creditors?</p>

<p>"I can see now where all my quandary started: paying my
servant, who is a true Italian peasant and never expected such an
insult from an <i>illustrissimo!"</i></p>

<p>But Nat did nothing. And Hayden did nothing, and suddenly he
was sick of Lundsgard and Florence and Europe. It can happen so
with exiles. One moment he loved Italy; the next, its ways seemed
antiquated and a little silly. He could not even hear the
language clearly. It was all an unaccented gabble. When he walked
in the evening, a group of sharp young loafers in front of a
movie theater--as dangerous as a like group in Concord,
Massachusetts--seemed to be his enemies, whispering, "Let's stab
that foreigner or chase him out of the country!"</p>

<p>That week, letters from home, from Jesse and Mary Eliza
Bradbin, from classmates whom he had not seen for ten years,
letters which had recently bored him by their weather reports and
the gossip about people whom he did not remember, were suddenly
precious salvation. When he had first come to Florence he had
gratefully used the hospitality of the governmental American
Library in the Palazzo Strozzi and read the American magazines,
the newspapers. He had later become almost indifferent to their
bulletins of a land so far off, but now he hastened back to them,
and they promised him the refuge of home.</p>

<p>That promised refuge he needed the more because daily he less
liked the relationship between Lundsgard and Olivia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Rich now in what he considered knowledge, in Nat's anecdotes
and Gazza's photographs, strong in the approval of Sir Henry
Belfont and the toleration of Sam Dodsworth, Mr. Lundsgard still
considered Hayden a decent fellow, but he no longer considered
his counsel of any merit, and when Hayden had an idea,
Lundsgard's attitude was "Yes, yes." He preferred to see Hayden
only in bars but, grimly risking snubs, Hayden frequently marched
into the wolf's den to find out how much of his lamb had been
devoured now.</p>

<p>He warned himself that Lundsgard's office was a busy place,
that he had no more right to intrude there than to stroll into an
operating-room and suggest having a cigarette with a performing
surgeon. They were not snubbing him--no, they were just busy. But
all he knew was that he got snubbed.</p>

<p>Nat beamed at him, but even the friendly Gazza seemed annoyed,
Lundsgard looked impatient, and Olivia, busy with lists of
Umbrian painters, snapped, "Oh, <i>must</i> you leave that door
open, Hayden dear?"</p>

<p>How patronizing and unlovely was her "Hayden dear" compared
with her tender "Dear Hayden"!</p>

<p>But he bullied Lundsgard and her into coming out to tea with
him. They were in the Piazza della Republica, outside of
Donnini's at a small table among Italian families prosperous and
voluble.</p>

<p>The researchers did not look at Hayden. Olivia was competently
answering Lundsgard's equally competent questions about the
wool-carders guild in ancient Florence. Hayden felt like a
tolerated younger brother, listening to his betters. And when the
interrogation was over--he could imagine it, gilded and magnified
and made to sound learned and important, bestowed on a respectful
lecture audience in a municipal arena dedicated to wrestling,
political conventions, roller skating and Shakespeare--the two of
them apparently believed that they were alone in the Forest of
Arden, no melancholy Mr. Chart within ten leagues. They creaked
happily in their wicker chairs as they teased each other--about
punctuality! One would not have chosen that topic as a beguiling
link between illicit lovers, and yet Lundsgard and the girl were
lyric as he cloyingly bickered, "And you were ten minutes
late--you were, you <i>were,"</i> and the female conspirator
murmured, "Oh, pooh, I--was--<i>not!"</i></p>

<p>It seemed to Hayden that an appalling softness had come over
her in her manner toward Lundsgard. When that bounding animal
touched her bare elbow, which he did oftener than was quite
necessary for emphasis, she, the late inviolable, did not seem
annoyed, and she had for him a smile which went beyond the
pleased obedience which custom expects from a female
office-hand.</p>

<p>Lundsgard was startled to discover some one much like Hayden
Chart still with them, and he went out of his way to get in, "You
certainly have a grand effect on your girl friend here, Hay. When
you aren't around, she treats me like dirt, but when you're here,
she tries to make you jealous by treating me fairly good. I wish
I had your neat touch with the women!" And looked, then, at
Olivia in a proprietarial pride which was more betraying than any
yelp of passion.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Hayden was coldly certain that this pair of profit-hunting
pedants, of ranging sensationalists, were lovers now, beyond
charity. Then they deserved each other!</p>

<p>But the stubbornness that had always marched with him, most
relentless when it was most quiet, the stubbornness that had
fortified him to endure Caprice's clownish demands and Jesse
Bradbin's witless jesting, rose in Hayden now, and he was the
more resolved to save Olivia.</p>

<p>No one else could do it--certainly not the moist-eyed young
woman herself, now yearning toward Lundsgard's ten-bushel of
manly beauty. And, reflected Hayden, he himself had guiltily
broken through her poor wall of defense. She was "worth
saving"--this trained and honest woman, even now when she was
demonstrating that she was not in all things so edifyingly
honest.</p>

<p>He would save her--if. He had nothing of more importance to
do, now. . . . And, with a fascination apparently undiminished by
her idiocy, he happened to love her.</p>

<p>Lundsgard was giving himself, and apparently he felt that he
was giving them, considerable gratification in letting them know
that he now moved on a charming social plane, jammed with
Gracious Living. Prince Ugo Tramontana had invited him to come
for tea and see some Second Century Roman cameos. . . . He
referred to the learned relic as Ugo, and before he rose he
lighted a tremendous American cigar, with the Lorenzan band still
on it, and extinguished the match with an archducal flourish.</p>

<p>When Lundsgard was gone, Olivia said briskly, "Well, have to
start home and wash my face."</p>

<p>"Sit down again, Olivia. I want to do some scolding. I want
you to quit your job with Lundsgard. . . ."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think of it."</p>

<p>". . . and at once. You can call him up this evening."</p>

<p>"Ri-dic-ulous!" She sat down firmly.</p>

<p>"And tell him to hurry up and find that new stenographer--whom
he had no intention of finding."</p>

<p>"Why, I've never heard . . ."</p>

<p>"And then, without any tapering off or artful use of drugs, I
want you to kick that fellow out, complete."</p>

<p>"Ab-surd!"</p>

<p>"I don't know precisely where you stand with Lundsgard now,
but I do know it's just a matter of whether you will or whether
you have. <i>What?"</i> She jumped at the unexampled force and
roughness of his "What?" He jumped himself.</p>

<p>"What <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Are you two lovers now?"</p>

<p>She quieted down. She looked at him without fear. "Well, we
could be, and that's all I shall tell you."</p>

<p>"It's enough. Do you want to get rid of me?"</p>

<p>"No, really, Hay--Hayden, I don't. I am enormously fond of
you. It's so happy and easy to be with you, and I admire your
decency and calm. I would like to hold you, always--no, I
<i>intend</i> to hold you! And I agree with you that Lorry is a
misguided and misguiding truck-driver--in fact, I know it much
better than you do! But he is also a knight, a blithe and
unconquerable knight. After all, Giovanni delle Bande Nere wasn't
distinguished for his accurate knowledge of dates or his fidelity
to the sweet girl at home. Lorry is a fake--good Heavens, don't
you suppose I'm well trained enough to know that! But he is
extremely charming in a nasty way. Besides, what could either you
or I do to head him off?"</p>

<p>"You really are satisfied to let yourself be tied and hogtied
by this gorilla?"</p>

<p>"You still do get very American, don't you, dear!"</p>

<p>"I hope so! Answer me! You're satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But what can I do?"</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know that your golden Lorenzo's real first
name is Oley?"</p>

<p>"Is it? That's good. It sounds strong and honest and yet not
puritanical; positively debonair. I was afraid--of course I was
reasonably sure that he wasn't a <i>geborener</i> Lorenzo--I
thought probably he was a Hiram or a Jabez."</p>

<p>"Olivia, I don't think this hour calls for humor. You must
have some notion of how serious it is for me. Leave out jealousy
and hurt pride: I can choke those, but you can guess what it
means to me to see a well-bred woman in the red hands of that
butcher--that cigar-waving fancy gent!"</p>

<p>"That is my battle, or as Lorry <i>and</i> you would say,
'That's <i>my</i> lookout'!" Olivia was so defiant that she did
not even trouble herself to stress it greatly.</p>

<p>"Yes. It isn't easy. I couldn't slug that football hero--I
would get killed. There's no use my exposing him as a
charlatan--everybody with any scholarship guesses that already.
But still, I certainly do not intend to be the complaisant
husband. I demand as strict a fidelity of you as I do of myself.
And I can't do the most natural and convenient thing of all: tell
you that I am disgusted, that I am not standing any more, that I
am through; because I am still almost completely hypnotized by
you--just <i>almost,</i> mind you! I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>Softly, but with the slippery softness of a false woman, she
urged, "Oh, forget it, my dear. It's the sort of thing that can't
last."</p>

<p>"Not last--no, merely in the heart and brain and devoted
faith, that's all! Frankly, Olivia, I am trying to coach myself
to feel easy in cutting you out as I would any other vice that
hurt me too much, and I can't--not yet!"</p>

<p>With flippant impatience, she piped, "Have you finished now
with your fussing and clucking and general sad bewilderment over
something that ought to be obvious--that, as I keep telling you
but you won't listen, a flirtation like this just can't last? Or
matter!"</p>

<p>"I've given you my warning."</p>

<p>"And I my warning that you will be extremely sorry, not for
any crime <i>I</i> am committing but for your own subhuman,
dry-as-dust, school-principal nagging--with no heart in it and no
humor. Oh, Hayden, you admire our medieval gallants so much, you
say, and then the minute anything touches <i>you,</i> you flee
from them back to your dry-codfish Maine ancestors!" She was
working herself up to the outraged and innocent wrath that is
nowhere so splendidly found as among the guilty. "I have never
lied to you or about you. Well, I am going now, and you may do
exactly whatever you please! <i>Arrivederci!"</i></p>

<p>She flounced away and, without explanations, she did not come
to dinner that evening at the <i>pensione.</i></p>

<p>So he cut and ran.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>20</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He cut and ran. It was absurd not to have seen Rome; it was
intolerable to sit and twiddle his fingers and watch Olivia chase
the dragon and be only very annoyed by a St. George.</p>

<p>He drove to Rome through the pleasant hills and, as always,
fell in love with Siena almost as with Florence: the square, the
cathedral, the Palazzo Chigi. But Rome he found too buxom, too
busy, too operatically regal for love, and only fit for wonder,
from the Vatican's sanctuary to the Palatine Hill where he walked
through 100 B.C.</p>

<p>He did perceive how grandly Rome was marching back to her
ancient throne as Queen of the World. Hard by an arch of the
emperors he saw the jeeps parked between the Rolls-Royces and
Cadillacs; the traffic was more alarming than Michigan Avenue;
overhead were the airplanes which rarely teased demure Florence;
and in new and haughty cement buildings breathlessly telephoning
were California oilmen, Persian oilmen, British airplane agents,
Hungarian cinema producers, French television engineers, Egyptian
steamship agents, quiet Russians who loved an evening alone with
their pipes and books and one small atomic bomb, Brazilian
vendors of coffee and jazz symphonies, and Croat spies spying on
Bulgar spies spying on Turkish spies spying on Rome.</p>

<p>Not even the massive haughtiness of the antique temples and
the imperial baths more lightened Hayden's technical eye than the
urbanity of avenues like Via Veneto. Yet he was not annoyed that
in Rome, with all the Holy Year pilgrims, he had been unable to
find a satisfactory hotel room, and had gone with his topolino
out to a village inn. After supper there he sat on a bench in an
arbor and looked at the green evening sky of Latium and was
homesick for the warm buoyancy of a new and terrible Olivia.</p>

<p>He returned to Florence and the Tre Corone late in the
afternoon and Olivia was there and unexpectedly welcoming. She
tightened her arms round him, she muttered, "So much, missed you
so much."</p>

<p>He shakily tried to be carefree in a cheerful, "Let's go out
and have dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, I am so, <i>so</i> sorry, but I have an
invitation to dinner--didn't know when you were coming
back--might have sent a girl a post card."</p>

<p>He did not ask, she did not say, from whom was her invitation.
"I'll make it up to you later!" she chirruped, with needless
sweetness.</p>

<p>He dined alone, except for the table-to-table yells of the
newest generation of boarding-house pests, who were not, this
time, large like the Grenadier Sisters and were not females and
were not American, but three diminutive and aged males from
Luxembourg. But it was all the same thing, and they entertained
him at dinner by yelping "Haf you seen the Cenacolo in the
convent of Sant' Onofrio? <i>No?"</i> and "Haf you seen the tomb
of Oddo Altoviti by Rovezzano? <i>No?"</i></p>

<p>Olivia returned very late, still with no information
volunteered about her evening entertainment, and she was not so
affectionate in saying good-night to him as she had promised; she
was mechanical about it and slightly annoyed; and he went to
sleep in a trance of emptiness and futility.</p>

<p>Hayden had been going to one Dr. Stretti to keep watch on the
headaches he still had, now and then, from his motor smash, and
had become admiring and fond of that round, dumpy, very learned
and skillful physician with his mouse of a mustache. He was not
only Hayden's friend and his doctor but, Italian-wise, his doctor
<i>because</i> he was a subtle and understanding friend. On the
morning after his return from Rome, Hayden's head was one round
pain held together by his skull, and he hastened to Stretti, who
assured him that this was but eyestrain from the glare of the
road from Rome. He bathed Hayden's eyes and laughed at his
tension and generally did medical magic on him.</p>

<p>Said Dr. Stretti, "My brother, who is also an architect, in
Turin, and who is very curious about American methods, will be in
Florence just for today. Could you come to a very plain supper at
my flat this evening and meet him?"</p>

<p>Hayden had made no definite plan with Olivia for dinner this
coming evening, and indignantly, with the injustice typical of
all particularly fond lovers, he thought, "I'll teach that young
woman a lesson--leaving me flat last evening, my first evening
back in Florence," and he said to the doctor heartily, "Shall be
very happy to."</p>

<p>Dr. Stretti's apartment was in one of the long, newish,
solemn, residence streets out near the Cascine; on a fourth floor
reached by a particularly adventurous self-service elevator in
which you felt, when you pressed the button for your floor, that
the cage would fly to pieces instantly. But the apartment itself
was like that of any well-to-do doctor in Newlife or in New York,
except that there were rather more upholstered chairs around
small tables in the living room, and more poison-green
upholstered armchairs with doilies, and books in three languages,
and far more paintings by contemporaries.</p>

<p>The architect-brother, whose English was as struggling as
Hayden's Italian, gave him a small homesickness by confessing
exactly such struggles with clients and contractors and unions
and politicians as Hayden knew at home: the same newly rich who
wanted marble bathrooms for the price of tile, and tile bathrooms
for the price of linoleum. He glowed at Hayden and took him in.
So did the doctor; so did Mrs. Stretti, though she spoke no
English at all. But she assured Hayden, with more kindness than
strict factualness, that he was now speaking Italian like a
<i>professore.</i></p>

<p>The whole family took him in. In their cordiality and ease
with a stranger, they seemed to him more like Americans than any
nationals he had met since he had sailed. He felt at home, as
after dinner he drank small glasses of <i>vino santo</i> and
agreed with them that, yes, they would indeed like Hollywood and
the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>But of them all, one had more importance than just
well-mannered amiability, and that was the daughter, Tosca
Stretti, a girl of twenty who was all eyes and shine of dark hair
and slimness and youth and trustfulness. She was constantly
turning to her uncle, her parents, with affection and admiration;
she loved life and loved her family. And, without having any
English, she could say to Hayden that she looked upon him as a
man and a remarkable one.</p>

<p>An aggressive American woman would have jeered of Tosca,
"Sure, you men like 'em submissive, like 'em as slaves. This
little Italian would clean your shoes and you'd love it!" Yes,
Tosca probably <i>would</i> clean them, if there should be need,
but devotedly, with dignity, not submissively. Without discussion
she would expect to love and ardently to be loved.</p>

<p>That night, abed, Hayden did not think of his colleague, the
architect, but of Tosca. It would be fun to be with her, to teach
her English, to show her his America. Why hadn't he such a girl,
soft and trusting and yet as sharply capable as her mother, and
not an inspiring heartache like Olivia?</p>

<p>Why not? By coaxing Tosca to come home with him, he would have
in the stability of home that strangeness and flavor which he had
needed in Newlife. All next day he thought of Tosca and the
thought was to him a soft comfort which he needed after reading a
note which Olivia had left for him when she went off, early, to
the Laurentian Library--or to Lundsgard's boudoir office:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had assumed we would be having dinner together last evening
but you skipped off with no explanations. That is too bad because
<i>this</i> evening <i>I</i> have a date &amp; shall not see
you.</p>

<p>O. L.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>His inward comment had all of lovers' logic. "But you can't
blame her. But I'm not going to stand for being stood up but
<i>she</i>--oh yes, <i>she</i> is to desert me whenever she feels
like it but I'm to stand by all the time. But naturally she was
miffed--you can't blame her."</p>

<p>Olivia and he had, without any special agreement, built up a
habit of festival evening together each Saturday, with restaurant
dinner and a movie or a concert, but on this warm, resonant
Saturday evening in the Italian late spring, he dined drearily,
alone, at the Tre Corone, cheered only by the thought of how
trustingly Tosca Stretti had smiled at him. He was at his coffee
when Perpetua came to inform him that a "Signorina Altici" was
there to see him, waiting in the <i>salotto.</i></p>

<p>Tosca? Why?</p>

<p>He went hurriedly and on a couch, her hat put aside, in a fawn
suit that seemed much worn and leather sandals that certainly
were worn, tired, defiant, appealing, forlorn, familiar, stranger
than any Calabria peasant, pert-nosed and freckled and
red-headed, was Miss Roxanna Eldritch of Newlife, Colorado.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But mostly, she was very quiet.</p>

<p>She had sprung up to greet him; he had galloped forward and
kissed her. She was a chunk of Home miraculously set down before
him: the cheerful, overcrowded streets; cottonwoods and willows
by the river bank; swiftly grown skyscrapers; the office and the
club where he was not a bookish nonentity studying in an alien
and indifferent land, but a man, a boss, a friend, a citizen, a
person of heart and welcome, and in it all a jolliness that could
never warm an Olivia in her delicate savor of life--nor even a
Tosca conceivably so dear. And this home soil was his own,
without explanations or working at it. In a jungle he had seen,
startling, his own familiar flag, and Roxy and he yelled at each
other with fond tribal cries.</p>

<p>The more he looked at her, the more she seemed changed. She
was as fetching as ever but she looked down at the floor more
than at him, and there was dejection in her shoulders. And,
"Might as well get it over," said Roxy. "I've plumb flopped. Been
fired."</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, partly loafing and dissipation, I guess, though I did a
lot of work, too. But it has slowly been borne in on me that the
bright kid from the home town, who thinks it would just be too
cute if she could be the big noise as an authority on Europe and
tell the home folks all about the hobbies of the dethroned kings
and interview a few prime ministers, and throw in a few
explanations of the devaluation of the pound--she isn't so hot
when she gets into competition with the veterans that have been
here, off and on, twenty years and speak five languages and
actually read a book once.</p>

<p>"Funny but they simply won't see the light and obligingly hand
over their prestige to me and go to work in the jute
factory--along with their wives and kids. The old meanies! I sent
home oceans of copy and first my managing editor used a lot and
even got a few pieces syndicated, but I guess the novelty went
bump, and little while ago, he tactfully wrote canning me, with a
warm-hearted suggestion--the old sweetheart--that I <i>might</i>
get my old job back if I hustled to Newlife, but quick!</p>

<p>"But now I'm here, I want to see more of Europe, maybe Greece
and Spain, and then Israel and Egypt. And I <i>am</i> going to
work--work like a worker and not like a Bohemian amateur lady
journalist who gets busy only when the bars are closed and the
handsome young vice-consul won't answer his phone.</p>

<p>"Honestly! Getting bounced was an awful shock to me. I guess
most American women, even <i>some</i> of those that have been
quite a long time on a real job, still think that their sacred
womanhood entitles them to do anything they want to, arrive late
and loaf on the job they're paid for, and any boss that kicks is
no gentleman--never was brought up at anybody's mother's knee.
Shock? I'll say! It made me think, 'Rox, my man, maybe that
managing editor wants to print written writings and not your
charming intentions and your sorrel hair!'</p>

<p>"And I guess, even before the assassination, I'd had about
enough of the bar-to-bar girlish lady tourists of fifty, the
students of singing who never sing anything but 'Just pickle my
bones in alcohol,' and all the artistic young men from Wyoming
and the Bronnix that wear nasty little beards as sandwich boards
to advertise their otherwise imperceptible talents, beards like
young alley goats and flannel shirts like zoot-suiters.</p>

<p>"While I'm over here, if it's not too inconvenient, I would
still like to meet one French Frenchman and one Italian Italian.
You know--quaint but almost as interesting as the sixteenth young
American this month to found a Little Magazine dedicated to
freedom, the new arts and gin.</p>

<p>"I admit I've had me quite a time with these drunks, but still
and all, I guess, along with my Uncle Joe, who was the prize
drunk in Butte, I've got something in me of Gramma O'Larrick, who
ran a boarding house and sent seven sons to study for the
ministry.</p>

<p>"So I've come down here to Florence, partly because it's not
too noisy and partly, I'll admit, because you were here, and you
always were kind. But I don't intend to sponge on you in any way,
Hay, get that clear, money or time or anything. I just want your
assurance that I'm still potentially human, even if I am a
flop!"</p>

<p>He cried, <i>"How</i> human! Now, right away, I'll take you
out for a dinner that would make Reverend Gowelly--remember the
Prohibition raider, back home?--throw up his dusty hat and kiss
the bartender."</p>

<p>"Thanks--some night--tomorrow if you'd like--but I've had a
rick of spaghetti already tonight."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we'll look for a room for you, Roxy--maybe here in
this refined junction depot."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I've already found a room in a dump across the river.
I asked a tourist agency. Iron cot and a kitchen chair and a nice
calico curtain for wardrobe; 327 yards from the bathroom.
Honestly, I won't bother you. . . ."</p>

<p>"You couldn't, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, couldn't I! Give me credit! No, all I want is some advice
about getting a job here, for a girl that speaks no known
language. . . ."</p>

<p>If Hayden was, a moment, inattentive, it was because he knew
that Olivia might come in and find him affectionately seated on
the couch beside the not inconspicuous charms of Roxy. Would it
not be discreet to explain Roxy before Olivia should see her--to
take her out, now, to the security of a caf&eacute;? But he
turned defiant; he rebuked himself for his sour timidity. Roxy
was beyond debate a tempting wench, but he was doing nothing of
which to be ashamed--not like Olivia and her bounding Lorry.</p>

<p>"Let's see, Roxy. There's a Mrs. Dodsworth here, important in
the Colony, and I remember her saying something about being a
trustee of an American school for girls that's just being
organized. I'll phone her this evening. And now--more of you, my
dear! Have you lost your heart to any of your young geniuses with
the tarred-and-feathered chins?"</p>

<p>"No, not much. A young female wandering around Europe alone
learns to be pretty glacial when she gets picked up."</p>

<p>"That happen often?"</p>

<p>"Continuously! French drugstore-cowboys and Norwegian artists
and Swiss professors and American G. I.'s and American lieutenant
colonels. You do get tired of their 'How about it?' smirk. We all
used to think that it was the funniest thing in the world that
our great-grammas, if they could afford it, couldn't travel
without a chaperone in black sateen, but how I would have loved a
chaperone, mitts and evil mind and all, in Europe!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you go home, Roxy?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"It seems natural to be home, where you understand people by
instinct, understand why they do the particular things they do do
and do say--dumb or dreary or noble and silly."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go, Hay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've really settled down contentedly to study. And, uh, I
have a girl I'm somewhat interested in . . ."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Two, in fact: a splendid American scholar, and an adorable
Italian girl."</p>

<p>"Two? Then it's all right."</p>

<p>"I want you to . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes, Mr. Chart, and me too, I'm just dying to
meet them, both of them, all sixteen of them--there's nothing I
enjoy more than meeting my gemmun-friends' lovely girl friends,
except hearing you rave about them. . . . Over my dead body,
Chart!"</p>

<p>"You still haven't given me much reason for your staying on in
Europe."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just another of these American girl sparrows you see
hopefully hopping along every road in Europe, afraid to chirp. We
don't know what we want but we all believe that, without doing
any special work to get it, we'll be smitten with glory and
suddenly find some romantic peak where we'll shine. Get on the
stage or be what the beginners call 'penwomen' or ballet dancers
or art-photographers. Or get married, but only to a tall, gently
tragic, gray-eyed painter, with black hair gone faintly gray--guy
named Peter or Michael or . . ."</p>

<p>"Or Lorenzo?"</p>

<p>"You guessed it. And I suppose I'm typical of all those young
women, who won't be patient, who find it easier to jump on a
train and skip on to some new capital than to stick in one place
and make solid friends."</p>

<p>"I don't think you are, Roxy. You've had a fling, but I know
you'll get set. Sufficiently."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear. I like to have your approval, more than
anybody's, even if it is a little qualified and stingy."</p>

<p>He felt that he must go on admitting that he carried an
Olivian passport. He was not going to sneak across the frontiers.
He did his duty by a pleasantly argumentative, "But I know that
not all you American girls in Europe are the vacuous kind you
take so much sadistic trouble in beating up. You aren't. Neither
is my--young woman living here at the Tre Corone, a professional
historical scholar--Dr. Lomond, Dr. Olivia Lomond."</p>

<p>Roxy burst. "Dr. Olivia Lomond! Oh, my foot to Dr. Lomond! A
vinegary, sexless, flat-chested old maid carting you around to
tearooms and reading Ruskin aloud! I knew I should never have let
you come to Europe alone! You were quite a lad in Newlife,
whenever you got sore on the tennis court. A plague of bot flies
and Texas jiggers on Doc-tor Lomond! That dried up arroyo!"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly dried up!" He tenderly took Roxy's hand; the
hand of his dear little sister, his chronic niece, his oldtime
enduring friend. "I very much want you to meet her and appreciate
her. . . ."</p>

<p>"Neither do I!"</p>

<p>He was stroking her hand, feeling slightly more than
avuncular, when a menace trembled in the air and made him look
up. Olivia was just inside the room, watching them, and as Hayden
saw her Borgia eyes, they said, almost audibly, "Ah, I
<i>see!</i> And you the species of camel who has been demanding
that I give up my innocent colleague, Professor Lundsgard!"</p>

<p>He did have sense enough not to throw Roxy's hand at Olivia
and jump up guiltily; he did have the genius to go on holding
that hand comfortably and to purr, "So glad you came, Olivia.
This is none other than Roxanna Eldritch that I've told you so
much about--great friend of Caprice, and I've known her, bless
her dear neighborly heart, since she was a baby."</p>

<p>Before Roxy could even get started, Olivia fired:</p>

<p>"That does make quite a long, <i>long</i> period of knowing
Miss Uh, <i>doesn't</i> it!"</p>

<p>But there proved, then, to be nothing wrong with Roxy's
artillery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>21</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They were both rare, thought Hayden: Olivia, crystal framed in
ivory and silver; Roxanna, rose-crystal rimmed with burnished
copper. If they could be friends! He blundered--but perhaps no
cardinal secretary of state could have been altogether diplomatic
in this crisis: "I hope you two charmers are going to be close
friends. You're certainly the best friends <i>I</i> have!"</p>

<p>Olivia said to him sweetly, "Are we also to be close friends
with your dear Tosca Stretti?"</p>

<p>"Now what the devil do you know about Tosca? A delightful girl
but <i>how . . ."</i></p>

<p>"You forget Florence is a small town. Lorry Lundsgard went in
to see Dr. Stretti today about a lame wrist--he strained it years
ago in a great football battle, and the doctor told him that you
and his daughter had hit it off wonderfully--I think he is quite
hopeful of her having an escorted tour to the wonders of
Colorado, some day before long! Congratulations--to you, I mean,
not to the poor young lady!"</p>

<p>Just when Hayden was bewildered by this foul attack, Olivia
was temporarily reinforced by the enemy, Roxanna, who tittered,
"Who is this little number you've been keeping up your sleeve,
without letting Mother know, Hay? Doing the young Italian wrecks
along with the old Italian ruins, are you?"</p>

<p>He stated, with just the ludicrous touchy dignity that both
Olivia and Roxy had meant to stir up in him, "Miss Stretti is a
young girl I met casually at dinner. She doesn't even speak
English."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>!" said Olivia and "<i>I</i> see!" said Roxy,
with feminine derision that wiped him out. And so, having
punished him for introducing them to each other, the two
puritanical and jeeringly righteous ladies turned murderously
upon each other.</p>

<p>"You're not staying long in Florence are you, Miss Eldritch?"
Olivia said caressingly.</p>

<p>("And she pretended first not to remember Roxy's name!")</p>

<p>But Roxy snatched off the first skirmish. She put on, not the
damning, insinuating cordiality of Olivia but the more dangerous
pose of never posing; she was as simple and frank as Satan. "I
really don't know how long I'll be here, Dr. Lomond. Oh, yes, I
know your name so well. Hay was telling me what a fine scholar
you are, and how you've helped him, the poor darling, helpless
amateur, understand something of Florence. But me, I'm simply a
sketchy newspaper hack, and I reckon I'll be lucky if I ever as
much as learn Florence's last name."</p>

<p>"Last . . .? Oh, yes--yes . . . You'll be going on to Rome, no
doubt. I'm sure you'll want to take maybe four or five days in
Rome. It's an extremely important focal point."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I read that somewhere," said Roxy, most
plain-faced and obedient. "You feel so, too? Then I'll have to
take a quick look at the place, I guess."</p>

<p>More sweetly than ever, from Olivia: "I suppose you're staying
at the Grand or the Excelsior, here in Florence? A poor student
on a scholarship, like me--I confess I do envy you rich
journalists."</p>

<p>Roxy didn't take it; she didn't blurt that she was poor and
jobless; she said rustically, "I guess I'm just a lucky girl. But
I don't know as I'll stay on at the Excelsior. My private
bathroom is pretty fair there--black marble and a crocus-yellow
tub, but I don't know--they couldn't give me a dressing-room with
a big-enough toilet table to set out all my cosmetic bottles--you
do get into such a naughty habit of buying cut-glass flasks in
Paris, so amusing to amble along the Rue de la Paix and the dear
old Champs and pick up exclusive perfumes. Of course, in my
profession, having to meet prime ministers and generals and
atomic scientists and handsome movie stars so intimately, and
<i>really</i> important historians, I have to have a decent place
to chat with them."</p>

<p>Olivia was not routed. "Naturally, my dear. Such interesting,
important work. And you shouldn't feel especially inferior with
them, or so humble."</p>

<p><i>"I--don't!"</i></p>

<p>("Are two women who like the same man, or who have opposite
political faiths, always bitches to each other when they meet? Or
merely usually?")</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right, Miss Eldritch. Perhaps these
dignitaries get something of a fresh, breezy point of view from
meeting you. And now, Hayden, I must trot off to my room. The
Ministry of Education, in Rome, has asked for my opinion on some
secret documents about Charles VIII that have just been
discovered. I'll leave you and Miss Eldritch to enjoy talking
about your neighbors in Newlife. If I don't see you again, Miss
Eldritch, I hope you will have a very enjoyable journey to Rome.
Good night!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"That woman," said Roxanna, "that woman--that woman is--she's
a knockout. She knows how to make up that mahogany skin of hers
so it looks slick. Even with a crooked nose and too small a mouth
and a wrinkly forehead and ears like a rabbit, she manages to
look quite beautiful."</p>

<p>"Now you . . ."</p>

<p>"And without any training except bossing a schoolroom for
years and years, she makes like real royalty. The boarding-house
queen! What a lucky boy you are! When she gets you back home, the
Bradbins will take to her like a duck to water. She has their
same stunt of making you feel that if you disagree with them,
you're not only a fool--you ought to see a doctor."</p>

<p>Hayden was tired of their war; he had seen only too much of
such delightful business in Caprice's opinion of every pretty
woman newly arrived in Newlife. He said, affectionately, "Roxy, I
appeal to you as an old friend and neighbor . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"To shut up."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I'm extraordinarily fond of you, and always have been, and I
hope to give you a good time seeing Florence--with the assistance
of Olivia, who knows more about it than sixteen tourists like you
and me put together. So when you and she get the posing and
prancing and pawing the earth over, we'll all be happy and almost
grown-up."</p>

<p>"Okay, Chief!"</p>

<p>"And I'll introduce you to her friend, and mine, Lorenzo
Lundsgard, who's a scholar and a smart lecturer and a football
hero and a Hollywood actor and a big handsome brute and a
sophisticated European and a friendly Yankee all put
together--and he loves redheads."</p>

<p>"That vision," stated Roxanna, "you got out of a book. He's
Abelard and Heloise, that's who he is, and he's dead. I've seen
his tomb in P&egrave;re-Lachaise." She rose.</p>

<p>"I'll take you home, Roxy. I have a little car."</p>

<p>"No, honestly, sweetie; I told you! I'm not going to sponge on
you. I want to walk home and begin to learn this town. All I want
is a tip on a job. Will you ask Mrs. What's-her-name about it
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Dodsworth? I certainly shall. Roxy, it's nice to have you
here! Extremely!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear. And I'll quit picking on your Mexican sugar
pie."</p>

<p>"Splendid."</p>

<p>"It was too easy! Good night, Wonderful!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Olivia came to his room that evening and attacked at once.</p>

<p>"Who is this little fly-by-night Eldritch piece,
<i>really,</i> aside from your having known her--as a clerk in
the Five-and-Ten, I imagine--in your Colorado wilderness?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly that she was a friend of my wife and
myself, just a little younger, and she is a newspaperman of
standing."</p>

<p>"Have you been keeping her up your sleeve all the time you've
been in Europe?"</p>

<p>"You know I haven't." He was grave, unsquabbling. "I have
always liked her and honored her. She is gallant and a little
touching in her ambition to be something more than a jolly
pirate. No, I do not plan to flirt with her. No, I have not done
so in the past--except in that she is so radiant and well rounded
and highly touchable that <i>no</i> normal man could look at her
without being a little fatuous and lively. . . . Oh, Olivia, it's
hard enough for us to stay infatuated without asking some
outsider to come in and think up good ways of making us
miserable!"</p>

<p>"That's what I <i>say!</i> This Eldritch number!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean her. I meant Lorenzo--Lancelot. I do worship
you--I think. Don't let's let <i>anybody</i> come between us!
Let's quit this childish, 'You broke that engagement so I'll
break this one and teach you a lesson.' Both of us! Let's be
content with love. Let's not tamper with the gift of God!"</p>

<p>Instantly she rose to her passionate affection of the past,
crying, "No! We mustn't! We've been so close! Oh, people always
become traitors to love. It's so simple and tremendous that their
mean little minnows of souls can't stand the glory!"</p>

<p>Despite the danger of the practically ubiquitous Mrs. Manse,
despite the charms of Roxanna and the manly Mr. Lundsgard and
Tosca Stretti, they embraced each other with hungry sighing,
almost weeping over the perils they had now conquered.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Next morning, less shining of wing and slightly irritable when
Perpetua was late bringing in his coffee and rolls and marmalade,
Hayden wondered why it might not be an inspired notion to get--to
try to get--Olivia to hand over her job in Lundsgard's office to
Roxanna, together with all her rights, privileges and interests
in the said Lundsgard.</p>

<p>But that would be a dirty trick to play on Roxy, aside from
the fact that Olivia would see them both damned first. So he
telephoned to Mrs. Samuel Dodsworth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>22</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Dodsworth was a woman equally kind and efficient. For
Roxanna she could find no school post but she did ferret out a
position as chauffeur, reader, masseuse, servant-firer and
listener to anecdotes about deceased spouse and successful
nephews, to the rich Mrs. Orlando Weepswell, and there Roxanna
had a suite and a maid and a slight paralysis of the auditory
nerves.</p>

<p>Roxy, with Hayden, met Nat Friar, at a bar, and the two
missioners of American irreverence formed a pious alliance. As
Roxy expressed it, "Uncle Nat and I sure clicked."</p>

<p>To Nat, beauty was a dynamic force, culture was more
revolutionary than war, the product of the artist (though not the
artist himself and his mistresses and bank account) was to be
studied with reverence, and the more he held this gospel, the
more impatiently did Nat hear the adorers who gabbled or gurgled
or wheezed about the arts; who capitalized Beauty and Culture
along with their social positions.</p>

<p>If Roxanna could never have Nat Friar's knowledge nor his
gruff reverences, she had even more horrible synonyms for the
word "fake," and Nat was grateful. When Hayden went by himself to
Nat's villa, he often found Roxanna perched there, cross-legged
on the couch, being cheery with Nat and Ada Baker.</p>

<p>In Florence, Roxanna, being in a state of repentance and
poverty, did not see any of Sadie Lurcher's international set,
glittering like broken glass edges, sharp as broken glass,
unpleasant under the teeth as broken glass. They do not find
Florence "smart," nor do they often remain. For the most part,
Hayden judged, Roxanna associated with that borderline
assortment, the "American Students," of whom some were frugal and
studious, and some were shaggy, drunken, late-walking and
floridly abnormal or given to a confusion about private interests
in wives.</p>

<p>In general they were less noisy and self-advertising than
their cousins in Paris, and Hayden felt that Roxanna was a colt
now broken of loco-weed.</p>

<p>His introduction of his quasi-cousin, Roxy, to Lundsgard was
operatic and a success.</p>

<p>He had invited Roxy, Lundsgard and Olivia to dine with him at
the Cantina de' Pazzi (you will not find it under that name), in
the basement of the venerable Palazzo Suoli. Under massive
arches, the basement, clattery with dishes and the delighted
chatter of tourists, wanders off into circular stone cubicles
which hint of ancient tortures. The walls, scurfy with old blood,
are coy now with travel posters, bull-fighter costumes from
London sweatshops and paintings of carnivals in Venice--you were
never quite sure whether it was Venice, California, or its bawdy
older sister. To complete the Cantina's charm for tourists, the
management had ordered that bread sticks and free colored post
cards be displayed on the tables nightly before the guests
arrived.</p>

<p>As Hayden and Roxanna waited there--she had refused more than
one cocktail--they saw Olivia and Lundsgard, coming in from their
office work. Roxy's lips lifted in an arch of delight at
Lundsgard, and she crooned, "Oh, buy him for me, will you, Cousin
Hay?"</p>

<p>And truly this Viking Lorenzo was something to enchant a
maiden: broad-shouldered and his face all one beam of loving
intelligence and conscious power and masculine resolution. He was
hatless, his heroic head well back and his flaxen hair a coronet.
With his sports jacket and gray open shirt, he had a purple and
yellow Florentine silk scarf and, as he came near, on one
masterful hand Roxy must have seen a vast opal ring.</p>

<p>"Golly, that's a lot of man in one consignment," sighed
Roxanna.</p>

<p>Olivia was determined to be agreeable. She gurgled to her
enemy, "How's the job going?" and even called her "Roxanna." And
Lundsgard as boisterously greeted her, "Welcome to our nice
little city, Miss Eldritch and, speaking as a veteran here, may I
announce that it hasn't seen anything cuter than you since Dante
tried to make Be-<i>at</i>-triss. Roxanna, we <i>moriturus,</i>
salute thee!"</p>

<p>("Olivia is right; he really will popularize learning in the
States, though of course he'll kill it on the way.")</p>

<p>Roxanna was gushing to Lundsgard, "You don't look as if
Culture and Florence have stunted your boyish growth!"</p>

<p>He smiled on her as though she were a poor but worthy woman to
whom he was giving thousands of dollars, dollar by dollar. "Roxy,
the sneaking fact is that I'm not cultured. I can teach that
stuff, because I like college youngsters and I realize that all
they want, or ever need, is to get a smattering of art and
history, so when they become docs or lawyers or manufacturers,
they won't look ignorant. But I'm just a funnel, and with all
your interviews, you've probably got ten times as much real
inside dope on these flyblown European countries as I'll ever
get."</p>

<p>Roxanna answered as benevolently as he.</p>

<p>"Olivia was only too darn kind. I've never really done any big
interviews--just real-life stories like interviews with Paris
bartenders on do Yankee tourists prefer <i>vol au vent</i> or
pickled pigs' feet. No, you're the goods on the
culture--apparently."</p>

<p>Till now Roxy had been a true woman canvasser for the Lorry
Party, and Olivia had difficulty in looking companionable when
Lundsgard turned a shoulder on her and leaned into Roxanna. But
with noticeably less reverence, Roxanna went on and Hayden
thought he smelled malice:</p>

<p>"But you haven't been a professor all the time, have you,
Lorenzo?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Lotta strings to my bow."</p>

<p>"You were in Hollywood?"</p>

<p>"Don't know as the L. A. papers raved much about it, but yes,
I did a little ham acting."</p>

<p>"I'll bet all the girls hounded you for autographs."</p>

<p>This was pleasing to the great Lorenzo and astonishing to
Hayden. He had never thought of that. He had never known any one
whose autograph was sought after, who was so beautiful or clever
that those fetish-seekers and magnified clinkers and general
nuisances called autograph-hounds would ever course after him.
But Lorenzo took his own tremendousness for granted, and with
genial democracy he admitted:</p>

<p>"Oh, they used to ask for my fist now and then."</p>

<p><i>"Little</i> girls, I meant--junior misses' size--twelve to
fourteen."</p>

<p>Lorenzo was huffy. "No, not just junior misses! I've had some
doggone beautiful, rich women ask me for an autograph!"</p>

<p>"I'll bet. Seriously, Lorenzo, I was going to ask you for one
myself and please, pretty please, give me one now before I forget
it! If it wouldn't bore you? I want to keep it with Gene Tunney's
and Andr&eacute; Gide's and all those."</p>

<p>Hayden noted that the sheet which Roxy managed to find in her
handbag and present to Lundsgard for his signature was a bill
which did not look receipted. Lundsgard signed it with large,
rolling L's and looked delighted. Roxy purred. Olivia looked
sour, then tried to look amused, and in a great-lady manner she
chuckled "Lorry, I'm afraid I missed something. It never occurred
to me to ask for your autograph--except as I do have your
initials signed to so many gay little notes."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you have!" snarled Roxanna and went over to
Lundsgard complete.</p>

<p>They agreed that they were shrewd, generous, swift-moving
Americans, with no nonsense. When Olivia tried to be lofty with
their lowness and, to keep the debate fair, Hayden joined Olivia,
the two hard-riding highwaymen teased them for the "solemncholy
way you listen to a lot of snooty French and English and German
cranks and fall for it when they claim you can write better with
a pen than you can with a typewriter."</p>

<p>Lundsgard seemed to be expanding with appreciation, and he had
a good deal of buoyant hydrogen in his chest to expand. Roxy was
his pal. Perhaps he had been bored by Olivia's elegance of old
ivory, and bored even by the fierce, channeled ardor with which
she could vary her level coldness; perhaps, for a time, he might
find the tartness of the rosy apple that was Roxanna spicier than
the richness of Olivia's pear. So Hayden meditated, but he
himself found Roxy's generous enthusiasm of voice somewhat flat
and loud and quacking in competition with Olivia's deep
melodies.</p>

<p>It was when Lundsgard was most admiring himself in Roxy's
mirror and most enjoying an advertisement of his friendliness
with Prince Ugo Tramontana that the slippery minx twisted
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," confided Lundsgard, "I've become quite a buddy of
His Highness and I like . . ."</p>

<p>"A non-royal prince is not a Highness," Roxy cackled. "Don't
be like that, and let 'em see the patched overalls you still wear
under the luscious doctoral robe, dear."</p>

<p>"Why, you little stinker! Me--overalls? Lissen! I don't want
to boast, but I pay my tailor in Hollywood two hundred and
seventeen bucks a suit!" roared the outraged Lorenzo. "And--you
and your alleged knowledge of protocol and titles and that junk!
Let me tell you Ugo is a mighty good intimate of mine and I hang
around that grand old palazzo of his like I would around the
Faculty Club and--everything's worn out and the velvet worn and
those gilt mirrors got liver patches on 'em, but he's got more
doggone medieval paintings and manuscripts by Poliziano (I guess
it is) and old swords than you can shake a stick at, but he
thinks I'm swell, and he says I got what he calls a new vision,
and he likes to try his theories out on me. He <i>said</i>
so!"</p>

<p>Roxanna restored amity and even increased their alliance by
bubbling, "And I'll bet that's true. He knows you aren't tied by
a lot of bum traditions. Sure. He's glad to have a smart scholar
that at the same time's husky and <i>human</i> like you
around."</p>

<p>Nobly pleased, Professor Lundsgard said modestly, "It seems
like he does."</p>

<p>Roxanna did not strike again till after dinner, when Lundsgard
flamboyantly lighted a huge Havana, and she muttered, "My, my,
what a big man that cigar is smoking! I'll bet Prince Ugo gets to
panting when you smoke those El Imperialses around the
palace!"</p>

<p>For once, Olivia giggled and Lundsgard looked wounded, but
again it did not take much of Roxy's gamine art to restore him to
self-admiration, to delight in his little pal.</p>

<p>Hayden thought, "What a stupid, humorless, touchy oaf that man
is! Once Olivia's fling is over--and I think perhaps it is now,
when she's seen him tossed around by a crazy juggler like
Roxy--I'll be able to snatch Olivia back from him, and I can hold
her--for always? I suppose so."</p>

<p>He was sorry for Lundsgard, driven in Roxanna's tinsel reins.
Perhaps Olivia could not avenge Evelyn Hoxler, but Roxanna would
do so, blithely and tenderly and viciously. Poor Lorenzo, shaking
a sceptre hung with jester's bells!</p>

<p>"I think we should all be going home," said Olivia,
tightly.</p>

<p>"See you to your bachelor digs, Rox?" said Lundsgard, the deft
man of the world.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," said Roxy.</p>

<p>"<i>Hay</i>-den! Let's go!" said Olivia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hayden, especially loaned by kindness of Dr. Olivia Lomond for
one evening, was dining with Roxanna among the students at
Camillo's. He was not pleased by the contemptuous hardness which
Roxanna seemed again to be putting on. She was slightly too
showy, in her old green dress with a white turban possibly
modeled on the streamlined yet haremlike Marchesa Valdarno and a
string of jade beads; she was slightly too harsh and
ambition-vaunting as she rattled, "I'm getting my second wind. I
think before long I'll feel like leaving your nice little
Florence."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'little'! It's even bigger than St. Paul,
Minnesota, or Omaha, Nebraska. Why, it's about as big as
Denver!"</p>

<p>"Our Nathan Hale! I am sorry I have but one life to give for
studying the <i>predella</i> on the right of the third picture of
the altar piece in the third chapel of the left aisle of the
sixty-seventh most important ecclesiastical structure in our
sacred Flow-rence! You're as bad a faker as Lorry Lundsgard!"</p>

<p>"Oh. How are you and your Dr. Tarzan progressing?"</p>

<p>"I may give him a tumble, if I don't get the hell out of this
backwater. But as I was saying, pretty soon I may get going now
and leave my set of nursing-bottles for Mother Weepswell, and do
a lot of freelance stories. Have I got ideas now! A piece about
young Italian noblemen, like Roberto Tramontana, who're busted
and who've cheerfully gone to work in garages or any other honest
labor. Heh? Heh? How about it, Uncle Hayden?"</p>

<p>"Roxy darling, don't get too enterprising again. I like you
more when you're gentle."</p>

<p>("Is this young woman nothing more than Caprice with a
passport?")</p>

<p>"And I like you better when you're more brash and neighborly,
Hay. You're in danger of becoming another of these erudite old
gentlemen living lonely in a villino, so dreadfully mild and
well-washed and reticent, knowing all about some old hellhound
like Malatesta Baglioni and nothing about President Truman; a
reservoir that has all the facts and don't know what any of them
signify. Uncle Nat Friar but wrapped in oiled silk. And worse,
you could lose all your democracy here. Oh, you never were a guy
to run out and kiss the postman or make the hired girl have her
supper with the folks, but you did think the postman and hired
girl might get married and have a kid who'd be a better lawyer
than <i>your</i> kid--if you'd only had one, you and Caprice,
poor darling!</p>

<p>"But here, you talk of <i>contadini,</i> of farmers, as if
they couldn't ever be educated like you and me. And like all
Americans, you always overdo. Talk about me overdoing the hustle!
You feel you can't monkey with Italian history at all unless you
become a professor of it, which <i>Gott soll beh&uuml;ten,</i>
you never will. If you were building bungalows with sweety-pie
yellow bathrooms, you'd dream about waffles. If you're learning
Italian, you try to talk same to Heinie tourists and Svensk
trippers. Okay--but don't overdo your underdoing our ole American
democracy, pal!</p>

<p>"You're in <i>much</i> more peril than I am with my play at
dissipation, which I can chuck so easy. <i>Your</i> danger is
virtuous prissiness, and that's a nastier vice than double
martinis. Pete's sake, Hay, don't listen to your old Italian
gorillas roaring so you can't hear the big, sweet hell of a roar
our Americans have always put up, too:</p>

<p>"Casey Jones at the throttle and the old engine moanin'! Bound
away for the Wide Missourai! Banjo on my knee. Frankie and Johnny
root-a-toot-tootin'! In the evening by the moonlight, the old
folks singing! Boy! Am I proud of our own troubadours! And you
forgetting them for English skylarks and some dinky little thin
song by Petrarch about a girl he never even made!"</p>

<p>Vigorously, from Hay, "I don't forget them! Never! Sitting in
San Miniato, looking at the altar-screen, I caught myself humming
<i>Casey Jones!</i> Besides, you're a true Westerner; you've
heard some Old Timers sing hallelujahs. But most American kids
today have only learned our ballads, rejoiced in our own
tradition, when they've heard 'em--if they <i>could</i> hear 'em
over the smack of their chewing gum, on the radio, rollicked out
by some ferocious Nevada thousand-dollar-a-week singing cowboy
who was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and learned his Native
Western American melodies in the glee club at the Southern New
Jersey School of Accountancy. Or the fat man who gets up and
sings 'em with the soloist at a New York night club--he's a
Native Cal-y-for-ny-an born in Lithuania!</p>

<p>"Besides--now, for the first time, America belongs to the
world, not just to America, and Casey Jones has to take his
chance against the skylark and Laura and Roland and Nicolette and
all of them, and not complain, as you do <i>for</i> him, if
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon drowns him out! Casey's been a sensitive
plant too long--sheltered by the Wide Missourai!"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay! Slap Walt Whitman up against Gilbert and Sullivan
and see if he's so cute. But if you're going to be so darned
world-conscious, Hay, you got to get out of Florence--I mean, the
Limey-Yankee Florence. It's such a hick village! It gossips worse
than Bison Park ever thought of! Tessie Weepswell and Sam
Dodsworth and even Mrs. D. gossip about you all day long. Will
you marry Olivia? (And may she develop the bots!) If you stop on
the Tornabuoni and talk to some old rabbit for two minutes at
noon, the Colony has complete details by one-thirty and talks
about your new romance all afternoon.</p>

<p>"And then that ratty bunch of American pansies that sit at the
same bar, every afternoon, out on the sidewalk, exhibiting their
beauties to any visiting firemen fairies that may happen to hit
town. Provincial? Good Lord, those serious young men of talent
are so busy, just like the gang at the Newlife Bonanza Poolroom,
talking all day, that they don't even get around to see the
Uffizi Gallery once a month.</p>

<p>"No, my boy. You either disappear into <i>Italian</i>
Florence--I've heard there used to be one--or else go on to Paris
or Zurich or Newlife, Colorado, or one of those universal cities.
And take your O-ly-vya with you. And <i>try</i> not to push her
off an Alp on the way!"</p>

<p>Hayden said, "Well . . ."</p>

<p>Roxanna might, he thought uncomfortably, be right. He might
drift here into a negligent snobbishness in which only persons
with art-vocabularies or titles or official posts would seem to
master. He ought, he thought, to see more of Roxy and get more
actively into soul-saving; save hers from the suave brutality of
female careerism--save himself from the fussy brutality of
damning Perpetua every time she moved a book on his reading
table.</p>

<p>To an ironic Olivia, late that evening, after a good-natured
but uncompromising parting with Roxanna, he explained that he
really had to be neighborly with his old friend Roxy and not let
the poor waif stumble into alien pitfalls alone.</p>

<p>"You mean she'll land softer if you stumble with her?" said
Olivia. "Go ahead. . . . Heavens, Hayden! Do you suppose for one
moment I could be jealous of a street Arab like your Roxanna?
Don't insult me! Spend <i>all</i> your evenings--and nights,
too--with her, if it amuses you."</p>

<p>Olivia was too willing. He wondered, a thousand times, if the
high spirits of Roxanna had not already enticed Lundsgard away
from Olivia; if that lady, born to Byzantine courts and
trafficking for Hellenic manuscripts in Cyprus, was becoming
silkenly double-faced.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact his two or three dinners alone with
Roxanna were but mildly devoted to her endangered morals. It
proved that Roxy had, as most diners-out had not, as Olivia
sniffily had not, his own trick of telling himself exclamatory
stories about all of his fellow diners at a restaurant, and that
was a trick well shared and inducing common excitement. At the
Oliviero, most cosmopolitan restaurant in town, they picked out a
French diplomat (he was probably a Milanese manufacturer), a
Chinese general (probably Burmese). They looked sidewise,
inconspicuously but intensely, at a quarreling young couple, and
speculated, "I wonder if we hadn't better go over and tell him
that his girl has too rocky a jaw, for all her funny nose, and
he'd better duck before she shackles him for life?"</p>

<p>Always it was what Roxanna called "good fun." And then she
would infuriate him by returning to the charge that he was
becoming a frail old scholar-hermit, and she would defend Lorenzo
as a good fellow who had antagonized Hayden only by being his own
honest, rollicking self.</p>

<p>At the next dinner out of the three, Roxanna said to
Lundsgard, derisively, "How's all your lovely wives keeping,
Loraccio?"</p>

<p>"You mean my girl friends here? Why, sweetness, I haven't got
any except you and Livy, who're both gone on that frozen-faced
hermit, Hay."</p>

<p>"No, Professor, I don't mean us. <i>Wives,</i> I said!"</p>

<p>Lundsgard's "I dunno whacha talking about" was blurred and
most unprofessional.</p>

<p>"It's none of my business and I don't care a hoot, but I'm a
reporter, and don't ever let them tell you I'm not a good one.
Anyway, a busy one. You're always explaining to everybody that
you've never slipped into wedlock. You were just mean, when you
were a rosy-cheeked young instructor with goldie tresses, to some
juicy little cricket named Bessie, and she canned you for your
he-man tyranny.</p>

<p>"But I've been snooping--pumping some of the American students
here that you've been chummy with. And I wrote a few letters to a
script-writer that I know in Hollywood. And I am now able to
inform you--it may be no news to you, Lorry, but it will interest
Livy: you were married, bell, book and neon lights, to two
different cuties and got divorced by one after two years and by
'tother after eighteen months--grounds, in both cases, amnesia
about who you were really married to. Oh, it's okay, but I just
feel we'll all be happier, as simple, trusting American girls, if
we could expect a consignment of home truth now and then!"</p>

<p>Olivia was rigidly furious.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know why we should hear all this. Mr.
Lundsgard is my employer, and nothing else. I have no slightest
interest in his private affairs of any sort!"</p>

<p>It was Lundsgard who was surprisingly undisturbed.</p>

<p>He snorted, "So you took enough interest in poor old Lorry to
really get busy and find out about him, heh? Yuh, I guess your
yarn is more or less true, Rox. I never could see why I should
bother you folks with my troubles, but believe me, I could a tale
unfold of a couple of the nastiest little tramps you ever heard
of, if I hadn't made it an iron-clad rule to never yap about my
wounds but just bear 'em in silence. But I will say," and he
looked at Roxanna and then at Olivia as fondly as though they
were two lovely little breakfast sausages and he a hungry hero,
"that an awful lot of women hung around hoping to comfort me,
after the obsequies."</p>

<p><i>"Did</i> they, big boy!" slashed Roxanna.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if we forget all of this and talk about something
more interesting?" grated Olivia.</p>

<p>Curiously, during the rest of that meal, Lundsgard looked most
fondly upon Roxanna, and argued down Olivia's evasive doubts when
Roxy announced that the one thing in the world she wanted to do
was to get invited to lunch with Sir Henry Belfont.</p>

<p>They all did go, as arranged and tourist-guided by Mr. Hayden
Chart.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>24</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They were only six at lunch: Sir Henry and Lady Belfont,
Olivia and Roxanna, Hayden and Lundsgard, who had brought Roxanna
in a taxicab and who seemed, on landing, to be more gurglingly
intimate with Roxy than before her revelations of his multiple
marriages.</p>

<p>When Sir Henry found that Roxy was esteemed not only by the
unimportant onlooker, Hayden, but by the favorite courtier,
Professor Lundsgard, he was markedly attentive to her, and
honored her with a portentous discourse on American Womanhood.
You gather that he did not think much of it.</p>

<p>Roxy listened pertly; Lady Belfont pointedly did not listen at
all but, with small sharp eyes, examined Roxy and apparently
passed her.</p>

<p>Yet after Sir Henry had accepted her and she should have put
on the manners of a Belgravia governess, Roxanna was very
naughty. Sir Henry belched at her, "Gracious little lady, you are
fortunate in being able to tarry for a while in the City of the
Lilies. Most of your dreadful American females who come here, so
uninvited--gauche schoolteachers and librarians and the
like--remain only twelve hours or a day or two, and scamper on to
Rome."</p>

<p>But Roxanna was not grateful for this implication of her
superiority.</p>

<p>She took from an overdecorated spectacle case of Florentine
leather-work, with golden scrolls on blue and sealbrown, and put
on a pair of Hollywoodized tinted sun-glasses, huge and
aggressive affairs with harlequin frames of pink plastic. Through
these insulting portholes she stared at Sir Henry, and blatted,
"Maybe the poor darlings of teachers haven't enough cash to stick
it out here any longer, and they got to 'scamper.' Maybe they'd
stay here for years, too, if they'd inherited a wad of
money."</p>

<p>Every one, but especially Sir Henry and perhaps Roxanna
herself, seemed to consider her tone offensive. He gulped; he
tried to forgive this curious campfollower of his favorite
Lorenzo; and he sailed on:</p>

<p>"Conceivably that may be their melancholy plight, though I
cannot understand why middle-class persons, particularly your
Americans, should be privileged to come to our Florence at all.
Such ecstasy, Miss Eldritch, is no part of our common rights,
like bread and beer; it is a delightful good fortune which the
prankish gods may bestow or deny at their will, quite
unaccountably.</p>

<p>"But all of your vast, marvelous country, Miss Eldritch, is
full of false claims and assertions and astounding optimism.
Children over there invariably address their fathers not with
obedient reverence but--I shudder--'Hya, Pop'! And <i>them,</i> I
fancy, even your kind heart could scarcely categorize as 'poor
darlings'! Eh?"</p>

<p>Said Roxy, "In the first place, mostly they don't say it, and
if they did, it would just show they liked their dads enough to
want to be chummy with them."</p>

<p>For a time, then, Roxanna was not offensive. But when Sir
Henry had rambled, "When we consider that there once existed a
Raphael, the insanities of these contemporary artists become not
merely mawkish but blasphemous," then Roxy struck again. She
turned her impertinent Hollywood sun-glasses on Belfont, and she
piped, "Maybe that's what the old boys said about Rafe, too, when
he was beginning."</p>

<p>Sir Henry looked stricken. Lady Belfont, behind the mild harem
bars of a tiny lace handkerchief, seemed to be giggling. Hayden
was definitely impatient with Roxy for her pointless rudeness; he
was definitely sorry for Sir Henry, whom he could see now as a
pathetic old actor getting his first hisses and trying to take
them gallantly.</p>

<p>Hayden thought, "The man is a bore and a snob. He's built up a
social position to which he has to sacrifice everything. He has
built a jail and shut himself up in it. He can never have any fun
at all--never can laugh or talk easily or be flippant or go to a
movie and dine with poor people, lest he be seen. Poor, timid,
wheezing Pekingese in the body of a mastiff! I am extremely
annoyed with Roxanna, as much for her pretentious spectacles as
for her sauciness--which certainly does no credit to the good
manners that we do have in Newlife. A splendid missionary of hate
she is! Mark Twain's bumptious rustic, his Innocent Abroad. Still
with us!"</p>

<p>Sir Henry was not enfeebled by Roxy's impertinence, but
angered. It was a long time since any one had dared to make small
of such a formidable monument of guineas capped with a baronetcy.
This was indeed his notion of blasphemy. But he counterattacked
Roxy with stately tolerance for such small female bugs:</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, I agree that had he existed in your
America, Raffaello would have been denounced in his own day. I
quite understand that--quite. I am not shocked but only grieved
by the irreverence and boorishness that is, perhaps, to be
expected from such a lusty young giant of a country. For, indeed,
some of my own relatives belong to you good American people."</p>

<p>Then, to the horror of everybody except Lady Belfont, whose
lips danced, and of the butler, who slapped a napkin over his
mouth and fled from the room, Roxy demanded, "Sir Henry, don't
all of your own relatives belong to us good American people?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!"</p>

<p>"Including your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!"</p>

<p>"I heard so many interesting things about you from a
newspaperman who used to be your secretary. You fired
him--remember?--for laughing when a dinky gilt chair busted under
you. He was left stranded--bad. This fellow, the rat, he told me
that you never saw England or the Continent till you were
fourteen. You were born in Ohio and your Grampa Belfont--if that
was the name--started the family fortunes during our American
Civil War by selling adulterated drugs and shoddy uniforms to the
North and South equally."</p>

<p>Sir Henry was paralyzed. The thing was so monstrous that even
the competent Hayden, the managerial Lundsgard were paralyzed, as
Roxy went smilingly on:</p>

<p>"This ex-secretary said it cost you sixteen years of living in
Kent and London and getting snubbed practically every hour, and
then forty-five thousand pounds in cash, to buy a seat in
Parliament and finally an unpaid job as a baronet. But he said,
this beast, that he guessed that to the miners who work in your
Kentucky coal mines it was worth every shilling. But this
tattle-tale couldn't possibly have been right, now could he!"</p>

<p>Sir Henry with his death pangs just slightly eased, croaked,
"He certainly could not."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. For instance: how could he know exactly how much
you paid for your title? Maybe they stuck you much more than
forty-five thousand pounds. And I do want to say how wise I think
you were to move on to Italy. In England, you must have found it
so hard to get away with the pose of being English."</p>

<p>Sir Henry rose, but it was not Roxanna whom he was denouncing;
it was astonishingly his admirer and fellow fraud, Professor
Lorenzo Lundsgard:</p>

<p>"Lundsgard, you plotted this outrage, sir. You brought in this
woman, whom I shall certainly have the police investigate. And as
for <i>you,</i> sir, I shall write this very afternoon to the
president of Cornucopia Films--of which I happen to own
fifty-seven percent--recommending that they give up their plan to
make a Medici picture, or any other amateurish nonsense that you
may plan, ever, and denounce you to your lecture agents as a
half-witted booby. Good day, ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>He marched out, followed by a cattishly smiling Lady Belfont.
The butler hurried back in, to take the better silver out with
him for safeguarding.</p>

<p>Lundsgard screamed, "My God, we got to do something!"</p>

<p>Roxy said comfortably, "Not me! I've always been hankering to
blow up that pompous old shyster, after what this kid, my friend,
told me about him in London."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Roxanna," Hayden said sharply.</p>

<p>Olivia, with unexpected independence, stated, "Roxanna was
inexcusably rude and vulgar, but it is our fault for bringing her
here. We should have understood that she would not know even the
first duties of being a decent guest."</p>

<p>Roxanna cried, "Hey, now look here, you!" but Olivia iced her
out with, "Although I am quite indifferent to what Mr. Belfont
thinks of me. In my group, we consider him an incompetent
dilettante."</p>

<p>Lundsgard was raging, "You've all got to put your heads
together and help me--and you, Roxy, I'm certainly going to
throttle you! I'm ruined, if Cornucopia Films welch on me. Didn't
you realize that, Roxy, you dangerous little fool?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Lor-en-zo, I had some idea of it. I've just sort of
been resenting your idea I would be an easy conquest. I'm not a
round-heel like Livy."</p>

<p>Olivia was a leopard leaping. "You little vixen! And I am not
a . . . I don't even know what the vile word means!"</p>

<p>"How come it makes you so sore then?"</p>

<p>Hayden gravely interposed--though he too was being forced up
to a plane of screaming: "I think you've done enough harm,
Roxanna--and don't be so smug about your efficiency as a
guttersnipe. We are justifying Sir Henry in his hatred of us
Americans--of his own countrymen! We must leave this house."</p>

<p>"You simply got to come to my office and help me fix this
thing up," besought Lundsgard. "You can't see me busted like
this. We'll all tell Sir Henry that Roxanna is hysterical. We
just learned it--we've thrown her right smack out on her back,
bang, for keeps. . . ."</p>

<p>To point it all up, the butler came back to inform Lundsgard
that his taxicab (which Lundsgard had never ordered) was
waiting.</p>

<p>As he drove Olivia to Lundsgard's office in the small car,
Hayden imagined from blocks away that he could hear Roxy and
Lundsgard quarreling in their cab, but he had little time for
imaginings. He was occupied with listening to Olivia, and Olivia
had an eloquence she never got out of Machiavelli.</p>

<p>"This whole boresome incident has been a revelation to me,
Hayden. I saw what a cowering coward Lorry is--or Lawrence or
Oley or whatever he is. I'm not sure but that he's even worse
than your shrieking, hair-pulling young fishwife, Roxanna."</p>

<p>"Now, now, she isn't a . . ."</p>

<p>"She is too, and you know it! And I want you to be as honest
about this as I am; I want you to admit your blindness, as I
certainly admit mine, now. The veil of sensuality has been lifted
from before my eyes; that horrible, sooty veil. I see now--I was
a fool and an ingrate not to see it before. It's you, not I, who
are the artist-scholar. Hayden dear, you, not Lorry, who are the
true Magnificent, without flashy banners.</p>

<p>"For a while I fell into an illusion--it doubtless came from
overmuch reading of medieval chronicles and ballads, but still,
it was childish and inexcusable--an illusion that a man ought to
be obviously splendid: the knight crusader, daring and poetic,
the Duke of Urbino, the battle-breaker, the patron of poets and
artists; powerful, cloaked in brocade, belted with a great sword,
surrounded by medieval color and all the respect of a medieval
court.</p>

<p>"I dreamed, in this schoolgirl dream, that he should travel
wide and swiftly, have his commands obeyed swiftly; be
extravagant and sometimes ruthless, and forever uplift the whole
groveling world by his gorgeous example.</p>

<p>"What a sentimental fool I was! I see that that kind of an
idea is more likely to produce a pompous fraud like Belfont or a
pilfering clown like Lundsgard than a man like <i>you,</i> who is
strong enough to be willing to be quiet!"</p>

<p>She kissed him tremendously, to his considerable discomfiture
while tacking in the topolino among the trucks, cars,
motorcycles, vespas--motorcycles with platforms and tin
aprons--bicycles, scooters, pedestrians reading the newspapers
while suicidally strolling, which so interestingly complicate the
traffic of Florence. But these dangers did not dismay him so much
as the thought that he was caught for good, and that the world
which Olivia would now permit him to see would not be very
wide.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm not always so quiet," he fretted. "And I'm not
sure I can ever do much with the Magnificence role, with or
without banners. Olivia, I wonder--does it ever occur to you that
maybe we're making a mistake? Perhaps we're both too stubborn to
be married."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! We'll both learn."</p>

<p>"But can we? Just because you <i>are</i> so capable, you'll
always be pretty independent."</p>

<p>"I suppose our hoyden friend Roxanna is your idea of
pliability!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a pirate, but same time, she never fools herself,
as you and I do. I admire her a lot. Olivia! Let's not be too
sure about our marriage. It scares me a little."</p>

<p>"Not me. You just do what I tell you to, and you'll be
happy."</p>

<p>"Maybe!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>They parked the topolino at the Excelsior just as Roxanna and
Lundsgard were leaving their taxicab. They four went up in the
elevator, but there were two English ladies in it, making that
apartment unsuitable for expert quarreling. Not till they had
entered Lundsgard's office, where Nat Friar sat with his large,
dusty boots up on a desk, his rustic straw hat over his eyes,
alternately reading a Dorothy Sayers thriller and Monnier's <i>Le
Quattrocento,</i> was Lundsgard able to attack:</p>

<p>"I don't know which of you two women is the worst slut and the
most ungrateful!"</p>

<p>Hayden had achieved only a sharp, "We'll have no more of . .
." when he was interrupted by Uncle Nat. As his boots banged down
on the floor, Nat fussily poked his straw hat into a wastebasket
and spoke:</p>

<p>"Lundsgard, I don't like your manner. Remember there are
gentlemen present. By the way, before you discharge me, may I say
that I am leaving you for a job in a travel agency? I shall be
paid only one-fifth as much, but there I shall be doing nothing
more evil than to direct homeless travelers to corrugated beds.
It may be that after a month I shall feel somewhat cleansed from
the sin of having helped you to corrupt that great lady,
Learning."</p>

<p>Angelo Gazza, the photographer, was just coming in and at him
Lundsgard shrieked, <i>"You,</i> anyway--you're
<i>fired!"</i></p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm not! Professor Friar told me his plan to quit,
and I'm rat number two. You, the big athlete, that thought he
could kick history around like a football! You're going to feel
funny when you get back to teaching schoolboys and tell 'em what
a hit you were in Italy with all the princes and the
cardinals--and see that not one of your students believes
you--ever. Blackboards again, and chalkdust and weekly themes!
<i>Addio, tutti! Ciao,</i> Oley!"</p>

<p>The stricken Lundsgard pressed his eyes with his large,
beringed hands and stood shaking, and from this spectacle of doom
they crept out in pity.</p>

<p>"I hate these renegades like ourselves," Nat Friar said to
Hayden, Olivia, Roxy, Angelo, "who triumph over less virtuous
scoundrels like Lundsgard. We are so much less colorful. May I
buy you all a last cognac? We shall toast the fallen idol. It
will probably be the last toast that anybody will ever drink to
Mr. Lundsgard."</p>

<p>In the Piazza della Republica, shabby small boys were begging
and the old scavengers were picking up cigarette butts. All the
umbrellas over the outdoor caf&eacute; tables had blossomed in
front of Gilli's; the gentle violet-seller circulated and girls
laughed in peace.</p>

<p>"Can Olivia and I <i>ever</i> leave Florence?" Hayden
wondered.</p>

<p>From the caf&eacute;, Hayden and Olivia and Roxanna walked
away, but with Roxy only tagging.</p>

<p>Olivia was holding Hayden's arm. She sighed, "Ohhhh!"--a
hungry sound. She mourned, "I don't know how many kinds of a fool
and bully I've been, but I think I've paid for all of them. Lorry
looks at me now with such hatred; he makes me feel loose and
compromised. But you, my good angel, you'll never be treacherous
as Lorry is--as I've been! You'll never take your obligations
lightly. In your presence, I feel absolved and secure."</p>

<p>She held his arm the more tightly and as he managed an
embarrassed glance at her, he saw that her forehead was serene,
her eyes were clear and tender; she was angelic again and
splendid and desirable.</p>

<p>He felt manacled by her lovely ivory hand. How could he desert
this passionate woman whom he had helped to destroy, whom he must
help to restore to her principalities?</p>

<p>But he ached for his solitary room and the sweet drudgery of
books and, after certain years of them, to venture onward to the
brazen sea of Arabia, the West Indian islands shining at dawn,
the high lone whistling passes of the Himalayas. On such
unscheduled wandering, Olivia would never accompany him. Her love
would encompass him, but bind him.</p>

<p>They were at the Palazzo Spizzi.</p>

<p>Roxanna caught up with them and proposed, "How about a dish of
tea?"</p>

<p>With a remarkably chilly, "Not for me, thanks--perhaps Hayden
will care for one," Olivia curtly left them, went into the
Palazzo.</p>

<p>"How about you?" Roxy hesitated.</p>

<p>"I'd love some," said Hayden, and they strolled on to a small
tea-shop off the Tornabuoni. As they sat down, Roxy sighed:</p>

<p>"I know I've already talked too much today, but one more
thing. I used to respect you so, Hay, for your dignity and
honesty. Now it kills me to see you turned into Livy's
stooge."</p>

<p>Hayden was working up to a denial, but Roxy clattered on:</p>

<p>"I loathe seeing you get all silent and intense again the way
you used to be with Caprice. But I guess you must have it--you
bleating <i>martyr!</i> When I get back to Newlife and the
mountains--that big, huge place where you look up to the horizon,
where there's freedom to be ignorant of the ruling dynasty of
Piacenza, I'll think of you solemnly grinding away here, trying
to satisfy Professor Olivia! But I hope I'll have your
forgiveness for having plagued you, and for having been a pest
today."</p>

<p>Roxy, on the wall-bench beside him, was suddenly crying, a
defenseless and bewildered child. She spoke through sobs like the
sobs of a child, hurt, broken, bewildered:</p>

<p>"Oh, darling Hay, I thought you'd all be delighted to have me
show up that old sergeant-major, Harry Belfont, today, and get
him off your necks!"</p>

<p>Hayden was trembling, but he tried to be hard-hearted. "It was
needless and cruel of you. The old comedian is perfectly
harmless."</p>

<p>He was glad that a serving-table concealed them from the rest
of the tea-shop.</p>

<p>Roxy was still broken with sobbing as she stammered, "Maybe
he's harmless but you all talk so's you'll impress him. I wanted
to help you, even Livy. But then I saw you all hated me and
despised me for bawling him out--shanty Irish, flannel-mouth,
nuisance!"</p>

<p>Roxy was crying hard now. He touched her shoulder and she
melted against him, she seemed to melt into him, to be one with
him. She was a familiar part of him and his own land. There was a
sweet wild smell about her, like sagebrush. He cried, "Why, I'm
in love with you, Roxy, and I always have been!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that? Did you have to go to Italy and read
all about arquebuses and apses, to find that out?"</p>

<p>"Will you go with me to Burma and Brazil and Damascus?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>He kissed Roxanna, very happily.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was later, as tea prolonged into dinner, that he said
sadly, "But Roxy, I'm no good. I seem to honor women, and yet I
help to destroy them--Caprice and now Olivia."</p>

<p>"Sure you do. You let them use you and tyrannize over you. No
woman that ever lived can stand that much privilege. I'm likely
to try it on, too, but maybe not, because I've been in love with
you too many years. You know something? Here's the real secret of
my life:</p>

<p>"When you were an old man of eighteen, very handsome and
dignified, like a secretary of state, you were rehearsing your
salutatorian's essay for Commencement exercises, in the empty
auditorium of the Kit Carson High School, all by yourself--you
thought you were. But I was curled up behind a row of seats in
the balcony, making myself very small and silent, sucking my
lollypop in the utmost silence. I was an earnest young lady of
ten, then. I meant to be a United States Senator, and you were my
model. (You were to be President.)</p>

<p>"You carried on something wonderful; all about the
International Court and how nice it would be if all the nations
would listen to you and learn about justice. It sounded swell! I
just knelt there and said to myself, 'Some day I'm going to marry
that man, even if I have to follow him to Denver or even
Minneapolis.' I didn't count on Italy. That's how you slipped me!
Dear Hay!"</p>

<p>"Dear Roxy!" he said earnestly.</p>

<p>But he had a worry.</p>

<p>"Now, I have to go tell Olivia, I suppose!"</p>

<p>Roxy said brightly, "Want me to do it for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I <i>think</i> I can manage it," groaned Hayden.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The wedding of Hayden and Roxanna--the civil service in the
office of the kindly American Consul, and the religious service
at St. James's church--was an Event, attended by all the
Anglo-American Colony except Sir Henry Belfont.</p>

<p>Dr. Olivia Lomond was at the church, looking contented and
superior. She was warmly on the arm of the chief foreign official
then to be found in Florence: the newly appointed First Assistant
American Cultural Commissioner to Peru, a confident, beaming,
success-radiating magnifico in morning clothes and Ascot tie. His
name was Professor the Hon. Lorenzo O. Lundsgard, Ph. D.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They were in Rapallo.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll do that then, unless we want to change our
minds," said Roxanna. "Go home by way of Ceylon and India and
Japan, if they'll let us in. Home! But if I ever catch you
getting to be successful, I'll snatch you back here, for a course
in humility. Maybe we came to Italy too late. We'll never speak
the lingo so naturally that we won't even notice we're speaking
it. But there is something great here for us--so great because it
is so quiet. The American Colonists in Florence are richer in
their hearts than the Men of Distinction back home that take
themselves so seriously selling whisky or lawsuits or
college-alumni enthusiasm. Oh, darling, am I holding forth?"</p>

<p>"Yes--yes," amiably.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! But you never help me. I suppose you have to be
born to it, to know how to beat women, and you weren't."</p>

<p>"I'll try."</p>

<p>"Look. When we get to Rome, are there any more presents we'll
have to buy? Last minute in Florence, I got a leather box for
Aunt Tib, and the rosary for Lizzie Edison and the linen
luncheon-set for Mrs. Dr. Crittenham and a souvenir deck of cards
for Bill and Jean Windelbank (won't we enjoy talking over Europe
with <i>them!</i>) and the Venetian glass and the blue-and-gold
spectacle case for Mary Eliza Bradbin. It'll be such fun to see
her when she gets it!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Such fun"--he realized how often Roxanna said it, as hand in
hand they walked through Ravenna. Even King Theodoric's Arian
cathedral and the tomb of the Empress Honoria she found "such
fun," and he wondered if their sculptors had not also considered
them "fun."</p>

<p>"Dear Roxy," he said, even in the sanctity of Dante's
tomb.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Far up in the mountains behind Salerno, one light persisted
while their steamer plodded southward from Naples, bound out for
Smyrna and Alexandria.</p>

<p>Was it a light in the hut of a peasant or of some studious
hermit-priest, a priest in that sacred land where Hayden had
known defeat and glory, where he had begun to know himself?</p>

<p>"Do you think we might have one modest drink before we turn
in?" said Roxanna.</p>

<p>"I think that might be possible, if the bartender is
kind-hearted."</p>

<p>"The bartender is Italian," said Roxy, "and he speaks English,
French, German, Spanish, Swedish, Polish, Croatian and some
Arabic. His name is Fortunato, and he was born in Reggio Emilia,
but his wife was born in Bari. He has two children, a girl of
seven and a son, six, and he likes Italian crossword-puzzles--he
is such fun. He has a cousin in San Jose, California--Giuseppina
Vespi of 1127 Citrus Court. She is married to an upholsterer
named Joe Murphy and they have two children. I am to send her a
picture post card from Palermo. I'm sleepy. Let's have that drink
and then turn in."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Hayden.</p>
