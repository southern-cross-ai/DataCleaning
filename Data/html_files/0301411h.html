<h1>THE PAINTED FLOOR</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter Pentecost, from his eyrie among the hazels, looked down
on the King's highway as it dipped from Stowood through the
narrow pass to the Wood Eaton meadows. It was a King's highway
beyond question, for it was the main road from London to
Worcester and the west for those who did not wish to make Oxford
a halting-place; but it was a mere ribbon of rutted turf, with on
each side the statutory bowshot of cleared ground between it and
the forest fringes. And, as he looked, he saw the seventh
magpie.</p>

<p>Peter was country-bred and had country lore in the back of his
mind. Also, being a scholar, he respected auspices. So, having no
hat to doff, he pulled his forelock. Seven magpies in one day
must portend something great.</p>

<p>He had set off that summer morning on an errand for the
cellarer of Oseney Abbey to the steward of the King's manor of
Beckley, some matter touching supplies for the Abbey kitchen. The
sun had risen through lamb's-wool mists, the river was a
fleckless sheet of silver, and Peter had consecrated the day to
holiday. He had done his errand long before noon, and had spent
an hour watching the blue lagoons on Otmoor (there was much water
out, for July had begun with rains), with the white geese like
foam on the edges. The chantry priest at Horton had given him
food--a crust only and a drink of ale, for the priest was bitter
poor--and in the afternoon he had wandered in the Stowood glades,
where the priory of Studley had right of pannage and the good
sisters' droves of swine rooted for earth-nuts. Peter was young,
and holiday and high summertide could still intoxicate. He had
lain on the spicy turf of the open spaces, his nose deep in thyme
and rock-rose; he had made verses in the shadow of the great oaks
which had been trees when Domesday Book was written; he had told
his dreams aloud to himself at the well under the aspens where
the Noke fletchers cut their arrows. The hours had slipped by
unnoted, and the twilight was beginning when he reached his
favourite haunt, a secret armchair of rock and grass above the
highway. He had seen four magpies, so something was on the
way.</p>

<p>The first things he saw in the amethyst evening were two more
of the pied birds, flapping down the hollow towards Wood Eaton.
After them came various figures, for at that hour the road seemed
to have woken into life. Travellers appeared on it like an
evening hatch of gnats.</p>

<p>First came a couple of friars--Franciscans by their grey
habits--who had been exploiting the faithful in the Seven Towns
of Otmoor. Their wallets swung emptily, for the moor-men had a
poor repute among the religious. They would sleep the night, no
doubt, in the Islip tithe-barn. After them appeared one of the
Stowood hogwards, with the great cudgel of holly which was the
badge of his trade. Peter knew what he was after. In the dusk he
would get a rabbit or two for his supper on the edge of the Wood
Eaton warren, for the hogwards were noted poachers.</p>

<p>From his view-point he could see half a mile down the road,
from the foot of the hill to where it turned a corner and was
lost in the oakwoods of the flats. It was like the stage of a
Christmas mumming play, and Peter settled himself comfortably in
his lair, and waited with zest for the entry of the next actors.
This time it was a great wool-convoy, coming towards him from the
Cherwell. He watched the laden horses strain up the slope, eleven
of them, each like a monstrous slug buried in its wool-pack.
There were five attendants, four on foot and one riding a slim
shaggy grey pony. They might be London bound, or more likely for
Newbury, where Jack Winchcombe had his great weaving mill and the
workmen wrought all day in sheds high and dim as a minster--so
many workmen that their master twenty years back had led his own
battalion of spinners, carders and tuckers to Flodden Field.
Peter viewed the convoy with no friendly eye. The wool barons
were devouring the countryside, and ousting the peasants. He had
seen with his own eyes hamlets obliterated by the rising tide of
pasture. Up in Cotswold the Grevels and Celys and Midwinters
might spend their wealth in setting up proud churches, but God
would not be bribed. Let them remember Naboth's vineyard, those
oppressors of the poor. Had not the good Sir Thomas More cried
out that in England the sheep were eating up the men?</p>

<p>The next arrival was a troop of gipsies, a small furtive
troop, three donkeys laden with gear, five men on foot, and two
women, each with an infant at breast. In his childhood Peter
remembered how these vagabonds had worn gaudy clothes and played
openly on fantastic instruments of music; they were shameless
priggers and rufflers, but they were welcomed everywhere except
by the dwellers in lonely places, for they brought mirth and
magic to the countryside. Now they were under the frown of the
law, and at the will of any justice could be banished forth of
England, for it was believed that among them they harboured Scots
and Spaniards, and plotted against the King's peace. This troop
were clad like common peasants, and drab and dingy at that, but
there was no mistaking their lightfoot gait, and even at that
distance Peter could mark their hazel-nut skins and bird-like
beaks. They came on the stage stealthily, first reconnoitring the
patch of open road, and, when they neared the other corner,
sending out a scout to prospect ahead. Peter saw the scout turn
his head and give a signal, and in a second the Egyptians,
donkeys and all, had taken cover like weasels, and were deep in
the wayside scrub.</p>

<p>Presently the cause was apparent. Down the hill trotted an
imposing cavalcade, four gentlemen, no less than six servants
armed with curtal-axes, and two led baggage-horses. One of the
gentlemen was old, and his white hair mingled with the ermine
collar of his purple cloak. The others rode cloakless in the warm
evening. Two had the look of lawyers, being all in black and
white, except for their tawny horsemen's boots, but the fourth
was a gay gallant, with a wine-red doublet, a laced shirt,
sleeves monstrously puffed and slashed, and on his head a velvet
bonnet with a drooping blue feather. Two of the servants carried
at their saddle-bows the flat leather boxes which scriveners
used. Peter guessed their errand. They were some of the
commissioners whom the King was sending far and wide throughout
the land to examine into the condition of the religious houses.
Their destination might be the Augustinians at Bicester or the
Benedictines at Eynsham--the latter he thought, for there were
better roads to Bicester from London than this, and these men
were doubtless from the capital. They were in a hurry, and passed
out of sight at a sharp trot, the led horses shying at the smell
of the gipsy donkeys hidden in the covert. In two hours' time
they would be supping off Thames trout--for it was a Friday--in
the Eynsham fratry.</p>

<p>When the last of the company had jolted round the far corner
the stage was empty for a while. The amethyst was going out of
the air, and giving place to that lemon afterglow which in a fine
summer never leaves the sky till it is ousted by the splendours
of dawn. The ribbon of road was beginning to glimmer white, and
the high wooded sides of the glen to lose their detail to the eye
and become massed shadows. . . . But the play was not yet ended,
for up the road towards him came a solitary rider.</p>

<p>Down a gap from the west fell a shaft of lingering sunlight
which illumined the traveller. Peter saw a tall man mounted on a
weedy roan, which seemed to have come far, for it stumbled at the
lift of the hill. His head was covered with an old plumeless
bonnet, he had no cloak, his doublet was plain grey, his trunks
seemed to be of leather, and between them and his boots were hose
of a dingy red. He wore a narrow belt fastened in front with a
jewel, and from that belt hung a silver dagger-sheath, while at
his side dangled a long sword. But it did not need the weapons to
proclaim that this was no servant. The man's whole poise spoke of
confidence and pride. His shaven face was weathered like a
tinker's, his eyes searched the covert as if looking for
opposition, his mouth was puckered to a whistle, and now and then
he flung back his head and sniffed the evening odours.</p>

<p>Peter watched and admired with a pain at his heart. Here was
one who rode the broad ways of the world and feared nothing; a
masterful man who would have his way with life; one who had seen
with his own eyes that wonderful earth of which Peter had only
read; a fierce soul who would be a deadly enemy, but who might
also be a delectable comrade, for there was ease and jollity in
his air. Peter sighed at this glimpse of the unattainable.</p>

<p>And then he saw the seventh magpie.</p>

<p>The heats of the day, the constant feasting of the eyes upon
blue horizons, had had the effect of wine upon Peter's brain, and
this drunkenness had been increased by the spectacle of the
masterful traveller. The scholar, whose days were spent among
books, felt himself within hail of the pomp of life. He had
almost forgotten the heavy thoughts which had burdened him so
many days. The hour was growing late, and he was miles from his
bed in the Castle precincts, but he had no intention of going
home yet awhile. For he was near to a place which was his own
discovery, his special sanctuary, and he was minded to visit it
before he slept. . . .</p>

<p>And then came the seventh magpie, a chequered zigzag in that
dim world. The bird was an invitation to adventure. Peter rose
from his eyrie, shook the moss and twigs from his clothes, and
scrambled down the slope to the highway. He was clad in a tunic
and long summer hose of thin woollen, and his gown, which was the
badge of studentship, he carried loose on his arm.</p>

<p>He padded in the sweet-smelling dust of the road for a little
way, and then turned to his left to climb the farther side of the
hollow. He had forgotten about the Egyptians in the covert. They
were still there, and had settled down for the night, for
suddenly he saw in a cleft beside him the glow of a little fire
on which a pot was bubbling. He was too late to avoid it, his
foot slipped, he slid into the cleft, and found a hand at his
throat. The hand was relaxed, and the grip changed to his
shoulder, while a small covered lantern was flashed in his
face.</p>

<p>Shaken and startled, he saw one of the gipsies standing above
him, a man with a thin wolfish face and burning eyes. Peter's
youth and the sight of the gown on his arm apparently convinced
the man that here was no danger. He grunted, and picked up what
seemed to be a book which had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>"You are far from home, clerk," the voice said. "What do you
at this hour prowling in Stowood? You are not of the Children of
the Moon."</p>

<p>The Egyptians bore an ill name for secret robbery and murder,
and Peter's heart had pounded on his side when he felt the clutch
at his throat. But this man whom he could only see dimly, a grey
ghost flecked with firelight, seemed no marauder. His voice was
not the Egyptian whine, and his words were not the Egyptian
jargon. In spite of his rags he had a certain air of breeding and
authority. The other gipsies were busy with their cooking, and
the women were suckling their babes, but this man seemed to be
engaged with papers and he had the lantern to light him. Peter
realised that the gaze fixed on him was devouring and searching,
but not hostile.</p>

<p>"A clerk," said the man. "One of the blind eyes and dumb
mouths that have Oxford for their stepmother. I have forgot what
Oxford is like. Do you still plough the barren fields of the
Trivium and the Quadrivium? Do you yet mumble the leavings of
Aristotle? Are your major gods Priscian and Cato and Alexander of
Villa Dei? Is the hand that leads you up Parnassus that of old
John Leland? <i>Ut rosa flos florum sic Leland
grammaticorum</i>--it is so long since I heard it I have lost the
jingle. Or perhaps you are for the new masters, for I hear that
to-day in Oxford the Trojans are few and the Grecians many?"</p>

<p>"Troy has fallen," said Peter, amazed to hear such speech from
a gipsy's tongue.</p>

<p>"And her folk are scattered. They have put Duns and Aquinas in
Bocardo. They tell me that the great vellum leaves of the
Sentences flap in the wind about the college courts, and that
country louts gather them to make flappers to keep the deer
within the pales."</p>

<p>"What know you of Oxford and her ways?" the stupefied Peter
demanded.</p>

<p>"This much," said the man fiercely, "that her ways are not the
paths of truth, and that her fruits, old or new, are but husks to
be flung to swine. I tell you, clerk, there is only one new
learning, and that is the ancientest. It is here," and he held up
his book, "and it is old and yet ever young. For it is the wisdom
not of man but of God."</p>

<p>"Show it me," said Peter, but the man put it behind his
back.</p>

<p>"Not yet, clerk. England is not yet ripe for it, but the hour
draws near."</p>

<p>"Who are you that speak in riddles?"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Under the blanket of the dark all men are
alike and all are nameless. Let me view your countenance that I
may know it when I meet it again."</p>

<p>He held up the lantern, and the light also revealed his own
face. It was that of a man in early middle life, very lean and
haggard, with a long nose broken in the middle, and eyes that
seemed to burn in a fever. But the brow was broad and fine, and
the mouth was gentle.</p>

<p>"An honest face," he said. "You were no churl's get, young
clerk. . . . Now get you hence to your prayers, and leave me to
mine."</p>

<p>During this short dialogue the other gipsies had taken no
notice of Peter. He felt the thrust of the man's hand, and in a
moment he was out of the hollow and the firelight and back in the
midnight dusk of the woods.</p>

<p>He ran now, for his head was in a whirl. The magpie was a wise
bird, for that night he was indeed seeing portents. He had
observed one kind of authority mounted and jingling on the
highway, and now he had witnessed another kenneling with the
gipsies. The world was strange and very wide. It was time for him
to find his sanctuary, where he could adjust these new
experiences and think his own thoughts.</p>

<p>The place was his very own, for he had unearthed it after it
had been lost for centuries. In a charter in Oseney he had read
how the King of Wessex had given to the Bishop of Winchester a
piece of land by Cherwell side, which ran from a certain brook
"along the green valley by the two little hills and past the
Painted Floor," till it reached a certain thorn patch and a
certain spring. The words had fired his fancy. Once the Romans
had strode over these hills, the ruins of their massive
causewayed highroads ran through marsh and forest, they had set
their houses with vines and reaped their harvests where now only
wild beasts rustled. To one like Peter, most of whose waking
thoughts dwelt on Greece and Italy, the notion of such
predecessors among his familiar fields seemed to link his wildest
dreams to the solid world of fact. That Painted Floor must be
found, for it could only be a fragment of Roman work; there was
such a floor in the midget church of Widford on Windrush, a mile
or two from the home of his childhood. He knew the green valley
and the little hills of the charter; they lay east from Wood
Eaton, between the demesne of that manor and the ridge of
Stowood. The Romans had been there beyond doubt, for not long
since a ditcher in that very place had turned up a pot of gold
coins with Emperors' heads on them--some were now at Oseney among
the Abbey's treasures.</p>

<p>So Peter had spent the dry March days nosing like a fox in the
shallow glade which dropped from the high slopes to the Wood
Eaton meads. The Painted Floor was not among the run-rigs of
beans and oats and barley, nor in the trodden grass of the common
pastureland; it must be nearer the hills, among the rough meadows
where the brook had its source, or in the patches of oaken scrub
which were the advance pickets of the forest. . . . He found
it--found it one April day in a coppice of ash and thorn, guided
to it by a sudden flatness in ground which nature had clearly
made hummocky. It was a floor indeed, carpeted with fine turf and
painted only with primroses and windflowers. Peter's nails clawed
up the turf and came on tiles, and in an hour he had cleared a
yard or two and revealed what even in the dusk of the trees
showed brighter colours than earth and stone.</p>

<p>Peter borrowed an axe and a mattock from an Elsfield forester,
and, with the tools hidden in his gown, journeyed to the spinney
every hour of holiday. In places seeds had found lodgment among
the tiles, and had grown to trees, the roots of which split the
mosaic. In one part a badger had made his earth and powdered a
yard or two into dust. But when Peter had cut down encroaching
saplings and had stripped off the layers of turf, there lay
revealed a hundred square yards of tesselated pavement. Perhaps
since Roman days the place had been used as a sheep fold, for
there were signs of a later circumscribing wall, but once beyond
doubt it had been the floor of a Roman's dwelling. . . . Peter
fetched water from the spring among the bracken, and washed off
the dirt of centuries. Bit by bit he unveiled a picture. In the
centre, in the midst of an intricate design of grape leaves, sat
a figure of some goddess--Ceres perhaps or Proserpina. At each
corner were great plaques which presently revealed themselves as
the Four Seasons--Spring with Pan's pipes, Summer with a lap of
flowers, Autumn lifting aloft a cornucopia, and Winter a fur-clad
hunter holding a rabbit. And all between was a delicate maze of
convolutions so that the central goddess seemed to float upon
clouds. It was simple rustic work, for the greys were the
limestone rock, and the yellows and browns a neighbouring
sandstone, and the blue slate or glass, and the reds coarse
earthenware; but the design had a beauty which to Peter was a
revelation. He felt it akin to the grave music with which sundry
Roman poets had ravished his soul.</p>

<p>The place was forest land, he knew, and therefore belonged to
the King, though it was very near the Wood Eaton clearing and Sir
Ralph Bonamy's ground. But it was his own by the oldest and
strongest tenure, effective occupation. No one but himself knew
of this marvel. He concealed his movements going and coming as if
his purpose had been crime. The Wood Eaton churls were not likely
to drag their heavy feet to a place where there were neither
tasks to be wrought at nor coneys to be snared, and the foresters
would neglect a trivial spinney which offered no harbourage to
deer. Only Peter had business there. He would lie in the covert
in a hot noon, watching the sun make a chequer of green and gold,
till he fell asleep, and awoke, startled, to see what for a
moment he thought was the shimmer of a woman's gown and to hear
the call of an elfin flageolet. But it was only fancy. The Floor
was dim with dusk, and the wood was silent but for homing
birds.</p>

<p>To-night he crossed the brackeny meadow and came to the
coppice with a sudden wild expectation. The seventh magpie! There
had been marvels many that day, but a seventh magpie must portend
still more. The spring bubbled noisily among its greenery; he had
never heard it so loud. He lay prone and drank a great draught of
the icy water, so cold that it sent little pains running behind
his eyes. Then he entered the coppice.</p>

<p>It had been his custom to treat it as a sacred place and to
enter with reverent feet and head uncovered. Nor did he enter it
direct. He would fetch a circuit and come in from the top to his
own perch above the Floor, like a seat in one of the tiers of an
amphitheatre looking down on the arena. So he climbed the slope
to where half a dozen great oaks hung like sentinels above the
coppice, and found his way downhill through the scrub of hazels
and briers. The moon was already well up in the heavens, and the
turf was white as with frost, but inside the wood it was dark
till he reached the edge of the Floor. There, since the taller
trees fell back from it, light was permitted to enter from the
sky.</p>

<p>Peter parted the bushes, found a seat of moss between two
boulders, and looked down from the height of perhaps twenty feet
upon the moon-silvered stage.</p>

<p>The Floor had a sheen on it, so that the colours were lost in
a glimmer of silver. The colours, but not the design. The
enthroned Ceres in the heart of it seemed like a reflection of a
great statue in a deep clear pool. Bits of the corner plaques
could be seen too--the swung rabbit in Winter's hand, half of
Autumn's cornucopia, more than half of Summer's lapful of
flowers.</p>

<p>The place was very quiet. It had the scent of all woodland
places in high summer--mosses, lush foliage, moist earth which
has had its odours drawn out by a strong sun. There was also a
faint sweetness of cut hay from the distant Wood Eaton fields,
and something aromatic and dry, which was the savour of stone and
tile and ancient crumbling mortar. There seemed to be no life in
the thicket, though a few minutes before the world had rustled
with the small noises of insect and bird. At that hour there
should have been sleeping doves in the boughs, and hunting owls,
and rasping nightjars looking for ewes and she-goats to milk. Or
the furtive twist of a stoat, or the pad of a homing badger. But
there were none of these things, no sound even of a wandering
vapour; only the moonlight, the scents, and the expectant
silence.</p>

<p>But surely there was movement, though it was soundless. Peter,
entranced with the magic of the place and hour, saw in the steady
radiance of the moon shadows slip across the Floor. It almost
seemed as if Ceres had lifted her hands from their eternal
entwinement. The flowers had shifted in Summer's lap, Spring had
fingered her pipe. . . .</p>

<p>Peter crossed himself with a shaking finger and began a
prayer. Suddenly company had come out of the night. He realised
that he was not alone.</p>

<p>Something was moving on the Painted Floor, something which so
blended with the moonlight that its presence could be known only
when it obscured the pattern. . . . From where he sat, Peter
looked beyond the little amphitheatre to a gap in the encircling
coppice, a gap through which could be seen the descending glade
and a segment of far hills. The moonlight on the Floor, being
framed in trees, was an intenser glow than the paler landscape
beyond. Suddenly against this pallor a figure was
silhouetted--the figure of a girl.</p>

<p>Peter tried to pray. He tried to say a prayer to the Mother of
God which was his favourite invocation in emergencies. It began,
<i>Imperatrix supernorum, Superatrix infernorum,</i> but he did
not get as far as <i>superatrix.</i> For he found that he had not
the need to pray. His fear had been only momentary. His heart was
beating fast, but not with terror. The sight before him was less
an invocation to prayer than an answer to it. Into his own secret
sanctuary had come the appropriate goddess.</p>

<p>It was a mortal who danced below him--of that he had instant
and complete assurance. The misty back world of Peter's mind, for
all his schooling, held a motley of queer folk, nymphs, fays,
witch-wives, who had their being on the edge of credence. But
this was not of that kind. It was a mortal with blood in her
veins. . . . She had flung up her arms, when she showed in the
gap, in a very rapture of youth. . . . He had seen her head
clear--eyes over which the eyelids drooped, a smiling mouth, a
delicate face on a slim neck. . . . Her garments were now drawn
tight round her, and now floated wide like the robes of a fleeing
nymph on a Greek gem. They seemed to be white, but all of her was
white in the moon. Her hair was silvered and frosted, but it
might be gold or ebony by day. Slim and blanched, she flitted and
spun like a leaf or a blown petal, but every line of her, every
movement, spoke of youth and a rich, throbbing, exultant
life.</p>

<p>The pattern of her dance seemed to be determined by the
pictures under her feet. Sometimes she tripped down the
convolutions and whorls till the eyes dazzled. At the corner
plaques she fitted her movements to their design--wild in Spring,
languorous in Summer, in Autumn a bacchanal, in Winter a tempest.
Before the throned Ceres she became a hierophant, and her dance a
ritual. Once she sank to the ground, and it seemed that her lips
rested on the goddess's face.</p>

<p>Never before had Peter stared at a woman and drunk in the
glory of her youth and grace. He had seen very few, and had
usually passed them with averted eyes. They were the devil's
temptation to the devout, and a notorious disturbance to the
studious. But this woman had come into his sanctuary and made
free with it as of right. He could not deny that right, and,
since the sanctuary was his, the two were irrevocably linked
together. They were worshippers at the same secret shrine. . . .
He looked at her more calmly now. He saw the pride and nimbleness
of motion, the marvellous grace of body, the curves of the cheek
as the head was tilted backwards. It was a face stamped indelibly
on his memory, though under the drooped eyelids he could not see
the eyes.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when he reconstructed the scene, Peter held that
he fell into a kind of waking dream, from which he awoke with a
start to realise that the dance was ended and the Floor empty.
The moon had shifted its position in the sky, and half the Floor
was in shadow. There was still no fear in his mind and no regret.
The nymph had gone, but she would return. She must return, as he
must, to this place which had laid its spell upon both. . . . He
felt very drowsy, so he found a bigger patch of moss, made a
pillow of his gown, and went to sleep in that warm green dusk
which is made for dreams.</p>

<p>But he was too young and too healthily tired to dream. He
woke, as was his habit, at sunrise, sniffed the morning, and
turned round to sleep for another hour. Then he rose, when the
trees were still casting long shadows on the meadow and the
Painted Floor was dim with dew, and took the road towards Wood
Eaton and its little river. He would not go back to Oxford yet
awhile, he decided, but would seek his breakfast at Oseney, which
was without the gates. He came to the Cherwell at a narrow place
overhung with willows; there he stripped, bundled his clothes
inside his gown, and tossed the whole to the farther bank. Then
he dived deep into the green waters, and thereafter dried himself
by cantering like a colt among the flags and meadowsweet. The
bath had sharpened both his energy and his hunger, so that he
passed at a trot the Wood Eaton granges and crossed the
Campsfield moor, where the shepherds and cowherds were
marshalling their charges for the day. Presently he was looking
into a valley filled with trees and towers, with, on the right,
below a woody hill, the spire of a great church set among
glistening streams.</p>

<h1><a name="c02">CHAPTER II</a></h1>

<h1>IN WHICH PETER IS INTRODUCED TO FORTUNE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter did not slacken pace till he descended from the uplands
and crossed the highway which joined Oxford and Woodstock, a
frequented road, for by it the staplers sent their pack-trains to
load their wool in the river barges. There was a great green
plain on his right hand, grazed upon by a multitude of geese, and
already country folk with baskets of market stuff were on their
way to the north gate. He turned down a lane by Gloucester Hall,
where he looked over a close of pippins to the Rewley fishponds,
and passed the little stone quays at Hythe bridge, where men were
unloading sweet-smelling packages from a lumpish green boat. In
the huts of Fisher Row strange folk, dingy as waterweeds, were
getting ready their cobles and fishing-gear against the next
fast-day. Peter crossed the main stream at Bookbinders bridge,
and came on a broad paved path which ran to what seemed a second
city. Walls, towers, pinnacles rose in a dizzier medley than
those of Oxford, which he had seen five minutes before beyond the
north gate. In especial one tall campanile soared as the stem of
a pine soars from a wilderness of bracken, white and gleaming
among the soberer tints of roof and buttress.</p>

<p>Suddenly from it there fell a gush of lovely sound, the
morning canticle of the noblest peal of bells in the land. Peter
stopped to listen, motionless with delight. In the diamond air of
dawn the bells seemed to speak with the tongues of angels,
praising God for His world, with the same notes that birds used
in the thickets or the winds on the waters. As the peal slowed
and ebbed to its close, one bell lingered, more deep and full
than the rest, as if its rapture would not be stayed. Peter knew
it for Thomas of Oseney, which had no equal in England--as great
as Edward of Westminster or Dunstan of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The bells told him the hour. Prime was long past, and now the
Chapter was over. There would be no food for four mortal hours
unless he could make favour in the kitchen. He hurried through
Little Gate and past the almshouses to Great Gate, with its
cluster of morning beggars. It was dark under the portals, so
dark that the janitor did not at first recognise him, and caught
him roughly by the cloak till his face was revealed. Beyond was
the wide expanse of Great Court, one half of it in shadow, one
half a pool of light. On three sides, north, east and west, lay
the cloisters, roofed with Shotover oak, and faced with the
carved work of old Elias of Burford. Peter knew every inch of
them, for, far more than his cell in St George's College in the
Castle, the Oseney cloisters were his home. There on the west
side was his schoolroom, where he instructed the novices; there
on the north was the scriptorium, where lodged the Abbey's
somewhat antiquated library; there on the south, beside the
kitchen, was the Abbey's summer parlour, and the slype which led
to the graveyard, the gardens and the river. This last was
Peter's favourite corner, for in the morning hours it had the
bustle of a market-place. On its stone seats sat those who waited
on business with the Abbot, and foreign merchants using Oseney as
a consulate, and brethren who could snatch a half-hour of
leisure. It was a window from which the Abbey looked out into the
world.</p>

<p>This morning there was a great peace in all the cloisters. Two
old canons were taking the sun, and a half-dozen children stood
in a ring repeating what might have been equally a game or a
lesson. To Peter's chagrin there was no comfort in the kitchen.
The morning meal in the fratry was still hours distant, and the
under-kitchener, who was his friend, had gone to the Abbot's
lodging, busied about an early collation for the Abbot's guests.
To forget his hunger Peter turned into Little Court, whence by
way of the infirmary he could reach the back parts of the
Abbey.</p>

<p>He found himself presently in a strange place, a place of
lanes and closes, cot-houses and barns, from which came the clang
of hammers and the buzzing of wheels. It was a burgh of itself,
that part of the Abbey precincts which was known as Oseney-town,
where dwelt the artificers. Here during the centuries there had
grown up a multitude of crafts--tanners who prepared the Cotswold
skins; bookbinders who clad in pigskin and vellum the archives of
abbey and college; illuminators who decked the written word with
gold and vermilion; wax-chandlers who made the lights for the
holy places; shoemakers and workers in all kinds of leather and
fine metals. Here were the millers who ground the corn from the
Abbey farms, and carpenters and smiths and fullers and weavers of
wicker-work. From every doorway came the sound of busy folk, and
as an undertone the rhythmic beat of mill-wheels and the babble
of little chinking rivulets. From this hive of industry there
rose, too, a dozen smells, pleasant smells which told of
wholesome human life--the bitter reek of the tan-pits, the
freshness of new leather, the comfortable odour of ground corn
which tormented Peter's emptiness. And everywhere the clean scent
of running water.</p>

<p>But Peter did not linger amid the busyness of Oseney-town. A
gate between two dovecotes, where homing pigeons made a noisy
cloud, led him across a bridge to the Abbey gardens. First came
orchards of apples, pears and plums, quinces and apricots, and a
close of plainer fruits, filberts, walnuts, almonds, and the
cornels from which sweet drinks were made. There were fig-trees
on the west walls, and a vineyard whose small grapes were used
for a rough wine, but mostly for sweet pasties. Beyond lay the
herb-garden, where Brother Placidus was now pottering. He had
beds of every herb that healed the body and some which hurt, for
he had mandrakes which must be torn up only by a black dog in the
dark of the moon. There were flowers, too, in their July glory,
admitted shamefacedly, since they were idle and fruitless things,
and served only to make nosegays for the children of the
craftsmen. Then came more meadows, some already shorn, some heavy
with hay, and more dovecotes and orchards. Through all of these
meandered runnels, which spouted sometimes over tiny lashers.
Last came the fish-ponds, oblongs of clear green water, where in
the depths great carp and bream and tench could be seen,
motionless but for an occasional flicker of their tails. Beyond
them, after a banked walk among willows, lay a shining loop of
river, and across the farther meadows the smoke of Hinksey
village and the hills of Cumnor, already dim with the haze which
promised another day of breathless summer.</p>

<p>Peter crossed the meadow called Nymph's Hay, the fodder from
which was reserved for the Abbot's stalls, and entered the little
orchard named Columbine, which was all of apple trees. He chose
the place because it had an open view, on one side to Cumnor and
Wytham, on the other to the soaring tower of Oseney Great Church,
with the hump of Oxford Castle and the spire of St Mary the
Virgin beyond it. He was hungry and had long to wait before he
breakfasted, but that was nothing new to Peter. It was his soul
not his belly that troubled him. The high spirits of yesterday,
the vigour of that very morning, had gone, and he was in a mood
of profound disquiet. He flung himself among the long cool
grasses, and sniffed the scent of earth; he lay on his back and
watched pigeons and finches crossing the space of blue between
the trees; and then he shut his eyes, for his trouble was within,
in his heart.</p>

<p>It had been coming on for a long time, this malady of the
mind. There were days like yesterday when youth and sunshine and
holiday gave him the unthinking happiness of childhood. Sometimes
for as much as a week he would be at peace, busy with his books,
his small duties at the Abbey, and the pleasant ritual of food
and sleep. And then a film seemed to dim his outlook, and all
that had been coloured grew drab, and what had seemed a wide
horizon narrowed to prison walls.</p>

<p>He raised his head and looked at the lift of the Abbey towers
beyond the apple trees. Sometimes he thought the sight the
noblest on earth, not to be bettered surely by Rome or Jerusalem.
But now he saw it only as a jumble of grey stone, and under that
jumble he knew that there were weedy courtyards, and seventeen
ageing canons stumbling aimlessly through their days of prayer,
and an Abbot on whose brow sat the cares of the world rather than
the peace of God, and shrill-voiced impudent novices, and pedlars
who made the cloisters like St Giles's Fair--a shell once full of
fruit, but empty now but for weevils and a few dry and rotting
shreds. . . . A medley of singing rivulets filled the place,
freshening the orchards and meadows, sending strong leats to wash
away filth, edging the walks, turning mill-wheels, making
everywhere pools and founts and cisterns. In a happier hour he
had told himself that Oseney was a northern Venice, a queen of
waters; now in his distemper it seemed only a mouldering relic
among sewers.</p>

<p>He wanted life and power and pride; not in a sinful cause, but
for noble purposes--this he told himself hastily to still a
doubting conscience. He wanted to tear the heart out of learning,
which was to him the mother of power. He wanted to look the world
in the face, to cast a spell over men and make them follow him.
In all innocency he hungered for pomp and colour, trumpet notes,
quick music, the stir of the heart. . . . And he was only a poor
scholar of St George's College in the Castle, entitled to little
more than lodging and a commons of bread and ale; a pensioner of
Oseney under an ancient corrody of the keepers of Wychwood
Forest; a teacher of noisy infants and dull hobbledehoys; a
fumbler at the doors of knowledge when he should be striding its
halls; a clerk in a shabby gown, whom no woman cast a second
glance at and proud men thrust from the causeway; a cypher, a
nobody, neither lay nor cleric, gentle nor simple, man nor maid.
. . . He remembered the face of the traveller on the weary roan
whom the night before he had seen ride in the gloaming into
Stowood, and at the memory of his mastery Peter turned on his
side and groaned.</p>

<p>The queer gipsy man, who spoke like a clerk, had said he was
no churl's get. But he had been wrong. Peter's mind flew back to
what he remembered of his youth. His only recollection was of the
forester's cottage on the edge of Wychwood, looking down upon
Windrush. Mother Sweetbread, the forester's wife, was all of a
mother he had ever known, and the forester all of a father. He
was not their child, but more distant kin--his father, he was
told, had been a soldier slain in the wars. . . . His early life
had been that of other country children--long summer days in wood
and meadow, and winters snug at the back of the fire. But there
had been sudden odd gleams athwart it. He remembered once being
hurried into the deeps of Wychwood by Mother Sweetbread, where he
lived for several days in a cold cleft by a stream, and somehow
that hasty journey was associated in his mind with trampling
horses and a tall man with a scar on his brow. . . . Then there
was Brother Tobias, who superintended his schooling. Tobias was
an Oseney canon, whose face, as long as Peter remembered it, had
been wrinkled like a walnut. Tobias had taught him his letters,
and arranged for him to attend the Witney school, where he
boarded with the parson. Tobias had spoken to him of wonderful
things and opened up new worlds and set him on the scholar's
path. It was Tobias who had got him an entrance to St George's
College, and had been his guide and benefactor when the Wychwood
corrody placed him on the Oseney foundation. To Tobias he had
gone in every trouble save his present discontent. That he could
not carry to him, for Tobias would declare that it was sin.
Tobias hoped that he would presently take up the religious life:
it was for such a purpose that he had brought him from the
Windrush cottage.</p>

<p>Peter had been now three years in Oxford, and in those three
years he had strayed far from the Witney school and the precepts
of Tobias. He had found the place humming with a strange jargon
and fevered with the beginnings of a new life. There was Greek to
be had in the new lectures at Corpus Christi College, and Greek
was not a fresh subject to be added to the Trivium or Quadrivium,
but a kind of magic which altered all the rest of man's
knowledge. It made him contemptuous of much that his betters
still held venerable, and critical even of the ways of God. . . .
But there was more astir in Oxford than Greek. The sons of great
men were coming now to college, instead of going like their
fathers to a nobleman's household or the King's Court, and they
were bringing the wind of politics into its sheltered groves. All
was in a flux in Church and State. Great things were happening,
greater still were promised; it was hard to keep the mind on
study when every post from London set the streets and taverns in
a babble.</p>

<p>It was a moment when barriers seemed to be cracking, and there
were wild chances for youth. But in such chances Peter had no
share. The most that lay before him was the narrow life of the
religious, regular monk or secular priest, or a life not less
narrow spent in the outer courts of learning as a copier of
scripts and a schoolmaster to youth. He was a peasant and a son
of peasants, and there was no place for him in the glittering
world. . . . Once the Church might have helped him to a pinnacle,
as it had helped the great Cardinal of York, now dead. But the
Church was crumbling; soon it would be no more than an appanage
to the King's palace, and its affairs would be guided by
high-handed oppressive folk such as he had watched last night
jingling through Stowood.</p>

<p>Again Peter raised his head, and this time his eye was held by
the soaring tower of the great church. It was of Taynton stone,
and whiter than the fabric; a sudden brightness seemed to fall on
it and make it a shaft of alabaster with a light behind it. . . .
He saw again Oseney as he had first seen it, a mystic city filled
with all the wisdom of God and man. Especially he remembered how
the tower had seemed to him to leap into the skies and marry
earth and heaven. Something of the old mood returned to him.
Sinner that he was, he had the Faith to hold him up, the Faith
for whose mysteries he had once hungered and trembled. The world
might go withershins, but here was a cornerstone which could not
be removed, an anvil which had worn out many hammers. To remember
that he was a clerk gave him a second of pride, almost of
defiance, for the Church and her clerks had many foes. He was not
obscure so long as he was a member of that celestial brotherhood,
nor humble when he had a title to the pride of Heaven. . . . He
gazed again at the shining tower, and a fount of affection welled
in his dry heart. At that moment Thomas, the great bell, boomed
the hour for High Mass.</p>

<p>Peter hurried through the orchard closes and over the little
bridges and through the purlieus of Oseney-town. The place smelt
less pleasingly than it had an hour ago, and, with the dazzle of
dawn out of his eyes, he could see the squalor of much of it--the
dirt and offal in the runnels, a sluttish woman at a door,
crumbling styes and byres, a bridge mended with a broken
cart-wheel, a scum of grease filming an eddy in a stream. He ran
past the infirmary and across Little Court, for Thomas had had a
peremptory note in his voice, and he did not slacken pace till he
was in the cloisters of Great Court, and joined a little convoy
of canons proceeding to the west door of the church. . . . Then
suddenly he was in a hollow like the inside of a mountain, a
hollow lit with twinkling lights and strange jewelled belts of
sun, thick with incense smoke, and tremulous with the first notes
of the great organ.</p>

<p>The growing poverty of Oseney had not yet shown itself in its
mighty church. Peter, in his seat below the choir, felt himself
once again secure from the temptations of life and lapped in an
ancient peace. Nothing could stale for him the magic of this
hollow land whose light and colour and scents were not those of
the world. He followed the service mechanically from long
practice, but his thoughts were far away. Oseney kept up the old
fashion: no prick-song with its twists and tremors, but the
honest plain-song of their fathers. The solemn cadences dwelt in
the dim recesses above him like a night-wind among the clouds.
They soothed him, and yet quickened the life in him, so that his
fancies ranged in a happy medley. On the wall opposite him hung a
tapestry of some saint of the Thebaid, with Libyan lions dogging
his heels, and an aureoled angel offering him something in a cup.
In the background little yellow hills ran out to a blue river,
beyond which, very far away, lay a city with spires, and a sea
with two ships. The sun coming in through the rose window in the
south transept made the phylactery which the angel bore glow like
a topaz, and gilded the hermit's bald head, while it turned the
ciborium below into shining gold. . . . Slowly Peter's mind
passed from a happy vacuity to making tales about the scene
depicted in the tapestry, and, as his fancy ranged, the peace
which the dim light and the grave harmonies had given him began
to shiver like mist and disappear. <i>Adoramus te
Christe</i>--sang the pure voices of the choristers--<i>Jesu fili
Dei vivi</i>--but Peter's thoughts were not on God. That tapestry
had become a window through which he looked again upon the
secular world which tormented him.</p>

<p>At the benediction he made straight for the fratry, for his
hunger was now grievous. At the laver in the cloister he bathed
his face, and washed hands which were stained with the soil and
moss of the orchard. The fratry was on the south side of Great
Court, to be reached by a broad stairway, for all the
ground-floor was occupied by cellars and store-rooms. It was too
large by far for the present community, for the officers, canons,
novices and clerks attached made only a cluster at one end of the
great hall. The da&iuml;s was empty, since Abbot Burton was
entertaining guests in his own lodgings. The precentor gabbled a
grace, and the little company began their meal on the viands
already on the table, for there were no hot dishes when fast was
broken in summer-time. The food was plentiful and good--rye bread
in abundance, and for each a commons of the fine white Oxford
loaves called "blanchpayn," the Abbey's own ale, the Abbey's own
cheese and butter, smoked London herrings, and dishes of fresh
lettuces of Brother Placidus's growing. Peter's place was at the
lower end, and he ate hungrily, having no ear for the novice, who
in a stone pulpit read aloud from St Jerome. The black dog was on
his back again. He was a poor clerk in a poor place,
disconsidered even by the disconsidered. The homely smell of the
food, of the scrubbed floor and woodwork, of the coarse fabric of
his neighbours' clothes, filled him with a childish exasperation.
He looked at the grey heads around him. Was he to grow old like
them in this place of shadows?</p>

<p>A hand was laid on his shoulder as he descended the staircase
into the July sunlight, and he found Brother Tobias beside him.
Brother Tobias was a little lame, and leaned heavily on his arm
while he spoke in his placid cooing way in his ear. Brother
Tobias had a very small face, red and rosy and wrinkled like a
walnut, and a very long neck, stringy as a hempen rope. From
earliest days he had been Peter's guardian, patron, father in
God, or whatever title covers the complete oversight of interests
in time and eternity. He had blue eyes a little dim from study,
for he was Oseney's chief scholar and accounted a learned Thomist
as well as a noted Grecian, but those same eyes saw much that
others missed, and at moments they could gleam with a secular
fire. For Tobias had not always been a churchman; there were
tales of a youth spent in camps and courts, for he was come of
high stock from Severn side.</p>

<p>His dragging arm led Peter to the slype beside the summer
parlour. On the stone seats some of the brethren, who had already
eaten, were basking in the sun. Two men in green, clothiers from
the Stour, were engaged in argument with the hosteller about
certain coverlets supplied to the hostel beds. . . . Brother
Placidus, a lean old man with a skin the colour of loam, was
upbraiding Brother Josephus, because the latter, who was skilled
in the work of illumination, had plucked as a model the leaf of a
certain rare plant, which the former alleged to have been thereby
destroyed. The leaf in question was now past the use for which
Brother Josephus had designed it, having been rolled into a
pellet in Brother Placidus's angry hands. . . . A pedlar of wild
strawberries had plumped his baskets on the flags and was
extolling the merits of fruit picked that morning in the
Besselsleigh woods. . . . Two brethren were imperilling their
digestions by a theological argument as to whether our Lord,
combining a divine and a human nature, was to be described as
<i>conflatus</i> or <i>commixtus.</i> A third joining in, urged
that the proper word was <i>unitus,</i> or perhaps
<i>geminatus,</i> and quoted a sentence of St Augustine. . . . A
group of younger canons were discussing the guests whom the Abbot
was then entertaining. One was Sir Ralph Bonamy of Wood Eaton--he
was a familiar figure; but the other, the old man with the small
white beard and the quick anxious eyes? Doubtless a confrater, or
lay member of the Abbey, come to consult on Oseney business. One
claimed to know the face as that of a lord in the west country
who was very close to the King's ear. . . . The reeve from the
Abbey's lands at Kidlington was engaged with the sub-cellarer on
an intricate computation of the number of beeves to be fattened
for the Abingdon market. . . . Peter, who could not choose but
hear fragments of the tattle, felt an overpowering weariness of
soul.</p>

<p>Brother Tobias, stretching his old legs in the sun's warmth,
looked curiously at his friend, whose gown had slipped from his
shoulders, and who stood before him very comely in his young
grace, but with something listless and dejected in his air.</p>

<p>"I missed you at supper last night, son Peter," he said. "Were
you in the woods, maybe? You have become more of a forester these
days than a clerk. In this summer of God no doubt the woods are
the best school. Would that my limbs were less ancient and I
could go with you, but where I must jog on a mule you can stride
like a hunter. When saw you Mother Sweetbread last?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday seven days."</p>

<p>"She was in health?"</p>

<p>"In the health which her age permits."</p>

<p>"Ay. That good wife grows old like me. Age needs cherishing,
and she is all the kin you have. Next week, if the Lord spare me,
we will go together upstream and taste the Windrush trout and the
Forest strawberries. But before that we must speak together of
some difficult matters. You are a man now, with your twenty-first
year behind you. It is time to consult about the future."</p>

<p>"That is what I desire," said Peter moodily.</p>

<p>"Let it be this evening before compline." He looked up at the
boy's shapeliness, the clean limbs, the narrow loins, the breadth
of shoulder, at the face dark with weather, the straight brows,
the noble lines of head and jaw, the candid grey-blue eyes at
present sullen and puzzled, the crisp brown hair, for Peter had
never been tonsured. All this Brother Tobias gazed at, and then
he sighed, before he rose to limp back to his studies. He
wondered whether such youth would submit readily to the
dedication which religion demanded. "I must require of him some
special discipline," he thought.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter finished his duties in the novices' school by an hour
after noon. He visited his attic in St George's College in the
Castle. It was very hot, and, since the window opened to the
south, the little room was like an oven. He looked at his
unslept-in bed, with its mean bedclothes, his shelf of papers
weighted by a book or two, the three-legged stool and the rickety
table which were all the furniture, and a pair of blue flies
buzzing at a broken pane, and the sight did not increase his
cheerfulness. Poverty lay like dust over everything. He had meant
to give the afternoon to his own studies, to that translation of
a book of Plato into Ciceronian Latin, at which, with a fellow of
Corpus Christi College, he had been for some months at work. But
he found it impossible. On such a day and in such a mood he would
go mad in that stuffy cell. He would go to the library of Merton
College, where he had permission to read, and look up certain
passages in Diogenes Laertius till dinner-time.</p>

<p>It had become a day of blistering heat. The last summer had
been a succession of fogs and deluges, so that the hay rotted in
the mead and the beans in the field. But this year, though there
had been many comforting rains, there had also been weeks of
steady heat, when the sun rose in a haze, glared at noontide from
a cloudless sky, and set again in amethyst and opal. Peter
entered the city by the west gate, and by way of Friars' Street
came into St Aldate's opposite the gate of what had once been
Cardinal College. It was still unfinished, a barrack of gaunt
masonry, noble only in its size, with beyond the raw gables and
the poles of the scaffolding the lovely grey spire of St
Frideswide's Church. Peter on his way to Merton passed through
the new main quadrangle, which was as yet more like a quarry than
a dwelling for men. The older work was of hard Burford stone, but
much of the finishing, to save time and cost, was in the soft
stone of Headington, and the masons who wrought on it filled the
air with a fine dust and made the place in the sultry afternoon
like a desert in a sandstorm. On the older plinths and buttresses
Peter read the great Cardinal's arms, and he wished his soul well
wherever it might be. Wolsey had loved grandeur and pomp, and had
made all men bow to him. Also he had loved sound learning, and,
had his dreams been realised, the Greek of Corpus would have been
to the Greek of Cardinal as a cup of water to a flood.</p>

<p>Merton Street gave him shade, where the town houses of the
gentry of the shire beetled over the narrow pathway. Beyond he
saw bare ground up to the city wall; that had once been a
populous quarter of the city, but it had been untenanted since
the Black Death a hundred years before. . . . The great Cardinal
dwelt in his mind, not as a warning against pride, but as an
encouragement to the humble. Though tragedy had been the end of
him, he had wrested rich prizes from life. Dukes had held the
ewer while he washed, and earls had tied the strings of his
shoes. His palaces at Hampton and Tittenhanger and the More had
been as noble as the King's. He had travelled about with three
hundred servants, and he, the flesher's son, had sat as equal at
the council-board with the Emperor and the King of France.
Peter's fancy fired at the thought, and in a dream he climbed the
library steps with long strides and found his accustomed
corner.</p>

<p>But the mood did not last. . . . Wolsey had been Wolsey, and
he was Peter Pentecost, without a friend save Brother Tobias and
the Oseney canons, and with no means to raise himself from his
humility. His obscurity was too deep for any good fortune to
disinter him. Diogenes Laertius that day was not profitably
studied, for Peter sat on the oak settle with his eye on the page
and his mind far away. . . . He thought of his happy careless
childhood with irritation. Born a peasant in a peasant's hut, not
very clear even about his own humble kin, learning had opened
windows for him and given him a prospect beyond his station. But
learning having made the promise could not give him fulfilment.
The Church offered no career. It was crumbling; as Tobias said,
the gates of Hell were prevailing against it. A churchman met
hard glances nowadays wherever he went; and, worse, he found the
doors of power barred to him. There was a new world coming to
birth, and it was a world which, instead of exalting Peter
Pentecost, must force him deeper down into the mire. . . . Mother
Sweetbread was growing old, and she was all the kin he knew. The
thought at the moment brought no kindness to his heart, for youth
has its hard patches. He felt something which was almost
resentment against the woman who had reared him for so narrow a
life. Yet in those days he had been happy. His memory of them was
of an infinite series of golden hours, green woods and clear
waters and gentle faces. Illusion, no doubt, but it was better
than the grim reality of to-day. . . .</p>

<p>And then his thoughts flew to the Painted Floor, and the
strange spectacle of the night before. Since his youth could not
be recovered, might he not win that clean and gracious world
which the classical poets had revealed to him, another and a
fairer youth, an eternal springtide of the spirit? But the harsh
present was too insistent, nor did he believe that he had the
makings of the true scholar. He could not consent to live only
with books and dreams, even if that life were free to him. He had
revelled in old poets because they had given him a sphere so
remote from squalid reality that he could indulge the fancy that
within it he was a master and not a slave. He had rejoiced in the
Painted Floor, because it was his own, and he was king there by
the strongest right of tenure. But did not the secret of both
affections lie in the fact that they made him what he could
dream, but could never attain to? . . .</p>

<p>He had a momentary thought of breaking all shackles and
seeking another course of life. He had been taught the use of
arms by the Wychwood foresters. Brother Tobias himself had seen
to it that he had some skill of the sword, a rare thing in a
clerk. His chest was deep and his limbs were tireless. What of
the big unclerkly world beyond Oseney gates and Oxford walls? . .
. The notion only crossed his mind to be dismissed. Learning,
even a little learning, had spoiled him for beginning life in the
ranks among bullies and cut-throats and fellows whose sole
possession was their sinews. It had made him fastidious. He
hungered, and yet could be dainty about any offered dish. . . .
Peter shut his book and dropped his head on his arms. He was
feeling the pressure of life which sets a man's nerves twitching
and confuses his brain, and which can be mastered only by
blinding the eyes and concentrating on a single duty, or--the
poet's way--by weaving tumultuous phenomena into the simplicities
of art. What were those words of Tobias which he was always using
of England?--"The blanket of the dark." The gipsy with the hot
eyes in Stowood had said the same. Peter had a sense of a great
cloud of darkness encumbering him, a cloak at once black and
stifling.</p>

<p>His restlessness drew him from the shadowed library and sent
him by way of Merton Lane into the bustle of High Street. It was
cooler now, but, since that narrow street ran east and west, the
sun's beams fell in a long slant and there was no shade. Peter,
filled with his own thoughts, and keeping close to the booths,
found himself so jostled that he was shaken into cognisance of
the world around him. . . . A cowman, leading a red bull by the
nose, was pulled off his legs and had a wordy brawl with a
mounted lackey wearing the Harcourt liveries. . . . For a moment
the street was cleared, while a veiled lady on a palfrey was
escorted by four running footmen and an armed steward. Great folk
from Ewelme, thought Peter, for the men had the Suffolk colours.
. . . He saw two friars cross the street and disappear within the
Wheatsheaf passage, moving furtively and fast. They were from a
Dominican house among the south marshes, a foundation long
decayed and now trembling to its fall. Dr John London, the Warden
of New College, emerged from the Bear inn, wiping his lips and
arguing loudly with a pale priest in a cassock. Dr John's red
face and vehement eye dominated the pavement, and the citizens
doffed their caps to him, while the friars quickened their pace
at the sight, for he was deep in Cromwell's confidence and
purposed to make himself a scourge for the religious houses under
the direction of the masterful chief whip of the Council. . .
.</p>

<p>There were plenty of threadbare scholars of Peter's own
complexion, and a sprinkling of a different kind of youth--ruddy
boys, richly doubleted and booted, and in defiance of statute
bearing arms--young sprigs of gentrice and nobility, to whom the
life of Oxford was that of a country house. The sight of them
made Peter shrink still farther into what shadow he could find. .
. . In a press at a corner he thought he caught a glimpse of the
lean face and the hot eyes of the gospeller of the night before.
And of one face he was certain. Down the causeway, as if he were
its squire, strode the tall horseman whom he had seen twenty
hours ago ride up the hill into Stowood. He had changed his
clothes, for gone were the plumeless bonnet and battered doublet:
now he was handsomely dressed in black and silver, with a jewel
in his cap, but the same long sword swung at his side. . . .
Opposite Haberdashers' Hall, which was on Oseney ground, there
was a loud cry to clear the way, and, a hundred yards off, he saw
the head of a mounted man bobbing above the throng. It was a post
from London, no less than the Vice-Chancellor's own private
courier, and, since he had many acquaintances, he was delayed by
people plucking at his stirrups and bridle and asking for news.
To avoid the crowd Peter stepped into an open door of the Ram
inn, and found a seat well back in the dusk.</p>

<p>It was a place which he sometimes frequented, when his weekly
three silver pennies permitted the indulgence. A drawer brought
him a pot of ale, and when he had taken the edge from his thirst
he looked round the room, which was bright in front where its low
windows and door admitted the sunlight from the street, but at
the back was dusky as a vault. A clerk sat on the settle next
him, and he saw without pleasure that it was that Jeremy Wellaby
of Corpus with whom he was at work on Plato.</p>

<p>There was a clamour at the door and loud cries on Master
Puncheon the vintner to bring forthwith a hogshead of ale to
quench the drought of an honest man. The Vice-Chancellor's
messenger had halted at the Ram door and was being treated by his
friends. Peter could not choose but catch echoes of the babble,
as the said friends discussed the news. The Pope's men rising . .
. Norfolk way . . . some say the Bishop leads 'em . . . nay, not
the Duke of Norfolk, who was the right hand of the King's grace .
. . Darcy maybe, and unnamed lords in the north . . . St Albans
had fallen to them . . . some said they were stopped at
Huntingdon. . . . Nay, nay, Master Giles had been clear that
there was no rising as yet, only the fear of one. . . .</p>

<p>The crowd surged on, but, like an ocean billow, it left some
flotsam behind it. Several figures had entered the taproom of the
Ram. One was already a little drunk, and had the look of a
scrivener's jackal, for there were ink stains over his large
splay hands. He sat near the door, spilling his ale as he drank
over a grimy doublet, and he seasoned his draught with complaints
to all within earshot.</p>

<p>"Ay, my masters," he hiccuped, "the King's grace has gotten
the Pope at last in his belly. Now that the big black Cardinal
crow is dead, the rookeries will be hewn down, and there will be
rook pie for every poor soul that seeks it. A better world, says
I. No more mortuaries and probates and a right to sin for every
lousy clerk. Dr John! Dr John London! More power to your stout
arm! They waxed fat and kicked fat, forsooth . . . three dishes
at a meal for the plain gentleman and only six for a great lord
of parliament, but nine on the board of him that was Cardinal of
York. . . . It is the day of recompense, my masters, and blessed
be the eyes which shall see it. . . ."</p>

<p>The man saw something in the street which plucked him from his
bench and sent him staggering into the open.</p>

<p>"It is the day of loose tongues," said a grave man, an Oxford
mercer who was dining handsomely off a roast duck and a cup of
sack. "The stocks and a clipped ear await that one. . . .
Doubtless it would be a pleasant world lacking mortuaries and
such-like, but what an honest man saves from the Church he will
pay to the King. An Englishman is born to be fleeced by the
mighty ones, and what with subsidies and loans and amicable aids
he is like to be worse off than before. His money is lost to him
whether it goes to Pope or bishop or exchequer clerk. I am a good
citizen and a true and loyal King's man, but it is the right of a
freeman to have his grumble."</p>

<p>Master Wellaby spoke up.</p>

<p>"You had an England of laymen and clerks, and you are
destroying it. What better will it be to have an England of rich
and poor? Will there be more peace and happiness, think you?"</p>

<p>A new-comer had ordered a meal, with an observing eye upon the
mercer's fare. He was a countryman by his ruddy face and the dust
on his square-toed boots and leather breeches, but from his dress
he might be reeve or steward or verderer or petty squire.</p>

<p>"Marry, there will always be rich and poor," he said, "since
the Scripture orders it, and since the new breed of rich is less
gentle than the old, the poor will fare the worse. Are the new
men that lord it to-day the make of the old? I trow not. What is
Russell and Audeley and Wriothesley to Mowbray and Bohun and
Mortimer, or Seymour to De Vere, or Fitzwilliam to Lovell? You
have a new man at the King's elbow, Master Crummle, of whom they
speak great things. Nevertheless he is but a gilded scrivener. My
own cousin saw him a score of years back a ragged serving-lad at
the door of Messer Friskyball's bank in Florence. It sticks in my
mind that the new masters will be harsher than the old, since
they are but risen servants."</p>

<p>"History confirms you, sir," said Master Wellaby eagerly. "In
ancient Rome the freedman was the worst tyrant."</p>

<p>"I know nought of Rome, ancient or new, but much of England,
notably that part of it which lies between Cherwell and Severn,
and I declare before God that I love the old ways best, as I love
best old ale and old pasture. 'Twere better if instead of
bare-back fleshers and scriveners the ancient masters bore rule
again in the land. Such an one as the mighty Duke of
Buckingham."</p>

<p>"Him that suffered in '21?" the mercer inquired.</p>

<p>"The same. His blood was direct from Bohun and King Edward.
There was the great lord! He had fourteen thousand marks of
rental each year, and he never stirred abroad without four
hundred armed men at his back."</p>

<p>"Too proud," said the mercer. "Too proud for a naughty world.
Wherefore did he die, good sir? I was only a stripling then and
forget the tale."</p>

<p>"Because of an old wives' gossip of treason. Wolsey, whom the
devil burn, feared to go to the French wars and leave such a man
behind him. It is our foolish fashion to sacrifice some great one
before we fight our enemies. 'Twas Pole in '13, and 'twas
Buckingham in '21. I uphold that the Duke's death was a crime in
God's eyes, and that He hath visited it not only on Wolsey who
was the guilty one, but on the King's grace who was an innocent
partaker. Witness his lamentable barrenness in the matter of
posterity. . . ."</p>

<p>There was a hush at the words, as if each auditor feared his
neighbour. But the countryman went on undaunted.</p>

<p>"And now there is nought left of the proud race of Stafford
and Bohun, and old England is the poorer place."</p>

<p>After that he spoke no more but gave his mind to a meat pasty.
Presently Wellaby rose to leave, and soon Peter was the only
occupant of the taproom. It was the hour of the evening meal at
Oseney, but Peter had no mind to it. He expended one of his few
coins on a little bread and cheese, and sat on as the dusk
deepened and the booths put up their shutters and women called
their husbands to supper.</p>

<p>He was in a mood of profound dejection, for two things had
befallen him that afternoon. He had realised that the life to
which he had vowed himself was in danger of becoming no more than
a blind alley, and that the huge fabric of the Church was falling
about his ears. Also he had been made aware that great events
were toward in the State, and he had seen the happy bustle of men
with purpose and power, while he himself sat a disconsidered
oddment in a corner. The blanket of the dark was very thick about
him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A hand touched him and woke him from his lassitude. It was one
of the Abbey servitors from Oseney.</p>

<p>"Make haste, Master Pentecost--'ee be wanted. I've been rakin'
Oxford for 'ee this past hour. Brother Tobias bade me bring 'ee
post-haste."</p>

<p>Peter followed him into the street, listless and incurious.
This was the consultation, no doubt, for which Tobias had trysted
him that morning. But what could Tobias do? Peter had not lost
the savour of life; the deadly sin of <i>accidia</i> was not his;
he felt the savour with a desperate keenness, but he despaired of
passing from the savour to the taste of it. . . . The crowd in
the street was less, since it was the meal hour, but there were
travellers on the road, spurring through the city to some
Cotswold inn or manor. Also there were many of the new proud
breed of collegians, coming from the Beaumont field to the
colleges nearest the river, or forsaking their bare commons for a
tavern supper. There were merchants of the town, too, taking the
air and discussing the last news, comfortable men, with a proper
reverence for a lord and a proper contempt for a poor scholar. .
. . To everyone he met, even the humblest, he was nothing--a
child of country peasants, a dabbler in unwanted learning, a
creature of a falling Church. In the bitterness of his soul he
clenched his hands till the nails hurt his palms. As he crossed
Bookbinders bridge and entered the Abbey he felt like a dog
whistled back to its kennel.</p>

<p>So low were his spirits that he did not notice that he was
being conducted to the Abbot's palace till his feet were on the
threshold. The messenger handed him over to the seneschal, who
appeared to be awaiting him. This was an odd spot for his
appointment with Tobias, for he had never entered the place
before, but he followed his guide dully through the outer hall,
and through the dining chamber and up a stairway of Forest
marble. He entered a room part panelled and part hung with
tapestries, which looked westward over the Botley causeway and
the Wytham meadows. It was lit by the summer sunset, and beside
the table stood two men.</p>

<p>One was Tobias, whose crab-apple face seemed strangely
perturbed. He looked at Peter with hungry eyes as if striving by
them to say that which he could not put into words. The other was
an old man dressed soberly in black, who wore a rich chain of
gold and a jewel on his breast. His face was deeply lined, his
mouth was grim, and he had the eye of one used to command.
Recollection awoke in Peter at the sight. This was the very man
whom he had seen wearing a purple cloak and an ermine collar in
the cavalcade of the evening before. He had guessed that he was
one of the King's commissioners sent to deal with the religious
houses. Eynsham had not been his goal. He must have been Oseney's
guest for the night.</p>

<p>Both men rose at his entrance and remained standing, a strange
thing for a great one in the presence of a youthful clerk. The
elder looked at him steadily, ardently, his eye taking in every
detail of the threadbare clothes and lithe form and comely face.
Then he sighed, but his sigh was not of disappointment.</p>

<p>"The same arch of the brows," he murmured, "and the little
cleft in the upper lip."</p>

<p>"You are he whom they call Peter Pentecost?" he said. "I have
searched long before I found you, my child. They told me that you
were an inmate of a religious house in these parts, but which I
could not learn. Having found you, I have much to tell you. But
first answer my question. Who and what are you and what was your
upbringing?" There was no rudeness in the interrogation, but
nevertheless it was peremptory, and the speaker's air had that in
it which compelled an answer.</p>

<p>"I was reared by one Mistress Sweetbread at Leafield, the
wife, and now the widow, of a Wychwood forester."</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"Your father?"</p>

<p>"Of him I know nothing. I have heard that he was a soldier who
fell in the wars oversea."</p>

<p>"Your mother?"</p>

<p>"I never saw her. She was, I think, of near kin to the
Sweetbreads, a sister or a sister's child."</p>

<p>The other smiled.</p>

<p>"It was a necessary imposture. There was no safety for such as
you except to bury you deep in some rustic place. You remember
nothing of the years before you came to Leafield?"</p>

<p>Peter shook his head. A wild hope was beginning to surge in
his heart.</p>

<p>"Then it is my privilege to enlighten you. There were some who
knew the truth, but it did not become them to speak. This good
man for one," and he turned to Tobias.</p>

<p>"I judged it wiser to let the past sleep," said Tobias, "for I
considered only the happiness of him whom I loved as my own son.
There was no need . . ."</p>

<p>"The need has arisen," said the old man firmly. "We who were
your father's friends have never lost sight of that likelihood,
though i' faith we let you sink so deep into Oxfordshire mud that
it has been hard to find you. That was the doing of our reverend
brother Tobias. You have lived a score of years in a happy
ignorance, but the hour has come when it must be broken. Your
mother . . ."</p>

<p>He paused, and Peter's heart stood still.</p>

<p>"Your mother was no Sweetbread kin. She was the Lady Elinor,
the eldest daughter of Percy of Northumberland."</p>

<p>Peter's heart beat again. He felt his forehead flush and a
wild gladness in him which sent the tears to his eyes. He was
noble then on the distaff side, noble with the rarest blood of
England. What runaway match, what crazy romance, had brought him
to birth?</p>

<p>"My father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Be comforted," said the other, smiling back. "I read your
face, but there is no bar sinister on your shield. You were born
in lawful wedlock, a second son. Your mother is long dead, your
elder brother is these three months in his grave. You are now the
only child of your father's house."</p>

<p>"My father?" The tension made Peter's voice as thin as a
bat's.</p>

<p>"Your father?" said the old man, and he rolled the words out
like a herald at a tourney. "Your father was that high and
puissant prince, Edward, Duke and Earl of Buckingham, Earl and
Baron of Stafford, Prince of Brecknock, Count of Perche in
Normandy, Knight of the Garter, hereditary Lord High Steward,
and, in virtue of the blood of Bohun, Lord High Constable of
England."</p>

<p>"He died in the year '21," said Peter, blindly repeating what
he had heard in the Ram inn.</p>

<p>"He died in the year '21, a shameful and unmerited death. His
lands and honours were thereby forfeited, and you have not one
rood to your name this day. But in the eyes of God and of honest
men throughout this land you are Buckingham and Bohun and the
sixth man from Edward the Third. I and those who think with me
have sought you long, and have planned subtly on your behalf, and
on behalf of this unhappy realm which groans under a cruel
tyranny. The times are ripe for a change of master, and there
will be no comfort for our poor people till that change be
accomplished."</p>

<p>"You would make me a duke?" Peter stammered.</p>

<p>The westering sun was in the old man's face, and it showed
that in his eyes which belied his age. He was suddenly
transfigured. He came forward, knelt before Peter, and took his
hand between his two palms.</p>

<p>"Nay, sire," he said, "by the grace of God we will make you
King of England."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c03">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<h1>IN WHICH PETER LURKS IN THE SHADOW</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Four weeks later to a day Peter sat again in his old eyrie,
above the highway which descended from Stowood to the Wood Eaton
meads. Strange things had happened meanwhile. Twenty-four hours
after the meeting in the Abbot's lodging the heat had broken in
thunderstorms, followed by such a deluge of rain as washed the
belated riverside haycocks to the sea and sent Isis and Cherwell
adventuring far into distant fields. In the floods a certain
humble dependent of Oseney, Pentecost by name, had the ill-luck
to perish. For two days he was missed from his accustomed haunts,
and on the third news came up the river from Dorchester that he
had been last seen attempting a crazy plank bridge over Thame
which had been forthwith carried down by the floods. The body was
not recovered, but there were many nameless bodies washed up
those days. Perfunctory masses were sung for the soul of the
drowned man in a side chapel of Oseney Great Church, and in the
little chapel of St George in the Castle, and Brother Tobias wore
a decent mask of grief and kept his chamber. A new master in
grammar was found for the novices, and there was a vacancy in an
Oseney corrody and an empty bed in the Castle garret. In a week a
deeper tide than that of Isis had submerged the memory of Peter
Pentecost.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to do such things cleanly," the old Lord
Avelard had said. "There must be no Lambert Simnel tale that
might crop up to our undoing." He was a careful gentleman, for
Brother Tobias was sent to Wychwood to spread the news, so that
those who had sat by Peter on the benches of Witney school might
spare a sigh for a lost companion.</p>

<p>Then Peter by night was taken to Sir Ralph Bonamy's house at
Wood Eaton. No servant saw him enter, but in the dark a clerk's
gown was burned, and in the morning a young man broke his fast in
Sir Ralph's hall, who bore the name of Bonamy, and was a cousin
out of Salop. The manor-house of Wood Eaton was no new-fangled
place such as fine gentlemen were building elsewhere. It was
still in substance the hall of Edward the First's day, with its
high raftered roof, its solar with plastered walls, its summer
parlour, its reedy moat, which could nevertheless be speedily
filled bank-high by a leat from Cherwell, its inner and outer
courtyards bastioned and loopholed for defence. Sir Ralph was as
antique as his dwelling. A widower and childless, he lived alone
with an ancient sister, who spent her days amid the gentle white
magic of herbs and simples. He was well beyond three-score and
ten years, but still immensely strong and vigorous, and able to
spend long days in the field with his hounds or on the meres with
his fishing pole. He was short and broad, with a noble head of
greying reddish hair, and he was clad always in coarse green
cloth like a yeoman, while his boots were as massive as an Otmoor
fowler's. He was a lover of good fare and mighty in hospitality,
so that his hall was like a public house of entertainment, where
neighbour or stranger could at any time get his fill of
beef-pudding and small beer. It was an untidy place, murky in
winter with wood-smoke and dim even in summer, for the windows
were few and dirty. It smelled always of cooked meats and of a
motley of animals, being full of dogs--deer-hounds and
gazehounds, and Malta spaniels, and terriers; likewise there were
hawks' perches, and Sir Ralph's favourite tassel-gentle sat at
his elbow. The stone floor was apt to be littered with
marrow-bones and the remains of the hounds' meals, and the odour
was not improved by the drying skins of wild game which hung on
the walls. Sir Ralph had a gusty voice and a habit of rough
speech, which suited his strange abode, but he was also notably
pious, and a confrater of Oseney; a small chapel opened from the
hall where the family priest conducted regular devotions, and he
kept his Fridays and fast days as rigidly as any Oseney canon. He
was an upholder of the old ways in all things--religion, speech,
food and furnishing.</p>

<p>Peter, clad in a sober, well-fitting suit of brown such as
became a country squire out of Salop, breakfasted his first
morning at Wood Eaton with his head in a whirl. His host, in a
great armed chair, made valorous inroads on a cold chine of beef,
and drank from a tun glass of ale which he stirred with a twig of
rosemary. The long hawking-pole, which never left him, leaned
against his chair, and by his hand lay a little white stick with
which he defended his platter against the efforts of a great
deer-hound and two spaniels to share its contents. Sir Ralph had
welcomed his guest with a gusto which he had in vain attempted to
make courtly, and since then had said nothing, being too busy
with food and dogs. "Eat, sir," he had said, "youth should be a
good trencherman. Now, alas! I can only pick like a puling
lanner." Then he cut himself a wedge of pie which might have
provisioned a ploughman for a week.</p>

<p>Peter turned his head at a sound behind him. Lord Avelard had
entered the hall, preceded by his body-servant, who arranged his
chair, procured him some wheaten cakes and butter, filled a glass
of sack which he mixed with syrup of gillyflowers, and then bowed
and took his leave. Seen for the first time in the morning light,
the face of the old man was such as to hold the eyes. His toilet
was but half made; he had slippers on his feet and still wore his
dressing-gown; his age was more apparent, and could not be less
than four-score; nevertheless, so strong was his air of purpose
that he seemed ready forthwith to lead an army or dominate a
council. A steady fire burned in his pale eyes, a fire of
enthusiasm, or, it might be, of hate. Peter, as he looked on him,
felt his curiosity changing to awe.</p>

<p>But the old man was very cordial to the young one. He greeted
him as a father might greet a son who was presently to be pope or
king.</p>

<p>"We will call him for a little by your name, Ralph," he said.
"Master Bonamy--Master Peter Bonamy--I have forgot what is his
worship's manor t'other side of Severn. . . . Wood Eaton will be
a safe retreat for a week or two, till I am ready to receive him
at Avelard."</p>

<p>"By your leave, my lord," said his host, "it is none too safe
a sanctuary. Wood Eaton has a plaguey name as a house of call for
all and sundry. It is as open as the Oxford corn-market.
Likewise, I have lodging here my niece Sabine--old Jack
Beauforest's daughter--you mind Jack of Dorchester, my lord? Come
to think of it, Sabine is as near kin to your deceased lady as to
me. She is gone for a week to the nuns at Godstow, where she went
to school--Abbess Katherine was her mother's cousin--but will be
home to-morrow. The secret with which you have entrusted me is
too big for a maid's ear, and I do not want Mistress Sabine and
this new cousin of ours to clap eyes on each other. You see the
reason of it, my lord, though, as one with a hospitable name, I
think shame to urge it."</p>

<p>"But I have a plan to offer," he continued, when he saw the
old man's countenance fall. "Let him go into Stowood to a
verderer's lodge. I, as principal ranger, can compass that. There
is one John of Milton, a silent man, who lives deep in the
forest, and to him I would send our cousin, my lord. There no eye
will see him save that of gipsy or charcoal-burner or purley-man,
and he will have leisure to perfect himself in arts in which I
gather he is lacking. A month will pass quick in the cool of the
forest."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard pondered. "Your plan is good, Ralph," he said.
"Wood Eaton is a thought too notable because of its master." He
looked at Peter and smiled. "How will you relish taking to the
greenwood like Robin Hood or Little John? You are dedicated, my
son, to a great purpose, and it has always been the custom of the
dedicated to sojourn first for a while in the wilderness."</p>

<p>His face, as he looked on the young man, was lit for a moment
with a strange tenderness, but the next second it had fallen back
into the wary mask of the conspirator.</p>

<p>"How goes the country, Ralph?" he asked. "What does
Oxfordshire say of the latest doings at Court?"</p>

<p>"Oxfordshire is very weary of the Welshman," was the answer,
"and grieves for the fate of poor Hal Norris. It was well to cut
off the Concubine's head, but why should Hal have been made to
suffer for her misdoings--Hal whom I knew from boyhood and who
was innocent as a christom babe? Wychwood and Langley forests had
never a better keeper than Hal. . . . Who is to have the post,
think you? I heard talk of Jack Brydges. . . ."</p>

<p>"The King, as you know, has married the Seymour, so he has a
new breed of wife's kin to provide for."</p>

<p>"The Welshman makes a poor business of marrying, for he has
nothing to show for his pains. The Lady Mary is outlawed, and the
Concubine's child is outlawed, and . . ."</p>

<p>"Nay, but there is a new conceit," said Lord Avelard.
"Parliament has granted the King's grace the power to bequeath
the Crown of England by will, as you or I might legate an old
doublet."</p>

<p>"God's wounds!" cried Sir Ralph, "but this is sacrilege! If a
pack of citizens can decide the disposition of the crown what
becomes of the Lord's anointing? It is the tie of blood which God
has determined. . . ."</p>

<p>"Do not vex yourself, for the thing works in our favour. If
the King forget the obligations of lawful descent, England
remembers them. . . . What further do you report of the
discontents?"</p>

<p>"There is the devil's own uproar over the King's extortions
among the gentle, and the simple complain that they are sore
oppressed by the inclosers and the engrossers and the
wool-staplers. Likewise the pious everywhere are perturbed, since
heretics sit in high places and the blasphemer is rampant in the
land. Crummle's commissioners go riding the roads, with the
spoils of God's houses on their varlets' backs, copes for
doublets and tunics for saddlecloths. There are preachers who
tell the folk that the Host is only a piece of baker's bread, and
that baptism is as lawful in a tub or a ditch as in a holy font;
and will allow a poor man none of the kindly little saints to
guide his steps when God and His Mother have bigger jobs on hand.
Certes, the new England they will bring upon us is good neither
for Jack nor his master."</p>

<p>"Jack knows it," said Lord Avelard. "I will prophesy to you,
Ralph. In a matter of months, or maybe of weeks, you will hear
strange news out of the eastern and northern shires. There will
be such a rising of poor Christian people as will shake the King
on his throne."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay. I have heard something of it. But Jack alone will
never oust the Welshman. That is a job for Jack's masters. What
of them, my lord? What of the nobles of England?"</p>

<p>"Their turn will come," was the answer. "First, the priests
and the common people. Then, when they have fluttered the heart
of the Court and drawn the King's levies into a difficult
campaign, we shall strike in the western and midland shires, and
the blow will not be by a bill in a clodhopper's hand but by a
glaive in a steel gauntlet. First the commonalty, then the
gentles--that is our stratagem."</p>

<p>"And of these latter more puissant folk what numbers can you
command? Remember, my lord, I have been a soldier. I was at
Flodden and Therouanne. I am not ignorant of the ways of
war."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard consulted a paper. "Your walls are secret?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"As the grave. Likewise I have no servant who is not deaf or
dull in the wits."</p>

<p>"Of the plain country squires throughout the land, three out
of four are on our side. . . . For the greater ones--Norfolk is
Harry's man, and Suffolk married his sister--we can reckon on
neither. . . . In the north there is hope of Northumberland. He
was once affianced to the Concubine and weeps her death, and
likewise he is your cousin's kin on the distaff side." He smiled
on Peter. "Westmoreland and Cumberland are with us, and Latimer
and Lumley. In the mid shires and the east we shall have Rutland
and Huntingdon and Hussey and Darcy. We can count assuredly on
the Nevilles. . . . Shrewsbury we cannot get, but if we lose the
Talbots we have the Stanleys."</p>

<p>"What of the west?" Sir Ralph asked. "What of Exeter?"</p>

<p>"I have good hopes. But the Courtenay blood is hard to judge,
being in all things capricious, and my lord of Exeter is a
grandson of Edward Fourth, and so himself within modest distance
of the throne. He cannot love the Tudor, but he may not consent
to give place to a son of Buckingham. Yet we shall see. . . .
What of you, old friend? Will you strike again for England
against the Welshman the shrewd blow which you struck against the
Scot at Flodden?"</p>

<p>"I am aged," was the answer, "and am somewhat set in my
habits. But I stand for holy Church, the old blood and the old
ways, and not least for Ned Stafford's son. I will ride with you,
provided your campaigning season does not fall athwart my other
duties. . . . Let me consider. In the months of August and
September, I am engaged, as principal ranger of the King's
forests of Stowood and Shotover, in thinning the deer. The fallow
buck are already ripe for the bolt, and in a week the velvet will
be off the red deer's horns. That brings me to October, when we
take the wild fowl from the Otmoor fleets; a heavy task which
needs a master's eye and hand. Then up to Yule I hunt the fox and
badger and get the pike out of the river. January is a busy time
with my falcons, seeing that the geese are on the wing if it be
frost, and if it be mild the pigeons are in every spinney.
February and March are the training months for the eyasses, while
the herons nest, and in April and May there are the trout to be
caught in the Fettiplace waters and the monks' ponds of Bicester.
In summertime I have the young haggards to consider which my men
take in the forest, and that, too, is the season when the
<i>man&egrave;ge</i> must be looked to against the hunting
months."</p>

<p>"You have filled up your year to the last minute," said Lord
Avelard.</p>

<p>"By the sorrows of God, I have." He pondered in deep
perplexity. "Let it be summer, then," he said at length. "I must
leave the haggards to my falconer Merryman. I will mount and ride
with you if your summons come on the first day of June. But, as
you love me, not a day sooner, for Windrush trout rise heartily
till the last moment of May."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>So Peter had exchanged the gloomy halls of Wood Eaton for the
verderer's lodge deep in the heart of Stowood, where the ground
fell steeply from the chantry of Stanton St John to the swamps of
Menmarsh. The lodge stood in a glade among oaks, beside a strong
spring of water--a pleasant spot, for the dwellers there looked
northward over dim blue airy distances and a foreground as
fantastic as a tapestry. The verderer, John of Milton, who came
from the Milton hamlets in the east by Thame side, was all day
absent on his own errands, and to Peter, as a cousin of the chief
ranger, he behaved as a respectful servitor, sparing of speech
but quick to execute his wishes. The boy was not lonely, for he
went anew to school. Under Sir Ralph's direction he was taught
the accomplishments of his rank. One of the Wood Eaton men, who
had like his master confronted the Scottish spears at Flodden,
taught him various devices in the use of the two-edged,
cut-and-thrust blade, of which he already had mastered more than
the rudiments. A hedge-captain came out from Oxford to instruct
him in the new Spanish sword-play, where the edge was scarcely
used and the point was everything. Peter had often marked the man
in Oxford and had taken him for a lord from his fierce eyebrows
and arrogant air--but he proved only a different kind of usher,
who doffed his cap respectfully to Sir Ralph's kin. Likewise, Sir
Ralph's chief falconer, Merryman, who was an adept at the
cross-bow, made Peter sweat through long mornings shooting at a
mark, and a Noke man taught him to stretch the long-bow. Peter
was no discredit to his tutors, for his eye was true, his sinews
strong and his docility complete. Besides, his training had been
well begun years before on the skirts of Wychwood.</p>

<p>At last had come Brother Tobias, riding out on an Abbey mule,
when the little wild strawberries were ripe in the coverts.
Tobias liked these fruits, and had a bowl of them, lappered in
cream from the verderer's red cow. He regarded Peter nervously,
avoiding his eye, but stealing sidelong glances at him, as if
uncertain what he should find. Peter himself had no shyness, for
this old man was the thing he loved best in the world.</p>

<p>"You knew all the time?" he asked when he had settled his
guest on a seat of moss beside the spring.</p>

<p>"I knew, and I was minded never to tell," was his answer. "You
were born too high to find peace; therefore I judged that it was
well that you should remain low, seeking only the altitude which
may be found in God's service. It was not so decreed, and I bow
to a higher wisdom."</p>

<p>But if Tobias was embarrassed he was likewise exalted. It
appeared to him that his decision had been directly overruled by
Omnipotence, and that his pupil had been chosen for a great
mission--no less than the raising again of Christ's Church in
England. He expounded his hopes in an eager quivering voice. The
Church stood for the supremacy of spiritual things, and the King
out of a damnable heresy would make it a footstool to the throne.
The Church stood for eternal right and eternal justice; if it
fell, then selfish ambition and man-made laws would usurp the
place of these verities. Upon the strength of the Church depended
the unity of Christendom. Weaken that integrity, and Christendom
fell asunder into warring and jealous nations, and peace fled for
ever from the world. Granted abuses many; these must be set in
order by a firm hand. But Pope must be above King, the Church's
rights above the secular law, or there could be no Christian
unity. God and Mammon, Christ and C&aelig;sar--they could not
share an equal rule; one must be on top, and if it were Mammon or
C&aelig;sar then the soul's salvation was ranked lower than the
interests of a decaying and transitory world. It was the ancient
struggle which began in Eden, and now in England it had come to
the testing-point, and Peter was the champion by whose prowess
the Church must stand or fall.</p>

<p>The old man's voice ceased to quiver and he became eloquent.
Forgotten was the Grecian, the exponent of new ways in learning,
the zealous critic of clerical infirmities; he who sat on the
moss was a dreamer of the same dreams, an apostle of the same
ideals, as those which had filled his novitiate.</p>

<p>Peter said nothing--he spoke little these days. But he
remembered the sinking revenues and the grass-grown courts of
Oseney, the pedantries of the brethren, the intrigues and
quarrels that filled their petty days. He remembered, too, the
talk of Lord Avelard. Those who took the Church's side in the
quarrel had, few of them, much care for the Church, save as part
of that ancient England with which their own privileges were
intertwined. None had such a vision as Brother Tobias. Peter had
travelled far in these last years from his old preceptor, and had
come to think of the Church as no better than a valley of dry
bones. Could those bones live again? Were there many with the
faith of Tobias, life might still be breathed into them. But were
there many? Was there even one? He sighed, for he knew that he
was not that one. Disillusionment had gone too far with him, and
his youth had been different from that of the old believer at his
side.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He sat that August afternoon on his familiar perch above the
highway, and his head was like a hive of bees. It had been
humming for weeks, and had become no clearer. Outwardly he was a
silent and reflective young man, very docile among his elders,
but inwardly he was whirlpool and volcano.</p>

<p>He had got his desire, and he was not intoxicated or puffed up
or strung to a great purpose; rather he was afraid. That was his
trouble--fear--fear of a destiny too big for him. It was not
bodily fear, though he had visions now and then of the scaffold,
and his own head on that block where once his father's had lain.
Rather it was dread of an unfamiliar world in which he had no
part.</p>

<p>Lord Avelard's was the face that stuck in his mind--that wise,
secret face, those heavily pouched eyes, the gleam in them of an
unquestionable pride and an undying hate. He had treated him
tenderly as the son of an old friend, and respectfully, as one of
whom he would make a king. But Peter knew well that he was no
more to Lord Avelard than the sword by his side, a weapon to be
used, but in a good cause to be splintered. The man and all his
kin, the ancientry of England, were at deadly enmity with this
Welshman who had curbed their power, and was bringing in a horde
of new men to take their places. They professed to speak in the
name of the burdened English commons, but for the poor man he
knew they cared not a jot; given the chance they would oppress as
heartily as any royal commissioner; was it not they who had begun
the ousting of tillage by the new sheep pastures? They claimed to
stand for the elder England and its rights, and the old Church,
but at heart they stood only for themselves. . . . And he was to
be their tool, because he had the blood of the ancient kings in
him. He was being trained for his part, so that when he came into
the sunlight he should have the air and accomplishments of his
rank. . . . Peter sickened, for it seemed to him that he was no
more than a dumb ox being made ready for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>They professed to fight in the name of Christ's Church. For a
moment a recollection of Tobias's earnest eyes gave this plea a
shadow of weight. Sir Ralph, too. That worthy knight, if he could
be dragged from his field sports, would fight out of piety rather
than concern for his secular privileges. . . . But the rest! . .
. And was that Church truly worth fighting for? Had he any desire
to set Aristotle and St Thomas back in their stalls? Was he not
vowed heart and soul to the new learning which Colet and Erasmus
had brought into England, and would not his triumph mean a
falling back from these apples of the Hesperides to the dead
husks of the Schools? Was it any great matter that the Pope in
Rome, who had been but a stepfather to England, should have the
last word, and not an anointed king? Was there no need of change
in the consecrated fabric? Half the religious houses in England
were in decay, no longer lamps to the countryside, but dark
burrows where a few old men dragged out weary days.</p>

<p>He tried to recover that glowing picture of the Church of God
which he had brought with him from Witney school, when Oseney's
towers seemed to be bathed in a heavenly light, and its courts
the abode of sages and seraphs. He tried to remember and share in
Tobias's vision of Christendom. It was useless. He saw only the
crumbling mortar and the warped beams of Oseney cloisters, and
heard Brother Lapidarius and Brother Johannes disputing shrilly
about the Kidlington dues, over their fried onions at supper. . .
. The glamour had passed. How could he champion that in which he
had no belief or men who at the best were half-believers?</p>

<p>As he looked at the strip of highway passing through the
canyon of the forest he recalled with a shock that evening a
month before, when at the end of a day of holiday he had watched
the pageant of life on the road beneath him, and longed for an
ampler share in it than fell to the lot of a poor clerk of St
George's. He had got his wish. He remembered his bitter jealousy
in the hot Oxford streets of a sounding world in which he had no
part. He was in the way during the next few months of getting a
full portion of that world. And he realised that he did not want
it, that the fruit was ashes before he put his mouth to it.</p>

<p>Peter tried to be honest with himself. One thing he had gained
that could never be taken from him. He was not born of nameless
peasants, but of the proudest stock in England. He had in his
veins the blood of kings. That was the thought which he hugged to
his breast to cheer his despondency. . . . But now he knew that
he wanted that knowledge, and nothing more. He did not desire to
live in palaces or lead armies. He wanted, with that certainty of
his birth to warm his heart, to go back to his old bookish life,
or to sink deep among countryfolk into the primordial country
peace. He had thought himself ambitious, but he had been wrong.
His early life had spoiled him for that bustling fever which
takes men to high places. He did not like the dust of the arena,
and he did not value the laurels.</p>

<p>The opposite slope of the hill towards Elsfield was golden in
the afternoon sunlight, and mottled with the shadows of a few
summer clouds. He saw the brackeny meadow, and above it the
little coppice which hid the Painted Floor. He had a sudden
longing to go there. It was his own sanctuary, hallowed with his
innermost dreams. It represented a world of grace and simplicity
&aelig;ons removed from the turbid present. . . . But he did not
dare. He must go through with the course to which he was
predestined. He had got what he had hungered for, but he felt
like a wild thing in a trap. Yet he was Buckingham's son, and
there could be no turning back.</p>

<p>A magpie flew down the hollow, but he had turned his head to
the hill and did not notice it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There was a hunt that day in Stowood. At dawn the slowhounds
had been out to start the deer and the greyhounds had been
unleashed before noon. They had begun by running a knobber in the
Shabbington coverts, but in the afternoon the sport had been
better, for they had found a stag of ten in the oak wood by
Stanton and had hunted him through the jungle of the Wick and the
Elsfield dingles, and killed in the hollow east of Beckley. As
Peter made his way back to the verderer's lodge he had heard the
mort sounded a mile off.</p>

<p>He hastened, for he wished to be indoors before he was seen by
any straggling hunter. Such had been Sir Ralph's precise
injunction; when the hunt was out he must bide indoors or in
cover. But this time he was too late. He heard cries and laughter
on all sides; a knot of hunt servants, whom they called Ragged
Robins, crossed the road ahead of him at a canter. Worse, he saw
two of the hunters coming towards him, whom he could not choose
but pass. One was a woman on a black jennet, the other a young
man on a great grey gelding. The first wore a riding dress all of
white, with a velvet three-cornered cap, and a rich waistcoat of
green velvet, the other had the common green habit of the woods,
and was not to be distinguished from a yeoman save by the plume
and the jewel in his flat cap.</p>

<p>Peter recognised the man first. He was the rider whom he had
envied a month ago, first at the gate of Stowood and then in the
Oxford street, because he seemed so wholly master of his world.
The man had still that mastery. He passed the boy with a lifted
hand to acknowledge his greeting, but he scarcely spared him a
glance; nor were his eyes set on his companion, but roaming
fiercely about as if to seek out matter of interest or quarrel.
His weathered face had the flush of recent exertion, but his pale
eyes were cool and wary.</p>

<p>These same eyes might well have been on the girl at his side.
Peter had a glimpse of ashen gold hair under the white cap, a
cheek of a delicate rose above the pale ivory of the uncovered
neck. She bowed her head slightly to his salute, and ere she
passed on for one instant the heavy lids were raised from her
eyes.</p>

<p>Peter stood stock still, but he did not look after them. This
was the white girl who had danced at midnight on the Painted
Floor. Now he had seen her eyes, and he knew that there was that
in them of which the memory would not die.</p>

<p>He continued his way in a stupor of wonderment and uneasy
delight. He halted at the spring by the verderer's lodge, and
turned at the sound of hoofs behind him. To his amazement it was
the girl. She sprang from her horse as lightly as a bird. The
jennet, whose bit was flecked with foam, would have nuzzled her
shoulder, but she slapped its neck so that it started and stood
quivering.</p>

<p>"I am warm with the chase, sir," she said. "I would beg a cup
of water."</p>

<p>Peter fetched a bowl from the lodge and filled it at the
spring. When he gave it her she sipped a mouthful. Her face was
no longer rose-tinted but flushed, and she was smiling.</p>

<p>"Greeting, cousin," she said. "I think you are my cousin Peter
from Severn side. I am niece of Sir Ralph Bonamy at Wood Eaton.
My name is Sabine Beauforest."</p>

<p>She offered him her cheek to kiss. Then she drew back, and to
Peter it appeared that she blushed deeply. She sank in a low
curtsey on the moss, took his hand and carried it to her
lips.</p>

<p>"I am your Grace's most loyal and devoted servant," she
said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c04">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>

<h1>IN WHICH PETER GOES DEEPER INTO THE GREENWOOD</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Two days later came Sir Ralph Bonamy to the verderer's lodge
in Stowood. He left his big-boned horse in a servant's charge
half a mile from the place, and reached the cottage by a track
among brambles and saplings, walking so fast that the sweat
beaded his brow. Clearly Sir Ralph's errand was one of speed and
secrecy.</p>

<p>"This is but a feeble harbourage," he told Peter. "I thought
you were safe here as in the heart of Otmoor, but you have taken
the air too freely, my lad. It seems you have been seen, and
questions asked, for a youth of your shape and bearing is a
scarce thing in the forest."</p>

<p>"There was a lady . . ." Peter began.</p>

<p>"Ay. That was my niece Sabine. If I ever trusted woman with a
secret, it would be niece Sabine, for she is close as a
hazel-nut. She had word of a cousin from beyond Severn who was
sojourning in Stowood, and, being a quick-witted wench, put a
name to you when she saw you. It is not Mistress Sabine that
troubles me, for I can control my womenkind, but he that rode
with her. Did you mark him?"</p>

<p>"A tall fellow with a stiff neck and a proud eye."</p>

<p>"That is he. That is Master Simon. I have naught against the
lad, though my sire and his fought like cockerels. They both
claimed for their scutcheons the barry nebuly of Blount, and they
wrangled as bitterly over that device as Scrope and Grosvenor
over the bend d'or. The lad himself is well enough, a good man to
horse and hound, a keen eye for a cross-bow, and a strong hand
for the sword. But he is not of our faction."</p>

<p>"Is he one of Crummle's men?"</p>

<p>"Nay, he loves Crummle and his rabble as little as I. But he
is a King's man, and has been on some errand of the Welshman's to
the northern states of Europe. Also, he has been on voyages with
the Bristol merchants, and has picked up some vile heresies in
outlandish parts. My news is that he is asking questions about a
stranger in Stowood, and when such an one asks he is likely to
get an answer. He lives too plaguily near at hand for my peace of
mind, for he is Simon Rede of Boarstall--his home is not five
miles distant under Muswell hill. Also through his mother he has
heired the manor of Headington, and his lawful occasions take him
often through this forest. We must find you a safer lodging,
friend Peter."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph removed his bonnet, and with his great brown face,
and his ancient brown doublet, much soiled at the shoulders by
his falcons, he looked not unlike a stump of oak.</p>

<p>"You are not due at Avelard yet awhile, and we must jealously
observe my lord's instructions. But Avelard is the other side of
Cotswold, and the nearer you are to it the better for my lord's
purposes. My advice is that you move west in the company which I
shall appoint for you. I had thoughts of sending you to Otmoor
among the moormen, but Simon is a moorman himself after a
fashion, and Boarstall is on the edge of the meres. You will be
safer in Wychwood and Cotswold."</p>

<p>"I was bred there," said Peter. "There are many living who
remember me. Mother Sweetbread . . ."</p>

<p>"Why, so much the better. Peter Pentecost is dead and masses
sung for his soul, but Mother Sweetbread will not have forgot him
and will welcome her foster-child restored to her, whatever name
he may choose to bear. She has all along been privy to your tale,
for she was a serving-woman of your mother's. There you will be
safe from the sharp eyes of Simon Rede, and the coverts of
Wychwood are deeper than the coverts of Shabbington. But to make
security certain I have trysted with one who will accompany you
and never leave your side till you are safe at Avelard. He will
be here before sunset to start with you, and 'twere well that you
keep yourself privy till then."</p>

<p>"Who is this guide?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph smiled and scratched his head. "That were hard to
say. The name he will give you is Solomon Darking, but he has
many others. He is of the old race of these parts, the squat dark
folk we call the Wens, who were here a thousand years before the
Romans. He is a true man and a wise man, and if he seems strange
to you, remember that wisdom is apt to cohabit with oddity. There
are mannikins plenty who have seen something of oddity in
<i>me.</i> This I can tell you. If I were fleeing for my life it
is to Solomon Darking I would go, for he could call the beasts of
the field and the birds of the air to my defence. . . . Farewell
and God bless you. I must get me to Beckley, where there is a
gyr-falcon training for me at the Upper Lodge."</p>

<p>Off rode Sir Ralph, leaving Peter to an afternoon's meditation
in the deeps of an oak coppice. Two days had worked a miracle in
his mood. He was no more the doubter, proud only of his
rediscovered race, but shrinking from the hazards and heartbreaks
of the career into which others would thrust him. He now longed
for it. He longed to set his foot on the wildest road so long as
it led him to the hill-top. For he had seen someone for whom a
hill-top was the only dwelling.</p>

<p>The girl, of whom he had had two glimpses in the afternoon
sunshine of Stowood, whom he had seen dancing at midnight on the
Painted Floor under the moon, had sent warmth and light running
through a world that had seemed all frost and shadow. . . . He
had never since his childhood looked a woman full in the face. He
had been aware of them as mysterious beings, sometimes old and
witch-like, sometimes young and shining, but always to be shunned
by him who would serve God and save his soul. Yet he had had his
own fancies. He had seen in imagination the slim girls in
Theocritus dancing to the shepherd's pipes, and he had exulted in
the proud tales of old queens, for whom men had counted the world
well lost. So he had come in time to make for himself pictures of
a woman who should be fair as Helen and gentle as the Virgin
Mother, pictures as vague as gossamer, for they rested on no base
of human meaning. Sometimes indeed, when the sun was bright of a
spring morning, his visions had taken a simple form, and he had
felt strange stirrings of the blood, which he had not resisted as
sin--which he had not even questioned, for they seemed as
innocent as thirst or hunger.</p>

<p>But now, suddenly, all his imaginings and desires had become
centred on a living woman. She had first come to him on his own
Painted Floor, a fellow discoverer. Two days ago she had taken
his hand and called him liege-lord. Surely in this there was a
divine foreordering. What if the two of them were predestined to
tread the road together? That road which seemed so grim would be
different indeed if that white girl were by his side, and if at
the end of it he could make her a queen. For a queen she was born
to be; nothing less would content him, or be worthy of her
magnificence. . . . Peter, deep in the oak scrub, felt a wild
hunger to be up and doing, to be treading the path to greatness
which others had marked out for him. It was a fine thing to be
Buckingham and Bohun; it would be a finer to lay England at
Sabine Beauforest's feet. He thought of her with none of the
tremors of a lover. He did not ask her beauty for his arms, but
that principalities and powers should rest in her slender hands.
He was in that first stage of love when it is divinely
unselfish.</p>

<p>When the shadows began to lengthen he returned to the
verderer's lodge, dressed himself for a long journey, and put a
few simple belongings into his wallet. He was to be still in the
greenwood, but a little nearer to the hour and the place where he
would begin his new life.</p>

<p>Presently out of the thicket came an urchin. John of Milton
was gone to Bernwood, so Peter was the only living thing in the
place for the messenger to accost. The boy was about twelve years
of age, squat and freckled and frog-like. He spoke in a tongue
which was hard to comprehend, but his intention was made clear by
a jerked thumb. He had been sent to lead him somewhither to
someone. Peter picked up his wallet and followed.</p>

<p>The urchin led him, at a pace surprising in one so small, past
the granges of Woodperry, and downhill to where a long tongue of
Otmoor crept into the forest. After that the road lay in the dry
belt of tall reeds along the edge of the marsh, till the slopes
of Beckley had been turned and the rise of Wood Eaton hill was
visible, and the hovels of Noke, smoking for the evening meal,
could be seen over pools now reddened with the sunset. Then they
turned north, along a causeway which brought them to the little
river Ray, which they crossed by a plank under the hamlet of
Oddington, where geese were making a great clamour in the
twilight. Once again they were in forest country, a long rough
hillside full of hollows and thickets. Into one of these they
plunged, and after a rough passage came into an open space in the
heart of it, where a fire burned. There the urchin disappeared,
and Peter found himself confronted with a man who rose from
tending a pot and doffed his cap.</p>

<p>The man was short and burly in figure, his dress was that of a
forester, and he carried a cross-bow slung on his back and a long
hunting knife in his girdle. His face was sharp and yellow, like
one who had suffered from the moor-ill, and a mop of thick black
hair fell to his shoulders. His eyes, seen in the firelight, were
like a dog's, large and sombre and steadfast.</p>

<p>"I seek Solomon Darking," said Peter.</p>

<p>"He is before you, my lord," was the answer. "He that you wot
of has spoken to me. I make you welcome to a hunter's hearth. You
will eat and then you will sleep, but dawn must find us many
miles on our way. Sit ye down. No grace is needed for food eaten
under the sky."</p>

<p>He made a seat for Peter on a heap of fern, and served him
with stew from the pot on a little iron platter. He did not eat
himself, but waited upon his guest like a servant. When Peter had
finished he cleansed the platter in a well of water and made his
own meal. The same water was the sole beverage. Not a word was
spoken; the only sounds were the crumbling of the fire's ashes,
the babble of a brook that ran from the well, and--very far
off--the chiming of bells from Islip church. When he had finished
the forester again washed the platter, cut some swathes of
bracken and made two beds, and stamped out the embers. He stood
listening, like a dog at fault, for a moment, and then, like a
dog, shook his head and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"To your couch, my lord," he said. "You have four hours to
sleep ere we take the road. A wise man feeds full and sleeps deep
when he has the chance, for it may be long before that chance
returns."</p>

<p>Peter asked no questions. There was something about this man
which made them needless. He had the sense of being shepherded by
wise hands, and laid his head on the bracken as confidently as he
had ever laid it on his pallet in the Oxford attic.</p>

<p>He was awakened while it was still night, though there was a
thin bar of grey light on the eastern horizon. Darking stood
ready for the road, and Peter, rubbing sleepy eyes, did up the
belt of his doublet and prepared to follow him. There was a thick
dew on the ground, and Peter was soon soaked to the knees; also
the air blew cold as if rain was coming from the west. Come it
did before they had crossed the Cherwell, and Peter, empty and
chilly, felt his spirits sink. Soon, however, he found that he
had so much ado to keep up with his companion's vigour that he
had no leisure to despond. Darking moved at a prodigious pace, so
fast that Peter, who was half a foot taller and had longer legs,
was compelled often to trot to keep abreast of his stride.
Moreover, the road chosen seemed to be the worst conceivable.
Anything like a path was shunned, even when it bent in the right
direction. Open meadowland, the bare crest of a hill, a broad
woodland glade were avoided as if an enemy's arrows commanded
them. Darking did not even take advantage of the fords, for
streams were crossed at their deepest and miriest. Presently, as
they toiled through a thicket of oak saplings, the sun came out.
Darking sniffed the air. "The rain has gone," he said. "It will
be fine till sunset. We are nearing our breakfast."</p>

<p>They came to an outcrop of rock rising above the woods and
thatched with wild berries. From a distance its bald head could
not be distinguished from the oak tops; it looked like a patch of
dead wood in the coppice. There was a hollow on the left, and
this had been roofed with timber, now so lichened as to be
indistinguishable from stone. The result was a narrow hut,
discernible only at the closest quarters by one who knew what he
sought. In front of it a blackened angle of the rock showed where
a fire had once burned.</p>

<p>Darking brought some dry billets and twigs from the hut, and
laid and lit a fire. From the hut, too, he fetched a pan, some
collops of deer's meat, a lump of deer fat, a loaf of rye-bread,
and a leatherjack of ale.</p>

<p>"Strip," he commanded. "You will have ague in your young bones
if you sit in a damp shirt. For me, I am so full of it that a
wetting more or less does not concern me."</p>

<p>So Peter, stripped to the buff, sat warming his toes at the
fire, while the meat sizzled in the pan, and his clothes,
stretched on the rock face, dried fast in the sun.</p>

<p>"You have led me by a hard road," he said, when Darking filled
his platter. "Why need it have been so secret? Are you a man of
many enemies?"</p>

<p>Darking's gravity did not respond to the smile on the young
man's face.</p>

<p>"It is well to be secret in such times," he said. "Households
are divided within themselves and sons are set against fathers.
No man knows his enemy. He who would live at peace must take the
byways. I was told that it is most needful that you, my lord,
keep out of men's sight yet awhile; therefore, while you are in
my company we will court no questions."</p>

<p>He broke off and pointed to the south, where a flock of birds
was wheeling. He stared till they were out of sight, and when he
spoke his voice was solemn.</p>

<p>"That is the second portent within the week. Last Thursday in
Horton spinney I saw a bramble with both ends growing in the
ground. Know you the meaning of that? It is the noose the Devil
makes for his next hunting. . . . And now, behold these
birds."</p>

<p>"They are only curlews," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Curlews and whimbrels--young birds bred on the hills. But
what do they here in the tail of August? Two months ago they
should have been on the salt beaches. Remember, the long beaks
are no common fowls, but have foreknowledge of many things, and
their lives are full as long as a man's. They tarry inland to see
what they shall see. The old wives say that a curlew after June
spells foul weather. Foul weather comes, not in the heavens, but
in the ways of men. Therefore it were wise to go secretly."</p>

<p>They crossed the little streams of Dorn and Glyme and came out
of the forest to wide downs of grass and furze. Bearing
northward, they still ascended, Darking in the bare places
showing as much precaution as if he were stalking a winter's
hind. They never passed a crest except on their bellies, or
crossed an open slope without a long reconnaissance. They had
seen no dwelling or sign of man, but he behaved as if he were in
a populous land. At last they reached a point which seemed the
highest ground in the neighbourhood, for on every side the
country fell away into valleys.</p>

<p>Peter recognised his whereabouts. He was on the skirts of
Wychwood, the other side from where he had dwelt as a child, and
so to him unknown country. Away to the south he saw the lift of
the Leafield ridge, and that gave him his bearings. All about
them the forest flowed in a dark tide, so that it seemed to cover
the whole visible earth. The little clearings round the hamlets
were not seen, and the only open patches were the marshy
stream-sides far below, which showed bright green among the dun
and olive of the woods. It seemed a country as empty of man as
when primeval beasts had trumpeted in the glades and wallowed in
the sloughs. And yet their journey had been as stealthy as if
enemies had lurked in every acre.</p>

<p>"There are no folk left hereabouts," Peter said. "Why have we
made so secret a business of this morning?"</p>

<p>"The hamlets are emptying, but the woods are filling," said
Darking.</p>

<p>"But we have seen no sign of humanity since sunrise."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have not, my lord, but you have not the ears and
eyes for the forest. I have seen and heard many."</p>

<p>Peter stared.</p>

<p>"There were charcoal-burners in the coppice above the Dorn.
There was a camp of Egyptians a mile on--I smelt their cooking--a
fawn, I think. A man with a long-bow was in the thicket this side
of Glyme. I saw two of the Ditchley foresters pass on our left
but an hour ago, and there was a horseman in a mighty hurry on
the road from Woodstock to Enstone. Also the prickers were out
among the hazels beyond Wootton. One way and another I have seen
a score of mortals since we broke our fast."</p>

<p>"They did not observe us?"</p>

<p>"Of that I am certain." A slow smile lit his sallow face.</p>

<p>"But I have seen no smoke from cot or village," said
Peter.</p>

<p>"You will see none. There are few cots, save here and there a
forester's lodge, and scarcely a village. The land has become all
wood and sheep-walks."</p>

<p>"And the people?"</p>

<p>"Dead or wanderers. England is full of broken and masterless
men this day. They have gone under the ground, finding life too
hard above it. Let us press on, and I will show you
something."</p>

<p>They came presently to an upland meadow whence rose one of the
feeders of Evenlode. Once there had been a village here, for
there were the ruins of a score of mud-and-wattle huts. The
baulks of the common field were still plain; likewise orchards
running wild, and that rank growth of weeds which means abandoned
ploughland. In one corner by the brook stood a heap of stones,
which at first sight Peter took for a quarry. Darking stood for a
little gazing at the scene.</p>

<p>"When I was a child," he said, "this was a thriving village.
Bourtree was its name--Bourtree in the Bush, men called it. Half
a hundred souls had their dwelling here, and it was noted over
all the land for its honey. You must know that there was a
miracle wrought here. Once upon a time a fellow stole a fragment
of the Host that he might work magic by it, and set it by his
hives to improve their yield. But the bees, the little pious
ones, built round it a church all of wax, with altar and windows
and steeple, to protect its holiness. You have heard the
tale?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded. He had told the story to the novices at
Oseney.</p>

<p>"Behold Bourtree to-day! The church is a heap of stones, most
of which they have carried off to help build the new great church
at Charlbury. What was once tillage and orchard is now
sheep-walks for the graziers. The men and women that dwelled here
are most of them under the sod, and if any still live, they are
nameless folk drifting like blown leaves in the shadows."</p>

<p>He lifted his head and looked Peter full in the face with his
odd melancholy eyes. "Much of old England is gone to ground, my
lord," he said. "Keep that in your mind and ponder on it, for it
may deeply concern your own business."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"I have brought you to a Pisgah-sight," said Darking an hour
later. "The land is your own, so long as I am with you, and you
are as secure as a badger in its earth. What are your commands,
my lord? I can hide you so snugly till the summons comes that all
the King's armies searching daily for ten years would not find
you. But that might be but a dismal life for youth in sunshiny
weather. Or . . ." He paused.</p>

<p>"Or?" Peter repeated.</p>

<p>"Or I can take you with me a little way underground--among the
masterless folk who will soon be half our people. I ask no
questions, my lord, but he at Wood Eaton warned me that you were
a precious piece of goods that mattered much for the welfare of
England. The gentles play their high games and the noise of them
fills the world, but in the end it is the simple who decree the
issue. Would you sojourn for awhile among the simple?"</p>

<p>"I was bred among them," said Peter. "I would first see my
foster-mother, the widow Sweetbread, who lives below Leafield on
the forest edge. Do you know the place?"</p>

<p>"Nay, then, since you are Mother Sweetbread's fosterling, you
have already the right of entry among all the forest people. Well
I know her. Her good-man, Robin Sweetbread, was my trusty
comrade." He seemed suddenly to look at Peter with changed eyes,
as if a special password to his confidence had been spoken.</p>

<p>When they took the road again, so as to ford Evenlode and come
down the Windrush side, Darking, while still wary in choosing
obscure paths, was no longer silent. Friendliness now mingled
with his dignity. He spoke to Peter like a respectful kinsman. He
was quick to point out, here a derelict farm, there a ruined
village, among the grassy spaces of the hills.</p>

<p>"'Twas the little granges first, and then the hamlets, and
now, if all tales be true, 'twill soon be the proud abbeys.
Nought of man's work in England is steadfast, not even the houses
he has built for God. What sends an earl to the block sends a
churl to the gallows' hill, and the churl's wife and children to
eat nettles by the wayside. None is safe to-day save those who do
not raise their noses above the covert, and the numbers in the
covert grow fast."</p>

<p>"Are you among them?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>Darking lifted his head proudly. "No man can harm us of the
old England and the older blood. Kings and nobles and priests may
pass, but we remain. Ours is the <i>fallentis semita
vit&aelig;,</i> which is beyond the ken of the great."</p>

<p>Peter cried out in surprise: "Have you the Latin?"</p>

<p>"A tag or two," and a smile wrinkled the sallow cheeks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread welcomed Peter as one recovered from the
dead. She strained him to her breast and wept over him. "They
said you were drowned," she crooned. "Brother Tobias spoke a word
in my ear that you still lived, but he warned me that I should
never see you more. And now you come stepping like Robin Hood out
of the woods, clad as a proper man and no clerk. Son Peterkin,
you are now a man indeed."</p>

<p>She had been a tall woman till age had bent her, and she had
none of the deformity of the old peasant, crippled with ague and
incessant toil. Her petticoat was coarse but spotless, and on her
head was the snowy curch which was Peter's clearest memory of his
childhood. Out of her high-coloured old face looked two eyes as
black as sloes. Merry eyes they still were, for mirth and she had
never been strangers.</p>

<p>She prepared food for him, those dishes which she remembered
him liking as a child, and set before him a jug of her own
cowslip wine, heady as ale and scented of flowers. But she did
not sit with him at meat, nor did Darking; they waited on him
till he had finished, and then ate their meal.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed him hungrily, and now and then she would
stroke his sleeve with her old fingers.</p>

<p>"You are still the lad I nurtured," she said; "but you are
grown too mighty for this nest. I thought you were an eyas with
clipped wings that would never fly far from me. That was the hope
of Brother Tobias, too, but God has ordered it otherwise. Once
you favoured your mother, and I took it for a happy omen, but
now, childing, I see your sire in you. You have that kindly
sullenness in the eyes which men spoke of in his grace. Heaven
send you a happier fate." And she crossed herself and muttered a
prayer.</p>

<p>"How long?" she asked of Darking. "Not till St Martin's day?
You have come among your own folk, Peterkin, and we must make you
ready for your flight. You are safe among us, and maybe we can do
something ere that day to help your fortunes. You will soar out
of our ken, but we can make certain that, if your wings tire,
there is cover where you can clap down."</p>

<p>Darking took him to a hut in Wychwood in a patch of ashes
above St Cyther's well, which had been used sometimes to give a
night's shelter when the hunt was up in that quarter of the
forest. There they made their dwelling, and it was as lonely as a
hill-top, the new ranger not having yet taken up his office, and
every verderer and forester being under the spell of Darking's
strange authority. There Darking took Peter in hand and taught
him much not commonly known by those who have in their veins the
blood of kings. The boy was country bred, and started with some
equipment of wild lore, but presently he understood that he had
dwelt hitherto only in the porches of nature, and that he was now
being led into the inner chambers. "Have patience, my lord," said
his tutor. "Great folk live and move high above the common world.
But now and then they come to ground, and it is well to have a
notion of that ground where you must creep and cannot fly."</p>

<p>So Peter learned the ways of weather--what was portended by
rooks flying in line, and mallards roosting in the trees, and
herons leaving the streams for the forest pools. He learned to
read what haze signified at dawn and sunset, and to smell distant
rain. He was taught the call and cry of all the things that ran
and flew, to imitate a stoat's whistle and a badger's grunt, the
melancholy trumpet of the bittern, and the broken flageolet of
the redshank, the buzzard's mewing and the grey crow's scolding.
Presently he knew the mark of every pad in mud or herbage and the
claws that patterned the streamside shingle. Something he learned
too of the medicinal lore of the woods, how to make febrifuge and
salve, what herbs sweetened foul water, or quieted hunger, or put
a wakeful man to sleep. He was a ready pupil at this lore, for it
gave his mind something to work on in those weeks of idleness.
Also it seemed to marry the new strange world into which he was
entered with that old world he was forsaking. It was pleasant to
think that he, who might yet be a king, should go first to school
with the ancient simplicities of earth.</p>

<p>Darking gave him another kind of tutoring. He made him discard
the clothes he had worn, and put on the rough garb of a lesser
forester. And then, enjoining on him to hold his peace at all
costs, he took him far and wide through the neighbourhood. They
visited the fairs in the little towns and sat in alehouses
listening to the talk of peasants. They joined themselves to wool
convoys on the highroad, and attended the great wool markets in
Northleach and Burford and Campden. One day they would eat their
bread and cheese in a smithy, the next in a parson's kitchen, and
the third day in a cornfield with the harvesters at their noonday
rest. Darking seemed to have a passport to any society, some word
which set people at their ease and opened their mouths.</p>

<p>"You are school-bred and abbey-bred," he said. "It were well
that you should learn of the common folk on whose shoulders the
world rests. If you are to be Jack's master, it is time to know a
little of Jack."</p>

<p>Peter, with his memory full of pinched faces and furtive talk
of oppression, and eyes that spoke more eloquently than words,
shivered a little.</p>

<p>"What has become of merry England?" he asked. "It is a sad
world you have shown me, and a dark. Most men are groping and
suffering."</p>

<p>"There is small merriment nowadays," he was told, "save among
the gilded folk at the top, and those who have sunk deep down
into the coverts. But it is a world very ripe for change."</p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread favoured a different kind of preparation.
She was in her way a devout woman, but she believed in an
innocent magic outside the sanctities of the Church. Like all
peasants, she was a storehouse of traditional lore which had
descended from days long before Christ came to England. Her
special knowledge was of herbs and simples, some for medicines,
but most for spells, since there was a motley of vague beings to
be placated if one would live at ease. During Peter's childhood
she had practised many harmless rites on his behalf. She had
tried to foresee his future by fire and running water. The way of
it was that you flung a blazing wisp of straw into a stream at
midnight of a Thursday and repeated a benedicite and the rune
<i>"Fire burn, water run, grass grow, sea flow,"</i> and then
finished with a paternoster. But she had gained nothing that way
except a fit of ague. She had striven to ward off evil from her
charge by sticking a knife into a plant of helenium at sunrise on
Michaelmas Day, in the hope that the proper demon would appear,
whom at that hour and with such preparation she would have power
to command. But no spirit, good or bad, had made himself visible,
though the awaiting of him had been a business requiring all her
courage. But with her herbs she had been more fortunate. She had
mixed the juices of dill and vervain and St John's wort, and it
was to this application, accompanied by the appropriate words,
that she attributed Peter's notable freedom from childish
ailments.</p>

<p>Now she must go further, and the next step was for a true
initiate. There was a woman lived at Shipton-under-the-Forest,
Madge Littlemouse her name, who was reported to be learned in the
old wisdom, and yet whose doings had left her on the sheltered
side of the law and the Church. Indeed, there was no breath of
discredit against Madge; she never dried up the ewes or the kine
with the charm--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hare's milk and mare's milk,<br>
 And all the beasts that bears milk,<br>
 Come ye to me . . ."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>or brought pains and death to her neighbours with nigromantic
images, or fasted the Black Fast against her ill-wishers. She was
a meek-faced old woman, whose garden was full of bee-hives, and
to her bees she would talk as to a gossip. For certain, there was
no such honey as hers in all Cotswold; but there were those who
said that her bees were more than bees, that they were familiar
spirits. The miller of Chadlington had found her asleep one
summer noon, and had seen bees issuing from her mouth and ears,
so that, being then in liquor, he had been instantly sobered, and
had sworn off ale for a twelvemonth. But Madge's repute was not
hurt by this tale. Beyond doubt she had power, but her magic was
white and unhurtful--no trafficking with the horrid relics of
dead men and foul beasts, no blasphemous juggling with the sacred
chrism or the more sacred Host, but clean invocations to decent
spirits, who might reasonably be called good angels.</p>

<p>This potent ally Mother Sweetbread desired to enlist on
Peter's behalf, and she especially desired that Madge should make
him a ring, the possession of which would attach to him a
friendly guardian spirit. So she managed to obtain during Peter's
visits some oddments of his belongings--a lock of his hair, the
paring of a nail, a fragment of linen which had been worn next
his body--indispensable things without which Madge would be
helpless. The ring must be of silver, so for the purpose she
sacrificed a precious buckle, the gift of her old mistress: and
she offered Madge as her fee a gold noble out of her small
hoard.</p>

<p>She spoke to Darking of what she had done. He was not less
superstitious than she, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Remember what befell the lad's father," he said. "The
beginning of the lord duke's calamities was the prophecy that he
would be King. 'Twas one Nicholas, a Carthusian monk, that made
it. There are some things too high for mortal men to meddle
with."</p>

<p>"Nay, Solomon," she said. "I would not tempt God by such
meddling. But I would make him a ring such as the great Cardinal
had, which will assure his fortune and keep a good angel by his
side."</p>

<p>"What sort of angel had Wolsey?" Darking cried. "I have heard
of that ring. It brought a devil named Andrew Malchus to do his
will, and all men know the consequence."</p>

<p>"This shall be decently and piously made, with prayers and
paternosters," she pleaded.</p>

<p>But Darking still shook his head. "Many a man has sought to
secure a good spirit, and has found a fiend answer his call. I
like not this dabbling in forbidden things. But go your ways,
mother, for you are wiser than me. . . . I will tell you how you
can best benefit my lord. Get Goody Littlemouse to tell him where
treasure is hid and you will make his fortune secure. For, hark
you, mother, my lord has nothing now but his name and his birth.
He has no great estate to milk or vassals to arm; therefore he is
but a tool in the hands of those who seek his interest just in so
far as it serves their own. Give him his own privy purse, and, so
it be large enough, he will be able to carry his head high."</p>

<p>The old woman pondered the words, which had been spoken
lightly enough, and from a chance remark or two later it appeared
that she had taken counsel with Madge Littlemouse on the matter.
One day Peter and Darking were overtaken by a violent
thunderstorm which split a great oak before their eyes. Darking
laughed, as he wrung the wet from his cap. "Mother Sweetbread is
busy about treasure-trove and is raising foul weather."</p>

<p>But one night he talked for a long time apart with the old
woman.</p>

<p>"The hour of the summons is near," he said, "and soon the lad
will be out of our care. I have taught him where and how to find
refuge, if all else fails. Presently he will be set on a
pinnacle, but a pinnacle is poor footing, and he will be alone. I
am for showing him where to find allies, besides those great ones
who will companion him. . . . There will be a gathering soon of
them we know of. I saw Catti the Welshman yesterday on the
Burford road, and old John Naps was at the Rood Fair on Barton
Heath, and there is word of Pennyfarthing in the Cocking
dingle."</p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread opened her eyes wide. "You would not take my
lord into such company?"</p>

<p>"I would take my lord to any company that can strengthen his
hands. Listen, mother. England is all of a turmoil nowadays, and
no man knows which is the true road or who are his friends. There
is dispeace in the King's Court, and disorder in the Council, and
disquiet in Parliament, and everywhere divided minds. But far
down below there are those who know their own purposes and hang
together like a nest of wasps. I would take my lord to the only
part of England that is stable."</p>

<h1><a name="c05">CHAPTER V</a></h1>

<h1>THE PARLIAMENT OF BEGGARS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first frosts began with October, and after the hot
September suns the leaves yellowed fast and hung loose, waiting
for the Martinmas gales. One evening Darking and Peter left their
hut in Wychwood and took the road up Evenlode, while the forest
behind them was a riot of colour, and the waterside meadows lay
yellow as corn in the sunset. Both were shabbily dressed, Mother
Sweetbread having obtained for the boy a suit which her husband
had worn for twenty years at the winter woodcutting.</p>

<p>"You are my prentice for the nonce," said Darking, "and you
have no name save Solomon's Hob."</p>

<p>"Where are we bent?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"To Kingham Waste. There is a place in the heart of it called
Little Greece, where we shall meet with company. You must not
open your lips, but follow me and gape like a bumpkin."</p>

<p>"What company?"</p>

<p>"Strange company, my lord. I have told you that half England
has gone to ground. This night you will see some of those who
hold rule among the vagabonds. Little Greece is no common
bowsing-ken. All trades have their laws and disciplines, and not
less that which is the trade of idleness. You would think, maybe,
that the limping rogue you meet on the road obeyed no law but his
own desires and necessities. Yet you would be wrong. He is under
as strict rules as any soldier of an army. To-night you will see
some of his officers. Twice a year they meet to take counsel upon
matters that affect their living, and in this beggars' parliament
you will see the men who govern all the vagabondage between
Thames in the south and Severn in the west and Trent in the
north."</p>

<p>"Tell me of this strange world. I know nothing of it."</p>

<p>"You could not. They keep wide of the King's forests for the
most part, though I have known a batch of wild rogues raid the
deer. Nor will you find them often in the Oxford streets or the
lanes about Oseney. But elsewhere they are thicker than crows on
a March ploughland."</p>

<p>Peter asked the origin of so great a multitude.</p>

<p>"The poor we have always with us," Darking quoted. "There have
always been the unfortunates whose craft has failed them, or who
have come to odds with the King's laws, and find it convenient to
have no fixed habitation. But in the last fifty years there has
been a breaking up of England, so that honest fellows, with
generations behind them of laborious forbears, have not known
where to turn to for the next crust. Such are now on the roads.
Also the end of the wars both here and abroad has deprived many
soldiers of a trade. Then there are those who take willingly to
the life because of the restlessness of their bones or the
corruption of their hearts. Every year sees a fresh hatch-out.
The King's rabbling of the small religious houses has sent a new
swarm abroad, and trebled the number of patricoes. Lastly, there
are some who take the wallet for a deeper purpose at the bidding
of great men. You must know that every vagabond must have his
billet or licence duly signed and sealed, else he will be taken
and whipped at the next town-end. Such billets can be granted by
anyone in authority--justice, or knight, or noble, or
churchman--and what easier for a great one, who wishes to know
the truth of what is happening in England, than to equip his own
men with such licences and send them forth to glean tidings? The
device has not been practised by the King's Council, but some,
who like not the King, have used it freely. There are many of my
Lord Avelard's intelligencers abroad with the beggars."</p>

<p>"Tell me of these beggars," said Peter. "Are there several
kinds of them?"</p>

<p>"As many as there are kinds of fly hatched out in summer. They
have their own names, and their own manner of speech and way of
business, and if I were to recite them all I should not have done
by the morrow's dawn. There are those known by the misdeeds they
favour. Such are the rufflers and the rogues and the highwaymen,
who use violence, and the coney-catchers and cozeners and hookers
and horse-priggers and fraters who use guile. Some have their
trades, like the tinkers and pedlars, the jugglers and the
minstrels, the crowders and fortune-tellers and bearwards. Some
are plain beggars; others practise different arts to excite
compassion, as the palliards, who make sores on their bodies with
ratsbane and spearwort--the abrahams who sham madness, and the
cranks who counterfeit the falling sickness--the dommerers who
are deaf and dumb, and the whipjacks who tell a lamentable tale
of shipwreck at sea or have a father or brother made captive by
the Turk. There are more varieties of calling in vagabondage than
in honest trade, and more ranks and classes than at the King's
Court. And at the top of all are those whom they call the Upright
Men, that are their captains and justices. Them we shall meet at
Little Greece."</p>

<p>"But for what purpose?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"For many. These rogues have their ears very near the ground
and hear much which other men miss. They have knowledge which the
King's Council could not buy for gold. Also they are strong and
secret, and throng as a swarm of bees, and they cover all
England. If we win their favour they may come to your aid when
you are hard beset and your great friends are powerless."</p>

<p>"Why should they bear good-will to me?"</p>

<p>"They will know nothing of you. To them this night you will be
my servant, a gaping youth out of the forest. You will watch my
movements and follow them like a lackey, and for the Lord's sake
utter not one word, for your speech would betray you. A man's
life would not be worth a moment's purchase if he broke in
unwarranted on the Beggars' Parliament. In half an hour his
throat would be slit and he would be six foot deep under a farm
midden. For me, I have a name among them and certain credentials.
They will not harm me and may even do as I desire. But for you,
my lord, safety lies only in an owlish silence."</p>

<p>They were now traversing a flat moorish space where narrow
tracks ran through thickets of furze and blackthorn. Their goal
seemed to be near, for Darking instructed Peter in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"The captain of this parliament is one they call John Naps, an
old whipjack who is in some sort the owner of Little Greece. No
man gave him the title, but there is none who would dispute it
with him. He is an ancient merry villain, and a kind of king
among the vagabonds between Cotswold and Chiltern. . . . For the
rest I can tell you some who will be there. Mark well a little,
black-eyed, beetle-browed ruffian with a long knife at his belt.
That is him they call Catti the Welshman, whose special business
is to rob travellers who go from Thames to Severn. He bears a
woman's name, but he is not womanish. None knows so well every
road and track and horse-path in south England. . . . There will
be a fat man whose jaws never stop munching so that he seems to
be chewing the cud like kine. That will be Timothy
Penny-farthing, otherwise True Timothy, who is master of the
palliards, that make their bodies foul with sores and cry their
ailments at every doorstep. He is a longheaded rogue with a
shrewd judgment, and, except in his trade, a certain honesty. . .
. Likewise, there will be Henry Hooker, chief of them that thieve
with a crooked stick and prig the goodman's shirt out of an open
window. He has special authority Warwick and Northampton way. . .
. Flatsole will be there beyond doubt--a lean man with a poxed
face and eyes of different colours. He is a horse-thief to trade,
and knows every fair and feast and market south of Trent. Do not
engage him in sword-play, my lord, for Flatsole has been a
soldier, and no court gallant can match him at the cut-and-thrust
business. The rogue is well-mannered, too, for he is the by-blow
of some noble house. . . . Also, you will meet one Pierce the
Piper, who travels farther afield than the rest, for he has
carried his cow's bladder benorth of Tweed among the wild Scots
and west of Severn among the wild Welsh. He is a scholar of a
sort--some say of Balliol College--and when he is well drunk, can
make music to wring a man's heart. . . . None of the
raggle-taggle following will be there, and the doxies will be
left behind, for this is a high occasion for the rogues, and they
are as solemn about it as a mayor and aldermen. . . . Walk warily
now, for we are nearing their sentinels."</p>

<p>A pole was suddenly thrust from the covert athwart Darking's
breast, and he stopped in his tracks. A voice said something in
what seemed to Peter a strange tongue, and Darking replied with
like gibberish. The pole was withdrawn, and from the thicket came
words which seemed to be a direction.</p>

<p>They were now in what was little better than a maze. High
walls of furze and bramble and hazel, matted with wild clematis,
stood up on each hand, and the path was no wider than a rabbit
track. Also it twined and zigzagged and split into baffling
sideways, so that more than once Darking hesitated. A second pole
across his chest and another colloquy in jargon gave him the
clue, and after a little the path widened, and the jungle was
varied with patches of heath and now and then a tall tree. The
moon had risen, and instead of a green dusk there was now an
alternation of silver spears and inky shadows.</p>

<p>Three times more the travellers were brought to a halt and a
password exchanged. The last time the sentinel himself emerged
from the scrub--a slim boy whom Peter at first took for a girl.
He made a sign by drawing his forefinger down the right side of
his nose and then cupping his right ear, and Darking replied with
a gesture which seemed to satisfy him. The boy looked sharply at
Peter, and Darking explained his presence in words not one of
which Peter understood. Then the boy preceded them and led the
way to a space where the thicket ceased altogether. There was a
paddock with several horses at graze and several more tethered to
the paling; there was a slender stream issuing from a broad pool
which was indeed one of the springs of Evenlode; there was a
grove of tall ashes and oaks, and in the midst of it the dark
loom of a dwelling. No light showed, but as they rounded the end
of it the sound of human speech came from within. The place
seemed once to have been the tithe-barn of a manor, for fallen
stones and broken walls showed all around. At the door stood two
sentinels, tall men in beggars' rags, each with a curtal-axe held
at guard.</p>

<p>Here again there was a halt and a parley. The boy who had
guided them spoke in whispers with the sentries, and then entered
the barn, diving beneath a thick curtain. He was absent for a
minute or two, and when he returned he seemed to look at Darking
with a new respect. He said something in his queer jargon.</p>

<p>"They have finished their council," Darking whispered to
Peter, "and are about to feed. We are bidden to the banquet."</p>

<p>The boy raised the flap of the frieze curtain and they entered
the barn. The place was dimly lit, smoky and very hot, for a fire
had been made on the stone floor, and there were no windows
except the vent in the roof. At the far end a covered lantern had
a pedestal formed of two barrels on end, and another stood on a
table on the near side of the fire, a table which appeared to be
loaded with dishes and flagons. Ten men sat round the fire,
sprawling on straw-stuffed cushions, their legs outstretched to
the blaze. Each of them had a platter and a mug, and two ancient
crones were acting as servitors, carrying food and drink from the
table to the feasters.</p>

<p>Peter was sharp-set with his long walk in the chill evening,
and his eye went first to the laden table. Never had he seen such
a riot of coarse dainties. There were great dishes of tripe and
cow-heel. One earthenware platter was loaded with pig-food,
another with white and black puddings, while a third bore a
gigantic haggis. A mighty copper kettle was full of a broth which
from its odour had been made of various sorts of game, while
another bubbled with hasty pudding. But the chief dish was a huge
pie which contained the mortal remains of one of the King's deer.
There was a plate of pippins to give refinement to the feast, and
one of almonds and raisins. The drink was ale in blackjacks, no
thin and common brew, but strong October, heady and ripe and dark
as bog water. The ancient women hobbled between the table and the
circle, replenishing platters and mugs, for the company seemed to
have been starved for months, so resolutely did they set about
the duty of feeding.</p>

<p>Suspicion woke in the eyes of several as the two strangers
entered, but a deep voice beyond the fire bade them welcome. It
came from a little old man, who in spite of the heat of the barn
wore a cloak; since, unlike the rest, he squatted instead of
sprawled, he looked like a broody hen. He had a ragged white
beard, and white hair which fell on each side of lean mahogany
cheeks. His nose was long and his weak eyes seemed to be always
weeping, but there was comedy at the corners of his mouth. The
voice was magnificent--rich, fruity, sentimental, cajoling,
capable of an infinity of gross humour and grosser pathos.</p>

<p>Peter looked with interest at the captain of the vagabonds of
the south. John Naps, who at the first sight seemed only comic,
improved at the second. The man had a magisterial eye, and in his
voice was that complete self-confidence which is the best
endowment for a leader. He cried out a welcome to Darking with
his mouth full of pasty, but his jargon was beyond Peter's
comprehension. He made room for him at his right hand, and Peter
sat modestly behind, where he was served presently with broth and
ale.</p>

<p>There were ten men at meat, but only nine in the circle, for
one sat apart out of the glare of the fire. Peter, as he
satisfied his hunger, let his eye rove among his neighbours. Some
he made out at once from Darking's description. . . . There was
True Timothy, the king of the palliards, a vast browsing figure,
whose paunch stuck out beyond the others like a flying buttress.
Timothy was very serious about the business of eating, and
gobbets of pasty were shovelled into his cavernous mouth as fuel
goes into a furnace. . . . No doubt either about Catti the
highway robber. The Welshman was as Darking had said, small,
swarthy, beetle-browed, and the haft of his long whinger, as he
sat, was almost at his chin. Yet it was not a face to inspire
fear, for, as it lifted and Peter could see the mouth and eyes,
there seemed something elfin and mirthful in it. He remembered
tales of this Catti, which had penetrated to Oxford taverns--how
he robbed especially rich men and usurers and the King's
servants, but spared the Church and the poor--a shabby Robin Hood
with, instead of the greenwood humour, something of the wildness
and magnanimity of his own hills. . . . Flatsole, too, he made
out, from his meagreness and pitted cheeks. The horse-thief did
not sprawl but sat lightly, as if ready to spring to his feet at
a word of danger. The face was turned from Peter, so he could not
see the twy-coloured eyes. A by-blow of some noble house, Darking
had said; and for certain there seemed to be breeding in the slim
neck and the graceful poise of his head. The man had swordsman
written in every line of him.</p>

<p>But the one that held Peter's eyes was he who sat outside the
circle. This must be the piper Pierce, for, though his pipes were
not there, a rude boxwood fiddle lay over his knees. He appeared
to have no appetite for food, for a wedge of pie lay untouched
beside him, but his tankard was constantly being replenished. The
rest of the company had sober garments, like those of a small
farmer on market day, but Pierce wore a jerkin of faded red and
blue, and atop of his shock of black hair was set a damaged hat
of black felt bound with a riband of the same colours. The hair
fell over his brow and almost hid his deep-set eyes. His cheeks
were shrunken and Isabella-coloured, he had no beard, and his
lips were perpetually parted in something between a pout and a
sneer. Peter remembered that, according to Darking, thus man had
once been a scholar, and decided that he looked more like a
warlock.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pierce lifted his fiddle and began to play,
accompanying the music with a voice of a curious softness and
power. The crackle of the fire and the steady munching of human
jaws seemed to hush as the clear notes mounted the air.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Peter sat at Heaven's gate<br>
 Beeking in the sun,<br>
 While the souls came up the stair<br>
 Limping every one,<br>
 Like the weary homing rooks<br>
 When the day is done."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The ballad went on to tell how kings and nobles and bishops
and mitred abbots presented themselves and got but a dusty answer
from the Keeper of the Gate, but how when the beggarman appeared
he was welcomed as a boon companion. It was the kind of ribald
song popular at a time when men had lost much of their awe of the
divine mysteries. He followed it with a piece of naked
uncleanness, which won much applause, and then--with a startling
suddenness--broke into a sad old catch with an air like a
wandering wind and the patter of raindrops.</p>

<p>"Godsnigs, Pierce," John Naps commanded, "put more mirth into
your music. That tune gripes one like sour ale, till I feel the
cart moving beneath me and the rope at my weasand."</p>

<p>The piper obeyed and broke into a song, of which everyone took
up the chorus.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When is the time to drink with a friend?<br>
 When is it meetest thy money to spend?<br>
 O now, now, now.<br>
 O now, now, now.</p>

<p>"When should a man fill his belly with meat,<br>
 Cool his hot throat and anoint his sore feet?<br>
 <i>O now, now, now.</i></p>

<p>"When are most honied the lips of a lass?<br>
 When tastes the sweetest the foam on the glass?<br>
 <i>O now, now, now."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>There were a dozen verses or more, and the revellers swelled
the chorus <i>O now, now, now</i> like a kennel of full-throated
hounds.</p>

<p>Then came toasts, mostly in the beggars' patois, at which
tankards were emptied and refilled. The company, heads of oak all
of them, seemed to get no drunker in spite of their potations.
But jollity increased and suspicion departed, till Peter found
himself meeting the gaze of others and exchanging friendly grins.
His body was far from comfortable, for he was not accustomed to
squatting or lolling, and the heat of the fire and the heavy
flavour of food and ale had made the place like a limekiln. Soon
he felt he must drop off to sleep. But suddenly he was shaken
into wakefulness by a hush in the babble of tongues. Darking was
speaking and every face was turned to him.</p>

<p>Solomon was not using the beggars' jargon, and he treated that
odd gathering as if it were the most dignified assembly in the
land. He was honoured, he said, with the right of entry to the
councils of the Upright Men. He had missed the consultation of
that evening, when doubtless matters of great import had been
decided, but he craved permission to bring them again into
council. No doubt after a feast the wits of most men were slow,
but this company was different, for with such seasoned vessels
the malt was never above the meat.</p>

<p>Permission was granted by general assent, for Darking seemed
to be in favour with these kings of vagabondage. Even True
Timothy propped himself on a bulky elbow to listen.</p>

<p>"I have often come to you for counsel, my masters," Darking
said, "and sometimes I have given it to you. We have been
benefactors to each other, I think. Tonight I have something to
give you and something to ask from you. You, whose life passes
like a shuttle through England, can tell better than any other
the maladies of the land. How is it with England today? What says
the lord of Little Greece?"</p>

<p>Old Naps shook his head. "Badly. We touched on that matter at
our consult. The skies are darkening, and presently a thunderbolt
may fall. Let Master Flatsole speak, and after him Master Pierce,
for they go farthest afield."</p>

<p>He spoke no longer in jargon, nor did Flatsole. The latter set
down his mug, stiffened his back, and in a slow crooning voice
testified to things which drove from Peter's head every atom of
drowsiness. . . . The King's levies were proving more burdensome,
and in all the land there was discontent. The new rich were
becoming richer and the poor poorer. He who had been a squire
with ten free tenants was now himself a tenant on other men's
lands, hard put to it to snatch a living. He who had been a free
farmer, with two yokes of plough oxen, a good horse, a dairy cow
and a score of sheep, was now a labourer for daily hire. And he
who had been a labourer was now on the roads--or dead of hunger.
. . . The land was full of men broken in the wars, and trained to
arms. There were concealed weapons everywhere. . . . None loved
the King, save his pensioners, and the plain man groaned to see
his substance wasted on royal harlots and jacks-in-office.</p>

<p>"As for us of old England," he said, "we like not the Welshman
nor his ways. He is making our trade too throng for a man's
comfort. And now he is laying hands on God's houses, and soon
there will be a horde of abbey-lubbers and unfrocked priests to
cumber the roads and milk the charitable."</p>

<p>"What of the abbeys?" Darking asked. "Will the people at large
approve the King's doing, or will fear of Hell and hope of Heaven
set them in a ferment?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to say," was the answer. "Most men to-day think of
their next meal before their hopes of Heaven, and their bellies
before their souls. Holy water will not wash a foul shirt clean.
But beyond question the devout are perturbed, and it would take
little to bring them into the streets with staves and pikes. I
have heard of a stirring Lincolnshire way, and Pierce will tell
you that a very little spark would fire the northern moors. But I
have been in too many wars to set much store by what the
commonalty alone can do. There are plenty of foot-sentinels, but
'tis the captain that matters."</p>

<p>"Ay," said John Naps, "'tis the captains. What say the great
folk, good sir? The poor knave whose back is broke with beating
hemp has no guts in him to strike the first blow, but he may lay
shrewdly about him if he find a trusty leader."</p>

<p>"Granted such a leader," Darking asked, "with what cry could
he raise England?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Each man seemed to be puzzling over the
question. "The safety of the Church?"</p>

<p>"'I faith, no. The Church has bled 'em too hard and has
stirred up too many grudges. Here and there a pious soul might
risk his neck for his salvation, but most would leave the
business to the churchmen. It is not Christ that is in jeopardy,
but his holiness of Rome and a score or two of plump abbots."</p>

<p>"The redress of wrongs?"</p>

<p>"Ay. There you have a cock would fight. Let some great one
offer to ease the burdens on the poor and hang the rich who
oppress them, and the trumpet would sound from Devon to
Berwick."</p>

<p>"And the great one--who would be such a leader? My lord of
Exeter?"</p>

<p>Catti the highwayman spat vehemently and his eyes blazed. "I'd
liefer slit his weasand than follow him," he growled.</p>

<p>"Talk to Saint Peter of cockerels but not to friend Catti of
that lording," said Naps. "He once suffered lamentably from his
justice."</p>

<p>Darking ran over other noble names, and all were received with
doubt or disfavour.</p>

<p>"None will fight," said Flatsole, "to make Neville or Percy
King save their own men. If you are to oust the whoreson Welshman
you must have a prince indeed, and one of the old blood, for the
English have long memories."</p>

<p>"Such an one as Buckingham was?"</p>

<p>Flatsole considered. "Ay, such an one as Buckingham, for he
was of the ancient kings, and had the bearing that the plain man
loves."</p>

<p>"If such an one appeared--of Buckingham's house and kindred,
say--and with Buckingham's art to charm the people--and bade men
follow him that merry England might come again--would he succeed,
think ye?"</p>

<p>"Yea. 'Tis a salmon to a gudgeon that the Welshman goes."</p>

<p>Pierce broke in, having hitherto not opened his mouth except
in song. He spoke as he sang, in a voice so soothing to the ear
that it compelled attention. Unlike the others, he said, he had
no terrestrial bounds, not even south England, to limit him. He
had penetrated beyond Severn and threaded his way among the green
foothills of Clun and Wye into the stony Welsh vales till he had
looked from the Dyfi mouth on the Atlantic. He had been in the
north among the great seas of heather that lined the track for
days and days, and had talked with their hard, heather-bred folk.
He had been in the south-west among the tin-miners of Cornwall
and the rich Devon pastures, and round the coast from the Dorset
dunes to the Kent chalk-cliffs and the Essex marshes and the
sea-meres of Norfolk. And inland he had carried his pipes and his
fiddle from the Malvern hills to the Cambridge fens, and from the
Hampshire wolds to the fat meadows of Trent and the dark glens of
Derwent. For the great he could not speak, though he had made
music in castle halls, but he could tell of a thousand taverns
and hamlets and granges where his playing had enlivened the
cheesecakes of the simple.</p>

<p>"It is a dim land nowadays," he said. "The blanket of the dark
lies heavy on it." (Peter started at the phrase.) "But there is
an uneasy stirring, and that stirring may soon be an upheaval
that will shake down crowns and mitres. There is a new world
coming to birth, good sirs, though men know it not and crave
rather to have an older world restored."</p>

<p>"That is truth," said Flatsole, "as I can bear witness. Only a
leader is wanted."</p>

<p>"Ay, but what leader?" the piper asked in his soft far-away
voice. "If it is a great one he will only lead the nobles against
the King, or some of the nobles against others. Who will lead the
people against both?"</p>

<p>"I care for none of your new worlds," said Naps. "We of the
road want the old world with its wealth of cakes and ale, and we
are for anyone that will give it back to us."</p>

<p>Peter, at Darking's shoulder, looked round the circle where
the faces had become dimmer as the fire declined. It was hard to
believe that this was a gathering of the kings of wastreldom.
Each face, on which time and hard living had written curious
tales, seemed to be sunk in musing. No doubt it was only the
effect of October ale, but it looked like profound meditation.
Darking was speaking. "If such a thing should come, and a prince
of the old blood should appear with a strong following to ease
the people of their discontents, could he reckon on your
support?"</p>

<p>Naps replied for the others. "If you vouch for him, Master
Solomon, we are his men. That is, up to our capacities. We are
not an army, though we have fighting men among us, and we are
poor folk, though now and then we can sup like gentles."</p>

<p>"I ask no more," said Darking. "But such an one might well
call for help from those who know our England to the roots and
who have their folk in every square mile of the land. What token
can he give so that such help will be forthcoming?"</p>

<p>The old man's face took on a sudden shrewdness.</p>

<p>"Is such a business in train?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. And I would make all things ready against the
hour."</p>

<p>"'Tis well. You know yourself the pass-words of our different
orders. But I will give you a master-word and I will warn the
troops so that, on its presentation, every wayfaring man in
England is bound to honour it, though it put his neck in a
halter. Are we secret here, think you? Who is he that sits at
your back?" And he looked hard at Peter.</p>

<p>"A forest lad in my service," was the answer. "I brought him
with me because it was more convenient than to leave him behind.
He is thick as an oak-log," and he tapped his forehead.</p>

<p>Old Naps considered.</p>

<p>"Hearken, sirs," he cried. "The master-word I appoint is this.
The question will be asked, 'How far is it to the skirts of
Wychwood?' The answer will be, 'As far as to Peter's Gate.' Upon
which says the questioner, halting between each
word--'Alack--I--shall--not--be--there--in--time.' Whoever hears
such question and reply, must put his all at the disposal of him
who asks it. Let that go out to the troops as my command. . . .
Another jug of ale, gammer, for I am dry with talk, and do you,
Pierce, give us a stave."</p>

<p>The tankards beside the dying fire were refilled and the
fiddle woke. But it was no drinking song that came from it, but
an air as slow and solemn as a Gregorian chant. The words seemed
to be a comment on the piper's last speech, and, in that place of
strange faces and crooked shadows, they sounded as ominous as the
owl's complaint before a stormy dawn.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Worm at my heart and fever in my head--<br>
 There is no peace for any but the dead.<br>
 Only the dead are beautiful and free.<br>
 <i>Mortis cupiditas captavit me."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>John Naps flung an empty ale-pot at his head.</p>

<p>"God's curse on your snivelling, Pierce," he cried. "Give us
<i>Kind Heart</i> or <i>Banbury Bobby</i>--summat to warm our
blood."</p>

<h1>IN WHICH PETER EMERGES INTO THE LIGHT</h1>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">I</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Cotswold lay asleep in the October afternoon under a haze like
the bloom on a plum. Long before the western rim of the uplands
was reached Peter and Darking had entered the pale of Avelard.
Its stone walls began before they passed the upper waters of Coln
and came out on the high bleak tableland where all the
tributaries of the young Thames have their source. It was now a
country of pasture, with the short sweet bite for sheep, but here
and there rank patches showed where there had once been
ploughlands. There were no hamlets or farms, only shepherds'
cabins, and the ruins of former habitations from which the walls
of the pastures had been built. The sheep were small and shaggy
to Peter's eye, accustomed to the heavier animals of the
lowlands; the shepherds were wild-looking folk, with their
swathes of rags for footgear and their long hazel crooks, and the
dogs were savage and noisy.</p>

<p>"These are my lord's flocks," said Darking. "He has been a
great pasture-maker, and most of his wealth comes from these
dirty hides."</p>

<p>But at the scarp the pasture ceased, for the land fell not in
gentle shallow vales as on the east, but in a declivity of a
thousand feet to the huge hollow of a river. The slope was a wild
park, full of fern and furze and seedling thorns, with here and
there clumps of scrub oak and holly and hazel. In places there
were acres of greensward among the bracken.</p>

<p>"See there," said Darking, pointing to one of the clearings.
"This has not long been forest land. A dozen crofts were
sacrificed to make my lord's park."</p>

<p>But Peter was not listening, for the breath was taken from him
by the vast prospect, the widest he had ever beheld, since the
western scarp of Cotswold was the highest ground which his feet
had yet trod. The slope ended far below in a champaign of meadow
and woodland, but mainly woodland. A wide river looped itself
through the plain, and on its banks he saw the walls of more than
one town, and the spire of a great church. Beyond he could see
foothills, for in the Severn valley the upland haze had gone, and
the western skies were darkening for rain. And far away, a
spectral blue against the rain-clouds, loomed a field of black
mountains, higher than anything that the lowland-bred Peter had
dreamed of, menacing and yet inviting with their promise of
unknown worlds.</p>

<p>"The hills of Wales," said Darking, with a jerk of his head.
"Ill neighbours for peaceable folk."</p>

<p>Half-way to the valley below, and a little to the right, was a
broad shelf of ground, partly terraced with gardens. In the midst
rose a great house, clearly new, for the yellow Cotswold
limestone was not yet grey with lichen and weather. It was built
in the form of a double L, and from where they stood above it
could be seen the green of the lawns enclosed in the half
quadrangles. To Peter it seemed more immense than any dwelling he
had seen--far bigger than Stanton or Woodstock or Ewelme, greater
than any college except the unfinished Cardinal. His heart beat
faster, for he knew what it was without Darking's words.</p>

<p>"That is the castle of Avelard. It is also new built, save for
the keep on the left, which in its time stood many sieges in the
Barons' Wars and from the wild Welsh. Now my lord is rich and
peaceful, and he has built him a house without defences. Let us
make haste before the storm breaks."</p>

<p>There was a postern gate in a battlemented wall abutting on
the hill. The travellers had been seen, for a serving-man awaited
them there. Darking spoke aside to Peter.</p>

<p>"Here I leave you, my lord. God prosper you in your venture.
Remember that you have a bodyguard in the forest. You have but to
speak the word old John Naps taught you to command their aid.
That way, too, you can send me a message if you have need of
me."</p>

<p>Peter wrung his hand. The kindness in the sombre face brought
tears to the boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Your goodness is beyond my gratitude," he stammered. "What
have I done to merit it?"</p>

<p>"I was your father's man," was the answer. "In old days there
was never a Bohun rode to the wars but a Darking ran by his
stirrup."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Solomon slipped into the thicket after he had given Peter's
satchel into the servant's hands. The man bowed low and led the
way through the postern. Peter found himself in a demesne
enclosed from the wild park, a place of wide lawns set with
clumps of foreign bushes. Then came a sunken garden running the
whole length of the terrace--a pleasance still in the making, for
the containing walls showed recent marks of the chisel, and the
long pool in the centre was empty of water and its bottom
littered with heaps of quicklime. Two fountains were spouting,
one of white marble shaped like a pyramid, on the apex of which
sat a marble bird, and one a cluster of sea nymphs around
Neptune. Here there were trim walks of grass, and fantastic plots
of withered flowers. A marble staircase led to the terrace, a
quarter-mile of sward a little browned with the September
drought, edged by a parapet of blue Forest stone. Above it rose
the southern fa&ccedil;ade of the house, all a dazzle of high
square-headed windows surmounted by cornices moulded in the
Italian manner, but ending far up in Gothic gables. In the centre
was a great porch set with columns and capitals of the Tuscan
order, and carrying a shield carved in deep relief with the lion
rampant of Avelard.</p>

<p>A tall grave man was waiting in the porch. He bowed low.</p>

<p>"My lord has not yet returned," he said, "but all is ready for
your lordship's reception."</p>

<p>He led Peter into a hall, the height of two storeys of the
house, with a gilt and painted plaster ceiling of dolphins and
gorgons and the Avelard lion. It was panelled half-way up with
small squares of oak, new and not yet darkened by smoke, and the
immense chimney of white stone looked like a work of yesterday.
Peter stared in bewilderment, his eyes running from the sober
hangings of black and gold velvet to the rich hues of the
plaster, the brilliance of a Spanish foot-cloth below the central
table, the silver sconces and the great carved silver chandelier,
the huge buffet laden with silver and gold plate, the Avelard
lion, sable on or, ramping above the fireplace, set between two
mighty alicorns. He had not believed that such magnificence dwelt
even in kings' palaces.</p>

<p>The yeoman of the hall handed him over deferentially to the
yeoman of the chambers. Behind screens of Spanish leather they
entered a lesser hall, whence rose a broad staircase of oak on
the newels of which sat the Avelard lion. On the first floor he
passed through a narrow gallery full of pictures into the Great
Chamber, hung with Flemish tapestry, where stood a state bed of
scarlet and sky-blue, and a raised chair of state under a silk
canopy, cabinets of ivory and tortoiseshell and ebony, stools
covered with velvet and embroidered fustian, and a medley of
musical instruments, including one of the new upright spinets,
called a clavicytherium, which Peter had heard of but had never
seen. From this he passed to a nest of lesser chambers, in one of
which a wood-fire burned on the hearth. It was a bedroom, for
there was a great bed with Ionic pilasters and brocaded valance
and curtains. Here a groom awaited him.</p>

<p>"Your lordship will bathe before he sups?"</p>

<p>Peter assented, with his head in utter confusion. He suffered
himself to be undressed, and bathed in a tub with a curtain-like
covering. The water was perfumed and warm. Then he was clothed in
a new suit, the like of which he had never seen--a shirt of
delicate white silk, a doublet of purple velvet slashed with
yellow satin, and a surcoat of heavy silk lined with marten's
fur. His trunk hose were of silk, and on his feet were soft
fur-lined slippers of cherry velvet. This done, he passed into
the adjoining room, which was fitted up as a winter parlour.
There he found a table covered with fine linen, and two grooms
waiting to serve his meal. He had not broken bread since the
morning, and, in spite of his bewilderment, fell to with a will.
The grave man who had first received him again made his
appearance.</p>

<p>"My lord has not yet returned," he said. "Meantime we wait
your lordship's commands."</p>

<p>Peter made his supper off sausage served with a sauce of
almond milk, an omelette of eggs and chopped herbs, a slice of a
venison pasty, and a tart made from warden pears. He was offered
a variety of wines, white and red, but chose the mild beer made
bitter by hops which was just come into England. This he drank
from a tankard fashioned in the shape of an Avelard lion, in the
bottom of which was set a piece of unicorn's horn. When he rose
from meat he drew back the curtains and looked out. The night had
fallen dark and wet, with a howling wind.</p>

<p>Again the old usher appeared.</p>

<p>"My lord still tarries. Maybe he is storm-stayed and will stay
the night at his house of Minster Carteron. Has your lordship any
commands?"</p>

<p>"I am weary," said Peter. "I go to bed." He had risen two
hours before sunrise.</p>

<p>A groom undressed him and put on him a nightgown of quilted
satin lined with ermine. There was a table beside the bed with
spiced wine in a gold posset-dish and a silver lamp burning
scented oil. The air in the room was as heavy as that of a chapel
at high mass. As soon as the man had withdrawn Peter pulled back
the curtains, opened one of the lattices and let in a breath of
the soft western wind. Then he turned the lamp low, for he felt
that a night light would be a comfort in this strange place. He
flung from him his night-robe, and dived between the cool cambric
sheets, which to his naked body were as grateful as spring water.
Such a bed he had never known, for he seemed to sink deep in down
and yet float on air. The sheets were as fine as silk, and the
Chalons blankets as soft as fur--far different from the rude
Witney fabric which had hitherto been his only covering. The
strangeness and the luxury, maybe too the rich supper and the
posset, sent him forthwith to sleep.</p>

<p>Presently he awoke. The wind had freshened and the open
lattice rattled noisily. He came back slowly to consciousness and
struggled for a little to discover his whereabouts. He had been
dreaming, and had thought that he was in Wychwood, crawling
through a covert which grew thicker with every yard and pressed
down on him from above. He tossed the blankets from him, and
stuck his legs out of bed, where a cold draught from the window
brought him to his bearings. The lamp was flickering in the wind,
so he shut the lattice, and as he did so he noticed his right
hand in the light, the middle finger of which wore a broad silver
ring. That had been Mother Sweetbread's gift, the work of the
wise woman at Shipton-under-the-Forest. It was the talisman which
was to bring him safety and fortune on his new road. The sight of
it cheered him in the midst of this unfamiliar magnificence, for
it seemed to him a link with his old world.</p>

<p>Then, above the riot of the gale, he heard music. It came not
from without, but from somewhere within the house, for when he
opened the lattice again he did not hear it. He sat on the edge
of the bed straining his ears. The thing was fitful like a wind,
now dying away, now rising into a perceptible air. He believed
that it came from the Great Chamber, and that someone was playing
on the clavicytherium. Had Lord Avelard returned and brought
company?</p>

<p>Whoever played accompanied the music with the voice. For an
instant the melody came strong and full, and he could almost
catch the words. A girl was singing, and by some strange wizardry
the voice was familiar. The sound of it brought pictures before
his eyes--the summer midnight and the dancer on the Painted
Floor--an August afternoon in Stowood, and the white girl who had
called him cousin and offered her cheek to kiss. . . . Then the
music ceased and the only sounds were the night wind without and
the hoot of an owl.</p>

<p>He breathed freely now, for ever since he arrived he had had
the sense of walking in a stifling dream. Out there in the
darkness was the world he knew, the world of simplicity and bare
living and old silent things. A mile or less distant, in the
straw of a cowshed or in a dell of the woods, were men who, when
he spoke the word, would do his bidding. He had felt
imprisoned--but only a sheet of glass separated him from the most
ancient freedom. . . . Meantime, this magnificence was his; he
was born to it; he commanded servants; soon he might command all
England; and there was a girl with a linnet's voice waiting for
him to set a crown upon her head.</p>

<p>He snuggled again into the sheets. "I am Bohun," he told
himself. "I am even now in God's sight a duke, and soon I may be
a king."</p>

<p>But he did not sleep, for the music had been resumed, nearer
it seemed, perhaps in the next room. This time the voice of the
singer had lost the note of a wild bird. It was seductive music,
languorous, rousing strange tremors in his body. It seemed to
invite to new and lawless delights. . . . Peter shivered, for he
knew that whoever sang was calling him, was awaiting him. They
two were alone in that great dark house. He had a moment of wild
exultation, succeeded by sheer terror. He was being tempted, and
was in the mood to yield. . . . He buried his head under the
clothes and said a prayer. When he uncovered his ears the music
had stopped, and to his horror he found himself longing for it to
begin again.</p>

<p>When he was wakened by a lackey, who drew the curtains and
proffered a morning draught in a gold cup, Peter found himself in
a new mood of pride and expectancy. He had forgotten his
scruples. This fantastic world into which he had fallen was full
of strange delights, and, if some were unlawful, the deeper their
witchery. "I am Bohun," he repeated. "I must assuredly remember
that, if I am to keep my back stiff in this palace."</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">II</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Lord Avelard had returned and received Peter in a little room
which opened from the Great Chamber. He was dressed as ever in
plain black and silver, and he sniffed a gold pomander, for
October was the month when men feared the plague. His lined waxen
face and the dark pouches beneath his eyes gave him in the cruel
morning light an air of immense age, but the eyes themselves were
keen as a hawk's, and there was none of the impotence of senility
in his delicate stubborn jaw. He took the boy's hands in his.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Avelard," he said. "You are master here, and my
servants will do your bidding as they would my own. But your rank
and name must still be secret. You are a kinsman from the west
country whom I would make my heir, and I have seen to it that
whatever is needed for that station has been forthcoming. Here
you will stay till the times are ripe, and I think that the days
of waiting will pass pleasantly. I am too old to be a fit
companion for youth, but there are those here who will better
suit your age. Young Messynger will arrive to-morrow, and my dead
wife's niece, Mistress Beauforest, will provide the graces. She
is niece too to Sir Ralph Bonamy whom you know. . . . Meantime, I
have news for you. Yesterday morning there came a post out of
Lincolnshire. The commons are up in the eastern shires and the
King's agents are hanging like crabs on every wayside tree. The
church bells are ringing, and the priests are on the march, and
ten thousand men are moving on Lincoln under the banner of the
five wounds of Christ."</p>

<p>The voice in which he spoke had no fervour in it, but rather a
cool irony, and his waxen cheek puckered in a smile.</p>

<p>"All goes as I foresaw," he said. "Soon the trouble will
spread north beyond Trent and fire the Yorkshire dales. I learn
that the King is hurrying every man he can muster to this peasant
war. Suffolk has clomb into the saddle, and Norfolk is on the
road, and Beauchamp and Russell and Fitzwilliam. Presently there
will not be a stand of arms left in the Tower of London, or a
vassal of the King's lords who is not tramping Lincolnshire mud.
The King purposes to use the eastern shires as he used Wales,
when five thousand rebels decked the gibbets. I have not been
slack in my loyalty," and again the smile flickered, "for a troop
of my Gloucester lads is on the way to join my lord of
Shrewsbury. Crummle will have no word to speak against the name
of Avelard. I shall have a letter from the Welshman commending
his affectionate cousin. And in the meantime . . ."</p>

<p>He broke off and his eyes seemed to burn into Peter's soul,
while every line of the old face spoke of a consuming
passion.</p>

<p>"Meantime," he went on, "behind the cover of this eastern
revolt our preparations ripen. When the King is embroiled deep
with priests and commons, we of the old houses will strike. It is
time to let you deeper into our plans, for they touch you nearest
of all. When we take the field our banner will not be any monkish
device, but the silver knot of Stafford and the swan of
Bohun."</p>

<p>He spread some papers on a table. Shire by shire, demesne by
demesne, he took Peter through the details of the rising. This
lord was good for so many mounted men, this squire for so many
footmen. Peter found himself enthralled by the vision of great
numbers waiting under arms from the Cumberland lakes to the Devon
moors till the word was given, and then moving like a river fed
by many streams towards London and victory. His cause was strong,
it seemed, along all the western shires of England, with outposts
in the midlands and the south. They lay on the flank of the royal
army, and the farther that army was beguiled north of Trent the
more deadly their blow. . . . There were the Welsh, too, twenty
thousand of the mountaineers, who would fight for a mercenary's
wage, but with something more than a mercenary's fury, since they
had a long tale of wrongs to avenge. . . . They passed to minute
computations of armament, wagons, horses and supplies. Wales
would furnish a reserve of horses, and at various key-points
provisions had been long accumulating. Serpents and culverins
were making in the Dean forest.</p>

<p>"Who will command?" Peter asked, and was told himself. "Only a
son of Buckingham can keep such a concourse to its purpose. Never
fear. You shall have skilled marshals to assist you. We do not
look for the arts of war in one clerkly bred. There are with us
many old captains of the French and Scottish wars--men accustomed
to order a battle--no mere carpet-knights and jousters like the
King."</p>

<p>Peter asked one last question. Whence came the funds for this
great venture? Lord Avelard smiled wryly.</p>

<p>"You have set your finger on our weakness. We have somewhat,
but not enough. Some, like myself, are ready to pledge their
private fortunes, and there will be certain payments coming from
the Emperor, who wishes us well. But we cannot do as the King
does, and order requisitions in the name of the law. We must
depend on the good-will and ardour of our followers, who will
venture their substance knowing that victory will repay them a
hundredfold."</p>

<p>"But if the King has bled the land sore, will there be any
recompense for those who overthrow him? He has plundered the
Church and the poor, and such a course is barred to us."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard glanced sharply at Peter.</p>

<p>"A way will be found," he said. "There are many resources for
the victorious."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter's life at Avelard was not to be idle. His mentor was
satisfied with his skill in swordsmanship and something more than
satisfied with his prowess with long-bow and cross-bow. But the
boy had no more than a peasant's knowledge of a horse, and he
spent long hours that afternoon at the <i>man&egrave;ge,</i>
where Lord Avelard's master of horse, a Walloon from Ghent,
proved an exacting, albeit a respectful, tutor. For the rest he
seemed to be solitary in that immense echoing house. Lord Avelard
did not show himself after the conclave of the morning, and there
was no flutter of skirts in doorway or corridor to reveal the
girl who had sung to the clavicytherium.</p>

<p>Peter watched the dusk gather over Severn valley, and roamed
from the terrace to the pleasance and to the edge of the outer
curtilage. The smell of wet bracken and rotting leaves drifted up
to him from the woods, and a whiff of wood-smoke from the fire of
some tinker or forester in the dingles. He had lost his sense of
strangeness. He felt that this world of power and riches was his
by right, and he looked on the lackeys with a possessing eye. His
imagination was fired by what he had heard that morning, and he
burned to see the argent and gules of Buckingham marshalled
against the Tudor verd and argent. He must learn--learn savagely,
for there was but little time in which to become a leader of men.
He must be wary, for he stood alone. He was a pawn in the game,
but when that pawn became a king it would be no more a pawn. His
followers would fight for him only because he might help them to
satisfy their own desires. There had been kindness in Lord
Avelard's face, he was well-disposed to the son of his old
friend, but kindness would never be the overmastering motive with
such a man. That old face, with the shadows blue as in a
snowdrift, was like white fire. . . . He stiffened his back, and
felt a sudden access of manhood. These men should not use him
save in so far as his will consorted with theirs. Money--that was
what he lacked, what the whole enterprise lacked. Had he but
wealth behind him he would assuredly call the tune. As it was, he
would play high for fortune. He was Bohun--of that pride none
could deprive him.</p>

<p>But, indoors again, his thoughts were suddenly switched to a
different world. "Mistress Beauforest begs permission to join you
at supper"; the yeoman of the hall told him, and his cheeks
burned foolishly. He was to see for the third time this lady who
had become the constant companion of his dreams.</p>

<p>He ransacked his new wardrobe for a suit which took his fancy,
and finally chose one of rose-coloured silk taffeta, with a
surcoat of primrose velvet. Boy-like, he was first of all
delighted with his magnificence, and then abashed. He wore a
sword--he was entitled now to that, since he would soon have an
army behind him. And then, with his heart beating hard, he
entered the Great Chamber, where he proposed to sup. "My lord
keeps his room," the usher told him, and his heart went
faster.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. A girl entered, followed by her
tire-woman, who carried her comfit-box, a gold pomander, and a
little pied Italian greyhound. She swept Peter a curtsey so deep
that her knee almost touched the floor. She did not offer him her
cheek; instead she took his hand and carried it to her lips. The
tire-woman withdrew, the lackeys, after placing some dishes on
the table, also left the room, and the two were alone.</p>

<p>A girl, so he had thought of her. But this was no girl, no
woman, but the very goddess of love, Venus sprung from the foam.
She wore a gown of black satin bordered with black velvet, an
ebony sheath for her dazzling whiteness. There were jewels with a
frosty blue sparkle on her hand and in her hair. To Peter's
fascinated eyes it seemed that her gown was scarcely a covering,
for the snow of her neck and bosom was revealed, and, as she
moved, the soft supple lines of her body. But it was her eyes
that held him in a spell. This was a woman whom he had never seen
before, and such eyes he had never dreamed of, coaxing, inviting,
challenging.</p>

<p>She waited his permission to sit down. The fire on the hearth
was burning brightly, and its flicker caught her jewels and the
sheen of her satin. The heavy curtains shut out the world.</p>

<p>She toyed daintily with her food, but Peter's meal was a
farce, for he could not swallow, though he drank a goblet of wine
in answer to her pledge. She fed the little greyhound on scraps,
and talked to it wooingly. To Peter she spoke in a soft voice
like music, with an air of tremulous respect. But she was wholly
mistress of herself, and in her eyes was a strange seductive
boldness. Her every movement was voluptuous--the turn of her
limbs when she switched her train beside her chair, the sudden
glimpse of a shapely arm outstretched to take a pear from a
platter, the occasional fall of her cloak which revealed more of
a white bosom.</p>

<p>Peter was in a tremor, in which there was as much fear as
delight. Dimly he perceived that this woman was his for the
taking, that she was part of the appurtenances of one who was
Bohun and might be King of England. But he had not bargained for
such a goddess. He had thought of her as a difficult Artemis, and
now, behold, she was Aphrodite. Something monastic and virginal
in him was repelled. He suddenly found his self-possession and
the power of speech. But, as he recovered his tongue, she lost
hers and she answered only with her eyes. And gradually into her
eyes, which had been so full of lure and challenge, crept
something different--was it disappointment, anger? Peter could
look steadfastly at her now, and he observed that these eyes,
which with her ashen blondeness should have been grey or blue,
were the faintest hazel, like a shallow moorland stream running
over white sand. The light in the limpid waters seemed suddenly
to grow hot and sullen.</p>

<p>It was she who rang the silver bell which brought the servants
and concluded the meal. Her tire-woman caught up her greyhound
and her trinkets, and the lackeys bowed her to the door. She
offered her cheek to Peter in a cousinly good-night, and to his
lips it was cold.</p>

<p>As Peter went to bed he passed Lord Avelard in a furred
night-robe and it seemed to him that the old eyes opened a little
wider as if in surprise.</p>

<p>He fell asleep with his head full of the strange beauty which
might be his, but he did not dream of her. Instead he saw a great
army trampling over England, with, in the van, the silver knot of
Stafford and the swan of Bohun.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">III</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Next day came Sir Gabriel Messynger out of Wales. It had been
rough weather beyond Severn, but that morning Sir Gabriel had
made a fresh toilet, and was as trim and bright as if he had
never left the Court. He was a young man not yet thirty, high
coloured and ruddy, with reddish hair cut close to the bone after
the new fashion, so that his round head flamed like a noontide
sun. His clothes had the extravagance of the town--a shirt of
fine laced silk, a doublet of cloth of gold, and sleeves puffed
and slashed in a magnificence of rose and purple. Peter's
forecast proved true. This was the gallant he had seen that
evening in Stowood when he had first set eyes on Lord
Avelard.</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel showed that he was in the secret by treating the
boy with an elaborate respect, while his shrewd pale eyes--blue
in one light, green it seemed in others--sought his face
furtively, as if hungry to appraise him. He had news of
importance for Lord Avelard's ears, and was closeted with him
till the dinner-hour. At that meal Sabine Beauforest appeared--to
be the recipient of Sir Gabriel's loftiest courtesy. Yet the two
seemed to be old acquaintances, for they shared together many
covert jests, and their eyes would often meet in secret
confidences. Her manner to Peter was one of stiff decorum; to the
other she unbent like a friendly child.</p>

<p>After dinner they rode in the wild park in a brief clearing of
the weather. Sabine and Sir Gabriel rode like madcaps, and Peter,
still in his novitiate, found himself often in these gallops half
out of the saddle and only saved from falling by an unseemly
clutch at the mane. Happily his horse, Spanish blood crossed with
the nimble Welsh, was wise and sure-footed, and needed little
management, for Peter had none to give. While they walked their
beasts, Gabriel and Sabine yielded place to him as to a superior,
consulting his wishes, and falling a little behind like dutiful
servants; but, once let them swing into a gallop in some aisle of
turf, and Peter was forgotten. He pounded precariously in their
rear, while their laughter came back to him above the beat of
hoofs, and sounded like mockery.</p>

<p>The consequence was that, once indoors again, with his blood
brisk from movement and weather, Peter found himself in a mood of
jealous irritation. He had been excluded from a world which
should have been his own, he lagged last when he should have been
foremost. Before supper in the hall they played games--Pope July,
shovelpound, imperial, and the new French deckles--and he played
badly, for his temper was sour and his self-consciousness
extreme. Sir Gabriel--in a fresh suit--was in a merry mood, and
Sabine was prepared to condescend, but Peter's sulks kept the air
tense. He was ready to quarrel with Sir Gabriel, whose fine
clothes offended him, his idiot laugh and aggressive geniality.
With Sabine he could not quarrel, for she regarded him not; only
by a respectful inclination or a humble dropping of the eyes did
she acknowledge his presence. She had some grievance against him,
and barred him resolutely from her world. But Sir Gabriel refused
to quarrel; he accepted Peter's contradictions meekly, and turned
his rudeness with a pleasant laugh, so that the boy for very
shame was forced to civility.</p>

<p>At supper a new Sir Gabriel was revealed. When the servants
had gone and a bowl of spiced wine had been mixed against the
damp, they talked of the King, half under their breath, and with
many glances at the doors. The goblets were all of crystal, a new
device to guard against poison.</p>

<p>"You have his colouring, Gabriel," said Lord Avelard. "Were
your mother's virtue not notorious, you might be reckoned his
son."</p>

<p>"He never begot anything so sound of flesh," the young man
laughed. "My lord, have you not observed that his blood is
tainted? When he is bruised in a tourney, he shows black for
months. If his skin is broke, he will bleed for many hours. The
nature of his body is all evil humours."</p>

<p>"In his youth he was like Phoebus," said the old man, "rosy
and effulgent, so that the commons on whom he beamed hailed him
as half divine. Never was such a bewitcher of empty heads. But to
those who marked him close there was something of ill-breeding in
the little eyes near set in that vast shining face. He seemed
something less, if something more, than man. There was a devil,
too, in his vast appetites."</p>

<p>Sir Gabriel cracked a walnut. "There are tales not seemly for
a gentlewoman's company, which would bear out the truth you have
spoken. He is of another breed from the old, rugged, hard-faced
masters of England. As you know, my lord, I am of an ancient but
modest house, and so, being in a middle place, am well situated
to note the heights and the hollows. I go not in my judgments by
a man's countenance. The ancient nobility had as many different
visages as coats, but were all large-featured and lean, the body
being but a sheath for a strong spirit. Their colour was dusky or
wan, since their flesh was in close subjection. But now comes the
King and his race of new men, and they are all much cumbered with
fat and overfull of blood. There was the Cardinal of York, with
his cheeks like a Martinmas boar. There is this Crummle with his
litter of chins and his swine's eyes. There is Russell and
Wriothesley and Fitzwilliam, all fair of flesh like applewomen.
Above all, there is the King's grace. The Beast has come to rule
in England and it is ousting men made in their Maker's image. . .
. But mark you, if they have boar's cheeks and boar's eyes, they
have also boar's jaws which do not easily slacken their
hold."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard smiled. "You have wits in that popinjay's head of
yours, Gabriel. The Welshman has indeed the lust to acquire and
the lust to retain. That is the devil in his blood, and it will
not be subdued save by blood-letting."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord," said Sir Gabriel, "but let us remember this for
our comfort. If you let clean blood, you free a man from surfeits
and make him whole, but if you let tainted blood you kill, for
the wound will not heal. There is some nice chirurgeon's work in
store for England."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard retired early, and the others sat in the Great
Chamber. Sabine had withdrawn into a distant stateliness, and was
fingering a lute as if it burned her fingers. "Music, music," Sir
Gabriel cried, stretching himself on a long stool. "Music to
dispel the ugliness of our table talk. Sing of bright and jolly
things. Hark to the wind! Winter is on us, and God knows what
that winter will be. Sing of summertime."</p>

<p>"I am in no mood to sing," said the girl, but she plucked
softly at the lute's strings.</p>

<p>"Tush, my lady, you are always singing. Your face is a
madrigal, and your hair is a mesh of sweet notes. You are all
music to the eye, so make music also for the ear."</p>

<p>The girl sighed, cast one sombre glance at Peter who was
standing by the hearth, and then let her eyes rest on the
smouldering logs. She touched a chord or two and began to
sing:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Summer is come with love to town,<br>
 Throstle in bush and lark on down<br>
 Merrily tell their tale O.<br>
 Folk that pine<br>
 Now drink sunshine<br>
 More strong than winter's ale O.<br>
 Sweet mistress, why so pale O?<br>
 I hie to thee<br>
 As river to sea<br>
 When the deer draw to the dale O."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a rude thing of several verses, each ending with the
refrain about the deer and the dale. But, as the girl sang it, it
was no longer a country catch, a thing for milkmaids and
shepherds, but the p&aelig;an of youth and spring with the
bravado of all lovers since the world was born. Into that
shuttered and curtained chamber, outside which the wet October
winds blew, it carried a fragrance like flowers. Sabine sang soft
and slow, her eyes on the fire, her face abstracted from Peter.
She repeated one verse, and then broke into a flight of grace
notes, a fantasy which she followed with her voice, a rich eddy
of curious music twisting in and out in an aerial dance. She was
singing to please herself, for she had forgotten Peter by the
hearth and Sir Gabriel on his couch. Presently a gentle snore
broke in on the music. Sir Gabriel, tired with his Welsh journey,
was asleep.</p>

<p>It was the fantasia, rather than the singing, which stirred
Peter's heart. For the rhythm it made was the rhythm of the dance
which he had watched in the midsummer night on the Painted
Floor.</p>

<p>She fell silent at last, and let the lute drop, while she sat
with her hands between her knees, her head bent forward.</p>

<p>"I thank you." Peter's voice sounded intolerably harsh in his
ear--the words of Mercury after the songs of Apollo. "You sing
like the blessed angels. . . . I have heard that song
before."</p>

<p>She bent her face slowly towards him, and he noted that her
eyes were blind, as if turned back in some inward absorption.
"That cannot be," she said.</p>

<p>"Nay, but it is so. Not heard it, maybe, but felt it. For I
watched you dancing to that very air one July night on the Roman
floor by Wood Eaton."</p>

<p>Her absorption was gone. She flushed rosily to the tips of her
little ears. "You know the place?" she stammered. "You saw me? .
. ."</p>

<p>"I first found the place, being guided thereto by the words of
an ancient deed, and with my own hands I cleared it. We are twin
discoverers, mistress."</p>

<p>She rose and held out her hands, and in her eyes was a sudden
wild abandonment which made their cool shallows a molten fire.
She was giving herself to his arms--she was inviting him to her
breast--and an answering passion awoke in the boy. But at that
moment Sir Gabriel rolled off his couch and woke. He saw Peter
holding Sabine's hand to his lips, and speaking words of
gratitude with a warmth which he had not looked for in one so
fish-like.</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">IV</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter was roused before dawn next morning by Lord Avelard
standing by his bed. The collar of his furred night-robe stood
about his head like a crest, so that to the boy's sleepy eyes he
had the air of an immense gnome.</p>

<p>"The devil is in this business," he said. "Who think you are
here? One of Crummle's wolves--Plummer his name, a Middle Temple
lawyer--on his way to take reckoning with the Gloucester monks.
He has a secretary with him, and four armed servants, and as a
companion young Rede of Boarstall, who once saw you and inquired
concerning you. What brings them here? They are ten miles out of
the straight road to Gloucester, and there is no religious house
in these parts to stir their greed. It may be that Crummle has
got a hint of our doings and would spy out the land. I like not
this young Rede's presence, for he has been known as a King's
man, but no Crummle's man, and yet here he is playing fugleman to
the worst of them."</p>

<p>"Must I get me gone?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, that would be to make suspicion certainty, if, as I
believe, they know of your presence here. But, while they know of
your presence they do not know who you are. Mark well, my son.
You are no more than my cousin and destined heir, Master Bonamy
from Dyston in Salop. My servants have been instructed, and
Sabine and Gabriel will keep up the play. God send our guests do
not tarry long. It behoves us to treat the rogues like princes
and welcome them like May flowers. Haply we will get from them
some later news out of the east and north."</p>

<p>It was a clear mild October day, and at breakfast in the hall
the sun shone full on the company. Master Plummer, the
commissioner, was a black-avised man of middle age, with a yellow
parchment skin, a quick eye like a fowl's, and the voice of the
hectoring lawyer. He was servile to his host, civil to Gabriel
and Peter, fulsome to Sabine, but always with an air of one who
condescended, and could at any moment change the velvet glove for
the iron hand. He ate a breakfast of a size miraculous for one so
slight, and, as he gobbled noisily, he babbled of his doings at
Court, of his purchase with his master and his power with the
King, and of the noble work he had wrought already in curbing the
vice and gluttony of the religious. "Honest men must come to
their own," he cried so often, that it sounded as if he demanded
from the company some proof of honesty.</p>

<p>The other traveller, Simon Rede, for the most part kept
silence. Three times Peter had seen him--once on the midsummer
night in Stowood when he had envied his conquering air, once in
Oxford streets, and once on that afternoon when he had ridden
with Sabine from the hunt. Now, in his travelling dress which
bore the stains of the road and was scarcely richer than a
yeoman's, he looked more formidable than ever. There was power in
every movement of his limbs, the small shapely head set on a
strong neck, the breadth of the shoulders, the gnarled brown
wrists beneath his cuff-bands. His face appeared to have been
weathered by hotter suns than England's, for, except below the
eyes and ears, it was the colour of dark oak, and seamed with the
fine lines which come only from the glare and the spray of the
sea. It was a hard face, and yet prepossessing, for its arrogance
was a clean thing like a north wind, not the fussy pride of the
commissary. . . . He met Peter's eye with no sign of recognition,
though he had had him in full view on that afternoon in Stowood,
and, according to Sir Ralph Bonamy, had set afoot inquiries about
him. Sir Gabriel was a stranger to him, but Sabine was plainly a
friend. She had greeted him as such, and at breakfast his eyes
were always travelling towards her, and whenever she spoke, he
seemed to bend to listen. . . . Peter had a sudden conviction.
This man was in love with her. He had come here because of her,
using the commissary's visit as an excuse to enter Avelard. And
with this conviction came a spasm of furious jealousy.</p>

<p>Master Plummer, having ridden through part of the night, was
weary, so he retired to his chamber to sleep, announcing that he
would push on towards Gloucester in the late afternoon. So far so
good, but it was necessary to dispose safely of Master Rede. Sir
Gabriel took upon himself the duty of master of ceremonies. There
was a heavy buck harboured in Dainton wood, which would for
certain run towards the river, where the going was good even in a
soft October. So horses were brought and the four young people
rode out into the sloeberry bloom of the autumn wilds. For three
hours they ran the buck, but the mort was never sounded, for he
took to the water and found sanctuary beyond the flooded Severn.
By midday, too, the weather had changed, a torrent of rain
descended, and long ere they won the shelter of Avelard the four
were soaked to the bone.</p>

<p>Peter had been all morning violently out of temper. The
thought of Simon Rede as a lover of Sabine had thrown him into a
mood of deep disquiet. Sir Gabriel's intimacy with the girl had
not perturbed him, but there was that in the other's air of
mastery which struck fear to his heart. What woman could resist
one who had the face of the god of battles, and treated the world
as his own demesne? Before such assurance Peter felt raw and
impotent. This galling sense of inferiority was increased by the
incidents of the hunt. Where the others leaped their horses
easily over ditches and pales, he was compelled to make an
ignominious circuit. The result was that he fell far behind, and
the stag had taken to the river while he was still ploughing a
mile away through swampy thickets.</p>

<p>From a knoll he saw the others turn, while the prickers' horns
sounded to recall the hounds. The rain had begun, and in deep
disgust he too swung his horse round for home. Below him in a
hollow were some charcoal-burners at work, and one of them, a
young man, followed him, and touched his stirrup.</p>

<p>"How far be it, master, to the skirts of Wychwood?" he asked
in a broad Gloucestershire burr.</p>

<p>For a moment Peter was taken aback, and could only stare. Then
he remembered.</p>

<p>"As far as to Peter's Gate," he replied.</p>

<p>"Alack!" said the man, stumbling between each word, "I shall
not be there in time." Then he grinned. "I have a message for ye,
brave sir. Mas'r Darking be mighty eager to see ye. Ye will get
news of him at Goody Sweetbread's. The word given me to pass on
was that there was summat in the ground as concerned your
fortunes." The man pulled a forelock, and went back to his
companions.</p>

<p>To Peter the message was like a breeze to dispel the fog of
his discontents, since it reminded him of the high road on which
his feet were set. What was Simon Rede to him who would soon be
the master of ten thousand men? His ambition rekindled, and
burned side by side with his passion for Sabine, for the two were
one.</p>

<p>After dinner, while the rain pelted on the windows, came word
that the commissary, fearing the swamps of the valley in such
weather, had resolved to postpone his going till the morrow. So
the good-humoured Sir Gabriel set himself to devise amusement for
indoors. Little Welsh horses were provided, their feet cased in
monstrous shoes of felt, and he and Simon held a miniature
tourney on the black-and-white marble pavement of the hall. Sir
Gabriel won, and was crowned by the laughing Sabine with a wreath
of ivy. There was sword-play, too, in which Peter could hold his
own, and a nice show of dagger-and-buckler work by Sir Gabriel,
who at the French court had learned to be a master of games.
Then, as the wet dusk drew in, they sat around the big hearth and
talked, the commissary being engaged with Lord Avelard
elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was curious talk, in which Peter, restored to good humour,
joined but little, sitting apart and watching the others. It
began with the foreign wars, and it seemed to him that Sir
Gabriel was bent on discovering, with adroit courtesy, something
of Simon's past life and present ventures. But, with equal
courtesy, the other put the questions by. He had been much about
the northern courts on errands for the Council, but such business
was not for gossip, as Sir Gabriel well knew. Peter observed that
the latter's manner had lost its bravado, and that his face had
become that of an older and shrewder man. Almost it seemed to him
that it had acquired something of the hardness of the commissary
upstairs.</p>

<p>To the girl Simon was more forthcoming. "There is a wider
world than Europe, my lady," he said, "and I have ventured some
way into it." And then, in response to her questions, he began to
tell tales, drifting casually into them, smilingly disclaiming
any importance for them, and, as he spoke, his face too seemed to
change. It became gentler, less wary and assured, and he smiled
as if his memories were happy. He told how, as a boy, he had
journeyed in the Bristol gabbarts to Gascony for wine, to
Portugal with salted fish, to Ireland, and once far north,
involuntarily, with a storm behind him, into icy seas. And, when
come to man's estate, he had sailed with Cabot of Bristol in the
service of the King of Spain to the new world beyond the Western
Sea. . . . For a space all hung on his words, and Sabine, with
her head bent forward and her lips parted, never took her eyes
from his face. He told of great rivers so wide that a man in
midstream could see neither shore, of forests with their feet in
the salt water, of strange bright fruits and birds, and
dark-skinned people a touch of whose arrows brought death.</p>

<p>"Gold and jewels?" she asked breathlessly. "Did you find
them?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "A little of each, mistress, such as a hasty
seafarer can carry on board. But those lands are rich beyond
mortal dreams. There is a dark blanket which covers Europe, but
beyond it there are open skies and the sun."</p>

<p>She looked at him with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"How can you endure to sit at Boarstall and look out on Otmoor
mud, when you know that there are such brave lands for the
finding?"</p>

<p>Again he laughed.</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman," he said, "and I may wish to give a hand
in raising the blanket that covers us."</p>

<p>At that all fell silent, for they realised that they had come
very near forbidden things, and each wondered what was in the
other's heart.</p>

<p>Lord Avelard broke in upon the conclave, and with him came the
commissary, now rested and refreshed and in a mellow temper.</p>

<p>"We have another guest," said the old lord, "and an ill-boding
one. There is a fellow here, one of the new gospellers, who has
been working mischief among the Oxford clerks. He is Cambridge
bred, but the devil sent him to sow tares in the Oxford fields.
The proctors laid hold on him, but he escaped, and his grace of
Lincoln, having a mind to end the evil, sent his men after him,
and he has been taken while attempting to cross the marches into
Wales. He has been brought here, and it is required that I keep
him in safe custody and send him guarded to Oxford for the Bishop
to deal with. They are bringing him in that I may have a look at
him. Master commissary, we know well that the King's grace,
though he has a grudge against certain of the religious, has an
ardent mind to pure religion and will tolerate no
heresy-making."</p>

<p>The commissary nodded and blinked.</p>

<p>"The King's grace is a good Christian. And so likewise is his
grace's Vicar-General." But he seemed uneasy, and shot a sharp
glance at Simon, which Peter intercepted.</p>

<p>"'Tis a difficult time for a Christian," said Sir Gabriel
airily. "If he have a liking for the Pope he may be hanged for
treason, and if he like not the mass he may burn for heresy."</p>

<p>The commissary frowned, and Lord Avelard shook a warning head.
Simon had risen and Peter observed that his face had become
grim.</p>

<p>"What is the man's name?" he asked, and it was clear that he
strove to keep his voice soft.</p>

<p>"One Sturmy or Sturdy," said Lord Avelard. "His grace of
Lincoln writes a plaguey bad hand. But here comes the
fellow."</p>

<p>The outer door of the hall was thrown open by an usher, and
five men entered. Four wore the Bishop's livery and carried
halberts. The fifth was the man Peter had met with the gipsies in
the Stowood covert--he could not mistake the thin face and the
burning eyes. He was no longer in rags, but wore a sober clerk's
garb much splashed with mire. He had damaged his left arm, which
hung in a dirty sling. There was a chain round his middle, the
other end of which was locked to the wrist of one of the
warders.</p>

<p>The prisoner seemed in no way perturbed. He looked weary and
famished, but he held his head erect, and his eyes met Lord
Avelard's bent brows with a scornful composure.</p>

<p>"You are one Sturmy, Nathaniel Sturmy, a clerk of
Cambridge?"</p>

<p>The man bowed. "I am that one."</p>

<p>"Who after working mischief in Oxford fled to Wales, but was
taken on the bank of Severn?"</p>

<p>"I was stayed by the Lord's hands. He sent His floods as a
sign that He had still work for me to do in England."</p>

<p>"You are charged with speaking against the holy mysteries, and
with distributing certain books among the common people whereby
their hearts are seduced?"</p>

<p>"The charge is true. I have spoken against mummeries which
pervert the truth, and I have laboured to spread the knowledge of
God's own word."</p>

<p>"You have already been found guilty of like blasphemies, and
have confessed and repented. At Uxbridge you carried a faggot in
a procession of heretics, and did penance on the
altar-steps?"</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed the man's face. "Woe is me, it is
true. The flesh was weak and I was afeared. Now I have gotten
strength to endure all things."</p>

<p>The commissary spoke out, and his tone was harsh. "A plague on
such ignorant lubbers. When the King's grace is bent on reforming
Holy Church, you must needs step in with your follies, thereby
delaying the good work. Know you the penalty, fellow, for your
errors, the penalty established by the law's wisdom? To be
drowned in a sack or to be burned in a public place."</p>

<p>The man looked scornfully at his inquisitor.</p>

<p>"Threaten those things to rich and dainty folk who are clothed
in purple and have their life in this world. Thanks be to God, I
care not whether I go to Heaven by land or water or fire!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he looked round the company, and his eyes fell on
Simon. Some intelligence seemed to pass between them, for of a
sudden his face lightened, and when Peter glanced at Simon he saw
that his mouth was set hard. . . . And then Peter had a strange
experience. As he looked, the world seemed to go small. The noble
hall with its carvings and gildings and escutcheons suddenly
shrank into a little bare place. Lord Avelard seemed a broken old
man with deathlike cheeks, Sir Gabriel a painted lath, the
commissary a hollow thing like an empty barrel, Sabine a pretty
mask with nothing behind but a heart ticking foolishly. Even
Simon looked wooden and lifeless. But this wisp of a man,
manacled to his jailer, seemed to give out life as fiercely as a
furnace gives out heat. There was such a convincing purpose in
him that in his presence all the rest of them with their brave
appurtenances dwindled and withered.</p>

<p>The mood lasted but for a second. When he looked again he saw
only a shabby prisoner, and heard Lord Avelard saying: "Take him
away. I will furnish two extra guards to carry him to-morrow to
Oxford."</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was all discomfort. The commissary was
out of temper, and suspicious of everybody, notably of Sir
Gabriel, whose persiflage fell as flat as rain-water in a strong
sun. Simon was moody, and seemed to be thinking his own thoughts,
while Lord Avelard laboured in vain to play the genial host.
Sabine, too, was in an odd mood, dropping her eyes, chary of her
smiles, forgetful of her graciousness of the night before. She
spoke only to Simon, who gave her short answers. Peter's jealousy
burned fierce, for it had much to feed on. He went to bed angry
with the world, angry with the girl, and with the conviction that
in Simon Rede he had found a rival and an enemy.</p>

<p>Lord Avelard came to him in his chamber. He at any rate was
not out of temper, for his cheeks puckered in smiles.</p>

<p>"That was a pretty play," he said. "'Tis well known that
Crummle is the blackest heretic in the land, and this young Rede
I fear is no better. They are walking on difficult ground, for
with one hand they are plundering the Church and with the other
must smite all who deny the Church's creed, because their
thick-witted master still hopes to save his soul. They cannot
quarrel with my urgency to oblige the Bishop, since 'tis their
King's wish, but you could see what gall and wormwood it was to
them. . . . But Avelard is no place for you at this moment. Both
Rede and that black commissary have been examining my servants
concerning you. Best go back for a little to Stowood till this
visitation be past. There is good news from the east, where the
stubble is ablaze, and soon Crummle and his crew will have their
hands full in that quarter. You had best leave at dawn to-morrow.
I am sending two of my fellows to strengthen the Bishop's
guard--needless enough, but a proof of my good-will--and what
more natural than that my young kinsman should accompany them, as
a pledge of the holy zeal of the house of Avelard?"</p>

<p>"Does Master Rede go to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"He rides with the commissary to Gloucester. What brought him
here, think you? I have my guess that it was the bright eyes of
Mistress Sabine. But that dainty flesh is not for him." The old
eyes looked at Peter with that in them which restored his
confidence and set his heart beating.</p>

<p>He did not tell Lord Avelard of the charcoal-burner's message.
That side of his life had nothing to do with Avelard, and at the
moment it did not seem to him of much importance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c07">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>

<h1>HOW A WOULD-BE KING BECAME A FUGITIVE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Sleep banished the dregs of Peter's ill-temper. The sky had
cleared after the rain, and he set out on his journey in a world
all blue and golden. Master Plummer, too, made an early start,
and to his surprise Peter found that Simon Rede had made a still
earlier one, having left before dawn for Gloucester to prepare
the way for the other's reception. The sour-faced commissary was
therefore a witness, as Lord Avelard had intended, to the zeal of
the house on the Church's errands. The Bishop's four servants
wore sad-coloured liveries with a cross on their shoulders, but
the two Avelard men were splendid in Avelard's yellow and black.
As they started uphill towards the crest of Cotswold the Severn
vale swam in a clear morning light, and the far hills rose blue
and wraith-like against the pale sky. Every thicket was a riot of
autumn gold and crimson, the pools left by the rain were alive
with wild-fowl, and a great wedge of geese was winging across the
valley. Peter drew long breaths of the sharp, scented air. In
such a world it was good to be alive.</p>

<p>His heart had lightened as a boy's will at the coming of a new
pleasure, and his head was filled with two pictures. One was
Sabine, as he had seen her that night when he had revealed his
knowledge of the Painted Floor, and her arms had opened towards
him. Fool that he had been not to accept his fortune! A
malediction on Sir Gabriel for his inopportune awakening! She had
invited him to a deeper intimacy, since they two were sharers in
one secret. . . . She had invited him before. He remembered her
appealing music on his first night at Avelard, and the night when
they had supped together and her eyes had been like a siren's.
Now he saw these incidents in a different light, and he recalled
Lord Avelard's words the evening before. He was the unicorn who,
according to the tale, could only be captured by the wiles of a
virgin's lap. This girl was destined for him, was his for the
taking--and she was not unwilling. A delicious tremor shook him;
he exulted, yet with fear. What mattered Simon Rede when her
heart was his? He told himself that he had already conquered. . .
. And then another picture took the stage in his brain, inspired
by the quick movement and the jingle of harness in the diamond
morning. He saw himself riding at the head of an immense
concourse--all England--with the swan of Bohun above him. The
picture fairly ravished him. What, forsooth, mattered Simon Rede
to one born to such a fortune?</p>

<p>Ay, but what of Simon Rede? There was that in the man's face
which could not be put aside, and Peter's high mood suddenly
fled. The man was stronger than he. He had travelled far and
wrought mightily and mastered his world, while he was still in
his tutelage. . . . The thought brought back all his
uncertainties. He was but a tool in the hands of others and his
power and place was only on sufferance. He was the painted flag
men sent before them into battle--a thing valued not for its own
sake but because it was a symbol of their pride. And, as he
looked back on the company at Avelard, the picture seemed to
darken. The old lord with his waxen face fought for the antique
privileges of his order, and since Peter was of his order and a
comrade's son he had a kindness for him. But nothing more. Sir
Gabriel was a squire in the same cause--a crusader with a very
mercantile interest in his crusade, for he had studied his face
and seen the cool calculation behind the gaiety. Sabine was the
delicate lady of the order, the prize for the man who should be
its champion. But Simon Rede was of a different world. Whatever
course he followed would have daylight and honour in it. He was
the spending, not the getting, kind, and would fling his cap over
the moon for a gallant whimsey. Curses on that high air of his!
It might leave Sabine cold, but for Peter it had an ill-boding
sorcery.</p>

<p>And that rag of a man, the gospeller! He had spoken strange
words the night before, when he had scorned the commissary's
threats, and had bidden him use them to those "whose hope was in
this world." Peter had been bred to think that this world at its
best was a perishing thing, and that man's first business was to
save his soul. But now all his thoughts were on mundane glory and
mundane joys. There was small relish of salvation in his new
life. . . . He was to be the champion of the old Church against
the King, but what cared Lord Avelard and his like for the
Church, save as a prop to their own fortunes? . . . He was now
engaged in the repression of heresy, but there were some who had
called both him and Brother Tobias heretics, because they had
followed Erasmus and the new learning. This gospeller's offence
was spreading knowledge of the Scriptures, a thing which Tobias
had long urged and which the King's grace himself had toyed with.
. . . Acute doubts assailed him, doubts not only of his own
powers, but of the merits of his cause. Was he fighting only for
the lust of the eyes and the pride of life? If so, his cause
smacked somewhat of damnation.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had ridden ahead, but when they were descending
the long slopes to the Coln, with Cirencester town smoking below
on their right, he fell back on the party. The gospeller rode
between two of the Bishop's servants with the two others behind
him, and the Avelard men bringing up the rear. He was no longer
manacled, but a stout thong joined his bridle hand to the belt of
one of the servants. Peter ordered the thong to be loosed that he
might ride abreast of the man, and bade the others fall back a
little. The Bishop's servants, ill-looking rogues all of them,
sullenly obeyed. At first it seemed that they might refuse, for
they knew nothing of Peter, and the old clothes which he had
resumed did not suggest rank, but a word from the Avelard men
brought their compliance.</p>

<p>The gospeller looked ill and weary. In the daylight his skin
had the yellow tinge of one who had suffered much from ague, and
the same colour showed in the whites of his eyes. He drooped in
the saddle, and his wounded left arm seemed to pain him. He
stared in front of him, while Peter adjusted the cavalcade, and
when they rode forward together he did not raise his eyes. He
seemed to be repeating a prayer, for his lips moved
continually.</p>

<p>"You are a sick man," Peter said. "I will call a halt, when
you wish, that you may rest. There is no need for haste."</p>

<p>"Nay, friend, I am well enough," was the answer. "Like the
Psalmist, I pass through the valley of misery and find springs
therein."</p>

<p>"We have met before. In July at midnight in the hollow below
Stowood as you go to Wood Eaton. You were with a troop of
gipsies, and I tumbled by chance on your encampment."</p>

<p>At last the man raised his head and looked at his companion.
"I remember. An Oxford clerk in a poor gown. What does such an
one in the halls of the great? I saw you yesternight among the
gentles, clothed as they. What part has a scholar in that
magnificence? What has a poor Grecian to do with the rich and the
oppressive?"</p>

<p>"You said, when you looked in my face that night, that I was
no churl's get."</p>

<p>The man set his penetrating eyes on his companion. "I spoke
truly. So you are of the blood of Avelard. Well, 'tis a high
stock to them who value such vanities, but 'tis a strange taproot
for a Grecian. Yon old fox is the steeliest bigot in all the west
country. He loves not the King, but he will compound for treason
by being hot against heresy."</p>

<p>A bank of cloud had obscured the sun and the wind blew
suddenly sharp from the south-east. The gospeller shivered, for
he had no cloak.</p>

<p>"I like not the weather," said Peter, sniffing the air. "The
mallard are flighting low, too. It smells like the first
snows."</p>

<p>The gospeller muttered to himself. "When it is evening, ye
say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red'; and in the
morning, 'It will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and
lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky,
but can ye not discern the signs of the times?'"</p>

<p>Then he lifted his hand. "You are abbey-bred, young sir?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said Peter. "Oseney."</p>

<p>The man's face softened. "Well I know it, and 'twas once a
noble palace of God. But it is falling, falling, like all the
others. I looked on it again this very summer, and my eyes
watered as I gazed on that noble tower which would make a fit
resting-place for archangels, and my ear heard its myriad of
chinking rivulets. When I passed through its courts I saw old men
mazed in foolish worldly toils, and the stones crumbling, and
grass growing in their cracks. There are few sins in Oseney save
those of omission, but its feeble innocence will not save it. It
goes the way of the rest, for the Lord is purging His threshing
floor. . . . You are doubtless one who would save such relics,
even when they fester."</p>

<p>"Nay, I would reshape them. There are abuses enough, God
knows, and some of them I have seen with my own eyes. But I would
not plunder God to enrich Mammon."</p>

<p>"So that is your way of it." The man seemed to have lost his
weariness and sat straighter in the saddle. "Where then should
the abbey spoils go when the folk are sent packing? If you say
'to the service of a purified Church,' then you and I think the
same. Strange, if you are kin to Avelard!"</p>

<p>"I would not send the folk packing. They have not oppressed
the poor, like many of the great ones, and the poor in these days
have few friends."</p>

<p>The man bent his brow. "Stranger still for Avelard blood! Why,
man, your ancient kinsman has been in his day the harshest
oppressor this side of Severn! You are right in one thing. The
poor man needs every friend who will stand between him and the
bitter blasts that blow from the high places. But the abbeys were
not protectors. No nursing mothers they, but harsh stepdams."</p>

<p>"Then what is this news from the eastern shires?" Peter asked.
"It would seem that the commons of those parts are ready to risk
their necks for the religious houses."</p>

<p>"That is the lovable simplicity of poor folk. But it is not
for the monks they fight but for their hope of salvation.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Christ crucified<br>
 For thy wounds wide<br>
 Us commons guide<br>
 Which pilgrims be!'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That is their song. The hearts of Englishmen are not turned
from God, but their eyes are dim. But God is preparing His own
salve for their blear eyes, and soon they will see clear. England
will be merry again when she has turned from the glosses and
corruptions of man to the plain script of God. To that great
purpose many contribute, though they know it not. The King on the
throne, for one, and the broad-faced scrivener Crummle who
gathers treasure for his master. They are but instruments to win
the world back from the Church to Christ. . . ."</p>

<p>"They are strange instruments for a strange end," said Peter.
"And the same instruments will bear hard on you, my friend."</p>

<p>"Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him," was the answer.
"The bodies of many will be dung for the fields before the new
grain springs."</p>

<p>Peter rose in his stirrups to look behind him. There were the
Bishop's four servants, but what had become of the Avelard men?
They must have fallen far back and be beyond a turning of the
road which lay straight to the eye for a mile and more. For the
party was now on the great Fosse Way, the Roman highroad which
ran from south-west to north-east across England. The six of them
stopped at the tavern of Fosse Bridge to eat, where the road
crossed the Coln, but they finished their meal without any sign
of the truants. Peter, intent on his own errands, saw no reason
to delay for them, since the Bishop's men were a sufficient
posse, so presently they were jingling up the hill towards the
town of Northleach, where the road branched off for Oxford. But
before they came in sight of its great church, as big as many a
minster, and heard the rattle of the windlasses in the
wool-sheds, another horseman on a bay gelding struck in from a
by-path on their right and joined them. To his surprise and
disgust Peter recognised Simon Rede. The gospeller too recognised
him, for his pale face flushed and a sudden light came into
it.</p>

<p>Simon ranged himself on Peter's other side.</p>

<p>"A fair day for the road, my friend, but 'twill be snow ere
night." His face was ruddy with the weather, and his pale eyes
were merry.</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone to Gloucester," said Peter glumly.</p>

<p>"I have done my errand in that direction, and now business
calls me back to Boarstall. I and my horse are used to long and
sudden journeys. It appears that you are shedding your convoy,
Master Bonamy. I passed two of my Lord Avelard's men five miles
back, drunk as swine in a hedge alehouse."</p>

<p>Peter cried out. "They were sober fellows as ever I saw."</p>

<p>"They are most marvellously unsober now. Strong ale and strong
air go fast to a man's head. But the Bishop may do very well
without them. Four lusty rogues are sufficient to carry a feeble
man to jail."</p>

<p>How it was managed Peter did not know, but at a nod from Simon
the escort closed up, and the gospeller fell back among them.
"Secure that thong," they were told, and the prisoner was again
bound up to the belt of the lackey. Thus Peter found himself
riding ahead with Simon as his companion.</p>

<p>All his antagonism had revived. This man had taken charge of
the party and ousted him from the command, without so much as a
word of explanation. The arrogance of it left him speechless, and
rankled the more since it seemed so natural. The intruder made no
question of it, for he assumed that no question could be
asked.</p>

<p>Yet they had scarcely left Northleach when he found himself
forced into conversation with the interloper, and they had not
gone a mile before that conversation had driven all other
thoughts from his head. For it was clear that this man did not
despise him--nay, that he might even fear him. He seemed disposed
to friendship, and felt his way towards it with a careful
diplomacy. He accepted him as Lord Avelard's heir, a cousin, too,
of old Sir Ralph at Wood Eaton. But his curiosity did not seem to
be about Lord Avelard's affairs but about Sir Gabriel. Who and
what was Sir Gabriel? What did he at Avelard? An unwilling
admiration seemed to lurk in Simon's voice, and dislike too, as
for one too showy and foppish, a distaste which he flatteringly
assumed Peter must share.</p>

<p>But Peter had little to tell him. Sir Gabriel was of the
Court, and had been useful in going to and from the King of
France. . . . And then he guessed at the cause of Simon's
interest. He feared Sir Gabriel as a rival with Sabine, and would
probe his quality. But he did not fear Peter. . . . And at the
thought his vexation returned, and he gave short answers.</p>

<p>But Simon's good humour seemed unbreakable, and it was hard to
be short with him. For, presently, detecting his companion's
mood, he swung off to different topics. He spoke, as he had
spoken the night before, of a widening world. The man had
scholarship of a kind, for he could quote a phrase of Aristotle
and a line of Seneca to the effect that one travelling towards
the sunset would in time come round to the sunrise. Peter's
interest was acutely stirred, and there might have been
confidences between the two had not the weather suddenly turned
to the vilest. The road, strung high along open wolds, ran
eastward, and the riders were met by the full force of a blizzard
of snow. It drove with the violence of the first precursor of the
winter's storms, whipping their faces, blinding their eyes, and
shutting out the Windrush vale with a screen of leaden mist.</p>

<p>"If we would enter upon this new world," Simon was saying, "we
must purge our baggage. A man must travel light." Then he flung a
fold of his cloak around his throat. "A murrain on this weather,"
he cried, "for I must be beyond Otmoor ere I sleep. There is
promise of a heavy fall. You will be well advised, Master Bonamy,
to seek a shelter for the night, since in your errand there is no
need of spurring. It matters little when the wretch behind us
lies in the Bishop's prison so long as he duly reach that haven.
In an hour the night will fall. Best look for a lodging while
there is a spark left of daylight."</p>

<p>The counsel was good, and Peter was conciliated by this
deference to him as leader of the party. But it was no easy task
to find port in such a place in such weather. The road ran
solitary among downs, now piebald with snow, and the prospect on
either side was only a few yards of driving vapour.</p>

<p>Peter had decided to push on to Burford, which he judged to be
but a few miles distant, in spite of his aversion to lying at a
tavern on such an errand, when in a sudden clearing of the snow
he saw a light flicker on his left. He decided that they were
close to Barrington woods, which were outliers of Wychwood. This
must be some forester's hut, and where a forester lodged there
would be an outhouse of some kind where they could camp, and fuel
for a bivouac. So he gave the order to turn north, and, after a
hundred yards of rough pasture, they reached the light and smelt
the smoke of green boughs.</p>

<p>The place proved to be a wretched hovel of logs and mud,
through the chinks of which came the gleam of a fire. In the dim
light there could be seen around it broken walls and one large
ruinous barn.</p>

<p>"This was once a snug farm," said Simon. "Now some waif squats
in the ruins, as a bird builds its nest in the nettles of a
stoneheap."</p>

<p>A shout from Simon brought someone to the door, a half-naked
boy in his middle teens. Simon flung himself from his horse and
pushed past him into the hovel, while Peter followed. It was a
single room with an earthen floor, on which the snow, melting on
the wattled roof and drifting through the holes, was making deep
puddles. There was no light in the place but a new-kindled fire
of wet wood, the smoke from which filled the air and set the eyes
smarting. Furniture there was none except a three-legged stool
and in a corner a heap of straw on which it seemed that a human
figure lay. This was no forester's hut, but a hovel of the very
poorest.</p>

<p>On the stool sat a man who seemed to be engaged in cooking
something in a broken pot. He was a bent creature with tangled
tow-like hair. A ragged sack was his only garment, and through
the rents of it showed ribs as sharp as the bars of a harrow. At
the sight of the strangers he let the pot drop so that some of
its contents spilled and fizzled in the ashes, while his face was
drawn in an extreme terror. Yet it was a vacant terror, a
physical rather than a mental passion, for, while his cheeks and
mouth were contorted, his eyes remained dull and blind.</p>

<p>Simon sniffed, for the spilled food sent out a vile odour.</p>

<p>"We want lodgings and kindling for a fire," he said. "What of
the barn? Is the roof reasonable tight?"</p>

<p>The man only muttered, and it was the boy who answered.</p>

<p>"Tighter than this, master. There be store of faggots, too,
against the next deer-drive. But we have nought to do with the
place, for it belongs to Master Lee, the verderer."</p>

<p>"We will take Master Lee's permission for granted, for we
travel on the King's business. What have you in that pot?"</p>

<p>The man now spoke, his thin jaws working with a great effort,
and his voice was like a bat's squeak. But his speech, like the
boy's, was not that of an ordinary churl.</p>

<p>"Nothing, gentle sirs, but some nettle broth, with the
thickening of a dead partridge, half-plucked by a hawk, which
Dickon found in Waterman's Acre."</p>

<p>"The bird must have been dead a week," said Simon, screwing up
his nose.</p>

<p>"You speak truth, sir," said the man eagerly. "'Twas only
carrion, and therefore honestly come by for a poor man." And, all
the while his lips and eyes seemed to be twisting towards the
pot, as if he were in the last stage of famine.</p>

<p>"What is that on the straw?" Simon asked.</p>

<p>"My wife, noble sir. She has been dead twelve hours, and
Dickon and I wait for the snow to pass to bury her."</p>

<p>"Of what sickness?" Simon demanded in a sharpened voice, for
the whole world feared the plague.</p>

<p>"Of none. Of a lamentable lack of food. Dickon did not find
the partridge in time, and we have had nought for our bellies
this past sennight but hips and haws and beechmast."</p>

<p>Simon swung round. "Go on with your meal, brother. We will
camp in the barn and make use of Master Lee's faggots. We carry
food with us, so need not borrow yours."</p>

<p>Peter, whose stomach was turning at the stench of the pot and
the spectacle of the dead thing on the straw, followed him
hastily out of doors. The men were soon settled in the barn,
which proved to be tolerably water-tight, a fire was made and a
lantern lit, and the food wallets unpacked; while the horses were
tethered among some straw at the far end. When the meal was
eaten, Simon resaddled his beast.</p>

<p>"I must get me onward," he said, "for the storm seems to
abate. Farewell, Master Bonamy, and good speed to your journey!
If you will honour my humble dwelling of Boarstall I will show
you the work of the Italian chart-maker whom I spoke of." Then to
the men, "See you truss up that fellow when you lie down. If you
sleep like hogs, and he is unshackled, he will be over Severn by
the time you wake."</p>

<p>Peter's first intention had been to pass the night with the
others. But the sight of a patch of clear sky and a few stars
made him incline to follow Simon's example. He was not concerned
to deliver the gospeller to the Bishop's charge: that was for the
Bishop's servants, and the two Avelard men, now lying drunk many
miles in the rear. His business was to find Darking, and for that
he must get him to Mother Sweetbread. The distance was not more
than five miles, and he knew every cranny of the countryside.</p>

<p>So he, too, resaddled his horse, and with a word to the men to
go on to Oxford next day as they had been bidden, he opened the
door and flung his cloak about his shoulders. It had an odd
feeling, and, when he took it to the lantern, he realised that it
was Simon's cloak of grey frieze, and that his own, which was of
soft murry-coloured woollen from the Stour, was now on Simon's
back on the road to Boarstall. There was small loss in the
exchange, for the two men were much of a height.</p>

<p>Then another thought struck him. He picked up some of the
remains of the food, a piece of loaf, a knuckle of salted beef,
and a fragment of pie. There was enough left for the men to
breakfast off, and they would be in Oxford for the noontide meal.
He slung the viands in a corner of his cloak, and led his horse
to the hovel door.</p>

<p>The couple had finished their meal, for the pot was empty. The
man was picking his teeth with a bit of bone, and the boy was
scraping the pot. The fire had sunk, and the light was so dim
that he could not see the dead woman on the straw.</p>

<p>"Here are some broken meats," he said. "And see here, friend.
Here are also three silver pennies, that your wife may be
decently put in the earth."</p>

<p>The man scarcely lifted his head, but the boy seized eagerly
on the gifts.</p>

<p>"If I were found with those monies on me I would hang," said
the man.</p>

<p>"Nay, father, I know where I can spend them secretly," said
the boy. "And here be enough food to keep us for a week. God
bless ye, my lord."</p>

<p>The man cast one look to the corner, and shook his matted head
like a puzzled animal. "Would that God had sent him twelve hours
sooner, or that Dickon had been quicker in finding the bird." He
hunched himself again on the stool, and stared into the ashes.
There was neither sorrow nor regret in his voice, only
bewilderment.</p>

<p>The snow had gone, and there was sufficient clear sky to
permit of a faint starlight. Peter put his horse to a trot, for
he wished to put miles between him and that place of death and
famine. Fresh from the splendour of Avelard, he felt like a man
in thin raiment coming from a warm and scented room into a bitter
wind. To one brought up in the homely comfort of the Wychwood
cottage, and the simple abundance of Oseney, this sudden glimpse
of unimagined poverty was an awful revelation. He could not
banish the picture from his mind, as he rode through the slush of
the highway and the sprinkled meadows to Mother Sweetbread's
cottage high up on the skirts of Wychwood.</p>

<p>There he found the warm fire, and the lighted lamp, and the
old welcome. He stabled his horse in an outhouse commonly
occupied by forest ponies, and supped off a stew of game and a
cup of Mother Sweetbread's famous sloeberry wine.</p>

<p>"Solomon Darking left word that you were to follow him without
delay to Oxford," he was told. "You will find him, he said, at
the Swan tavern over against the Ox Pens. You were to go
secretly, and only under cover of night. . . . Now to bed with
you, Peterkin--for I will call you by no other name. You look as
weary as John Gowglass when he fled home from the night-riders on
Bartholomew Eve."</p>

<p>But Peter had not been three hours between Mother Sweetbread's
blankets, when he was roused by voices at the door, and found a
lean urchin gabbling a message to his hostess. At the sight of
him the boy slipped to his side, and in his eagerness took him by
the hands. It was the boy from the hovel, and his errand was
urgent. Someone had attacked the posse in the barn and released
the prisoner, setting him on the best horse. The Bishop's men had
been overpowered in their sleep . . . bound with ropes, too, and
had only freed themselves after the fugitives had been half an
hour gone. They had been in a great taking, and had gone to
Squire Fettiplace at Swinbrook, who was a zealous King's man and
would for certain mount his servants and scour the country. . . .
"They think it was you that done the deed, master," the boy
added, "for they swear they recognised the cloak of him that
mishandled them. . . . I heard them say that the villain was one
Bonamy, who had ridden with them from Avelard and decoyed them to
their undoing."</p>

<p>Peter's first impulse was to laugh. Simon Rede with the
borrowed cloak had bested him nobly.</p>

<p>"Haste ye, master," said the boy. "I followed ye here by your
horse's tracks. There is a powdering of snow and others can do
the same."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>

<h1>HOW PETER SAW DEATH IN THE SWAN INN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the light of Mother Sweetbread's rush candle Peter stared
at the sparrow-like child, and the sparrow-like child stared at
Peter.</p>

<p>There was no manner of doubt as to his peril. If the
Fettiplace men laid hands on him, he would have the evidence of
the Bishop's servants against him--honest evidence, for it would
rest upon the sight of his own cloak on the back of the man who
had freed the gospeller. To rebut it he must proclaim his
connection with Avelard and reveal the details of his journey,
and that meant that he, who for the moment must court obscurity,
would stand out glaringly to the whole shire--nay, even to Oxford
and the Bishop of Lincoln. The thing was not to be thought
of.</p>

<p>"I am trysted with Solomon in Oxford," he told the woman, "but
not till the dark hours, so I must get me to cover. I am for
Stowood. . . . Feed the child, mother, for he has earned it
well." Then to the boy, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"They call me Dickon," was the answer. "Dickon of the
Holt!"</p>

<p>"Then, Dickon, get you back the road you came. Put yourself in
the way of the Swinbrook men and let them drag from you news of
me. You saw me on the Witney road with the prisoner, riding like
one possessed. . . . This horse of mine, mother, you will send
into the forest till I can recover him. Hide him where no
Fettiplace can penetrate, for he is a damning link with Avelard.
Then give me some provender for the road, for I will be hungry
before to-morrow's e'en."</p>

<p>"This is the vigil of Hallowmas," said the old woman
anxiously. "'Tis an ill night to take to the greenwood."</p>

<p>"Better Hallowe'en witches than the rough hands of Squire
Fettiplace. Haste you, mother. I must be beyond Cherwell ere
daybreak."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Peter--cloakless, for he must travel
light--had slipped from the hut, where a hungry lad was supping
bear-meal porridge, and an old woman was saying spells by the
fire for his protection. The snow had ceased to fall, but it lay
an inch and more deep on the ground. The wind had dropped, a few
stars showed, and on the horizon there was the prelude of
moonrise. It was bitter cold, so he ran--first across the slushy
pastures, then through the scrub of the forest bounds, and then
by a path he knew, which in the shadow of the trees was almost
bare of snow, and which took him down the southern ridge of the
Evenlode vale.</p>

<p>Now that he had leisure to think, his anger surged up against
Simon Rede. The man was a foe to God, for he had freed a
heretic--Peter made the reflection mechanically and without
conviction, for it seemed to set his grievance on higher grounds
than his own pride. Simon was certainly an enemy to himself, for
he had deforced the Bishop's men in such a way as to lay the
blame on his innocent head. Doubtless, too, he had earlier in the
day made the two Avelard men drunk. For what purpose? To free the
gospeller? But why incriminate Peter?</p>

<p>He was of the opposite party, and must suspect something--Lord
Avelard had feared this--Sir Ralph Bonamy had feared it--that was
why he himself had had to take the road again. The man was as
cunning as he was bold. Peter thought bitterly of how he had
thawed to this enemy, and a few hours ago had looked on him
almost as a comrade. He remembered ruefully his admiration of the
man's carriage and conversation. And he had been nobly duped. The
stolen cloak, the tale of a journey post-haste to Boarstall, the
friendly parting--every incident rankled in his memory. . . .
Well, it was for him to defeat Master Simon's conspiracies. He
had something against him--the knowledge, the certain knowledge,
that he was in league with those who defied the King's grace in
matters of religion. . . . And then he laughed sardonically, for
he himself was about to defy the King's grace in things of
greater moment.</p>

<p>He strove to keep his mind on the notion that Simon's
hostility to him was because of state policy. But it would not
stay there. The unpleasing reflection would edge its way in that
the cause was Sabine Beauforest. The man had not come to Avelard
to please Crummle's commissary, but to be near the girl. Of that
he was as certain as that he was now stumbling through the scrub
oaks above Evenlode with owls hooting like lost souls around him.
Presently the thought became a conviction, and the conviction an
oppression. Simon was a rival, a deadly rival, and he had won the
first bout by turning the heir of Avelard into a mockery. He saw
that lean face puckered with mirth, and those cool, arrogant,
contemptuous eyes, and he had a miserable consciousness of
weakness in the face of such an antagonist. Decked with the pomp
of Avelard he could condescend on one who was no more than a
squire of modest estate, but now Simon was mounted and fronting
the world, while he was afoot and a fugitive.</p>

<p>In his depression the picture of Sabine seemed to limn itself
on the dark night--Sabine, not as he had last seen her,
distracted and sullen, but Sabine on that night when she had
opened her arms to him, her pale loveliness suddenly become a
fire. Once he had thought of a fair woman as something dim and
infinitely distant, like a sickle moon in an April twilight. Now
he had seen the fairest of all, her eyes dewy with kindness, her
lips tremulous with surrender. . . . The picture entranced and
maddened him, but it also drove Simon Rede from his head. He was
Bohun, and his business was to win in the lists which had been
set for him. To victory there all other things would be added,
chief of which was a laughing girl.</p>

<p>Before dawn the snow returned, big powdery flakes with no wind
behind them. In a crook of Bladon heath, just outside the
deer-park of Woodstock, he stumbled upon a small encampment of
horse-priggers, round a hissing fire. Half a dozen weedy garrons,
with their heads muffled in sacking, were tethered near by. John
Naps's watchword saved him a slit throat, and secured him a bed
of moderately dry bracken and enough of the fire to warm his
toes. There he slept till an hour after daybreak, when he was
roused by the encampment shifting ground. He breakfasted on some
of the food he had brought from Mother Sweetbread, distrusting
the stew of the priggers. The ruffians were civil enough and a
little abashed in his presence, for Flatsole ruled the clan with
an iron hand. They showed some relief when he prepared to leave
them, and they gave him a useful bit of news. Catti the Welshman
was in the alehouse at Gosford, lying hid because of a broken
rib. Peter must find a place to spend the daylight hours, and in
such weather he preferred the shelter of a roof to a cold hollow
of Stowood. Where Catti lay he might reckon on a safe
sanctuary.</p>

<p>The snow grew heavier as he crossed the open moorlands towards
the sharp spire of Kidlington church. He skirted the village and
came to the tiny hamlet of Gosford, hard upon a ford of Cherwell.
He remembered the alehouse, a pleasant place where, in a garden
beside a colony of bees, he had had many a summer draught. Now
the bush at its door was turned upside down--the innkeeper's sign
that there was sickness in the hostelry and that no guests could
be entertained. There was an utter silence in the hamlet, not a
soul showed or a dog stirred, nothing but the even descent of the
snow. But behind doors and windows he seemed to catch a glimpse
of furtive faces.</p>

<p>Peter made for the back-quarters of the tavern. There he found
a sluttish girl plucking a cockerel, and tossing the white
feathers to mix with the falling snow. "Will you carry a message,
Mother Goose," said Peter, "to him who lodges here?"</p>

<p>"There be no one lodging here, master," she said. "Feyther has
the autumn sickness, and mother is new brought to bed."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you will take my message and give it to whom
you will," and he spoke the first part of John Naps's
watchword.</p>

<p>She looked up at Peter, and, seeing him young and
well-favoured, relaxed her stubbornness. She flung the
half-plucked fowl to him with a laugh. "I dare not idle, master,
with all the work of the house on my hands. Do 'ee finish my job
and I will carry your word indoors."</p>

<p>In an instant she was back, giggling.</p>

<p>"Feyther he says, 'Far as to Peter's gate.' What play be it,
master? Wychwood's no more'n six miles."</p>

<p>"Say, 'Alack, I shall not be there in time.'"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Ay, that was what I was bidden wait for. Come 'ee
indoors, but first shake the clots from your feet, lest you muck
up my floor."</p>

<p>Catti was not in the house, but in a chamber, the remnant of
an old priory, which was connected with the building by a vaulted
passage. There he lay on a couch of straw and rags in a darkness
illumined only by a brazier which burned beside him and such
light as came from above through the slats of the roof. But even
in the dimness Peter saw the beetle brows and the fierce black
eyes and the hilt of a long knife.</p>

<p>The man was genial and open, for Naps's pass was clearly a
master word. When he heard that Peter--whose name he did not
ask--was on his way to meet Darking and in some peril from the
law, he became reassuring. Peter was safe for the daylight hours,
and what easier than to slip into Oxford by the east gate in
weather which would keep the inquisitive at home? Thereafter
Solomon would see to him, Solomon who could, if he wanted, pass a
red-handed felon through the guards of a palace.</p>

<p>He had got his own hurt on the Worcester road. It was near
healed, and he proposed to move towards London, where trade would
be brisk, since the King's law was gone Lincoln way. Peter, with
Lord Avelard's talk in his head, was amazed to find how well
informed this bandit was on every matter they had spoken of with
hushed voices. He knew what was stirring on the western marches,
and named the very numbers which Neville and Latimer had under
arms.</p>

<p>Peter asked about Simon Rede, and Catti scratched his
head.</p>

<p>"He is a ready man with his blade," he said, "as some of us
know to our cost. But he is merry, too, and Boarstall has a good
name among us wandering folk. They say he is hot for some new
thing called Gospel, which the King mislikes. There are many that
hate him, but more that fear him, and he goes his own road
unquestioned. . . . Nay, he is not one of us. They say that
Gospel is harder on an honest man than the King's justices. Job
Cherryman that took up with it fell to groaning and weeping and
died of a wasting in a twelvemonth. 'Tis some madness of the
gentles, and not for the poor."</p>

<p>Peter ate the rest of his food in Catti's company, and noted
how messages came all day to the recluse--a head thrust past the
door, a question asked and answered, all in the jargon which he
had heard at Little Greece. When the time came for him to leave,
Catti appointed a ragged urchin to show him the road down the
right bank of Cherwell.</p>

<p>"You are well served," said Peter.</p>

<p>Catti laughed. "Needs must in a trade like mine. This morning,
master, you came from Brother Friday's priggers on Bladon heath.
I had news of you before you passed Kidlington granges, and, had
you not come from honest company, you had never had speech with
Cis here, and gotten entrance to this cell of mine."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>An hour after dark Peter entered Oxford by the side-gate
adjoining Magdalen College. The snow had passed, and the air had
sharpened to a still frost, but a light fog held the upper
heavens, and there was no moon or star. There had been a glow by
the east gate, which lit up everything, for Magdalen College,
which was without the city wall, had fired a great bonfire to
drive away the plague. The High Street was dark in patches, but
opposite University College there was a glare also, for in its
quadrangle was another bonfire. Though the hour was yet early,
the place seemed empty and quiet. Farther on, where Peter had to
grope his way to avoid the swollen gutter, there came the music
of an organ and young voices across the way. Peter remembered
that it was the Eve of All Souls, and that, according to custom,
masses were being sung in Chichele's college for the repose of
the dead fallen in France. There was an echo of singing, too,
from Brasenose, and Haberdashers' Hall had lights in all its
upper windows. But beyond that it was very dark. The Ram inn had
shut its outer door, so that only a narrow thread of light
escaped to the cobbles. The flesher near by had shuttered his
shop, but the carcase of a buck from Shotover was hanging outside
from a hook of the balcony, and Peter's forehead took the beast's
rump with such force that he sat down heavily in the slush.</p>

<p>At the place called Quarvex, where the church of St Martin
hung above the meeting of four streets, stood a stone seat called
the Pennyless Bench, built for the comfort of the market-folk.
The little square was deserted, and Peter stepped out with more
confidence, for he was now on the confines of the west part of
the city, which was his own quarter. But from the shadows of the
Pennyless Bench a voice spoke:</p>

<p>"'Tis a raw night to go cloakless, friend," it said.</p>

<p>Peter started and slipped in a puddle of snow. He understood
now that the faint glow from the east window of the church must
have illumined his figure to one sitting in the shadows.
Moreover, he knew the voice. He took a step forward, and saw in
the corner of the bench what seemed to be the figure of a tall
man.</p>

<p>Even as he stared the figure twitched a cloak from its
shoulders and tossed it towards him.</p>

<p>"Take it, friend," said the voice. "You have the better right
to it." And Peter caught in his hands his own murry-coloured
cloak of woollen.</p>

<p>The voice spoke again.</p>

<p>"You would fly at my throat, but I pray you consider. This is
no place to brawl for one or t'other of us. Also you are unarmed,
and I bear a sword. Doubtless I used you scurvily last night, but
I had weighty reasons, which some day I may recount to you. Thank
God for a restored garment, and go in peace."</p>

<p>Peter's anger flared up at the cool air of authority.</p>

<p>"I have no sword, but, if you are a man, you will unbuckle
yours. Come with me across Bookbinders bridge to a corner I know
of where we may be undisturbed. There I will fight you with the
weapons that God gave us both at birth, and bring you to task for
last night's work."</p>

<p>A laugh came from the shadow.</p>

<p>"'Twould be good play, doubtless, and would warm our blood in
this nipping weather. But I have no time for such sport, nor,
methinks, have you, Master Bonamy. I am within easy hail of
Boarstall, but you are very far from Avelard. Get you to Oseney
and your supper."</p>

<p>There was a noise farther down the Cornmarket street and a
sudden gleam of light, which announced the watch.</p>

<p>"I have but to wait," Peter said, "and proclaim that you are
he that loosed the heretic from the Bishop's men."</p>

<p>Again the man laughed. "You would not be credited," he said.
"I am better known in Oxford town than the reputed heir of my
Lord Avelard out of the west country. Besides"--he
paused--"bethink you what, if so minded, I could proclaim of you.
Begone, my priestling. A cell at Oseney is healthier for you than
the cobbles of Quarvex on a November night."</p>

<p>The sound of the oncoming watch grew nearer, and Peter let
prudence govern his temper. This was not the place or hour for a
reckoning with Simon Rede. He flung the cloak round his
shoulders, and turned down a lane that led to the Castle. He was
angry and shamed. Once again his enemy had had the laugh of him,
and at the thought of the scornful merriment in Simon's voice he
shivered, but not with the cold.</p>

<p>It was darker and quieter among the lanes beside the Castle
which sloped to the river. Down in Fisherrow there were moving
lights, and high in the sky Peter saw the lamp in the bell-tower
of Oseney. Even as he gazed Thomas began to strike the hour of
eight. He passed no one except a lay brother hurrying to Rewley,
and a party of young bloods from one of the colleges, who had
come from hawking in Botley fen, and had been making a great
clamour at the west gate. At the said gate a band of west-country
clothiers were setting out, hoping to lie the night at Witney, so
as to make Gloucester on the morrow. Peter slipped round the
shaggy cavalcade, and found himself without the walls, on the
Oseney causeway.</p>

<p>From there it was but a step to the Ox Pens, a piece of open
ground where a cattle-market was held of a Tuesday. Beyond it was
a cluster of small houses, huddled round the approach to the
river bridge called the Fennel. It was rough going, for the
ground was slippery with dung and offal, and there were many miry
puddles now crackling with frost. The Swan tavern was not hard to
find, for it had an open door from which slanted a broad band of
light that illuminated a white swan on a scarlet ground on a
board surmounting a pollarded willow. The place, now that
Thomas's strokes had died on the night, was as silent as the
heart of Wychwood. Even the lit tavern made no sound.</p>

<p>It was a very humble place, but the rushes on the floor were
fresh and the logs on the hearth crackled cheerfully. There was
no one there.</p>

<p>Peter shook the powder of snow from his cloak, stamped his
feet clear, and warmed himself at the blaze. The place had the
air of a room much frequented and expecting guests. He called
loudly for a drawer.</p>

<p>A little girl peeped round the corner of an inner door, and
laid her finger on her lips, her eyes wide with apprehension.</p>

<p>"Whisht!" she said. "Ye manna make no noise--he be near his
dead-throes."</p>

<p>"Master Darking?" Peter began, but the child had gone. He
noticed that at least a dozen lights, besides that of the fire,
were burning in the little room, so that the place was as bright
as a high altar at Candlemas. There was no sound except the logs
crackling. The door was pinned open to its widest, and from the
silent tavern an eerie radiance flooded out into the silent
night.</p>

<p>Peter felt a spell creeping upon him. He took off his cloak,
sat down on a stool, and stared into the fire. This was the place
that Darking had appointed, and his task was done in coming here.
Meantime he could rest, for he felt listless and out of
temper.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on his arm, and he saw that it was Darking,
who had come in by the door through which the child had peeped.
He wore a townsman's clothes, so that he looked like some
prosperous trader, save for his lean, outland face.</p>

<p>"God's mercy has brought you here, my lord," he said. "I
feared my message would not be in time, or that you might have
some pressing business at Avelard. But indeed no business could
be more pressing than this. One lies dying in this house that has
something to say to you."</p>

<p>Darking pulled another stool to the hearth.</p>

<p>"'Tis the outcome of Mother Sweetbread's care and the spells
of Madge of Shipton. They have sought treasure for you, and maybe
they have found it. . . . You have heard of the great Lord
Lovell?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded. "Him that died after the Stoke battle--drowned
in Trent?"</p>

<p>"Nay, he did not drown in Trent. He came in secret to his own
house of Minster Lovell, and what befell him after that is known
only to God. But he is dead long since, for that is fifty years
back. But mark you what manner of man was this Francis Lovell.
With Catesby and Ratcliffe he ruled the land under King Richard.
You have heard the country rhyme:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'The Cat, the Rat, and Lovell our dog<br>
 Ruled all England under the Hog.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He brought your grandsire, Harry of Buckingham, to his death,
and got his office of Constable. He had the plundering of the
whole nation, and, being no spender, he amassed uncounted riches.
Where, think you, has that wealth gone? Harry the King had never
a groat of it. 'Tis buried somewhere among the ruinous courts of
Minster Lovell, and it may be yours for the finding. A third of
it, my lord, would give you the sinews of war, and make you
master indeed, for you would have your own privy purse, and be
dependent on none."</p>

<p>Peter was stirred to the liveliest interest. "But what hope? .
. . Who can know? . . ."</p>

<p>"Listen! My tale goes on. At Minster Lovell there was one
household thirled above all others to the wicked lord. Its name
was Blackthorn, and Giles Blackthorn was at my lord's bridle hand
in all his iniquity. Where Lovell pricked Blackthorn slew, and
where Lovell pinched Blackthorn skinned. Well, this Giles died
beyond question on Stoke field from an arrow in the throat, but
he left a widow more evil than himself. 'Twas to Mother
Blackthorn at Minster Lovell that my lord fled after his cause
had gone down, and Mother Blackthorn alone knew what end he made.
She lived for but a month after Stoke, and died in the terrors of
hell, screaming that she could not leave her lord, and, as I have
been told, being held down in bed by four men to control her
frenzy. With her an ugly stock passed out of the world, save for
her son Jack. He had been page to Lovell, and had been at Stoke
with him and had accompanied him home, and, though only a
stripling, was as wicked as his master. Whatever black secrets
Lovell had this Rustling Jack, as they called him, was their sure
repository. After his mother's death he disappeared, like my
lord, and was believed long since to be in the devil's hands. But
it seems the world was wrong. He was in far countries, fighting
for the Spaniards, and a prisoner for years among the heathen.
Now, by the arts of Goody Littlemouse, he has been
discovered."</p>

<p>"Where?" Peter asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"In this very house, where he is now at the point of death.
The priest of St Thomas awaits to shrive him. But he cannot save
his soul by confession like a Christian, for it seems that he has
done things which cannot be told even to holy ears. Also he has
some restitution to make, and till he make it his soul will not
leave his body. He has a horror of darkness on him, and that is
why these lights burn. Also he has a horror of sound, and cries
that the pealing of Oseney bells are the yells of the
damned."</p>

<p>"What has he to restore?"</p>

<p>"My guess is that it is the clue to Lovell's treasure. Mother
Littlemouse, who has her own ways of getting knowledge, is
assured that he has such a secret in his keeping. But he will not
surrender it to any chance comer. He cries out for one of the
blood of Lovell to help him die. You, my lord, are of that blood,
for Lovell and Stafford and Bohun were all intermingled. They
say, too, that you are the living image of your grandsire, Duke
Harry. Maybe, when he sees you, he may be moved to make you his
confessor. But we must make haste, for his thread of life wears
thin."</p>

<p>The boy's mood in a violent revulsion was now one of excited
triumph. It seemed like God's hand leading him by strange paths
to recover that heritage of which he had been harshly robbed.
Lovell's treasure was Buckingham's treasure, since Lovell had
clomb to power on Buckingham's ruin. . . . A sudden memory gave
him assurance. The sign of this place was the swan, and the swan
was the badge of Bohun.</p>

<p>The frontage of the tavern was narrow, but the building was
deep, since behind it lay a nest of small rooms, dug out of a
fragment of old masonry which may have gone back to Norman days.
Peter found himself in a crooked passage, blazing with tallow
dips in iron sconces. There was a little window with a broken
hasp, through which came eddies of air that set the lights
smoking. As he passed it he had a glimpse without of swollen
rushing waters. This place abutted on the river--a fine strategic
point for lawless folk.</p>

<p>Darking ushered him into a big room which looked like the
girnel of an ancient mill. Here, too, many lights blazed, which
revealed the cobwebbed rafters, the floor deep in dust, and a
vast rusty pin projecting from the wall. On a pallet in the
centre lay the dying man, with beside him an old woman, the
inn-wife, who from time to time moistened his lips with sour
wine. A man in a priest's gown stood by the far wall, a timid
youth who was busy with his beads. As they entered Darking fell
back, the old woman rose and withdrew to the priest's side, and
Peter found himself alone by the pallet, looking down at a grey
face distorted with fear.</p>

<p>The man whom they called Rustling Jack was very old. His neck
was a mere string of sinews, his cheeks were fallen into ghastly
hollows, and the lips he moved incessantly were blue like the
blackthorn fruit. A great scar ran athwart his brow, and the
wrists which lay on the coverlet were grooved deep with the
manacles which had once attached him to his oar in the Moors'
galleys. The eyes were shut, and through his clenched teeth came
a slow moaning.</p>

<p>Peter stood awestruck, regarding the tortured face. He had
never seen a man die, and this one was having a cruel passage. In
spite of age and weakness the man on the pallet seemed to him a
fearful thing, for on his face was printed as in a book a long
odyssey of evil.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw that the eyes had opened and were staring at
him, and so hungry was their stare that he stepped back a pace. A
voice filtered painfully between the lips.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" it croaked. "In God's name what are you that
vexes me? Your name? Your name? You have eyes I mind of. . .
."</p>

<p>"I am Bohun," said Peter, and he was not conscious of what he
said.</p>

<p>There came an exulting laugh.</p>

<p>"There is no Bohun in England--not these fifty years--it is
Lovell I see--Lovell."</p>

<p>"I am the grandson of Henry of Buckingham."</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence came into the frenzied eyes.</p>

<p>"You are Henry of Buckingham. . . . I saw him die at Salisbury
. . . his head rolled a good yard beyond the sawdust, and I
sopped my kerchief in the blood of it. . . . Yea, you have his
eyes . . . he had pretty eyes to beguile hearts, but they could
not save him. . . . Harry Stafford . . . my lord liked him
ill."</p>

<p>A last spasm of life galvanised him into action. He half
raised himself, and Peter saw the neck muscles knot like
eggs.</p>

<p>"Be you from Heaven or Hell I care not . . . Lovell slew you,
but you have Lovell's blood, and I summon you to give my master
peace. If you are a blessed one, I plead in Christ's name. My
lord never leaves me . . . his voice whinnies and sobs in my
ears, and I cannot go to meet him till I have done his commands.
Angel or devil, I charge you to lay his spirit. . . . Listen. . .
. Bend down, ghost, for my breath is short. . . ."</p>

<p>Peter bent till his ear was close to the dying man's lips. The
words came slow and faint but very clear. <i>"The west
court,"</i> it said, <i>"the corner under the dovecot. . . .
Three paces from the east wall. . . .</i> Haste ye in the name of
God the Father and God the Son and . . ."</p>

<p>He fell back choking on the bed, and at the same moment all
the lights in the room swayed and flickered as if from a rush of
wind. Peter, white with awe, thought it was the waft of death,
till he saw that the door by which he had entered had opened, and
that the scared little girl he had already seen was standing in
it. There was a noise beyond as of men's heavy feet and men's
speech.</p>

<p>At the same moment he felt Darking's hand on his arm. "You
have the word?" was his excited whisper. "Then this is no place
for you and me. There are men here seeking Jack, and they will
find only clay. Quick--follow me."</p>

<p>Someone in a hurry blew out the lights, all but two at the bed
head and one at the foot. Peter found himself dragged by Darking
into a passage, narrower than that by which they had entered, and
dark as a pit. Presently cold air blew in his face, and he was at
a window, through which he was made to clamber. "Drop," said
Darking's voice, and he was sprawling in the bottom of a wherry,
riding on a rough current. A second later Darking joined him,
untied a mooring rope, and took up the oars, and the boat shot
under the bridge called the Fennel.</p>

<p>"You heard the words clear," Darking asked, and made Peter
repeat them. "God be thanked, my lord. 'Twas a race between us
and the Devil, and we won by a hair."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c09">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<h1>THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Darking drew in to a corner of the upper Fisherrow which made
a tiny wharf, and shipped the oars. The flurries of snow had
ceased, and the air had become still and very cold. Thomas of
Oseney rang the hour of ten, and his notes lingered long in the
black vault of night. When they had died away, there was no sound
in the world but the swirl of the flooded river.</p>

<p>"We must get a bed for the night," said Darking, stamping his
feet against the chill, "and be off by dawn for Wychwood. Goody
Littlemouse must lend her aid, for this is a dark business, my
lord, and must be done very secretly and in the night."</p>

<p>Peter shivered. He could not banish from his memory the
possessed face and the tortured eyes of the dying man in that
room of many lights.</p>

<p>"I do not venture near Minster Lovell except in holy company.
Brother Tobias goes with us, or I stir not a yard. God save us,
Solomon, but there is a fearsome relish of damnation about this
business."</p>

<p>Darking looked at him sharply. "So be it. Your purpose is
honest, my lord, and you but recover your own, but it is true
that the Devil walks wherever Lovell trod. . . . Now for bed. We
can lie at Mother Shabbit's in Titmouse Lane."</p>

<p>Peter did not dare himself to enter Oseney. Though his clothes
were no more clerkly, and his recent life had changed his colour,
yet he could not hope to conceal himself from those who had seen
him daily in chapel and fratry. So Darking did his errand, and
brought him word that Tobias was engaged with the holy business
of All-Hallows day and could not leave Oxford till the next
morning. The weather was setting to heavy frost, and Peter had no
mind to spend the day shivering in the bed-loft of Mother
Shabbit's tavern. He left Darking to make the necessary
arrangements for the morrow, since Tobias was an old man who must
ride and needed a sober beast to carry him. Darking should bring
him to Mother Sweetbread's before dark on the following day,
while Peter would go on ahead and await him there.</p>

<p>So early in the forenoon he took the road on foot, out of the
west gate and along the Botley causeway to where the highway to
the west country ran between Wytham hill and the shaggy slopes of
Cumnor. The sky was an icy blue, and an east wind blew sharp into
his back, and on the flood-waters skeins of wildfowl squattered
among the crackling cat-ice. The highroad was busy that day, for,
besides the usual pack trains, and a variety of religious padding
it between Oxford and Eynsham, he passed three armed companies
swinging in from Gloucestershire. These men were the King's
levies, on their way to the King's army in Lincoln, and the sight
of them cheered him. The fewer of that breed left in the west the
better for his cause.</p>

<p>From Swynford bridge, where he crossed a swollen Thames, he
took a short cut over the downland and forestland which make a
barrier between Evenlode and Windrush. His head was full of war,
for the tramp of horses and the clatter of harness had power to
intoxicate him. He had forgotten his scruples and his qualms; the
dying face in the Swan inn was no longer an ironic comment on
human glory. The biting air and the free movement of his limbs on
the winter turf had revived in his blood the pride of life. . . .
Lord Avelard was the master strategist! Peter saw, as in a view
from a hilltop, the King (he pictured him as fat and buxom in a
suit of gold tissue) sore pressed in the fenlands by a horde of
churls who welcomed death in their certainty of heaven; and all
the while a vast silent gathering drawing from north and west and
creeping like a dark shadow ever nearer the doomed tyrant, who
for his lusts had made England sorrow. He saw pallor steal over
the ruddy cheeks and fear dawn in the witless eyes. And at the
head of the shadow he saw the swan of Bohun. . . . What was his
own place? Was he no more than a watchword, a badge, an
oriflamme? That had been his dread, but the dread was gone. If he
were the paymaster he would be leader, not in name but in deed.
It seemed as if God had moved in the matter to make plain his
road, and the hot blood of youth and the clerk's conscience were
alike at peace under this assurance of celestial favour.</p>

<p>He came to Mother Sweetbread's cottage just before the sun
sank in a fiery haze over Cotswold. As he forded Windrush, where
the ice was forming on the edge of the slack water, he saw, a
mile behind him, the towers of Minster Lovell glowing blood-red
in the sunsetting. He halted to gaze, and the sight made him
uneasy. Somewhere in that maze of dark stones lay the treasure
which was to ensure his triumph--that was what he told himself,
but he found his heart incredulous. The place, a jumble of ink
and blood and murky gold, seemed too fantastic for
earth--unhallowed, too, a thing founded on lust and death and lit
terribly by the fires of hell. He remembered how in his boyish
days the name of Lovell had been a dark spell, and how, except in
bright weather, no one had dared to go near that castle by the
stream. In its shadow even Windrush lost its speed, and flowed
stagnant and dim under the battlements. He was thankful that he
had summoned Tobias to his aid, for he needed all that was of
good report behind him.</p>

<p>To his amazement there was no sign of life in Mother
Sweetbread's cottage. There was no candle, no fire on the hearth,
no food on the table, though the door was unbarred according to
the forest custom. Mother Sweetbread had clearly gone
a-journeying.</p>

<p>Peter lit a fire, and found food in the cupboard, on which he
made his supper. Then, for no reason which he could give, he
dropped the heavy bar over the door, and clamped the window
shutters. He was ill at ease, for he could not rid himself of the
memory of that grim tower not a mile off, where none had dwelt
for half a century. Nothing human, at least, but God knew what
things of the night had made their lair in it. The picture of it
as seen in the cold twilight filled his mind. It had seemed to be
awaiting him, beckoning him, offering some dark commerce. . . .
Thank God, he was above it now, three hundred feet nearer Heaven,
and close to the friendly beasts of the forest. He stretched
himself on his foster-mother's bed, close to the hearth, and fell
instantly asleep, but he had ill dreams. Door and windows
rattled, though the night was bound still in frost. The first
time he woke he started at a crooked shadow which ran towards
him, till he saw that it was caused by the dying spurt of a log
on the hearth. Twice he woke again and each time he seemed to
hear the beating of great wings without, and had much ado to
compose his mind with prayers. He commended his soul and his
cause to God.</p>

<p>"I am only His instrument," he told himself, "I follow where
He leads, and, whether it be His will to break me or to exalt me,
I am content." But in his heart he knew that he lied.</p>

<p>Morning brought a heavy sky and a fiercer cold, but it brought
to Peter some peace of mind. He unbarred door and windows, and
let in the grey light. With his teeth chattering, he revived the
fire, fetched water from the well which rarely froze, and made
himself some porridge. He laved his face and breast and arms, and
set his blood moving by a brisk run in the forest clearing. He
returned to the cottage to find that Mother Sweetbread had
returned, and with her an ancient woman whose face was waxen with
age, but whose eyebrows and the hair on a mole on her chin were
black as jet.</p>

<p>His foster-mother clasped him in her arms. "Woe is me," she
cried, "that you should come to my house and get so cold a
welcome! You found food and firing, you say? . . . But you had to
get it for yourself, Peterkin, and that is no task for a great
man. . . . I durst not sleep the night here, for there are devils
unloosed--I could hear them whimpering in the dark--so I took
shelter with Mother Littlemouse, and Madge has come back with me
to bear me company."</p>

<p>The little old witch-wife looked him over with eyes like pits
of bog-water.</p>

<p>"You have my ring on your finger, my lord," she said, "so no
ill can hurt you yet awhile. When do the others come?"</p>

<p>Peter told her that Darking would appear before evening, and
with him Brother Tobias. At the name of the latter Mother
Sweetbread cried out with delight, but Madge looked grave. "He
cannot go where you must go, my lord. It is decreed that he that
would challenge the spirits of earth must challenge them alone. A
priest will scare them and wound their dignity. The Church, on
which be blessings, has its own land, and these spirits have
theirs, and God has ruled that for the time the boundaries shall
be fixed. . . . You were no more than in time at the Swan inn. It
was needful that you saw him they call the Rustler before his
death, and I sat at Shipton sweating with fear lest you should be
too late. He died three minutes and twenty seconds after you left
him."</p>

<p>"How did you learn? . . ." Peter began.</p>

<p>"Hush, sir, and ask not," said Mother Sweetbread. "Madge here
has her own ways of knowledge."</p>

<p>The witch-wife regarded him with placid eyes.</p>

<p>"The day before yesterday I followed your every step after you
left the priggers' camp at Bladon. I watched you visit Master
Catti, and saw you creep into Oxford and have words with a
certain one at Quarvex. I could have wept with vexation at every
minute you tarried, for I saw also the Rustler with the breath
choking in his throat."</p>

<p>"You saw?" Peter stammered.</p>

<p>"I saw, but with the eye of spirit, not the eye of flesh. I
have woven a chain 'twixt you and me, which keeps me aware of all
your doings. Ask me not how, for that is my secret."</p>

<p>"And with Rustling Jack?"</p>

<p>"With him I have long had such a chain, for once we were
lovers."</p>

<p>"Tell me of to-night. Is there indeed treasure at Minster
Lovell? Shall I harvest it?"</p>

<p>"I cannot foretell what God decrees is to come to pass. My
knowledge is only of things that already are in being. But this I
can tell you. There's that in Minster Lovell which the Rustler
valued as dear as his own life, and which the Lord Lovell valued
no less. 'Tis for you to guess what that can be. . . ."</p>

<p>She flung a sort of cowl over her face and withdrew to a
corner. "I would be alone now, that I may be busied with arts for
your safety this night. Yon earth is as full of dark spirits as
there are rooks in Shipton copse, and, Tobias or no, it behoves
us to go warily. Many a time the earth devils have played their
pranks upon a holy man."</p>

<p>Peter walked the woods that day, the favoured haunts of his
childhood, and his mood was high. He had no doubt as to what the
coming night would bring forth. He saw himself able to speak with
Avelard and Exeter, with Neville and Latimer, as a potent equal.
As one who supplied the sinews of war he would have a final word
in that war's purpose. He told himself--this to his clerk's
conscience--that thus he would keep pure the purpose of the
crusade--for God and His Church and the poor commons of England.
But deep down in his heart he knew that he had other thoughts.
Ambition welled fiercely within him. The nipping air wrought upon
his head. His imagination was full of trampling horses and bright
swords and banners, the mad cheering of multitudes, thrones and
palaces and soft raiment, the soft eyes of fair women. . . . From
a high point in the forest he looked down on Wychwood and saw the
blur of Minster Lovell among its trees. The place had no longer
any power to affright him. The old pale ghost of its dead lord
was an obedient shadow, waiting to surrender its charge before it
fled to its appointed torment.</p>

<p>As the day drew to evening the clouds mounted in the east,
clouds like foul wool with leaden shadows. "Winter is early upon
us," said Mother Sweetbread; "there was not a swallow in the
eaves by mid-September, and they are the birds that know." The
dark had fallen before Brother Tobias's cob, led by Darking, came
up the road from the ford. Tobias was in a sad humour. The
journey had tired his bones, and the lowering weather depressed
one accustomed to sheltered Oseney, for in his old age it was not
his custom to go abroad except when the sun shone. Also he
mistrusted his errand, for Lovell was a name of ill omen. "God's
blessing never went with aught of that breed," he told Peter,
"and belike it will not go with their gear."</p>

<p>"But it will be spent for an honest purpose," said Peter.
<i>"Pecunia non olet."</i></p>

<p>Tobias wrinkled his nose, as if he doubted the truth of the
adage.</p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread set supper before them, and drew Madge of
Shipton from her solitary communings. The little old witch-wife
went on her knees to Tobias and sought his blessing, which was
given with a doubting face. Then she seemed to take command of
the party. Her toothless mumbling changed into a tone of
authority; alone of them she seemed to know not the goal only but
the road to it. She bade Darking get mattock and pick from the
Sweetbread store, for, said she, "The frost has bound the earth,
and earth lies heavy on that which we seek." The keys of the
outer curtilage and the keep had been long in Mother Sweetbread's
care, and these were sought out, a mighty bunch of rusted iron
strung on a strip of cowhide. "But these are not the keys we
seek," said the witch-wife. "There are deeps in Lovell's castle
which no mortal key will unlock. For these we have the Rustler's
word." Nor would she allow them to start till she gave the
signal. "Let the daylight get out of the earth and the night
currents begin to move. We can work only under the blanket of the
dark."</p>

<p>When at last they left the cottage the night was thick as a
cloak round them, windless and piercing cold. Darking had a
lantern and guided them by a track down a shaggy slope, among
scrub of thorn and holly. The old women marched like soldiers,
but Brother Tobias stumbled often and leaned heavily on Peter's
arm. "I am afraid, son Peter," he murmured. "This is no work for
a priest. . . . I doubt if it be work for any Christian man, but
in these days a Christian must have a stout stomach."</p>

<p>They skirted swampy meadows fringed by elders, which rustled
eerily, though there was now no wind. Then suddenly they came on
a little church, where the altar had long lacked servers; the
slats were falling from its roof, and its north door stood open
to the weather. There were roofless huts beside it, and
nettle-grown heaps of stones, and beyond a dark mass like a
mountain.</p>

<p>"There is no entrance this way," said Darking. "We must seek
the Water-gate." So with difficulty they picked their way through
ruinous closes till the lantern caught the tides of Windrush,
which here drowsed in long lagoons. There was a postern half
blocked by a fallen lintel, through which they squeezed. "This is
the west court," said Darking, and an owl seemed to echo the
whisper.</p>

<p>It was a strange place, grown thick with grass, with on three
sides of it walls which beetled like crags. Fifty years had
worked a ruin. The paving was broken into hollows, and every now
and then a trickle of falling masonry sounded above them.</p>

<p>"Now where in God's name is the dovecot?" Darking asked,
flashing his lantern upon the precipitous sides, and was told by
Madge Littlemouse, "The northeast corner." Sure enough in the far
angle the echo which their feet awoke was answered from above by
a sound of wings. There were still pigeons making their home in
that round tower on the roof which no man had entered for half a
century.</p>

<p>"This is the place," said Darking. "Three paces from the east
wall was the Rustler's word." He started back. "Others have been
here!"</p>

<p>What they saw was an opening in the ground made by the removal
of a heavy slab. Steps ran down, green with ferns and slime.
Darking turned the lantern on them. "Nay, these have not been
trodden for a hundred years. This is some ancient doing." He
descended as far as the steps allowed. "Something has fallen," he
announced out of the depths. "Reach me a mattock. It is only soil
and rubble."</p>

<p>He wrought for some minutes, flinging out shovelfuls above
their heads. Then he stopped. "There is a door," he said. "I
think it opens inwards." There came a sound of heavy blows, then
a splintering and rending, and the falling forward of a heavy
body. Presently Darking emerged spitting earth from his mouth.
"The door is gone rotten with age. Beyond is a passage in which a
man may creep. The Rustler no doubt spoke truth. But let us clear
our wits before we take the next step, for we may be on the edge
of dangerous things."</p>

<p>Peter shivered violently. His eagerness had not died in him,
but it was blanketed by a weight of nameless fears. The black
night, the echoing cavern of the court, the cold which froze even
his young blood, seemed to lay a palsy on his mind. He had
pictured an adventurous journey among vaults, a treasure-hunt in
brisk company; instead he seemed to be standing on the brink of a
noisome tomb.</p>

<p>He screwed up his courage.</p>

<p>"I go," he said. "I am the chosen one."</p>

<p>Madge Littlemouse croaked. "He goes. He is the chosen one. And
he goes alone."</p>

<p>But Tobias broke in. "Nay, that he does not. I go with him.
Whatever is beneath ground we face together."</p>

<p>The witch-wife protested. "Ye will anger the spirits, holy
sir. They are lost spirits who obey not the Church. They are
biddable, if they be taken wisely, but if ye anger them they will
flee to the abyss and take Lovell's gold with them."</p>

<p>"Avaunt thee, woman!" Tobias's voice had gained assurance, for
his wrath was stirred. "If it be devil's gold, it is not for us,
who be Christian folk. I tell you, it is the treasure of one who
was mortal man, and is now a lost soul. Our purpose is honest,
for we would use in a holy cause what now festers idly in the
earth. In the name of God, I go forward."</p>

<p>He would have led the way, but Peter prevented him. Darking
had lit a second lantern, which burned clear in the windless air.
With this in his hand Peter descended the steps.</p>

<p>"Give us as much time," he called to Darking, "as a man may
walk a mile. After that come and seek us."</p>

<p>The passage sloped downward, and was so low that the two had
to bend double. But after the first few yards it was dry, as if
cut from solid rock, and it was powdered with a fine dust. Soon
the roof lifted and they could walk upright. Peter stopped now
and then to take his bearings. "We are going north," he
whispered. "We must now be under the keep. The air is fresh.
Doubtless there is some vent from above."</p>

<p>But presently they reached a subsidence which almost blocked
the corridor. Above the rubble there was a gap through which a
man could squeeze, and Peter managed to enlarge it so that Tobias
passed. Beyond they found steps which descended steeply. The air
smelled damper and closer, and there was a sound of dripping
water behind the containing walls. "We are in the bowels of the
earth," said Peter, "and that flow I take to be the Castle well.
Wary is the word, lest we plunge into the pit where Lovell is
said to have made an end of his ill-wishers."</p>

<p>But the road straightened itself, the roof rose, and the
lantern showed a door bound with rusty iron. This was no such
rotten thing as Darking had broken down at the entrance to the
passage. Peter flung his weight on it, and it held like a rock.
Then he had recourse to Mother Sweetbread's keys, which he had
carried on his left arm. He tried one and then another in the
great lock, and the third fitted. But as his fingers moved to
turn it, he was taken by a second fit of shivering. He turned to
Tobias.</p>

<p>"Pray," he said between clenched teeth. "This is the last
stage. Pray that we be given strength to face what may be beyond
this door."</p>

<p>Tobias's voice was calm. <i>"Expectans expectavi Dominum,"</i>
he said, <i>"et intendit mihi, et exaudivit preces meas, et
eduxit me de lacu miseri&aelig;, et de luco f&aelig;cis, et
statuit super petram pedes meos.</i> Lead on, my son. He who has
brought us thus far will lead us to a secure place."</p>

<p>Peter's fingers trembled so that he fumbled for long with the
key. At last the bolt lifted with a shriek like an animal in
pain. The door opened towards them, and as they drew back to let
it swing it seemed that a foul wind, smelling of a charnel house,
blew for an instant in their faces. . . . Then the lantern gave
them a view.</p>

<p>It was a little chamber hewn out of the living rock, and there
must have been an entrance of air from above, for after the first
noisome blast the place smelled pure and cold. And it was empty.
There were none of the chests and strong boxes which might be
looked for in a treasury. Rather it was like an anchorite's cell.
There was a table and a chair, and in one corner a pallet heaped
with rotting bedclothes. There were objects scattered on the
floor, and on the table a sconce for candles, and some mildewed
parchments. There were other things, for as Peter stepped in he
tripped over something which lay close to the door. . . . With
horror he saw that the something had once been a man.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought it lived, that it was creeping to
catch his foot. He cried out and dropped the lantern.
Fortunately, it was not extinguished, and Tobias caught it and
turned it on the body.</p>

<p>It lay huddled and crooked, as if it had been struggling with
the door, and had used its last flicker of life in a hopeless
assault. It was the body of a tall man, and it was not yet a
skeleton. There had been no rats or worms to deface it, and,
though the eyes had shrunk to things like dried berries, the
skin, grey and wrinkled, still hung on the bones. The beard had
become like lichen, and so had the fur collar of the surcoat. The
teeth had mostly dropped from the withered gums, but two
protruded over the grey lips, with an awful air of ravening and
pain. . . . The man had died of hunger and thirst, had died in
mortal agony, for he had gnawed his finger-tips and bitten deep
into his left wrist. Wrinkled at their feet, every limb
contorted, the garments disordered in the last extremity, the
body was an awful parody of the image of God.</p>

<p>Peter, deadly sick, leaned on the table. Tobias touched the
jewel at the belt, and it fell from the decayed leather. He took
a broad ring from a claw-like finger.</p>

<p>"This is not Lovell's treasure," he said softly. "It is Lovell
himself. See, here is the barry nebuly and the chevronels. . . .
So passes the world's glory. We will seek no more gold, son
Peter, for God this night has shown us a better thing. He has
shown how sure and righteous are His judgments. <i>Qui fodit
foveam, incidet in eam, et qui dissipat sepem mordebit eum
coluber."</i> He signed himself with the cross, and stood with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>Peter's bodily sickness was passing. He could look now at the
thing in the gloom. . . . He saw the dreadful panorama of the
man's death as if he had been an eye-witness. The fugitive from
Stoke battle, with the avenger of blood at his heels, had sought
refuge in his own house, where Mother Blackthorn hid him beyond
the reach of any pursuit. She alone knew the secret of his lair,
and had the means of entrance. There Lovell waited till a way
could be found of moving himself and his ill-gotten wealth
overseas. . . . But the woman had fallen sick, a mortal illness,
and, since she was the sole guardian of the hermitage, the
refugee deep in the earth had no one to give him food and drink.
She had grown delirious, men had had to hold her down in bed and
check her frenzy, for she knew that her master below was dying by
inches; presently she had passed into stupor and death.
Meanwhile, he who had been a great prince and had ruled England
had grown hourly weaker, impotent as a babe to save himself. He
had licked up from the floor the crumbs of his last meal, he had
eaten the candle-ends, he had gone mad and chewed his hands,
until at the end in his ultimate mania he had beaten on the
unyielding door till he dropped with death in his throat. . .
.</p>

<p>The first emotion of horror had left Peter. He had now only a
great pity and a great clearness, as if some cloud had lifted
from his brain. In that subterranean cell he seemed to view the
world from a high hill.</p>

<p>He turned the lantern on the crumpled vellum pages on the
table. He saw that it was an account-book. Lovell had been
passing the hours of his confinement in counting his wealth.
Perhaps the book would give a clue to its whereabouts? . . . With
a spasm of nausea he dismissed the notion. Lovell's treasure
seemed to him a thing accursed, and any motion to win it a sure
plunge into damnation.</p>

<p>"Let us be gone," he said faintly, "and seal up this place so
that no eye may ever look on it again."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Tobias gently, "we must first give this body
Christian burial. We are bound to the dying man in Oxford who
pledged you to lay the wandering spirit of his lord. I will have
masses sung in Oseney for his soul's repose. Do you go and bring
Darking to help."</p>

<p>"I dare not leave you alone in this place."</p>

<p>"Nay, I have no fear. What is there to affright me in a
handful of bones and parched skin? His spirit will not hurt me,
for I do it a kindness. Haste you, son Peter, while I meditate on
him who once was Francis Lovell."</p>

<p>Peter made his way back to the outer air, fumbling in the
dark, for he had left the lantern in the cell. It seemed an age
till he caught a speck of light, and saw Darking's face peering
in at the tunnel's entrance. When he emerged into the bitter
night, a new faintness came over him, and he leaned, choking, on
Darking's arm.</p>

<p>"You have found the gold?" Darking asked.</p>

<p>"We have found its master," he gasped.</p>

<p>The witch-wife cried out. Her curch had slipped and her grey
locks hung loose like a m&aelig;nad's.</p>

<p>"Lovell is there! I dreamed it! White and picked like an
ancient crow! But what of the gold he guards, my lord? Let us
deal mercifully with his bones that his ghost may be kind. See, I
have brought a dead-cloth, that he may be decently and piously
planted in holy earth."</p>

<p>She drew from her bosom a coarse shroud, which fluttered
ghoulishly in the night.</p>

<p>"Come with us," said Peter to Darking, "that we may get him
above ground."</p>

<p>They broke off the table legs and made a bier of the top,
wrapping what had been Lovell in his rotting surcoat. Once in the
open Madge Littlemouse shrouded him in her linen, and Peter and
Darking bore him to the graveyard of the ruinous church. There,
among the broken headstones, they dug a grave with the mattock
which had been destined to unearth treasure, and into that grave,
before the earth was shoveled back, Peter flung the vellum
account-book which might contain the clue to Lovell's hoard.
Tobias said the prayers for the dead, and it seemed to Peter that
as he spoke the air lightened, and the oppression lifted from the
black trees and mouldering walls. There was a sudden rift in the
clouds, and the moon rode out into clear sky.</p>

<p><i>"Nihil enim intulimus in hunc mundum,"</i> rose the voice
of Tobias; <i>"haud dubium quia nec auferre quid possumus. . . .
Nunc autem Christus resurrexit a mortuis, primiti&aelig;
dormientium. . . ."</i></p>

<p>As the voice ceased, the witch-wife plucked at Peter's
arm.</p>

<p>"The gold!" she croaked. "We have laid the ghost. . . . Now
the road is plain. . . . Where Lovell laired the treasure cannot
be far distant."</p>

<p>"I have found it," he answered, "for I have got me a new
mind."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c10">CHAPTER X</a></h1>

<h1>OF THE CONCLAVE AT LITTLE GREECE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>At Mother Sweetbread's he found the lean urchin Dickon of the
Holt, whose rags now hung on yet barer bones. He greeted Peter
with a pull of his forelock.</p>

<p>"They be after ye, master," he said. "The other of you two, a
tall man, him that set free the prisoner three nights back, has
been at his tricks again. Maybe 'twas he set the Fettiplace men
after ye, forbye that ye were seen this day in the forest. In
less than an hour they'll be here, for they know that this is
your hidy-hole. They were to muster at Asthall crossroads, for I
was dobbing down in a chump of furze and heard them plan it."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" Peter asked, and the boy's wolfish eyes
answered.</p>

<p>"Give him food, mother," said Peter. "There is a bare cupboard
at the Holt."</p>

<p>"There be no cupboard there," said the boy, "and there be no
Holt. When I followed ye t'other night, father he set the place
afire, and hanged himself to a rafter, and him and mother was all
burned to cinders." He spoke calmly as if such doings were
trivial, and his eyes followed Mother Sweetbread as she brought
food.</p>

<p>"Then you have no home? Where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>"Where there is a chance of meat. Outside Martin Lee's
kennels, where I can pick up scraps from the hounds' dish, or
beside the swine-troughs up Swinbrook way. That's how I come to
hear the talk of the Fettiplace folk."</p>

<p>"You will come with me, Dickon lad, for it seems you are
destined to serve me. Have you any old garments of mine, mother,
to amend his raggedness?"</p>

<p>"We must be on the move," said Darking. "Little Greece is the
best shelter. I know not if John Naps be there, but I have the
right of entry, and no Fettiplace durst follow."</p>

<p>Madge of Shipton took up the tale. She was in a sullen mood,
and had sat mumbling to herself in a corner.</p>

<p>"What of Lovell's gold, young sir? The gold I have tracked by
my spells through air and earth and water? What of the treasure
that will set you among kings?"</p>

<p>"Let the first comer have it," said Peter. "I have no longer
need of it. I am beholden to you, Mother Littlemouse, but I am
done now with spells and treasure. I have a path to tread where
it would only cumber me."</p>

<p>Peter's tone, solemn and resolute, woke Brother Tobias from
the half-doze which the fatigues of the night had brought on
him.</p>

<p>"And you, Father," said Darking, "will sleep here the night,
and to-morrow I will send a man who will lead you back to
Oseney."</p>

<p>"Not so, friend," said the old man. "My bones are rested, and
my horse can carry me to Little Greece, which I take to be no
great journey. I have a notion that my son Peter will need my
counsel, and Oseney can well spare me."</p>

<p>"Then let us haste," said Darking, "or we shall have the
Fettiplaces on our backs, and I for one am in no mood for a
mellay. Food, mother, for there may be no larder at Little
Greece. Make speed, Dickon, with that new jerkin."</p>

<p>When they left the cottage, Dickon in the frieze of Peter's
boyhood, Tobias stiff and weary on his ambling cob, Peter and
Darking striding ahead, the clouds had for the most part lifted,
and the moon was riding in mid-heaven. There was no sign of
pursuit, as they entered the forest aisles, and in ten minutes,
through Darking's subtle leading, there was no fear of it. They
were back in an ancient world where Darking, and indeed Peter
himself, could baffle any Fettiplace lackey. The cold had
lessened with the dark, and the wind seemed to have shifted, for
it blew in their left ears now and not in their right. Darking
sniffed the air. "Winter has taken a step back," he said. "St
Martin will not forget his little summer. The moles were throwing
up fresh earth, so I knew that the frost would not hold."</p>

<p>Few words were spoken on that journey, and none by Peter, for
he was in the grip of a great awe and a new enlightenment. The
tortured dead, sprawled by the locked door, had tumbled down his
fine castle of dreams. What was the glory of the world if it
closed in dry bones and withered skin? . . . Lovell had been,
next the King, the greatest man in all England, and he had died
like a rat in a trap, gnawing his fingers in his agony. The
starved peasant gasping out his last breath in a ditch had a
better ending. And, as Lovell, so had been his grandsire, Henry
of Buckingham, and his father, save that their threads of life
had been shorn by a clean axe in the daylight for all men to see.
It was not death that he feared, but the triviality of life. He
had the awe of the eternal upon him, and he saw mortal things as
through an inverted spy-glass, small and distant against the vast
deserts of eternity. . . . Only a few hours back his head had
been full of trumpets and horsemen, and his blood as brisk as a
March morning. Now they all seemed little things, short-lived and
weakly. The song of Pierce the Piper came to his mind--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Worm at my heart and fever in my head--<br>
 There is no peace for any but the dead.<br>
 Only the dead are beautiful and free--<br>
 Mortis cupiditas captavit me. . . ."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>But no, he had no craving for death, as he had no fear of it,
and he did not yearn for a peace which was rottenness. It was the
littleness of life that clouded his spirit.</p>

<p>He had known these moods of disillusion before, when light and
colour had gone out of everything. At Oseney, often, when he was
tempted to forswear his gods, and the solemn chants of the choir
in the great abbey church and the manuscripts of Plato in Merton
library alike seemed foolishness. Since his new life began, he
had scarcely felt them; rather he had been filled with a young
lust of living. But now he had seen the world grow suddenly
small, once at Avelard when the gospeller spoke his testimony . .
. once when he saw the dead woman in the hut at the Holt . . .
and two nights ago when he had looked at the dying face of the
Rustler. . . . And if earthly greatness had shrunk for him, he
was not recompensed by any brighter vision of celestial glory.
Was it <i>accidia</i> that troubled him, that deadly sin? Or was
it illumination, the illumination of the King Ecclesiast, who had
cried <i>Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas.</i></p>

<p>Nay, there was one thing that was no vanity. In the atmosphere
of decay which surrounded him one thing shone fresh and bright
and living, a star among clouds, a rose among the graves. The
beauty of Sabine came over him like a benediction. . . . He had
got a new mind, he had told Madge of Shipton, and he had spoken
the truth. In the last hour he had become very old and wise. He
had sacrificed all his whimsies. He would do whatever work God
called him to, but he asked no reward. He did not seek kingdoms
or dukedoms, or purple and fine linen, or trampling armies behind
him. Such pomps he renounced as willingly as any monk. But in his
revulsion from death he hungered for life, and to him Sabine
shone as life incarnate, youth <i>in excelsis,</i> beauty
sanctified. A great tumult of longing filled him. A line of some
forgotten wandering poet came into his head--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"O blandos oculos et inquietos!"</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It was true; her eyes were both lovely and wild, unquiet and
kind. He searched his memory for more. <i>Illic</i>--how did it
go?--yes--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Illic et Venus et leves Amores</i><br>
 <i>Atque ipso in medio sedet Voluptas."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He tried to turn the couplet into his own tongue:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"For there dwells Venus, and the tiny Loves,<br>
 And in their midst Delight."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The word <i>Voluptas</i> offended him. It should have been
<i>Desiderium.</i></p>

<p>They threaded without challenge the maze of thorn scrub which
surrounded Little Greece, and when they reached the great barn
there was no light in it. But the door was unlocked, as Darking
had told them was the custom, and within there was plenty of
kindling, and on the rafters a ham or two and the side of a fat
buck. Darking and Dickon, who showed himself assiduous in his new
duties, made a fire on the stone floor, and from the bean straw
in the far end shook out four beds. "We will rob old John's
larder," said Darking, and he cut slices from one of the hams and
fried them on Naps's griddle. But of the party he alone ate, and
Dickon, who had vast arrears to make up. Peter would have flung
himself on his pallet that he might dream of his love, but Tobias
detained him. The old man lay couched on the straw, his head on
his hand, and the firelight on his face revealed an anxious
kindliness.</p>

<p>"There are no secrets among us, son Peter," he said. "For
certain you have none from me, for I read you like a printed
book. This night you have seen a vision, such as befell St Paul
on the Damascus road. You have seen the vanity of earthly glory,
and your soul is loosed from its moorings. Speak I not the
truth?"</p>

<p>"It is the truth." Peter spoke abstractedly, for he had been
called from the deeps of another kind of meditation.</p>

<p>"I have wondered sometimes," Tobias continued, "whether of
late months you had not forgot your upbringing, and had become
over-worldly for one of your high calling. The lust of the eyes
and the pride of life were new things to you, and I have often
feared that you were dazzled. But this night you spoke words
which were balm to my heart. You said you had got you a new mind,
and that you trod a road where Lovell's gold would only cumber
you. If you meant what I take it you meant, you have indeed had a
baptism of grace. I would have had you get treasure that you
might be the more free to work a noble purpose. But if you sought
it only to hold your head higher among worldly men and attain
more readily to worldly honour, then your purpose was evil and
God in His mercy has frustrated it."</p>

<p>Peter made no answer.</p>

<p>"For you are a soldier of Christ, my son." The old man's voice
had a crooning tenderness. "If you fight in your own strength and
for your own cause, you will go down--I know it as if God had
whispered to me. You will be the third of your house to die a
violent and a futile death. For you may drive out the Tudor and
yet go the way of Duke Harry and Duke Edward, for he who draweth
the sword in his own quarrel will himself be slain by the sword.
But if you fight as the champion of God's Church and His poor
folk you cannot fail, for if you fall you fall a blessed martyr,
and angels will waft you to Paradise--and if you win, your crown
will be like the crown of Israel's High Priest, with the words
writ thereon, 'Holiness to the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Tobias had raised himself on his couch, eyes and voice had
become rapt like a prophet's, and he held out his arms to Peter
in an ecstasy of appeal. Then he sank back, for the fire blazed
up in a sudden draught, and there was a bustle at the
doorway.</p>

<p>John Naps had entered. The master of Little Greece was wrapped
up in several ragged mantles, as if he had found the night chill.
From these rags there protruded only some wisps of white hair,
the long coppery nose, and the moist magisterial eyes.</p>

<p>"Ho, masters!" he cried, and his voice boomed like a
bittern's. "What a Christ's mercy ha' we here? Godsnigs, but you
are at ease in another man's house!" Then his eye fell on
Darking. "Solomon, my love, is't thee? Welcome, old friend, and I
prithee present your company!"</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of Brother Tobias, and doffed his hat. "A
brother of Oseney, i' faith? My greeting, holy sir. Lardy! It is
the good Tobias that never denied alms to a poor man. May your
reverence feed high and sleep deep in John Naps's kennel!"</p>

<p>His rheumy eyes next covered Peter. "Your 'prentice,
Solomon--the honest lad that attended ye at our parliament a
month back?"</p>

<p>"Know him by his true name," Solomon laughed. "To the king of
the Upright Men I present Master Bonamy, out of the west
country."</p>

<p>The old whipjack's face underwent a sudden change. The comedy
left it, and it fell into the stern lines which Peter remembered.
His voice, too, became hard and grave.</p>

<p>"Him that has the Word--our Word, Solomon! 'Twas passed to him
a sennight back at Avelard, and he passed it to Catti the
Welshman t'other day at Gosford. Bonamy, you say? Well, one name
will serve the present need as well as another, but maybe the
true one also spells with a B. Say, friend," and he spoke low,
"is't the one we await? In the words of Holy Writ, is't him that
should come or must we look for another?"</p>

<p>"You have said it," was Darking's answer.</p>

<p>Naps cast off his ragged cloak and revealed a very respectable
suit of brown frieze and leather. He bobbed on his knee before
Peter, looking like some king of the gnomes with his domed skull,
his mahogany cheeks, and his wisp of white beard. He took the
young man's right hand, and laid it on the crown of his own head
and on his heart, mumbling all the while a thing like a
paternoster. He took a water-jug which stood on the floor, and
sprinkled some drops on his palm. He picked a half-burned stick
from the fire, and quenched the glowing end with his wet fingers.
Last, he plucked a knife from his belt, and drew the edge over
the back of one thumb so that a drop of blood spurted. What he
had done to his own left hand, he did to Peter's right.</p>

<p>"I swear you the beggar's oath of fealty, sire," he said, and
the whipjack had a sudden hierarchic dignity. "The oath by water
and fire and cold steel and common blood. Whenever your call
sounds, the beggars will rise around ye like an autumn mist out
of every corner of England."</p>

<p>Then his eyes became anxious.</p>

<p>"We be all true men here?" he asked. "The reverend
father?"</p>

<p>"Be comforted, John," said Darking. "'Twas he that had the
bringing up of my lord. He knew his secret first of any."</p>

<p>The whipjack's humour changed, and he was again the jovial
ruffian. He got himself some food, and made himself a bed of
straw by Darking's side.</p>

<p>"What brings this high and mighty company to Little Greece?
Few, save ourselves, come here, unless the King's law be
troublesome."</p>

<p>"'Tis the King's law troubles us," said Darking. "My lord has
his own business about the land, and for the moment must lie as
close as a badger in snow. But some nights ago there was trouble
at the Holt about the setting free of a gospeller, who was
captive to his grace of Lincoln, and through a trick the deed was
blamed on my lord. This day we come again into this countryside
to find the cry still out and the Fettiplace hounds hot on the
scent. Wherefore we seek refuge in a place which no Swinbrook man
dare enter."</p>

<p>Naps laughed long and loud. "Behold the foppery of the world!"
he shouted. "He that will soon be the first man in England is at
the mercy of a loutish esquire who thinks to curry favour with
Law. The good Tobias, a pillar of Holy Church, is privy to an
offence against that Church, and must needs go into hiding. And
these two great ones seek shelter from old John Naps, who all his
days has had little favour from Church and none at all from Law.
. . . But the cream of the jest ye have yet to hear."</p>

<p>He lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"There is another seeking sanctuary. He knows the road hither,
and may be here any moment, and his need is greater than yours,
for he is the guilty man. Ye have heard, maybe, of the young lord
of Boarstall, him they call Simon Rede, him that has been
fighting overseas ever since his beard sprouted. It seems he has
took up with the thing Gospel--though what this Gospel be I know
not--some say 'tis a fetter to bind the poor and others a club to
beat the rich. 'Twas he that freed the gospeller at the Holt, and
hid him for the time in a place which I know but will not tell.
This day he returned to put the man in still safer hiding, and
get my help on the job, for Boarstall has ever been a kindly door
to wandering men. Nay, Solomon, fear not. He is not one of us, as
you are--as this lord is. He has not the Word. Well, he
succeeded, and the gospeller, a sour, starveling fellow with no
stomach for ale, was hid away as snug as a flea in a blanket. But
Esquire Fettiplace's long nose was smelling out the business,
and, if he came on the scent of my lord here, he comes plump and
fairly on the footprints of Master Rede. Wherefore these last
hours the said Master Rede has been hard put to it to shake off
the hounds. With my aid he has done it, for he doubled back in
the forest, and I sent one of my lads on a horse to draw the hunt
towards the Glyme, so that by this time the Fettiplace dogs are
giving idle tongue in Wootton or Glympton. And Master Simon will
presently be here, if he remembers my guiding and does not fall
into Borney marl-pit or drown in Capperton mere. He will be a
weary man, sore in need of bed and supper. . . ."</p>

<p>Darking looked grave.</p>

<p>"There is no love between him and my lord. Also, he is said to
be of the King's faction, though he has a taste for this Gospel.
Above all, he is not in the secret. We must be wary, John, and
guard our speech, and do you, my lord, let wrongs be forgot for
this night."</p>

<p>The name of Simon Rede had stirred Peter into complete
wakefulness, for it was with Sabine that he chiefly associated
the squire of Boarstall. All his old jealousies revived. The
theft of the cloak, the arrogant air of superiority--such
offences now seemed trivial compared with the fact that he dared
to raise his eyes to the girl at Avelard. . . . Was he certain?
Might it not be only his fancy? He longed to have Simon face to
face to make sure. And yet he dreaded the meeting, for the man
rasped his soul like a rough cloth on a sore.</p>

<p>But Simon was long a-coming. That was a restless night in
Little Greece, for midnight was past, and Naps was snoring like a
trumpet, and Peter mazed with the wheel of thought that spun in
his brain, and Tobias sleeping the light sleep of old age, when
the door opened, and the dead embers of the fire blew up in
spirals of cold ashes. Thereafter there was no more peace. Dickon
set the fire going again, and further rashers were set to broil,
and Peter, elaborately incurious, at last raised his eyes to see
on the straw opposite him the tall figure he knew so well.</p>

<p>Simon had had a rough journey. His boots were mired above the
knee, and his hose and doublet had suffered heavily from the
thorn scrub. But his dark face seemed content. He had a mug of
ale in his hand--for Naps had revealed a secret store--and when
he caught Peter's eye he raised it to him.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Master Bonamy," he said. "We are fated, it seems,
to forgather in strange places. That cloak of mine, now? You have
your own back, and I would welcome my own old mantle."</p>

<p>He laughed, but there was no malice in the laugh. He seemed a
new being, a boyish, friendly figure, that played pranks and
frankly avowed them. Peter answered in the same strain.</p>

<p>"The frost has gone, so you will need it the less. But 'tis at
Mother Sweetbread's by Leafield under the Forest when you care to
seek it."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your stewardship. I make you my compliments,
too, on the speed of your travels, for you cover the countryside
like a Welsh cattle-lifter. I leave you by the Burford road, and
twenty-four hours later meet you on the Oxford plainstones, and
now I find you thirty miles off by the springs of Evenlode. You
must have weighty business on your hands."</p>

<p>"Weighty enough, but less urgent than yours, it seems. Have
you gotten yon gospeller into safe hiding at last?"</p>

<p>The man's face hardened.</p>

<p>"Please God, he is now where no Bishop's jackal will ever
unearth him!" He stopped, for he saw the eyes of Brother Tobias
fixed on him, and he realised for the first time that Tobias wore
the Oseney habit.</p>

<p>"What does a monk in Little Greece?" he asked sharply of Naps,
and his eye was stern and wary, while his hand travelled to his
side.</p>

<p>"Be comforted, master," said Naps. "None that shelter here
dare speak what they learn beyond these walls. That is the first
of our laws, and it is death to break it. . . . These gentles
know your tale. They, too, have had trouble this very day from
the Fettiplace folk that hunted you. We be all comrades, and
secret as a stone tomb."</p>

<p>Then Tobias spoke. He had had all the sleep he needed, and now
sat up, very wakeful.</p>

<p>"In spite of my habit, friend, I am not against you. I am not
of those who would punish man for giving the Scriptures to the
commons--in truth I laboured myself in that cause long ere you
were born. To-day there is a sad confusion on the matter in the
Church's rule and the King's laws. I wish yon gospeller relief
from his tribulations. My hand would never be lifted against such
as he."</p>

<p>Simon looked at him harshly, till the gentleness in the old
man's face and voice seemed to thaw his suspicions.</p>

<p>"Is it so?" he said. "Then there is one honest Christian in
the abbeys?"</p>

<p>"There be many," Tobias answered. "And there be many kinds of
Christian. You are young and I am old, and youth is a hard judge.
God has not made all His servants of one mould."</p>

<p>"That is strange doctrine for an Oseney brother. The Church
would have every man and woman conform to its own rusty pattern,
and those that jib at such antique moulds and seek the liberty of
God's children she dubs heretics and would consume with
fire."</p>

<p>"You are harsh to the Church, good sir. Maybe, you have met
too many worthless clerks."</p>

<p>"I have met worthy and worthless, but they are alike in bonds.
See, father. I have been wearing my youth in far lands where
there is no room for cloistered virtues, and I have learned the
greatness of God in deep waters and on desperate battlefields. I
return to find those who call themselves His servants in this
land making a mockery of His service--babes mazed in childish
mummeries or hucksters selling God's mercies for gain. Wherefore
I say--and I will cry it on the housetops--that there is need of
a harsh broom and a strong broom in England."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Tobias. "I have long pled for such a broom.
But see that it truly sweeps out the foul corners, and does not
hurt the tender and gracious things."</p>

<p>"In such a sweeping frail things must be broke. It is a cheap
price to pay for a cleaner land."</p>

<p>"When you have emptied the sanctuary and burned its old
furniture how will you furnish it anew?"</p>

<p>"With the plain truth of God's Scriptures," said Simon.</p>

<p>"That were well. I have preached for thirty years that man
must go back to the Scriptures. And yet--and yet. The Church is a
fold for all, rich and poor, learned and unlearned, the child and
the grown. If she do no more than preach the bare and difficult
sentences of God's Word, her meat will be too strong for her
little ones, and her poor ones. The Word must be tempered and
translated for the weaker lambs of the fold."</p>

<p>"It must be the truth," said Simon, "the truth, the naked
truth, without human trimmings."</p>

<p>"The truth!" Tobias dwelt long on the word. "No doubt such
fare would be fit for your puissant youth. But for the simple and
the unlettered? . . . Moreover, what is the truth? 'Tis a
question no philosopher has yet answered. What is the truth of
the Scriptures? There be many commentators, and they are not
agreed, for Clement says one thing, and Athanasius another, and
Austin a third, and the great St Thomas may differ from all."</p>

<p>Simon shook his head angrily. "That is a monkish subtlety. The
truth is plain to read for all that have eyes and an honest
heart."</p>

<p>"The truth may be, the truth of man's salvation, but men are a
diversity of creatures, and it must present itself to them in
different forms. I have lived in this world nigh three-score and
ten years, and I fear to circumscribe by mortal dogma the
infinite ways of God. I incline to the belief that in the light
of eternity all our truths are shadows, and that the very truth
we shall only know hereafter. Yet I think that every truth in its
own place is a substance, though it may be a shadow in another
place. And I think that all such shadows have value for our
souls, for each is a true shadow, as the substance is a true
substance."</p>

<p>Simon looked long at Tobias, and something melted in him under
that innocent gaze.</p>

<p>"I think you are a good man," he said. "But what would you do
in the present discontents? You will not deny that the Church has
fallen from its high estate, and that the religious houses are
too often haunts of lechery and greed."</p>

<p>Tobias smiled. "I would use the broom--a stiff broom. But I
would not burn down an ancient dwelling whose walls are sound
because there is filth in some of the rooms. I would not give the
worldly man what was destined for God, and I would not, like the
King's grace, slay men because they account that to be a shadow
which some hold truth, and truth what many call shadow."</p>

<p>"Ay. That's the rub and a plague on it! I am a man that loves
clear courses. I am for the King against the abbeys, but I am
most vehemently against the King in this matter of heresy. I am
of those that the Spaniard calls Luteranos, who would have God's
revelation rewrit for simple men. But for the one faith the
Bishops would burn me if they had the power, and for the other
the King would assuredly hang me. . . . 'Tis a hard choice, yet
on the whole I am for the King's way of it. He has men around him
who may guide him into wiser roads. But if the Church and the
Pope once again put their foot on his neck, then farewell to all
hope for England."</p>

<p>He cast his eye round the company. Peter lay on the straw, his
eyes half shut; Naps was busy with the blackjack; Tobias sat
erect with his hood fallen back from his bald head; Dickon was
asleep, and Darking's sombre face was heavy with its own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"We here in Little Greece," Simon cried, "are for the moment
of one company. We can speak freely, for our lips hereafter are
sealed. There is word of a great revolt preparing against the
King, with the Church behind it, and the Church's serfs, and many
great ones whom Harry has flouted! What know you of it, John
Naps? Your ear is very close to English ground."</p>

<p>"Look Lincoln way," said the whipjack. "The trouble has begun
there, and there is word that it is spreading northward."</p>

<p>"There is more in it than that. The rising in the east is an
affair of peasants, which the King's men-at-arms will crush. But
strange tales come out of the west, and that is a graver
matter."</p>

<p>He suddenly dropped the guarded tone he had been using and
spoke out like a soldier crying a command.</p>

<p>"Who is this Master Bonamy that spends his time on the road
between Oxford and Avelard? What part has he in those doings? I
have heard a whisper of strange tales."</p>

<p>Peter's head buzzed like a hive, there was heaviness about his
eyes, and pain in the back of his neck. He had scarcely listened
to the talk, for his wits were wool-gathering. But he pulled
himself together at the challenge.</p>

<p>"Little Greece is a sanctuary," he said, speaking his words
slowly and with difficulty, "but it is not a confessional, and
you, Master Rede, have no warrant as an inquisitor. . . . I am
the Lord Avelard's heir."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Simon. "But what does the heir of Avelard do
so far from his manor west of Severn? What does he at Avelard
itself and at Stowood and Wood Eaton?"</p>

<p>"I will answer you of my courtesy," said Peter. "I am in those
parts because I am paying court to a lady--my lord's niece."</p>

<p>Simon started as if a whiplash had stung him.</p>

<p>"Sabine! Mistress Beauforest! Man, she is affianced to me. We
were boy and girl together in the Boarstall woods."</p>

<p>Then his face flushed deep and his temper broke.</p>

<p>"The devil take you for your insolence! . . . By God, you will
never get her. . . . If yon old fox at Avelard play false to me
and her dead father, I will wring his neck though all Severn side
were at his back."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c11">CHAPTER XI</a></h1>

<h1>HOW PETER CAME AGAIN TO AVELARD</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Of the later events of that night Peter had no clear memory.
He was conscious of trying to speak and finding utterance hard;
his mouth was dry, and the words stuck to his lips; also his head
ached. After that came a blank, and the next thing he remembered
was lying, not on straw, but on a rough pallet bed with wet
cloths on his temples. There seemed to be a pool of water in
front of him which glimmered in the darkness; it was a belt of
sunlight coming through the half-shuttered window in the barn.
There was a woman there, an ancient woman whose face seemed
familiar, and Darking sat beside him on a three-legged stool. . .
. The pain in his head had gone, but a wheel was still turning
dizzily inside it, and his eyes pained him so that he could not
look at the pool of light.</p>

<p>Then, after another spell of oblivion, he heard Darking's
voice, and made sense of his words. He was speaking to John
Naps--he could not mistake Naps's parrot-like white head.</p>

<p>"No more than a common fever," Darking was saying. "He went
down like a felled ox--that is the way of youth that knows
nothing of sickness. 'Tis this soft weather. When St Martin
starts his summer before the feast of Simon and Jude young blood
must suffer. Also he may have got a whiff of some malady by the
Rustler's bed or in that crypt where Lovell died. God knows there
were foul airs enough in that hole to sicken an army."</p>

<p>The whipjack laid his horny claw on the wet clouts on Peter's
brow.</p>

<p>"He burns like a lime-kiln," he said. "Heaven send the holy
one make haste and bring a leech, for there is need here of
drenching and purging and blood-letting."</p>

<p>After that came confusion again. His next memory was of Tobias
with a grave face, sitting by his bed and conning his breviary.
Then came a new figure--a wisp of a man with a small head and a
sharp nose, a figure like a heron, that stooped and pecked at
him. He was conscious of little stabs of pain, and of spasms of
great weakness, after which he floated away on clouds into
forgetfulness. . . .</p>

<p>These were hard days for Brother Tobias. To see the lad, whom
he had never known sick or sorry, lie helpless in fever, wrung
his old heart and put amazing vigour into his old bones. There
was a wise man at Banbury, one Pyramus, who had studied medicine
at Palermo; so to Banbury went Tobias, and, having his own means
of persuasion, brought the leech straightway to Little Greece. Dr
Pyramus pronounced it no common autumn fever. He suspected
poison, and finally amended his diagnosis to an infection by evil
breath, whence breathed he could not tell. He bled his patient
with such vigour that the boy's face became like tallow and
Tobias could not look at it without a heart pang. He compounded
noxious draughts, made out of foul things like wood-lice, and
spiders, and powdered deer horn, and the dung of white doves, and
these, mixed with hot ale, Peter was compelled to swallow. They
did one thing effectively, for they made him deathly sick,
thereby relieving his body of evil humours.</p>

<p>One day Mother Sweetbread stood beside him weeping, and with
her Madge of Shipton, who, to the scandal of Tobias, made spells
with well water and a lighted candle and the tail hairs of a
black mare. Tobias's own part was to keep the brow cool and the
lips moist, to prevent him tossing the blankets off him, and to
hold his hand when Peter clutched at the air in a feverish dream.
Also to pray, incessantly, to God and God's Mother, and to all
the saints who furthered the healing art--St Blaize and St John
the Almoner, St Timothy and St Michael the Archangel, St Anthony
who cures heats of the skin, and St Lazarus who was himself once
a youth raised by our Lord from the dead.</p>

<p>The fever was stubborn, but whether it was the purgings and
bleedings, Goody Littlemouse's spells or Tobias's prayers, there
came a day when it left Peter, and he lay as weak as a kitten,
while the tides of life began to drift back slowly into his body.
Dr Pyramus came from Banbury for the last time, and pronounced
over him the curative benediction, half Latin and half Arabic, of
the Palermo physicians. Then it was the task of others to speed
the patient up the slopes of health. Goody Littlemouse came from
Shipton, and this time she did not weave spells. A big fire was
lit, and a pot boiled, and she washed Peter in scalding water,
and wrapped him in a skin new stripped from a heifer calf. Also
her cunning hands, strong as a bear's paws, picked out and
kneaded his flaccid muscles, and soothed the tormented nerves of
neck and face, and pounded his breast so that vigour should
return to his heart. . . . Mother Sweetbread took up her quarters
in Little Greece, and made him broths of game and wild herbs, and
frumenty spiced with ginger, and, to quench his thirst, a gruel
of barley mixed with her own sloeberry cordial. . . . Also Tobias
came again from Oseney, and, having given thanks for a son
restored, read to him the <i>Colloquies</i> of the great Erasmus,
as well as the Scriptures, and gave him the news of Oxford. . . .
It was now long past St Martin's day, but the good saint's summer
still held, and presently Peter was carried to a chair and looked
out on blue skies and smoke-brown coverts, and sniffed the sweet
wild odours of the winter woods.</p>

<p>"God has sent you this sickness, my son," said Tobias, "for
His own purpose. <i>Deus nobis haec otia fecit.</i> You have had
peace to make your soul before the hour of trial comes. First
came that night at Minster Lovell which was a purging of your
heart, and then the needful purging of your body, and last these
days of quiet reflection. The ways of the Lord are altogether
wise."</p>

<p>For a little, while his strength crept back to him, Peter lay
in a happy peace. He felt himself purged indeed, a chamber clean
and swept for a new life to fill. . . . But presently, as his
vigour renewed itself, the peace became cloudy. He remembered
dimly Simon Rede's last words, but very clearly he was conscious
of his challenge. Sabine's figure returned to haunt his memory.
He would lie for hours dreaming of her, sometimes happy,
sometimes vaguely unquiet, now and then in the midnight hours
uncommonly ill at ease. While he was tied by the leg in Little
Greece, what had become of the girl--what was Simon Rede doing?
He had forgotten his greater task. For him Avelard was only
Sabine's bower and Lord Avelard only her guardian.</p>

<p>But little by little his old life rebuilt itself in his mind.
What was a-foot in the world beyond the oak shaws? One day John
Naps arrived, and he listened to his talk with Darking, who had
come the night before from Oxford.</p>

<p>"There is word from Avelard," said the latter; "my lord here
is bidden hold himself in readiness for a sudden call. I had a
message in Stowood."</p>

<p>The whipjack nodded.</p>

<p>"There is a mighty to-do among the great folk," he cried.
"Flatsole is in Bernwood, fresh from the north, and he says there
is a fire alight in Yorkshire that the King's men cannot put out,
and a running to and fro of dukes and earls and King's messengers
like the pairing of partridges in February."</p>

<p>"There is a kindling in the west, too," said Darking. "The
priests are broidering a banner with the Five Wounds, and Neville
is gone to Wales. The hour is near when he of Avelard must stir
himself, and that means work for our young lord. King Harry, who
has been looking east and north, is beginning to throw a glance
westward. I had news in Oxford yesterday. Crummle, they say, is
more anxious about Severn than Trent, and is turning his pig's
face this way. That spells danger. Is my lord safe here from
prying eyes?"</p>

<p>The whipjack spat solemnly. It was his favourite gesture of
contempt.</p>

<p>"As safe as if he were in Avelard with all the armed west
around him. Since the hour he fell sick, my posts and pickets
have been on every road. 'Twould be harder for one unbidden to
enter Little Greece than to kill and cart a buck in Windsor
Forest under the castle walls, and any Peeping Tom would soon be
an acorn on the highest oak. . . . But if there be war coming, I
fear it may get foul weather. I like not this false summertide
which stretches towards Yule. The sky curdles too much of an
evening, and the wild geese are flighting in from the sea."</p>

<p>"What do you fear?" Darking asked, for the whipjack was famous
for his weather lore.</p>

<p>"Snow," was the answer. "Wind, maybe, but I think snow. There
will be deep snow by Andrewmas."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But the feast of St Edmund the Martyr came, and still the
weather held, and on St Catherine's day the sky was still clear,
though the wind was shifting by slow degrees against the sun to
the north. By now Peter was on his feet, and able to walk a mile
or two with comfort, right down through the alleys amid the thorn
scrub to where Naps's sentries kept watch. Indeed, he could have
walked farther had not Mother Sweetbread commanded moderation,
for he felt his limbs as vigorous as ever, and had that springing
sense of a new life which falls only to youth recovering from a
fever.</p>

<p>On the night after the festival of Catherine, Darking came to
Little Greece--in a great hurry, for he was in the saddle and not
a-foot.</p>

<p>"How goes it, my lord?" he asked. "Are your limbs your own
once more? Can you back a horse for a matter of twenty
miles?"</p>

<p>"I am strong enough to stride that distance in four hours,"
said Peter.</p>

<p>"Well and good. The word for you is mount and ride. You must
be in Avelard by to-morrow's noon."</p>

<p>So there was a furbishing up of Peter's raiment, and the horse
he had brought from Avelard was fetched from its stable in the
forest, where it had been bestowed after the loosing of the
gospeller at the Holt. And next morning he set out with Darking,
who conveyed him only a little way, since he had business of his
own on Cherwell side. The sky was still bright, though the air
stung when they left the Evenlode vale for the wolds of Stow. It
was wintertime clear enough, for there were no larks rising on
the hills or swooping plovers--only big flocks of skimming grey
fieldfares, and strings of honking geese passing south, and
solemn congregations of bustards, and in the wet places clouds of
squattering wildfowl. But the grass was still green, and, though
the trees were leafless, the bushes were so bright with fruit
that they seemed to make a second summer.</p>

<p>"Heaven has sent a breathing space to the world as well as to
me," thought Peter. "I wonder what it portends. Maybe a wild
Christmas."</p>

<p>That morning's ride was to dwell in his memory like a
benediction, for it seemed that from his sickness he had won a
new youth. Every sight and sound and scent charmed his recovered
senses, and his thoughts had again the zest and the short
horizons of the boy. He schooled his spirits to temperance. He
reminded himself that no more for him was the foolish dream of
worldly glory. He was a soldier vowed to a selfless cause. But he
found a substitute for drums and trumpets in this very
abnegation. He recalled the many who had lost the world to gain
it, and found exhilaration in the thought of a high dramatic
refusal. The verse of Boethius ran in his head--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Ite nunc fortes ubi celsa magni</i><br>
 <i>Ducit exempli via."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He sung it aloud to the empty wolds:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Go forth, ye brave, on the high road<br>
 Where honour calls to honour's wars;<br>
 Strip from your back the craven load;<br>
 Go spurn the earth and win the stars."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>In his new mood he wove for himself delicious dreams of a
world where the philosopher would be the king, and Christ and
Plato would sit at the same table, and the Psalmist and Virgil
would join their voices in the celestial Marriage-song.</p>

<p>But the mood could not last, and before he had come to the
last edge of Cotswold and looked down on Severn, he had different
fancies. Down in the valley was Sabine, in an hour he would be
under the same roof, in an hour he would see her eyes. . . . He
was no longer the seer and the dreamer, but the common lover,
with a horizon bounded by his mistress's face. The verses which
now filled his head had no taint of sanctity, but were the
snatches of wandering goliards, to whom women and wine were the
sum of life. . . . He would make for her songs of his own--her
eyes should be hymned as Catullus had hymned the burning eyes of
Lesbia; he would make her famous among men as Peter Abelard had
made the Abbess of the Paraclete, so that, like Eloise, men would
speak of her beauty long after it was dust.</p>

<p>Arrived at Avelard, he was taken straight to my lord's
chamber. Lord Avelard wore a heavy furred robe, for his blood was
thin, and a fire of logs made the place like an oven to one fresh
from the sharp out-of-doors. The old man kissed Peter on both
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You have been ill, my son? Only stern business kept me from
your bedside, but I had constant advices, and you were in good
hands. My faith! but sickness has made a hero of you. You look
older and sager and more resolute, if still a trifle over-lean.
Sit, my son, for you must husband your strength. . . . The moment
is very near. The Welshman is most deeply entangled in the north,
and from what I hear both heart and guile are failing him. Our
plans are on the edge of completion, and the word has gone forth
that on St Lucy's day our folk begin to draw together. After that
we move swift. You shall eat your Christmas dinner in Oxford,
and, if God please, you shall sit in London ere Candlemas."</p>

<p>The waxen face had now more colour in it, and the approach of
the hour of action seemed to have put fresh life into his blood,
for he moved briskly, and fetched from a side table a mass of
charts and papers.</p>

<p>"Now for your own part. In the next week you will visit some
of the centres of our rising and show yourself to those who will
follow you. 'Faith, they will think you St George himself, if you
are properly habited, for sickness has made you like a young
archangel. . . . Meantime there are these parchments for you to
put your hand to. They are, in a manner of speaking, the
pay-rolls of your army, only you pay not with coined gold but
with assurances. Your followers will spend much substance in your
cause, and doubtless much blood. If you win, it is right that
they should be recompensed by some increase to their estate."</p>

<p>The parchments were many, and they made a most comprehensive
pay-roll. To his horror Peter saw that they related mainly to
Church lands. There were one or two royal manors to be
apportioned, but most were the property of the abbeys and
priories of the Thames and Severn vales. The lists made very free
with the estates of the greater houses--Gloucester and Tewkesbury
and Malmesbury and Evesham--and bore somewhat less hard upon the
smaller foundations. Eynsham and Bicester and Hailes and
Winchcombe were left with a larger proportion than Pershore. His
own Oseney was to be comprehensively despoiled and all her rich
lands about Bibury were to be taken from her. The abbeys
themselves were to remain, apparently, but they were to remain
with less than a tithe of their old wealth. It was a spoliation
more drastic than Crummle's.</p>

<p>Peter read on with a darkening face. Even the revelation here
given of the strength of those who followed him woke no response
in his heart. He was shocked to the bone that he, the champion of
the Church, should be her chief despoiler. . . . To each piece of
land was attached the name of the new owner. The great lords had
the lion's share--Avelard himself, and Exeter, and Rutland, and
Neville--even Northumberland. But there was good provision for
the lesser gentry, and the names of Sudeley and Boteler and
Tracey and Lacey and Noel bulked large. . . . Even Fettiplace,
his late pursuer, was there. Also the wool merchants of the
Calais staple, who were doubly valuable, since they could
contribute good money, as well as stalwart prentices. Not one of
them seemed to be absent--Drury, Midwinter, Cely, Bartholomew,
Grevel, Hicks, Marner, Tame, Sylvester, Whittington--representing
every stone town from Stroud to Witney, from Fairford on Thames
to Stratford on Avon.</p>

<p>Peter conned the documents with an angry heart, and took so
long over it that Lord Avelard tried to turn the leaves
faster.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in me, my lord," he said at length. "May God
forgive me if I put my hand to any such parchment! Are we the
devil's scriveners to hack and whittle at God's inheritance and
break down the carved work of the sanctuary?"</p>

<p>The waxen face did not change, or the steely regard of the
pale eyes.</p>

<p>"Patience, my son. There is no purpose of malevolence against
Holy Church. But her possessions have grown somewhat cumbersome
for her handling. The wiser abbots and bishops are of the same
mind, and the people of England are set on the freeing of the
religious lands. Think you that otherwise the Welshman could have
done what he has done? Crummle would have had his throat slit in
the first week of his visitations if England had not approved the
purpose, though condemning its executors."</p>

<p>"Maybe you speak truth, and the abbeys need pruning. I know
well that some of them fester like cesspools. But that pruning
must be done with a single eye to the glory of God and the
comfort of His people. My lord, your plan is common banditry. You
would plunder God to enrich the proud, and that were a deed
accursed of Heaven."</p>

<p>Peter's wrath had given him assurance, and he faced the elder
man with a firm chin and a glowing eye.</p>

<p>"These same proud," Lord Avelard said quietly, "are the men
who will fight for you and set you in a high place. Hear reason,
my son. An army must be paid, and where is your war chest? You
have not a groat which you can call your own. I and some few
others are willing to risk our substance in your cause, which is
also the cause of England. But for the others--the rank and
file--they will venture only if they see their profit. . . .
Consider the interests of Holy Church herself. The Welshman will
wholly root her out of England and give her possessions to those
who are sharers in his iniquity. That is the avowed purpose of
Crummle and his kind, and it is they who control the King. Is it
not better to stablish her securely, even if she herself have to
pay in part for that security? Consider, my son. We dwell in a
fallible world where great deeds can only be compassed by
reckoning with the foibles of mankind."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Peter stubbornly, "I will not set my hand
to these parchments. There must be some purging of the Church for
the Church's sake, but it cannot be done in such fashion. I will
not be privy to giving what is dedicated to God and His poor to
those who have abundance. Let us make a hazard, my lord, and if
we win, then is the time to effect a decent and orderly
reformation. There be Church lands which have been ill guided and
may well be entrusted to better hands. There be royal manors to
repay my army. There be . . ."</p>

<p>It was Lord Avelard's turn to flush, and his voice was no
longer quiet, but full of a cold passion.</p>

<p>"A murrain on all clerks!" he cried. "You have the accursed
taint in your blood, got I know not how--'tis not the strong wine
of Bohun. I had thought Solomon Darking would have put more
wisdom into your skull. Duke Edward and Duke Harry would have
burned every monkish rookery in the land if it would have
furthered one ell their march to the throne. You are a priest, it
seems, and no soldier, and who will strike a blow for a peevish
priestling, even though he have Buckingham's blood?"</p>

<p>Then he seemed to put a check on his temper, and his voice
softened.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, son. I am an old man, and do not love to have my
plans questioned. . . . We will let these parchments sleep for
the moment. Maybe, when you have seen something of those who
follow you, you will come to another mind. Trust me, I am no less
devout a son of the Church than you, though I was not bred in a
cloister. I am too near the grave to do aught to imperil my
salvation."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the afternoon came Dickon to Avelard, having been delayed
at Little Greece till his new suit arrived from the Witney
tailor. With some weeks of good feeding behind him he looked a
different child from the starved urchin at the Holt, and in his
servant's livery of sober brown he cut a personable figure. When
Peter went to his chamber to change his clothes before supper, he
found Dickon in waiting, handling curiously the rich garments of
silk and taffeta and velvet.</p>

<p>"We are in a lord's palace," said the boy, "and you yourself
are now a lord. With what softness the great ones clothe
themselves!" And he laid a satin doublet against his hard
cheek.</p>

<p>Peter had not yet cast eye on Sabine. She did not appear at
dinner, and all afternoon he had ranged idly through the park,
hoping to catch a glimpse of her gown or hear the feet of her
horse. That evening the northern sky had banked up ominously with
clouds, and the wind had settled fairly into that quarter--a
steady wind blowing through leagues of ice. So Peter had been
fain to seek the hearth of the great hall, and let his cheeks
grow hot in the glow of it, while he reflected upon the events of
the morning. Once more he was lapped in the luxury of Avelard,
and it moved him little; for certain boyish weaknesses seemed to
have been burned out in his recent fever. He was no longer
thrilled by dainty fare and fine raiment, as he had been a month
before. Now he was conscious of a stronger purpose in his heart,
of more masterful blood in his veins, of that power to command
which was his birthright. To-day he was doubly Bohun. Also he
realised that he had that first of a leader's gifts, a fine
carelessness of self, so that if need be he could stand alone. He
was prepared to fling soul and body into the arena, to be exalted
or trampled under as God ordained. . . . And then he was forced
to confess to himself that this boasted self-sufficiency was a
lie. He did not stand alone; there was one in this very house who
could tumble him from his pinnacle by a glance of her eye.</p>

<p>At supper Lord Avelard kept his room, but Sabine appeared. The
meal was served in the Great Chamber, as on the first occasion,
and when the food was set on the table the servants withdrew.
This time the girl had discarded her black robes for a wonderful
gown of silver tissue, and her jewels were not sapphires but
stones that darted crimson fire. She gave him both hands at her
entrance, but not her cheek. Tonight she seemed not kinswoman or
friend, but possible mistress, certain queen. Her pale beauty had
authority in it, and her eyes a possessive pride.</p>

<p>"Have you brought your lute?" he asked. "Once you ravished the
soul out of me with your singing."</p>

<p>She laughed and looked at him from under drooped eyelids.</p>

<p>"To-night we take counsel, my lord. The matter is too grave
for music."</p>

<p>At first they spoke little. The girl's eyes smiled on him, but
not with common friendliness. She seemed to be appraising him, to
be striving to read something in a face which his recent fever
had made keener and finer, for there were little puckers of
thought on her brow. Also--or so it seemed to him--there was a
new respect in her air, and with it a certain hesitation. Once or
twice she appeared to be nerving herself for words which she
found it hard to utter. There was between them a thin invisible
veil of ice.</p>

<p>It was Peter who broke it.</p>

<p>"Has Simon Rede been here in the past month?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"He came three weeks since," she answered, "a week after you
left Avelard." There was no sign of discomposure in her face.</p>

<p>"He came to pay court to you?"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Maybe. We were sweethearts as children, but that is long ago.
Does my lord do me the honour to be jealous?"</p>

<p>"I would be glad to learn that he got a flat denial."</p>

<p>She shrugged her white shoulders. "There was no need. Master
Simon's love-making did not stretch thus far. I am the ward of my
lord Avelard, who has something to say in the disposal of my
hand, and he does not look kindly on Master Rede."</p>

<p>"But you yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am a woman grown and a woman must think of many things. I
am no green girl to be led captive by a plumed bonnet and a long
sword and a soldier's airs. What has Master Simon to offer but
the mouldering walls of Boarstall, or more likely a wet bed in
the forest, for he is ever at odds with those in power. We women,
who would be wives, love peace and surety." There was a curious
sudden hardness in face and voice.</p>

<p>"Yet I have heard that a woman will risk all for love."</p>

<p>"Ay, for true love." Her eyes did not melt. "When true love
rides the road, some women will sell their shift and follow him.
But I do not love Master Simon, though I have a tenderness for an
old playmate."</p>

<p>She paused. There was honesty, a kind of boyish frankness, in
her tone.</p>

<p>"I do not think I was born for such love. I have never felt
those raptures, which youth calls passion and eld green-sickness.
Maybe 'tis a sore lack, maybe good fortune, but so we Beauforests
are made. We are good wives to those we choose, for we are loyal
comrades and can play high and bold like a man. There burns in us
a fierce ambition, and it is no idle fancy, for we have the power
in us to deal with high matters and the courage to use that
power. Make no mistake, my lord. We are no common housewives to
tremble at a husband's nod, and bear a child once a year, and see
to his cordials and pasties."</p>

<p>The veil of ice between them had gone and so had the rosy mist
of sex. Peter felt that a human soul confronted him, a soul
fierce and candid, earthy and gallant, and no mere lovely body
shrouded in silks and jewels.</p>

<p>"You were meant for a queen," he said, and there was reverence
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Maybe. Assuredly I was not meant for a squire's lady."</p>

<p>In that instant of intimate revelation Peter's love blazed to
its height, and yet at the back of his head he realised its
hopelessness. Here was one more starkly contrary than Lord
Avelard.</p>

<p>"I would make you a queen," he said, and he lingered over the
words, for he knew that he was nearing an irrevocable choice.</p>

<p>She rose and curtseyed, gravely, without coquetry.</p>

<p>"I am honoured, my lord," she said.</p>

<p>"I love you, Sabine. It is true love with me, for I live with
your face in my heart--I cannot see the light for you--I cannot
pray for the thought of you--I desire you more than my
salvation."</p>

<p>"Than your salvation?" she echoed. "Then you are indeed a
lover and no clerk."</p>

<p>For one moment it seemed as if his ardour awoke in her a like
response. Her face grew gentler, her eyes softened. Peter
realised that her arms were waiting for him. . . . And yet he did
not move. The word "salvation" held him. Was he honest with her,
as she had been with him?</p>

<p>She saw his hesitation, and attributed it to the true motive,
for her voice was cool again.</p>

<p>"I am willing to be a queen . . . I am willing to risk all
hazards by your side, and if you fall to fall with you like a
true wife. . . . But I must be certain that that is indeed your
purpose, my lord. I will not link my fortunes to one who is
half-hearted, for in this cause it must be venture all."</p>

<p>He did not answer, for he was in the throes of a great
temptation. Never had she seemed more desirable. This was not the
shimmering girl with some of the airs of a light-in-love, who had
first enchained his heart, but a woman with greatness in her, a
true queen, a comrade to ride the fords with were they agreed
about the road. His longing was less to have her in his arms than
to see the light of confidence and affection in those clear eyes.
. . . But were they not poles apart? How could he, who had set
common ambition behind him, keep step with one whose heart was
set so firmly on earthly magnificence?</p>

<p>"I will venture all," he said. But as the words left his mouth
he knew that he lied.</p>

<p>She knew it also.</p>

<p>"Your clerkly scruples?" she asked. "My uncle has told me of
them. You would lead an army and yet refuse to provide its
reward. That is mere folly, my lord. This is no perfect world,
and he who believes it such is doomed to fail."</p>

<p>"I will venture my life--my hope--my peace--but not my chance
of Heaven," he said, and his voice in his own ears sounded small
and far away. He realised miserably that he had crossed the
stream and that there was no returning.</p>

<p>Her quick mind saw that here was finality. She laughed
bitterly.</p>

<p>"What kind of gage are these? Life, hope, peace! A common
soldier will risk as much. . . . It is as I thought. You are a
clerk to the bone, and had better get you back to your cell. . .
. Nay, I do not blame you. You have been honest with me, as I
with you. But you are not the one to upset the Welshman. A strong
man will risk soul as well as body, and look to make his ultimate
peace with a God who understands our frailties, since He ordained
them."</p>

<p>She rang the silver bell to summon the servants.</p>

<p>"I will never be your queen, my lord," was her last word, "for
you will never be a king."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter went to his chamber with a chill at his heart. He felt
that in the last hour the youthfulness of the morning had fallen
from him and that he had grown very old. The room was warm and
perfumed, but its comfort deepened his chill. He flung open the
lattice and stared into the night.</p>

<p>Snow was coming. He smelt it, and saw it stored in heavy
clouds under the fitful moon. An owl hooted by the wall, and from
the valley came the sound of wild swans travelling with the wind.
There was a light far off burning in some hollow of the woods. .
. . He drew in his head, and the cold at his heart was lightened.
The splendour of Avelard was not for him, but he had still a
share in the wild elemental world.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c12">CHAPTER XII</a></h1>

<h1>OF THE VISION IN THE SNOW</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Next day they were in the saddle soon after dawn, Lord Avelard
muffled in three cloaks and wearing an extra surcoat. The snow
had not begun to fall, but the world lay under the spell of its
coming. The sky was leaden grey and, though there was no frost,
the earth seemed to be bound in a rigor like an ague; nothing
stirred, not a leaf on the tree or a bird in the bush; the very
streams seemed to hush their flow in a palsy of expectancy. Even
on Peter's young blood the cold smote like a blow.</p>

<p>The old man said not a word of their talk of yesterday. He
seemed to cherish no resentment, and, so far as the discomfort of
the weather permitted, to be in a cheerful humour.</p>

<p>"I am taking you to Neville," he told Peter. "My lord of
Abergaveny is the greatest man on the Marches and can horse five
thousand spears, besides what he can bring from his Welsh dales.
The man is sick--has long been sick--but his spirit burns the
more fiercely in his frail body, and he is also a skilled
soldier. What he lacks in bodily strength will be supplied by his
brethren Sir Thomas and Sir Edward. . . . My lord is your near
kin, for he married your sister by blood, the Lady Mary, now
dead."</p>

<p>"Why is he one of us?" Peter asked. "He stands high at
court."</p>

<p>A laugh like a frog's croak came from the old man.</p>

<p>"He has some matter of private grievance against the Welshman.
Likewise he would increase his estates. He is the richest man in
the west country, for he heired the broad Beauchamp lands, but he
would leave his son still vaster possessions. Speak him fair, my
son, for he has a temper spoiled by much dealing with slippery
Welsh." And he shot at Peter a glance of many meanings.</p>

<p>"Bethink you, my lord, while there is still time," said Peter,
for in the night watches he had been pondering his position. "Am
I the man for your purpose? Would not my lord of Exeter better
serve it?"</p>

<p>"May the mercy of God forbid!" Lord Avelard cried. "The
Nevilles would be posting to London to lay their swords at the
King's feet. The name of Courtenay is not the name of Bohun, and
has no spell to summon England."</p>

<p>They found the chief of the Nevilles in his house of
Marchington by the Severn. He was of the old school, wearing the
clothes of another age, and eschewing the shaven fashion of the
Court, for he had a forked grey beard like the tushes of a boar.
His massive figure had grown bulky, his legs tottered, the colour
of his face was that of his hair, but he had the old habit of
going always armed, and supported indoors a weight of body armour
that might have been at Agincourt. The house had not been changed
since the time of the Edwards, and was a rough draughty place,
very different from the comfort of Avelard. There was a pale
woman flitting in the background, his latest wife, who had once
been his mistress, but she did not come near the strangers, and
the party of three sat in the chilly hall on bare stools, as if
they had met at a leaguer.</p>

<p>Neville looked at Peter long and searchingly.</p>

<p>"Ned's son, by God!" he exclaimed. "I would know that nick in
the upper lip out of ten thousand. You have kept him well hidden,
or some spy of Henry's would have unearthed him, and he would
have tested Henry's mercies. . . . Hark ye, lad, you are my
brother, child though you be, for in your sister, now with God, I
had as good a wife as a man of my habits deserves. You are
abbey-bred and no soldier? So much the better, say I, for you
will leave the business of war to such as understand it. Half
Henry's bungling has come from his belief that he is a new
C&aelig;sar. . . ."</p>

<p>To Peter's surprise this man, whom, according to report, greed
spurred to action in spite of age and sickness, spoke no word of
those ill-omened parchments at Avelard. He was new back from
Wales, and had much to say of the levies due from thence; they
would march on a certain day, so as to be at the meeting-point in
Cotswold by St Lucy's eve. His brother, Sir Thomas, would lead
them; he was even now busy on Usk and Wye. All Gwent and
Powysland would march, and many of the new-settled English would
wear saffron. There was still good fighting stuff in the
dales--bowmen like those of the old wars and squires like Sir
Davy Gam. The grandson of old Rhys ap Thomas was with them, him
who had put Harry's father on the throne--he had seen at Dynevor
the great stirrups used at Bosworth--and as the grandsire had set
up the Tudor so the grandson would help to pull him down. . . .
Then he outlined the plan of campaign, and Peter listened with
some stir in his heart. They would march swiftly on Oxford, which
would at once be surrendered, for they had friends within. It was
altogether needful for their security to have a docile Oxford in
their rear, for the city was the key of the route between Thames
and Severn. . . . But they would not tarry there, though it might
be necessary to hang a few rogues for the general comfort--some
of Crummle's dogs--Dr John London and others. . . . After that
they would not take the valley road to London by way of Windsor;
but would move on the capital in two bodies, one going by the
backside of Chiltern and coming down from the north, the other
keeping the Berkshire and Surrey downs and attacking from the
south.</p>

<p>"We must have hard ground for our march," said the old
campaigner, "for at this season the valleys are swamps. . . .
Also by this device we achieve two mighty ends. Our northern
force cuts in between London and the King's armies in Lincoln and
York, which by all tales are already in some straits, and it will
hinder Henry, too, from drawing support from Suffolk and Norfolk.
Our southern force will sever London from the King's friends in
Kent and on the sea-coast. We shall build a dyke on each side of
him, and the only open country will be to the west, which is the
road of our own folk."</p>

<p>There was immense vigour in the speech and eyes of the old
man, but the strength of his body soon ebbed, and he had to be
laid every now and then on a leathern settle till his breath came
back to him. At the end of one of these bouts Peter found the
sufferer's eyes fixed on him.</p>

<p>"The new brother you have brought me is to my liking, my lord.
He is as handsome a babe as you will see in a year of Sundays.
Have you found him a wife?"</p>

<p>"It is proposed," said Lord Avelard gravely, "that if our
venture succeed, he shall marry the King's daughter, the Lady
Mary."</p>

<p>The old man chuckled.</p>

<p>"Policy, policy! A wise step, doubtless, for the commons have
a weakness for the lady and her sad mother. Also, if she has the
Tudor in one half of her, she has the high blood of Emperors in
the other. But, by the rood of Asseline, she hath an ugly face
and the tint of Cheshire whey. . . . Yet cheer up, brother. 'Tis
no bad thing to have a plain wife, for it whets a man's zest for
other and fairer women. I, who speak, have proved it."</p>

<p>As they rode homeward in the late afternoon Peter's thoughts
were busy. He believed that he read Lord Avelard's purpose--to
allow the matter of the parchments to sleep, but by this very
silence to let Peter commit himself unconsciously, so that, in
the event of victory, he should find over him that stiffest of
compulsions, the will of a victorious army. He had accompanied
him to Marchington to prevent undue candour on his part towards
Neville, though, as it had fallen out, Neville's thoughts had
been on another bent. But why this tale of the daughter of
Catherine, who was devout among the devout?</p>

<p>"You would marry me to the Queen's daughter?" he said to his
companion after a long spell of silence.</p>

<p>"Ay," was the answer, and there was a dry bitterness in the
tone. "You are unworthy of beauty, so we fall back on piety. We
must reap what vantage we can out of your monkish tastes."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The other journeys Peter made alone, for in them it seemed
that Lord Avelard scented no danger. Some were to the houses of
strong squires, who received him as Buckingham's son and would
have kissed his stirrups. At Stanway the family priest, a man
like an ancient prophet, blessed him solemnly, and old Sir John
Tracey and his five sons knelt as at a sacrament. At Burwell he
found a lord so bitter against the King that he asked for no
reward except the hope of seeing the Tudor green and white in the
mire. At Abbots-lease he was met by a hundred men of those deep
pastures, all girt for war, and the banner of the Five Wounds was
consecrated and exalted, and in the burr of Gloucestershire he
heard the old recruiting song of the Crusaders,</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"O man, have pity upon God."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>As he travelled the roads, he realised that Lord Avelard knew
but little of one side of the movement he controlled. The great
lords might rise for worldly profit or private vengeance, but
here in the west, in outland places and among plain men, there
was smouldering the same passion which in Lincoln and the
Yorkshire dales was now bursting into flame. They were ready to
fight, not for the abbeys, maybe, or even for the Church, but for
what they deemed their souls' salvation. In the churchyard of
Ashton-under-Bredon he had listened to the parson chanting to a
pale and weeping crowd of armed peasants the tremendous
prophecies of Zephaniah, and had felt in his own heart the solemn
exaltation of a crusader.</p>

<p><i>"Juxta est dies Domini magni,"</i> the hoarse voice had
risen and fallen like a wandering wind, <i>"dies tribulationis et
angusti&aelig; . . . dies tenebrarum et caliginis . . . dies
tub&aelig; et clangoris super civitates munitas et super angulos
excelsos."</i></p>

<p>For certain these were <i>dies tenebrarum,</i> for the snow
still tarried, though its shadow darkened. On his journeys Peter
was accompanied by six of the Avelard men-at-arms, and by Dickon,
mounted on a grey palfrey, and wearing the black and gold Avelard
liveries. The hill country lay in a gloom, which was not a fog,
for distances could be perceived, but everything was drained of
colour and frozen into a tenebrous monotony. Daily the sky seemed
to sink nearer the earth. The first utter silence had gone. Now,
though there was no wind, the trees and grasses shook and
shivered eerily as if some tremor had passed through the ground.
It was weather to lie heavy on a man's spirits, for not only was
the cold enough to freeze the marrow, but there seemed to be in
the air a dull foreboding. The Avelard varlets never whistled or
sang; there was no merriment at the wayside taverns; the horses,
well fed on grain and therefore likely to be fractious in the
cold air, now plodded like oxen; the sheep had been brought in
from the wolds to wattled shelters, where they huddled shivering
with scared eyes.</p>

<p>One afternoon on the road between Avelard and Colne Peter saw
an encampment by the wayside--half a dozen shelters of boughs and
straw around a great fire which burned cheerfully in the brume.
Tending it was a man with a vast fat face and a paunch like a
promontory, in whom he recognised Timothy Penny-farthing, him
whom they called True Timothy, the master of the palliards. Peter
bade his men ride on with Dickon, and turned aside to the
blaze.</p>

<p>It was as if he had trod on a wasps' nest. Timothy,
unperturbed, continued to feed the fire, but from the beehive
shelters appeared a swarm of foul faces and verminous rags, and
the glitter of many knives.</p>

<p>Peter sat his horse and waited, till Timothy turned his face
towards him, which was not till he had adjusted properly an iron
kettle.</p>

<p>"How far is it to the skirts of Wychwood?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As far as to Peter's Gate," came the answer, delivered
cavalierly, almost insolently.</p>

<p>"Alack," said Peter, "I . . . shall . . . not . . . be . . .
there . . . in . . . time."</p>

<p>The words wrought a miracle. Every foul head disappeared into
its burrow, and Timothy's flitch of a face assumed an expression
of gravity and respect. He came forward from the fire, and bent
his forehead till it touched Peter's left stirrup. Then he led
him a little way apart.</p>

<p>"You have the Word, master. Have you also the message? Solomon
Darking told us that the hour for it was nigh."</p>

<p>"Nigh, but not yet. My command is that you and all wandering
men be ready against the feast of St Lucy."</p>

<p>"Your command, my lord? Then are you he we look for?"</p>

<p>"The same. The same who with Darking attended your parliament
at Little Greece."</p>

<p>"Yon forest lad! Soft in the wits, said Darking. 'Twas a good
jape to put upon the Upright Men." Timothy chuckled. "Have you
any orders for us palliards?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. How go things underground in England?"</p>

<p>"We be awake--awake like badgers in April. When the hour
comes, there will be a fine stirring among our old bones. The
word has gone out among the Upright Men from the Black Mountain
to Ivinghoe Beacon, and south to the seashore, and north to the
Derwent dales. There be much ado, likewise, among the great folk,
but that your lordship knows better than me. . . . There is one
piece of news I had but this morning. They say that the King's
grace is disquieted about the westlands, and may come himself to
cast an eye over them. They say it is his purpose to keep
Christmas at Woodstock."</p>

<p>Peter cried out. "I had heard nothing of that."</p>

<p>The palliard shook his head wisely. "True it may be,
natheless. I had it from a sure hand. 'Twill serve our purpose
nobly, my lord. 'Tis better if the fox blunder into the hounds
than to have to dig him out of his earth."</p>

<p>"Let the word go out," said Peter, "that any further news of
this be brought to me at Avelard."</p>

<p>Timothy nodded.</p>

<p>"It shall go by Solomon Darking." Then he sniffed the air.
"There is but one danger to your cause, my lord. This devil's
weather may upset the wisest plan of lording and vagabond, for
there is no striving against the evil humour of the skies."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" Peter cast his eye over the
darkening landscape, which seemed void of life as a
sepulchre.</p>

<p>"There will be snow," was the answer, "a cruel weight of snow.
Look ye, the hedgehog, when he snuggles down in winter-time,
makes two vents to his cell, one north, one south. He will stop
up neither except for the sternest need. Now he hath stopped up
the north vent. We have seen it in every wood, for we know his
ways and often dig him out for our supper, since a winter
hedgehog will fry like an eel in his own fat. That means snow
such as you and I have not known, for the thing has not happened
in my lifetime, though I have heard my father tell how he saw it
in the black winter of '87. . . . I will tell you another thing.
The dotterels have all gone from High Cotswold. When they come in
flocks it means good weather, but when they leave it means death
to beast and man."</p>

<p>"Snow might serve our purpose well," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Ay, a modest snow, with a frost to bind it. That were noble
weather for armed men. But not mountains of snow which smother
the roads, and above all not melting snow. Your folk will come
from far places and must ford many streams. I dread the melting
wind which makes seas of rivers and lakes of valleys. Robin Hood
feared little above ground, but he feared the thaw-wind."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That night came a message from Darking, who was in south
Cotswold near the Stroud valley, and begged that Peter should go
to him to meet certain doubting squires of those parts. Lord
Avelard approved. "They are small folk in that quarter," he said,
"and therefore the more jealous. 'Twere well to confirm their
loyalty by a sight of you."</p>

<p>So early next morning Peter set out--this time unattended, for
the journey was short, and he proposed to return well before the
darkening.</p>

<p>To his surprise Sabine declared that she would accompany him
for part of the road. She wished to accustom two young eyases to
the hood, and to try the mettle of a new Norway falcon. So, with
a couple of falconers in attendance, the two rode out of Avelard
towards the scarp of the hills and the open country. It meant for
Peter some slight deviation from his route, which should have
lain nearer the valley bottom. The girl was muffled in furs, her
horse had a frieze blanket beneath its saddle, and on her head
she wore a close-fitting bonnet of white ermine.</p>

<p>The weather was changing. The clouds hung closer to earth than
ever, but it was no longer a still cold. Something which was less
a wind than an icy shiver seemed to be coming out of the north.
There was a deathly oppression in it, which weighted Peter's
spirits and kept the chattering falconers dumb. Sabine alone did
not appear to feel it. Her cheeks glowed, her eyes sparkled
within their ermine cincture. She looked the one thing alive in a
world of death.</p>

<p>The hawking proved a farce. For one thing there was no game.
Not a rabbit stirred from the clumps of furze, or hare from the
bracken; there was nowhere the flutter of a wing or the rustle of
a moving beast. The hawks, too, behaved oddly. The eyases clung
dully to their leashes, as if they were mewing, and seemed to
have no wish to get rid of their rufter-hoods. The splendid
Norway tiercel, when cast free, instead of ringing up the sky,
returned to its perch after a short wavering flight, as if it
sought the protection of man. There was no chance of serving it
by showing a quarry, for there was no quarry to show. The cold
bit into the bone, and every now and then came that ominous
shudder from the northern sky.</p>

<p>Even Sabine's youth and health were not proof against the
oppression.</p>

<p>"The world is dead," she said, and there was awe in her light
tones. "I and my hawks must needs go home, for they cannot hunt
in a desert."</p>

<p>Then something in the muffled sky and the menacing air
frightened her.</p>

<p>"This is no weather to be out in, my lord," she turned to
Peter. "Come home with us, for there is mischief afoot. I can
hear its hoofs drumming on the hills." There was anxiety in her
eye, almost kindness.</p>

<p>"I must keep tryst," said Peter. "But I will be back at
Avelard within four hours, and I think I will forestall the
snow."</p>

<p>"At any rate, take one of my men with you," she pled.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I thank you for your kindness, mistress.
But he would only delay me, since I am better mounted. But do you
go back to the fireside, and have a hot posset ready for my
return. I am like to be chilly enough."</p>

<p>"A wilful man must have his way," she said, as she swung her
horse round. "Heaven send the snow tarries. If it come, take the
valley road home, for these hills will be death."</p>

<p>Peter set spurs to his horse, and as his pace quickened the
air cut his face like a file. But he did not regard it, for his
heart was hot within him. Longing for Sabine engulfed him like a
flood. The sudden kindness in her eyes, her glowing figure,
instinct with youth and life among the drooping hawks and pinched
falconers, her soft voice which was like a fire in the winter
cold--these things made him sick with regret. Here was a woman
who was life incarnate, and he had renounced her for a scruple.
Here was one who would be like a lamp in the darkness that
awaited him, and he had rejected that light. . . . He choked down
the thoughts, but they made a weight on his heart and a confusion
in his brain.</p>

<p>He reached the appointed place by noon, and found Darking in
the company of a half-dozen loutish squires who had been passing
the time with dice and strong ale. It is likely that the sight of
Peter was well fitted to impress them, for he came among them
ruddy from the road, and his preoccupation made his manner high
and his speech peremptory as befitted Buckingham's son. There was
no trace of the Oseney clerk in the young lord who spoke as one
accustomed to obedience, and gave orders as sharp and clear as a
huntsman's call to his hounds. Nor was he without
graciousness--the graciousness of one who is ready to give
favours since he is too great to seek them. He could see
Darking's eye on him in the conclave, and in that eye there was a
pleased surprise.</p>

<p>Peter drank a cup with the company, and then called for his
horse. "I must haste me back to Avelard," he told the gaping
squires, "for there are many tasks before me, and the weather
threatens."</p>

<p>Darking looked anxious. "I will accompany my lord," he said.
"I think the snows will break ere the dark."</p>

<p>The others disputed. One older man maintained that there would
be no fall for twenty-four hours, and his neighbours agreed with
him. "The heavens have been frozen," he said, "and now they are
melting, but the drip of them will not reach us before
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You will stay here," Peter told Darking, "and complete the
business of which you have told me. These are not the times to
think about weather."</p>

<p>Darking was still anxious. "You will take the low road, my
lord? There are woods there which will give shelter if the snow
overtakes you."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, his horse refreshed by a mash of grain and
hot ale, Peter swung out of the manor gates and rode south along
the lower slopes of the hills. He was back again among the bitter
thoughts of the morning, but their sting was less sharp. Sabine
was no longer the melting figure that had tortured his fancy on
his outward ride. . . . He remembered now the hard agate edge of
her. She sought that which he could not give her--the giving of
which would mean the loss for ever of his peace. That was the
naked fact, and there was no road round it. And yet, if she were
only a Delilah to tempt him, why did the memory of her so hearten
him? Why did the thought of her seem to brace him to a keener
life, a manlier resolution, if to love her was to lose his
soul?</p>

<p>He was in a wood now, one of the patches of native forest
which clad the western slopes of Cotswold. He knew that the hour
was no more than two o'clock in the afternoon, but already the
darkness seemed to be falling. The sky, seen through the leafless
canopy of oaks, was the sky of night, though below there was
light enough near the ground to discern the path. . . .</p>

<p>A memory cut like a sunbeam into the entanglements of his
thought. It was the memory of some words of St Augustine. How did
they go? <i>Nondum amabam et amare amabam; quaerebam quid amarem,
amans amare.</i> The wise Father had known his mood. Was not this
his own case? "I did not yet love, but I sought something to
love, for I was in love with love." And then there flowed in on
him other recollections, the tale of Eros and Psyche, the
wandering soul and the wandering heart brought at last together.
. . . He had been hungering for something of which Sabine had
been only a shadow.</p>

<p>A strange solemn joy took possession of him. He was being
weaned from the lesser that he might attain the greater. The
sight of Lovell's bones had shattered one kind of earthly
ambition, and now in the girl he had renounced another. He felt a
great tenderness warm him so that the cold, which he had felt
acutely at the start of the afternoon's journey, seemed a trivial
thing. . . .</p>

<p>He noticed that the snow had begun. A thin powder was
filtering down through the branches.</p>

<p>The road left the patch of wood for open hill, and there he
rode into a new world. It was dark with a misty white gloom, for
the air was thick with snow. The powder had changed to heavy
flakes, but he saw them only on his horse's neck and on his
saddle, for what descended seemed to be a solid thing, as if a
cloud had taken material form and enveloped the earth. The weight
of it pressed down on him like a blanket, and he noted that the
ground seemed to be rising towards him. Already his horse's feet
were sunk above the hocks. "At this pace," he thought, "there
will be six feet of snow in an hour, and I shall assuredly be
buried."</p>

<p>Presently the wall did not drop vertically, but seemed to sway
towards him, as if under the compulsion of a secret wind. The
impact took the breath from him, and his horse stumbled. He felt
himself encrusted with ice, which filled eyes and mouth and nose,
and sent cold fingers under his garments. These swaying onrushes
were intermittent, but at the impact of each his horse crouched
and slipped, and he bent his head as if to avoid a blow. There
was as yet no wind--only a shivering of earth and sky. "It looks
as if I must find a shelter," he thought--and there was no fear
in his heart, but a comfortable confusion--"for another hour of
this will destroy me."</p>

<p>He was among trees again, but he only knew it by the struggles
of his horse among the lower scrub and the scraping of laden
branches in his face. . . . And then the shuddering, which had
bent the snowfall against him like a billow, changed to a fury of
wind. He was in a patch of forest at the foot of a cleeve of the
hills, and the northern blast, from which the slopes had hitherto
sheltered him, swept down the cleeve as through a funnel. The
trees bent on him and shook off avalanches. He felt himself
smothered, stifled, his wits dazed by the ceaseless lashing of
boughs and the steady buffets of the snow. His horse was in
desperate case, for the track had long been lost, and the two
floundered among dead trunks and holes, with no purpose except to
escape, though it were only for a moment, that torturing
blast.</p>

<p>He tried to think, to plan. Progress was impossible--was there
no chance of a shelter? . . . But this wood seemed to be swept to
its roots, for the turmoil in the air was matched by a like
turmoil on the ground, where the snow was being swirled by the
wind into fantastic heaps and hollows. His head was confused, but
his heart was calm. "This looks like death," he thought. "This
beast of mine will soon go down, and we shall both lie cold in a
drift."</p>

<p>What time he parted company with his horse he did not know.
The struggle for mere breath was so cruel that he was scarcely
conscious of the rest of his body. But somewhere in a drift the
animal slipped and did not rise, and Peter must have been thrown,
and gone forward on foot, under the impulse which demanded
movement to escape from torment. At any rate he found himself
engulfed to the middle in whirling snow, every step a task for
Hercules. . . . He had a pain in his left shoulder, where some
branch had struck him. Of this he was dimly conscious, and he was
conscious too of a great weakness. It would have been despair if
he had had any fear; but fear there was none, so it was only
weakness--a creeping lassitude which bade him drop down and
sleep. But as there was no shelter anywhere he could not sleep,
because of the sting of the gale, so he kept moving like a
marionette whose limbs are jerked by some alien power. "If I once
lie down, I shall never rise," he told himself, with conviction
but without panic. It did not seem to matter greatly--if only
this blizzard would stop scourging him.</p>

<p>He stumbled into an aisle of the forest where, by some freak
of the wind, the ground had been swept almost bare of snow. Here
his limbs moved more freely, and this freedom brought a momentary
clearness to his brain. . . . He knew that he was very near the
end of his strength; if he dropped here on the bare ground he
would freeze to death, if in the drifts he would soon be buried.
His spirit seemed to hover above him, careless and incurious,
watching the antics of his feeble body. The misery now was less
acute, for his senses were numbing. It occurred to him that this
was an occasion for prayer--occurred merely as a notion of the
mind, without any tremor of the heart. The prayer which came to
his lips was that invocation to the Mother of God which had been
his favourite in childhood:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Imperatrix supernorum,</i><br>
 <i>Superatrix infernorum."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a great peace in the world. The inferno of
the gale seemed to be stilled, and the darkness to lighten . . .
something lifted from his brain and his eyes opened. He saw that
he was in a forest aisle like a cave in an ice-wall, and before
him a light was glowing. And in that light was a figure. . .
.</p>

<p>Once a Florentine, who had come to Oxford to study a codex in
Duke Humphry's library, had told him of the great statues of the
Greeks, destroyed these thousand years by barbarian hands. The
Athene of the Parthenon, he said, had been no colourless pale
marble, but had had a face of ivory, and eyes of flaming jewels,
and delicate tresses of wrought gold. Peter had dreamed of this
marvel, and now in this icy place it stood before him. . . . It
was a woman's figure, a woman with a celestial face, helmed and
panoplied with gold, her garments shining with other colours than
those of earth. In her face was a great peace and a great
gentleness. . . . He had one half-moment of clarity. "Am I dead?"
he asked, "and in Paradise?" He told himself that that could not
be, for he was conscious of an aching left shoulder, and the
blessed do not suffer pain.</p>

<p>Then his soul lost its frozen calm, and life of a kind
returned to the channels of his heart. For suddenly it seemed to
him that what he saw was no statue, but a living presence. The
gold and jewels dimmed and shone again in a milder light, the
face melted to a human softness, and in the unearthly radiance
that surrounded her he saw that the draperies about her breast
were that heavenly blue which it is given to one alone to wear. .
. . He knew that he was looking upon the Mother of God.</p>

<p>He stood, or lay, or knelt--he was beyond consciousness of the
body--and gazed upward with wondering rapture. He had heard it
said that the Blessed Trinity ruled in turn, and that the reign
of the Father and of the Son had passed, and that now was the
reign of the Holy Spirit. But, since men must have their special
worship, his had always been for the Virgin, who stood between
man and the harshness of eternal justice. She was Woman, Mother
and Queen alike, who loved beauty and simple things and did not
greatly relish the cold cloisters of piety. She was divine, but
like Prometheus she had brought fire to men. . . . Her face was
grave, for she had known infinite sorrow, and it was proud, since
she carried the keys of Heaven; but it had tenderness and humour,
too, for she had been human and loved humanity. She was stronger
than the greatest warriors, and wiser than the wisest, the woman
enthroned to whom all men must bow in the end. She was the hope
of the world, for she made even mortality divine; she was the
Power above the Law, who brought mercy into justice and
tenderness into the sublimities of Son and Father. She was the
protectress of man against fate, his one way of escape from the
punishment of soul and body. . . .</p>

<p>As he gaped, it seemed to him that in that face he saw every
dream of his childhood and youth--the dim heights of devotion to
which in Oseney Great Church he had mounted on waves of
music--the glory of the fields in May--the joy of young
blood--the vision of shimmering nymphs and slim goddesses out of
old poets--the solemn rapture of the philosophers. Sabine, too,
was in her, for she was very woman--Sabine's witchery and Mother
Sweetbread's tenderness; queen she was, but peasant too--peasant
and gipsy. To those immortal eyes the little conventions of
mankind were folly, but even to folly they were kind. . . .</p>

<p>As his senses slipped from him, he thought clearly for one
moment, "I have seen the Queen of Heaven. Now I know that I shall
not die, but live."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It took True Timothy and his palliards, who were encamped in
the wood, a good two hours to bring life back to Peter, though
they wrought hard with strong hands and rough cordials.</p>

<p>"'Twas lucky that the grew-bitch went hunting," said Timothy,
shivering under his mountain of rags, for fat chills fast. "Else
there had been a stiff lording in Batt's Wood and a new-comer at
Peter's gate."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h1>

<h1>THE UNLOOSING OF THE WATERS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter lay two days abed at Avelard, while the snow muffled the
land, made plains of villages, and built new mountains on the
levels. Recovering from a great fatigue is in early youth a
pleasant thing. Weakness, after a man has slept his fill, passes
into a delicious languor, hourly the blood runs more strongly in
the veins, hunger revives, the scents and sounds of a recovered
life come with a virgin freshness. . . . Peter lay in a
delectable dream, while Sabine brought his meals--first possets
of ewes' milk and white claret, then eggs beaten up with
cordials, till his restored strength demanded solider fare. He
looked at her without embarrassment--nay, with a kind of cool
affection. She was part of the beatific vision he had seen, but
part only: now he had gotten a divine discontent and had his mind
on the stars.</p>

<p>He rose on the third day, a whole man in body and a new man in
spirit. He had come suddenly to maturity, and all the hesitations
and doubts of his youth had dropped from him like an old cloak.
He felt himself in the mood for command. He could now bend men to
his will, for his purpose was a clear flame. No hazard was too
great, for he had lost fear. The word of the Israelitish prophet
rang in his ears: "Who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of
a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made
as grass?"</p>

<p>When on the third day he met Lord Avelard he found that the
awe in which he had always held him had gone. This was an old man
he looked on, an old man near the end of his days, tramping
wearily in the world's mire. Such an one could not mould the
fates of the land; it was very necessary that he himself should
be up and doing. Peter felt his youth and vigour surge within him
like springtide.</p>

<p>"You are like Phoebus new-risen," said the old man, and there
was that in his eye which wondered. This man that stood before
him was not the stripling he had known.</p>

<p>"I feel within me the strength of ten," Peter replied. "In
four days, my lord, it will be St Lucy's feast. I must be
stirring. What news of the King?"</p>

<p>"Darking came here yesterday. The Welshman will pass Christmas
at Woodstock. He leaves Windsor to-morrow, and will travel by
Reading and Watlington and Hasely. That is his accustomed road,
but hitherto he has made his progresses in the height of summer,
or in September when the buck are fat. What is his purpose, think
you? By the rules of common wisdom he should sit snug in Windsor,
or, if he move, go north to the Yorkshire dales, where the
trouble waxes daily. 'Tis said he has pardoned the chief rebels
there, but his clemency has not abated the discontent."</p>

<p>"He must have news which makes him fear the west more than the
north."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard nodded.</p>

<p>"Doubtless. And that is the doing of Crummle and his vagabond
commissaries. They have been into every abbey on Thames and
Severn, and though our plans are well guarded we could not hope
that some rumours of them would not escape. The Welshman wishes
to learn our condition for himself and, if need be, to strike the
first blow. I think that purpose will miscarry."</p>

<p>"What force does he bring to Woodstock?"</p>

<p>"No more than a hundred mounted men of my lord Shrewsbury's. .
. . Elsewhere things go happily for us. As I told you, Henry has
broke with the Emperor and is now hotly abetting the French King.
Therefore the Emperor is with us, and he is sending money--his
legate Reginald Pole, him that is Clarence's grandson, is even
now awaiting a ship on the Flanders coast. Also James of Scotland
is moving on the northern marches, and his holiness of Durham
will find it hard to stay him. There is good news, too, of my
lord of Exeter. It seems that the Cornishmen would make him king,
but my lord's heart fails him for such a flight. All he seeks is
the Welshman's downfall, and at the word from us he will march on
Bristol."</p>

<p>"But what of the King at Woodstock? He may be at Avelard gate
while we are busy with our muster."</p>

<p>Lord Avelard smiled. "That is not the way of the King's grace.
He will sit snug in Woodstock and send out intelligencers, and it
will be odds against those intelligencers ever returning.
Besides, the snow will hamper him. You cannot ride fast on
muffled roads."</p>

<p>Then the two fell to the study of papers and plans. What had
hitherto been to Peter a half-understood game which he was
content to leave to others had now become a passionate absorption
on which his mind worked with precision and speed. He asked a
hundred questions; he pressed for exact answers; he made
computations of his own, and questioned some of the details of
Neville's plan. Lord Avelard opened his eyes. "These last days
you have become a soldier, my son," he said. "No doubt the gift
was in your blood, but what has brought it to birth? Whence got
you the light?"</p>

<p>"As Paul got it on the road to Damascus," said Peter and
turned again to the papers.</p>

<p>"I must go abroad," he said at last. "There are loose nails
which need a hammer to drive them home, and the time grows scant.
There will be many of the commons that cry out for the Five
Wounds and the Holy Blood of Hailes, while the watchword of the
lords will be God and the Swan. I must be the one to blend the
two into a single army."</p>

<p>"Then God prosper you, for you will find it no mean labour.
There is much wild stuff about in this west of ours. There is a
mad Carmelite, who claims that his order descends from Elijah and
that he is Elijah reincarnate, sent by God to hew down the groves
of Baal--by which groves he signifies the King's Court and
Council. He and his like will need a stout spur to break to
harness."</p>

<p>"I must be that spur," said Peter.</p>

<p>Lord Avelard looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"There are ill tidings from Marchington," he said. "It seems
that my lord Abergaveny is mortal sick and like to die. He has
been frail these last months, and has ridden his body too hard.
He was to be our leader in the field, for he has more skill of
war than Norfolk and Suffolk and Shrewsbury joined together. His
brother, Sir Thomas, is in Wales, bringing in the hill levies. If
my lord should die, the other brother, Sir Edward, must take his
place."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Peter, "there can be but one commander, and I am
he. I, and no other, am Bohun. . . . This afternoon I ride to
Marchington."</p>

<p>A smile, mingled of humorous surprise, respect and kindliness,
broke over the waxen face.</p>

<p>"I commend your spirit, my son. You have assuredly seen a
great light. . . . But you cannot yet ride to Marchington. The
snow has ceased falling, but it lies twelve feet deep in every
hollow, and Marchington is in the river meadows. You must wait
for friendlier weather. I think the change is nigh, for the wind
is shifting. What we want is a binding frost which will last till
the new year, to set a crust on the snow and make easy
travelling. For, as you well know, our people have far to
come."</p>

<p>But that afternoon the wind moved not to the east as some had
foretold, but against the sun into the west. Out in the drifts of
the park, which had been hard enough for a man to walk on, Peter
noted the thaw beginning before the dark fell. In his bed that
night he found his blankets too heavy and the room airless, and
when he opened the lattice a mild wind fanned his face. At
sunrise he saw a strange sight. A black thundercloud swamped the
sky, from which the lightning flashed, and the waning moon in
that strange radiance showed red as blood.</p>

<p>Then, in one unbroken and relentless deluge, came the
rain.</p>

<p>Never in the memory of the oldest man had the fountains of
heaven been thus unloosed. It fell as the snow had fallen--as if
the clouds were bags of water which drooped near the ground and
then discharged themselves in an even torrent. Under the red dawn
the earth had been one vast white counterpane, running into hills
and ridges, but otherwise unfeatured. By midday it was already
piebald. Forests were showing sodden crests, the scarp of
Cotswold had resumed its normal shape, every lane was a rushing
river where nothing mortal could live. The silence of the
snowbound world was exchanged for a devil's kitchen of sound--the
unending beat of the falling rain, the rumour of cascading
waters, the sudden soft crush which told that a slope had melted
into mud or that a tall tree had slipped down to join the chaos
in the valley.</p>

<p>In such weather no man durst tempt the roads. With bitten lips
Peter sat in his chamber, watching the grey mists droop over
Severn. In two days the hour of destiny would strike, and how
could men muster in a dissolving world? . . . Again and again he
essayed the out-of-doors, only to be driven back by the deluge.
He had a horse saddled, but the beast could not progress a
hundred yards on what had once been dry Cotswold slopes but were
now a slippery glacis of mud. . . . What would the rivers be like
in another day and night? The air was too thick to give him any
prospect, but he could hear Severn--miles away--roaring like an
ocean. And what of Usk and Wye and Teme and Clun, which the
Marchmen must cross? What of Avon which guarded Warwickshire?
What of the little rivers which barred the road to Oxford? What,
above all, of the northern streams which lay in the path of
Westmoreland and Cumberland and the Stanleys?</p>

<p>It rained for seventy-three hours, till the eve of St Lucy,
just before the darkening. There was not a speck of snow left
except some dirty streaks in the lee of walls and ditches. Every
inch of soil was sodden a yard deep, and when the sky cleared
towards sunset Severn was seen to be the better part of a mile
wide, a turbid lagoon like an arm of the sea.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At dawn on St Lucy's day Peter rode to Marchington. The air
was as mild as June, the sun shone through a watery mist, and
everywhere rose pale exhalations from the infinity of floods.
Often he had to swim his horse across meres which had once been
Cotswold meads, strange waters indeed, for instead of clumps of
rushes to stud them they had the tops of thorn trees. Marchington
moat was a swirling torrent, and Peter had to leave his horse on
the near side, and make a perilous passage of the drawbridge on
foot.</p>

<p>He found death within. The old lord had given up the ghost two
days before, and now lay in grim state in the hall under a
splendid mortcloth till such time as he could be moved to the
family sepulchre. The pale wife flitted in the background like a
shade. Beside the dead stood an angry man whose lantern jaws and
drooping nose proclaimed his kinship.</p>

<p>"Here is the confusion of Hell," the man cried. "Brother
George is a corpse and brother Thomas is in Wales and Noah's
flood roars between us. The new lord--my nephew and yours, young
sir--is with his cousins in Kent. The house of Neville is most
plaguily scattered at this hour when it should be bound tight
together, and they tell me that Henry is in Woodstock waiting to
pounce like a crow on our broken meats. God's wounds, but the
Devil has come to his own these days!"</p>

<p>"There will be no crossing Bran or Towey or Usk or Wye for a
sennight," Sir Edward went on, "and that only if the rain holds
off, and a man might as well hope to swim the Narrow Seas as to
ford Severn. And there is still rain to come. . . . So says my
armourer, and he can smell it a week off in the sky."</p>

<p>It was long before Peter could divert him from his passionate
maledictions, uttered often in a strange tongue, for he had lived
much with the mountain folk.</p>

<p>"Our spearhead is the Welsh," he ended, "who can march thirty
miles in a day and then fight like wild-cats; and where in God's
name are the Welsh? Sitting by smoky fires on the sodden ground
watching the rivers roar to the sea. Sorry am I for him that
comes within a mile of brother Thomas, for his temper will be
like a flaming oven. . . . Ay, they could march a circuit by the
river heads, but 'twould take them a month to reach us, and by
that time all England would be agog. Our blow was to be secret
and swift, and now 'twill be as slow as the stumbling of a woman
in labour. . . . 'Tis no better up north. If Severn is swollen,
so likewise will be Avon, and Avon, flowing through the
marshlands, will not decline till Easter. And what of Shropshire
and Cheshire and Lancashire and Westmoreland? We are islanded
here on a knuckle of Cotswold and cut off from all England. The
King has got a better ally in this devil's weather than a
thousand Norfolks. 'Tis your family blight, my lord. Duke Harry,
your grandsire, in Richard's day perished because of the same
accursed floods."</p>

<p>In the end Sir Edward's passion spent itself, and he spoke
soberly.</p>

<p>"My counsel is to let our levy dissolve, even as the hillsides
have melted in the rain. The weather, which has frustrated it,
will also conceal it. For a month this west country will be a
secret land, with none coming or going, and Henry at Woodstock
may guess as he likes, but he will have no proof to offer
Council. I will contrive to get word to brother Thomas and to the
northern lords. Let my lord Avelard make haste to Woodstock to
forestall gossip, and invite his liege lord to a merry-making at
Avelard. . . . The Cotswold men, you say? Nay, they are too few,
and without the Welsh behind them they will not stir. Sudely and
Boteler and Noel are shrewd folk, and the wool-staplers are
shrewder. Here and there you may get a mad squire or a mad priest
to run his head into the noose, but not the solid men. . . . As
for you, my lord, my counsel is that you get you back to Avelard,
and lie as close as the fox till the King goes eastward again.
You may thank the mercies of God that you have not yet shown
yourself in the light of day."</p>

<p>Peter argued and pled, but the man was stubborn. He had his
nephew to think of, whose guardian he now was, and he would not
fling away the Neville and Beauchamp lands on any wild
hazard.</p>

<p>From Marchington Peter rode north to the squires that lived on
the slopes looking toward Avon. From the Traceys he got some
comfort; that stout house would mount for God and the Swan though
not a Welshman crossed Severn. But the Traceys were alone in
their careless valour; elsewhere he found only long faces and
heads cautiously shaken. From one spur he got a prospect which
confirmed his worst fears. The vale of Evesham was a sea from
which the tops of trees and church towers rose like foundered
ships. With Avon and Severn thus swollen the road from the north
was securely barred.</p>

<p>On his way back to Avelard he fell in with a white friar, the
very Carmelite who claimed to be Elijah's successor. The man sat
beside a sheepfold, sodden and travel-worn, muttering prayers. By
some strange divination he seemed to recognise Peter--or perhaps
took him for some local leader--for he seized his bridle, and
poured forth a torrent of ravings, mingled with texts from the
Apocalypse.</p>

<p>"Fear not, my son," he cried. "The word of God is with me, His
prophet, to bid you go up against the evil city--the city which
is spiritually called Sodom and Babylon, where also our Lord was
crucified. The windows of Heaven have been opened, but not in
your despite, for the waters will cumber the evil ones, but for
you they will be cleft apart as the Red Sea at the command of
Moses. I say unto you that a handful will put to flight ten
thousand, and three banded in God's name will become a
multitude."</p>

<p>The man was mad, but there was method in his madness, for he
preached what to Peter seemed good strategy. Let them go up at
once against the city--whether Oxford or London was not
clear--for every delay would enable the ungodly to assemble,
whereas, if taken by surprise, they would be shepherdless sheep.
The wild figure in that lonely hollow of the hills, rugged as a
tree against the twilit sky, affected him strangely. He
dismounted, and knelt to receive the Carmelite's blessing. And,
as he cantered through the soaked Avelard meadows, he felt his
resolution grow more desperate. If the odds were weighted against
him so much the more work for God's hand. . . . Besides, were the
odds really increased? What crippled them and shore their levy of
its strength would likewise cripple and lull their enemies.</p>

<p>At Avelard he found Darking. He had come from the east, and
reported mighty floods in the Oxford rivers. Nevertheless, they
could be passed by men who knew the ways of them. . . . The King
had reached Woodstock. He had with him an escort of Shrewsbury's
men, but he had also called for levies from the local lords,
avowedly for the Yorkshire campaign, where the rising of peasants
and gentry might at any moment be increased by the advent of the
King of Scots. . . . Meanwhile he was hunting in the great park,
so far as the weather allowed, since the open winter had kept the
deer in season. . . . Crummle had been with him, but had now
returned to London. He had a posse of secretaries, but none of
the great lords of the Council. . . . And then he added a piece
of news which made Lord Avelard frown. Sir Gabriel Messynger was
with him, specially summoned out of Kent.</p>

<p>It was plain that Lord Avelard was in deep perplexity. He was
of a stouter heart than Sir Edward Neville, or maybe had more to
gain and lose. He was not ready to give up an enterprise which
had been so long the chief preoccupation of his brain. On the
other hand, he had none of the simple passion of the Traceys, and
had no mind to go crusading unless there was a reasonable chance
of victory. He laughed to scorn the Neville advice that he should
go forthwith to Woodstock and seek the King's favour. "I shall
bide here," he said. "The next move is for the Welshman to make.
He knows nothing of what we have done, and will know nothing,
unless he clap all the west country in prison and put it to the
rack. Our secret is confined to true men."</p>

<p>"What of Sir Gabriel?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>Lord Avelard replied with a laugh in which to Peter's ear
there was a trace of disquiet.</p>

<p>"Sir Gabriel is the deepest involved of any. He was our
go-between to the northern lords, and has twice followed Neville
into Wales. There is nothing new in his going to Court. He was
bred there as a youth, whence the touch of the popinjay in his
manners."</p>

<p>"We cannot sit idle," said Peter. "Either we must do as Sir
Edward advises, send word to Wales and the north, and call off
all preparations. Or we must strike now, trusting to win such
vantage that, when the floods abate and our army arrives, we
shall be able to use it to deadly purpose."</p>

<p>Darking nodded, as if in agreement, but Lord Avelard flung up
his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>"How in God's name can we strike? We have nothing at our
command but our Cotswold neighbours, and you have seen their mood
to-day. We might take Oxford by a bold stroke, but we should be
scattered long before we were twenty miles on the London
road."</p>

<p>"Assuredly," said Peter. "My mind was not on London, for it is
certain that we must revise our plan."</p>

<p>"Then where? Oxford is useless, except as a step. Windsor is
seventy miles off. . . ."</p>

<p>"It has come nearer these last days. I think Windsor is now in
Woodstock park."</p>

<p>The old man stared and Darking smiled.</p>

<p>"See, my lord," Peter went on. He had risen from his chair and
stood in the glow of the hearth, tall and straight, tense as a
strung bow. His face had lost all the softness of the boy's, and
was set in hard lines.</p>

<p>"See, my lord. I am Bohun, and it is right that I run the
chief hazard. The King is at Woodstock by God's grace, and has
but a small force to guard him. What of the Oxford squires?" He
turned to Darking.</p>

<p>"Sir Ferdinando Fettiplace with twenty men rode to Woodstock
this morning, but he was sent back to Swinbrook to wait further
commands. With the waters out the muster will be slow."</p>

<p>"That is well. The King has but the Shrewsbury men around him
and the park rangers. Give me a hundred spears, and, so be they
are true folk, I will engage to bring the King's grace captive to
Avelard. . . . Then, when our own men muster, we shall confront a
leaderless enemy. We have the chance to seize on the very keep
and citadel of the foe, and there are enough stout fellows in
Cotswold for the work. . . . If the venture succeed, then we are
three parts of the road to the freeing of England. If it fail,
some honest lads will go to Paradise, among them a nameless clerk
of Oseney."</p>

<p>The old man gazed at the speaker, and into his face came a
sudden flush which told of something deeply stirred in his
heart.</p>

<p>"'Fore God," he cried, "you are true Bohun! True Bohun and
true Percy, for old Hotspur has come to life in you. God go with
you, my son. There is a madness that is better than wisdom."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h1>

<h1>HOW PETER STROVE WITH POWERS AND PRINCIPALITIES</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>St Thomas's eve was quiet and very mild. There had been no
winds to abate the flood-water and dry the sodden meadows, so the
valleys were still lagoons and every rivulet an encroaching mere.
The rendezvous was in the distant hollows of Wychwood, and
thither the little bands from the western Cotswold moved under
cover of night.</p>

<p>Peter, with Dickon and a dozen picked Avelard men, took the
road by Stow, where the wolds made easy travelling. Word had come
that the bridge at Charlbury could be passed, the only crossing
of Evenlode, and such a route would take them over Windrush near
its source. All were to move slowly and secretly, keeping to
cover by day, and making the next stage in the darkness. There
were to be no liveries or badges among them, but each man as drab
as a deer-stealer.</p>

<p>At cockcrow, when they stopped for meat on Naunton downs, the
Carmelite came out of the shadows, his white gown showing in the
half-light like a monstrous owl. He knelt and mumbled Peter's
hand, and then his wild eyes scanned his following, and he cried
out like a man in pain:</p>

<p>"Where is the trampling of the horsemen?" he screamed, "the
mighty array that should sweep the hosts of Midian into the deep
ocean? I see but a handful of country folk! Where is your army,
my lord? Remember, you go up against the great city of Babel, and
her towers are iron and her battlements of hewn stone."</p>

<p>The man was not easy to soothe.</p>

<p>"The others will come in good time, father," Peter told him.
"We are only like the scouts sent out by Joshua to spy the land.
Get you back to your cell, for you can help best by your prayers.
We travel secretly and your exhortations may do us a
mischief."</p>

<p>In the end he flitted off, his arms waving and his voice
falling and rising in what seemed now a chant and now a moan; but
Peter noted with disquiet that the road he took was not west but
east.</p>

<p>At Slaughter, where the little river was ill to ford, there
was a mad woman in the hamlet who found their camping place in
the woods. She seemed to divine their purpose, for she cried
around them like a lost soul. It seemed that she was come to
warn, and the Avelard men's faces blanched at the sight of
her.</p>

<p>"Back to your homes, my darlings," she cried. "I see blood in
Evenlode, and blood in Glyme, and blood in Cherwell, which all
the floods will not wash away. That road there are pretty lads
hanging on every tree. Back to your sweethearts, for there are no
honest maids where you be going."</p>

<p>Over Peter's shoulder she flung a ragged wreath of holly and
ivy, such as are made for the Christmas pleasantries.</p>

<p>"May your lordship's grace be decked with no harsher crown!"
she cried, and then fled babbling into the covert.</p>

<p>It was clear that strange rumours had gone abroad in the
countryside, for, stealthy as was their journey, they seemed to
be expected. If in the twilight they skirted a village street,
the doors were shut, but there were curious eyes at the windows.
The children had been forewarned; they stared with open mouths,
but spoke no word, and did not run away. The Avelard men, who had
been advised of the deep secrecy of the journey, were perturbed
by this atmosphere of expectation, and spoke aside among
themselves. Peter scarcely noticed it. His thoughts had flung
ahead, out of this sheepwalk country to the glades of Woodstock,
where somewhere a ruddy man was breathing his horse and looking
doubtfully towards the west.</p>

<p>At Chadlington in the early hours of the night Darking met
them.</p>

<p>"Evenlode runs like a mill-leat," he said, "but the causeway
holds. I can guide you across, my lord. Others are before you,
and I have left those who will lead them to their appointed
places. Pity you have drawn your folk from High Cotswold, where
there is nought but thorns a man's height. Our work will be in a
forest, and these Tracey lads have never seen the tall trees and
are easily mazed among them."</p>

<p>Darking brought news of the King. "I have passed the word
among the Upright Men," he said, "and there are many quick eyes
in the Woodstock coverts. See, my lord, yon spark of light in the
valley. That is Little Greece, where old John Naps now sits at
the receipt of custom. He will be eyes and brain to us. . . .
King Harry is snug at Woodstock with my lord Shrewsbury's men to
guard him. He hunts daily, but only in the park, for the floods
have narrowed his venue. Glyme is a young ocean, and Evenlode
below Wilcote fills the vale to the brim. I doubt if we have seen
the end of this overflow. The snow-cap on High Cotswold is still
melting with the mild air, as your lordship has seen this day,
and that will prevent the streams abating. Nay, they may rise
higher yet, for in certain valleys lakes have formed through the
damming of trees and sliding earth, and any hour the dams may
break and send down a new deluge. It is fickle weather for our
enterprise, and we be terribly at the mercy of God.</p>

<p>"What keeps the King in keeps us out," he went on. "There is
nothing to be done inside the pales of Woodstock, where every
furlong has its verderer. We are like a troop sitting round a
fortalice which it cannot enter. . . . Heaven send the weather
let Harry go forth. That is what he longs for, since the hunting
in the park is a child's game to the hunting in the forest. 'Tis
the great yeld hinds of Wychwood that he seeks. Pray for a cold
wind and a drying wind, so long as it do not freeze."</p>

<p>Darking guided them skilfully across the Charlbury bridge. A
causeway of hewn stone led up to it at either end, but this was
hidden in the acres of eddying water. A man who did not know the
road would have slipped into the swirl, but Darking kept them on
the causeway, where the stream was not beyond the horses'
withers. Presently they were on the arch of the bridge, and then
on the farther causeway, where the eddies were gentle, and then
on the hard ground of the forest slopes. By midnight they were
encamped in a dingle of dead bracken, hidden as securely as if
they had lain in the Welsh hills.</p>

<p>There were five such encampments within the forest bounds, and
by the next morning all the men had arrived--a hundred picked
spearmen, some of them old soldiers of the French wars, all of
them hard and trusty and silent. For the present their task was
to lie hidden, and they were safe enough from prying eyes, for
the King had appointed no new keeper of Wychwood in the place of
the dead Norris, and every ranger and verderer was Darking's man.
Also there was an outer guard of the vagabonds under the orders
of John Naps at Little Greece.</p>

<p>Peter inspected the five companies and approved, but Darking
shook his head. "They are lithe fellows, but they belong to the
bare hills. Stout arms, no doubt, in a mellay, and good horsemen
in the open, but I cannot tell how they will shape in our forest
work. They are a thought too heavy-footed for that secret
business. God send our chance comes in the open."</p>

<p>It was a blue day, mild and sunny, with but a breath of wind,
and that soft from the south.</p>

<p>"We are for Woodstock park, my lord," said Darking. "You and I
alone, and on foot, for we go as spies. Follow my lightest word,
for your life may hang on it. And shed most of your garments. The
air is mild and there is swimming before us."</p>

<p>In shirt and hose and deerskin shoes they made for the old
bridge below Finstock, which a week before had been swept down to
Thames. Here Evenlode ran for ordinary in a narrow stream which
spread into a broad mill-pond. Now it was all one waste of brown
torrent. Darking led the way to the end of the broken pier of the
bridge. "The current will bear us down to the slack water beyond
the hazels. Trust your body to it, and swim but a stroke or two,
enough to keep your head up. Then, when I give the word, strike
hard for the other shore. The rub is to get out of the stream
once it has laid hold of you."</p>

<p>So Peter found it. The torrent swept him down easily and
pleasantly, till he was near the submerged hazel clump. Then
Darking struck off left handed, and it was no easy task to get
rid of the entangling current, which would have carried him into
a maelstrom of broken water. It plucked at his shoulders, and
gripped his feet with unseen hands. But, breathless and battered,
in five minutes they were shaking themselves among the rushes of
the farther bank.</p>

<p>"Let us stretch a leg," said Darking, "or we will chill, and
maybe be late for the fair. The King's grace on a day like this
is early abroad."</p>

<p>They were now within the pale of Woodstock, but they had four
miles to go before they reached the wilderness of green glades
and coppices which was the favourite hunting-ground. An hour
later Darking had his ear to the ground, and then stood like a
dog at gaze. "I can hear horses," he said, "maybe a mile distant.
I could hear them better if the earth were less full of rain.
Also the hounds are out. I judge they are in Combe Bottom. If
they unharbour a deer there, with what there is of wind it will
come our way. Let us harbour ourselves, my lord. No, not on the
ground, for that might give our scent and turn the deer or lure
the hounds. This oak will be screen enough."</p>

<p>He caught a spreading limb of the tree and swung himself into
a crutch. Peter followed, and found that he had a long vista down
an aisle of rough grass. Now he could hear the hounds giving
tongue in some thicket, but that was the only sound. . . . He
might have been listening to mongrels hunting alone in a covert,
for there were no horns, or human cries, or the jingle of
bridles.</p>

<p>Presently the hounds seemed to come nearer. A cloud of pigeons
rose from the opposite trees, and a young buck, a two-year-old at
the most, stuck out his head, sniffed the air, and proceeded to
amble up the glade. He may have caught a whiff of their wind, for
he turned back to covert.</p>

<p>Then the world woke to life. A big old hind, barren by her
grey muzzle and narrow flanks, broke from the wood, and behind
her the covert was suddenly filled with a babel of noise. The
first hounds streamed out, fifty yards behind; and two sweating
beaters in blue smocks, who had been stationed there to turn the
hind to the open glades, stumbled after them and promptly flung
themselves on the ground. In a second they were up again, for a
horn was blown behind them.</p>

<p>From an alley in the opposite woods the huntsmen appeared,
debouching into the broader aisle. There were five of them--three
in livery, with badges in their hats and horns at their saddle
bows; one young man with a doublet of crimson velvet, a plumed
cap and a monstrous jewel; the fifth a big man who rode first and
waved his hand and shouted hoarsely. Peter, from his crutch in
the oak, craned his head through the leafless boughs and watched
intently. For he knew that he was looking upon the King.</p>

<p>He was plainly dressed, with trunk hose of brown leather and a
green doublet with a jewel at his throat. A heavy silver-handled
hunting-knife hung at his belt. His horse was a big-boned Fleming
with a ewe-neck, and he handled it masterfully; for all his
weight his seat was exquisitely balanced and the big hands were
light on his beast's mouth. The face was vast and red as a new
ham, a sheer mountain of a face, for it was as broad as it was
long, and the small features seemed to give it a profile like an
egg. The mouth was comically small, and the voice that came from
it was modest out of all proportion to the great body. He swept
like a whirlwind up the glade, one hand pawing the air, screaming
like a jay. In every line of him was excitement, an excitement
na&iuml;ve and childish, but in his very abandonment there was a
careless power.</p>

<p>Peter's eyes narrowed as he watched the broad back above the
flat rump of the Fleming lessen in the distance, till the men
behind blocked the view. He had seen his King--his rival--his
quarry. Many a picture had he formed of Henry, but none like
this. He had looked for gross appetites, cruel jaws, lowering
brows, eyes hot with the lust of power. In all his portraits the
man had been elderly. But what he had now seen was more like an
overgrown boy. There was a preposterous youthfulness in this
ageing creature, whinnying like a puppy with the ardour of the
game; there was something mirthful in his great, glowing, fleshy
face. . . . There was more. One who, with his kingdom afire in
the east and north and smouldering in the west, could fling his
whole heart like a child into his play, had greatness in him.
There was about him an insolent security. What he desired,
whether it were deer or gold or kingdoms, he desired so fiercely
that he was likely to get it. Peter felt as if some effluence of
power had struck him, like a wind in his face.</p>

<p>"What think you of his grace?" Darking asked, as they stole
back towards Evenlode.</p>

<p>"I think that he will not easily go down, and that if he falls
much will fall with him."</p>

<p>Darking looked up into the sky.</p>

<p>"The wind freshens, and it has moved back to the south-east--a
good wind for the forest. To-morrow belike the King will hunt in
Wychwood, and kill a yeld hind. There is a great she-devil
harbouring in Finstock brake."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Darking's forecast was true. Next morning saw a dawn of lemon
and gold, and a sharper tang in the air, while, instead of the
spring zephyr which had blown for two days, there was a small,
bitter easterly breeze. Peter was abroad at the first light,
placing his men. If the King crossed Evenlode and entered the
forest it would be by the bridge of Charlbury, for the best
harbourage for deer lay to the west of Leafield in the thick
coverts above Shipton. He would have an escort, since he was
outside the Woodstock pales, but it was certain that, if a strong
quarry were unharboured, he would soon leave that escort behind
him. With the wind in its present quarter, the deer would run
towards Ramsden and Whiteoak Green, where the ground was broken
and the vistas short. There, at strategic points, his men would
lie hidden, while in the undergrowth would lurk some of Naps's
scouts to pass the word to the posts. Peter and Darking had
planned every detail like the ordering of a battle, and had their
alternatives in case any item miscarried. "Send the wind holds,"
said Darking. "The King will not stay abed to-day, and if the
slow-hounds are once out in Shipton Barren, his grace in an
hour's time will be among the Ramsden oaks."</p>

<p>The King was late. Word came by a lad of Flatsole's, who had
swum Evenlode and stood dripping like a water-rat, that he was on
the road for Charlbury, with five huntsmen and two companion
lords, and a score of men-at-arms mounted on beasts that would
soon founder in the heavy bracken of the forest. But it was noon
before Naps sent a message that the cavalcade was passing the
Charlbury causeway. Peter, on an Avelard bay, whose strain of
Welsh blood made him light and sure-footed as a mountain goat,
rode west on the high ground to prospect, while Darking kept ward
in the eastern forest.</p>

<p>From the Leafield crest he looked down on Shipton Barren, and
soon his keen eyes detected the whereabouts of the hunt. The King
was an epicure that day, for no chance beast was to his liking.
Peter saw deer break cover unregarded, and once the hounds were
flogged off a trail on which they had entered. By and by the
horns sounded a rally, and there came the wild notes which meant
that the chase had begun. Peter swung his horse round, ready to
follow east at a higher level, for it was certain that any deer
would at first keep to the riverside ground.</p>

<p>But to his amazement the hunt went otherwise. He got a glimpse
of the first hounds with a verderer riding furiously on their
flanks, and then, well behind them, a knot of men. They were
going westward, upstream--westward or south-westward, for, as he
looked, he saw them swing towards Fulbrook Gap. . . . Then he saw
the reason. The wind had changed, the sting had gone out of it,
and it had moved to west of south, and was now blowing softly
down Windrush.</p>

<p>He watched in deep perplexity the hunt wheel towards the high
ridges, where the forest opened up into downs, and rose to the
Hallows Hill. Beyond that the trees began again, the deep
woodland country above Barrington. A yeld hind would need to be
the stoutest of her breed to make those distant coverts. More
likely she would soon be pulled down in the open, and then the
huntsmen would return to draw another of the Wychwood harbours. .
. . There was that famous beast in Finstock brake.</p>

<p>Naps's men were fewer at this end, but he found a prigger lad
cutting himself a switch from a hazel. Him he sent back hot-foot
to Darking to report what had happened. It was now afternoon, and
there were but two hours left of daylight. If the King was
benighted, and he could get up his men in time, all might yet be
well.</p>

<p>Peter set spurs to his horse, and galloped for the Taynton
wolds. The land lay spread out like a map beneath him, pale as
the country of a dream, with far down on his left the smoke of
Burford town making a haze in the hollow. . . . Soon he had come
to a point which gave him a long view. That yeld hind must be a
marvel, for she was still going strongly, having puzzled the
hounds in the Fulbrook coppice. She was not bound for Hallows
Hill, but had turned downward to where the Windrush floods
drowsed in the valley. That would mean the end of her. She would
never face the water, and if she kept down the left bank she
could be brought to bay among the Burford garths. Could she but
cross the stream, then indeed she might find sanctuary in the
dense thickets above the little valley of Leach.</p>

<p>He had lost sight of the hunters, but presently the hounds
came into view, running strongly at gaze. The hind was making for
Windrush. Peter was now on a tiny promontory, and had the valley
clear beneath him. The river at this point was less of a barrier,
for the floods were dammed by fallen timber at Barrington. It
might be passed. . . .</p>

<p>It was passed. He saw the head of the swimming deer, and then
after an interval the dark beads which meant the hounds. Where
were the huntsmen? The hounds had outrun them, and they were now
stranded on the Taynton downs. He heard far off the thin but
furious notes of the horn. They would return the way they came,
and they had far to go, and the dusk would presently fall. The
fates were kind to him, if only Darking moved his men west in
time.</p>

<p>He had turned his horse to gallop back the road he had come,
when over his shoulder he took one last look at the Windrush
vale. What he saw made his heart stop. . . . The deer and the
hounds were now beyond the river, but all the hunters had not
been left behind. One was still following. He was even now
crossing, his horse swimming strongly. The light was too dim to
see clear, but some instinct gave him certainty. That man was the
King.</p>

<p>Peter went down the hill like one possessed. He had no plan or
purpose except to keep touch with this lone horseman. There was a
furious ardour in him, and awe too. It seemed that the stage was
being set otherwise than he had expected, set for a meeting such
as he had not dreamed of. Somewhere in that dim land beyond the
waters the two of them were destined to come face to face.</p>

<p>He crossed Windrush without trouble, for the dam at Barrington
had so shrunken the floods that the stream was little more than
its turbid winter flow. But once on the far bank he was at a
loss. The light was growing bad, and there was no sign of hounds
or hunter. They had not pulled down the quarry, for in that still
air he would have heard the savage rumour of the kill. . . . He
looked behind him. Dusk had crept down the Taynton slopes, and
there was no sign there of following hunters. Even the angry
horns had ceased to sound.</p>

<p>He rode a little way up-hill into the coverts, and then
halted. Presently the King would find himself benighted, and
would give up the chase. He had hunted in Wychwood often, and
must know something of the lie of the land. He would make his way
downstream, and cross at the Burford bridge, which was intact.
Again Peter clapped spurs to his horse. He must watch the
southern approaches to the crossing, from Westwell, and by the
track from Lechlade.</p>

<p>He took his stand on a piece of high ground, from which he
could see in the dusk a light or two beginning to twinkle in the
Burford hollow. . . . But he did not wait long, for far on his
right he seemed to hear the baying of hounds. They were still
hunting, and his ear told him that they were running east by
Shilton. The King would still be following, for rumour said that
he never left the chase so long as there was hope of a kill. . .
. Again, he spurred his horse. In half an hour at the most the
dark would have fallen thick. Then the King would give up. He
would cross Windrush at Minster Lovell, and take the quickest
road to Woodstock. If the Burford bridge still stood, so would
that of Minster Lovell, which was sound Roman work. . . .</p>

<p>In an agony of uncertainty he resolved that the only chance
was to risk all on the likeliest happening. His horse was still
fresh, and he covered the four miles of ground in little time. .
. . The bridge was whole. The shell of Lovell's castle rose black
among the trees, and Windrush lay eerie and dim in its wide
lagoon. He noted that the isle in the lagoon, which held one of
the castle dovecots, was but little diminished in size. The dam
at Barrington was doing its work well.</p>

<p>He dismounted, and tied up his horse to a stump on the slopes
of the south bank. If Henry came this way, he would let him cross
the bridge, and then follow him up the Leafield road, where his
own men were as thick as owls in the night. God had wrought a
miracle for him, for his enemy was being guided relentlessly into
his net. Peter set his teeth hard to curb his impatience. If he
only came! . . . But he must come, unless he wanted to lie wet
and cold in the Shilton woods.</p>

<p>Come he did. A weary horse, lame in the off foreleg, stumbled
down the track. On it sat a bulky man, who leaned back to ease
his beast in the descent, and whose great hunting boots stuck out
from its sides like the yards of a ship. The man had lost his
bonnet, and even in the dark Peter could recognise the round
head, baldish at the top, the vast square face and the bull
shoulders. It was beyond question the King.</p>

<p>Had he been less intent on the sight he would not have missed
a sound like a grumbling thunderstorm which seemed to fill the
valley and grew every moment in volume. The horse heard it, for
it jibbed at the entrance to the bridge. The place was
high-backed and narrow over which two men could not ride abreast,
and which the wool-staplers' pack animals could not cross. . . .
The rider dug deep with his spurs, but the horse again refused.
Then with a groan of weariness he rolled out of the saddle and
attempted to lead it.</p>

<p>Still it refused. He was in front of it and dragging it by the
bridle--he stood on the keystone, while the beast was still
plunging on the bank. . . . Then came a sound which broke in even
on Peter's preoccupation. It was like a gale in a high wood, or a
mighty snowslip on a mountain, with a rumbling undercurrent of
thunder. Something huge and dark reared itself high above the
stone arch, and the next second Peter was struggling in the side
eddies of a monstrous wave.</p>

<p>He had been able to swim like a moorhen from childhood, and he
had no trouble in shaking off the clutch of the stream. As he
dashed the water from his eyes he knew what had happened. The dam
at Barrington had burst, and Windrush, half a mile wide, was
driving a furrow through the land--Windrush no more a lagoon but
a rending ploughshare.</p>

<p>The King! Was this God's way of working His purpose? Was that
mountain of royal flesh now drowning in the dark wastes of water?
The bridge had been swept clean--the very horse was gone--nay,
the bridge itself must have been broken, for only a swirl in the
dimness marked where a fragment of pier still stood, submerged
under three feet of flood. . . .</p>

<p>Peter strained his eyes into the gloom. The coming of the
water seemed to have lightened the darkness a little, for he
could see the black loom of Lovell's castle on the far shore,
and, downstream, the top of the island dovecot. . . . There was
no sound now except the steady lift and gurgle of the tide; the
crested wave with its thunder was now far away down the valley.
Only the even swish and swirl, with close at hand the murmur of
little sucking eddies.</p>

<p>And then in the stillness came a cry. It seemed to come from
the island, which was fifty yards below the bridge. . . . It
sounded again, a choked cry as from something in panic or pain.
Peter knew that it could come from one throat only--of him who
some minutes before had ridden down the hill. He had been plucked
from the bridge like a straw and borne down, and was now by some
miracle washed up like flotsam on the island shore. He was not
drowning, for no drowning man could have sent out so strong a
cry, but he must be in instant peril of death.</p>

<p>Peter was in the water before he knew, striking transversely
across the floods so as to make the island. He did not stop to
consider his purpose, for that oldest instinct was uppermost
which of itself quickens a man's limbs to save another's
life.</p>

<p>He swam strongly and cunningly, and forced his way to
midstream. Then he let himself drift and listened. Again came the
cry--now very near, and it was a cry of desperation. The man was
clinging to something which he could not hold. . . . Peter's long
arms in an overhand stroke devoured the waters, and his speed was
thrice the speed of the stream. . . . Again a cry, but this time
with a choke in it. Peter butted into a tangle of driftwood among
the island rushes. Where in God's name was the King?</p>

<p>Clearly he had lost his hold. Peter stood up in the shallows
and shouted. Was that an answer from the dark eddy now sweeping
towards the northern bank of Windrush? There seemed to be a sound
there which was not the stream. Again he launched himself on the
flood, and as his breast caught the current he heard again a cry.
This time it was the strangled gasp of a drowning man.</p>

<p>In ten strokes he had overtaken him. The man could only swim
feebly, and every second he dipped under the rough tide. A very
little longer and he would dip for ever.</p>

<p>Peter raised his head and shouted lustily. The man heard him,
for he made several feeble, hurried strokes. Then Peter was on
him, and his hand was under his chin.</p>

<p>"Get your breath," Peter spluttered, for he had swallowed much
water in making haste. "I will support you."</p>

<p>Then: "We must get out of the stream. Hold by my girdle and I
will tow you."</p>

<p>It was a harder business than the crossing of Evenlode the
morning before. Happily the main weight of the flood was on the
other side of the island, and the stream between the island and
the castle ran with less power. But the man was as weighty as a
tree-trunk, and his clutch on Peter's belt was like shackles of
lead. The muscles of shoulder and thigh were cracking, before the
deadly plucking of the current eased off and they came into slack
water. Then the other, who had manfully striven to obey his
rescuer's orders, promptly let go and sank. Peter clutched him by
some part of his garments and waded ashore.</p>

<p>He pulled the water-logged body through the selvedge of drift
to what had been the quay of the castle. The man was in a swoon,
but as Peter rolled him over his senses returned, and he was very
sick.</p>

<p>Presently he sat up, coughing.</p>

<p>"God's name!" he gasped, "that was a rough journey. I am
beholden to you, friend, whoever you be. You will not be the
worse for this night's work. I am woundily cold and empty, save
for flood water. Likewise my wits are somewhat dazed, and I know
not where I have been washen up. Get me to bed and supper, and I
will repay you well."</p>

<p>The man, bone-weary, dripping and chilled to the marrow, still
kept a kind of dignity. He tried to rise, and sat down again with
a groan.</p>

<p>"A murrain on my leg," he moaned. "'Twas already sore with the
day's work, and now it has failed me utterly. I cannot put foot
to ground, and my horse is drowned long ago. Can you find a way
to move me, sirrah, for if I bide here I will freeze and
starve?"</p>

<p>Then Peter spoke.</p>

<p>"Your grace must make the best of it. This is the ruin of
Minster Lovell, and there will be no leaving it before the
morrow. Supper I cannot give you, but I can find you a rough
lodging. Kings have slept before in these towers."</p>

<p>"You know me?" came the sharp question.</p>

<p>"I recognise the King's grace," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Majesty, man, majesty," came the correction. "That is the new
word I have commended."</p>

<p>"The King's majesty," Peter assented.</p>

<p>"I have often slept hard and supped bare. Had I but a dry
shirt and a cushion for my cursed leg I would be content. But
tell me, sir, does aught inhabit that shell? I had heard that it
had been long tenantless."</p>

<p>"Nought but owls and bats and the twittering ghosts of old
Lovells."</p>

<p>The other shivered.</p>

<p>"Like enough. What then can Lovell's castle offer me?"</p>

<p>"A shelter for your head. With luck I may also get you fire
and food and dry raiment. But you must be guided by me, since I
have plucked you from the water."</p>

<p>"I know not who you be, but you seem a good Christian. Give me
your shoulder, lad, and I will make shift to hobble."</p>

<p>Leaving a trail of puddles behind them, they made their way
through the blocked postern, called the Water-gate, into the west
court, which, since there was no moon, was a trough of ink. They
groped among the broken flags to the northern corner under the
dovecot, where was the shaft which led to Lovell's prison.</p>

<p>Suddenly almost under their feet a spark of light flew up,
followed by the crackling of twigs. In the glow Peter saw the
bent back and elf locks of Madge of Shipton.</p>

<p>"What do you here, mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>She peered at him.</p>

<p>"Your errands, my lord. Since you will not seek your treasure
yourself your well-wishers must seek for you. I was casting the
runes of the burning ash-cross, for this was in old days a holy
e'en."</p>

<p>Peter's intention had been to leave Henry and to borrow from
Mother Sweetbread on the hill above the means of supper and bed.
Now fate had sent him a helper.</p>

<p>"You will first do me a different service, mother," he said.
"Go to Gammer Sweetbread, and bid her bring clothing and food for
two starving men. You and she can bear it down the hill. We will
await you here by your fire. Bring a lantern, too, and a tinder
box."</p>

<p>The old woman rose to her feet. "You are white, my lord, and
there are strange things writ in your face. I do your errand, for
you are like two kelpies from the river, and will have ague in
your bones in another hour."</p>

<p>There was a small heap of kindlings, with which Peter fed the
fire.</p>

<p>"Get yourself warm, sire," he said, "and presently you will be
better served."</p>

<p>Henry hunched himself close to the blaze.</p>

<p>"She called you lord," he said. "Who may you be, lad?"</p>

<p>"'Twas an idle word," said Peter; "my name is not worthy of
your grace's hearing. I am a common man out of the forest."</p>

<p>"You are uncommon strong. Not ten men in this nation could
have dragged my bulk from that stream. Ugh, the majesty of
England came near to being food for eels! A cold ending at which
my belly turns. You have put Harry of England deep in your debt,
young sir."</p>

<p>The man was clearly in deep discomfort. Seen in the firelight
his face was mottled and streaked, a strong shuddering would take
him, and he moved his leg continually as if in pain. Yet there
was a rude fortitude in his air. His small, sharp, watchful eyes
showed a spirit that would not bow to weariness.</p>

<p>He toasted his steaming body, and for an hour he only spoke
twice.</p>

<p>"I have fifty lackeys within two miles," he groaned, "and not
one lubber at hand. That is God's jest with royalty."</p>

<p>The second time he said, "I may ride a bushel or two lighter
for this. They say cold water lessens weight!" And the strange
man laughed.</p>

<p>By and by the two women came out of the darkness, with a
bobbing lantern. They had brought blankets, and two deerskin
cloaks lined with fustian, and a basket of broken meats. There
was a flagon, too, of Mother Sweetbread's sloeberry cordial. They
looked curiously at the great figure crouched by the fire as they
laid down their burdens, and Peter followed them back into the
shadows.</p>

<p>Madge of Shipton plucked at his arm.</p>

<p>"The half-drowned one will bring you fortune," she whispered.
"I read it in your pale face and the sign on your brow when you
wrinkled it. But beware--beware! The burnt cross of ash has
called spirits out of the deeps, and there is a strife among the
Powers. All night on your behalf I will say the paternoster of
the Brethren." The clutch of her fingers on his arm was like the
clutch of an eyas on the falconer's fist.</p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread said: "You will get the ague, son Peter.
Come back with me, and I will bed you both, and roast the fever
from your veins."</p>

<p>Peter put an arm round the old woman's neck. "I will get no
ague, mother of mine. But hearken to me, for a kingdom hangs on
it. Get a message to Darking, who is somewhere in the Ramsden
bracken. The forest is full of Naps's folk, and any one of them
will carry the word. Say to Darking that I am in Lovell's castle
with him he wots of, and that my men must meet me here an hour
before dawn. Say, too, that there is no bridge left on Windrush,
and that we must home by the road we came."</p>

<p>The woman nodded.</p>

<p>"Your message will be carried, my son, though I should have to
bunch my skirts and stir my own old bones. Solomon shall have it
ere midnight."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The King grumbled.</p>

<p>"I am no fox to kennel in a hole. Whence came those women?
Have they no dwelling near where I may bed me?"</p>

<p>"A mile and more of rough ground distant. And miserable cabins
at that, with a plague of rats and the stars shining through the
thatch. You will be better in Lovell's cell."</p>

<p>"Let me lie by the fire."</p>

<p>"It is already dying and there is no more fuel. There will be
frost ere morning and you will get a chill at the heart."</p>

<p>"But I will stick in that hole, and you who have dragged me
from water may have no power to drag me from earth."</p>

<p>"The place is wide enough. Two months back I made the passage
with a brother of Oseney."</p>

<p>"A holy man has entered it! That gives a flavour of grace to
as graceless a spot as ever my eyes beheld. It looks like some
werewolf's lair. . . . But lead on, sir. Maybe you are right, and
I shall be warmer if I have some yards of stone and earth for
blanket."</p>

<p>Peter led the way down the slimy steps and over the prostrate
outer door. The first part of the passage was narrow, and in
bending the King had some trouble with his leg. When he jarred it
on a knuckle of stone he would bellow with pain, and Peter,
turning the lantern, saw the great face flushed and furious. Then
the roof rose, and Peter's arm could give him support. At the
subsidence it was hard to get the King through, and Peter had to
clear away much rubble. Then came the sound of falling water.</p>

<p>"Have we escaped one flood to drown in another?" the King
asked tartly.</p>

<p>The corridor broadened, and at last came the iron-bound door.
It had been left unlocked on the last visit, and a pull set it
creaking on its hinges. The little chamber smelt dry and fresh,
and it had the chill neither of the water-logged outer air nor of
the mildewed passage.</p>

<p>Peter set the lantern on the floor and dropped his burden.</p>

<p>"Behold your majesty's lodging for the night," he said, while
Henry sat himself heavily in the chair which had once been
Lovell's.</p>

<p>Peter flung the rotting bedclothes from the pallet, and laid
on it Mother Sweetbread's blankets. He helped the King to strip
off his soaked doublet and hose--a task of delicacy owing to the
ulcer on his leg, and wrapped his great body in one of the
deerskin cloaks.</p>

<p>"Get you among the blankets, sire," he said, "and I will serve
your supper."</p>

<p>He fed him with Mother Sweetbread's provender, and he gave him
to drink of Mother Sweetbread's sloeberry cordial. The King made
an ample meal and the strong liquor warmed his blood. "Ha!" he
cried, "I begin to thaw, and the ice has gone from my belly. This
is a rough inn, but the entertainment might be worse. Give me
another cup, and I will compose myself to sleep. What mountain is
above me?"</p>

<p>"Lovell's castle," said Peter. "The abode of the last lord of
that house."</p>

<p>The King cried out and crossed himself.</p>

<p>"It has an ill name," he murmured. "You say you came here with
a brother of Oseney? Did the holy man lustrate this chamber, for
wherever Lovell trod Sathanas walked in his tracks?"</p>

<p>"Set your mind at ease, sire. It was lustrated by prayer and
tears, and the bones of Lovell were laid in hallowed earth."</p>

<p>But the King was not at ease. Some notion had arisen to vex
him. He watched Peter strip off his clothes, wrap himself in the
other cloak and make a bed beside the door.</p>

<p>"Oseney," he muttered, "what have I heard of a brother of
Oseney?" and he raised himself on his elbow, and stared at his
companion.</p>

<p>Peter, ever since he had dragged the King ashore, had had a
mind empty of thought. He saw the clear hand of God, and let
himself follow blindly as it guided. . . . There could be no
failure now, for events had turned miraculously in his favour.
Before dawn Darking and his men would be at Minster Lovell, and
by noon the King would be safe at Avelard. The household at
Woodstock would be hunting high and low for its lord and master,
but here in this dungeon of Lovell's he was hidden more securely
than if he were in the heart of Wales with all Neville's pickets
to guard him. . . . He had not troubled to think of Henry. The
man with his gross body and his ulcerated leg was no more to him
than a derelict log plucked from the water.</p>

<p>"Compose yourself to sleep, sire," he said; "on the morrow I
can promise you better fare and a softer bed."</p>

<p>He was himself very weary, but before he lay down he raised
the lantern to see to the candle within. Then he set it and the
tinder-box on the floor beside him, blew out the light, and
turned to sleep.</p>

<p>But in the moment when his face had been clear in the
lantern's glow, Henry had seen in it something which made his
cheek, now ruddy with the cordial, grow mottled and pale again.
"By God, it is he," he whispered. "The Oseney clerk! He is
Buckingham's get, for he has the Bohun lip. . . ." There was no
drowsiness now for the King.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peter slept lightly, as was his custom, for one trained in the
Oseney services, which broke the night into short stages, was not
likely to be a sluggard. He was awakened to sudden consciousness
by the sound of a creaking pallet. The King was restless; nay,
the King was rising.</p>

<p>He lay and listened. He heard Henry fumbling among his
discarded clothes, and the clink of something hard--metal or
stone. Then he heard the stealthy movements of the heavy body,
which seemed to be coming towards him. He had that consciousness
of imminence which comes neither from touch, nor sight, nor
hearing, but from some subtler sense. He slipped from under his
blanket, and rolled very softly a few feet to his left.</p>

<p>The King was approaching the bed. He was close on it, leaning
above it. . . . And then there was a rapid movement, the sound of
an arm descending, a sudden jar of metal driven through woollen
on to stone.</p>

<p>Peter's brain worked fast. The King had recognised him, had
hoped to rid himself of a rival by the speediest way. Had he been
sleeping heavily where he had laid himself down, the King's
hunting-knife would now be in his heart.</p>

<p>Wrath plucked him to his feet and hurled him on his enemy. He
felt the kneeling King topple over under his impact, and found
himself grappling with something as soft and unresisting as a
bolster. He wrested the knife from his grasp and sent it spinning
into a corner. His hands found the thick throat, but there was no
need to choke it, for the man was without strength. . . . Instead
he felt along the floor for the tinder-box and relit the
lantern.</p>

<p>The King sprawled on his side, almost black in the face, his
lips contorted with pain, while one hand groped at his leg. Peter
dragged him back to his pallet, and set the lantern on the chair.
In the struggle the deerskin had half fallen from Henry, and
revealed his misshapen limbs and huge paunch and unwholesome
elderly flesh. Peter looked down on him with a shiver of disgust.
Then he filled a cup of cordial and put it to his lips, which
greedily drained it. The King lay panting for a little while,
while the darkness passed from his face, leaving it mottled and
pale again. The pain in his leg seemed to have gone, for he
opened his eyes, and they were bright and wary with fear.</p>

<p>"That was a foolish enterprise, sire," said Peter. "We two are
alone here in this cell. One is old and one is young, one is sick
and one is hale. If two such contend there can be but the one
issue. . . . He whom you would have slain has a few hours back
saved you from death. . . . I would remind you likewise that
murder is a deed on which Heaven frowns."</p>

<p>The King had recovered his bodily ease, and with it his wits.
He lay with the blanket drawn up to his chin, and his little eyes
as sharp as a bird's. There was still panic in them, but also
cunning.</p>

<p><i>"Peccavi,"</i> he said. "'Twas a sudden tempting of the
Devil. May God and His saints have mercy on me! I ask your
forgiveness, young sir--I, the King of England, abase myself
before you."</p>

<p>"You would have slain me. Why?"</p>

<p>"A sudden madness. I feared you. . . . I took you for one who
was plotting my hurt."</p>

<p>"Whom do I favour? I, a nameless man of the forest! What enemy
of your majesty's have I the ill fortune to recall?"</p>

<p>"None that lives," said the King, "but one that died long
ago."</p>

<p>"Even so. It seems I bear on my face the proof of my
begetting. Your majesty is right. I am the son of Edward of
Buckingham."</p>

<p>The King's face did not change, but his lips moved.</p>

<p>"You have come into the west to seek me. I, too, sought you,
and God has prepared a meeting. I deserve some favour at your
majesty's hands for this night's work. First, I saved you from
the floods, and second, when your majesty would have knifed me, I
forbore to strike back."</p>

<p>There was a new light in Henry's eyes. His panic was now under
command, and he was back in a world which he understood.</p>

<p>"You talk reason, my lord. I bear no ill will to your house--I
have ever admitted its splendour. Your father stood in my way,
and I had to thrust him aside, but I have no malice towards his
son. You speak truth--I am most deeply beholden to you for what
has befallen this night. . . . I will make you the second man in
the kingdom. The lands and dukedom of Buckingham shall be yours
again, and you shall ride by the King's bridle and sit high in
his Council."</p>

<p>Henry's eye was alert and watchful, but his smile was that
grave and kindly smile that had often beguiled men's hearts.</p>

<p>Peter lifted his hand.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you of this cell where we now lie," he said.
"Hither after Stoke battle came one who had been the second man
in the kingdom, who had ridden by the King's bridle, and had sat
high in his Council. He was a fugitive, but in this place he was
safe. Here he could lie till the hunt had passed, and he could
get himself and his wealth abroad. But only one other knew the
secret of the place, and that other fell sick and died. So the
great lord Lovell was left to starve like a rat whose hole had
been stopped. Two months back I entered this place, and stumbled
over his bones. I came seeking treasure and I found it."</p>

<p>The King pulled the blanket from his chin. "'Fore God, I knew
it," he said. "'Twas not Neville nor Avelard that paid for this
mischief in the west. . . ."</p>

<p>"You mistake me. I said I found treasure, but it was not
Lovell's gold. I found the philosopher's stone, the touch of
which dissolves earth's ambitions. I no longer seek what Lovell
sought."</p>

<p>The King sat up, and as he moved his leg he squealed with
pain.</p>

<p>"That is an honest thought," he cried. "You would go back to
Holy Church? I commend you, my lord. I will rejoice to further
your purpose. You may have the choice of any abbey in this land.
Nay, you will be bishop as soon as I can make room for you. I . .
."</p>

<p>"Your majesty misreads me. I will never be clerk again. But I
will not rest till there is a new England, for I am a fighter on
God's side. I would save my soul."</p>

<p>"By the rood so would I!" The King's face had a serious
bewilderment. "I am the devoutest man that ever wore ermine. If I
have broken with the Pope, I will defend the faith better than
he. No heretic shall breathe freely in this land while I sit on
the throne. I have confuted in argument Luterano and Sacramentary
alike. My chief study in my closet is holy learning. Every day I
serve the priest at mass, every Sunday I receive the holy bread,
every Good Friday I creep on my knees to the Cross."</p>

<p>There was a strong passion in the King's voice. This man, who
a little before had been a murderer in intent, believed devoutly
that he was on the side of virtue.</p>

<p>"You would serve God by putting yourself in God's place?"
Peter said quietly.</p>

<p>The King looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I am God's vicegerent on earth," he said, "therefore I sit in
God's place. But the creature abaseth itself before the
Creator."</p>

<p>"Is it God's purpose that you burn honest folk for a little
deviation of faith, and likewise send to death those who hold in
trust God's estates because they will not surrender them to your
minions?"</p>

<p>The King's face lit up. Here was ground with which he was
familiar.</p>

<p><i>"Distinguo,"</i> he cried. "No man suffers under me save
for denying the catholic faith in which is alone found salvation.
You are a strange clerk if you contemn that duty. I am the
guardian under God of my people's hopes of Heaven. I am
determined to make this realm one in faith as it is one in law.
If I have shouldered his Holiness of Rome from the headship of
Christ's Church in England, the more need that I perform the task
in which his Holiness was somewhat negligent. Listen, my lord.
Law is above all men, king and peasant alike. Of that law there
are two branches, the law of God and the law of England, and both
are in my care. The first is based upon God's Word and that
inherited practice of God's Church which, being inspired by the
Holy Ghost, is likewise canonical. I would make the Scriptures
free to all in the vulgar tongue--you may have heard of my
efforts thereto--but I would not permit ignorant men to interpret
them as they please. The interpretation is laid down by Holy
Church, and he who rebels against it will burn, be he bishop or
noble, clerk or cotter."</p>

<p>There was no fear now in the small bright eyes. Henry spoke
with a fierce authority, and his broad low brow had set in
weighty lines.</p>

<p>"As to the second law, the law of England, I am its most
devout and humble servant. I have never acted save in obedience
to that law. 'Twas that law that shook off the Pope's burden.
'Tis under that law that I have taken order with certain
religious houses. I have made it my care that the blessing of law
shall be free to all, the poorest as well as the greatest, and
that all shall stand equal before the royal tribunals. That law
is not my private will, but the approved judgment of the wisest
men. Maybe I have guided it into new channels, but the flow is
that which came down through six centuries. I have sworn before
God, that if any man, be he never so great, outrage that law I
will make his head fly for it, and by God's help I will keep that
vow so long as there is breath in my nostrils."</p>

<p>"Yet you have made an England," said Peter, "which is in some
sort a stye and in some sort a desert."</p>

<p>"In what respect, sir?" the King asked sharply. "I have given
it peace."</p>

<p>"That peace which is a desert," was the answer. "Your loans
and benevolences have bled it white. There is as much suffering
as in the days of the Black Death. The rich grow richer, and the
poor die by thousands in the ditches."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the King. "No doubt there is much misery abroad.
But mark you, young sir, 'tis a shallow philosophy which judges
on what exists but takes no account of what has been prevented. .
. . I have had to steer a difficult course among the plots of the
Emperor and the French King. Had I steered less skilfully a new
Duke William might have landed on English earth. To defeat my
enemies cost money, and that my people have cheerfully paid, for
they knew it was for them that I fought. . . . For the rest, I
say again that I have given them peace. But for my strong hand
the nobles would have been at each other's throats, and at mine,
as in the old Wars of the Roses. I have shed blood, doubtless,
but, had I been weak, every drop of that blood would have been a
river. <i>Quicquid delirant reges,</i> says the poet,
<i>plectuntur Achivi.</i> By curbing the madness of the kings I
have saved the commons from stripes. Think you that is a small
thing? By God, I am the man in all England best loved by the
commonalty."</p>

<p>"I read it otherwise. What know you of the true commonalty of
England? Your counsellors are the new men who have risen to power
by the oppression of the poor."</p>

<p>To Peter's surprise the King assented.</p>

<p>"I do not altogether deny that. Hark you, my lord. These be
strange and perilous times in which we live. Men's minds
everywhere and in all things are in a confusion. Europe is a
whirlpool because of the ambition of kings and the unsettlement
of the Church. Here in England is the same strife in lesser
degree. Not in things religious only, but in the things of
Mammon, for it would appear that a new world is coming to birth.
It is a hard world for many, a kind world to a few, but it needs
must come as spring must follow winter. Everywhere in the land
men are following new trades, and old customs are passing away.
We grow rich, and in growing rich we doubtless grow hard, but
that hardness is needful in the narrow portals of a new world.
Had I been a slack-mouthed king, this England of mine would have
been booty to the proud. Had I summoned to my councils only the
ancient nobles, a promising growth would have been nipped in the
bud. In a time of unsettlement one thing is needful above all
others, and that is a strong hand and an iron law. That law I
will give to England, though every shire be in flames against
me!"</p>

<p>The man was great. It was borne in on Peter that this vast
being, wallowing among Mother Sweetbread's homespun blankets, had
the greatness of some elemental force. He hated him, for he saw
the cunning behind the frank smile, the ruthlessness in the small
eyes; but he could not blind himself to his power. Power of
Mammon, power of Antichrist, power of the Devil, maybe, but
something born to work mightily in the world.</p>

<p>The King was speaking again.</p>

<p>"I will have no treason in this land," he said, "for it is
treason not against my person--which matters less--but against
the realm of England. In Europe there is C&aelig;sar who has
empire over men's bodies, and the Pope who has empire over men's
souls. I have sworn that I too shall be imperial, and England an
empire. No foreign C&aelig;sar or foreign Pope will issue edicts
over this English soil. There will be one rule within these
isles, not of Henry or Henry's son, but of English law. The
Church will acknowledge its headship. Even now I am bringing my
turbulent kinsmen of Wales inside its pale. There is not a noble
but will be made to bow his stiff neck to it. Before I die I hope
with God's help to make Scotland my vassal, so that the writ of
England shall run from Thule and the Ebudes to the Narrow Seas.
Only thus shall my people have peace, and as a peacemaker I shall
be called the child of God."</p>

<p>"It will be a peace without God. You may preserve men's
bodies, but you will damn their souls."</p>

<p>"Not so. In time the new wealth which this land is getting
will spread itself so that the poor will benefit. Some day there
will be an England prosperous and content, and what better soil
for the flourishing of true religion and sound learning?"</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>"There may be nobleness in your dreams, but in the meantime
you are burdening your soul with evil deeds. Can piety and
graciousness spring from what is evil? You are imperilling your
salvation in a proud venture."</p>

<p>The King laughed--a low rumbling laugh, with mirth in it.</p>

<p>"I am willing to run the hazard. Listen, my lord. There is an
old tale of a mighty Emperor who died and came to Peter's Gate.
The devil's advocate had much to say against him--sackings and
burnings and politic lies and politic slayings. 'But,' said the
Emperor, 'I have had a hard task, fighting all my days with
desperate men to put a little decency and order into my world. It
is not fair to judge me by the canons of the cloister.' And the
Lord God, who knows how difficult is the labour of government,
admitted the plea, and the Emperor passed into Paradise. I am
content to leave my own judging to the same wise God."</p>

<p>"You walk in Lovell's path," said Peter. "Would you had been
with me when I first came to this place, and had seen the end of
Lovell's glory."</p>

<p>"Tush, man, I have made account of that. All earthly splendour
ends in rottenness. This body of mine is half-rotten already. But
the flaming spirit of man outlasts his dust, and till God send
for me I will rule England."</p>

<p>He yawned.</p>

<p>"I am weary and would sleep, for my leg is now at peace. Take
you that knife into your bed, if it comfort you. . . . You are an
honest lad, but you are a monk in bone. Return to Oseney and I
will make you its abbot."</p>

<h1><a name="c15">CHAPTER XV</a></h1>

<h1>HOW THE SWAN OF BOHUN WENT DOWN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The prigger lad whom Peter found above Shipton Barren duly
carried the message to Darking, and about the time when the
former was crossing Windrush his men had drawn by secret ways
towards the Fulbrook gap. Some of Naps's scouts were in the river
bottom, and presently to Darking, hidden on the heights, they
brought strange reports. A hind had crossed the stream with the
hounds in full cry after her, and one man after the hounds.
Darking guessed that this man might be the King, but he sought
confirmation. It came with the first hour of twilight, when the
royal escort, guided by the verderers, arrived in hot haste below
the Barrington dam. Their master had gone out of their ken, and
they had the task of finding him, knowing well that there would
be the devil to pay if, when the heat of the chase was over, he
found himself without attendants. They roamed the north bank of
Windrush like hounds at fault, and at last a party crossed by the
Burford bridge to explore the forest on the south shore.</p>

<p>Darking was in doubt about Peter till he got news from one of
Flatsole's people that he had been seen on the high ground
towards Westwell. This made his course clear: Peter was following
the hounds and the King. His order was for every man to cross,
but only half a dozen succeeded. For at that moment came the
bursting of the Barrington dam, which drowned two of the Avelard
troopers, and put an unfordable width of water between him and
the farther bank.</p>

<p>He had now a new problem. The King and Peter were, he
believed, somewhere in the thick woods that clothed the ridge
between Windrush and Thames. A dozen at the most of the King's
men had followed, and the remainder were aimlessly beating the
Taynton slopes. He learned that every bridge on Windrush had been
swept to the sea, and that the river could not be forded except
far up its valley towards Bourton. This seemed to make his task
simpler. The rest of the Woodstock men would doubtless aim at the
fords of the upper valley, but he and his folk would outpace
them. The dozen who had already crossed--Shrewsbury's
men-at-arms--would make slow going in a land of which they knew
nothing. The King was islanded for the better part of the night,
cut off in a wild place with Peter on his trail; he himself had
men with him who could move fast and sure in the dark; and behind
him were Naps's vagabonds, every man of them skilled like wild
things to thread the woods; it would be strange if before morning
he did not join hands with Peter and have the King safe. After
that a swift ride for Avelard with not one flooded stream to
compel a circuit. Things had befallen--or should befall--as if
the fates were their eager allies.</p>

<p>So the word was passed to ride west for the Bourton crossings.
This was an easy task for the men of High Cotswold, who were now
in familiar downland, where they found secrecy an easier matter
than in the tangled woods. . . . But the last twelve of them saw
something which brought them off their horses and huddled them in
the shelter of a coombe. A large mounted force came spurring from
Charlbury way. Word of the King's disappearance must have already
fluttered the Woodstock dovecots. "Soon," thought Darking, "they
will have the countryside roused and every squireling will be out
to succour majesty. By that time, if God will, majesty will be
looking down on Severn."</p>

<p>They found a crossing under Rissington, and about the time
when Mother Sweetbread was bearing food and clothing down the
hill, had come by way of Sherborne to the great heath which lined
the highway between Witney and Gloucester, the main road to the
west. They left it when they saw the Burford lights, and plunged
into the shaggy forest which lay between Shilton and the
Windrush, the landscape which five hours before they had looked
at from the other bank. It was very dark, but they had guides who
knew the ground like their wives' faces, and could see like wild
cats in the gloom.</p>

<p>It was a vain quest. Twice they ran into oddments of the
King's escort who had crossed before the bursting of the dam--men
lost utterly and wandering blind in the night. These they could
have easily made prisoner, but they let them stumble past
unharmed. No clue was to be got from such as to the King's
whereabouts. . . . The hounds must have long ceased to hunt, and
were probably now snuggled together in some dell. What would the
King do when the dark descended? Make for Windrush and Woodstock?
But the rise in the river would prevent his crossing, and what
would he do then? Maybe sleep cold in the bracken. Maybe ride for
Witney village. . . . One of Naps's lads was sent on to Witney to
inquire, and brought word that no man had come out of the forest
from the west since nightfall. . . . Slowly Darking came to the
conclusion that the King was now in Peter's charge. Somewhere the
two were together, and he and his men would find them at
daybreak. He wished that it could have been in the night, for he
had hoped to start for Avelard before dawn, since the daylight
would bring half the countryside seeking the King. . . . He took
up his headquarters on the track between Asthall and Brize
Norton, and sent out pickets who all night fruitlessly searched
the coverts. There was not a man of Darking's that night in the
original rendezvous in the Ramsden brakes, except a lame horseboy
who had been brought to cook for the Stanway troop.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mother Sweetbread bundled up her petticoats and bestirred her
old legs to some purpose. The vagabond folk, who for a week had
filled the forest around her cottage like woodcock in the first
frost, had now mysteriously gone. She tried all their familiar
haunts, she gave the beggars' call in her cracked old voice, but
there was no answer. Then on her own feet she set out for
Ramsden. The forest at that part lacked tall trees, and was
mostly scrub oak, thorn and holly, but there was a track she knew
of. She knew also, she thought, the very dingle where she would
find Darking.</p>

<p>But she found that she had presumed on her strength. It was
very dark and the lantern burned badly, so that she often tripped
over the roots of trees. A badger had made its earth on the
little-used path, and in it she wrenched her ankle. Long before
she was at the moorish tract which dipped to Ramsden brakes, her
legs and breath had begun to fail her. On the hilltop she sank on
the ground in despair. She could never herself reach Darking, and
the underworld of the forest, lately so populous, had become a
desert.</p>

<p>A man was coming up the track. She cowered into the dead
bracken and shuttered her light till he came close, and she saw
from his garments that he was a friar. A white friar, for, when
she lifted the lantern, his robe fluttered in its glare like the
wings of a moth. Her hope revived. Here was a holy man, and holy
men everywhere were on Peter's side.</p>

<p>The Carmelite was speaking to himself like one in a frenzy,
and it was not till she cried out that he halted and looked
towards her. His eyes blinked in the light like those of a great
bird, and she saw that they were hollow and wild.</p>

<p>"Father," she cried, "I ask your mercy. I have an errand to
do, and my strength fails me. Know you one Solomon Darking?"</p>

<p>"Who speaks that name?" he boomed. "Solomon Darking is busy on
God's tasks. Who would stay him by carnal errands?"</p>

<p>The old woman was comforted. Here was one who was privy to the
business.</p>

<p>"It is of these tasks I speak. I have a message to him from
him whom he calls master."</p>

<p>"Mean you the young lord whom God has sent to deliver His
people?"</p>

<p>"Even so. This night there is high work afoot, and he we know
of has a word which must be gotten straightway to Darking's ears.
Darking is somewhere in Ramsden brakes, but I cannot stir my feet
another yard. Have pity, father, and be my messenger."</p>

<p>The Carmelite mused.</p>

<p>"I have but now passed through Ramsden brakes," he said, "and
I saw no sign of man or horse. They were there four hours back,
two-score stalwart lads from my own nook of Cotswold, but now the
fires are cold ashes. Yet I will find Solomon Darking, though I
should have to borrow the wings of a bird. Speak on, sister. What
is the message?"</p>

<p>"He whom we wot of would have Darking know that he is now in
Lovell's castle, and with him is one whose name he did not speak,
but of whom Darking is well aware. Darking is bidden bring his
men to the place an hour before dawn. My lord said also that I
was to tell him that they must hence by the road they came, since
there was no bridge left on Windrush."</p>

<p>The Carmelite sunk his head on his breast and shut his eyes.
When he raised it these eyes were glowing.</p>

<p>"That is the great news, mother," he crooned; "Minster Lovell!
A fitting place for God's revenge upon evil! Who think you is he
that is with my lord? None other than Antichrist, the man of
blood. God has wonderfully guided His frail people. I have wept
and fasted and prayed against this day, and in my folly I
despaired, because I saw no great array, as I had dreamed,
trooping from the west. But God follows His own secret ways, and
those ways are not as ours. If we have gotten the Antichrist, we
have gotten what is better than Oxford town or London city."</p>

<p>With upraised hand he blessed the old woman, and then turned
and fluttered back the road he had come.</p>

<p>His zeal was his undoing. There was no one in Ramsden brakes
nor yet in Finstock. He tried to plan, but his sick and fevered
brain was incapable of thought. Instead he prayed, and it seemed
to him that God answered his prayer, and made him take the road
to Shipton. "The good Darking," he told himself, "will have gone
there to greet the further levies from the west."</p>

<p>Till long after midnight he wandered between Leafield and
Shipton Barren, running often in the exuberance of his purpose,
and leaving rags of his white clothing on the briers as sheep
leave tufts of wool on the downland thorns. But he found no
Darking, nor any of Darking's men. Sometimes he flung himself on
his knees and poured out a torrent of prayers; he waded through
marshes and scrambled among marl-pits, and always his lips were
working and he was communing with his mad heart.</p>

<p>An hour before dawn, as the skies in the east lightened, he
had a sudden assurance. "Presently I will find him," he said,
"for God tells me so." And he fell to crooning the message which
Mother Sweetbread had given him.</p>

<p>He was above the track from Charlbury to Burford, and he saw
men--a dozen and more--riding fast up from Evenlode. The
Carmelite was now at the very limit of his strength, but the
sight roused some wild remnant of power. He could not see
clearly, but he saw enough to know that these men did not wear
royal liveries, nor were they Shrewsbury's squat midlanders.
Beyond doubt they were Darking's folk--for that he had God's
assurance.</p>

<p>He ran down the slope and stayed the cavalcade with uplifted
hand. One who seemed to lead turned aside to him.</p>

<p>"I have a word for Solomon Darking," he cried.</p>

<p>"Ay. What word for Solomon?" asked the leader.</p>

<p>"He must go forthwith with all his men to Minster Lovell.
Haste you, for you should have been there even now. It is not an
hour till daybreak."</p>

<p>"And what is toward at Minster Lovell?" came the question.</p>

<p>"The young lord is there . . . and that other whom ye
seek."</p>

<p>The man turned to his followers.</p>

<p>"Fortune is with us," he cried. "This is the mad friar who has
come out of the west, and he is deep in rebellion. I do not know
what his ravings mean, but there is something at Minster Lovell
to be looked into. Forward, lads. Then turn to the left up the
hill by the old gallows."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Peter woke the King was still asleep. He could not be
certain of the time, for in that deep cell those tides of air
ceased to work which made a clock in his brain, but he believed
that it must be close on dawn. Mother Sweetbread could not have
failed him. Darking and his men would be without in the west
court, with the hoar frost on their bridles, beating their
breasts against the cold.</p>

<p>The King slept with his mouth open, his breath coming
stertorously from his great chest. What a man! He slept
carelessly beside one whom a few hours back he had tried to
murder, one whom he knew to be the leader of a plot against his
throne. There was the arrogance of greatness here. The man was a
king beyond doubt, for power was the one lust of his life. He was
the embodied new England, an England that had forsaken God. Peter
repeated the phrase like a password. It was a sedative to his
doubts. This man was against God, and God himself, not mortal
man, would overthrow him.</p>

<p>He almost pitied him. In a little he would be bumping westward
with a hundred stout fellows to guard him. And then, while he lay
tight at Avelard or maybe in some fortalice of Wales, the vast
delayed army would be mustering, hampered no longer by the
floods--mustering from north and west and south, to sweep east
upon leaderless forces and defenceless cities and courtiers that
lacked their master.</p>

<p>A grunt and a succession of volcanic sneezes told him that the
King was awake. He lit the lantern.</p>

<p>Henry was at his most vigorous in the morning. He rubbed his
eyes, propped himself on one arm, and called for a draught. Peter
gave him the last cup of Mother Sweetbread's cordial.</p>

<p>Recollection slowly flooded back on the King. He frowned and
narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p>"What is the order of the day, monk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I will escort you to breakfast and a more comfortable
lodging."</p>

<p>For an instant suspicion and fear like an animal's woke in the
small eyes. Then he laid some restraint on himself.</p>

<p>"You will guide me to Woodstock," he said. "Then you will be
rewarded for your good deeds and . . ."</p>

<p>"Punished for my ill ones." Peter smiled. "Get you ready,
sire, and we will taste what weather the morning has brought
us."</p>

<p>Henry, with many groans occasioned by his leg, got himself
into trunks, hose and doublet, still damp and wrinkled. He
followed Peter's lantern down the corridor, grumbling at the
stiffness of his limbs. The man to Peter's admiration seemed to
have no fear, and to be concerned only with his discomforts.</p>

<p>The open greeted them with a mild frost, which lay white on
all the west court, save one little strip which the sun had
warmed. The place, to Peter's surprise, was empty and still. He
had looked at least for Darking at the tunnel's mouth. "Solomon
is with the others," he told himself. "I will find him at the
Water-gate."</p>

<p>He gave Henry a hand as he limped over the broken flags of the
court, and squeezed through the choked postern. They came into
the little space of flat ground which bordered the river.
Windrush had shrunk since the night before, and the jagged piers
of the broken bridge stood out of the water, but, though the
current was less strong, it was still some furlongs wide.</p>

<p>He saw men and horses. But where was Darking? He looked again.
The men wore livery--red and white, it seemed. These were the
Howard tinctures. . . . He was seen, and a cry was raised. A man,
who sat his horse stiffly like a sentinel, turned and moved
towards him.</p>

<p>The man shouted and was answered by a cry from the King.</p>

<p>"To me!" Henry cried, his voice hoarse with the morning chill.
"Treason! Treason! I am the King. To me, all honest English!"</p>

<p>The men, a score at least, moved like a flock of rooks scared
from stubble, those who had dismounted scrambling into their
saddles. The sun caught their faces and Peter knew them for
enemies. He turned and ran east down the river bank, under the
great southern keep of the castle.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to swim the river--that impulse which
comes upon all fugitives to put the greatest immediate barrier
between them and pursuit. But he remembered that Darking and his
men must be in the Ramsden coverts, and that with them lay his
only safety. Had he followed his first instinct he would have
been wise, for Darking and every man of High Cotswold were at the
moment beyond the river, searching the thickets fruitlessly for
traces of Peter and the King.</p>

<p>Instead, by a path between the castle wall and the floods, so
narrow that no horse could pass, he turned the eastern buttress
and came out on what had once been Lovell's chase, a broad
hillside dotted with thorn and furze. On the crest was the dark
loom of Wychwood's skirts; once there he would be ill to follow.
His pursuers could not know the place, and would take time to
pass the ruined closes and granges of Minster Lovell, so as to
reach the chase from the west. He was right in his guess; for he
was nearly at the top of the slope, keeping always the scrub
between him and any man looking up from the valley, before he saw
horsemen emerge into the open.</p>

<p>He had no fear of capture. How could Norfolk's men hope to
take him in a land of which they knew naught, and which he had
conned since childhood. But it was not of himself that he
thought. God's plan, aforetime so miraculous in his eyes, had
miscarried. The King was back among his friends. He was no longer
lost and derelict and alone, but must now be plucked from the
heart of a troop. Peter's confidence flagged. . . . And meantime
where were his folk? Had Mother Sweetbread failed in her errand?
Or had Darking been overpowered somewhere in the night and his
troop scattered? . . . Peter grew sick with apprehension.</p>

<p>He had learned from Darking all the calls of the vagabond
folk--the dull whistle of the palliards, the broken whinny of the
priggers, the owl's hoot of the rufflers, the snipe's bleat of
the whipjacks. He tried each in turn, but there was no reply.
Yesterday this forest had been alive with secret dwellers, but
now it seemed as lifeless as a tomb. The birds that answered him
were not breeched fowls, but pigeons that broke with a crash from
the high tree-tops, and owls lumbering in the low coverts, and
the soft swish of zigzagging woodcock. Where in Heaven's name
were the vagabonds? What had become of John Naps's scouts? Where,
above all, was Darking?</p>

<p>But if there was no sign of his friends, there was proof of
the presence of others. As he crossed the forest road from
Charlbury to Witney he saw that it was puddled with fresh hoof
marks. A body of mounted men had passed here not an hour before,
and the horses had been heavy lowland beasts, not the light
mounts of his own people. . . . And then he had a sharp surprise.
There were men in the forest, riding like prickers to unharbour
deer. From a nook in the scrub he noticed several pass, men with
a purpose, men looking for something other than buck, for they
were not hunt servants. All wore livery or badges, and on one he
recognised the Talbot colours. The enemy had taken the offensive.
He was no longer the pursuer, but the pursued.</p>

<p>At last he was in the Ramsden dingles, and there he found only
cold ashes. Anxiety for Darking had now fevered his thoughts. Had
he and all his folk been driven out of the forest? Somehow,
somewhere, there had been a great rallying of the King's men. He
strove to think clearly. Darking in the night watches must have
been disturbed, and prevented from receiving Mother Sweetbread's
message, or, if the message had found him, from reaching Minster
Lovell. It must have been a strong force that dispossessed him,
but dispossessed he must have been--he and all John Naps's crew.
The forest was now full of the King's folk. Whither had Darking
gone? There was only one way--west by the high downs to their own
country. Some violent compulsion had made Darking leave without a
word of guidance to him; doubtless he trusted to his wits and
woodcraft to make the right deduction and follow. . . .</p>

<p>And then came a ray of light in the darkness. In a deep hollow
stood a verderer's hut, which had been the stable of the horse
Peter had ridden from Avelard, what time he left it behind after
the loosing of the gospeller. There it had remained during the
weeks of his fever at Little Greece. He had left it fourteen
hours back tied to a stump on the far side of Windrush. Now he
was greeted with a whinny, and found the bay ranging in its
stall, sniffing after stray grain and chaff in the corners. It
had broken its tether and swum Windrush, for its flanks and belly
were wet. There was some hay in the rack on the rafters from
which he fed it. The stirrup irons and bridle were dark with
frost.</p>

<p>His hopes rose. Here was a means by which he could overtake
Darking. This was his first business, for the whole plan must be
re-ordered. The King was alive to his peril, but that peril might
still be turned into doom. Whatever reinforcements he had got at
Woodstock--and, since the forest was alive with men, these
reinforcements must have been ample--they could be overmatched by
the levies from the west. War had been declared, and there could
be no turning back. Never had Peter felt such a heat of
resolution. Every nerve of mind and body was constrained into one
conscious purpose. He had seen his enemy and had understood both
his power and his maleficence. His soul seemed now to be drawn to
a fine edge of burning light.</p>

<p>They were beating the eastern forest for him; the troops at
Minster Lovell, with Henry behind them, would follow hard on his
tracks from the south; north lay Woodstock; his only course was
westward. He summoned all his remembered lore to his aid. He knew
a secret track which would bring him by Leafield to the open land
above Shipton Barren. Once there, it would be strange if he could
not ride fast by Taynton and Barrington and be past Northleach by
midday. His enemies were not likely to have anything in the way
of horseflesh that could vie with his bay for speed. He dug in
his spurs, and galloped for the high woods of the Leafield crest.
. . .</p>

<p>About the same moment Darking, who after two hours of daylight
had realised that the King and Peter were not south of Windrush,
had issued orders to troops and vagabonds alike to get back to
the north bank. Every mile Peter moved was separating him farther
from his friends. . . .</p>

<p>In an hour he was looking down on the road from Charlbury to
Burford, at almost the point where, in the early dawn, the
Carmelite had met the horsemen. A small army was encamped
there--not less than a thousand men, and a chain of posts north
and south along the highway barred all access to the Taynton
downs.</p>

<p>Peter crouched and reflected. If he tried to pass by he would
be seen. He might break through at a gap in the posts, but he
would certainly be pursued. Was there hope of escape? His hawk
eyes scanned the picketed horses, and he saw that they were of a
different breed from the heavy beasts now lumbering behind him in
the forest. They looked like southerners--Norfolk's men, maybe,
from his Sussex lands. Had he any chance of outdistancing such in
open country?</p>

<p>If his soul was on fire, his brain was cool. Calmly he
calculated his chances. They were quartering the forest behind
him, and if he went back that way he would have to discard his
horse and take to crawling in thickets. He might escape
discovery, but there was no hope there, with Darking spurring
somewhere on the road to the west. Besides, he would presently
starve. He thought of sheltering with Mother Sweetbread, but only
to discard the notion. Whatever befell him, he could not involve
her in his danger. But indeed the forest was useless now. The
campaign had moved to a different country. It was the west, High
Cotswold, that mattered, the place where Darking had gone. . .
.</p>

<p>At that moment John Naps's men were filtering back into
Wychwood. Darking and half his force had fetched a circuit,
crossed Windrush below Witney, and were even now approaching the
Ramsden brakes. One company of the King's men had been surprised
by them, disarmed, and dismounted, and were now, mostly with
broken heads, sitting in Finstock meadow. . . .</p>

<p>All quarters seemed shut to Peter but the north. An idea came
to him. What about the road he had ridden three days back?
Charlbury bridge was indeed on the direct track from Woodstock,
but for that reason it would be the less closely guarded. The
bold road might be the wise road. . . . He moved farther north on
the crest. The pickets only occupied the higher ground, and did
not extend to the meadows by Evenlode. He could not see the
bridge nor the causeway, but he could see the track winding down
to within half a mile of it, and it was empty.</p>

<p>His mind was made up. He would cross at Charlbury, where he
was not looked for, and take the high road by Stow to the west.
He had worn no sword the day before, for he had not looked for
fighting, and had feared lest any weapon might obstruct his
passage in the thickets. But a weapon he needed now. With his
knife he cut and trimmed a great cudgel from an ash tree, and
made it sing round his head. "If there is a sentinel on Charlbury
bridge he will get a cracked skull," he thought. He felt
strangely exalted. An issue would yet be found out of his
perplexities.</p>

<p>Very carefully he made his way, leading his horse, round the
butt of the hill till Charlbury bridge came in view. Evenlode had
ebbed and the current no longer swirled over the two causeways;
it barely lipped them. There was nobody at the near end of the
bridge. The far end he could not see, for the high central arch
blocked it. There was a hovel or two there, he knew, but the
little town lay well to the right on the hill. He could see the
smoke going up straight from its chimneys in the windless
morning.</p>

<p>He came to the edge of the forest, beyond which some furlongs
of meadowland separated him from the bridge. Less than a mile lay
between him and safety, but he knew that that mile held the
crisis of his life. He had the exaltation but also the anxiety of
a great purpose. He knelt and prayed to the Virgin, her of whom
he had had a vision in the snowy wood, but he had no answering
comfort. "The Blessed Ones have left me to face this business
alone," he told himself. "Well, here's for fortune!"</p>

<p>He mounted his horse and rode towards the bridge with his
great cudgel carried at the rest, as a man might ride the lists
at a tourney. Not a soul was visible in the wide landscape.</p>

<p>There was a little rise of ground before he reached the first
causeway, and there his eye could just surmount the high bridge
back. Something he saw beyond, and that something was like the
summit of a pleached hedge. He knew it for the tips of spears.
There were men stationed on the other side.</p>

<p>His eyes dimmed and then cleared, and out of his heart went
all carefulness. That awoke in him which had sent his forbears
rending the Scottish footmen and driving through the mellay at
Poictiers. He felt light-hearted and unconquerable. His great
stick was like a straw in his hands. He had in him the power to
subdue thousands. He was singing to himself, singing small and
low, and the words were Sabine's song.</p>

<p>The spurs were in the bay's flanks, and in a mad gallop he was
on the causeway. . . . <i>Summer is come with love to town. . .
.</i> The light lip of the tide flew around him in spray. . . .
<i>Sweet mistress, why so pale O? . . .</i> With a bound he was
on the bridge's keystone. . . . <i>The deer draw to the dale
O!</i> He saw below him a blur of men . . . and spear-points.
Their faces seemed strangely white. They blocked the path, most
of them dismounted, and they stared--stared with blank eyes.
Could such feeble folk stay him? He saw one man on a horse with a
blue surcoat over mail, and he saw him draw his sword. Down the
steep descent from the arch to the far causeway he thundered, and
men gave way for him and two fell sprawling. The horseman took
his cudgel on his sword arm and promptly rolled from his
horse.</p>

<p>Peter was not humming now, for the fury of an older England
was on him. For the last time men heard a cry once more terrible
than trumpets--the cry of "God and the Swan." . . . They divided
and some ran, for the ash stick was breaking their heads and
snapping their spear-shafts.</p>

<p>But there was a stout man at the back, one Jonas Turph, the
Swinbrook armourer, and he bore a great hammer. Likewise he had a
steel cap under his felt bonnet. On his head the ash stick
shivered into a dozen pieces, and the hard skull beneath took no
scaith. Peter was almost through--in three strides more he would
be beyond the causeway with the road open for the west. But the
armourer, shaking his head like a dog coming out of water, swung
his hammer. It struck the bay's rump, there was the squeal of a
beast in pain, and down it came with a palsied back. . . . A
great hand plucked at Peter's neck from behind, and in an instant
he was on the ground with a press of men atop of him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sir Ferdinando Fettiplace, nursing a broken arm, looked at the
trussed and half-senseless figure with a wry face.</p>

<p>"Curse on the madcap," he said. "'Twill be a month of Sundays
ere I can sup broth again. This day will be worth a capful of
gold to you, Jonas Turph, for beyond doubt 'tis the lad the
King's grace is seeking. Well-grown, they said, and comely, and
habited in russet and green. By the Blood of Hailes, but he is
ripe for hanging, for with such abroad there can be no peace in
England. He came down on us like the lightnings of God."</p>

<h1><a name="c16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h1>

<h1>HOW PETER RETURNED TO THE GREENWOOD</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He was brought next morning before the King. Henry sat in the
banqueting-house at Woodstock, with every window open, for the
day was mild and he heated quickly. The guards were no longer
Shrewsbury's hundred spears, for Norfolk had sent a thousand men
under Surrey his son, and Sir John Denton had brought his Epping
riders, and half the squires of east Oxfordshire and Berkshire
had hastened each with his mounted lackeys to honour the King.
The park was like a tented field in the foreign wars.</p>

<p>Peter had been well enough treated by the Fettiplace men. They
had forborne to question him, and one, who knew something of
leechcraft, had tended his bruises. That morning he had been
heavily manacled and handed over by them to the royal guards,
after listening to a stammering speech of loyalty from Sir
Ferdinando and Henry's gracious reply--Sir Ferdinando whose name
had been on the Avelard muster-roll. Peter did not grumble. He
hoped that no thick-witted country lording would suffer in his
cause, since that cause was now doomed and destroyed. . . .
Darking would know of his capture, and, he trusted, would lead
his men safely back to High Cotswold. Avelard would hear of it,
and Neville, and all the rest, and the levies would melt like
snow in an April sun. Only he himself would suffer, which was
just, since he was Bohun and might have been king.</p>

<p>He was in a strange mood, equable, almost happy. A load of
care seemed to have fallen from him. He had no longer to think of
others, only of himself, and that was a light task. . . . For him
there was but the one fate. The great mill of destiny with which
he had conversed two nights before, would grind him small. A
miracle, and he might have overthrown it, but that miracle had
miscarried. God had other purposes. It was His celestial will
that the Beast should rule a little longer in England. . . . But
he would not see that rule, for he would be under the sod. "Only
the dead are beautiful and free"--why should fear vex any man,
when so easy a gate gave upon a land where fears were at
rest?</p>

<p>He looked curiously at the tall guards on each side of his
settle, at the mob of Woodstock townsmen who thronged the doors
in lively terror of the yeoman of the hall with his silver wand,
at the dust-motes dancing in the sunlight which slanted through
the windows, at the King in his crimson chair at the table on the
dais, and the councillors about him. He saw Sir John Denton, and
Chartley, and a red-faced ecclesiastic whom he knew for Dr John
London of Oxford. One other, too, a stout man in a furred black
gown, with a large pale face, a host of chins, a low voice, and
steady ruminant eyes--a familiar face, it seemed. He asked one of
the guards, and was told "the lord Crummle."</p>

<p>Henry was in a high humour. He had had an adventure out of
which he had come with credit and safety. He felt confirmed in
his self-confidence and in the approbation of God. That morning
he had served at High Mass, and the odour of the black ropy
incense which he loved still clung to him. He had eaten for
breakfast the best part of a pasty of quails, and a great dish of
buttered kidneys. The glow of conscious holiness and good feeding
was in his veins.</p>

<p>He had many despatches to read, which he passed among his
lords. Then he looked round the hall and saw Peter.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said. "'Tis the mad monk. Bring the man forward that
my lords may see him. This is he that threatened the majesty of
England, and held it in durance for a winter's night. But for
your timely appearance, Sir John, it might be now lying in a
ditch with a slit throat. Mark the fellow--he has thews like
Goliath and the eye of a wrestler. Dangerous stuff to be
abbey-bred!"</p>

<p>The lords looked at Peter incuriously. Battered and pale, his
clothes torn and soiled, he looked a common vagabond, of whom the
land had many. He had fallen in with the King, when lost
a-hunting, and had threatened him. For that he must swing, but it
did not concern them. The King's story might or might not be
true--he was a ripe liar on occasion--but it mattered little
whether there was one unfrocked priest the less in the world.
Only Crummle looked at him sharply. The guards would have led
Peter away, but Crummle motioned to them to withdraw to the side
of the hall.</p>

<p>"Will your majesty see the other?" he asked, and Henry, who
was telling the young Howard of a new falcon, nodded.</p>

<p>Peter was in the dusk now, out of the way of the sunbeams. He
saw the crowd cleared at the doorway, and a tall man enter with a
rope at his wrists. His face had a great gash on the left cheek,
from which blood still oozed. He held his head stiffly, and Peter
saw for the first time since Little Greece the high bold
countenance of Simon Rede.</p>

<p>Henry knitted his brows.</p>

<p>"This is the Luterano," he said. "A pest on the fellow for a
crack-brain! Once he promised well, you say?" And he turned to
Crummle.</p>

<p>"He carried letters, your majesty, for the Council to the
Court of Denmark," said Crummle in his soft even voice.</p>

<p>"And now he must needs abet the traitors who would have
England godless, and blaspheme the holy mysteries." Henry, with
the incense of the mass still in his nostrils, grew hot. He
consulted a paper. "He assisted the escape of one of the most
pernicious of the foul brood called gospellers, deforced the
servants of King and Church, and, when taken at last, broke
sundry honest skulls and was heady in his impenitence. He has
uttered blasphemies, says this indictment, too shocking to
reiterate to godly ears, and he has altogether refused to confess
his sins. . . . Hark you, sirrah!" Henry's face was mottled with
passion. "I will have no heretics in England, be they gentle or
simple. You are born, they tell me, of an honourable house, and
have served with credit in the wars. The more shame to you for
your errors! I have said it, and I say it now, that I will root
out of the land every seed of false doctrine, till this England
be the very apple of God's eye for its sweet and united
faith."</p>

<p>"What is your majesty's will concerning him?" Crummle asked.
He seemed to be about to put forward some plea on the prisoner's
behalf. But the King's face was stern.</p>

<p>"He will go to the court of my lord Bishop of Lincoln. He will
be given the chance to acknowledge his errors and to recant them.
If he continue obdurate, he shall burn, by God, burn as if he
were a common blasphemer from the kennels."</p>

<p>Henry signed to Sir John Denton, his temporary marshal. "I
would be alone with my Vicar-General. Have the rabble cleared
from the door, and do you, my dear lord, wait on me again in an
hour's space. . . . No. Remove the Luterano, but leave the monk.
I may have a word to speak to him."</p>

<p>The hall was emptied, and the great door shut on the curious
Woodstock townsmen. Henry sat in his crimson chair, with the
portly Crummle beside him, and he signed to Peter to come out of
the gloom. "Get you to the door," he told the guards, "and wait
till you be summoned. The fellow is safe, for he has a load of
iron on his wrists."</p>

<p>It was a different Henry. The complacency, the jollity, the
sudden passion had all gone out of face and voice. He looked
infinitely wary, and cunning, and wise. He smiled upon Crummle,
who smiled also, craftily.</p>

<p>"It is he," said the King, "he we were told of. Nay, man,
there is no need of proof to one who has seen Edward Stafford.
Every inch of him is Buckingham's get."</p>

<p>The fat man looked Peter over slowly, shrewdly, not
unkindly.</p>

<p>"He is a child," he said.</p>

<p>"No child, by God!" said Henry, "but one with more wits than
any six Bohuns since William Conqueror. My lord, this realm has
escaped a great peril. We know something of what is afoot in the
west. But for the blessed weather, sent by God's own providence,
all Severn might have been on us. This stripling was their hope,
and without him they are scattered sheep. How great were Heaven's
mercies usward! First the floods, and then this lad in some wild
folly stumbles upon me, and puts his neck into the noose."</p>

<p>"I have heard your majesty's tale," said Crummle. "'Twas a
most happy deliverance."</p>

<p>"Well may you say so. Our troubles thin, my lord, and the sky
clears. The east is quiet again. Aske in the north sues for
mercy, and the mischief in the west dies still-born."</p>

<p>"What fate have you decreed for him?" Crummle asked.</p>

<p>"He will hang comfortably and quietly," said Henry, purring
like a great cat. "No new Lambert Simnel tales--only a nameless
monk who dabbles in hedge-treason and dangles for it. I purpose
to send him into Berkshire with Sir Miles Flambard to hang at
Reading. He is condemned of English law under the sanction given
to a commander in the field, such as at this moment am I. The
name in the death record is that which he bore at Oseney--Peter
Pentecost."</p>

<p>"Your majesty has gone deep into the matter," said Crummle.
"That is a name none of my intelligencers told to me."</p>

<p>Henry smiled and whispered something in the other's ear, and
Peter thought that he caught the word "Messynger."</p>

<p>"You are confident that the danger is overpast?" Crummle
asked.</p>

<p>"As I hope for salvation. I have sent one post to Avelard and
another to Marchington. There will be a hasty spurring of horses
eastward to make peace with a merciful King, nor will the
suppliants be repelled." Again Henry smiled, and again he spoke
low in the other's ear, and this time there was no doubt that
Messynger was among the words he uttered.</p>

<p>"Leave me now, friend Thomas," he said. "I would have one word
alone with this youth before he is sent to the judgment of an
offended God."</p>

<p>Crummle arose and moved slowly from the hall, limping heavily,
for he had a fit of the gout. The guards were back at the door
out of earshot. Peter and the King were as secluded as they had
been in Lovell's castle.</p>

<p>Henry was grinning. Peter's eyes dazzled, and the winter
sunlight seemed to darken. It was dusk now, and in it the great
red face glowed like a moon.</p>

<p>"You are he that would have ruled England?" The words came
with a rich gusto of contempt. "Man, you had me at your mercy.
You could have squeezed my life out with these strong hands of
yours, and Henry would have been as lost to the world as the
rotting bones of Lovell. What brain-sick whimsy made you dream
that you were the metal of which kings are wrought?"</p>

<p>The glowing face mesmerised Peter. It was like that moon of
blood which he had seen at Avelard when the thundercloud broke at
dawn.</p>

<p>"I offered you an abbacy--with the reversion of a bishopric,"
the voice went on. "You heeded me not, which was wise, for a
promise wrung under durance is no promise. But that was due to no
wit of yours, but to your pride of dreams. 'Faith, you will
presently have peace to dream--the dream from which there is no
awaking. In the space of twenty-four hours you will be carrion.
You will learn what is the penalty of sinning against Henry of
England."</p>

<p>The countenance was no longer a moon, but that of a great cat
tormenting its prey. It seemed that the cat was disappointed, for
the brows knitted in anger. There was no answering shadow of fear
in Peter's face, for to him the whole scene was like some crazy
mumming-play. His eyes regarded the King as incuriously as if he
were a guizard at Hallowmas. What they saw was the blanket of the
dark rolling over all England, not this angry glow in the heart
of it.</p>

<p>"I am merciful," said the voice. "You saved my life in the
floods for your own purpose and out of no love for my person.
Nevertheless, for that I will make return. There will be no
blazoning abroad of the treason of Buckingham's son. You will die
decently in the name you bore as a monk, and you and your race
will be forgotten utterly. . . . Nay, nay--there will be no
cherishing in the west of a tender memory. Avelard and Neville
and the rest will be on their knees to make their peace with me,
and will be glad to banish the very thought of you. You and your
proud stock will have vanished out of the world like the flood
waters which are now draining to the sea. In a little men will
not know how to spell the forgotten names of Stafford and
Bohun."</p>

<p>At last Peter spoke.</p>

<p>"I am content," he said. "I perish with the older England. I
welcome oblivion."</p>

<p>Henry's lips puckered, but the smile was rather of
bewilderment than mirth.</p>

<p>"You are for certain a madman or a fool," he cried, "and the
land is well rid of you. Carry your whimsies to the worms." He
rang his silver bell, and Crummle limped from a side door to the
dais. He cast one sharp glance at Peter, and he too smiled, but
the smile had comprehension in it. He was more familiar than the
King with men who sat loose to earthly fears.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sir Miles Flambard, a knight of the shire who had a small
place in Crummle's retinue, was a heavy anxious man with no love
for his mission. He started the instant dinner was over, for he
had a mind to sleep at Wallingford, and he wanted to pass Stowood
before the twilight. He had twenty-five armed men with him,
Sussex choughs from Norfolk's band--none too many, he held, to
guard two desperate men on a journey through broken country. The
prisoners were tied leg to leg with loose ropes, so that their
beasts were constrained to keep together; each had his hands
manacled and fastened loosely to the saddle-bow, and his feet
joined by a cord under his horse's belly; while, for greater
security, a light chain ran from the waist of each to the waist
of an adjacent guard. The cavalcade clattered into Woodstock
market-place half an hour after noon.</p>

<p>Simon Rede still held his head high--it would never willingly
droop except in death. He looked ill and weary, and the blood
oozed from his cheek.</p>

<p>"It seems that our fates are bound together," he said, as his
knee rubbed against Peter's when they jogged across the cobbles.
There was kindness in his voice and eyes.</p>

<p><i>"Nunc ex diverso sedem veniemus in unam,"</i> was Peter's
answer.</p>

<p>"'Twill be a long cold home, I fear. I have not your
philosophy," and Simon looked sideways at the other. "Please God,
I will have another stroke for freedom before the faggots. But
for these cursed bonds we might have a chance, for you and I are
a match for a dozen choughs. Would God but send fog or snow
instead of this sunshine."</p>

<p>At the market-cross, where the inn stood, there was a crowd
which delayed the party. A little group of riders was dismounting
in the inner courtyard. Most were servants, but two were
gentlefolk--a young man in a rose-coloured cloak and a woman
wearing a bonnet of white ermine. There was no mistaking the red
hair of Sir Gabriel Messynger, and the bonnet had ridden by
Peter's side on the eve of the great snowstorm.</p>

<p>A strangled cry told that Simon Rede had recognised the
pair.</p>

<p>"The popinjay has won," he groaned. "God's curse on all
women!"</p>

<p>"Do not curse her. She has found a fitting mate," said Peter
gently. "May Heaven be kind to her."</p>

<p>After that there was little speech between them. At last
Simon's proud head had sunk, and Peter was far away in a world of
fancies.</p>

<p>"Islip bridge stands," Simon muttered. "We must go by Gosford
and the bridge, and the skirts of Shotover. Had I known betimes,
I could have had twenty stout lads waiting in the Shotover
glades."</p>

<p>As they left the Oxford road for the track across the
Campsfield downs the cavalcade had to pass through a narrow stone
postern. A beggar, hideously scarred and heavily bandaged, sat by
the gate crying for alms--an abraham apparently, for his eyes
rolled and his lips frothed like a madman's. He was on his feet
as the prisoners made the passage, and, since it was narrow and
they had to move sidelong, there was a minute's delay. He clawed
at Peter's arm, and for a second Peter looked into his eyes, and
saw something there which was not frenzy. That something
momentarily shook him out of his absorption.</p>

<p>"How far to the skirts of Wychwood?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"As far as to Peter's Gate," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Alack . . . I . . . shall . . . not . . . be . . . there . .
. in . . . time." The words were jolted from him by a sudden jib
of his horse, and the pauses between them fell naturally. He cast
a look behind, but the abraham seemed to have sunk into the
ground.</p>

<p>After that he was back in his dreams. . . . He had no fear of
death and no shrinking from it, but indeed the thought of it was
scarcely in his mind. Nor did he dwell on the gross figure behind
him at Woodstock, whose mastery of the land was confirmed by his
own fall. Scarcely even on Bohun--the proud name which would
never again rally England. All these things seemed to have faded
into a very dim past, to be only the echoes of what befell long
ago. . . . His heart was filled with a different memory, the
vision of her who had appeared to him in his hour of peril in the
snowy forest and had promised him everlasting life.</p>

<p>He felt rapt above all the sorrows of earth. Six months ago he
had been eating out his heart in vain ambitions; now he had
ridden the full range of them and found the mountain-top beyond.
He almost laughed aloud to think of the callow child who had once
dreamed of glory. He had had glory within his grasp, and had
brought it as an offering to the feet of her whose glory was
beyond sun, moon and stars. The blanket of the dark covered the
earth, but it made only the brighter that heavenly radiance which
burned for him and made a path of light to immortality. . . .
Peter in his exaltation seemed to be lifted out of the body. . .
. He had no cognisance of Simon's grim face by his side, or the
jostling horses and the thick Sussex speech, or the wild birds
calling over Campsfield. His thoughts had become music, and he
made that hymn to the Queen of Heaven which is still to be read
in the books. It is in Latin, with echoes of Adam of
Saint-Victor, but with something of the human longing of the
songs which Aucassin sang to Nicolette in the forest. For his
Queen walked in spring meadows and had flowers in her hair.</p>

<p>At the Gosford crossing there was delay. The fisherman, who
lived near-by and was the guide to the ford, could not be found,
and the Sussex man who attempted to lead the way floundered into
deep water and had to be dragged out by the hair. The better part
of an hour was spent in crossing, while Sir Miles's maledictions
rumbled like a thunderstorm. Beyond the river the floods filled
the meadows, and the road was not easy. A loutish boy appeared
and offered himself as guide, but he was little good at the job,
and the party were several times bogged to the girths. It seemed
as if the boy sought to catch Peter's eye, and as he fled, after
the flat of Sir Miles's sword had descended on his back, he made
the priggers' sign.</p>

<p>At Islip also there was a hitch. Two ox-carts had jammed in
the narrow bridge, and had to be removed with a grinding of
broken timber. Vagabondage was abroad that day. There was a troop
of crowders in the little town, and as many cozeners and
dommerers as if it had been an abbey-gate, and a knot of dark men
at the bridge-end who had the air of rufflers and whose long
knives were plain beneath their shirts.</p>

<p>Simon was roused from his moodiness. "What means this muster
of rogues?" he asked.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But Peter did not hear him. They had begun to ascend the long
slopes of Wood Eaton, and something in the aspect and scent of
the place brought him back to earth. It was already almost dusk,
and a light haze filled the hollows. The air was balmy like
spring, and one planet shone bright in the eastern sky. There was
a faint music of bells--from Islip church behind them, from the
famous Wood Eaton Flageolets, and a distant murmur from the
Oxford towers. He remembered that it was the eve of No&euml;l.
Even now in Oseney Great Church the brethren would be at
vespers.</p>

<p>But he did not think of Oseney, and the sound in his ear was
not the chanting of choirs, or the smell in his nostrils the
odour of incense. He was feeling in every nerve, in that
midwinter twilight, the tumult of the coming spring. This was the
place he had loved best, and where he had spent so many summer
hours; it was the sanctuary of his youth, that part of earth with
which his very soul was interfused. The opal haze, rising out of
the moist ground, cloaked its winter bareness; beneath it the
flowers were already springing; was that a clump of early
primroses by the hazels? . . . Might there not be a world of
light under the blanket of the dark?</p>

<p>Once again, as in the snowy forest, he seemed to be granted a
revelation. He had been promised life, but he had thought it
meant a life beyond the grave, and all day his thoughts had been
on Paradise. Now they were back in the terrestrial world, and he
was aware that the Queen of Heaven was walking these familiar
fields. In the dark he saw the gleam of her robes, blue as a
speedwell. What was her message for him? Was some miracle
preparing? His heart leaped in a sudden hope.</p>

<p>There was another marvel. The air had become jubilant with
birds. It was a mid-winter dusk when no feathered things should
have been heard except owls and homing crows. But the thickets
seemed to be loud with song. There were skylarks soaring to
heaven, and woodlarks uttering their quiet sweet notes, and
blackbirds with their pipes and cymbals. And, surely, from the
hazels came the throb of the nightingale.</p>

<p>Dimly he heard Simon's excited whisper. "The thickets are full
of folk. . . . There is something afoot. A malison on these
bonds!" He felt him straining at his foot shackles, and their
horses jostled.</p>

<p>Sir Miles Flambard was violently out of temper. No hope now of
making Wallingford that night--the best they could do was
Dorchester, or maybe the hedge tavern at Horspath. And here they
were in Stowood and twilight was upon them. He was afraid of the
common road up the defile--there was too good a chance of an
ambush between those steep shaggy banks. So he gave the order for
a flank turn, and, leaving the chase of Wood Eaton on the right,
to take the spur which would bring them to the cleared ground of
Elsfield. That at least was open country, save for one or two
coppices. He bade his troopers close in on the prisoners, and
himself rode in front.</p>

<p>As they topped the Wood Eaton crest the moon rose and gave Sir
Miles a prospect. The land looked open and safe and his spirits
lightened. In two hours they would be snug in Dorchester. The
scrub was empty except for cowering birds. . . . The Sussex men
were not woodlanders, and could not discern that faint rustle in
the bracken which was not due to any animal, or that pad in the
hollow below which could come only from bare human feet. Simon
had forest-tuned ears and knew it, and to Peter every sound told
an authentic tale.</p>

<p>A miracle was preparing. He knew that he would not die, and
with this knowledge came the passionate desire to live--not in
bliss, but in the lowly world under the dark blanket to which his
Queen seemed to beckon him. He heard her promise whispered in the
still air--"And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the
Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare
His ways."</p>

<p>They dipped from the Wood Eaton slope to the green hollow,
where was the spring mentioned in that Oseney parchment which had
first given him the clue to the Painted Floor. Now he knew the
place for which the miracle had been ordained. . . . He spoke low
to Simon.</p>

<p>"You see that coppice on the hill before us. Be ready there,
for something will happen."</p>

<p>"The undergrowth is like a coney-warren for folk." Simon spoke
through clenched teeth. "In God's name who are they? We are
trussed like dressed woodcock. . . . Had I but one free
hand!"</p>

<p>"Have no fear! I have the promise. Be still and wait on
God."</p>

<p>The horses squelched through a marshland, and then with much
heaving and lurching were on the hard ground of the forest
slopes. They jingled up the glade where the spring bubbled,
splashing sometimes in the little runnel which it fed. The haze
on this higher ground had gone, and in the moonlight the coppice
with its tall trees stood up like a mound of ebony.
<i>"Imperatrix supernorum"</i>--Peter whispered his prayer which
was also a chant of triumph:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"C&oelig;li regina per quam medicina</i><br>
 <i>Datur &aelig;grotis, gratia devotis,</i><br>
 <i>Gaudium m&oelig;stis, mundo lux c&oelig;lestis,</i><br>
 <i>Spesque salutis."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>They were in the deep brake at the wood's edge when a low thin
whistle cleft the air, clear as a bird's call and no louder. Sir
Miles did not hear it, and was conscious of no danger till a long
arm plucked him from his horse.</p>

<p>Out of the bracken under their feet men rose, as stealthily as
a fog oozes from wet soil. There was a movement by Peter's left
foot, and he felt the shackle cut which bound his feet below his
horse's belly and which attached his leg to Simon's. The trooper
on his right had moved away so that the rope between them was
taut, and it parted with a twang that set him free but for his
gyved hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a wild confusion. He saw Simon bring down
his manacles with a crash on the head of the rider on his left.
The glade seemed to be full of rearing horses, and thick Sussex
oaths. He saw men on the ground struggling and the flash of
knives. . . . There was a dark beetle-browed face near him, and
he knew it for Catti the Welshman. . . . He felt himself pulled
from his saddle and hands clutching his throat, hands which
suddenly relaxed. Somewhere in the mellay a horse kicked him, and
for a second or two his senses swam. . . . Then a great peace
came over him. Hands not unkindly were dragging him, for his
cramped legs tottered. He was out of the glade among trees. A man
was beside him, speaking in a soft crooning voice, a man with a
shrunken face and deep-set eyes and wild black hair. The man was
giving him water out of his cap, and staunching with a rag the
blood from the scalp-wound made by the horse's hoof.</p>

<p>But Peter saw the figure by his side dimly, for his eyes were
on the scene before him. He lay above the Painted Floor, in the
very spot where he had been used to make his seat on holidays.
The world seemed to have grown very quiet. The moon shone on the
Floor, washing the tiles with silver, so that the place looked
like a summer sea. And over its waters moved the presence that he
had invoked, proud and tender and grave. She wore no crown, and
there was no gold on her breast, only the robes of celestial
blue. "I have given you life," she seemed to say, and when he
stretched out longing arms towards her she smiled like a
mother.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Catti was cleaning his knife, and fingering now and then a new
gash on his forehead.</p>

<p>"We must be in the deeps of Bernwood ere morning," he said.
"It appears that our new king is to rule not in England but in
the greenwood."</p>

<p>Pierce the Piper was whittling at a boxwood flute.</p>

<p>"I have found another of my trade," he said. "My lord here is
one that dreams dreams and sees visions."</p>

<h1><a name="c17">EPILOGUE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the pleasant shire of Kent the manor of Roodhurst has long
lost its rustic peace. The old house disappeared in the reign of
Anne, and the park this twenty years has been carved into
suburban roads and gardens. But the ancient flint-built church
still stands, and on the left of the altar are the Messynger
tombs. There, on a plinth of black marble, my lord lies carved in
alabaster, with his robes curiously coloured and a gilded Garter
jewel at his breast. For Sir Gabriel became a great man and the
master of broad lands over all south England. Henry made him the
Lord Messynger of Roodhurst, and under Mary he won an earl's
coronet and an ample fortune. Nor did Elizabeth degrade him. He
trimmed his faith opportunely, and died in full possession of the
wealth he had won and in the sunshine of his Queen's favour.</p>

<p>On the shelf beneath him is the figure of his countess, less
resplendent, but with a gilt coif above her marble face. On the
entablature, among the heraldic scutcheons, may be read in
lapidary Latin how Sabina, Comitessa de Roodhurst, died in the
odour of sanctity in the year after her lord, hasting to rejoin
him in Heaven. The inscription tells of her wifely merits, her
pieties, her meekness, her assured hope of salvation. It
enumerates her children, one son who continued the name, and no
less than seven daughters, who found fitting husbands, so that,
though the title died out soon after the Restoration, the blood
of Messynger and Beauforest is still perpetuated in high
places.</p>

<p>The name of the Countess Sabine flashes now and then into the
national story--in state papers, in court memoirs, in the
dedicatory addresses of many poets. But more is to be gathered
from the local histories. She was a great lady in Kent, a figure
like Anne Clifford in the North. Her beauty is extolled; her hair
was unstreaked with grey till her death, and her figure, owing
perhaps to her passion for horsemanship, remained to the end that
of a slim nymph and not of a mother of children. She was the best
of wives, and there is a tale of how, in her husband's interest,
she won by her arts the grace of a queen who did not love her own
sex. Her virtues were eminent and high-handed; she ruled her
lord's estates with far-sighted skill, generous to those who
obeyed her, but adamant to opposition, loved by some, feared by
many, deeply respected by all. In her rural domain she was a
lesser Gloriana, and men spoke of her as they spoke of Elizabeth,
with pride and awe and a remote affection. In very truth, says
her epitaph, a virtuous woman, a true mother in Israel, whose
price was above rubies.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sir Ralph Bonamy dwelt peacefully in Wood Eaton until his
death at a ripe age in the same year as King Henry, keeping open
house, breakfasting magnificently on beef and ale, hunting in
Stowood, and fowling on Otmoor, and training such falcons as were
not to be matched in England. To his house came Brother Tobias,
when the community of Oseney was scattered, and there he spent
his declining years as the family chaplain. Tobias became a
silent old man, who stirred little from his chamber, where he was
busy with a Latin version of Euripides in the manner of Seneca--a
work which has not survived. Sometimes, seated among his books,
he would receive in conference uncouth men out of the woods, and
on a winter's night by the hall fire he and Sir Ralph would speak
of dangerous things. They agreed that the blanket of the dark had
fallen on England, and that long before it lifted they would be
both in Paradise. Sometimes they spoke of the Lady Messynger, and
Brother Tobias would propound a fancy. He would tell how, in
Euripides' play, the true Helen was carried to Egypt, and how it
was only a phantom Helen that went to Troy with Paris and brought
on Greeks and Trojans unnumbered ills. So it was, he said, with
the Lady Sabine. There was a true woman of that name, who was
beloved by two noble youths, but where that woman was gone, said
he, was known only to God. What survived was but a phantom, a
hollow thing with much beauty and more cunning, who was mated to
another hollow thing, and shone resplendently in a hollow world.
The real Sabine was no doubt laid up in Heaven. And then he would
laugh, and remind himself that such fancies might be Platonism
but were not orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Tobias was dead and Sir Ralph was dead before Simon Rede
returned to England. He had sailed with Breton captains to the
coasts of the New World, and had been much engaged in the early
religious wars of France. He returned in the eighth year of
Elizabeth to a moiety of his estate--a man far older than his
age. To Court he never went, nor did he find a wife, but lived
solitary in the Boarstall tower, dying at last of a fever in his
sixtieth year. The manor went to a great-nephew, who pulled down
the old walls and built that noble house which Sir William
Campion in the Civil Wars defended for King Charles.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You will find a note of Simon and of Sir Ralph in the local
histories, but not of Peter. After that Christmas Eve on the
Painted Floor he disappears clean out of any record. Avelard and
Neville papers reveal nothing, for there was no more talk of
trouble in the west. He went down into a world of which there has
never been a chronicle, the heaths and forests of old England.
But somewhere in Bernwood or Savernake or Charnwood or Sherwood
he may have found a home, or on the wild Welsh marches, or north
among the heather of the dales. Or he may have been a wanderer,
taking for his domicile the whole of the dim country whose border
is the edge of the highroad and the rim of the tillage and the
last stone walls of the garths. The blanket of the dark might
lift for England, but no light will ever reveal those ancient
recesses.</p>

<p>Yet I cherish the belief that of Peter we have one faint
record. I present it, such as it is, in the words of a letter
from my friend, the rector of a Northants parish, who desires to
be unnamed, but who is very learned in the antiquities of that
wide forest country, which is now a thing of patches, but which
once flowed over half the midlands:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"There died here last week," he writes, "an old man, the last
of his name, one Obadiah Bunn. He was an extraordinary old
fellow, a real forester--not a gipsy, but an adept in all gipsy
lore. I am sorry he has gone, for I learned a lot from him, and I
am sorry that the family is extinct, for it interested me
enormously. The Boons, Boones, Bunns--the spelling varies--seem
to have been in this neighbourhood for at least three hundred
years. According to local tradition, they have always been of the
same type--the men tall and well-made, the women (there was
rarely more than one in any Bunn family) remarkably handsome.
They were a queer folk, silent and self-contained, and keeping
very much to themselves--odd-tempered at times--decent on the
whole, for they never produced a drunkard--wonderful
horse-breakers and horse-copers and dog-trainers and
poachers--relics of an earlier England. They had not the gipsy
colouring, being mostly fair, and nothing annoyed them more than
to be taken for gipsies. One feature which local gossip says
characterised the whole strain was a slight cleft in the upper
lip, which, combined with their fine carriage, gave them an odd
air of masterfulness. They were great wanderers, for only one or
two of the men in each generation remained at home, the others
emigrating or joining the army. I believe I can put up a good
case for the view that Daniel Boone, the American hunter and
frontiersman, came of their stock.</p>

<p>"You remember Chief Justice Crewe's famous question: 'Where is
Bohun? where is Mowbray? where is Mortimer?' . . . Gone in name,
but not perhaps in blood. Somewhere those high strains are in the
commonalty of England, for it is the commonalty that endures. Can
I answer one part of the question? Will you think me fantastic if
I look on those stiff dwellers in our forest bounds, those men
and women with the curl of the lip and the quiet eyes, as the
heirs of Bohun? If so, old Obadiah Bunn was the last of a proud
race."</p>
