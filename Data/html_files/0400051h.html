<h2><i>Plot for a Novel</i></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>John Loving's private office in the offices of Eliot
and Company, New York City. On the left, a window. Before it, a
chair, its back to the window, and a table. At rear of table, an
armchair, facing front. A third chair is at right of table. In
the rear wall, a door leading to the outer offices. At center of
the room, toward right, another chair.</i></p>

<p><i>It is afternoon of a cloudy day in Spring, 1932. The light
from the window is chill and gray. At the rise of the curtain,
this light is concentrated around the two figures seated at the
table. As the action goes on, the light imperceptibly spreads
until, at the close of the opening scene between John and Loving,
it has penetrated to all parts of the room.</i></p>

<p><i>John is seated in the chair at left of desk. He is forty,
of medium height. His face is handsome, with the rather heavy,
conventional American type of good looks--a straight nose and a
square jaw, a wide mouth that has an incongruous feminine
sensitiveness, a broad forehead, blue eyes. He is dressed in a
dark suit, white shirt and collar, a dark tie, black shoes and
socks.</i></p>

<p><i>Loving sits in the armchair at rear of table. He is the
same age, of the same height and figure, is dressed in every
detail exactly the same. His hair is the same--dark, streaked
with gray. In contrast to this similarity between the two, there
is an equally strange dissimilarity. For Loving's face is a mask
whose features reproduce exactly the features of John's face--the
death mask of a John who has died with a sneer of scornful
mockery on his lips. And this mocking scorn is repeated in the
expression of the eyes which stare bleakly from behind the
mask.</i></p>

<p><i>John nervously writes a few words on a pad--then stops
abruptly and stares before him. Loving watches him.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his voice singularly toneless and cold but at the
same time insistent</i>) Surely, you don't need to make any more
notes for the second part--your hero's manhood up to the time he
(<i>a sneer comes into his voice</i>) at last finds love. I
should think you could remember that--only too well.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>mechanically</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) As for the third part, I know you
have the most vivid recollection of his terrible sin.</p>

<p>JOHN--Don't mock, damn you!</p>

<p>LOVING--So it's only in the last part that you will have to
use your imagination. How are you going to end this interesting
plot of yours? Given your hero's ridiculous conscience, what
happens then?</p>

<p>JOHN--He has the courage to confess--and she forgives.</p>

<p>LOVING--The wish is father to that thought, eh? A pretty,
sentimental ending--but a bit too pointed, don't you think? I'm
afraid she might begin to wonder--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>apprehensively</i>) Yes. That's true.</p>

<p>LOVING--I advise you to make the last part so obviously
fictitious that it will kill any suspicion which might be aroused
by what has gone before.</p>

<p>JOHN--How can I end it, then?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>after a second's pause--in a voice he tries to
make casual but which is indefinably sinister</i>) Why not have
the wife die?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts--with a shudder</i>) Damn you! What makes you
think of that?</p>

<p>LOVING--Why, nothing--except I thought you'd agreed that the
further removed from present actuality you make your ending, the
better it will be.</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes--but--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) I hope you don't suspect some
hidden, sinister purpose behind my suggestion.</p>

<p>JOHN--I don't know. I feel--(<i>then as if desperately trying
to shake off his thoughts</i>) No! I won't think of it!</p>

<p>LOVING--And I was thinking, too, that it would be interesting
to work out your hero's answer to his problem, if his wife died,
and imagine what he would do with his life then.</p>

<p>JOHN--No! Damn you, stop making me think--!</p>

<p>LOVING--Afraid to face your ghosts--even by proxy? Surely,
even you can have that much courage!</p>

<p>JOHN--It is dangerous--to call things.</p>

<p>LOVING--Still superstitious? Well, I hope you realize I'm only
trying to encourage you to make something of this plot of yours
more significant--for your soul, shall I say?--than a cowardly
trick!</p>

<p>JOHN--You know it's more than that. You know I'm doing it to
try and explain to myself, as well as to her.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) To excuse yourself to yourself,
you mean! To lie and escape admitting the obvious natural reason
for--</p>

<p>JOHN--You lie! I want to get at the real truth and understand
what was behind--what evil spirit of hate possessed me to make
me--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>contemptuously--but as he goes on a strange
defiant note of exultance comes into his voice.</i>) So it's come
back to that again, eh? Your old familiar nightmare! You poor,
damned superstitious fool! I tell you again what I have always
told you: There is nothing--nothing to hope for, nothing to
fear--neither devils nor gods--nothing at all! (<i>There is a
knock on the door at rear. John immediately pretends to be
writing. At the same time his features automatically assume the
meaninglessly affable expression which is the American business
man's welcoming poker face. Loving sits motionlessly regarding
him with scornful eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>without looking up, calls</i>) Come in. (<i>The door
in rear is half opened and William Eliot, John Loving's partner,
looks in. He is about forty, stout, with a prematurely bald head,
a round face, a humorous, good-natured mouth, small eyes behind
horn-rimmed spectacles.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--Hello, John. Busy?</p>

<p>JOHN--Foolish question, Bill.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>His eyes pass over Loving without seeing him. He
does not see him now or later. He sees and hears only John, even
when Loving speaks. And it will be so with all the characters.
They are quite unaware of Loving's existence, although at times
one or another may subtly sense his presence. Eliot comes
forward. He says jokingly</i>) You sound downhearted, John. Don't
let our little depression get you. There's always the poorhouse.
Quite cozy, too, they say. Peace for the weary--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>cuts in--mockingly</i>) There is much to be said
for peace.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>as if it were John who had spoken</i>) Yes, John,
there sure is--these damned days. (<i>then giving John a glance
of</i> <i>concern</i>) Look here. I think our troubles are
getting your nerve. You've seemed worn ragged lately. Why not
take a few days in the country?</p>

<p>JOHN--Nonsense! I'm fine. (<i>forcing a humorous tone</i>)
What, besides the poorhouse, is on your mind, Bill?</p>

<p>ELIOT--Nothing but lunch. Ate too much again, damn it. What
were you doping out when I came in? Got some new scheme for
us?</p>

<p>JOHN--No.</p>

<p>LOVING--Merely trying to work out the answer to a puzzle--a
human puzzle.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hurriedly</i>) That is, I'm playing around with a
plot for a novel that's come into my mind lately.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>with amused surprise</i>) What? Good God, don't
tell me the literary bug is biting you again? I thought you'd got
that out of your system long ago when you got engaged to Elsa and
decided to come in with me and make some money.</p>

<p>JOHN--Well, I thought I might as well do something with all
this leisure. Oh, I'll probably never write it, but it's amusing
to dope out.</p>

<p>ELIOT--Why shouldn't you write it? You certainly showed you
could write in the old days--articles, anyway. (<i>then with a
grin</i>) Why, I can remember when I couldn't pick up an
advanced-thinker organ without running into a red-hot article of
yours denouncing Capitalism or religion or something.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>smiling good-naturedly</i>) You always did have a
mean memory, Bill.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>laughs</i>) God, John, how you've changed! What
hymns of hate you used to emit against poor old Christianity!
Why, I remember one article where you actually tried to prove
that no such figure as Christ had ever existed.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his tone suddenly cold and hostile</i>) I still
feel the same on that subject.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>gives John a surprised glance</i>) Feel? Can't
understand any one having feelings any more on such a dead issue
as religion.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confused</i>) Well, to tell the truth, I haven't
given it a thought in years, but--(<i>then hurriedly</i>) But,
for Pete's sake, let's not get started on religion.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>changes the subject tactfully</i>) Tell me about
this novel of yours, John. What's it all about?</p>

<p>JOHN--Nothing to tell yet. I haven't got it finally worked
out.</p>

<p>LOVING--The most important part, that is--the end.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>in a joking tone</i>) But when I have, Bill, I'll be
only too glad to get your esteemed criticism.</p>

<p>ELIOT--That's a promise, remember--(<i>then getting up</i>)
Well, I suppose I better get back to my office. (<i>He starts for
the door--then turns back.</i>) Oh, I knew there was something
I'd forgotten to tell you. Lucy Hillman called up while you were
out.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>carelessly</i>) Yes? What did she want?</p>

<p>ELIOT--Wanted you. Got my office by mistake. She'll call up
later. It was important, she said to tell you.</p>

<p>JOHN--Her idea of important! Probably wants my advice on what
to give Walter for a birthday present.</p>

<p>ELIOT--What the devil's got into Walter lately, anyway?
Getting drunk as a pastime may have its points, but as an
exclusive occupation--Not to mention all his affairs with women.
How does Lucy stand it? But I hear she's going to pieces,
too.</p>

<p>JOHN--I don't believe it. She isn't the kind to have
affairs.</p>

<p>ELIOT--I don't mean that. I mean booze.</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh. Well, if it's true, you can hardly blame her.</p>

<p>ELIOT--There are children, aren't there? Why hasn't she the
guts to divorce him?</p>

<p>JOHN--Don't ask me. We haven't seen much of Lucy, either, for
a long time. (<i>He dismisses the subject by looking down at his
pad, as if he wanted to start writing.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>taking the hint</i>) Well, I'll move along.</p>

<p>JOHN--See you later, Bill. (<i>Eliot goes out, rear. After the
door closes behind him John speaks tensely.</i>) Why did she
phone? Important, she said. What can have happened?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>coldly</i>) Who knows? But you know very well she
can't be trusted. You'd better be prepared for any stupid folly.
And better get the end of your novel decided upon, so you can
tell your plot--before it's too late.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>tensely</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>the hidden sinister note again creeping into
his</i> <i>coldly casual tone</i>) There can be only one
sensible, logical end for your hero, after he has lost his wife
forever--that is, provided he loves her as much as he boasts to
himself he does--and if he has any honor or courage left!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>gives a start--then bitterly</i>) Ah! I see now what
you're driving at! And you talk of courage and honor!
(<i>defiantly</i>) No! He must go on! He must find a
faith--somewhere!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>an undercurrent of anger in his sneering</i>)
Somewhere, eh? Now I wonder what hides behind that somewhere? Is
it your old secret weakness--the cowardly yearning to go
back--?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>defensively</i>) I don't know what you're thinking
about.</p>

<p>LOVING--You lie! I know you! And I'll make you face it in the
end of your story--face it and kill it, finally and forever!
(<i>There is again a knock on the door and John's eyes go to his
pad. This time Eliot comes in immediately, without waiting for an
answer.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--Hello, Bill. What's up now?</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>comes forward, a twinkle in his eye</i>) John,
there's a mysterious visitor outside demanding to see you.</p>

<p>JOHN--You mean--Lucy?</p>

<p>ELIOT--Lucy? No. This is a man. He ran into me before he got
to Miss Sims and asked for you. (<i>grinning</i>) And as it's
liable to be a bitter blow, I thought I better break the news in
person.</p>

<p>JOHN--What's the joke? Who is it?</p>

<p>ELIOT--It's a priest.</p>

<p>JOHN--A priest?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>harshly</i>) I don't know any priests! Tell him to
get out!</p>

<p>ELIOT--Now don't be disrespectful. He claims he's your
uncle.</p>

<p>JOHN--My uncle? Did he give his name?</p>

<p>ELIOT--Yes. Father Baird. Said he'd just got in from the
West.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>dumbfounded--forcing a smile</i>) Well, I'll be
damned.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>laughs</i>) My God, think of you having a priest
for an uncle! That's too rich!</p>

<p>JOHN--I haven't seen him since I was a boy.</p>

<p>ELIOT--Why so scared? Afraid he's come to lecture you on your
sins?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>angrily</i>) He may be a joke to you. He's not to
me, damn him!</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>gives John a surprised, disapproving glance</i>)
Oh, come, John. Not as bad as that, is it? He struck me as a nice
old guy.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hurriedly</i>) He is. I didn't mean that. I always
liked him. He was very kind to me when I was a kid. He acted as
my guardian for a while. But I wish he'd given me warning.
(<i>then picking up the telephone</i>) Well, it's rotten to keep
him cooling his heels. Hello. Send Father Baird in.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>turning to the door</i>) I'll get out.</p>

<p>JOHN--No, as a favor, stay around until the ice is broken.
(<i>He has gotten up and is going toward the door. Loving remains
in his chair, his eyes fixed before him in a hostile stare, his
body tensed defensively.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--Sure. (<i>A knock comes on the door. John opens it and
Father Matthew Baird enters. He is seventy, about John and
Loving's height, erect, robust, with thick white hair, ruddy
complexion. There is a clear resemblance to John and Loving in
the general cast of his features and the color of his eyes. His
appearance and personality radiate health and observant
kindliness--also the confident authority of one who is accustomed
to obedience and deference--and one gets immediately from him the
sense of an unshakable inner calm and certainty, the peace of one
whose goal in life is fixed by an end beyond life.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>constrained and at the same time affectionate</i>)
Hello, Uncle! What in the world brings you--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>clasping John's hand in a strong grip</i>)
Jack! (<i>His manner is very much what it must have been when
John was a boy and he was the guardian. Deeply moved, he puts his
arm around John and gives him an affectionate hug.</i>) My dear
Jack! This is--(<i>He sees Eliot and stops, a bit
embarrassed.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>moved and embarrassed, getting away from his</i>
<i>arm</i>) I want you to meet my partner--Bill Eliot--my uncle,
Father Baird.</p>

<p>ELIOT--It's a great pleasure, Father.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>shakes his hand--a formal, old-fashioned
courtesy in his manner</i>) The pleasure is mine, Mr. Eliot. But
I feel I've had the privilege of your acquaintance already
through Jack's letters.</p>

<p>JOHN--Sit down, Uncle. (<i>He indicates the chair at right of
desk. Father Baird sits down. John sits in his chair at left.
Eliot stands by the chair at right, center.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--Well, I'll leave you two alone and pretend to be busy.
That's the hardest job we have now, Father--keeping up the
pretense of work.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--You have plenty of company, if that's any
consolation. I get the same tale of woe from every one in our
part of the country.</p>

<p>ELIOT--I'm afraid the company doesn't console a bit. They're
all too darned whiney.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>a twinkle coming into his eye</i>) Ah, who
can blame you for whining when your omnipotent Golden Calf
explodes into sawdust before your adoring eyes right at the
height of his deification? It's tragic, no other word--unless the
word be comic.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his voice a mocking sneer</i>) And what salvation
for us are you preaching? The Second Coming?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>startled, turns to stare at John. Eliot also
looks at him, surprised and disapproving of this taunt. Father
Baird says quietly, without any sign of taking offense</i>) The
First Coming is enough, Jack--for those who remember it. (<i>Then
he turns to Eliot--in a joking tone</i>) If you knew how familiar
that note sounds from him, Mr. Eliot. Here I've been feeling
strange, looking at him and seeing what a big man of affairs he'd
grown, and saying to myself, can this be my old Jack? And then he
has to go and give himself away with a strain of his old bold
whistling in the dark, and I see he's still only out of short
pants a while, as I knew him last! (<i>He gives a comic sigh of
relief.</i>) Thank you, Jack. I feel quite at home with you
now.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>immensely amused, especially at the expression of
boyish discomfiture on John's face--laughingly</i>) John, I begin
to feel sorry for you. You've picked on some one out of your
class.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>with a wink at Eliot</i>) Did you hear him
throw the word preaching in my face, Mr. Eliot--with a dirty
sneer in his voice? There's injustice for you. If you knew what a
burden he made my life for years with his preaching. Letter upon
letter--each with a soap box inclosed, so to speak. The plague
began right after I'd had to go West and leave him to his own
devices. He was about to pass out of my guardianship and go to
college with the bit of money his parents had left for him when
he reached eighteen. So I had to let him go his own way. I'd
learned it was no use fighting him, anyway. I'd done that and
found it was a great satisfaction to him and only made him worse.
And I had faith, if let alone, he'd come back to his senses in
the end.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) And how mistaken you were in that
faith!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>without turning--quietly</i>) No. The end
isn't yet, Jack. (<i>He goes on to Eliot with a renewal of his
humorously complaining tone.</i>) You wouldn't believe what a
devil's advocate he was in those days, Mr. Eliot.</p>

<p>ELIOT--You needn't tell me, Father. I was his classmate. He
organized an Atheists' Club--or tried to--and almost got fired
for it.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes, I remember his writing to boast about that.
Well, you can appreciate then what I went through, even if he
didn't write you letters.</p>

<p>ELIOT--But he delivered harangues, Father, when he could get
anybody to listen!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>pityingly</i>) Ah, that must have been
cruel, too. Mr. Eliot, I feel drawn to you. We've been through
the same frightful trials.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with a boyishly discomfited air</i>) I hope you're
having a good time, you two.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>ignoring him</i>) Not a moment's peace did
he give me. I was the heathen to him and he was bound he'd
convert me to something. First it was Atheism unadorned. Then it
was Atheism wedded to Socialism. But Socialism proved too
weak-kneed a mate, and the next I heard Atheism was living in
free love with Anarchism, with a curse by Nietzsche to bless the
union. And then came the Bolshevik dawn, and he greeted that with
unholy howls of glee and wrote me he'd found a congenial home at
last in the bosom of Karl Marx. He was particularly delighted
when he thought they'd abolished love and marriage, and he
couldn't contain himself when the news came they'd turned naughty
schoolboys and were throwing spit-balls at Almighty God and had
supplanted Him with the slave-owning State--the most grotesque
god that ever came out of Asia!</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>chuckling</i>) I recognize all this, Father. I used
to read his articles, as I was reminding him just before you
came.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Don't I know them! Didn't he send me every one
with blue pencil underlinings! But to get back to my story:
Thinks I at this juncture, well, he's run away as far as he can
get in that direction. Where will he hide himself next?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>stiffening in his chair--with angry
resentment</i>) Run away? You talk as if I were afraid of
something. Hide? Hide from what?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>without turning--quietly</i>) Don't you
know, Jack? Well, if you don't yet, you will some day. (<i>again
to Eliot</i>) I knew Communism wouldn't hold him long--and it
didn't. Soon his letters became full of pessimism, and disgust
with all sociological nostrums. Then followed a long silence. And
what do you think was his next hiding place? Religion, no
less--but as far away as he could run from home--in the defeatist
mysticism of the East. First it was China and Lao Tze that
fascinated him, but afterwards he ran on to Buddha, and his
letters for a time extolled passionless contemplation so
passionately that I had a mental view of him regarding his navel
frenziedly by the hour and making nothing of it! (<i>Eliot laughs
and John chuckles sheepishly in spite of himself. Loving stares
before him with a cold, angry disdain.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--Gosh, I'm sorry I missed that! When was all this,
Father?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--In what I'd call his middle hide-and-go-seek
period. But the next I knew, he was through with the East. It was
not for the Western soul, he decided, and he was running through
Greek philosophy and found a brief shelter in Pythagoras and
numerology. Then came a letter which revealed him bogged down in
evolutionary scientific truth again--a dyed-in-the-wool
mechanist. That was the last I heard of his peregrinations--and,
thank heaven, it was long ago. I enjoyed a long interval of peace
from his missionary zeal, until finally he wrote me he was
married. That letter was full of more ardent hymns of praise for
a mere living woman than he'd ever written before about any of
his great spiritual discoveries. And ever since then I've heard
nothing but the praises of Elsa--in which I know I'll be ready to
join after I've met her.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>his face lighting up</i>) You bet you will! We can
agree on that, at least.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>with a wink at Eliot</i>) He seems to be
fixed in his last religion. I hope so. The only constant faith
I've found in him before was his proud belief in himself as a
bold Antichrist. (<i>He gives John a side glance, half smiling
and half reproachful.</i>) Ah well, it's a rocky road, full of
twists and blind alleys, isn't it, Jack--this running away from
truth in order to find it? I mean, until the road finally turns
back toward home.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with harsh defiance</i>) You believe I--? (<i>then
sneeringly</i>) But, of course, you would read that into it.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>bursts out irritably, as if be couldn't control his
nerves</i>) But don't you think I'm about exhausted as a subject,
Uncle? I do. (<i>He gets up nervously and moves around and stands
behind Loving's chair, his hands on the back of the chair, his
face directly above Loving's masked one.</i>)</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>gives the priest an amused smile</i>) Well, I'll
get back to my office. (<i>Father Baird gets up and he shakes his
hand heartily.</i>) I hope we'll meet again, Father. Are you here
for long?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Only a few days, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>coming around to them</i>) I'll fix up something
with Elsa for the four of us, Bill--as soon as she's feeling
stronger. We won't let him run away in a few days, now we've got
him here.</p>

<p>ELIOT--Fine! See you again, then, Father. (<i>He goes toward
the door.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I hope so, Mr. Eliot. Good day to you.</p>

<p>ELIOT--(<i>with the door open, turns back with a grin</i>) I
feel it my duty, Father, to warn you that John's got writer's
itch again. He's going to give us a novel. (<i>He laughs and
closes the door behind him. John frowns and gives his uncle a
quick uneasy glance.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>indicating the chair at right, center</i>) Take that
chair, Uncle. It's more comfortable. (<i>He sits down in the
chair at right of table where Father Baird had sat, while the
priest sits in the one at right, center. Father Baird gives him a
puzzled, concerned look, as if he were trying to figure something
out. Then he speaks casually.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--A novel? Is that right, Jack?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>without looking at him</i>) Thinking of it--to pass
the time.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Then, judging from your letters, it ought to be
a love story.</p>

<p>JOHN--It is--a love story.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) About God's love for us!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly rebuking</i>) Jack! (<i>A pause of
silence. Father Baird gives John a quick glance again--then
casually</i>) If you've any appointments, don't stand on
ceremony; just shoo me out.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>turns to him shamefacedly</i>) Don't talk that way,
Uncle. You know I wouldn't--(<i>with a natural, boyishly
affectionate smile</i>) You know darned well how tickled I am to
have you here.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I hope you're half as glad as I am to see you,
Jack. (<i>He sighs.</i>) It has been a long time--too long.</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes. (<i>smiling</i>) But I'm still flabbergasted. I
never dreamed you--Why didn't you wire me you were coming?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Oh, I thought I'd surprise you. (<i>He
smiles.</i>) To tell you the truth, I confess I had a sneaking
Sherlock Holmes desire to have a good look at you before you were
expecting it.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>frowning--uneasily</i>) Why? Why should you?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Well, I suppose because, not having seen you,
I'm afraid that to me you were still the boy I'd known, and I was
still your suspicious guardian.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>relieved--with a boyish grin</i>) Oh! I see.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--And now I have seen you, I still must admit that
the gray in your hair is lost on me, and I can't get it out of my
head you're the same old Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>grinning with a boyish discomfiture</i>) Yes, and
the devil of it is you make me feel that way, too. It's an unfair
advantage, Uncle. (<i>Father Baird laughs and John joins
in.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Well, I never took unfair advantage of you in
the old days, did I?</p>

<p>JOHN--You certainly didn't. When I look back, I'm amazed you
could have been so fair. (<i>quickly--changing the subject</i>)
But you haven't told me yet how you happened to come East.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>a bit evasively</i>) Oh, I decided a
vacation was due me. And I've had a great longing for some time
to see you again.</p>

<p>JOHN--I only wish I could have you stay with us, but there's
no room. But you must have dinner with us to-night, and every
night you're here, of course.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes, I'd like to see all of you I can. But
there's this, Jack. You spoke to Mr. Eliot as if Elsa were
ill.</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh, it's nothing serious. She's just getting over the
flu, and still feels a bit low.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Then I'd better not come to-night.</p>

<p>JOHN--You better had or she'll never forgive you--or me!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Very well. I'm only too happy. (<i>A pause. He
glances at John again with a curious puzzled fixity. John catches
his eyes, is held by them for a moment, then looks away almost
furtively.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) Is that the suspicious guardian
look? I've forgotten.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>as if to himself--slowly</i>) I
feel--(<i>then suddenly</i>) There's something I want to tell
you, Jack. (<i>A stern note comes into his voice.</i>) But first
give me your word of honor there will be no cheap sneering.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stares at him, taken aback--then quietly</i>) There
won't be.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Well, it's often come to me in the past that I
shouldn't have let you get so far from me, that I might be in
part responsible for your continued estrangement from your
Faith.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with mocking scorn</i>) My faith?</p>

<p>JOHN--You know that's nonsense, Uncle.</p>

<p>LOVING--You have always nobly done your duty. You've never let
a letter pass without some pious reminder of my fall--with the
calm assurance that I would again see the light. That never
failed to make me laugh--your complacent assumption that like the
Prodigal of His fairy tale, I--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sharply</i>) Jack! You promised!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confusedly</i>) I know. I didn't mean--Go on with
what you started to tell me.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--First answer me frankly one question. Have you
been greatly troubled in spirit by anything lately?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>startled</i>) I? Why do you ask that? Of course not.
(<i>then evasively</i>) Oh, well--yes, maybe, if you mean
business worries.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Nothing else?</p>

<p>JOHN--No. What could there be?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>unconvinced--looking away</i>) The reason I
asked--You'll see in what I'm going to tell you. It happened one
night while I was praying for you in my church, as I have every
day since I left you. A strange feeling of fear took possession
of me--a feeling you were unhappy, in some great spiritual
danger. I told myself it was foolish. I'd had a letter from you
only that day, reiterating how happy you were. I tried to lose my
dread in prayer--and my guilt. Yes, I felt stricken with guilt,
too--that I was to blame for whatever was happening to you. Then,
as I prayed, suddenly as if by some will outside me, my eyes were
drawn to the Cross, to the face of Our Blessed Lord. And it was
like a miracle! His face seemed alive as a living man's would be,
but radiant with eternal life, too, especially the sad, pitying
eyes. But there was a sternness in His eyes, too, an accusation
against me--a command about you! (<i>He breaks off and gives John
a quick glance, as if afraid of finding him sneering. Then,
looking away, he adds simply</i>) That's the real reason I
decided to take my vacation in the East, Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stares at him fascinatedly</i>) You saw--?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in a bitter, sneering tone</i>) It could hardly
have been any concern for me you saw in His face--even if He did
exist or ever had existed!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sternly</i>) Jack! (<i>then, after a pause,
quietly</i>) Do you know Francis Thompson's poem--The Hound of
Heaven?</p>

<p>LOVING--I did once. Why?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quotes in a low voice but with deep
feeling</i>)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,<br>
 I am He Whom thou seekest!<br>
 Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in what is close to a snarl of scorn</i>)
Love!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>defensively</i>) I have love!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>as if he hadn't heard</i>) Why do you run
and hide from Him, as from an enemy? Take care. There comes a
time in every man's life when he must have his God for friend, or
he has no friend at all, not even himself. Who knows? Perhaps you
are on the threshold of that time now.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>uneasily</i>) What do you mean?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I don't know. It's for you to know that. You say
you have love?</p>

<p>JOHN--You know I have. Or, if you don't, you soon will after
you've met Elsa.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I'm not doubting your love for her nor hers for
you. It's exactly because I do not doubt. I am thinking that such
love needs the hope and promise of eternity to fulfill
itself--above all, to feel itself secure. Beyond the love for
each other should be the love of God, in Whose Love yours may
find the triumph over death.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) Old superstition, born of fear!
Beyond death there is nothing. That, at least, is certain--a
certainty we should be thankful for. One life is boring enough.
Do not condemn us to another. Let us rest in peace at last!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) Would you talk that way if Elsa
should die?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with a shudder</i>) For God's sake, don't speak
about--</p>

<p>LOVING--Do you think I haven't imagined her death many
times?</p>

<p>JOHN--The dread of it has haunted me ever since we were
married.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Ah.</p>

<p>LOVING--You'll see that I face it--by proxy, at least--in my
novel. (<i>a sneering taunt in his voice</i>) I think you'll be
interested in this novel, Uncle.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>staring at John, whose face is averted</i>)
It's autobiographical, then?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hastily</i>) No. Of course not. I only meant--Don't
get that idea in your head, for Pete's sake. As I explained to
Elsa, when I told her about the first part, it's really the story
of a man I once knew.</p>

<p>LOVING--The first part will particularly interest you, Uncle.
I am afraid you will be terribly shocked--especially in the light
of your recent mystic vision!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I'm very curious to hear it, Jack. When will you
tell me?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>defiantly</i>) Now!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>uneasily</i>) But no. I don't want to bore you.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--You won't bore me.</p>

<p>JOHN--No--I--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with harsh insistence</i>) The first part concerns
my hero's boyhood here in New York, up to the age of fifteen.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>Under Loving's compulsion, he picks up the thread of
the story.</i>) He was an only child. His father was a fine man.
The boy adored him. And he adored his mother even more. She was a
wonderful woman, a perfect type of our old beautiful ideal of
wife and mother.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) But there was one ridiculous
weakness in her character, an absurd obsession with religion. In
the father's, too. They were both devout Catholics. (<i>The
priest gives a swift, reproachful look at John, seems about to
protest, thinks better of it, and drops his eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>quickly</i>) But not the ignorant, bigoted sort,
please understand. No, their piety had a genuine, gentle, mystic
quality to it. Their faith was the great comforting inspiration
of their lives. And their God was One of Infinite Love--not a
stern, self-righteous Being Who condemned sinners to torment, but
a very human, lovable God Who became man for love of men and gave
His life that they might be saved from themselves. And the boy
had every reason to believe in such a Divinity of Love as the
Creator of Life. His home atmosphere was one of love. Life
<i>was</i> love for him then. And he was happy, happier than he
ever afterward--(<i>He checks himself abruptly.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>nods his head approvingly</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>JOHN--Later, at school, he learned of the God of Punishment,
and he wondered. He couldn't reconcile Him with his parents'
faith. So it didn't make much impression on him.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>bitterly</i>) Then! But afterward he had good
reason to--</p>

<p>JOHN--But then he was too sure in his faith. He grew up as
devout as his parents. He even dreamed of becoming a priest. He
used to love to kneel in the church before the Cross.</p>

<p>LOVING--Oh, he was a remarkably superstitious young fool!
(<i>His voice suddenly changes to hard bitterness.</i>) And then
when he was fifteen, all these pious illusions of his were
destroyed forever! Both his parents were killed!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hurriedly</i>) That is, they died during a flu
epidemic in which they contracted pneumonia--and he was left
alone--without love. First, his father died. The boy had prayed
with perfect faith that his father's life might be spared.</p>

<p>LOVING--But his father died! And the poor simpleton's
na&iuml;ve faith was a bit shaken, and a sinful doubt concerning
the Divine Love assailed him!</p>

<p>JOHN--Then his mother, worn out by nursing his father and by
her grief, was taken ill. And the horrible fear came to him that
she might die, too.</p>

<p>LOVING--It drove the young idiot into a panic of superstitious
remorse. He imagined her sickness was a terrible warning to him,
a punishment for the doubt inspired in him by his father's death.
(<i>with harsh bitterness</i>) His God of Love was beginning to
show Himself as a God of Vengeance, you see!</p>

<p>JOHN--But he still trusted in His Love. Surely He would not
take his mother from him, too.</p>

<p>LOVING--So the poor fool prayed and prayed and vowed his life
to piety and good works! But he began to make a condition
now--<i>if</i> his mother were spared to him!</p>

<p>JOHN--Finally he knew in his heart she was going to die. But
even then he hoped and prayed for a miracle.</p>

<p>LOVING--He abased and humbled himself before the Cross--and,
in reward for his sickening humiliation, saw that no miracle
would happen.</p>

<p>JOHN--Something snapped in him then.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>His voice suddenly takes on a tone of bitter
hatred.</i>) He saw his God as deaf and blind and merciless--a
Deity Who returned hate for love and revenged Himself upon those
who trusted Him!</p>

<p>JOHN--His mother died. And, in a frenzy of insane grief--</p>

<p>LOVING--No! In his awakened pride he cursed his God and denied
Him, and, in revenge, promised his soul to the Devil--on his
knees, when every one thought he was praying! (<i>He laughs with
malignant bitterness.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>quickly--in a casual tone</i>) And that's the end of
Part One, as I've outlined it.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>horrified</i>) Jack! I can't believe that
you--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>defensively</i>) I? What have I to do with it?
You're forgetting I explained to you--Oh, I admit there are
certain points of resemblance between some of his boyhood
experiences and mine--his parents' death, for example. But that's
only coincidence.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>recovered now--staring at him--quietly</i>)
I see.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) And please don't bring up those
coincidences before Elsa, Uncle. She didn't notice them because
I've never bored her with boyhood reminiscences. And I don't want
her to get the wrong angle on my plot.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I'll remember, Jack. When will you tell me the
rest of it?</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh, some time while you're here, maybe.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Why not to-night at your home?</p>

<p>JOHN--Well, I might--</p>

<p>LOVING--That is, if I can decide on my end before then!</p>

<p>JOHN--It would give me a chance to get your and Elsa's
criticisms at the same time. She's been wanting to hear the rest
of it, too.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>regarding him--quietly</i>) Then, by all
means. (<i>abruptly changing to a brisk casualness</i>) Well,
I'll leave you and attend to some errand I have to do. (<i>He
gets to his feet. He takes John's hand.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--Dinner is at seven-thirty. But come as long before that
as you like. I'll be home early. (<i>then with a genuine boyish
affection</i>) I want to tell you again, Uncle, how grand it is
to have you here--in spite of our arguments.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I'm not worried by our arguments. But I am about
something about you that admits of no argument--to me.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) You're wasting worry. But what
is it?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--You've written me you were happy, and I believed
you. But, now I see you, I don't believe you. You're not happy.
Why? Perhaps if you had it out with me--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) Confess, eh?</p>

<p>JOHN--Don't be foolish, Uncle. I am happy, happier than I ever
dreamed I could be. And, for heaven's sake, don't go telling Elsa
I'm unhappy!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) Very well. We'll say no more
about it. And now I'll be off. Good-bye until this evening,
Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--So long, Uncle. (<i>Father Baird goes out. John stands
by the door, looking after him--then he comes slowly back and
sits down in his chair and stares before him. Loving's eyes are
fastened on him with a cold contempt.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--Damned old fool with his bedtime tales for second
childhood about the love of God! And you--you're worse--with your
hypocritical lies about your great happiness! (<i>The telephone
on the table rings. John jumps nervously--then answers it in an
apprehensive voice.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--Hello. Who? Tell her I'm out.</p>

<p>LOVING--You'd better find out what she wants.</p>

<p>JOHN--No, wait. I'll take it. (<i>then, his voice becoming
guarded and pleasantly casual</i>) Hello, Lucy. Bill told me
you'd called. What--? (<i>He listens--then anxiety creeping into
his tone</i>) She phoned again? What about? Oh. I'm glad you
called me. Yes, she has been wondering why she hasn't heard from
you in so long. Yes, by all means, go. Yes, she's sure to be in
this afternoon. Good-bye. (<i>He hangs up mechanically.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) Your terrible sin begins to close
in on you, eh? But then, it wasn't you, was it? It was some evil
spirit that possessed you! (<i>He gives a mocking laugh--then</i>
s<i>tops abruptly and continues in his tone of cold, sinister
insistence.</i>) But enough of that nonsense. Let's return to
your plot. The wife dies--of influenza that turns into pneumonia,
let's say.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts violently--stammers</i>) What--God damn
you--what makes you choose that?</p>

<h2><i>Plot for a Novel</i> (<i>Continued</i>)</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The living-room of the Lovings' duplex apartment.
Venetian blinds soften the light from a big window at right. In
front of this window is a table with a lamp. At left, front, an
upholstered chair. At right of chair, a small table with a lamp.
At right of table, in the center of the room, a sofa. In front of
sofa, a low stand with cigarette box and ash trays. Toward right,
another chair. In the left wall is a door leading to the
dining-room. At rear of door, a writing desk. In the middle of
the rear wall is a doorway leading to the hall.</i></p>

<p><i>It is later the same afternoon.</i></p>

<p><i>Elsa enters from the hall at rear. She is thirty-five but
looks much younger. She is beautiful with that Indian Summer
renewal of physical charm which comes to a woman who loves and is
loved, particularly to one who has not found that love until
comparatively late in life. This beauty is a trifle dimmed now by
traces of recent illness. Her face is drawn and she fights
against a depressing lassitude. She wears a simple
neglig&eacute;e.</i></p>

<p><i>As she comes in, she presses a button by the door and a
buzzer is heard in the pantry. She comes forward and sits on the
sofa. A moment later Margaret, the maid, appears from the
dining-room at left. She is a middle-aged Irishwoman with a
kindly face.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>MARGARET--Yes, Madame?</p>

<p>ELSA--Hasn't the afternoon paper come yet, Margaret?</p>

<p>MARGARET--No, Madame, not yet. (<i>then with kindly
reproof</i>) Didn't you take a nap like you promised you
would?</p>

<p>ELSA--I couldn't get to sleep. But I do feel rested, so don't
begin to scold me. (<i>She smiles and Margaret smiles back, a
look of devoted affection lighting up her face.</i>)</p>

<p>MARGARET--You have to take care. The flu's a bad thing the way
it leaves you weak after. And you're only out of your bed two
days.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, I'm really quite well again. And I was too excited
to sleep. I kept thinking of Mr. Loving's uncle. (<i>The
telephone in the hall rings and Margaret goes toward the door in
rear to answer it.</i>) Heavens, I hope that isn't he now. Mr.
Loving phoned me he told him to come early. But surely he
wouldn't this early!</p>

<p>MARGARET--(<i>disappears in the hall. Her voice comes</i>)
Just a moment and I'll see if she's in. (<i>She appears again in
the doorway.</i>) It's Mrs. Hillman calling to see you,
Madame.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, I'm glad. Tell her to come right up. (<i>Margaret
disappears and is heard relaying this instruction. Then she
appears in the hall outside the doorway, waiting to answer the
door. Elsa speaks to her.</i>) I wish I didn't look so like a
sick cat. Why is it every one decides to turn up when you look
your worst?</p>

<p>MARGARET--Ah, you needn't worry, Madame. You look fine.</p>

<p>ELSA--Well, anyway, I don't mind Lucy. (<i>Nevertheless, she
goes to the desk at left, rear, takes out a vanity case, powders
her nose, etc. While she is doing this, Margaret moves to the
entrance door in the hall and is heard admitting Mrs. Hillman and
exchanging greetings with her, as she helps her off with her
things. Elsa calls</i>) Hello, Stranger.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>calls back in a voice whose breeziness rings a bit
strained</i>) That's right, sit on me the minute I set foot in
your house! Well, I know I deserve it. (<i>Elsa goes to the
doorway and meets her as she comes in, kissing her
affectionately. Lucy Hillman is about the same age as Elsa. She
is still an extremely attractive woman but, in contrast to Elsa,
her age shows, in spite of a heavy make-up. There are wrinkles
about her eyes, and her small, full, rather weak mouth is drawn
down by sharp lines at the corners. She is dressed expensively in
clothes a bit too youthful and extreme in style. She responds to
Elsa's greeting with a nervous constraint.</i>) Hello, Elsa.</p>

<p>ELSA--You're a nice one! How long has it been--months!--not
since before I went to Boston in February. (<i>She sits on the
sofa and draws Lucy down beside her.</i>)</p>

<p>LUCY--I know. I'm in the dust at your feet.</p>

<p>ELSA--I've phoned you a dozen times, but you were always out.
Or did you just tell them to say that? I've completely lost faith
in you.</p>

<p>LUCY--But I was out, Elsa. How can you think--</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>laughing--gives her a hug</i>) You're not taking me
seriously, are you? I know you'd hardly do that with me, after
all these years.</p>

<p>LUCY--Of course, I wouldn't.</p>

<p>ELSA--But I did wonder a little at your sudden complete
ignoring of our existence. So did John.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>hurriedly</i>) If you know all the stupid
engagements that pile up--and all the idiotic parties Walter lets
me in for. (<i>then changing the subject abruptly</i>) May I have
a cigarette? (<i>She takes one from the box on the stand and
lights it.</i>) Aren't you having one?</p>

<p>ELSA--Not now. (<i>She gives Lucy a puzzled glance. Lucy
avoids her eyes, nervously flipping her cigarette over the ash
tray. Elsa asks</i>) How are the kids?</p>

<p>LUCY--Oh, fine, thanks. At least, I think so, from the little
I get to see of them nowadays. (<i>Bitterness has crept into this
last. She again hurriedly changes the subject.</i>) But tell me
all your news. What have you been doing with yourself?</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, the same peaceful routine--going to a concert now
and then, reading a lot, keeping house, taking care of John.</p>

<p>LUCY--The old perfect marriage that's been the wonder of us
all, eh? (<i>again changing the subject</i>) What time does John
usually get home? I don't want to run into him.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, not for an hour or so yet. (<i>smiling</i>) But why?
What have you got against John?</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>smiling with a strange wryness</i>) Nothing--except
myself. (<i>then hurriedly</i>) I mean, look at me, I look like
hell. I've had the damndest insomnia lately. And I'm vain enough
not to crave any male viewing the wreckage until I've spruced up
on a bath and cocktails.</p>

<p>ELSA--But that's silly. You look wonderful.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>dryly</i>) Thanks, liar! (<i>with a side glance of
frank envy--unable to keep resentment out of her voice</i>) I
especially don't care to be up for inspection beside you. The
contrast is too glaring.</p>

<p>ELSA--But it's I who look like the devil, not you. I'm just
getting over flu.</p>

<p>LUCY--Flu makes no never mind. It doesn't affect--what I mean.
(<i>then with a hard flippant air</i>) Pardon me if I seem to
indulge in the melancholy jitters. I'm becoming the damndest
whiner and self-pitier. It's really too boring. (<i>She lights
another cigarette. Her hands have a nervous tremor. Elsa watches
her with a worried, affectionately pitying look.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--What is it, Lucy? Tell me.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stiffening defensively</i>) What is what?</p>

<p>ELSA--I want to know what's troubling you. Now, there's no use
denying it. I've known you too long. I felt it the moment you
came in, that you were upset about something and trying to hide
it.</p>

<p>LUCY--I don't know where you got that idea. (<i>defensively
flippant</i>) Oh, really now, Elsa. Don't you go psychic on
us!</p>

<p>ELSA--All right, then. Forgive my trying to pump you. But you
got me into the bad habit yourself, you know, by always coming to
me with your troubles. I only thought I might be able to
help.</p>

<p>LUCY--You! (<i>She gives a hard little laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>hurt</i>) You used to think I could.</p>

<p>LUCY--"Once, long ago--" (<i>then, suddenly with repentant
shamefacedness</i>) Forgive me, Elsa. I'm rotten to be flip about
that. You've been the most wonderful friend. And I'm such an
ungrateful little slut!</p>

<p>ELSA--Lucy! You mustn't say that.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>hurries on with a simulation of frankness</i>) But
honestly, you're mistaken this time. There's nothing wrong,
except what seems to be wrong with every one, the stupid lives we
lead--and, of course, the usual financial worries. So please
don't bother your head about my troubles.</p>

<p>ELSA--All right, dear. (<i>then, after a slight
pause--casually</i>) How is Walter these days?</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with a twisted smile</i>) I thought we weren't going
to talk about my troubles! Oh, Walter is--Walter. You know him,
Elsa. Why ask? But do you know any one, I wonder? Darned if I
think you ever see what people really are. You somehow manage to
live in some lost world where human beings are still decent and
honorable. I don't see how you do it. If you'd always been a
little innocent, protected from all ugly contacts--But, my God,
your first marriage must have slapped your face with about every
filthy thing a man can be--and that's plenty! Yet you sit here,
calm and beautiful and unscarred--!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>quietly</i>) I have my share of scars. But the
wounds are all healed--completely healed. John's love has done
that for me.</p>

<p>LUCY--Yes--of course. (<i>Then, as if she couldn't control
herself, she bursts out</i>) Oh, you and your John! You bring him
up as the answer to everything.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>smiling</i>) Well, he is for me.</p>

<p>LUCY--Do you mean to tell me you're as much in love with him
now as when you married him?</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, much more so, for he's become my child and father
now, as well as being a husband and--</p>

<p>LUCY--Lover. Say it. How incredibly Mid-Victorian you can be!
Don't you know that's all we married ladies discuss nowadays? But
you're lucky. Usually the men discussed aren't our husbands, and
aren't even good lovers. But never say die. We keep on hoping and
experimenting!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>repelled</i>) Don't talk in that disgusting way. I
know you don't mean a word of it.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stares at her resentfully for a second, then turns
away, reaching for another cigarette--dryly</i>) Oh, you're quite
sure of that, are you?</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>gently</i>) Lucy, what is it has made you so bitter?
I've noticed it growing on you for the past few years, but now
it's completely got you. I--honestly, I hardly know you this
time, you've changed so.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>hurriedly</i>) Oh, it's nothing that happened
lately. You mustn't get that idea. (<i>then letting herself
go--with increasing bitterness</i>) It's simply that I've grown
sick of my life, sick of all the lying and faking of it, sick of
marriage and motherhood, sick of myself! Particularly sick of
myself because I endure the humiliation of Walter's open affairs
with every damned floosie he meets! And I'm tired of pretending I
don't mind, tired of really minding underneath, tired of
pretending to myself I have to go on for the children's sakes,
and that they make up to me for everything, which they don't at
all!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>indignantly</i>) How can Walter be such a beast!</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with a look at Elsa that is almost vindictive</i>)
Oh, he's no worse than a lot of others. At least, he doesn't lie
about it.</p>

<p>ELSA--But, for heaven's sake, why do you stand it? Why don't
you leave him?</p>

<p>LUCY--Oh, don't be so superior and scornful, Elsa. I'll bet
you wouldn't--(<i>She checks herself abruptly.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--What do you mean? You know very well I left my first
husband the minute I found out--</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>hurriedly</i>) I know. I didn't--Why don't I leave
Walter? I guess because I'm too worn out to have the guts. And
then I did try it once. The first time I knew he'd been
unfaithful I did the correct thing and went home. I intended to
tell Father I was through as Walter's wife. Only Father was away.
Mother was there, and I broke down and told her. She took it
quite philosophically--said I was a fool to expect too much, men
were like that, even my father had--(<i>She gives a little shiver
of aversion.</i>) That sort of squelched me. So I went back to
Walter and he doesn't know to this day I ever left him.</p>

<p>ELSA--I'm so sorry, Lucy.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>returning to her air of hard cynicism</i>) No pity,
please. After all, the situation has its compensations. He has
tried nobly to be fair. He said I could have equal liberty to
indulge any of my sexual whims.</p>

<p>ELSA--What a stupid fool!</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>bitterly</i>) Oh, he didn't really mean it, you
know. His vanity couldn't admit I'd ever feel the slightest
desire outside of him. It was only a silly gesture he felt safe
in making because he was so damned sure of me--because he knows,
damn him, that in spite of all he's done to kill it there's still
a cowardly slavish something in me, dating back to the happiness
of our first married days, which still--loves him! (<i>She starts
to break down, but fights this back and bursts out vindictively,
a look of ugly satisfaction coming into her face</i>) But I
warned him he'd humiliate me once too often--and he did!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>shocked</i>) You mean you--</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with a return of her flippant tone</i>) Yes, I went
in for a little fleeting adultery. And I must say, as a love
substitute or even a pleasurable diversion, it's greatly
overrated. (<i>She</i> <i>gives a hard little laugh.</i>) How
horribly shocked you look! Are you going to order me from your
virtuous home?</p>

<p>ELSA--Lucy! Don't talk like that! It's only that I can't
believe--none of this is really you. That's what makes it so--But
please don't think I'm condemning you. You know how I love you,
don't you?</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stares at her with a strange panic</i>) Don't, for
God's sake! I don't want you to love me! I'd rather you hated me!
(<i>But Elsa pulls her to her and she breaks down finally,
sobbing, her face buried against Elsa's shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--There, there. You mustn't, dear. (<i>then as Lucy grows
calmer--quietly</i>) Don't think I don't understand, because I
do. I felt exactly the same when I found out about Ned Howell.
Even though I'd stopped caring for him and our marriage had
always been unhappy, my pride was so hurt I wanted to revenge
myself and take the first man I met for a lover.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>looks up in amazement</i>) You went through that? I
never dreamed--</p>

<p>ELSA--All that saved me from doing something stupid was the
faith I had that somewhere the man was waiting whom I could
really love. I felt I owed it to him and to my own self-respect
not to deliberately disfigure myself out of wounded pride and
spite.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with sad bitterness</i>) You hit it when you say
disfigure. That's how I've felt ever since. Cheap! Ugly! As if
<i>I'd</i> deliberately disfigured <i>myself.</i> And not only
myself--the man--and others I wouldn't hurt for anything in the
world--if I was in my right mind. But I wasn't! You realize I
wasn't, don't you, Elsa? You must! You above every one!</p>

<p>ELSA--I do, dear. Of course I do.</p>

<p>LUCY--I've got to tell you just how it came to happen--so
you'll see. It was one of Walter's parties. You know the would-be
Bohemian gang he likes to have. They were there in all their
vulgarity, their poisonous, envious tongues wisecracking at
everything with any decent human dignity and worth. Oh, there
were a few others there, too--our own people--this man was one of
them. Walter was drunk, pawing over his latest female, and she
got him to go home with her. Everybody watched me to see how I'd
take it. I wanted to kill him and her, but I only laughed and had
some more to drink. But I was in hell, I can tell you, and inside
I kept swearing to myself that I'd show Walter--And I picked out
this man--yes, deliberately! It was all deliberate and crazy! And
I had to do all the seducing--because he's quite happy. I knew
that, but I was crazy. His happiness filled me with rage--the
thought that he made others happy. I wanted to take his happiness
from him and kill it as mine had been killed!</p>

<p>ELSA--Lucy!</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with a hard laugh</i>) I told you I was in hell,
didn't I? You can't live there without becoming like the rest of
the crowd! (<i>hurrying on with her story</i>) I got him in my
bedroom on some excuse. But he pushed me away, as if he were
disgusted with himself and me. But I wouldn't let him go. And
then came the strange part of it. Suddenly, I don't know how to
explain it, you'll think I'm crazy, or being funny, but it was as
if he were no longer there. It was another man, a stranger whose
eyes were hateful and frightening. He seemed to look through me
at some one else, and I seemed for a moment to be watching some
hidden place in his mind where there was something as evil and
revengeful as I was. It frightened and fascinated me--and called
to me too; that's the hell of it! (<i>She forces a laugh.</i>) I
suppose all this sounds too preposterous. Well, maybe it was the
booze working. I'd had a lot. (<i>She reaches for a
cigarette--returning to her hard flippancy</i>) And then followed
my little dip into adultery.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>with a little shiver of repulsion</i>) Oh!</p>

<p>LUCY--But what a hideous bore this must be to you. Why did I
have to tell you, I wonder. It was the last thing I ever
wanted--(<i>turns on her in a flash of resentful
vindictiveness</i>) It makes me out worse than you expected, eh?
But suppose John were unfaithful to you--</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>startled--frightenedly</i>) Don't! (<i>then
indignantly</i>) Lucy! I won't have you say that, not even--</p>

<p>LUCY--I'm only asking you to suppose.</p>

<p>ELSA--I can't! I won't! And I won't let you! It's too--!
(<i>then controlling herself--forcing a smile</i>) But I'm a
bigger fool than you are to get angry. You simply don't know
John, that's all. You don't know what an old-fashioned romantic
idealist he is at heart about love and marriage. And I thank God
he is! You'll laugh at me but I know he never had a single affair
in his life before he met me.</p>

<p>LUCY--Oh, come on, Elsa. That's too much!</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, please don't think I'm a na&iuml;ve fool. I was as
cynical about men in those days as you are now. I wouldn't have
believed it of another man in the world, but with John I felt it
was absolutely true to what I knew he was like inside him.</p>

<p>LUCY--You loved him and you wanted to believe.</p>

<p>ELSA--No. Even before I loved him, I felt that. It was what
made me love him, more than anything else--the feeling that he
would be mine, only mine, that I wouldn't have to share him even
with the past. If you only could realize how much that meant to
me--especially at that time, when I was still full of the disgust
and hurt of my first marriage.</p>

<p>LUCY--Well, that's all very fine, but it's not proving to me
how you can be so certain that never since then--</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>proudly</i>) I know he loves me. I know he knows how
much I love him. He knows what that would do to me. It would kill
forever all my faith in life--all truth, all beauty, all love! I
wouldn't want to live!</p>

<p>LUCY--You shouldn't let yourself be so completely at the mercy
of any man--not even John.</p>

<p>ELSA--I'm not afraid. (<i>She smiles.</i>) The trouble with
you is, you old cynic, you can't admit that our marriage is a
real ideal marriage. But it is--and that's entirely John's work,
not mine.</p>

<p>LUCY--His work?</p>

<p>ELSA--Yes. When I first met him I thought I was through with
marriage for good. Even after I fell in love with him, I didn't
want to marry. I was afraid of marriage. I proposed quite frankly
that we should simply live together and each keep entire freedom
of action. (<i>She laughs.</i>) Oh, I was quite ultra-modern
about it! And it shocked John terribly, poor dear--in spite of
all his old radical ideas. I'm sure it almost disillusioned him
with me for life! He sternly scorned my offer. He argued with me.
How he argued--like a missionary converting a heathen! He said he
loathed the ordinary marriage as much as I did, but that the
ideal in back of marriage was a beautiful one, and he knew we
could realize that ideal.</p>

<p>LUCY--Ah, yes, the ideal! I heard a little talk about that
once, too!</p>

<p>ELSA--He said no matter if every other marriage on earth were
rotten and a lie, our love could make ours into a true
sacrament--sacrament was the word he used--a sacrament of faith
in which each of us would find the completest self-expression in
making our union a beautiful thing. (<i>She smiles lovingly.</i>)
You see, all this was what I had longed to hear the man I loved
say about the spiritual depth of his love for me--what every
woman dreams of hearing her lover say, I think.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stirring uneasily--mechanically</i>) Yes. I
know.</p>

<p>ELSA--And, of course, it blew my petty modern selfishness
right out the window. I couldn't believe he meant it at first,
but when I saw he did, that finished me. (<i>She smiles--then
with quiet pride</i>) And I think we've lived up to that ideal
ever since. I hope I have. I know he has. It was his creation,
you see.</p>

<p>LUCY--Of course he has. Of course.</p>

<p>ELSA--And our marriage has meant for us, not slavery or
boredom but freedom and harmony within ourselves--and happiness.
So we must have both lived true to it. Happiness is proof, isn't
it?</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>deeply moved--without looking at Elsa, takes her
hand and squeezes it--huskily</i>) Of course it is. Please forget
the stupid rot I've said. I was only trying to get a rise out of
you. We all know how wonderfully happy you and John are. Only
remember, the world is full of spiteful liars who would do
anything to wreck your happiness and drag you down to their
level--what I was doing. So never listen--But of course you
won't, will you? You have faith. (<i>She turns and kisses her
impulsively.</i>) God bless you--and preserve your happiness!</p>

<p>ELSA--Thank you, Lucy. That's dear of you. (<i>then
puzzledly</i>) But why should you be afraid that any one--</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>jumps to her feet nervously</i>) Only my morbidness.
I've been accused of so many rotten things I never did that I
suppose I'm hipped on the subject. (<i>then abruptly</i>) Got to
run now, Elsa--go home and get on my armor for another of
Walter's parties. It's a gay life. The only hope is he'll be so
broke before long no one will call on us but our forgotten
friends. (<i>She gives a bitter little laugh and starts to go
around the left of sofa--then, at a noise of a door opening in
the hall--nervously</i>) Isn't that some one--?</p>

<p>ELSA--It must be John. (<i>She hurries around the right of
sofa and back toward the doorway.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>calls from the hall</i>) Hello.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>going out, meets him as he appears in the hall just
beyond the doorway--kissing him</i>) Hello, darling. You're
early. I'm so glad.</p>

<p>JOHN--I thought, as I'd told Uncle to come early, I
better--(<i>He kisses her.</i>) How do you feel, dear? You look
much better.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, I'm fine, John. (<i>Lucy has remained standing by
the left corner of the sofa, in a stiff, strained attitude, the
expression on her face that of one caught in a corner, steeling
herself for an ordeal. Elsa and John come in, their arms around
each other. As they do so, Lucy recovers her poise and calls to
him</i>)</p>

<p>LUCY--Hello, John.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>coming to her, his face wearing its most cordial,
poker-faced smile</i>) Why, hello, Lucy. I thought I heard a
familiar voice when I came in. (<i>They shake hands.</i>) A
pleasant surprise. Been a long time since we've had this
pleasure. (<i>Elsa has come forward behind him. The figure of the
masked Loving appears in the doorway. During the next few
speeches he moves silently to the corner of the long table before
the window, right-front, and stands there, without looking at
them, facing front, his eyes fixed in the same cold stare, the
expression of his masked face seeming to be more than ever
sneering and sinister.</i>)</p>

<p>LUCY--Now, don't you begin on that! Elsa has already given me
hell.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>laughing</i>) And she's repented and been
forgiven.</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh, that's all right, then.</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>nervously</i>) I was just leaving. Sorry I've got to
run, John.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, you can't, now. John will think he's driven you
out.</p>

<p>LUCY--No, really, Elsa, I--</p>

<p>ELSA--You simply must keep John company for a few minutes.
Because I've got to go to the kitchen. I trust Emmy on ordinary
occasions, but when a long-lost uncle is coming to dinner, a
little personal supervision is in order. (<i>She moves toward the
dining-room at left.</i>)</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>with a note of desperation</i>) Well--but I can't
stay more than a second.</p>

<p>ELSA--I'll be back right away. (<i>She disappears through the
dining-room door. The moment she is gone, John's cordial smile
vanishes and his face takes on a tense, harried look. He is now
standing behind the right end of sofa, Lucy behind the left end.
In the pause while they wait for Elsa to get out of earshot,
Loving moves silently over until he is standing just behind John
but a step toward rear from him, facing half toward him, half
toward front.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>lowering his voice--hurriedly</i>) I hope you've
been careful and not said anything that--</p>

<p>LUCY--Might give you away? Of course, I didn't. And even if I
were rotten enough to come right out and tell her, she'd never
believe me, she has such a touching faith in you.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>wincing</i>) Don't!</p>

<p>LUCY--No. You're perfectly safe. There's only one thing I've
got to warn you about. It's nothing, really, but--</p>

<p>JOHN--What?</p>

<p>LUCY--Walter has been telling people. He has to, you see, to
keep up his pose of friendly understanding--</p>

<p>JOHN--But how does Walter know?</p>

<p>LUCY--Don't look so dismayed! He doesn't know--who it was. And
you'd be the last one he'd ever suspect.</p>

<p>JOHN--How is it he knows about you?</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>hesitates--then defiantly</i>) I told him.</p>

<p>JOHN--You told him? In God's name, why? But I know. You
couldn't resist--watching him squirm!</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stung</i>) Exactly, John. Why do you suppose I ever
did it, except for his benefit--if you want the truth.</p>

<p>JOHN--Good God, don't you think I know that? Do you imagine I
ever thought it was anything but revenge on your part?</p>

<p>LUCY--And whom were you revenging yourself on, John?--now
we're being frank.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with sinister mockery</i>) Who knows? Perhaps on
love. Perhaps, in my soul, I hate love!</p>

<p>LUCY--(<i>stares at John with frightened bewilderment</i>)
John! Now you're like--that night!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confusedly</i>) I? It wasn't I. (<i>angrily</i>)
What do you mean by saying I was revenging myself? Why should I
revenge myself on her?</p>

<p>LUCY--I don't know, John. That's a matter for your conscience.
I've got enough on my own, thank you. I must say I resent your
attitude, John. (<i>with a flippant sneer</i>) Hardly the
lover-like tone, is it?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with disgust</i>) Lover!</p>

<p>LUCY--Oh, I know. I feel the same way. But why hate me? Why
not hate yourself?</p>

<p>JOHN--As if I didn't! Good God, if you knew! (<i>then
bitterly</i>) And how long do you think you'll be able to resist
telling Walter it was I, his old friend--so you can watch him
squirm some more!</p>

<p>LUCY--John!</p>

<p>JOHN--And Walter will have to tell that to every one, too--to
live up to his pose! And then--</p>

<p>LUCY--John! You know I wouldn't, even if I hated you as you
seem to hate me. I wouldn't for Elsa's sake. Oh, I know you think
I'm a rotten liar, but I love Elsa! (<i>then brokenly</i>) Oh,
it's such a vile mess! What fools we were!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>dully</i>) Yes. (<i>bitterly again</i>) I'm sorry I
can't trust you, Lucy. I can when you're yourself. But full of
booze--I see what it will come to. I'll have to tell her myself
to save her the humiliation of hearing it through dirty
gossip!</p>

<p>LUCY--John! Oh, please don't be such a fool! Please!</p>

<p>JOHN--You think she couldn't forgive?</p>

<p>LUCY--I'm thinking of what it would do to her. Can't you
see--?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>warningly, as he hears the pantry door opening</i>)
Ssshh! (<i>quickly, raising his voice to a conversational
tone</i>) Uncle is a grand old fellow. You'll have to meet him
some time. You'd like him.</p>

<p>LUCY--I'm sure I would. (<i>then, as Elsa comes in from the
dining-room</i>) Ah, here you are. Well, I've got to fly. (<i>She
holds out her hand to John.</i>) Good-bye, John. Take care of
Elsa.</p>

<p>JOHN--Good-bye, Lucy. (<i>Elsa puts an arm around her waist
and they go back to the hall doorway.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--I'll get your things. (<i>They disappear in the hall. As
soon as they have gone, John turns and, coming around the
sofa,</i> s<i>its down on it and stares before him with hunted
eyes. Loving moves until he is standing directly behind him. He
bends over and whispers mockingly.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--I warned you it was closing in! You had better make up
your mind now to tell the rest of your novel tonight--while there
is still time!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>tensely</i>) Yes. I must.</p>

<p>LOVING--But, first, it still remains to decide what is to be
your hero's end. (<i>He gives a little jeering laugh.</i>)
Strange, isn't it, what difficult problems your little dabble in
fiction has brought up which demand a final answer! (<i>He laughs
again--then turns to face the doorway as Elsa re&euml;nters the
room. His eyes remain fixed on her as she comes forward. She
comes quietly to the right end of the sofa. John does not notice
her coming. Loving remains standing at right, rear, of
John.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--A penny for your thoughts, John. (<i>He starts. She sits
down beside him--with a smile</i>) Did I scare you?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) Don't know what's the matter
with me. I seem to have the nervous jumps lately. (<i>then
carelessly</i>) Glad to see Lucy again, were you?</p>

<p>ELSA--Yes--of course. Only she's changed so. Poor Lucy.</p>

<p>JOHN--Why poor? Oh, you mean on account of Walter's
antics?</p>

<p>ELSA--Then you know?</p>

<p>JOHN--Who doesn't? He's been making as public an ass of
himself as possible. But let's not talk about Walter. What did
you think of the big event to-day: Uncle dropping out of the
blue?</p>

<p>ELSA--It must have been a surprise for you. I'm dying to meet
him. I'm so glad he could come to-night.</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes. So am I. (<i>As if his conversation had run dry, he
falls into an uneasy silence. Elsa looks at him worriedly. Then
she nestles up close to him.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>tenderly</i>) Still love me, do you?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>takes her in his arms and kisses her--with intense
feeling</i>) You know I do! There's nothing in life I give a damn
about except your love! You know that, don't you?</p>

<p>ELSA--Yes, dear.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>avoiding her eyes now</i>) And you'll always love
me--no matter what an unworthy fool I am?</p>

<p>ELSA--Ssshh! You mustn't say things like that. It's not true.
(<i>then smiling teasingly</i>) Well, if you love me so much,
prove it by telling me.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>controlling a start</i>) Telling you what?</p>

<p>ELSA--Now, don't pretend. I know there's something that's been
troubling you for weeks--ever since I came back from Boston.</p>

<p>JOHN--No, honestly, Elsa.</p>

<p>ELSA--Something you're keeping back because you're afraid of
worrying me. So you might as well confess.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing a smile</i>) Confess? And will you
promise--to forgive?</p>

<p>ELSA--Forgive you for not wanting to worry me? Foolish
one!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hurriedly</i>) No, I was only joking. There's
nothing.</p>

<p>ELSA--Now! But I think I can guess. It's about business, isn't
it?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>grasps at this</i>) Well--yes, if you must know.</p>

<p>ELSA--And you were afraid that would upset me? Oh, John,
you're such a child at times you ought to be spanked. You must
think I've become a poor, helpless doll!</p>

<p>JOHN--No, but--</p>

<p>ELSA--Just because you've pampered me so terribly the past few
years! But remember, we had barely enough to get along on when we
were married--and I didn't appear so terribly unhappy then, did
I? And no matter how poor we become, do you think it would ever
really matter one bit to me as long as I had you?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stammers miserably</i>) Sweetheart! You make me
feel--so damned ashamed! God, I can't tell you!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>kissing him</i>) But, darling, it's nothing! And now
promise me you'll forget it and not worry any more?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes.</p>

<p>ELSA--Good! Let's talk of something else. Tell me, have you
been doing anything more on the rest of your idea for a
novel?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes, I--I've got most of it thought out.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>encouragingly</i>) That's splendid. You just put
your mind on that and forget your silly worries. But when am I
going to hear it?</p>

<p>JOHN--Well, I told Uncle the first part and he was curious,
too. So I threatened him I might give you both an outline of the
rest to-night.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, that's fine. (<i>Then she laughs.</i>) And I'll
confess it will be a great aid to me as a hostess. I'll probably
feel a bit self-conscious, entertaining a strange priest-uncle
for the first time.</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh, you won't be with him a minute before you'll feel
he's an old friend.</p>

<p>ELSA--Well, that sounds encouraging. But you tell your story
just the same. (<i>She gets up.</i>) It must be getting on. I'd
better go up and start getting dressed. (<i>She goes around the
left end of the sofa and back toward the hall door.</i>) Are you
going up to your study for a while?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes, in a minute. I want to do a little more work on my
plot. The end isn't clearly worked out yet.</p>

<p>LOVING--That is, my hero's end!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>smiling at John encouragingly</i>) Then you get
busy, by all means, so you'll have no excuse! (<i>She goes out.
As soon as she is gone, John's expression changes and becomes
tense and hunted again. Loving remains standing behind him,
staring down at him with cold, scornful eyes. There is a pause of
silence.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>suddenly--his face full of the bitterest, tortured
self-loathing--aloud to himself</i>) You God-damned rotten
swine!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) Yes, unfit to live. Quite unfit for
life, I think. But there is always death to wash one's sins
away--sleep, untroubled by Love's betraying dream! (<i>He gives a
low, sinister laugh.</i>) Merely a consoling reminder--in case
you've forgotten! (<i>John listens fascinatedly, as if to an
inner voice. Then a look of terror comes into his face and he
shudders.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>torturedly</i>) For God's sake! Leave me alone!</p>

<h1><a name="s301">SCENE I</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The living-room again. It is immediately after
dinner. Father Baird is sitting in the chair at left, front, Elsa
on the sofa, John beside her on her left, the masked Loving at
right, rear, of John, in the chair by the end of the table before
the window. John and Loving are in dinner clothes of identical
cut. Elsa wears a white evening gown of extremely simple lines.
Father Baird is the same as in Act One.</i></p>

<p><i>Margaret is serving them the after-dinner coffee. She goes
out through the dining-room door.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>puts an arm around Elsa's waist playfully</i>) Well,
now you've got to know her, what do you think of her, Uncle?
Weren't my letters right?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>gallantly</i>) They were much too feeble.
You didn't do her justice by half!</p>

<p>ELSA--Thank you, Father. It's so kind of you to say that.</p>

<p>JOHN--Ah! I told you that was one subject we'd agree on!
(<i>then to Elsa in a tenderly chiding tone</i>) But I've got a
bone to pick with you, my lady. You ate hardly any dinner, do you
know it?</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, but I did, dear.</p>

<p>JOHN--No, you only went through the motions. I was watching
you. That's no way to get back your strength.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes, you need all the nourishment you can take
when you're getting over the flu.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>worriedly--grasping her hand</i>) Sure you're warm
enough? Want me to get you something to put over your
shoulders?</p>

<p>ELSA--No, dear, thank you.</p>

<p>JOHN--Remember it's a rotten, chilly, rainy day out and even
indoors you can't be too careful.</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, but I'm quite all right now, John. Please don't
worry about me.</p>

<p>JOHN--Well, don't let yourself get tired now, you hear? If you
find yourself feeling at all worn-out, you just send Uncle and me
off to my study. He'll understand. Won't you, Uncle?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Of course. I hope Elsa will feel I'm one of the
family and treat me without ceremony.</p>

<p>ELSA--I do feel that, Father. (<i>then teasingly</i>) But do
you know what I think is behind all this solicitude of John's?
He's simply looking for an excuse to get out of telling us the
rest of his novel. But we won't let him back out, will we?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Indeed we won't.</p>

<p>ELSA--The first part is so unusual and interesting. Don't you
think so, Father?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) Yes. Tragic and revealing to
me.</p>

<p>ELSA--You see, John, it's no use. We're simply going to
insist.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>coldly mocking</i>) You're sure--you insist?</p>

<p>ELSA--Of course I do. So come on.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>nervously</i>) Well--(<i>He hesitates--gulps down
the rest of his coffee.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>smiling</i>) I never saw you so flustered before,
John. You'd think you were going to address an audience of
literary critics.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>begins jerkily</i>) Well--But before I start,
there's one thing I want to impress on you both again. My plot,
up to the last part, which is wholly imaginary, is taken from
life. It's the story of a man I once knew.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) Or thought I knew.</p>

<p>ELSA--May I be inquisitive? Did I ever know the man?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>a hostile, repellent note in his voice</i>) No. I
can swear to that. You have never known him.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>taken aback, gives John a wondering look--then
apologetically</i>) I'm sorry I butted in with a silly question.
Go on, dear.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>nervously--forcing a laugh</i>) I--It's hard getting
started. (<i>He turns and reaches for his coffee, forgetting he
has drunk it--sets the cup down again abruptly and goes on
hurriedly.</i>) Well, you will remember my first part ended when
the boy's parents had died.</p>

<p>LOVING--And he had denied all his old superstitions!</p>

<p>JOHN--Well, as you can imagine, for a long while after their
deaths, he went through a terrific inner conflict. He was seized
by fits of terror, in which he felt he really had given his soul
to some evil power. He would feel a tortured longing to pray and
beg for forgiveness. It seemed to him that he had forsworn all
love forever--and was cursed. At these times he wanted only to
die. Once he even took his father's revolver--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) But he was afraid to face death.
He was still too religious-minded, you see, to accept the one
beautiful, comforting truth of life: that death is final release,
the warm, dark peace of annihilation.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) I cannot see the beauty and
comfort.</p>

<p>LOVING--He often regretted afterwards he had not had the
courage to die then. It would have saved him so much silly
romantic pursuit of meaningless illusions.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>uneasily</i>) Oh, you mustn't talk that way, John.
It sounds so bitter--and false--coming from you.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confusedly</i>) I--I didn't--You forget I'm simply
following what this man told me. (<i>hurrying on</i>) Well,
finally, he came out of this period of black despair. He taught
himself to take a rationalistic attitude. He read all sorts of
scientific books. He ended up by becoming an atheist. But his
experience had left an indelible scar on his spirit. There always
remained something in him that felt itself damned by life, damned
with distrust, cursed with the inability ever to reach a lasting
belief in any faith, damned by a fear of the lie hiding behind
the mask of truth.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Ah!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) So romantic, you see--to think of
himself as possessed by a damned soul!</p>

<p>JOHN--And in after years, even at the height of his
rationalism, he never could explain away a horror of death--and a
strange fascination it had for him. And coupled with this was a
dread of life--as if he constantly sensed a malignant Spirit
hiding behind life, waiting to catch men at its mercy, in their
hour of secure happiness--Something that hated life!--Something
that laughed with mocking scorn! (<i>He stares before him with a
fascinated dread, as if he saw this Something before him. Then,
suddenly, as if in reply, Loving gives a little mocking laugh,
barely audible. John shudders. Elsa and Father Baird start and
stare at John uneasily, but he is looking straight ahead and they
turn away again.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--A credulous, religious-minded fool, as I've pointed
out! And he carried his credulity into the next period of his
life, where he believed in one social or philosophical Ism after
another, always on the trail of Truth! He was never courageous
enough to face what he really knew was true, that there is no
truth for men, that human life is unimportant and meaningless.
No. He was always grasping at some absurd new faith to find an
excuse for going on!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>proudly</i>) And he did go on! And he found his
truth at last--in love, where he least expected he ever would
find it. For he had always been afraid of love. And when he met
the woman who afterwards became his wife and realized he was in
love with her, it threw him into a panic of fear. He wanted to
run away from her--but found he couldn't.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>scornfully</i>) So he weakly surrendered--and
immediately began building a new superstition of love around
her.</p>

<p>JOHN--He was happy again for the first time since his parents'
death--to his bewildered joy.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) And secret fear!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>gives John a curious, uneasy glance</i>) Secret
fear?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes, he--he came to be afraid of his happiness. His love
made him feel at the mercy of that mocking Something he dreaded.
And the more peace and security he found in his wife's love, the
more he was haunted by fits of horrible foreboding--the recurrent
dread that she might die and he would be left alone again,
without love. So great was the force of this obsession at times
that he felt caught in a trap, desperate--</p>

<p>LOVING--And he often found himself regretting--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hastily</i>) Against his will--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>inexorably</i>) That he had again let love put him
at the mercy of life!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hurriedly</i>) But, of course, he realized this was
all morbid and ridiculous--for wasn't he happier than he had ever
dreamed he could be again?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with gloating mockery</i>) And so he deliberately
destroyed that happiness!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>startledly</i>) Destroyed his happiness? How,
John?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>turns to her, forcing a smile</i>) I'm afraid you
will find this part of his story hard to believe, Elsa. This
damned fool, who loved his wife more than anything else in life,
was unfaithful to her. (<i>Father Baird starts and stares at him
with a shocked expression.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) It is--hard to believe. But this
part is all the story of the man you knew, isn't it?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes, of course, and you mustn't condemn him entirely
until you've heard how it came to happen. (<i>He turns away from
her again--jerkily</i>) His wife had gone away. It was the first
time. He felt lost without her--fearful, disintegrated. His
familiar dread seized him. He began imagining all sorts of
catastrophes. Horrible pictures formed in his mind. She was run
over by a car. Or she had caught pneumonia and lay dying. Every
day these evil visions possessed him. He tried to escape them in
work. He couldn't. (<i>He pauses for a second, nerving himself to
go on. Then starts again.</i>) Then one night an old friend
called--to drag him off to a party. He loathed such affairs
usually, but this time he thought it would help him to escape
himself for a while. So he went. He observed with disgust how his
friend, who was drunk, was pawing over some woman right under the
nose of his wife. He knew that this friend was continually having
affairs of this sort and that his wife was aware of it. He had
often wondered if she cared, and he was curious now to watch her
reactions. And very soon he had an example of what her pride had
to endure, for the husband went off openly with his lady. The man
felt a great sympathy for her--and, as if she guessed his
thought, she came to him, and he overdid himself in being kind.
(<i>He gives a short bitter laugh.</i>) A great mistake! For she
reacted to it in a way that at first shocked him but ended up in
arousing his curiosity. He had known her for years. It wasn't
like her. It fascinated him, in a way, that she should have
become so corrupted. He became interested to see how far she
would go with it--purely as an observer, he thought--the poor
idiot! (<i>He laughs again. Father Baird has remained motionless,
his eyes on the floor. Elsa's face is pale and set, her eyes have
a bewildered, stricken look. John goes on.</i>) Remember, all
this time he saw through her; he laughed to himself at her crude
vamping; he felt he was only playing a game. Just as he knew she
was playing a game; that it was no desire for him but hatred for
her husband that inspired her. (<i>He gives a short contemptuous
laugh again.</i>) Oh, he had it all analyzed quite correctly,
considering the known elements. It was the unknown--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>without raising his head</i>) Yes. (<i>He
casts a quick glance at Elsa, then looks as quickly away. Her
eyes are fastened on the floor now. Her face has frozen into a
mask with the tense effort she is making not to give herself
away.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--He had not the slightest desire for this woman. When she
threw herself into his arms, he was repelled. He determined to
end the game. He thought of his wife--(<i>He forces a laugh.</i>)
But, as I've said, there was the unknown to reckon with. At the
thought of his wife, suddenly it was as if something outside him,
a hidden spirit of evil, took possession of him.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>coldly vindictive now</i>) That is, he saw clearly
that this situation was the climax of a long death struggle
between his wife and him. The woman with him counted only as a
means. He saw that underneath all his hypocritical pretenses he
really hated love. He wanted to deliver himself from its power
and be free again. He wanted to kill it!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>with horrified pain</i>) Oh! (<i>trying to control
herself</i>) I--I don't understand. He hated love? He wanted to
kill it? But that's--too horrible!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stammers confusedly</i>) No--I--Don't you see it
wasn't he?</p>

<p>LOVING--But, I'm afraid, Elsa, that my hero's silly idea that
he was possessed by a demon must strike you as an incredible
superstitious excuse to lie out of his responsibility.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>without lifting his eyes--quietly</i>) Quite
credible to me, Jack. One may not give one's soul to a devil of
hate--and remain forever scatheless.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) As for the adultery itself, the
truth is that this poor fool was making a great fuss about
nothing--an act as meaningless as that of one fly with another,
of equal importance to life!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>stares at John as if he had become a stranger--a
look of sick repulsion coming over her face</i>) John! You're
disgusting! (<i>She shrinks away from him to the end of the sofa
near Father Baird.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stammers confusedly</i>) But I--I didn't
mean--forgive me. I only said that--as a joke--to get a rise out
of Uncle.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>gives a quick anxious look at Elsa--then
quietly, an undercurrent of sternness in his voice</i>) I don't
think it's a joke. But go on with your story, Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>forcing himself to go on</i>) Well I--I know you can
imagine the hell he went through from the moment he came to
himself and realized the vileness he had been guilty of. He
couldn't forgive himself--and that's what his whole being now
cried out for--forgiveness!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) I can well believe that,
Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--He wanted to tell his wife and beg for forgiveness--but
he was afraid of losing her love. (<i>He gives a quick glance at
Elsa, as if to catch her reaction to this, but she is staring
straight before her with a still, set face. He forces a smile and
adopts a joking tone.</i>) And here's where I'd like to have your
opinion, Elsa. The question doesn't come up in my story, as
you'll see, but--Could his wife have forgiven him, do you
think?</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>starts--then tensely</i>) You want me to put myself
in the wife's place?</p>

<p>JOHN--Yes. I want to see whether the man was a fool or not--in
his fear.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>after a second's pause--tensely</i>) No. She could
never forgive him.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>desperately</i>) But it wasn't he! Can't you
see--</p>

<p>ELSA--No. I'm afraid--I can't see.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>dully now</i>) Yes. That's what I thought you'd
say.</p>

<p>ELSA--But what does it matter what I think? You said the
question of her forgiving doesn't come up in your novel.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>coldly</i>) Not while the wife is alive.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>dully</i>) He never tells her.</p>

<p>LOVING--She becomes seriously ill.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>with a start</i>) Oh.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in a cold voice, as if he were pronouncing a death
sentence</i>) Flu, which turns into pneumonia. And she dies.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>frightenedly now</i>) Dies?</p>

<p>LOVING--Yes. I need her death for my end. (<i>then in a
sinister, jeering tone</i>) That is, to make my romantic hero
come finally to a rational conclusion about his life!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>stares before her, not seeming to have heard this
last--her eyes full of a strange, horrified fascination--as if
she were talking aloud to herself</i>) So she dies.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>after a worried glance at her--an
undercurrent of warning in his quiet tone</i>) I think you've
tired Elsa out with your sensational imaginings, Jack. I'd spare
her, for the present, at least, the fog of gloom your novel is
plunging into.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>grasps at this--tensely</i>) Yes, I'm afraid it has
been too exciting--I really don't feel up to--During dinner I
began to get a headache and it's splitting now.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>gets up--worriedly</i>) But why didn't you tell me?
If I'd known that, I'd never have bored you with my damned
plot.</p>

<p>ELSA--I--I think I'll lie down here on the sofa--and take some
aspirin--and rest for a while. You can go with your uncle up to
your study--and tell him the rest of your story there.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>gets up</i>) An excellent idea. Come on,
Jack, and give your poor wife a respite from the horrors of
authorship. (<i>He goes to the doorway in rear.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>comes to Elsa. As he does so, Loving comes and
stands behind her, at rear of sofa.</i>) I'm so darned sorry,
Elsa, if I've--</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, please! It's only a headache.</p>

<p>JOHN--You--you don't feel really sick, do you, dearest? (<i>He
puts a hand to her forehead timidly.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>shrinks from his touch</i>) No, no, it's
nothing.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>slowly, in his cold tone with its undercurrent of
sinister hidden meaning</i>) You must be very careful, Elsa.
Remember it's cold and raining out.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>staring before her strangely--repeats
fascinatedly</i>) It's raining?</p>

<p>LOVING--Yes.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stammers confusedly</i>) Yes, you--you must be
careful, dearest.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>from the doorway in rear--sharply</i>) Come
along, Jack! (<i>John goes back to him and Loving follows John.
Father Baird goes into the hall, turning left to go upstairs to
the study. John stops in the doorway and looks back for a moment
at Elsa frightenedly. Loving comes to his side and also stops and
looks at her, his eyes cold and remorseless in his mask of
sinister mockery. They stand there for a moment side by side.
Then John turns and disappears in the hall toward left, following
Father Baird. Loving remains, his gaze concentrated on the back
of Elsa's head with a cruel, implacable intensity. She is still
staring before her with the same strange fascinated dread. Then,
as if in obedience to his will, she rises slowly to her feet and
walks slowly and woodenly back past him and disappears in the
hall, turning right toward the entrance door to the apartment.
For a second Loving remains looking after her. Then he turns and
disappears in the hall toward left, following Father Baird and
John to the study.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="s302">SCENE II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>John Loving's study on the upper floor of the
apartment. At left, front, is a door leading into Elsa's bedroom.
Bookcases extend along the rear and right walls. There is a door
to the upper hall at rear, right. A long table with a lamp is at
center, front. At left of table is a chair. In front of table a
similar chair. At right, front, is a chaise-longue, facing
left.</i></p>

<p><i>Father Baird, John and Loving are discovered. The priest is
sitting on the chaise-longue, John in the chair at front of
table, Loving in the chair at left of table. Father Baird sits in
the same attitude as he had in the previous scene, his eyes on
the floor, his expression sad and a bit stern. Loving's masked
face stares at John, his eyes cold and still. John is talking in
a strained tone, monotonously, insistently. It is as if he were
determinedly talking to keep himself from thinking.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOHN--I listen to people talking about this universal
breakdown we are in and I marvel at their stupid cowardice. It is
so obvious that they deliberately cheat themselves because their
fear of change won't let them face the truth. They don't want to
understand what has happened to them. All they want is to start
the merry-go-round of blind greed all over again. They no longer
know what they want this country to be, what they want it to
become, where they want it to go. It has lost all meaning for
them except as a pig-wallow. And so their lives as citizens have
no beginnings, no ends. They have lost the ideal of the Land of
the Free. Freedom demands initiative, courage, the need to decide
what life must mean to oneself. To them, that is terror. They
explain away their spiritual cowardice by whining that the time
for individualism is past, when it is their courage to possess
their own souls which is dead--and stinking! No, they don't want
to be free. Slavery means security--of a kind, the only kind they
have courage for. It means they need not think. They have only to
obey orders from owners who are, in turn, their slaves!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>breaks in--with bored scorn</i>) But I'm
denouncing from my old soap box again. It's all silly twaddle, of
course. Freedom was merely our romantic delusion. We know better
now. We know we are all the slaves of meaningless
chance--electricity or something, which whirls us--on to
Hercules!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with a proud assertiveness</i>) But, in spite of
that, I say: Very well! On to Hercules! Let us face that! Once we
have accepted it without evasion, we can begin to create new
goals for ourselves, ends for our days! A new discipline for life
will spring into being, a new will and power to live, a new ideal
to measure the value of our lives by!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) What? Am I drooling on about my old
social ideals again? Sorry to bore you, Uncle.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly, without looking up</i>) You are not
boring me, Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>an idealistic exaltation coming into his voice</i>)
We need a new leader who will teach us that ideal, who by his
life will exemplify it and make it a living truth for us--a man
who will prove that man's fleeting life in time and space can be
noble. We need, above all, to learn again to believe in the
possibility of nobility of spirit in ourselves! A new savior must
be born who will reveal to us how we can be saved from ourselves,
so that we can be free of the past and inherit the future and not
perish by it!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) Must sound like my old letters to
you, Uncle. It's more nonsense, of course. But there are times of
stress and flight when one hides in any old empty barrel!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>ignoring this--quietly</i>) You are
forgetting that men have such a Savior, Jack. All they need is to
remember Him.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>slowly</i>) Yes, perhaps if we could again have
faith in--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>harshly</i>) No! We have passed beyond gods! There
can be no going back!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Jack! Take care!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly again</i>) But, on the other hand, I'll
grant you the pseudo-Nietzschean savior I just evoked out of my
past is an equally futile ghost. Even if he came, we'd only send
him to the insane asylum for teaching that we should have a
nobler aim for our lives than getting all four feet in a trough
of swill! (<i>He laughs sardonically.</i>) How could we consider
such an unpatriotic idea as anything but insane, eh? (<i>There is
a pause. Father Baird looks up and studies John's face
searchingly, hopefully.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>finally speaks quietly</i>) Jack, ever since
we came upstairs, I've listened patiently while you've discussed
every subject under the sun except the one I know is really on
your mind.</p>

<p>JOHN--I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--The end of your story.</p>

<p>JOHN--Oh, forget that. I'm sick of the damned thing--now, at
any rate.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Sick of the damned thing, yes. That's why I feel
it's important you tell it--now. This man's wife dies, you said.
(<i>He stares fixedly at John now and adds slowly</i>) Of
influenza which turns into pneumonia.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>uneasily</i>) Why do you stare like that?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>dropping his eyes--quietly</i>) Go on with
your story.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>hesitantly</i>) Well--I--You can imagine the anguish
he feels after his wife's death--the guilt which tortures him a
thousandfold now she is dead.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I can well imagine it, Jack.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) And under the influence of his
ridiculous guilty conscience, all the superstitions of his
childhood, which he had prided himself his reason had killed,
return to plague him. He feels at times an absurd impulse to
pray. He fights this nonsense back. He analyzes it rationally. He
sees it clearly as a throwback to boyhood experiences. But, in
spite of himself, that cowardly something in him he despises as
superstition seduces his reason with the old pathetic lie of
survival after death. He begins to believe his wife is alive in
some mythical hereafter!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>strangely</i>) He knows she knows of his sin now. He
can hear her promising to forgive if he can only believe again in
his old God of Love, and seek her through Him. She will be beside
him in spirit in this life, and at his death she will be waiting.
Death will not be an end but a new beginning, a reunion with her
in which their love will go on forever within the eternal peace
and love of God! (<i>His voice has taken on a note of intense
longing.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Ah, then you do see, Jack! Thank God!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>as if he hadn't heard</i>) One night when he is
hounded beyond endurance he rushes out--in the hope that if he
walks himself into exhaustion he may be able to sleep for a while
and forget. (<i>strangely, staring before him, as if he were
visualizing the scene he is describing</i>) Without his knowing
how he got there, he finds he has walked in a circle and is
standing before the old church, not far from where he now lives,
in which he used to pray as a boy.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>jeeringly</i>) And now we come to the great
temptation scene, in which he finally confronts his ghosts!
(<i>with harsh defiance</i>) The church challenges him--and he
accepts the challenge and goes in!</p>

<p>JOHN--He finds himself kneeling at the foot of the Cross. And
he feels he is forgiven, and the old comforting peace and
security and joy steal back into his heart! (<i>He hesitates, as
if reluctant to go on, as if this were the end.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>deeply moved</i>) And that is your end?
Thank God!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>jeeringly</i>) I'm afraid your rejoicing is a bit
premature--for this cowardly giving in to his weakness is not the
end! Even while he is kneeling, there is a mocking rational
something in him that laughs with scorn--and at the last moment
his will and pride revive in him again! He sees clearly by the
light of reason the degradation of his pitiable surrender to old
ghostly comforts--and he rejects them! (<i>His voice with
surprising suddenness takes on a savage vindictive quality.</i>)
He curses his God again as he had when a boy! He defies Him
finally! He--!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sternly</i>) Jack! Take care!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>protests confusedly</i>) No--that's not
right--I--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>strangely confused in his turn--hurriedly</i>)
Pardon me, Uncle. Of course, that's wrong--afraid for a moment I
let an author's craving for a dramatic moment run away with my
sane judgment. Naturally, he could never be so stupid as to curse
what he knew didn't exist!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>despondently</i>) No. He realizes he can never
believe in his lost faith again. He walks out of the
church--without love forever now--but daring to face his eternal
loss and hopelessness, to accept it as his fate and go on with
life.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>mockingly</i>) A very, very heroic end, as you
see! But, unfortunately, absolutely meaningless!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes. Meaningless. I'm glad you see that.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>rousing a bit--defensively</i>) No--I take that
back--it isn't meaningless. It is man's duty to life to go
on!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>jeeringly</i>) The romantic idealist again speaks!
On to Hercules! What an inspiring slogan! (<i>then a sinister
note coming into his voice</i>) But there is still another end to
my story--the one sensible happy end!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>as if he hadn't heard this last</i>) Jack!
Are you so blind you cannot see what your imagining his finding
peace in the church reveals about the longing of your own
soul--the salvation from yourself it holds out to you? Why, if
you had any honesty with yourself, you would get down on your
knees now and--</p>

<p>LOVING--Rot! How can you believe such childish
superstition!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>angrily</i>) Jack! I've endured all I can of
your blasphemous insults to--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confused--hurriedly</i>) I--I didn't mean--I'm
sorry, Uncle. But it's only a story. Don't take it so
seriously.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>has immediately controlled
himself--quietly</i>) Only a story, Jack? You're sure you still
want me to believe that?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>defensively</i>) Why, what else could you believe?
Do you think I--? (<i>then in an abrupt, angry tone</i>) But
that's enough about the damned story. I don't want to talk any
more about it! (<i>Father Baird stares at him but keeps silent.
John starts to pace up and down with nervous restlessness--then
stops abruptly.</i>) I--if you'll excuse me--I think I'll go down
and see how Elsa is. (<i>He goes back toward the door. Loving
follows him.</i>) I'll be right back.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>quietly</i>) Of course, Jack. Don't bother
about me. I'll take a look at your library. (<i>He gets up. John
goes out. Loving turns for a moment to Father Baird, his eyes
full of a mocking derision. Then he turns and follows John.
Father Baird goes to the bookcase at right and runs his eyes over
the titles of books. But he only does this mechanically. His mind
is preoccupied, his expression sad and troubled. John's voice can
be heard from below calling</i> "Elsa." <i>Father Baird starts
and listens. Then from Elsa's bedroom John's voice is heard, as
he looks for her there. He calls anxiously</i> "Elsa"--<i>then
evidently hurries out again, closing the door behind him. Father
Baird's face grows more worried. He goes to the doorway in rear
and stands listening to a brief conversation from below. A moment
later John comes in from rear. He is making a great effort to
conceal a feeling of dread. He comes forward. Loving follows
silently but stops and remains standing by the bookcase at left
of doorway.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--She's--gone out.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Gone out? But it's still raining, isn't it?</p>

<p>JOHN--Pouring. I--I can't understand. It's a crazy thing for
her to do when she's just getting over--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>with an involuntary start</i>) Ah!</p>

<p>JOHN--What?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Nothing.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>frightenedly</i>) I can't imagine--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--How long has she been gone?</p>

<p>JOHN--I don't know. Margaret says she heard some one go out
right after we came upstairs.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>with lowered voice to himself</i>) My fault,
God forgive me. I had a feeling then I shouldn't leave her.
(<i>John sinks down in the chair by the table and waits
tensely--then suddenly he bursts out</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--I never should have told her the story! I'm a God-damned
fool.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sternly</i>) You would be more honest with
yourself if you said a self-damned fool! (<i>hearing a sound from
below</i>) There. Isn't that some one now? (<i>John stops for a
second to listen, then hurries to the door in rear. Loving
remains where he is, standing motionlessly by the
bookcase.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>calls</i>) Is that you, Elsa?</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>from downstairs--hurriedly</i>) Yes. Don't come
down. I'm coming up. (<i>A moment later she appears in the
hallway.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--Darling! I've been so damned worried. (<i>He starts to
take her in his arms.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--Please! (<i>She wards him off and steps past him into
the study. She has taken off her coat and hat downstairs, but the
lower part of her skirt and her stockings and shoes are soaking
wet. Her face is pinched and drawn and pale, with flushed spots
over the cheek bones, and her eyes are bright and hard. Father
Baird stares at her searchingly, his face sad and
pitying.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>forcing a light tone--as she comes
forward</i>) Well! You have given us a scare, my lady.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>tensely</i>) I'm sorry, Father.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Your husband was half out of his mind worrying
what had happened to you. (<i>She sits in the chair in front of
table. John stands at right of her. Loving has come up and stands
by the right end of table, at right, rear, of John. His eyes are
fixed on Elsa's face with an eager, sinister intentness.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with increasing uneasiness</i>) Elsa! You look sick.
Do you feel--?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--I'll get her some whisky. And you make her go to
bed at once. (<i>He goes out the door in rear.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>grabbing her hands</i>) Your hands are like ice!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>pulls them away from him--coldly, without looking at
him</i>) It's chilly out.</p>

<p>JOHN--Look at your shoes! They're soaked!</p>

<p>ELSA--It doesn't matter, does it? (<i>A chill runs through her
body.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--You've taken a chill. (<i>then forcing a tenderly
bullying tone</i>) You'll go right to bed, that's what. And no
nonsense about it, you hear!</p>

<p>ELSA--Are you trying the bossy tender husband on me, John? I'm
afraid that's no longer effective.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>guiltily</i>) Why do you say that?</p>

<p>ELSA--Are you determined to act out this farce to the end?</p>

<p>JOHN--I--I don't know what you mean. What makes you look at
me--as if you hated me?</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>bitterly</i>) Hate you? No, I only hate myself for
having been such a fool! (<i>then with a hard, mocking tone</i>)
Shall I tell you where I went, and why? But perhaps I'd better
put it in the form of a novel plot!</p>

<p>JOHN--I--I don't know what you're driving at.</p>

<p>ELSA--I went out because I thought I'd like to drop in on one
of Lucy's parties. But it wasn't exciting--hardly any adultery
going on--I had no opportunity--even if I'd been seized by any
peculiar impulse of hatred and revenge on you. So I came home.
(<i>She forces a hard, bitter laugh.</i>) There! Are you
satisfied? It's all a lie, of course. I simply went for a walk.
But so is your story about the novel a lie.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stunned--stammers</i>) Elsa, I--</p>

<p>ELSA--For God's sake, John, don't lie to me any more or I--I
know, I tell you! Lucy told me all about it this afternoon.</p>

<p>JOHN--She told you? The damned--</p>

<p>ELSA--Oh, she didn't tell me it was you. But she gave me all
the sordid details and they were the same as those in your story.
So it was you who told on yourself. Rather a joke on you, isn't
it? (<i>She laughs bitterly.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--I--(<i>He blurts out miserably</i>) Yes--it's true.</p>

<p>ELSA--And it was a fine joke on me, her coming here. You would
appreciate it, if you had seen how I sympathized with her, how I
excused her to myself and pitied her. And all the while, she was
pitying me! She was gloating! She's always envied us our
happiness. Our happiness!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>writhing</i>) Don't!</p>

<p>ELSA--She must have been laughing at me for a fool, sneering
to herself about my stupid faith in you. And you gave her that
chance--you! You made our love a smutty joke for her and every
one like her--you whom I loved so! And all the time I was loving
you, you were only waiting for this chance to kill that love, you
were hating me underneath, hating our happiness, hating the ideal
of our marriage you had given me, which had become all the beauty
and truth of life to me! (<i>She springs to her
feet--distractedly</i>) Oh, I can't--I can't! (<i>She starts as
if to run from the room.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>grabbing her--imploringly</i>) Elsa! For God's sake!
Didn't my story explain? Can't you believe--it wasn't I? Can't
you forgive?</p>

<p>ELSA--No! I can't forgive! How can I forgive--when all that
time I loved you so, you were wishing in your heart that I would
die!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>frantically</i>) Don't say that! It's mad! Elsa!
Good God, how can you think--</p>

<p>ELSA--What else can I think? (<i>then wildly</i>) Oh, John,
stop talking! What's the good of talk? I only know I hate life!
It's dirty and insulting--and evil! I want my dream back--or I
want to be dead with it! (<i>She is shaken again by a wave of
uncontrollable chill, her teeth chatter--pitiably</i>) Oh, John,
leave me alone! I'm cold, I'm sick. I feel crazy!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>comes in through the doorway at
rear--sharply</i>) Jack! Why haven't you got her to bed? Can't
you see she's ill? Phone for your doctor. (<i>John goes out.
Loving, his eyes remaining fixed on Elsa with the same strange
look, backs out of the doorway after him.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>coming to Elsa--with great compassion</i>)
My dear child, I can't tell you how deeply--</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>tensely</i>) Don't! I can't bear--(<i>She is shaken
again by a chill.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>worriedly, but trying to pretend to treat it
lightly, reassuringly</i>) You've taken a bad chill. You were
very foolhardy to--But a day or two in bed and you'll be fine
again.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>strangely serious and bitterly mocking at the same
time</i>) But that would spoil John's story, don't you think?
That would be very inconsiderate after he's worked out such a
convenient end for me.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Elsa! For the love of God, don't tell me you
took his morbid nonsense seriously! Is that why you--?</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>as if she hadn't heard him</i>) And when he reminded
me it was raining, it all seemed to fit in so perfectly--like the
will of God! (<i>She laughs with hysterical mockery, her eyes
shining feverishly.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sternly--more to break her mood than because
he takes her impiety seriously</i>) Elsa! Stop that mockery! It
has no part in you!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>confusedly</i>) I'm sorry. I forgot you
were--(<i>then suddenly hectic again</i>) But I've never had any
God, you see--until I met John. (<i>She laughs hysterically--then
suddenly forces control on herself and gets shakily to her
feet.</i>) I'm sorry. I seem to be talking nonsense. My head has
gone woolly. I--(<i>John enters from the hall at rear. As he
comes forward, Loving appears in the doorway behind him.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>coming to Elsa</i>) Stillwell says for you to--</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>distractedly</i>) No! (<i>then dully</i>) I'll
go--to my room. (<i>She sways weakly. John starts toward
her.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--Elsa! Sweetheart!</p>

<p>ELSA--No! (<i>By</i> <i>an effort of will, she overcomes her
weakness and walks woodenly into her bedroom and closes the door
behind her. John makes a movement as if to follow her.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sharply</i>) Leave her alone, Jack. (<i>John
sinks down hopelessly on the chaise-longue. Loving stands behind
him, his cold eyes fixed with a sinister intensity on the door
through which Elsa has just disappeared. Father Baird makes a
movement as if he were going to follow Elsa into her room. Then
he stops. There is an expression of sorrowful foreboding on his
face. He bows his head with a simple dignity and begins to pray
silently.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his eyes now on John--with a gloating mockery</i>)
She seems to have taken her end in your story very seriously.
Let's hope she doesn't carry that too far! You have enough on
your conscience already--without murder! You couldn't live, I
know, if--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>shuddering--clutches his head in both hands as if to
crush out his thoughts</i>) For God's sake! (<i>His eyes turn to
the priest. Then their gaze travels to a point in front of Father
Baird, and slowly his expression changes to one of fearful,
fascinated awe, as if he suddenly sensed a Presence there the
priest is praying to. His lips part and words come haltingly, as
if they were forced out of him, full of imploring fear.</i>) Thou
wilt not--do that to me again--wilt Thou? Thou wilt not--take
love from me again?</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>jeeringly</i>) Is it your old demon you are
praying to for mercy? Then I hope you hear his laughter! (<i>then
breaking into a cold, vicious rage</i>) You cowardly fool! I tell
you there is nothing--nothing!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts back to himself--stammers with a confused air
of relief</i>) Yes--of course--what's the matter with me? There's
nothing--nothing to fear!</p>

<h1><a name="s401">SCENE I</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>The study is shown as in preceding scene, but this
scene also reveals the interior of Elsa's bedroom at left of
study.</i></p>

<p><i>At right of bedroom, front, is the door between the two
rooms. At rear of this door, in the middle of the wall, is a
dressing table, mirror and chair. In the left wall, rear, is the
door to the bathroom. Before this door is a screen. At left,
front, is the bed, its head against the left wall. By the head of
the bed is a small stand on which is a reading lamp with a piece
of cloth thrown over it to dim its light. An upholstered chair is
beside the foot of the bed. Another chair is by the head of the
bed at rear. A chaise-longue is at right, front, of the
room.</i></p>

<p><i>It is nearing daybreak of a day about a week later.</i></p>

<p><i>In the bedroom, Elsa lies in the bed, her eyes closed, her
face pallid and wasted. John sits in the chair toward the foot of
the bed, front. He looks on the verge of complete mental and
physical collapse. His unshaven cheeks are sunken and sallow. His
eyes, bloodshot from sleeplessness, stare from black hollows with
a frozen anguish at Elsa's face.</i></p>

<p><i>Loving stands by the back of his chair, facing front. The
sinister, mocking character of his mask is accentuated now,
evilly intensified.</i></p>

<p><i>Father Baird is standing by the middle of the bed, at rear.
His face also bears obvious traces of sleepless strain. He is
conferring in whispers with Doctor Stillwell, who is standing at
his right. Both are watching Elsa with anxious eyes. At rear of
Stillwell on his right, a trained nurse is standing.</i></p>

<p><i>Stillwell is in his early fifties, tall, with a sharp,
angular face and gray hair. The nurse is a plump woman in her
late thirties.</i></p>

<p><i>For a moment after the curtain rises the whispered
pantomime between Stillwell and the priest continues, the nurse
watching and listening. Then Elsa stirs restlessly and moans. She
speaks without opening her eyes, hardly above a whisper, in a
tone of despairing bitterness.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>ELSA--John! How could you? Our dream! (<i>She moans.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>in anguish</i>) Elsa! Forgive!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in a cold, inexorable tone</i>) She will never
forgive.</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>frowning, makes a motion to John to be
silent</i>) Ssshh! (<i>He whispers to Father Baird, his eyes on
John. The priest nods and comes around the corner of the bed
toward John. Stillwell sits in the chair by the head of the bed,
rear, and feels Elsa's pulse. The nurse moves close behind
him.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>bends over John's chair and speaks in a low
cautioning voice</i>) Jack. You must be quiet.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>His eyes are on Stillwell's face, desperately trying
to read some answer there. He calls to him frightenedly</i>)
Doctor! What is it? Is she--?</p>

<p>STILLWELL--Ssshh! (<i>He gives John a furious look and motions
Father Baird to keep him quiet.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Jack! Don't you realize you're only harming
her?</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>confusedly repentant--in a low voice</i>) I'm sorry.
I try not to, but--I know it's crazy, but I can't help being
afraid--</p>

<p>LOVING--That my prophecy is coming true--her end in my
story.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with anguished appeal</i>) No! Elsa! Don't believe
that! (<i>Elsa moans.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--You see! You've disturbed her again!
(<i>Stillwell gets up and, after exchanging a whispered word with
the nurse, who nods and takes his place by the bedside, comes
quickly around the end of the bed to John.</i>)</p>

<p>STILLWELL--What the devil is the matter with you? I thought
you promised me if I let you stay in here you'd keep quiet.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>dazedly now--suddenly overcome by a wave of
drowsiness he tries in vain to fight back</i>) I won't again.
(<i>His head nods.</i>)</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>gives him a searching look--to Father
Baird</i>) We've got to get him out of here.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>rousing himself--desperately fighting back his
drowsiness</i>) I won't sleep! God, how can I sleep when--!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>taking one arm and signaling Father Baird to
take the other--sharply but in a voice just above a whisper</i>)
Loving, come into your study. I want to talk with you about your
wife's condition.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>terrified</i>) Why? What do you mean? She
isn't--?</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>hastily, in a forced tone of reassurance</i>)
No, no, no! What put that nonsense in your head? (<i>He flashes a
signal to the priest and they both lift John to his feet.</i>)
Come along, that's a good fellow. (<i>They lead John to the door
to the study at right. Loving follows them silently, moving
backward, his eyes fixed with sinister gloating intentness on
Elsa's face. Father Baird opens the door and they pass through,
Loving slipping after them. Father Baird closes the door. They
lead John to the chaise-longue at right, front, of study, passing
in front of the table. Loving keeps pace with them, passing to
rear of table.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts to resist feebly</i>) Let me go! I mustn't
leave her! I'm afraid! (<i>They get him seated on the
chaise-longue, Loving taking up a position directly behind him on
the other side of the chaise-longue.</i>) I feel there's
something--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with a gloating mockery</i>) A demon who laughs,
hiding behind the end of my story! (<i>He gives a sinister laugh.
Father Baird and even Stillwell, in spite of himself, are
appalled by this laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts to his feet--in anguish</i>) No!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Jack!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>recovering, angry at himself and furious with
John--seizes him by the arm and forces him down on the
chaise-longue again.</i>) Stop your damned nonsense! Get a grip
on yourself! I've warned you you'd go to pieces like this if you
kept on refusing to rest or take nourishment. But that's got to
stop, do you hear me? You've got to get some sleep!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes, Jack. You must!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--You've been a disturbing factor from the first and
I've been a fool to stand--But I've had enough! You'll stay out
of her room--</p>

<p>JOHN--No!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--Don't you want her to get well? By God, from the
way you've been acting--</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>wildly</i>) For God's sake, don't say that!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--Can't you see you're no help to her in this
condition? While if you'll sleep for a while--</p>

<p>JOHN--No! (<i>imploringly</i>) She's much better, isn't she?
For God's sake, tell me you know she isn't going to--Tell me that
and I'll do anything you ask!</p>

<p>LOVING--And don't lie, please! I want the truth!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>forcing an easy tone</i>) What's all this talk?
She's resting quietly. There's no question of--(<i>then
quickly</i>) And now I've satisfied you on that, lie down as you
promised. (<i>John stares at him uncertainly for a moment--then
obediently lies down.</i>) Close your eyes now. (<i>John closes
his eyes. Loving stands by his head, staring down at his face.
John almost immediately drops off into a drugged half-sleep, his
breathing becomes heavy and exhausted. Stillwell nods to Father
Baird with satisfaction--then moves quietly to the other side of
the room, by the door to Elsa's bedroom, beckoning Father Baird
to follow him. He speaks to him in a low voice.</i>) We'll have
to keep an eye on him. He's headed straight for a complete
collapse. But I think he'll sleep now, for a while, anyway.
(<i>He opens the door to the bedroom, looks in and catches the
eye of the nurse, who is still sitting in the chair by the head
of the bed, watching Elsa. The nurse shakes her head, answering
his question. He softly closes the door again.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--No change, Doctor?</p>

<p>STILLWELL--No. But I'm not giving up hope! She still has a
fighting chance! (<i>then in a tone of exasperated dejection</i>)
If she'd only fight!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>nods with sad understanding</i>) Yes. That's
it.</p>

<p>STILLWELL--Damn it, she seems to want to die. (<i>then
angrily</i>) And, by God, in spite of his apparent grief, I've
suspected at times that underneath he wants--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his eyes fixed on John's face, speaks in a cold
implacable tone</i>) She is going to die.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts half-awake--mutters</i>) No! Elsa! Forgive!
(<i>He sinks into drugged sleep again.</i>)</p>

<p>STILLWELL--You see. He keeps insisting to himself--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>defensively</i>) That's a horrible charge
for you to make, Doctor. Why, any one can see the poor boy is
crazed with fear and grief.</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>a bit ashamed</i>) Sorry. But there have been
times when I've had the strongest sense of--well, as he said,
Something--(<i>then curtly, feeling this makes him appear
silly</i>) Afraid I've allowed this case to get on my nerves.
Don't usually go in for psychic nonsense.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Your feeling isn't nonsense, Doctor.</p>

<p>STILLWELL--She won't forgive him. That's her trouble as well
as his. (<i>He sighs, giving way for a moment to his own physical
weariness.</i>) A strange case. Too many undercurrents. The
pneumonia has been more a means than a cause. (<i>with a trace of
condescension</i>) More in your line. A little casting out of
devils would have been of benefit--might still be.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Might still be. Yes.</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>exasperatedly</i>) Damn it, I've seen many
worse cases where the patient pulled through. If I could only get
her will to live functioning again! If she'd forgive him and get
that off her mind, I know she'd fight. (<i>He abruptly gets to
his feet--curtly</i>) Well, talk won't help her, that's sure.
I'll get back. (<i>He goes into the bedroom and closes the door
silently behind him. Father Baird remains for a moment staring
sadly at the floor. In the bedroom, Stillwell goes to the
bedside. The nurse gets up and he speaks to her in a whisper,
hears what she has to report, gives her some quick instructions.
She goes to the bathroom. He sits in the chair by the bed and
feels Elsa's pulse. The nurse comes back and hands him a
hypodermic needle. He administers this in Elsa's arm. She moans
and her body twitches for a second. He sits, watching her face
worriedly, his fingers on her wrist. In the study, Father Baird
starts to pace back and forth, frowning, his face tense, feeling
desperately that he is facing inevitable tragedy, that he must do
something to thwart it at once. He stops at the foot of the
chaise-longue and stares down at the sleeping John. Then he
prays</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Dear Jesus, grant me the grace to bring Jack
back to Thee. Make him see that Thou, alone, hast the words of
Eternal Life, the power still to save--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>his eyes fixed on John's face in the same
stare--speaks as if in answer to Father Baird's prayer</i>)
Nothing can save her.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>shuddering in his sleep</i>) No!</p>

<p>LOVING--Her end in your story is coming true. It was a cunning
method of murder!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>horrified</i>) Jack!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with a tortured cry that starts him awake</i>) No!
It's a lie! (<i>He stares around him at the air, as if he were
trying to see some presence he feels there.</i>) Liar! Murderer!
(<i>Suddenly he seems to see Father Baird for the first
time--with a cry of appeal--brokenly</i>) Uncle! For God's sake,
help me! I--I feel I'm going mad!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>eagerly</i>) If you would only let me help
you, Jack! If you would only be honest with yourself and admit
the truth in your own soul now, for Elsa's sake--while there is
still time.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>frightenedly</i>) Still time? What do you mean? Is
she--worse?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--No. You've only been sleeping a few minutes.
There has been no change.</p>

<p>JOHN--Then why did you say--?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Because I have decided you must be told the
truth now, the truth you already know in your heart.</p>

<p>JOHN--What--truth?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--It is the crisis. Human science has done all it
can to save her. Her life is in the hands of God now.</p>

<p>LOVING--There is no God!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>sternly</i>) Do you dare say that--now!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>frightenedly</i>) No--I--I don't know what I'm
saying--It isn't I--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>recovering himself--quietly</i>) No. I know
you couldn't blaspheme at such a time--not your true self.</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>angrily</i>) It is my true self--my only self! And
I see through your stupid trick--to use the fear of death
to--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--It's the hatred you once gave your soul to which
speaks, not you! (<i>pleadingly</i>) I implore you to cast that
evil from your soul! If you would only pray!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>fiercely</i>) No!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>stammers torturedly</i>) I--I don't know--I can't
think!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>intensely</i>) Pray with me, Jack. (<i>He
sinks to his knees.</i>) Pray that Elsa's life may be spared to
you! It is only God Who can open her heart to forgiveness and
give her back the will to live! Pray for His forgiveness, and He
will have compassion on you! Pray to Him Who is Love. Who is
Infinite Tenderness and Pity!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>half-slipping to his knees--longingly</i>) Who is
Love! If I could only believe again!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Pray for your lost faith and it will be given
you!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>sneeringly</i>) You forget I once prayed to your
God and His answer was hatred and death--and a mocking
laughter!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>starts up from his half-kneeling position, under the
influence of this memory</i>) Yes, I prayed then. No. It's no
good, Uncle. I can't believe. (<i>then suddenly--with
eagerness</i>) Let Him prove to me His Love exists! Then I will
believe in Him again!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--You may not bargain with your God, Jack. (<i>He
gets wearily to his feet, his shoulders bowed, looking tragically
old and beaten--then with a last appeal</i>) But I beseech you
still! I warn you!--before it's too late!--look into your soul
and force yourself to admit the truth you find there--the truth
you have yourself revealed in your story where the man, who is
you, goes to the church and, at the foot of the Cross is granted
the grace of faith again!</p>

<p>LOVING--In a moment of stupid madness! But remember that is
not the end!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>ignoring this</i>) There is a fate in that
story, Jack--the fate of the will of God made manifest to you
through the secret longing of your own heart for faith! Take
care! It has come true so far, and I am afraid if you persist in
your mad denial of Him and your own soul, you will have willed
for yourself the accursed end of that man--and for Elsa,
death!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>terrified</i>) Stop! Stop talking damned nonsense!
(<i>distractedly</i>) Leave me alone! I'm sick of your damned
croaking! You're lying! Stillwell said there was no danger! She's
asleep! She's getting better! (<i>then terrified again</i>) What
made you say, a fate in my story--the will of God? Good God,
that's--that's nonsense! I--(<i>he starts for the bedroom
door</i>) I'm going back to her. There's Something--</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>tries to hold him back</i>) You can't go
there now, Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>pushing him roughly away</i>) Leave me alone! (<i>He
opens the bedroom door and lurches in. Loving has come around</i>
<i>behind the table and slips in after him. Father Baird,
recovering from the push which has sent him back against the
table, front, comes quickly to the doorway.</i></p>

<p>(<i>As John comes in, Stillwell turns from where he sits
beside the bedside, a look of intense anger and exasperation on
his face. John, as soon as he enters, falls under the atmosphere
of the sick-room, his wildness drops from him and he looks at
Stillwell with pleading eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>giving up getting him out again as hopeless,
makes a gesture for him to be silent</i>) Ssshh! (<i>The nurse
looks at John with shocked rebuke. Stillwell motions John to sit
down. He does so meekly, sinking into the chair at right, center.
Loving stands behind the chair. Father Baird, after a look into
the room to see if his help is needed, exchanges a helpless
glance with Stillwell, and then, turning back into the study but
leaving the communicating door ajar, goes back as far as the
table. There, after a moment's pause, he bows his head and begins
praying silently to himself. In the bedroom, Stillwell turns back
to his patient. There is a pause of silent immobility in the
room. John's eyes are fixed on Elsa's face with a growing terror.
Loving stares over his head with cold, still eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>in a low, tense voice--as if he were thinking
aloud</i>) A fate in my story--the will of God! Something--(<i>He
shudders.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in the same low tone, but with a cold, driving
intensity</i>) She will soon be dead.</p>

<p>JOHN--No!</p>

<p>LOVING--What will you do then? Love will be lost to you
forever. You will be alone again. There will remain only the
anguish of endless memories, endless regrets--a torturing remorse
for murdered happiness!</p>

<p>JOHN--I know! For God's sake, don't make me think--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>coldly remorseless--sneeringly</i>) Do you think
you can choose your stupid end in your story now, when you have
to live it?--on to Hercules? But if you love her, how can you
desire to go on--with all that was Elsa rotting in her grave
behind you!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>torturedly</i>) No! I can't! I'll kill myself!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>suddenly moans frightenedly</i>) No, John! No!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>triumphantly</i>) Ah! At last you accept the true
end! At last you see the empty posing of your old ideal about
man's duty to go on for Life's sake, your meaningless gesture of
braving fate--a childish nose-thumbing at Nothingness at which
Something laughs with a weary scorn! (<i>He gives a low, scornful
laugh.</i>) Shorn of your boastful words, all it means is to go
on like an animal in dumb obedience to the law of the blind
stupidity of life that it must live at all costs! But where will
you go--except to death? And why should you wait for an end you
know when it is in your power to grasp that end--now!</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>again moans frightenedly</i>) No, John--no!--please,
John!</p>

<p>LOVING--Surely you cannot be afraid of death. Death is not the
dying. Dying is life, its last revenge upon itself. But death is
what the dead know, the warm, dark womb of Nothingness--the Dream
in which you and Elsa may sleep as one forever, beyond fear of
separation!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>longingly</i>) Elsa and I--forever beyond fear!</p>

<p>LOVING--Dust within dust to sleep!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>mechanically</i>) Dust within dust. (<i>then
frightenedly questioning</i>) Dust? (<i>A shudder runs over him
and he starts as if awakening from sleep.</i>) Fool! Can the dust
love the dust? No! (<i>desperately</i>) O God, have pity! Show me
the way!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>furiously--as if he felt himself temporarily
beaten</i>) Coward!</p>

<p>JOHN--If I could only pray! If I could only believe again!</p>

<p>LOVING--You cannot!</p>

<p>JOHN--A fate in my story, Uncle said--the will of God!--I went
to the church--a fate in the church--(<i>He suddenly gets to his
feet as if impelled by some force outside him. He stares before
him with obsessed eyes.</i>) Where I used to believe, where I
used to pray!</p>

<p>LOVING--You insane fool! I tell you that's ended!</p>

<p>JOHN--If I could see the Cross again--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with a shudder</i>) No! I don't want to see! I
remember too well!--when Father and Mother--!</p>

<p>JOHN--Why are you so afraid of Him, if--</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>shaken--then with fierce defiance</i>) Afraid? I
who once cursed Him, who would again if--(<i>then hurriedly</i>
<i>catching himself</i>) But what superstitious nonsense you make
me remember. He doesn't exist!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>takes a step toward the door</i>) I am going!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>tries to bar his path</i>) No!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>without touching him, makes a motion of pushing him
aside</i>) I am going. (<i>He goes through the door to the study,
moving like one in a trance, his eyes fixed straight before him.
Loving continues to try to bar his path, always without touching
him. Father Baird looks up as they pass the table.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>in impotent rage</i>) No! You coward! (<i>John
goes out the door in rear of study and Loving is forced out
before him.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>starting after him</i>) Jack! (<i>But he
turns back in alarm as, in the bedroom, Elsa suddenly comes out
of the half-coma she is in with a cry of terror and, in spite of
Stillwell, springs up to a half-sitting position in bed, her
staring eyes on the doorway to the study.</i>)</p>

<p>ELSA--John! (<i>then to Stillwell</i>) Oh, please! Look after
him! He might--John! Come back! I'll forgive!</p>

<p>STILLWELL--(<i>soothingly</i>) There, don't be frightened.
He's only gone to lie down for a while. He's very tired.
(<i>Father Baird has come in from the study and is approaching
the bed. Stillwell, with a significant look, calls on him for
confirmation.</i>) Isn't that right, Father?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Yes, Elsa.</p>

<p>ELSA--(<i>relieved</i>) Oh. (<i>She smiles faintly.</i>) Poor
John. I'm so sorry. Tell him he mustn't worry. I understand now.
I love--I forgive. (<i>She sinks back and closes her eyes.
Stillwell reaches for her wrist in alarm, but as he feels her
pulse his expression changes to one of excited surprise.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>misreading his look--in a frightened
whisper</i>) Merciful God! She isn't--?</p>

<p>STILLWELL--No. She's asleep. (<i>then with suppressed
excitement</i>) That's done it! She'll want to live now!</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--God be praised! (<i>Stillwell, his air curtly
professional again turns and whispers some orders to the
nurse.</i>)</p>

<h1><a name="s402">SCENE II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>SCENE--<i>A section of the interior of an old church. A side
wall runs diagonally back from left, front, two-thirds of the
width of the stage, where it meets an end wall that extends back
from right, front. The walls are old gray stone. In the middle of
the side wall is a great cross, its base about five feet from the
floor, with a life-size figure of Christ, an exceptionally fine
piece of wood carving. In the middle of the end wall is an arched
doorway. On either side of this door, but high up in the wall,
their bases above the level of the top of the doorway, are two
narrow, stained-glass windows.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a few minutes after the close of the preceding scene.
The church is dim and empty and still. The only light is the
reflection of the dawn, which, stained by the color in the
windows, falls on the wall on and around the Cross.</i></p>

<p><i>The outer doors beyond the arched doorway are suddenly
pushed open with a crash and John and Loving appear in the
doorway. Loving comes first, retreating backward before John whom
he desperately, but always without touching him, endeavors to
keep from entering the church. But John is the stronger now and,
the same look of obsessed resolution in his eyes, he forces
Loving back.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>as they enter--desperately, as if he were becoming
exhausted by the struggle</i>) You fool! There is nothing here
but hatred!</p>

<p>JOHN--No! There was love! (<i>His eyes fasten themselves on
the Cross and he gives a cry of hope.</i>) The Cross!</p>

<p>LOVING--The symbol of hate and derision!</p>

<p>JOHN--No! Of love! (<i>Loving is forced back until the back of
his head is against the foot of the Cross. John throws himself on
his knees before it and raises his hands up to the figure of
Christ in supplication.</i>) Mercy! Forgive!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>raging</i>) Fool! Grovel on your knees! It is
useless! To pray, one must believe!</p>

<p>JOHN--I have come back to Thee!</p>

<p>LOVING--Words! There is nothing!</p>

<p>JOHN--Let me believe in Thy love again!</p>

<p>LOVING--You cannot believe!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>imploringly</i>) O God of Love, hear my prayer!</p>

<p>LOVING--There is no God! There is only death!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>more weakly now</i>) Have pity on me! Let Elsa
live!</p>

<p>LOVING--There is no pity! There is only scorn!</p>

<p>JOHN--Hear me while there is still time! (<i>He waits, staring
at the Cross with anguished eyes, his arms outstretched. There is
a pause of silence.</i>)</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with triumphant mockery</i>) Silence! But behind
it I hear mocking laughter!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>agonized</i>) No! (<i>He gives way, his head bowed,
and sobs heartbrokenly--then stops suddenly, and looking up at
the Cross again, speaks sobbingly in a strange humble tone of
broken reproach.</i>) O Son of Man, I am Thou and Thou art I! Why
hast Thou forsaken me? O Brother Who lived and loved and suffered
and died with us, Who knoweth the tortured hearts of men, canst
Thou not forgive--now--when I surrender all to Thee--when I have
forgiven Thee--the love that Thou once took from me!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>with a cry of hatred</i>) No! Liar! I will never
forgive!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>his eyes fixed on the face of the Crucified suddenly
lighting up as if he now saw there the answer to his prayer--in a
voice trembling with awakening hope and joy</i>) Ah! Thou hast
heard me at last! Thou hast not forsaken me! Thou hast always
loved me! I am forgiven! I can forgive myself--through Thee! I
can believe!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>stumbles weakly from beneath the Cross</i>) No! I
deny! (<i>He turns to face the Cross with a last defiance.</i>) I
defy Thee! Thou canst not conquer me! I hate Thee! I curse
Thee!</p>

<p>JOHN--No! I bless! I love!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>as if this were a mortal blow, seems to sag and
collapse--with a choking cry</i>) No!</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>with a laugh that is half sob</i>) Yes! I see now!
At last I see! I have always loved! O Lord of Love, forgive Thy
poor blind fool!</p>

<p>LOVING--No! (<i>His legs crumple under him, he slumps to his
knees beside John, as if some invisible force crushed him
down.</i>)</p>

<p>JOHN--(<i>his voice rising exultantly, his eyes on the face of
the Crucified</i>) Thou art the Way--the Truth--the Resurrection
and the Life, and he that believeth in Thy Love, his love shall
never die!</p>

<p>LOVING--(<i>faintly, at last surrendering, addressing the
Cross not without a final touch of pride in his humility</i>)
Thou hast conquered, Lord. Thou art--the End. Forgive--the damned
soul--of John Loving! (<i>He slumps forward to the floor and
rolls over on his back, dead, his head beneath the foot of the
Cross, his arms outflung so that his body forms another cross.
John rises from his knees and stands with arms stretched up and
out, so that he, too, is like cross. While this is happening the
light of the dawn on the stained-glass windows swiftly rises to a
brilliant intensity of crimson and green and gold, as if the sun
had risen. The gray walls of the church, particularly the wall
where the Cross is, and the face of the Christ shine with this
radiance.</i></p>

<p>(<i>John Loving--he, who had been only John--remains standing
with his arms stretched up to the Cross, an expression of mystic
exaltation on his face. The corpse of Loving lies at the foot of
the Cross, like a cured cripple's testimonial offering in a
shrine.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Father Baird comes in hurriedly through the arched
doorway. He stops on seeing John Loving, then comes quietly up
beside him and stares searchingly into his face. At what he sees
there he bows his head and his lips move in grateful prayer. John
Loving is oblivious to his presence.</i>)</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>finally taps him gently on the shoulder</i>)
Jack.</p>

<p>JOHN LOVING--(<i>still in his ecstatic mystic
vision--strangely</i>) I am John Loving.</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--(<i>stares at him--gently</i>) It's all right
now, Jack. Elsa will live.</p>

<p>JOHN LOVING--(<i>exaltedly</i>) I know! Love lives forever!
Death is dead! Ssshh! Listen! Do you hear?</p>

<p>FATHER BAIRD--Hear what, Jack?</p>

<p>JOHN LOVING--Life laughs with God's love again! Life laughs
with love!</p>
