<p><font size="4">In testimony of respect for his military
conduct, and scientific acquirements; of esteem for his upright
and honorable Administration of this Government; (his enlightened
endeavours to introduce amongst us the free Institutions of the
Mother Country; and especially his patronage of a Free Press,
that most precious of all boons to this distant land:) as well as
of attachment for his many amiable qualities and private
virtues--this publication, whose objects are intimately connected

ever be revered, and his memory gratefully cherished, is
inscribed by his very obliged and faithful and obedient
servant,</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="5"><b>PREFACE</b></font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font size="4">An explanation is due for the lateness of this
Publication, and it is therefore necessary to state the Gentlemen
who performed the journey, were at first, (a circumstance often
connected with real merit) fearful that their exertions were
hardly deserving of public notice; nor were they induced to
change this opinion, until a considerable time after their
return,--nor then, but at the suggestion of their friends. This
circumstance was some time afterwards mentioned to the Editor,
who with much pleasure undertook the arrangement of the papers,
but was prevented in the commencement of his task by an illness,
which did not allow him to resume his design for many months,
when, a considerable portion of the work having been actually
printed, a new and most unexpected obstacle to its progress
occurred, it being announced that <i>the printer</i> had no more
paper, and that it was utterly impossible at that time to procure
a supply of that article in the Colony.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The late journey of Captain Sturt down the
Murrambidgee, which may be considered a mere continuation of the
previous plan of Messrs. Hovell and Hume, it is hoped will be
admitted a happy opportunity for their present, though late
introduction of the results of their laborious undertaking to the
public, not only on account of the important intrinsic value of
their labors, but from their almost inseparable connection with
those of the latter traveller. Thus to give a geometrical idea of
the relation of the route of Messrs. Hume and Hovell, and of that
of Captain Sturt, it may be said, that the line of march of the
former may be considered as the base line of a triangle, one side
of which is formed by the route of Captain Sturt, the other by
the line of coast to the southward, extending from Encounter Bay
(in which is situate the Emboucheur of the Lake Alexandrina*), to
Port Phillip: and the whole contents of which triangle, a space
of about 112,500 square miles, consisting generally of an
extremely fine country, intersected by numerous streams and
rivers, are now by the conjoint labours of Messrs. Hovell and
Hume, and of Capt. Sturt, laid open to the public.</font></p>

<p>* See Appendix, No. 3.</p>

<p><font size="4">The real merit of the task of the two original
travellers will be best estimated by a reference to the work of
the late Mr. Oxley, Surveyor General, in which the very FINE
country actually TRAVERSED by them is denounced as*
UNINHABITABLE, and according to the prevailing opinions of that
time IMPASSABLE also; indeed, the Colonists must well remember
how hopeless the attempt of these two travellers appeared at the
time at which it was undertaken. However, by their courage and
perseverance, and almost without assistance, the work was
achieved, and by it an accession of information respecting the
interior of this country acquired, far superior to any thing that
had preceded it, and which, as far as regards this Colony, cannot
indeed hereafter be readily surpassed.</font></p>

<p>* We had DEMONSTRATED BEYOND A DOUBT, that no River could fall
into the Sea, between Cape Otway, and Spencer's Gulf, at least
none deriving its waters from the Eastern Coast, and that the
Country South of the parallel of 34, and West of the Meridian
147, 30 East, was uninhabitable and useless for all the purposes
of civilised man.</p>

<p><i>Oxley's Journal,</i> APPENDIX--Page 372.</p>

<p>See also Pages 74, 80,100,101, and 106, of the same journal,
in which the same opinion is still more positively and strongly
expressed.</p>

<p><font size="4">The object of the Editor, which had been
completed at the time when the publication was discontinued from
the want of paper, was to embody in his detail all the more
valuable facts, and remarks which were to be found in the
journals of the two travellers, preserving as nearly as possible
their own method of description, and risking now and then the
chance of becoming tedious to the general reader, for the sake of
giving such precise topical information as he conceived would
enable any one, who was so inclined, to follow their track, or
such as would be interesting and important, if not indispensable,
to persons, who might feel disposed to settle in those Districts,
which he describes. His little leisure from professional pursuits
he regrets, left it not in his power to do much more; and with
this explanation he ventures to submit the work to the kind and
considerate indulgence of the reader.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the Appendix will be found the narratives of
the two journies of Captain Sturt,* as published in the <i>Sydney
Gazette,</i> of dates April 9, 1829, and May 13, 1830, and which,
with the description of Western Port, and its vicinities,
extracted from the narrative of a journey performed by Mr.
Hovell&dagger;, will it is hoped, form a body of information (the
greater part of which has never before been presented to the
public) respecting the interior of this country, not only highly
creditable to the enterprising individuals by whom the several
journies were performed, but of much interest both to the
Colonists, and to the civilised world at large.</font></p>

<p>* No. 4, &dagger; No. 5.</p>

<p><font size="4">An error which occurred in the original title
page of this work is to be explained, in which the name "Port
Phillip" ought to have been, and is now, substituted for Western
Port, and whence it appears, that the travellers had, from the
imperfection of their instruments injured as they were in the
journey, as well as from the hurried manner in which some of
their observations were unavoidably taken, committed an error of
about thirty or forty miles in longitude, an error that it is
hoped, will readily be pardoned, and which was not detected, so
little of the country was at that time known, but by Mr. Hovell's
subsequent journey to Western Port, (see appendix.)*</font></p>

<p>* No 6.</p>

<p><font size="4">Respecting the description of Western Port and
its vicinities one remark which I beg now to submit, will place
the importance of that document and of other similar documents in
their just point of view, namely, that it has been the want of
such information as they alone are calculated to supply which has
caused so many settlements to be established, always at vast
expense to the public, and often to the utter ruin of
individuals, and which yet have scarcely been formed, ere it has
become indispensable to abandon* them. But the value of such
labours need not be insisted upon with those who are in want of
that information which they alone can afford. With the Colonists,
of a young extending Colony, like that of New South Wales, and
with the British public, who have from a thousand causes, so
deep, and daily extending an interest in its welfare, and
advancement.</font></p>

<p>* E. G. Port Phillip which was settled many years ago, and
abandoned, as it will appear from this very Journal, from a mere
want of a knowledge of the numerous advantages it possessed, and
of later years Melville Island, Port Raffles, with Port
Essington, not to mention the disappointments, the anxieties and
the miseries experienced in the present attempt to settle Swan
River, and the result of which enterprise is yet quite
uncertain.--Port Jackson too itself, may be mentioned as another
instance of the effects to form Settlements without a due degree
of the necessary local information; settled as it was by mere
accident, and in consequence of the well known disappointment,
that was met with in the original attempt to settle on the shores
of New Holland.</p>

<p><font size="4">The names given by Messrs. Hovell and Hume to
plants and other Botanical productions met with in their journey
are here retained; no specimens of plants having been collected
by those Gentlemen, from which alone their more precise
denominations could have been ascertained. The Geological
specimens produced, were examined, and named by Mr. Alexander
Berry, of Sydney.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some extracts from a letter* addressed in the
year 1826, to Colonel Dumaresq will explain the opinions of
Messrs. Hovell and Hume at that time, and will testify the sound
judgement by which they were guided in their laborious
investigations as well as in their views for making future
discoveries.</font></p>

<p>* Appendix, No. 6.</p>

<p><font size="4">I will now only add, that the value of the
labors of Messrs. Hovell and Hume is becoming daily more and more
developed to the Colonists in the already extensive and extending
occupations of land in those regions first introduced to the
knowledge of the Public through their exertions, not to mention
the late journey itself of Captain Sturt which as to the
principles on which it was conducted, originated with those
travellers while from the personal information of Mr. Hume during
his accompaniment of Captain Sturt, in his previous excursion
down the Macquarie and Darling rivers, the leading information
and hints for his latter enterprise were almost solely
derived.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Simce writing the above, it has been thought
advisable to add two or three papers to the Appendix, as well as
to subjoin here a few remarks relative to those papers, and to
the present state of the Colony as a point of
immigration.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Paper, No. 7, the Colonial Petition, now on
its way to England, has been signed by 3525 free inhabitants, and
among these signatures are the names of nearly the whole of our
most respectable Colonists. The motives for this Petition were
not only the conviction of the utter unfitness of the existing
form of Government for the present state of the Colony--but they
were the result of the repeated endeavours of the Colonial
Government to wrest from the Colonists the only possible check
upon their Rulers, "a free Press." <i>This</i> created the first
alarm among the Colonists, who plainly perceived, that should the
Government prove successful in this one point--not only would
they remain subject to the most oppressive form of Government in
the known world, but that they would be thus placed without any
practicable appeal whatever for redress. Our Courts, however well
known and often proved, the integrity of the present Colonial
Bench, are scarcely any protection--and would, could the
Government have succeeded in this fatal measure, (and which there
was at one time too much ground to expect) have soon ceased to be
any at all, under the present system, in which the Prosecutor has
been known to appoint his own Jury, and therefore it may not be
unfair to say, has been allowed to decide his own cause, and
eventually to continue to inflict or remit in his own pleasure,
the awarded punishment. It is to obviate this state of things
that the Colonial Petition is now submitted to the Home
Government.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Paper, No. 9, is the Prospectus of a kind
of High School, on an extensive scale, for the Education of our
Youth. The land for this Institution was given so long ago as the
year 1825, by Sir Thomas Brisbane. The Prospectus of this
Establishment contains every information relative to itself, that
can be required. I have only to add, that it has had many and
considerable difficulties hitherto to encounter, and hence the
tardiness of it's progress: but which although slow, is becoming
every day more and more certain;--and there is every reason to
hope that it will not be long ere this most important of all
Institutions will be in active and beneficial
operation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With a School, such as the one proposed, and in
which the appointment of Masters and the admission of Pupils,
will rest with the numerous body of Proprietors, and with that
amendment in the system of our Colonial Government, which the
Petition points out,--the scope of fine country made known to the
Public in the present publication, may be considered a happy
Asylum for the surplus population of the Mother Country. But
without a better form of Government, a confirmed "<i>Free
Press</i>," and Institutions for the Education of Youth, it would
be in vain to look to these shores as a refuge--where an increase
of population would become an increase of evils, tending
eventually, unless obviated, by some such means as those proposed
for adoption, to estrangement from the Mother Country (a
circumstance to be equally deprecated by both parties) to
distress and anarchy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Paper, No. 8, is a copious extract by
permission from the Report of the President of our Agricultural
Society, and which will prove highly interesting to those who are
desirous of information on the subjects of which it
treats.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I shall merely in brief observe here, that the
Colony of New South Wales is admirably adapted to the production
of the Olive, and the Vine, and that there is every reason to
believe it is capable of affording at all times, ample supplies
of every description of grain for its own consumption--that it
abounds in excellent timber, and that its present staple exports
are wool, whale oil, seal skins, and woods, and that, in
addition, it is commencing to export largely the following
articles, viz.--hides, tallow, New Zealand flax, and spars, the
extract of Mimosa bark for tanning, and various other minor
productions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It has manufactories for hats, coarse woollen
cloths, and blankets, leather, salt, soap and candles;--it has
also several breweries, and two distilleries in the vicinity of
Sydney, both admirably situated, and on a scale of magnitude
fully adequate to all the wants of the Colony--with four steam
mills, exclusive of numerous water mills and windmills, employed
in manufacturing flour--and finally an internal revenue of about
&pound;100,000*, and a population of not less than 60,000
inhabitants, according to the most authentic accounts, though not
in conformity with the last official census; but which for
various reasons, it is concluded cannot be correct.</font></p>

<p>* EXTRACTED FROM THE COLONISTS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT; AND OF
THE APPLICATION OF WHICH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEITHER RENDERS NOR
SEEMS EVEN TO CONSIDER ITSELF BOUND TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNT TO THE
PUBLIC!!!</p>

<p><font size="4">I shall conclude these prefaratory remarks,
with one observation, which from its high interest I have
expressly reserved for that purpose, namely, that it would be a
matter of the greatest importance to the Emigrant, that the
Government should devise some means by which the Emigrant might,
on his arrival on these shores, be put in the earliest possible
possession of his land. Delay in this respect being always highly
injurious, and but too frequently equivalent to ruin. The plan
that I would propose for this purpose is--1st. That the Emigrant
should be furnished, without unnecessary delay, with the
Government Order for his land <i>here,</i> in conformity to, or
in ratification of, an order, with which he ought to be provided
from Home on his embarkation, on his having shown here that he
had fulfilled the conditions of such order--namely, that he had
brought with him such property or monies as had been
stipulated--agreeably to the schedule produced by him, at
<i>Home,</i> with the allowance of such deductions as might be
<i>considered proper</i> by the Home Government, for the expenses
of his outfit, passage and freight. 2dly. That a monthly
corrected chart should be kept at the Surveyor General's Office
in Sydney, always open for public inspection, so that the
Emigrant in selecting land, might not commit the too frequent
mistake of selecting such as had been already appropriated--after
repeated fruitless, but expensive and harassing journies in
search of his proposed allotment, and which under the present
system of conducting this Department, there is no possible way
for him to avoid. Copies of these corrected charts should also be
kept at the various Districts at which the different Surveyors
reside--and, 3rdly. That preference of grants, should be given to
priority of choice, as evidenced by official lists, corrected
daily and equally with the charts, accessible by the public.
Better plans than the above may be suggested. It however appears
infinitely preferable to the one at present in use, and should it
do no more than bring this very important subject under the
serious consideration of the Authorities, it cannot fail
altogether of its proposed utility.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, October 2, 1824.--Messrs. Hovell and
Hume having met, as it lay in their route, at Mr. Hume's house,
commenced their journey from Appin, in the County of Cumberland,
accompanied by six men*, a couple of carts, containing their
supplies, drawn by four bullocks, and two horses, having also one
spare horse, and a spare bullock; and each of the men as well as
themselves, provided either with a musket or fowling-piece. At
seven, they halt for the night, opposite to a point of land
called Bird's-eye corner, on the Cowpasture, or Nepean,
River.</font></p>

<p>* Appendix No. 1.</p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, Oct. 3.--At nine in the forenoon they
ford the river, but not without much difficulty, from the
steepness and loose sandy nature of the banks, as well as from
the heavy lading of the carts. Here they commence measuring with
the perambulator, and having travelled three miles halt for the
night near some waterholes, adjoining the boundary line of Mr.
D'Arietta's fine Estate. The weather fine, but hot for the time
of year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, October 4.--Renew their journey,
proceeding along the road that leads into
Argyleshire.*</font></p>

<p>* The road was at this time, little more than a mere track. A
more perfect road has been since contracted, forming the great
Southern road into the interior.</p>

<p><font size="4">The result of their measurements were as
follows:--The place of their departure in the morning to
Carriage-creek, seven miles and a quarter; this to the
Stone-quarry-creek two miles and a half, and this again to
Klensendorlffe's Inn, (where they remain the night,) three miles
and a half, thirty rods. The entire distance travelled this day,
being sixteen miles and a quarter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, October 5.--Leave Klensendorlffe's,
cross the Bargo-river, and thence proceed, to Meehan's forest,
where they remain the night. The distance travelled to-day,
fourteen miles and a half.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, October 6.--Arrive at the watering
place in the Mittigong range, by ten o'clock in the forenoon;
here halt. The weather sultry. At two in the afternoon, again
move forward; cross the Bong-Bong river by five o'clock, and rest
on its banks for the night. The distance from Meehan's forest to
Mittigong, seven miles and a half, thence to the river, six and a
half; the total distance travelled to-day, fourteen
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, October 7.--Had not proceeded more
than five miles, when, the carts requiring some repairs, they
availed themselves of the assistance of a blacksmith living in
the neighbourhood for that purpose, and stop during this short
detention at the house of Mr. James Atkinson, with whom they
breakfast. In the evening pass through Wombat brush*, and arrive
a little before sunset at Patrick's River; here halt for the
night. The distance from Bong-Bong river, to Wombat brush ten
miles, thence to Patrick's river four and a quarter. The total
distance from Bird's eye corner sixty two miles.</font></p>

<p>* This brush, like most other parts of the country frequented
by the animal from which it takes its name, is an excellent light
soil. Not so the country through which they passed about
Patrick's river; than which nothing can be worse.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, October 8.--Continue their route along
the same road as hitherto, and reach Boombarloo (a distance of
eight miles) before breakfast. Here they remain three hours, then
proceed seven miles to Mr. Barber's farm. The distance travelled
to-day, fifteen miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, October 9.--This spot offering plenty
of feed for the cattle, which appear fatigued, they are allowed
to rest. Mr. Hovell proceeds to Dr. Reid's and Lieutenant
Futter's farms (both in the neighbourhood,) and remains the night
at the house of the latter gentleman.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The weather fine during the earlier part of the
day; towards evening, some appearances of rain.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, October 10.--Mr. Hovell goes to Dr.
Reid's house, and thence to Mr. Surveyor Harper's tent, at
Jocqua, that he may compare their own compasses with those of Mr.
Harper. On his return finds Mr. Hume and Mr. Barber, at Dr.
Reid's house. The latter part of the day cloudy and attended with
rain; and during the night heavy and continued rain, accompanied
at intervals with squalls from the eastward.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, October 11.--Resume their route, cross
a tract of poor country, (part of Cookbundoon range,) and at dusk
reach the carts, waiting for them at the waterholes under the
Governor's hill.* Here they remain the night. Weather squally,
with rain from the eastward. The distance from Mr. Barber's,
through the range, is twenty-one miles. Road not good.</font></p>

<p>* These fine fertile plains or downs, are now well known to
the colonists, and there is consequently, required no description
of them here. At about fifteen miles N E. of these downs there is
a considerable quantity of very fine marble of various
colours.</p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, October 12--Cross the plains in the
direction W. by S W. to Broughton's stockyards; thence continue
their progress W S W. to the third Breadalbane Plains. Here they
halt, at the distance of seventeen miles from the place (the
Governor's hill) at which they had slept the preceding
night.</font></p>

<p>* Here they turn off the track or bush road along which they
had hitherto been travelling.</p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, October 13.--Arrive at Mr. Hume's
station*, about one in the afternoon, having travelled this day,
eight miles and a half, W S W. Total distance from Bird's eye
corner, one hundred and twenty three miles and a half.</font></p>

<p>* The land, many miles around Mr. Hume's station, it extremely
good; the hills thickly timbered, the low lands more scantily.
The trees consist of different kinds of the gum; and among these
of a peculiar species called the manna tree (eucalyptus
mannifera.) This, in general appearance, is not much unlike the
box, and produces large quantities of a white sweetish substance,
somewhat resembling manna (whence its name) and which falls from
it during the winter in large quantities, a little after
sunrise.</p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, October 14.--Messrs. Hume and Hovell,
with two of the men, proceed to Lake George, in order to
ascertain the bearings and distance of the Lake from Mr. Hume's
station. The latitude of which is, by account, 34 48 S. and by
double altitude, 34 51. The longitude by account 149 21
E.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They arrive on the borders of the Lake, about
11 in the forenoon. The Lake bears S. 26 E. and is distant from
Mr. Hume's station about twelve miles. They obtain a fine view of
the lake from one of the lofty hills on its banks. This Lake is
about twenty miles in length, in breadth about eight, inclosed
almost entirely with thickly wooded steep hills; and which
towards the South are surmounted by lofty mountains. The soil in
the neighbourhood of the Lake is in general excellent, except on
the hills*. They return at dusk; the weather
unsettled.</font></p>

<p>* It is said that the natives will not taste of the waters of
the lake. Yet those travellers who drink of it, do not perceive
any thing disagreeable either in the taste or otherwise. There is
a story among the natives, that Lake Bathurst, a piece of water
situate about ten or twelve miles to the eastward of Lake George,
(and which is between three and four miles long, but somewhat
less in breadth) has been entirely formed within their own time;
and that they remember the site which it occupies being dry land.
It has evidently become much increased in size within the last
eight years. It was discovered, as well as the surrounding
country, by Mr. Surveyor Meehan and Mr. Hume, in 1817, when, from
the scantiness of our information of the interior, more
particularly in the immediate vicinity of the settlements, a
discovery, even of this trivial extent, was not unimportant. To
these gentlemen the Colony is indebted also for the first
knowledge of Goulburn Plains, and of nearly the whole of the
country in this direction. A species of pine is discovered on
some of the highest mountains south of Lake George; the wood of
which promises to be highly useful.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, October 15.--Squalls at intervals, but
with little rain. The day occupied in writing letters, and in
preparations for to-morrow's journey.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, Oct. 16.--Weather cloudy, towards
evening, threatening rain. Prevented from renewing their journey
to-day, by the unexpected desertion of a native guide, who had
promised to conduct them through a part of the country, in their
advance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, October 17.--Leave Mr. Hume's station
(the last which is settled or occupied by the colonists) without
a guide; travel twelve miles S. 60 W. (through a country
affording good pasturage for cattle, thinly wooded and well
watered) then rest for the night. The soil, near the spot where
they halt, is composed principally of coarse schistus and
granite.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, October 18.--They start about seven
this morning, their route lying across an extensive range of
hills, S. This range which is of moderate elevation, lies between
their last station and Yarrh. In crossing this range they marked
the trees, in the course of their route, with an axe. The range
itself, extending in the directions N W. and by N. and S E. and
by S. consists of poor land but thickly wooded. About noon Mr.
Hovel ascended an elevation on the top of the range, at a little
distance on the right hand of their route, which they named
"Mount Lookout." From this hill there is a pleasing view of the
country* in their advance, consisting of plains skirted by fine
extensive forest, and this bounded to the Southward by mountains.
A little after noon, they begin to descend the south side of the
range towards Yarrh, through a country almost the exact
counterpart of that which they had just passed in their ascent.
Soon after descending the range, they ford a small stream, the
Gondorroo, a branch of the Murrumbidgee; along which stream they
travel one or two miles and then halt. The plains seemed here to
be extensive, and formed a fine sight, the soil good, consisting
of vegetable decompositions, and the disintegrations of granite
and limestone&dagger;, large masses of both of which descriptions
of rock were seen here and there, lying on the surface. The
plains too were interspersed with occasional clumps of the Native
Honeysuckle, sure indications of a loose, light, good soil. The
average direction of their route, S. 45, W.; distance, travelled,
eleven miles.</font></p>

<p>* Yarr. These plains they afterwards named "M'Dougall Plains,"
from the family name of Lady Brisbane.</p>

<p>&dagger; Considerable quantities of shells, embedded in
limestone, were discovered in various parts of these plains.</p>

<p><font size="4">Mount Look-out bears from the place (the last
marked tree,) at which they entered the plains, N E. by N. and is
distant about six miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another high forest mount which stands by
itself, W. 60, N. distant about ten miles, they named after his
Excellency the late Governor, "Mount Brisbane."</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, Oct. 19.--Resume their journey;
pursuing the direction* S W. by W. half W.; and having travelled
about two miles and a half, arrive at the highest spot of land in
the plains. This is nearly due S. of Mount Brisbane, and distant
from it about ten miles.</font></p>

<p>* Obliquely across the plains.</p>

<p><font size="4">Yarrh, Yass, or M'Dougall's Plains, extending
in the directions N W. and S E. consist for the most part, of
clear land generally level. The soil dry and good. These plains
are about fifteen miles in length; in their breadth they vary
from five or six to two or three miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Massive pieces of coarse granite, apparently in
a state of rapid decay, are loosely scattered on all the more
elevated spots in the plains; there are also, but lying level
with the surface, frequent appearances of limestone of an
excellent quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At about eleven o'clock, having crossed the
plains, they enter the forest*, when having travelled over a
level country about five miles and a half, the face of the
country, to their surprise, became at once changed, broken,
irregular, and precipitous; so that it was a considerable time
before they could find a route for the carts.</font></p>

<p>* This, with the southern mountains forms, most probably, the
barrier of separation between the plains and Monaroo, or Brisbane
Downs; discovered in the year 1823, by Captain Currie, R. N. and
the late Major Ovens.</p>

<p><font size="4">At three o'clock this afternoon, they found
themselves on the banks of the Murrumbidgee river, having
travelled from the place whence they started this morning, eleven
miles S. 60 W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The river, however, is so swollen by the late
rains, that it appears utterly impassable, and it is evidently
rising.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The whole of the country, on the opposite side
of the river, is broken and irregular; and, from the appearance
of a high perpendicular rock on the opposite bank, it is presumed
that the hills on that side, are composed of limestone also. The
strata, of which this rock is composed, lie some of them in an
angle of 45, and some of them in an angle of about 60 degrees;
but on a hill near the tent, the limestone lies in large broken
fragments, equally irregular in size and figure, intermixed with
portions of a reddish earthy substance, very similar to
tile.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The river is from thirty to forty yards in
breadth, the water in most places level with the top of the
banks. The rate of the current, at the place where they are to
cross, seems between five and six knots an hour. Weather
squally.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The timber consists on this side of the plain,
of stringy bark, box, the manna tree, and the she-oak; the last
of which is found only on the banks of the river. The greater
portion of the soil is good.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, October 20.--The weather fine except
a few light showers. As the river is still rising, they are
prevented from crossing it, and are in consequence detained on
its banks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, October 21.--The weather throughout
fine. Waters stationary; no appearance of their falling. A party
is therefore sent out to hunt, but returns without success. This
river, as well as all those streams which they have already
crossed, abounds with excellent fish, of the same species as that
in the Lachlan, and in the other streams which run to the
westward. These are in shape like the cod-fish, and of a fine
flavour.* The thermometer at noon 70.</font></p>

<p>* These fish weigh in general from five to twenty pounds; some
of them even exceed the latter weight. They take the bait
readily.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, October 22.--No reduction, nor apparent
probability of any early reduction of the waters. It is
determined therefore to make the attempt without further delay,
and whatever the risk, of crossing the river*--an operation which
is literally no sooner determined upon than effected.</font></p>

<p>* The details may perhaps be of some utility. The timber of
the country unless dry, and there was none to be found in this
state, is not even of itself buoyant, or they would hare availed
themselves of it, to construct a temporary raft or boat for the
conveyance of the supplies; and at this season, as the trees do
not readily part with their bark, they were precluded also from
having recourse to this not unusual substitute for the former.
They now, therefore, but accidentally, turned their thoughts to
the carts; one of which, stripped of its axle, wheels, and
shafts, and securely covered with a tarpaulin, was readily
converted into a tolerably good punt, or boat; this was found
both sufficiently buoyant, and not too crank. The next step was
to convey the end of a stout rope to the opposite bank, for the
purpose of their being enabled to ply their boat backwards and
forwards across the stream; and to effect this indispensable
object, Mr. Hume and one of the men undertook the dangerous
enterprise of swimming across the river, taking with them a small
line, of about six feet long, which they carried between their
teeth; and to the bite or middle of which, was attached a line of
a similar description, but which was of a length sufficient to
reach across the stream. This was not done without great
difficulty, and some danger, both from the extreme rapidity of
the current, and the great pressure of the water on a length of
line so considerable as was necessary for the purpose, the weight
of the latter, not only retarding the progress of the swimmers,
but occasioning them to swim deeply, and at times dragging them
almost under the water, and by which circumstance they were in
fact, swept down the river a considerable distance, ere they
could reach the opposite bank. They now conveyed one of the ends
of their intended tow-rope across the river, by means of the
line, and by ten o'clock, every thing being in readiness, and
their boat loaded, and carrying not less than 6 or 7 cwt. made
its first trip. The bollocks and horses were now conducted across
separately; some of the bullocks being in a state of almost
complete submersion, during the operation, and one of them
becoming turned upon its back, and continuing in this position a
considerable portion of the passage. These difficulties were
attributable, partly to the cattle not being accustomed to
swimming, and partly to the dangerous rapidity of the stream;
which, with the roughness of the weather, and the unusual
coldness of the water, contributed to render this undertaking to
the swimmers at least, not less unpleasant than it was evidently
hazardous.</p>

<p><font size="4">One of the carts is made to supply the place of
a punt or boat, and the end of a tow-rope, having been conveyed
across the river, in the course of four or five hours, the whole
of the supplies, including the second cart is landed, without
loss or injury, on the left bank of the Murrumbidgee. The horses
and bullocks are now conducted separately across the stream,
though not without much difficulty, and considerable risk, by
means of the tow-rope. By five o'clock, every thing had been
readjusted; and they rest for the night on the banks of the
stream, a short distance from the place at which they had
crossed. The weather during the earlier part of the day, cloudy
and showery; towards evening, squalls, accompanied at intervals
with heavy rain.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, October 23rd.--Immediately on leaving
the banks of the Murrumbidgee, they commence crossing obliquely,
and in a zig-zag course (the mean direction of which is S W.) a
moderately steep but high limestone range, lying nearly N. and S.
(parallel with the river at this spot) thinly wooded, but well
covered with good grass. From the summit of this range, an
extensive view of the river is obtained, first forming a reach of
two or three miles to the northward, when it becomes concealed by
its hilly banks and bends to the westward, and then returning in
a southerly direction to the western aspect of the range to a
spot not more than three quarters of a mile from where they
stood, forms an extensive peninsula. From this point (until it is
again lost among the sloping hills and precipitous rocks which
alternately form its banks) it pursues a course of about
three-quarters of a mile, nearly due west.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To the south and S S E. the river is seen at
intervals, for a distance of three or four miles, and beyond this
an interminable extent of a broken, irregular, and mountainous
country presents itself to the eye.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the summit of the range, they continue the
same course, viz. S W. descend gradually a distance of about one
mile, then proceed through a hilly forest country a distance of
about seven miles; at the termination of which, they meet with a
second hilly range, lying in the same direction as the first,
viz. N. and S. of about the same height, or perhaps somewhat
higher, yet utterly unlike that range, the soil being bad,
thickly wooded, and almost without grass. This range they also
cross obliquely as the former, observing (to facilitate the
travelling of the cattle) the same zig-zag course.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At five o'clock they have arrived at the summit
of this range, on the western side of which, immediately before
them, are some fine natural meadows; these they are crossing at
six; walking over grass superior to any which they had ever seen
in the colony.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Each of these beautiful small meadows is
skirted by forest, and this again walled in by steep mountains or
hills. They lie on the left bank of the Murrumbidgee, but from
which stream they are separated by part of the above
barrier.*</font></p>

<p>* The general sward of these meadows, consists not only of a
fine grass like English rye-grass, but also of other grasses,
similar to clover lucerne, and burnet.</p>

<p><font size="4">The trees here consisted solely of the manna
tree. In the hilly ranges they had met with the box and the
stringy bark; and in the limestone districts they had seen the
honey-suckle, and a small species of blue gum.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At sun-set, about mid-way across these meadows,
they halt for the night, near a chain of small ponds (of good
water) extending obliquely across the meadows in a N W.
direction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Their course S. 35 W. the distance travelled
ten miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, Oct. 24.--Up to two o'clock, the day
was spent in a laborious but ineffectual attempt to discover a
pass through the mountain barrier in their advance. The party now
separated; Mr. Hovell, with one of the men, following a chain of
ponds in the direction N W. for four or five miles; when these
ponds were found to form a stream, which made its escape through
a chasm dividing the northern and western barrier ranges from
each other. Down this chasm the stream soon precipated itself in
numerous falls, so that it became impracticable to follow it
further. From one of the forest hills of the northern range, a
fine view of the Murrumbidgee was again obtained at a
considerable depth (perhaps a quarter of a mile) immediately
skirting the range--extending in a direct course towards them
from the eastward about two miles, and from them to the westward
about three miles, a rapid and fine stream of somewhat larger
dimensions than at the spot where they had crossed it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They would now have returned to the tent, but
lost their way in the attempt to find an emu which they had
killed on their way out.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mr. Hume, with two of the men, took the
direction S W.; when, after proceeding about two miles, he met
also with a chain of ponds, extending in the direction of his
route; which again became a stream.--This they succeeded in
tracing, though not without much difficulty, until bending more
to the westward, and descending rapidly through a deep narrow
chasm it poured its waters into another stream which it met at
right angles on the western side of the range. This little stream
was about twenty yards wide, flowing rapidly over pebbles and
loose fragments of rock. On its opposite bank was a beautiful
valley, bounded on the west by a high and almost perpendicular
range, extending parallel with the one through which they had
just passed. Mr. Hume being satisfied of the practicability of
the pass which he had just discovered, they now return to the
tent, where they arrive a little before sunset. Thermometer at
noon 72 deg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, Oct. 25.--Mr. Hovell had returned to
the tent by seven o'clock this morning, and by five in the
afternoon the whole party had descended with safety through the
pass which had been discovered by Mr. Hume, and had arrived at
the precise spot where his journey had terminated yesterday. Here
they remained the night. Distance travelled in a direct line,
five miles and a half, about S. 22 W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday Oct. 26.--This morning was occupied in
forwarding the supplies, as well as the carts across the
stream--when they again pitched their tent not far from its left
bank. Mr. Hovell was now employed in making arrangements for
leaving the carts, (which from the mountainous character of the
country before them, it had become impracticable to take
further), and in concealing along the banks of the stream such of
the supplies as they perceived it would be impossible to convey
on the backs of the cattle. Meantime Mr. Hume, with one of the
men, proceeds in a N W. direction, in quest of a pass through the
western barrier of the valley, travels five miles and then
returns, at dusk, to the tent; having obtained a sight of the
Murrumbidgee, along the banks of which river, they had been
informed by the natives, there is a route, leading to some
extensive plains in the interior. Killed a kangaroo. Thermometer,
at noon, in the shade, 79 deg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, Oct. 27.--The bullocks having
strayed, the party were not enabled to start till near noon. They
now proceed about five miles and a half in the direction N W. by
N.; and at half after two o'clock, arrive at the Murrumbidgee
river, which having just been joined (on its left bank) by the
stream they had passed yesterday, as well as by a small creek on
its right bank, is here running in the direction W. by S. a
broad, apparently deep, and rapid stream.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Along the banks of this river they proceed
about two miles (in the direction W. by S.) when they arrive at
the western border of the valley. Here they soon discovered that
which, no doubt, was the route pointed out to them by the
natives. But unfortunately this proved to be a mere footpath, so
narrow as scarcely to admit one person at a time. Beneath which,
at the depth of about ten feet, was the stream, and above it the
mountain inclining not more than 15 or 20 deg from the
perpendicular. This route therefore, if practicable for the men,
it was too clear, was not merely unsafe, but utterly
impracticable, for the cattle. They had passed some native huts
about half a mile before their arrival at this spot.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mr. Hume contrived, but with considerable
difficulty, to ascend the range, whence he obtained a view of the
river forming a reach of two or three miles due west; and of the
country in the same direction, which appeared more level, and of
a less general elevation than any which they had passed the last
few days, and the hills lower, and more scantily wooded. They now
retraced their steps about two miles and a half, and then halted
at sunset, about five miles from the spot which they had left in
the morning.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, Oct. 28.--They travel to-day 13
miles, effecting a course about due S., nearly the entire length
of the valley, (its average breadth appeared to be about a mile
and a half); when they found its southern extremity almost
completely closed by a mountain branch given off from the western
barrier range, the bluff extremity of which is washed by the same
stream which they had lately crossed. The soil of this extensive
valley is of a highly productive character, the basis of it being
formed of the debris of limestone and of a fine granite, and this
again rests upon a blue limestone, which generally, at regular
intervals of between four and six feet, appears above the
surface, forming long ridges in the direction N W. by N. and S E.
by S. (nearly parallel with the mountains on each side),
frequently extending uninterruptedly, one or two miles in length.
Each of these ridges forms an inclined plane, and is about two
feet in breadth, with its bluff or higher edge facing the east,
and its inclined edge facing the west.* The interstices between
the ridges are thickly covered with a fine grass, which, with the
bare bluff edges of the ridges present, on being viewed from the
eastward, the singular appearance of small waves following each
other in regular succession.</font></p>

<p>* In their progress up this valley, there were observed
several large and deep holes, apparently the outlets of some
considerable subterranean cavities; rich, probably, in the
organic remains of these regions. See Appendix.</p>

<p><font size="4">The base of the western barrier range, and
about one-third of its height consist of limestone. The upper
portion appears to be chiefly plum-pudding stone, resting on an
interposititious layer of a species of schistous or slate. The
lower part of the range appears highly productive, and on the
upper division to the very summits, the grass seems good and the
trees healthy, but the schistous stratum forms a broad belt,
conspicuously marked by almost utter sterility.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, October 29.--At sunrise Mr. Hume, with
one of the men, ascends a high hill not far from the tent, in
order to obtain a view of their projected route. From this is
seen an opening* in the direction S. half W. similar, apparently,
to the one through which they had passed on the 25th instant.
Thither, a distance of nearly two miles, they proceed after
breakfast, when this opening is discovered to be merely a
mountain chasm of not more than ten feet wide. The precipitous
sides of this are upwards of a hundred feet in height, and the
bottom of it forms the bed of a small stream, at present about
two or three feet deep. Their route up this, is of course
impracticable. They now, therefore, retrace their steps about a
mile and a half towards the branch of the Murrumbidgee, and then
commence their ascent of the mountains contiguous to the main
range, which forms the western boundary of the valley. After two
or three hours of much fatigue to the cattle,&dagger; by pursuing
a zigzag route, they arrive at the summit of the most elevated
part of the range near them. This proved, unexpectedly, to be a
broad flat table land, and this again so thickly wooded, that
their view to the westward was utterly intercepted, while in the
direction S E. which was more open, the country appeared
unusually mountainous and irregular. The grass here is
indifferent; the timber good. About a mile and a half from the
spot at which they had reached the summit of this table-range,
they encounter a fine little stream, a desirable object, the day
being very hot. Here, at one o'clock, they stop to refresh, and
resume their route at three, observing the direction S S W.
through a country utterly dissimilar from any which they have yet
noticed on their route. The soil here is not good, but the grass,
if not too old, would be far from bad. The timber superior to any
which they have hitherto met with; and there is abundance of
excellent water. The line of that portion of the mountains on
which they are still travelling, lies N E. and S W.</font></p>

<p>* But which was discovered and examined by Mr. Hume, and
therefore described on the 24th.</p>

<p>&dagger; Each of the cattle had a burthen to carry of not less
than three hundred weight.</p>

<p><font size="4">About six o'clock they halt for the night, near
a little stream. Distance travelled eight miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, October 30.--The day cloudy, but
temperate and agreeable. The distance travelled seven miles and a
half, in a course winding from S. to W. The surface, hitherto
level, is now broken by undulations, forming successive series of
little hills and valleys, with here and there some flats,
consisting of quagmire or bog. These are produced by the
drainings from the surrounding elevations, and are the sources of
numerous little streams, running to the northward and eastward.
One of these streams, however, a fine brook, takes its course to
the N W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They yesterday passed through a small forest,
full of wombat holes, and through another to-day (these spots are
dangerous for travelling), and in some places the route was
rendered almost impracticable, by immense quantities of dead
timber. Twice had they to unload the cattle to-day--once in order
to cross one of the numerous little creeks--the stream in which
runs (N.) very strong; and in the second instance, in crossing
one of the swampy flats, and which even then they were not able
to effect without considerable difficulty. The country to the S.
and S W. becomes somewhat more open than usual, and the timber
always good, continues to improve as they advance. They are at
present among a species of mountain gum, of the finest
description. The stones found on the surface, are a coarse
granite.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, October 31st.--They start at sunrise;
their route, the first two miles (incessantly interrupted by
swampy gutters, S. 25 W.), along the eastern border of one
continued swamp;* the next five S W. and this also alternately
broken by springs and small creeks, or wombat holes; and at other
times, rendered almost impracticable by immense quantities of
dead timber of the largest size, through generally, a thickly
wooded and scrubby country. Between the swamp, and the latter
description of country, they had met with a small patch of good
grass--a timely and very acceptable relief to the
cattle.</font></p>

<p>* This swamp is covered with a species of moss, and has a
considerable stream of water running along its centre.</p>

<p><font size="4">Several emus were seen on the opposite (the
west) side of the swamp, but which, from its impassable nature,
were inaccessible by the dogs. At one or two o'clock, they had
ascended a considerable eminence; when they unexpectedly found,
that they were not far from the precipitous and deep descent that
forms, it seems, one of the terminations of the table range,
along the summits of which they had been travelling the last
three days. Their course, a distance of twenty-four miles, it was
inferred, had been diagonal in respect to the summits of this
range, and which they had reason to believe was, in its general
breadth, not less than ten miles. From this eminence, the objects
most conspicuous are, a large circular basin, at the apparent
distance, of about ten miles (the bottom of which comprises some
miles of level country,) and the lofty mountains which surround
this spot.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the direction N W. they observed smoke,
supposed to proceed from the fires of the natives. This direction
appears far the most favourable for their progress, but is
abandoned, from the opinion that it would lead too much to the
Westward, of that course, from which they are desirous as little
as possible to deviate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At two in the afternoon, they arrive at the
extremity of the table range, distant three miles from the
elevation just noticed. The sight of this descent was rather
terrific; the idea of passing down it was yet more so. After some
deliberation, however, they determine on making the attempt, not
having been able to discover any other place more favourable for
their purpose. About half-past two o'clock, they commence
operations, by first sending down the bullocks, and in an hour
and a half, the whole party arrive safe at the foot of the upper
division of the descent, when, after some minutes rest, upon a
rocky shelf projecting a few yards from the sides of the
mountain, they recommence their passage down the second stage of
the descent, which is considerably less steep than the former. At
the foot of this range, in the distance, they perceive a small
river, with fine pasturage on its banks, and at which, they also
arrive, at about half-past five o'clock.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This stream, which is very strong, appears to
run N W. and is generally, about three or four rods broad, though
in some places not half so much; the banks appear to be
occasionally flooded. Close to the spot where they pitched their
tent was a rapid, extending in length about sixty feet, and the
fall of the water in which was about ten.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The timber observed in this day's route,
consists principally of the best description of the woolley, and
black-butted gums, and of another species--a sort of
box-gum.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the spot at which they commence their
descent, the bearings of the most remarkable mountains round them
were 1<i>st</i>, a very high pyramidal mountain, S. by W. half W.
distant about five or six miles; 2<i>ndly</i>, a range of
mountains, terminating, not far from them at the river,
apparently a continuation of that table range on which they had
just been travelling; and 3<i>dly</i>, continuous ranges of
mountains, extending to the utmost verge of the horizon, in the
direction N W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The total distance gained to-day, was ten miles
S. 25 W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, November 1st.--Thermometer at sunrise,
50; at noon 89 in the tent. As there was here sufficient and good
feed for the cattle, which had had but scanty fare, and were much
fatigued by the last three days journey, they resolve to halt for
the day, intending to employ themselves, in making preparations
for a good journey on the morrow. A large kangaroo was killed,
and a lobster was caught in the river, twelve or thirteen inches
long, and of an excellent flavour.* They sow some clover seed,
and a few peach stones, a practice which they had observed at
every place at which they had stopped since the 19th of the last
month.</font></p>

<p>* In size, shape, and in every respect the same as the common
lobster of England, except a number of carbuncles or small nobs
on the back, cuminated, as to constitute a rough or somewhat
prickly surface.</p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, November 2d.--They cross the river
immediately, after breakfast, a little below their resting place;
journey along the left bank, in a N. westerly direction three
miles, and then, leaving the river, proceed S W. two miles along
a valley, appearing to offer a passage in that direction the most
desirable for them. The soil here is not very good. It was now
noon, and the weather oppressively sultry, they therefore
remained in this spot till three,* when they again advanced in
the direction W S W. three miles. Considerable improvement begins
to be here perceptible in the soil, the formation of the hills,
and in the timber, which also stands more thinly scattered than
on those parts of the country over which they had lately
travelled. Kangaroos are in abundance; the grass long and
fresh.</font></p>

<p>* On the bank of a little creek, that joins the stream which
they had left.</p>

<p><font size="4">About five this afternoon they arrive in sight
of some small plains to the westward, with a large stream in that
direction, and an opening extending N. and S. through which, as
far as it could be seen, the stream pursues its course. The
timber, as they approach this river, appears to be the same as
that on the Murrumbidgee, but there is no swamp oak.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A native path, bearing impressions of the feet
of a considerable number of natives, including those of women and
children, was here met with, extending in the same direction in
which they were themselves desirous of travelling.*</font></p>

<p>* These paths may, of course often be distinguished from those
of the kangaroo, by the form of the foot marks; besides, those
paths peculiar solely to the kangaroo, are much narrower than the
former. Any of them, however, are highly valuable, being not only
the best guides to grass or to water, but those of the natives
being frequently the only directing marks through an intricate
and difficult country.</p>

<p>The impressions of the feet of the Aboriginal natives may be
readily distinguished from those of Europeans, by the narrowness
of the heel, the comparative broadness of the fore part of the
foot, the shortness of the toe, and a peculiar bend of the
internal edge of foot inwards (a form very probably incident to
the method employed by these people in climbing trees); and the
smallness of the entire impression, compared with that of a
European.</p>

<p><font size="4">Some of the trees bear the marks of iron
tomahawks, obtained possibly from the stockmen at Lake
George.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Having advanced two miles further, (S W.) they
halt for the night. The total distance travelled this day, is
eleven miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, November 3.--Weather cloudy;
indications of rain. They start at sunrise; proceed towards the
river, and after having travelled three miles in the direction
about S. 20 deg. W. arrive on its banks. This stream, which they
name the "Medway," proves to be about 100 feet wide, has a strong
current, and is of various depths. They proceed along the right
(the E.) bank of this river three miles (S.) and then rest (at
ten o'clock). Several kangaroos were seen in the course of the
day. One of these was killed, weighing not less than one hundred
weight. The basis of the soil appears to consist of a coarse
granite; the grass good. At two in the afternoon they renew their
journey along the right bank of the river; proceed two miles S.
then S. 15 E. two and a half miles. The river here bending a
little to the eastward, they deem it advisable to cross it; but,
finding it too deep, return down the stream one mile and a
quarter, where they discover a place at which the natives had
apparently crossed only a few days previously.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The river, at this ford, is at least 150 feet
wide, the current strong, and the water about two feet and a half
deep. Below this spot, a short distance, there were some falls.
They cross with the cattle, loaded, and shortly after sunset
encamp on the left (W.) bank.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the marks on its banks, and on the trees,
this river is evidently subject at times to floods, when the
water must occasionally rise at least ten or fifteen feet higher
than its present level.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thermometer, at sunrise, 54 deg.; at noon, 79
deg.; distance travelled, nine miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, November 4.--At about half past six
o'clock, they again move forward, leave the banks of the river,
and shape their course for an opening in the mountains, bearing
S. 20 E. at the supposed distance of four miles and a quarter. On
their arrival, however, at this spot (through which they had
hoped to be enabled to pass), they again come in sight of the
river, running in the direction N E.; and here they seem as if
they were again about to be completely shut in on all sides by
mountains. Two miles yet further S. they arrive at the river,
where they rest about noon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During the last four days and nights, they have
been tormented by swarms of little flies; these by day, and a
large species of musquito by night, were found extremely
distressing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The tea-tree grows on the sides of this river.
A fish was seen in the stream, but which refused the bait. This
was the first fish that had been observed in the last two rivers,
and closely resembled the cod fish of the Lachlan and
Murrumbidgee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Convinced of the impossibility of pursuing
their desired route, by proceeding up the river, they decide upon
ascending a mountain in front of them, in the hope that it would
prove to be a part of some continuous main range (that is,
running N. and S.), on the summit of which (as in the late
instance), they might be enabled to travel until they should
discover a country somewhat more favourable for their progress
than that immediately around them. After an hour and a half's
fatigue, they reach in safety the summit, but which they find
completely insolated from the main range, excepting at one point;
and here it is connected to it only by a causeway, not more than
20 feet broad, and about 200 feet long. At this spot they encamp
for the night. The thermometer 76 deg. at noon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The natives appear to be numerous; in the
course of the day, their fires were seen in different directions,
and their huts or camps (which are constructed in the same manner
as those in that part of the country which we inhabit) have been
frequently met with; they were several times hailed, but could
not, although they replied, be induced to approach.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Distance travelled, seven miles and a half,
from S. 20 E. to S. 35 W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, November 5--At sunrise, having
proceeded along the causeway, or ridge, they commence ascending
the mountain, to which the extremity of it is attached; when
having arrived about a furlong from the summit they find it
necessary to unload the cattle, and for the men to carry up the
loads, the ascent having become so steep, that the cattle are
every moment in danger of slipping or falling, in which event
they would be precipitated down this steep descent, and be
inevitably dashed to pieces: the mountain, part of which rises at
an angle of 50 deg. and much of it at that of 45 deg. being at
least a mile in extent, in a direct line from the foot to the
summit. At half past eight in the forenoon, they had completed
their ascent of the mountain, which they found, as they had
surmised, to consist of an extensive table land, thickly covered
with timber of the largest size, (the usual species,) and of the
best quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The cattle are now re-loaded, and they proceed
in a Westerly direction one mile, when they arrive at a small
stream. Here they halt to breakfast, and refresh the cattle,
which had been without water during the night; none, excepting an
extremely small quantity, insufficient for their own use, having
been procurable.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After breakfast they again proceed, travelling
along a spine, or ridge, of about a quarter of a mile broad, and
which forms the central summits of this range. At six they halt
for the night, having travelled, a distance of eight miles and a
half; in the direction S. 45 W. to W. 10 N. The country traversed
to-day, is almost the precise counterpart of the table-land over
which they had just before travelled, in their route from
lime-stone valley, consisting of swamps and springs, as in that
instance, though neither so numerous nor so extensive. The basis
of the soil which is moderately good, consists of a coarse
granite. They met to-day, with pheasants, and several other
species of birds, peculiar to rocks and scrubs. At a spot where
they halt, near a swampy creek,* there is abundance of grass. The
air is dry; in the day time cool; during the night cold, and
there is no sign of dew.</font></p>

<p>* These creeks commence in numerous springs, which are found
on each side, on the edges of the ridge along which they are
travelling, boiling out of an apparently deep peaty soil, covered
with a species of moss; and which having pursued their course a
short distance, become strong streams.</p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, November 6--Weather throughout the
day, cool and cloudy, in the evening showery. Thermometer, at
sunrise, 44 deg. After breakfast they again renew their route, as
hitherto, along the spine or ridge, which, without any observable
depression or elevation, forms the summit of these mountains,
winding diagonally (about S W. and by W. nearly in the direction
of the course which they were desirous of making good) across the
range. All the land passed to-day, in a distance of six miles, is
extremely good, but the grass coarse and wiry. The timber (of the
usual species) moderately thick, but of the best quality; the
basis of the soil a coarse granite. They had now (it was noon,)
unexpectedly reached the S W. extremity of the ridge or spine,
and of this table range, which here terminates in an abrupt and
very steep descent. The mountain range appears to branch off at
this spot, on each side of them, viz. to the S E. and N W. but
the spine or ridge along which they had been hitherto travelling,
seemed here finally to terminate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The view from this spot consists of a valley
(immediately in their front S.), extending in the direction S W.
and varying from one to two miles in breadth. Along the centre of
this valley, runs a small stream, and immediately beyond the
stream, is a broken mountainous country, and in this again, a
remarkably deep chasm or opening, bearing due S. at the back of
which, though apparently at a considerable distance, the view is
finally closed by mountains, both of a different form (peaked),
and of an infinitely greater height than any which they had yet
seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They now descended the table range pursuing the
zig-zag course of one of the little tributaries of the stream
which they had observed in the valley, taking its rise in these
mountains, not far below the spot at which they commence making
their descent. At six o'clock in the evening, they arrive in the
valley. At seven, having still pursued their course along the
same branch, they come to the main stream, which having been now
enlarged by the junction of a second branch, was here about four
feet deep, and on the average, eight feet broad, flowing at about
the rate of two miles an hour; the banks grassy, the brink
covered with reeds. In effecting the descent from these
mountains, they had nearly lost one of the party, as well as a
bullock; the animal had fallen when it had reached about
two-thirds down the mountain, in consequence of the slipping of a
stone from under its feet, and in its fall, it had forced down
with it, the man who was leading it. But their fall was
intercepted by a large tree, and the man, as well as the animal,
was thus prevented from being dashed to pieces. The man, however,
unfortunately, was much hurt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Never was the great superiority of bullocks to
horses (in some respects) for journeys of this description, more
observable than in the progress of this dangerous and difficult
descent. The horses, it had become indispensable to unload, and
to conduct with great care; but if one of the bullocks be led,
the rest follow; the horse is timid and hurried in its action, in
places where there is danger; the bullock is steady and cautious.
If the latter slip in its ascent, or if the acclivity be too
steep for ascent, in its usual mode of progression, the animal
kneels down, and scrambles up in this posture. If it be
descending, and it become placed in a similar predicament, it
sits down, and turns its head round towards the ascent, as if to
balance the body. For the crossing of unsound or boggy ground,
the structure of its hoof is particularly adapted, while the foot
of the horse, on the contrary, is ill suited for this purpose,
and for which the fears, and consequent agitation of the animal,
render it unfit.*</font></p>

<p>* Bullocks ought, when used for these journeys, to be shod;
the feet, otherwise, are very liable to become disabled.</p>

<p><font size="4">They observe several pheasants and kangaroos,
of the species known by the name of the "black whallaby," a
circumstance adverse to their hope of soon reaching a level
country, those animals being generally the inhabitants of
mountains and scrubs. Near the foot of the mountain, they notice
the sassafras-tree, the fern-tree, and the musk plant, none of
which are usually found so far in the interior. They halt for the
night at sunset, having first crossed to the left bank of the
stream. Distance travelled this day, eleven miles S. and S. 45
W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, November 7.--The cattle being fatigued,
and their backs much galled by the pack-saddles, they are allowed
to rest. The day fine throughout; the grass excellent. They kill
a large kangaroo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, November 8.--At half past seven o'clock
they had recommenced their progress, proceeding along the stream
in a S. westerly direction, the stream becoming gradually broader
and deeper as they advanced. At about five miles from their place
of departure, it is broken by three several perpendicular falls,
each from about ten to fifteen feet in height, and between twenty
and thirty feet distant from each other. Two miles beyond these
falls, their progress on the banks of this stream is arrested by
the mountainous range forming the southern barrier of the valley,
and which, on each side of it, rises precipitously out of the
stream.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Messrs. Hovell and Hume having ascended, close
to the stream, with some difficulty, about half the height of
this range, in order to be the better enabled to decide as to
their future operations, were suddenly surprised by a sight, to
the utmost degree magnificent. Mountains, of a conoidal form, and
of an apparently immense height, and some of them covered about
one fourth of their height, with snow, were now seen extending
semicircularly from the S E. to S S W. at the supposed distance
of about twenty miles. The sun was bright (it was about ten or or
eleven in the forenoon), and gave them an appearance the most
brilliant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The mountains which they had hitherto seen,
compared with these stupendous elevations, were no more than
hillocks; from which, also their form, as well as their other
general characters, rendered them not the less
dissimilar.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The men no sooner heard of this unexpected and
interesting scene than, catching the enthusiasm, they ran to the
spot where the travellers were standing, and were not less than
themselves surprised and delighted at this pre-eminently grand
and beautiful spectacle.*</font></p>

<p>* These are evidently part of those high "peaked" mountains,
which were seen to the southward of them, just previously to
their descent from the table range, on Saturday last, (the 6th
instant,) and are doubtless, part of the same mountains that were
seen by Major Ovens and Captain Currie, R. N. in their expedition
to Monaroo, in 1823.</p>

<p><font size="4">The stream itself, where last seen, was running
to the southward, towards the newly discovered mountains. The
space between these mountains (which have been designated the
South Australian Alps*) and the spot where they stood, consists
of a mountainous and hilly region, which becoming gradually of
less and less elevation, terminates midway, in a thinly wooded
undulating surface, extending parallel with the mountains on
either side of it.</font></p>

<p>* In contra-distinction to the Australian Alps, some mountains
discovered about this period, in the vicinity of Moreton Bay.</p>

<p><font size="4">The river probably runs along this central
depression, but is not visible.*</font></p>

<p>* It most probably takes a South westerly course, and is one
of the tributaries of the "Hume," a river which it will be seen
they met with afterwards.</p>

<p><font size="4">As they perceive, from the character of both
the mountain range on which they are standing, and of the country
immediately beyond them, that their progress (in the direction of
these southern Alps) would be either impracticable, or attended
with considerable danger, to both themselves and the cattle, they
at once, instead of making the attempt, decide upon proceeding
fifty or sixty miles to the westward; the object now in view,
being to avoid, if possible, a repetition of those almost
insurmountable difficulties by which they have hitherto been
perpetually surrounded, and which appeared to be incidental
solely to these mountainous regions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They accordingly commence their new route, by
re-ascending the stream, about a mile and three quarters (to the
falls), and crossing to its right bank. Here they rest about two
hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At three in the afternoon, ascending some low
hills which lie across their route, they proceed west about a
mile; then north, along the summits of these hills, three miles,
to a little stream, a branch of that which they had left, here
they remain the night. The grass good--the water equally
so.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">About an hour's march before their arrival at
this halting place, they had passed between two small conical
hills, unusually barren, (in the general acceptation of that
word,) but conspicuous for the number, variety, and beauty, of
the shrubs and plants--and those at that time in full
flower--with which they were covered.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They had travelled this day about fifteen
miles, S. 16 W. to W. 10 N.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, November 9th.--The distance travelled,
about thirteen miles. The direction of their route, S. 65 W. (the
only instance of one direct course since their departure from
M'Dougall's Plains,) through a fine level forest country of
excellent pasturage, and well supplied with water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The mountain ranges, the one a branch of the
table range, which they had descended last Saturday, the other (a
continuation of those mountains by which their progress to the
southward had been just intercepted) had been in sight, almost
continually, during the whole of yesterday. That on the right
hand, the branch of the table range, in general perpendicular, in
some places like a wall, and of undiminished height (this was
much the higher range of the two,*) while that on their left
hand, in the short distance of twelve miles, had gradually
subsided almost to a level with the country over which they were
travelling.</font></p>

<p>* There was a view of another portion of this range, in the
return route, at the distance of about thirty miles, when it was
still of undiminished elevation, and equally precipitous.</p>

<p><font size="4">Here (at about four o'clock) the South
Australian Alps were again in sight, bearing S. by E. half
E.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Two kangaroos were killed to-day. One of the
dogs was severely cut, and almost killed by the larger of these
animals. They also met with two snakes a brown and a black one,
the former of which was destroyed. Distance travelled, thirteen
miles, S. 80 W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A piece of stone, taken yesterday, from a spot
near a run of water, being tested with the muriatic acid, gave
indications of lime. The soil of this spot was extremely good;
there were however but few trees here, and those consisted
chiefly of the manna, and the honeysuckle, and were none of them,
as timber, of any value.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, November 10th.--The approach of the
morning cold, the evening pleasant, but the noon sultry. (The
thermometer, then ranging about 98.) This has been the state of
the weather for some days.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They commenced moving about six o'clock, but
had not proceeded more than half a mile, when they unexpectedly
arrived at the brink of a ravine, extending in the directions N.
and S. of not less than 1000 feet in depth, and the sides of it
precipitous; they were compelled by this obstacle to alter their
course, when having proceeded N. 60 W. a mile and a half, they
again met with the ravine, but into which, with the assistance of
a kangaroo path, they now were enabled to descend, the walls of
it having here become broken into detached hills of comparatively
moderate steepness.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The ravine, at the spot where they effected
their descent, is about half a mile broad. In its course,
however, it varies in breadth extending into a valley, in some
places of double that breadth, while more to the Southward at the
place where they had first met with this ravine, its sides had
gradually converged into the form and dimensions of a mere chasm,
not more perhaps than 100 yards in breadth, and the walls of
which, were not merely, precipitous, but absolutely
perpendicular. The soil of the valley, forming the bottom of this
ravine, is in general good, possessing for its base, a mixture of
limestone and granite; the grass excellent. The little streams
which were found here, uniformly run to the Southward, as did all
the waters which they had met with the last few days. Hitherto,
they had been observed just as invariably to take a contrary
course, to the Northward, and Westward. They had travelled
to-day, about eight miles; the spot at which they stop to-night,
is a complete scrub. The stones contain lime.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, November 11th.--*This morning, at six
o'clock, again following a kangaroo track, they commence
ascending a very high hill, a portion of the western wall of the
ravine, under the impression that it was part of some main range,
along the summits of which they might possibly be enabled again
to pursue their route to the Southward. After having encountered
every species of impediment or difficulty in their ascent, they
arrive about nine o'clock on the summit, which, to their chagrin,
proves to be a mere spine or ridge, so narrow and so craggy, as
to be almost impassable by cattle. They therefore, no sooner
reach the brow of this hill, than they find it necessary to
descend on the opposite side: this operation occupies an hour.
From the craggy summit&dagger; of this hill, another, but more
distant view of the Alps was obtained; one of the snow-capped
mountains, (that seen yesterday,) bearing S E. with a mountainous
or broken country, extending from the last mentioned bearing, to
W. and by N.</font></p>

<p>* The thermometer, at sunrise, 46; at noon, (in the shade,)
68; at sunset, 78.</p>

<p>&dagger; The summit consists of mere heaps of massive
fragments of rock, but of what description was not ascertained.
All this labour might have been spared, as they afterwards found,
by passing round the northern side of the base of this hill.</p>

<p><font size="4">Having descended this hill, they halt in the
bed of a small ravine, formed between this, and a similar, but
smaller eminence in their advance. Here they remained until three
o'clock, but were utterly unable to obtain any rest, in
consequence of the incessant and distressing attacks of the small
flies before noticed; the horses retreated almost into the fires
for the sake of the smoke--the dogs lay down in the water holes
and the bullocks in the long grass, in order to escape from these
insects. During the entire period that they have been among the
mountains, the cattle have been, from this circumstance, totally
unable to feed during the day, and but little at night, from the
incessant and almost equally tormenting attacks of the
mosquitoes. At three they ascend the small but steep hill in
their front, and having proceeded about two miles (W.) across its
summit (their route nearly level, through a brushy forest,)
arrive at its Western side; here the land falls at once, forming
a beautiful country, consisting of successive small slopes and
elevations, extending from the N N W. to N. to the utmost verge
of the horizon. This tract was thinly wooded, and the grass every
where apparently abundant and excellent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The waters which they now occasionally pass,
take their course to the N W. Having descended this hill, they
travel westerly about four miles, through a good forest country,
on which the timber consists of blue-gum, and
stringy-bark.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The distance travelled to-day, measured by the
perambulator, was* nine miles and a half S. 45 W. and N. 75
W.</font></p>

<p>* Here finishes the travelling on these ranges, whether of
mountains or hills, which ran N. and S. The ranges met with after
this period, consist of branches of the latter, bending in a
Westerly direction, comparatively easy to traverse, and becoming
gradually of less and less elevation, as they extend into the
interior.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, November 12th.--They travel to-day,
thirteen miles to the southward and westward; for the first
moiety of their journey, through a country utterly dissimilar
from any which they have seen since their leaving M'Dougall's
Plains, flat and boggy (although, from the state of the water
holes, which are numerous, there has evidently been no rain a
considerable time). Here, on their left, the country consisted of
the terminations of the collateral branches of those mountainous
or hilly regions over which they had hitherto been travelling. On
their right, on the contrary, the land was only a little higher
than that which formed their actual line of march; the whole
thinly wooded; the timber fine, but the land not good. The second
portion of their journey to-day, the commencement of which was
marked, by their passing between two low grassy hills, lay
through a country of an infinitely superior description; dry,
fertile, and thinly timbered, consisting of a successive series
of small slopes and elevations, of excellent
pasturage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The waters past to-day, were generally standing
in little pools (lying in the direction N W.), warmed by the sun;
in the former part of their journey, plentiful and good; in the
latter, scarce and ill tasted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The timber was principally stringy-bark, a
species of gum, and the cow-pasture box. They met with the
bullrush in one of the little pools. Neither an emu nor a
kangaroo have they seen since last Tuesday; they are,
consequently, obliged to feed their dogs,* which are almost
famished, on boiled flour.</font></p>

<p>* These faithful animals had been of the utmost importance to
them (in procuring supplies of animal food) and continued to be
so, until, in the course of the journey, some unfortunately were
lost, and others disabled. Not a kangaroo or an emu is to be seen
this hot weather, except in the morning and evening; during the
beat of the day, they retire to the scrubs in the mountains.</p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, November 13.--The day throughout,
oppressively sultry. They travel first W. and then S W.--in all,
seventeen miles; the first thirteen miles, through a fine open
forest country (here and there intersected with little creeks, or
interspersed with ponds), of even a somewhat superior character
to that over which they had travelled yesterday afternoon. At the
end of this stage of their journey, they pass again between two
low hills, grassy, and covered with trees, lying in a line with,
and almost contiguous to, the southern extremity of a hilly
range, extending about four miles in length, in the directions N.
and S. Here they come into sight of a mount, bearing S. by W.
half W. distant about four miles, which, from its very peculiar
appearance, they name "Battery-mount." This is the southern
extremity of a much higher range than the former, but running
parallel with that range, at the distance from it of about two
miles and a half. The mount is of a dark red colour, and from
which circumstance, as well as its form, is an object not only
very remarkable in itself, but utterly dissimilar from any other
which they had met with in their journey.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another mount is also now in sight, which was
passed yesterday, and named, from this circumstance, "Friday
Mount," bearing E. by N. distant from them about fifteen
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The whole of their immediate track, as well as
all the surrounding country seen to-day, like that of yesterday,
is a fine open forest country, consisting alternately of hill and
dale, and similar in every respect to the
Cowpastures.*</font></p>

<p>* From the closeness of this resemblance, they were induced to
name it "Camden Forest."</p>

<p><font size="4">There does not appear to have been any rain
here a considerable time, and they are obliged, in consequence,
to travel two miles farther than it had been their intention, and
this after sunset, for water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, November 14.--The cattle are so much
fatigued by the journey of yesterday, that they are permitted to
rest. The men employ themselves in hunting, and bring home a
large kangaroo, the first that has been seen for four or five
days. In the course of the forenoon there was some thunder, with
other indications of an approaching much-wished-for shower, but
no rain. Messrs. Hovell and Hume, meantime, occupy themselves in
an excursion to Battery-mount, which is at a distance of not more
than two miles (W.) from their tent. This they climb to its
summit, and obtain hence an extensive and fine view of the
surrounding country.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To the eastward are seen those mountainous
regions which they had just left (the most western borders of
which, appear to be at the distance of about fifteen miles). From
the S W. to the N N E. the view is bounded by a continued range
of mountains, apparently consisting of two converging branches of
the former, extending in the form of a crescent;* the greatest
distance of which, to the southward, is about thirty miles, but
to the northward very considerably less. Nearly west, the ranges
become somewhat of reduced height; and due west, there is a break
or opening, probably the outlet of a river.</font></p>

<p>* Forming the section of a very considerable circle, of which
the N. and S. range may be supposed to be the chord. The country
within the scope of this fine view, and which is thus enclosed by
mountains, is perhaps about forty miles square, and there is
reason to suppose, from the general appearance, consists,
entirely, of land of the finest description.</p>

<p><font size="4">All the intermediate country to the northward,
southward, and eastward, has one general character--consisting of
slight undulations, but interspersed here and there, more or less
numerously, with conical hills, of various, but never of
considerable elevation. Due west, however, there is not a hill or
an elevation to be seen; but, here the land gradually
dips.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the direction S E. the mountains, evidently
a continuation of the South Australian Alps, preserve the usual
character of those mountains; are peaked, and apparently, though
now seen at a great distance, of their former pre-eminent and
immense elevation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Smoke, from the fires of the natives, was seen
in different directions, between S W. and W. presenting the
gratifying indication that the country was passable, and that
they would not be unsupplied with fodder for the
cattle.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But, to return to Battery-mount, the spot on
which they are now standing. This is the southern extremity of a
short range (not more than five or six miles in length), lying
due N. and S. of moderate elevation; the upper part on its
eastern aspect perpendicular, about one-third of its height; the
lower portion, forming a steep slope, composed apparently of the
material of the range itself, which has fallen down from time to
time in the gradual progress of its decay.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The summits of the range form nearly one
continuous level line, broken here and there only by an
occasional chasm of various breadths; in one of which, near the
southern extremity of the range, a centre portion is yet
standing, <i>forming a wall</i> of about fifty or sixty feet in
thickness, and of about seventy feet in height, and extending in
length about half a mile, the breadth of the range.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This fragment, and the faces of the chasm in
which it stands, present a favourable opportunity for observing
the internal structure of the range; which was found to consist
throughout, of stones of different sizes; the stones hard, heavy,
of a darkish colour, in general not exceeding the size of the
clenched fist; some of them, however, of four or five times that
dimension; the larger stones in particular, of an elliptical
form, but somewhat flattened on two of their sides, opposite to
each other. These stones are held together by a hard earth, of a
dull reddish colour, constituting a species of cement,* by which
they are so firmly united, that it was with considerable
difficulty any portion of the mass could be broken. This mass
again appeared to be divided into regular strata, dipping about
15 deg. to the westward.</font></p>

<p>* This interstitial matter it perhaps in proportion to the
stones or pebbles, which it unites, as two to one.</p>

<p><font size="4">Some other circumstances connected with this
range, and more particularly with the chasm, deserve mention;
1<i>st,</i> that the floor, or bottom of the chasm, is flat, and
has the same general character as that of the summits of the
range; and, 2<i>dly</i>, that it preserves the same dip as the
upper strata, and which is also parallel with the line of the
summits.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, November 15.--The distance travelled
to-day, is fifteen miles S. 25 W. Six miles from Battery-mount,
they meet with a fine creek of excellent water, and a second
smaller creek, or chain of ponds (as it appears at present) at
the close of their day's journey; the former running S E. the
latter S. The former, which they named "Battery-mount Creek,"
takes its rise from Battery-mount. They also pass some other
pools, or chains of ponds. The whole of the country passed today,
is but a realization of the view from Battery-mount. The soil
excellent, a rich red loam, thinly wooded, and although parched,
the grass luxuriant, plentiful, and of the best quality, and with
water sufficient either for sheep or horned cattle.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The country extending from Battery-mount to the
left bank of the creek, they named "Battery-mount
Forest."*</font></p>

<p>* The country between the right bank of the creek and the
river Hume, (a river discovered the next day,) is designated
"Forbes's Forest," after the Honourable Francis Forbes, the Chief
Justice of the Territory; and a very remarkable hill also,
considerably the highest seen to-day, situate near the line of
their route, about seven miles from the creek, they named
"Judge's Mount."</p>

<p>Judge's Mount, it would seem, from the specimen produced,
consists of a very fine sand stone, equal, if not superior, for
building, to what is generally found in the vicinity of
Sydney.</p>

<p><font size="4">The natives, it would seem from their tracks,
are here numerous. Kangaroos are becoming plentiful; they succeed
in killing one, as also a yellow snake.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thermometer at sunrise, 50 deg.; at noon 80
deg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, November 16.--Soon after sunrise they
re-commence their journey, and having proceeded three miles and a
half S. (the land gradually sloping as they advanced), arrive
suddenly on the banks of a fine river.* This was named "The
Hume."</font></p>

<p>* Mr. Hume having first discovered it, but since named by
Captain Sturt, the Murray, after Sir George Murray; see appendix,
No. Both Mr. Hume and Mr. Hovell, had anticipated the early
appearance of a river in this direction; from the opinion that
the large bodies of water which they had of late continually
encountered, though all pursuing a southerly, or even an easterly
course, would, from the apparently impenetrable barrier which is
presented by the South Australian Alps to the eastward, ere long
revert to the westward, and thus become distributed to the
interior.</p>

<p><font size="4">This beautiful stream is found to be not less
than eighty yards in breadth, apparently of considerable depth;
the current about three miles an hour; the water, for so
considerable a current, clear.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The river itself is serpentine, the banks
clothed with verdure to the water's edge; their general height
various, but seldom either more or less than eight or nine feet,
inclined, or precipitous, as they happen, by the bendings of the
stream, to be more or less exposed to the action of the current.
On each side of the river is a perpetual succession of lagoons,
extending generally in length from one to two miles, and about a
quarter of a mile in breadth. These, which are situate
alternately on each side of the river, within those elbows or
projections which are formed by its windings, often for miles
together, preclude any approach to its banks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Each of these lagoons was furnished with an
inlet from the river, and an outlet into it; the former
invariably at its higher or eastern, and the latter at its lower
or western extremity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The form of the lagoons is most frequently a
crescent; the line of their course being at first divergent from,
but ultimately convergent to, the stream. The spaces between the
lagoons and the river--sometimes of more than a mile in
breadth--are, however, irregular, as well in form as in size.
These interspaces partly consist of swamps and unsound ground,
which even when dry, although seemingly passable by man, are
impassable, or at least unsafe, for cattle. In general these
spots are thickly wooded (the trees consisting principally of the
blue gum, mostly of a large growth), are overgrown with vines of
various descriptions, and the fern, the peppermint, flax-plant,
and currajong. The fern, the currajong, and the flax, flourish
here in abundance; and the peppermint plant, (which they had not
seen in any other part of the Colony) seems to surpass, both in
odour and taste, the species that is generally produced in our
gardens. From the flax plant the natives, as they afterwards
discovered, make their fishing lines, and the nets which they use
for carrying their travelling gear and provisions.*</font></p>

<p>* The river abounds with that species of cod fish which is
common in all the western rivers. In the lagoons they caught a
kind of bream or carp, of the weight of about two pounds, and of
the finest possible flavour. The lagoons are literally crowded
with wild ducks, and in the muddy bottom near the banks, is
plenty of large muscles; these are inferior to those found in
salt water; the natives dive for them in the same manner as they
procure the mud-oyster near Sydney, and these, with the fish
caught in the river, seem to form the principal part of their
food.</p>

<p>Their method of fishing is as follows: they select the outlet
from a lagoon, which generally consists of a little stream of
about two feet deep, and of about five or six feet broad. Across
this, at no great distance from its junction with the river, they
form a palisade with small stakes, which are driven firmly into
the mud, and then carefully interwoven with wattles. Beyond this
palisade, at the distance of five or six feet higher up the
stream, they form a similar palisade, but leave an opening midway
in its length, of about two feet wide. A dam being thus prepared,
the natives go into the lagoon, where it is sufficiently shallow
for their purpose, and beating the water with their wattles, and
disturbing it in every possible way, drive the fish before them
into the dam, which on being sufficiently full, is immediately
closed, the fish in consequence falling an easy prize. The
natives near Western Port, use also the bark of a species of
willow, which is thrown into the water, and produces on the fish
the same effects as the coculus indicus. Near the river, they
found the skin of a very large black snake, the original
proprietor of which, could not have been less than eight feet
long, the skin in its present shrivelled state being fall six
feet. The bell bird is common here, and they afterwards met with
the pelican.</p>

<p><font size="4">Unable to devise any means of crossing the
river, and in the hope of discovering some practicable ford, they
now commence their progress (to the westward) down the stream;
proceed three miles and a half, and then halt. At half past two
they resume their route, but are soon compelled, from the
continual succession of lagoon and swamp, to retire to some
higher land, about two miles from the river. Here they travel
(nearly in the same direction) about three miles, when they
again, at four o'clock, encounter the river, at the foot of a
conical hill; where they remain for the night. This hill is
similar in form to those which have already been noticed. The
internal composition, however, appears to be different,
consisting (as it should seem from the specimens of it produced,
and which were all derived from nearly the summit of the hill) of
proportions; 1<i>st,</i> of rag-stone; 2<i>dly,</i> of
quartz-mica; 3<i>dly,</i> of an extraordinary specimen of
granite, consisting chiefly of quartz; these were found in
different parts of the hill: the rag-stone, and the quartz-mica,
a few feet from each other, and the granite in a spot somewhat
lower down.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the summit of this hill, there is a fine
view of the river, which appearing and disappearing, in its
perpetual windings, is visible to the westward about seven or
eight miles; and excepting this addition, the view here is the
same, or at least consists of nearly the same objects, changed
more or less in appearance, by change in point of sight, as that
from Battery-mount. At a short distance beyond the furthest spot
where the river is visible, there is another conical hill, but
one of the sides of which (apparently as if a portion of it had
been cut away) is perpendicular and flat, like a wall. Beyond
this remarkable object, not a hill is to be seen, and the country
between the points S W. and N W. up to the barrier collateral
ranges, is one continuous flat, studded with trees, gradually but
constantly sloping in the direction of the opening between those
ranges. This opening, which bore due west from Battery-mount, now
bears W N W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A large clear space in this immense forest
(bearing W N W. distant about fifteen miles), they name "Fennel's
Plains," after the late Lieut. Fennel. Smoke, supposed to be that
of the natives' fires is seen, but at a less distance, in the
same direction. Eastwardly are the bluff extremities of several
collateral ranges, which proceeding from the main, or N. and S.
range, in a winding course, advance various distances, into the
low or flat country.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The extremities of none of these ranges appear
to be nearer than seven miles, and some of them considerably more
distant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The main range is not here visible, being, most
probably, concealed by the tortuous collateral
branches.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, November 17.--Messrs. Hovell and
Hume take with them two of the men, and proceed seven miles
further down the stream, still in search of some practicable
crossing place, but without success, the stream becoming, as they
advance, of somewhat increased magnitude; its banks more
beautifully regular, and perhaps somewhat higher than what they
had been before observed. The lagoons are nearly the same, and in
consequence of which circumstance, it was possible only twice to
approach the river. The soil, the trees,* the herbage, similar,
but perhaps superior. There were no marks of floods; should the
banks, however, become at any time inundated, the land, at a
little distance, is sufficiently high to afford perfect security
from such an occurrence.</font></p>

<p>* Viz. on the banks of the river, the blue-gum, and at a
distance from the banks, where the soil is not so good, the box,
the white-gum, and the stringy-bark, but there was no swamp-oak,
the tree so universal, on the rivers to the northward and
eastward.</p>

<p><font size="4">At four o'clock the party had returned to the
tent, having determined on proceeding on the morrow in the
contrary direction, (up the river), in quest of the same
object.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They have not taken a kangaroo since Monday
last, nor have they seen an emu since their departure from
"Swampy Valley." The total distance travelled to-day, is fourteen
miles; viz. seven miles westerly (down the river), and the same
distance on their return.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, November 18.--They travel about seven
miles (eastwardly) up the river, when they fall in with their own
track, at the place where they had first discovered the river on
Tuesday last (the 10th). They now proceed S E. three miles; here
the river takes a sweep to the E N E. There was at this time some
distant thunder, and at four o'clock a violent storm of wind and
rain, not far from them, accompanied with some heavy
thunder-claps; this, though it passed off, induced them to stop,
and they halted for the night, in consequence, at the extremity
of a very beautiful flat. To-day they had travelled, by the
perambulator, twelve miles; but, in a direct line, they are not
more than three miles to the eastward of the spot at which they
had first discovered the river.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, November 19th.--They resume their
route, (which they commenced the day before yesterday,) up the
river (to the eastward).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The general appearance of the country, together
with that of the soil, is rich and beautiful. The grass having
apparently been burnt early in the season, and being now in full
seed, is fresh and luxuriant, frequently as high as their heads,
and seldom lower than their waists. On both sides of the river,
the "bell-birds" are "ringing merrily", a treat hitherto unusual,
this being only the second time, that they have met with this
delightful bird since their departure from the
Cowpastures.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fish and ducks are still abundant; they also
meet with two black swans in the course of the day, the first
they had seen on their journey.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">About six miles from the place of their
starting this morning, they observed a small islet of rock, lying
nearly in the middle of the river; this consisted of a coarse
granite, and lay in perpendicular ridges, N E. and S W. Four
miles Eastwardly from this spot, at the foot of a high forest
range, the stream suddenly narrows, and is in some places reduced
to the breadth of little more than forty yards; this was
attributed to their probable advance beyond the junction of some
important branch, and which they might have passed without notice
at the considerable distance from the river, at which they were
frequently compelled to travel. Here, having determined on making
the attempt to cross the river at this spot, they halt for the
night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The distance travelled to-day, measured by the
perambulator, is ten miles, but which in a direct line, would not
exceed seven.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, November 20th.--Weather fine, and
extremely pleasant; this morning they cross the river: this they
effect by means of a temporary boat,* hastily constructed (of
wicker, covered with the tarpauling) for the occasion, and by
four in the afternoon, every thing, including the cattle, had
been landed on the opposite bank. At five, they left the banks of
the stream, travelled two miles and a half before dark, and then
halted on a patch of fine forest land.</font></p>

<p>* Mr. Hovell had endeavoured to escape, in a similarly
constructed vessel, some years before, from a situation of much
danger, on the occasion of being wrecked on the western island,
of Kent's groupe, in Bass's Straits.</p>

<p><font size="4">The stream here, is furnished with a series of
creeks, lagoons, and swamps, similar to those so lately observed
and described. The back land is excellent, superior perhaps to
that on the northern or right bank; the grass proportionately
good.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, November 21st.--They start at the
usually early hour, when having travelled one mile and a half,
(four from the last stream,) among the usual series of lagoon,
swamp and creek, they arrive on the banks of a sixth river. The
breadth of this at the water's edge, was one hundred and ten
feet, and the current as strong, as that of the former stream,
but not so deep, the cattle therefore crossed with little
difficulty, though it was necessary to construct a boat for the
supplies. By noon, they had passed the river, when after
extricating themselves from the usual series of lagoon, swamp,
and creek, they resume their route, passing S. westerly, over the
extremities of a range of hills, a collateral branch of the great
N. and S. Alpine chain, from the Southern aspect of which, they
perceive a fresh series of lagoon, swamp and creek, and at the
short distance of only four or five miles from the last, arrive
on the banks of another small river, similar in size and other
respects to the former.* The banks of the last two streams, are
not more than six feet in height, and there is every reason to
believe, that during floods, these streams uniting with their
lagoons, form immense sheets of water. The bottom of the former
stream, consists of an excavation from the solid granite, the bed
of the latter, was formed of rounded pebbles.</font></p>

<p>* All these streams are of about the same size, and their
currents nearly the same. This and the latter two, we doubt join
the Hume.</p>

<p><font size="4">The natives, from the appearance of their
fires, seem to be numerous, though none were seen. Two handsome
large birds, termed by the Colonists, "Natives' Companions" were
shot to-day, and some ducks. In the river, they caught some of
the Lachlan codfish, and in the ponds, a kind of fish, similar to
carp.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, November 22.--Noon warm, morning and
evening cool and pleasant. This morning they crossed the river,
availing themselves of an immense tree that lay extended from
bank to bank, and which with a rope stretched along it as a hand
rope, formed a tolerably good bridge. The cattle are now so
accustomed to the water that they pass without either reluctance
or difficulty, roped together lengthwise, so that as the hindmost
is entering the water, the headmost is coming out of it, at the
opposite side. By half past eight they had completed the passage
of the river, and had soon afterwards again started, when they
advance about five miles south west between two ranges of hills.
They now rest. In the afternoon they proceed ten miles and a half
in the same direction, and then halt for the night. The country,
traversed in the former part of this day's journey, was of the
same description as that which they had passed yesterday; the
grasses equally fine, and the wild flax, both in height and
luxuriance, far superior. The latter portion of the journey lay
over a hilly forest land, generally not good, many of the trees
bore the marks of iron tomahawks. Killed a kangaroo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, November 23.--The bullocks and horses
having strayed, they started this morning somewhat later than
usual; when, in the short distance of only three miles, having
had to traverse the ends of several ranges of hills, they arrive
at a fine forest. The grass good, the land excellent, and thinly
wooded, with timber trees of the most valuable description,
chiefly the stringy-bark and the box gum. Along this fine country
they advance about three miles and a half, then stop near a
spring. At three in the afternoon they resume their journey, and
having travelled five miles and a half, (in all twelve miles),
rest for the night near the extremity of a high range. The soil
of the ranges bad; that of the level country, intermediate
between them, invariably excellent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The soil to the westward resembles much that
about Battery-mount; the land low, with scarcely a hill. South
westerly are seen the terminations of several collateral ranges,
and to the eastward are observed numerous mountains, part of the
Alps.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As they approach the mountains, as usual on
those occasions, the flies and musquitoes are again becoming
troublesome; to escape from which they are glad to submit to a
state of half suffocation from smoke. The horses too are
literally crippled from want of shoes.* The thermometer, at
sunset, 62 deg.; at noon, 72 deg. Killed two snakes, both of a
dark brown colour.</font></p>

<p>* On such journeys as these, there ought to be one or two
mechanics--a blacksmith, with spare shoes and nails, and a
harness maker.</p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, November 24.--At sunrise it was
threatening rain; but about nine o'clock the weather cleared up
and became warm, although it was then blowing strongly from the
S. West. They started about six, travelled the first five miles
south west, (through a forest country lying nearly parallel with
the mountains) when they came to a creek. They now ascend in
their way a high hill, on the northern aspect of which, as well
as on that of another hill at a little distance, there was not a
tree, although in every other direction, up to their very
summits, both these hills were thickly wooded. This hill proved
to be part of a dividing range, whence they obtain a fine
view--of mountains to the eastward, supposed to be a continuation
of the "South Australian Alps;" of the country through which they
have just travelled to the northward; of a country to the
westward, similar to that described on the 17th instant, and of
an opening to the southward, through which they propose passing.
The stream or creek last noticed passes out, most probably,
through this opening. The entire space to the eastward, up to the
very mountains, consists of an open forest country, indented
along its centre by the course of the creek. The grass every
where is quite withered, the land parched, and the creek nearly
dry. At ten they halt on its banks;--they had travelled this
morning seven miles and a quarter. At four they resume their
march through a pleasant level country. The pasturage fine, some
of it excellent, and in a moderately good state. Four miles and a
quarter from the spot from which they had last started, they
arrive at the north or right bank of another (the 8th) river.
This stream, at its usual height, must be somewhat wider than
either of the last mentioned; and the banks too are evidently at
times flooded. The water is now low;--there are attached to it
the usual series of lagoon, swamp, and creek. The banks and all
the neighbouring country (which is extremely beautiful) consist
of the finest possible soil; scantily wooded, but with timber
trees of the most valuable description. The river comes from the
eastern chain of mountains, and very probably joins the Hume,
though perhaps at a considerable distance to the westward. They
name this river the "Ovens," after the deceased Major Ovens, the
late Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane's Private
Secretary.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, November 25.--Little difficulty was
experienced in crossing the "Ovens," the water being so low, that
it was found fordable in several places. The ford at which they
passed was only three feet deep, and the bottom pebbly, so that
although there was a considerable current, they were enabled to
cross with the cattle laden. The banks of this river, are
somewhat higher than those of the last two, and they appear less
liable to floods.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The wild flax, (which is very similar to that
of commerce,) grows here in profusion, generally about six feet
high, also the native honeysuckle, and the grass-tree, both of
which, (a circumstance by no means usual,) seem here to denote a
good soil. At the hills near the "Murrumbidgee" as well as in the
"Limestone-valley" the same circumstance was observable. Four
miles and a half from the "Ovens" they reach the summits of a
range, whence they obtain a view of that river, coming from East
by North, and evidently deriving its waters, from part of the
"Alpine Chain." One of these snowcapped mountains, is now in
sight, bearing South East, distant about twenty miles, there is
also a singularly formed mountain, in the same direction, but
much nearer, which from its shape, they name "Mount Buffalo;'' a
fine level country is observable to the Westward, commencing at
the distance of about five miles, and in some directions
particularly to the N W. extending in unbroken tenor, to the
utmost boundary of the horizon; to the southward of west, at a
considerable distance, there is a range which extends in the
directions, South East, and North West, at the distance of about
eight or ten miles, some plains also are observed, situate most
probably on the banks of the "Ovens" these they designate
"Oxley's Plains" after the late Mr. Oxley, Surveyor General of
the Territory. All the country in their line of route to-day, had
been burned, and a little to the Westward of this line, the grass
was still blazing to a considerable height. At noon having
travelled seven miles, they rest near some water holes, on a
small plot of good grass, which had most fortunately escaped the
ravages of the flames. At four they renew their route, and soon
afterwards arrive on the banks of a fine creek running to the
northward, having in their way been obliged to cross the western
terminations of several ranges of hills.* Some of these hills are
covered with a kind of scrub, and some consist of large masses of
rock piled fantastically, as if by art, on each other. The
crossing of these ranges was dreadfully distressing to the
cattle. A little before sunset they pitched their tent near some
water holes. The grass good. The natives evidently
numerous.</font></p>

<p>* In order to avoid too much westing, lest the object of their
journey, their reaching Western Port (Port Phillip) should thus
become frustrated.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, November 26.--They start this morning
at half past five, and proceed S W. by S. with a range of forest
hills on their right hand, (to the westward) in the direction of
a hill, of which they had taken the bearings yesterday. The land
immediately under this range is good, the grass excellent, the
trees consist of a fine description of the gum and a species of
manna tree. Having advanced about a mile and a half, they arrive
on the banks of a fine creek; and about half a mile further reach
another creek. These they crossed without difficulty, the latter
at a convenient ford; the banks of this stream are not more than
five or six feet in height, the breadth of the stream between
twenty and thirty feet, and the current scarcely perceptible,
excepting in those places where there are falls--it is now very
low. This small stream, which they designated "Oxley's Creek,"
comes from the southward, and most probably, though at a
considerable distance, joins the Ovens. Four miles and a quarter
from Oxley's Creek, they arrive on the summits of another range
of hills, whence they obtain a fine view to the northward and
westward of a beautiful level open country, consisting of good
and apparently even now of fresh pasturage, interspersed here and
there with small plains or meadows. Hence, for a distance of
seven miles, they continue crossing the western extremities of
several stoney ranges, collateral branches of the mountains to
the eastward, then come to another creek, proceeding most
probably to pour its waters into the one which they had last
encountered--here they remain till four o'clock. Two miles and a
half distant from this spot (or ten from that of their departure
this morning) they arrive at the top of a high hill; which, from
the fine prospect that it affords, they name "Mount Belle-vue."
The principal objects observed from this spot were--1st, A very
extensive plain, bearing N. 10 deg. W. at the supposed distance
of about twenty miles, and which they named after Mr. Alexander
Berry, of Sydney, one of the most zealous advisers of the
journey, "Berry's Plains." 2ndly, The two small plains, seen
yesterday, bearing N. 15 deg. east. 3rdly, A fine level country,
extending from N E. to 10 deg. W. and bounded between those
points only by the horizon. 4thly, An unvaried succession of the
most broken and mountainous regions imaginable, extending from
the points south east to north east. In the direction south east,
on the top of one of these mountains, there is a large sterile
rock, much like that of the "Pigeon House," a well-known coast
mountain to the southward. The country from south to south west,
also is mountainous; but to the northward and westward (excepting
a few ranges, which they expect to cross to-morrow) the country
appears level. Mount Belle-vue from the foot, half way up to its
summit, consists of sterile rocks, of which the strata, observing
a vertical position, extend north and south.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Towards the summit, where the rock appears to
contain a portion of lime, the soil and herbage are both
excellent; the trees here also are large, and in addition to
those before mentioned they meet with the honey suckle and the
wattle. Thence they descend to the banks of another creek, where
they remain the night, having travelled to-day thirteen miles and
a half. Thermometer, at sunrise, 46; at noon, 88.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, November 27.--They start at six,
weather at first threatening rain, but soon clearing up, and
becoming oppressively sultry; proceed S W. about six miles,
crossing in that short distance no less than five successive
ranges near their western terminations, when the whole party,
both men and cattle, being literally exhausted by fatigue and
heat, they halt (at ten) near a run of water; but, on a spot
where there was scarcely a blade of grass to be found. At four
they resume their route and cross an extensive range, in
effecting which the cattle are completely lamed. They halt, in
consequence, at its foot; and where, happening to find a small
supply of fodder for the cattle, they remain the
night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While crossing one of these creeks, the bank
fell in, by which accident one of the horses was thrown into the
water, though, excepting its lading, which consisted of
provisions, without sustaining any injury.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This place appears, from the tracks that are
observed, to be the resort of the kangaroo, but none are seen;
and, even in the event of meeting any, the dogs are in so
miserably famished a state, that they would be utterly unable to
run them down. The creeks lately met with, all flow to the north
west.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, November 28.--The scanty supply of
grass on the spot, where they remained the night, being all
consumed, they start early this morning to forage for the cattle;
proceed south west, and soon arrive on the summits of a range.
Here they obtain an extensive view to the N W. consisting of a
level country interspersed, as usual, with plains; of a small
plain or meadow to the S W. and beyond this of mountainous ranges
extending completely across their proposed line of route. Having
descended this range, they cross a swamp which had been mistaken
for a meadow, proceed four miles and then halt on a small patch
of good grass. This, like all the other spaces of any extent,
lying intermediately between the ranges, consists of a kind of
meadow, divided along its centre by a small but rapid stream, is
somewhat swampy, and in places near the water produces reeds. The
ranges, as they recede to the N. West, subside gradually, until
eventually they terminate in a level country.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">These meadows they named "Norton's Meadows;"
and a conical mount, situate at the extremity of the range to the
northward, "Norton's Mount," after Mr. James Norton, of
Sydney.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The hill which they had descended in the
morning was designated "Sunday Mount."</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the evening the men attempt to hunt, and
meet with several kangaroos; but the dogs are utterly unable to
run them down. The natives hereabouts are evidently numerous, as
they conclude, from their fires, the smoke of which is observed
in every direction. Yesterday their voices were distinctly heard,
but none of them could be seen. Latitude, by double altitude, 38
deg. 38.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, November 29.--Last night the
thermometer stood at 46 deg.; to day, at noon, it had risen to 86
deg. in the shade. They start early, their course as nearly south
west as the character of the country would permit. The land and
timber which they observed to-day, were in general of an
excellent quality, some of the soil of a pure scarlet colour and
the stones nearly the same. The trees consist chiefly of the
honeysuckle, the manna-tree, and the Cowpasture-box. Having
travelled five miles and a half, they cross a creek running to
the northward and westward, on the bank of which they rest; at
four they cross another range, the whole of this range appears to
have suffered by some violent explosive operation of nature. The
rocks a coarse granite, lying or standing in the utmost
confusion, in every possible direction; this range they descend
in the direction S W. then cross another range and soon
afterwards arrive at a second creek flowing also to the N W. on
the bank of which they remain the night--grass
abundant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, November 30.--They journey this
morning between two ranges of hills in a south west direction,
five miles and a half, then halt, start again at two (afternoon)
and having proceeded two miles and a half arrive by four o'clock
on the summit of a range of hills extending in the directions S
E. and N W. Having descended this range, they travel southerly
ten miles and a half, and then stop for the night; their progress
to-day being about eighteen miles and a half.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the foot up to the summits of these ranges
the soil, the basis of which is granite, is good. The trees which
they met with to-day consisted of the white gum, the
stringy-bark, and the black butted gum, remarkably straight and
unusually lofty. As usual, when among mountains, the small fly,
so frequently noticed, has again become a great torment, and
where the soil is light and loose, their route is perpetually
interrupted with the burrows of the wombat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, December 1st.--At daylight the
thermometer was standing at 41, just previously the weather had
been felt uncomfortably cold; a circumstance which they had
attributed partly to their present exposed and unusually elevated
situation, partly to the prevalence of a south west wind. The
weather which had of late been threatening rain, has now become
fine. Before they descend the heights, they take advantage of an
eminence, to obtain a view of the surrounding country. Towards
the east, was observed a flat forest country, apparently divided
by a river; three several plains were also seen in this
direction, the nearest of which seemed to be distant about four
miles, the most distant about twelve, these plains appeared to be
encircled with mountains in which there was a gap or chasm, the
outlet most probably of some river. From S E. to south, the
country is extremely rugged and broken, and it is only in the
direction N W. that it appears favorable for their future
progress. One mile from the spot where they commenced their
descent, from the heights, they were compelled to unload the
cattle in order to cross a creek, they then ascend and descend
another range, when having travelled four miles and a half, in
the direction S W. they arrive at another creek. Two of the dogs
had left them in the course of the morning in chase of a
kangaroo, and they were induced in consequence to halt at this
spot, while some of the men were sent in quest of them, but who
returned about sunset unsuccessful; their swiftest dog had also
been absent but had returned wounded, and they had therefore but
one dog remaining and this in a state of weakness and exhaustion
from which it was not likely to recover.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, December 2.--This morning they are
agreeably surprised by the appearance of one of the dogs that had
been missing, but had returned sometime in the night slightly
hurt, as they supposed by a kangaroo. At half past five (morning)
they leave their resting place, and having proceeded two miles
come to a meadow, divided along its centre by a creek. Hence they
proceed five miles and a half S W. through a good forest country,
when they are compelled to stop, the natives having fired the
grass in their advance, and it being therefore doubtful whether
they would be enabled to procure fodder for the cattle, if they
left this spot, where there was abundance of grass and good
water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Soon after they had halted, the second dog that
had been missing rejoined them, bearing on him evident marks of
his having killed some animal, and by the side of which both of
them, no doubt, had been lying until they had satisfactorily
regaled themselves. About two o'clock they resume their route;
the weather being pleasant for travelling, and the smoke and fire
no longer impeding their advance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From the summit of a hill, about a mile from
the spot whence they had started, they again observe the gap in
the mountains, which on Tuesday bore S E. by S. and now seems to
offer to them a favourable passage; it had still, as when first
observed, every appearance of being the outlet of some river.
Hither therefore they directed their course, and having ascended
some ranges, found the country improved as they advanced. It was
however mostly burnt, and therefore not seen to much advantage;
near sunset they reach a spot of about two acres in extent, on
which the grass had fortunately escaped the ravages of the
flames, and here they remained the night, not far from a creek.
In all these creeks, where the stream was not strong, they found
leeches of a large size, and apparently fit for medical purposes.
They had travelled to-day, on the whole, thirteen
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, December 3.--Proceeding S W. in the
course of the creek twelve or thirteen miles, they arrive, as
they had expected, on the banks of another river. The country
along its sides is extremely beautiful, clothed with a luxuriant
herbage, and both hill and lowland thinly wooded.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The river they cross, as on a former occasion,
by means of a large tree which lay extended from bank to bank.
But the access to the water for the cattle is somewhat difficult;
the banks being, at least, twelve feet in height and
perpendicular. The river has appended to it the usual series of
creeks and lagoons, and in some places (particularly on the N. or
right bank) the terminations of some high ranges come down so
close to the water, that there is no practicable pass, at least
for cattle. On the banks of this river they remain the night, and
prepare for passing it in the morning. Some fish are caught, in
the course of the evening, similar to those in the Lachlan; and
they kill a kangaroo. This river has been named "the
Hovell."*</font></p>

<p>* Originally the Goulburn, after the late Colonial Secretary.
But as there was, though unknown at the time to Messrs. Hume and
Hovell, another stream named after that gentleman, to prevent
confusion, this river was subsequently named by Captain Sturt,
and Mr. Hume as above.</p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, December 4.--By ten (forenoon) the
passage of the Hovell had been completed; the cattle, as usual on
these occasions, having had to cross it by swimming, and as soon
as they had become extricated from the extensive swamps and
creeks, which extended from its banks backwards nearly a mile,
they ascend a range, the foot of which is contiguous to a creek,
evidently a tributary to the Hovell. They now continue their
journey in the direction S W. through an agreeable and
picturesque country; the soil good, and the grass though
withered, abundant, studded with here and there a tree, just
sufficient to afford shelter for cattle. From a hill about four
miles distant from the river, they note the gap or chasm, before
mentioned bearing N. by W. distant about eighteen miles; a hill
which they named "Mount Throsby," after the late Mr. Throsby,
Member of Council, N. 30 E. distant about five miles; Mount
Meehan, named after the late Mr. James Meehan, Deputy Surveyor
General of the Territory, the same distance as the last, about
east; a high peak bearing S. by East, distant about sixteen
miles, and a somewhat lofty range bearing S W. distant about
twenty miles, and which they are desirous of reaching.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Seven miles from the Hovell they arrive on the
banks of an other stream. This which is considerably smaller than
the former they themselves pass with the luggage, by means of a
tree and the cattle by swimming, though not without some
difficulty and risque from the channel being choaked with broken
trees, the depth of the water and the muddiness of the banks,
from which last circumstance they named it "Muddy
Creek."</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One mile from the South or the left bank of
this creek, they arrive on the borders of a forest, where they
remain the night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The forest land situate between the Hovell and
the last stream, Mr. Hume named "Meehan's Forest." They noticed
to-day some wattle-trees, that were covered with a parasitic
plant the leaves of which though smaller and more closely
arranged much resembled those of the peach-tree, also a species
of gum-tree that was new to them, this was in full flower, and
remarkably beautiful.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A finer country for sheep cannot exist than
that in the vicinity of the "Hovell."</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, December 5th.--Last night was the first
that for some time they had found too warm, a circumstance which
was attributed to the grass in every direction around them being
on fire; the thermometer at daylight was however no higher than
65, though at noon, it was standing at 90, in the
shade.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To-day, they halt, a matter of no small relief,
to the men and cattle, they being almost alike unable to
proceed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Several fish similar to those found in the
Lachlan were caught in the course of the day, and two of the men
proceeded in quest of a dog that was missing, their swiftest and
best, but who returned unsuccessful about dark. Latitude by
double altitude, 37. 8. S.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, December 6th.--For six miles together
they continue crossing several ranges, and eventually ascend one
of considerable height, proceed southerly, along its summits some
distance, descend its western aspect with the intention of
halting to breakfast, but can procure no water, and are compelled
therefore to resume their journey, when after having travelled
about six miles, completing twelve in all, and passing in their
way several dry creeks, all of which had a westerly course, and
ascending and descending a second somewhat lofty range, at two
o'clock (afternoon,) they halt, having at length, fortunately
discovered a small supply of that indispensable object of which
they were in quest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Their journey to-day, has been through an
intricate broken country, overrun with brushwood with little or
no good land excepting here and there in the hollows, this would
doubtless have been avoided, had they observed only a somewhat
more westerly route, a little further from the mountains, where
the country appeared both clear and grassy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The flax plant where the soil is good, is here
abundant, also the lucern, and burnet, and a species of vine, the
same as that which is found at Bathurst, and upon which the sheep
feed in winter. The tree which is peculiar to Lake Bathurst,
(somewhat similar to the native oak,) is also common here, and on
the banks of the Hovell, another species of tree, which Mr. Hume
recognized as the willow* of the colony, a very beautiful tree,
especially at this season of the year. Near the tent, are some
trees similar to the forest oak, which grows about Parramatta,
and abundance of the Indigo Plant, to which sheep and cattle are
particularly partial. To-day, for the first time since the 22nd
of October, when they were at the Murrumbidgee, they experienced
a fine fall of rain.</font></p>

<p>* This, which is common in Van Diemen's Land; is found only in
good soil, and is there called the black wood.</p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, December 7th.--Proceed two miles and a
half S W. across some ranges, and then come to a creek, which
derives its waters from the mountains to the eastward; the stream
strong, the bottom pebbly, and the waters evidently subject to
occasional and very considerable risings. This they name the
"King Parrot Creek," having observed here for the first time
during their journey the bird of that name. They now ascend a
very high stony range, lying in about the directions N W. and S
E. a most toilsome task for the cattle. By nine they arrive on
its summits, when they find to their great disappointment that
they have to descend its S W. aspect, there being no connecting
range, between this and another range, which is of yet greater
height, running parallel with it, in their advance. They descend
accordingly and having rested about two hours, commence climbing
the next range, when after two hours toil, they arrive on the
summits* of this also. Here, however, they find themselves
completely at a stand, without clue or guide as to the direction
in which they are to proceed; the brush wood so thick that it was
impossible to see before them in any direction ten yards. They
proceed therefore a mile and a quarter by guess, with two men
ahead, cutting a route through the brush for the cattle. During
this operation they were overtaken by night, and compelled to
halt, utterly unable to proceed one step further: here, without
water or grass, or a spot on which to rest (from the stony and
rugged character of the surface,) men and cattle have to pass the
night. From the summits of this range, the principal objects
observed were a plain bearing N. by E. distant about four miles,
and pursuing its course along the centre of this plain, the "King
Parrot Creek." The plain is not very broad, of the length they
were not enabled to judge. The "King Parrot Creek," no doubt
joins the Hovell, about west from the spot at which they had
crossed it. They were enabled to travel to-day only eight miles S
W. by W. On the range they found the land-leech. This animal
bites with an avidity equal to that of the water-leech. The flies
and musquitoes are again extremely troublesome, and in addition
the tic.</font></p>

<p>* Part of a range, which they afterwards name the Jullion
Range.</p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, December 8.--After a miserable
night, anxious to remove with as little delay as possible from
the causes of their discomfort, they were this morning stirring
before it was day light, when proceeding one mile and a quarter
in a southerly course across the range, cutting their way as they
went, they at length found their further progress in this
direction impracticable; both from the almost impenetrable kind
of brush wood which they had to encounter, and from the immense
quantity of dead timber that every where strewed the ground, as
well as from the stony nature of the range itself, by which the
cattle were completely crippled. They now therefore descend the
range in an easterly direction, and in their return to King
Parrot Creek, when near the bottom of the range have the good
fortune to meet with a fine run of water, an object equally
desirable to themselves and to the cattle, who had been eighteen
hours without any. About nine they cross the King Parrot Creek;
and, in the course of the afternoon, arrive at a spot where they
halt, within about two miles from that at which they had crossed
the same creek yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On some portions of the summits of the range,
which they had just left, the soil was bad. The stones hard and
of a fine grain, and here the trees were less lofty than usual in
these regions; but in one spot, where the stones consisted
entirely of a coarse granite, the soil on the contrary was
extremely good, and the trees of an extraordinary height and
girth. These too were of various kinds, and among them were some
of a species of light timber lofty and straight, and therefore
particularly fit for ships spars. These were found on the eastern
aspect of the range. Messrs. Hovell and Hume now propose to
themselves the following plan: to make a fresh attempt on foot to
cross the range in a south westerly direction, and if successful
to return for the cattle and persevere in pursuing that course
until next Saturday se'nnight, by which time should the country
yet appear unfavorable for the further prosecution of their
original design, as they will then have left flour enough only
for five weeks consumption, they purpose returning, and
completing the outward journey by an examination, as far as
circumstances may permit, of the course of the Hovell. The hoofs
of the horses are sadly broken, and the feet of the cattle are so
swollen, that they are at present unfit for travelling,
particularly their finest bullock, the leader.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The natives here are in the habit of extracting
grubs from the trees (a practice of which they had seen no trace
since their leaving the Murrumbidgee). This had in one instance
been done with an iron tomahawk.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, December 9th.--Agreeably to their
proposed plan Messrs. Hovell and Hume start this morning at an
early hour provided with provisions, except animal food, for four
days. Animal food they had none not even kangaroo, for although
they had seen several of these animals, they had not been able to
capture any in consequence of the loss of some of their dogs, and
the wretched condition of the rest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Proceeding in a South Westerly direction about
seven o'clock they were ascending a mountain, (part of the same
range* they had ascended yesterday) which from the repulse they
subsequently experienced, they afterwards named "Mount
Disappointment," at ten they arrive at the top, and crossing
their track of yesterday, commence descending its western aspect;
two hours they were employed in scrambling literally on their
hands and knees over brush and rock, when having advanced about
two miles they halt, (at noon,) near a small spring; they then
renew their efforts, when to add to their difficulties, they had
the misfortune to encounter that species of long grass, which is
known in the colony by the name of the "cutting grass," this was
between four and five feet high, the blade of it an inch and a
half broad, and the edges exquisitely sharp, and fine enough to
inflict a severe wound. It is a similar plant to that of the same
name, which is found in the Illawarra district. Uncertain of
their route, fatigued, themselves lacerated and their clothes
torn at every step, it had at length become literally
impracticable to proceed, they now therefore return towards the
tent, and remain the night near a small spring, after having
succeeded in penetrating four miles into this dreadful scrub, and
advanced fourteen from their station in the morning. In this
scrub they found the turtine, the fern, and sassafras tree. The
mountain leech was common, and the tic; which burying itself in
the flesh, becomes destructive to the lower classes of animals.
Pheasants they had heard, but had not seen any. The timber as
they advance to the southward, is observed to be gradually of a
finer appearance, but that which they met with on the mountain, a
species of black butted-gum infinitely surpasses all that they
had seen hitherto.</font></p>

<p>* The Jullion.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, December 10th.--They start at sunrise,
and at nine o'clock reach their tent, the shelter of which after
their late excessive fatigues was highly acceptable. At two the
whole party again proceed on their journey, and following the
course of the "King Parrot Creek," pass along the plain of which
they had taken the bearings the day before yesterday. This plain
is a mile long, and half a mile in breadth. They travel to-day on
the whole from their tent station of this morning, seven
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The country traversed to-day, consisted of hill
and dale, both of which become more and more scantily wooded in
proportion as they recede from the mountains. The hills were
observed to be stony and somewhat sterile, and the soil in
general not very fine though producing a good sheep pasturage.
Near their tent some rocks were observed containing a small
proportion of lime; a similar kind of stone has also been met
with in the bottom of the "King Parrot Creek," the latter a
portion of some rocks having a vertical position, and extending
in the directions E S E. and W N W. the former was found in
irregular masses. Two lobsters were caught in the creek, where
they seemed numerous, but no other kind of fish.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The country from "Muddy Creek," up to "Mount
Disappointment," and from their tent station of this morning to
the Hovell, they named after Saxe Bannister, Esquire, late
Attorney General of the Colony, "Bannister's Forest."</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, December 11th.--This morning they
continue their progress about W N W. along the course of the
creek six miles and a half, and then breakfast. At four
(afternoon) they again start and leave the creek in the direction
west, when having proceeded only about one mile and a half they
are compelled to return, the whole of the country in this
direction being on fire, and a sudden change of wind blowing both
blaze and smoke full in their faces.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The country traversed consists of poor land,
intermixed here and there with patches of a mountain brush, and
on the immediate borders of the creek there is an irregular but
generally narrow slip of good soil. The extent of which, however,
increases as they advance. The country at a distance is all in
flames, and the nature of its soil cannot therefore be
ascertained.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Two kangaroos were killed to-day, and they
caught a couple of Lachlan cod fish and destroyed a large black
snake.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, December 12.--Desirous during the
absence of the breeze, which they expected would return at
sunrise, of passing over the scrub and grass, which were still on
fire in the direction of their proposed route, they were moving
this morning before five o'clock. They soon commence ascending a
range and at seven o'clock, having proceeded the distance of
eight miles, had arrived on its summits. Hence to the westward
was observed a series of open forest hills, to the northward of
which there appeared a very high forest range; here also the land
in general was moderately high in the direction of the supposed
course of the Hovell. To the southward the country had a similar
appearance. Descending this range they direct their march to a
very remarkable forest hill, bearing W. by S. This hill, which
they name after Captain Piper, late Naval Officer of the Colony,
"Mount Piper," is of a conical form, its eastern aspect up to the
summit clear of trees, but its other sides thickly
wooded.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At nine, (forenoon) after a march of about
eight miles, they came to a country of a more promising
appearance, consisting of hill and dale, with a good soil well
covered with grass; and wooded, though scantily, with the stringy
bark and a species of gum tree. At ten they halt. At three they
renew their march, and having reached the top of a hill, obtain a
view of a finer and more accessible country in their advance. The
country on fire in every direction. At five, having proceeded
about the distance of twelve miles and a half, they stop near the
banks of a creek. This they name "Sunday Creek." The mosquitoes
and flies are still very troublesome. They had the misfortune,
to-day, to lose a second dog. The animal had been cut in the
conflict with the kangaroo that was last killed, and had very
probably remained behind to rest, in consequence, until it was
too late to follow.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, December 13.--They travel to-day
sixteen miles; the first seven miles upwards along the creek,
(when meeting with a practicable ford they cross it.) The
remainder of the distance in the direction S. by E. The land on
the banks of the creek was not good, the grass was scanty, and
the timber indifferent. In the latter division of their journey
they had to traverse several ranges, the last of which, the
Jullian, so named after a friend of Mr. Hovell's, appeared to be
what is termed a dividing range; the waters of which, on the
north side, run to the northward, (most probably to join the
Hovell). Those on the southern side proceed to the southward, and
very probably discharge themselves into the sea. The weather this
evening was extremely cold, the wind from the S W., the
thermometer 50 deg. The willow of the colony is frequently met
with here, and has a beautiful appearance. At a distance it looks
not much unlike the orange or the lemon tree. The indigenous flax
plant also is abundant, and the bronze-winged pigeon and the king
parrot are both of them common, as also the native
dog.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, December 14.--Travel twenty miles in a
southerly direction--the first part of their journey through a
meadow of some miles in circumference, thence up a high insulated
hill, named Bland's Mount, from which they obtain a view of
several extensive plains, reaching from W to S E. separated from
each other by patches of forest land. To the southward the
country appeared level, but interspersed here and there with
hills of a conical form. The soil in all this tract of country
was excellent. These plains, as well as the mount, were named
after their friend, Mr. Bland of Sydney, "Bland's Plains." Thence
they proceed eight miles S S W. in quest of water, but without
success; until on sinking a well, about three feet deep, and
forcing a pole into the earth about three feet deeper, they had
the good fortune to procure water enough to afford to each of the
party about half a pint, a most acceptable supply, although it
was so scanty, as well as indifferent and muddy. Wherever the
land in these plains rises a little above the general level, it
is stoney, and in these spots it was thinly scattered over with
the honey-suckle of the colony. At the end of this stage of their
day's march they ascend another hill. Here the perambulator was
broken to pieces, and from this circumstance the hill was named
by them "Mount Odometer." From this hill, between the points S E.
and W., alternate plains and forests are seen extending to the
utmost verge of the horizon, and from N N E. to S E. part of the
Alpine Chain; while towards the south, the land gradually
dips.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nothing could surpass the beauty of this view.
The trees which they met with to-day, were nearly the same as
those observed in their journey yesterday. The whole country,
however, had evidently suffered from drought. The earth, even in
places the most likely to be supplied with moisture and to retain
it, was parched and cracked, and presented frequent chasms, wide
and deep, and consequently dangerous for travelling.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At six they halted on the banks of a creek*
which runs to the southward. They had to regret to-day the loss
of another dog, a little terrier. This animal had been very
useful in discovering game, and was a general favorite. It had
very probably been killed by the native dogs, which are here
numerous. To-day a snake was killed of a light brown colour,
different therefore from any they had yet seen. They also met
with the blue mountain parrot, the first they had seen since
their leaving home.</font></p>

<p>* Relief Creek.</p>

<p><font size="4">The thermometer, in the morning, 60
deg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, December 15.--The cattle were so
much fatigued by the journey of yesterday, that they were not
enabled to travel till nearly nine o'clock. They now proceed S S
W. four miles, when they come to a deep creek. This they name
"Broughton's Creek," after the late Mr. Broughton, deceased,
formerly Assistant Commissary General of the Colony. The course
of this creek is about S., the waters apparently motionless, the
banks fifty or sixty feet high, and in some places perpendicular;
its waters apparently derived from part of the Jullian range to
the north west. At the distance of six miles from the first
creek, or two miles from the last in the direction S W., they met
with a third creek. Here there had evidently been some natives
not long before them. They now travel about twenty miles along a
continued plain, (on which there was scarcely a tree) when they
arrive on the banks of another creek or river, considerably
larger than even the first which they had crossed to-day, and the
banks of which were high and steep like those of Broughton's
Creek. On the edges of this river they found a plant, called in
the colony the sea-marigold.* Eels also were caught in the river,
a fish which they had never found in any of the waters which flow
to the westward. The soil is excellent, and the general aspect of
the country highly promising. Water plentiful. The only want
observable is that of timber for building; for fuel there is
abundance. The sun has been obscured the last three days. It is
now blowing strongly from the westward. The weather cold and dry.
The thermometer ranging from 50 to 62 deg.</font></p>

<p>* A species of Mesembryanthemum.</p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, December 16.--This morning they
crossed the river or creek without difficulty, the water not
taking the cattle more than chest high. Mr. Hume named this
stream the Arndell, after the late Dr. Arndell, the father of
Mrs. Hovell. They now proceed S W. by S. through the plains about
six miles, when they were struck with an appearance, respecting
which they could not decide, whether it was that of burning
grass, or that of distant water. They now proceeded S. and at
four o'clock, had the gratification satisfactorily to determine
that the appearance which had just now created so much doubt, was
that of water; and which, leaving the river a short distance, and
directing their march from S W. to S S W. they soon ascertain to
be part of the sea,--the so long and ardently desired object of
their labours. They now again alter their course to S W., and
travel six miles in that direction along the shore, over
excellent land, but quite clear of timber.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On the downs or plains to-day, they had seen
several flocks of emues, and wild turkeys. The kangaroo however
was seldom met with. Indeed this animal is not generally found in
so open a tract of country, as that over which they have been
passing the last three days.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The water near the shore was covered with
water-fowl, of various descriptions, some of which were new to
them.--And by the time they had halted for the night, they had
procured an ample supply of black swans and ducks. They stopped
for the night at seven o'clock, in a small wood about a mile from
the beach, but where there was no fresh water; having travelled
to-day, upwards of twenty miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, December 17th.--Indications of rain,
terminating in light showers. Wind high from the westward. They
proceed this morning from the beach, in a direction about N N W.
three or four miles, in quest of water, when they arrive on the
banks of a creek,* where they had the good fortune to find
abundance, both of good water and of grass. Here therefore they
remain the day, in order to refresh the cattle, who were not a
little in want of this timely relief, more particularly as it is
proposed to commence their return to-morrow. This determination
of so soon retracing their steps, though it cost them much
regret, had become indispensable, not only from the
extreme&dagger; scantiness of their remaining supplies, and the
certainty of the many difficulties they would have to encounter,
but still more so from the consideration that the mere
circumstance of a fall of rain, by swelling the streams, might in
the weak, and ill-provided state, to which the whole party were
reduced, render their return altogether impracticable. This
morning, one of the men, James Fitzpatrick, having proceeded a
short distance up the creek, to shoot wild fowl, was suddenly
surprised by a couple of natives who were lurking behind some
reeds; the man no sooner perceived them, than he begun to
retreat, and they to advance, throwing off their cloaks, and with
their arms in their hands; perceiving this, he turned and snapped
his piece at one of them; but as it missed fire, he had no
resource left, except flight, and which also would have been
unavailing, had not his shouts for assistance, brought him timely
aid. About two hours after this occurrence, as two of the people
were employed in procuring fire-wood, in a small clump of trees,
not far from the tent, two natives sprung towards them from
behind the trees. These, however, on the men presenting their
muskets at them, made signs of peace. Mr. Hume who was at hand
now approached, when laying down his arms, and beckoning to the
men to do the same, the natives followed the example, and after
much conversation, but of which not a word was understood by
either party, they proceeded with Mr. Hume to the tent. These
people by degrees began to be a little better understood, when
they seemed to wish to describe&Dagger; that a vessel had been in
that bay, and that the people had landed; and to imply that both
the master and the people were continually in a hurry.&sect; They
also appeared to point out where the vessel lay, and suiting "the
action to the word," endeavoured to explain that they had seen
men felling trees in that direction, and this was all done with a
gesture and grimace, evincing that these people were at least not
bad mimics.</font></p>

<p>* Or at present a chain of ponds, commencing at Mount
Wollstonecraft, and terminating after a course of seven or eight
miles in the sea. This they named Kennedy's Creek.</p>

<p>&dagger; Four week's flour, at reduced allowance, and a small
quantity of tea and sugar, but no animal food; independently of
which, the ropes and other material employed for crossing
streams, were now almost utterly unfit for use.</p>

<p>&Dagger; Alluding however very probably, to the original
settlement, of Port Phillip, and when it appears in the account
given of that event, that the natives were so troublesome, it
became necessary to fire on them--a circumstance, which must have
taken place, not far from the very spot, where the present party
of discovery, was now encamped.</p>

<p>&sect; A notion perhaps formed from the mere routine labour,
or employment of the settlers, and which, compared with their own
habits of indolence, and their utter ignorance of labour, might
wear that appearance.</p>

<p><font size="4">These natives, who were soon joined by a third,
it was discovered were inquisitive, troublesome, and great
thieves, cunning and treacherous. They made a laugh of the
circumstance of one of the people having been pursued, though
there could be no doubt as to the hostility of their intentions
on that occasion. Messrs. Hovell and Hume, had been desirous of
taking their horses in the direction of what they supposed to be
Port Phillip, but the conduct of these people, and the numerous
fires which were being made around them, apparently as signals
among the natives, made them conclude, that it would be unsafe
for the party to separate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The natives here, in their form and features,
very much resemble those about Sydney, their manners and customs
appeared very similar, and they have the same kind of weapons.
Their language however seemed totally different, as to words,
from that of the Sydney natives, or those about Jarvis's Bay,
though in sound,* it is much the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They did not seem astonished at the horses or
bullocks, though evidently much afraid of the latter, and even
dreadfully alarmed, if the bullocks, although at a considerable
distance, were looking towards them.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The harbour or bay consisted of an immense
sheet of water, its greatest length extending E. and W. with land
which seemed to them an island, to the southward, lying across
its mouth, but which, in fact, is a peninsula, with a very low
isthmus connecting it to the western shore. Hence the mistaking
of this spot, Port Phillip, for Western Port, a bay about fifteen
miles to the eastward of the latter.* This error has been since
satisfactorily rectified by Mr. Hovell, in his examination of
Western Port, and its vicinities, on the occasion of the late
settlement of that place; a short account of which will be given
in the appendix.</font></p>

<p>* Which in no way effects the important results of the
journey, and was scarcely at the time, and with the circumstances
under which it was made, to be detected or avoided, there being
then no account of the localities of Western Port, at least, that
could be depended on; the outline of it by Flinders, being
incomplete, and the chart of Baudin, from the surreptitious
manner in which it was got up, until confirmed by more
respectable testimony, scarcely worthy of attention; while they
themselves, were unprovided with instruments, in a fit state, as
mentioned in the preface, to enable them to correct the
longitudinal inaccuracy.</p>

<p><font size="4">The soil throughout the plains appeared good,
in some places of considerable extent, and to afford a
particularly fine dry sheep pasturage. There is however a
deficiency of trees fit for building,* though abundance for fuel.
Ridges of stones, here and there intersect the plains, varying in
elevation from two or three to five or six feet, and of perhaps
fifty or sixty feet in breadth.</font></p>

<p>* On the Alpine Chain and the Jullian Range, there is
abundance of timber fit for that purpose.</p>

<p><font size="4">The stones are of various sizes, broken,
angular, extremely hard, heavy, and some so large that they would
weigh upwards of four or five hundred weight. Two such ridges as
above described, extend from Mount Wollstonecraft* a distance of
six or seven miles, almost in a direct line, nearly down to the
beach. Mr. Hovell took from the root of a tree, which had been
recently blown down, a piece of very soft stone, consisting
almost entirely of lime; and the banks of the creek, near its
entrance into the bay, seemed to consist principally of beds of
shells; emus are numerous every where on the Downs, and near the
sea the Cape Barren goose. The bay too is literally covered with
black swans, and various other aquatic birds. Caught some black
bream in the creek. Messrs. Hovell and Hume each marked his
initials on a tree with an iron tomahawk, at some distance from
the left bank of the creek, about two miles from the
beach.</font></p>

<p>* The position of this mount will be given in the Journal of
to-morrow.</p>

<p><font size="4">Wind high from the N W. and S W. since Sunday.
Thermometer from 55 to 60 deg. at noon; in the morning 45 and 50
deg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, December 18.--This morning they
commence their return,* keeping between two and three miles to
the southward and eastward of their outward route; at four,
having travelled about fifteen miles, they halt on the banks of a
large creek, taking its rise in Mount Wollstonecraft, and which
they named "Dickson's Creek," after Mr. John Dickson,&dagger;
sen. of Sydney.</font></p>

<p>* But previously to so doing, took down the following
bearings, from the extremity of a low neck of land, extending a
considerable distance into the bay, on the left side of the
entrance into the creek, viz. The supposed entrance to the bay,
but in fact a low Isthmus, S. by E. distant about fifteen miles.
A bold bluff bank, part of the peninsula, forming the southern
border of Port Phillip, but now mistaken for an island, distant
about ten or twelve miles, S E.--High land, distant between 20
and 30 miles S. 45 W.--Mount M'Intosh named after our late
Barrack-master, N. 76 E--and Mount Campbell, after the late Mr.
W. Campbell, of Harrington Park, N. 85 E. distant between 30 and
40 miles, Mount Wollstonecraft, named after Mr. E.
Wollstonecraft, of Sydney, N. 25 W. seven miles, Mount Berry,
named from Mr. Alexander Berry, N W. fifteen miles, and finally
the Jullian Range, extending in the form of a crescent, from N E.
to N W. distant at its nearest point, about seventeen miles,</p>

<p><font size="4">&dagger;</font> To whom the colonists are
indebted for the first introduction of the steam-engine into the
colony, in the year 1814.</p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, December 19.--They re-cross the
Aradell, a short distance below the spot at which they had first
met with it; on the following day they renew their course along
the downs in the direction N E., cross Broughton's Creek,* and
stop for the night at that chain of ponds, which they passed on
the 14th instant in their outward journey; next day cross Bland's
Plains, and in evening regain their former quarters in Tempe
Valley.</font></p>

<p>* The banks of this creek are, in general, steep and lofty, in
some places from 50 to 100 feet high, so that they could find
only one spot where they could cross it. The soil throughout the
downs is invariably excellent. On the 30th they met with several
large fragments of granite lying loose on the surface near the
creek, where they remained for the night.</p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, December 22.--They re-cross the
Jullian Range by the same pass* by which they had entered the
downs on the 13th, and taking a northerly direction, travel
successively through an extensive scrub, some fine forest land
and a beautiful plain&dagger; a few miles to the west of their
outward route, on the 12th, and halt for the night on the left
bank of Sunday Creek. The following day having crossed Sunday
Creek and a small stony range stretching obliquely across the
line of their route, proceeding still northward, through a track
of fine country, they arrive on the left bank of the Hovell,
about twenty miles lower down (or more to the west) than the spot
at which they had before crossed that stream, on the 4th of the
present month. The river here was about seventy yards broad,
apparently deep, and without any perceptible current, (but its
waters had, it was evident, been greatly reduced by the late
drought). Tracing it upwards about a couple of miles they were so
fortunate as to find a convenient ford, where the water was only
about three feet deep, with a current not exceeding a mile an
hour.</font></p>

<p>* Hume's pass. This lies between two remarkable hills, Mount
Disappointment, to the eastward, and another named Mount
Wentworth, after the late Mr Wentworth, of Sydney, to the
westward, about equa-distant (10 or 12 miles) from each. The
whole of their route, from Port Phillip thus far, has been over
fine land, consisting of Plains and Downs, fit for every purpose
of grazing, and agriculture.</p>

<p><font size="4">&dagger;</font> Ornamented with clumps of that
beautiful tree, the native Willow and from which circumstance,
they were induced to name it Piper's Park.</p>

<p><font size="4">The whole line of country to the west of their
route from Hume's Pass as far as the Hovell consists of a high
broken surface, and beyond this were observed continuous ranges
of considerable elevation, extending in the directions N W. and S
E.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday and Saturday, December 24 and 25,--were
spent on the banks of the Hovell, in order that they might avail
themselves of the fine fish which abound in its waters, as well
as refresh the cattle. In the evening of the 25th Mr. Hume's mare
was bitten on the nose by a snake, and became immediately a
shocking spectacle, the head swelling so much that the eyes were
quite closed. An attempt to bleed having failed, half a pint of
spirits of turpentine with some water was given, and about twenty
minutes after, at which time the swelling had began to subside,
some <i>eau de luce</i> properly diluted was also administered.
Half an hour from this period the swelling had become
considerably reduced, but covered with small bladders containing
a thin sanious fluid; sight was restored and the animal was in
every respect rapidly recovering;--as, however there still
remained some sickness or nausea, with a thick viscid phlegm
flowing copiously from the mouth and nostrils and much
drowsiness, in order to prevent the animal from sleeping, she was
kept walking gently during the whole night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They obtained from a hill a fine view of the
river flowing from the N E. through a gap in a mountain range,
distant about 8 or 10 miles, when after making a considerable
curve to the west,* it eventually turned to the N W. in which
direction it was visible to a great distance. To the south the
land was high and broken, to the west moderately so; from that
point towards the north, the country was low but undulating. From
N E. to S E. was seen a lofty range, forming for a considerable
extent the left bank of the stream.</font></p>

<p>* This is no doubt the most southern bend of the river, and is
the spot where they very unexpectedly met with it on the 23rd.
The Hovell, thence, from what has been said, as well as from what
was to-day again observed of the country to the westward, it is
only reasonable to conclude, must take a N W. course; and is
therefore identical with the most southerly of those streams,
seen in his late journey, by Captain Sturt, flowing eventually
into the lake Alexandrina.</p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, December 26th.--The mare being
sufficiently recovered, they resume their journey, and proceed N.
half W. ten or twelve miles, for the most part through a fine
undulating forest country, similar in some places, to the
Cow-pastures; and abounding in kangaroos, but of which
circumstance they could not avail themselves, from the disabled
state of their only remaining dog. The timber met with to-day,
was in general good. The views* of the country to the N W. and N.
resembled those of yesterday. Halt for the day at two o'clock in
the afternoon, (the mare being unable to proceed further) near a
chain of ponds, in a fine meadow, as they conjectured, about 25
miles W. of their outward track.</font></p>

<p>* A plain on the banks of the Hovell, distant to the N W.
about ten miles, Mr. Hume named after Mrs. Hovell, Esther's
Plains.</p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, December 27th.--Route about twenty
miles, N E. half E. the country in general level, but not fine,
studded here and there with the Cow-pasture-box, stringy-bark,
and the blue-gum, but which were neither numerous nor large.
Towards the west, a fine country like that of
yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, December 28th.--Thermometer, at noon,
in the shade, 86. Route N E. about fifteen miles over good land,
scantily wooded, and intersected here and there, by ponds and
small streams. The horizon from W. to N E. a perfect level, with
but one hill observable in all that distance. Ranges still
terminating abruptly on their right (towards the S E.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, December 29.--Their course to-day
was about N E., 15 or 16 miles over a level forest, with here and
there a small creek, flowing towards the N W. The soil excellent,
and the trees numerous--a stunted species of blue gum. They
recrossed part of Norton's Meadow, and the strong stream, thickly
bordered with reeds, which runs through it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, December 30.--Weather warm, they
travel about 20 miles N E., traverse a very high barren
collateral range, extending nearly due N. and by W., from which
they obtain a distinct view of that remarkable mountain, named,
<i>from its peculiar configuration, Mount Buffalo,</i> bearing
E.; and then passing through a fine scantily wooded country, they
cross and stop on the right bank of Oxley's creek. The whole of
the country near this creek is of the finest possible
description, fit for any purposes, whether of grazing, or of
agriculture, and they had reason to believe, that it was of
almost unlimited extent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, December 31.--Weather cloudy, with
thunder. This morning they rejoin their former track, and proceed
along it in a direct course for the Ovens, at a spot where they
had before, in their outward journey, forded that
stream.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From a high barren collateral range, stretching
N W. between Oxley's creek and the Ovens, they again had a view
of Mount Buffalo, and of a continuation of the Alpine Chain
towards the N E. Just before sunset they cross the Ovens and then
immediately halt for the night; having travelled about fifteen
miles. They caught abundance of fish in the river, and killed
this day a species of adder, of a dingy brown colour, remarkable
for the amazing breadth of its head.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, January 1.--Weather hazy, several
light showers in the night, and distant thunder indications
creating no small anxiety, and which had they been realized,
would have rendered it indispensable, most probably, to have
recourse to the mountains, in order that they might be enabled to
head those numerous streams which they would otherwise have yet
to encounter; and the passage of which during floods to them in
their present state of weakness, and deprived as they now were of
all the material indispensable for that purpose, would doubtless
have been utterly impracticable; while a circuitous route among
mountainous regions, was to them nearly destitute of provisions,*
almost equally an object of apprehension.</font></p>

<p>* Except a couple of kangaroos, and a few chance fish, animal
food of any description, they had not tasted since the 25th of
last month.</p>

<p><font size="4">They now therefore hurried along N E. for the
Hume, in their old track, making a forced march of about 20
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, January 2nd.--Weather cloudy; the
horses having strayed in the night, they were not enabled to move
this morning until six o'clock, when journeying about eight
miles, they met with a considerable number of native women and
children, perhaps about thirty. The children were engaged in
play, throwing small spears, formed of reeds, at a circular piece
of bark, about a foot in diameter, while it was rolling along the
ground; and the women were employed in spinning the native flax,
one of whom, (an old woman,) gave immediate notice of their
approach, crying out white man! white man! minija! minija! which
in the language of the natives of the Murrumbidgee, would imply
"make haste, make haste," when the whole party rose, and in a few
minutes disappeared. About sunset, they crossed that branch of
the Hume, which they had first passed, on the 22nd of
November.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, January 3rd.--Arrived at noon, after a
march of about eight miles, on the right bank of the Hume, having
previously crossed that branch of this river, which they first
met with on the 21st of November. The Hume, as well as this
tributary stream, was now so low, in consequence of the long
continued drought, that they were both easily fordable, their
waters not exceeding at their respective fords, three or four
feet in depth. Shot some black swans, and ducks, and caught
abundance of fish. They were induced to let the cattle rest, in
consequence of their having reached the Hume, the principal
object of their anxiety, and found it so favourable for their
passage, the fineness of the weather, and the enfeebled state of
the cattle.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, January 4th.--In consideration of the
extreme heat of the weather, and the weak state of the cattle,
they did not leave this favourable spot, until the afternoon.
They now cross the river, about a mile higher up, (more to the
east,) than their former crossing place, travel about two miles,
still upwards, along its banks, and then halt for the purposes of
fishing, shooting, and refreshing the cattle. Some of the fish,
which were similar to those in the Macquarie and Lachlan,
described by Mr. Oxley, were not less than thirty or forty pounds
weight.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, January 5.--They proceed about
twenty miles; three or four miles up the Hume, to its junction
with Battery Mount Creek, whence by their observations, they were
enabled to come to the conclusion, that the Hume receives the
waters of that stream, from which they took their departure on
the 8th of last November, and which pursues its course along the
central line of that thinly wooded undulating surface at the base
of the South Australian Chain, described in that day's journal.
The Hume now bending to the S E. they were induced to leave it,
proceeding about N E. through a good open country. During this
day, they passed Battery Mount, bearing W. distant eight or ten
miles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the afternoon they surprised a large body of
natives, but who fled with precipitation. They rested for the
night, in a hilly country, a few miles to the west of Friday
Mount.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, January 6th.--Thermometer at noon in
the shade, 76. They travelled about 16 miles, N E. through a fine
open forest* country, scantily studded with the manna and the
box. The wood of the latter is highly serviceable for the
construction of fences, the spokes of wheels, and for building.
The stones here consisted of Granite and Schistus; the grass was
abundant and good, although the country had evidently been
parched by a long continued drought.</font></p>

<p>* Camden Forest.</p>

<p><font size="4">In the course of the day, they again came by
surprise upon a body of natives, consisting of eight men; these
appeared much alarmed, and, on perceiving the bullocks, fled
through a small creek, and concealed themselves among the reeds
on its banks. In the evening, about a mile from the spot where
they had been first seen, the natives again made their
appearance, and approached them with marks of friendship. One of
these men dressed in an old yellow jacket, spoke a few words of
English, and had been at Lake George. They had among them, one
iron axe, and four tomahawks.--The whole party remained with them
till dark, when, except two of their number, they all retired,
promising to return in the morning.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, January 7.--The thermometer at daylight
46 deg. a dense fog. The natives now returned with a considerable
augmentation to their numbers, amounting altogether to not less
than forty able bodied men, all armed. The horses having strayed,
two of the people assisted by two of the natives were employed a
considerable part of the morning in bringing them in. The
natives, when they were just going to start begged the travellers
would accompany them to their camp, about a mile further up the
creek, so that the women and children might have an opportunity
of seeing them. Mr. Hume, taking three of the men with him,
complied with their request, when he met with a party of about
thirty women, as many children, and some fine young men. These
were extremely pressing, that he and his party should remain with
them, as they were going they said, to have a "Corrobera," two of
them promising, in event of his compliance, to accompany him and
his party, the following day as far as the Murrumbidgee. The men
were the finest natives, they had ever seen, one of them about
six feet high, and another whom they measured, five feet, nine
inches and a half.--They were all robust and well proportioned,
and possessed what is unusual among the native tribes, well
formed legs--Some of them had higher foreheads than are generally
observed among these people. Their weapons are like those of the
natives of the Colony, except the spears, which were made of
strong knotted reeds, about six feet long, to which was affixed a
piece of hard wood, about two feet in length, with a rounded
point, barbed in some instances, with numerous small pieces of
flint or agate. Each of these people was furnished with a good
ample cloak of opossum skin, many of them had necklaces, made of
small pieces of a yellow reed strung with the fibre of the
currajong, the flax-plant, or the hair of the opossum.--At nine
they took leave of their Camden friends, who appeared to be a
kind and inoffensive people. They travelled to-day about fourteen
miles, N E. the former half of their journey still through a fine
country, the latter over a tract of country traversed by several
lofty, barren, slaty, collateral ranges, running nearly N. and
S.*--branches of the table land, passed on the 5th and the 6th of
November. In each of the valleys between these ranges there was a
small stream, or chain of ponds. The timber observed to-day was
principally the stringy-bark.</font></p>

<p>* Dividing ranges extending between the waters of the
Murrumbidgee, and the Hume, which streams it should appear from
Captain Sturt's report, eventually unite their waters in a low
level country, about a hundred miles to the westward.</p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, January 8.--To-day was served out the
last of their provisions, viz. six pounds of flour to each man,
and some tea, while they had a journey before them of at least a
hundred and fifty miles to the nearest stock station, over a
mountainous and difficult country, and with cattle so fatigued
and crippled, that they were able to make only short stages. They
travel to-day about fourteen miles N E., still passing over the
terminations of lofty collateral schistous ranges of the same
character as those of yesterday. On one of these ranges, for the
first time since their leaving the country about Bargo River,
they met with the iron-bark tree. They had never once met with
the apple-tree.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">High ranges to the N W.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, January 9.--They continue journeying N
E., winding along the hollows, and over a repetition of
collateral stony but grassy ridges, extending in the usual
direction N W. As usual, they met with water in the hollows.
Natives' fires were seen several times to the N W., where the
country appeared to be an open hilly forest. In the evening they
again had a sight of Ben Lomond, bearing about S E., and at the
distance perhaps of twenty-five or thirty miles. They had seen
this remarkable mountain a few days ago, bearing about E N E.;
from one of the ranges to the N E. of Camden Forest, and when it
was supposed to have been not less than seventy miles distant.
The men were now so distressed from want of shoes as to be hardly
able to travel. The distance travelled is not
specified.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday, January 10.--Their course averaged
to-day about a N E. direction, and they halted in the evening on
the left bank of the Medway, about twenty miles N. of the spot at
which they had crossed on the 3rd of November, and just below the
conflux, on its right bank, of a fine little stream, which they
had crossed on the 2nd of that month. The Medway here is a
beautiful river winding N. through rich alluvial scantily wooded
plains, known by the native name Doomot.* This stream, in its
present very reduced state at the place at which it was forded,
was three feet deep, and its current about two miles an hour; the
bottom consisted of pebbles.</font></p>

<p>* The natives pronounce this word Toomot, or Doomot.</p>

<p><font size="4">In the course of the day they crossed several
rather high collateral ranges of coarse granite, the surfaces of
which were in a state of advanced disintegration, and over a
country consisting generally of poor land.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They would now from their repeated observations
of the form of the country, gladly have followed the Medway to
its junction with the Murrumbidgee (a circumstance of which they
had no doubt, both from the observed direction of these streams,
as well as from the character of the country through which they
pursued their course) and then have made the easting part of
their route, up the right bank of the latter river; but were
deterred from this attempt, as well from their uncertainty as to
the distance they would thus have to travel, as from their
anxiety to rejoin the carts for the sake of the supplies which
they had left with them.* Caught some fish of the usual
description.</font></p>

<p>* It would indeed have been well, had they pursued a N N E.
course, all the way from Camden Forest, until they met the
Murrumbidgee, which would then have been at its junction with the
Medway--as they would then have avoided all those high collateral
ranges, which have caused them so much distress, the last three
or four days; as well as those numerous, almost insurmountable
difficulties which they had to encounter afterwards.</p>

<p><font size="4">Tuesday, January 11.--Crossed the river at nine
o'clock, some fine open country, then two high collateral forest
ranges, when they came to some rich meadow land. This being the
last spot favorable for refreshing the cattle, that they had
reason to expect they should meet with on this side of the
mountains, they were induced to halt here after making a short
stage of not more than five miles, about east, towards the
western side of that table-land which they were occupied in
traversing from the 29th to the 31st of last October, inclusive.
Kangaroos were seen in abundance during the last two days; but of
which circumstance they were not enabled to avail themselves,
having now only one dog left, and this animal in too low a
condition for hunting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wednesday, January 12.--Weather still fine but
warm. Finding no practicable spot for ascending the table-land,
they now pursue a S E. course in the hope of discovering one in
the direction of that little tributary of the Medway, which has
been just mentioned;--meet with this stream, pursue it upwards of
two miles, and then commence ascending the mountains in an
easterly direction, winding in a zig zag course along part of a
large collateral ridge until after two hours arduous toil, and
with much danger to the cattle of falling into the numerous
ravines which presented themselves in their way, they had managed
to climb about two thirds of the ascent. Here they halt on a
tolerably flat surface, where they meet both with good grass and
with water. In one of the ravines, which had been passed with
great difficulty, they caught the sight of a beautiful stream on
which there were three successive fine falls, each of
considerable height.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thursday, January 13.--Journey about two miles
east, when they reach the summits of the table-land, at a spot
not far from their former track. Here they halt on a spot covered
with good grass, and well watered. Shot a kangaroo. The cattle
were now so crippled, from the effects of the stoney* and rugged
nature of the surface over which they have been travelling,
during the last week in particular, that it was found necessary
to cover their feet with mocassins, made of kangaroo skins, which
the men had fortunately saved during the journey; and the men,
for want of shoes, were not in much better condition. At three
they cross Swampy Valley, a spot which they passed on the 31st of
October. They were now induced to diverge from their former
route, hoping to find a better one, somewhat more to the
eastward, when having travelled a few miles over a slightly
undulating country, with but very little descent, they come to a
small but rapid stream, the banks of which consisted of unsound
ground, covered with a kind of rushes. Here they remain the
night. The weather had been cloudy during the day, and in the
evening there was a shower with thunder. The thermometer, at
noon, 74 deg.</font></p>

<p>* Course green granite.</p>

<p><font size="4">Friday, January 14.--Weather cloudy, with much
lightning and thunder during the night; in the afternoon a heavy
thunder squall with rain; when the weather again cleared, and
became fine. The course of their route till four o'clock E N E.
along the summits of the table-range; they then began to descend
the eastern aspect of the range towards Limestone Valley, about
six or eight miles S. of the spot at which they had ascended the
range (October 29th); at six they stopped for the night, having
then succeeded in effecting only about two thirds of the descent,
when to their great disappointment and chagrin, the route became
so craggy, dangerous and intricate, and the bullocks so
exhausted, that they were utterly unable to proceed
further.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saturday, January 15.--To-day they rejoin their
old track of the 28th of October, at the upper part of Limestone
Valley, after a mountain journey, which for fatigue and
intricacy, and even danger to the cattle, it would be impossible
adequately to describe. Sometimes over steep crags, loose stones
slipping from under their feet, gullies, and deep ravines
traversed by small streams;--and part of the distance along the
bed of a rivulet, by which they were eventually again conducted
into their former track. Out of this fine little stream they had
the good fortune, in the evening, to procure a few fish. The
whole of their flour was expended to-day.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sunday, January 16th.--Messrs. Hume and Hovell,
with two men, hurry onwards to the carts, which they had left
with part of their supplies on the 26th of October, enjoining the
rest of the party to follow slowly with the bullocks, while they
themselves would be occupied in conveying the carts across the
stream. The carts, harness and supplies were found precisely as
they had been left, except a tarpaulin, from which a piece had
been cut apparently with a tomahawk, and a small spirit keg,
which had leaked out, from becoming worm-eaten.--At one o'clock,
the men joined with the bullocks;--when leaving two of the men to
whom they were now enabled to distribute a sufficient supply of
salt provisions, though without either flour or bread, in charge
of the bullocks, which were at this time so exhausted, that two
of them were unable to ascend the right bank of the stream,
without considerable assistance;--they proceed with the horses
and one of the carts, about seven miles towards the Murrumbidgee,
making every possible exertion in order to procure a supply of
flour, for the party whom they had left. The following day,
(17th), they ford the Murrumbidgee at the same spot, at which
they had before crossed it with so much difficulty. The bottom
here consisted of pebbles. In the evening they rest on the banks
of the Gondoroo river, at the N E. border of Yass, or M'Dougall's
Plains.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On the following day (18th), they arrived in
safety at Mr. Hume's station, near Lake George, from which they
had taken their departure, when on their outward journey, the
17th of last October, having had the good fortune to complete in
the fullest sense their arduous attempt, and to accomplish all
its various objects to their utmost extent, within the short
period of sixteen weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From this place, they despatched the necessary
supplies, for the men whom they had left behind them, on the
16th:--and on the 24th, each of them arrived at his respective
home.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It now only remains to add, that after
continuing a few days with the bullocks, finding them utterly
unable to travel, the men left them together with what remained
of the supplies, and returned in safety by themselves, following
the track which had been carefully marked out for them on the
trees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The results of this important undertaking, were
the discovery of a vast range of country, invaluable for every
purpose of grazing, and of agriculture--watered by numerous fine
streams and rivers, and presenting an easy inland intercourse,
extending from Port Phillip, and Western Port, to the settled
districts of Bathurst--thus refuting the previously adopted
opinion, by which this same line of country, had been denounced
as "uninhabitable, and useless for all the purposes of
civilization,"* while, further, when taken in connection with the
later discoveries of Captain Sturt, they give access to regions
of an amplitude and capabilities fully adequate to receive, at
the lowest estimate, the entire <i>supposed</i> present surplus
population of the Mother Country.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The supplies were as follow:--Seven pack
saddles, one riding saddle, eight stand of arms, six pounds of
gunpowder, sixty rounds of ball cartridge, six suits of slops,
and six blankets for the men, two tarpaulins, one tent made of
coarse Colonial woollen cloth, twelve hundred pounds of flour,
three hundred and fifty pounds of pork, one hundred and seventy
pounds of sugar, thirty-eight pounds of tea and coffee, eight
pounds of tobacco for the men, sixteen pounds of soap, twenty
pounds of salt, cooking utensils, one false horizon, one sextant,
three pocket compasses, and one perambulator, exclusive of
Messrs. Hovell and Hume's own personal clothes and bedding; the
latter consisting, like that of the men, of a blanket only. Six
of the pack saddles, the slops, and blankets for the men, with
six of the muskets, and the ball-cartridges, tent, and tarpaulin,
were liberally furnished by the Government; and of which, the
muskets only, the other articles having become destroyed or worn
out in the course of the journey, were returned.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="4">No. II.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This note was penned and printed four years
ago. Some specimens of fossil bones, which Mr. George Rankin, of
Bathurst, did me the favor to shew me the other day, corroborate
the justness of the suggestion. These specimens were procured
from one of the lime-stone caves in Wellington Valley.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I have since been favored with the sight of an
extensive and interesting collection, made near the same spot by
Major Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="4">No. III.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Lake Alexandrina was first discovered by a
boat's crew of Mr. Duncan Forbes, in the year 1829, while in
command of the schooner <i>Prince of Denmark</i>; and the
discovery immediately, on his arrival in Sydney, communicated by
him to the Colonial Government.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="4">No. V.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The outline of Western Port and its vicinities
is given in the chart. This Port affords safe anchorage for
vessels of any draft of water. The settlement lately formed by
the Government, and now abandoned from the supposed desire of the
Government to concentrate the powers of the Colony,--was situate
on the Eastern side of the Bay. This was ill supplied, but with
good water. The country from this spot to Bass River, consists
principally of a rich alluvial soil; interspersed, however, here
and there, with patches of heath. The amount of good land in this
part of the country seemed to be about seven or eight thousand
acres. The space traversed by Mr. Hovell between Bass River and
Wright's River, consists almost entirely of fine land, alluvial
near the Rivers, and the rest of it a good rich strong arable
soil, from about 15,000 to 20,000 acres in extent. The range
running between these Rivers is lofty, but not steep; fit for
almost any agricultural purposes, and abounds with the best
possible timber, particularly its Southern aspect. The whole of
this space seemed badly watered, and the water met with,
aluminous;--excepting the immediate vicinities of the Rivers
which are perfectly fresh, within three or four miles of their
mouths. Bass River was deep where Mr. Hovell met with it, and
more than thirty feet wide. Wright's River is a somewhat smaller
stream; but this was during a period of long continued drought,
from which the whole Colony had most severely suffered. The space
between Wright's River, Cape Patterson, and Shallow Lagoon,
consists of a low undulating, heathy surface, badly watered; with
here and there a patch of good timber. At Cape Patterson coal was
plentiful and good, lying partly above the surface, and some of
it jutting into the sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The space (extending from the Settlement to the
Northward), to Red Buff, is a low swampy tea-tree brush, almost
utterly impassable. The range immediately at the back (to the
Eastward of this space) is not steep; but moderately high,
abounding in timber, and almost impassable from a dense
underwood.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Inland, from Red Bluff, in a Northerly
direction for about 12 miles, the country consisted of open
forest; with a good soil, but scantily watered; at the extremity
of which distance the country became impenetrable, in consequence
of the extreme <i>closeness</i> of the trees, and the denseness
of the low brush and underwood. From this inland point to the
entrance of Burchell River, a distance of about eight miles, the
first half consisted of a dense tea-tree brush, and the remainder
of excellent meadow land. Burchell River is itself a small
stream, navigable for boats for not more than a quarter of a
mile; but fresh down even to its entrance at low water. The
country between Burchell's River and Weatherall's three inlets
consisted entirely of fine open meadow land; and this, as far as
it was examined, to the distance of four or five miles from the
Bay. The space between the latter streams (Weatherall's inlets)
and Snapper River is a low swampy impenetrable tea-tree
brush.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Weatherall's inlets and Snapper River would
admit craft of about 50 or 60 tons burthen, a distance of about
half a mile. Both are fresh at low water. The large space
extending from the entrance of Snapper River, in a Northerly
direction to the Mountains; part of the Alpine Chain, a distance
of about twenty miles; and again from this spot, in a Westerly
direction to Port Phillip, about twenty miles, and thence to the
neck of the Isthmus, as seen in the chart--a space in all of
about twenty miles square, is in general an open undulating
country, with here and there extensive patches of excellent
meadow land, the whole of it fit for grazing, and abundantly
supplied with good water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mr. Hovell extended his investigations of the
vicinities of Western Port, until he had arrived almost on the
termination of the track of the previous journey to Port Phillip,
and been enabled to recognise a considerable number of the
mountains and other features of the country seen on that
occasion; when he was compelled to return, in consequence of the
severe indisposition of two of the people, and the inadequacy of
the supplies (which, from reasons not necessary to be explained
here, they were compelled to carry on their persons), for a more
extensive journey.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font size="4">No. VI.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The opinion that the interior of this vast
Island, is the site of an immense swamp, (if ever tenable) has
been already refuted by the late journey to Western Port (Port
Phillip) and there, therefore exists at present, at least, no
confirmed opinion, relative either to the primary or the ultimate
distribution of the vast bodies of water, which pursue their
course into the interior regions of New Holland. These streams as
far as at present known, consist of the Lachlan, the Macquarie,
the Murrambidgee, the Medway, the Hume, the Ovens, and the
Goulburn*,--seven rivers none of them inconsiderable rising among
the mountains, on the Eastern Coast, pursuing their course as it
appears, at present, along a considerable extent of plains, all
Westerly, or North-Westerly, and the whole of them contained
within the limits of 31 deg. and 37 1/2 deg. South
latitude.</font></p>

<p>* Now the Hovell--in order to prevent confusion--another
stream having, without their knowledge at the time of their
journey, been already named after the late Secretary of the
Colony.</p>

<p><font size="4">The opinion which Mr. Hovell begs to be allowed
to offer relative to these streams is, that even should the
accumulated sum total of their waters be primarily received, into
one vast reservoir, that this reservoir itself, (for the waters,
at least, of that portion of it discovered by the Colonial
Surveyor General, should it appears be fresh) has ultimately an
outlet, into the ocean; and which outlet he is induced to be of
opinion from the lowness of that portion of the Coast, as well as
from other circumstances connected with it, as observed by
himself (but when it was not in his power to make any
satisfactory examinations) will be found somewhere parallel with
Lady Julia Percy's Islands. This spot is only two degrees to the
westward of that portion of the Swamp, or Morass which lies due
West from Sydney!!</font></p>
