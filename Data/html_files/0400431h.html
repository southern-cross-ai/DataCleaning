<h2>CHAPTER I - THE TRAGEDY</h2>

<p>(<i>Saturday, August 11; 11.45 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>That sinister and terrifying crime, which came to be known as
the dragon murder case, will always be associated in my mind with
one of the hottest summers I have ever experienced in New York.</p>

<p>Philo Vance, who stood aloof from the eschatological and
supernatural implications of the case, and was therefore able to
solve the problem on a purely rationalistic basis, had planned a
fishing trip to Norway that August, but an intellectual whim had
caused him to cancel his arrangements and to remain in America.
Since the influx of post-war, <i>nouveau-riche</i> Americans along
the French and Italian Rivieras, he had forgone his custom of
spending his summers on the Mediterranean, and had gone after
salmon and trout in the streams of North Bergenhus. But late in
July of this particular year his interest in the Menander fragments
found in Egypt during the early years of this century, had revived,
and he set himself to complete their translation&mdash;a work
which, you may recall, had been interrupted by that amazing series
of Mother-Goose murders in West 75th Street.*</p>

<p>* "The Bishop Murder Case" (Scribners, 1929).</p>

<p>However, once again this task of research and love was rudely
intruded upon by one of the most baffling murder mysteries in which
Vance ever participated; and the lost comedies of Menander were
again pigeon-holed for the intricate ratiocination of crime.
Personally I think Vance's criminal investigations were closer to
his heart than the scholastic enterprises on which he was
constantly embarking, for though his mind was ever seeking out
abstruse facts in the realm of cultural lore, he found his greatest
mental recreation in intricate problems wholly unrelated to pure
learning. Criminology satisfied this yearning in his nature, for it
not only stimulated his analytical processes but brought into play
his knowledge of recondite facts and his uncanny instinct for the
subtleties of human nature.</p>

<p>Shortly after his student days at Harvard he asked me to
officiate as his legal adviser and monetary steward; and my liking
and admiration for him were such that I resigned from my father's
firm of Van Dine, Davis and Van Dine to take up the duties he had
outlined. I have never regretted that decision; and it is because
of the resultant association with him that I have been able to set
down an accurate and semi-official account of the various criminal
investigations in which he participated. He was drawn into these
investigations as a result of his friendship with John F.-X.
Markham during the latter's four years' incumbency as District
Attorney of New York County.</p>

<p>Of all the cases I have thus far recorded none was as exciting,
as weird, as apparently unrelated to all rational thinking, as the
dragon murder. Here was a crime that seemed to transcend all the
ordinary scientific knowledge of man and to carry the police and
the investigators into an obfuscous and unreal realm of demonology
and folk-lore&mdash;a realm fraught with dim racial memories of
legendary terrors.</p>

<p>The dragon has ever entered into the emotional imaginings of
primitive religions, throwing over its conceivers a spell of
sinister and terrifying superstition. And here in the city of New
York, in the twentieth century, the police were plunged into a
criminal investigation which resuscitated all the dark passages in
those dim forgotten times when the superstitious children of the
earth believed in malignant monsters and the retributive horrors
which these monsters visited upon man.</p>

<p>The darkest chapters in the ethnological records of the human
race were reviewed within sight of the skyscrapers of modern
Manhattan; and so powerful was the effect of these resuscitations
that even scientists searched for some biological explanation of
the grotesque phenomena that held the country enthralled during the
days following the uncanny and incomprehensible death of Sanford
Montague. The survival of prehistoric monsters&mdash;the
development of subterranean Ichthyopsida&mdash;the unclean and
darksome matings of earth and sea creatures&mdash;were advanced as
possible scientific explanations of the extraordinary and hideous
facts with which the police and the District Attorney's office were
faced.</p>

<p>Even the practical and hard-headed Sergeant Ernest Heath of the
Homicide Bureau was affected by the mysterious and incalculable
elements of the case. During the preliminary
investigation&mdash;when there was no actual evidence of
murder&mdash;the unim aginative Sergeant sensed hidden and ominous
things, as if a miasmatic emanation had arisen from the seemingly
commonplace circumstances surrounding the situation. In fact, had
it not been for the fears that arose in him when he was first
called to take charge of the tragic episode, the dragon murder
might never have come to the attention of the authorities. It
would, in all probability, have been recorded conventionally in the
archives of the New York Police Department as another
"disappearance," accounted for along various obvious lines and with
a cynical wink.</p>

<p>This hypothetical eventuality was, no doubt, what the murderer
intended; but the perpetrator of that extraordinary crime&mdash;a
crime, as far as I know, unparalleled in the annals of violent
homicide&mdash;had failed to count on the effect of the sinister
atmosphere which enveloped his unholy act. The fact that the
imaginative aboriginal fears of man have largely developed from the
inherent mysteries enshrouded in the dark hidden depths of water,
was overlooked by the murderer. And it was this oversight that
roused the Sergeant's vague misgivings and turned a superficially
commonplace episode into one of the most spectacular and diabolical
murder cases of modern times.</p>

<p>Sergeant Heath was the first official to go to the scene of the
crime&mdash;although, at the time, he was not aware that a crime
had been committed; and it was he who stammered out his
unidentifiable fears to Markham and Vance.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight on August 11. Markham had dined with
Vance at the latter's roof-garden apartment in East 38th Street,
and the three of us had spent the evening in a desultory discussion
of various topics. There had been a lackadaisical atmosphere over
our gathering, and the periods of silence had increased as the
night wore on, for the weather was both hot and sultry, and the
leaves of the tree-tops which rose from the rear yard were as still
as those on a painted canvas. Moreover, it had rained for hours,
the downpour ceasing only at ten o'clock, and a heavy breathless
pall seemed to have settled over the city.</p>

<p>Vance had just mixed a second champagne cup for us when Currie,
Vance's butler and major-domo, appeared at the door to the
roof-garden carrying a portable telephone.</p>

<p>"There is an urgent call for Mr. Markham," he announced; "and I
took the liberty of bringing the telephone...It's Sergeant Heath,
sir."</p>

<p>Markham looked nettled and a bit surprised, but he nodded and
took the instrument. His conversation with the Sergeant was a brief
one, and when he replaced the receiver he was frowning.</p>

<p>"That's queer," he commented. "Unlike the Sergeant. He's worried
about something&mdash;wants to see me. He didn't give any hint of
the matter, and I didn't press the point. Said he found out at my
home that I was here...I didn't like the suppressed tone of his
voice, and told him he might come here. I hope you don't mind,
Vance."</p>

<p>"Delighted," Vance drawled, settling deeper into his wicker
chair. "I haven't seen the doughty Sergeant for months... Currie,"
he called, "bring the Scotch and soda. Sergeant Heath is joining
us." Then he turned back to Markham. "I hope there's nothing
amiss...Maybe the heat has hallucinated the Sergeant."</p>

<p>Markham, still troubled, shook his head.</p>

<p>"It would take more than hot weather to upset Heath's
equilibrium." He shrugged. "Oh, well, we'll know the worst soon
enough."</p>

<p>It was about twenty minutes later when the Sergeant was
announced. He came out on the terrace garden, wiping his brow with
an enormous handkerchief. After he had greeted us somewhat
abstractedly he dropped into a chair by the glass-topped table and
helped himself to a long drink of the Scotch whisky which Vance
moved toward him.</p>

<p>"I've just come from Inwood, Chief," he explained to Markham. "A
guy has disappeared. And to tell you the truth, I don't like it.
There's something phony somewhere."</p>

<p>Markham scowled.</p>

<p>"Anything unusual about the case?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing." The Sergeant appeared embarrassed. "That's
the hell of it. Everything in order&mdash;the usual sort of thing.
Routine. And yet..." His voice trailed off, and he lifted the glass
to his lips.</p>

<p>Vance gave an amused smile.</p>

<p>"I fear, Markham," he observed, "the Sergeant has become
intuitive."</p>

<p>Heath set down his glass with a bang.</p>

<p>"If you mean, Mr. Vance, that I've got a hunch about this case,
you're right!" And he thrust his jaw forward.</p>

<p>Vance raised his eyebrows whimsically.</p>

<p>"What case, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath gave him a dour look and then grinned.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you&mdash;and you can laugh all you want
to... . Listen, Chief." He turned back to Markham. "Along about ten
forty-five tonight a telephone call comes to the Homicide Bureau. A
fellow, who says his name is Leland, tells me there's been a
tragedy out at the old Stamm estate in Inwood and that, if I have
any sense, I better hop out..."</p>

<p>"A perfect spot for a crime," Vance interrupted musingly. "It's
one of the oldest estates in the city&mdash;built nearly a hundred
years ago. It's an anachronism today, but&mdash;my word!&mdash;it's
full of criminal possibilities. Legend'ry, in fact, with an amazin'
history."</p>

<p>Heath contemplated Vance shrewdly.</p>

<p>"You got the idea, sir. I felt just that way when I got out
there...Well, anyway, I naturally asked this fellow Leland what had
happened and why I should come. And it seems that a bird named
Montague had dived into the swimming pool on the estate, and hadn't
come up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was it, by any chance, the old Dragon Pool?" inquired Vance,
raising himself and reaching for his beloved <i>R&eacute;gie</i>
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"That's the one," Heath told him; "though I never knew the name
of it till I got there tonight...Well, I told him that wasn't in my
line, but he got persistent and said that the matter oughta be
looked into, and the sooner I came the better. He talked in a funny
tone&mdash;it sorta got to me. His English was all right&mdash;he
didn't have any foreign accent&mdash;but I got the idea he wasn't
an American. I asked him why he was calling up about something that
had happened on the Stamm estate; and he said he was an old friend
of the family and had witnessed the tragedy. He also said Stamm
wasn't able to telephone, and that he had temporarily taken charge
of the situation...I couldn't get any more out of him; but there
was something about the way the fellow talked that made me
leery."</p>

<p>"I see," Markham murmured non-committally. "So you went
out?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I went out." Heath nodded sheepishly. "I got Hennessey
and Burke and Snitkin, and we hopped a police car."</p>

<p>"What did you find?"</p>

<p>"I didn't find anything, sir," Heath returned aggressively,
"except what that guy told me over the phone. There was a week-end
house-party on the estate, and one of the guests&mdash;this bird
named Montague&mdash;had suggested they all go swimming in the
pool. There'd probably been considerable drinking, so they all went
down to the pool and put on bathing suits..."</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Sergeant," Vance interrupted. "Was Leland drunk,
by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Not him." The Sergeant shook his head. "He was the coolest
member of the lot. But there was something queer about him. He
seemed greatly relieved when I got there; and he took me aside and
told me to keep my eyes open. I naturally asked him what he meant,
but right away he got casual, so to speak, and merely said that a
lot of peculiar things had happened around those parts in the old
days, and that maybe something peculiar had happened tonight."</p>

<p>"I think I know what he meant," Vance said with a slight nod.
"That part of the city has given rise to many strange and grotesque
legends&mdash;old wives' tales and superstitions that have come
down from the Indians and early settlers."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway,"&mdash;Heath dismissed Vance's comments as
irrelevant&mdash;"after the party had gone down to the pool, this
fellow Montague walked out on the spring-board and took a fancy
dive. And he never came up..."</p>

<p>"How could the others be so sure he didn't come up?" asked
Markham. "It must have been pretty dark after the rain: it's cloudy
now."</p>

<p>"There was plenty of light at the pool," Heath explained.
"They've got a dozen flood-lights on the place."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go on." Markham reached impatiently for his
champagne. "What happened then?"</p>

<p>Heath shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," he admitted. "The other men dove after him and
tried to find him, but after ten minutes or so they gave up.
Leland, it seems, told 'em that they'd all better go back to the
house and that he'd notify the authorities. Then he called the
Homicide Bureau and spilled the story."</p>

<p>"Queer he should do that," ruminated Markham. "It doesn't sound
like a criminal case."</p>

<p>"Sure it's queer," agreed Heath eagerly. "But what I found was a
whole lot queerer."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance blew a ribbon of smoke upward. "That romantic
section of old New York is at last living up to its reputation.
What were these queer things you found, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath moved again with uneasy embarrassment.</p>

<p>"To begin with, Stamm himself was cock-eyed drunk, and there was
a doctor from the neighborhood trying to get him to function.
Stamm's young sister&mdash;a good-looker of about
twenty-five&mdash;was having hysterics and going off into faints
every few minutes. The rest of 'em&mdash;there was four or
five&mdash;were trying to duck and making excuses why they had to
get away <i>pronto.</i> And all the time this fellow Leland, who
looks like a hawk or something, was going round as cool as a
cucumber with lifted eyebrows and a satisfied grin on his brown
face, as if he knew a lot more than he was telling.&mdash;Then
there was one of those sleezy, pasty-faced butlers, who acted like
a ghost and didn't make any noise when he moved..."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Vance nodded whimsically. "Everything most
mystifyin'...And the wind moaned through the pines; and an owl
hooted in the distance; and a lattice rattled in the attic; and a
door creaked; and there came a tapping&mdash;eh, what, Sergeant?
...I say, do have another spot of Scotch. You're positively
jittery." (He spoke humorously, but there was a shrewd, interested
look in his half-closed eyes and an undercurrent of tension in his
voice that made me realize that he was taking the Sergeant far more
seriously than his manner indicated.)</p>

<p>I expected the Sergeant to resent Vance's frivolous attitude,
but instead he wagged his head soberly.</p>

<p>"You got the idea, Mr. Vance. Nothing seemed on the level. It
wasn't normal, as you might say."</p>

<p>Markham's annoyance was mounting.</p>

<p>"The case doesn't strike me as peculiar, Sergeant," he
protested. "A man dives into a swimming pool, hits his head on the
bottom, and drowns. And you've related nothing else that can't be
explained on the most commonplace grounds. It's not unusual for a
man to get drunk, and after a tragedy of this kind a hysterical
woman is not to be regarded as unique. Naturally, too, the other
members of the party wanted to get away after an episode like this.
As for the man Leland: he may be just a peculiar officious
character who wished to dramatize a fundamentally simple affair.
And you always had an antipathy for butlers. However you look at
the case, it doesn't warrant anything more than the usual
procedure. It's certainly not in the province of the Homicide
Bureau. The idea of murder is precluded by the very mechanism of
Montague's disappearance. He himself suggested a swim in the
pool&mdash;a rational enough suggestion on a night like
this&mdash;and his plunge into the pool and his failure to come to
the surface could hardly be indicative of any other person's
criminal intent."</p>

<p>Heath shrugged and lighted a long black cigar.</p>

<p>"I've been telling myself the same things for the past hour," he
returned stubbornly; "but that situation at the Stamm house ain't
right."</p>

<p>Markham pursed his lips and regarded the Sergeant
meditatively.</p>

<p>"Was there anything else that upset you?" he asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p>Heath did not answer at once. Obviously there was something else
on his mind, and it seemed to me that he was weighing the
advisability of mentioning it. But suddenly he lifted himself in
his chair and took his cigar deliberately from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I don't like those fish!" he blurted.</p>

<p>"Fish?" repeated Markham in astonishment. "What fish?"</p>

<p>Heath hesitated and contemplated the end of his cigar
sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I think I can answer that question, Markham," Vance put in.
"Rudolph Stamm is one of the foremost aquarists in America. He has
a most amazin' collection of tropical fish&mdash;strange and
little-known varieties which he has succeeded in breeding. It's
been his hobby for twenty years, and he is constantly going on
expeditions to the Amazon, Siam, India, the Paraguay basin, Brazil
and Bermuda. He has also made trips to China and has scoured the
Orinoco. Only a year or so ago the papers were full of his trip
from Liberia to the Congo..."</p>

<p>"They're queer-looking things," Heath supplemented. "Some of 'em
look like sea-monsters that haven't grown up."</p>

<p>"Their shapes and their colorings are very beautiful, however,"
commented Vance with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"But that wasn't all," the Sergeant went on, ignoring Vance's
&aelig;sthetic observation. "This fellow Stamm had lizards and baby
alligators&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And probably turtles and frogs and snakes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll say he has snakes!" The Sergeant made a grimace of
disgust. "Plenty of 'em&mdash;crawling in and out of big flat tanks
of water..."</p>

<p>"Yes." Vance nodded and looked toward Markham. "Stamm, I
understand, has a terrarium along with his fish. The two often go
together, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Markham grunted and studied the Sergeant for a moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he remarked at length, in a flat, matter-of-fact
tone, "Montague was merely playing a practical joke on the other
guests. How do you know he didn't swim under water to the other
side of the pool and disappear up the opposite bank? Was it dark
enough there so the others couldn't have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Sure it was dark enough," the Sergeant told him. "The
flood-lights don't reach all across the water. But that explanation
is out. I myself thought something of the kind might have happened,
seeing as how there had been a lot of liquor going round, and I
took a look over the place. But the opposite side of the pool is
almost a straight precipice of rock, nearly a hundred feet high.
Across the upper end of the pool, where the creek runs in, there's
a big filter, and not only would it be hard for a man to climb it,
but the lights reach that far and any one of the party could have
seen him there. Then, at the lower end of the pool, where the water
has been dammed up with a big cement wall, there's a drop of twenty
feet or so, with plenty of rocks down below. No guy's going to take
a chance dropping over the dam in order to create a little
excitement. On the side of the pool nearest the house, where the
spring-board is, there's a concrete retaining wall which a swimmer
might climb over; but there again the floodlights would give him
dead away."</p>

<p>"And there's no other possible way Montague could have got out
of the pool without being seen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's one way he might have done it&mdash;but he didn't.
Between the end of the filter and the steep cliff that comes down
on the opposite side of the pool, there's a low open space of about
fifteen feet which leads off to the lower part of the estate. And
this flat opening is plenty dark so that the people on the house
side of the pool couldn't have seen anything there."</p>

<p>"Well, there's probably your explanation."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't, Mr. Markham," Heath asserted emphatically. "The
minute I went down to the pool and got the lay of the land, I took
Hennessey with me across the top of the big filter and looked for
footprints on this fifteen-foot low bank. You know it had been
raining all evening, and the ground over there is damp anyway, so
that if there had been any kind of footprints they would have stuck
out plain. But the whole area was perfectly smooth. Moreover,
Hennessey and I went back into the grass a little distance from the
bank, thinking that maybe the guy might have climbed up on a ledge
of the rock and jumped over the muddy edge of the water. But there
wasn't a sign of anything there either."</p>

<p>"That being the case," said Markham, "they'll probably find his
body when the pool is dragged...Did you order that done?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight I didn't. It would take two or three hours to get a
boat and hooks up there, and you couldn't do anything much at night
anyway. But that'll all be taken care of the first thing in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Well," decided Markham impatiently, "I can't see that there's
anything more for you to do tonight. As soon as the body is found
the Medical Examiner will be notified, and he'll probably say that
Montague has a fractured skull and will put the whole thing down as
accidental death."</p>

<p>There was a tone of dismissal in his voice, but Heath refused to
be moved by it. I had never seen the Sergeant so stubborn.</p>

<p>"You may be right, Chief," he conceded reluctantly. "But I got
other ideas. And I came all the way down here to ask you if you
wouldn't come up and give the situation the once-over."</p>

<p>Something in the Sergeant's voice must have affected Markham,
for instead of replying at once he again studied the other
quizzically. Finally he asked:</p>

<p>"Just what have you done so far in connection with the
case?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I haven't done much of anything," the
Sergeant admitted. "I haven't had time. I naturally got the names
and addresses of everybody in the house and questioned each one of
'em in a routine way. I couldn't talk to Stamm because he was out
of the picture and the doctor was working over him. Most of my time
was spent in going around the pool, seeing what I could learn. But,
as I told you, I didn't find out anything except that Montague
didn't play any joke on his friends. Then I went back to the house
and telephoned to you. I left things up there in charge of the
three men I took along with me. And after I told everybody that
they couldn't go home until I got back, I beat it down here.
...That's my story, and I'm probably stuck with it."</p>

<p>Despite the forced levity of his last remark, he looked up at
Markham with, I thought, an appealing insistence.</p>

<p>Once more Markham hesitated and returned the Sergeant's
gaze.</p>

<p>"You are convinced there was foul play?" he queried.</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced of anything," Heath retorted. "I'm just not
satisfied with the way things stack up. Furthermore, there's a lot
of funny relationships in that crowd up there. Everybody seems
jealous of everybody else. A couple of guys are dotty on the same
girl, and nobody seemed to care a hoot&mdash;except Stamm's young
sister&mdash;that Montague didn't come up from his dive. The fact
is, they all seemed damn pleased about it&mdash;which didn't set
right with me. And even Miss Stamm didn't seem to be worrying
particularly about Montague. I can't explain exactly what I mean,
but she seemed to be all upset about something else connected with
his disappearance."</p>

<p>"I still can't see," returned Markham, "that you have any
tangible explanation for your attitude. The best thing, I think, is
to wait and see what tomorrow brings."</p>

<p>"Maybe yes." But instead of accepting Markham's obvious
dismissal Heath poured himself another drink and relighted his
cigar.</p>

<p>During this conversation between the Sergeant and the District
Attorney, Vance had lain back in his chair contemplating the two
dreamily, sipping his champagne cup and smoking languidly. But a
certain deliberate tenseness in the way he moved his hand to and
from his lips, convinced me that he was deeply interested in
everything that was being said.</p>

<p>At this point he crushed out his cigarette, set down his glass,
and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Markham old dear," he said in a drawling
voice, "I think we should toddle along with the Sergeant to the
site of the mystery. It can't do the slightest harm, and it's a
beastly night anyway. A bit of excitement, however tame the ending,
might help us forget the weather. And we may be affected by the
same sinister atmospheres which have so inflamed the Sergeant's
hormones."</p>

<p>Markham looked up at him in mild astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why in the name of Heaven, should you want to go to the Stamm
estate?"</p>

<p>"For one thing," Vance returned, stifling a yawn, "I am
tremendously interested, d' ye see, in looking over Stamm's
collection of toy fish. I bred them myself in an amateur way once,
but because of lack of space, I concentrated on the color-breeding
of the <i>Betta splendens</i> and <i>cambodia</i>&mdash;Siamese
Fighting Fish, don't y' know."*</p>

<p>* At one time Vance had turned his sun-parlor into an aquarium
and devoted several years to breeding these beautiful veil-tailed
fish. He succeeded in producing corn-flower blue, deep maroon, and
even black specimens; and he won several awards with them at the
exhibitions of the Aquarium Society at the Museum of Natural
History.</p>

<p>Markham studied him for a few moments without replying. He knew
Vance well enough to realize that his desire to accede to the
Sergeant's request was inspired by a much deeper reason than the
patently frivolous one he gave. And he also knew that no amount of
questioning would make Vance elucidate his true attitude just
then.</p>

<p>After a minute Markham also rose. He glanced at his watch and
shrugged.</p>

<p>"Past midnight," he commented disgustedly. "The perfect hour, of
course, to inspect fish!...Shall we drive out in the Sergeant's car
or take yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mine, by all means. We'll follow the Sergeant." And Vance
rang for Currie to bring him his hat and stick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II - A STARTLING ACCUSATION</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 12.30 a. m</i>.)</p>

<p>A few minutes later we were headed up Broadway. Sergeant Heath
led the way in his small police car and Markham and Vance and I
followed in Vance's Hispano-Suiza. Reaching Dyckman Street, we went
west to Payson Avenue and turned up the steep winding Bolton Road.*
When we had reached the highest point of the road we swung into a
wide private driveway with two tall square stone posts at the
entrance, and circled upward round a mass of evergreen trees until
we reached the apex of the hill. It was on this site that the
famous old Stamm residence had been built nearly a century
before.</p>

<p>* This is not to be confused with Lower Bolton Road, otherwise
known as River Road, which turns off Dyckman Street near the New
York Central Hudson River railroad tracks and passes below the
Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>It was a wooded estate, abounding in cedar, oak, and spruce
trees, with patches of rough lawn and rock gardens. From this
vantage point could be seen, to the north, the dark Gothic turrets
of the House of Mercy, silhouetted against a clearing sky which
seemed to have sucked up the ghostly lights of Marble Hill a mile
distant across the waters of Spuyten Duyvil. To the south, through
the trees, the faintly flickering glow of Manhattan cast an uncanny
spell. Eastward, on either side of the black mass of the Stamm
residence, a few tall buildings along Seaman Avenue and Broadway
reached up over the hazy horizon like black giant fingers. Behind
and below us, to the west, the Hudson River moved sluggishly, a
dark opaque mass flecked with the moving lights of boats.</p>

<p>But although on every side we could see evidences of the modern
busy life of New York, a feeling of isolation and mystery crept
over me. I seemed infinitely removed from all the busy activities
of the world; and I realized then, for the first time, how strange
an anachronism Inwood was. Though this historic spot&mdash;with its
great trees, its crumbling houses, its ancient associations, its
rugged wildness, and its rustic quietude&mdash;was actually a part
of Manhattan, it nevertheless seemed like some hidden fastness set
away in a remote coign of the world.</p>

<p>As we turned into the small parking space at the head of the
private driveway, we noticed an old-fashioned Ford coupe parked
about fifty yards from the wide balustraded stone steps that led to
the house.</p>

<p>"That's the doctor's car," Heath explained to us, as he hopped
down from his machine. "The garage is on the lower road on the east
side of the house."</p>

<p>He led the way up the steps to the massive bronze front door
over which a dim light was burning; and we were met by Detective
Snitkin in the narrow panelled vestibule.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're back, Sergeant," the detective said, after
saluting Markham respectfully.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the situation either, Snitkin?" Vance asked
lightly.</p>

<p>"Not me, sir," the other returned, going toward the inner front
door. "It's got me worried."</p>

<p>"Anything else happen?" Heath inquired abruptly.</p>

<p>"Nothing except that Stamm has begun to sit up and take
notice."</p>

<p>He gave three taps on the door which was immediately opened by a
liveried butler who regarded us suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Is this really necessary, officer?" he asked Heath in a suave
voice, as he reluctantly held the door open for us. "You see, sir,
Mr. Stamm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm running this show," Heath interrupted curtly. "You're here
to take orders, not to ask questions."</p>

<p>The butler bowed with a sleek, obsequious smile, and closed the
door after us.</p>

<p>"What are your orders, sir?"</p>

<p>"You stay here at the front door," Heath replied brusquely, "and
don't let any one in." He then turned to Snitkin, who had followed
us into the spacious lower hallway. "Where's the gang and what are
they doing?"</p>

<p>"Stamm's in the library&mdash;that room over there&mdash;with
the doctor." Snitkin jerked his thumb toward a pair of heavy
tapestry porti&egrave;res at the rear of the hall. "I sent the rest
of the bunch to their rooms, like you told me. Burke is sitting out
on the rear doorstep, and Hennessey is down by the pool."</p>

<p>Heath grunted.</p>

<p>"That's all right." He turned to Markham. "What do you want to
do first, Chief? Shall I show you the lay of the land and how the
swimming pool is constructed? Or do you want to ask these babies
some questions?"</p>

<p>Markham hesitated, and Vance spoke languidly.</p>

<p>"Really, Markham, I'm rather inclined to think we should first
do a bit of what you call probing. I'd jolly well like to know what
preceded this <i>alfresco</i> bathing party, and I'd like to view
the participants. The pool will keep till later; and&mdash;one
can't tell, can one?&mdash;it may take on a different significance
once we have established a sort of social background for the
unfortunate escapade."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter to me." Markham was plainly impatient and
skeptical. "The sooner we find out why we're here at all, the
better pleased I'll be."</p>

<p>Vance's eyes were roving desultorily about the hallway. It was
panelled in Tudor style, and the furniture was dark and massive.
Life-sized, faded oil portraits hung about the walls, and all the
doors were heavily draped. It was a gloomy place, filled with
shadows, and with a musty odor which accentuated its inherent
unmodernity.</p>

<p>"A perfect setting for your fears, Sergeant," Vance mused.
"There are few of these old houses left, and I'm trying to decide
whether or not I'm grateful."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," snapped Markham, "suppose we go to the
drawing-room...Where is it, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath pointed to a curtained archway on the right, and we were
about to proceed when there came the sound of soft descending
footsteps on the stairs, and a voice spoke to us from the
shadows.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>The tall figure of a man approached us. When he had come within
the radius of flickering light thrown by the old-fashioned crystal
chandelier, we discerned an unusual and, as I thought at the time,
sinister person.</p>

<p>He was over six feet tall, slender and wiry, and gave the
impression of steely strength. He had a dark, almost swarthy,
complexion, with keen calm black eyes which had something of the
look of an eagle in them. His nose was markedly Roman and very
narrow. His cheek-bones were high, and there were slight hollows
under them. Only his mouth and chin were Nordic: his lips were thin
and met in a straight line; and his deeply cleft chin was heavy and
powerful. His hair, brushed straight back from a low broad
forehead, seemed very black in the dim light of the hallway. His
clothes were in the best of taste, subdued and well-cut, but there
was a carelessness in the way he wore them which made me feel that
he regarded them as a sort of compromise with an unnecessary
convention.</p>

<p>"My name is Leland," he explained, when he had reached us. "I am
a friend of long standing in this household, and I was a guest
tonight at the time of the most unfortunate accident."</p>

<p>He spoke with peculiar precision, and I understood exactly the
impression which the Sergeant had received over the telephone when
Leland had first communicated with him.</p>

<p>Vance had been regarding the man critically.</p>

<p>"Do you live in Inwood, Mr. Leland?" he asked casually.</p>

<p>The other gave a barely perceptible nod.</p>

<p>"I live in a cottage in Shorakapkok, the site of the ancient
Indian village, on the hillside which overlooks the old Spuyten
Duyvil Creek."</p>

<p>"Near the Indian caves?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just across what they now call the Shell Bed."</p>

<p>"And you have known Mr. Stamm a long time?"</p>

<p>"For fifteen years." The man hesitated. "I have accompanied him
on many of his expeditions in search of tropical fish."</p>

<p>Vance kept his gaze steadily upon the strange figure.</p>

<p>"And perhaps also," he said, with a coldness which I did not
then understand, "you accompanied Mr. Stamm on his expedition for
lost treasure in the Caribbean? It seems I recall your name being
mentioned in connection with those romantic adventures."</p>

<p>"You are right," Leland admitted without change of
expression.</p>

<p>Vance turned away.</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;oh, quite. I think you may be just the person to
help us with the present problem. Suppose we stagger into the
drawing-room for a little chat."</p>

<p>He drew apart the heavy curtains, and the butler came swiftly
forward to switch on the electric lights.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in an enormous room, the ceiling of which was
at least twenty feet high. A large Aubusson carpet covered the
floor; and the heavy and ornate Louis-Quinze furniture, now
somewhat dilapidated and faded, had been set about the walls with
formal precision. The whole room had a fusty and tarnished air of
desuetude and antiquity.</p>

<p>Vance looked about him and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Evidently not a popular rendezvous," he commented as if to
himself.</p>

<p>Leland glanced at him shrewdly.</p>

<p>"No," he vouchsafed. "The room is rarely used. The household has
lived in the less formal rooms at the rear ever since Joshua Stamm
died. The most popular quarters are the library and the vivarium
which Stamm added to the house ten years ago. He spends most of his
time there."</p>

<p>"With the fish, of course," remarked Vance.</p>

<p>"They are an absorbing hobby," Leland explained without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Vance nodded abstractedly, sat down and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Since you have been so kind as to offer your assistance, Mr.
Leland," he began, "suppose you tell us just what the conditions
were in the house tonight, and the various incidents that preceded
the tragedy." Then, before the other could reply, he added: "I
understand from Sergeant Heath that you were rather insistent that
he should take the matter in hand. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Quite correct," Leland replied, without the faintest trace of
uneasiness. "The failure of young Montague to come to the surface
after diving into the pool struck me as most peculiar. He is an
excellent swimmer and an adept at various athletic sports.
Furthermore, he knows every square foot of the pool; and there is
practically no chance whatever that he could have struck his head
on the bottom. The other side of the pool is somewhat shallow and
has a sloping wall, but the near side, where the
<i>caba&ntilde;as</i> and the diving-board are, is at least
twenty-five feet deep."</p>

<p>"Still," suggested Vance, "the man may have had a cramp or a
sudden concussion from the dive. Such things have happened, don't
y' know." His eyes were fixed languidly but appraisingly on Leland.
"Just what was your object in urging a member of the Homicide
Bureau to investigate the situation?"</p>

<p>"Merely a question of precaution&mdash;" Leland began, but Vance
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure. But why should you feel that caution was
necess'ry in the circumstances?"</p>

<p>A cynical smile appeared at the corners of the man's mouth.</p>

<p>"This is not a household," he replied, "where life runs
normally. The Stamms, as you may know, are an intensely inbred
line. Joshua Stamm and his wife were first cousins, and both pairs
of grandparents were also related by blood. Paresis runs in the
family. There has been nothing fixed or permanent in the natures of
the last two generations of Stamms, and life in this household is
always pushing out at unexpected angles. The ordinary family
diagrams are constantly being broken up. There is little
stabilization, either physical or intellectual."</p>

<p>"Even so"&mdash;Vance, I could see, had become deeply interested
in the man&mdash;"how would these facts of heredity have any
bearing on Montague's disappearance?"</p>

<p>"Montague," Leland returned in a flat voice, "was engaged to
Stamm's sister, Bernice."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance drew deeply on his cigarette. "You are inferring
perhaps that Stamm was opposed to the engagement?"</p>

<p>"I am making no inferences." Leland took out a long-stemmed
briar pipe and a pouch of tobacco. "If Stamm objected to the
alliance, he made no mention of it to me. He is not the kind of man
who reveals his inner thoughts or feelings. But his nature is
pregnant with potentialities, and he may have hated Montague."
Deftly he filled his pipe and lighted it.</p>

<p>"And are we to assume, then, that your calling in the police was
based on&mdash;what shall we call it?&mdash;the Mendelian law of
breeding as applied to the Stamms?"</p>

<p>Again Leland smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly&mdash;though it may have been a factor in
rousing my suspicious curiosity."</p>

<p>"And the other factors?"</p>

<p>"There has been considerable drinking here in the last
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; alcohol&mdash;that great releaser of inhibitions...But
let's forgo the academic for the time being."</p>

<p>Leland moved to the centre-table and leaned against it.</p>

<p>"The personages of this particular house-party," he said at
length, "are not above gaining their ends at any cost."</p>

<p>Vance inclined his head.</p>

<p>"That remark is more promising," he commented. "Suppose you tell
us briefly of these people."</p>

<p>"There are few enough of them," Leland began. "Besides Stamm and
his sister, there is a Mr. Alex Greeff, a reputed stock-broker, who
unquestionably has some designs on the Stamm fortune. Then there is
Kirwin Tatum, a dissipated and disreputable young ne'er-do-well,
who, as far as I can make out, exists wholly by sponging on his
friends. Incidentally, he has made something of an ass of himself
over Bernice Stamm..."</p>

<p>"And Greeff&mdash;what are his sentiments toward Miss
Stamm?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. He poses as the family's financial adviser, and I
know that Stamm has invested rather heavily at his suggestion. But
whether or not he wishes to marry the Stamm fortune is
problematical."</p>

<p>"Thanks no end...And now for the other members of the
party."</p>

<p>"Mrs. McAdam&mdash;they call her Teeny&mdash;is the usual type
of widow, talkative, gay, and inclined to overindulgence. Her past
is unknown. She is shrewd and worldly, and has a practical eye on
Stamm&mdash;always making a great fuss over him, but obviously with
some ulterior motive. Young Tatum whispered to me confidentially,
in a moment of drunken laxity, that Montague and this McAdam woman
once lived together."</p>

<p>Vance clicked his tongue in mock disapproval.</p>

<p>"I begin to sense the potentialities of the situation. Most
allurin'...Any one else to complicate this delightful social
<i>m&eacute;lange</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a Miss Steele. Ruby is her first name. She is an intense
creature, of indeterminate age, who dresses fantastically and is
always playing a part of some kind. She paints pictures and sings
and talks of her 'art.' I believe she was once on the stage...And
that completes the roster&mdash;except for Montague and myself.
Another woman was invited, so Stamm told me, but she sent in her
regrets at the last minute."</p>

<p>"Ah! Now that's most interestin'. Did Mr. Stamm mention her
name?"</p>

<p>"No, but you might ask him when the doctor gets him in
shape."</p>

<p>"What of Montague?" Vance asked. "A bit of gossip regarding his
proclivities and background might prove illuminatin'."</p>

<p>Leland hesitated. He knocked the ashes out of his pipe and
refilled it. When he had got it going again he answered with a show
of reluctance:</p>

<p>"Montague was what you might call a professional handsome-man.
He was an actor by profession, but he never seemed to get very
far&mdash;although he was featured in one or two motion pictures in
Hollywood. He always lived well, at one of the fashionable and
expensive hotels. He attended first nights and was a frequenter of
the east-side night-clubs. He had a decidedly pleasant manner and
was, I understand, most attractive to women..." Leland paused,
packed his pipe, and added: "I really know very little about the
man."</p>

<p>"I recognize the type." Vance regarded his cigarette. "However,
I shouldn't say the gathering was altogether unusual, or that the
elements involved were necess'rily indicative of deliberate
tragedy."</p>

<p>"No," Leland admitted. "But it impressed me as noteworthy that
practically every one present at the party tonight might have had
an excellent motive for putting Montague out of the way."</p>

<p>Vance lifted his eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he urged.</p>

<p>"Well, to begin with, Stamm himself, as I have said, might have
been violently opposed to Montague's marrying his sister. He is
very fond of her, and he certainly has intelligence enough to
realize that the match would have been a sorry
misalliance.&mdash;Young Tatum is certainly in a state of mind to
murder any rival for Miss Stamm's affections.&mdash;Greeff is a man
who would stop at nothing, and Montague's marrying into the Stamm
family might easily have wrecked his financial ambition to control
the fortune. Or, perhaps he actually hoped to marry Bernice
himself.&mdash;Then again, there was unquestionably something
between Teeny McAdam and Montague&mdash;I noticed it quite plainly
after Tatum had told me of their former relationship. She may have
resented his deflection to another woman. Nor is she the kind that
would tolerate being thrown over. Furthermore, if she really has
any matrimonial designs on Stamm, she may have been afraid that
Montague would spoil her prospects by telling Stamm of her
past."</p>

<p>"And what about the tense <i>boh&eacute;mienne,</i> Miss
Steele?"</p>

<p>A hard look came into Leland's face as he hesitated. Then he
said, with a certain sinister resolution:</p>

<p>"I trust her least of them all. There was some definite friction
between her and Montague. She was constantly making unpleasant
remarks about him&mdash;in fact, she ridiculed him openly, and
rarely addressed an ordinarily civil word to him. When Montague
suggested the swim in the pool she walked with him to the
<i>caba&ntilde;as,</i> talking earnestly. I could not make out what
was said, but I got a decided impression that she was berating him
for something. When we came out in our bathing suits and Montague
was about to take the first dive, she walked up to him with a leer
and said, in a tone which I could not help overhearing, 'I hope you
never come up.' And when Montague failed to appear her remark
struck me as significant...Perhaps now you can realize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;oh, quite," Vance murmured. "I can see all the
possibilities you put forth. A sweet little conclave&mdash;eh,
what?" He looked up sharply. "And what about yourself, Mr. Leland?
Were you, by any chance, interested in Montague's demise?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps more than any of the others," Leland answered with grim
frankness. "I disliked the man intensely, and I considered it an
outrage that he was to marry Bernice. I not only told her so, but I
also expressed my opinion to her brother."</p>

<p>"And why," pursued Vance dulcetly, "should you take the matter
so much to heart?"</p>

<p>Leland shifted his position on the edge of the table and took
his pipe slowly from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Miss Stamm is a very fine and unusual young woman." He spoke
with slow deliberation, as if carefully choosing his words. "I
admire her greatly. I have known her since she was a child, and
during the past few years we have become very good friends. I
simply did not think that Montague was good enough for her." He
paused and was about to continue, but changed his mind.</p>

<p>Vance had been watching the man closely.</p>

<p>"You're quite lucid, don't y' know, Mr. Leland," he murmured,
nodding slowly and looking vaguely at the ceiling. "Yes&mdash;quite
so. I apprehend that you had an excellent motive for doing away
with the dashing Mr. Montague..."</p>

<p>At this moment there came an unexpected interruption. The
porti&egrave;res of the drawing-room had been left parted, and
suddenly we heard rapid footsteps on the stairs. We turned toward
the door, and a moment later a tall, spectacular woman thrust
herself excitedly into the room.</p>

<p>She was perhaps thirty-five years old, with an unusually pallid
face and crimson lips. Her dark hair was parted in the middle and
smoothed back over her ears into a knot at the back of her neck.
She wore a long black chiffon gown which seemed to have been cut in
one piece and moulded to her figure. The only touches of color in
her costume were supplied by her jade jewelry. She wore long
pendant jade earrings, a triple jade bead necklace, jade bracelets,
several jade rings, and a large carved jade brooch.</p>

<p>As she entered the room her eyes were fixed blazingly on Leland,
and she took a few steps toward him. There was a tiger-like menace
in her attitude. Then she cast a quick glance at the rest of us,
but immediately brought her gaze back to Leland, who stood
regarding her with quizzical imperturbability. Slowly she raised
her arm and pointed at him, at the same time leaning toward him and
narrowing her eyes.</p>

<p>"There's the man!" she cried passionately, in a deep resonant
voice.</p>

<p>Vance had risen lazily to his feet and reached for his monocle.
Adjusting it, he regarded the woman mildly but critically.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," he drawled. "We have met Mr. Leland
informally. But we haven't yet had the pleasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Steele," she cut in almost viciously. "Ruby Steele.
And I could hear some of the things that were being said about me
by this man. They are all lies. He is only trying to shield
himself&mdash;to focus suspicion on others."</p>

<p>She turned her fiery eyes from Vance back to Leland and again
lifted an accusing finger.</p>

<p>"He's the man that's responsible for Sanford Montague's death.
It was he who planned and accomplished it. He hated Monty, for he
himself is in love with Bernice Stamm. And he told Monty to keep
away from Bernice, or he would kill him. Monty told me that
himself. Ever since I came to this house yesterday morning, I have
had a clutching feeling here"&mdash;she pressed her hands
dramatically against her bosom&mdash;"that some terrible thing was
going to happen&mdash;that this man would carry out his threat."
She made a theatrical gesture of tragedy, interlocking her fingers
and carrying them to her forehead. "And he has done it!...Oh, he is
sly! He is shrewd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just how, may I ask," put in Vance, in a cool, unemotional
voice, "did Mr. Leland accomplish this feat?"</p>

<p>The woman swung toward him disdainfully.</p>

<p>"The technique of crime," she replied throatily, and with
exaggerated hauteur, "is not within my province. You should be able
to find out how he did it. You're policemen, aren't you? It was
this man who telephoned to you. He's sly, I tell you! He thought
that if anything suspicious were discovered when poor Monty's body
was found, you'd eliminate him as the murderer because he had
telephoned to you."</p>

<p>"Very interestin'," nodded Vance, with a touch of irony. "So you
formally accuse Mr. Leland of deliberately planning Mr. Montague's
death?"</p>

<p>"I do!" the woman declared sententiously, extending her arms in
a studied gesture of emphasis. "And I know I'm right, though it's
true I do not know how he did it. But he has strange powers. He's
an Indian&mdash;did you know that?&mdash;an Indian! He can tell
when people have passed a certain tree, by looking at the bark. He
can track people over the whole of Inwood by broken twigs and
crushed leaves. He can tell by the moss on stones how long it has
been since they were moved or walked over. He can tell by looking
at the ashes of fires how long the flames have been out. He can
tell by smelling a garment or a hat, to whom it belongs. And he can
read strange signs and tell by the scent of the wind when the rain
is coming. He can do all manner of things of which white men know
nothing. He knows all the secrets of these hills, for his people
have lived in them for generations. He's an Indian&mdash;a subtle,
scheming Indian!" As she spoke her voice rose excitedly and an
impressive histrionic eloquence informed her speech.</p>

<p>"But, my dear young lady," Vance protested pleasantly, "the
qualities and characteristics which you ascribe to Mr. Leland are
not what one would call unusual, except in a comparative sense. His
knowledge of woodcraft and his sensitivity to odors are really not
a convincing basis for a criminal accusation. Thousands of boy
scouts would constantly be in jeopardy if that were the case."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes became sullen, and she compressed her lips into
a line of anger. After a moment she extended her hands, palms
upward, in a gesture of resignation, and gave a mirthless
laugh.</p>

<p>"Be stupid, if you want to," she remarked with forced and hollow
lightness. "But some day you'll come to me and tell me how right I
was."</p>

<p>"It will be jolly good fun, anyway," smiled Vance. <i>"Forsan et
haec olim meminisse juvabit</i>, as Vergil put it...In the
meantime, I must be most impolite and ask that you be good enough
to wait in your room until such time as we shall wish to question
you further. We have several little matters to attend to."</p>

<p>Without a word she turned and swept majestically from the
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III - THE SPLASH IN THE POOL</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 1.15 a. m</i>.)</p>

<p>During Ruby Steele's diatribe Leland had stood smoking placidly,
watching the woman with stoical dignity. He did not seem in the
least disturbed by her accusation, and when she had left the room,
he shrugged mildly and gave Vance a weary smile.</p>

<p>"Do you wonder," he asked, with a touch of irony, "why I
telephoned the police and insisted that they come?"</p>

<p>Vance studied him listlessly.</p>

<p>"You anticipated being accused of having manoeuvred Montague's
disappearance&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But I knew there would be all manner of rumors and
whisperings, and I thought it best to have the matter over with at
once, and to give the authorities the best possible chance of
clarifying the situation and fixing the blame. However, I did not
expect any such scene as we have just gone through. Needless to
tell you, all Miss Steele has just said is a hysterical
fabrication. She told but one truth&mdash;and that was only half a
truth. My mother was an Algonkian Indian&mdash;the Princess White
Star, a proud and noble woman, who was separated from her people
when a child and reared in a southern convent. My father was an
architect, the scion of an old New York family, many years my
mother's senior. They are both dead."</p>

<p>"You were born here?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was born in Inwood, on the site of the old Indian
village, Shorakapkok; but the house has long since gone. I live
here because I love the place. It has many happy associations of my
childhood, before I was sent to Europe to be educated."</p>

<p>"I suspected your Indian blood the moment I saw you," Vance
remarked, with non-committal aloofness. Then he stretched his legs
and took a deep inhalation on his cigarette. "But suppose you tell
us, Mr. Leland, just what preceded the tragedy tonight. I believe
you mentioned the fact that Montague himself suggested the
swim."</p>

<p>"That is true." Leland moved to a straight chair by the table
and sat down. "We had dinner about half-past seven. There had been
numerous cocktails beforehand, and during dinner Stamm brought out
some heavy wines. After the coffee there was brandy and port, and I
think every one drank too much. As you know, it was raining and we
could not go outdoors. Later we went to the library, and there was
more drinking&mdash;this time Scotch highballs. There was a little
music of a rowdy nature. Young Tatum played the piano and Miss
Steele sang. But that did not last long&mdash;the drinking had
begun to take effect, and every one was uneasy and restless."</p>

<p>"And Stamm?"</p>

<p>"Stamm especially indulged. I have rarely seen him drink so
much, though he has managed for years to punish liquor pretty
systematically. He was taking Scotch straight, and after he had
downed at least half a bottle I remonstrated with him. But he was
in no condition to listen to reason. He became sullen and quiet,
and by ten o'clock he was ignoring every one and dozing off. His
sister, too, tried to bring him back to his senses, but without any
success."</p>

<p>"At just what time did you go for your swim?"</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly, but it was shortly after ten. It stopped
raining about that time, and Montague and Bernice stepped out on
the terrace. They came back almost immediately, and it was then
that Montague announced that the rain had ceased and suggested that
we all take a swim. Every one was willing&mdash;every one, that is,
but Stamm. He was in no condition to go anywhere or do anything.
Bernice and Montague urged him to join us, thinking perhaps that
the water would sober him. But he was ugly and ordered Trainor to
bring him another bottle of Scotch..."</p>

<p>"Trainor?"</p>

<p>"That is the butler's name...Stamm was sodden and helpless, so I
told the others to leave him alone, and we all went down to the
<i>caba&ntilde;as.</i> I myself pushed the switch in the rear
hallway, that turns on the lights on the stairs down to the pool
and also the flood-lights at the pool. Montague was the first to
appear in his bathing suit, but the rest of us were ready a minute
or so later...Then came the tragedy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, just a moment, Mr. Leland," Vance interrupted, leaning
over and breaking the ashes of his cigarette in the fireplace. "Was
Montague the first in the water?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was waiting at the spring-board&mdash;posing, I might
say&mdash;when the rest of us came out of the
<i>caba&ntilde;as.</i> He rather fancied himself and his figure,
and I imagine there was a certain amount of vanity in his habit of
always hurrying to the pool and taking the first plunge when he
knew all eyes would be on him."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"He took a high swan dive, beautifully timed and extremely
graceful&mdash;I'll say that much for the chap. We naturally waited
for him to come up before following suit. We waited an interminable
time&mdash;it was probably not more than a minute, but it seemed
much longer. And then Mrs. McAdam gave a scream, and we all went
quickly, with one accord, to the very edge of the pool and strained
our eyes across the water in every direction. By this time we knew
something had happened. No man could stay under water voluntarily
as long as that. Miss Stamm clutched my arm, but I threw her off
and, running to the end of the spring-board, dived in as near as
possible at the point where Montague had disappeared."</p>

<p>Leland compressed his lips, and his gaze shifted.</p>

<p>"I swam downward," he continued, "till I came to the bottom of
the pool, and searched round as best I could. I came up for air and
went down again, and again I came up. A man was in the water just
beside me, and I thought for a moment it was Montague. But it was
only Tatum, who had joined me in the water. He too had dived in, in
an effort to find Montague. Greeff also, in a bungling kind of
way&mdash;he is not a very good swimmer&mdash;helped us look for
the poor fellow...But it was no go. We spent at least twenty
minutes in the effort. Then we gave it up..."</p>

<p>"Exactly how did you feel about the situation?" Vance asked,
without looking up. "Did you have any suspicions then?"</p>

<p>Leland hesitated and pursed his lips, as if trying to recall his
exact emotions. Finally he replied:</p>

<p>"I cannot say just how I did feel about it. I was rather
overwhelmed. But still there was something&mdash;I do not know just
what&mdash;in the back of my mind. My instinct at that moment was
to get to a telephone and report the affair to the police. I did
not like the turn of events&mdash;they struck me as too unusual...
Perhaps," he added, lifting his eyes to the ceiling with a far-away
look, "I remembered&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;too many tales about
the old Dragon Pool. My mother told me many strange stories when I
was a child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Quite a romantic and legend'ry spot," Vance murmured,
with a tinge of sarcasm in his words. "But I'd much rather know
just what the women were doing and how they affected you when you
joined them after your heroic search for Montague."</p>

<p>"The women?" There was a mild note of surprise in Leland's
voice, and he looked penetratingly at Vance. "Oh, I see&mdash;you
wish to know how they acted after the tragedy...Well, Miss Stamm
was crouched down on the top of the wall at the edge of the water,
with her hands pressed to her face, sobbing convulsively. I do not
think she even noticed me&mdash;or any one else, for that matter. I
got the impression that she was more frightened than anything
else.&mdash;Miss Steele was standing close beside Bernice, with her
head thrown back, her arms out-stretched in a precise gesture of
tragic supplication..."</p>

<p>"It sounds rather as if she were rehearsing for the role of
Iphigeneia at Aulis...And what about Mrs. McAdam?"</p>

<p>"Funny thing about her," Leland ruminated, frowning at his pipe.
"She was the one who screamed when Montague failed to come to the
surface; but when I got out of the water, she was standing back
from the bank, under one of the flood-lights, as cold and calm as
if nothing had happened. She was looking out across the pool in a
most detached fashion, as if there was no one else present. And she
was half smiling, in a hard, ruthless sort of way. 'We could not
find him,' I muttered, as I came up to her: I do not know why I
should have addressed her rather than the others. And without
moving her eyes from the opposite side of the pool, she said, to no
one in particular: 'So that's that.'"</p>

<p>Vance appeared unimpressed.</p>

<p>"So you came to the house here and telephoned?"</p>

<p>"Immediately. I told the others they had better get dressed and
return to the house at once, and after I had telephoned I went back
to my <i>caba&ntilde;a</i> and got into my clothes."</p>

<p>"Who notified the doctor about Stamm's condition?"</p>

<p>"I did," the other replied. "I did not enter the library when I
first came here to telephone, but when I had got into my clothes I
went at once to Stamm, hoping his mind would have cleared
sufficiently for him to realize the terrible thing that had
happened. But he was unconscious, and the bottle on the tabouret by
the davenport was empty. I did my best to arouse him, but did not
succeed."</p>

<p>Leland paused, frowned with uncertainty, and then continued:</p>

<p>"I had never before seen Stamm in a state of complete
insensibility through overindulgence in liquor, although I had seen
him pretty far gone on several occasions. The state of the man
shocked me. He was scarcely breathing, and his color was ghastly.
Bernice came into the room at that moment and, on seeing her
brother sprawled out on the davenport, exclaimed, 'He's dead, too.
Oh, my God!' Then she fainted before I could reach her. I intrusted
her to Mrs. McAdam&mdash;who showed an admirable competency in
handling the situation&mdash;and went immediately to the telephone
to summon Doctor Holliday. He has been the Stamm family physician
for many years and lives in 207th Street, near here. Luckily he was
at home and hurried over."</p>

<p>Just then a door slammed noisily somewhere at the rear of the
house, and heavy footsteps crossed the front hall and approached
the drawing-room. Detective Hennessey appeared at the door, his
mouth partly open and his eyes protruding with excitement.</p>

<p>He greeted Markham perfunctorily and turned quickly to the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Something's happened down there at the pool," he announced,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder. "I was standing by the
spring-board like you told me to do, smoking a cigar, when I heard
a funny rumbling noise up at the top of the rock cliff opposite.
And pretty soon there was a hell of a splash in the
pool&mdash;sounded like a ton of bricks had been dumped off the
cliff into the water...I waited a coupla minutes, to see if
anything else'd happen, and then I thought I'd better come up and
tell you."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything?" demanded Heath aggressively.</p>

<p>"Nary a thing, Sergeant." Hennessey spoke with emphasis. "It's
dark over there by the rocks, and I didn't go round over the filter
ledge, because you told me to keep off that low stretch at the
other end."</p>

<p>"I told him to keep off," the Sergeant explained to Markham,
"because I wanted to go over that ground again for footprints in
the daylight tomorrow." Then he turned back to Hennessey. "Well,
what do you think the noise was?" he asked with the gruffness of
exasperation.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinkin'," Hennessey retorted. "I'm simply tellin' you
all I know."</p>

<p>Leland rose and took a step toward the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"If you will pardon me, I think I can offer a reasonable
explanation of what this man heard in the pool. Several large
pieces of rock, at the top of the cliff, are loosened where the
strata overlap, and I have always had a fear that one of them might
come crashing down into the pool. Only this morning Mr. Stamm and I
went up to the top of the bluff and inspected those rocks. In fact,
we even attempted to pry one of them loose, but could not do so. It
is quite possible that the heavy rain tonight may have dislodged
the earth that was holding it."</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"At least that explanation is a pleasin' bit of rationality," he
observed lightly.</p>

<p>"Maybe so, Mr. Vance," Heath conceded reluctantly. Hennessey's
tale had disturbed him. "But what I want to know is why it should
happen on this particular night."</p>

<p>"As Mr. Leland has told us, he and Mr. Stamm attempted to pry
the rock loose today&mdash;or should I say yesterday? Perhaps they
did loosen it, and that would account for its having shifted and
fallen after the rain."</p>

<p>Heath chewed viciously on his cigar for a moment. Then he waved
Hennessey out of the room.</p>

<p>"Go back and take up your post," he ordered. "If anything else
happens down at the pool, hop up here and report
<i>pronto</i>."</p>

<p>Hennessey disappeared&mdash;reluctantly, I thought.</p>

<p>Markham had sat through the entire proceedings with an air of
tolerant boredom. He had taken only a mild interest in Vance's
questioning, and when Hennessey had left us, he got to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Just what is the point in all this discussion, Vance?" he asked
irritably. "The situation is normal enough. Admittedly it has
certain morbid angles, but all of this esoteric stuff seems to me
the result of nerves. Every one's on edge, and I think the best
thing for us to do is to go home and let the Sergeant handle the
matter in the routine way. How could there be anything premeditated
in connection with Montague's possible death when he himself
suggested going swimming and then dived off the spring-board and
disappeared while every one was looking on?"</p>

<p>"My dear Markham," protested Vance, "you're far too logical.
It's your legal training, of course. But the world is not run by
logic. I infinitely prefer to be emotional. Think of the
masterpieces of poetry that would have been lost to humanity if
their creators had been pure logicians&mdash;the Odyssey, for
instance, the <i>Ballade des dames du temps jadis</i>, the
<i>Divina Commedia,</i> Laus Veneris, the Ode on a Grecian
Urn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what do you propose to do now?" Markham cut in,
annoyed.</p>

<p>"I propose," answered Vance, with an exasperating smile, "to
inquire of the doctor concerning the condition of our host."</p>

<p>"What could Stamm have to do with it?" protested Markham. "He
seems less concerned in the affair than any of the other people
here."</p>

<p>Heath, impatient, had risen and started for the door.</p>

<p>"I'll get the doc," he rumbled. And he went out into the dim
hallway.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he returned, followed by an elderly man with
a closely cropped gray Vandyke. He was clad in a black baggy suit
with a high, old-fashioned collar several sizes too large for him.
He was slightly stout and moved awkwardly; but there was something
in his manner that inspired confidence.</p>

<p>Vance rose to greet him, and after a brief explanation of our
presence in the house, he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Leland has just told us of Mr. Stamm's unfortunate
condition tonight, and we'd like to know how he's coming
along."</p>

<p>"He's following the normal course," the doctor replied, and
hesitated. Presently he went on: "Since Mr. Leland informed you of
Mr. Stamm's condition I won't be violating professional ethics in
discussing the case with you. Mr. Stamm was unconscious when I
arrived. His pulse was slow and sluggish, and his breathing
shallow. When I learned of the amount of whisky he had taken since
dinner I immediately gave him a stiff dose of apomorphine&mdash;a
tenth of a grain. It emptied his stomach at once, and after the
reaction he went back to sleep normally. He had consumed an
astonishing amount of liquor&mdash;it was one of the worst cases of
acute alcoholism I have ever known. He is just waking up now, and I
was about to telephone for a nurse when this
gentleman"&mdash;indicating Heath&mdash;"told me you wished to see
me."</p>

<p>Vance nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Will it be possible for us to talk to Mr. Stamm at this
time?"</p>

<p>"A little later, perhaps. He is coming round all right, and,
once I get him up-stairs to bed, you may see him...But you
understand, of course," the doctor added, "he will be pretty weak
and played out."</p>

<p>Vance murmured his thanks.</p>

<p>"Will you let us know when it is convenient to have us talk to
him?"</p>

<p>The doctor inclined his head in assent.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," Vance said to Markham, "I think it might
be well to have a brief chat with Miss Stamm... Sergeant, will you
produce the young lady for us?"</p>

<p>"Just a moment." The doctor turned in the doorway. "I would ask
you, sir, not to disturb Miss Stamm just now. When I came here I
found her in a very high-strung, hysterical condition over what had
happened. So I gave her a stiff dose of bromides and told her to go
to bed. She's in no condition to be questioned about the tragedy.
Tomorrow, perhaps."</p>

<p>"It really doesn't matter," Vance returned. "Tomorrow will do
just as well."</p>

<p>The doctor went lumberingly into the hall, and a moment later we
could hear him dialing a number on the telephone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - AN INTERRUPTION</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 1.35 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>Markham heaved a deep, annoyed sigh, and focused his eyes on
Vance in exasperation.</p>

<p>"Aren't you satisfied yet?" he demanded impatiently. "I suggest
we get along home."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Markham!" Vance protested whimsically, lighting a
fresh <i>R&eacute;gie.</i> "I should never forgive myself if I went
without at least making the acquaintance of Mrs. McAdam. My word!
Really now, wouldn't you like to meet her?"</p>

<p>Markham snorted with angry resignation and settled back in his
chair.</p>

<p>Vance turned to Heath.</p>

<p>"Shepherd the butler in, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Heath went out with alacrity, returning immediately with the
butler in tow. He was a short, pudgy man in his late fifties, with
a smug, round face. His eyes were small and shrewd; his nose flat
and concave, and the corners of his mouth were pinched into a
downward arc. He wore a blond toupee which neither fitted him nor
disguised the fact that he was bald. His uniform needed pressing,
and his linen was far from immaculate; but he had an unmistakable
air of pompous superiority.</p>

<p>"I understand your name is Trainor," said Vance.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Trainor, there seems to be considerable doubt as to just
what happened here tonight. That's why the District Attorney and I
have come up." Vance's eyes were fixed on the man with appraising
interest.</p>

<p>"If I may be permitted to say so, sir," Trainor submitted in a
mincing falsetto, "I think your being here is an excellent idea.
One never can tell what is behind these mysterious episodes."</p>

<p>Vance lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"So you think the episode mysterious?...Can you tell us
something that might be helpful?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir." The man elevated his chin haughtily. "I haven't
the slightest suggestion to make&mdash;thanking you, sir, for the
honor of asking me."</p>

<p>Vance let the matter drop, and said:</p>

<p>"Doctor Holliday has just told us that Mr. Stamm had a close
call tonight, and I understand from Mr. Leland that Mr. Stamm
ordered another bottle of whisky at the time the other members of
the party went down to the pool."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I brought him a fresh quart of his favorite Scotch
whisky&mdash;Buchanan's Liqueur...although I will say, sir, in
extenuation, so to speak, that I took the liberty of protesting
with Mr. Stamm, inasmuch as he had already been drinking rather
heavily all day. But he became almost abusive, I might say; and I
remarked to myself, 'Every man to his own poison'&mdash;or words to
that effect. It was not my place, you can understand, to refuse to
obey the master's orders."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course, Trainor. We certainly do not hold
you responsible for Mr. Stamm's condition," Vance assured him
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I might say, however, that Mr. Stamm has been
quite unhappy about something these past few weeks. He's been
worrying a great deal. He even forgot to feed the fish last
Thursday."</p>

<p>"My word! Something really upsettin' must have been preying on
his mind...And did you see to it, Trainor, that the fish did not go
hungry Thursday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. I am very fond of the fish, sir. And I'm
something of an authority on the subject&mdash;if I do say so
myself. In fact, I disagree with the master quite frequently on the
care of some of his rarer varieties. Without his knowing it I have
made chemical tests of the water, for acidity and
alkalinity&mdash;if you know what I mean, sir. And I took it upon
myself to increase the alkalinity of the water in the tanks in
which the <i>Scatophagus argus</i> are kept. Since then, sir, the
master has had much better luck with them."</p>

<p>"I myself am partial to brackish water for the
<i>Scatophagus</i>," Vance commented, with an amused smile. "But we
will let that drop for the moment...Suppose you tell Mrs. McAdam
that we desire to see her, here in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>The butler bowed and went out, and a few minutes later ushered a
short, plump woman into the room.</p>

<p>Teeny McAdam's age was perhaps forty, but from her clothes and
her manner it was obvious that she was making a desperate effort to
give the impression of youth. There was, however, a hardness about
her which she could not disguise. She seemed perfectly calm as she
sat down in the chair which Vance held for her.</p>

<p>Vance explained briefly who we were and why we were there, and I
was interested in the fact that she showed no surprise.</p>

<p>"It's always well," Vance explained further, "to look into
tragedies of this kind, where there is a feeling of doubt in the
mind of any one present. And there seems to be considerable doubt
in the minds of several witnesses of Mr. Montague's
disappearance."</p>

<p>For answer the woman merely gave an arctic smile and waited.</p>

<p>"Are there any doubts in your mind, Mrs. McAdam?" Vance asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Doubts? What kind of doubts? Really, I don't know what you
mean." She spoke in a cold, stereotyped voice. "Monty is
unquestionably dead. Had it been any one else who disappeared, one
might suspect that a practical joke had been played on us. But
Monty was never a practical joker. In fact, any sense of humor was
painfully lacking in him. He was far too conceited for humor."</p>

<p>"You have known him a long time, I take it."</p>

<p>"Far too long," the woman replied, with what I thought was a
touch of venom.</p>

<p>"You screamed, I am told, when he failed to rise to the
surface."</p>

<p>"A maidenly impulse," she remarked lightly. "At my age I should,
of course, be more reserved."</p>

<p>Vance contemplated his cigarette a moment.</p>

<p>"You weren't, by any chance, expecting the young gentleman's
demise at the time?"</p>

<p>The woman shrugged, and a hard light came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, not expecting it," she returned bitterly, "but always
hoping for it&mdash;as were many others."</p>

<p>"Most interestin'," Vance murmured. "But what were you looking
for so intently across the pool, after Montague's failure to come
up?"</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed, and her expression belied the careless
gesture she made.</p>

<p>"I really do not recall my intentness at that time," she
answered. "I was probably scanning the surface of the pool. That
was natural, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;oh, quite. One does instinctively scan the water
when a diver has failed to reappear&mdash;doesn't one? But I was
given the impression your attitude was not indicative of this
natural impulse. In fact, I was led to believe that you were
looking <i>across</i> the water, to the rock cliffs opposite."</p>

<p>The woman shifted her gaze to Leland, and a slow contemptuous
smile spread over her face.</p>

<p>"I quite understand," she sneered. "This half-breed has been
trying to divert suspicion from himself." She swung quickly back to
Vance and spoke between clenched teeth. "My suggestion to you, sir,
is that Mr. Leland can tell you far more of the tragedy than any
one else here."</p>

<p>Vance nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"He has already told me many fascinatin' things." Then he leaned
forward with a half smile that did not extend to his eyes. "By the
by," he added, "it may interest you to know that a few minutes ago
there was a terrific splash in the pool, near the point, I should
say, where you were looking."</p>

<p>A sudden change came over Teeny McAdam. Her body seemed to go
taut, and her hands tightened over the arms of her chair. Her face
paled perceptibly, and she took a slow deep breath, as if to steady
herself.</p>

<p>"You are sure?" she muttered, in a strained voice, her eyes
fixed on Vance. "You are sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure...But why should that fact startle you?"</p>

<p>"There are strange stories about that pool&mdash;" she began,
but Vance interrupted.</p>

<p>"Oh, very strange. But you're not, I trust, superstitious?"</p>

<p>She gave a one-sided smile, and her body relaxed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am far too old for that." She was speaking again in
her former cold, reserved tone. "But for a moment I got jumpy. This
house and its surroundings are not conductive to calm nerves...So
there was a splash in the pool? I can't imagine what it might have
been. Maybe it was one of Stamm's flying fish," she suggested, with
an attempt at humor. Then her face hardened, and she gave Vance a
defiant look. "Is there anything else you wish to ask me?"</p>

<p>It was obvious that she had no intention of telling us anything
concerning what she may have feared or suspected, and Vance rose
listlessly to his feet.</p>

<p>"No, madam," he responded. "I have quite exhausted my
possibilities as an interrogator...But I shall have to ask you to
remain in your room for the present."</p>

<p>Teeny McAdam rose also, with an exaggerated sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, I expected that. It's so messy and inconvenient when any
one dies...But would it be against the rules and regulations if the
tubby Trainor brought me a drink?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not." Vance bowed gallantly. "I will be delighted to
send you anything you desire&mdash;if the cellar affords it."</p>

<p>"You are more than kind," she returned sarcastically. "I'm sure
Trainor can scratch me up a stinger."</p>

<p>She thanked Vance facetiously, and left the room.</p>

<p>Vance sent for the butler again.</p>

<p>"Trainor," he said, when the man entered, "Mrs. McAdam wants a
stinger&mdash;and you'd better use two jiggers each of brandy and
<i>cr&egrave;me de menthe</i>."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir."</p>

<p>As Trainor went from the room, Doctor Holliday appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>"I have Mr. Stamm in bed," he told Vance, "and the nurse is on
her way. If you care to speak to him now it will be all right."</p>

<p>The master bedroom was on the second floor, just at the head of
the main stairs, and when we entered, ushered in by Doctor
Holliday, Stamm stared at us with resentful bewilderment.</p>

<p>I could see, even as he lay in bed, that he was an unusually
tall man. His face was lined and cadaverous. His piercing eyes were
ringed with shadows, and his cheeks were hollow. He was slightly
bald, but his eyebrows were heavy and almost black. Despite his
pallor and his obviously weakened condition, it was evident he was
a man of great endurance and physical vitality. He was the type of
man that fitted conventionally into the stories of his romantic
exploits in the South Seas.</p>

<p>"These are the gentlemen that wished to see you," the doctor
told him, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>Stamm looked from one to the other of us, turning his head
weakly.</p>

<p>"Well, who are they, and what do they want?" His voice was low
and peevish.</p>

<p>Vance explained who we were, and added:</p>

<p>"There has been a tragedy here on your estate tonight, Mr.
Stamm; and we are here to investigate it."</p>

<p>"A tragedy? What do you mean by a tragedy?" Stamm's sharp eyes
did not leave Vance's face.</p>

<p>"One of your guests has, I fear, been drowned."</p>

<p>Stamm suddenly became animated. His hands moved nervously over
the silk spread, and he raised his head from the pillow, his eyes
glaring.</p>

<p>"Some one drowned!" he exclaimed. "Where? And who?...I hope it
was Greeff&mdash;he's been pestering the life out of me for
weeks."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, it was not Greeff&mdash;it was young Montague. He dived
into the pool and didn't come up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Montague." Stamm sank back on his pillow. "That vain ass!
...How is Bernice?"</p>

<p>"She's sleeping," the doctor informed him consolingly. "She was
naturally upset, but she will be all right in the morning."</p>

<p>Stamm seemed relieved, and after a moment he moved his head
wearily toward Vance.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to ask questions."</p>

<p>Vance regarded the man on the bed critically and, I thought,
suspiciously. I admit that I myself got a distinct impression that
Stamm was playing a part, and that the remarks he had made were
fundamentally insincere. But I could not say specifically what had
caused this impression. Presently Vance said:</p>

<p>"We understand that one of the guests you invited to your
week-end party did not put in an appearance."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" complained Stamm. "Is there anything so
unusual about that?"</p>

<p>"No, not unusual," Vance admitted, "but a bit interestin'. What
was the lady's name?"</p>

<p>Stamm hesitated and shifted his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ellen Bruett," he said finally.</p>

<p>"Could you tell us something about her?"</p>

<p>"Very little," the man answered ungraciously. "I haven't seen
her for a great many years. I met her on a boat going to Europe,
and I ran across her again in Paris. I know nothing of her
personally, except that she's a pleasant sort, and extremely
attractive. Last week I was surprised to receive a telephone call
from her. She said she had just returned from the Orient and
intimated that she would like to renew our acquaintance. I needed
another woman for the party; so I asked her to join us. Friday
morning she phoned me again to say she was leaving unexpectedly for
South America...That's the extent of what I know about her."</p>

<p>"Did you," asked Vance, "by any chance, mention to her the names
of the other guests you had invited?"</p>

<p>"I told her that Ruby Steele and Montague were coming. They had
both been on the stage, and I thought she might know the
names."</p>

<p>"And did she?" Vance raised his cigarette deliberately to his
lips.</p>

<p>"As I recall, she said she had met Montague once in Berlin."</p>

<p>Vance walked to the window and back.</p>

<p>"Curious coincidence," he murmured.</p>

<p>Stamm's eyes followed him.</p>

<p>"What's curious about it?" he demanded sourly.</p>

<p>Vance shrugged and halted at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"I haven't the groggiest notion&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>Stamm raised himself from the pillow and glared.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that question?"</p>

<p>"I mean simply this, Mr. Stamm:"&mdash;Vance's tone was
mild&mdash;"every one we have talked to so far seems to have a
peculiar <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> with regard to
Montague's death, and there have been intimations of foul
play&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about Montague's body?" Stamm broke in. "Haven't you found
it yet? That ought to tell the story. He probably bashed his skull
while doing a fancy dive to impress the ladies."</p>

<p>"No, his body has not yet been found. It was too late to get a
boat and grappling hooks to the pool tonight..."</p>

<p>"You don't have to do that," Stamm informed him truculently.
"There are two big gates in the stream just above the filter, and
they can be closed. And there's a turnstile lock in the dam. That
lets the water drain from the pool. I drain it every year or so, to
clean it out."</p>

<p>"Ah! That's worth knowing&mdash;eh, Sergeant?" Then to Stamm:
"Are the gates and lock difficult to manipulate?"</p>

<p>"Four or five men can do the job in an hour."</p>

<p>"We'll attend to all that in the morning then." Vance looked at
the other thoughtfully. "And, by the by, one of Sergeant Heath's
men just reported that there was quite a noisy splash in the pool a
little while ago&mdash;somewhere near the opposite side."</p>

<p>"A part of that damned rock has fallen," Stamm remarked. "It's
been loose for a long time." Then he moved uneasily, and asked:
"What difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. McAdam seemed rather upset about it."</p>

<p>"Hysteria," snorted Stamm. "Leland has probably been telling her
stories about the pool...But what are you driving at, anyway?"</p>

<p>Vance smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. But the fact that a man disappeared in
the Dragon Pool tonight seems to have impressed several people in a
most peculiar fashion. None of them seem wholly convinced that it
was an accidental death."</p>

<p>"Tommy-rot!"</p>

<p>Stamm drew himself up until he rested on his elbows, and thrust
his head forward. A wild light came into his glaring eyes, and his
face twitched spasmodically.</p>

<p>"Can't a man get drowned without having a lot of policemen all
over the place?" His voice was loud and shrill.
"Montague&mdash;bah! The world's better off without him. I wouldn't
give him tank space with my Guppies&mdash;and I feed them to the
Scalares."</p>

<p>Stamm became more and more excited, and his voice grew
shriller.</p>

<p>"Montague jumped into the pool, did he? And he didn't come up?
Is that any reason to annoy me when I'm ill?..."</p>

<p>At this moment there came a startling and blood-chilling
interruption. The door into the hall had been left open, and there
suddenly came to us, from the floor above, a woman's maniacal and
terrifying scream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V - THE WATER-MONSTER</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 2 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>There was a second of tense startled silence. Then Heath swung
round and rushed toward the door, his hand slipping into his outer
coat pocket where he carried his gun. As he reached the threshold
Leland stepped quickly up to him and placed a restraining hand on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do not bother," he said quietly. "It is all right."</p>

<p>"The hell it is!" Heath shot back, throwing off the other's hand
and stepping into the hallway.</p>

<p>Doors had begun to open along the hallway, and there were
several smothered exclamations.</p>

<p>"Get back in your rooms!" bawled Heath. "And stay in 'em." He
planted himself aggressively outside the door, glowering down the
corridor.</p>

<p>Evidently some of the guests, frightened by the scream, had come
out to see what the trouble was. But confronted with the menacing
attitude of the Sergeant and cowed by his angry command, they
returned to their quarters, and we could hear the doors close
again. The Sergeant, confused and indecisive, turned threateningly
to Leland who was standing near the door with a calm but troubled
look on his face.</p>

<p>"Where'd that scream come from?" he demanded. "And what does it
mean?"</p>

<p>Before Leland could answer Stamm raised himself to a
semi-recumbent position and glowered at Vance.</p>

<p>"For the love of God," he complained irritably, "will you
gentlemen get out of here! You've done enough damage already... .
Get out, I tell you! Get out!" Then he turned to Doctor Holliday.
"Please go up to mother, doctor, and give her something. She's
having another attack&mdash;what with all this upheaval round the
house."</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday left the room, and we could hear him mounting
the stairs.</p>

<p>Vance had been unimpressed by the whole episode. He stood
smoking casually, his eyes resting dreamily on the man in bed.</p>

<p>"Deuced sorry to have upset your household, Mr. Stamm," he
murmured. "Every one's nerves are raw, don't y' know. Hope you'll
be better in the morning...We'll toddle down-stairs&mdash;eh, what,
Markham?"</p>

<p>Leland looked at him gratefully and nodded.</p>

<p>"I am sure that would be best," he said, leading the way.</p>

<p>We went out of the room and descended the stairs. Heath,
however, remained in the hall for a moment glaring up toward the
third floor.</p>

<p>"Come, Sergeant," Vance called to him. "You're overwrought."</p>

<p>Heath finally took his hand from his coat pocket and followed us
reluctantly.</p>

<p>Again in the drawing-room, Vance settled into a chair and,
looking at Leland inquiringly, waited for an explanation.</p>

<p>Leland took out his pipe again and slowly packed it.</p>

<p>"That was Stamm's mother, Matilda Stamm," he said when he had
got his pipe going. "She occupies the third floor of the house. She
is a little unbalanced..." He made a slight but significant gesture
toward his forehead. "Not dangerous, you understand, but
erratic&mdash;given occasionally to hallucinations. She has queer
attacks now and then, and talks incoherently."</p>

<p>"Sounds like mild paranoia," Vance murmured. "Some hidden fear,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"That is it, I imagine," Leland returned. "A psychiatrist they
had for her years ago suggested a private sanitarium, but Stamm
would not hear of it. Instead he turned the third floor over to
her, and there is some one with her all the time. She is in
excellent physical health and is perfectly rational most of the
time. But she is not permitted to go out. However, she is well
taken care of, and the third floor has a large balcony and a
conservatory for her diversion. She spends most of her time
cultivating rare plants."</p>

<p>"How often do her attacks come?"</p>

<p>"Two or three times a year, I understand, though she is always
full of queer ideas about people and things. Nothing to worry
about, though."</p>

<p>"And the nature of these attacks?"</p>

<p>"They vary. Sometimes she talks and argues with imaginary
people. At other times she becomes hysterical and babbles of events
that occurred when she was a girl. Then, again, she will suddenly
take violent dislikes to people, for no apparent reason, and
proceed to berate and threaten them."</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"Typical," he mused. Then, after several deep inhalations on his
<i>R&eacute;gie,</i> he asked in an offhand manner: "On which side
of the house are Mrs. Stamm's balcony and conservat'ry?"</p>

<p>Leland's eyes moved quickly toward Vance, and he lifted his
head.</p>

<p>"On the northeast corner," he answered with a slightly rising
inflection, as if his answer were purposely incomplete.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance took his cigarette slowly from his mouth.
"Overlooking the pool, eh?"</p>

<p>Leland nodded. Then, after a brief hesitation, he said: "The
pool has a curious hold on her fancy. It is the source of many of
her hallucinations. She sits for hours gazing at it abstractedly,
and the German woman who looks after her&mdash;a capable
companion-nurse named Schwarz&mdash;tells me that she never goes to
bed without first standing in rapt attention for several minutes at
the window facing the pool."</p>

<p>"Very interestin'...By the by, Mr. Leland, do you know when the
pool was constructed?"</p>

<p>Leland frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I cannot say exactly. I know it was built by Stamm's
grandfather&mdash;that is to say, he built the dam to broaden the
water of the stream. But I doubt if he had anything in mind except
a scenic improvement. It was Stamm's father&mdash;Joshua
Stamm&mdash;who put in the retaining wall on this side of the pool,
to keep the water from straying too far up the hill toward the
house. And it was Stamm himself who installed the filter and the
gates, when he first began to use the pool for swimming. The water
was not particularly free from rubbish, and he wanted some way of
filtering the stream that fed it, and also of closing off the
inflow, so that the pool could be cleaned out occasionally."</p>

<p>"How did the pool get its name?" asked Vance casually.</p>

<p>Leland gave a slight shrug.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows. From some old Indian tradition, probably.
The Indians hereabouts originally called it by various
terms&mdash;<i>Amangaming, Amangemokdom Wikit,</i> and sometimes
<i>Amangemokdomipek&mdash;</i>but as a rule the shorter word,
<i>Amangaming,</i> was used, which means, in the Lenape dialect of
the Algonkians, the 'place of the water-monster.'* When I was a
child my mother always referred to the pool by that name, although
at that time it was pretty generally known as the Dragon Pool,
which is a fairly accurate transliteration of its original name.
Many tales and superstitions grew up around it. The
water-dragon&mdash;<i>Amangemokdom**</i> or, sometimes,
<i>Amangegach</i>&mdash;was used as a bogy with which to frighten
recalcitrant children..."</p>

<p>* I made a note of these unusual words, and years later, when
Vance and I were in California, to see the Munthe Collection of
Chinese art, I brought up the subject with Doctor M. R. Harrington,
the author of "Religion and Ceremonies of the Lenapes" and now
Curator of the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles. He explained that
<i>Amangemokdoming</i> meant "Dragon-place"; <i>Amangemokdom
Wikit,</i> "Dragon his-house"; and <i>Amangemokdomipek,</i>
"Dragon-pond." He also explained that the word <i>amangam,</i>
though sometimes translated "big fish," seems to have meant
"water-monster" as well; and that it would yield the shorter
compound <i>Amangaming.</i> This evidently was the word preferred
by the Lenapes in Inwood.</p>

<p>** In the Walum Olum the word <i>amangam</i> is translated as
"monster" and Brinton in his notes derives it from <i>amangi,</i>
"great or terrifying," and <i>names,</i> "fish with reference to
some mythical water-monster." In the Brinton and Anthony
dictionary, however, <i>amangamek,</i> the plural form, is
translated simply as "large fishes." The Indians regarded such a
creature, not as a mere animal, but as a <i>manitto,</i> or being
endowed with supernatural as well as physical power.</p>

<p>Markham got to his feet impatiently and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"This is hardly the hour," he complained, "for a discussion of
mythology."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, old dear," Vance chided him pleasantly. "I say, these
ethnological data are most fascinatin'. For the first time tonight
we seem to be getting a little forrader. I'm beginning to
understand why nearly every one in the house is filled with doubts
and misgivings."</p>

<p>He smiled ingratiatingly and turned his attention again to
Leland.</p>

<p>"By the by," he went on, "is Mrs. Stamm given to such
distressin' screams during her cloudy moments?"</p>

<p>Again Leland hesitated, but finally answered:
"Occasionally&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And do these screams usually have some bearing on her
hallucinations regarding the pool?"</p>

<p>Leland inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;always." Then he added: "But she is never coherent as
to the exact cause of her perturbation. I have been present when
Stamm has tried to get an explanation from her, but she has never
been lucid on the subject. It is as if she feared something in the
future which her momentarily excited mind could not visualize. An
inflamed and confused projection of the imagination, I should
say&mdash;without any definite mental embodiment..."</p>

<p>At this moment the curtains parted, and Doctor Holliday's
troubled face looked into the room.</p>

<p>"I am glad you gentlemen are still here," he said. "Mrs. Stamm
is in an unusual frame of mind, and insists on seeing you. She is
having one of her periodical attacks&mdash;nothing serious, I
assure you. But she seems very much excited, and she refused to let
me give her something to quiet her...I really don't feel that I
should mention these facts to you, but in the
circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have explained Mrs. Stamm's condition to these gentlemen,"
Leland put in quietly.</p>

<p>The doctor appeared relieved.</p>

<p>"That being the case," he went on, "I can tell you quite frankly
that I am a little worried. And, as I say, she insists that she see
the police&mdash;as she calls you&mdash;at once." He paused as if
uncertain. "Perhaps it might be best&mdash;if you do not mind.
Since she has this idea, a talk with you might bring about the
desired reaction...But I warn you that she is a bit hallucinated,
and I trust that you will treat her accordingly..."</p>

<p>Vance had risen.</p>

<p>"We quite understand, doctor," he said assuringly, adding
significantly: "It might be better for all of us if we talked with
her."</p>

<p>We retraced our way up the dimly lighted stairs, and at the
second-story hallway turned upward to Mrs. Stamm's quarters.</p>

<p>On the third floor the doctor led the way down a wide passage,
toward the rear of the house, to an open door through which a
rectangular shaft of yellow light poured into the gloom of the
hall. The room into which we were ushered was large and crowded
with early Victorian furniture. A dark green shabby carpet covered
the floor, and on the walls was faded green paper. The overstuffed
satin-covered chairs had once been white and chartreuse green, but
were now gray and dingy. An enormous canopied bed stood at the
right of the door, draped in pink damask; and similar damask, with
little of its color left, formed the long overdrapes at the window.
The Nottingham-lace curtains beneath were wrinkled and soiled.
Opposite the bed was a fireplace, on the hearth of which lay a
collection of polished conch shells; and beside it stood a high
spool what-not overladen with all manner of hideous trifles of the
period. Several large faded oil paintings were suspended about the
walls on wide satin ribbons which were tied in bows at the
moulding.</p>

<p>As we entered, a tall, capable-looking gray-haired woman, in a
Hoover apron, stepped aside to make way for us.</p>

<p>"You had better remain, Mrs. Schwarz," the doctor suggested as
we passed her.</p>

<p>On the far side of the room, near the window, stood Mrs. Stamm;
and the sight of her sent a strange chill through me. She was
leaning with both hands on the back of a chair, her head thrust
forward in an attitude of fearful expectancy. Even in the brilliant
light of the room her eyes seemed to contain a fiery quality. She
was a small, slender woman, but she gave forth an irresistible
impression of great strength and vitality, as if every sinew in her
body were like whipcord; and her large-boned hands, as they grasped
the back of the chair, were more like a man's than a woman's. (The
idea occurred to me that she could easily have lifted the chair and
swung it about.) Her nose was Roman and pinched; and her mouth was
a long slit distorted into a sardonic smile. Her hair was gray,
streaked with black, and was tucked back over prominent ears. She
wore a faded red silk kimono which trailed the floor, showing only
the toes of her knitted slippers.</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday made a brief, nervous presentation which Mrs.
Stamm did not even acknowledge. She stood gazing at us with that
twisted smile, as if gloating over something that only she herself
knew. Then, after several moments' scrutiny, the smile faded from
her mouth, and a look of terrifying hardness came into her face.
Her lips parted, and the blazing light in her eyes grew
brighter.</p>

<p>"The dragon did it!" were her first words to us. "I tell you the
dragon did it! There's nothing more you can do about it!"</p>

<p>"What dragon, Mrs. Stamm?" asked Vance quietly.</p>

<p>"What dragon, indeed!" She gave a scornful hollow laugh. "The
dragon that lives down there in the pool below my window." She
pointed vaguely with her hand. "Why do you think it's called the
Dragon Pool? I'll tell you why. Because it's the home of the
dragon&mdash;the old water-dragon that guards the lives and the
fortunes of the Stamms. When any danger threatens my family the
dragon arises in his wrath."</p>

<p>"And what makes you think"&mdash;Vance's voice was mild and
sympathetic&mdash;"that the dragon exercised his tutelary powers
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know!" A shrewd fanatical light came into her
eyes, and again that hideous smile appeared on her lips. "I sit
here alone in this room, year in and year out; yet I know all that
is going on. They try to keep things from me, but they can't. I
know all that has happened the last two days&mdash;I am aware of
all the intrigues that are gathering about my house. And when I
heard strange voices a while ago, I came to the top of the stairs
and listened. I heard what my poor son said. Sanford Montague dived
into the pool&mdash;and he didn't come up! He couldn't come
up&mdash;he will never come up! The dragon killed him&mdash;caught
him beneath the water and held him there and killed him."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Montague was not an enemy," Vance suggested mildly.
"Why should the protective deity of your family kill him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Montague <i>was</i> an enemy," the woman declared, pushing
the chair aside and stepping forward. "He had fascinated my little
girl and planned to marry her. But he wasn't worthy of her. He was
always lying to her, and when her back was turned he was having
affairs with other women. Oh, I've witnessed much these last two
days!"</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," nodded Vance. "But is it not possible
that, after all, the dragon is only a myth?"</p>

<p>"A myth?" The woman spoke with the calmness of conviction. "No,
he's no myth. I've seen him too often. I saw him as a child. And
when I was a young girl I talked with many people who had seen him.
The old Indians in the village saw him too. They used to tell me
about him when I would go to their huts. And in the long summer
twilights I would sit on the top of the cliff and watch for him to
come out of the pool, for water-dragons always come out after
sundown. And sometimes, when the shadows were deep over the hills
and the mists came drifting down the river, he would rise from the
water and fly away&mdash;yonder&mdash;to the north. And then I
would sit up all night at my window, when my governess thought I
was asleep, and wait for his return; for I knew he was a friend and
would protect me; and I was afraid to go to sleep until he had come
back to our pool. But sometimes, when I waited for him on the
cliff, he wouldn't come out of the pool at all, but would just
ripple the water a little to let me know he was there. And those
were the nights when I could sleep, for I didn't have to sit up and
wait for his return."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stamm's voice, as she related these strange imaginary
things, was poetic in its intensity. She stood before us, her arms
hanging calmly at her sides, her eyes, which now seemed to have
become misty, gazing past us over our heads.</p>

<p>"That's all very interestin'," Vance murmured politely; but I
noticed that he kept a steady, appraising gaze on the woman from
beneath partly lowered eyelids. "However, could not all that you
have told us be accounted for by the romantic imaginings of a
child? After all, don't y' know, the existence of dragons scarcely
fits in with the conceptions of modern science."</p>

<p>"Modern science&mdash;bah!" She turned scornful eyes on Vance
and spoke with almost vitriolic bitterness. "Science&mdash;science,
indeed! A pleasant word to cover man's ignorance. What does any man
know of the laws of birth and growth and life and death? What does
any man know of what goes on under the water? And the greater part
of the world is water&mdash;unfathomable depths of water. My son
collects a few specimens of fish from the mouths of rivers and from
shallow streams&mdash;but has he ever plumbed the depths of the
vast oceans? Can he say that no monsters dwell in those depths? And
even the few fish he has caught are mysteries to him. Neither he
nor any other fish collector knows anything about them...Don't talk
to me of science, young man. I know what these old eyes have
seen!"</p>

<p>"All that you say is quite true," Vance concurred, in a low
voice. "But even admitting that some giant flying fish inhabits
this pool from time to time, are you not attributing to him too
great an intelligence&mdash;too great an insight into the affairs
of your household?"</p>

<p>"How," she retorted contemptuously, "can any one gauge the
intelligence of creatures of whom one knows nothing? Man flatters
himself by assuming that no creature can have a greater
intelligence than his own."</p>

<p>Vance smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"You are no lover of humanity, I perceive."</p>

<p>"I hate humanity," the woman declared bitterly. "This would be a
cleaner, better world if mankind had been omitted from the scheme
of things."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course." Vance's tone suddenly changed, and he
spoke with a certain decisive positivity. "But may I ask&mdash;the
hour is getting rather late, y' know&mdash;just why you insisted on
seeing us?"</p>

<p>The woman stiffened and leaned forward. The intense hysterical
look came back into her eyes, and her hands flexed at her
sides.</p>

<p>"You're the police&mdash;aren't you?&mdash;and you're here
trying to find out things...I wanted to tell you how Mr. Montague
lost his life. Listen to me! He was killed by the dragon&mdash;do
you understand that? He was killed by the dragon! No one in this
house had anything to do with his death&mdash;no one!...That's what
I wanted to tell you." Her voice rose as she spoke, and there was a
terrific passion in her words.</p>

<p>Vance's steady gaze did not leave her.</p>

<p>"But why, Mrs. Stamm," he asked, "do you assume that we think
some one here had a hand in Montague's death?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be here if you didn't think so," she retorted
angrily, with an artful gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Was what you heard your son say, just before you screamed,"
Vance asked, "the first inkling you had of the tragedy?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" The word was an ejaculation. But she added more calmly:
"I have known for days that tragedy was hanging over this
house."</p>

<p>"Then why did you scream, Mrs. Stamm?"</p>

<p>"I was startled&mdash;and terrified, perhaps&mdash;when I
realized what the dragon had done."</p>

<p>"But how could you possibly have known," argued Vance, "that it
was the dragon who was responsible for Montague's disappearance
under the water?"</p>

<p>Again the woman's mouth twisted into a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>"Because of what I had heard and seen earlier tonight."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! About an hour ago I was standing by the window here,
looking down at the pool&mdash;for some reason I was unable to
sleep and had gotten out of bed. Suddenly I saw a great shape
against the sky, and I heard the familiar flutter of wings coming
nearer ...nearer...And then I saw the dragon sweep over the
tree-tops and down before the face of the cliff opposite. And I saw
him dive into the pool with a great splash, and I saw the white
spray rise from the water where he had disappeared... And then all
was silence again. The dragon had returned to his home."</p>

<p>Vance walked to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>"It's pretty dark," he commented. "I'm dashed if I can see the
cliff from here&mdash;or even the water."</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> can see&mdash;<i>I</i> can see," the woman
protested shrilly, turning on Vance and shaking her finger at him.
"I can see many things that other people can't see. And I tell you
I saw the dragon return&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Return?" repeated Vance, studying the woman calmly. "Return
from where?"</p>

<p>She gave a shrewd smile.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you that&mdash;I won't give away the dragon's
secret. ...But I will tell you this," she went on: "he had taken
the body away to hide it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Montague's body?"</p>

<p>"Of course. He never leaves the bodies of his victims in the
pool."</p>

<p>"Then there have been other victims?" Vance inquired.</p>

<p>"Many victims." The woman spoke in a strained sepulchral voice.
"And he always hides their bodies."</p>

<p>"It might upset your theory a bit, Mrs. Stamm," Vance pointed
out to her, "if we should find Mr. Montague's body in the
pool."</p>

<p>She chuckled in a way that sent a shiver through me.</p>

<p>"Find his body? Find his body in the pool? You can't find it.
It's not there!"</p>

<p>Vance regarded her a moment in silence. Then he bowed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Stamm, for your information and help. I trust
the episode has not disturbed you too much and that you will rest
tonight."</p>

<p>He turned and walked toward the door, and the rest of us
followed him. In the hall Doctor Holliday stopped.</p>

<p>"I'm staying up here for a while," he told Vance. "I think I can
get her to sleep now...But, for Heaven's sake, don't take anything
she said tonight seriously. She often has these little periods of
hallucinosis. It's really nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," Vance returned, shaking hands with
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - A <i>CONTRETEMPS</i></h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 2.20 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>We descended to the main hallway, and Vance led the way back to
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Well, are you through now?" Markham asked him irritably.</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>I had rarely seen Vance so serious or so reluctant to postpone
an investigation. I knew that he had been deeply interested in Mrs.
Stamm's hysterical recital; but I could not understand, at the
time, his reason for prolonging an interview that seemed to me both
futile and tragic. As he stood before the fireplace his mind seemed
far away, and there was a puzzled corrugation on his forehead. He
watched the curling smoke from his cigarette for several moments.
Suddenly, with a slight toss of the head, he brought himself back
to his surroundings and turned to Leland who was leaning against
the centre-table.</p>

<p>"What did Mrs. Stamm mean," he asked, "when she referred to
other victims whose bodies the dragon had hidden?"</p>

<p>Leland moved uneasily and looked down at his pipe.</p>

<p>"There was a modicum of truth in that remark," he returned.
"There have been two authentic deaths in the pool that I know of.
But Mrs. Stamm was probably referring also to the wild stories
which the old crones tell of mysterious disappearances in the pool
in the old days."</p>

<p>"Sounds something like the old-timers' tales of Kehoe's Hole in
Newark*...What were the two authentic cases you speak of?"</p>

<p>* Kehoe's Hole, of which the lake in West Side Park, Newark, is
the last vestige, has had a most unusual history. The once great
swamp was also called, at different times, Magnolia Swamp and
Turtle Ditch, and an enterprising newspaper reporter has dubbed the
present lake Suicide Lake. The old swamp had the distinction of
being considered bottomless; and many strange tales are told, by
the old-timers and pseudo-archivists in the neighborhood, of
mysterious drownings in its waters, and of the remarkable
disappearances of the bodies despite every effort to find them. One
story tells of the disappearance beneath its surface of a team of
horses and a wagon. These amazing tales&mdash;extending over a
period of forty years or more&mdash;may be accounted for by the
fact that there were once quicksands in parts of the swamp. But
tradition still has it that the bottom of the present lake has not
been fathomed and that once a body sinks beneath its surface, it is
never found.</p>

<p>"One happened about seven years ago, shortly after Stamm and I
returned from our expedition to Cocos Island. Two suspicious
characters were scouting the neighborhood&mdash;probably with a
view to burglary&mdash;and one of them fell off the cliff on the
far side of the pool, and was evidently drowned. Two schoolgirls
from this vicinity saw him fall, and later the police picked up his
companion who eventually, under questioning, verified the other's
disappearance."</p>

<p>"Disappearance?"</p>

<p>Leland nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"His body was never found."</p>

<p>There was the suggestion of a skeptical smile on Vance's mouth
as he asked: "How do you account for that?"</p>

<p>"There is only one sensible way of accounting for it," answered
Leland, with a slightly aggressive accent, as if endeavoring to
convince himself with his own words. "The stream gets swollen at
times, and there is quite a flow of water over the
dam&mdash;sufficient to carry a floating body over, if it happened
to be caught by the current at a certain angle. This fellow's body
was probably washed over the dam and carried down to the Hudson
River."</p>

<p>"A bit far-fetched, but none the less tenable...And the other
case?"</p>

<p>"Some boys trespassed here one afternoon and went swimming. One
of them, as I recall, dived from a ledge of the cliff into the
shallow water, and did not come up. As soon as the authorities were
notified&mdash;by an unidentified telephone call,
incidentally&mdash;the pool was drained, but there was no trace of
the body. Later, however, after the newspapers had made a two-days'
sensation of the affair, the boy's body was found in the Indian
Cave on the other side of the Clove. He had fractured his
skull."</p>

<p>"And do you, by any chance, have an explanation for that episode
also?" Vance asked, with a tinge of curtness.</p>

<p>Leland shot him a quick glance.</p>

<p>"I should say the boy struck his head in diving, and the other
boys in the party became frightened and, not wanting to leave the
body in the pool, lest they become involved, carried it down to the
cave and hid it. It was probably one of them that telephoned to the
police."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite. Very simple, don't y' know." Vance looked into space
meditatively. "Yet both cases have ample esoteric implications to
have taken root in Mrs. Stamm's weakened mind."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," Leland agreed.</p>

<p>A short silence ensued. Vance walked slowly across the room and
back, his hands in his outer coat pockets, his head forward on his
chest, his cigarette drooping from his lips. I knew what this
attitude signified:&mdash;some stimulus had suddenly roused a train
of thought in his mind. He again took up his position before the
mantel and crushed out his cigarette on the hearth. He slowly
turned his head toward Leland.</p>

<p>"You mentioned your expedition to Cocos Island," he said lazily.
"Was it the lure of the <i>Mary Dear</i> treasure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The other famous caches are all too vague. Captain
Thompson's treasure, however, is undeniably real and unquestionably
the largest."</p>

<p>"Did you use the Keating map?"*</p>

<p>* What is purported to be the Keating map, or a copy of it, has
been almost generally used by treasure seekers on Cocos Island. It
is supposed to have been made by Captain Thompson himself, who left
it to a friend named Keating. Keating, with a Captain Bogue,
outfitted an expedition to the island. There was mutiny on board
the boat, and Bogue died on the island; but Keating miraculously
escaped. At his death his widow turned the map over to Nicholas
Fitzgerald, who, in turn, willed it to Commodore Curzon-Howe of the
British navy.</p>

<p>"Not altogether." Leland seemed as puzzled as the rest of us by
Vance's line of questioning. "It is hardly authentic now, and I
imagine several purely romantic directions entered into
it&mdash;such as the stone turnstile to the cave. Stamm ran across
an old map in his travels, which antedated, by many years, the
original British survey of Cocos Island of 1838. So similar was it
to this chart that he believed it to be genuine. We followed the
directions on this map, checking them with the navigators' chart in
the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy Department."</p>

<p>"Did this map of Stamm's," pursued Vance, "indicate the treasure
as hidden in one of the island caves?"</p>

<p>"The details were a bit hazy on that point. And that was what so
impressed Stamm and, I must confess, myself also. You see, this old
map differed in one vital respect from the United States Navy
navigators' chart, in that it indicated land where the United
States chart shows Wafer Bay; and it was on this section of land
that the hiding-place of the treasure was indicated."</p>

<p>A flicker came into Vance's eyes, but when he spoke his tone was
casual and but mildly animated.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I see the point. Most interestin'. There's no doubt
that landslides and tropical rains have altered the topography of
Cocos Island, and many of the old landmarks have doubtless
disappeared. I presume Mr. Stamm assumed that the land where the
treasure was originally hidden now lies under the waters of the bay
which is indicated on the more recent charts."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Even the French survey of 1889 did not show as large a
bay as the American survey made in 1891; and it was Stamm's theory
that the treasure lay beneath the waters of Wafer Bay, which is
rather shallow at that spot."</p>

<p>"A difficult undertaking," Vance commented. "How long were you
at the island?"</p>

<p>"The better part of three months." Leland smiled ruefully. "It
took Stamm that length of time to realize that he did not possess
the proper equipment. The shoals in the bay are treacherous, and
there are curious holes at the bottom of the water, owing, no
doubt, to geological conditions; and our diving equipment would
have been scorned by any good pearl-fisher. What we needed, of
course, was a specially constructed diving-bell, something like Mr.
Beebe's bathysphere. Even that would have been just a beginning,
for we were helpless without powerful submarine dredges. The one we
took along was wholly inadequate..."</p>

<p>Markham, who had been noticeably chafing under Vance's
discussion of hidden treasure, now rose and strode forward, his
cigar held tightly between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Where is all this getting us, Vance? If you are contemplating a
trip to Cocos Island, I'm sure Mr. Leland would be willing to make
a future appointment with you to discuss the details. And as for
all the other investigations you have made here tonight: I can't
see that anything has been brought to light that hasn't an entirely
normal and logical explanation."</p>

<p>Heath, who had been following all the proceedings closely, now
projected himself into the conversation.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about things around here being normal, sir."
Though deferential, his tone was vigorous. "I'm for going ahead
with this case. Some mighty queer things have happened tonight, and
I don't like 'em."</p>

<p>Vance smiled appreciatively at the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Stout fella!" He glanced toward Markham. "Another half-hour and
we'll stagger home."</p>

<p>Markham gave in ungraciously.</p>

<p>"What more do you want to do here tonight?"</p>

<p>Vance lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>"I could bear to commune with Greeff...Suppose you tell the
butler to fetch him, Sergeant."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Alex Greeff was ushered into the
drawing-room by Trainor. He was a large, powerfully built man, with
a ruddy bulldog type of face&mdash;wide-spaced eyes, a short, thick
nose, heavy lips, and a strong, square chin. He was slightly bald,
and there were cushions of gray hair over his small, close-set
ears. He was wearing a conventional dinner suit, but there were
certain touches of vulgar elegance in his attire. The satin lapels
of his coat were highly peaked. There were two diamond studs in his
shirt-bosom. Across his satin waistcoat was draped a platinum chain
set with large pearls. His tie, instead of being solid black, had
white pin-stripes running through it; and his wing collar seemed
too high for his stocky neck.</p>

<p>He took a few steps toward us with his hands in his pockets,
planted himself firmly, and glowered at us angrily.</p>

<p>"I understand one of you gentlemen is the District
Attorney&mdash;" he began aggressively.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite." Vance indicated Markham with a careless movement of
the hand.</p>

<p>Greeff now centred his bellicose attention on Markham.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps <i>you</i> can tell me, sir," he growled, "why I
am being held a virtual prisoner in this house. This
man"&mdash;indicating Heath&mdash;"ordered me to remain in my room
until further notice, and refused to let me go home. What is the
meaning of such high-handed tactics?"</p>

<p>"A tragedy has taken place here tonight, Mr. Greeff&mdash;"
Markham began, but he was interrupted by the other.</p>

<p>"Suppose an accident <i>has</i> happened, is that any reason why
I should be held a prisoner without due process of law?"</p>

<p>"There are certain phases of the case," Markham told him, "that
we are looking into, and it was to facilitate the investigation
that Sergeant Heath requested all the witnesses to remain here
until we could question them."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead and question me." Greeff seemed a little
mollified, and his tone had lost some of its belligerency.</p>

<p>Vance moved forward.</p>

<p>"Sit down and have a smoke, Mr. Greeff," he suggested
pleasantly. "We sha'n't keep you long."</p>

<p>Greeff hesitated, looked at Vance suspiciously; then shrugged,
and drew up a chair. Vance waited until the man had fitted a
cigarette into a long jewelled holder, and then asked:</p>

<p>"Did you notice&mdash;or sense&mdash;anything peculiar about
Montague's disappearance in the pool tonight?"</p>

<p>"Peculiar?" Greeff looked up slowly, and his eyes narrowed to
shrewd slits. "So that's the angle, is it? Well, I'm not saying
there wasn't something peculiar about it, now that you mention it;
but I'm damned if I can tell you what it was."</p>

<p>"That seems to be the general impression," Vance returned; "but
I was hoping you might be more lucid on the point than the others
have been."</p>

<p>"What's there to be lucid about?" Greeff seemed to be avoiding
the issue. "I suppose it's reasonable enough when a chap like
Montague&mdash;who's always been riding for a fall&mdash;gets
what's coming to him. But somehow, when it happens so neatly and at
the right time, we're apt to think it's peculiar."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course. But it wasn't the logical eventualities I
was referring to." Vance's voice held a tinge of annoyance. "I was
referring to the fact that the conditions in the house here during
the last two days constituted a perfect atmosphere for a type of
tragedy quite removed from the merely accidental."</p>

<p>"You're right about the atmosphere." Greeff spoke harshly.
"There was murder in the air&mdash;if that's what you mean. And if
Montague had passed out by any other means except drowning, I'd say
his death warranted a pretty thorough investigation. But he wasn't
poisoned; he wasn't accidentally shot; he didn't get vertigo and
fall out of a window; and he didn't tumble down-stairs and break
his neck. He simply dived off a spring-board, with every one
looking on."</p>

<p>"That's what makes it so difficult, don't y' know...I understand
that you and Mr. Leland and young Tatum dived in after the
johnny."</p>

<p>"It was the least we could do," Greeff came back pugnaciously;
"though I'm frank to admit it was more or less a gesture on my
part, as I can't swim much, and if I had run into him he'd probably
have dragged me down with him. Still, you hate to see any fellow,
however rotten, pass out of this world in front of your eyes
without making some attempt to save him."</p>

<p>"Quite noble of you, I'm sure," Vance murmured indifferently.
"By the by, I understand Montague was engaged to Miss Stamm."</p>

<p>Greeff nodded and drew on his cigarette.</p>

<p>"I never knew why it was, except that good women always fall for
that type of man," he commented, with a philosophic air. "But I
think she would have broken the engagement sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Would you mind my asking what your own feelings toward Miss
Stamm are?"</p>

<p>Greeff opened his eyes in surprise, then laughed noisily.</p>

<p>"I see what you're getting at. But you can't make me out the
villain of the piece. I like Bernice&mdash;everybody who knows her
likes her. But as for my being sentimental about her: I'm too old
and wise for that. My feeling for her has always been a fatherly
one. She often comes to me for advice when Stamm's too deep in his
cups. And I give her good advice&mdash;yes, by Gad! I told her only
yesterday that she was making a fool of herself to think of
marrying Montague."</p>

<p>"How did she take this advice, Mr. Greeff?"</p>

<p>"The way all women take advice&mdash;haughtily and
contemptuously. No woman ever wants advice. Even when they ask for
it, they're merely looking for agreement with what they've already
decided to do."</p>

<p>Vance changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Just what do you think happened to Montague tonight?"</p>

<p>Greeff spread his hands vaguely.</p>

<p>"Bumped his head on the bottom&mdash;or got a cramp. What else
could have happened to him?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the vaguest notion," Vance admitted blandly. "But the
episode is teeming with possibilities. I was hopin', don't y' know,
that you might help to lead us out of our darkness." He spoke
lightly, but his eyes were fixed with cold steadiness on the man
opposite.</p>

<p>Greeff returned the gaze for several moments in silence, and his
ruddy face tightened into a mask.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly," he enunciated at length, in a chill,
even tone. "But my advice to you, my friend, is to forget it.
Montague had it coming to him, and he got it. It was an accident
that fitted in with everybody's wishes. You can play with the idea
till doomsday, but you'll end up with the fact I'm telling you now:
<i>Montague was accidentally drowned."</i></p>

<p>Vance smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"My word! Are you intimatin' that Montague's death is that
liter'ry pet of the armchair criminologists&mdash;the perfect
crime?"</p>

<p>Greeff moved forward in his chair and set his jaw.</p>

<p>"I'm not intimating anything, my friend. I'm merely telling
you."</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, we're dashed grateful." Vance crushed out his
cigarette. "Anyway, I think we'll do a bit of pryin' around.
..."</p>

<p>At this moment there came an interruption. We heard what sounded
like a scuffle on the stairs, and there came to us the angry,
shrill tones of Stamm's voice:</p>

<p>"Let go of my arm. I know what I'm doing."</p>

<p>And then Stamm jerked the drawing-room porti&egrave;res aside
and glared at us. Behind him, fuming and remonstrative, stood
Doctor Holliday. Stamm was clad in his pajamas, and his hair was
dishevelled. It was obvious that he had just risen from bed. He
fixed his watery eyes on Greeff with angry apprehension.</p>

<p>"What are you telling these policemen?" he demanded, bracing
himself against the door jamb.</p>

<p>"My dear Rudolf," Greeff protested ingratiatingly, rising from
his chair. "I'm telling them nothing. What is there to tell?"</p>

<p>"I don't trust you," Stamm retorted. "You're trying to make
trouble. You're always trying to make trouble here. You've tried to
turn Bernice against me, and now, I'll warrant, you're trying to
turn these policemen against me." His eyes glared, and he had begun
to tremble. "I know what you're after&mdash;money! But you're not
going to get it. You think that if you talk enough you can
blackmail me..." His voice sank almost to a whisper, and his words
become incoherent.</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday took him gently by the arm and tried to lead him
from the room, but Stamm, with an exhausting effort, threw him off
and moved unsteadily forward.</p>

<p>Greeff had stood calmly during this tirade, looking at his
accuser with an expression of commiseration and pity.</p>

<p>"You're making a great mistake, old friend," he said in a quiet
voice. "You're not yourself tonight. Tomorrow you'll realize the
injustice of your words, just as you'll realize that I would never
betray you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't, eh?" Much of the anger had gone out of
Stamm's attitude, but he still seemed to be dominated by the idea
of Greeff's persecution. "I suppose you haven't been telling these
people"&mdash;he jerked his head toward us&mdash;"what I said about
Montague&mdash;"</p>

<p>Greeff raised his hand in protest and was about to reply, but
Stamm went on hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I did say it! I had more right to say it than any
one else. And as far as that goes, you've said worse things. You
hated him more than I did." Stamm cackled unpleasantly. "And I know
why. You haven't pulled the wool over my eyes about your feelings
for Bernice." He raised his arm and wagged a quivering finger at
Greeff. "If anybody murdered Montague, it was you!"</p>

<p>Exhausted by his effort, he sank into a chair and began to shake
as if with palsy.</p>

<p>Vance stepped quickly to the stricken man.</p>

<p>"I think a grave mistake has been made here tonight, Mr. Stamm,"
he said in a kindly but determined voice. "Mr. Greeff has reported
nothing to us that you have said. No remark he has made to us could
possibly be construed as disloyalty to you. I'm afraid you're a bit
overwrought."</p>

<p>Stamm looked up blearily, and Greeff went to his side, placing a
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, old friend," he said, "you need rest."</p>

<p>Stamm hesitated. A weary sob shook his body and he permitted
Greeff and Doctor Holliday to lift him from the chair and lead him
to the door.</p>

<p>"That will be all tonight, Mr. Greeff," Vance said. "But we will
have to ask you to remain here till tomorrow."</p>

<p>Greeff turned his head and nodded over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right." And he and the doctor piloted Stamm
across the hallway toward the stairs.</p>

<p>A moment later the front door-bell rang. Trainor admitted the
nurse for whom Doctor Holliday had telephoned and led her
immediately up-stairs.</p>

<p>Vance turned from the door, where he had been standing, and came
back into the room, halting before Leland who had remained passive
throughout the strange scene between Stamm and Greeff.</p>

<p>"Have you, by any chance," he asked, "any comments to make on
the little <i>contretemps</i> we have just witnessed?"</p>

<p>Leland frowned and inspected the bowl of his pipe.</p>

<p>"No-o," he replied, after a pause, "except that it is obvious
Stamm is frightfully on edge and in a state of shock after his
excessive drinking tonight...And it might be, of course," he
supplemented, "that in the back of his mind there has been a
suspicion of Greeff in connection with financial matters, which
came to the surface in his weakened condition."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable," Vance mused. "But why should Stamm
mention the word murder?"</p>

<p>"He is probably excited and suspicious because of the presence
of you gentlemen here," Leland suggested. "Not having been a
witness to the tragedy, he is ignorant of all the details."</p>

<p>Vance did not reply. Instead he walked to the mantelpiece and
inspected a carved gold clock which stood there. He ran his fingers
over the incised scroll-work for a moment, and then turned slowly.
His face was serious, and his eyes were looking past us.</p>

<p>"I think that will be all for tonight," he said in a flat,
far-away tone. "Thank you for your help, Mr. Leland. But we must
ask you too to remain here till tomorrow. We will be here again in
the morning."</p>

<p>Leland bowed and, without a word, went softly from the room.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Markham rose.</p>

<p>"So you're coming here again in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old dear." Vance's manner had suddenly changed. "And so
are you, don't y' know. You owe it to your constituency. It's a
most absorbin' case. And I'd wager one of my Cezanne water-colors
that when Montague's body is found, the Medical Examiner's report
will be anything but what you expect."</p>

<p>Markham's eyelids fluttered, and he looked searchingly at
Vance.</p>

<p>"You think you have learned something that would point to an
explanation other than accidental death?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've learned an amazin' amount," was all that Vance would
vouchsafe. And Markham knew him well enough not to push the matter
further at that time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII - THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 9.30 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>At half-past nine the following day Vance drove to Markham's
quarters to take him back to the old Stamm estate in Inwood. On the
way home the night before, Markham had protested mildly against
continuing the case before the Medical Examiner had made his
report; but his arguments were of no avail. So determined was Vance
to return to the house next day, that Markham was impressed. His
long association with Vance had taught him that Vance never made
such demands without good reason.</p>

<p>Vance possessed what is commonly called an intuitive mind, but
it was, in fact, a coldly logical one, and his decisions, which
often seemed intuitive, were in reality based on his profound
knowledge of the intricacies and subtleties of human nature. In the
early stages of any investigation he was always reluctant to tell
Markham all that he suspected: he preferred to wait until he had
the facts in hand. Markham, understanding this trait in him, abided
by his unexplained decisions; and these decisions had rarely, to my
knowledge, proved incorrect, founded, as they were, on definite
indications which had not been apparent to the rest of us. It was
because of Markham's past experiences with Vance that he had
grudgingly, but none the less definitely, agreed to accompany him
to the scene of the tragedy the following morning.</p>

<p>Before we left the Stamm house the night before, there had been
a brief consultation with Heath, and a course of action had been
mapped out under Vance's direction. Every one in the house was to
remain indoors; but no other restrictions were to be placed upon
their actions. Vance had insisted that no one be allowed to walk
through the grounds of the estate until he himself had made an
examination of them; and he was particularly insistent that every
means of access to the pool be kept entirely free of people until
he had completed his inspection. He was most interested, he said,
in the small patch of low ground north of the filter, where Heath
and Hennessey had already looked for footprints.</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday was to be permitted to come and go as he chose,
but Vance suggested that the nurse whom the doctor had called in be
confined to the house, like the others, until such time as she was
given permission to depart. Trainor was ordered to instruct the
other servants&mdash;of whom there were only two, a cook and a
maid&mdash;that they were to remain indoors until further
notice.</p>

<p>Vance also suggested that the Sergeant place several of his men
around the house at vantage points where they could see that all
orders were carried out by the guests and members of the household.
The Sergeant was to arrange for a small corps of men to report at
the estate early the following morning to close the gates above the
filter and open the lock in the dam, in order that the pool might
be drained.</p>

<p>"And you'd better see that they come down the stream from the
East Road, Sergeant," Vance advised, "so there won't be any new
footprints round the pool."</p>

<p>Heath was placed in complete charge of the case by Markham, who
promised to get the official verification of the assignment from
Commanding Officer Moran of the Detective Bureau.</p>

<p>Heath decided to remain at the house that night. I had never
seen him in so eager a frame of mind. He admitted frankly that he
could see no logic in the situation; but, with a stubbornness which
verged on fanaticism, he maintained that he knew something was
vitally wrong.</p>

<p>I was also somewhat astonished at Vance's intense interest in
the case. Heretofore he had taken Markham's criminal investigations
with a certain nonchalance. But there was no indifference in his
attitude in the present instance. That Montague's disappearance
held a fascination for him was evident. This was owing, no doubt,
to the fact that he had seen, or sensed, certain elements in the
affair not apparent to the rest of us. That his attitude was
justified is a matter of public record, for the sinister horror of
Montague's death became a national sensation; and Markham, with
that generosity so characteristic of him, was the first to admit
that, if it had not been for Vance's persistence that first night,
one of the shrewdest and most resourceful murderers of modern times
would have escaped justice.</p>

<p>Although it was long past three in the morning when we arrived
home, Vance seemed loath to go to bed. He sat down at the piano and
played that melancholy yet sublime and passionate third movement
from Beethoven's Sonata, Opus 106; and I knew that not only was he
troubled, but that some deep unresolved intellectual problem had
taken possession of his mind. When he had come to the final major
chord he swung round on the piano bench.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go to bed, Van?" he asked somewhat abstractedly.
"We have a long, hard day ahead of us. I've a bit of reading to do
before I turn in." He poured himself some brandy and soda and,
taking the glass with him, went into the library.</p>

<p>For some reason I was too nervous to try to sleep. I picked up a
copy of "Marius the Epicurean," which was lying on the
centre-table, and sat down at the open window. Over an hour later,
on my way to my room, I looked in at the library door, and there
sat Vance, his head in his hands, absorbed in a large quarto volume
which lay on the table before him. A score of books, some of them
open, were piled haphazardly about him, and on the stand at his
side was a sheaf of yellowed maps.</p>

<p>He had heard me at the door, for he said: "Fetch the Napoleon
and soda, will you, Van? There's a good fellow."</p>

<p>As I placed the bottles in front of him I looked over his
shoulder. The book he was reading was an old illuminated copy of
"Malleus Maleficarum." At one side, opened, lay Elliot Smith's "The
Evolution of the Dragon" and Remy's "Demonolatry." At his other
side was a volume of Howey's work on ophiolatry.</p>

<p>"Mythology is a fascinatin' subject, Van," he remarked. "And
many thanks for the cognac." He buried himself in his reading
again; and I went to bed.</p>

<p>Vance was up before I was the next morning. I found him in the
living-room, dressed in a tan silk poplin suit, sipping his
matutinal Turkish coffee and smoking a <i>R&eacute;gie.</i></p>

<p>"You'd better ring for Currie," he greeted me, "and order your
plebeian breakfast. We're picking up the reluctant District
Attorney in half an hour."</p>

<p>We had to wait nearly twenty minutes in Vance's car before
Markham joined us. He was in execrable mood, and his greeting to
us, as he stepped into the tonneau, was barely amiable.</p>

<p>"The more I think of this affair, Vance," he complained, "the
more I'm convinced that you're wasting your time and mine."</p>

<p>"What else have you to do today?" Vance asked dulcetly.</p>

<p>"Sleep, for one thing&mdash;after your having kept me up most of
the night. I was slumbering quite peacefully when the hall boy rang
my phone and told me that you were waiting for me."</p>

<p>"Sad...sad." Vance wagged his head in mock commiseration. "By
Jove, I do hope you sha'n't be disappointed."</p>

<p>Markham grunted and lapsed into silence; and little more was
said during our ride to the Stamm estate. As we drove up the
circular roadway and came to a halt in the parking-space in front
of the house, Heath, who had evidently been waiting for us, came
down the stairs to meet us. He seemed disgruntled and ill at ease,
and I noticed also that there was a skepticism and insecurity in
his manner, as if he distrusted his suspicions of the night
before.</p>

<p>"Things are moving," he reported half-heartedly; "but nothing's
happened yet. Everything is going smoothly indoors, and the whole
outfit is acting like human beings for a change. They all had
breakfast together, like a lot of turtle-doves."</p>

<p>"That's interestin'," Vance remarked. "What about Stamm?"</p>

<p>"He's up and about. Looks a little green around the gills; but
he's already taken two or three eye-openers."</p>

<p>"Has Miss Stamm put in an appearance this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Heath looked puzzled. "But there's something queer about
that dame. She was having hysterics last night and fainting in
every open space; but this morning she's bright and snappy,
and&mdash;if you ask me&mdash;she seems relieved that her
boy-friend is out of the way."</p>

<p>"On whom did she lavish her attentions this morning, Sergeant?"
Vance asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" returned Heath, in an injured tone. "They
didn't ask me to eat at the table with 'em&mdash;I was lucky to get
any groceries at all...But I noticed that after breakfast she and
Leland went into the drawing-room alone and had a long
palaver."</p>

<p>"Really now." Vance meditated a moment, regarding his cigarette
critically. "Very illuminatin'."</p>

<p>"Well, well," snorted Markham, giving Vance a disdainful look.
"I suppose you regard that fact as an indication that your plot is
thickening?"</p>

<p>Vance looked up facetiously.</p>

<p>"Thickening? My dear Markham! The plot is positively congealin',
not to say stiffenin'." He sobered and turned back to Heath. "Any
news from Mrs. Stamm?"</p>

<p>"She's all right today. The doctor was here a little while ago.
He looked over the situation and said there was no more need of his
services at the present. Said he'd be back this afternoon,
though...And speaking of doctors, I telephoned to Doc Doremus* and
asked him to hop out here. I figured it was Sunday and I might not
be able to catch him later; and we'll have Montague's body in a
little while."</p>

<p>* Doctor Emanuel Doremus, Chief Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>"Your men have got the pool gates closed then?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But it was a tough job. One of the gates had got
water-logged. Anyway, they're all set now. Luckily the stream was
pretty low and there wasn't much of a flow of water. The dam lock
was corroded, too, but we hammered it open. It'll take about
another hour for the pool to drain, according to Stamm...By the
way, he wanted to go down and supervise the operations, but I told
him we could get along without him."</p>

<p>"It was just as well," nodded Vance. "Have your men put a screen
of some kind over the lock in the dam? The body might go through,
don't y' know."</p>

<p>"I thought of that too," Heath returned with a little
self-satisfaction. "But it's all right. There was a coarse wire
mesh already over the lock."</p>

<p>"Any visitors at the house this morning?" Vance asked next.</p>

<p>"Nobody, sir. They wouldn't have got in anyway. Burke and
Hennessey and Snitkin are back on the job this morning&mdash;I had
another bunch of fellows here last night guarding the place.
Snitkin is at the east gate, and Burke's here in the vestibule.
Hennessey's down at the pool seeing that nobody approaches from
that direction." Heath looked at Vance with an uneasy, questioning
eye. "What do you want to do first, sir? Maybe you want to
interview Miss Stamm and this young Tatum. There's something wrong
about both of 'em, if you ask me."</p>

<p>"No," drawled Vance. "I don't think we'll chivy the members of
the household just yet. I'd like to meander round the grounds
first. But suppose you ask Mr. Stamm to join us, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Heath hesitated a second; then went into the house. A few
moments later he returned accompanied by Rudolf Stamm.</p>

<p>Stamm was dressed in gray tweed plus fours and a gray silk
sleeveless sport shirt open at the throat. He wore no coat and was
bareheaded. His face was pale and drawn, and there were hollows
under his eyes, but his gait was steady as he came down the steps
toward us.</p>

<p>He greeted us pleasantly and, I thought, a bit diffidently.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry I was so crotchety last night.
Forgive me. I was under the weather&mdash;and unstrung..."</p>

<p>"That's quite all right," Vance assured him. "We understand
perfectly&mdash;a dashed tryin' situation...We're thinking of
looking over the estate a bit, especially down by the pool, and we
thought you'd be good enough to pilot us around."</p>

<p>"Delighted." Stamm led the way down a path on the north side of
the house. "It's a unique place I've got here. Nothing quite like
it in New York&mdash;or in any other city, for that matter."</p>

<p>We followed him past the head of the steps that led down to the
pool, and on toward the rear of the house. We came presently to a
slight embankment at the foot of which ran a narrow concrete
road.</p>

<p>"This is the East Road," Stamm explained. "My father built it
many years ago. It runs down the hill through those trees and joins
one of the old roadways just outside the boundary of the
estate."</p>

<p>"And where does the old roadway lead?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Nowhere in particular. It passes along the Bird Refuge toward
the south end of the Clove, and there it divides. One branch goes
to the Shell Bed and the Indian Cave to the north, and joins the
road which circles the headland and connects with the River Road.
The other branch runs down by the Green Hill and turns into Payson
Avenue north of the Military Ovens. But we rarely use the
road&mdash;it's not in good condition."</p>

<p>We walked down the embankment. To our right, and to the
southeast of the house, stood a large garage, with a cement
turning-space in front of it.</p>

<p>"An inconvenient place for the garage," Stamm remarked. "But it
was the best we could do. If we'd placed it in front of the house
it would have spoiled the vista. However, I extended the cement
road to the front of the house on the south side there."</p>

<p>"And this East Road runs past the pool?" Vance was glancing down
the wooded hill toward the little valley.</p>

<p>"That's right," Stamm nodded, "though the road doesn't go within
fifty yards of it."</p>

<p>"Suppose we waddle down," suggested Vance. "And then we can
return to the house by way of the pool steps&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>Stamm seemed pleased and not a little proud to show us the way.
We walked down the sloping hill, across the short concrete bridge
over the creek which fed the pool, and, circling a little to the
left, got a clear view of the high stone cliff which formed the
north boundary of the pool. A few feet ahead of us was a narrow
cement walk&mdash;perhaps eighteen inches wide&mdash;which led off
at right angles to the road in the direction of the pool.</p>

<p>Stamm turned into the walk, and we followed him. On either side
of us were dense trees and underbrush, and it was not until we had
come to the low opening at the northeast corner of the pool,
between the cliff and the filter, that we were able to take our
bearings accurately. From this point we could look diagonally
across the pool to the Stamm mansion which stood on the top of the
hill opposite.</p>

<p>The water-level of the pool was noticeably lower. In fact, half
of the bottom&mdash;the shallow half nearest the cliff&mdash;was
already exposed, and there remained only a channel of water,
perhaps twenty feet wide, on the opposite side, nearest the house.
And even this water was sinking perceptibly as it ran through the
lock at the bottom of the dam.</p>

<p>The gates above the filter, immediately on our left, were
tightly closed, thus acting as an upper dam and creating a
miniature pond to the east of the pool. Fortunately, at this time
of year the flow of the stream was less abundant than usual, and
there was no danger that the water would reach the top of the gates
or overflow its banks for several hours. Only a negligible amount
of water trickled through the crack between the gates.</p>

<p>As yet the dead man had not come into view, and Heath, scanning
the surface of the pool perplexedly, remarked that Montague must
have met his death in the deep channel on the other side.</p>

<p>Directly ahead of us, within a few feet of the cliff, the apex
of a large conical piece of jagged rock was partly imbedded in the
muddy soil, like a huge inverted stalagmite. Stamm pointed at
it.</p>

<p>"There's that damned rock I told you about," he said. "That's
where you got your splash last night. I've been afraid for weeks it
would fall into the pool. Luckily it didn't hit anybody, although I
warned every one not to get too close to the cliff if they went
swimming...Now I suppose it will have to be dragged out. A mean
job."</p>

<p>His eyes roamed over the pool. Only a narrow channel of water
now remained along the concrete wall on the far side. And there was
still no indication of the dead man.</p>

<p>"I guess Montague must have bumped his head just off the end of
the spring-board," Stamm commented sourly. "Damn shame it had to
happen. People are always getting drowned here. The pool is unlucky
as the devil."</p>

<p>"What devil?" asked Vance, without glancing up. "The
<i>Piasa?"*</i></p>

<p>* In a pamphlet published in Morris, Illinois, in 1887, written
by the Honorable P. A. Armstrong and entitled "The Piasa, or the
Devil Among the Indians," there is an old engraving showing the
<i>Piasa</i> as a monster with a dragon's head, antlers like a
deer, the scales of a great fish, claws, and large wings, and with
a long tail, like that of a sea-serpent, coiled about its body. The
petroglyphs, or pictographs, carved on rock, of this devil-dragon
were first found by Father Marquette in the valley of the
Mississippi about 1665; and his description of the <i>Piasa,</i>
given in Armstrong's pamphlet, reads thus: "They are as large as a
calf, with head and horns like a goat, their eyes are red, beard
like a tiger's, and a face like a man's. Their tails are so long
that they pass over their bodies and between their legs, ending
like a fish's tail."</p>

<p>Stamm shot Vance a quick look and made a disdainful noise which
was half a laugh.</p>

<p>"I see that you, too, have been listening to those crazy yarns.
Good Lord! the old wives will soon have <i>me</i> believing there's
a man-eating dragon in this pool...By the way, where did you get
that term <i>Piasa?</i> The word the Indians round here use for the
dragon is <i>Amangemokdom.</i> I haven't heard the word
<i>Piasa</i> for many years, and then it was used by an old Indian
chief from out West who was visiting here. Quite an impressive old
fellow. And I shall always remember his hair-raising description of
the <i>Piasa."</i></p>

<p><i>"Piasa</i> and <i>Amangemokdom</i> mean practically the same
thing&mdash;a dragon-monster," Vance returned in a low voice, his
eyes still focused on the gradually receding water on the floor of
the pool. "Different dialects, don't y' know. <i>Amangemokdom</i>
was used by the Lenapes,* but the Algonkian Indians along the
Mississippi called their devil-dragon the <i>Piasa."</i></p>

<p>* Lenape is the generic name for the Algonkian tribes in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and vicinity; and it was one of these
tribes that inhabited Inwood.</p>

<p>The water remaining in the channel seemed to be running out more
swiftly now, and Stamm started to walk across the small flat area
of sod at the edge of the pool, in order, I presume, to get a
better view; but Vance caught him quickly by the arm.</p>

<p>"Sorry and all that," he said a bit peremptorily; "but we may
have to go over this patch of ground for footprints..."</p>

<p>Stamm looked at him with questioning surprise, and Vance
added:</p>

<p>"Silly idea, I know. But it occurred to us that Montague might
have swum across the pool to this opening and walked away."</p>

<p>Stamm's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"Why, in God's name, should he do that?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," Vance replied lightly. "He probably
didn't. But if there's no body in the pool it will be most
embarrassin'. And we'll have to account for his disappearance,
don't y' know."</p>

<p>"Tommy-rot!" Stamm seemed thoroughly disgusted. "The body'll be
here all right. You can't make a voodoo mystery out of a simple
drowning."</p>

<p>"By the by," inquired Vance, "what sort of soil is on the bottom
of this pool?"</p>

<p>"Hard and sandy," Stamm said, still rankled by Vance's former
remark. "At one time I thought of putting in a cement bottom, but
decided it wouldn't be any better than what was already there. And
it keeps pretty clean, too. That accumulation of muddy silt you see
is only an inch or so deep. When the water gets out of the pool you
can walk over the whole bottom in a pair of rubbers without soiling
your shoes."</p>

<p>The water in the pool was now but a stream scarcely three feet
wide, and I knew it would be only a matter of minutes before the
entire surface of the basin would be visible. The five of
us&mdash;Vance, Markham, Heath, Stamm and myself&mdash;stood in a
line at the end of the cement walk, looking out intently over the
draining pool. The water at the upper end of the channel had
disappeared, and, as the rest of the constantly narrowing stream
flowed through the lock, the bottom of the channel gradually came
into view.</p>

<p>We watched this receding line as it moved downward toward the
dam, foot by foot. It reached the <i>caba&ntilde;as,</i> and passed
them. It approached the springboard, and I felt a curious tension
in my nerves...It reached the spring-board&mdash;then passed it,
and moved down along the cement wall to the lock. A strange
tingling sensation came over me, and, though I seemed to be held
fascinated, I managed to drag my eyes away from the rapidly
diminishing water and look at the four men beside me.</p>

<p>Stamm's mouth was open, and his eyes were fixed as if in
hypnosis. Markham was frowning in deep perplexity. Heath's face was
set and rigid. Vance was smoking placidly, his eyebrows slightly
raised in a cynical arc; and there was the suggestion of a grim
smile on his ascetic mouth.</p>

<p>I turned my gaze back to the lock in the dam...All the water had
now gone through it...</p>

<p>At that moment there rang out across the hot sultry air, a
hysterical shriek followed by high-pitched gloating laughter. We
all looked up, startled; and there, on the third-floor balcony of
the old mansion, stood the wizened figure of Matilda Stamm, her
arms outstretched and waving toward the pool.</p>

<p>For a moment the significance of this distracting and
blood-chilling interlude escaped me. But then, suddenly, I realized
the meaning of it. From where we stood we could see every square
foot of the empty basin of the pool.</p>

<p>And there was no sign of a body!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII - MYSTERIOUS FOOTPRINTS</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 11.30 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>So extraordinary and unexpected was the result of the draining
of the Dragon Pool, that none of us spoke for several moments.</p>

<p>I glanced at Markham. He was scowling deeply, and I detected in
his expression a look of fear and bafflement, such as one might
have in the presence of things unknown. Heath, as was usual
whenever he was seriously puzzled, was chewing viciously on his
cigar, and staring belligerently. Stamm, whose bulging eyes were
focused on the lock in the dam through which the water had
disappeared, was leaning rigidly forward, as if transfixed by a
startling phenomenon.</p>

<p>Vance seemed the calmest of us all. His eyebrows were slightly
elevated, and there was a mildly cynical expression in his cold
gray eyes. Moreover, his lips held the suggestion of a smile of
satisfaction, although it was evident from the tensity of his
attitude that he had not been entirely prepared for the absence of
Montague's body.</p>

<p>Stamm was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned!" he muttered. "It's incredible&mdash;it's not
possible!" He fumbled nervously in the pocket of his sport shirt
and drew out a small black South American cigarette which he lit
with some difficulty.</p>

<p>Vance shrugged almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"My word!" he murmured. He, too, reached in his pocket for a
cigarette. "Now the search for footprints will be more fascinatin'
than ever, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Heath made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Maybe yes and maybe no...What about that rock that fell in the
pool over there? Maybe our guy's under it."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant. The apex of that piece of rock, as it lies buried
in the pool, is, I should say, barely eighteen inches in diameter.
It couldn't possibly hide a man's body."</p>

<p>Stamm took his black cigarette from his mouth and turned in
Vance's direction.</p>

<p>"You're right about that," he commented. "It's not a
particularly pleasant subject for conversation, but the fact of the
matter is, the bottom of the pool is too hard to have a body driven
into it by a rock." He looked back toward the dam. "We'll have to
find another explanation for Montague's disappearance."</p>

<p>Heath was both annoyed and uneasy.</p>

<p>"All right," he mumbled. Then he turned to Vance. "But there
wasn't any footprints here last night&mdash;at least Snitkin and I
couldn't find 'em."</p>

<p>"Suppose we take another peep," Vance suggested. "And it might
be just as well to hail Snitkin, so that we can go about the task
systematically."</p>

<p>Without a word Heath turned and trotted back down the cement
path toward the roadway. We could hear him whistling to Snitkin who
was on guard at the gate, a hundred feet or so down the East
Road.</p>

<p>Markham moved nervously a few paces back and forth.</p>

<p>"Have you any suggestion, Mr. Stamm," he asked, "as to what
might have become of Montague?"</p>

<p>Stamm, with a perplexed frown, again scrutinized the basin of
the pool. He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," he replied, after a moment, "&mdash;unless,
of course, he deliberately walked out of the pool on this
side."</p>

<p>Vance gave Markham a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>"There's always the dragon as a possibility," he remarked
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Stamm wheeled about. His face was red with anger, and his lips
trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, don't bring that up again!" he pleaded.
"Things are bad enough as they are, without dragging in that
superstitious hocus-pocus. There simply must be a rational
explanation for everything."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure," sighed Vance. "Rationality above all
else."</p>

<p>At this moment I happened to look up at the third-floor balcony
of the house, and I saw Mrs. Schwarz and Doctor Holliday step up to
Mrs. Stamm and lead her gently back into the house.</p>

<p>A few seconds later Heath and Snitkin joined us.</p>

<p>The search for footprints along the level area between us and
the high-water mark of the pool took considerable time. Beginning
close to the filter on the left, Vance, Snitkin and Heath worked
systematically across the level space to the perpendicular edge of
the cliff that formed the north wall of the pool, on our right. The
area was perhaps fifteen feet square. The section lying nearest to
the pool was of encrusted earth, and the strip nearest to where
Markham, Stamm and I were standing, at the end of the cement path,
was covered with short, irregular lawn.</p>

<p>When, at length, Vance turned at the edge of the cliff and
walked back toward us, there was a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>"There's no sign of a footprint," he remarked. "Montague
certainly didn't walk out of the pool at this point."</p>

<p>Heath came up, solemn and troubled.</p>

<p>"I didn't think we'd find anything," he grumbled. "Snitkin and I
made a pretty thorough search last night, with our
flashlights."</p>

<p>Markham was studying the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Is there any way Montague might have crawled up on one of those
ledges and hopped over to the walk here?" he asked of no one in
particular.</p>

<p>Vance shook his head unhappily.</p>

<p>"Montague might have been an athlete, but he was no inyala."</p>

<p>Stamm stood as if in hypnotized reflection.</p>

<p>"If he didn't get out of the pool at this end," he said, "I
don't see how the devil he got out at all."</p>

<p>"But he did get out, don't y' know," Vance returned. "Suppose we
do a bit of pryin' around."</p>

<p>He led the way toward the filter and mounted its broad coping.
We followed him in single file, hardly knowing what to expect. When
he was half-way across the filter he paused and looked down at the
water-line of the pool. It was fully six feet below the coping of
the filter and eight feet below the top of the gates. The filter
was of small galvanized wire mesh, backed by a thin coating of
perforated porous material which looked like very fine cement. It
was obvious that no man could have climbed up the side of the
filter to the coping without the aid of an accomplice.</p>

<p>Vance, satisfied, continued across the filter to the
<i>caba&ntilde;as</i> on the far side of the pool. A cement
retaining wall about four feet above the water-level of the pool
ran from the end of the filter to the dam.</p>

<p>"It's a sure thing Montague didn't climb over this wall," Heath
observed. "Those flood-lights play all along it, and some one would
certainly have seen him."</p>

<p>"Quite right," agreed Stamm. "He didn't escape from the pool on
this side."</p>

<p>We walked down to the dam, and Vance made a complete inspection
of it, testing the strength of the wire mesh over the lock and
making sure there was no other opening. Then he went down to the
stream bed below the dam, where all the water had now flowed off,
and wandered for a while over the jagged, algae-covered rocks.</p>

<p>"There's no use looking for his body down there," Stamm called
to him at length. "There hasn't been enough flow here for the last
month to wash as much as a dead cat over the dam."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," Vance returned abstractedly, climbing back up the
bank to where we stood. "I really wasn't looking for the corpse, d'
ye see. Even if there had been a strong flow over the dam, Montague
wouldn't have been carried over with it. It would take at least
twenty-four hours for his body to come to the surface if he had
been drowned."</p>

<p>"Well, just what were you looking for?" Markham demanded
testily.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, old dear," Vance replied. "Just
sightseein'&mdash;and hopin'...Suppose we return to the other side
of the pool. That little square of ground over there, without any
footprints, is dashed interestin'."</p>

<p>We retraced our steps, along the retaining wall and over the
coping of the filter, to the small tract of low ground beyond.</p>

<p>"What do you expect to find here, Vance?" Markham asked, with a
show of irritation. "This whole section has already been gone over
for footprints."</p>

<p>Vance was serious and reflective.</p>

<p>"And still, don't y' know, there should be footprints here," he
returned with a vague gesture of hopelessness. "The man didn't fly
out of the pool..." Suddenly he paused. His eyes were fixed
dreamily on the small patch of bare grass at our feet, and a moment
later he moved forward several paces and knelt down. After
scrutinizing the earth at this point for a few seconds he rose and
turned back to us.</p>

<p>"I thought that slight indentation might bear closer
inspection," he explained. "But it's only a right-angle impression
which couldn't possibly be a footprint."</p>

<p>Heath snorted.</p>

<p>"I saw that last night. But it don't mean anything, Mr. Vance.
Looks as if somebody set a box or a heavy suit-case there. But that
might have been weeks or months ago. Anyway, it's at least twelve
feet from the edge of the pool. So even if it had been a footprint,
it wouldn't help us any."</p>

<p>Stamm threw his cigarette away and thrust his hands deep in his
pockets. There was a baffled look on his pale face.</p>

<p>"This situation has me dumbfounded," he said; "and to tell you
the truth, gentlemen, I don't like it. It means more scandal for
me, and I've had my share of scandal with this damned swimming
pool."</p>

<p>Vance was looking upward along the cliff before us.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Stamm, would it have been possible, do you think,
for Montague to have scaled those rocks? There are several ledges
visible even from here."</p>

<p>Stamm shook his head with finality.</p>

<p>"No. He couldn't have gone up there on the ledges. They aren't
connected and they're too far apart. I got stranded on one of them
when I was a kid&mdash;couldn't go back and couldn't go
on&mdash;and it took the pater half a day to get me down."</p>

<p>"Could Montague have used a rope?"</p>

<p>"Well...yes. It might have been done that way. He was a good
athlete, and could have gone up hand over hand. But, damn it, I
don't see the point..."</p>

<p>Markham interrupted him.</p>

<p>"There may be something in that, Vance. Going up over the cliff
is about the only way he could have got out of the pool. And you
remember, of course, Leland's telling us how Mrs. McAdam was
staring across the pool toward the cliff after Montague had
disappeared. And later, when she heard about the splash, she was
pretty much upset. Maybe she had some inkling of Montague's
scheme&mdash;whatever it was."</p>

<p>Vance pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"Sounds a bit far-fetched," he observed. "But, after all, the
johnny <i>has</i> disappeared, hasn't he?...Anyway, we can verify
the theory." He turned to Stamm. "How does one get to the top of
the cliff from here?"</p>

<p>"That's easy," Stamm told him. "We can go down to the East Road,
and turn up the slope from the Clove. You see, the cliff is highest
here, and the plateau slopes quickly away through the Clove and the
Indian Life Reservation, till it hits the water-level at Spuyten
Duyvil. Ten minutes' walk 'll get us there&mdash;if you think it
worth while going up."</p>

<p>"It might be well. We could easily see if there are any
footprints along the top of the cliff."</p>

<p>Stamm led the way back to the East Road, and we walked north
toward the gate of the estate. A hundred yards or so beyond the
gate we turned off to the west, along a wide footpath which circled
northward and swung sharply toward the foot of the Clove. Then the
climb up the steep slope to the cliff began. A few minutes later we
were standing on the rocks, looking down into the empty basin of
the pool, which was about a hundred feet below us. The old Stamm
residence, on the hill opposite, was almost level with us.</p>

<p>One topographical feature of the spot that facilitated matters
in looking for footprints was the sheer drop of rocks on either
side of a very narrow plateau of earth; and it was only down this
plateau&mdash;perhaps ten feet across&mdash;that any one, even had
he scaled the cliff from the pool, could have retreated down the
hill to the main road.</p>

<p>But, although a thorough inspection of the surrounding terrain
was made by Vance and Heath and Snitkin, there were no evidences
whatever of any footprints, or disturbances, on the surface of the
earth that would indicate that anybody had been there since the
heavy rains of the night before. Even to my untrained eye this fact
was only too plain.</p>

<p>Markham was disappointed.</p>

<p>"It's obvious," he admitted hopelessly, "that this method of
exit from the pool is eliminated."</p>

<p>"Yes, I fear so." Vance took out a cigarette and lighted it with
studious deliberation. "If Montague left the pool by way of this
cliff he must have flown over."</p>

<p>Stamm swung round, his face pale.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, sir? Are you going back to that silly
story of the dragon?"</p>

<p>Vance raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Really now, my figure of speech bore no such intimation. But I
see what you mean. The <i>Piasa,</i> or <i>Amangemokdom,</i> did
have wings, didn't he?"</p>

<p>Stamm glowered at him, and then gave a grim, mirthless
laugh.</p>

<p>"These dragon stories are getting on my nerves," he apologized.
"I'm fidgety today, anyway."</p>

<p>He fumbled for another cigarette and stepped toward the edge of
the cliff.</p>

<p>"There's that rock I was telling you about." He pointed to a low
boulder just at the apex of the cliff. "It was the top of it that
fell into the pool last night." He inspected the sides of the
boulder for a moment, running his hand under the slight crevasse on
a line with the plateau. "I was afraid it would break off at this
point, where the strata overlap. This is where Leland and I tried
to pry it loose yesterday. We didn't think the top would fall off.
But the rest seems pretty solid now, in spite of the rains."</p>

<p>"Very interestin'." Vance was already making his way down the
slope toward the Clove and the East Road.</p>

<p>When we had reached the narrow cement footpath that led from the
road to the pool, Vance, to my surprise, turned into it again. That
little section of low ground between the filter and the cliff
seemed to fascinate him. He was silent and meditative as he stood
at the end of the walk, looking out again over the empty basin of
the pool.</p>

<p>Just behind us, and a little to the right of the walk, I had
noticed a small stone structure, perhaps ten feet square and barely
five feet high, almost completely covered with English ivy. I had
paid scant attention to it and had forgot its existence altogether
until Vance suddenly addressed Stamm.</p>

<p>"What is that low stone structure yonder that looks like a
vault?"</p>

<p>"Just that," Stamm replied. "It's the old family vault. My
grandfather had the idea he wanted to be buried here on the estate,
so he had it built to house his remains and those of the other
members of the family. But my father refused to be buried in
it&mdash;he preferred cremation and a public mausoleum&mdash;and it
has not been opened during my lifetime. However, my mother insists
that she be placed in it when she dies." Stamm hesitated and looked
troubled. "But I don't know what to do about it. All this property
will some day be taken over by the city&mdash;these old estates
can't go on forever, with conditions what they are today. Not like
Europe, you know."</p>

<p>"The curse of our commercial civilization," murmured Vance. "Is
there any one besides your grandfather buried in the vault?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Stamm seemed uninterested. "My grandmother is in one
of the crypts. And a couple of aunts are there, I believe, and my
grandfather's youngest brother&mdash;they died before I was born.
It's all duly recorded in the family Bible, though I've never taken
the trouble to verify the data. The fact is, I'd probably have to
dynamite the iron door if I wanted to get in. I've never known
where the key to the vault is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your mother knows where the key is," Vance remarked
casually.</p>

<p>Stamm shot him a quick look.</p>

<p>"Funny you should say that. Mother told me years ago she had
hidden the key, so that no one could ever desecrate the vault. She
has queer ideas like that at times, all connected with the
traditions of the family and the superstitions of the
neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Anything to do with the dragon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, damn it!" Stamm clicked his teeth. "Some silly idea that
the dragon guards the spirits of our dead and that she's assisting
him in caring for the dusty remains of the Stamms. You know how
such notions possess the minds of the old." (He spoke with
irritation, but there was an undercurrent of apology in his voice.)
"As for the key, if she ever really did hide it, she's probably
forgotten by now where it is."</p>

<p>Vance nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"It really doesn't matter," he said. "By the by, was the vault
ever mentioned, or discussed, before any of your guests?"</p>

<p>Stamm thought a moment.</p>

<p>"No," he concluded. "I doubt if any of them even knows it's on
the estate. Excepting Leland, of course. You see, the vault's
hidden from the house by the trees here, and no one ever comes over
to this side of the pool."</p>

<p>Vance stood looking up contemplatingly at the old Stamm house;
and while I was conjecturing as to what was going on in his mind he
turned slowly.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know," he said to Stamm, "I could bear to have a
peep at that vault. It sounds rather romantic." He moved off the
path through the trees, and Stamm followed him with an air of
resigned boredom.</p>

<p>"Isn't there a path to the vault?" Vance asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there's one leading up from the East Road, but it's
probably entirely overgrown with weeds."</p>

<p>Vance crossed the ten or twelve feet between the path and the
vault and stood looking at the squat stone structure for several
moments. Its tiled roof was slightly peaked, to allow for drainage,
but the ivy had long since climbed up to the low cornice. The stone
of its walls was the same as that of the Stamm house. On the west
elevation was a nail-studded door of hammered iron which, despite
its rust and appearance of antiquity, still gave forth an
impression of solid impregnability. Leading down to the door were
three stone steps, overgrown with moss. As Stamm explained to us,
the vault had been built partly underground, so that at its highest
point it was only about five feet above the level of the
ground.</p>

<p>Beside the vault, on the side nearest the walk, lay a pile of
heavy boards, warped and weather-stained. Vance, after walking
round the vault and inspecting it, halted beside the pile of
boards.</p>

<p>"What might the lumber be for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just some timber left over from the water-gates above the
filter," Stamm told him.</p>

<p>Vance had already turned away and started back toward the cement
walk.</p>

<p>"Amazin'," he commented when Stamm had come up to him. "It's
difficult to realize that one is actually within the city limits of
Manhattan."</p>

<p>Markham, up to this point, had refrained from any comment,
though it was evident to me that he was annoyed at Vance's apparent
digressions. Now, however, he spoke with an irritation which
reflected his impatience.</p>

<p>"Obviously there's nothing more we can do here, Vance. Even
though there are no footprints, the irresistible inference is that
Montague got out of the pool some way&mdash;which will probably be
explained later, when he's ready to show up...I think we'd better
be getting along."</p>

<p>The very intensity of his tone made me feel that he was arguing
against his inner convictions&mdash;that, indeed, he was far from
satisfied with the turn of events. None the less, there was a
leaven of common sense in his attitude, and I myself could see
little else to do but to follow his suggestion.</p>

<p>Vance, however, hesitated.</p>

<p>"I admit, Markham, that your conclusion is highly rational," he
demurred; "but there's something deuced irrational about Montague's
disappearance. And, if you don't mind, I think I'll nose about the
basin of the pool a bit." Then, turning to Stamm: "How long will
the pool remain empty before the stream above the gates
overflows?"</p>

<p>Stamm went to the filter and looked over into the rising water
above.</p>

<p>"I should say another half-hour or so," he reported. "The pool
has now been empty for a good hour and a half, and two hours is
about the limit. If the gates aren't opened by that time, the
stream overflows its banks and runs all over the lower end of the
estate and down on the property beyond the East Road."</p>

<p>"Half an hour will give me ample time," Vance returned... "I
say, Sergeant, suppose we fetch those boards from the vault and
stretch them out there in the silt. I'd like to snoop at the basin
between this point and the place where Montague went in."</p>

<p>Heath, eager for anything that might lead to some explanation of
the incredible situation that confronted us, beckoned Snitkin with
a jerk of the head, and the two of them hastened off to the vault.
Within ten minutes the boards had been placed end to end, leading
from the low land where we stood to the centre of the pool. This
had been accomplished by laying one board down first, and then
using that as a walk on which to carry the next one which was
placed beyond the first board, and so on, until the boards had all
been used up. These boards, which were a foot wide and two inches
thick, thus formed a dry wooden passage along the floor of the
pool, as the muddy silt was not deep enough at any point to overrun
the timber.</p>

<p>During the operation Markham had stood resignedly, his head
enveloped in a cloud of cigar smoke.</p>

<p>"This is just another waste of time," he complained, as Vance
turned up the cuffs of his trousers and stepped down the first
gently sloping plank. "What, in Heaven's name, do you expect to
find out there? You can see the entire bottom of the pool from
here."</p>

<p>Vance gave him a puckish look over the shoulder.</p>

<p>"To be scrupulously truthful, Markham, I don't expect to find
anything. But this pool fascinates me. I really couldn't endure to
hobble away without visiting the very seat, so to speak, of the
mystery...Come, the Sergeant's bridge is quite dry&mdash;or, as you
lawyers would say in a legal brief, anhydrous."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Markham followed him.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you admit you don't expect to find anything," he
mumbled sarcastically. "For a moment I thought you might be looking
for the dragon himself."</p>

<p>"No," smiled Vance. "The <i>Piasa,</i> according to all the
traditions, was never able to make himself invisible, although some
of the dragons of Oriental mythology were able to change themselves
into beautiful women at will."</p>

<p>Stamm, who was walking just in front of me down the planks,
halted and brushed his hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>"I wish you gentlemen would drop these damnable allusions to a
dragon," he objected, in a tone of mingled anger and fear. "My
nerves won't stand any more of it this morning."</p>

<p>"Sorry," murmured Vance. "Really, y' know, we had no intention
of upsettin' you."</p>

<p>He had now come to the end of the last board, a little beyond
the centre of the pool, and stood looking about him, shading his
eyes with his hand. The rest of us stood in a row beside him. The
sun poured down on us unmercifully, and there was not a breath of
air to relieve the depressing stagnation of the heat. I was looking
past Stamm and Markham at Vance, as his gaze roved over the muddy
basin, and I wondered what strange whim had driven him to so
seemingly futile an escapade. Despite my respect for Vance's
perspicacity and instinctive reasoning, I began to feel very much
as I knew Markham felt; and I went so far as to picture a farcical
termination to the whole adventure...</p>

<p>As I speculated I saw Vance suddenly kneel down on the end of
the plank and lean forward in the direction of the
spring-board.</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt!" I heard him exclaim. "My precious doddering
aunt!"</p>

<p>And then he did an astonishing thing. He stepped off the board
into the muddy silt and, carefully adjusting his monocle, leaned
over to inspect something he had discovered.</p>

<p>"What have you found, Vance?" called Markham impatiently.</p>

<p>Vance held up his hand with a peremptory gesture.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," he returned, with a note of suppressed
excitement. "Don't step out here."</p>

<p>He then walked further away, while we waited in tense silence.
After a moment he turned slowly about, toward the cliffs, and came
back, following a line roughly parallel with the improvised
boardwalk on which we stood. All the time his eyes were fixed on
the basin of the pool, and, instinctively, we kept pace with him
along the boards as he walked nearer and nearer to the small plot
of low ground at the end of the cliff. When he had come within a
few feet of the sloping bank he halted.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," he ordered, "throw the end of that board over
here."</p>

<p>Heath obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>When the board was in place, Vance beckoned to us to step out on
it. We filed along the narrow piece of timber in a state of
anticipatory excitement; there could be no doubt, from the strained
look on Vance's face and the unnatural tone of his voice, that he
had made a startling discovery. But none of us could visualize,
even at that moment, how grisly and uncanny, how apparently removed
from all the sane realities of life, that discovery was to
prove.</p>

<p>Vance leaned over and pointed to a section of the muddy basin of
the pool.</p>

<p>"That's what I've found, Markham! And the tracks lead from
beyond the centre of the pool, near the spring-board, all the way
back to this low embankment. Moreover, they're confused, and they
go in opposite directions. And they circle round in the centre of
the pool."</p>

<p>At first the thing at which Vance pointed was almost
indistinguishable, owing to the general roughness of the silt; but
as we looked down in the direction of his indicating finger, the
horror of it gradually became plain.</p>

<p>There before us, in the shallow mud, was the unmistakable
imprint of what seemed to be a great hoof, fully fourteen inches
long, and corrugated as with scales. And there were other imprints
like it, to the left and to the right, in an irregular line. But
more horrible even that those impressions were numerous
demarcations, alongside the hoof-prints, of what appeared to be the
three-taloned claw of some fabulous monster.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX - A NEW DISCOVERY</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 12.30 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>So appalling and stupefying was the sight of those hideous
hoof-prints, that it was several seconds before the actual
realization of their significance was borne in upon us. Heath and
Snitkin stood like petrified men, their eyes fixed upon them; and
Markham, despite his customary capacity to absorb the unusual,
gazed down in speechless bewilderment, his hands opening and
shutting nervously as if he had received a physical shock and was
unable to control his reflex twitching. My own feeling was one of
horror and unbelief. I strove desperately to throw off the sense of
hideous unreality which was creeping over me and making every nerve
in my body tingle.</p>

<p>But the man most affected was Stamm. I had never seen any one so
near a state of complete collapse from sheer terror. His face,
already pale from the excesses of the night before, turned an ugly
ashen yellow, and his taut body swayed slightly. Then his head
jerked back as if he had been struck by an unseen hand, and he drew
in a long, rasping breath. Blood suddenly suffused his cheeks,
turning them almost crimson; and there was a spasmodic twitching of
the muscles about his mouth and throat. His eyes bulged like those
of a man afflicted with exophthalmic goitre.</p>

<p>It was Vance's cool, unemotional voice that brought us out of
our trance of horror and helped to steady us.</p>

<p>"Really now," he drawled, "these imprints are most fascinatin'.
They have possibilities&mdash;eh, what?...But suppose we return to
dry land. My boots are a beastly mess."</p>

<p>We filed back slowly along the diverted board, and Heath and
Snitkin replaced it as it had been set down originally, so that we
could walk back to the shore without following Vance's example of
stepping off into the mud.</p>

<p>When we were again on the little patch of low ground Stamm
plucked at Vance's sleeve nervously.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;do you make of it?" he stammered. His voice sounded
strangely flat and far-away, like the unmodulated voice of a deaf
man.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;yet," Vance answered carelessly. Then,
addressing- Heath: "Sergeant, I'd like some copies of those
footmarks&mdash;just as a matter of record. The gates will have to
be opened pretty soon, but I think there'll be time enough."</p>

<p>The Sergeant had partly regained his self-control.</p>

<p>"You bet I'll get the drawings." He addressed Snitkin
officiously. "Copy those footprints in your notebook, and measure
'em. And make it snappy. When you're through, get the boards back
out of the pool and pile 'em up. Then have the men open the gates
and close the lock in the dam. Report to me when you're
finished."</p>

<p>Vance smiled at the Sergeant's businesslike seriousness.</p>

<p>"That being capably settled," he said, "I think we'll toddle
along back to the house. There's nothing more we can do here... .
The short route this time, what?"</p>

<p>We proceeded across the coping of the filter toward the
<i>caba&ntilde;as</i> opposite. The water in the stream above the
pool had risen considerably and was within a foot of the top of the
closed gates. As I looked back I saw Snitkin kneeling on two of the
boards, with his notebook spread before him, diligently
transcribing those astounding markings Vance had found on the basin
of the pool. There was no better man in the New York Police
Department for such a task, and I recalled that Snitkin had been
especially chosen by the Sergeant to make the measurements of the
mysterious footprints in the snow outside the old Greene mansion in
East 53rd Street.*</p>

<p>* "The Greene Murder Case" (Scribners, 1927).</p>

<p>As we passed the <i>caba&ntilde;as</i> on our way to the steps
leading up to the house, Vance halted abruptly.</p>

<p>"I say, Sergeant, have you rescued the departed Montague's
garments from his <i>caba&ntilde;a?</i> If not, we might take them
along with us. They may hold secrets...a suicide note, or a
threatening letter from a lady, or some other jolly clue such as
the newspapers adore." Despite his jocular tone I knew that he was
troubled and was reaching out in every direction for some light on
the incredible situation.</p>

<p>Heath grunted assent and began searching through the several
<i>caba&ntilde;as.</i> Presently he emerged with Montague's attire
over one arm; and we proceeded to the house.</p>

<p>As we reached the top of the steps, Doctor Emanuel Doremus, the
Medical Examiner, drove up to the front of the house. Seeing us, he
stepped jauntily across the lawn to where we stood. He was a short,
dapper man, breezy and petulant in manner, who suggested the
stock-broker rather than the shrewd physician that he was. He was
dressed in a pale gray sport suit, and his straw hat was set at a
rakish angle. He greeted us with a familiar wave of the hand,
planted himself with his feet wide apart, thrust his hands in his
pockets, and fixed a baleful eye on the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"A fine time," he complained waspishly, "to drag me out into the
country. Don't you think I ever need any rest&mdash;even on
Sunday?...Well, where's the body? Let's get the business over with,
so I can get back in time for lunch." He teetered a moment on his
toes while Heath cleared his throat and looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>"The fact is, doc,"&mdash;Heath spoke
apologetically&mdash;"there ain't no body..."</p>

<p>Doremus squinted, settled down on his heels, and studied the
Sergeant maliciously.</p>

<p>"What's that!" he snapped. "No corpse?" He pushed his hat
further back on his head and glowered. "Whose clothes are those
you're holding?"</p>

<p>"They belong to the guy that I wanted you to report on," Heath
returned sheepishly. "But we can't find the guy himself."</p>

<p>"Where was he when you phoned me?" Doremus demanded irritably.
"I suppose the corpse said 'too-dle-oo' to you and walked
off...Say, what is this&mdash;a practical joke?"</p>

<p>Markham stepped diplomatically into the breach.</p>

<p>"We're sorry for the trouble we've caused you, doctor. But the
explanation is simple. The Sergeant had every reason to believe
that a man had been drowned, under suspicious circumstances, in the
swimming pool down the hill. But when the pool was drained there
was no body in it, and we're all a bit mystified."</p>

<p>Doctor Doremus nodded curtly in acknowledgment of Markham's
explanation, and turned back to the unhappy Sergeant.</p>

<p>"I don't head the Bureau of Missing Persons," he grumbled. "I
happen to be the Chief Medical Examiner..."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;" Heath began, but the doctor interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"Good Gad!" He glared at the Sergeant in mock astonishment. "You
'thought'! Where did the members of the Homicide Bureau get the
idea that they could think?...Sunday! The day of rest. Hot, too!
And I'm dragged out of my easy chair into this God-forsaken part of
the country, because you had a thought... . I don't want
thoughts&mdash;I want bodies. And when there aren't any bodies I
want to be let alone."</p>

<p>The Sergeant was piqued, but his many experiences with the
peppery Medical Examiner had taught him not to take the other too
seriously; and he finally grinned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"When I have a corpse for you," he retorted, "you complain about
it. Now when I haven't got one and there's nothing for you to do,
you complain anyway...Honest, doc, I'm sorry I got you up here, but
if you'd been in my place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" Doremus fixed a commiserating look on the
Sergeant and shook his head dolefully. "A homicide sleuth without a
corpse!"</p>

<p>Markham was, I thought, a little annoyed at the Medical
Examiner's frivolous manner.</p>

<p>"This is a serious situation, doctor," he said. "The man's body
should logically have been in the pool, and the case is enough to
upset any one's nerves."</p>

<p>Doremus sighed exaggeratedly, and extended his hands, palms
upward.</p>

<p>"But, after all, Mr. Markham, I can't perform an autopsy on a
theory. I'm a doctor&mdash;not a philosopher."</p>

<p>Vance exhaled a long ribbon of smoke.</p>

<p>"You can still have your luncheon on time, don't y' know.
Really, doctor, you should be deuced grateful to the Sergeant for
not detaining you."</p>

<p>"Huh! I suppose you're right, though." Doremus grinned and wiped
his brow with a blue silk handkerchief. "Well, I'll be running
along."</p>

<p>"If we find the body&mdash;" Heath began.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't consider my feelings," the doctor returned. "I don't
care if you never find another body. But, if you do, for Gad's
sake, don't make it at mealtime." He waved a cheery farewell, which
included all of us, and hurried back across the lawn to his
car.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant having been duly chastened for his precipitancy,"
smiled Vance, "suppose we proceed on our way."</p>

<p>Stamm opened the side door for us with his key, and we entered
the dingy hallway that led from the main stairs to the rear of the
house. Even in the daytime, the depressing musty atmosphere of a
bygone age enveloped us, and the sunlight that filtered into the
hall from the main entrance appeared dead and dusty, as if it too
had been vitiated by the stagnation of accumulated decay.</p>

<p>As we approached the library we heard the low murmur of several
voices within, and it was evident that most of the household had
gathered in that room. There was a sudden lull in the conversation,
and Leland came out into the hallway to greet us.</p>

<p>Despite his inherent calm, he appeared drawn and restless. After
the brief greetings, he asked in a voice that struck me as somewhat
strained:</p>

<p>"Have you discovered anything new?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a number of things," Vance answered cheerfully. "But
Montague himself has eluded us in the most amazin' fashion."</p>

<p>Leland shot Vance a swift, quizzical look.</p>

<p>"He was not in the pool?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all," said Vance blandly. "He was entirely absent,
don't y' know. Mystifyin', what?"</p>

<p>Leland frowned, studied Vance a moment, and then glanced quickly
at the rest of us. He started to say something but refrained.</p>

<p>"By the by," Vance continued, "we're going up to Montague's room
for a bit of sartorial inspection. Would you care to limp
along?"</p>

<p>Leland seemed confused for a moment; then he caught sight of the
wearing apparel the Sergeant was carrying.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed. "I had quite forgotten the poor
chap's clothes. I should have brought them to the house last
night...You think they may contain something that will explain his
disappearance?"</p>

<p>Vance shrugged, and proceeded to the front entrance hall.</p>

<p>"One never knows, does one?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Stamm summoned Trainor, who was standing near the main door, and
told him to fetch a pair of slippers for Vance to wear while his
shoes were being cleaned. As soon as the butler had made the
exchange we went up-stairs.</p>

<p>The bedroom that had been assigned to Montague was far down on
the north side of the second-story hallway, directly under, as I
figured it, the bedroom of Mrs. Stamm. It was not as large a room
as hers, but it had a similar window overlooking the Dragon Pool.
The room was comfortably furnished, but it possessed none of the
air of having been lived in, and I surmised that it was used merely
as an overflow guest-chamber.</p>

<p>On a low table by the chest of drawers was a black sealskin
travelling bag, its cover thrown back against the wall. It was
fitted with silver toilet articles, and appeared to contain only
the usual items of male attire. Over the foot of the colonial bed
hung a suit of mauve silk pajamas, and on a chair nearby had been
thrown a purple surah silk dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Heath placed the clothes he had found in the
<i>caba&ntilde;a</i> on the centre-table and began a systematic
search of the pockets.</p>

<p>Vance walked leisurely to the open window and looked out across
the pool. Four men were busily engaged in the operation of opening
the stream gates, and Snitkin, his drawings evidently completed,
was dragging the last board up the bank toward the vault. Vance
stood for several moments gazing out, smoking thoughtfully, his
eyes moving from the filter to the dam and then to the cliff
opposite.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know," he remarked to Stamm, "that fallen piece of
rock should be removed before the water is let in."</p>

<p>Stamm, for some reason, seemed disconcerted by the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be time," he answered. "And, anyway, the water's
shallow at that point. I'll get the rock out in a day or so."</p>

<p>Vance appeared hardly to have heard him and turned back to the
room, walking slowly toward the centre-table where the Sergeant had
made a small heap of the contents of Montague's dinner clothes.</p>

<p>Heath turned one more pocket inside out, and then spread his
hands in Vance's direction.</p>

<p>"That's the total," he said, with patent disappointment. "And
there's nothing here that will tell us anything."</p>

<p>Vance glanced cynically at the various objects on the
table&mdash;a platinum watch and chain, a small pocket-knife, a
gold cigarette-case and lighter, a fountain-pen, several keys, two
handkerchiefs, and a small amount of silver and paper money. Then
he walked to the suit-case and made an inspection of its
contents.</p>

<p>"There's nothing helpful here either, Sergeant," he said at
length.</p>

<p>He glanced about him, examined the top of the dressing-table,
opened the two drawers, looked under the pillows on the bed, and
finally felt in the pockets of the pajamas and the
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Everything's quite conventional and in order," he sighed,
dropping into a chair by the window. "I fear we'll have to look
elsewhere for clues."</p>

<p>Stamm had gone to the clothes-closet and opened the door; and
Leland, as if animated by the spirit of the search, had followed
him. Stamm reached up and turned on the light in the closet.</p>

<p>Leland, looking over the other's shoulder, nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Of course," he murmured, without any great show of enthusiasm.
"His day suit."</p>

<p>Vance rose quickly.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Mr. Leland, I'd quite forgot it...I say,
Sergeant, fetch the johnny's other togs, will you?"</p>

<p>Heath hastened to the closet and brought Montague's sport suit
to the centre-table. An examination of its pockets failed to reveal
anything of importance until a leather wallet was removed from the
inside coat pocket. Within the wallet were three letters, two in
envelopes and one merely folded, without a covering. The two in
envelopes were a circular from a tailor and a request for a
loan.</p>

<p>The letter without an envelope, however, proved to be one of the
most valuable clues in the dragon murder. Vance glanced through it,
with a puzzled expression, and then, without a word, showed it to
the rest of us. It was a brief note, in characteristically feminine
chirography, on pale blue scented note-paper. It was without an
address, but it was dated August 9th (which was Thursday, the day
before the house-party began) and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dearest Monty&mdash;</p>

<p>I will be waiting in a car, just outside the gate on the East
Road, at ten o'clock. Ever thine,</p>

<p>Ellen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stamm was the last to read the note. His face went pale, and his
hand trembled as he gave it back to Vance.</p>

<p>Vance barely glanced at him: he was gazing with a slight frown
at the signature.</p>

<p>"Ellen...Ellen," he mused. "Wasn't that the name, Mr. Stamm, of
the woman who said she wasn't able to join your house-party because
she was sailing for South America?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's it." Stamm's tone was husky. "Ellen Bruett.
And she admitted she knew Montague...I don't get it at all. Why
should she be waiting for him with a car? And even if Montague was
in love with her, why should he join her in such an outlandish
fashion?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me," Leland put in grimly, "that Montague wanted to
disappear in order to join this woman. The man was a moral coward,
and he did not have the courage to come out and tell Bernice he
wanted to break his engagement with her because he was in love with
another woman. Moreover, he was an actor and would concoct just
such a dramatic episode to avoid his obligations. The fellow was
always spectacular in his conduct. Personally, I am not surprised
at the outcome."</p>

<p>Vance regarded him with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Leland, really, don't y' know, there isn't any outcome
just yet..."</p>

<p>"But surely," protested Leland, with mild emphasis, "that note
explains the situation."</p>

<p>"It explains many things," Vance conceded. "But it doesn't
explain how Montague could have emerged from the pool to keep his
rendezvous without leaving the slightest sign of footprints."</p>

<p>Leland studied Vance speculatively, reaching in his pocket for
his pipe.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," he asked, "that there are no footprints
whatever?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are footprints," Vance returned quietly. "But they
couldn't have been made by Montague. Furthermore, they are not on
the plot of ground at the edge of the pool which leads out to the
East Road...The footprints, Mr. Leland, are in the mud on the
bottom of the pool."</p>

<p>"On the bottom of the pool?" Leland drew in a quick breath, and
I noticed that he spilled some of the tobacco as he filled his
pipe. "What kind of footprints are they?"</p>

<p>Vance listlessly shifted his gaze to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"That's difficult to say. They looked rather like marks which
might have been made by some gigantic prehistoric beast."</p>

<p>"<i>The dragon!</i>" The exclamation burst almost explosively
from Leland's lips. Then the man uttered a low nervous laugh and
lighted his pipe with unsteady fingers. "I cannot admit, however,"
he added lamely, "that Montague's disappearance belongs in the
realm of mythology."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it does not," Vance murmured carelessly. "But, after
all, d' ye see, one must account for those amazin' imprints in the
pool."</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen those imprints," Leland returned
dourly. "But I suppose it is too late now." He went to the window
and looked out. "The water is already flowing through the gates.
..."</p>

<p>Just then came the sound of heavy footsteps in the hall, and
Snitkin appeared at the door, with several pieces of paper in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Here are the copies, Sergeant." The detective spoke in a
strained tone: it was evident that our morning's adventure on the
basin of the pool had had a disquieting effect on him. "I've got
the men working on the gates, and the lock in the dam is about
closed. What's the orders now?"</p>

<p>"Go back and boss the job," Heath told him, taking the sketches.
"And when it's done send the boys home and take up your post at the
road gate."</p>

<p>Snitkin saluted and went away without a word.</p>

<p>Vance walked over to Heath and, taking out his monocle, studied
the drawings.</p>

<p>"My word!" he commented admiringly. "They're really clever,
don't y' know. The chap is a natural draughtsman...I say, Mr.
Leland, here are copies of the footprints we found in the
pool."</p>

<p>Leland moved&mdash;somewhat hesitantly, I thought&mdash;to the
Sergeant's side and looked at the drawings. I watched him closely
during his examination of the sketches, but I was unable to detect
the slightest change of expression on his face.</p>

<p>At length he looked up, and his calm eyes slowly turned to
Vance.</p>

<p>"Quite remarkable," he said, and added in a colorless voice: "I
cannot imagine what could have made such peculiar imprints in the
pool."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - THE MISSING MAN</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 1 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>It was now one o'clock. Stamm insisted on ordering lunch for us,
and Trainor served it in the drawing-room. Stamm himself and Leland
ate with the others in the dining-room. We were no sooner alone
than Markham turned a troubled gaze on Vance.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it all?" he asked. "I can't understand
those marks on the bottom of the pool. They're&mdash;they're
frightful."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head despairingly: there could be no doubt that
he too was troubled.</p>

<p>"I don't like it&mdash;I don't at all like it." There was
discouragement in his tone. "There's something dashed sinister
about this case&mdash;something that seems to reach out beyond the
ordin'ry every-day experiences of man."</p>

<p>"If it were not for all this curious dragon lore surrounding the
Stamm estate," said Markham, "we'd probably have dismissed those
large imprints with the simple explanation that the water draining
over the mud had tended to enlarge or distort ordinary
footmarks."</p>

<p>Vance smiled wearily.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so. But we'd have been unscientific. Some of the
footprints were pointed in the direction of the flow of the water,
while others were at right-angles to it; yet their character was
not changed at any point. Moreover, the receding water flowed very
gently, and the shallow mud on the bottom of the pool is rather
tenacious,&mdash;even the scale-like formations on the imprints
were not washed away...But even if one could account reasonably for
the larger impressions, what about those astonishing claw-like
imprints&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Vance leapt to his feet and, going swiftly to the door,
drew one of the porti&egrave;res aside. Before him stood Trainor,
his pudgy face a ghastly white, his eyes staring like those of a
man in a trance. In one hand he held Vance's shoes.</p>

<p>Vance regarded him ironically and said nothing; and the man,
with a quiver that ran over his entire body, made an effort to draw
himself together.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm sorry, sir," he stammered. "I&mdash;I heard you
talking and&mdash;didn't wish to disturb you...so I waited. I have
your boots, sir."</p>

<p>"That's quite all right, Trainor." Vance returned to his chair.
"I was merely curious as to who was hoverin' outside the
porti&egrave;res...Thanks for the boots."</p>

<p>The butler came forward obsequiously, knelt down and, removing
the slippers from Vance's feet, replaced them with the oxfords. His
hands trembled perceptibly as he tied the laces.</p>

<p>When he left the room with the tray of luncheon dishes Heath
glared after him belligerently.</p>

<p>"Now, what was that baby snooping around for?" he snarled.
"There's something on his mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, doubtless." Vance smiled moodily. "I'd say it was the
dragon."</p>

<p>"See here, Vance,"&mdash;Markham spoke with
acerbity&mdash;"let's drop this poppycock about a dragon." There
was a certain desperation in his tone. "How do you account for that
note in Montague's pocket&mdash;and what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"My word, Markham, I'm no Chaldean." Vance leaned back in his
chair and lighted another <i>R&eacute;gie.</i> "Even if the whole
affair was a spectacular plot in which the histrionic Montague was
to make his exit in the approved dramatic manner, I still can't
imagine how he joined his inamorata without leaving some evidence
as to his means of departure from the pool. It's mystifyin' no
end."</p>

<p>"Hell!" The forthright Sergeant cut into the discussion. "The
bird got away somehow, didn't he, Mr. Vance? And if we can't find
the evidence, he out-foxed us."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Sergeant. You're far too modest. I'll admit the
explanation should be simple, but I've a feelin' that it's going to
prove dashed complex."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Markham argued, "that note from the Bruett woman
and Montague's disappearance complement each other perfectly."</p>

<p>"Granted," nodded Vance. "Too perfectly, in fact. But the
imprints in the pool and the absence of any kind of footprints on
the opposite bank, are two conflictin' elements."</p>

<p>He got to his feet and walked the length of the room and
back.</p>

<p>"Then there's the car in which the mysterious lady waited... . I
say, Markham, I think a brief chat with Miss Stamm might prove
illuminatin'...Fetch the quakin' butler, will you, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath went swiftly from the room, and when Trainor came in Vance
requested him to ask Miss Stamm to come to the drawing-room. A few
minutes later she appeared.</p>

<p>Bernice Stamm was not exactly a beautiful girl, but she was
unquestionably attractive, and I was amazed at her air of serenity,
after the reports of her hysterical condition the night before. She
had on a sleeveless white cr&ecirc;pe-de-Chine tennis dress. Her
legs were bare, but she wore orange-colored woollen socks, rolled
at the ankles, and white buckskin sandals. Though not exactly an
athletic type, she gave one the same impression of strength and
vitality as did her brother.</p>

<p>Vance offered her a chair. But she declined it courteously,
saying that she preferred to stand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll have a cigarette," he suggested, proffering her
his case.</p>

<p>She accepted one with a slight bow, and he held his lighter for
her. Her manner seemed strangely detached, as if both her thoughts
and her emotions were far away from her immediate surroundings; and
I remembered the Sergeant's criticism of her to the effect that she
had not seemed as much concerned about the tragedy itself as about
something indirectly connected with it. Perhaps Vance received the
same impression, for his first question was:</p>

<p>"Exactly how do you feel, Miss Stamm, about the tragedy that
took place here last night?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to say," she answered, with apparent
frankness. "Of course, I was tremendously upset. I think we all
were."</p>

<p>Vance studied her searchingly a moment.</p>

<p>"But surely your reaction must have been deeper than that. You
were engaged to Mr. Montague, I understand."</p>

<p>She nodded wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but that was a great mistake. I realize it now...If
it had not been a mistake," she added, "I'm sure I would feel much
more deeply about the tragedy than I do."</p>

<p>"You think this tragedy was accidental?" Vance asked with sudden
bluntness.</p>

<p>"Of course it was!" The girl turned on him with blazing eyes.
"It couldn't have been anything else. I know what you
mean&mdash;I've heard all the silly chatter round this
house&mdash;but it's quite impossible to attribute Monty's death to
anything but an accident."</p>

<p>"You don't put any stock, then, in these tales of a dragon in
the pool?"</p>

<p>She laughed with genuine amusement.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe in fairy-tales. Do you?"</p>

<p>"I still believe in tales of Prince Charming," Vance returned
lightly; "though I've always rather suspected the chap. He was much
too good to be true."</p>

<p>The girl let her eyes rest on Vance calmly for several moments.
Then she said:</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea what you mean."</p>

<p>"It really doesn't matter," he returned. "But it's a bit
disconcertin' not to have found the body of the gentleman who dived
into the pool last night."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;quite. Mr. Montague has disappeared completely."</p>

<p>She gave him a startled look.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;at lunch&mdash;my brother&mdash;he didn't tell
me...You're quite sure that Monty has disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We drained the pool, don't y' know." Vance paused and
regarded the girl mildly. "All we found were some fantastic
footprints."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened and the pupils dilated.</p>

<p>"What kind of footprints?" she asked, in a tense, hushed
voice.</p>

<p>"I've never seen any like them before," Vance returned. "If I
believed in mythical submarine monsters, I might conclude that some
such creature had made them."</p>

<p>Bernice Stamm was standing near the porti&egrave;res, and
involuntarily she reached out and clutched one of them with her
hand, as if to steady herself. But her sudden loss of composure was
only momentary. She forced a smile and, walking further into the
room, leaned against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I am afraid"&mdash;she spoke with obvious effort&mdash;"I'm too
practical to be frightened by any seeming evidences of the dragon's
presence here."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you are, Miss Stamm," Vance replied pleasantly. "And
since you are so practical, perhaps this missive will interest
you." He took from his pocket the blue, scented note that had been
found in Montague's day suit, and handed it to her.</p>

<p>The girl read it without change of expression, but when she gave
it back to Vance I noticed that she sighed deeply, as if the
implication of its contents had brought her peace of mind.</p>

<p>"That note is far more reasonable than the footprints you speak
of," she remarked.</p>

<p>"The note in itself is reasonable enough," Vance admitted. "But
there are correlative factors which make it appear most
unreasonable. For one thing, there's the car in which the
ever-thine Ellen was to have waited. Surely, in the night-time
silence of Inwood, the sound of an automobile could have been heard
at a distance of a few hundred yards."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was!" she exclaimed. "I heard it!" The color
rushed back to her cheeks, and her eyes glistened. "I didn't
realize it until this minute. When Mr. Leland and the others were
in the pool searching for Monty&mdash;ten minutes or so after he
had dived in&mdash;I heard a car starting and the hum of the motor
picking up as when the gears are being shifted&mdash;you know the
sort of noise I mean. <i>And it was down on the East Road...</i>
."</p>

<p>"The car was going away from the estate?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes! It was going away&mdash;toward Spuyten
Duyvil...It all comes back to me now. I was kneeling there, at the
edge of the pool, frightened and dazed. And the sound of this car
drifted in on me, mixed with the sound of splashing in the water.
But I didn't think about the car at the time&mdash;it seemed so
unimportant ...the suspense of those few minutes&mdash;I think you
understand what I am trying to say. I completely forgot such a
trivial thing as the sound of a car, until that note brought it
back to me." The girl spoke with the intensity of unassailable
veracity.</p>

<p>"I understand exactly," Vance assured her consolingly. "And your
remembering the sound of the car has helped us no end."</p>

<p>He had been standing by the centre-table during the interview,
and he now came forward toward the girl and held out his hand in an
attitude of friendly sympathy. With a spontaneous gesture of
gratitude, she put her hand in his; and he led her to the door.</p>

<p>"We sha'n't bother you any more now," he said gently. "But will
you be good enough to ask Mr. Leland to come here?"</p>

<p>She nodded and walked away toward the library.</p>

<p>"Do you think she was telling the truth about hearing an
automobile?" Markham asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, undoubtedly." Vance moved back to the centre-table and
smoked for a moment in silence: there was a puzzled look on his
face. "Curious thing about that girl. I doubt if she thinks
Montague escaped in a car&mdash;but she unquestionably did hear a
car. I wonder...she may be trying to shield some one...A nice gel,
Markham."</p>

<p>"You think perhaps she knows or suspects something?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if she <i>knows</i> anything." Vance turned and sought
a nearby chair. "But, my word! she certainly has suspicions..."</p>

<p>At this moment Leland entered the drawing-room. He was smoking
his pipe, and, though he tried to appear cheerful, his expression
belied his manner.</p>

<p>"Miss Stamm told me you wished to see me," he said, taking his
stand before the fireplace. "I hope you have said nothing to upset
her."</p>

<p>Vance watched him intently for a moment.</p>

<p>"Miss Stamm," he said, "did not seem particularly upset by the
fact that Montague has departed this <i>milieu</i>."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has come to realize&mdash;" Leland began, and then
stopped abruptly, busying himself with repacking his pipe. "Did you
show her the note?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course." Vance kept his eyes on the other.</p>

<p>"That note reminds me of something," Leland went on. "The
automobile, you know. I have been thinking about that ever since I
saw the note, trying to recall my impressions last night, after
Montague had disappeared under the water. And I remember quite
distinctly now that I did hear a motor-car on the East Road when I
came to the surface of the pool, after having looked for the chap.
Naturally, I thought nothing of it at the time&mdash;I was too
intent on the task in hand; that is probably why it went out of my
mind until that note recalled it."</p>

<p>"Miss Stamm also remembers hearing a car," Vance informed him.
"By the by, how long would you say it was, after Montague's
mysterious dive, that you heard the car on the East Road?"</p>

<p>Leland thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps ten minutes," he said finally, but he added: "However,
it is rather difficult to gauge the passage of time in a situation
of that kind."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Vance murmured. "But you are certain it was not
merely two or three minutes?"</p>

<p>"It could not possibly have been as soon as that," Leland
answered with a slight show of emphasis. "You see, we all waited a
couple of minutes for the chap to show up after his dive, and I had
already gone into the water and made a fairly thorough search for
him before I was aware of the sound of the car."</p>

<p>"That being the case," submitted Vance, "it is far from
conclusive to connect the sound of the car with the absent Ellen;
for it would not have taken Montague more than a minute or so to
reach his waiting Juliet at the gate. Certainly he wouldn't have
tarried en route; nor would he have lingered for a loving
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in the parked car."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean." Leland inclined his head and looked
troubled. "Still, he might have decided there was no need for haste
and gotten into some togs before driving off."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Vance admitted carelessly. "There are various
possibilities, don't y' know..."</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by Doctor Holliday and Stamm
descending the stairs. They crossed the hall and came into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you again, gentlemen." The doctor, his
face clouded, addressed us apologetically. "When I first came here
this morning, I found Mrs. Stamm markedly improved, and I expected
she would soon be her normal self again. But when I returned, a
little later, she had relapsed. The events of last night seem to
have upset her strangely, and she is now in a most unusual mood.
She insisted on watching the draining of the pool, and the result
threw her into a state of unprecedented excitement. There is, I
believe, some fixed idea in her mind, which she will not confide to
me or to her son."</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday shifted his position awkwardly and cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to think," he went on, "in view of the fact that
her interview with you last night seemed to relieve somewhat the
tension of this pent-up hallucination, it might be helpful if you
gentlemen would see her again. She may be willing to talk about
this suppressed idea to you. It is worth trying, at any
rate&mdash;if you don't mind. I suggested the interview to her, and
she seemed more than willing&mdash;quite anxious for it, in
fact."</p>

<p>"We would be very glad to see Mrs. Stamm, doctor," Vance
returned. "Shall we go up alone?"</p>

<p>Doctor Holliday hesitated, and then nodded jerkily.</p>

<p>"I think that might be best. It may be that this supposed secret
of hers is being withheld, for some irrational reason, only from
members of the family and those she knows."</p>

<p>We went immediately to Mrs. Stamm's quarters, leaving Doctor
Holliday, with Stamm and Leland, in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Schwarz was waiting for us at the door: evidently the
doctor had told her we were coming. Mrs. Stamm was seated near the
window, her hands folded in her lap. She appeared quite calm, and
there was none of the sardonic tenseness about her that we had
encountered the night before; instead, there was a look of almost
humorous satisfaction on her wizened face.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be back," she greeted us, with a low cackle of
triumph. "I told you that the dragon had killed him. And I told you
that his body would not be found in the pool. But you didn't
believe me. You thought it was the ravings of an old woman's
cracked mind. But now you know that I told you the truth, and so
you've come back to learn more. That's why you're here&mdash;isn't
it? Your foolish science has failed you."</p>

<p>She chuckled, and something in the sound of that hideous nasal
laughter brought back to me the witches' cavern scene in "Macbeth,"
with the dragon's scale that was added to the cauldron.</p>

<p>"I saw you looking for the young man's footprints on the bank
opposite and on the cliffs," she continued, in a gloating tone.
"But the dragon rises to the surface of the water and flies away
with his victims. I've seen him too often!...And I stood here, at
the window, when the water was running out of the pool, and saw you
waiting...waiting, and watching for the thing that was not there.
And then I saw you walk out across the boards, as if you could not
believe your eyes. Didn't I tell you last night that there would be
no body in the pool? Yet you thought that you could find
something." She unfolded her hands and placed them on the arms of
the chair, her fingers flexing and unflexing like great talons.</p>

<p>"But we did find something, Mrs. Stamm," Vance said gently. "We
found strange imprints in the mud."</p>

<p>She smiled at him, like an older person humoring a child.</p>

<p>"I could have told you that too," she said. "They were the
imprints of the dragon's claws. Didn't you recognize them?" (The
matter-of-fact simplicity of this astounding statement sent a chill
up my spine.)</p>

<p>"But where," asked Vance, "did the dragon take the body of this
man he killed?"</p>

<p>A sly look came into the woman's eyes.</p>

<p>"I knew you would ask me that question," she answered, with a
satisfied, tight-lipped smile. "But I shall never tell you! That's
the dragon's secret&mdash;the dragon's and mine!"</p>

<p>"Has the dragon a home other than the pool?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But this is his real home. That's why it is called the
Dragon Pool. Sometimes, though, he flies away to the Hudson and
hides in its waters. At other times he lies beneath the surface of
Spuyten Duyvil. And on cold nights he flies down the valley and
seeks shelter in the Indian caves. But he doesn't put his victims
in any of those places. He has a different hiding-place for them.
It is older than history&mdash;older even than man. It is a cavern
made for him when the world was young..." Her voice trailed out,
and a fanatical look came into her eyes&mdash;a look such as I
imagine shone in the eyes of the old religious martyrs when they
were led to the rack.</p>

<p>"That's all most interestin'," Vance remarked. "But I am afraid
it is not very helpful to us in our present dilemma. You are sure
you could not be persuaded to tell us where the dragon took young
Montague's body?"</p>

<p>"Never!" The woman sat up rigidly in her chair and glared
straight ahead.</p>

<p>Vance regarded her sympathetically for a moment; then terminated
the distressing interview.</p>

<p>When we had again descended to the drawing-room he explained
briefly to Doctor Holliday the result of his conversation, and the
doctor and Stamm took leave of us and went up-stairs.</p>

<p>Vance smoked in moody silence for a while.</p>

<p>"Queer about her prognostications," he mused. "I wonder... ." He
moved restively in his chair, and then, glancing up, questioned
Leland regarding the superstition connected with the dragon's
various abodes.</p>

<p>But Leland, though obviously frank in his answers, was unable to
throw any light on Mrs. Stamm's fanciful remarks.</p>

<p>"The old tales of the dragon," he said, "contained references to
his visits to neighboring waters, such as the Hudson and Spuyten
Duyvil, and even Hell Gate. And I remember hearing, when I was a
child, that he occasionally was seen in the Indian caves. But he
was generally supposed to make his home in the pool here."</p>

<p>"There was one thing Mrs. Stamm said," Vance persisted, "that
struck me as unusually fantastic. In speaking of the place where
the dragon hides his victims she mentioned that it was older than
both history and man, and that it was shaped for him when the world
was young. Have you any idea what she could have meant by
that?"</p>

<p>Leland frowned thoughtfully for a moment. Then his face lighted
up, and he took his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"The pot-holes, of course!" he exclaimed. "Her description fits
them perfectly. The glacial potholes, you know&mdash;there are
several of them at the foot of the rocks near the Clove. They were
fashioned in the ice age&mdash;the result of glacial gyrations, I
believe&mdash;but they are really nothing but small cylindrical
cavities in the rocks..."*</p>

<p>* The glacial pot-holes in Inwood Hill Park were recently
discovered. They are excellent geological specimens of deeply
bored, striated cavities formed in the glacial period by the
grinding action of the lower gravel surface of the massive
continental ice sheet that covered the northeastern part of North
America between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. One of these
sub-glacial holes is about three and a half feet in diameter and
five feet deep. Another is over four feet across; and still another
is eight feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know what pot-holes are," Vance interrupted, with a
note of suppressed excitement. "But I didn't know there were any in
Inwood. How far are they from here?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes' walk, I should say, toward the Clove."</p>

<p>"Near the East Road?"</p>

<p>"Just to the west of it."</p>

<p>"A car would be quicker, then." Vance walked hurriedly into the
hall. "Come, Markham, I think we'll take a bit of a ride... . Will
you be our guide, Mr. Leland?" He was already headed for the front
door. We followed, wondering at this new whim that had suddenly
animated him.</p>

<p>"What wild-goose chase is this, Vance?" Markham protested, as we
went through the vestibule and down the front steps.</p>

<p>"I don't know, old dear," Vance admitted readily. "But I have a
cravin' just now to see those potholes."</p>

<p>He stepped into his car and we climbed in after him, as if led
irresistibly by the tenseness of his decision. A moment later we
were circling the house on the south and turning into the East
Road. At the boundary of the estate Snitkin opened the gate for us;
and we drove rapidly past the Bird Refuge and on toward the
Clove.</p>

<p>We had gone perhaps five hundred yards, when Leland gave the
signal to stop. Vance drew up at the side of the road and stepped
down. We were about fifty feet from the base of a precipitous rocky
ridge which was an extension of the cliff that formed the north
boundary of the Dragon Pool.</p>

<p>"And now for a bit of geological reconnoitring." Though he spoke
lightly, there was, beneath his words, a sombre intentness.</p>

<p>"There are several large glacial pot-holes here," Leland
offered, leading the way toward the cliff. "There's an oak tree
growing in one of them; and one of the others is not as clearly
marked as the rest. But there's one excellent deep-cut example of
glacial activity&mdash;there, just ahead."</p>

<p>We had now come to the foot of the cliff. Before us, as if
chiselled in the steep rock, was a great irregular, oval scar,
perhaps twenty feet long and spreading outward toward the bottom to
a width of about four feet&mdash;it was as if some falling meteor
had dropped perpendicularly and cut its pathway along the rock and
down into the earth. Across the bottom of this upright tunnel was
the projection of the frontal rock, about five feet high, which
formed a sort of wall across the lower section of the pothole,
making of it a miniature well.*</p>

<p>* There is a slab of Arch&aelig;an-age granite with glacial
markings from Vinalhaven, Maine, in front of the American Museum of
Natural History, showing the formation of a glacial pot-hole. The
cylindrical boring in it, however, is much smaller than those in
Inwood.</p>

<p>"That is the most interesting of the pot-holes," Leland
explained. "You can see the three successive borings which
indicate, no doubt, the advance and retreat of the ice during the
long glacial period. The stri&aelig; and polish have been well
preserved, too."</p>

<p>Vance threw away his cigarette and approached it.</p>

<p>Markham was standing behind him.</p>

<p>"What, in the name of Heaven, do you expect to find here,
Vance?" he asked irritably. "Surely, you're not taking Mrs. Stamm's
maunderings seriously."</p>

<p>Vance, by this time, had climbed on the low wall and was looking
over into the depths of the pot-hole.</p>

<p>"It might interest you, nevertheless, to see the interior of
this pot-hole, Markham," he said, without turning his eyes from the
depths beyond.</p>

<p>There was an unwonted note of awe in his voice, and we quickly
came to the edge of the narrow stone wall and looked over into the
ancient rock cavity.</p>

<p>And there we saw the huddled, mangled body of a man in a bathing
suit. On the left side of his head was a great ragged gash; and the
blood that had run down over his shoulder was black and clotted.
The jersey of his suit had been torn down over the chest, and three
long gaping wounds on his body marked the line of the tear. His
feet were drawn up under him in a hideous distorted posture; and
his arms lay limply across his torso, as if detached from his body.
The first impression I got was that he had been dropped into the
pot-hole from a great height.</p>

<p>"That is poor Montague," said Leland simply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI - A SINISTER PROPHECY</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 2.30 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>Despite the horror of the sight that confronted us in the
pot-hole, the discovery of Montague's mangled body did not come
altogether as a shock. Although Markham had shown evidences,
throughout the investigation, of discounting Heath's strong
contentions that there had been foul play, he was, nevertheless,
prepared for the finding of the body. My impression was that he had
battled against the idea as a result of his mental attitude toward
the absence of any logical indications pointing to murder. Vance, I
knew, had harbored grave suspicions of the situation from the very
first; and I myself, in spite of my skepticism, realized, upon my
first glimpse of Montague's body, that there had long been, in the
back of my mind, definite doubts as to the seemingly fortuitous
facts behind Montague's disappearance. The Sergeant, of course,
had, from the beginning, been thoroughly convinced that there was a
sinister background to the superficially commonplace disappearance
of the man.</p>

<p>There was a grim look on Leland's face as he stared down into
the pot-hole, but there was no astonishment in his expression; and
he gave me the impression of having anticipated the result of our
short ride. After identifying the body as that of Montague he slid
down from the wall and stood looking thoughtfully at the cliffs at
the left. His eyes were clouded, and his jaw was set rigidly as he
reached in his pocket for his pipe.</p>

<p>"The dragon theory seems to be working out consistently," he
commented, as if thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," murmured Vance. "Too consistently, I should say.
Fancy finding the johnny here. It's a bit rococo, don't y'
know."</p>

<p>We had stepped away from the wall of the pothole and turned back
toward the parked car.</p>

<p>Markham paused to relight his cigar.</p>

<p>"It's an astonishing situation," he muttered between puffs.
"How, in the name of Heaven, could he have got into that
pot-hole?"</p>

<p>"Anyhow," observed Heath, with a kind of vicious satisfaction,
"we found what we've been looking for, and we've got something that
we can work on...If you don't mind, Mr. Vance, I wish you'd drive
me up to the gate, so as I can get Snitkin on guard down here
before we return to the house."</p>

<p>Vance nodded and climbed into his place behind the wheel. He was
in a peculiarly abstracted frame of mind; and I knew there was
something about the finding of Montague's body that bothered him.
From his manner throughout the investigation I realized that he had
been expecting some definite proof that a crime had been committed.
But I knew now that the present state of affairs did not entirely
square with his preconceived idea of the case.</p>

<p>We drove to the gate and brought Snitkin back to the pot-hole,
where Heath gave him orders to remain on guard and to let no one
approach that side of the cliff from the road. Then we drove back
to the Stamm house. As we got out of the car Vance suggested that
nothing be said for a while regarding the finding of Montague's
body, as there were one or two things he wished to do before
apprising the household of the gruesome discovery we had just
made.</p>

<p>We entered the house by the front door, and Heath strode
immediately to the telephone.</p>

<p>"I've got to get Doc Doremus&mdash;" He checked himself suddenly
and turned toward Markham with a sheepish smile. "Do you mind
calling the doc for me, Chief?" he asked. "I guess he's sort of
sore at me. Anyhow, he'll believe <i>you</i> if you tell him we've
got the body for him now."</p>

<p>"Phone him yourself, Sergeant," Markham returned in an
exasperated tone. He was in a bad frame of mind; but the Sergeant's
hesitancy and appealing look softened him, and he smiled back
good-naturedly. "I'll attend to it," he said. And he went to the
telephone to notify the Medical Examiner of the finding of
Montague's body.</p>

<p>"He's coming right out," he informed us as he replaced the
receiver.</p>

<p>Stamm had evidently heard us come in, for at this moment he came
down the front stairs, accompanied by Doctor Holliday.</p>

<p>"I saw you driving down the East Road a while ago," he said,
when he had reached us. "Have you learned anything new?"</p>

<p>Vance was watching the man closely.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied. "We've unearthed the <i>corpus
delicti.</i> But we wish the fact kept from the other members of
the household, for the time being."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you found Montague's body?" the other stammered.
(Even in the dim light of the hall I could see his face go pale.)
"Where, in God's name, was it?"</p>

<p>"Down the road a bit," Vance returned in a casual voice, taking
out a fresh <i>R&eacute;gie</i> and busying himself with the
lighting of it. "And not a pretty picture, either. The chap had an
ugly wound on his head, and there were three long gashes down the
front of his chest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Three gashes?</i>" Stamm turned vaguely, like a man with
vertigo, and steadied himself against the newel post. "What kind of
gashes? Tell me, man! Tell me what you mean!" he demanded in a
thick voice.</p>

<p>"If I were superstitious," Vance replied, smoking placidly, "I'd
say they might have been made by the talons of a dragon&mdash;same
like those imprints we saw on the bottom of the pool." (He had
dropped into a facetious mood&mdash;for what reason I could not
understand.)</p>

<p>Stamm was speechless for several moments. He swayed back and
forth, glaring at Vance as if at a spectre from which he could not
tear his eyes. Then he drew himself up, and the blood rushed back
into his face.</p>

<p>"What damned poppycock is this?" he burst out in a half-frenzied
tone. "You're trying to upset me." When Vance did not answer, he
shifted his frantic gaze to Leland and thrust out his jaw angrily.
"You're to blame for this nonsense. What have you been up to?
What's the truth about this affair?"</p>

<p>"It is just as Mr. Vance has told you, Rudolf," Leland replied
calmly. "Of course, no dragon made the gashes on poor Montague's
body&mdash;but the gashes are there."</p>

<p>Stamm seemed to quiet down under Leland's cool regard. He gave a
mirthless laugh in an effort to throw off the horror that had taken
possession of him at Vance's description of Montague's wounds.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a drink," he said, and swung quickly down the
hallway toward the library.</p>

<p>Vance had seemed indifferent to Stamm's reaction, and he now
turned to Doctor Holliday.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we might see Mrs. Stamm again for a few moments?"
he asked.</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated; then he nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you might. Your visit to her after lunch seems to
have had a salutary effect. But I might suggest that you do not
remain with her too long."</p>

<p>We went immediately up-stairs, and Leland and the doctor
followed Stamm into the library.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stamm was seated in the same chair in which she had
received us earlier in the day, and though she appeared more
composed than she had been on our previous visit, she none the less
showed considerable surprise at seeing us. She looked up with
slightly raised eyebrows, and there was an ineluctable dignity in
her mien. A subtle and powerful change had come over her.</p>

<p>"We wish to ask you, Mrs. Stamm," Vance began, "if, by any
chance, you heard an automobile on the East Road last night, a
little after ten."</p>

<p>She shook her head vaguely.</p>

<p>"No, I heard nothing. I didn't even hear my son's guests go down
to the pool. I was dozing in my chair after dinner."</p>

<p>Vance walked to the window and looked out. "That's unfortunate,"
he commented; "for the pool can be seen quite plainly from
here&mdash;and the East Road, too."</p>

<p>The woman was silent, but I thought I detected the suggestion of
a faint smile on her old face.</p>

<p>Vance turned back from the window and stood before her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stamm," he said, with earnest significance, "we believe
that we have discovered the place where the dragon hides his
victims."</p>

<p>"If you have, sir," she returned, with a calmness that amazed
me, "then you surely must know a great deal more than when you were
last here."</p>

<p>"That is true," Vance nodded. Then he asked: "Weren't the
glacial pot-holes what you had in mind when you spoke of the
dragon's hiding-place?"</p>

<p>She smiled with enigmatic shrewdness.</p>

<p>"But if, as you say, you have discovered the hiding-place, why
do you ask me about it now?"</p>

<p>"Because," Vance said quietly, "the pot-holes were discovered
only recently&mdash;and, I understand, quite by accident."*</p>

<p>* The fact is that one Patrick Coghlan, a resident of Inwood,
found these pot-holes only a few years ago, on one of his rambling
walks. They have since been cleared by the Dyckman Institute and
made available for public inspection and study.</p>

<p>"But I knew of them when I was a child!" the woman protested.
"There was nothing in this whole countryside that I did not know.
And I know things about it now that none of you will ever know."
She looked up quickly, and a strange apprehensive light came into
her eyes. "Have you found the young man's body?" she asked, with
new animation.</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have found it."</p>

<p>"And weren't the marks of the dragon on it?" There was a gleam
of satisfaction in her eyes.</p>

<p>"There are marks on the body," said Vance. "And it lies in the
large pot-hole at the foot of the cliff, near the Clove."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed and her breath came faster, as if with
suppressed excitement; and a hard, wild look spread over her
face.</p>

<p>"Just as I told you, isn't it!" she exclaimed in a strained,
high-pitched voice. "He was an enemy of our family&mdash;and the
dragon killed him, and took him away and hid him!"</p>

<p>"But after all," Vance commented, "the dragon didn't do a very
good job of hiding him. We found him, don't y' know."</p>

<p>"If you found him," the woman returned, "it was because the
dragon intended you to find him."</p>

<p>Despite her words, a troubled look came into her eyes. Vance
inclined his head and made a slight gesture with his hand, which
was both an acceptance and a dismissal of her words.</p>

<p>"Might I ask, Mrs. Stamm,"&mdash;Vance spoke with casual
interest&mdash;"why it was that the dragon himself was not found in
the pool when it was drained?"</p>

<p>"He flew away this morning at dawn," the woman said. "I saw him
when he rose into the air, silhouetted against the first faint
light in the eastern sky. He always leaves the pool after he has
killed an enemy of the Stamms&mdash;he knows the pool will be
drained."</p>

<p>"Is your dragon in the pool now?"</p>

<p>She shook her head knowingly.</p>

<p>"He comes back only at dusk when there are deep shadows over the
land."</p>

<p>"You think he will return tonight?"</p>

<p>She lifted her head and stared past us inscrutably, a tense,
fanatical look on her face.</p>

<p>"He will come back tonight," she said slowly, in a hollow,
sing-song tone. "His work is not yet completed." (She was like the
rapt priestess of some ancient cult pronouncing a prophecy; and a
shiver ran over me at her words.)</p>

<p>Vance, unimpressed, studied the strange creature before him for
several seconds.</p>

<p>"When will he complete his work?" he asked.</p>

<p>"All in good time," she returned with a cold, cruel smirk; then
added oracularly: "Perhaps tonight."</p>

<p>"Indeed! That's very interestin'." Vance did not take his eyes
from her. "And, by the by, Mrs. Stamm," he went on, "in what way is
the dragon concerned with the family vault across the pool
yonder?"</p>

<p>"The dragon," the woman declared, "is the guardian of our dead
as well as our living."</p>

<p>"Your son tells me that you have the key to the vault, and that
no one else knows where it is."</p>

<p>She smiled cunningly.</p>

<p>"I have hidden it," she said, "so that no one can desecrate the
bodies that lie entombed there."</p>

<p>"But," pursued Vance, "I understand that you wish to be placed
in the vault when you die. How, if you have hidden the key, can
that wish of yours be carried out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have arranged for that. When I die the key will be
found&mdash;but only then."</p>

<p>Vance asked no further questions, but took his leave of this
strange woman. I could not imagine why he had wanted to see her.
Nothing seemed to have been gained by the interview: it struck me
as both pathetic and futile, and I was relieved when we returned
down-stairs and went into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Markham evidently felt as I did, for the first question he put
to Vance, when we were alone, was:</p>

<p>"What was the sense of bothering that poor deluded woman again?
Her babbling about the dragon is certainly not going to help
us."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure, old dear." Vance sank into a chair, stretched
his legs, and looked up to the ceiling. "I have a feelin' that she
may hold the key to the mystery. She is a shrewd woman, despite her
hallucinations about a dragon inhabiting the pool. She knows much
more than she will tell. And, don't forget, her window overlooks
the pool and the East Road. She wasn't in the least upset when I
told her we had found Montague in one of the pot-holes. And I
received a distinct impression from her that, although she has
built up a romantic illusion about the dragon, which has
unquestionably unbalanced her mind, she is carrying the illusion
much further than her own convictions&mdash;as if she wishes to
emphasize the superstition of the dragon. It may be she is
endeavorin', with some ulterior motive, to throw us off the track
and, through a peculiar protective mechanism, to cover up a wholly
rational fact upon which she thinks we may have stumbled."</p>

<p>Markham nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. I got that same impression from her myself
during her fantastic recital of the dragon's habits. But the fact
remains that she seems to harbor a definite belief in the
dragon."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite. And she firmly believes that the dragon lives in the
pool and protects the Stamms from all enemies. But another element
has entered into her projection of the dragon myth&mdash;something
quite human and intimate. I wonder..." Vance's voice trailed off
and, settling deeper in his chair, he smoked meditatively for
several minutes.</p>

<p>Markham moved uneasily.</p>

<p>"Why," he asked, frowning, "did you bring up the subject of the
key to the vault?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest notion," Vance admitted frankly, but
there was a far-away, pensive look on his face. "Maybe it was
because of the proximity of the vault to the low ground, on the
other side of the pool, to which the imprints led." He lifted
himself up and regarded the ash on his cigarette for a moment.
"That mausoleum fascinates me. It's situated at a most strategic
point. It's like the apex of a salient, so to speak."</p>

<p>"What salient?" Markham was annoyed. "From all the evidence, no
one emerged from the pool along that low stretch of ground; and the
body was found far away&mdash;chucked into a pot-hole."</p>

<p>Vance sighed.</p>

<p>"I can't combat your logic, Markham. It's unassailable. The
vault doesn't fit in at all...Only," he added wistfully, "I do wish
it had been built on some other part of the estate. It bothers me
no end. It's situated, d' ye see, almost on a direct line between
the house here and the gate down the East Road. And along that line
is the plot of low ground which is the only means of egress from
the pool."</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense," Markham said hotly. "You'll be
babbling next of relativity and the bending of light rays."</p>

<p>"My dear Markham&mdash;my very dear Markham!" Vance threw away
his cigarette and stood up. "I emerged from the interstellar spaces
long ago. I'm toddling about in a realm of mythology, where the
laws of physics are abrogated and where unearthly monsters hold
sway. I've become quite childlike, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Markham gave Vance a quizzical perturbed look. Whenever Vance
took this frivolous attitude in the midst of a serious discussion,
it meant only one thing: that his mind was operating along a very
definite line of ratiocination&mdash;that he had, in fact, found
some ray of light in the darkness of the situation and was avoiding
the subject until he had penetrated its beams to their source.
Markham realized this, and dropped the matter forthwith.</p>

<p>"Do you," he asked, "wish to pursue the investigation now, or
wait until the Medical Examiner has made his examination of
Montague's body?"</p>

<p>"There are various things I should like to do now," Vance
returned, "I want to ask Leland a question or two. I crave verbal
intercourse with young Tatum. And I'm positively longin' to inspect
Stamm's collection of tropical fish&mdash;oh, principally the fish.
Silly&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>Markham made a wry face and beat a nervous tattoo on the arm of
his chair.</p>

<p>"Which shall it be first?" he asked with ungracious
resignation.</p>

<p>Vance rose and stretched his legs.</p>

<p>"Leland. The man is full of information and pertinent
suggestions."</p>

<p>Heath rose with alacrity and went to fetch him.</p>

<p>Leland looked troubled when he came into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Greeff and Tatum almost came to blows a moment ago," he told
us. "They accused each other of having something to do with
Montague's disappearance. And Tatum intimated strongly that Greeff
had not been sincere in his search for Montague in the pool last
night. I do not know what he was driving at, but Greeff became
livid with anger, and only the combined efforts of Doctor Holliday
and myself prevented him from attacking Tatum."</p>

<p>"That's most revealin'," murmured Vance. "By the by, have Stamm
and Greeff reconciled their differences?"</p>

<p>Leland shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not. There has been bad blood between them all day.
Stamm meant all the things he said to Greeff last night&mdash;he
was just in the frame of mind to let down the barriers of his
emotions and blurt the truth&mdash;or rather, what he believed to
be the truth. I do not pretend to understand the relationship.
Sometimes I feel that Greeff has a hold of some kind on Stamm, and
that Stamm has reason to fear him. However, that is mere
speculation."</p>

<p>Vance walked to the window and looked out into the brilliant
sunlight.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know," he asked, without turning, "what Mrs.
Stamm's sentiments toward Greeff are?"</p>

<p>Leland started slightly and stared speculatively at Vance's
back.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stamm does not like Greeff," he returned. "I heard her
warn Stamm against him less than a month ago."</p>

<p>"You think she regards Greeff as an enemy of the Stamms?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;though the reason for her prejudice is
something I do not understand. She knows a great deal, however,
that the other members of the household little suspect."</p>

<p>Vance slowly turned from the window and walked back to the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"Speaking of Greeff," he said, "how long was he actually in the
pool during the search for Montague?"</p>

<p>Leland seemed taken aback by the question.</p>

<p>"Really, I could not say. I dived in first and Greeff and Tatum
followed suit...It might have been ten minutes&mdash;perhaps
longer."</p>

<p>"Did Greeff keep within sight of every one during the entire
time?"</p>

<p>A startled look came into Leland's face.</p>

<p>"No, he did not," he returned with great seriousness. "He dived
once or twice, as I recall, and then swam across to the shallow
water below the cliffs. I remember his calling to me from the
darkness there, and telling me he had found nothing. Tatum
remembered the episode a while ago&mdash;it was doubtless the basis
for his accusing Greeff of having a hand in Montague's
disappearance." The man paused and then slowly shook his head, as
if throwing off an unpleasant conclusion that had forced itself
upon him. "But I think Tatum is wrong. Greeff is not a good
swimmer, and I imagine he felt safer with his feet on the ground.
It was natural for him to go to the shallow water."</p>

<p>"How long after Greeff called to you did he return to this side
of the pool?"</p>

<p>Leland hesitated.</p>

<p>"I really do not remember. I was frightfully upset, and the
actual chronology of events during that time was confused. I recall
only that when I eventually gave up the search and climbed back on
the retaining wall, Greeff followed shortly afterwards. Tatum, by
the way, was the first out of the water. He had been drinking a
lot, and was not in the best condition. He seemed pretty well
exhausted."</p>

<p>"But Tatum did not swim across the pool?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He and I kept in touch the whole time. I will say this
for him&mdash;little as I like him: he showed considerable courage
and stamina during our search for Montague; and he kept his
head."</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to talking with Tatum. Y' know, I haven't
seen him yet. Your description of him rather prejudiced me against
him, and I was hopin' to avoid him entirely. But now he has added
new zest to the affair...Battling with Greeff, what? Fancy that.
Greeff is certainly no <i>persona grata</i> in this domicile. No
one loves him. Sad...sad..."</p>

<p>Vance sat down again and lighted another cigarette. Leland
watched him curiously but said nothing. Vance looked up after a
while and asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"What do you know of the key to the vault?"</p>

<p>I expected Leland to show some astonishment at this question,
but his stoical expression did not change: he seemed to regard
Vance's query as both commonplace and natural.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of it," he said, "except what Stamm told me. It
was lost years ago, but Mrs. Stamm claims that she has hidden it. I
have not seen it since I was quite a young man."</p>

<p>"Ah! You have seen it, then. And you would know it if you saw it
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the key is quite unmistakable," Leland returned. "The bow
was of curious scroll-work, somewhat Japanese in design. The stem
was very long&mdash;perhaps six inches&mdash;and the bit was shaped
like a large 'S.' In the old days the key was always kept hanging
on a hook over Joshua Stamm's desk in the den...Mrs. Stamm may or
may not know where it is now. But does it really matter?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," Vance murmured. "And I'm most grateful to you
for your help. The Medical Examiner, as you know, is on his way
here, and I'd jolly well like to have a few words with Tatum in the
interim. Would you mind asking him to come here?"</p>

<p>"I am glad to do anything I can to help." Leland bowed and left
the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII - INTERROGATIONS</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 3 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>Kirwin Tatum was a man in his early thirties, slender, wiry and
loose-jointed. His face was thin and skeleton-like, and, as he
stood at the drawing-room door that Sunday afternoon, staring at
us, there was a bloodless, haggard look in his expression, which
may have been the result of fright or of the ravages of his recent
dissipation. But there was a sullen craftiness in his eyes which
was almost vulpine. His blond hair, heavily pomaded, was brushed
straight back from a peaked forehead with sloping parietals. From
one corner of his feral thin-lipped mouth a cigarette drooped. He
was dressed in sport clothes of gay and elaborate design; and a
heavy gold chain bracelet hung loosely on his left wrist. He stood
in the doorway for several minutes, gazing at us shiftily, his long
spatulate fingers moving nervously at his sides. That he was uneasy
and afraid was apparent.</p>

<p>Vance regarded him with critical coldness, as he might have
inspected some specimen in a laboratory. Then he waved his hand
toward a chair beside the table.</p>

<p>"Come in and sit down, Tatum." His tone was at once
condescending and peremptory.</p>

<p>The man moved forward with a shambling gait, and threw himself
into the chair with affected nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked, with a show of spirit,
glancing about the room.</p>

<p>"I understand you play the piano," remarked Vance.</p>

<p>Tatum ceased fidgeting and looked up with smouldering anger.</p>

<p>"Say, what is this&mdash;a game of some kind?"</p>

<p>Vance nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and a dashed serious game. You were a bit unsettled,
we have been told, by the disappearance of your rival, Mr.
Montague."</p>

<p>"Unsettled?" Tatum nervously relighted his cigarette which had
gone out. Vance had thrown him off his guard, and his deliberate
and prolonged pause patently indicated that he was endeavoring to
readjust his equilibrium. "Well, why not? But I haven't been
shedding crocodile tears over Monty, if that's what you mean. He
was a rotter, and it's just as well, for everybody, that he is out
of the way."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will ever return?" asked Vance casually.</p>

<p>Tatum made an unpleasant noise in his throat, which was probably
intended to be a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"No, he won't show up again&mdash;because he can't. You don't
think he planned the disappearance himself, do you? He didn't have
enough sense&mdash;or courage. It meant going out of the limelight;
and Monty couldn't live or breathe unless he was in the
limelight...<i>Somebody got him!"</i></p>

<p>"Who do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it was Greeff?"</p>

<p>Tatum's eyes half closed, and a cold, hard look spread over his
drawn face.</p>

<p>"It might have been Greeff," the man said between his teeth. "He
had ample reason."</p>

<p>"And didn't you yourself have 'ample reason'?" Vance returned
quietly.</p>

<p>"Plenty." A ferocious smile came to Tatum's lips, then faded
immediately away. "But I'm in the clear. You can't pin anything on
me." He leaned forward and fixed Vance with his eyes. "I'd hardly
got into my bathing suit when the fellow jumped from the
spring-board, and I even went into the pool myself and tried to
find him when he failed to come up. I was with the rest of the
party all the time. You can ask them."</p>

<p>"We shall, no doubt," Vance murmured. "But if you are so
immaculately free from suspicion, how can you suggest that Greeff
may have had a hand in Montague's mysterious fading from the scene?
He seems to have followed very much the same course you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes?" Tatum retorted, with cynical scorn. "The hell he
did!..."</p>

<p>"You refer, I take it," said Vance mildly, "to the fact that
Greeff swam to the opposite side of the pool into the shallow
water."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know that, do you?" Tatum looked up shrewdly. "But do
you know what he was doing during the fifteen minutes when no one
could see him?"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"I haven't the groggiest notion...Have you?"</p>

<p>"He might have been doing almost anything," Tatum returned, with
a sly nod.</p>

<p>"Such as draggin' Montague's body out of the pool?"</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"But the only place where he could have emerged from the water
was devoid of any footprints. That fact was checked both last night
and this morning."</p>

<p>Tatum frowned. Then he said, with a certain aggressiveness:</p>

<p>"What of it? Greeff's as shrewd as they come. He may have found
some way to avoid making footprints."</p>

<p>"It sounds a bit vague, don't y' know. But, even if your theory
is correct, what could he have done with the body in so short a
time?"</p>

<p>The ashes of Tatum's cigarette broke and fell on his coat: he
leaned forward and shook them off.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll probably find the body somewhere on the other side
of the pool," he returned, readjusting himself in the chair.</p>

<p>Vance's gaze rested calculatingly on the man for several
minutes.</p>

<p>"Is Greeff the only possibility you have to suggest?" he asked
at length.</p>

<p>"No," Tatum answered, with a one-sided smile, "there are plenty
of possibilities. But the point is to hook them up with the
circumstances. If Leland hadn't been alongside of me the whole time
I was in the pool, I wouldn't give him a clean bill of health for a
split second. And Stamm had plenty of cause to bump Monty off; but
he's out of the running because of all the liquor he'd poured into
himself. And the women here, too&mdash;the McAdam dame and Ruby
Steele&mdash;they'd have welcomed an opportunity of getting rid of
the handsome Monty. But I don't see how they could have managed
it."</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Tatum," Vance remarked, "you're simply bulging
with suspects. How do you happen to have overlooked old Mrs.
Stamm?"</p>

<p>Tatum sucked in his breath, and his face took on the expression
of a death's-head. His long fingers closed over the arms of his
chair.</p>

<p>"She's a devil&mdash;that woman!" he muttered huskily. "They say
she's crazy. But she sees too much&mdash;she knows too much." He
stared straight ahead blankly. "<i>She's capable of anything!</i>"
There was something approaching abject fear in his manner. "I've
seen her only twice; but she haunts this whole house like a ghost.
You can't get away from her."</p>

<p>Vance had been watching Tatum closely, without appearing to do
so.</p>

<p>"Your nerves are a bit on edge, I fear," he commented. Then he
took a deep inhalation on his cigarette and, rising, walked to the
mantelpiece, where he stood almost directly facing the other.
"Incidentally," he said casually, dropping his ash into the
fireplace, "Mrs. Stamm's theory is that a dragon in the pool killed
Montague and hid his body."</p>

<p>Tatum gave a tremulous, cynical laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, I've heard that wild story before. Maybe a dodo
trampled on him&mdash;or a unicorn gored him."</p>

<p>"It might interest you to know, however, that we have found
Montague's body&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tatum started forward.</p>

<p>"Where?" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"In one of the sub-glacial pot-holes down the East Road... And
there were three long claw-marks down his chest, such as this
mythical dragon might have made."</p>

<p>Tatum sprang to his feet. His cigarette fell from his lips, and
he shook his finger hysterically at Vance.</p>

<p>"Don't try to frighten <i>me</i>&mdash;don't try to frighten
<i>me</i>." His voice was high-pitched and shaky. "I know what
you're trying to do&mdash;you're trying to break down my nerves and
get me to admit something. But I won't talk&mdash;do you
understand?&mdash;I won't talk..."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Tatum." Vance spoke mildly but sternly. "Sit down
and calm yourself. I'm telling you the exact truth. And I'm only
endeavorin' to find some solution to Montague's murder. It merely
occurred to me that you might be able to help us."</p>

<p>Tatum, soothed and reassured by Vance's manner, sank back into
his chair and lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Did you," Vance asked next, "notice anything peculiar about
Montague last night before he went to the pool? Did he, for
instance, appear to you like a man who might have been
drugged?"</p>

<p>"He was drugged with liquor, if that's what you mean," Tatum
replied rationally. "Although&mdash;I'll say this for
Monty&mdash;he carried his liquor pretty well. And he hadn't had
any more than the rest of us&mdash;and much less than Stamm, of
course."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a woman named Ellen Bruett?"</p>

<p>Tatum puckered his brow.</p>

<p>"Bruett?...The name sounds familiar...Oh, I know where I've
heard it. Stamm told me, when he asked me to come here, that there
was an Ellen Bruett coming to the party. I imagine I was to be
paired with her. Thank God she didn't come, though." He looked up
shrewdly. "What's she got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"She's an acquaintance of Montague's&mdash;so Stamm told us,"
Vance explained carelessly. Then he asked quickly: "When you were
in the pool, last night, did you hear an automobile on the East
Road?"</p>

<p>Tatum shook his head.</p>

<p>"Maybe I did, but I certainly don't remember it. I was too busy
diving round for Monty."</p>

<p>Vance dismissed the subject and put another query to Tatum.</p>

<p>"After Montague's disappearance, did you feel immediately that
there had been foul play of some kind?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Tatum compressed his lips and nodded ominously. "In fact,
I had a feeling all day yesterday that something was going to
happen. I came pretty near leaving the party in the
afternoon&mdash;I didn't like the set-up."</p>

<p>"Can you explain what gave you that impression of impending
disaster?"</p>

<p>Tatum thought a moment, and his eyes shifted back and forth.</p>

<p>"No, I can't say," he muttered at length. "A little of
everything, perhaps. But especially that crazy woman
up-stairs..."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"She'd give any one the heebie-jeebies. Stamm makes a habit, you
know, of taking his guests to see her for a few moments when they
arrive&mdash;to pay their respects, or something of the kind. And I
remember when I got here, Friday afternoon, Teeny McAdam and Greeff
and Monty were already upstairs with her. She seemed pleasant
enough&mdash;smiled at all of us and bid us welcome&mdash;but there
was a queer look in her eyes as she studied each one of us
individually&mdash;something calculating and ill-omened, if you
know what I'm trying to get at. I had the feeling that she was
making up her mind which one of us she disliked the most. Her eyes
rested a long time on Monty&mdash;and I was glad she didn't look at
me the same way. When she dismissed us she said, 'Have a good
time'&mdash;but she was like a cobra grinning at her victims. It
took three shots of whisky to bring me back to normal."</p>

<p>"Did the others feel the same way about it?"</p>

<p>"They didn't say much, but I know they didn't like it. And of
course the whole party here has been one continual round of
back-biting and underhand animosity."</p>

<p>Vance rose and waved his hand toward the door.</p>

<p>"You may go now, Tatum. But I warn you, we want nothing said yet
about the finding of Montague's body. And you're to stay indoors
with the rest, until further orders from the District
Attorney."</p>

<p>Tatum started to say something, checked himself, and then went
out.</p>

<p>When the man had gone Vance moved back and forth between the
fireplace and the door several times, smoking, his head down.
Slowly he looked up at Markham.</p>

<p>"A shrewd, unscrupulous lad, that...Not a nice person&mdash;not
at all a nice person. And as ruthless as a rattlesnake. Moreover,
he knows&mdash;or, at least, he seriously suspects&mdash;something
connected with Montague's death. You recall that, even before he
knew we had found the body, he was quite sure it would be
discovered somewhere on the other side of the pool. That wasn't
altogether guesswork on his part&mdash;his tone was far too casual
and assured. And he was pretty certain regarding the time Greeff
spent in the shallow water. Of course, he ridiculed the dragon
idea&mdash;and did it cleverly...His comments on Mrs. Stamm were
rather interestin', too. He thinks she knows and sees too
much&mdash;but, after all, why should he care? Unless, of course,
he has something to hide...And he told us he didn't hear any car
last night, though others heard it... ."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." Markham made a vague gesture with his hand, as if to
dismiss Vance's speculations. "Everything here seems contradictory.
But what I'd like to know is: was it possible for Greeff to have
manipulated the whole thing from his position at the shallow side
of the pool?"</p>

<p>"The answer to that question," returned Vance, "seems to lie in
the solution of the problem of how Montague got out of the pool and
into the pot-hole...Anyway, I think it would be a bully idea, while
we're waiting for Doremus, to have another brief parley with
Greeff.&mdash;Will you please fetch him, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Greeff entered the drawing-room a few minutes later, dressed in
a conventional light-weight business suit, and wearing a small
gardenia in his buttonhole. Despite his rugged healthy complexion,
he showed unmistakable signs of strain, and I imagined that he had
done considerable drinking since we had interviewed him the night
before. Much of his aggressiveness was gone, and his fingers shook
slightly as he moved his long cigarette holder to and from his
lips.</p>

<p>Vance greeted him perfunctorily and asked him to sit down. When
Greeff had chosen a chair, Vance said:</p>

<p>"Both Mr. Leland and Mr. Tatum have told us that when you were
in the pool, helping them search for Montague, you swam immediately
across to the shallow water below the cliffs."</p>

<p>"Not immediately." There was the suggestion of indignant
protestation in Greeff's voice. "I made several efforts to find the
chap. But, as I've already told you, I am not a good swimmer, and
it occurred to me that perhaps his body had drifted across the
pool, since he had dived in that direction; and I thought I might
be of more help by looking about over there than by interfering
with Leland and Tatum with my clumsy splashing about." He shot a
quick look at Vance. "Was there any reason why I shouldn't have
done it?"</p>

<p>"No-o," Vance drawled. "We were just interested in checkin' the
whereabouts of the various members of the party during that
particular period."</p>

<p>Greeff squinted, and the color deepened on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Then what's the point of the question?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Merely an attempt to clarify one or two dubious items," Vance
returned lightly, and then went on, before the other could speak
again: "By the by, when you were in the shallow water at the other
side of the pool, did you, by any chance, hear a motor-car along
the East Road?"</p>

<p>Greeff stared at Vance for several moments in startled silence.
The color left his face, and he rose to his feet with jerky
ponderance.</p>

<p>"Yes, by Gad! I did hear one." He stood with hunched shoulders,
emphasizing his words with his long cigarette holder which he held
in his right hand, like a conductor's baton. "And I thought at the
time it was damned queer. But I forgot all about it last night, and
didn't think of it again until you mentioned it just now."</p>

<p>"It was about ten minutes after Montague had dived in, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Just about."</p>

<p>"Both Mr. Leland and Miss Stamm heard it," Vance remarked. "But
they were a trifle vague about it."</p>

<p>"I heard it, all right," Greeff muttered. "And I wondered whose
car it was."</p>

<p>"I'd jolly well like to know that myself." Vance contemplated
the tip of his cigarette. "Could you tell which way the car was
going?"</p>

<p>"Toward Spuyten Duyvil," Greeff answered, without hesitation.
"And it started somewhere to the east of the pool. When I got over
into the shallow water everything was quiet&mdash;too damned quiet
to suit me. I didn't like it. I called to Leland, and then made
some further efforts to see if Montague's body had drifted over to
the shoal at that side of the pool. But it was no go. And as I
stood there, with my head and shoulders above the surface of the
water, on the point of swimming back, I distinctly heard some one
starting the motor of a car&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if the car had been parked in the road?" interrupted
Vance.</p>

<p>"Exactly...And then I heard the gears being shifted; and the car
went on down the East Road&mdash;and I swam back across the pool,
wondering who was leaving the estate."</p>

<p>"According to a billet-doux we found in one of Montague's coats,
a lady was waiting for him in a car, down near the east gate, at
ten o'clock last night."</p>

<p>"So?" Greeff gave an unpleasant laugh. "So that's the way the
wind blows, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not altogether. There was some miscalculation
somewhere, I opine...The fact is, d' ye see," Vance added, with
slow emphasis, "we found Montague's body just beyond the
Clove&mdash;in one of the pot-holes."</p>

<p>Greeff's mouth sagged open, and his eyes contracted into small,
shining discs.</p>

<p>"You found him, eh?" he iterated. "How did he die?"</p>

<p>"We don't know yet. The Medical Examiner is on his way up here
now. But he wasn't a pleasant sight&mdash;a bad gash on the head
and great claw-like scratches down his chest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;wait a minute!" There was a tense huskiness
in Greeff's demand. "Were there three scratches close
together?"</p>

<p>Vance nodded, scarcely looking at the man.</p>

<p>"Exactly three&mdash;and they were a uniform distance
apart."</p>

<p>Greeff staggered backward toward his chair and fell into it
heavily.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God&mdash;oh, my God!" he muttered. After a moment he
moved his thick fingers over his chin and looked up abruptly,
fixing his eyes on Vance in furtive inquiry. "Have you told
Stamm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Vance replied abstractedly. "We gave him the glad
tidings as soon as we returned to the house, less than an hour
ago." Vance appeared to reflect; then he put another question to
Greeff. "Did you ever accompany Stamm on any of his treasure hunts
or fishing expeditions in the tropics?"</p>

<p>Obviously Greeff was profoundly puzzled by this change of
subject.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," he spluttered. "Never had anything to do with
such silly business&mdash;except that I helped Stamm finance and
equip a couple of his expeditions. That is," he amended, "I got
some of my clients to put up the money. But Stamm paid it all back
after the expeditions had fizzled..."</p>

<p>Vance arrested the other's explanations with a gesture.</p>

<p>"You're not interested in tropical fish yourself, I take
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm not interested in
them," Greeff returned in a matter-of-fact voice; but his eyes were
still narrowed, like those of a man deeply perplexed. "They're nice
to look at&mdash;grand colors and all that..."</p>

<p>"Any Dragonfish in Stamm's collection?"</p>

<p>Greeff sat up again, his face paling.</p>

<p>"My God! You don't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Purely an academic question," Vance interrupted, with a wave of
the hand.</p>

<p>Greeff made a throaty noise.</p>

<p>"Yes, by Gad!" he declared. "There are some Dragonfish here. But
they're not alive. Stamm has two of them preserved some way.
Anyway, they're only about twelve inches long&mdash;though they're
vicious-looking devils. He has some long name for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Chauliodus sloanei?</i>"</p>

<p>"Something like that...And he's also got some Sea-horses and a
coral-red Sea-dragon...But see here, Mr. Vance, what have these
fish got to do with the case?"</p>

<p>Vance sighed before answering.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. But I'm dashed interested in Stamm's
collection of tropical fish."</p>

<p>At this moment Stamm himself and Doctor Holliday crossed the
hall to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I'm going, gentlemen," Doctor Holliday announced quietly. "If
you want me for anything, Mr. Stamm knows where to reach me."
Without further ado he went toward the front door, and we heard him
go out and drive away in his little coup&eacute;.</p>

<p>Stamm stood for several moments, glowering at Greeff.</p>

<p>"Adding more fuel to the fire?" he asked, with an almost vicious
sarcasm.</p>

<p>Greeff shrugged hopelessly and extended his hands in a futile
gesture, as if unable to cope with the other's unreasonable
attitude.</p>

<p>It was Vance who answered Stamm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Greeff and I have just been discussing your fish."</p>

<p>Stamm looked skeptically from one to the other of them, then
turned on his heel and went from the room. Vance permitted Greeff
to go also.</p>

<p>He had no sooner passed the porti&egrave;res than there came the
sound of a car on the front drive; and a few moments later
Detective Burke, who had been stationed at the front door, ushered
in the Medical Examiner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII - THREE WOMEN</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 3.30 p. m</i>.)</p>

<p>Doctor Doremus looked us over satirically, then fixed his gaze
on Sergeant Heath.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, with a commiserating shake of the head.
"So the corpse has returned. Suppose we have a look at it before it
eludes you again."</p>

<p>"It's down the East Road a bit." Vance rose from his chair and
went toward the door. "We'd better drive."</p>

<p>We went out of the house and, picking up Detective Burke, got
into Vance's car. Doremus trailed us in his own car. We swung round
to the south of the house and turned down the East Road. When we
were opposite the pot-holes, where Snitkin was waiting, Vance drew
up and we got out.</p>

<p>Vance led the way to the cliff and pointed to the rock wall of
the pot-hole in which Montague's body lay.</p>

<p>"The chap's in there," he said to Doremus. "He hasn't been
touched."</p>

<p>Doremus made a grimace of annoyed boredom.</p>

<p>"A ladder would have helped," he grumbled, as he climbed up to
the low parapet and seated himself on its rounded top. After
leaning over and inspecting the huddled body cursorily, he turned
back to us with a wry face and mopped his brow.</p>

<p>"He certainly looks dead. What killed him?"</p>

<p>"That's what we're hoping you can tell us," answered Heath.</p>

<p>Doremus slid down from the wall. "All right. Get him out of
there and put him down on the ground."</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter to move Montague's body from the
pot-hole, as <i>rigor mortis</i> had set in, and it required
several minutes for Heath and Snitkin and Burke to accomplish the
task. Doremus knelt down and, after straightening out the dead
man's distorted limbs, began to make an examination of the wound in
his head and the gashes down the breast. After a while he looked up
and, pushing his hat back, shook his head in obvious
uncertainty.</p>

<p>"This is a queer one," he announced. "The man's been struck on
the head with a blunt instrument of some kind, which has ripped his
scalp open and given him a linear fracture of the skull. It could
easily have been the cause of death. But, on the other hand, he's
been strangled&mdash;look at the ecchymosis on either side of the
thyroid cartilage. Only, I'd swear those discolorations are not the
marks of a human hand, or even of a rope or cord. And look at those
bulging eyes, and the thick black lips and tongue."</p>

<p>"Could he have been drowned?" asked Heath.</p>

<p>"Drowned?" Doremus cocked a pitying eye at the Sergeant. "I've
just finished telling you he was bashed over the head and also
strangled. If he couldn't get air in his lungs, how could he get
water in 'em?"</p>

<p>"What the Sergeant means, doctor," put in Markham, "is whether
it's possible that the man was drowned before he was
mutilated."</p>

<p>"No." Doremus was emphatic. "In that case he wouldn't show the
same type of wound. There wouldn't have been the hemorrhage in the
surrounding tissues; and the contusions on the throat would be
superficial and circumscribed and not of such a deep color."</p>

<p>"What about those marks on his chest?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>The doctor pursed his lips and looked puzzled. Before replying
he studied the three gashes again, and then rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"They're nasty wounds," he said. "But the lacerations are not
very serious. They laid open the pectoralis major and minor muscles
without penetrating the chest walls. And they were made before he
died: you can tell that by the condition of the blood on them."</p>

<p>"He certainly had rough handling." Heath spoke like a man caught
in a wave of wonder.</p>

<p>"And that's not all," Doremus went on. "He has some broken
bones. The left leg is bent on itself below the knee, showing a
fracture of both the tibia and the fibula. The right humerus is
broken, too. And from the depressed look of the right side of his
chest, I'd say a couple of the lower ribs are smashed."</p>

<p>"That might be the result of his having been thrown into the
pot-hole," Vance suggested.</p>

<p>"Possibly," agreed Doremus. "But there are also dull open
abrasions&mdash;made after death&mdash;on the posterior surfaces of
both heels, as if he'd been dragged over a rough surface."</p>

<p>Vance took a long, deliberate inhalation on his cigarette.</p>

<p>"That's most interestin'," he murmured, his eyes fixed
meditatively ahead of him.</p>

<p>Markham shot him a quick glance.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Nothing cryptic," Vance returned mildly. "But the doctor's
comment opens up a new possibility, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Heath was staring raptly at Montague's body, and I detected
something of both awe and fright in his attitude.</p>

<p>"What do you think made those scratches on his chest, doc?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" snapped Doremus. "Haven't I already told
you I'm a doctor and not a detective? They might have been made by
any kind of a sharp instrument."</p>

<p>Vance turned with a smile.</p>

<p>"It's very distressin', doctor, but I can explain the Sergeant's
uneasiness. There's a theory hereabouts that this johnny was killed
by a dragon that lives in the pool."</p>

<p>"A dragon!" Doremus was bewildered for a moment; then he looked
at Heath, and laughed derisively. "And I suppose the Sergeant is
figuring out just how the naughty dragon scratched him with his
claws&mdash;is that it?" He shook his head and chuckled. "Well,
well! That's one way of solving a murder:&mdash;<i>cherchez le
dragon.</i> Good Gad, what's the world coming to!"</p>

<p>Heath was piqued.</p>

<p>"If you'd been up against what I have the last coupla days,
doc," he growled, "you'd believe anything, too."</p>

<p>Doremus lifted his eyebrows ironically.</p>

<p>"Have you thought of leprechawns?" he asked. "Maybe they did the
fellow in. Or the satyrs may have butted him to death. Or the
gnomes may have got him. Or perhaps the fairies tickled him to
death with pussy-willows." He snorted. "A sweet-looking medical
report it'd be if I put down death due to dragon scratches...
."</p>

<p>"And yet, doctor," said Vance with unwonted seriousness, "a sort
of dragon did kill the chap, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Doremus raised his hands and let them fall in a hopeless
gesture.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way. But, as a poor benighted medico, my guess
is this guy was first hit over the head and ripped open down the
front; then he was strangled, dragged to this rock hole, and dumped
into it. If the autopsy shows anything different, I'll let you
know."</p>

<p>He took out a pencil and a pad of blanks, and wrote for a
moment. When he had finished he tore off the top sheet and handed
it to Heath.</p>

<p>"Here's your order for removal, Sergeant. But there's going to
be no <i>post mortem</i> till tomorrow. It's too blooming hot. You
can play Saint George and go dragon hunting till then."</p>

<p>"That's precisely what we're going to do," Vance smiled.</p>

<p>"Just as a matter of record&mdash;" began Heath; but the doctor
interrupted him with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"I know, I know!&mdash;'How long has he been dead?'...When I die
and go to hell, along with the rest of the medical fraternity,
that's the query that'll be eternally drummed into my ears...All
right, Sergeant: he's been dead over twelve hours and less than
twenty-four. Satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"We have reason to believe, doctor," said Markham, "that the man
was killed around ten o'clock last night."</p>

<p>Doremus looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"That would make eighteen hours. Just about right, I'd say." He
turned and walked toward his car. "And now I'm on my way&mdash;back
to a mint julep and an easy chair. Gad, what a day! I'll be having
a sunstroke and a brain-storm, like the rest of you, if I don't
hurry back to town." He got into his car. "But I'm going home by
way of Spuyten Duyvil and Payson Avenue. Taking no chances on going
back past the pool." He leered at Heath. "I'm afraid of running
into that dragon!" And, with a cheerful wave of the hand, he shot
down the East Road.</p>

<p>Heath ordered Snitkin and Burke to remain with Montague's body
until it was called for, and the rest of us returned to the Stamm
residence, where Heath telephoned to the Department of Public
Welfare to send a wagon to the pot-holes.</p>

<p>"And where are we now?" asked Markham hopelessly, when we were
again seated in the drawing-room. "Every discovery seems to throw
this case deeper into the realm of impenetrable mystery. There's
apparently no line of investigation that leads anywhere except into
a blank wall."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that," Vance replied cheerfully. "Really, y'
know, I thought things were shaping up rather well. Doremus gave us
many revealin' items. The technique of the murder was
unique,&mdash;the very brutality and insanity of it holds amazin'
possibilities. Y' know, Markham, I've an idea we weren't expected
to find the body. Otherwise, why should it have been so carefully
hidden? The murderer wanted us to think Montague merely chose to
disappear from his present haunts."</p>

<p>Heath nodded ponderously.</p>

<p>"I get what you mean, Mr. Vance. That note in Montague's
clothes, for instance. My idea is that this dame who wrote the note
had an accomplice in the car at the gate, who did the dirty work
and threw the bird in that pot-hole..."</p>

<p>"That won't do, Sergeant," Vance interrupted in a kindly but
firm voice. "Were that the case, we'd have found Montague's
footprints leading out of the pool."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't we find them?" demanded Markham with
exasperation. "Montague's body was found down the East Road. He
must have got out of the pool some way."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; he got out some way." Vance frowned at his cigarette:
something was troubling him deeply. "That's the devilish part of
it...Somehow I think, Markham, that Montague didn't leave any
footprints <i>because he wasn't able to.</i> He may not have wanted
to escape from the pool&mdash;he may have been carried out..."</p>

<p>"My God!" Markham rose nervously and took a deep breath. "You're
not reverting to that hideous flying-dragon theory, are you?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" Vance spoke in soothing reprimand. "At least
not the kind of dragon you imagine. I was merely intimatin' that
the hapless Montague was killed in the pool and carried to the
pothole."</p>

<p>"But that theory," protested Markham, "only involves us in
deeper complications."</p>

<p>"I'm aware of that fact," sighed Vance. "But, after all, the
chappie <i>did</i> travel, in some manner, from the pool to the
pot-hole. And it's obvious he didn't go voluntarily."</p>

<p>"What about the car that was heard on the East Road?" The
practical Sergeant projected himself again into the discussion.</p>

<p>"Quite." Vance nodded. "That car puzzles me no end. It may have
been Montague's means of transportation. But, dash it all! how did
he get from the pool to the car? And why was he mutilated in such
shockin' fashion?"</p>

<p>He smoked a while in silence, and then turned to Markham.</p>

<p>"Y' know, there are several persons here who have not yet heard
of the finding of Montague's body&mdash;Ruby Steele, and Mrs.
McAdam, and Bernice Stamm. I think the time has come to inform
them. Their reactions may be helpful..."</p>

<p>The three women were sent for, and when they had joined us Vance
told them briefly of the circumstances surrounding the discovery
and examination of the dead man. He spoke in a matter-of-fact
manner, but I noticed he was watching his listeners closely. (At
the time I could not understand his reason for the procedure, but
it was not long before I realized why he had chosen this means of
apprising the various members of the household of our gruesome find
in the pot-hole.)</p>

<p>The three women listened intently; and there was a short silence
following the conclusion of his information. Then Ruby Steele said,
in a low, sententious voice:</p>

<p>"It really bears out what I told you last night. The fact that
there were no footprints leading from the pool means nothing. A man
like this half-breed, Leland&mdash;with all his hidden
powers&mdash;could accomplish seeming miracles. And he was the last
person to return to the house here!"</p>

<p>I expected Bernice Stamm to resent these remarks, but she merely
smiled musingly and said with troubled dignity:</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised that poor Monty has been found; but I doubt
if miracles are needed to explain his death..." Then the pupils of
her eyes dilated, and her breast rose and fell with accelerated
respiration. "But," she went on, "I don't understand the marks on
Monty's chest."</p>

<p>"Do you understand the other features of the case, Miss Stamm?"
Vance asked quietly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" Her voice became almost hysterical. "I don't
understand any of it." Tears came into her eyes, and she was unable
to continue.</p>

<p>"Don't let it worry you," Vance consoled her. "You're
frightfully wrought up, don't y' know."</p>

<p>"May I go now?" she asked pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Of course." Vance rose and escorted her to the door.</p>

<p>When he returned to his chair Teeny McAdam spoke. She had been
smoking with tense abstractedness for some time; I doubt if she had
even heard any of Bernice Stamm's remarks. Suddenly she wheeled
toward Vance, her features contracted and set.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she began, with peremptory desperation. "I'm sick of
this whole miserable affair. Monty's dead and you've found his
body&mdash;and I've got something to tell you. Alex Greeff hated
Monty. And he said to Monty Friday night&mdash;I heard
him&mdash;'You're not going to marry Bernice if I can help it.'
Monty laughed at him and retorted: 'What are you going to do about
it?' Mr. Greeff said: 'Plenty&mdash;<i>if the dragon doesn't get
you first.</i>' Then Monty called him a foul name and went up to
bed..."</p>

<p>"What do you think Mr. Greeff was referring to when he mentioned
the dragon?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But later that night it occurred to me he might
have been referring to Mr. Leland."</p>

<p>"Was it because of these remarks you screamed when Montague
failed to come up after his dive?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I'd been worrying all day yesterday. And when Mr. Greeff
jumped into the pool and made a pretense of looking for Monty I
kept my eyes on him. But he immediately swam out of sight toward
the cliffs on the other side&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you kept your eyes strained in that direction?"</p>

<p>Mrs. McAdam nodded jerkily.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what he was up to&mdash;and I didn't trust him...
. Later, when he came back he whispered to me: 'Montague's
gone&mdash;and good riddance.' Even then I couldn't see how he'd
accomplished the thing. But now that you've found Monty's body in
the pot-hole, I had to tell you what I know."</p>

<p>Vance nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"But why were you upset when I told you of the splash in the
pool late last night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;exactly." The woman spoke hurriedly and
excitedly. "But I thought it might be part of the plot to kill
Monty&mdash;or maybe Monty's body being thrown from the
cliff&mdash;or some one in the water <i>doing dreadful things to
him...</i> Oh, I didn't know what it might be, but I was
afraid...afraid&mdash;" Her voice died away, and she caught her
breath.</p>

<p>Vance rose and regarded her rather coldly.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your information," he said, bowing. "I'm sorry,
and all that, to have upset you. You and Miss Steele may return to
the library now. There are a few other matters to be attended to.
And if we need your assistance later I'm sure you'll both be good
enough to give it."</p>

<p>When they had gone a brief discussion followed as to the best
means of proceeding with the case. The greatest difficulty lay in
the fact that there seemed to be nothing tangible to take hold of.
Montague's murdered body was a reality, of course, and there were
various suspects&mdash;that is, persons with a motive for killing
the man. But there were no connecting links, no indicated lines of
investigation, and no clues pointing in any specific direction. The
actual <i>modus operandi</i> of the murder was in itself an
incalculable mystery. And over the whole situation hung the
sinister mythology of a dragon.</p>

<p>Routine police work was, however, in order; and the Sergeant,
with his trained official mind, insisted on carrying this work
through without further delay. Markham agreed with him; and Vance,
who, for the solution of criminal problems, depended largely upon
intuitive processes and psychological reasoning, finally
acquiesced. The case had deeply impressed him: it held elements
that profoundly appealed to his nature, and he was loath to spare
even an hour for the Sergeant's routine activities. Moreover, he
had, I knew, several definite, even if only vaguely formulated,
ideas concerning the case.</p>

<p>"A very simple key," he said, "is all that's needed to unlock
the door of this fantastic mystery. But without that key we're
helpless...My word, what an amazin' situation! There are any number
of people who admit that they are delighted with Montague's
translation into the Beyond, and each one accuses one of the others
of having manipulated his transit. But, on the other hand, the
circumstances surrounding Montague's death seem to preclude the
possibility of his having been killed at all. It was he who
suggested the swim, and he dived into the pool in sight of every
one...And yet, Markham, I'm thoroughly convinced the whole affair
was carefully planned&mdash;deliberately enciphered with
commonplace numerals to make it appear fortuitous."</p>

<p>Markham was weary and on edge.</p>

<p>"Granted all that, how would you propose going about deciphering
the riddle other than by the usual measures which the Sergeant
intends to take?"</p>

<p>"I have no suggestions at the moment." Vance was gazing
meditatively into space. "I was hopin', however, to inspect Stamm's
collection of tropical fish today."</p>

<p>Markham snorted with exasperation.</p>

<p>"The fish will keep till tomorrow. In the meantime, the Sergeant
can clear up the routine matters."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV - AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<p>(<i>Sunday, August 12; 5.30 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past five when Markham and Vance and I left
the old Stamm mansion and drove back to Vance's apartment. All the
guests and members of the household had been given instructions to
remain until the following day and not to leave the grounds of the
estate. Stamm had generously cooperated with us in this respect.
Greeff had raised objections, and even threatened us with his
lawyer; but finally he had agreed to remain another twenty-four
hours, in view of the complications that had arisen with the
finding of Montague's body. The other guests had accepted Markham's
decision without protest.</p>

<p>All the main entrances to the grounds were to be guarded; and
the servants in the house were to be questioned for any possible
suggestions, although nothing of importance was expected from their
testimony.</p>

<p>Heath had decided to remain at the Stamm estate during this
investigation and direct the activities. Other members of the
Homicide Bureau were to take a hand in the case. Montague's
associations were to be looked into; an attempt was to be made to
find Ellen Bruett; and a canvas of Inwood was planned, in the hope
of unearthing some information about the automobile which had been
heard on the East Road. In short, the usual police procedure was to
be intensively followed, with Sergeant Heath in charge.</p>

<p>"I see no other way to handle the case," Markham said
despondently, as we settled ourselves in the sprawling wicker
chairs on Vance's roof-garden.</p>

<p>Vance was troubled and distrait.</p>

<p>"You may be right. But the factors of this case are far from
ordin'ry. The answer to the whole problem lies somewhere in the
Stamm residence. That's a strange place, Markham. It's full of
infinite possibilities&mdash;with its distorted traditions, its old
superstitions, its stagnant air of a dead and buried age, its
insanity and decadence, and its folklore and demonology. Such a
place produces strange quirks of the mind: even casual visitors are
caught in its corroding atmosphere. Such an atmosphere generates
and begets black and incredible crimes. You have seen, in the last
two days, how every one with whom we talked was poisoned by these
subtle and sinister influences."</p>

<p>For a moment Markham studied Vance intently.</p>

<p>"Have you any particular person in mind?" he asked.</p>

<p>Vance rose and rang for Currie.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of individuals so much as of the perverted
psychological combinations of the problem. And no explanation can
be reached without a recognition and consideration of this
fantastic dragon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vance! For the love of Heaven!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm quite serious. We'll go far afield if we do not
recognize that fact." He looked up. "There are various types of
dragons, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Currie appeared, and Vance ordered Moraine Coolers.*</p>

<p>* The Moraine Cooler was one of Vance's favorite summer drinks.
It is ordinarily made with Rhine wine, lemon juice (with the rind),
Cura&ccedil;ao, and club soda; but Vance always substituted Grand
Marnier for the Cura&ccedil;ao.</p>

<p>"The dragon," Vance continued, "has always had a powerful hold
on the imagination of man. We find the dragon, in some form, in
most religions; and all folk-lore is peppered with dragons. The
dragon goes deeper than a mere myth, Markham: it has become a part
of man's inheritance from the earliest times; it has enhanced his
fears; it has guided and shaped his symbolism; it has put strange
notions in his head by coloring and distorting his imagination.
Without the dragon the history of man would be a very different
record from what it is today. None of us can entirely escape the
dragon myth: it is too much an integral part of our deeper and more
primitive natures. That's why I say that we cannot ignore the
dragon in dealing with a criminal case which is, at bottom,
dragonish..."</p>

<p>Vance moved a little in his chair, and his eyes roamed dreamily
over the hazy skyline of Manhattan.</p>

<p>"Where the conception of the dragon originated no one knows; but
it is probably the most tenacious of all ancient superstitions. The
Christian devil is nothing but a modified dragon of ancient
folk-lore. There have, of course, been many speculations as to the
origin of this supernatural monster, and Moncure Conway, in his
'Demonology and Devil-Lore,' says it is the result of a confused
memory of prehistoric saurians. But other researchers&mdash;Sir
James George Scott, for instance&mdash;take issue with Conway and
attribute the conception of the dragon to the primitive imagination
in connection with snakes. But whatever the origin, it is a
persistent and varied superstition. The dragon has taken many forms
in man's mind. It is a far cry, for example, from the Indian Vrtra
and the Greek Hydra to the mild Burmese dragon and the
<i>drakos</i> of the European Gipsies. And neither of these
conceptions is comparable with the enormous tortoise which King
Thai-to saw swimming toward his royal bark."</p>

<p>Vance sipped his drink, which Currie had just served.</p>

<p>"Every land and every people, Markham, has had its dragons. Even
in ancient Egypt the dragon became more or less identified with
Seth and fought against Horus in the form of water-monsters. And in
the Papyrus of Ani&mdash;or Book of the Dead&mdash;we read of the
fire-breathing dragon Apop, to whom the wicked were thrown. But the
dragon was not always a monster. A dragon-horse brought Fu Hsi the
Eight Diagrams nearly 3000 years B.C.; and whenever the Yellow
Emperor saw dragons he knew that prosperity was at hand. Chinese
mythology, in fact, is filled with dragons, both benevolent and
malevolent. The Fifth Moon Feast in memory of Ch'&uuml; Y&uuml;an's
suicide is called the Dragon Festival; and Fei Ch'ang-fang's magic
rod turned into a dragon and aided him in conquering the ogres of
darkness. In the Buddhist myths we find many references to the
dragon as associated with fish; and there is at least one instance
where the Dragon King himself was carried off to sea in the body of
a fish..."</p>

<p>Markham looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Are you insinuating&mdash;" he began; but Vance interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"No, oh no," he said. "I am not referring to Stamm's collection
of tropicals. It's the dragon myth itself that fascinates me...In
all the Indo-Chinese countries we find the snake&mdash;not the
fish&mdash;as the basis of the dragon. Probably this conception was
brought from China and Japan, where the water-snake was formerly
worshipped as a god. In Indo-Chinese mythology there are any number
of dragon-myths, after the fashion of the Chutia Nagpur tradition.
There is the Naga Min, who is at times represented with coils long
enough to embrace an entire pagoda; and Galon, the Burmese dragon
who appeared like the Indian Garuda; and Bilu, a dragon ogre who
fed on human flesh and never cast a shadow. And you perhaps recall
the myth of Hkun Ai and his Naga princess who was the daughter of
the King of the Dragons, and how he spied upon her and her court
one night, only to find that the entire countryside and all the
lakes around were filled with these gigantic writhing
creatures...In the Han Dynasty the Spirit of the East was
Thang-long, the Blue Dragon; and in the legends of the Karens we
find the spirit of Satan symbolized as a dragon. The mythology of
the Tongkingese abounds in dragons; and their secret hiding-places
exist to this day. Buddhist and Taoist tales are filled with dragon
lore. Even the great Temple of Linh-lanh was supposed to have been
built on a dragon's head. There was a dragon guardian of the city
of Hanoi; and in the Ly Dynasty King Thaiton named the capital
Thanh-long, meaning the Dragon City. The protective idea of the
dragon, d' ye see, is also well established in folk-lore. At Pokhar
in Rajputana there is a sacred lake which, tradition tells us, was
once inhabited by a dragon who guarded the Burmese Temple nearby.
...And the dragon permeates the legends of Siam&mdash;he was
probably brought from India along with Brahmanism and serpent
worship. Siamese dragons lived in caves and under the water...
."</p>

<p>Vance gazed up meditatively at the sky.</p>

<p>"You will note how the water motif runs through these ancient
superstitions," he continued. "Perhaps one of the most significant
tales&mdash;this is from the Japanese&mdash;is that of Kobo Daishi,
the founder of Shingon Buddhism in the ninth century, who drew the
ideogram for dragon on the waters of a stream in the Kozuke
district. When he had finished the ideogram it became an actual
dragon which rose over the water; and it is supposed to have
hovered there ever since&mdash;a superstition no doubt based on the
dense vapors which constantly rise from this mountain stream. And
similar to this tale is the one in which Le-loi's sword turned into
a jade-colored dragon and disappeared in the waters of the sacred
lake which, to this day, is called the Lake of the Great Sword.
Then, there's the legend of the province of Izumo, in Japan, which
tells of a water-dragon who demanded the sacrifice of a virgin each
year, and of how Susa-no-wo slew him when he came up out of the
river. The hero of course married the young lady he had thus
saved...Japanese mythology, like the Chinese, is filled with Dragon
Kings: we find many tales of them in the Shinto chronicles. One of
the most significant legends connected with the Dragon Kings was
that of a Chinese emperor who sent a shipload of treasures to
Japan. During a storm a priceless crystal, which perpetually held
the image of Buddha, was lost. It was supposed to have been stolen
by the Dragon King who lived in the deep waters off the coast of
Sanuki. The crystal was recovered from the Dragon Palace by a poor
fisher-woman who, as a reward, had her only child brought up by the
noble Fujiwara family. The water motif again, Markham...And do you
recall how Toda saved the dragon folk in Lake Biwa by slaying the
giant centipede with poisoned arrows?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't recall it," growled Markham. "And anyway, what's
the point of all this?"</p>

<p>"The dragon myth, old dear&mdash;a most engagin' subject," Vance
returned. Then he went on blandly: "Iranian mythology is filled
with dragons, and they too are related, to a great extent, to
water. In fact, the water of the earth was supposed to be the
result of a god slaying a dragon who was hidden in the clouds.
Indra, with his thunderbolt, slew the dragon of drought. Trita, the
son of Aptya, also slew a tri-headed dragon named Visvarupa. And
there's the story of Keresaspa who slew the dragon Srvra and for
whom Zarathustra intervened. Saam, the vassal of Minucihr, met many
a dragon, but his great battle was with the one that haunted the
river Kashaf. Then there's the Iranian tale which relates of Ahura
Mazda and the monster Azhi with the serpents springing from his
shoulders. And in a Persian manuscript of the <i>Shahnamah,</i> in
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there is a vivid picture of
Gushtasp battling with a dragon."</p>

<p>"I do hope," sighed Markham, "you're not going to ask me to go
to the Metropolitan Museum to inspect the manuscript."</p>

<p>Vance ignored Markham's sarcasm and continued his treatise.</p>

<p>"In Armenian mythology we have the Median king, Azdahak&mdash;a
name which means 'dragon'&mdash;who fought Tigranes and who, after
his defeat, was compelled to bring his family and settle in
Armenia. Anush, who was the Mother of Dragons, was, we are told,
Azdahak's first queen. And here we have, perhaps, the origin of the
dragon children about whom the old songs were written...Vahagn, the
most popular of all the Armenian deities, was known far and wide as
the 'dragon-reaper,' and in later syncretistic times he was
identified with Heracles. Then there was the dragon of the
Macedonians, closely related to the Indian Vrtra and the Armenian
Vishap. This dragon was a gigantic and terrible monster. But in all
Armenian mythology the dragon was, as with other primitive peoples,
associated with meteorology and was supposed to represent the
whirlwind, the water spout, thunder and lightning, and heavy rain;
and often the meteorological and the eschatological dragon were
confused...The water idea connected with the dragon is found also
in the records of the Mayas. The great ceremonial monolith at
Quirigua is known as the Great Turtle or the Dragon, and played an
important part in the Mayan religion."</p>

<p>Vance sipped his drink and glanced up at Markham.</p>

<p>"Am I borin' you horribly?" he asked.</p>

<p>Markham compressed his lips and said nothing; and Vance, with a
sigh, settled himself more comfortably in his chair.</p>

<p>"In Semitic mythology," he went on, "the dragon played an
important and sinister part. In the Babylonian Epic of Creation we
read of the dragons which issued from the belly of Tiamat, released
by B&ecirc;l and the Imhullu wind. These eleven dragons became gods
of the lower regions and were later identified by the astrologers
with various constellations. The Assyrian fish-man was one of the
dragons of Chaos and represented the constellation Aquarius; and
Ninurta, in the creation myth, was commanded by Anu and Enlil to
conquer the <i>ushumgal,</i> or Great Sea Serpent..."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a while in silence.</p>

<p>"The Greeks, and also the Romans, had their dragons. The
Chimera, with her devastating breath of fire, whom Bellerophon
slew, was part lion, part goat, and part dragon. The Golden Apples
of the Hesperides were guarded by a hydra-headed deathless dragon;
and, of course, there was the dragon that Cadmus destroyed and
whose teeth he strew over the earth...And throughout Celtic
mythology we find dragons called <i>p&eacute;ist</i> or
<i>b&eacute;ist</i>&mdash;probably from the Latin
<i>bestia</i>&mdash;living in lochs in various reptilian forms. The
saints destroyed many of these monsters; and if a dragon shrieked
on May-Eve the land was barren until Lludd buried him alive. And
there were the dragons which encircled the oaks in the grove of
which Lucan wrote; and the two dragons of Merlin, who slept in
hollow stones and, when dug up, did battle with each other. Also
there's the dragon who issued from the earth at the sound of
Cliach's harp playing..."</p>

<p>"But we have no harps," protested Markham wearily.</p>

<p>Vance shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"My dear Markham! I fear you have no soul for classical lore.
But we are dealing with a dragon of some sort, and the dragon
superstition should not be entirely ignored. The conception of the
dragon 5000 years ago, for instance, was that he could change his
aspect whenever he chose. The five-clawed dragon of the Manchus was
benevolent and symbolic of power, but the three-clawed dragon was
inimical to man&mdash;the symbol of death and destruction."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" Markham looked up alertly. "Are you trying to get
me stirred up by that imprint with the three claws?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I'm simply borin' you with a few historical details
which may, or may not, prove illuminatin' in our investigation.
There are, however, many variations in the pattern of the dragon:
some are depicted with bearded heads, some with scaly bodies, some
with horns; but all with claws not unlike the marks we have found
on the basin of the pool."</p>

<p>Vance shifted his position a little and went on.</p>

<p>"And there were many winged dragons in mythology, Markham.
Though they lived in lonely pools and lakes and beneath the waters,
they nevertheless could fly, and they often bore their victims
incredible distances. For instance, there were the winged dragons
who bore the chariot of Triptolemus through the skies. And Medea,
as you remember, after slaying her children, fled to Athens in a
chariot hitched to winged dragons which had been sent to her by
Helios."</p>

<p>Markham rose and paced back and forth for a moment.</p>

<p>"What has all this dragon lore to do with Montague's death?" he
asked at length.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, I haven't the vaguest notion," Vance sighed.
"But the myths of the Algonkian Indians are quite in line with the
classical dragon myths; and it was these Indians who named the
Dragon Pool in Inwood and are responsible for the superstition that
attaches to it. The important character of the Algonkian myths is
the Great Hare, whose name was Manabozho, and he did valiant battle
with giants and cannibals and witches. But his outstanding vict'ry
was when he slew the Great Fish or Snake that preyed on man. This
monster was a water-dragon&mdash;<i>Amangemokdom.</i> He ruled the
Powers of the Deep, and one of his favorite pastimes was to destroy
and devour fishermen...You see how interestin' the parallel is?
And, Markham, we're dealing not only with cold-blooded practical
facts, but with a sinister superstition; and we cannot afford to
ignore either one."</p>

<p>Markham was restless and disturbed. He walked to the parapet of
the roof and looked out over the city for several moments. Then he
returned and stood facing Vance.</p>

<p>"Well," he said with a hopeless gesture, "granted what you say
is true, what procedure do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Really now," answered Vance sombrely, "I have no definite
plans. But I do intend to go to the Stamm estate early tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>Markham nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"If you think it necessary, go by all means," he said. "But
you'll have to go alone, for I have a busy day at the office
tomorrow."</p>

<p>But Vance did not go alone. Strange and uncanny things happened
on the Stamm estate that night. Shortly after nine o'clock the next
morning Markham telephoned to Vance. Heath, it seemed, had called
the District Attorney's office and reported that Greeff had
mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV - NOISES IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 9.30 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>We arrived at the Stamm estate before ten o'clock. Immediately
after calling Vance Markham had left his office and stopped in 38th
Street to pick him up. The murder of Montague had taken a powerful
hold on Markham's imagination, and the news of Greeff's
disappearance had made an irresistible demand on his activities. As
he explained to us, driving out in the car, he saw in this new
development the first tangible element in the whole affair; and he
had now put all his other work aside to take personal charge of the
case.</p>

<p>"I've had my suspicions about Greeff from the first," he said.
"There is something sinister in the man; and he has impressed me
all along as being involved in Montague's death. Now that he has
escaped we can go forward with the investigation with something
like a definite aim."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," Vance demurred. He was frowning and smoking
thoughtfully. "The case is not going to be so simple even now. Why
should Greeff attract suspicion to himself by taking leave of the
party? We had no evidence against him; and he must have known that
by bolting he would put in operation all the police machinery in
the city. Very silly of him, Markham&mdash;distressingly silly. And
Greeff does not strike me as a silly man."</p>

<p>"Fear&mdash;" Markham began.</p>

<p>"The man is fearless," Vance interrupted. "It would have been
more logical for any other member of the party to have run away.
...It's most confusin'."</p>

<p>"The fact remains he's gone," Markham retorted testily.
"However, we'll know more when we get there."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite." And Vance lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>When we reached the Stamm house Heath greeted us sourly at the
entrance.</p>

<p>"A sweet mess," he complained. "The only guy I had my eye on has
made his get-away."</p>

<p>"Sad...sad," sighed Vance. "But console yourself, Sergeant, and
unfold your story."</p>

<p>Heath led the way into the drawing-room and planted himself
aggressively before the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"First," he said, addressing Markham, "I'd better report on
what's been done since yesterday afternoon.&mdash;We checked up as
best we could on this Bruett woman, but haven't got a trace of her.
Furthermore, there hasn't been a boat to South America for four
days; so I guess her story to Stamm about sailing was phony. We've
checked on all the likely hotels, without any result. And here's a
funny one:&mdash;she wasn't on the passenger lists of the boats
that've arrived from Europe during the past two weeks. Think that
over. There's something wrong about that dame, and she'll have a
lot of explaining to do when my men locate her."</p>

<p>Vance smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to dampen your official ardor, Sergeant; but I
fear you're not going to find the lady. She's far too sketchy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" snapped Markham. "The automobile on the East
Road at the time stated in the note&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's wholly possible, don't y' know," returned Vance mildly,
"that the lady in question wasn't at the wheel...Really, Sergeant,
I wouldn't wear my nerves out about her."</p>

<p>"I'm looking for her, and I'm going to keep on looking for her,"
Heath asserted with a show of belligerence. Then he turned back to
Markham. "We didn't find out anything about Montague except what we
already know. Always mixed up with some woman&mdash;but what
good-looking actor isn't? He always seemed to have
money&mdash;lived high and spent a lot&mdash;but he didn't have
many jobs, and no one seems to know where his money came from."</p>

<p>"Any news about the car on the East Road Saturday night?" asked
Markham.</p>

<p>"Nothing." Heath was disgusted. "We couldn't find any one in
Inwood who'd seen it or heard it. And the officer on duty on Payson
Avenue says no car came out of Inwood after nine o'clock that
night. He was patrolling from eight o'clock on, and could have seen
any car that came down the hill...Anyway," Heath added, "it may
have coasted down the hill with the lights out."</p>

<p>"Or," suggested Vance vaguely, "it may never have left
Inwood."</p>

<p>Markham shot him a quick look.</p>

<p>"What's back of that remark?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Vance made a slight gesture and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Must there be hidden meanings in all my
observations?...I was merely offering a counter supposition
regarding the elusive vehicle."</p>

<p>Markham grunted.</p>

<p>"Anything else, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Well, we put the servants here on the carpet&mdash;the cook and
the maid; and I went over that pasty-faced butler again." Heath
made a wry face. "But all I got was the same line of gossip that
we've been hearing for a coupla days. They don't know anything, and
we can check 'em off the list."</p>

<p>"The butler," put in Vance, in a quiet tone, "is not without
possibilities, Sergeant. He may not know anything, but no one with
eyes like his can be devoid of suspicions."</p>

<p>Heath looked at Vance with a canny squint.</p>

<p>"You said something, Mr. Vance," he remarked. "But he's too
slippery for me. And he's not giving anything away if he can help
it."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to infer, Sergeant," Vance amended, "that you are
to pin your faith on him for a solution to the case. I was merely
implyin' that the fish-loving Trainor is full of ideas...But, I
say, what about the amazin' disappearance of Alex Greeff? His
truancy fascinates me."</p>

<p>Heath drew himself up and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"He sneaked away some time during the night. And he was damn
slick about it. I stayed here till eleven o'clock, after everybody
had gone to their rooms. Then I went home, leaving Snitkin in
charge. There was a man at the east gate and one at the front gate
all night. Hennessey covered the south border of the estate, and
another man from the Bureau was down below the dam watching Bolton
Road. I got back here at eight-thirty this morning; and Greeff was
gone. I've been in touch with his apartment and his office; but he
hasn't showed up at either place. Skipped out clean..."</p>

<p>"And who," asked Vance, "apprised you of his disappearance?"</p>

<p>"The butler. He met me at the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! The butler&mdash;eh, what?" Vance thought a moment.
"Suppose we let him chant his own rune."</p>

<p>"Suits me."</p>

<p>Heath went from the room, and returned a few minutes later with
Trainor. The man's face was ashen. There were deep hollows under
his eyes, as if he had not slept for nights; and the flabbiness of
his face was like a plastic mask.</p>

<p>"Was it you, Trainor," asked Vance, "who first discovered Mr.
Greeff's absence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;in a manner of speaking, sir." (He did not meet
Vance's direct gaze.) "When Mr. Greeff did not appear for
breakfast, Mr. Stamm sent me up-stairs to call him..."</p>

<p>"What time was that?"</p>

<p>"About half-past eight, sir."</p>

<p>"Was every one else down at the time?"</p>

<p>"Every one, sir. They were all in the dining-room. It was
unusually early&mdash;if you understand me&mdash;but I surmise that
no one slept very well last night. Mr. Leland and Miss Stamm were
downstairs before seven; and the others followed shortly afterward.
Every one but Mr. Greeff, you understand, sir."</p>

<p>"And they all retired to their rooms early last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Quite early. I put out the down-stairs lights about
eleven."</p>

<p>"Who was the last to retire?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stamm, sir. He had been drinking heavily again&mdash;if you
will forgive me for saying so. But this is no time for
reticence&mdash;is it, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, Trainor." Vance was studying the other closely. "Any little
detail may be of vital help to us; and I'm sure Mr. Stamm would not
construe your information as disloyalty."</p>

<p>The man seemed relieved.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And now, Trainor," continued Vance, "tell us about this
morning. At half-past eight Mr. Stamm sent you to call Mr. Greeff.
And then?"</p>

<p>"I went to his room, sir&mdash;it is just down the hall from Mr.
Stamm's&mdash;and I knocked. I got no answer, and I knocked again.
After I had knocked several times, I got a little
worried,&mdash;strange things have been happening around here,
sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Very strange things, Trainor. But continue. What did
you do then?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I tried the door, sir." The man's eyes rolled, but he
did not look at any one of us. "It was unlocked; and I opened it
and looked into the room...I noticed the bed had not been slept in;
and I felt a most peculiar sensation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare us your symptoms, Trainor." Vance was becoming impatient.
"Tell us what you did."</p>

<p>"I entered the room, sir, and made sure that Mr. Greeff was not
there. Then I returned to the dining-room and indicated to Mr.
Stamm that I wished to speak to him alone. He came into the hall,
and I informed him of Mr. Greeff's absence."</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Stamm say?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything, sir. But he had a very queer look on
his face. He stood at the foot of the stairs frowning. Then, after
a few moments, he pushed me to one side and ran up-stairs. I went
back into the dining-room and continued serving the breakfast."</p>

<p>Heath took up the story at this point.</p>

<p>"I was in the front hall when Stamm came down," he said. "He was
looking queer, all right. But when he saw me he came right up to me
and told me about Greeff's being gone. I did a little looking
around, and questioned the men on post duty; but they hadn't seen
any one leave the estate. Then I phoned to Mr. Markham."</p>

<p>Vance, for some reason, appeared deeply troubled.</p>

<p>"Amazin'," he murmured, busying himself with a cigarette. When
it was lighted he turned back to the butler. "What time did Mr.
Greeff go up-stairs last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say exactly, sir." The man was growing noticeably
more nervous. "But Mr. Greeff was one of the last to retire."</p>

<p>"And what time did you yourself go to your quarters?"</p>

<p>The butler moved forward, thrust out his head, and swallowed
with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Shortly after eleven, sir," he replied in a strained voice. "I
closed up the house as soon as this gentleman"&mdash;indicating
Heath&mdash;"had gone. Then I went to my room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is your room?"</p>

<p>"At the rear of the house, sir, on this floor&mdash;next to the
kitchen." There was a peculiar intonation in his voice that puzzled
me.</p>

<p>Vance sank deeper into his chair and crossed his knees.</p>

<p>"I say, Trainor," he drawled, "what did you hear last night,
after you had gone to your room?"</p>

<p>The butler gave a start and sucked in his breath, and his
fingers began to twitch. It was several moments before he
answered.</p>

<p>"I heard"&mdash;he spoke with a curious mechanical
precision&mdash;"some one slide the bolt on the side door."</p>

<p>"The door that leads out to the steps to the pool?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything else? Any footsteps?"</p>

<p>Trainor shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;nothing else." The man's eyes moved vaguely about
the room. "Nothing, sir, until an hour or so later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! And what did you hear then?"</p>

<p>"I heard the bolt being thrown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What else?" Vance had risen and was confronting the man
sternly.</p>

<p>Trainor retreated a step or two, and the twitching of his
fingers increased.</p>

<p>"I heard some one go up-stairs&mdash;very softly."</p>

<p>"To which room?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't say, sir."</p>

<p>Vance gazed at the man indifferently for several seconds; then
he turned and walked back to his chair.</p>

<p>"Who did you think it was?" he asked lazily.</p>

<p>"It occurred to me that perhaps Mr. Stamm had gone out for a
little walk."</p>

<p>Vance smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Trainor, if you thought it was Mr. Stamm you
wouldn't be so frightfully upset."</p>

<p>"But who else could it have been, sir?" the man protested
weakly.</p>

<p>Vance was silent for a while.</p>

<p>"That will be all, Trainor," he said at length. "Tell Mr. Leland
we're here and would like to see him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The butler went out, obviously relieved to have the
interrogation over; and shortly afterward Leland entered the
drawing-room. He was smoking his pipe calmly, and greeted us with
more than his usual reserve.</p>

<p>"You know, of course, Mr. Leland," Vance began, "that Greeff
isn't around this morning. Can you suggest any possible explanation
for this?"</p>

<p>Leland appeared worried and sank into a chair by the table.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I can see no reason why he should have run off.
He is not the kind to run away from anything."</p>

<p>"Exactly my impression," nodded Vance. "Have you spoken to any
of the other persons in the house about it?"</p>

<p>Leland nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we all discussed it at breakfast and afterwards. Every one
seems to be mystified."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything during the night that might have
indicated when he left the house?"</p>

<p>Leland hesitated before answering.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied finally. "But I also heard something that
would indicate that it was not Greeff who went out."</p>

<p>"You mean the rebolting of the side door an hour or so after it
had been unbolted?"</p>

<p>Leland looked up in mild surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Just that. Shortly after midnight some one went
out the side door, but later some one re-entered the house. I had
not been able to go to sleep&mdash;and my hearing is particularly
keen..."</p>

<p>"Trainor, too, heard some one go out and come in last night,"
Vance told him. "But he couldn't tell to what room the midnight
prowler returned. Perhaps you are able to enlighten us on that
point?"</p>

<p>Again Leland hesitated, and shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid not," he said. "My room is on the third floor,
and several people were moving about below me. I will say this,
however: whoever it was that came back to the house was very
careful not to make any unnecessary noise."</p>

<p>Vance had scarcely looked at Leland during the questioning, and
he now rose and walked to the front window and back.</p>

<p>"Is the room you occupy," he asked, "on the side of the house
facing the pool?"</p>

<p>Leland took his pipe leisurely from his mouth and moved uneasily
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is just across the side passageway from Mrs. Stamm's
quarters."</p>

<p>"Did you hear any one outside the house after the side door had
been opened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did!" Leland sat upright in his chair and carefully
repacked his pipe. "I heard voices, as if two people were talking
in low tones. But it was only the merest murmur, and I could not
distinguish what they were saying or who it was."</p>

<p>"Could you tell whether it was a man or woman speaking?"</p>

<p>"No. It seemed to me that they were deliberately pitching their
voices to a whisper, to avoid being overheard."</p>

<p>"How long did this whispered conversation last?"</p>

<p>"Only a few seconds. Then it faded away."</p>

<p>"As if the two holding converse were walking away from the
house?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Vance swung about quickly and faced Leland.</p>

<p>"What else did you happen to hear last night, Mr. Leland?"</p>

<p>Once again Leland hesitated, and busied himself with relighting
his pipe.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he answered reluctantly. "But there was a
scraping sound at the far side of the pool, toward the East
Road."</p>

<p>"Most interestin'." Vance did not relax his steady gaze. "Will
you describe, as nearly as possible, just what you heard."</p>

<p>Leland looked down at the floor, and smoked intently for a
moment.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "I heard a faint grating noise, as of one
piece of metal being rubbed against another&mdash;at least, such
was my impression. Then all was silence for several minutes. A
little later the same sound was repeated and, still later, I could
distinguish a low, continuous noise, as of something heavy being
dragged over a sandy surface. This noise became fainter and
fainter, until finally it died away altogether...I heard nothing
more until perhaps half an hour later, when some one re-entered the
house through the side door and replaced the bolt."</p>

<p>"Did these noises strike you as peculiar in any way?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say that they did. We had all been told we had
access to the grounds, and I took it for granted, when I heard the
side door open, that some one was going out for a walk in the air.
The other noises&mdash;those on the other side of the
pool&mdash;were very indistinct and might have been explained in
various ways. I knew, of course, that a man had been stationed at
the gate on the East Road, and I suppose I assumed&mdash;without
giving the matter any particular thought&mdash;that it was he whom
I heard across the pool. It was not until this morning, when I
learned of the disappearance of Greeff, that I attached any
importance to what I had heard during the night."</p>

<p>"And now, knowing that Mr. Greeff is gone, can you offer any
explanation for the noises you heard?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot." Leland thought a moment. "They were not familiar
sounds; and while the metallic noise might have been the creaking
of the hinges of the gate, there would have been no point in
Greeff's opening the gate to make his escape, for he could very
easily have climbed over, or walked round it. Moreover, the sound
seemed to be much nearer to the house than the gate is. In any
event, there was some one guarding the gate, and Greeff would not
have chosen that avenue of escape&mdash;there are too many other
ways of leaving the estate, if he really wished to do so."</p>

<p>Vance nodded as if satisfied, and again strolled toward the
front window.</p>

<p>"Did you, by any chance," he asked casually, "hear an automobile
on the East Road last night?"</p>

<p>"No." Leland shook his head with emphasis. "I can assure you no
car traversed the East Road in either direction up to the time I
fell asleep&mdash;which, I should say, was about two o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>Vance turned leisurely at the window.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Greeff," he asked, "by any action or any remark, give
you the impression that he contemplated leaving the estate?"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary," Leland returned. "He did grouse a bit
about being detained here. He said it might mean the loss of some
business at his office this morning; but he seemed resigned to
seeing the affair through."</p>

<p>"Did he have any words with any one last night?"</p>

<p>"No, he was in unusually good humor. He drank a bit more than is
his custom, and spent most of the evening, after dinner, discussing
financial matters with Stamm."</p>

<p>"Any evidences of animosity between them?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. Stamm seemed to have forgotten completely his
outburst of the night before."</p>

<p>Vance walked back and stood before Leland.</p>

<p>"What of the other members of the party?" he asked. "How did
they disport themselves after dinner?"</p>

<p>"Most of them went out on the terrace. Miss Stamm and I walked
down to the pool, but we returned immediately&mdash;a pall seemed
to hang over it. When we came back to the house, Mrs. McAdam and
Miss Steele and young Tatum were sitting on the steps of the
terrace, drinking some sort of punch that Trainor had made for
them."</p>

<p>"Where were Greeff and Stamm?"</p>

<p>"They were still in the library. I doubt if they had gone
outdoors at all."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment in thoughtful silence; then he resumed his
chair and lay back languidly.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," he said. "That will be all for the
present."</p>

<p>Leland rose.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any help&mdash;" he began, and then contemplated
his pipe. Without finishing the sentence he went from the room.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Vance?" Markham asked with a puzzled
frown, when we were alone.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," Vance returned, his eyes on the ceiling. "Too
many strange things have been happening in these ancient purlieus.
And it's not like Greeff to walk out in the middle of the
night..."</p>

<p>At this moment some one came hurrying down from up-stairs, and a
few seconds later we heard Stamm telephoning to Doctor
Holliday.</p>

<p>"You'd better come as soon as you can," he was saying nervously.
Then, after a pause, he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>Vance had risen and gone to the door.</p>

<p>"May we see you a moment, Mr. Stamm." His request was
practically a command.</p>

<p>Stamm crossed the hall and entered the drawing-room. It was
obvious that he was laboring under some suppressed excitement. The
muscles of his face were twitching, and his eyes were staring and
restless.</p>

<p>Before he could speak Vance addressed him.</p>

<p>"We heard you phoning to the doctor. Is Mrs. Stamm ill
again?"</p>

<p>"The same trouble," Stamm answered. "And it's probably my own
fault. I went up to see her a while ago, and I mentioned that
Greeff was missing. Then she started in with her pet hallucination.
Said he was missing because the dragon had got him. Insisted she
saw the dragon rise out of the pool last night and fly down toward
Spuyten Duyvil."</p>

<p>"Most interestin'." Vance leaned against the edge of the table
and looked at Stamm through half-closed eyes. "Have you yourself
any more rational explanation of Greeff's disappearance?"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;understand it." Stamm appeared nonplussed. "From
what he said last night he had no intention of leaving the place
till you gentlemen gave him permission to go. Seemed quite content
to remain here."</p>

<p>"By the by, did you happen to go outdoors late last night?"</p>

<p>Stamm looked up with considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"Didn't leave the house after dinner," he said. "Greeff and I
sat in the library chatting till he went up-stairs. I had a
nightcap and went to bed very soon after he did."</p>

<p>"Some one," mused Vance, "let himself out by the side door
around midnight."</p>

<p>"Good God! That must have been when Greeff walked out."</p>

<p>"But it seems some one came back through the side door an hour
or so later."</p>

<p>Stamm stared with glassy eyes, and his lower lip sagged.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you're sure?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Both Mr. Leland and Trainor heard the bolt being opened and
closed," Vance returned.</p>

<p>"Leland heard it?"</p>

<p>"So he told us a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>A change came over Stamm. He drew himself up and made a
deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>"Probably some one went out for an airing."</p>

<p>Vance nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>"That's quite reasonable...Sorry to have bothered you. I presume
you want to return to your mother."</p>

<p>Stamm nodded gratefully.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind. Doctor Holliday is coming right over. If you
want me I'll be up-stairs." And he hurried from the room.</p>

<p>When the sound of his footsteps had died out up the stairs,
Vance suddenly rose and threw his cigarette into the grate.</p>

<p>"Come, Markham," he said with animation, moving toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" Markham demanded.</p>

<p>Vance turned at the porti&egrave;res. His eyes were cold and
hard.</p>

<p>"To the pot-holes," he said quietly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI - BLOOD AND A GARDENIA</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 10.15 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>Markham sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Good God! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>But Vance was already on his way to the front door, and without
answering, he ran quickly down the steps and took his place at the
wheel of his car. Markham and Heath, silent and, I thought, a
little dazed, got into the tonneau, and I followed. Something in
Vance's manner when he mentioned the pot holes sent a chill up my
spine, and I wondered vaguely&mdash;without admitting to myself the
hideous suspicion that had been roused in me by his sudden
decision&mdash;what it was that he hoped to learn at the scene
where he had discovered Montague's body.</p>

<p>We sped down the East Road, through the gate, and on toward the
Clove. When we were opposite the pot-holes Vance threw on the
brakes and sprang down to the ground. We followed him as he
hastened to the foot of the rocks and drew himself up to the top of
the low wall of the hole where Montague's remains had been
found.</p>

<p>He gazed over the edge a moment and then turned back to us, his
face grave. He said nothing but merely made a gesture toward the
hole. Heath was already climbing to the top of the wall, and
Markham and I were close behind him. Then came a tense moment of
silence: we were all too horrified at the sight to speak.</p>

<p>Heath slid down from the wall, a look of combined anger and fear
on his grim face.</p>

<p>"Mother of God!" he mumbled, and crossed himself.</p>

<p>Markham stood at the foot of the wall with a faraway look of
horror and bafflement. And I found it difficult, in the peaceful
atmosphere of that calm summer morning, to adjust my mind and
emotions to the hideous thing I had just beheld.</p>

<p>There, in the depths of the pot-hole, lay the crumpled dead body
of Alex Greeff. His position, like that of Montague, was unnatural
and distorted, as if he had been dropped from a height into this
narrow rock grave. Across the left side of his head ran a gaping
wound, and there were black bruises on his neck. He wore no
waistcoat, and his coat was open, exposing his breast. His shirt
had been ripped down the front, like the jersey of Montague's
bathing suit, and there were three long gashes in the flesh, as if
a monster's claw had torn him downward from the throat. The moment
I looked at him, mutilated in exactly the same manner as Montague,
all the wild stories of the dragon of the pool came back to me and
froze my blood.</p>

<p>Markham had brought his gaze back from the distance and looked
wonderingly at Vance.</p>

<p>"How did you know he was here?" he asked huskily.</p>

<p>Vance's eyes were focused on the tip of his cigarette.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," he answered softly. "But after Stamm told us of
his mother's comment when she heard Greeff had disappeared, I
thought it best to come down here..."</p>

<p>"The dragon again!" Markham spoke angrily, but there was an
undertone of awe in his voice. "You're not trying to intimate, are
you, that the ravings of that crazy woman are to be taken
seriously?"</p>

<p>"No, Markham," Vance returned mildly. "But she knows a great
many things, and her predictions thus far have all been
correct."</p>

<p>"That's sheer coincidence," Markham protested. "Come, come,
let's be practical."</p>

<p>"Whoever killed Greeff was certainly practical," observed
Vance.</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens! where do we stand now?" Markham was both
baffled and irritable. "Greeff's murder only complicates the case.
We now have two hideous problems instead of one."</p>

<p>"No, no, Markham." Vance moved slowly back to the car. "I
wouldn't say that, don't y' know. It's all one problem. And it's
clearer now than it was. A certain pattern is beginning to take
shape&mdash;the dragon pattern."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Markham fairly barked the reprimand.</p>

<p>"It's not nonsense, old dear." Vance got into the car. "The
imprints on the bed of the pool, the talon-like marks on Montague
and now on Greeff, and&mdash;above all&mdash;the curious
prognostications of old Mrs. Stamm&mdash;these must all be
accounted for before we can eliminate the dragon theory. An amazin'
situation."</p>

<p>Markham lapsed into indignant silence as Vance started the car.
Then he said with sarcasm:</p>

<p>"I think we'll work this case out on anti-dragon lines."</p>

<p>"That will depend entirely on the type of dragon you have in
mind," Vance returned, as he guided the car round and started back
up the East Road to the Stamm estate.</p>

<p>When we reached the house Heath went immediately to the
telephone and notified Doctor Doremus of our second gruesome find.
As he hung up the receiver he turned to Markham with a look of
hopeless desperation.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to handle this job, Chief," he admitted in an
appealing tone.</p>

<p>Markham looked at him a moment and slowly nodded his head
appreciatively.</p>

<p>"I know just how you feel, Sergeant." He took out a cigar,
carefully clipped the end, and lighted it. "The usual methods don't
seem to get us anywhere." He was profoundly perplexed.</p>

<p>Vance was standing in the middle of the hall, gazing at the
floor.</p>

<p>"No," he murmured, without looking up. "The usual methods are
futile. The roots of these two crimes go down much deeper than
that. The murders are diabolical&mdash;in more than one sense; and
they are closely related, in some strange way, to all the sinister
factors which go to make up this household and its influences..."
He ceased speaking and turned his head toward the staircase.</p>

<p>Stamm and Leland were descending from the second floor, and
Vance immediately approached them.</p>

<p>"Will you gentlemen please come into the drawing-room," he said.
"We have a bit of news for you."</p>

<p>A breath of air stirred in the room: the sun had not yet reached
that side of the house. Vance turned to the west window and gazed
out a few moments. Then he turned back to Stamm and Leland who were
standing just inside the porti&egrave;res.</p>

<p>"We have found Greeff," he said. "He is dead&mdash;in the same
pot-hole where Montague's body was chucked."</p>

<p>Stamm paled perceptibly and caught his breath. But Leland's
expression did not change. He took his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Murdered, of course." His remark was half question and half
statement.</p>

<p>"Murdered, of course." Vance repeated the words, nodding. "A
messy affair. The same sort of wounds we found on Montague. A
perfect duplication of the technique, in fact."</p>

<p>Stamm wavered on his feet, as if he had been struck a physical
blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he muttered, with a sucking intake of breath.</p>

<p>Leland grasped him quickly by the arm and led him to a
chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Rudolf," he said kindly. "You and I have been
expecting this ever since we knew that Greeff was missing."</p>

<p>Stamm slumped into the chair and sat glaring before him with
unseeing eyes. Leland turned back to Vance.</p>

<p>"I feared all morning," he said simply, "that Greeff did not
absent himself voluntarily...Have you learned anything else?"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing else. But I think we'll take a look around
Greeff's room. Do you know which one it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Leland answered quietly. "I will be very glad to show
you."</p>

<p>We had barely passed over the threshold of the drawing-room door
when Stamm's strained, husky voice halted us.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;wait a minute!" he called, struggling
forward in his chair. "There's something I should have told you.
But I was afraid&mdash;God help me, I was afraid!"</p>

<p>Vance regarded the man quizzically.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, in a curiously stern voice.</p>

<p>"It's about last night." Stamm's hands clutched the arms of the
chair, and he held himself rigid as he spoke. "After I had gone to
my room Greeff came and tapped on my door. I opened it and let him
in. He said he did not feel like sleeping and thought he would join
me in another drink, if I did not mind. We talked for an hour or
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About what, for instance?" interrupted Vance.</p>

<p>"Nothing of importance&mdash;generalities about finance, and the
possibilities of a new expedition to the South Seas next spring.
...Then Greeff looked at his watch. 'It's midnight,' he said. 'I
think I'll take a stroll before I turn in.' He went out and I heard
him go down to the lower hall, unbolt the side door&mdash;my room,
you know, is just at the head of the stairs. I was tired and I got
into bed, and&mdash;and&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Why were you afraid to tell us this before?" Vance asked
coldly.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;exactly." Stamm relaxed and settled back in
his chair. "I didn't think anything of it last night. But when
Greeff failed to put in an appearance this morning, I realized that
I was the last person to see him and talk to him before he went
out. I saw no reason for mentioning the fact this morning, but
after what you've just told us&mdash;about his body being found in
the pot-hole&mdash;I felt that you ought to know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's quite all right," Vance assured him, in a somewhat
softened tone. "Your feelings are quite natural in the
circumstances."</p>

<p>Stamm lifted his head and gave him a grateful look.</p>

<p>"Would you mind asking Trainor to bring me some whisky?" he
asked weakly.</p>

<p>"Not at all." And Vance turned and walked into the hall.</p>

<p>After sending the butler to Stamm we went up-stairs. Greeff's
room was the second one from Stamm's on the same side of the hall.
The door was unlocked and we went in. As Trainor had told us, the
bed had not been slept in; and the window shades were still drawn.
The room was somewhat similar to Montague's, but it was larger and
more luxuriously furnished. A few toilet articles lay neatly on the
dressing-table; a pongee robe and a pair of pajamas were thrown
over the foot of the bed; and on a chair near the window lay
Greeff's dinner suit, in a rumpled heap. On the floor, near an
end-table, was a gaping Gladstone bag.</p>

<p>The inspection of Greeff's belongings took but a short time.
Vance went first to the clothes-closet and found there a brown
business suit and a sport suit; but the pockets held nothing of any
importance. The dinner suit was then investigated, without any
enlightening result: its pockets contained merely an ebony
cigarette holder, a cigarette case of black moir&eacute; silk, and
two elaborately monogrammed handkerchiefs. There was nothing
belonging to Greeff in the drawers of the dressing-table; and in
the cabinet of the bathroom were only the usual toilet
accessories&mdash;a toothbrush and paste, a shaving outfit, a
bottle of toilet water and a shaker of talcum powder. Nor did the
Gladstone bag yield anything significant or suggestive.</p>

<p>Vance had said nothing during the search, but there was an
intent eagerness in his attitude. He now stood in the middle of the
room, looking down, his eyes half closed in troubled thought. It
was patent that he was disappointed.</p>

<p>Slowly he lifted his head, shrugged slightly, and started toward
the door.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's nothing here that will help us," he said;
and there was something in his voice that made me feel that he was
referring to some specific, but unnamed, object which he had hoped
to find.</p>

<p>Markham, too, must have caught the undertone in Vance's voice
which had conveyed this impression to me, for he asked crisply:</p>

<p>"Just what, Vance, were you expecting to discover in this
room?"</p>

<p>Vance hesitated and turned slowly back to us.</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure...There should have been something here.
But don't ask me to say what&mdash;there's a good fellow. I
wouldn't know exactly how to answer." He smiled ingratiatingly and,
turning, went out into the hall. The rest of us followed him.</p>

<p>As we reached the head of the stairs Doctor Holliday was just
coming up from the main floor. He greeted us with reserved
cordiality, and we were about to start down the stairs when, with
what seemed a sudden impulse, Vance halted.</p>

<p>"I say, doctor," he asked, "would you mind if we went up with
you? There's something of vital importance I would like to ask Mrs.
Stamm. I sha'n't disturb her..."</p>

<p>"Come along," Doctor Holliday nodded, as he turned on the
landing and swung his bulky frame up toward the third floor.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Schwarz opened the door for us Mrs. Stamm was standing
at the open window overlooking the pool, her back to us. As we
entered the room she turned slowly until her fiery eyes rested on
us. There seemed to be a new glittering quality in her gaze, but
there was no smile on her lips: her mouth was at once grim and
placid.</p>

<p>Vance walked directly toward her, halting only when he was
within a few feet of her.</p>

<p>His expression was severe; his eyes were determined.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stamm," he said, in a stern, quiet tone, "terrible things
have happened here. And more terrible things are going to
happen&mdash;<i>unless you help us.</i> And these other terrible
things will not be of a nature that will please you. They will
befall those who are not enemies of the Stamms; and, therefore,
your dragon&mdash;that protector of your household&mdash;could not
be held responsible."</p>

<p>A frightened look came into the woman's eyes as she stared
raptly at Vance.</p>

<p>"What can I do to help you?" Her voice was a hollow monotone, as
if she had merely thought the words and her lips had automatically
articulated them.</p>

<p>"You can tell us," Vance answered, without relaxing his severity
of tone, "where you have hidden the key to the family vault."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes closed slowly, as if from some great physical
reaction, and she took a long, deep breath. I may have imagined it,
but I received the strong impression that Vance's words had brought
her a sense of relief. Then her eyelids went up quickly: a certain
calm had come into her gaze.</p>

<p>"Is that all you wish to know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is all, madam&mdash;but it is vitally important. And I
give you my word that the tomb of your dead will not be
desecrated."</p>

<p>The woman studied Vance appraisingly for several moments. Then
she moved to the large chair by the window and sat down. With slow
but resolute determination she reached into the bosom of her black
lace dress and drew forth a small rectangular scapular on which I
could see the faded image of a saint. The stitching, which held the
linen and chamois-skin together, was open at the top, so that the
scapular was in actuality a small bag. Turning it upside down, she
shook it; and presently there fell out into her hand a small flat
key.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwarz," she commanded dictatorially, "take this key and
go to my old steamer trunk in the clothes-closet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Schwarz took the key, turned stoically and, opening the
small door in the east wall of the room, disappeared into the
semi-darkness beyond.</p>

<p>"<i>Ja,</i> Frau Stamm," she called from within.</p>

<p>"Now unlock the trunk and lift out the tray," Mrs. Stamm
instructed her. "Carefully turn up all the old linen you see there.
In the right-hand back corner there is an old jewel box, wrapped in
a damask tablecloth. Bring out the box."</p>

<p>After a few moments, during which Vance stood in silence looking
out the window at the cliffs beyond the pool, Mrs. Schwarz emerged
from the closet, carrying a beautiful Venetian box, about eight
inches long and six inches wide, with a rounded top. It was covered
in faded mauve brocaded velvet, surmounted with hammered-metal
scroll-work.</p>

<p>"Hand it to this gentleman." Mrs. Stamm made an awkward gesture
toward Vance. "The vault key is inside."</p>

<p>Vance came forward and took the box. He threw the catch and
opened the lid. Markham had stepped up to him and stood looking
over his shoulder. After a moment's inspection Vance closed the box
and handed it back to Mrs. Schwarz.</p>

<p>"You may put it away again," he said, in a tone and with a look
which constituted a command. Then he turned to Mrs. Stamm and,
bowing, said: "You have helped us no end. And I want you to know
that we deeply appreciate your confidence."</p>

<p>A faint smile of cynical gratification distorted the contour of
Mrs. Stamm's mouth.</p>

<p>"Are you entirely satisfied?" she asked. (There was an undertone
of both sarcasm and triumph in her voice.)</p>

<p>"Quite," Vance assured her.</p>

<p>He took his leave at once. Doctor Holliday remained with his
patient. When we were again in the hallway and Mrs. Schwarz had
closed the door behind us, Markham took Vance by the arm.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, frowning deeply; "what was the idea? Are
you going to let her put you off with an empty box?"</p>

<p>"But she hasn't, don't y' know," Vance returned dulcetly. "She
didn't know the box was empty. She thought the key was there. Why
upset her by telling her the box is empty?"</p>

<p>"What has the key got to do with it, anyway?" Markham demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm trying to ascertain." And before Markham could
say anything more, Vance turned to Leland, who had watched the
entire proceeding in puzzled silence. "Can you show us where
Tatum's room is?" he asked.</p>

<p>We had now reached the second-story landing, and Leland drew
himself up with a curious start: his habitual air of cool reserve
momentarily deserted him.</p>

<p>"Tatum's room?" he repeated, as if he doubted that he had heard
Vance correctly. But immediately he recovered himself and turned.
"His room is just here, across the hall," he said. "It is the one
between Stamm's room and Greeff's."</p>

<p>Vance crossed the hall to the door Leland indicated. It was
unlocked, and he opened it and stepped inside the room. We followed
him, puzzled and silent. Markham appeared even more surprised than
Leland had been at Vance's sudden and unexpected query about
Tatum's room. He now gave Vance a searching, inquisitive look, and
was about to say something but checked himself and waited.</p>

<p>Vance stood in the middle of the room, glancing about him and
letting his gaze rest for a moment on each piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Heath's expression was hard and determined. Without waiting for
Vance to speak, he asked:</p>

<p>"Do you want me to get the guy's clothes out and make a
search?"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head in a slow, thoughtful negative.</p>

<p>"I don't think that will be necess'ry, Sergeant. But you might
look under the bed and on the floor of the clothes-closet."</p>

<p>Heath drew out his flashlight and went down on his hands and
knees. After a brief inspection, he stood up with a grunt.</p>

<p>"Nothing there but a pair of slippers." He went to the
clothes-closet and made another inspection.</p>

<p>"Just some shoes, that's all," he announced upon emerging.</p>

<p>Vance, in the meantime, had gone to the low-boy beside the
window and opened the drawers, examining them carefully. He then
went to the dressing-table and repeated the operation. There was a
look of disappointment on his face as he turned away from the table
and slowly lit a cigarette. Again his eyes roamed about the room
and finally came to rest on a Queen Anne night-table beside the
bed.</p>

<p>"One more chance," he murmured, as he crossed the room and drew
out the small drawer of burl walnut.</p>

<p>"Ah, quite!"</p>

<p>He reached into the drawer and withdrew some object which we
could not see. Then he approached Leland and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Is that the key to the vault, Mr. Leland?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is the key," said Leland simply.</p>

<p>Markham strode forward, his face an ugly red.</p>

<p>"How did you know the key was here?" he demanded angrily. "And
what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was here, old dear," Vance returned with
exaggerated sweetness. "And I don't know what it means...But I
think we'll take a peep at the vault&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>When we were again in the lower hall Vance turned to Leland with
a serious and stern gaze.</p>

<p>"You will remain here, please," he said. "And you're to make no
mention, to any one, of the fact that we have found the key to the
vault."</p>

<p>Leland appeared nettled at Vance's tone. He bowed with
considerable dignity.</p>

<p>"I will, of course, respect your wishes," he replied, and turned
toward the library.</p>

<p>Vance went immediately to the front door. We circled the house
to the north, descended the steps to the pool, traversed the coping
of the filter, and turned into the narrow tree-lined cement walk
which led to the East Road. When we had reached a point where we
were entirely hidden from observation, Vance led the way through
the shrubbery toward the ivy-covered vault. Taking the key from his
pocket, he inserted it in the keyhole and turned it. I was
astonished to see how easily the tumblers swung back and operated
the bolt. Vance leaned against the heavy door, and it moved slowly
inward, rasping and creaking on its rusty iron hinges.</p>

<p>A musty dead odor assailed us from the dimness within.</p>

<p>"Let's have your flashlight, Sergeant," Vance said, as he passed
over the threshold.</p>

<p>Heath complied with alacrity, and we stepped into the ancient
vault of the Stamms. Then Vance cautiously closed the door and
played the beam of the flashlight about the walls and ceiling and
floor. Even on that hot summer day there was a damp and chilling
atmosphere in this gruesome half-buried tomb, with its encrusted
walls of dank mortar, its age-discolored marble floor, and its
tiers of wooden coffins, which stretched across the entire south
side of the vault, from the floor to the ceiling.</p>

<p>After a casual inspection Vance knelt down and examined the
floor carefully.</p>

<p>"Some one's been walking round here recently," he remarked. He
moved the circle of light along the marble tiles, toward the
coffins. On one of the tiles were two small dark spots.</p>

<p>Stepping toward them, Vance leaned over. Then he moistened a
finger and touched one of them. When he moved his finger directly
into the light there was visible a dark red smudge.</p>

<p>"That will be blood, Markham," he commented dryly, as he stood
up.</p>

<p>Again he moved the flashlight back and forth across the floor,
systematically traversing each of the large marble tiles. Suddenly
he stepped forward, toward the north wall of the vault and,
reaching swiftly down, picked up something which I had not even
noticed, although my eyes had been following the sweep of the
light.</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt! That's interestin'." He extended his hand in the
circle of intense illumination cast by the flashlight.</p>

<p>We beheld there a small gardenia, still white and fresh-looking,
with only the edges of the petals curled and browning.</p>

<p>"Greeff's gardenia, I imagine." Vance's tone was low and held a
faint undercurrent of sinister awe. "You remember he wore one
yesterday afternoon when we talked with him. And there was no
gardenia in his coat lapel when we found him in the pot-hole this
morning!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII - THE DUPLICATED DEATH</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 11.15 a. m.</i>)</p>

<p>We came out of the chilly dank vault into the hot sunlight, and
there was something benign and steadying in the vista of trees and
shrubbery and the intimate, familiar objects of the outdoors.</p>

<p>"I think that will be all for the present," Vance said, in a
curiously hushed voice, as he locked the ponderous iron door and
dropped the key into his pocket. He turned, a deep frown on his
forehead, and started back toward the house. "Bloodstains and a
gardenia! My word!"</p>

<p>"But, Vance," protested Markham, "those marks on Greeff's
body:&mdash;surely Greeff wasn't in the pool last night. His
clothes were perfectly dry and showed no signs of having been
wetted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what's in your mind," Vance interrupted. "And you're
quite right. Even if Greeff was murdered in the vault, the same
cannot be said of Montague. That's the confusin' part of it... .
But let's wait a bit before we speculate." He made a slight
gesture, as if to request silence, and continued his way across the
coping of the filter.</p>

<p>When we had reached the south side of the pool and were about to
mount the steps leading to the house, I happened to glance up. On
the third-floor balcony sat old Mrs. Stamm, her elbows on the
railing and her head buried between her hands. Behind her stood the
imperturbable Mrs. Schwarz, gazing down at her.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came drifting out of the library windows the
blurred, cacophonic strains of a popular dance tune played
<i>fortissimo</i> on the piano; and I assumed that Tatum was
endeavoring to throw off the depressing pall that hung over the old
house. But as suddenly as the raucous music had begun, it ceased;
and at this moment Vance, who was leading the way up the steps,
turned and spoke, with the air of one who had made a final decision
on some moot and difficult problem.</p>

<p>"It would be best to say nothing to any one about our visit to
the vault. The right time has not come yet." His eyes were troubled
as they rested on Markham. "I can't fit the pattern together yet.
But something horrible is going on here, and there's no telling
what might happen if what we have just discovered became
known."</p>

<p>He gazed at his cigarette speculatively, as if trying to make
another decision. At length he added:</p>

<p>"I think, however, we had better speak to Leland about it. He
knows we found the key to the vault...Yes, we had better tell
Leland. And there's always the chance that he may have some
explanation that will help us."</p>

<p>When we entered the house Leland was standing in the front hall,
near the stairs. He turned quickly and looked at us uneasily.</p>

<p>"I had to leave the library," he explained, as if his presence
in the hall required an apology. "Tatum started playing the piano.
I am afraid I was a bit rough with him."</p>

<p>"He can endure it, I imagine," Vance murmured. "Anyway, I'm glad
you're here. I wanted to ask you something about Tatum."</p>

<p>He led the way into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Did Tatum, by any chance," he inquired when we were seated,
"accompany Stamm on any of his fishing or treasure-hunting
expeditions?"</p>

<p>Leland looked up slowly, and there was a flicker of astonishment
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Funny you should ask that." His voice, though drab, was pitched
a little higher than usual. "The truth is, Tatum did ship along
with us to Cocos Island&mdash;an uncle of his, I believe, helped
finance the trip. But he could not stick it out. He went all to
pieces in the deadly climate there&mdash;too much alcohol, I
imagine. We tried him on under-sea work for a while, but it was no
go. He was just a burden to the expedition. We finally hailed a
whaler and sent him to Costa Rica, where he picked up a liner back
to the States."</p>

<p>Vance nodded abstractedly and dropped the subject. Slowly he
took his cigarette case from his pocket, chose a
<i>R&eacute;gie</i> with intent deliberation, and lighted it.</p>

<p>"We've been to the Stamm vault, Mr. Leland," he remarked,
without looking up.</p>

<p>Leland glanced at Vance sideways, took his pipe from his mouth,
and said indifferently: "I imagined as much. I have never been
inside it myself. The usual thing, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Quite the usual thing," Vance concurred. He looked up casually
and smoked for a moment. "One or two little points of interest,
however. There was a bit of blood on the floor&mdash;and the
gardenia Greeff wore yesterday. Otherwise quite conventional."</p>

<p>Leland stiffened in his chair and then leaned forward. Presently
he rose to his feet&mdash;it was obvious that he was deeply
perturbed. He stood for several moments, gazing down at the
floor.</p>

<p>"You found nothing else of an unusual nature?" he asked at last
in a strained tone, without lifting his head.</p>

<p>"No," Vance replied, "nothing else. Do you feel that we
overlooked something? There are no hidden nooks, y' know."</p>

<p>Leland glanced up quickly and shook his head with unwonted
vigor.</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not. My query had no significance. I was
merely shocked by what you told me. I cannot imagine what your
discoveries portend."</p>

<p>"Could you not offer some explanation?" Vance asked quietly. "We
would be most grateful for a suggestion."</p>

<p>Leland appeared bewildered.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to suggest," he said, in a low colorless tone.
"I would be only too glad..." His voice trailed off and he stared
again at the floor, as if weighing the possibilities of the
situation.</p>

<p>"By the by," Vance went on, "that creaking noise you heard last
night&mdash;as of one piece of metal against another I believe you
expressed it:&mdash;might that have been the creaking of the iron
hinges of the vault door?"</p>

<p>"It is quite possible," Leland returned, without taking his
troubled gaze from the carpet. Then he added: "The sound certainly
seemed to come from just that point."</p>

<p>Vance studied the man for some time without speaking. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully...I'd like to have a bit of a chat with Tatum.
Would you mind asking him to come here?...Oh, and please don't make
any mention to him&mdash;or to any of the others&mdash;for the
present, of what you have just learned."</p>

<p>Leland moved uneasily, drew himself together, and studied Vance
inquisitively.</p>

<p>"As you wish," he answered, and hesitated. "You found the key to
the vault in Tatum's room:&mdash;do you think, perhaps, it was he
who went to the vault last night?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say," Vance replied coldly.</p>

<p>Leland turned and started from the room; but he halted at the
porti&egrave;res and looked round.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," he asked, "whether you left the vault door
unlocked?"</p>

<p>"I took the precaution of relocking it," Vance informed him, in
an offhand manner. After a slight pause he added: "I have the key
in my pocket. I intend to keep it until this investigation is
brought to a satisfact'ry close."</p>

<p>Leland regarded him for a moment in silence. Then he nodded
slowly.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. I think that is wise." He turned and walked
across the hall toward the library.</p>

<p>When Tatum entered the drawing-room it was obvious that he was
in a sullen, defiant mood. He did not greet any of us, but stood
inside the door, looking us over with smouldering, cynical
eyes.</p>

<p>Vance rose as he entered the room and, moving to the
centre-table, beckoned to him peremptorily. When the man had
swaggered to the table Vance took the vault key from his pocket and
laid it down before the other's gaze.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see that key?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tatum looked at the key with a smirk, studied it for a few
moments, and shrugged.</p>

<p>"No, I never saw it before," he replied flatly. "Any mystery
attached to it?"</p>

<p>"A bit of a mystery," Vance told him, picking up the key and
resuming his seat. "We found it in your room this morning."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's the key to the situation," Tatum sneered, with cold,
half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course...Quite." Vance smiled faintly. "But, as
I've said, it was found in your room."</p>

<p>The man smoked a minute, without moving. Then he raised his hand
and took his cigarette from his lips. (I particularly noted that
his fingers were as steady as steel.)</p>

<p>"What of it?" he asked, with exaggerated indifference. "You will
probably find plenty of junk in the rooms of this rotting old
house." He turned to Vance with a hard mirthless smile which barely
contorted the corners of his mouth. "You know, I don't live
here&mdash;I'm only a guest. Am I supposed to be frightened, or
have the jitters, or go into hysterics, because you found an old
rusty key in my room upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, nothing like that," Vance assured him lightly. "You're
acting in the most highly approved manner."</p>

<p>"Well, where do we go from here?" Tatum's tone was
contemptuous.</p>

<p>"Figuratively speaking, we go to the vault." Vance spoke with
unusual mildness.</p>

<p>Tatum appeared puzzled. "What vault?"</p>

<p>"The ancestral vault of the Stamms."</p>

<p>"And where might that be?"</p>

<p>"Just the other side of the pool, hidden in the spruce trees,
beyond the little cement walk."</p>

<p>Again Tatum's eyes narrowed, and the contours of his face formed
into a rigid defensive mask.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to spoof me?" he asked, in a metallic voice.</p>

<p>"No, no," Vance assured him. "I'm merely answering your
question...I say, don't you know about the vault?"</p>

<p>Tatum shifted his eyes and grinned.</p>

<p>"Never saw it and never heard of it." Suddenly he wheeled round,
crushed out his cigarette, and glared truculently at Vance. "What's
the idea?" he demanded. (His nerves seemed to have snapped.) "Are
you trying to pin something on me?"</p>

<p>Vance studied the man indifferently for a while and then shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Not even a gardenia," he replied sweetly.</p>

<p>Tatum started, and his eyes closed to mere slits.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean by that!" His face paled, and his long
flat fingers began to twitch. "Greeff was wearing a gardenia last
night, wasn't he? Maybe you're going to tell me that you also found
a gardenia in my room."</p>

<p>Vance seemed puzzled for a moment at the man's words, but in an
instant his face cleared.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "the gardenia was not in your room. But really,
y' know, the possible presence of Greeff's posy in your boudoir
shouldn't be so upsetting&mdash;unless, of course, Greeff has met
with foul play."</p>

<p>Another grim, ironic smile moved the muscles of Tatum's
mouth.</p>

<p>"He met with foul play all right&mdash;the same as Montague.
Greeff didn't run away; and there are too many people round here
that would be glad to see him smeared out."</p>

<p>"And you're one of those people, aren't you?" Vance returned
dulcetly.</p>

<p>"Sure I am." Tatum thrust out his jaw, and his eyes became
venomous. "But that doesn't mean that I did it."</p>

<p>"No, that doesn't mean that you did it." Vance rose and waved
his hand in dismissal. "That will be all for the present. But, if I
were you, I would control my musical impulses. Leland might decide
that you too were due for a bit of killin'."</p>

<p>Tatum grinned viciously.</p>

<p>"That half-breed!" And, with an awkward gesture of contempt, he
went from the room.</p>

<p>"A hard-bitten character," Markham commented when the man was
out of hearing.</p>

<p>"True," Vance nodded. "But shrewd."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Markham, rising, and pacing nervously up
and down, "that if we could learn who managed to get the vault key
from old Mrs. Stamm's trunk, we'd know a lot more about the
deviltry that went on here last night."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"I doubt if the key has been in the trunk for years. It may
never have been there, Markham. The hiding of the key, and all the
secrecy, may be just another hallucination on Mrs. Stamm's
part&mdash;an hallucination closely connected with the dragon...
."</p>

<p>"But why, in Heaven's name, was the key in Tatum's room? Tatum
struck me as telling the truth when he said he'd never seen it
before."</p>

<p>Vance gave Markham a quick, curious look.</p>

<p>"The chap was certainly convincing..."</p>

<p>Markham halted and looked down at Vance.</p>

<p>"I can't see any way of tackling this case," he remarked
despondently. "Every factor in it that we try to touch turns out to
be a sort of <i>Fata Morgana.</i> There's nothing tangible to take
hold of. The situation even precludes plausible theorizing."</p>

<p>"Don't give way to discouragement, old dear," Vance consoled
him. "It's not as Cimmerian as it appears. The whole difficulty is
that we've been attacking the problem from a too rational and
ordin'ry point of view. We've been trying to make a conventional
peg fit into a sinister and bizarre hole. There are extr'ordin'ry
elements in this case..."</p>

<p>"Damn it, Vance!" Markham uttered the expletive with unwonted
passion. "You're not reverting to that incredible dragon theory, I
hope."</p>

<p>Before Vance could reply there was the sound of a car swinging
into the parking-space before the house; and a minute later Snitkin
threw open the front door and led Doctor Doremus into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Another body, eh?" the Medical Examiner grumbled, with a casual
wave of the hand in greeting.</p>

<p>"Can't you get all of your corpses together at one time,
Sergeant?...Well, where is it? And what's all the excitement?" He
grinned at Heath with sardonic good-humor. "Your dragon again?"</p>

<p>Vance rose.</p>

<p>"It looks that way," he said soberly.</p>

<p>"What!" Doremus was puzzled. "Well, where's the new victim?"</p>

<p>"In the same pot-hole." Vance took his hat and went into the
hall.</p>

<p>Doremus squinted, and followed without a word.</p>

<p>The Sergeant ordered Snitkin to join us, and once again we drove
round the house and down the East Road. At the pot-holes we stood
back while Doremus looked over the wall into the shallow chasm
beyond. After a cursory glance he slid back to the ground, and
turned to us. There was a strange, startled look on his face: he
had completely lost his cynicism and jauntiness.</p>

<p>"Good Gad! Good Gad!" he repeated. "What kind of a case is
this?" He compressed his lips and made a jerky motion in Heath's
direction. "Get him out," he ordered in a strained tone.</p>

<p>Snitkin and the Sergeant lifted Greeff's body from the pot-hole
and laid it on the ground.</p>

<p>After a brief examination Doremus stood up and looked toward
Markham.</p>

<p>"The same as that fellow yesterday," he said. "Same wounds
exactly. Same fracture of the skull; same three scratches down his
chest; same discoloration on his throat. Ripped wide open, bashed
over the left side of the head, and strangled... Only," he added,
"he hasn't been dead as long as the other one." He made a grimace
at Heath. "That's what you want to know, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"How would twelve o'clock last night fit?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Midnight, eh?" Doremus bent down over Greeff's body and again
tested the <i>rigor mortis.</i> "That'd make it about twelve
hours...Right." He stood up and wrote out a removal blank. As he
handed it to the Sergeant he said: "There was nothing found at the
autopsy of the other fellow that changed what I told you yesterday,
but you'd better get this one down to the morgue right
away&mdash;I'll have time this afternoon to autopsy him." (I had
never seen Doremus so serious.) "And I'm driving back again by
Payson Avenue. I'm getting to believe in that dragon of yours,
Sergeant. ...Damn queer," he muttered, as he walked to the road and
got into his car. "That's no way to kill a man. And two of 'em!...
I saw that stuff in the morning papers about Dragonfish.* Good Gad,
what a story!" He released the brakes, letting his car roll down
the road, and drove off toward Spuyten Duyvil.</p>

<p>* The papers that day had carried spectacular accounts of
Montague's murder; and the reporters had let their imaginations run
riot over the possibilities of an actual aquatic monster having
caused his death. A zoologist from one of the local universities
had been interviewed and had expressed the opinion that such an
explanation could not be scientifically refuted because of our
scant knowledge of submarine life.</p>

<p>Leaving Snitkin to watch Greeff's body, we returned to the
house.</p>

<p>"And now what's to be done?" Markham asked hopelessly, as we
entered the front door.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's clearly indicated, don't y' know," Vance replied.
"I'm going to take a peep at Stamm's fish collection. Really, you'd
better come along. Tropicals are fascinatin', Markham." He turned
to Trainor, who had taken Snitkin's place at the door. "Ask Mr.
Stamm if we may see him."</p>

<p>Trainor glared at Vance fearfully; then drew himself up rigidly
and went down the hall.</p>

<p>"See here, Vance," Markham protested irritably, "what's the
point of this? We have serious work to do, and you talk of
inspecting a fish collection! Two men have been
murdered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Vance interrupted, "that you'll find the fish highly
educational..."</p>

<p>At this moment Stamm came out from the library and strode toward
us.</p>

<p>"Would you be so good as to act as our <i>cicerone,</i> among
your aquaria?" Vance asked him.</p>

<p>Stamm evinced considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said, with an intonation of forced politeness.
"Of course&mdash;of course. I'd be delighted. Come this way." And
he turned and walked back toward the library.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII - PISCATORIAL LORE</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 12.15 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>The library was an unusually large room, severely but
comfortably furnished in the Jacobean style, with great tiers of
books reaching from the floor to the ceiling. There were windows to
the east and west, and, in the north wall, facing us, was a large
archway which led to the aquaria and terrarium beyond.</p>

<p>Leland was sitting on the davenport with one of the volumes of
the Eumorphopoulos collection of ceramics on his knees. In one
corner, at a small card-table, sat Mrs. McAdam and Tatum, a
cribbage board between them. There was no one else in the room. All
three looked up curiously as we entered, but made no comment.</p>

<p>Stamm led the way across the library and into the first
aquarium. This room was even larger than the library, and had an
enormous skylight as well as a row of high windows along both walls
to the east and west. Beyond, through a second archway was still
another aquarium, similar to the first; and beyond that was the
terrarium with windows on three sides.</p>

<p>The aquarium in which we stood was lined with fish tanks of all
sizes, reaching to the base of the high windows; and half-way
between the walls, running the entire length of the room, were two
double rows of additional tanks, set on a long metal rack.</p>

<p>There were more than a hundred such tanks in the room, ranging
in capacity from five to one hundred gallons.</p>

<p>Stamm, beginning at the tank nearest the door, on the left, led
us about the room commenting on his living treasures. He pointed
out the various types of <i>Platyp&oelig;cilus
maculatus</i>&mdash;<i>pulcher, ruber, auratus, sanguineus,</i> and
<i>niger;</i> various <i>Xiphophorus hellerii</i> (the Mexican
Swordtail) and the Red Helleri (a cross between the Swordtail and
the Red Platy); <i>Mollienisia latipinna,</i> with their dotted
mother-of-pearl sides; and Black Mollies, perfectly line-bred to
enhance their original black mottled coloring. His collection of
the genus <i>Barbus</i> was extensive: he had beautiful specimens
of the opalescent red-finned <i>oligolepis;</i> the rosy
<i>conchonius;</i> the <i>lateristriga,</i> with its chameleon-like
golden, black and carmine coloring; the black-banded
<i>pentazona;</i> the silvery <i>ticto;</i> and many others. After
these came the species of the genus <i>Rasbora,</i> especially
<i>heteromorpha</i> and <i>t&aelig;niata;</i> and still further
were beautiful specimens of the Characinid&aelig;, particularly of
the sub-family Tetragonopterin&aelig;&mdash;the Yellow, Red, Glass,
Bronze, and Flag Tetras, and the <i>Hemigrammus ocellifer,</i> or
Head and Tail Light fish.</p>

<p>In a series of tanks down the centre of the room Stamm pointed
with pride to his specimens of the
Cichlid&aelig;&mdash;<i>Cichlasoma facetum, severum,
nigrofasciatum, festivum</i> (the Flag Cichlid), <i>urophthalmus,
aureum,</i> and so on. He also showed us several specimens of that
enigmatical <i>Symphysodon discus,</i> about which so little is
known, either as to its sex distinction or its habits.</p>

<p>"I'm working on this species," Stamm said, proudly indicating
the blue-green brassy specimens. "They are closely related to the
<i>Pterophyllum</i> and are the only one of their genus. I'll
surprise the old-time aquarists yet."</p>

<p>"Have you succeeded in breeding any of the <i>Pterophyllum?</i>"
Vance asked with interest.</p>

<p>Stamm chuckled.</p>

<p>"I was one of the first aquarists in the country to find out
that secret...Look here." He pointed to an enormous tank of at
least one hundred gallons. "That's the explanation. Plenty of
swimming space, with heavy-stemmed Sagittaria for the eggs, and a
good warm temperature." (There were many beautiful specimens in the
tank, some of them twelve inches from dorsal to anal fin.)</p>

<p>He moved along the west wall, talking proudly and fluently of
his fish, with the enthusiasm of a fanatic. Before we had completed
the circuit he had shown us specimens of the <i>&AElig;quidens
portalegrensis</i> (the Blue Acara); tiny transparent glass fish
<i>(Ambassis lala);</i> many species of <i>Panchax,</i> especially
<i>lineatus</i> and the rare Nigerian species, <i>grahami;</i> a
pair of pike-like <i>Belonesox belizanus;</i> the usual <i>Danio
malabaricus;</i> such mouthbreeders as <i>Haplochromis multicolor,
Astatotilapia moffati, Tilapia heudeloti,</i> and <i>Etroplus
maculatus;</i> labyrinthine fishes, such as <i>Osphromenus,
Macropodus, Anabas,</i> and <i>Ctenopoma;</i> and hundreds of
<i>Lebistes reticulatus.</i></p>

<p>Stamm waved his hand at this last large tank contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Scalare fodder," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Still," said Vance, "despite their commonness, there aren't
many fish among the tropicals more beautiful than the Guppies."</p>

<p>Stamm snorted and moved on toward the room beyond.</p>

<p>"In here are the fish that really count," he said.</p>

<p>This second aquarium was similar to the one we had just quitted
and contained quite as many tanks, but they were arranged
differently.</p>

<p>"Here, for instance," said Stamm, standing before a tank at the
right, "is the <i>Monodactylus argenteus."</i></p>

<p>"Brakish water, of course," Vance remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Stamm shot him a curious look. "Many of the tanks in
this room are really marine aquaria, and, of course, I use brakish
water also for my <i>Toxotes jaculator</i>&mdash;the Shooting
Fish&mdash;and the <i>Mugil oligolepis."</i></p>

<p>Vance leaned over the tank that Stamm had indicated.</p>

<p>"The <i>Mugil oligolepis</i> resembles the Barb, but it has two
dorsals instead of one," he observed.</p>

<p>"Quite right." Stamm again looked at him curiously. "You've
spent some time with fish yourself, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've dabbled a bit," returned Vance, moving on.</p>

<p>"Here are some of my best," Stamm said, going to a series of
tanks in the middle of the room. And he pointed out to us some
<i>Colossoma nigripinnis, Mylossoma duriventris,</i> and
<i>Metynnis roosevelti.</i></p>

<p>"How do you manage to keep these rare Characins in such
apparently good condition?" Vance asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's my secret," returned Stamm with a shrewd smile.
"High temperatures, of course, and large tanks and live food...and
other things," he added enigmatically, turning to another series of
tanks along the west wall. "But here are a few fish about which
even less is known." He put his hands in his pockets and regarded
the tanks with satisfaction. "These are the Hatchet Fishes: the
<i>Gasteropelecus sternicla,</i> the <i>Carnegiella strigata,</i>
and the <i>Thoracocharax securis.</i> The so-called experts will
tell you that the breeding habits of these species are not known,
and that they cannot be bred in aquaria. Tommy-rot! I've done it
successfully." He moved further down the room. "Here's an
interesting one." He tapped on the front wall of a particularly
attractive tank. "The Blow Fish&mdash;<i>Tetrodon cucutia.</i>
Watch this."</p>

<p>He took one of the fish out of the water in a small net, and it
inflated itself into the shape of a ball.</p>

<p>"Curious idea," Stamm commented, "&mdash;blowing oneself up to
keep from being swallowed."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite human, I should say," Vance returned dryly. "All our
politicians do the same thing." Stamm grinned.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," he chuckled..."And right next door
here," he went on, "is the <i>Pantodon buchholzi.</i> Just look at
those large transparent pectoral fins. I brought these Butterfly
Fish with me from West Africa...And here are some
beauties&mdash;the <i>Scatophagus</i>." He pointed to two tanks
containing fairly large hexagonal fish&mdash;one tank of the
spotted <i>argus</i> and the other of the striped
<i>rubrifrons.</i> "And just here," Stamm continued, moving along
the wall, "are a couple of <i>Luciocephalus pulcher</i>."</p>

<p>Vance looked at this fish closely and inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I've heard of them," he commented. "They are related to the
Anabantid&aelig;, I believe. But I didn't know any one was versed
in their habits and care."</p>

<p>"No one but me," Stamm boasted. "And I might add that they are
not bubble-nest breeders, as many believe, but
viviparous&mdash;live-bearers."</p>

<p>"Astonishin'," Vance murmured.</p>

<p>Stamm directed our attention to a series of small individual
tanks on the shelf above.</p>

<p>"Piranhas," he said. "A rare species. And savage
devils:&mdash;take a squint at those wicked teeth. I believe these
are the first ever to come to the United States alive. Brought them
back myself from Brazil&mdash;in separate cans, of course: they'd
kill each other if they were put together. Damned
cannibals&mdash;the <i>Serrasalmus.</i> I had a couple that were
nearly twenty inches long,&mdash;not the <i>spilopleura:</i> they
rarely grow over a foot in length...And here," he went on, moving
away, "is a nice collection of Sea-horses&mdash;the <i>Hippocampus
punctulatus.</i> Better than those in the New York Aquarium..."</p>

<p>Stamm moved a little further on.</p>

<p>"Here's an interesting fish&mdash;pugnacious and dangerous. The
<i>Gymnotus carapo.</i> Have to be kept separately. Known as the
'Electric Eel'&mdash;<i>Electrophorus electricus.</i> But that's
all wrong, really. Though they have eel-like bodies, they are not
eels at all, but related to the Characinid&aelig;. These are only
about eight inches long, but they grow to three feet."</p>

<p>Vance looked at the queer specimens closely: they were
vicious-looking and repulsive.</p>

<p>"I have heard," he remarked, "that they are actually capable of
electrocuting a man by a moment'ry contact."</p>

<p>Stamm pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"So they say, so they say."</p>

<p>At this point Tatum and Mrs. McAdam came into the room.</p>

<p>"How about a little battle?" Tatum asked of Stamm with a smirk.
"Teeny and I are bored."</p>

<p>Stamm hesitated.</p>

<p>"I've wasted eight of my biggest Bettas on you now...Oh, all
right."</p>

<p>He went to a wide niche in the east wall, where there were
numerous quart tanks each containing one Siamese Fighting Fish.
From the ceiling hung a globe of water, on three slender chains, at
a height of about five feet from the floor. He took up a small
round Brussels net and transferred two veil-tail fish&mdash;a
beautiful blue-green and a purple one&mdash;to the suspended
globe.</p>

<p>The two fish appeared to look at each other cautiously before
attacking. Then, with brilliantly heightened color and with fins
and tails twitching and spreading furiously, they rushed about.
Coming close together and nearly parallel, they slowly rose, side
by side, to the surface. Soon they seemed to relax, and sank to the
bottom of the globe. These preliminary manoeuvres continued for a
few minutes. Then, with lightning swiftness, the fight was on. They
dashed at each other viciously, ripping off scales, mutilating each
other's tails and fins, and tearing bloody bits from the sides.
Tatum was offering odds on the purple Betta, but no one paid any
attention to him. The blue-green one fastened on the other's gill
with a terrific grip, hanging on until he was compelled to rise to
the surface for air. The other then attached himself savagely to
his antagonist's mouth and relinquished his hold only when forced
to go up for air himself. It was a terrible, but beautiful,
sight.</p>

<p>Vance looked toward Tatum.</p>

<p>"You enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Too tame," Tatum complained, with an unpleasant laugh. "I
prefer cock-fighting myself; but when there's nothing else to do.
..."</p>

<p>Leland had entered the room without our hearing him. He stood
just behind Vance.</p>

<p>"I think it is a brutal sport," he said, his smouldering eyes on
Tatum. "It is beastly."</p>

<p>The purple Betta was now at the bottom of the globe, mutilated
and almost entirely stripped of its scales; and the other was
attacking it to give the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce.</i> Leland quickly
picked up a small net and, reaching into the globe, removed the
wounded loser and placed him in a small tank of Mercurochrome
water. Then he went back to the library.</p>

<p>Tatum shrugged and took Mrs. McAdam's arm.</p>

<p>"Come on, Teeny, we'll play tiddledywinks. I'm sure Leland would
approve of that."</p>

<p>And the two of them left the room.</p>

<p>"A pleasant little household," Stamm remarked with a sneer. He
continued his rounds of the tanks, talking volubly and lovingly of
his rare assortment of fish. That he had a wide and varied
knowledge of them, and that he had done much important
experimentation, was obvious.</p>

<p>When he had come to the farther archway, he offered to show us
his terrarium.</p>

<p>But Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not today," he said. "Thanks awfully, and all that."</p>

<p>"I have some fascinating toads here&mdash;the <i>Alytes
obstetricans</i>&mdash;the first ever to come from Europe," Stamm
urged.</p>

<p>"We'll inspect the Midwives another time," Vance replied. "What
I'm interested in at the moment are your bottled Devil Fish. I see
some allurin' specimens over there."</p>

<p>Below one of the large east windows there were several shelves
lined with jars of strange preserved sea-monsters of varying sizes,
and Stamm led us immediately to them.</p>

<p>"There's a jolly little fellow," he remarked, pointing to a
specimen in a long conical jar. "The <i>Omosudis lowi.</i> Look at
those sabre-like fangs!"</p>

<p>"A typical dragon's mouth," Vance murmured. "But not as vicious
as it looks. A fish one-third its size can conquer and swallow
it&mdash;the <i>Chiasmodon niger,</i> for instance."</p>

<p>"That's right." Once more Stamm glanced sharply at Vance. "Any
implication in that observation?"</p>

<p>"Really now," Vance protested, and pointed to a large glass
receptacle containing a preserved fish of the most hideous and
formidable aspect I had ever seen. "Is this one of the
<i>Chauliodus sloanei?"</i></p>

<p>"Yes, it is," Stamm answered, without shifting his gaze from
Vance. "And I have another one here."</p>

<p>"I believe Greeff did mention two."</p>

<p>"Greeff!" Stamm's face hardened. "Why should he have mentioned
them?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know." Vance moved along the row of bottles.
"And what might this be?"</p>

<p>Stamm turned reluctantly, and glanced at the jar on which Vance
had placed his finger.</p>

<p>"Another so-called Dragonfish," he said. "The <i>Lamprotaxus
flagellibarba</i>." It was a wicked-looking, greenish-black
monster, with blazing emerald markings.</p>

<p>Stamm showed us other specimens: the <i>Idiacanthus
fasciola,</i> a serpent dragon with a long eel-like body, almost
black, and with a golden tail; the wolf-like <i>Linophryne
arborifer</i>, with a very large mouth and strong teeth, and what
appeared to be a fungus-like beard; the <i>Photocorynus
spiniceps</i> which, though very small, possessed a head half the
length of its body, with an enormous jaw and serried teeth; the
<i>Lasiognathus saceostoma,</i> known as the Angler Fish, with a
jaw longer than the rest of its body, and equipped with a line and
hooks for catching its prey; and other repulsive varieties of
luminous Dragonfish. He also showed us a vermilion and yellow
sea-dragon, with what appeared to be a coat of armor and waving
plumes&mdash;a miniature dragon that looked as if it had been
reconstructed from the imaginative pages of mythology...</p>

<p>"A most fascinatin' collection," Vance commented, as he turned
from the jars. "With such an array of Dragonfish round the place,
it's no wonder the old superstition of the pool persists."</p>

<p>Stamm drew up short and scowled: it was patent that Vance's last
remark had upset him. He started to make a reply, but evidently
thought better of it, and walked back toward the inner room without
a word.</p>

<p>As we came again into the library Vance gazed about curiously at
various potted plants in the room.</p>

<p>"I see you have some unusual botanical specimens here," he
remarked.</p>

<p>Stamm nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am not much interested in them. I brought them back
with me on some of my trips, but only for the mater."</p>

<p>"Do they require any special care?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. And many of them have died. Too cold up here for
tropical vegetation, though I keep the library pretty warm, and
there's plenty of sunlight."</p>

<p>Vance paused beside one of the pots and studied it a moment.
Then he moved on to another plant which looked like a dwarf
evergreen but showed many tiny pale yellow berries&mdash;a most
unusual plant.</p>

<p>"What might this be?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. I picked it up in Guam."</p>

<p>Vance walked over to a rather high miniature tree in a large
jardini&egrave;re standing by the davenport on which Leland sat
reading. This tree had large oblong glossy leaves, like the
India-rubber plants that are cultivated in Europe for ornamental
purposes, but these leaves were smaller and broader and seemed more
profuse.</p>

<p>Vance regarded it a moment.</p>

<p><i>"Ficus elastica?</i>" he asked.</p>

<p>"I imagine so," Stamm replied. (It was evident that his interest
lay in fish rather than in plants.) "However, it's a curious
type&mdash;maybe a cross of some kind. And it's undoubtedly
stunted. Moreover, it's never had any pink buds. I got it in Burma
three years ago."</p>

<p>"Amazin' how it has thrived." Vance bent over it closely and
touched the dirt in the jardini&egrave;re with his finger. "Any
special soil required?"</p>

<p>Stamm shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. Any good fertilizer mixed with the earth seems to
suffice."</p>

<p>At this point Leland closed his book. Then, with a sharp look at
Vance, he rose and walked into the aquarium.</p>

<p>Vance drew out his handkerchief and wiped the moist earth from
his finger.</p>

<p>"I think we'll be running along; it's nearly lunch time. We'll
either be back or communicate with you later this afternoon. And
we'll have to impose upon your hospitality a while longer. We do
not want any one to leave here just yet."</p>

<p>"That will be perfectly all right," Stamm returned pleasantly,
going to the hall door with us. "I think I'll rig up a windlass and
get that rock out of the pool this afternoon. A little physical
exercise, you know..." And with a genial wave of the hand he turned
and went back to his beloved fish.</p>

<p>When we had returned to the drawing-room Markham turned on Vance
angrily.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of wasting all that time on fish and plants?"
he demanded. "There's serious work to be done."</p>

<p>Vance nodded soberly.</p>

<p>"I was doing serious work, Markham," he returned, in a low
voice. "And during the last half-hour I've learned many important
things."</p>

<p>Markham scrutinized him a moment and said nothing.</p>

<p>Vance took up his hat.</p>

<p>"Come, old dear. We're through here for the present. I'm taking
you to my apartment for lunch. The Sergeant can carry on till we
return." He addressed Heath who stood by the table, smoking in sour
silence. "By the by, Sergeant, there's something I wish you would
do for me this afternoon."</p>

<p>Heath looked up without change of expression, and Vance went
on:</p>

<p>"Have your men make a thorough search of the grounds in the
vicinity of the pot-holes&mdash;in the bushes and clusters of
trees. I would be jolly well pleased if they could find some sort
of grass-cart, or wheelbarrow, or something of that nature."</p>

<p>Heath's unhappy eyes slowly focused on Vance and became
animated. He took his cigar from his mouth, and a look of
understanding spread over his broad face.</p>

<p>"I get you, sir," he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX - THE DRAGON'S TRACKS</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 1 p. m.</i>)</p>

<p>On our drive to Vance's apartment we were caught in a sudden
thunder-shower. Dark clouds had been gathering in the west for some
time before we left the Stamm estate, though they had not appeared
very menacing, and I thought they would pass us to the south. But
the downpour was terrific, and our car was almost stalled on upper
Broadway. When we reached Vance's apartment, however, a little
before half-past one, the storm had passed over the East River, and
the sun was shining again. We were, in fact, able to have our lunch
on the roof-garden.</p>

<p>During the meal Vance deliberately avoided any discussion of the
case, and Markham, after two or three futile efforts at
conversation, settled into a glum silence.</p>

<p>Shortly after two o'clock Vance rose from the table and
announced that he was leaving us for a few hours.</p>

<p>Markham looked up in exasperated surprise.</p>

<p>"But, Vance," he protested, "we can't let things remain as they
are. We must do something immediately...Must you go? And where are
you going?"</p>

<p>Vance ignored the first question.</p>

<p>"I am going shopping," he returned, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>Markham sprang to his feet resentfully.</p>

<p>"Shopping! What, in the name of Heaven, are you going shopping
for, at such a time?"</p>

<p>Vance turned and gave Markham a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>"For a suit of clothes, old dear," he replied.</p>

<p>Markham spluttered, but before he could articulate his
indignation Vance added:</p>

<p>"I'll phone you at the office later." And with a tantalizing
wave of the hand, he disappeared through the door.</p>

<p>Markham resumed his chair in sullen silence. He finished his
wine, lighted a fresh cigar, and went off to his office in a
taxicab.</p>

<p>I remained at the apartment and tried to catch up on some of my
neglected work. Unable, however, to concentrate on figures and
balances, I returned to the library and began travelling round the
world on Vance's specially built short-wave radio set. I picked up
a beautiful Brahms symphony concert from Berlin. After listening to
the <i>Akademische Fest-Ouverture</i> and the E-minor Symphony, I
tuned off and tried to work out a chess problem that Vance had
recently posed for me.</p>

<p>Vance returned to the apartment a little before four o'clock
that afternoon. He was carrying a moderate-sized package, neatly
wrapped in heavy brown paper, which he placed on the centre-table.
He seemed unduly serious and scarcely nodded to me.</p>

<p>Currie, having heard him, came in and was about to take his hat
and stick, when Vance said:</p>

<p>"Leave them here. I'll be going out again immediately. But you
might put the contents of this package in a small hand-bag for
me."</p>

<p>Currie took the package from the table and went into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>Vance relaxed in his favorite chair in front of the window and
abstractedly lighted one of his <i>R&eacute;gies.</i></p>

<p>"So Markham hasn't shown up yet&mdash;eh, what?" he murmured,
half to himself. "I phoned him from Whitehall Street to meet me
here at four." He glanced at his watch. "He was a bit annoyed with
me over the wire...I do hope he comes. It's most important." He
rose and began pacing up and down the room; and I realized that
something momentous was occupying his thoughts.</p>

<p>Currie came back with the hand-bag and stood at the door,
awaiting orders.</p>

<p>"Take it down-stairs and put it in the tonneau of the car,"
Vance directed, hardly lifting his eyes.</p>

<p>Shortly after Currie had returned, the door-bell rang and Vance
came to an expectant halt.</p>

<p>"That should be Markham," he said.</p>

<p>A few moments later Markham entered the library.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," he announced irritably, without a word of
greeting. "I answered your curt summons, though God knows why."</p>

<p>"Really, y' know," Vance returned placatingly, "I didn't mean to
be curt..."</p>

<p>"Well, did you have any success in getting your suit?" Markham
asked sarcastically, glancing round the room.</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I didn't bring all of the new integuments with
me&mdash;only the shoes and gloves. They're in the car now."</p>

<p>Markham waited without speaking: there was something in Vance's
manner and tone which belied the trivial signification of his
words.</p>

<p>"The truth is, Markham," Vance went on, "I think&mdash;that is,
I hope&mdash;I have found a plausible explanation for the horrors
of the last two days."</p>

<p>"In a new sartorial outfit?" Markham asked, with irony.</p>

<p>Vance inclined his head soberly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Just that&mdash;in a new sartorial outfit...If I am
right, the thing is fiendish beyond words. But there's no other
rational explanation. It's inevitable from a purely academic point
of view. But the problem is to prove, from a practical point of
view, that my theory fits the known facts."</p>

<p>Markham stood by the library table, resting both hands on it and
studying Vance with interrogative sharpness.</p>

<p>"What's the theory&mdash;and what are the facts you've got to
check?"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"The theory can wait," he replied, without looking at Markham.
"And the facts cannot be checked here." He drew himself up, threw
his cigarette into the fireplace, and picked up his hat and stick.
"Come, the car awaits us, old dear," he said, with an effort at
lightness. "We're proceeding to Inwood. And I'd be deuced grateful
if you'd refrain from plying me with leading questions on our way
out."</p>

<p>I shall never forget the ride to the Stamm estate that
afternoon. Nothing was said en route and yet I felt that terrible
and final events were portending. A sense of awe-stricken
excitement pervaded me; and I think that Markham experienced the
same feeling to some degree, for he sat motionless, gazing out of
the car window with eyes that did not focus on any of the immediate
objects we passed.</p>

<p>The weather was almost unbearable. The terrific storm that had
broken over us during our drive to Vance's apartment had neither
cleared nor cooled the atmosphere. There was a sultry haze in the
air and, in addition to the suffocating humidity, the heat seemed
to have increased.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Stamm residence, Detective Burke admitted
us. As we came into the front hall, Heath, who had evidently just
entered through the side door, hurried forward.</p>

<p>"They've taken Greeff's body away," he reported. "And I've kept
the boys busy on the usual routine stuff. But there's no new
information for you. We're up against a blank wall, if you ask
me."</p>

<p>Vance looked at him significantly.</p>

<p>"Nothing else on your mind, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath nodded with a slow grin.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. I was waiting for you to ask me...We found the
wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>"Stout fella!"</p>

<p>"It was in that clump of trees alongside the East Road, about
fifty feet this side of the pot-holes. When I got back Hennessey
told me about it, and I thought I would take a look around. You
know that open sandy space between the Clove and the Bird
Refuge&mdash;well, I went over that ground pretty thoroughly,
knowing what you had in mind, and I found a narrow wheel-track and
a lot of depressions that might easily be footprints. So I guess
you were right, sir."</p>

<p>Markham glanced severely from Heath to Vance.</p>

<p>"Right about what?" he asked, with annoyance.</p>

<p>"One of the details connected with Greeff's death," Vance
answered. "But wait till I check on the things that led up to the
wheelbarrow episode..."</p>

<p>At this moment Leland, with Bernice Stamm at his side, came
through the porti&egrave;res of the drawing-room into the front
hall. He appeared somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Miss Stamm and I could not stand the noise," he explained; "so
we left the others in the library and came to the drawing-room. It
was too sultry outdoors&mdash;the house is more bearable."</p>

<p>Vance appeared to dismiss the other's comments as
unimportant.</p>

<p>"Is everybody in the library now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Every one but Stamm. He has spent most of the afternoon setting
up a windlass on the other side of the pool. He intends to get that
fallen rock out today. He asked me to help him, but it was too hot.
And, anyway, I was not in the mood for that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Where is Stamm now?" Vance asked.</p>

<p>"He has gone down the road, I believe, to get a couple of men to
operate the windlass for him."</p>

<p>Bernice Stamm moved toward the front stairs.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to my room and lie down for a while," she said,
with a curious catch in her voice. Leland's troubled eyes followed
her as she disappeared slowly up the stairs. Then he turned back to
Vance.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance?" he asked. "I probably should have
helped Stamm with the rock, but the fact is there were several
matters I wanted to talk over with Miss Stamm. She is taking this
whole thing far more tragically than she will admit even to
herself. She is really at the breaking-point; and I felt that I
ought to be with her as much as possible."</p>

<p>"Quite so." Vance studied the man penetratingly.</p>

<p>"Has anything else happened here today that would tend to upset
Miss Stamm?"</p>

<p>Leland hesitated. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Her mother sent for me shortly after lunch. She had seen Stamm
go down to the pool, and she implored me rather hysterically to
bring him back to the house. She was somewhat incoherent in her
explanation of why she wanted him here. All I could get out of her
was that there was some danger lurking in the pool for
him,&mdash;the dragon superstition coming back into her mind, no
doubt,&mdash;and after I had a talk with Mrs. Schwarz, I telephoned
Doctor Holliday. He is up-stairs with her now."</p>

<p>Vance kept his eyes on Leland, and did not speak immediately. At
length he said:</p>

<p>"We must ask you to remain here for a while."</p>

<p>Leland looked up and met Vance's gaze.</p>

<p>"I will be on the north terrace&mdash;if you should want me." He
took a deep breath, turned quickly, and walked down the hall.</p>

<p>When he had closed the side door after him, Vance turned to
Burke.</p>

<p>"Stay in the hall here till we return," he instructed the
detective. "And see that no one goes down to the pool."</p>

<p>Burke saluted and moved away toward the stairs.</p>

<p>"Where's Snitkin, Sergeant?" Vance asked.</p>

<p>"After the wagon came for Greeff's body," Heath informed him, "I
told him to wait at the East Road gate."</p>

<p>Vance turned toward the front door.</p>

<p>"That being that, I think we'll hop down to the pool. But we'll
take the car as far as the little cement walk, and approach from
that side."</p>

<p>Markham looked puzzled, but said nothing; and we followed Vance
down the front steps to his car.</p>

<p>We drove down the East Road as far as the gate, picked up
Snitkin, and then backed up to the tree-lined cement walk, where
Vance halted. When we got out of the car Vance reached into the
tonneau and took out the hand-bag that he had directed Currie to
put there. Then he led the way down the walk to the low area of
ground at the northeast corner of the pool. To our left, near the
filter, was a large circular wooden windlass, well anchored in the
ground, and beside it lay a coil of heavy sisal rope. But Stamm,
evidently, had not yet returned.</p>

<p>"Stamm's a neat chap," Vance commented casually, looking at the
windlass. "He's made a pretty good job of that winch. It'll take a
lot of energy, though, to get that rock out of the pool. Good
exercise, however&mdash;excellent for one's psychic balance."</p>

<p>Markham was impatient.</p>

<p>"Did you bring me all the way out here," he asked, "to discuss
the advantages of physical exercise?"</p>

<p>"My dear Markham!" Vance reproved him mildly. Then he added
sombrely: "It may be I've brought you on an even more foolish
errand. And yet&mdash;I wonder..."</p>

<p>We were standing at the end of the cement walk. Vance took up
his hand-bag and started across the fifteen feet or so, which
divided us from the rim of the pool.</p>

<p>"Please stay where you are just a minute," he requested. "I have
a bit of an experiment to make."</p>

<p>He crossed the grass to the muddy bank. When he came within a
few feet of the water, he bent over, placing the hand-bag in front
of him. His body partly shielded it from our view, so that none of
us could quite make out what he was doing with it. This particular
part of the ground, always moist from its direct contact with the
water, was, at this time, unusually soft and yielding, owing to the
heavy downpour of rain early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>From where I stood I could see Vance open the bag before him. He
reached into it and took out something. Then he bent over almost to
the edge of the water, and leaned forward on one hand. After a
moment he drew back; and again I saw him reach into the bag. Once
more he bent forward, and threw all his weight on his extended
hands.</p>

<p>Markham moved a little to one side, in order to get a better
view of Vance's activities; but apparently he was unable to see
what was going on, for he shrugged impatiently, sighed deeply, and
thrust his hands into his pockets with a movement of exasperation.
Both Heath and Snitkin stood looking on placidly, without the
slightest indication of any emotion.</p>

<p>Then I heard the bag snap shut. Vance knelt on it for several
moments, as if inspecting the edge of the pool. Finally he stood up
and placed the bag to one side. He reached in his pocket, took out
a cigarette, and deliberately lighted it. Slowly he turned, looked
at us hesitantly, and beckoned to us to join him.</p>

<p>When we reached him he pointed to the flat surface on the muddy
ground, near the water, and asked in a strained voice:</p>

<p>"What do you see?"</p>

<p>We bent over the small section of ground he had indicated; and
there, in the mud, were outlined two familiar demarcations. One was
like the imprint of a great scaly hoof; and the other resembled the
impression of a three-taloned claw.</p>

<p>Markham was leaning over them curiously.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, Vance! What's the meaning of this? They're like
the marks we saw on the bottom of the pool!"</p>

<p>Heath, his serenity shaken for the moment, shifted his startled
gaze to Vance's face, but made no comment.</p>

<p>Snitkin had already knelt down in the mud and was inspecting the
imprints closely.</p>

<p>"What do you think about them?" Vance asked him.</p>

<p>Snitkin did not reply immediately. He continued his examination
of the two marks. Then he slowly got to his feet and nodded several
times with thoughtful emphasis.</p>

<p>"They're the same as the ones I made copies of," he declared.
"No mistaking 'em, sir." He looked inquiringly at Heath. "But I
didn't see these imprints on the bank when I was making the
drawings."</p>

<p>"They weren't here then," Vance explained. "But I wanted you to
see them, nevertheless&mdash;to make sure they were the same as the
others...I just made these myself."</p>

<p>"How did you make them&mdash;and with what?" Markham demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>"With part of the sartorial outfit I purchased today," Vance
told him. "The new gloves and the new shoes, don't y' know."
Despite his smile his eyes were grave.</p>

<p>He picked up the hand-bag and walked back toward the cement
path.</p>

<p>"Come, Markham," he said, "I'll show you what I mean. But we had
better go back to the car. It's beastly damp here by the pool."</p>

<p>He entered the spacious tonneau, and we did likewise, wondering.
Snitkin stood in the road by the open door, with one foot on the
running-board.</p>

<p>Vance opened the bag and, reaching into it, drew out the most
unusual pair of gloves I had ever seen. They were made of heavy
rubber, with gauntlets extending about six inches above the wrists;
and though they had a division for the thumb, they had only two
broad tapering fingers. They looked like some monster's
three-pronged talons.</p>

<p>"These gloves, Markham," Vance explained, "are technically known
as two-fingered diving mittens. They are the United States Navy
standard pattern, and are constructed in this fashion for
convenience when it is necess'ry to have the use of the fingers
under water. They are adapted to the most difficult types of
submarine work. And it was with one of these gloves that I just
made the mark on the earth there."</p>

<p>Markham was speechless for a moment; then he tore his fascinated
gaze from the gloves and looked up at Vance.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me it was with a pair of gloves like those
that the imprints were made on the bottom of the pool!"</p>

<p>Vance nodded and tossed the gloves back into the bag.</p>

<p>"Yes, they explain the claw-marks of the dragon...And here is
what made the dragon's hoof-prints in the silt of the pool."</p>

<p>Reaching into the bag again, he brought out a pair of enormous,
strange-looking foot-gear. They had heavy solid-brass bottoms with
thick leather tops; and across the instep and the ankle were wide
leather straps, with huge buckles.</p>

<p>"Diving shoes, Markham," Vance remarked. "Also standard
equipment...Look at the corrugations on the metal soles, made to
prevent slipping."</p>

<p>He turned one of the shoes over, and there, etched, in the
brass, were scale-like ridges and grooves, such as are found in the
tread of an automobile tire.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. This revelation of Vance's had
started, in all of us, new processes of speculative thought.
Heath's face was rigid and dour, and Snitkin stood staring at the
shoes with an air of fascinated curiosity. It was Markham who first
roused himself.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed, in a low tone, as if expressing his
feelings aloud, but without reference to any listener. "I'm
beginning to see..." Then he turned his eyes quickly to Vance. "But
what about the suit you were going to get?"</p>

<p>"I saw the suit when I purchased the shoes and gloves," Vance
replied, inspecting his cigarette thoughtfully. "It really wasn't
necess'ry to own it, once I had seen it, and its workability had
been explained to me. But I had to make sure, don't y'
know,&mdash;it was essential to find the missing integers of my
theory. However, I needed the shoes and gloves to experiment with.
I wanted to prove, d' ye see, the existence of the diving
suit."</p>

<p>Markham inclined his head comprehendingly, but there was still a
look of awe and incredulity in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," he murmured. "There's a diving suit and a
similar pair of shoes and gloves somewhere about here... ."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Somewhere hereabouts. And there's also an oxygen
tank..." His voice drifted off, and his eyes became dreamy. "They
must be near at hand," he added, "&mdash;somewhere on the
estate."</p>

<p>"The dragon's outfit!" mumbled Markham, as if following some
inner train of thought.</p>

<p>"Exactly." Vance nodded and threw his cigarette out of the car
window. "And that outfit should be somewhere near the pool. There
wasn't time to carry it away. It couldn't have been taken back to
the house&mdash;that would have been too dangerous. And it couldn't
have been left where it might have been accidentally discovered.
...There was design in these crimes&mdash;a careful plotting of
details. Nothing haphazard, nothing fortuitous&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and, rising quickly, stepped out of the
car.</p>

<p>"Come, Markham! There's a chance!" There was suppressed
excitement in his voice. "By Jove! it's the <i>only</i> chance. The
equipment must be there&mdash;it couldn't be anywhere else. It's a
hideous idea&mdash;gruesome beyond words&mdash;but
maybe...maybe."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX - THE FINAL LINK</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 5 p. m</i>.)</p>

<p>Vance hastened back down the cement walk toward the pool, with
the rest of us close behind him, not knowing where he was leading
us and with only a vague idea of his object. But there was
something in his tone, as well as in his dynamic action, which had
taken a swift and strong hold on all of us. I believe that Markham
and Heath, like myself, felt that the end of this terrible case was
near, and that Vance, through some subtle contact with the truth,
had found the road which led to its culmination.</p>

<p>Half-way down the walk Vance turned into the shrubbery at the
right, motioning us to follow.</p>

<p>"Be careful to keep out of sight of the house," he called over
his shoulder, as he headed for the vault.</p>

<p>When he had reached the great iron door he looked about him
carefully, glanced up at the high cliff, and then, with a swift
movement to his pocket, took out the vault key. Unlocking the door,
he pushed it inward slowly to avoid, I surmised, any unnecessary
noise. For the second time that day we entered the dank close
atmosphere of the old Stamm tomb, and Vance carefully closed the
door. The beam from Heath's flashlight split the darkness, and
Vance took the light from the Sergeant's hand.</p>

<p>"I'll need that for a moment," he explained, and stepped toward
the grim tier of coffins on the right.</p>

<p>Slowly Vance moved the light along those gruesome rows of boxes,
with their corroded bronze fittings and clouded silver name-plates.
He worked systematically, rubbing off the tarnish of the silver
with his free hand, so that he might read the inscriptions. When he
had come to the bottom tier he paused before a particularly old oak
coffin and bent down.</p>

<p>"Slyvanus Anthony Stamm, 1790-1871," he read aloud. He ran the
light along the top of the coffin and touched it at several points
with his fingers. "This should be the one, I think," he murmured.
"There's very little dust on it, and it's the oldest coffin here.
Disintegration of the body will be far advanced and the bone
structure will have crumbled, leaving more room for&mdash;other
things." He turned to Heath. "Sergeant, will you and Snitkin get
this coffin out on the floor. I'd like a peep in it."</p>

<p>Markham, who had stood at one side in the shadows watching Vance
intently and doubtfully, came quickly forward.</p>

<p>"You can't do that, Vance!" he protested. "You can't break into
a private coffin this way. You can be held legally
accountable..."</p>

<p>"This is no time for technicalities, Markham," Vance returned in
a bitter, imperious voice..."Come, Sergeant. Are you with me?"</p>

<p>Heath stepped forward without hesitation. "I'm with you, sir,"
he said resolutely. "I think I know what we're going to find."</p>

<p>Markham looked squarely at Vance a moment; then moved aside and
turned his back. Knowing what this unspoken acquiescence on
Markham's part meant to a man of his precise and conventional
nature, I felt a great wave of admiration for him.</p>

<p>The coffin was moved from its rack to the floor of the vault,
and Vance bent over the lid.</p>

<p>"Ah! The screws are gone." He took hold of the lid, and with but
little effort it slid aside.</p>

<p>With the Sergeant's help the heavy top was removed. Beneath was
the inner casket. The lid of this was also loose, and Vance easily
lifted it off and placed it on the floor. Then he played the
flashlight on the interior of the casket.</p>

<p>At first I thought the thing I saw was some unearthly creature
with a huge head and a tapering body, like some illustrations I had
seen of Martians. I drew in an involuntary, audible breath: I was
shocked and, at the same time, frightened. More monsters! My one
instinct was to rush out into the clean sunlight, away from such a
hideous and terrifying sight.</p>

<p>"That's a duplicate of the suit I saw today, Markham," came
Vance's steadying, matter-of-fact voice. He played his light down
upon it. "A shallow-water diving suit&mdash;the kind used largely
in pearl-fishing. There's the three-light screw helmet with its
hinged face-plate...And there's the one-piece United States Navy
diving dress of rubberized canvas." He bent over and touched the
gray material. "Yes, yes, of course&mdash;cut down the front. That
was for getting out of it quickly without unscrewing the helmet and
unlacing the backs of the legs." He reached into the casket
alongside the diving suit and drew forth two rubber gloves and a
pair of brass-soled shoes. "And here are duplicates of the shoes
and gloves I brought here with me." (They were both caked with
dried mud.) "These are what made the dragon's imprints on the
bottom of the pool."</p>

<p>Markham was gazing down into the casket, like a man stunned by a
sudden and awe-inspiring revelation.</p>

<p>"And hidden in that coffin!" he muttered, as if to himself.</p>

<p>"Apparently the one safe place on the estate," Vance nodded.
"And this particular coffin was chosen because of its age. There
would be little more than bones left, after all these years; and
with a slight pressure the frame of the chest walls would have
caved in, making space for the safe disposal of this outfit." Vance
paused a moment, and then went on: "This type of suit, d' ye see,
doesn't require an air pump and hose connection. An oxygen tank can
be clamped to the breast-plate and attached to the intake-valve of
the helmet...See this?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the foot of the casket, and I saw, for the first
time, lying on the bottom, a metal cylinder about eighteen inches
long.</p>

<p>"That's the tank. It can be placed horizontally across the
breast-plate, without interfering with the operations of the
diver."</p>

<p>As he started to lift out the oxygen tank we heard a clinking
sound, as if the tank had come in contact with another piece of
metal.</p>

<p>Vance's face became suddenly animated.</p>

<p>"Ah! I wonder..."</p>

<p>He moved the tank to one side and reached down into the depths
of that ancient coffin. When his hand came out he was holding a
vicious-looking grappling-iron. It was fully two feet long and at
one end were three sharp steel hooks. For a moment I did not grasp
the significance of this discovery; but when Vance touched the
prongs with his finger I saw that they were clotted with blood, and
the horrible truth swept over me.</p>

<p>Holding the grappling-iron toward Markham, he said in a
curiously hushed voice:</p>

<p>"The dragon's claws&mdash;the same that tore Montague's
breast&mdash;and Greeff's."</p>

<p>Markham's fascinated eyes clung to the deadly instrument.</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;I don't quite see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This grapnel was the one missing factor in the hideous
problem," Vance interrupted. "Not that it would have mattered
greatly, once we had found the diving suit and had explained the
imprints in the pool. But it does clarify the situation, don't y'
know."</p>

<p>He tossed the iron back into the casket and replaced the cover.
At a sign from him Heath and Snitkin lifted the heavy oak lid back
to the coffin and returned the ancient box, with its terrible and
revelatory contents, to its original position on the lower
tier.</p>

<p>"We're through here&mdash;for the present, at any rate," Vance
said, as we passed out into the sunlight. He locked the door of the
vault and dropped the key back into his pocket. "We had better be
returning to the house, now that we have the solution to the
crimes..."</p>

<p>He paused to light a cigarette; then looked grimly at the
District Attorney.</p>

<p>"Y' see, Markham," he said, "there was, after all, a dragon
involved in the case&mdash;a fiendish and resourceful dragon. He
had vengeance and hate and ruthlessness in his heart. He could live
under water, and he had talons of steel with which to tear his
victims. But, above all, he had the shrewd calculating mind of
man&mdash;and when the mind of man becomes perverted and cruel it
is more vicious than that of any other creature on earth."</p>

<p>Markham nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to understand. But there are too many things that
need explaining."</p>

<p>"I think I can explain them all," Vance replied, "now that the
basic pattern is complete."</p>

<p>Heath was scowling deeply, watching Vance with a look which
combined skepticism with admiration.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't mind, Mr. Vance," he said apologetically,
"I'd like you to explain one thing to me right now.&mdash;How did
the fellow in the diving suit get out of the pool without leaving
footprints? You're not going to tell me he had wings, too, are
you?"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant." Vance waved his hand toward the pile of lumber
beside the vault. "There's the answer. The point bothered me too
until this afternoon; but knowing he could have left the pool only
by walking, I realized that there must inevitably be a simple and
rational explanation for the absence of footprints&mdash;especially
when I knew that he was weighted down and wearing heavy diving
shoes. When I approached the vault a few minutes ago, the truth
suddenly dawned on me." He smiled faintly. "We should have seen it
long ago, for we ourselves demonstrated the method by doing exactly
the same thing when we walked out over the bottom of the pool. The
murderer placed one of these boards between the end of the cement
walk and the edge of the pool,&mdash;the width of that stretch of
flat ground is little more than the length of the timber. Then,
when he had walked out of the pool over the board, he simply
carried it back and threw it on the pile of lumber from which he
had taken it."</p>

<p>"Sure!" Heath agreed with a kind of shamefaced satisfaction.
"That's what made that mark on the grass that looked like a heavy
suit-case had been set there."</p>

<p>"Quite right," nodded Vance. "It was merely the indentation made
by one end of the heavy plank when the chappie in the diving suit
stepped on it..."</p>

<p>Markham, who had been listening closely, interrupted.</p>

<p>"The technical details of the crime are all very well, Vance,
but what of the person who perpetrated these hideous acts? We
should make some definite move immediately."</p>

<p>Vance looked up at him sadly and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not immediately, Markham," he said. "The thing is
too obscure and complicated. There are too many unresolved factors
in it&mdash;too many things to be considered. We have caught no one
red-handed; and we must, therefore, avoid precipitancy in making an
arrest. Otherwise, our entire case will collapse. It's one thing to
know who the culprit is and how the crimes were committed, but it's
quite another thing to prove the culprit's guilt."</p>

<p>"How do you suggest that we go about it?"</p>

<p>Vance thought a moment before answering. Then he said:</p>

<p>"It's a delicate matter. Perhaps it would be wise to make subtle
suggestions and bold innuendos that may bring forth the very
admission that we need. But certainly we must not take any direct
action too quickly. We must discuss the situation before making a
decision. We have hours ahead of us till nightfall." He glanced at
his watch. "We had better be going back to the house. We can settle
the matter there and decide on the best course to pursue."</p>

<p>Markham acquiesced with a nod, and we set off through the
shrubbery toward the car.</p>

<p>As we came out into the East Road a car drove up from the
direction of Spuyten Duyvil, and Stamm and two other men who looked
like workers got out and approached us.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" Stamm asked. And then, without waiting for an
answer, he said: "I'm going down to get that rock out of the
pool."</p>

<p>"We have some news for you," Vance said, "&mdash;but not here.
When you've finished the job," he suggested, "come up to the house.
We'll be there."</p>

<p>Stamm lifted his eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. It'll take me only an hour or so." And he turned
and disappeared down the cement path, the two workmen following
him.</p>

<p>We drove quickly to the house. Vance, instead of entering at the
front door, walked directly round the north side of the house, to
the terrace overlooking the pool.</p>

<p>Leland was seated in a large wicker chair, smoking placidly and
gazing out at the cliffs opposite. He barely greeted us as we came
forward, and Vance, pausing only to light a fresh cigarette, sat
down beside him.</p>

<p>"The game's up, Leland," he said in a tone which, for all its
casualness, was both firm and grim. "We know the truth."</p>

<p>Leland's expression did not change.</p>

<p>"What truth?" he asked, almost as if he felt no curiosity about
the matter.</p>

<p>"The truth about the murders of Montague and Greeff."</p>

<p>"I rather suspected you would find it out," he returned calmly.
(I was amazed at the man's self-control.) "I saw you down at the
pool a while ago. I imagine I know what you were doing there...You
have visited the vault also?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Vance admitted. "We inspected the coffin of Sylvanus
Anthony Stamm. We found the diving equipment in it&mdash;and the
three-pronged grappling-iron."</p>

<p>"And the oxygen tank?" Leland asked, without shifting his eyes
from the cliffs beyond.</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, the tank too.&mdash;The whole procedure is quite clear
now. Everything about the crimes, I believe, is explained."</p>

<p>Leland bowed his head, and with trembling fingers attempted to
repack his pipe.</p>

<p>"In a way, I am glad," he said, in a very low voice. "Perhaps it
is better&mdash;for every one."</p>

<p>Vance regarded the man with a look closely akin to pity.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I don't entirely understand, Mr. Leland," he
said at length. "Why did you telephone the Homicide Bureau after
Montague's disappearance? You only planted the seed of suspicion of
foul play, when the episode might have passed as an accident."</p>

<p>Leland turned his head slowly, frowned, and appeared to weigh
the question that Vance had put to him. Finally he shook his head
despondently.</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;exactly&mdash;why I did that," he
replied.</p>

<p>Vance's penetrating eyes held the man's gaze for a brief space
of time. Then he asked:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it, Mr. Leland?"</p>

<p>Leland glanced down at his pipe, fumbled with it for a moment,
and then rose.</p>

<p>"I think I had better go up-stairs to Miss Stamm&mdash;if you
don't mind. It might be best if it were I who told her." Vance
nodded. "I believe you are right."</p>

<p>Leland had scarcely entered the house and closed the door when
Markham sprang to his feet and started after him; but Vance stepped
up quickly and put a firm restraining hand on the District
Attorney's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Markham," he said, with grim and commanding
insistence.</p>

<p>"But you can't do this thing, Vance!" Markham protested, trying
to throw off the other's hold. "You have no right to contravene
justice this way. You've done it before&mdash;and it was
outrageous!"*</p>

<p>* Markham, I believe, was referring to the opportunity that
Vance had given the murderer in "The 'Canary' Murder Case" to
commit suicide after he had admitted his guilt.</p>

<p>"Please believe me, Markham," Vance returned sternly, "it's the
best thing." Then his eyes opened wide, and a look of astonishment
came into them. "Oh, my word!" he said. "You don't yet
understand...Wait&mdash;wait." And he forced Markham back into his
chair.</p>

<p>A moment later Stamm, in his bathing suit, emerged from one of
the <i>caba&ntilde;as</i> and crossed the coping of the filter to
the windlass beyond. The two men he had brought with him from
Spuyten Duyvil had already attached the rope to the drum and stood
at the hand-cranks, awaiting Stamm's orders. Stamm picked up the
loose end of the coiled rope and, throwing it over his shoulder,
waded into the shallow water along the foot of the cliff until he
came to the submerged rock. We watched him for some time looping
the rope over the rock and endeavoring to dislodge it with the
assistance of the men operating the winch. Twice the rope slipped,
and once a stake anchoring the winch was dislodged.</p>

<p>It was while the men were repairing this stake that Leland
returned softly to the terrace and sat down again beside Vance. His
face was pale and set, and a great sadness had come into his eyes.
Markham, who had started slightly when Leland appeared, now sat
looking at him curiously. Leland's eyes moved indifferently toward
the pool where Stamm was struggling with the heavy rope.</p>

<p>"Bernice has suspected the truth all along," Leland remarked to
Vance, in a voice barely above a whisper..."I think, though," he
added, "she feels better, now that you gentlemen understand
everything...She is very brave..."</p>

<p>Across the sinister waters of the Dragon Pool, there came to us
a curious rumbling and crackling sound, like sharp, distant
thunder. As I instinctively glanced toward the cliffs I saw the
entire pinnacle of the rocky projection we had examined the day
before, topple and slide downward toward the spot where Stamm was
standing breast-deep in the water.</p>

<p>The whole terrible episode happened so quickly that the details
of it are, even today, somewhat confused in my mind. But as the
great mass of rock slid down the cliff, a shower of small stones in
its wake, I caught a fleeting picture of Stamm glancing upward and
then striving frantically to get out of the path of the crashing
boulder, which the rainstorm earlier in the afternoon must have
loosened. But his arms had become entangled in the rope which he
was attempting to fasten about the rock in the pool, and he was
unable to disengage himself. I got a momentary glimpse of his
panic-stricken face just before the great mass of rock caught him
and pinned him beneath the waters.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the terrific splash, a fearful, hysterical
shriek rang out from the balcony high above our heads; and I knew
that old Mrs. Stamm had witnessed the tragedy.</p>

<p>We all sat in stunned silence for several seconds. Then I was
conscious of Leland's soft voice.</p>

<p>"A merciful death," he commented.</p>

<p>Vance took a long, deep inhalation on his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Merciful&mdash;and just," he said.</p>

<p>The two men at the windlass had entered the water and were
wading rapidly toward the place where Stamm had been buried; but it
was only too obvious that their efforts would be futile. The great
mass of rock had caught Stamm squarely, and there could be no hope
of rescue.</p>

<p>The first sudden shock of the catastrophe past, we rose to our
feet, almost with one accord. It was then that the hall door opened
and Doctor Holliday, pale and upset, lumbered out on the
terrace.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Mr. Leland." He hesitated, as if he did not
know exactly how to proceed. Then he blurted out:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stamm's dead. Sudden shock&mdash;she saw it happen. You
had better break the news to her daughter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI - THE END OF THE CASE</h2>

<p>(<i>Monday, August 13; 10 p. m</i>.)</p>

<p>Late that night Markham and Heath and I were sitting with Vance
on his roof-garden, drinking champagne and smoking.</p>

<p>We had remained at the Stamm estate only a short time after
Stamm's death. Heath had stayed on to supervise the detail work
which closed the case. The pool had been drained again, and Stamm's
body had been taken from beneath the rock boulder. It was mutilated
beyond recognition. Leland, with Miss Stamm's assistance, had taken
charge of all the domestic affairs.</p>

<p>Vance and Markham and I had not finished dinner until nearly ten
o'clock, and shortly afterward Sergeant Heath joined us. It was
still hot and sultry, and Vance had produced a bottle of his 1904
Pol Roger.</p>

<p>"An amazin' crime," he remarked, lying back lethargically in his
chair. "Amazin'&mdash;and yet simple and rational."</p>

<p>"That may be true," Markham returned. "But there are many
details of it which are still obscure to me."</p>

<p>"Once its basic scheme is clear," Vance said, "the various
shapes and colors of the mosaic take their places almost
automatically."</p>

<p>He emptied his glass of champagne.</p>

<p>"It was easy enough for Stamm to plan and execute the first
murder. He brought together a house-party of warring elements, on
any member of which suspicion might fall if criminality were proved
in connection with Montague's disappearance. He felt sure his
guests would go swimming in the pool and that Montague, with his
colossal vanity, would take the first dive. He deliberately
encouraged the heavy drinking, and he himself pretended to
overindulge. But as a matter of fact, he was the only member of the
party, with the possible exception of Leland and Miss Stamm, who
did no drinking."</p>

<p>"But Vance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. He gave the appearance of having drunk heavily all
day. But that was only part of his plan. He was probably never more
sober in his life than when the rest of the party left the house
for the swimming pool. During the entire evening he sat on the
davenport in the library, and surreptitiously poured his liquor
into the jardini&egrave;re holding the rubber-plant."</p>

<p>Markham looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"That was why you were so interested in the soil of that
plant?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Stamm had probably emptied two quarts of whisky into
the pot. I took up a good bit of the soil on my finger; and it was
well saturated with alcohol."</p>

<p>"But Doctor Holliday's report&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Stamm was actually in a state of acute alcoholism when the
doctor examined him. You remember the quart of Scotch he ordered
from Trainor, just before the others went down to the pool. When he
himself came back to the library, after the murder, he undoubtedly
drank the entire bottle; and when Leland found him his state of
alcoholic collapse was quite genuine. Thus he gave the whole affair
an air of verisimilitude."</p>

<p>Vance lifted the champagne from the wine cooler and poured
himself another glass. When he had taken a few sips he lay back
again in his chair.</p>

<p>"What Stamm did," he continued, "was to hide his diving outfit
and the grapnel in his car in the garage earlier in the day. Then,
feigning a state of almost complete drunken insensibility, he
waited till every one had gone to the pool. Immediately he went to
the garage, and drove&mdash;or perhaps coasted&mdash;down the East
Road to the little cement path. He donned his diving suit, which he
put on over his dinner clothes, and attached the oxygen
tank&mdash;a matter of but a few minutes. Then he put the board in
place, and entered the pool. He was reasonably sure that Montague
would take the first dive; and he was able to select almost the
exact spot in the pool toward which Montague would head. He had his
grapnel with him, so that he could reach out in any direction and
get his victim. The water in the pool is quite clear and the
flood-lights would give him a good view of Montague. The technique
of the crime for an experienced diver like Stamm was dashed
simple."</p>

<p>Vance made a slight gesture with his hand.</p>

<p>"There can be little doubt as to exactly what happened. Montague
took his dive, and Stamm, standing on the sloping basin opposite
the deep channel, simply hooked him with the
grappling-iron&mdash;which accounts for the wounds on Montague's
chest. The force of the dive, I imagine, drove Montague's head
violently against the metal oxygen tank clamped to the breast-plate
of Stamm's helmet, and fractured his skull. With his victim stunned
and perhaps unconscious, Stamm proceeded to choke him under the
water until he was quite limp. It was no great effort for Stamm to
drag him to the car and throw him in. Next Stamm replaced the
board, doffed his diving suit, hid it in the old coffin in the
vault, and drove to the pot-holes, where he dumped Montague's body.
Montague's broken bones were the result of the rough way in which
Stamm chucked him into the rock pit; and the abrasions on his feet
were undoubtedly caused by Stamm's dragging him over the cement
walk to the parked car. Afterward Stamm drove the car back to the
garage, returned cautiously to the library, and proceeded to
consume the quart of whisky."</p>

<p>Vance took a long inhalation on his cigarette, exhaling the
smoke slowly.</p>

<p>"It was an almost perfect alibi."</p>

<p>"But the time element, Vance&mdash;" Markham began.</p>

<p>"Stamm had plenty of time. At least fifteen minutes elapsed
before the others had changed to their bathing suits; and this was
twice as much time as Stamm required to coast down the hill in his
car, slip into his diving suit, put the piece of lumber in place,
and station himself in the pool. And, certainly, it took him not
more than fifteen minutes, at the most, to replace the board, hide
his diving suit, deposit his victim in the pot-hole, and return to
the house."</p>

<p>"But he was taking a desperate chance," Markham commented.</p>

<p>"On the contr'ry, he was taking no chance at all. If his
calculations worked out successfully, there was no way in which the
plot could go awry. Stamm had all the time necess'ry; he had the
equipment; and he was working out of sight of any possible
witnesses. If Montague had not dived into the pool, as was his
custom, it would have meant only that the murder would have to be
postponed. In that case Stamm would simply have walked out of the
pool, returned to the house, and bided his time."</p>

<p>Vance frowned wistfully and turned his head lazily toward
Markham.</p>

<p>"There was, however, one fatal error in the calculations," he
said. "Stamm was too cautious&mdash;he lacked boldness: he covered
his gamble, as it were. As I have said, in planning the house-party
he invited persons who had reason to want Montague out of the way,
his idea being to supply the authorities with suspects in the event
his scheme did not work out. But, in doing so, he overlooked the
fact that some of these very people were familiar with diving
apparatus and with his own under-sea work in the
tropics&mdash;people who, having this information, might have
figured out how the murder was committed, provided the body was
found..."</p>

<p>"You mean," asked Markham, "that you think Leland saw through
the plot from the first?"</p>

<p>"There can be little doubt," Vance returned, "that when Montague
failed to come up from his dive, Leland strongly suspected that
Stamm had committed a crime. Naturally, he was torn between his
sense of justice and fair play, on the one hand, and his love for
Bernice Stamm, on the other. My word, what a predicament! He
compromised by telephoning to the Homicide Bureau and insisting
that an investigation be instigated. He wouldn't definitely expose
or accuse the brother of the woman he loved. But, as an honorable
man, he couldn't bring himself to countenance what he believed to
be deliberate murder. Y' know, Markham, he was infinitely relieved
when I told him this afternoon that I knew the truth. But meanwhile
the man had suffered no end."</p>

<p>"Do you think any one else suspected?" Markham asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Bernice Stamm suspected the truth&mdash;Leland himself
told us so this afternoon. That's why the Sergeant, when he first
saw her, got the impression she was not primarily worried about
Montague's disappearance.&mdash;And I feel pretty sure that Tatum
also guessed the truth. Don't forget, he had been on the trip to
Cocos Island with Stamm and was familiar with the possibilities of
diving suits. But the present situation no doubt seemed a bit
fantastic to him, and he couldn't voice his suspicion because there
was apparently no way of proving it.&mdash;And Greeff, too, having
helped to equip some of Stamm's expeditions, undoubtedly had a
fairly accurate idea as to what had happened to Montague."</p>

<p>"And the others also?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"No, I doubt if either Mrs. McAdam or Ruby Steele really
suspected the truth; but I think both of them felt that something
was wrong. Ruby Steele was attracted by Montague&mdash;which
accounts, perversely, for the antagonism between them. And she was
jealous of Bernice Stamm as well as of Teeny McAdam. When Montague
disappeared, I have no doubt the idea of foul play did enter her
mind. That's why she accused Leland: she hated him because of his
superiority."</p>

<p>Vance paused a moment and went on.</p>

<p>"Mrs. McAdam's mental reactions in the matter were a bit
subtler. I doubt if she entirely understood her own emotions.
Unquestionably, however, she too suspected foul play. Although the
fact that Montague had faded from the scene would have favored her
personal ends, I imagine she had some lingerin' sentiment for the
chap, and that's why she handed us Greeff and Leland as
possibilities&mdash;both of whom she disliked. And I imagine also
that her scream was purely emotional, while her later indifference
indicated the dominance of her scheming mind over her heart. The
horror of the possibility of Montague's having been murdered
accounted for her violent reaction when I told her of the splash in
the pool: she pictured terrible things happening to him. The old
feminine heart at work again, Markham."</p>

<p>There were several moments of silence. Then Markham said, almost
inaudibly, as if stating to himself some point in a train of
thought:</p>

<p>"And of course the car that Leland and Greeff and Miss Stamm
heard was Stamm's."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," Vance returned. "The time element fitted
exactly."</p>

<p>Markham nodded, but there was a troubled reservation in his
frown.</p>

<p>"But still," he said, "there was that note from the Bruett
woman."</p>

<p>"My dear Markham! There's no such person. Stamm created Ellen
Bruett to account for Montague's disappearance. He was hoping that
the whole affair would simply blow over as a commonplace elopement.
He wrote the rendezvous note himself, and put it in Montague's
pocket after he returned from the pool that night. And you remember
that he indicated where we could find it, when he opened the
clothes-closet door. A clever ruse, Markham; and the sound of the
car on the East Road bore out the theory, though Stamm probably
didn't take the sound of the car into consideration at all."</p>

<p>"No wonder my men couldn't find any trace of the dame," grumbled
the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Markham was gazing at his cigar with a thoughtful abstracted
look.</p>

<p>"I can understand the Bruett factor," he remarked at length;
"but how do you account for Mrs. Stamm's uncannily accurate
prophecies?"</p>

<p>Vance smiled mildly.</p>

<p>"They were not prophecies, Markham," he replied, with a sad note
in his voice. "They were all based on real knowledge of what was
going on, and were the pathetic attempts of an old woman to protect
her son. What Mrs. Stamm didn't actually see from her window, she
probably suspected; and nearly everything she said to us was
deliberately calculated to divert us from the truth. That's why she
sent for us at the outset."</p>

<p>Vance drew deeply on his cigarette again, and looked out
wistfully over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"Much of her talk about the dragon was insincere, although there
is no question that the hallucination concerning the dragon in the
pool had taken a powerful hold on her weakened mind. And this
partial belief in the existence of a water-monster formed the basis
of her defense of Stamm. We don't know how much she saw from her
window. Personally, I think she felt instinctively that Stamm had
plotted the murder of Montague, and I also think that she heard the
car going down the East Road and suspected what its errand was.
When she listened at the top of the stairs that first night and
heard Stamm protesting, the shock produced by the realization of
her fears caused her to scream and to send for us later to tell us
that no one in the house was guilty of any crime."</p>

<p>Vance sighed.</p>

<p>"It was a tragic effort, Markham; and all her other efforts to
mislead us were equally tragic. She attempted to build up the
dragon hypothesis because she herself was not quite rational on the
subject. Moreover, she knew Stamm would take the body away and hide
it&mdash;which accounts for her seeming prophecy that the body
would not be found in the pool. And she was able to figure out
where Stamm would hide the body&mdash;in fact, she may even have
been able to tell, from the sound, approximately how far down the
road Stamm drove the car before returning to the garage. When she
screamed at the time the pool was emptied, she was simply making a
dramatic gesture to emphasize her theory that the dragon had flown
off with Montague's body."</p>

<p>Vance stretched his legs and settled even deeper into his
chair.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stamm's prognostications of the second tragedy were merely
another effort toward foisting the dragon theory upon us. She
undoubtedly suspected that her son, having succeeded in murdering
Montague, would, if the opportunity presented itself, also put
Greeff out of the way. I imagine she knew all about Greeff's
financial plottings, and sensed Stamm's hatred for him. She may
even have seen, or heard, her son and Greeff go down toward the
pool last night and have anticipated the terrible thing that was
going to happen. You recall how frantically she endeavored to
bolster up her theory of the dragon when she heard of Greeff's
disappearance. I had a suspicion then that she knew more than she
would admit. That was why I went directly to the potholes to see if
Greeff's body was there...Oh, yes, that tortured old woman knew of
her son's guilt. When she begged Leland to bring him back into the
house this afternoon, saying that some danger was lurking in the
pool, it wasn't a premonition. It was only her instinctive fear
that some retribution might overtake her son at the scene of his
crimes."</p>

<p>"And it did overtake him," mumbled Markham. "A curious
coincidence."</p>

<p>"He sure had it coming to him," put in the practical Sergeant.
"But what gets me is the trouble he took to avoid leaving
footprints."</p>

<p>"Stamm had to protect himself, Sergeant," Vance explained. "Any
noticeable imprints of his diving shoes would have given away the
entire plot. Therefore, he took the precaution of placing a board
over that patch of ground."</p>

<p>"But he took no precaution against his footprints on the bottom
of the pool," Markham submitted.</p>

<p>"True," Vance returned. "It had not occurred to him, I imagine,
that the imprints he made under the water would remain; for he was
certainly a frightened man when the marks of his diving shoes came
to light: he was afraid they would be recognized for what they
were. I admit that the truth did not occur to me at the time. But,
later, a suspicion of the truth dawned on me; and that is why I
wished to verify my theory by searching for a diving suit and shoes
and gloves. There are but few companies that make standard diving
equipment in this country, and I had little trouble in locating the
firm from which Stamm had acquired his outfit."</p>

<p>"But what about Leland?" Markham asked. "Surely he would have
recognized the tracks."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure. In fact, the moment I mentioned those strange
tracks to him, he suspected immediately how they had been made; and
when he saw Snitkin's drawings he knew the truth. I think he rather
hoped that we also would see it, although he could not bring
himself to tell us directly because of his loyalty to Bernice
Stamm. Miss Stamm herself suspected the truth&mdash;you recall how
upset she was when I mentioned the queer footprints to her. And
Mrs. Stamm, too, knew the significance of those imprints when she
heard of them. But she very cleverly turned them to her own purpose
and used them to support the theory of the dragon that she was
endeavorin' to instil in us."</p>

<p>Markham filled his glass.</p>

<p>"That part of it is all clear," he said, after a short silence.
"But there are certain points connected with Greeff's murder that I
don't yet understand."</p>

<p>Vance did not speak at once. First he lighted a fresh cigarette
slowly and meditatively. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I can't make up my mind, Markham, whether Greeff's murder was
planned for this particular week-end, or was suddenly decided on.
But the possibility unquestionably was at the back of Stamm's mind
when he planned the party. There can be no doubt that he detested
Greeff and also feared him; and, with his perverted mind, he saw no
way of eliminating the menace presented by Greeff except through
murder. What led Stamm to his decision to do away with Greeff last
night was undoubtedly the amazin' amount of dragon talk that
followed the finding of the imprints on the bottom of the pool, and
the claw-like tears down Montague's chest. He saw no reason why he
should not continue to build up this outlandish theory of the
dragon. As long as the circumstances of Montague's death appeared
entirely irrational and fantastic, Stamm, no doubt, felt safe from
apprehension; and in this state of false security, he sought to
repeat the irrationality of Montague's death in Greeff's murder. He
argued, I imagine, that if he were safe from suspicion as a result
of the dragonish implications in Montague's murder, he would be
equally safe from suspicion if Greeff were disposed of in a similar
manner. That's why he duplicated the technique so carefully. He
struck Greeff over the head to make a wound similar to the one on
Montague. He then strangled Greeff, in order to reproduce the
throat marks; and, that accomplished, he used the grapnel on
Greeff's chest, thus reproducing the supposed dragon's claw-marks.
He then carried the murder to its logical extreme&mdash;or, rather,
to its <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&mdash;by chucking the fellow
into the pot-hole."</p>

<p>"I can see how his mind was working," Markham admitted. "But in
Greeff's case he had to create the opportunity for the crime."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But that wasn't difficult. After Stamm's vicious
outburst Saturday night, Greeff was only too glad to accept the
reconciliation Stamm offered him last night in the library. You
recall that Leland told us they sat for hours talking amicably
before retiring. What they probably talked about was the prospect
of a new expedition, and Greeff was delighted to be able to offer
his help. Then, when they had gone up-stairs, Stamm undoubtedly
invited Greeff into his own room for a last drink, later suggesting
that they go for a walk to continue the discussion; and the two
went out together. It was at that time that both Leland and Trainor
heard the side door being unbolted."</p>

<p>Vance again sipped his champagne.</p>

<p>"How Stamm inveigled Greeff into the vault is something we'll
never know. However, it's a point of no importance, for certainly
Greeff was in a frame of mind to acquiesce in any suggestion Stamm
might have made. Stamm may have told Greeff that he was able to
explain Montague's death if the other would go into the vault with
him. Or, it may have been a more commonplace invitation&mdash;the
expression of a desire to inspect the masonry after the heavy
rains. But whatever the means used by Stamm, we know that Greeff
did enter the vault with him last night... ."</p>

<p>"The gardenia, of course&mdash;and the bloodstains," Markham
murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it was quite evident...And after Stamm had killed
Greeff and mutilated him exactly as he had mutilated Montague, he
took him down to the pot-holes in the wheelbarrow, over the sandy
ground along the foot of the cliff, where he would not attract the
attention of any guard that might have been stationed on the East
Road."</p>

<p>Heath gave a gratified grunt.</p>

<p>"And then he left the wheelbarrow in that bunch of trees, and
pussy-footed back to the house."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Sergeant. Moreover, the grating metallic noise that
Leland heard was obviously the creaking of the rusty hinges of the
vault door; and the other sound which Leland described could have
been nothing but the wheelbarrow. And, despite all Stamm's caution
on re-entering the house, both Leland and Trainor heard him throw
the bolt."</p>

<p>Vance sighed.</p>

<p>"It was not a perfect murder, Markham, but it had the elements
of perfection in it. It was a bold murder, too; for if either of
the murders were solved, both would be solved. It was a double
gamble&mdash;the placing of two chips, instead of one, on a
selected number."</p>

<p>Again Markham nodded sombrely.</p>

<p>"That part is clear enough now," he said. "But why should the
key to the vault have been found in Tatum's room?"</p>

<p>"That was part of Stamm's fundamental mistake. As I have said,
Stamm was overcautious. He didn't have the courage to carry through
his plot without building bridges. He may have had the key for
years, or he may have secured it recently from Mrs. Stamm's trunk.
But really, it doesn't matter. Once he had used it for his purpose,
he could not throw it away, for obviously he intended to remove the
diving suit from the vault when the first opportunity offered. He
could have hidden the key in the meantime; but if the diving suit
had been discovered in the vault by some one's tearing down a wall
or breaking in the door, suspicion would immediately have fallen on
him, as it was his own diving suit. Therefore, in an effort to
protect himself in this remote eventuality, he probably put the key
first in Greeff's room, to point suspicion to Greeff. Then, when
the opportunity to murder Greeff arose, Stamm planted the key in
Tatum's room. Stamm liked Leland and wanted Bernice to marry
him&mdash;which, incidentally, was the primary motive for his
getting rid of Montague&mdash;and he certainly would not have tried
to throw suspicion on Leland. You will remember that I first
searched Greeff's room&mdash;I thought that the key might be there,
inasmuch as there was a possibility we would think that Greeff had
merely run away. But when it was not there I looked for it in
Tatum's room. Luckily we found it and didn't have to break into the
vault&mdash;which I would certainly have insisted upon if there had
been no other means of entering."</p>

<p>"But what I still don't understand, Vance," Markham persisted,
"is why the key should have interested you in the first place."</p>

<p>"Neither do I&mdash;entirely," Vance returned. "And it's much
too hot tonight to indulge in psychological analyses of my mental
quirks. Let's say, for brevity, that my idea about the key was mere
guesswork. As you know, the vault fascinated me because of its
strategic position; and I couldn't see how else the first murder
could have been so neatly accomplished unless the vault had been
used in some way. It was most convenient, don't y' know. But the
entire matter was far from clear in my mind. In fact, it was dashed
vague. However, I thought it worth determining, and that's why I
went to Mrs. Stamm and demanded to know the hiding-place of the
key. I frightened her into telling me, for she didn't associate the
vault with Stamm's machinations. When I discovered that the key had
disappeared from its hiding-place, I was more convinced than ever
that it was a factor in the solution of our problem."</p>

<p>"But how, in the name of Heaven," asked Markham, "did you first
hit upon the idea that Stamm was the guilty person? He was the only
person in the house that seemed to have a good alibi."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"No, Markham old dear; he was the only member of the party who
did <i>not</i> have an alibi. And it was for that reason that I had
my eye on him from the first&mdash;although I admit there were
other possibilities. Stamm, of course, thought that he had built up
a perfect alibi, at the same time hoping that the murder would pass
as a mere departure. But when Montague's murder was established,
Stamm's position was really weaker than that of any of the others;
for he was the only one who was not standing beside the pool at the
time Montague dived in. It would have been difficult for any one of
the others to have murdered Montague in the circumstances, just as
it would have been impossible for Stamm to have murdered him if he
had actually been in a state of acute alcoholism. It was this
combination of circumstances that gave me my first inkling of the
truth. Naturally, Stamm couldn't have gone to the pool with the
others and still have accomplished his purpose; and, reasoning from
this premise, I arrived at the conclusion that it was possible for
him to have feigned drunkenness by secretly disposing of his
liquor, and then made his drunkenness a reality after he had
returned to the house. When I learned that he had spent the entire
evening on the davenport in the library, I naturally became
interested in the jardini&egrave;re holding the rubber-plant at the
head of the davenport."</p>

<p>"But, Vance," protested Markham, "if you were so certain from
the first that the crime was rational and commonplace, why all the
silly pother about a dragon?"</p>

<p>"It was not silly. There was always the remote possibility that
some strange fish, or sea-monster, had been responsible for
Montague's death. Even the greatest zoologists understand but
little about aquatic life: it is positively amazin' how meagre our
knowledge of under-water creatures really is. The breeding of the
Betta, for instance, has been going on for decades, and with all
our experimentation with this labyrinth family, no one knows
whether the <i>Betta pugnax</i> is a nest-builder or a
mouthbreeder. Mrs. Stamm was quite right when she ridiculed
scientific knowledge of submarine life. And you must not forget,
Markham, that Stamm was an ardent fish hunter, and that he brought
back to this country all kinds of rare specimens about which
practically nothing is known. Scientifically, the superstition of
the pool could not be ignored. But, I admit, I did not take the
matter very seriously. I clung childishly to the trodden paths, for
life has a most disappointin' way of proving commonplace and
rational when we are hopin' most passionately for the bizarre and
supernatural. Anyway, I thought it worth while to inspect Stamm's
collection of fish. But I was more or less familiar with all his
exhibits; so I descended to the realm of simple, understandable
things, and tested the soil in the jardini&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"And incidentally," Markham commented, with a slow smile, "you
lingered over the fish and the other plants so as not to give Stamm
any idea of what you were really after in the rubber-plant
pot."</p>

<p>Vance smiled back.</p>

<p>"It may be, don't y' know...How about another magnum of Pol
Roger?" And he rang for Currie.</p>

<p>It was less than a year after these two sinister murders at the
old Dragon Pool, with their sequence of tragedies, that Leland and
Bernice Stamm were married. They were both strong and, in many
ways, remarkable characters; but the memory of the tragedies
affected them too deeply for them to remain in Inwood. They built a
home in the hills of Westchester, and went there to live. Vance and
I visited them shortly after their marriage.</p>

<p>The old Stamm residence was never occupied again, and the estate
was acquired by the city and added to what is now Inwood Hill Park.
The house was torn down, and only the crumbling stones of its
foundation remain. But the two square stone posts of the entrance
gate, which marked the beginning of the driveway from Bolton Road,
are still standing. The old Dragon Pool exists no more. The stream
that fed it was diverted into Spuyten Duyvil Creek. Its
semi-artificial bed has been filled in, and what was once the basin
of the Dragon Pool is now overgrown with wild vegetation. It would
be difficult today even to trace the course of the old stream or to
determine the former boundaries of that sinister and tragic
pool.</p>

<p>After the final tragedy and the breaking up of the century-old
traditions of the Stamm estate, I often wondered what became of
Trainor, the butler, when the doors of the ancient mansion had been
closed for all time. Why the memory of the fellow should have
remained in my mind, I cannot say; but there was in him something
at once ghost-like and corporeal, something both pathetic and
offensive, which made a strong impression on me. I was, therefore,
glad when I recently ran into him.</p>

<p>Vance and I were visiting a tropical-fish shop in East 34th
Street; and there, behind the counter, half hidden by the tanks,
was Trainor.</p>

<p>He recognized Vance at once, and shook his head lugubriously as
we approached him.</p>

<p>"I'm not doing so well with my <i>Scatophagus</i> here," he
repined. "Not the proper conditions&mdash;if you know what I mean,
sir."</p>
