  Blinky Runs Away</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page005.jpg" alt="one" width="500" height="211"></p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty had  talked matters over for nearly a whole night, and towards the dawn had decided  upon a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Grunty, &ldquo;Blinky needs a firm hand over him now that he has grown up; and who  could you find better than Mrs. Magpie to give him just the discipline that all  young bears require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty used all her powers of  persuasion. She secretly longed to give Blinky a good smack occasionally, and  at times found her right paw fairly itching to be used hard on that naughty  bear&rsquo;s pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know, Mrs. Koala,&rdquo; she  continued, &ldquo;Snubby is a different child since Blinky came here. He was always  so good and obedient before, but now&mdash;&rdquo; and she sighed deeply, right down in her  bear tummy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Koala, &ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t change Blinky for fifteen Snubbies.&rdquo; And she gave a decided sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! I quite see your  side of the question,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty answered. &ldquo;But this everlasting mending of  pants and cleaning of ears, while all the time wondering when I&rsquo;ll get a hit on  the nose again with a gum-nut.&mdash;Well, it&rsquo;s too much for any mother bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of all the lovely  gum-tips Blinky has brought you to eat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Koala, bristling with  indignation. &ldquo;All the same, I must admit he has been very trying lately. I  sometimes think it is the new pair of knickerbockers that is to blame, because  he&rsquo;s been twice as naughty ever since the day he first put them on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take them off again,&rdquo;  growled Mrs. Grunty. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always hanging half-way down his legs, never  fastened as they should be. If there&rsquo;s one thing I can&rsquo;t stand it&rsquo;s  knickerbockers half-mast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind that so much,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;Every real bear at that age seems to wear them that way;  but he loses the buttons, and I can&rsquo;t find any at all now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to be any further  ahead in our discussion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grunty coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I send Blinky to Mrs. Magpie&rsquo;s  school for a month, perhaps he&rsquo;ll return a little quieter,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  sorrowfully. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never make a man of Snubby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  exclaimed snappily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make a man of  Snubby!&rdquo; and Mrs. Koala glared as she repeated her remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my dear, we must not  quarrel over our children,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grunty kindly. &ldquo;After all it will do  Blinky no harm and give you a good rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided. Blinky was to  be packed off to Mrs. Magpie&rsquo;s school the next evening and the two mother bears  became friends again.</p>
<p>Up in the gum-tree snuggled  together, two little bears had listened to all this with big ears opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Snubby?&rdquo;  Blinky asked with wide open eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be sent to Mrs. Magpie&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful! She&rsquo;ll peck you  ever so hard,&rdquo; Snubby whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cause I won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;  Blinky boldly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to. Your mother will  make you,&rdquo; Snubby answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly as big as she is; and  besides I&rsquo;m grown up now. Look at my bockers!&rdquo; And Blinky proudly pulled them a  little farther down his short stubby legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish my mother would make me a  pair of bockers,&rdquo; sighed Snubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you mine, &rsquo;cause I  won&rsquo;t be wearing them again,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t go to school  undressed!&rdquo; And Snubby looked very shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, I&rsquo;m not going to  school, now or never. I&rsquo;m going to run away; but I think I&rsquo;ll take my bockers  with me as you&rsquo;d look silly in them.&rdquo; With that Blinky puffed out his tummy  till a few stitches gave way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page007.jpg" alt="tell" width="574" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Snubby  inquired in a frightened voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just away, over there.&rdquo; And  Blinky waved a little paw in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the men are!&rdquo; Snubby  whispered, holding his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And adventures, too,&rdquo; Blinky  replied excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s farm  is and I know where Mr. Willie Wagtail lives, and where the flying squirrel  plays, and lots of other things, and best of all where the lyre-bird dances.  I&rsquo;ll go and see all these things, while you&rsquo;re up here in the gum-tree just  eating leaves all night long and listening to old Mrs. Grunty growling.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page008.jpg" alt="squirel" width="400" height="587"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Snubby longed to go too, but he  was such a good little bear. When he thought of all that Blinky said, his heart  went pit-a-pat so loudly that he became frightened at the very thought of  running away. Much better to be safe in a tree even if his mother did growl  sometimes. But he knew he would miss his playmate and tears slowly trickled  down his little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you wear bockers when  you&rsquo;re crying?&rdquo; said Blinky scornfully.</p>
<p>Snubby brushed the tears away with  his paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m crying,&rdquo; he  said bravely. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s eyes go like that when she has lost her glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you eat while you&rsquo;re  away, and where will you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are juicy plants to find  and I&rsquo;ll sleep in a tree; but if I get to Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s place I&rsquo;ll find a cosy  corner in his house. But I can&rsquo;t tell you any more just now&mdash;it&rsquo;s wasting time.  The sun will be up soon and I must hide before mother finds I&rsquo;m gone. Just  watch how quickly I slide down this tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The naughty bear climbed down past  Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty, who were snoozing in a corner. Quickly and silently  he slid to the ground leaving a patch of his bockers on the last branch as he  went. He looked very funny, pattering over the ground, one leg of his bockers  torn and draggled. But he didn&rsquo;t care a fig&mdash;anything was better than Mrs.  Magpie&rsquo;s school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old pecker!&rdquo; he mumbled to  himself as he trotted along. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all through Mrs. Grunty. I wish I&rsquo;d  hidden her glasses before I left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun peeped through the bush  warming the leaves on Blinky&rsquo;s pathway, and shy little lizards poked their  heads out from under the stones, surprised to find a bear wandering through  their bushland.</p>
<p>Blinky began to stumble, and his  knickerbockers caught in every bramble and twig on the way. At last, feeling so  tired, he decided to find a suitable tree for a sleep.</p>
<p>A large gum stood straight in his  pathway, just the kind made for bears. Smooth and tall, protecting branches  high up from the ground, and hundreds of leaves to shelter a little chap like  himself. Struggling along he reached the foot of the tree and began to climb. He  was an expert climber, much stronger now than when we first knew him, and his  claws were longer so that his grip on the trunk of the tree was very sure and  strong. Up and up he climbed and had almost reached the top when he heard a  great commotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; he  exclaimed. &ldquo;Sounds like Mrs. Grunty again,&rdquo; and pausing just under a branch he  peeped round the bough to see what all the noise was about.</p>
<p>Feathers were flying in all  directions, pecks and squawks disturbed the morning air and the leaves of the  tree trembled with fright. Strangest of all, rows and rows of little dead birds  hung from the twigs. It looked like a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. The sun caught the  bright colours of beautiful feathers on the breasts and wings of tiny feathered  folk. Little heads hung down with dull eyes that had glistened only a short  time before, and teeny claws curled up&mdash;gripping nothing. Tears came to Blinky&rsquo;s  eyes. Something terrible had happened. The bush he knew was so kind, everything  was alive and sparkling, rustling with life and twittering with gladness; but  here everything was still and songless, except for the dreadful fight that was  in progress. Two butcher-birds were fighting savagely, each trying to knock the  other out of the tree. At last Blinky could not bear to look on any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you two birds,&rdquo; he shouted,  &ldquo;stop fighting and pecking one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He really felt terribly brave, but  was surprised to hear his own voice sounding so loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s funny nose!&rdquo; called out  one of the butcher-birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing in  our tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky thought very quickly for a  moment, then, summoning up all his courage, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just called to show you my  knickerbockers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the name of the funny  looking thing on your face?&rdquo; called back the rude butcher-birds again.</p>
<p>This was too much for Blinky. He  scrambled on to the branch where the birds stood, and glared at them savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have a funny nose,&rdquo; he  cried, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got very sharp claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butcher-birds twittered and  trembled. Their hooked beaks opened with fright and they clung to the tree very  tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the noise about?&rdquo;  Blinky demanded in a gruff tone.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page012.jpg" alt="birds" width="582" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&mdash;it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; the  largest bird began. &ldquo;Mrs. Possum is holding a bazaar in aid of the poor rabbits  who came through the bush-fire. Their homes have been wiped out and all the  grass burnt, so that there is no food. Some even had their whiskers and tails  singed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t have whiskers and  tails,&rdquo; Blinky remarked. &ldquo;Look at me&mdash;no tail&mdash;no whiskers. Tails are stupid  things,&rdquo; he said rudely, gazing at the butcher-birds&rsquo; tails. &ldquo;Always getting in  the way and making animals squeak and yelp when they&rsquo;re trodden on. And,  besides, think of the extra washing to be done; as it is my ears take an awful  time to clean.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page011.jpg" alt="tail" width="600" height="665"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What polish do you use for your  nose?&rdquo; the butcher-birds asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No polish,&rdquo; Blinky grunted, &ldquo;only  paws.&rdquo; But feeling the conversation was becoming personal he asked more about  the bazaar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the bazaar to be held?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down in the gully,&rdquo; both birds  echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bazaar, anyway?&rdquo; Blinky  asked, pretending not to be very interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all sell things and make  things, and there&rsquo;s lots to see and hear. Last bazaar Mrs. Thrush sang for us,  and Gertrude Spider spun her finest web and showed us how to catch flies, and  Mrs. Spotty Frog&rsquo;s pupils gave an exhibition of jumping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in the other  butcher-bird, &ldquo;and just to make things more exciting Mrs. Snake shed her skin,  her very own skin&mdash;even the part that covered her eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been wonderful!&rdquo;  exclaimed Blinky in wonderment. &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We help to supply the supper,&rdquo;  said the big bird, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just what we were talking about when you came  along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to be an angry talk,&rdquo;  Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fault!&rdquo; the little  bird piped looking at his companion. &ldquo;He stole my nicest bird that took me  hours and hours to catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; croaked the  big bird. &ldquo;Look at the fine birds I&rsquo;ve caught, and yours was such a teeny  thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it has the brightest  feathers,&rdquo; complained the little bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re both very cruel,&rdquo;  said Blinky, looking at the rows of dead birds. &ldquo;If I had a gun I&rsquo;d shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the big bird put  back his head and pealed with laughter. Blinky stood amazed. Such beautiful  clear flute-like notes rang through the air. There was Mr. Butcher-bird, the  cruellest of birds, singing as no other bird could sing, except of course, Mrs.  Thrush. Note after note rang out and his mate joined in the chorus. The trees  seemed to hush their rustling leaves to listen to such beautiful music.</p>
<p>When the song had finished all  thoughts of unkindness had left Blinky&rsquo;s mind. Everything had its own way of  being cruel and kind he thought, and after all he must not say rude things to  the butcher-birds as he wanted to see the bazaar.</p>
<p>He sat down in a corner of the  tree and presently began to nod his little head. His eyes blinked and wouldn&rsquo;t  stay open. The tree was so comfortable and he was so tired. He fell asleep and  into dreamland. A dreamland of bears. His mother, Mrs. Koala, seemed to be  patching bockers, and Mrs. Grunty, with her spectacles perched right on the tip  of her nose, was shaking her paw and saying over and over again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad lad, that boy of  yours&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be the death of us all!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page015.jpg" alt="death" width="750" height="530"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Snubby was there, too, peeping  timidly round the back of the tree. He looked different, though; something was  wrong with his face. And, as Blinky dreamed, he had another look at Mrs. Grunty  and his mother. Oh, how funny they looked! Their noses had turned into ears and  their ears into noses. &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; whispered Blinky to himself. &ldquo;I wonder  if my nose is a nose still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And putting up his paw, he woke up  to find himself patting that part of his face in a very doubtful manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! you butcher-birds,&rdquo; he  called out, &ldquo;is my nose still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still there!&rdquo; the big bird  replied scornfully, &ldquo;I should say it was. Who wants to steal that? We don&rsquo;t  hang up noses in our tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you dare to touch  it!&rdquo; muttered Blinky angrily. &ldquo;By the way, when is the bazaar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight!&rdquo; the birds replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come?&rdquo; Blinky smiled his  sweetest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take something or  do something if you come, there&rsquo;s no free admittance. Mrs. Possum is very  strict about that. Last bazaar Percy Bull Ant tried to sneak in by clinging to  Mrs. Rabbit&rsquo;s tail and only that he nearly lost his balance and fell off and  gave Mrs. Rabbit such a nip, he&rsquo;d have sneaked in. Mrs. Rabbit gave a  tremendous leap, and let out such a squeal, that of course he was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page016.jpg" alt="leap" width="450" height="387"></p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried Blinky  excitedly. &ldquo;Just what I said about tails. Always in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well she had a tail or  the sting might have been much more serious,&rdquo; the big bird replied. &ldquo;What would  happen to you I&rsquo;d like to know, if a bull ant stung you where your tail ought  to be? Tails are a great comfort at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude,&rdquo;  Blinky quickly answered. &ldquo;But if Mrs. Rabbit hadn&rsquo;t had a tail Percy Bull Ant  might have chosen a gum-leaf to hide him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not him!&rdquo; the butcher-bird  scoffed. &ldquo;Why, he even stood up to fight and waved his front legs at Sergeant  Hornet when he was ordered to put him out. Such boldness. It caused so much  commotion that Mrs. Possum fell in the lucky dip and the Rev. Fluffy Ears had  to help her out. There she was, covered in sand from head to foot and some  impertinent young fellow, who I really believe was Willie Wagtail, called out  at the top of his voice: &lsquo;Sweet pretty little creature&rsquo;. Oh, it was really  terrible! And all through Percy Bull Ant trying to get in free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take anything and I can&rsquo;t  do anything,&rdquo; said Blinky sorrowfully. &ldquo;But I could look after the lucky dip  for them if they want somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said both  butcher-birds together. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll have to be someone this time to keep an eye  on things, and watch most carefully that Mr. Wombat does not burrow under the  &lsquo;dip&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s a cunning fellow and always has an excuse ready. He walks round and  round the refreshment stall, sniffing everything and pretending he doesn&rsquo;t like  the look of juicy leaves; and just as Mrs. Wallaby thinks he is quite safe and  turns her back to have a chat with some friend, he snatches a mouthful of the  very best he can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo; said  Blinky gladly. &ldquo;Now I think I&rsquo;ll have another sleep. I always feel dozy in the  daytime, and this corner is so warm and soft. Be sure you wake me in time for  the bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Bazaar</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page018.jpg" alt="two" width="500" height="244"></p>
<p>Down in the gully hidden from view  by tall gum-trees, banksias, and tea-trees, right against a huge rock the  bazaar was held. Dozens and dozens of birds, insects, and animals, all dressed  in their very best, chattering and squeaking, calling and singing, spreading  their goods out on the rock, under it, and around it. No little boy or girl  could see this wonder show, unless they wandered far off the beaten track,  through the tall spear grass, deep, deep in the heart of the bush, away from  all noises and people, and far down the valley where the maidenhair fern grows.  Then you may be lucky enough to see a bush bazaar. But faces must be clean,  hands washed, and hair combed, as every animal and bird has plumed and preened  himself and herself to look their very best. But hush! the Rev. Fluffy Ears is  ready to make a speech and declare the bazaar open.</p>
<p>He looks splendid! I&rsquo;m sure he has  been hours and hours brushing his ears, they look so silky. There he is perched  on the branch of a tree looking down on all the bush folk, as they sit and hop  around, trying to find a patch of grass or rock to rest upon. There is very  little room left for even a grasshopper to squeeze in, and some grumpy old  ladies like Mrs. Owl and Miss Goanna, glare at the younger ones as they try to  find a spare seat. The colours are wonderful. Red and orange and purple berries  are clustered in huge piles over the rock. Bright green leaves and the softest  brown toadstools lie together. Birds&rsquo; eggs of every colour imaginable are there  in dozens to be sold and right up against them are the little dead birds the  butcher-birds have brought. This is the produce store and guarding it with  glittering eyes is Mrs. Wallaby. Woe betide any creature who tries to steal  even a berry. Farther away is a wonderful collection of birds&rsquo; nests, all  shapes and sizes, with a notice standing in the centre:</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page024.jpg" alt="guarding" width="594" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p align="center">READY  MADE HOMES<br>
  SUITABLE FOR FINCHES OR MAGPIES<br>
  MIXED FROM THE BEST MUD AND GRASSES<br>
  DIRT CHEAP!</p>
<p>Then there were small piles of  grit, some red, others black and brown. The notice above these read:</p>
<p align="center">ANTS,  TAKE YOUR CHOICE!<br>
  THE VERY FINEST GRIT ON THE MARKET<br>
  ALL HALF PRICE!</p>
<p>Under the ledge of the rock sat  Miss Gertrude Spider with a very patient look on her face. But cunning, crafty  eyes spoilt her appearance. Every hair on her legs was shining, and her body  was polished like a door-knob. She had dozens and dozens of webs for sale, and  knew very well that the fairies and goblins would be her best customers. Such  folk dwell in the gullies and wait eagerly their chance of buying new webs for  their clothes. Some webs were made of the finest thread (far finer than silk  the silk-worm spins) and were glittering with dewdrops. These were the very  best and most expensive: only for fairy queens and princesses. Others were just  as beautiful, though a little coarser, and had no dewdrops. But, as Gertrude  said, they will &ldquo;stand wear and tear&rdquo;. Every now and then she pulled a web,  tugging it this way and that to show how strong it really was. Curly leaves on  the ground were crammed full of flies&mdash;some dead, some alive. Others held  mosquitoes and sand-flies and some even held small beetles. These were labelled  according to their value:</p>
<p align="center">DEAD  FLIES&mdash;QUITE FRESH, YOUNG AND PLUMP<br>
  TAKE SOME HOME FOR SUPPER</p>
<p>Another was labelled:</p>
<p align="center">FLIES  ALL ALIVE!<br>
  LEGS AND ALL<br>
  SUITABLE FOR ALL OCCASIONS</p>
<p>The beetles had a special notice  above them:</p>
<p align="center">BEETLES  IN SEASON!<br>
  COLOURS NOT CHARGED FOR<br>
  WINGS AND NIPPERS SOLD SEPARATELY<br>
  BEETLE PIE RECIPE GIVEN FREE</p>
<p>Gertrude Spider had dozens of  customers round her stall. But the beetles who had come to see the bazaar stood  aside in small groups, whispering in undertones and glancing nervously in her  direction. Farther away in a dark musty corner hidden from view by a huge web  was her parlour, and she even had the boldness to suggest to small customers  that they should &ldquo;walk into my parlour&rdquo;. Just as if no one knew what that  meant!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page020.jpg" alt="eyes" width="500" height="393"></p>
<p>The frogs were in charge of the  swimming-pool and had a grand slippery-dip made from a rock covered with  slithery moss. Their customers were mostly frog friends, but wild ducks also  patronized the slippery-dip. A swoop and a swish and one after another they  splashed into the pool, amidst jeering and croaking from the onlookers. The  bravest frogs did double-bankers and back somersaults and all kinds of fancy  flips and flops. Right across the centre of the pool a branch of a tree rested  on either side, and on it squatted a big fat mosquito. This was the greasy  pole, and the fellow who was lucky enough to keep his balance while he crossed,  had the thought of that fine fat mosquito for a prize.</p>
<p>The mosquito was tied to the  branch by the finest spider-web; so he was a prisoner, trembling from head to  foot as he watched each new frog take his few steps, lose his balance and go  flopping into the pool.</p>
<p>Shh! Shh! There was a sudden  silence, and all the bush folk turned to look at the Rev. Fluffy Ears. He waved  his paw and flicked his ears, then spoke in a clear dignified tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, spend all  your money at this bazaar, as you know it is in aid of our poor friends who are  homeless through the fire. Those who have no money can give their services  free. Mrs. Possum has worked hard for months to make this bazaar a success, so  I hope to see a friendly spirit among you all. Don&rsquo;t spoil things by scratching  or kicking your neighbour (as I saw Mrs. Magpie and Mrs. Peewit doing) or  biting and nipping a friend&rsquo;s tail when his back is turned. It is not kind. And  above all remember there is to be no stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flutter in the tree and an angry  voice from Mrs. Flying Fox prevented Rev. Fluffy Ears from speaking further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice thing to suggest!&rdquo; she  screamed. &ldquo;Stealing indeed! As if anyone would do such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A painful look came over the Rev.  Fluffy Ears&rsquo; face, he patted his nose, and felt his collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an insult! That&rsquo;s what it  is,&rdquo; roared Mrs. Flying Fox. And she made a lunge at the Rev. Fluffy Ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I interfered,&rdquo; muttered  Blinky to himself. Up to the present he had been sitting very quietly in a  corner of the tree, too surprised and amazed at everything he saw to speak or  even show himself. But he was not going to see another bear get the worst of a  fight with all these creatures looking on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; he commanded at the  top of his voice. &ldquo;Stop at once, or I&rsquo;ll push you out of the tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Flying Fox darted round to  see where the voice came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only you, is it? Another  one of the Koala family poking his big nose into other people&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;  Blinky became very angry, and poor Fluffy Ears began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone stand below and catch her  when I push her off!&rdquo; he shouted; and before Mrs. Flying Fox could believe her  ears she was given a kick that sent her flying out of the tree; but to  everyone&rsquo;s horror Blinky&rsquo;s bockers caught in a twig just as he gave the kick,  and there he hung, suspended in mid-air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  falling.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page027.jpg" alt="help" width="563" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A rip and a split and Blinky  parted from the best part of his knickerbockers. Down he fell&mdash;thud, right in  the middle of a squealing and kicking crowd. It was not on the programme to  find a fat, plump bear squashing and kicking everyone within reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab her legs!&rdquo; Blinky shouted,  but no one could get near enough, as he seemed to be raising all the dust it  was possible for anyone to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle this hubbub!&rdquo; said  Percy Bull Ant, blowing out his chest and advancing cautiously with his two  front legs waving threateningly. Edging round the fighters he managed at last  to get a grip on Blinky&rsquo;s paw. Nip, nip, nip he bit with all his might. Blinky  gave a spring in the air and came down right on top of Mrs. Possum.</p>
<p>Mrs. Possum bit him savagely and  naughty Blinky at once kicked her, scratching and ripping her best hat to  shreds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Possum. &ldquo;Look at  my hat, my very best hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his fault; it&rsquo;s all  through Mrs. Flying Fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was Angelina Wallaby of all  people, and you can imagine how pleased Blinky was to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear Angelina. Where did you  come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to be watching you  from the bush, and when I saw you fall, I thought it high time I came along to  save you. Just look at your best bockers! What will your mother say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Blinky said  nervously, feeling the back of his pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a <i>very</i> large hole,  Angelina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so large, that you&rsquo;ve no  bockers at the back at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve you right! I hope you get a  good smacking when you arrive home. <i>I  hope your mother wallops you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Blinky exclaimed, too  surprised for further words.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Flying Fox speaking.  She grinned spitefully at Blinky. Certainly, she was bruised after her bump on  the ground; but what&rsquo;s a bump or two, and now, there she stood as cheeky as  ever&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to start the  lucky-dip,&rdquo; called out Blinky, and trotted over to his stall.</p>
<p>The lucky-dip was a wonderful  attraction. A burnt-out stump of a great gum-tree was filled with marvellous  things, all tied up in gum-leaves. Everyone who wanted a dip had first to place  a present at Blinky&rsquo;s feet, and a row of bull ants kept guard over these.</p>
<p>The first customer was Miss  Silver-eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please may I have a dip?&rdquo; she  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your present?&rdquo; asked  Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; she piped as she  placed a beautiful red berry at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and have your dip,&rdquo;  Blinky commanded. So Miss Silver-eye dipped her beak into the lucky-dip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; everyone demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feather!&rdquo; said Miss Silver-eye  delightedly. &ldquo;Just what I want for my nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next please!&rdquo; shouted Blinky.</p>
<p>Up came Mrs. Lizard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your present?&rdquo; Blinky  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said, and placed  a dead fly at his feet. Crawling into the bin she came out with a parcel  between her teeth.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page025.jpg" alt="fly" width="400" height="381"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it!&rdquo; they all cried, craning  their necks to see what treasure it held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! It&rsquo;s only a stone,&rdquo; said  Mrs. Lizard disgustedly. &ldquo;I think the dip&rsquo;s a take-down.&rdquo; And tossing her head  in the air she wriggled away.</p>
<p>There seemed to be an air of  dissatisfaction at once among the customers who waited their turn as each had  come with a present that had taken quite a deal of thinking about, to say  nothing of the hunting for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No remarks are allowed in  future,&rdquo; said Blinky. &ldquo;Take the good with the bad. Now who is next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; called out a tiny voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you. Stand in front  please,&rdquo; Blinky shouted in his bassiest voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; came the reply.  Looking down Blinky saw Master Trapdoor Spider at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your present?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t brought one,&rdquo; Master  Trapdoor said boldly. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t let me have a dip I&rsquo;ll poison you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nasty fellow! Let him have his  dip,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Possum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get your prize out for you,&rdquo;  said Blinky, in a generous voice, and Master Trapdoor&rsquo;s eyes glistened with  excitement.</p>
<p>Blinky pulled out a parcel,  unwrapped the leaf and a huge frog jumped out.</p>
<p>In a twinkling he had gobbled up  Master Trapdoor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes through being  rude!&rdquo; said Blinky, as he eyed the rest of the customers sternly.</p>
<p>Several very quietly crawled or  flew away, as they evidently did not want the same thing to happen to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; Blinky  called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; cried Madam Hare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your present?&rdquo; Blinky  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, and a very valuable  one too!&rdquo; Madam Hare replied, as she placed a whisker at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though it&rsquo;s been used,&rdquo;  muttered Blinky. &ldquo;Take your dip quickly please.&rdquo; He had good cause to remember  Madam Hare, and thought it best to be polite.</p>
<p>With a bound Madam Hare sprang  right on top of the dip. Blinky bit his lip and clenched his paws, he was  feeling so savage.</p>
<p>Madam Hare gave a kick with her  hind legs and sent dozens of parcels flying out of the dip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Stop that!&rdquo; cried Blinky  angrily. But Madam Hare only gave another kick. Out came more parcels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it at once!&rdquo; cried  Blinky, and pounced on Madam Hare, biting her ear.</p>
<p>She turned suddenly and sprang out  of the bin with two parcels in her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch her! Catch her!&rdquo; Blinky  called, as he raced away after the thief.</p>
<p>Madam Hare was too quick for him.  Away she bounded, over the stalls, knocking things down as she went and not  caring a button for the shouts and screams behind her. Into the bush she raced  and didn&rsquo;t stop until she came to her home. There she untied the parcels, and  savagely kicked them about when she saw what they contained. One was a bundle  of straw and the other the leaf of a stinging-nettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robbers!&rdquo; she cried, as she  kicked them again and again.</p>
<p>Losing no time, Blinky raced back  to the lucky-dip, just in time to find all the customers opening the parcels  that Madam Hare had kicked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them down! Put them down!&rdquo; he  roared. The customers scampered away, each carrying a prize. As Blinky stood  and gazed at the empty lucky-dip, feeling very sorry about it all, and still  very angry, his friends the butcher-birds hopped round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a success?&rdquo; they inquired.</p>
<p>Blinky said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are all the presents?&rdquo; they  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, or I&rsquo;ll eat you both,&rdquo;  Blinky growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a bad temper!&rdquo; whispered  the butcher-birds, and flew off while it was safe.</p>
<p>Curling himself up in a corner  Blinky decided to have a sleep, as chasing Madam Hare and fighting Mrs. Flying Fox  had made him very tired.</p>
<p>Nodding his little head, and  curling his toes up he was soon dreaming again of Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty.  He did not wake until daylight, and looking around he was surprised to find all  the bush folk had vanished. The presents and goods had all gone too, and only  an old owl gazed at him from a nearby tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you made a start for  home,&rdquo; said the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home,&rdquo; replied  Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise little bears won&rsquo;t stay here  too long,&rdquo; said the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s favourite  shooting-place,&rdquo; replied the old owl. &ldquo;He has a gun and a big dog, and when  they come along and find you here you&rsquo;ll be rabbit pie in two twos.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page030.jpg" alt="pie" width="400" height="359"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does Mr. Smifkins live?&rdquo;  Blinky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down behind the moon! Whoo! Whoo!&rdquo;  answered the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! Whoo!&rdquo; echoed Blinky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not afraid of Mr. Smifkins. I&rsquo;m going to see where he lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! Whoo!&rdquo; cried the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! Whoo!&rdquo; the old owl called  again, his great round eyes gazing at Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show me the way to Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s, please, Mr. Owl?&rdquo; Blinky pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. Whoo! Whoo!&rdquo; the owl  answered and flew away to another tree.</p>
<p>Blinky trotted along, his funny  little legs going wobbly, wobbly as he went.</p>
<p>The old owl waited patiently until  his little friend was under the tree, then crying whoo, whoo, off he flew again  to the next tree.</p>
<p>Here he waited for Blinky and flew  to the ground to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little bear,&rdquo; he cried softly,  &ldquo;it is too light for me to see farther, we must sleep now until the sun goes  down. I am as blind as a bat in the day time and here is a tree with nice young  gum-leaves on it waiting for you to taste.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page032.jpg" alt="light" width="554" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very hungry,&rdquo; said Blinky.  &ldquo;They never think to have food for bears at bazaars. Only nasty flies and frogs  and mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come up into the branches  and I will show you gum-leaves made specially for young bears,&rdquo; said the kind  old owl.</p>
<p>Blinky climbed up the tree and sat  next to his friend chewing young tender leaves until he could eat no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! Whoo! It&rsquo;s time to sleep!&rdquo;  said the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel tired, too,&rdquo; replied  Blinky. And so cuddled together, a strange-looking pair, they snoozed and  waited until the moon arose.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Mr. Smifkins&rsquo; Farm</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page033.jpg" alt="three" width="500" height="244"></p>
<p>Blinky was awakened by a soft  &ldquo;whoo, whoo&rdquo;. He sat up and blinked his eyes. There was the moon shining  through the leaves like a big golden penny and Mr. Owl&rsquo;s eyes looked almost as  large as he gazed at Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to get up,&rdquo; he said very  quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s far away?&rdquo;  Blinky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six tree stops from here,&rdquo;  Mr. Owl replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better make a start while the bush is cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grunting with glee Blinky crawled  down the tree and as he reached the ground the old owl flew on ahead. After  they had reached six-stopping places Blinky looked up in the tree as Mr. Owl  hooted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is as far as I come,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the farm?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow the track you are now on  and in a very short time you will come to a fence. That is where the Smifkinses  live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Owl, for  showing me the way,&rdquo; Blinky called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo, whoo!&rdquo; the old owl cried  and on noiseless wings he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be very quiet and lonely  just here,&rdquo; Blinky thought as he pattered along.</p>
<p>Presently he came to an opening in  the trees and peering through he saw the fence just a few yards ahead. Farther  on he could see a house with a light gleaming in the window and smoke rising  from the chimney. Under the fence he crawled and through a potato patch, then  very quietly he crept through the orchard. Here he sat and waited. Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s dog was barking and Blinky remembered what Mr. Owl had said about  that dog.</p>
<p>He waited until the light went out  in the window and then crept nearer and nearer the house. On to the veranda he  climbed and softly tiptoed round to the back door. Everything was locked up  there, so he decided to explore the side of the house.</p>
<p>Peeping round the corner he saw a  bed on the veranda and thought he&rsquo;d have a look to see what was in it. So  softly as a cat he went and sniffed the end of the blanket. Some very funny  sounds came from under that blanket.</p>
<p>Blinky held his breath with  fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful noise!&rdquo; he  thought. &ldquo;I must see where it is coming from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing up on the bed he crawled  along the side, and&mdash;oh dear, what a funny sight he saw!</p>
<p>Mr. Smifkins was fast asleep  making such queer noises with his mouth open; and over his head was a long  white net.</p>
<p>Blinky gazed and gazed at him.  Never had he seen anything so funny. Why, he even had whiskers just like Mr.  Wombat, only much thicker, and they drooped all over his chin, while Mr.  Wombat&rsquo;s stuck out straight and stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take some of those  whiskers to show Mr. Wombat,&rdquo; Blinky whispered to himself. Wouldn&rsquo;t Mrs. Grunty  like some to pad her gum-leaf cushion with! and then his mother could make use  of them for sewing on buttons.</p>
<p>Snore, snore. Mr. Smifkins had no  idea he had a visitor.</p>
<p>Lifting the net very cautiously,  Blinky put out his paw and made a sharp tug at the whiskers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page036.jpg" alt="tug" width="500" height="457"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Mr. Smifkins  jumped six feet in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whizzikins! What the dickens  was that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>As he shouted he made a leap out  of bed quite forgetting the mosquito-net over his head. Down it came, right  over him, tangling up his legs and arms. He seemed to have six pairs of legs  and dozens of arms.</p>
<p>Blinky made a dive under the bed,  terrified beyond words, and lay there panting with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy whiskers doing that!&rdquo; he  murmured.</p>
<p>The whole bed was shaking in an  alarming manner, and such terrible words and growls came from Mr. Smifkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To billy-o with this net!&rdquo; he  roared; while rips and kicks rent the air.</p>
<p>Just as the commotion was at its  worst Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s dog came round the corner, snarling and growling. Blinky did  not want to see what was going to happen. He raced from under the bed and down  off the veranda and right into the legs of Mrs. Smifkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burglars!&rdquo; she screamed at the  top of her voice, and kept on screaming.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Mr. Smifkins took  one leap off the veranda, the net all over him, and as he rushed along he waved  his arms, frantically trying to get rid of it.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page035.jpg" alt="net" width="578" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Poor Mrs. Smifkins took one look  and raced for her life round the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts! Ghosts!&rdquo; she yelled, as  she tore round to the back door, with Mr. Smifkins in hot pursuit. &ldquo;Help! Help!  Burglars! Ghosts!&rdquo; she kept calling at the top of her voice, and ran right into  old Neddy the draught-horse, who was snoozing under the kitchen window. He  looked up, surprised to hear such dreadful screams on such a quiet night, and  caught one glimpse of Mr. Smifkins coming round the corner.</p>
<p>Hoosh! Up went his hind legs and  with a frightened neigh he raced off for the paddock, crashing over the lettuce  bed, through the tomato frames, and away into the night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smifkins reached the back  door in a flash. Bang! and she was inside, still screaming &ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Mr. Smifkins was  using those strange words at the top of his voice. He roared like a bull and  made mad lunges at things that got in his way. Just as he rushed past the old  apple-tree the net caught in the branches and thank goodness it stayed there.  Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s dog added to the uproar with his yelps and barks and tried very  hard to bite his master&rsquo;s legs as the chase was in progress.</p>
<p>Panting and very, very cross, Mr.  Smifkins banged on the back door as his wife had locked him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; he roared. But  Mrs. Smifkins refused to open the door.</p>
<p>She <i>knew</i> it was a ghost she had  seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Smifkins thought of  the cause of all this trouble. What on earth could have pulled his whiskers? So  once again he set off to investigate.</p>
<p>Blinky was very thankful that Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s dog chased his master, as it gave him a chance to hide.</p>
<p>After colliding with Mrs. Smifkins  he was nearly collapsing with fright. Over the garden he rushed and through a  gate that had foolishly been left open. Here was shelter at last he thought, as  he saw a shed in front of him. Stumbling and rushing on he darted through a  hole in the wall, and&mdash;landed right in the middle of the fowl-house where all  the silly old hens and roosters were asleep. They cackled and crowed with  fright; fell off their perches, and floundered around all over the fowl-house  in the dark. You never heard such a row!</p>
<p>Somewhere Blinky was in the middle  of it. Feathers flew, and the old hens became hysterical. To make matters worse  Mr. Smifkins and his dog were coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you, whatever you are!&rdquo;  he called at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fox. I&rsquo;ll bet my hat it is!&rdquo; he  cried as he came nearer and nearer. Blinky was lucky in being able to see in  the dark and through the feathers and straw that flew about he spied a box in  the corner.</p>
<p>With a bound he was in, and, ugh!  something soft cracked under him. He did not know he was in a nest and had sat  on Mrs. Speckles&rsquo;s best egg. He lay there huddled up, straw and feathers all  over him, one eye peeping round the corner watching for Mr. Smifkins. It was a  terrible moment and his breath seemed to leave him altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens did I do with my  matches?&rdquo; Mr. Smifkins growled, as he crawled into the fowl-house. His entrance  caused more cackling and the poor old hens flapped about madly. They were not  used to midnight visitors. But Mr. Smifkins took no heed of the cackling and  squawking, he was determined to find the animal that had caused all this  disturbance. Worst of all he called his dog in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Bluey! Skeech him out of  it,&rdquo; he ordered at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>Bluey was a cattle-dog and it did  not take him many moments to nose his way to the nest.</p>
<p>Blinky scratched his nose as hard  as he could and kicked with all his might. Bluey yelped with pain and fright  and darted round to the back of the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me there!&rdquo; called Mr.  Smifkins, who had found his matches by now and was holding the light in his  hands. Carefully peering into the box he saw Blinky, shuddering with fright,  one paw raised, ready to scratch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo; Mr.  Smifkins cried in astonishment. &ldquo;A koala&mdash;of all things. You young beggar. Come  out of it my lad, and let me have a look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Blinky had no intention of  coming out. He growled louder and louder.</p>
<p>Mr. Smifkins bent his head lower  to have an extra good look at the mischief maker. At the same moment, Blinky  kicked out a bundle of straw, feathers, and a broken egg, right into Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s face. The match went out and&mdash;oh! Mr. Smifkins lost his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young devil!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You  bad young egg-stealer! You&rsquo;ll come along with me now, and I&rsquo;ll teach you how to  behave like a gentleman. Sneaking round a fellow&rsquo;s bed in the dark&mdash;frightening  the wits out of his wife and hens, and driving old Neddy into twenty fits all  at once. Come out of it or I&rsquo;ll rake you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky only huddled up all the  closer in the nest and growled his loudest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t come out!&rdquo; shouted  Mr. Smifkins, seizing the rake he kept to clean the fowl-house with. &ldquo;Out you  come, and no nonsense,&rdquo; he cried as he poked the end of the rake in the box.  Blinky bit it and scratched with rage. Mr. Smifkins poked harder and poked  Blinky right in the tummy.</p>
<p>This was too much for him. With a  scurry and flurry he bounded out of the box. But Mr. Smifkins was waiting and  grabbed him by a hind leg as he tried to dart past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you! I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; he  yelled. &ldquo;You bad young turnip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky was too angry to be  frightened any longer. He turned like lightning and bit Mr. Smifkins on the  arm, at the same time clawing and scratching for all he was worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice kettle of fish, you are!&rdquo;  Mr. Smifkins cried. &ldquo;Just wait a moment my boy, and we&rsquo;ll soon settle this  argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one hand firmly holding  Blinky&rsquo;s hind leg he managed with the other to take off his pyjama trousers.  Wrapping them tightly round Blinky, he crawled out of the fowl-house with a  struggling, kicking bundle under his arm.</p>
<p>He did look funny, as he walked  away, his shirt-tails flapping behind him and his pyjama coat torn in patches.</p>
<p>Blinky kicked and kicked; but it  was useless. He was held a prisoner. Goodness knows what would happen now.  Perhaps he would be made into rabbit pie as wise old Mr. Owl said.</p>
<p>Mr. Smifkins stumped home with a  very determined step, saying the most frightful things all the time. He  hammered on the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Mrs. Smifkins  called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door at once!&rdquo; her  husband replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught the burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any guns on him?&rdquo; she  asked in a frightened voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! but he&rsquo;s got claws like a  tiger,&rdquo; Mr. Smifkins replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep a tiger here!&rdquo; his  wife screamed. &ldquo;Shoot him! Kill him quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; Mr. Smifkins  roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m catching cold in the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very slowly the door opened an  inch or two and Mrs. Smifkins peered out with one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tiger?&rdquo; she asked  trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; said Mr. Smifkins,  pushing the door wide open with his foot and holding up the struggling bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is it?&rdquo; Mrs. Smifkins  asked, her eyes wide with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young bear, and a very lively  one, too!&rdquo; her husband replied as he walked into the kitchen and carefully  placed the bundle on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how beautiful!&rdquo; Mrs. Smifkins  cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him for a pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you!&rdquo; Blinky thought to  himself as he struggled to get free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as fat as a young pig,&rdquo; Mr.  Smifkins remarked as he untied the pyjama trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! He&rsquo;s in  knickerbockers,&rdquo; Mrs. Smifkins cried. &ldquo;He must belong to some child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Blinky was free. He looked  a sorry sight. Torn bockers, fur all rumpled, and straw and egg sticking all  over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give the poor little thing a  bath!&rdquo; said kind Mrs. Smifkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; thought  Blinky, as he darted away under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be wise to  bathe him to-night,&rdquo; Mr. Smifkins advised. &ldquo;Wait till the morning and we&rsquo;ll  have a good clean up then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will he sleep?&rdquo; Mrs.  Smifkins then asked. &ldquo;Will I take him in my bed? Or perhaps he&rsquo;d be happier in  yours, as he knows you better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To billy-o with the bed!&rdquo; said  Mr. Smifkins. &ldquo;Look what he&rsquo;s done to mine already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll find a nice little box  and he can stay here by the stove. That&rsquo;ll keep him warm and comfy,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Smifkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Mr.  Smifkins.</p>
<p>So a box was placed by the stove  with an old jacket in it to keep Blinky warm. But, he had been watching  preparations carefully, and had made up his mind that no box would be his bed,  as the last box caused him to be caught. He looked all round the kitchen trying  to find some way of escape, but there seemed to be none. The window was closed  and the door also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to your bed, little bear,&rdquo;  called Mrs. Smifkins kindly.</p>
<p>Blinky only grunted savagely and  glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the little chap alone,  he&rsquo;ll find his way into the box when we put the light out.&rdquo; So Mr. Smifkins and  his wife said good night to Blinky, turned out the lamp, closed the door again  and were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; sighed Blinky.  &ldquo;Now I can explore.&rdquo; He waited till his little heart stopped pounding so  loudly, then softly crept from under the table. There was the box, all cosy and  warm. Blinky took one look at it, growled, and walked around the kitchen to see  if there was a way of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he thought, as he came to a  door not quite shut, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where I escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing his little fat body  through the opening he was disappointed to find himself in another room, much  smaller, with rows and rows of shelves running all round it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a shop!&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out what&rsquo;s in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing on a chair he stood on  tiptoe and had a good look all round.</p>
<p>There were dozens of jars of jam  and preserves, boxes with lids on, bags filled with things, and piles of apples  and oranges.</p>
<p>He sniffed an orange, and felt it  with his paw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the smell of it,&rdquo; he thought, then finding he could  squeeze himself on to the shelf, he had a look at the bottles of jam.</p>
<p>Plum, apricot, orange, peach,  loganberry, pineapple, and melon. Each bottle was labelled. But Blinky did not  stop to read the name&mdash;he did not know the meaning anyhow. So the quickest way,  he thought, to find out the contents was to taste. The plum jam was the  nearest. Breaking the paper top with his claws he dipped his paw in and scooped  up the lovely red jam. He tasted it, licked his lips and decided to try the  next bottle. Loganberry it was labelled; scratching away the top, in went his  paw and out came the sticky jam. It dropped all over the shelf and down  Blinky&rsquo;s front. But it was good! So the next bottle must be tasted. Every pot  of jam was sampled, and that naughty bear&rsquo;s paws and face were covered with a  mixture unlike anything ever seen before. All his pretty fur on his chest and  tummy dripped jam. Every bottle was covered with the sticky stuff and the shelf  too. As he carefully walked in and out of the things on the shelf he left jammy  foot-prints behind.</p>
<p>He quite forgot to look for an  escape as he was having such a glorious time.</p>
<p>Suddenly he caught sight of a dish  full of eggs. &ldquo;They look funny things. I must see what they are,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Patting one with his paw he found  it cold and hard, and decided to taste it; but he could not catch it in his paw  so put out his claws to get a firmer hold.</p>
<p>Crack! The egg broke and out came  everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; laughed Blinky,  and gave another egg a smack with his paw. Crack! It went just like the other  one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! What silly things!&rdquo; And  Blinky laughed. Then he stood on his hind legs and with his two front paws came  down smack! smack! on all the eggs. Oh, what an awful mess there was! Eggs and  jam were all over his paws; and such nasty things, too, for a little bear to  have on his fur. He licked one paw after another to shake the sticky stuff off.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page044.jpg" alt="eggs" width="605" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Poor Mrs. Smifkins&rsquo;s best  tea-cups, standing so neatly on the shelf, in a jiffy were spattered with eggs  and jam.</p>
<p>Still exploring the wonderful  shelf, he found a jug of milk. In went the paw and up to his mouth. &ldquo;Um, um,&rdquo;  Blinky grunted, as he licked his paw all over. The milk tasted good, another  dip in the jug and another lick followed. Finding it so nice, he stuck his head  in the jug to have a good long drink. The milk was the best taste of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ker-chew! Ker-chew!&rdquo; Blinky  sneezed as the milk came up his nose, but he drank and drank until the jug was  empty. Then, grunting with satisfaction, he sat down to see what next he could  taste.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page045.jpg" alt="milk" width="400" height="481"></p>
<p>Some cakes under a wire cover  looked very nice, and just as Blinky was crawling along the shelf to try one,  he caught sight of a tiny mouse peeping out of his hole.</p>
<p>Blinky gave a grunt.</p>
<p>The mouse popped his head back in  his hole. In a few minutes he had another look out.</p>
<p>Blinky gave another grunt. But the  mouse became brave and gazed up at Blinky with bright little eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Bear,&rdquo; he said  in a tiny squeaking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Mouse,&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;What are you doing in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to look for my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like sticky things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Bear,&rdquo; the mouse  answered. &ldquo;I like cheese and crumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing in the world to  make your whiskers grow,&rdquo; the mouse replied. &ldquo;And I smell some somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come out of your hole and  I&rsquo;ll help you to find it,&rdquo; Blinky said boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t eat me, will you?&rdquo; the  little mouse asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blinky softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seen Mrs. Kookaburra eat dozens of your relations, but I don&rsquo;t like tails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find you some cheese, then,&rdquo;  said Mr. Mouse. &ldquo;And once you&rsquo;ve tasted it, you&rsquo;ll eat nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming out of his hole Mr. Mouse  scurried here and there; into corners he popped, and bags and boxes he&rsquo;d gnaw  so quickly and silently that Blinky was astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Mr. Mouse,&rdquo; he  whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down and help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very carefully he walked round the  shelf again, all through the sticky muddle until he reached the chair. He  climbed down, leaving jam everywhere. The pretty blue chair that Mrs. Smifkins  had just painted was decorated with paw marks and blobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fat bear you are!&rdquo; Mr.  Mouse remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had a nice drink,&rdquo;  Blinky replied. &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s this cheese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look over in that corner  behind the sugar-bin,&rdquo; Mr. Mouse advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go first,&rdquo; Blinky whispered.</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse scampered away and  Blinky saw his tail disappear round the bin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is! Come and smell,&rdquo; Mr.  Mouse called. Blinky crawled over to the corner, but he was far too big and fat  to squeeze round behind the sugar-bin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look,&rdquo; he said in a  whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, here it is, right in the  corner!&rdquo; Mr. Mouse said, pointing to a funny looking object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like wood to me,&rdquo; Blinky  replied as he squeezed his nose and eye round the end of the bin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks different to what it  usually is,&rdquo; said Mr. Mouse. &ldquo;But I can smell it, and the smell&rsquo;s the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick your paw in and see,&rdquo;  advised Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Mouse. &ldquo;You  keep an eye open for Mrs. Smifkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, then,&rdquo; said Blinky.  &ldquo;She may be in any minute.&rdquo; Really and truly he had forgotten all about the  Smifkinses, and now that Mr. Mouse mentioned them, he felt rather nervous.</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse crept closer to the  strange object. He put out his whiskers and sniffed. Yes, it was cheese, and no  mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab it,&rdquo; Blinky whispered.</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse became braver and made a  dart at the cheese.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! What was that?&rdquo; Blinky  asked, frightened beyond everything. Mr. Mouse made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; Blinky  asked again. But still Mr. Mouse did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you gobbling up all the  cheese?&rdquo; Blinky asked angrily. Still Mr. Mouse did not reply.</p>
<p>Becoming alarmed at his friend&rsquo;s  silence, Blinky pushed his other eye into the narrow space and&mdash;oh, how  dreadful! He turned pale with fright and sprang out of the corner.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Mouse was lying on the  floor, his head caught in the trap and his body as flat as a pancake. Even his  tail looked dead, Blinky thought. It lay so still and straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s cheese, I don&rsquo;t  want any,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m getting out of this Smifkins place.  It is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page048.jpg" alt="trap" width="400" height="439"></p>
<p>Trembling with fright and still  quite pale, he pattered around the pantry, and imagine his joy when he saw a  tiny window open not far above the shelf. He wasted no time in climbing up  again, and in his excitement knocked down Mrs. Smifkins&rsquo;s very best fruit dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; he said as he took a  hurried glance at the broken dish. &ldquo;Serves her right for killing Mr. Mouse.&rdquo; Up  to the window-ledge he climbed. It was a very small window, just large enough  as it happened for him to squeeze through, and best of all, outside stood a big  gum-tree, with one branch right up against the window. Blinky was in that tree  in no time. But when he had time to think about matters, he thought it wisest  to go right away from the Smifkinses&rsquo; house; so softly he climbed down out of  the tree. Over the orchard he went, and back into the bush again.</p>
<p>Oh, dear! it was beautiful to see  all the gum-trees again. And he felt very, very happy as he heard the different  birds calling to one another just as day broke. Finding a comfortable tree, one  that was very tall and straight, he climbed to the topmost branch and there,  cuddled up in a corner, closed his tired little eyes and went to sleep.</p>

  Blinky Meets Willie Wagtail</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page050.jpg" alt="four" width="500" height="217"></p>
<p>Tug, tug, tug. &ldquo;Whatever is that?&rdquo;  Blinky thought as he opened his eyes and looked around, still feeling rather  sleepy. Something had pulled his ear.</p>
<p>Before he had time to make quite  sure that he was not dreaming, another tug fully awakened him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be Mr. Smifkins again,&rdquo;  he wondered, and carefully put up his paw to feel his ear.</p>
<p>Imagine his surprise when he felt  a little bird, and screwing up his eyes he tried to see what cheeky fellow was  trying to nest there.</p>
<p>All he could see was a very pretty  tail that kept bobbing about, first in one direction and then in another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I know who you are!&rdquo; Blinky  said very cheerily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Willie Wagtail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry I woke you, Mr. Koala, but I&rsquo;m in such a hurry to finish my nest. My wife  is growing quite impatient because she wants to lay her eggs and the nest is  not quite ready. Do you mind if I gather a few more hairs from your ears? They  are so silky and pretty, and besides, I think the colour will look very well  with the grass I have gathered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Blinky answered. &ldquo;Only  don&rsquo;t pull too many at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; Willie  replied. &ldquo;You know it is very difficult to gather the necessary materials for  our nest right here in the middle of the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; Blinky inquired, as  the tug, tug at his ears proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no cattle or sheep,&rdquo;  Willie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use are they to you?&rdquo; said  Blinky curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we gather the hair from the  cows&rsquo; and horses&rsquo; backs, and the wool from the sheep,&rdquo; Willie Wagtail  explained. &ldquo;It makes a nest so cosy when lined with wool, and of course the  hair binds the grass together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull so hard!&rdquo; Blinky cried  impatiently. &ldquo;And for goodness&rsquo; sake keep that tail of yours still.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page053.jpg" alt="pull" width="560" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Willie in an  apologetic voice. &ldquo;I forgot for the moment that I was plucking a bear&rsquo;s ears  and not a cow&rsquo;s back. Their hair is much harder to pull. Do you know, I  actually pulled hair from the back of Mr. Smifkins&rsquo;s cat once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was rather a daring thing  to do,&rdquo; Willie replied. &ldquo;But the cat did not seem to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever try pulling Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s whiskers?&rdquo; Blinky asked with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious, no! I wouldn&rsquo;t  be so bold!&rdquo; Willie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did,&rdquo; said naughty  Blinky, &ldquo;and he did get cross. In fact, he went quite mad for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a brave bear,&rdquo; said  Willie. And he gave an extra sharp tug at Blinky&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Blinky cried.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave me bald soon; and I&rsquo;ve been very kind to give you so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, indeed,&rdquo; Willie said  politely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how pleased Mrs. Wagtail will be with these hairs.  They are quite a novelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often does your wife lay  eggs?&rdquo; Blinky inquired. &ldquo;Because if you are short at any time I know where you  can get heaps and heaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lays them twice a year,&rdquo;  Willie replied. &ldquo;But I never know the day when she will stop, so I&rsquo;d be pleased  to know where I could find some&mdash;just in case of emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you fly into Mrs.  Smifkins&rsquo;s pantry,&rdquo; advised Blinky, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see dozens and dozens of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Willie  Wagtail. &ldquo;I wonder if my wife has been &lsquo;laying away&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page052.jpg" alt="strange" width="450" height="354"></p>
<p>&ldquo;These are huge eggs, some white  and some brown,&rdquo; explained Blinky, who began to realize he may have said something  that was not quite right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then they are none of ours,&rdquo;  said Willie. &ldquo;You mean hen eggs, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said  Blinky, &ldquo;because now I come to think of it, I sat on one in a nest in the  fowl-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Whatever did Mr. Smifkins  say?&rdquo; Willie asked in a shocked tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing at all!&rdquo; Blinky  carelessly murmured. &ldquo;By the way, Willie, what do you do with all your  children? You must have hundreds of them by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Willie, very  seriously. &ldquo;But as soon as they are old enough to feed and take care of  themselves, we shoo them off. One can&rsquo;t feed dozens of birds all the time, you  know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my mother has only me for a  child, and she says: &lsquo;Thank goodness there are no more.&rsquo; That is, of course,  when she is angry with me. But at other times she says: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d  do without my son. I wish I had more.&rsquo;&ldquo; Blinky&rsquo;s eyes had a far-away look in  them as he talked to Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like all mothers,&rdquo;  said Willie Wagtail, knowingly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to be going, or I&rsquo;ll get into  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of those hairs,&rdquo; Blinky  called as Willie flew off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall,&rdquo; called back  Willie, and Blinky watched him as he darted this way and that until he was out  of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice little fellow,&rdquo; said  Blinky softly, still watching the trees through which his friend had flown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. Were you  speaking to me?&rdquo; said a tiny voice.</p>
<p>Blinky turned round in surprise.  He thought he was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Miss Possum! How  are you?&rdquo; he said bravely. He was not going to let anyone see he had been  startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you,&rdquo; Miss  Possum replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long way from home, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not so very far,&rdquo; said  naughty Blinky. &ldquo;Anyway, a change of trees is good for a chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; agreed Miss Possum,  &ldquo;providing you&rsquo;re in the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a private tree?&rdquo; Blinky  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Miss Possum  replied. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t allow all the ragtag to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the ragtag?&rdquo; Blinky  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s Mrs. Snake, and old  Granny Goanna, and a few more grumbly things. We don&rsquo;t want them in our tree.  They&rsquo;re always crotchety and creeping around, peering round corners when we  least expect them; and their eyes seem to be everywhere. If we make the least  noise, they complain and hiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you push them out?&rdquo;  Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; said Miss Possum  proudly. &ldquo;And what do you think we found when they had gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Blinky said  carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They left a note to say that they  would come back some day and steal our babies.&rdquo; And Miss Possum&rsquo;s eyes nearly  dropped out with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old thieves,&rdquo; Blinky  exclaimed. &ldquo;Old Granny Goanna would eat a possum as soon as look at it, and as  for Mrs. Snake, she tried to kill me when I was a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; cried Miss Possum.  &ldquo;What do you think we could do to frighten them away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky thought very hard for a  minute, his nose wrinkled and his eyes blinking rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll dig a  big hole at the bottom of the tree and when the rain comes it will fill, and  then, when they come to steal the babies, they&rsquo;ll fall in and be drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Snake and Granny Goanna  can swim,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Possum disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said  Blinky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could carry stones up the tree  and when they come along, pelt them with big ones and kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t carry stones and climb as  well,&rdquo; Miss Possum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Blinky said  impatiently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go and see Mr. Owl. Perhaps he could think of  something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you if you&rsquo;d like  me to,&rdquo; Miss Possum said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  manage by myself, and I&rsquo;ll be back before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the tree he climbed and  scrambled through the bush, gazing up at every tall gum-tree in search of Mr.  Owl. Presently he heard away in the distance a soft &ldquo;Whoo, whoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; thought Blinky and  hurried along as fast as he could. Nearer and nearer came the call of Mr. Owl,  and in a very short time Blinky saw him sitting away up in a very high tree. He  trotted along to the tree, and then began to climb. Half-way up, just as he  reached the lowest branch, Mr. Owl flew down to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, little friend,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve returned safely from Mr. Smifkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Blinky, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve  come to ask you a very serious question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; the old owl  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Possum is very frightened,&rdquo;  Blinky explained. &ldquo;She says that Mrs. Snake and old Granny Goanna are going to  steal the babies, and we don&rsquo;t know what to do. Could you advise us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! whoo!&rdquo; Mr. Owl said, as his  eyes opened wider than ever. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a wicked old pair. Just you wait a moment  while I go away to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear old Mr. Owl flew into a  branch higher up. Here he sat very, very still, gazing at nothing really. His  eyes never blinked, and not a feather on his body stirred. Presently he shook  his head and called &ldquo;whoo! whoo!&rdquo; then down he flew to where Blinky was  waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought of something?&rdquo;  Blinky asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little bear,&rdquo; replied Mr.  Owl. &ldquo;But tell me first, do you know where Percy Bull Ant lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go to him and tell him  everything,&rdquo; Mr. Owl said softly. &ldquo;You can say I sent you, and give him my  respects at the same time. Tell him I thought the matter over, and decided that  an army of his relations, if hidden in suitable places, could suddenly march  out and attack Mrs. Snake and Granny Goanna, as they come to steal the babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea,&rdquo; cried  Blinky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of it. Good-bye, Mr. Owl, and thank  you ever so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! whoo!&rdquo; said Mr. Owl, and  flew off immediately.</p>
<p>Blinky hurried through the bush in  the direction of Percy Bull Ant&rsquo;s home. All along the way he passed the homes  of Percy&rsquo;s relations, and as hundreds lived in one nest he could see a very  large army mustered when they all marched to fight the old robbers. Not a bull  ant was to be seen above ground, they were all so busy in their homes, nursing  the babies, storing the food, and cleaning out the parlour.</p>
<p>At last Blinky reached Percy&rsquo;s  home. It was not much to look at. A litter of tiny sticks and twigs, small  pieces of charcoal, loose sand and clay, all heaped in a mound; and everything  about it looked very dry and ugly. It certainly looked quite harmless, just as  other mounds did; but as Blinky gave a poke at it with his paw, it instantly  bristled with life. Angry ants rushed out from nowhere, big red fellows,  bristling with indignation, to see who had had the impudence to disturb their  peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Percy Bull Ant,&rdquo; said Blinky  as he cautiously moved backwards a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come with a message for you  from Mr. Owl, and he sends his respects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ant larger than the rest  advanced to Blinky and eyed him curiously, still waving a leg in a dangerous  manner, and a nasty fighting look about his whole body. Blinky did not feel too  safe and moved another step backwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Percy,&rdquo; he said very  politely, &ldquo;kindly put that leg of yours down, and don&rsquo;t look so bristly.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page062.jpg" alt="leg" width="582" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Blinky Bill, aren&rsquo;t you,  if I&rsquo;m not mistaken?&rdquo; said Percy Bull Ant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Blinky. &ldquo;And  for goodness&rsquo; sake send all your brothers back in their nest. I feel quite  nervous. They seem to have such a lot of legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re harmless,&rdquo; said Percy  in an off-hand manner. &ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;ll do as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to your work, all of you!&rdquo;  ordered Percy, and instantly they disappeared back to nowhere. &ldquo;Now, my lad,  tell me what Mr. Owl said.&rdquo; And Percy carelessly picked up a stick and started  chewing the end of it, his head on one side and his wicked big eyes pausing to  gaze at Blinky in a cold rude manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Percy,&rdquo; Blinky began,  &ldquo;Miss Possum is very frightened. Mrs. Snake and Granny Goanna are coming to  steal all the babies that live in her tree. She&rsquo;s nearly dead with fright, and  fainted twice while I was speaking to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; said Percy Bull Ant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Percy, it&rsquo;s very serious,  and Mr. Owl thought the best thing to do would be for you to gather all your  relations together and fight the old robbers when they came for the babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; said Percy, as he threw down  the stick he had been chewing, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s their caper, is it? Well, I&rsquo;ll hold a  meeting and let you know what we decide to do about it. Hold on a minute, I&rsquo;ll  not be long.&rdquo; And Percy disappeared into nowhere.</p>
<p>Blinky waited patiently, keeping  his eyes glued on the ant-nest. He did not trust any of them.</p>
<p>In a very short time Percy  appeared again and slowly advanced to Blinky with a decided tread. His head was  downcast, and anyone at a glance could see he was deep in thought. He kicked a  grain of sand out of his pathway, and nearly fell over a tiny ball of clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ants&rsquo; pants!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I  nearly broke my big toe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Blinky in a  whisper, as he did not feel a little bit safe. Percy Bull Ant was such a queer  fellow. Good-natured one moment, and bad tempered the next; in fact, he was  what is known as temperamental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite all right, old fellow,&rdquo;  said Percy. &ldquo;Some careless ant has left things about where they&rsquo;ve no business  to be. Now about this matter of the babies. I&rsquo;ve had a talk to all the young  bloods down there, and they&rsquo;re keen for a fight. At the moment they are  sharpening their nippers and filling up with poison at the bowser. How would a  couple of thousand warriors do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Blinky, dancing  around with glee. &ldquo;How pleased Miss Possum will be! And I hope you kill Mrs.  Snake and old Granny Goanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said Percy,  winking an eye.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page059.jpg" alt="leave" width="400" height="430"></p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you come?&rdquo; Blinky  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few moments,&rdquo; Percy replied.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better lead the way, or get back as quickly as you can. When the boys  are on the fighting track they&rsquo;re pretty nasty.&rdquo; Blinky did not wait to hear  more. He hurried as fast as he could. The more distance between Percy&rsquo;s boys  and himself the better for any bear, he thought. He puffed as he ran, and felt  terribly hot, but came to the tree where Miss Possum waited in a very excited  state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly dead with fright,&rdquo; she  called from the topmost branch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Snake is not far away. I can  almost smell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; Blinky  exclaimed as he excitedly climbed the tree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve good news for you,&rdquo; he said  as he plumped himself down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Do tell me,&rdquo; she  cried excitedly as she clapped her paws together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Blinky, with a brave  air, &ldquo;Percy Bull Ant is bringing along two thousand soldiers. They&rsquo;ll be here  any minute now and then Mrs. Snake and Granny Goanna will be feeling pretty  sick I think. They&rsquo;re coming armed to the teeth, with a fresh supply of poison  and extra sharp nippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo; said Miss  Possum, blushing, and Blinky just managed in time to avoid being hugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  ever dare to do that again. I&rsquo;ll tell Percy if you do, and he&rsquo;ll set all his  boys on to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, <i>please!</i>&rdquo; cried  Miss Possum. &ldquo;I was so excited for the moment, that I quite forgot you were a  bear, and grown up, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bold of you!&rdquo; said Blinky  sternly. &ldquo;And, anyhow, I hate girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful,&rdquo; sighed Miss  Possum. &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come! Here come the  soldiers!&rdquo; shouted Blinky, as he danced up and down and nearly knocked Miss  Possum out of the tree.</p>
<p>Blinky was right. Percy Bull Ant  marched at the head of a vast army, bent on business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left, right, left, right,&rdquo; Percy  called. There seemed to be hundreds of thousands of bull ants as they advanced  along the pathway. Everything scurried out of their way. Lizards rushed  helter-skelter and many dropped their tails with fright. Some of the soldiers  stopped to taste the tails; but, Percy, catching sight of them, ordered in a  stern voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No eating at present. Drop the  loot and attend to business.&rdquo; The ants cast wistful eyes at the tails they had  to leave behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such waste!&rdquo; they murmured to one  another.</p>
<p>When they came to the foot of the  tree where Blinky and Miss Possum were sitting, Percy gave his order in a  ringing voice and he looked every inch a soldier, as he stood as stiff as a  poker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he called. Immediately the  long line came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form fours!&rdquo; he ordered, and the soldiers  obeyed in a twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers 674 and 675 stop kicking,  and stand to attention. Now, boys,&rdquo; Percy called, &ldquo;listen to me, and carefully  follow my instructions. There&rsquo;s to be no fighting among yourselves. Keep your  nippers sharp, and don&rsquo;t waste your poison, as you&rsquo;ll need it later on. When I  give the order, advance four at a time and climb half-way up this tree. Each  four must take its place until the trunk of the tree is a living mass of  soldiers. When Mrs. Snake and Granny Goanna come along wait for my order to  advance. Keep perfectly still; don&rsquo;t blink an eye; then, when I call out  &lsquo;Charge!&rsquo; fight and poison with all your might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, captain!&rdquo; came the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present, stand at ease,&rdquo;  Percy called.</p>
<p>Every ant lounged in the most  amusing way. Some twisted hind legs round one another; others leaned on his  neighbour&rsquo;s shoulder, and many were tempted to use their nippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention,&rdquo; called Percy.  Instantly heels clicked, and there stood the bristling army ready for attack.  &ldquo;Advance,&rdquo; he ordered in an anty voice. &ldquo;Left, right, left, right&mdash;keep in  step&mdash;left, right.&rdquo; Up the tree they swarmed; nearer and nearer to Blinky and  Miss Possum they came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s climb higher,&rdquo; Blinky  whispered. &ldquo;They look so dreadful.&rdquo; So Miss Possum immediately took his advice  and a higher branch was sought.</p>
<p>Percy waited at the foot of the  tree, watching and ordering the army into position, until the last ant was off  the ground. The tree was a living mass of bull ants, right up to the first  branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; roared Percy as he  gazed at the soldiers; then creeping very quietly away into the bushes, he lay  in wait for the robbers.</p>
<p>He had not to wait long. Presently  a hissing and slithering announced the coming of Mrs. Snake and her companion.  Percy kept very, very still and listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You steal Mrs. Ringtail&rsquo;s baby  and I&rsquo;ll steal Mrs. Siever&rsquo;s,&rdquo; whispered old Granny Goanna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fine supper they&rsquo;ll make,&rdquo;  hissed Mrs. Snake. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach them a lesson for chasing us out of the  tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly they crept nearer and  nearer, and Percy Bull Ant quivered with rage. He tiptoed back to the tree and  called in a very quiet voice: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming, boys; prepare to kill and  poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not an ant stirred. The tree  looked lifeless, and Percy hid behind a stone at the foot.</p>
<p>Hiss! Hiss! Along came the old  robbers; stealthily they crept through the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tenth joint in my tail is  rather stiff,&rdquo; grumbled Mrs. Snake. &ldquo;It makes things very awkward for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nails are not as sharp as they  were,&rdquo; replied Granny Goanna, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve a few good teeth left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer the tree they came, and  both paused to whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Granny Goanna,  &ldquo;that the tree looks redder than usual. Do you think we&rsquo;ve made a mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Snake.  &ldquo;This is the right tree. Don&rsquo;t I know it well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my eyesight must be  failing,&rdquo; sighed Granny Goanna, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ll bet my last scale that the tree  looks very red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mrs. Snake  impatiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no doubt got dust in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe,&rdquo; sighed Granny Goanna,  as she floundered along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, boys, be ready for  your order,&rdquo; called Percy in a whisper.</p>
<p>Right along to the bottom of the  tree came the two old robbers. Old Granny was actually licking her lips, as she  thought of the supper in store. She slobbered at the very idea of a baby  possum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, dear,&rdquo; she called to  Mrs. Snake. &ldquo;Everything is quiet and safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go first,&rdquo; whispered Mrs.  Snake, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granny Goanna placed her two front  legs on the tree and prepared to climb. Mrs. Snake waved her wicked head to and  fro and gave Granny a nudge which had the desired effect, for she made a plunge  and lifted her hind legs from the ground. Mrs. Snake gave a wriggle and started  up behind her.</p>
<p>Percy Bull Ant sprang out from his  hiding-place and called in a terrible voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like lightning, the whole tree  became alive. The soldiers sprang at the enemy. In a second they were swarming  all over Granny Goanna and Mrs. Snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my tail!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Snake  as she tried to wriggle away, lashing her body in the air in agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake save me, save  me!&rdquo; moaned Granny Goanna, as she hissed until all her hisses had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for them, boys!&rdquo; shouted  Percy. &ldquo;Kill them as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No order was necessary, as the  ants covered the robbers from head to tail. They bit with all their power.  Several were killed as Mrs. Snake&rsquo;s tail and Granny Goanna&rsquo;s lashed them  against the tree; but the numbers seemed never to end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! I&rsquo;m dying!&rdquo; groaned Mrs.  Snake, and she fell with a thud to the ground. In another second down plopped  Granny Goanna, as dead as a door-nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat them up!&rdquo; ordered Percy. At  once the feast started, and hungry soldiers bit and ate all through the night  until only skeletons of the two wicked old things were left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we went down and had a  look,&rdquo; said Blinky to Miss Possum, just as daylight was dawning. So, scrambling  down excitedly, they were just in time to see Percy marshalling his soldiers in  readiness to depart.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page065.jpg" alt="down" width="568" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;How is that for good work?&rdquo; said  Percy Bull Ant proudly, as he pointed to the skeletons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Miss Possum and  Blinky together. &ldquo;Your soldiers are very brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a husky lot,&rdquo; said Percy,  blowing out his chest. &ldquo;Would you care to have a look at our homes? They&rsquo;re  very interesting, although you may not be received with open arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; replied  Blinky nervously, &ldquo;but I really must hurry home now. I&rsquo;ve been away for a long  time and I&rsquo;m sure I can hear my mother calling me this very minute.&rdquo; And he  began shuffling about very uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; called Percy, as  he gave the order to march, much to the relief of Blinky and Miss Possum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; sighed Blinky. &ldquo;That was a  narrow squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re awfully clever,&rdquo;  said Miss Possum. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to come back and meet my mother. She&rsquo;d be  so pleased to thank you for saving the babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Blinky,  looking very important. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve such a lot of people to see before I go home.  Good-bye.&rdquo; And hurriedly looking around him, he darted into the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid creature!&rdquo; he muttered to  himself. &ldquo;All possums are silly, specially girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Where are you going?&rdquo; Oh,  dear, whatever was that? The bush seemed to be full of voices when one least  expected them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Blinky called. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just here,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>Then something pricked Blinky&rsquo;s  paw and gave him such a fright that he fell head over heels in the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! What a stupid  fellow you are!&rdquo; said the voice.</p>
<p>Thoroughly annoyed, Blinky picked  himself up and gazed about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Hedgehog!&rdquo; he cried  gladly. &ldquo;You did give me a fright. I thought for a moment one of Percy Bull  Ant&rsquo;s soldiers had bitten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hedgehog raised his bristles  in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d hurt  you on purpose. Where are you going, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; said Blinky meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you run away?&rdquo; Mr. Hedgehog  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I just wanted to see a  friend,&rdquo; Blinky replied coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see my home. It&rsquo;s so  snug and cosy,&rdquo; said Mr. Hedgehog, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure you must be tired. You could  have a sleep and then, when the moon rises, go on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like to, Mr. Hedgehog,  if it&rsquo;s not very far away, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m dreadfully tired,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just over here,&rdquo; said Mr.  Hedgehog, &ldquo;in amongst that bracken fern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said  Blinky, as Mr. Hedgehog led the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hedgehog is such a long word  to say. Couldn&rsquo;t I call you something else?&rdquo; Blinky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally called Spikey round  here,&rdquo; Mr. Hedgehog replied. &ldquo;Mrs. Snake is called &lsquo;Snakey&rsquo;; Miss Goanna,  &lsquo;Ganna&rsquo;; Mr. Wombat, &lsquo;Womby&rsquo;; and Miss Wallaby, &lsquo;Walley&rsquo;. So what does it  matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know Mrs. Snake and  Granny Goanna were killed?&rdquo; Blinky said in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Is that true?&rdquo;  Spikey could hardly believe his ears. &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Percy Bull Ant and his  soldiers!&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s great news,&rdquo; said  Spikey. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only known about it in time, what a feast of ants I&rsquo;d have  had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t eat ants, do you?&rdquo;  Blinky asked, his eyes nearly popping out of his head.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page069.jpg" alt="ants" width="500" height="373"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I should just say I do. Why,  they&rsquo;re the finest meal I know of&mdash;except perhaps a few fat worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Don&rsquo;t you eat gum-tips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of those things  to me?&rdquo; Spikey laughed scornfully. &ldquo;But I can tell you like them. You smell  like a gum-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you smell like a thousand  ants!&rdquo; said Blinky rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; Spikey replied. &ldquo;Why I  haven&rsquo;t had more than six dozen to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they must have been the  smelly kind, &rsquo;cause you do smell of ants,&rdquo; Blinky answered sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at my house, and don&rsquo;t be so  grumpy. Isn&rsquo;t it a beautiful place?&rdquo; And Spikey raised all his quills with  pride.</p>
<p>Blinky bent down to peep inside,  just as Spikey raised his quills, and gave a loud cry of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my nose!&rdquo; he screamed.  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;ve got a nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one could miss it for one  minute,&rdquo; Spikey said, very annoyed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly your whole face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky felt very angry and raised  his paw to hit Spikey; but the quills bristled more than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put those things down?&rdquo;  he asked in a very rude manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you ask me nicely I  will,&rdquo; Spikey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, <i>please</i> put those things  away,&rdquo; Blinky said. But he still felt very annoyed. His nose was actually  bleeding where the spike had pierced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your handkerchief,&rdquo; Spikey  advised.</p>
<p>Blinky grabbed the torn leg of his  knickerbockers and wiped his poor little nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come inside and rest,&rdquo; said  Spikey as he flattened all his bristles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look very nice now,&rdquo; Blinky  remarked as he crawled inside the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cosy!&rdquo; Spikey said  proudly, as he curled himself up in a ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very pretty and warm,&rdquo;  Blinky replied as he looked around.</p>
<p>The house was just a snug hole  under the bracken fern. A few twigs and dried grass helped to make it cosy, and  no one could believe that a little home was hidden away under the ferns so  safely.</p>
<p>The sun made everything warm, and  a drowsy little bear fell asleep, in a nest not meant for koalas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Lyre-Bird&rsquo;s Home</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page072.jpg" alt="five" width="500" height="217"></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky rubbed his eyes. Where was  he? Oh, yes, of course. There was Spikey standing a few feet away eyeing him  very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel hungry?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. And I&rsquo;m going to look  for some supper,&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;These nests are all very well for folk like  you, but I like my own home best. I&rsquo;ve only to wake up and climb a few branches  and my supper is all there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going ant-hunting now,  so I&rsquo;ll bid you good night,&rdquo; and Spikey raised all his quills and proceeded to  walk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Wait a moment,&rdquo; Blinkey  called. &ldquo;I want you to show me the way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going the other way,&rdquo; Spikey  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; Blinky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the Lyre-bird&rsquo;s home,&rdquo;  Spikey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I come, too?&rdquo; Blinky asked  in his most polite tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you can,&rdquo; Spikey replied.  It was certainly not a very pressing invitation, but Blinky was a bear who  poked himself everywhere, whether welcome or not. He was out to see the world,  and if he waited for invitations&mdash;well, he&rsquo;d see very little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. But don&rsquo;t start any  capers, because I feel rather bilious to-night,&rdquo; Spikey said in an irritable  way. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to give up eating sugar ants. This is the second time  they&rsquo;ve upset me lately, and my head&rsquo;s splitting.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page070.jpg" alt="follow" width="800" height="581"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; Blinky answered.  &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you? Mrs. Grunty always has bad headaches,  specially when she&rsquo;s been extra nasty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she do for them?&rdquo;  Spikey inquired as he slowly crawled along, dragging one leg after the other in  a very painful manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she just wants us all to fuss  around her, and pretend we&rsquo;re awfully sorry. But I&rsquo;m terribly glad and wish  she&rsquo;d have two headaches all at once,&rdquo; Blinky retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very kind,&rdquo; Spikey  mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you shouldn&rsquo;t eat ants.  It&rsquo;s a wonder you don&rsquo;t get tummy ache, too!&rdquo; said naughty Blinky. &ldquo;But I  s&rsquo;pose it couldn&rsquo;t get in your tummy through all those spikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Spikey roared in  anger, and his quills stood straight up and quivered with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Blinky,  quite frightened. &ldquo;But those spikes sticking out of you from everywhere, must  be the cause of your headaches. What if someone stroked you the wrong way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hump!&rdquo; growled Spikey. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d  better not try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very far away to the  Lyre-bird&rsquo;s home?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; his friend replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  travel far from my home, just keep on behind me and you&rsquo;ll be surprised how  soon we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little animals pattered along,  brushing the ferns and grass aside as they went. The moon showed the way,  shining through the trees and only the soft pad, pad of Blinky could be heard.</p>
<p>Suddenly quite close at hand a  kookaburra laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacko&rsquo;s very merry to-night!&rdquo;  Blinky remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Jacko,&rdquo; Spikey  replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mrs. Lyre-bird. She&rsquo;s so clever at mimicking all the bush  birds that sometimes she deceives me for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be clever,&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;I could bet that was Jacko laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s mighty clever,&rdquo; Spikey  replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard her mimic the butcher-birds so that you couldn&rsquo;t tell the  difference; and she simply loves to call like the magpie and old Mr. Owl. There  isn&rsquo;t a noise in the bush that she can&rsquo;t imitate. Why! One night when I was  prowling round, looking for a few ants I got a terrible fright. I made sure Mr.  Smifkins&rsquo;s dog was chasing me. The yelping and barking drew closer and closer  as I neared the Lyre-bird&rsquo;s home, and I hurried along, to see if they would  shelter me. Imagine my surprise when I found Mrs. Lyre-bird imitating the  Smifkinses&rsquo; dog. I was very annoyed at first, as I was all out of breath, and  hot, and my bristles were cold with fright. But it was a relief all the same to  find I had been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Mrs. Lyre-bird how  she had frightened you?&rdquo; Blinky asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she only laughed. She  said she&rsquo;d frightened many bush folk that way; and just to show me how really  clever she was she made a noise like Mr. Smifkins chopping wood. Then, seeing  me more surprised, she pretended to strike matches. I had to laugh. It sounded  so funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Blinky  stopped still, and listened very closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a train coming up the  hill,&rdquo; Spikey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no trains here,&rdquo; Blinky  answered. &ldquo;Chuff, chuff, chuff, chuff,&rdquo; came the noise again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they must have put a train  here in the night,&rdquo; Spikey laughed, as they trotted along.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the chuff,  chuff until Blinky became quite frightened. He&rsquo;d never seen or heard a train in  his life and he wondered if it would eat him. He grew quite pale, and held on  to his knickerbockers very tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Spikey. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  tricked you, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Mrs. Lyre-bird?&rdquo; Blinky  was astounded. But before he could make any further remark, he saw with his own  eyes that Spikey was right.</p>
<p>At the feet of some tall trees a  wonderful sight was seen. Just close your eyes for a minute and try to imagine  you&rsquo;re in Blinky&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Great gum-trees standing erect,  with the moon peeping through the leaves, out of a blue, blue sky. The grass and  bracken a soft brown, fading away to grey, and right in front of you, only a  few yards distant four grown-up lyre-birds and six little ones.</p>
<p>A dancing lesson was in progress  and the ground was cleared for a little space, to give the dancers room to perform.  That is what Blinky saw, as he gazed at the enchanting scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; whispered Spikey. &ldquo;Keep  very quiet, and you&rsquo;ll see wonderful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mothers and fathers were  dancing in the daintiest way, stepping ever so lightly, and then running  backwards and forwards, pirouetting, bowing, and hopping, while the little ones  looked on, watching every movement, and occasionally giving a little squeak of  delight.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page075.jpg" alt="dancing" width="800" height="573"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Come, children,&rdquo; called Mrs.  Lyre-bird. &ldquo;It is time you learned to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little ones twittered with  delight, as they took their places in the centre of the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three; hop, skip, and a  jump,&rdquo; called one of their mothers, and the children very clumsily tried to  imitate their parents.</p>
<p>They toppled over one another,  fell on the ground and squawked with delight when one managed to pirouette for  a moment.</p>
<p>The parents were very patient and  showed them over and over again how to perform.</p>
<p>At last one little chap did a  surprisingly clever dance and the mothers and fathers became very excited, as  they danced up and down, encouraging the dancer, and calling to him all kinds  of nice things. As time went on the children became quite clever and the  dancing lesson ended with very happy results.</p>
<p>Nearby was the playground. Here a  wonderful collection of toys&mdash;in the shape of pretty leaves, pebbles, and bright  feathers&mdash;were spread on the ground. The children and the parents played all  kinds of games, until Blinky disturbed their peace and fun by stumbling over a  stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; he called as  the birds ran for safety. But all his pleadings and promises to be friendly  were useless. Being very timid, they vanished into the bushes and had no  intention of coming out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very scared!&rdquo; Blinky  remarked, as he turned to Spikey. But Spikey had vanished too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! The place must be haunted,&rdquo;  Blinky muttered to himself, as he nervously glanced around. &ldquo;A fellow&rsquo;s all by  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go home,&rdquo; he decided.  And he suddenly thought what a long time it was since he had left his mother  and Mrs. Grunty.</p>
<p>He looked at his bockers, and  tried to pat them, or what remained of them, into shape. They were just hanging  by threads, and a very sorry spectacle he looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose old Mother Grunty will  say all sorts of things when she sees me,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand  it any longer. If she growls very hard at me, I&rsquo;ll run away again&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll get  married next time. Then they&rsquo;ll be sorry, and want me home again.&rdquo; And Blinky  gave a savage kick at the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spikes and scissors! Look where  you&rsquo;re going with your big feet!&rdquo; a little voice cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; Blinky said, as  he came to a standstill. &ldquo;As if there&rsquo;s not enough growling without you  starting, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look what you&rsquo;ve done to my  web, and I&rsquo;ve been hours and hours weaving it. Now it&rsquo;s all spoilt, and I&rsquo;ll  never catch my supper, and I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you another ant-eater?&rdquo;  Blinky asked rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; snapped the spider.  &ldquo;I eat gnats and mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gnats! I&rsquo;ve never heard of them  before,&rdquo; Blinky said. &ldquo;Do they taste good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as good as you&rsquo;ll taste if  you don&rsquo;t get your big feet out of my way,&rdquo; the spider growled as he glared at  Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see you&rsquo;ve a red spot on  your back, so I think I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky very quietly stepped aside  and continued on his way. The moon was kind and showed him the pathway quite  clearly and he thought by travelling all night he would reach home by daylight.  But he had not considered what may be round the corner.</p>
<p>On he went, one minute feeling  very brave as he thought of what he&rsquo;d do to Mrs. Grunty if she grunted, and the  next, feeling rather frightened as he imagined her cross face round the  gum-tree.</p>
<p>Pit-a-pat! Pit-a-pat! Someone was  coming through the bush, and someone in a great hurry, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I&rsquo;ll be late, I&rsquo;ll be  late,&rdquo; said a voice that came nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Blinky called out from  behind a tree where he had hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the meeting,&rdquo; came the reply.  &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it got to do with you? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky cautiously peeped round the  tree and there stood Belinda Fox of all people, dressed in her best coat of  brown, with a very fine tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up to mischief, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo;  Blinky said as he came from his hiding-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Belinda Fox in  surprise. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve not tasted a fowl for ages and ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the meeting?&rdquo; Blinky  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at the flat, under the  trees,&rdquo; Belinda answered. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be later than ever if I stop and talk to  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on at the meeting?&rdquo; Blinky  called as Belinda started to walk away. &ldquo;Stop a moment and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those rabbits,&rdquo; Belinda  complained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re holding a meeting&mdash;a race-meeting, I mean&mdash;and I&rsquo;m just  about tired of their noise. So I&rsquo;m going to act as umpire, and the very first  one I catch, I&rsquo;ll eat, toes and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Blinky exclaimed.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling very annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annoyed is no name for it!&rdquo;  Belinda answered sharply. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about some juicy  gum-tips? They&rsquo;re scrumptious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Belinda grumbled.  &ldquo;Gum-tips, indeed! A juicy young rab is what I&rsquo;m after. So good night to you,  Mr. Koala. I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Blinky to himself,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry, too. I&rsquo;ll take a short cut down to the flat and tell the  rabbits all about it. Belinda Fox will have no young rab for supper if I can  help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dashing into the bush he scampered  along at a great rate.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page080.jpg" alt="raced" width="582" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Down the track, through the  saplings, and over the hill, until the flat came in view. There the bunnies  were&mdash;mothers and fathers and their babies, grandmothers and grandfathers and  bunny uncles and aunts. Such a crowd of them! And they scampered backwards and  forwards, frightfully excited, their little white tails bobbing about ever so  prettily and their long ears twitching with the thought of all the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I hope I&rsquo;m not too  late!&rdquo; Blinky thought, as he rushed down to the flat.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page081.jpg" alt="late" width="344" height="450"></p>
<p>A line of baby bunnies were  standing in a row, waiting for the signal to start the race.</p>
<p>Mr. Grandfather Rabbit stood at  the farther end of the flat against a blackberry-bush. He waited with one paw  raised, ready to wave a &ldquo;four o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; as the signal to start. The young rabs  were skylarking and delaying matters considerably, for just as everything  seemed ready for the word &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; some young scamp rushed away before his time  and then the whole line had to wait again until all was ready.</p>
<p>Blinky dashed across the flat and  right into the middle of the spectators. He was breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let  the babies go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once there was great  excitement. Rabbits scuffled and hopped around him, their eyes popping with  curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; they cried.  &ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t let the  babies race,&rdquo; Blinky gasped. &ldquo;Belinda Fox is coming along, and she&rsquo;s going to  catch the first one and eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiver my whiskers!&rdquo; a father rabbit  called out in alarm. &ldquo;That Belinda Fox is just a bit too smart. She&rsquo;s been  poking her nose round here too much lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up and do something,&rdquo;  Blinky cried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, dearie,&rdquo; piped up  old Great Granny Rabbit, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea, a splendid idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page082.jpg" alt="idea" width="340" height="450"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, granny?&rdquo; all the  rabbits asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a surprise for Miss Belinda  Fox. Just you wait here while I get it. I won&rsquo;t be a moment,&rdquo; and she hobbled  away to her burrow.</p>
<p>The rabbits crowded round the  entrance waiting to see what great granny&rsquo;s idea could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s one of those stale  old turnips she&rsquo;s been collecting for weeks,&rdquo; said one bold young rab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps an old tuft of grass,&rdquo;  another chimed in.</p>
<p>The rabbits danced with excitement  as they waited and one of them thumped impatiently on the door-way with his  hind leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, you silly old  pop-eye,&rdquo; said a big father sternly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s the alarm signal and  never come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But great granny rabbit was not a  scrap alarmed and presently she appeared tugging and pulling at something  almost as big as herself. The others rushed to her assistance and imagine their  surprise when they pulled out a dead rabbit, very fat, so fat indeed that he  looked as though he&rsquo;d had twenty suppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiskers!&rdquo; they exclaimed.  &ldquo;Where did you get this old fellow? What&rsquo;s he for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; great granny smiled;  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s very very old; but he&rsquo;ll make a fine supper for Belinda Fox. I&rsquo;ve had him  longer than any of you young fellows can remember, and I&rsquo;ve kept him for just  such an occasion as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very fat!&rdquo; Blinky said, as  he patted him with his paw. &ldquo;And&mdash;oh! he&rsquo;s prickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s prickly right enough,&rdquo; great  granny chuckled. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I stuffed him with Scotch thistles and nettles? Just  you wait and see the surprised look on Belinda&rsquo;s face when she takes the first  bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lovely, lovely! That&rsquo;s a  wonderful supper for Belinda!&rdquo; said the rabbits, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a hand to push him  along!&rdquo; great granny called.</p>
<p>She was nearly knocked over in the  rush, as all the rabbits scrambled and pushed, and tugged the old thing full of  prickles.</p>
<p>Away down to the flat they rolled  it, and over to where the bunny still stood with his paw raised ready to give  the signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prop him up here!&rdquo; great granny  called as she pointed to the blackberry-bush, &ldquo;and then Belinda Fox can have a  good look at him before she dines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rabbits all helped, and stood  old Prickles up on his hind legs. They placed one of his ears over the back of  his head and the other over one eye. Then they stuffed a few blades of grass in  his mouth to make him look just as though he were eating his supper. They  pushed him a little farther into the blackberry-bush so that he seemed to be  peeping out. Then, quite satisfied with all they had done, they scampered back  to the starting place. Just as they lined up, ready once more for the race,  Miss Belinda Fox strutted into view. Down she came lipperty-lop, lipperty-lop,  until she reached the bunnies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, young rabs,&rdquo; she  said politely, with a wicked smile on her face. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re having a race,  and a fine night you have for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Belinda,&rdquo; the  rabbits replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are,&rdquo; Belinda  replied, with a sly look at the babies. &ldquo;I came along to see if I could be  umpire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Blinky was telling us,&rdquo; said  an old rabbit, scratching his ear, and looking very unconcerned. &ldquo;Well, I think  it&rsquo;s a fine idea, and shows a very kind nature. We&rsquo;ve just been having an  argument as to who should act as umpire, and now the question is settled. We&rsquo;ll  gladly accept your services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell me what to do, and I&rsquo;ll  be only too pleased to help,&rdquo; Belinda replied with eyes glistening. Such a fine  plump lot of babies she&rsquo;d never seen before. What a feast she was going to  have!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their tails and all I&rsquo;ll gobble,&rdquo;  she thought to herself as she patted one gently on the nose.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page086.jpg" alt="tails" width="400" height="461"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll line up the babies,&rdquo; Blinky  said, as he trembled with excitement. &ldquo;And you, Belinda Fox, walk down to the  other end of the flat; and when we&rsquo;re ready, give the signal to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the signal?&rdquo; Belinda asked  slobbering all down her front, and showing her cruel teeth while eyeing the  babies all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just wag your tail, that&rsquo;ll  do,&rdquo; Blinky replied. Off raced Belinda Fox, down to the end of the flat. She  was so thrilled that she didn&rsquo;t bother to look around, but came to a halt just  in front of the blackberry-bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready,&rdquo; Blinky called to the  babies. &ldquo;But when you&rsquo;re half-way down the flat, run very slowly, and if  Belinda has not seen old Prickles by then, turn round and race back to your  burrows as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up. Can&rsquo;t you move things  along?&rdquo; Belinda called impatiently, as she waited, panting and moving about  restlessly. She turned suddenly to look behind as something made a scratching  noise. Now the cunning rabs had ordered one of their number to squat behind old  Prickles and at the right moment to scratch the ground, so that Belinda would  turn round to see for herself what a fine fat rabbit awaited her. Needless to  say, the scratcher was well hidden from view and ready to make his escape at a  moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Scratch, scratch, scratch, came  the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gobble me up!&rdquo; Belinda exclaimed  in rapture, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s not a fine supper right under my very nose, and much  fatter than the babies all put together! The silly old grass-eater must be  blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretending she did not see  Prickles, she hastily turned round and faced the crowd at the far end, but she  kept old Prickles in view out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>Such a fine supper was not going  to escape her, she thought and dribbled most terribly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silly old flop ears,&rdquo; she  remarked aloud, &ldquo;fancy thinking he could hide from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Blinky called at  the top of his voice, beckoning to Belinda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Let them go!&rdquo; And she gave  her tail a very frisky wag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready! &hellip; Set! &hellip; GO!&rdquo; called  Blinky in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Away raced the bunnies, their  tails bobbing up and down as they went helter-skelter down the flat.</p>
<p>At the same moment Belinda Fox  made a spring in the blackberry-bush, and with a snap, grabbed Prickles in her  teeth. As it happened she grabbed him right round the tummy in the most prickly  part. She gave a leap in the air and a scream of agony, as she shook her head  from side to side. She could not cry as her mouth was full of prickles. They  stuck between her teeth and pierced her tongue, and as she swallowed with rage  they stuck in her throat. With a yell of anger she made another bite at old  Prickles and shook him violently, so violently that he came in halves. Then  realizing that a trick had been played on her, she raced round and round,  biting at the air and snapping at the remains of Prickles. She coughed and  spluttered, and tried to tear the prickles out of her mouth, but it was  useless, they pricked like a thousand needles. Exhausted at last, she fell in a  heap, right in the middle of the blackberry-bush and lay there gasping for air.</p>
<p>The baby rabbits seeing what had  happened when half-way down the flat, turned and raced back to their burrows,  chuckling with glee, and dancing around on their hind legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s caught this time!&rdquo; Blinky  laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down and have a look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even old great granny joined in  the rush. Her left hind foot was swollen with rheumatism, caused through living  in a very dark and damp burrow, but she forgot all about it for the moment and  trotted along on her three legs with a queer hop now and again. Her old  whiskers (the few she had left) twitched with enjoyment and her eyes looked  brighter. She grinned and showed her poor old teeth, worn to the gums with many  years of hard work on tough grasses and plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, great granny!&rdquo; a baby  bunny called. &ldquo;Shake a leg, or you&rsquo;ll miss the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shaking the three of them as  fast as I can,&rdquo; she chuckled, and gave an extra spurt just to show the cheeky  young rabs what she <i>could</i> do.</p>
<p>Belinda Fox heard the rabbits  coming and took a look to make sure. Oh, how mad she was! She kicked the  blackberry-bush with all her legs at once and only added more prickles to her  skin.</p>
<p>The rabbits stood round in a circle  laughing at the top of their voices, poking fun, and calling her names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Miss Belinda Fox,&rdquo; old  great granny cackled, &ldquo;how do you like rabbit for supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belinda gave a leap and tried to  grab great granny, but she fell back in the blackberry-bush with a cry of pain  and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Blinky felt sorry for Belinda,  because it was not really her fault that she liked rabbit for supper.  &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d been a fox I&rsquo;d like rabbit, too.&rdquo; So, walking  quietly up to Belinda, who looked as though she were dead, he said in very kind  tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I help to pick the prickles  out of you, will you promise to <i>never  never</i> eat bunnies again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belinda opened one eye and looked  at him sorrowfully. She could not speak, so nodded her head weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;ll keep your  promise?&rdquo; Blinky asked. But Belinda could not answer; she only nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross your paws,&rdquo; Blinky  commanded. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll know you mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belinda raised her front paws very  slowly and crossed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll pick all the prickles  out, and you&rsquo;ll be able to run home.&rdquo; And Blinky cautiously stepped up to  Belinda and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>The rabbits were amazed to see  Belinda Fox so sorry and offered to help with the prickles. But Blinky ordered  them home, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go while the going&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rabbits wisely took his  advice.</p>
<p>All night long, until daylight,  Blinky picked the prickles out. There was such a pile of them; but as Belinda&rsquo;s  mouth and throat were clear after Blinky had spent two whole hours unpricking,  she felt better and sat up and helped to pick the nasty things from her paws  and tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; Blinky  asked when all but a few were out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better, Mr. Koala,&rdquo; Belinda  answered. &ldquo;Now I think I&rsquo;ll go home. And I&rsquo;ll never come down this way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Belinda Fox ever after kept  well away from the flat. Even when she was terribly hungry, she would not for a  moment look at a rabbit. If one happened to cross her pathway as she rambled  through the bush, she immediately sat on her haunches, crossed her front paws,  and looked the other way.</p>
<p>Blinky&rsquo;s life was certainly full  of adventure. But once more he set out to find his way home, feeling very happy  that he had done a good deed, and saved the baby bunnies from a horrible death.</p>

  Blinky Returns Home</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page091.jpg" alt="six" width="500" height="241"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo; said Mrs.  Grunty, as she peered through the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a possum,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied as she also gazed through the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no possum,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  answered in a decided tone. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting my spectacles it&rsquo;s that  son of yours returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how wonderful!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  cried, &ldquo;Do you really think the dear little chap has come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little chap,&rdquo; sniffed Mrs.  Grunty with a stern look on her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Snubby running away from  home! He wouldn&rsquo;t do it the second time. And I&rsquo;d also like to know what you  intend to do with that son of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to spank  him,&rdquo; and Mrs. Koala sighed very deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  scoffed. &ldquo;Why, if he belonged to me I&rsquo;m warm his pants for him. My word I  would!&rdquo; And she folded her paws over her tummy in a very determined way, and  glared through the branches again.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page083.jpg" alt="warm" width="616" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Is anyone there?&rdquo; she snapped and  nearly fell headlong out of the tree as she bent over to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep cool. This is my  business,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said firmly, as she broke a twig off the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my business, too,&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty growled. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have that young runaway playing with Snubby. Goodness  knows what ideas he&rsquo;ll put in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t room in his head for  many ideas!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said snappily as she began to climb down the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty sighed.  &ldquo;More trouble. That boy of hers will be the death of her yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala quietly climbed down  from one branch to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky!&rdquo; she called in a whisper.  &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; came a meek little  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up here at once!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming if Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s  there,&rdquo; naughty Blinky answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I tell you this minute,&rdquo;  his mother commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Blinky answered in a  very trembly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll soon see about that!&rdquo;  And Mrs. Koala climbed right down the tree to the ground where Blinky stood.  What a sight met her eyes! A grubby little bear, bockers torn to ribbons and  dirty; dirty paws and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala cried.  &ldquo;Where have you been? Just look at you. Dirt from head to foot. It&rsquo;s no use,  its no use!&rdquo; poor mother bear cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep you clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only dirt,&rdquo; Blinky  whimpered, as he looked at his mother very sorrowfully.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page094.jpg" alt="dirt" width="430" height="545"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all this  time?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worried almost to death, and my  hair&rsquo;s turned grey with fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to Mrs.  Magpie&rsquo;s school, and I hate Mrs. Grunty. She&rsquo;s always growling,&rdquo; Blinky said,  and a tear ran down his face.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala put her paws behind her  back and gently dropped her stick on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an old growler. You&rsquo;re  right, Blinky. I think we&rsquo;ll both go away from her,&rdquo; and Mrs. Koala patted  Blinky&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Blinky  implored, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never run away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  kindly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; Blinky cried as he  hugged his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here until I go up and  collect a few leaves, as we&rsquo;ll probably need them on the way,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say good-bye to Mrs. Grunty for  me, and give her a scratch,&rdquo; naughty Blinky called out as his mother climbed up  the tree again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cheeky, Blinky,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied. &ldquo;Mrs. Grunty can&rsquo;t help growling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got an extra big growler  inside her,&rdquo; Blinky mumbled. He waited patiently until his mother returned. Her  apron was full of juicy gum-tips and she seemed very pleased at the prospect of  leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Blinky  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; his mother  replied. &ldquo;You should know a good place for us to make a new home after all your  travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of lots!&rdquo; Blinky cried  joyfully, and danced up and down.</p>
<p>Just as they were ready to start a  big gum-nut came hurtling down and hit Blinky right on his nose. He looked up  at the tree in surprise. Surely Snubby wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing like that. He was  such a good little bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that horrid Mrs. Grunty,&rdquo; he  said at the top of his voice, as he caught sight of her hiding among the  leaves, and looking down at him. She was shaking her paw savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you fall out of the tree,&rdquo;  Blinky called to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a bad day for you if I  do,&rdquo; she called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old Grunty legs!&rdquo; he  answered, and scrambled after his mother, who had started on the pathway into  the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have you back  again,&rdquo; dear old Mrs. Koala said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be happy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As happy as spiders,&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;I know a beautiful big gum-tree, away from Mrs. Grunty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two bears trotted on and on,  the stars shining seemed to wink and laugh at them, and a breeze dancing  through the bush played with them as she blew leaves in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala whispered. &ldquo;I  can hear voices, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Mr. Owl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! There are men coming,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala whispered again. &ldquo;Where shall we hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind this bush,&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;Quickly, mother, and don&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two bears crawled under a  wattle-tree and waited with thumping hearts to see what would happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; Blinky  whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move an eyelash.&rdquo; He was right. Two men with guns and sacks  came tramping through the bush, crushing the leaves underfoot and whistling  loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing we haven&rsquo;t  seen a possum yet,&rdquo; one remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears are what I&rsquo;m after,&rdquo; the  other replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all!&rdquo; the first one  answered. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have a long tramp after them. There are none round  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky and his mother looked at  one another terrified. &ldquo;What if they find us?&rdquo; Blinky whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe, if you keep very  still.&rdquo; And Mrs. Koala patted Blinky in a comforting way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about boiling the billy?&rdquo; one  man suggested as they stopped right opposite the wattle-tree where the two  bears were hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; his friend replied.  &ldquo;I feel like a cup of tea. Here&rsquo;s a good tree to rest under.&rdquo; And pointing to  the wattle, he flung his sacks down only a few inches from Blinky and his  mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have a look round  for snakes, before you sit there,&rdquo; the first man advised.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala gave Blinky&rsquo;s arm a  squeeze. They were trembling with fright.</p>
<p>The man who had thrown his sacks  down started to kick away the leaves and twigs. Nearer and nearer his boots came  to the little bears, until he kicked Blinky on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa! What have I struck?&rdquo; he  called out. &ldquo;Something soft, and not a snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A possum, you may be sure,&rdquo; his  friend replied as he dashed over to have a look.</p>
<p>Pushing aside the low branches of  the wattle, they discovered Blinky and his mother, huddled up together and  growling savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo; said one  of the men. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Mrs. Koala and her son! What luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the sack and be very gentle  with them,&rdquo; his friend replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re grand little fellows and I wouldn&rsquo;t  hurt a hair on their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very healthy looking bears,  especially the young chap,&rdquo; the other man remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You grab one and I&rsquo;ll get the  other, then we&rsquo;ll put them in the sacks,&rdquo; the first man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easier said than done, I think,&rdquo;  his friend remarked as he approached Blinky and Mrs. Koala. They growled louder  than ever, and snarled at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, old chap,&rdquo; the man  said kindly as he reached towards Blinky; but Blinky decided there and then  that he&rsquo;d fight before he&rsquo;d be popped in a sack.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page092.jpg" alt="fight" width="605" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;So you want a scrap, do you?&rdquo; the  man asked, as he tried to pat Blinky.</p>
<p>With a growl Blinky darted out his  paw and scratched the man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young beggar!&rdquo; the man cried.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time your toenails were cut.&rdquo; And as quick as lightning he grabbed Blinky  by the back of the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; the man called  excitedly. &ldquo;Now for the mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mrs. Koala saw Blinky caught  she wisely decided to give no trouble, but to go with her son, wherever they  were taken to. She allowed the other man to catch her and stroke her pretty  ears. In fact, she rather liked the feel of those hands. They were very gentle  and the man spoke kind words. Surely no harm would come to them from these men.</p>
<p>But Mr. Blinky thought otherwise.  He was mad. Fancy being caught just as he was out on another adventure! And he  had such a wonderful lot of things to show his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young fellow&rsquo;s like a  jack-in-the-box and as savage as a lion,&rdquo; the man remarked who held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop him into the sack,&rdquo; his  friend replied, &ldquo;but be very careful not to hurt him. His mother&rsquo;s behaving  like a little lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky was put in the sack, feet  first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie the bag round his neck, and  let the little fellow see his mother,&rdquo; the first man said, so a string was tied  round the bag, and Blinky looked very funny as he was propped up against the  tree, with just his head showing. His ears looked larger than ever and his eyes  glistened with anger. He kicked and kicked the sack and altogether behaved  shockingly.</p>
<p>The men laughed loudly as they  watched his antics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young nipper&rsquo;s in a bad  temper,&rdquo; one remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit beside him with his mother on my lap. That  might quieten him.&rdquo; He did so, and Mrs. Koala put out a paw and patted Blinky&rsquo;s  nose. It was hot and dry. &ldquo;Dear me, Blinky,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so angry.  You&rsquo;re making yourself quite ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill us,&rdquo; Blinky cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure they are kind men. I  heard them say something about a zoo just now,&rdquo; his mother replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to go to a  zoo,&rdquo; he wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;d have great fun!&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala said. &ldquo;We would meet other bears and see all kinds of strange things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like an adventure, and  I suppose we&rsquo;d be taken great care of, and if you&rsquo;re with me, mother, I don&rsquo;t  think I&rsquo;d mind so much,&rdquo; Blinky replied quite cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said.  &ldquo;Now, if you stop that kicking and growling and behave very nicely, perhaps the  men will take you out of that sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky did as his mother advised, and  sat there as quiet as it was possible for him to sit. Presently, after the men  had finished their tea, one turned to look at Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little fellow&rsquo;s quite tame  now,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s tired after all that kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little chap!&rdquo; the other said  kindly. &ldquo;How about letting him out for a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it wise?&rdquo; his friend  asked. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lose him for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t wander away while his  mother&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;Let him out and see what he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; So  Blinky was taken out of the sack and held in kind arms up to his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kick or scratch,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala whispered, &ldquo;or they&rsquo;ll pop you back in the sack again.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400591h-images/2page099.jpg" alt="kick" width="400" height="478"></p>
<p>But Blinky was cunning enough to  know that, and instead kept very still until at last the man placed him on the  ground. He cuddled up to his mother and felt ever so much happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s time we made tracks  home again,&rdquo; one of the men remarked, as he stamped out the smouldering fire.  &ldquo;Pop the two of them in the sacks and we&rsquo;ll ride very carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long journey followed through  the bush; to Blinky it seemed days and days. The gum-trees were gradually left  behind, and in their place green fields and houses came into view. The earth  had not the sweet smell of the bushland, the air seemed dusty, and the songs of  the birds disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>Both bears were held very gently  and patted and talked to in a caressing way by the men, so all fear of harm had  left them. Indeed, they were enjoying this new adventure, especially dear Mrs.  Koala, who had never been from home before. She could hardly believe her eyes  when she saw the first train pass by in the distance, and wonder after wonder  caused her and Blinky to utter queer little grunts as they came nearer to the  township. The next day, the men took the bears on the train and it was very  amusing to Blinky to have such a fuss made of him. It was better than any  adventure he&rsquo;d ever had before. Mrs. Koala enjoyed it, too, and in her mind  wondered however she had lived so long with crabby Mrs. Grunty. After the train  journey they were carried on board a boat and taken across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed, as she gazed on Sydney harbour. &ldquo;They seem to have a great deal of  rain here. I&rsquo;ve never seen such a lot of water over the ground before. The  rabbits will be in a bad way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky was too surprised to reply.  He tried to look at everything at once&mdash;boats, people, flags, wharves, and very  tall buildings. It was really marvellous. He was too surprised to even grunt.  The men still carried them in their arms, and patted them as before.</p>
<p>The boat drew alongside a jetty  and the men carried the bears ashore. Through a big gate they went and along  paths bordered with beautiful flowers, and oh, joy! gum-trees grew all around.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Blinky were  enraptured as they saw the trees of the bushland, and every moment they became  happier as an old friend was seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Mrs. Wallaby, I do  believe!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala cried in excitement. &ldquo;And, oh, dear, what a great number  of children she has now! When I first knew her she had only one; now she has  dozens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; she cried in alarm  as they passed along the path. &ldquo;Just look at Mrs. Snake. How fat she&rsquo;s grown  since last I saw her! And I&rsquo;m sure as can be she hadn&rsquo;t all those children  then. Oh, there&rsquo;s her husband, I suppose. See, Blinky, that big snake lying  asleep in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our Mrs. Snake,&rdquo;  Blinky replied with a worldly air. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead and eaten by the bull ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala sighed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so little living away in the bush. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it we  koalas have seen very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Jacko!&rdquo; Blinky cried with  excitement. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough&mdash;the kookaburras were  giving the little bears a grand bush welcome to their new home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  called. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve also added to your family, Mr. Kookaburra, since I saw you  last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hearty laugh greeted Mrs.  Koala&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great gum-trees! What on earth is  that?&rdquo; said Mrs. Koala, pointing to a giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I&rsquo;ve never seen a  tree like that before. What a funny looking branch that is growing out of the  stump. It&rsquo;s spotted like the gum, but the spots are larger. Good gracious,  Blinky, it&rsquo;s moving! Look at the branches walking along the ground. And, oh,  the spotted branch has eyes and ears on the top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; Blinky retorted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not a tree. That&rsquo;s an animal, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that huge thing over there  an animal?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked as she pointed to an elephant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen an  animal with a nose like that! Just look at it&mdash;all crumpled and so very, very,  long. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not an animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; Blinky cried  excitedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s picking up something with his nose! And now he&rsquo;s curled it  into his mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>not</i> a nose,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said decidedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some kind of fishing-line he&rsquo;s stuck on his face. Whoever  saw anyone pick up things with their nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky and his mother had no  further time for argument as the men carried them into a building, where they  were at once surrounded by several more men who admired them, patted them, and  offered some delicious fresh gum-tips for refreshments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember your manners, Blinky,  and don&rsquo;t eat so quickly,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala whispered, as she nibbled her leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so good, mother, and it&rsquo;s  such a long time since we&rsquo;ve had our own gum-tips. I hope we&rsquo;ll get plenty  more.&rdquo; And Blinky crammed his mouth with leaves until a smart smack on the nose  from Mrs. Koala made him remember his manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they the quaintest little  bears,&rdquo; someone said as Blinky and his mother continued their meal. &ldquo;And what a  delight for the children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They have indeed been a delight  and joy to thousands of children&mdash;and grown-ups as well&mdash;in Taronga Park. Such  cuddly, trusting, amusing little bears. How many of you children who visit the  zoo long to steal Blinky just for your very own? No wonder, especially when he  reaches out a furry paw to shake hands with you. But while you are longing to  cuddle and steal him, remember how sad he would be if parted from his mother.  He would die in a very short time, as his natural food is most necessary, that  is&mdash;his special gum-tips; and although Blinky has been through so many bold  adventures, he must have his bushland surroundings to make his life happy.</p>
<p>As I walked past the koalas one  day recently when paying a visit to the zoo, I asked Mrs. Koala how she liked  her new home. Before she could reply naughty Blinky pushed his way in front of  her, held out a paw for me to shake, and said in a very cheeky voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the juicy gum-tip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there I left the two little  koalas with other friends from the bush feeling very happy and looking quite  contented.</p>
