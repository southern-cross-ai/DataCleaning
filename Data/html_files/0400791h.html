<h1>THE SOJOURNER</h1>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c01">I</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Three crows flew low over the fresh mound in the Linden
burying-ground, dark as the thoughts of the three unmourning
mourners. These were the widow, Amelia Linden, and the two tall
sons, Benjamin and Asahel. The funeral assembly had gone. The
clomp of horses' feet and the rattle of wheels were faint down
the frozen lane. There was a pure instant of silence. Then a wind
keened far off in the west, nosed across the hills and leaped
into the clearing, snapping its fangs at the limbs of the oak
trees. The last leaves shivered to earth and scurried like thin
brown rats across the grave.</p>

<p>Amelia turned the black veil back from her face, and walked to
the carriage. She settled herself in the front seat.</p>

<p>"Benjamin, take the reins."</p>

<p>Asahel moved to the heads of the span of horses to unhitch
them from a cedar post. He stroked the velvet muzzles and the
horses nickered. He slid off the blankets, and placing them in
the rear of the carriage, found his elder brother sitting stiffly
with folded arms in the back of the seat. His mother's face was
gray. He waited for her to move into the driver's seat. The
untethered horses sidled restlessly. When young Dan lunged and
Amelia did not stir, Asahel jumped clumsily into the carriage and
jerked the reins. The team broke into an unseemly trot for
home.</p>

<p>The bereavement of life rather than grief for death chilled
Asahel's bones. There was no sorrow among the three in the
carriage for the harsh, snarling man left behind under the wings
of crows, except the sorrow all men feel face to face with death,
even that of a stranger dead on the turn-pike, which is an
unassuageable anguish for themselves, the evidence of their own
destinies. Yet this was a moment, surely, when mother and sons
should draw close together, pile high the barricade, build up the
fire, against the outer darkness. Instead, his mother and
Benjamin were still separated by the violent quarrel he had heard
late last night from his bedroom. He had not heard the words, he
could not guess what they might quarrel about, but it was the
first time his mother had not found her elder pleasing in her
sight. Asahel had hovered for his twenty years outside her
adoration, like a shy and hungry dog that skirts a lighted house,
longing to be called in for a plate of food and a few caresses.
Because he loved Benjamin too, he had no sense of loss for
himself, was warmed when his mother's eyes lighted for his
brother, and asked only to be present. Now with his father's
death something had come between these two, life was hurt more
cruelly. There was no longer Benjamin's bright sun with its two
satellites, Amelia powerful and near, he far and futile, but
three cold stones pendulous in space.</p>

<p>The November gale caught them full at the turn into the Linden
place. The time was late afternoon, but sky and landscape were as
gray as though there had never been a sun and so there was no sun
for setting. The house loomed large and bleak on its rise above
the road. Its windowed eyes were blank. The low scudding clouds
seemed to catch and tatter on the two tall brick chimneys. Asahel
drove the carriage up the drive to the side and stopped. Amelia
waited for Benjamin to help her down. He did not move. She
stepped out then and took the graveled path to the door, her
billowing black skirts flattened against her thighs.</p>

<p>Asahel turned the horses around and drove across the road to
the lower-lying barns. Here Benjamin got out and rolled open a
wide sliding door. Asahel drove up the earth ramp and over the
rattling board floor into the dusk. The brothers took down
overalls from nails on a wall and pulled them over their good
clothes. They unharnessed the horses together. Asahel led young
Dan to the stock stalls on a lower level and the mare followed.
Benjamin pitched down hay while Asahel measured out oats. Only
one cow was fresh at the moment and Asahel milked her, stripping
her carefully. Benjamin scattered fodder in the lot for the
assorted cows and calves. The sheep had not yet been brought in
from the hill pasture for the winter.</p>

<p>Nothing remained to be fed but the hogs and poultry. The
chickens, guinea hens, geese, ducks and turkeys, always ravenous,
assumed from the color of the sky that it was evening and made a
raucous crying. Benjamin brought them grain while Asahel took the
foaming bucket of milk to the house and returned with skimmed
milk and slops for the hogs. The brothers worked together
smoothly, Benjamin quickly and impatiently, Asahel with
deliberation. Benjamin was finished first. He leaned on the rail
of the pig-pen, waiting, Asahel hoped, to speak with him, to tell
him of the quarrel. Benjamin had nothing to offer. He was perhaps
avoiding facing his mother alone, or there might be nothing,
after all, to say.</p>

<p>The two young men shared as few similar genes as was possible,
still to be blood brothers. The differences in physique made folk
say, "Ben favors the Linden's," and "Ase isn't like any of the
family, either side." Benjamin was hard-muscled, six feet tall,
quick-fighting, quick-dancing, moving lightly like fighter or
dancer, rocking on the balls of his feet, with panther-colored
hair and green eyes, so that all his effect was of one of the
great cats. Asahel, twenty years to his twenty-three, reared,
six-feet-four, like a gaunt sapling, over his brother, and as
though in apology for his assumption of the greater height,
carried himself stooped and gangling. His hair was black, with an
Indian straightness, his face was high-cheek-boned, his deep-set
eyes were gray with black striations. He was all slowness and
awkwardness, his big feet a nuisance rather than a help. His
hands, of terrific strength, hung like gnarled pine stumps at the
ends of long bony arms.</p>

<p>The disparities of the brothers' minds and spirits were
profound.</p>

<p>Benjamin had had four years at the Academy, while Asahel,
after the simple schooling of the one-room stone schoolhouse two
miles down the road, had been kept at home to work. Yet it was
Benjamin who remembered nothing from his textbooks, scarcely read
the weekly county paper, and Asahel who knew those books secretly
by heart, and read, as laboriously as he did everything else, any
scrap of paper with printing on it, poring hungrily over the
magic of words. It seemed to him, who was all but inarticulate,
that if he could read enough of them he would know the answers to
the questions that tormented him. He had no way of knowing that
wiser men had asked those questions, which never had been,
perhaps never would be, answered. It was Benjamin who was wild,
who ran away periodically, who returned with empty pockets and
not even a tale to tell. It was Asahel, who had been no more than
twenty miles from home, who traveled in his mind so far that
those who thought they knew him would have been terrified by his
consorting with the stars.</p>

<p>Benjamin hesitated at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly to his younger brother.</p>

<p>"Listen, Ase. You've got to back me up. I'm leaving for
good."</p>

<p>This, then, had been the quarrel.</p>

<p>Asahel's first sickness was for his mother. In the barren
ground of her life, of her own character, Benjamin had been the
bright tropical bloom that satisfied and startled, making the
desert not impossible. Only Benjamin had brightened those hard
black eyes, only Benjamin had brought music to that low, cold
voice. He had seen his mother stiffen in her chair on a winter
night, thinking she heard the loved one's step on the icy road,
sit back trembling because it was not he. He had seen her lift
her arms, like a bird taking happy wing, when at last he came,
Benjamin, he came. Then he was sick for himself. His heart, too,
had beat so fast that he was dizzy, when Benjamin came home. And
this was not for any meagreness of life and thought without his
brother, but because of his own gift for love and for devotion.
It did not seem to him this bond could be one-sided.</p>

<p>He washed out the empty swill buckets at the rear pump. Now
was the moment to call on words, to find the proper ones to hold
his brother home. The place would be desolate without him. He
could not let him go, to roam the world in trouble. He turned the
buckets upside down to dry. He followed Benjamin, wordless, into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Part of the ample funeral foods brought by relatives and
neighbors sat on the white-clothed table in the dining-room
beyond. Coffee simmered on the back of the kitchen range. A
pitcher of buttermilk was cool and fresh from the stone cellar.
The brothers washed their hands at the cistern pump and dried
them on the roller towel. Their mother poured coffee and led the
way to the table. Benjamin picked and chose from his favorite
dishes, but ate little, his mind and body restless. Asahel heaped
his plate at random and plodded away, as at a job of haying. One
food was almost the same to him as another. He was seldom
conscious of hunger, and he ate prodigiously, filling his stomach
slowly, steadily, like an ox, until the moment came when he
realized, with a mild surprise, that he could literally hold no
more. He was the delight of fine cooks, who took his
absent-minded capacity for appreciation.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Asahel, if you can bring yourself to finish
eating, I need your help. Benjamin has something stupid to
say."</p>

<p>"I've told him, Mother. Ase understands. He agrees. Don't take
it out on him, when it's settled."</p>

<p>"Oh. Settled. He's perfectly contented, I suppose, to farm it
alone. There isn't enough money, you know, to hire a man to
replace you. This is a three-man farm, at the least. Now it's to
be down to one boy. Or am I expected to work in the fields?"</p>

<p>The last mouthful of pie stuck in Asahel's throat. His mother
shocked him. How could she bring herself to put Benjamin's
leaving on such a basis, when he knew her heart, as his, was
crying, "Son and brother, we cannot face life without you,
because of love, never because of a living!"</p>

<p>She said, "Asahel, do you care to speak for yourself, or will
you have another piece of pie?"</p>

<p>They were both looking at him, each asking in their ways, one
bitter, the other eager, for his support.</p>

<p>Benjamin said, "Ase, you know I've always hated farming. I
wouldn't even be any help to you. I'd be leaving when you needed
me most. I can't change it. I'll admit it now, I was afraid of
Father. I kept coming back because I was more afraid of him away,
than here. Ase, you're a man to plow and sow and reap. You'll
manage without me. I'll give you my share in the farm. Just let
me go."</p>

<p>Amelia smoothed the black funereal satin over her thin
breast.</p>

<p>"You forget that the place is mine. Neither of you can give
away a share he doesn't own. Your father was a difficult man, but
he saw his duty, and the farm is mine, all mine, until I say
otherwise. I shall not release you, Benjamin, from your share. It
will be yours as long as I live. You can't run away from that.
Well, Asahel?"</p>

<p>Still, he could not speak. Benjamin pushed away from the table
and went up to his room. He returned to the silence with his
valise, his coat over his arm.</p>

<p>He said, "How much money do we have?"</p>

<p>Amelia went to her downstairs bedroom and came again to the
table with a tin box, and opened it. She counted out the paper
bills and the silver. She set aside a portion.</p>

<p>"This should cover the funeral expenses and a tombstone."</p>

<p>The remainder amounted to little over six hundred dollars.
Benjamin pocketed a third of it. On a scrap of paper he
scrawled:</p>

<p>"Rec. of Amelia and Asahel Linden payment in full for share in
Linden farm. Signed, Benjamin Linden."</p>

<p>Amelia stared at the paper, then threw it in the door of the
red pot-bellied stove.</p>

<p>She turned away into her room and closed the door behind her.
Benjamin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"She thinks I'll be coming back again. Maybe some day, Ase,
when I'm rich."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket their father's gold hunter's watch,
given him by Amelia before the funeral.</p>

<p>"Keep this. No, take it."</p>

<p>He turned to go.</p>

<p>"Don't hitch up. I'd rather walk. I'll catch the night train
west from the village. I'm a dog to leave you, Ase."</p>

<p>Asahel followed him out of the front door, across the porch,
down the steps, over the lawn, to the road. The road ran level
for a way, rose a little, dipped down to the valley where the
stream ran under a wooden bridge, wound its way four miles to the
village of Peytonville, to the train, to the West, to the unknown
and far away.</p>

<p>He wanted to say, "Don't leave me. Take me with you."</p>

<p>Benjamin said, "Don't come any farther."</p>

<p>He held out his strong arms and drew him tight. Asahel
trembled.</p>

<p>"Better marry Nellie Wilson in the spring, boy. Then you won't
miss me so much."</p>

<p>Asahel said at last, "I'll never be done missing you."</p>

<p>Sunset had come, yet there was still no sun, only livid and
evil streaks in the west, where Benjamin was going. The bond was
a stout cord that tore him and would not release him, and he was
drawn by it to the little rise. Benjamin was a small figure on
the wooden bridge far below. Asahel lifted his arm and waved, but
his brother did not look back. He turned back toward home. There
was now no color in the sky. The world was fast darkening.
Everything was retreating, going away into distant places, and he
was left behind, to plow, to sow, to reap.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c02">II</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On a cold December morning Ase Linden paced slowly, studying
them, the acres whose crops must soon be planned for. A dusting
of granular snow whirled across the frozen ground ahead of a
biting wind. His father's old buffalo greatcoat hung long and
loose on his gaunt frame. His hands were paws in fur-backed
leather mittens. A muskrat cap with earmuffs sat low on his head.
His deep-set eyes searched the landscape, his long nose sniffed
the scent of coming snow, his shaggy-furred shoulders were
stooped. He looked a winter-poor bear come wandering from his
den. He crossed the road to the south and took shelter for a
moment in the lee of the log cabin.</p>

<p>The Linden land was fertile for the most part. Its three
hundred acres divided themselves naturally into woods, pastures,
and fields suitable for varying crops. A country road bisected
the farm. The house sat back from it to the north, the barns to
the south. The richest soil lay south and west of the barns. Here
the money crops were grown, the beans, the wheat, the potatoes.
The land dipped to a willow-bordered stream that ran from east to
west, and the cow pasture began beyond the stream. The hill that
lifted again, still to the south, was stony and was given over to
the sheep. The high extreme southeastern corner of the land
consisted of forty acres of wood-lot, from which trees were cut
selectively for fuel and for building. The woods ended suddenly
and blackly with a hemlock-rimmed bog, from which springs seeped
down to join the brook, and so dangerous that a cow breaking
loose and wandering there would perish within a few minutes if
unnoticed and unrescued. A crystal lake, believed to be
bottomless, fed the stream from the east, and the western border
became marsh, infested with small rattlers.</p>

<p>The land on the house side of the road ended to the northwest
with a smaller wood-lot and with a sugar-bush adequate to supply
a family with maple syrup and sugar. Wheat was grown west of the
house as well, alternating in years with the southerly field.
Rye, oats and barley, corn and buckwheat, were staple crops for
home consumption. A small fruit and vegetable garden was near the
house to the east, where it received full sun all day. The house
itself was large and square, white painted, eared with red
chimneys, with a fine fan-lighted doorway carved in a Greek
design. It was distinguished, but bleak, uncompromising, needing,
Ase recognized, the softening of trees and shrubbery. Across from
the house, a few hundred yards west down the road, still stood
the original Linden home, a log cabin chinked with white marl,
and beside it an icy spring, stone-enclosed.</p>

<p>The wind veered and caught Asahel full and the cabin no longer
sheltered him. He moved on slowly, across the level field. There
was no living thing in sight. The stock was snug in barn and
cote. No sheep nibbled among the granite, no cows drifted across
pasture, no horses rolled in clover, no poultry pecked and
clattered. The farm was only bare land, frozen clay and loam
waiting for new moulding at his hands.</p>

<p>He halted to the south where the field dipped gently to the
stream. He heard the muffled rushing of the current under the
ice. The willows along the borders tossed scraggled branches like
the sparse, whipping hair of hags who had once been beautiful,
and by miracle would again be young and garlanded and fair. He
turned and looked back toward the cabin, small and huddled at the
distance. This level field, he estimated, would run close to
twenty acres. In the six weeks since Benjamin's leaving he had
given it special thought. Knowing that Ben was done with the
farm, it had seemed to him important that some sections of the
Linden land be given over to crops which, once established, would
be both profitable and requiring little care. Sizeable fruit
orchards were plainly the answer. He visualized here an apple
orchard. In spring a pink and white cloud would draw the bees to
hum among the blossoms. Birds would nest and sing in the summer
greenery. The waxen globes would shine like lamps in autumn,
yellow and green and red, windfalls would thud to earth, to lie
deep in buckwheat sown broadcast between the rows, to be crushed,
wine-scented, in dripping jowls of swine and cattle, to be stung
by wasps. The black boughs of apple trees in winter made, he
thought, patterns like no other tree.</p>

<p>His father had never planted an orchard. No growing thing was
graceless, but that scowling, snarling man, Hiram Linden, had
seemed purposely to avoid all crops that flowered in beauty. All
were utilitarian, sown with surliness and harvested with oaths.
Ase was the first Linden of three generations to consider the
earth and its bounty with reverence and affection, to long to
adorn it as best he might during his tenure. To the Linden men
ahead of him, it had been only a means of subsistence. His
father, his brother, had been not even grateful that the rich
loam made the tilling so little arduous, the lush harvests so
rewarding.</p>

<p>The apples here, then, he decided, if his mother would allow
it. He moved down the slope to the brook, crossed carefully on
the icy stepping stones, trudged up the farther slope to the
sheep pasture and halted again. Because of the granite
out-croppings, no other use could be made of the high expanse.
Sheep were profitable in any case and the flock might well be
enlarged. In that case, his mother would have to permit him a
dog, a sheep dog. He had never had one, where every farm lad had
his own. Amelia, through distaste an indifferent housekeeper, had
always forbidden it on the excuse that she would have no dirty
animal following to the kitchen door and tracking up the
woodshed. He had accepted the verdict, as he must, puzzled and
unsatisfied. The truth unguessed, or unacknowledgable, was that
she would admit no living thing save one to her affection, to her
tolerance or compassion. The fire within her was a hoarded thing,
nurtured jealously, an iron box of hot embers for the warming of
the hands of one. That one was Benjamin. Ase had gone his boy's
way in loneliness, tagging hopefully after his brother, longing
to be tagged in turn by some soft-eyed mongrel, equally faithful
and adoring.</p>

<p>He opened a gate into the stock lane. Well, he thought,
perhaps soon he would have his dog. It was not so important, now
he was a man. The wind whipped under the buffalo coat and chilled
his long scant-fleshed legs. There was no need to go to the end
of the lane to the hemlocks and the bog. He had known for a year
or more that it was time to begin cutting from the wood-lot
adjoining the hemlocks, to give a rest for growth to the lot to
the northwest of the house. There was no need, either, to pace
the southeast acres above Pip Lake. They would be required for
some time for wheat and corn. Eventually, he would like to try
there a small peach orchard, increasing it from year to year if
it thrived. The rounded summit was probably too exposed to the
cold, but it seemed to him that the slope rolling toward the
brook and the barns, and the eastern, dipping to the lake,
offered protection for such delicate fruit and trees. This soil
was pebbly, with a high admixture of clay.</p>

<p>He turned down the lane to the barns. He would have a look at
the stock in passing. The wind at his back ruffled the curls of
the buffalo pelt, it pushed him downhill, so that his big feet
stumbled over rocks, his gait more awkward even than usual.
Opening the gate to the sheep-shed he heard familiar horse's
hooves on the road, the scrape of the runners of the light cutter
on the inadequate snow. His mother had returned sooner than he
expected from her drive to the post office at Peytonville. She
had insisted on making the trip with a superstition, he felt,
that if she went alone a letter from Benjamin would be waiting
for her. He joined her at the side driveway beside the house. She
handed him the reins. He looked at the newspapers in her gloved
hands.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Nothing from him. Nothing at all."</p>

<p>He put the cutter in the light carriage shed by the driveway,
unhitched the mare, led her to the barn, stalled, fed, watered,
and curried her. Because of his slowness, he was occupied more
than half an hour. He went to the house and hung his coat and cap
in the woodshed attached to the kitchen. He found his mother
warming her hands by the living-room stove, still dressed in her
velvet pelisse, bonnet and fur capelet. She was a slight woman
past fifty, long of neck, with smooth black hair, small black
eyes and a tight, thin mouth. She carried herself stiffly erect
in well made clothes of good material. She was not unattractive
until she focussed her eyes on a human being, when their
unblinking coldness gave the effect of the stare of an adder.</p>

<p>She lifted her head and turned the jet-like glitter on her
younger son.</p>

<p>She said, "I have been expecting Benjamin to return every day.
This is most unusual. He has never been away so long without
writing me. I begin to feel something different about this
absence. He went with a reason and for a purpose. It comes clear
now to my mind. He is ambitious, if you can understand that. He
wishes to make a much needed backlog of money to bring home. It
will take him a little time. He naturally prefers to have good
news before writing me. It will come. Meantime--"</p>

<p>She studied him, frowning.</p>

<p>"Are you listening to me? Your expression is completely
blank."</p>

<p>Behind the mask of his face Ase was suffering. It seemed to
him that he must awaken her to the truth, as one shakes a sleeper
in a nightmare. Yet for her it was not nightmare, but a sweet
dream from which she would be cruelly aroused. It was necessary,
he thought. How else might life begin again for her?</p>

<p>He said desperately, "Mother, Ben is gone."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I am talking about. It may be as late as
summer before he comes home. Meantime, you must make plans for
the spring planting. I have come to a decision. I am putting
everything here in your hands. Get advice if you need, but not
from me. I know nothing of these things. And care less. It is a
hateful life. But the farm is all we have and I expect you to
make the most of it. Everything is up to you until Benjamin's
return."</p>

<p>He did not speak.</p>

<p>She said sharply, "Do you understand? Are you prepared to take
this responsibility?"</p>

<p>He nodded. She went to her room and closed the door.</p>

<p>He was ready. He had been ready a long time. He was old in
farm lore. He had learned it with fascination from childhood, as
the child of a musician absorbs the patterns of sound, and may
astonish its elders by climbing to the piano stool and playing
accurately a little tune at the age of five. Benjamin had
vanished for three months the summer when Ase was sixteen, their
father had been out of his mind with fever, and the stripling,
with the help of a stupid ox of a hired hand, had brought through
the crops to a prosperous harvesting. Because he loved the earth,
its ways, its seasons, its flowering and its fruiting, he
accepted the charge of these acres not as a burden, but as though
an unrequited passion had been suddenly returned. His heavy
spirits lifted. Whether his mother's gift of authority came of
her necessity or of her acknowlegment at last of his manhood, he
could not tell, nor did it matter.</p>

<p>He was surprised that she had given him complete freedom of
decision. He was somehow not surprised at her refusal to admit
that Benjamin was gone perhaps forever. He had best leave her
unmolested in her dream.</p>

<p>The fire in the round-bellied stove had died down. He built it
up until the isinglass front glowed red. He sat close, leaning
forward in his mother's Boston rocker, and was still cold. A
bleakness lay over the room, over the house, that was of an icier
substance than the winter temperature. The large sitting-room was
well proportioned, with bay windows on two sides to let in the
sun and the sight of trees and flying birds, the barns, the
rolling contour of the farm. Its cherry, pine and walnut
furnishings were solid and good, as were the furnishings of all
the other rooms, yet none had sat here in content or ease. The
warmth and vitality of the land were strong past harming. The
dwelling house was chill with human misery and always had
been.</p>

<p>He wondered how far back the Lindens went in time, as Lindens,
and which was the first to start the strange, interlocked,
unhappy and often violent chain. He knew nothing of them past the
first one in America, a Hollander, whose name of Lindh'oeven, or
something of the sort, (there was an old deed in the attic with
such a name) had become simplified with pioneer usage and
spelling to "Linden." This was in the middle 1600's, and the
Hollander had married a Frenchwoman. An English strain came in
somewhere later. Amelia was second generation Scotch-Irish, with
all the Scot dourness and none of the Irish lilt. He had heard
that the Irish were supposed to be a light-hearted people, but
the only signs of it, certainly, had been in Benjamin.</p>

<p>Perhaps the trouble had begun with his immediate grandfather,
Arent Linden. He had moved inland from the Hudson River valley,
had taken up a large tract of land, and had two sons, Joshua the
elder and Ase's own father, Hiram. It seemed to him that it was a
repetition of the Biblical story of Jacob and Esau, one son
beloved, the other despised, for Arent Linden and his Joshua had
made a pact with Hiram, that if he would help them clear six
hundred acres of land in this virgin place, would help them build
two houses, they in turn would help him clear three hundred for
himself, would build him a house, too, and a prosperous family
would establish itself in the wilderness. The betrayal had been
complete.</p>

<p>Hiram had worked for his father and brother, unpaid, merely
fed and clothed and sheltered, until he was in his early
thirties. The time came at last to turn to his land, to the
building of his home, and they had laughed at him. That could
make a man snarl at life. That could make Amelia, a bride no
longer young, in a log cabin, nurse her spite, like some half-mad
woman watering a poisonous weed in a flower pot. Yet it seemed to
young Ase that the greater the injustice that came to one, the
deeper would be the desire to give justice and warmth to one's
children.</p>

<p>His father had fought through, after all, had cleared his
land, which proved richer than that of the other two, had sold
his timber on a high market, had built at last his house, larger
if not so fine of line and contour as the earlier, more gracious
ones, and now was dead and unlamented. And Benjamin, who had
provided, carelessly, all this house knew of light and laughter,
was gone, taking the brightness with him. Ase considered the
spell cast by his brother on all who knew him, for spell it was.
It was conceivable that Ben would conquer the world, for he moved
like a whirlwind, catching up men and women breathless in the
brief gusts of his enthusiasm. It was also unlikely. Ase knew and
acknowledged his brother's instability. Ben's restless impatience
took always the apparently easy way, he raced light-footed and
light-hearted, his tawny hair, his cloak of charm, streaming in
the wind he created, until the swift feet met the smallest rock,
the shallowest ravine, the slightest thickening of the forest,
when he stopped confused in his tracks, then was off again in
search of a smoother path through a more open glade.</p>

<p>For this, Ase felt no criticism, but only concern. His love
was so vast a thing that he longed to clear away the rock, to
bridge the ravine, to fell the forest, ahead of Benjamin. If he
had received in return only the most casual affection, all the
more room was left in him for the longing, some day, to be truly
as one with his brother and so end his aching loneliness. He
could not take offense at his mother's blindness nor surely at
her own adoration of her elder. He had a timid hope that in her
loss she might turn a little toward him. He loved her, too, with
tenderness, and wished he might be other than he was, to please
her. He supposed he was difficult to care for, inarticulate and
brooding, unbeautiful and awkward.</p>

<p>Amelia had not come from her room. It was nearly noon. For all
her bravado, he knew that she was in torment. He went to the
kitchen and made a fire in the range. He prepared a meal as best
he was able. He went to the cellar for a bottle of elderberry
wine. He poured a glass of it and took it to her room.</p>

<p>She sipped the wine and nodded her thanks.</p>

<p>"Come, Mother. Dinner's ready."</p>

<p>His cooking was no worse than her own. She had done no baking
for a week and the bread was hard and stale. She was especially
fond of sweets and took a great deal of jelly with her bread and
tea. The wine and strong tea set her to talking with animation.
She told anecdotes of early hardships. Suddenly she frowned.</p>

<p>"Asahel, I want you to tear down the log cabin. It reminds me
of too many dreadful things. Anyway, it's an eye-sore."</p>

<p>To him the cabin was significant and beautiful. When the apple
trees were grown sheltering around it, the stone chimney, the
brown walls with white marl chinking, would seem those of a
little house in a fairy tale. For an instant he pictured himself
living there with Nellie Wilson, of whom Ben had said, "Better
marry Nellie in the spring." But Nellie was Ben's girl. She could
not be taken over as he had inherited Ben's discarded clothing;
could not be given away as Ben had given him their father's
watch. He set the thought aside and wondered how he might
dissuade his mother from the cabin's destruction. He had neither
power nor words to influence her. She had many irrational
impulses, and if he paid no attention to this one perhaps she
would forget it. Ben of course could have had her decking the
cabin with banners if the notion struck him.</p>

<p>His mind groped toward a question that had lain dormant and
festering in him all his life. There was something more in his
mother's passion for Ben and her coldness for him than was called
for by Ben's grace and charm and his lack of it. He had been a
toddler when she had struck him smartly because he made mild
protest that his older brother had run off with his new birthday
toy. Blinking through tears he refused to let fall, he cried out,
"Why?" and even then the question had held the larger
implication. From his mother's expansive mood he might now draw
his answer. His throat tightened, the words were hopeless
captives.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "At first I was happy in the cabin."</p>

<p>Her face was one he had never seen. Her eyes were half-closed,
the thin mouth was relaxed and soft, lifted at the corners in a
smile. The sallow skin glowed luminous, like an apricot in
sun-light.</p>

<p>"Very happy. I had waited so long. I was past thirty. Still
handsome, I believe."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes entirely.</p>

<p>She went on dreamily, "I could hear the spring bubbling in the
night. There was a red rambler rose outside the window and once
he reached his hand out in the moonlight and broke a spray and
laid it on my pillow. The thorns scratched my cheek and we
laughed together."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and leaned toward him.</p>

<p>"I have had two husbands, you know," she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, they were both named Hiram Linden."</p>

<p>She touched her handkerchief to her lips.</p>

<p>"Everything else was different. The minds, the bodies--two
different men. I loved the first one, oh yes, I loved him. I
lived with him a year. He died. He was killed, of course. Your
grandfather and your uncle killed him. For a year, he thought
they meant to keep their promise. Oh, the fine house, the cleared
acres, when they came to pay back his years of servitude! When he
knew the truth, it killed him. And why? Because he was a coward.
He died because he was a coward, and I told him so."</p>

<p>She wiped her wet forehead.</p>

<p>"The first man gave me my only truly begotten son, my
Benjamin, conceived in love. The second gave me you."</p>

<p>She looked at Ase and the adder's eyes did not flicker. He was
cold to his marrow. The answer was coming, it was sharp and
fanged, he would now avoid it if he could.</p>

<p>"I never lived with the second Hiram Linden as a wife. I
loathed the sight of him, I loathed his touch. He didn't give me
you, he forced me. He forced you on me. Not in love, not even
lust. No, in anger. I hated him to the last inch of his guts. And
I hated you."</p>

<p>She sat back in her chair. Her voice broke.</p>

<p>She said, "I can't help it. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>His first impulse was to take himself from the house of horror
at once, free her from the very sight of him, free himself from
her eyes and the ice of her voice. He went to the log cabin and
built a fire on the hearth and crouched before it. He thought
desperately of fetching his friend Tim McCarthy for comfort and
for council, then knew the matter was private and shameful and he
must look it in the face alone. He was stricken, a tangible knife
in his heart would be less painful, a kinder thing, than this
sharp-bladed knowledge. The fire died to embers and he sweat in
the cold cabin, then felt the chill and brought in broken boughs
to feed the fire again. The sun dropped toward its setting and
the pale gold filtered through the dusty windows. Well, then,
what had happened, after all? Only that where he had lived under
lowering clouds the storm had broken over him. What had been a
puzzling uncertainty, without meaning, was become a fact. He had
guessed and wondered, and now he knew.</p>

<p>He watched the fire until it was safely ashes. He stood up and
stretched his cramped legs. He drew a long breath in what seemed
a clearer air. The truth was a liberation. He could go on. The
earth was still solid under him. He felt a surge of pity for his
mother. Even as she rejected him, she needed him. Trapped in the
ruins of her life, he thought, she was also brave. He returned to
the house to find her staring from a front window at the empty
road. He stoked automatically the sitting-room stove. He could
find no words of comfort, but he laid his big hand on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>She said, not turning, "Why do you waste the wood?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase Linden had three friends and a flute. The oldest friend
was an Indian, Mink Fisher. Their natures, their gravity, had
spoken each to each when Ase had been four years old. The Indian
had come to trade. He had stood in the woodshed doorway tall and
straight, blanket-wrapped, black braids of hair over his
shoulders, an eagle feather in the band across his bronze
forehead. The little boy had thought, "It is the king of the
hawks." They had studied each other and then Mink had held out
his hand and Ase had walked to him and laid his hand in his with
a child's deep sigh of content. They had become as father and
son. From Mink he had learned all he knew of the lore of nature.
Through his boyhood and early adolescence the Indian had come to
him several times a year, often from many miles out of his way.
Now Mink had not come in five years. Ase grieved and longed for
him.</p>

<p>His second oldest friend was the gypsies. He thought of them
collectively, as he did not single out one grape from a cluster
or one marsh marigold from a field of marigolds. The gypsies had
been coming since he was six. They came every summer, camping by
the willow stream or near the cold flowing spring by the log
cabin. For the few days of their camp he was one of them. He came
then as close as was possible, for him, to neglecting his chores.
As a boy, he ran with the gypsy boys. As a young man, he sat with
the elders, danced and sang and ate and drank at their summer
nights' festivities. Of late, he had been closest to the
matriarch of the tribe, the Old One, the queen; to her husband
and to their daughter Elissa. Elissa stirred his blood so that
when he touched her in the dance he trembled like a colt. She was
an unlit bonfire ready for the spurt of his match. The Old One
looked on with approval, and he did not understand why or how he
had abruptly turned back with Elissa from the hemlock shadows
toward which he had been leading her on a soft June evening. The
gypsies had not appeared the summer before. Ase was fearful that
he had offended the pride of the girl, even more, perhaps, that
of her mother, the queen.</p>

<p>His third friend was Tim McCarthy. No king had sired McCarthy,
no queen had borne him. He was a drunken little old Irishman from
the bogs of Aran, a hired farm hand by necessity, a fiddler by
the grace of God and to the glory of man. Ten years ago he had
drifted into the neighborhood with his fiddle under his arm, a
bottle in his pocket, a dirty white she dog at his heels. He had
hired out first with Hiram Linden. He had lasted until his first
spree, when he reeled into the house, singing and fiddling the
bawdiest of Irish ballads. Amelia had had him off the premises
before the sun went down. Meantime, he and the lad of eleven had
become fast cronies. The little man, full of fables, his music
and his dog fascinated the boy in equal measure. The Wilsons, the
Lindens' nearest neighbors, two miles to the east, had taken Tim
on for a while. He was now reasonably settled yet another mile
east, to be near his young friend Ase, with a farm family who put
up with his instability in satisfaction over the lower wages he
was willing to work for. The little dog was dead, replaced by a
male of her progeny as white and dirty and devoted. When sober,
there was no better hired hand than Tim McCarthy. At all times he
was kind and gentle, and wise, save for the drink, which had him.
He had the Gaelic gayety and melancholy, like the streaks of fat
and lean in Irish bacon.</p>

<p>McCarthy had given Ase the flute, which he counted also as a
friend. Tim's fiddle had stirred the hearts of many a man and
woman in two lands and on the sea between them, but he had never
induced so rapt an absorption as in the thin, solemn boy who had
such trouble speaking. It seemed to McCarthy that Ase found the
music another and a richer language, one that spoke familiarly
and in which he might find tongue. He tried to teach him the
violin, but the boy's hands, already huge, were fatally clumsy,
and while he managed the bow well enough, his already gnarled
fingers could not touch one of the delicate strings without
impinging on another.</p>

<p>McCarthy said finally, "Me boy-o, 'tis hopeless. 'Tis like a
pair of drunken woodchucks stompin' on me fiddle."</p>

<p>Watching Ase piping one day on a willow whistle, McCarthy
lifted a finger and said, "Whoosh now. I've an idea born to
me."</p>

<p>He prowled the marsh for the proper hollow reed, and
carefully, his blue eyes intent, his cheeks rosy with excitement,
ruffling his white hair now and then in exasperation, he made
with his pocket knife a serviceable flute with half a dozen
stops. The day was Sunday and he worked from noon to sunset.</p>

<p>"There now," he said. "If it works, I'll be fitting a better
mouthpiece and trying to call back where the other stops should
go. Give a blast."</p>

<p>The boy had learned the crude, sweet instrument as though a
young bird learned to sing. McCarthy deprived himself of his
drink for several months, disappeared for five days, and having
walked the twenty miles each way to and from the city of Trent,
appeared again still sober and triumphant, with the gift for Ase
of as fine a flute, ebony and silver, as money could buy. On his
next month's wages he became magnificently drunk. Before he
collapsed, to be driven by Ase to his place of employment and put
to bed in his loft, the old man and the boy had played fiddle and
flute together in the hemlock woods until the birds flew close to
listen, and they looked up to see the Linden sheep flocked in a
semicircle before them. Tim had been so taken by laughter that it
made an end to the playing and he gave himself to finishing his
jug. Now Ase was twenty-one and McCarthy was in his late sixties,
and Ase was master of his flute. The pair was called on for their
music at all the country gatherings and dances. It was Tim who
did the trotting back and forth between the two farms, to visit.
Two evenings seldom passed without Ase's finding the little man
and his dog waiting for him at the barns when chores and supper
were done with.</p>

<p>From the coldness of the Linden house Ase had walked with
these friends into strange worlds, warm and golden. The world of
Mink Fisher had most nearly fed and satisfied him. It was primal,
enriched by Indian myth and legend of bird and beast, of cloud
and wind and spaceless sky. It was an amplification of the earth
he knew and there was nourishment in the stars.</p>

<p>The Romany world dazzled him with its freedom and its
brightness. It was spangled and embroidered, Oriental, exotic,
the open road its lamp and its god. Its songs around the camp
fire came from far away and long ago, songs of feuds and castles,
of roving minstrels, of dark deaths and gypsy passions.
McCarthy's Celtic world was fey, peopled with leprechauns and
fairies, with red-bearded kings and gold-haired queens who never
had been and never could be. There were fierce battles here, and
a deal of bitter injustice and the righting of it, and from
behind the mist that shrouded the green and silver landscape
there came the sound of a mysterious laughter.</p>

<p>These glimpses into distance, these few steps into magic
places, left Ase still the onlooker, still hungering to share
more deeply, to become a part of even farther realms and stranger
people. He had no friend of his own age. His longing for
closeness to his brother absorbed him. It did not occur to him to
seek a brother among his schoolmates or the neighbor lads.
Benjamin was the spring from which he must quench his thirst if
it was to be assuaged at all. He was stirred and touched by the
generosity of his three friends, taking their affection as a gift
past his deserving. He did not guess that they recognized in him
imagination and spirit like their own, a bigness of mind, a rare
understanding and tenderness that warmed them, too, made them
feel valued, as they valued him. He knew only that he was a
stranger and they took him in. They spoke to him and he was a
little able to speak with them. He found voice fully in his flute
alone.</p>

<p>Of the friends and the flute Amelia disapproved with all the
sting of her acid tongue. Mink Fisher was a slinking savage,
likely to murder them in their beds. The gypsies were roisterers
and thieves. McCarthy was a common Irish drunk. It was further
proof of the stupidity of her younger son, his unfitness, that he
made bosom companions of the scum of the earth, foreigners to
boot. She succeeded in imposing on him a certain sense of guilt
when he slipped away, as he must, to meet them. Otherwise he was
unshaken. He cleaved to his friends with quiet stubbornness. They
were of a noble goodness, he knew, and the core of his integrity
was impregnable to his mother's malice.</p>

<p>Her outright forbiddal of the flute puzzled him. She was not a
religious woman, save in a hard, perfunctory fashion. It seemed
only that in the dark place in which she chose to live, she was
determined no color, no warmth, no rhythm, should ever enter. It
was impossible to yield to her on this, either, for the release
of music was too great. To spare her, he took care to play with
McCarthy out of her hearing, in winter in the barn, warmed by the
body heat of the stock, in summer under the hemlocks by the
wintergreen bog. When the need came on him alone, he rambled over
the hills, piping as he went. He kept the flute hidden in a linen
handkerchief on a shelf in the haymow.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Wilsons were plain people. There was a large houseful of
them, good natured, hard working, earthy. From much of the
country stock the sons went on to become lawyers, physicians,
business men, teachers, but the Wilson boys and men were
unthinkable as anything but farmers, and the girls would always
marry men of the soil. They were a solid, continuing breed. Their
red barns were impressive, the house nondescript, but bright with
white paint and masses of old-fashioned flower beds. The interior
was divided into many small rooms, inartistically and comfortably
furnished, cluttered with Wilsons and the paraphernalia of the
men's boots and mackinaws, the women's sewing and canning and
preserving. Their table was famous even in a land of plenty,
laden three times a day with half a dozen meats, fruits,
vegetables swimming in cream and butter, pickles and jellies and
preserves, endless pastries, heaped together for handy
self-helping like a mediaeval hunting feast. For all the food
they stowed away with such cheer and relish, the Wilsons were
runty. Pa and Ma Wilson were a pair of wrinkled hickory nuts, the
boys were small and wiry, only the girls profited by the family
physique. They were merry little things with dozens of beaux,
fresh and appealing until age and child bearing should turn them
gaunt and withered as locust shells. Nellie at twenty was the
prettiest of the lot. She was diminutive and dainty, with plump
little breasts, apple round, apple firm, an impudent short nose,
firm, pointed chin and dimpled mouth, eyes the blue of wild
chicory, and gold-chestnut hair that rippled to her shoulders in
round finger curls. She was an incorrigible minx and a
mischief.</p>

<p>Amelia Linden condescended to the Wilsons. They were decent
enough, she admitted, if too much given to hilarity, undeniably
prosperous, but the men were not "gentlemen," the women were not
"ladies." She called them "common," and so they were. Nellie had
been Benjamin's girl since she was sixteen. It had approached not
quite a scandal that they had not married. Amelia had handled the
situation with a rare caution. Her early sarcasm failing to keep
Benjamin away from the girl, she had looked uneasily to the
future. She would detest any woman who claimed him, yet she was
terrified lest by her disapproval she alienate him. She
encouraged him in his prowlings elsewhere, slipping him money for
trips to Peytonville and Trent, yet when he returned, he would be
smoothing his hair with a wet brush like a pleased tom cat
washing his fur, and always off down the road two miles again to
Nellie. She had decided shrewdly that if it was Nellie he must
bring home as bride, she was safer with such a little snippet
than with a wife more worthy of him. His infatuation with the
pretty face and tiny round figure would pass, and she herself,
offering no criticism save an occasional significant lifted
eyebrow, would be entrenched and waiting, a constant contrast, so
that he should inevitably turn more and more to the superior
woman, in appreciation and relief.</p>

<p>Ase found himself increasingly haunted by thoughts of Nellie.
He had not seen her since his father's funeral two months ago. He
drove his mother to Peytonville to church on Sundays, but the
Wilsons attended church in another direction. There had been no
meeting of the Grange, and the Wilsons and Lindens, as families,
had never exchanged casual visits. Tim McCarthy had reported that
the sweet Nellie had been moping, but the lads were crowding in
again, like yearlings trying the fence, he said, now the big bull
was gone to other pastures.</p>

<p>Ase had tried to put out of his mind Ben's words, "Better
marry Nellie in the spring." He was uncertain how to take them.
Ben had often teased him about his mute admiration of Nellie. The
words might have been only another jest. Again, they might have
been intended as a seal on the finality of his leaving. Since Ben
was without subtlety, Ase came slowly over the weeks to the
belief that his brother had meant them literally, meant as well
that the miracle was possible.</p>

<p>The thought of Nellie Wilson began to creep in on him as
irresistibly as the sun reaching into dark crannies. If he might
have Nellie for his wife, he would be cold no longer, no more
alone. He dreamed of her by night and awakened with his heart
pounding. He acknowledged now what he had ignored through loyalty
to Ben, that Nellie was his true love and always had been.
Because of Nellie, hidden away, smothered, in his heart, he had
turned back from the hemlocks with the gypsy girl.</p>

<p>The time was February. Something was supposed to happen then,
what was it? He remembered. Ben was to have taken Nellie to the
midwinter dance of the Grange. He frowned at his stupidity. He
should have asked weeks ago if he might replace his brother as
her escort. She would have accepted another by now. He could not
picture Nellie as waiting. Not even waiting for Ben. If she
refused his invitation face to face, laughed at him, he knew that
he would stumble away from her, damned and lost. After his mother
had gone to bed he wrote laboriously by lamp light, and sent the
formal note by Tim McCarthy.</p>

<p>"Asahel Linden requests the pleasure of the company of Miss
Nellie Wilson at the Grange dance, if not too late in
asking."</p>

<p>McCarthy brought the answer in her round childish writing.</p>

<p>"Miss Nellie Wilson thinks it's high time Mr. Asahel Linden
was asking."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "It is most disrespectful to your father to
attend a dance so soon after his death."</p>

<p>Ase finished tying his black tie before the kitchen mirror.
She had always had some unreasonable reason against his
occasional excursions into the country festivities. Having had no
respect at all for her husband, fiercely satisfied to be rid of
him, and having no interest in the opinions of others, her
attempt now to deter him on such grounds struck him as
ridiculous. In his new understanding of her he decided that
denying herself warmth and communion and gaiety, she wished even
more to deny it to him. Any excuse served her, and he thought it
would be simpler if she made none, since she could not or would
not speak the truth about it.</p>

<p>She persisted, "You must cut a pretty figure at a dance, even
without the bad taste of dancing on your father's fresh grave.
You've outgrown that suit. Look at your wrists and ankles,
sticking out from the cuffs and trousers."</p>

<p>He had looked at them in his bedroom. The good black
broadcloth suit was three years old, and between eighteen and
twenty-one he had finished the last few inches of his gangling
growth. He supposed he must look like a scarecrow. Yet no one had
laughed at him, no one indeed had seemed even to notice. He
carried a dignity past harming by the chance of ill-fitting
clothes. He had always gone to the social gatherings, as he went
to Mink Fisher and the gypsies, under a slight cloud of
depression imposed by his mother. Now his deepset gray eyes were
without embarrassment or guilt. He was as he was, he and his
flute would be welcome. His mother's whip flicked over him
without the old pain.</p>

<p>She said, "You must feel out of it when you go to these
affairs. You don't even have a girl."</p>

<p>He would prefer not to speak, for something would be resolved
this evening, but he said, "I'm taking Nellie tonight."</p>

<p>She studied him, drawing her heavy black eyebrows together. He
was prepared for a storm of rage, or one of her familiar stalking
withdrawals to her room, as violent in their way as her words.
She surprised him by nodding after a moment.</p>

<p>"Very good. Very proper. You are a better brother than I
thought. You must keep the others away from her until Benjamin
returns."</p>

<p>He was not prepared for this. The Seth Thomas clock on the
lamp shelf whirred and struck the hour. He was due at the Wilson
farm this moment. Nellie would be sputtering. He had hitched Dan
to the light cutter before bathing and dressing. He wrapped in
carpeting the brick heated red hot on the range. He said "Good
night, Mother," and went to the carriage barn, placing the brick
under the straw for Nellie's feet. He untethered Dan, and on the
road touched the whip to him lightly. The young stallion's shod
hooves struck fire on the glazed snow. He was only fifteen
minutes late but all the Wilsons save Nellie had gone on. The
front door flew open. He had a glimpse of her against the
low-turned lamplight, bundled in a red cape and red fur-trimmed
bonnet, her curls escaping, her party bag swinging from her
mittened hand. The door slammed and she ran across the snow and
was in the seat before he could move to help her. He drew the
buffalo robe around her and her small gaitered feet found the hot
brick.</p>

<p>She said, "I almost went on with the folks. Be just like you
to forget to come for me at all."</p>

<p>He wanted to say that he was as likely to forget to breathe,
but although he cleared his throat to speak, no words came. He
was dizzy at having her close beside him, her shoulder against
his arm. He could not see her face in the dark night but he was
conscious of the round little shape of her, her warmth, a
vitality so electric that it seemed to him sparks would fly as
from Dan's shoes if he should touch her. The sleigh bells jingled
sweetly. Nellie chattered lightly, of neighbors, of other dances,
her voice, he thought, as silver as the bells. There was no
opening for graver matters. He was content in any case to absorb
her nearness.</p>

<p>At the door of the lighted Grange, she said, "I suppose you
brought your flute. Will you have to leave me much tonight to
play?"</p>

<p>He read her tone as wistful and he felt light-headed.</p>

<p>"They expect me to play, but I won't have to. I'd
rather--"</p>

<p>"You'll have to play some. I just wanted to know, how often. I
promised Sam Turner the dances when you're busy."</p>

<p>He helped her out of the sleigh and to the door, then turned
Dan into the stables, to tie his halter to a hay-filled stall, to
cover him with a blanket. He returned soberly to the hall. He was
on a fool's errand tonight. Or any other night. He had allowed
himself to be tangled in a weblike dream of his own making. He
had presumed on a meaningless remark of Ben's to build a cloud
castle where he did not belong and could never enter.</p>

<p>He saw Nellie at the far end of the long room, laughing with
half a dozen young people. She had a gift for women as well as
for men. The girls of her age accepted her with little envy, were
faithful friends. Older women respected her matter-of-factness,
her common sense in spite of her pranks, beyond all, her known
domestic talents. Ase watched her, yearning. She wore a flounced
dress of silk organza, the blue of her eyes, with a satin ribbon
the same color tied around her curls. The pert bow at the top was
a butterfly on golden wheat.</p>

<p>Tim McCarthy joined him, brushed and combed and in his Sunday
best.</p>

<p>He said, "You do be looking as forlorn as a rooster in the
rain. Pay no attention tonight to the Nellie's flirting. I'll not
call on you yet for the flute. Do you be dancing."</p>

<p>Ase made his way to Nellie. She gave no greeting, but still
laughing, tucked her arm in his by way of acknowledgment and
claim.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm not playing for the first dance, Nellie."</p>

<p>McCarthy went to the raised platform. He had kept away from
the liquor, so that he might be at the disposal of the company.
He was ready to play as long as they cared to dance. The little
man seemed a full head taller. He came into his own as head
fiddler and caller. He tuned his violin with authority. There
were a second fiddle, a guitar, a harmonica and an accordion. Tim
sensed that the dancers were eager and yet shy.</p>

<p>He called out, "A good evening to all. Now we'll be having a
bit of a warm-up."</p>

<p>He gestured to his orchestra, and set off on an Irish jig. The
Mahoneys and the Shehys tittered, looked at one another, and the
two middle-aged couples took the floor for the jig. The wild
dance shook the solid new boards. Everyone clapped in tune, other
feet thumped and shuffled to the irresistible lilt. The ice was
broken. When the Irish couples ended, red-faced and sweating,
bowing to the applause, all were ready for the square dance. Old,
half-forgotten men and women took their places, standing straight
as possible. Children who knew the figures paired off without
self-consciousness, practised swinging and sashaying earnestly.
Ase bowed before Nellie and led her out. He was proud of her, his
heart was too big for his chest. She was almost as pretty as he
thought her. Aunt Jess the midwife swam onto the floor like a
ship in full sail, leading Grandpa Wilson, twice her age and half
her size.</p>

<p>McCarthy lifted his bow, called, "Face your pardners!", the
music of "Turkey in the Straw" burst out, and the square dance
was on. Tim was as fine a caller as a fiddler. He had
imagination, so that he varied the figures between the simple and
the intricate, the restful and the exhausting. The old folks
thought they felt young again but found themselves saving their
strength, those of courting age injected a subtle lure and
passion into the formal figures, the children danced frowning and
with concentration. Aunt Jess had been at the hard cider and was
dancing with abandon, a mistake for a woman of her bulk. Yet
Grandpa Wilson was plainly having quite as good a time. The big
woman and the little man were sashaying with the best of them.
Nellie was a blue-and-gold feather, and Ase came as close to
grace as he would ever come, his long legs moving like pistons,
huge gnarled hands lifting Nellie clear from the floor when he
swung her. The rhythm of the dance was joy, its community was
release.</p>

<p>The ancient ones swore they had never been less tired, the
lovers wandered away to corners, the children slid and swooped
and jostled one another. The music was insistent, the dance
almost too intense, and it ended sharply. All the dancers were
relieved to collapse on the chairs and benches around the walls
of the hall. McCarthy mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>"Come now, Asahel my friend," he called. "Let us play only a
little quiet song while the dancers rest."</p>

<p>Ase went to him and picked up his flute.</p>

<p>"That gypsy love song," Tim whispered. "While not truly
restful, 'twill give the folks back their breath."</p>

<p>In the beginning there was a chatter of talk, the children
scrambling, and then the gypsy song took over, and spoke to each
man, each woman. The tremulous violin made the young uneasy. Was
love to prove so sad as this? The flute cried to the elders. One
wrinkled hand groped to find another. Had love been after all so
sweet? So sad, so sweet, the ancient song assured them. The last
note faded away, to be a ghost again. The hall was hushed. In the
silence a child wailed loud and suddenly, being frightened by the
magic. McCarthy laid down his fiddle and Ase his flute.</p>

<p>McCarthy whispered, "May be we've done too good a job of it.
'Twill take us a mort of thumpety music to liven them up
again."</p>

<p>When he judged the dancers ready and rested, he gave the lead
in "Little Brown Jug" to the guitar and encouraged the squeaking
second fiddle and the harmonica.</p>

<p>"Do be twanging it up, boys," he called out, "fast and lively.
Some of the gentlemen need to be working off the hard cider."</p>

<p>The laughter overlay the brisk tune, small boys whooped, the
dance resumed.</p>

<p>There was a pause at midnight. A light supper was served. The
drinking men were sobered by the food. The full, sleepy children
were deposited on benches, on quilts on the floor, the older
women volunteering to watch over them. The younger women changed
their dresses, as was the custom, for the strenuous dancing had
them perspiring and disheveled. The prettiest dresses were saved
for the last hours of the dance. The atmosphere of courting was
as positive as lightning. Girls arranged their flounces,
tightened their corset strings, pulled their bodices lower,
slapped their cheeks and bit their lips to redden them, used a
trace of rice powder surreptitiously, a drop of scent at their
breasts. The dancing was less boisterous. Waltzes and the
Virginia reel replaced the square dances.</p>

<p>McCarthy led off in "Good-Night, Ladies," and called out,
"'Twas a fine evening and I'm hoping you are appreciating my
sacrifice, staying sober. Another time, I'll not be finding
meself so noble."</p>

<p>The girls changed their slippers, bundled into warm cloaks and
bonnets and mittens, the mothers gathered the sleeping children,
the men went to the stables to hitch the sleighs. The pre-dawn
was clear and cold. The snowy road was a silver carpet-runner
under the stars. Nellie snuggled under the buffalo robe close
against Ase.</p>

<p>She said, "You'd be warmer if you weren't all bones."</p>

<p>They drove in silence. It was unlike her not to chatter. This
was the moment, if he was to speak at all. He had taken too much
for granted, he was certain. Surely Nellie would be waiting, like
his mother, for Ben's return. If not, if the field was open, how
could she consider having him? And if the impossible were
possible, what of Amelia? He had not been prepared to have her
consider him a watchdog for Nellie, a eunuch guarding the gate
against the prince's coming.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase--."</p>

<p>He turned his head. Her face was graver than he had ever seen
it.</p>

<p>"Ase, Ben's not coming back."</p>

<p>She pushed back a curl from her forehead.</p>

<p>He said, "I didn't think you knew."</p>

<p>"He told me. Ben played fair, in his way. Did he tell you,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The horse was pacing and the sleigh bells were noisy. Ase drew
on the reins. Dan snorted and slowed to a walk.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I thought you might be waiting for him."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I was a fool to wait as long as I
did."</p>

<p>The way was clear for his question and he could not phrase it.
She put her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Well, Ase? Ben say anything about you and me?"</p>

<p>His heart thumped painfully. Ben's words seemed unfeeling,
unsuitable.</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"He said to marry you in the spring, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Now, Ase, you don't have to ask just because Ben said
so."</p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled in the starlight. He had had no words of his
own, he had used his brother's and he was trapped in them. Surely
she must know how he had adored her, Ben's girl, from a distance.
The cords were tight in his throat.</p>

<p>"I want you--"</p>

<p>"Oh. That's different."</p>

<p>He wanted to cry out, "I want you with my spirit and my loins,
with every bone and nerve of me, I want you for warmth in my
house, in my heart and my bed."</p>

<p>His love was suddenly stronger than his awkwardness. He
dropped the slack reins and took her in his long arms. His lips
found the warm hollow under her firm chin. He felt her stir
against him. She took his face in her mittened hands and pressed
her mouth to his. Her kiss was long and hungry. She pushed him
away, breathing pantingly, like a cat. His blood raced like the
water over the mill-dam, so that he thought it must spill from
him as violently.</p>

<p>Nellie said primly, "I haven't said I'd have you."</p>

<p>His pulse slowed. How could she have him? He wanted to say, "I
am a poor stumbling thing after the glory of my brother, my feet
bound to the earth, my head lost in the clouds, but I have my
love and my faithfulness to offer."</p>

<p>He said, "I know. How can you?"</p>

<p>She was grave again. She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"You're a good man, Ase Linden. That's how. Ben and I--never
mind--that's over and done with. Ben wasn't for any one woman. I
always liked you next best. I shouldn't have teased you. I knew
how you felt about me."</p>

<p>The east was streaked with red and gold. Light glinted on the
sleigh bells, on Nellie's curls. Ase seemed to see her for the
first time, fair as the mythical woman all men dream of. Her eyes
were honest, somehow anxious, somehow sad.</p>

<p>She said, "I'll make you a good wife, Ase."</p>

<p>The road turned into the Wilson farm. Lamps were lit in house
and barn, for the men would do their chores before breakfast and
then have a few hours of sleeping. Ase held her again, but
tenderly, with humility and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Nice to get it settled," she said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The sun rose behind Ase as he drove home. The faint warmth
touched the nape of his neck, reminding him of the feeling there
of Nellie's mittens. The snow-piled roofs of the red barns were
rosy. The large white Linden house was snow-capped, too, the
drifts were piled to the windows. It would be not much longer
aloof and bare, unwelcoming.</p>

<p>He changed his clothes to do the morning chores. He moved
quietly, not to disturb his mother. Since Benjamin had gone, she
slept late, making no pretense at preparing breakfast. He built a
fire in the kitchen range and put on the coffee pot and the
double boiler of oatmeal. The handling of the milk and cream and
butter had devolved on him.</p>

<p>He went to the dusky cellar and lit a lamp there. The Jersey
cream was nearly an inch thick in the wide shallow milk pans. He
skimmed most of it into an earthen crock, saving out a pint
pitcherful for table use. He poured the skimmed milk into a
bucket for the hogs. In the kitchen he rinsed the pans in the
zinc sink fed by a rain-water cistern pump. He pushed the
bubbling coffee pot to the back of the range. He took the pig
slops in one hand and the clean milk bucket in the other and went
to the barn for the milking. He fed the stock and returned to the
house, to strain the foaming milk into yesterday's clean pans,
and carried them carefully down to the cellar shelves. The
hanging shelves were planned for family quantities of canned
fruits and pickles and jellies, but they were almost empty. A jar
of preserved quinces would have been palatable for a winter
morning's breakfast.</p>

<p>The sun poured through the east window between range and sink.
He laid a red and white checkered cloth on the kitchen table and
set two places. He hoped Nellie would continue to have breakfast
in the kitchen in cold weather. The warmth of the range, the
crackling of the burning wood, were pleasant. Amelia was still
sleeping. He ate a dish of oatmeal with crumbled maple sugar and
spoonfuls of the thick yellow cream while the bacon fried in an
iron skillet. He set one plate of bacon in the warmer for his
mother. To his own he added eggs poached in the fat. He made
himself toast. The butter dish in the pantry was empty and he
went down-cellar again for a fresh crock. Something was the
matter with his coffee. Even the golden cream failed to turn it
to a pleasing color, it was gray and unsavory.</p>

<p>He washed his dishes and the morning's milk pans and bucket,
scalding them with boiling water from the kettle, and set the
milk things on a shelf in the woodshed. He brushed his crumbs
from the table and left the wire toast grill handy for his
mother, with eggs ready for soft-boiling in a small saucepan. The
barn needed cleaning, the sheep were nearly out of fodder, but
these chores could be done later. He went upstairs to his icy
bedroom, undressed to his underwear, and got into his cold bed.
His head was thick but he could not sleep after all. There was
too much joy to be savored, and with it, too many plans to be
made, the problem of Amelia to be mulled over. He had hoped she
would join him for breakfast, so that in leisure over their
coffee he might give her his news and try to answer whatever
might be her inevitable objections. She had disparaged Nellie to
him and to his father, well out of Ben's hearing, but she had
accepted her for Ben's sake. If Nellie would do for Ben, she
would be not only suitable for him, but likely to be considered
too good for him, as was his own opinion. Yet Amelia had approved
his taking Nellie to the dance as a means of keeping her safe for
his brother. He decided there was nothing for it but to convince
his mother that Ben would not be claiming Nellie, ever, because
he would not be coming home at all. He drowsed, imagining Nellie
close beside him, and went sound asleep at last.</p>

<p>When he awakened it was two o'clock in the afternoon. He
pulled on his clothing and went downstairs. He found a note on
the kitchen table from Amelia. It was her sewing circle day and
one of the members had stopped in, driving by, fortunately, as
her son had failed to appear to hitch the horse and sleigh for
her. He wondered at her faithfulness to the circle, which sewed
for foreign missions, for she was neither sociable nor friendly
with neighbors or fellow church-goers, nor a good seamstress, nor
interested in the heathen poor. Actually, she had joined a group
composed of the simplest of farm women, for to them she was both
queen and oracle. She returned from the luncheon meetings richly
fed of belly and of ego.</p>

<p>Ase made himself a light meal and ate absently. He washed up
and swept the kitchen floor. He brought the accumulated cream
from the cellar and turned it into the wooden butter-churn. The
faint sourness had a clean, fresh smell. He set the churn a few
feet from the range to warm a little. The clock struck three. He
was restless. The barn work was not too pressing. There would be
time to walk the two miles east to see Nellie before the evening
chores. He wanted to set a wedding date, he wanted to prepare her
for his mother. He hesitated. Half at least of the large Wilson
family would be sitting about the house on a cold winter
afternoon. There would be jesting and no privacy at all.</p>

<p>He heard footsteps on the gravel path, lighter than his
mother's, and then Nellie's voice, calling to her dog. It seemed
for a moment that he heard these sounds only in his daydream. If
not, perhaps she was not coming here, but was passing on her way
to some other place and person.</p>

<p>She called, "Ase! Wake up!" and beat with her little fists on
the paneled door.</p>

<p>Shep was barking with excitement, as though his mistress were
calling to a man in danger in a house on fire. Ase was too slow
to open the door to her. She was in the room, the dog delighted
behind her. She wore her red hooded cape and had a basket on her
arm. It occurred to him that she was Little Red Riding Hood, with
the wolf transposed, because of her, into this amiable
sheep-dog.</p>

<p>He said, "Nellie. I've been thinking about you."</p>

<p>She took off her cape and shook imaginary dust or snow from it
and laid it over a chair in a curiously domestic manner, as
though the chair, the room, the house, were already hers.</p>

<p>"You always just sit and think."</p>

<p>She lifted the lid from her basket and handed him a plate
covered with a napkin.</p>

<p>"I saw your mother go by with Mrs. Barnes, so I made you a
pie."</p>

<p>He was deeply touched. He took the plate, staring at it.</p>

<p>"Well, open it up, Ase. Maybe you don't like pumpkin."</p>

<p>He removed the napkin. The plate held only a mound of
flour.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ase, look what I've done. Brought you the wrong plate.
Now I remember, I just sat and thought about making you a pie and
then forgot all about doing it. Well. But I guess your mother has
all kinds of good pies and you wouldn't want mine, anyway."</p>

<p>This was surely malice, for Amelia Linden was famous for her
distaste for cooking, for the execrable products that resulted
when she did finally turn to stove and oven. Nellie laughed. She
swooped into her basket and brought out the true pie,
golden-brown and redolent.</p>

<p>"You should see your face, Ase. Oh my--."</p>

<p>Her laughter was that of a child, high-keyed and
delirious.</p>

<p>He smiled sheepishly. He should have known this was another of
her jokes. Yet he wanted to turn her over his knee and spank her.
She had raised his spirits so high, then dropped them down again.
But after all, she had indeed brought him a pie. He could not
tell which was honest, the jest or the gift. Since she was
Nellie, perhaps both.</p>

<p>He said, "I'll eat it for supper."</p>

<p>She looked critically around the room. She had not been in the
house since the home funeral service for Ase's father. A small
couch stood near the bay window. She sat down and patted the seat
beside her, for him to join her. He put his arms around her. She
gave him a quick cool kiss and pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Never mind that now. I saw a chance to be alone with you to
make our plans."</p>

<p>He said, "I'd have come to you, but your family--"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I know. Well, don't you think the sooner the better?"</p>

<p>He was stirred that she was as anxious as he.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nellie, I do."</p>

<p>"I can be ready in a couple of weeks. I'd like to be married
at home and then come straight here. All right with you?"</p>

<p>He reached for her in answer but she stood up impatiently and
walked around the room, studying it. She frowned.</p>

<p>"I've got to do something with this awful house. I'd like to
get it fixed up and feel settled by April. I want to spend most
of my time outdoors at planting time. I want a big garden. That
little thing you've had is a disgrace, not enough stuff for the
table, let alone canning for winter. I want to start flowerbeds
and get things growing at the front of the house, anyway. It
looks like a barn without any plants or shrubbery."</p>

<p>She sat beside him again and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Think I'm going to have to fight your mother to do things my
way?"</p>

<p>He took her small capable hands in his big ones.</p>

<p>He said gravely, "She won't mind anything about the house or
garden. But Nellie--."</p>

<p>She looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? You don't think she'll make a fuss about
our marrying, do you?"</p>

<p>He nodded in misery.</p>

<p>"Because of Ben, I suppose." She was thoughtful. "Why? Ben
walked out on me."</p>

<p>"She won't believe he isn't coming back."</p>

<p>"Oh. I'm supposed to turn into an old woman waiting for him,
just in case her precious takes the notion to show up and claim
his property. Well, he won't, and I won't. She can go to the
devil."</p>

<p>She was adorable, he thought, in her flushed anger. It was
part of her vitality, a warm, sputtering, healthy explosion
unlike the cold venom of his mother's rages. He stroked her
hands.</p>

<p>He longed to tell her of his mother, to enlist her
understanding and her pity, yet would not betray one woman to the
other. He thought again with pain of the hurt they must inflict
on her, if she were to accept their union.</p>

<p>He said, "You'd better tell her what Ben told you about his
going."</p>

<p>"I'll tell her, all right. He said one reason he was clearing
out was to get away from her. Said she drove him crazy."</p>

<p>"Nellie, no."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't kill her. The old dame's tough as hickory."</p>

<p>"Please, Nellie."</p>

<p>She laughed suddenly and patted his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I'll behave. She won't raise half the hell as if
it had been Ben. I'm getting a good farm and a good husband and
I'm going to make a good job of it."</p>

<p>Her matter-of-factness made love-making impossible. She
relaxed against him with the bland ease of a kitten that has had
its supper and is ready for a warm lap, but chooses not to be
caressed. She allowed him to hold her, but slapped away his hand
when his fingers strayed to the fascination of her curls. She had
enough of snuggling shortly, and left the couch to prowl through
the dining-room to the kitchen. He followed at her heels, and
Shep the dog followed, both of them watching her in anxious
adoration. She gave her verdict on the kitchen. A good scrubbing,
fresh varnish, ruffled red and white gingham curtains at the
window, some bright braided rag rugs on the bare floor, would
make it passable. She touched the churn.</p>

<p>"Your mother's let the cream get too warm. Her butter'll be
soft."</p>

<p>"I did it."</p>

<p>She looked at him, moved the churn in front of a chair and
began plunging the wooden dasher up and down. The butter came,
too quickly, she said, and soft, as she had predicted. She asked
for cold well water from the outside pump, worked the butter in a
bowl, asked for a mould, but there was none. She packed the
butter in a crock and sent him down-cellar with it. She washed
and scalded the churn, speaking with disapproval of the kitchen
furnishings. She poured glasses of the fresh butter-flecked
buttermilk and lifted her eyebrows when no doughnuts or cookies
were to be found to serve with it.</p>

<p>"No wonder you're all bones. You don't get enough to eat."</p>

<p>He was enchanted with her bustling domesticity, her air of
kitchen command. She belonged here already. She glanced at the
clock.</p>

<p>"I ought to be going, but I want to have it out with your
mother and get it over with."</p>

<p>Amelia came near sunset. She walked through the front rooms,
removing bonnet and gloves, and stopped short in the kitchen
doorway. Ase rose to greet her.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Good evening, Mother Linden."</p>

<p>Amelia stared.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Visiting."</p>

<p>"So I see. Since when does a young woman call on a young
man?"</p>

<p>"When they're engaged."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Asahel, suppose you give me a reasonable
explanation of all this. I'm not in a mood for this girl's
flippancy."</p>

<p>His throat was dry. He swallowed. He looked imploringly at his
mother and then at Nellie. The most gracious and soothing of
words, even if he could find them, would not be adequate.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Speak up, Ase."</p>

<p>He said, "Nellie and I are going to be married, Mother."</p>

<p>He saw the storm move in on her. She would kill him with a
shaft of lightning if she could. He braced himself against her
eyes, her voice.</p>

<p>"You traitor. You miserable skulking oaf. You trip over your
own feet and then plot to fill your brother's shoes. Behind his
back, you wait until his back is turned, you sneak in and steal
what's his, like a weasel."</p>

<p>Nellie said mildly, "I'm hardly a chicken on a roost, Mother
Linden."</p>

<p>Amelia turned. Ase wished Nellie had not spoken. He had long
borne the fury, could bear it now, he had hoped to spare her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this treachery was your idea, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Actually, it was Ben's."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? He'll expect you to be waiting
for him when he comes home. Don't think I want you for him, you
aren't fit to wash his feet, but he chose you, I was ready to
accept you because it's what he wanted."</p>

<p>Nellie's eyes were blue fire. She walked close to the dark
woman. A small fierce hawk faced a coiled snake in deadly battle.
"Now listen to me. I'm going to marry Ase and you're going to
accept that, too. Ben's gone for good. He told me so. He told Ase
so. The last thing he said to each of us was for us to marry. Ben
didn't want me for keeps. Ase does. I'm Ben's nice little present
to Ase. It just happens it suits me. It suits me fine. Ben won't
be back. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Amelia gripped the back of a chair. Her knuckles were white.
Her hands went limp and she sat down slowly. "No," she said.</p>

<p>Nellie reached for her red cape and threw it around her
shoulders. She snatched her empty basket. The dog Shep came from
behind the range where he had slunk uneasily.</p>

<p>She said to Amelia, "I don't intend to quarrel with you,
either. We're going to live pleasantly. I'm going to have things
comfortable and nice."</p>

<p>Amelia said hoarsely, "You can't come here."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can."</p>

<p>"You can't live in my house. If you do this thing, this
betrayal of my Benjamin, you can't live in my house. You'll have
to go to the cabin."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>Nellie set down the basket and spoke more patiently.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mother Linden, I know you're upset, but you've got
to face facts. Now you hate to keep house and I like it. You like
good food and you don't lift a finger to cook. I'm going to set
the best table in the township. It makes sense for me to take
over and run things."</p>

<p>Amelia dabbed with her handkerchief at dry lips.</p>

<p>"I'll move to the cabin myself."</p>

<p>"All right, move there. A good idea. You can eat with us and
not have any responsibility at all. You'll find you'll like
it."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on Shep's head.</p>

<p>"Come on, boy. Be dark before we get home."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Wait, Nellie, I'll hitch up."</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I'll walk off the rest of my mad."</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe and kissed him lightly on the cheek. She
touched Amelia's cold hand.</p>

<p>"It won't be so bad, Mother Linden, once you get used to
it."</p>

<p>"When is this happy event to take place?"</p>

<p>"I told Ase, the sooner the better. Two weeks. Good
night."</p>

<p>She was out of the house in a swirl of cape and curls. He
heard her swift feet over the crunched snow and the joyful bark
of her dog. He wanted to hurry after her. He started for the
door.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Asahel!"</p>

<p>Her voice was hysterical.</p>

<p>"She said the sooner the better. Don't you see? She's carrying
Benjamin's child."</p>

<p>He felt a sick numbing. He was mired in a nightmare and could
not move nor escape. She twisted her hands together. Her words
came in a rush.</p>

<p>"She tried to trap him. He doesn't know, of course. He
wouldn't have gone if he'd known. She disgusted him and he went
away. She found she'd sprung the trap, but then he was gone. So
now she's trapped you."</p>

<p>He shook his head like a tortured bear.</p>

<p>He recognized in anguish that it was possible.</p>

<p>"It isn't true, Mother. But if it was--I'd want her."</p>

<p>More than ever, he thought, more than ever, to protect her, to
protect his brother, even, the child.</p>

<p>"You'd take his leftovers? You'd take up where he left
off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother."</p>

<p>The clock ticked in the silence. The range had not been lit,
nor the sitting-room stove, and the house was chill. He
waited.</p>

<p>Amelia said in a low voice, "If I ever needed proof you were
born a fool, this is it. Very well. I wash my hands of it. You
may make your accounting to Benjamin. He would prefer to give his
own name to his child, even by that hussy. You'll have a pretty
time explaining your presumption when he returns."</p>

<p>She gathered her wraps and went to her room.</p>

<p>He sat thinking. The picture was clear and without offense.
Nellie and Benjamin, volatile alike of nature, had struck a
spontaneous fire, and Ben had certainly possessed her. She was
not with child, Ase knew. She was honest enough to have told him.
He knew, too, with horror, that his mother had committed herself,
almost insanely, to the conviction of her eldest's return, and
would twist facts ruthlessly to fit that conviction. He wished he
might have had Nellie to wife free of the dark sucking bog
through which his slow feet must move, across which his wordless
thoughts must find their way.</p>

<p>He was late getting to his chores. He milked and fed the stock
by lantern light. He strained the milk in the kitchen and put it
away. He washed his hands and face, and then his hands again, as
though something more unclean than the good animal smell might be
washed away. He was not hungry, but he looked about for materials
for a supper. In his absence at the barn, Amelia had been in the
kitchen. She had made herself a pot of tea and had eaten a large
wedge of Nellie's pumpkin pie.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c07">VII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Linden house on their wedding day was as ready for Nellie
as Ase could make it. It was at least immaculately clean. He had
engaged a girl, Hulda Svenson, of a new-come Swedish family, for
the past two weeks. She had given the first week to cleaning and
preparing the log cabin. Amelia, trapped in her own angry
decision, had moved there, taking the best pieces of furniture
from the house. She had settled down in self-imposed martyrdom,
slyly pleased with what she considered her new weapon. Her
treacherous younger son and his scheming bride had put her out of
her own home. Benjamin would be outraged by their treatment of
her when he returned.</p>

<p>Ase brushed his black felt hat and looked about. The
wood-boxes were freshly filled. Hulda had cooked and baked
generously, had laid the dining-room table with a white linen
cloth and the best china and silver, for two. She had brought a
table bouquet of fern and geraniums from her mother's house
plants. The windows shone, the cleanliness emphasized the
bleakness. The sitting-room was bare without the cherry secretary
and the walnut center table. He dared not leave strong fires, but
the dampered stove and range would hold considerable heat for an
hour or two. He put on the broadcloth greatcoat that had once
been Ben's and was too short of sleeve for him. The March day was
raw and he would be more comfortable in the old buffalo coat, but
its shabbiness seemed unsuitable. He walked to the cabin and
knocked on the door. Amelia opened it a crack.</p>

<p>She said, "You're wasting your time. I haven't changed my
mind. I'm not going. I want everyone to know exactly where I
stand. Go on."</p>

<p>She closed the door. He turned away. He drove in the light
buggy against a blustering wind toward his marriage. There were
no more than half a dozen carriages hitched at the Wilson place.
The guests were Nellie's relatives and closest friends. Tim
McCarthy waited for him at the door. His presence was comforting.
Ase was unable to shake off the feeling that he was an outsider.
The Wilsons wore an unwonted solemnity. Nellie was their treasure
and the wrong bridegroom had come for her. He had an instant of
panic when it seemed that he was indeed taking what did not
belong to him. Ben should be here in his place. He should have
been the one to go and Ben to stay.</p>

<p>He saw Nellie with her father by the fireplace banked with
house plants. He had expected to see her in bridal gown and veil.
She wore a dove-gray silk suit, the only bridal touch her
flowered toque with a wisp of veiling. She was matronly and
collected. The costume, he supposed, was tactful. The preacher
motioned. The ritual drew him into its formal pattern.</p>

<p>"Do you, Asahel, take this woman--"</p>

<p>His blood hummed in his ears. Her hand was warm in his.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>With all his heart, oh, with all his heart. McCarthy handed
him the ring.</p>

<p>"With this ring I thee wed."</p>

<p>It was a gift from Tim. It had been his mother's and
generations before her had shone on the hand of an Irish
chieftain's bride. It was wide, of hand-beaten reddish gold,
massive with some mystic, forgotten design. Nellie eyed it with
delight. She gave him a quick look of surprise and pleasure. She
lifted her face for the nuptial kiss. In the rear of the room Tim
broke into a soft tune on his fiddle. The Wilsons crowded
around.</p>

<p>The noon wedding breakfast was hearty. There was hard cider
for the men and elderberry-blossom wine for the ladies. The house
was like a bee hive with chatter, metallic with the clatter of
silver and dishes. Nellie moved here and there, exhibiting her
ring, accepting the guarded congratulations. The marriage had
astonished them all. Ase ate and drank patiently, shook hands,
watching for a sign from Nellie to be away from the confusion.
She left the room to give instructions to her brothers for her
vast pile of belongings. They would bring these to her the
following morning by wagon. There were chests of china and
linens, trunks of clothing, trays of ferns and flowering winter
plants, boxes of preserves and jellies and vegetables and fruits
of her own canning. The family had given her a cherry highboy and
table to replace those Amelia had taken to the cabin. Her dog
Shep was to be brought, and her mother cat with the last litter
of kittens. Shep leaped against her, aware of impending change.
She beckoned to Ase.</p>

<p>"This crazy dog will just follow me anyway, Ase. We might as
well take him with us."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She said, "Come on, let's get away."</p>

<p>They ran from the shower of rice and old shoes. McCarthy stood
with the buggy at the door, holding the stallion's head. Ase
handed Nellie in and turned to shake hands with his friend.</p>

<p>"You can come to the house now, Tim."</p>

<p>"Praise be. The barn's no place for fiddling. I'll wait a
decent time of days before rapping on your door."</p>

<p>He leaned close and drew Ase down to whisper in his ear.</p>

<p>"I'd not be telling the Nellie about the ring. 'Twould spoil
it for her to know it came from the McCarthys."</p>

<p>He winked and waved them off. Dan reared and set out at a fast
trot for his home stable, threatening to bolt for it. Ase needed
both hands to control him. The March slush flew from the wheels.
Bare tree limbs lashed against a gray sky. Nellie was silent. He
lifted her down at the Linden door. He was obliged to let her
enter the house alone, for Dan was plunging. When he came through
the woodshed into the kitchen, carrying her valise, she was
putting wood in the range. Shep had found a proper dog's corner
behind the wood box. He beat his feathered tail on the floor in
contented acceptance. Wherever Nellie was, Ase thought, was home
for both of them. He took the wood from her, filled the range and
opened the damper. He put his arms around her and laid his cheek
against hers. The moment was too profound for passion. She patted
his arm and drew away.</p>

<p>"Let me change my clothes, Ase. I've already got some smut on
this silk."</p>

<p>He and Hulda had prepared Amelia's front downstairs bedroom
but Nellie would have none of it.</p>

<p>"I can play her game, too. We keep her room just as it is, all
ready for her, for everybody to see. She'll draw in her claws
after a while."</p>

<p>She chose the large bedroom above it that had been Ase's
father's. It had a matching open fireplace and was well furnished
with hand-made black walnut and cherry pieces, including a large
four-poster bed with a hard horsehair mattress. Her own feather
bed would supplement. She would need another dresser for her own
belongings. She sent him downstairs. He built up the fire in the
sitting-room stove. Nellie appeared shortly, pert and pretty in
fresh blue and white ruffled gingham. Her hair was still pinned
on top of her head in the matronly fashion that had so dismayed
him. He felt for the pins with clumsy fingers and the loosened
curls fell around her face to her shoulders. She laughed.</p>

<p>"I was trying my best to be Mrs. Linden and you've spoiled
it."</p>

<p>He wanted to explain that she was little Nellie Wilson still
to him, and ever would be. He could only stand and drink in the
sight of her. The clock struck five of the afternoon.</p>

<p>She said, "You'll have to change your clothes to do the
chores."</p>

<p>He was unwilling to sit at their bridal supper in common shirt
and jeans. He kept a pair of overalls at the barn and he would be
careful. It was dangerous to leave her for a moment, he might
well only have dreamed her presence, might return to find her
gone.</p>

<p>He said, "Wait for me."</p>

<p>He took the milk bucket and went to the barn.</p>

<p>Nellie had the milk pans ready for his return. She had set a
few of Hulda's foods on the dining-room table. She was
frowning.</p>

<p>"Who set the table, Ase? It's laid for two. What do we do
about your mother? Take a tray to her?"</p>

<p>"Hulda took her everything this morning."</p>

<p>"Good for Hulda. Ready in a minute then."</p>

<p>She held her finger to the light, the red-gold of her ring
showing burnished.</p>

<p>She said, "Never thought you'd have anything so handsome for
me. Where'd you find it?"</p>

<p>He spoke the truth proudly.</p>

<p>"It was a gift from Tim McCarthy. It belonged to his
mother."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>As he watched, the gold seemed to turn to brass.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "A pity. I thought maybe it was valuable."</p>

<p>She took warmed foods from the oven. The hanging lamp shed
soft light and shadow over the white napery. He kissed her
gravely before they sat down. He said a silent grace of thanks
for her, presiding over their table. The wind blew in gusts down
the chimney, a pleasant intruder, like the dog, who waited
politely from the kitchen threshold for his own plate. Ase helped
Nellie with the supper dishes and put them away in the cupboard.
She would need a day or so, she said, to find where things
belonged, not that she was likely to keep them as they were. She
went upstairs ahead of him. He turned Shep out of doors for a few
minutes, brought a piece of old carpet from the woodshed for a
bed for him by the range, filled the wood box, wound the clock,
and went with a lighted candle to the bedroom. Nellie had put a
match to the fire laid on the hearth. It was blazing and when he
had undressed he blew out the candle.</p>

<p>She drew back the bed covers for him. There were lace and blue
ribbons at the throat of her night-dress. Her eyes were bright in
the firelight. Her breathing was fast. He was trembling but there
was no uncertainty in his strong arms and limbs. She met him
avidly. The miracle mounted on pulsing wings, soared over
spaceless peaks and throbbed away into the distance with silver
feathers fluttering. A hard beating recalled him, like a drum. It
was his heart. She was limp, her heart pounding, too, and he held
her tight, never to let her go, Nellie, his love, his own.</p>

<p>She said, "Well!"</p>

<p>The word had an odd note, as though she were agreeably
surprised. He stroked her soft hair. Her skin was silky as her
wedding suit. Her throat under his lips was like the down of
milkweed. His power surged again, he drew the night-dress from
her shoulder and kissed its roundness. She did not respond. The
firelight flickered high and he saw that her eyes were closed.
She was sound asleep. For an instant he felt abandoned in a
lonely valley. But she was such a little thing--. She looked more
child than woman, her cheeks flushed, her curls tousled on the
pillow. She was tired, he thought, as a child is tired. He held
her carefully, his arm cramping under her.</p>

<p>She roused toward midnight and came to him again. The great
wings bore him higher than before. Her response was that of some
famished creature finding food. When he released her, she was
panting.</p>

<p>He said, "Oh Nellie--."</p>

<p>Her breathing slowed. He reached for her, to draw her close.
She moved his hand from her breast.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep that way."</p>

<p>She turned on her side, away from him. She reached behind her
and touched his hand in reassurance.</p>

<p>"'Night, now."</p>

<p>He lay stiffly. She was not asleep. She gave a little sigh
that was neither of repletion nor of drowsiness. It struck ice to
him, as though a window had blown wide in a bitter gale. He had
fed her hunger. He would always be able to feed it. He knew with
a sense of desolation that the bread he offered, though it
nourish her, was without salt or leavening.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c08">VIII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The early morning mist filled the valley. The willow trees
along the stream lifted through it like cloaked and long-armed
travelers rising from a night of sleep beside the water. The mist
was milky, holding a subtle nourishment for the young leaves of
maples and the pale timid buds of wild apples. Oak and beech and
elm still brooded, leafless. The earth in late April was
expectant. The winter wheat pushed up green spears anxiously,
long confined by snow. A lone phoebe spoke from the woods, not
quite singing.</p>

<p>The team of horses snorted the damp air from their nostrils.
Ase's feet behind the plow sank deep into the moist loam. He was
reverent before the first spring plowing. It was better than
anything except the harvesting. The growing period was too
disturbing, with its threats of undue rains or untimely drought,
of unseasonable frost, sometimes of summer hail. No, it was the
sowing time was best. Who knew then, scattering the seed, what
fabulous crops, what strange magnificent ear or head of grain,
might not follow? He felt so, too, about his unborn children.</p>

<p>The sun brushed the last of the mist from the willows. The
thin pendulous arms showed a pale green covering. A flight of
red-winged blackbirds circled over the marsh, late this year, Ase
thought, in their homecoming. Turning at the end of a furrow, he
looked up at the house. He saw Nellie come into the side yard and
begin hanging out the washing. At this distance, she was a little
girl pinning up doll clothes. He saw Shep race around the corner
and make off with a blue shirt from the basket, the wet arms
trailing. He reined in the horses to watch Nellie give chase,
around and around, her curls flying, until Shep allowed her to
catch him. Then she was bending over him, and when she released
him, the dog was wearing the blue shirt, his front legs through
the sleeves, the collar buttoned around his shaggy neck. He heard
Shep's barking and Nellie's impish laugh.</p>

<p>He clucked reluctantly to the team. His grave young face was
as softened with its smile as the square house with the morning
brightness. The shirt would need to be washed over again anyway,
and Nellie must have her fun. She was a constant and incredible
delight. She had plunged into her home-making with gayety and
zest. She was a lamp in a dark house, a fire on a cold hearth,
food on a bare table, and she had brought him in from the
outerness to light, to warm, to nourish him. Ase was a little
eased of his fears for her content. Yet his knowledge of their
shared loss kept his brother always in his mind. He plowed
abstractedly all the morning until he heard the ringing of the
great bell calling him to dinner. The massive iron bell was hung
above the loft of the carriage barn beside the house, and he
smiled again, thinking how Nellie made a game, too, of ringing
it, falling clownishly flat as she pulled each time on the heavy
rope.</p>

<p>The noon meal was on the table when he had finished his slow
stabling, watering and feeding of the team and had washed up at
the outside pump. Nellie was pouring coffee. He took the pot from
her and set it back on the wood range. He tousled her curls with
his big hands. He kissed the back of her plump moist neck. She
was not for the moment amorous and she squirmed away. She pushed
the two big cups of coffee into his hands and he took them to the
dining-room. She followed with hot biscuits. She would indeed
seem a little girl playing house, except for her efficiency and
talent. She moved with the quickness of a wren and had the house
immaculate within an hour each morning, except on the strenuous
weekly cleaning day. Even his abstraction about food recognized
her genius as a cook. The winter supplies were going fast, but
she worked miracles with ham and bacon and poultry, with puddings
and pies and tarts from her wild berry jams. The windows had come
to life with her curtains, with ferns and potted geraniums and
fuchsias. She pointed to the table bouquet of wilting spring
violets.</p>

<p>"Bring me back something fresh this evening. Trillium's nice,
the red ones."</p>

<p>He had smelled arbutus under the leaf-mold in the hemlock wood
by the bog, but by the time he had finished the slow chewing of
his mouthful of food, to tell her, she was chatting about her
garden plans.</p>

<p>She said, "Listen!"</p>

<p>It was seconds before he heard the wheels on the road, the
"Whoa!" and a wagon stopping. Nellie looked the table over
quickly, estimating the amount of food, and was at the back door
at the moment of the unmistakable peddler's rap. It was to be
hoped it was the familiar tinker, for the Linden house pots and
pans were too meager for her needs, but it was a stranger. He was
a little man with red cheeks and nut-brown eyes. Shep greeted him
amiably, recognizing the good earth smell of clothes and body.
The peddler cradled a bundle of twigs in his arms.</p>

<p>Ase, behind Nellie, said, "Good day, sir."</p>

<p>The little man bobbed his head politely. Nellie poked his
bundle. He lifted one finger, warning of a mystery and a
revelation.</p>

<p>"Guess! You'll never!"</p>

<p>She said, "Fiddle. It's kindling. I want pie pans."</p>

<p>"They just look like kindling, child. Oh, but the life's in
them. They're full of sap."</p>

<p>He nodded and pulled the sacking aside, as though he showed
the face of an infant.</p>

<p>"Apple trees! And peach in the wagon, and pear and plum and
cherry. Imagine!"</p>

<p>His zest was contagious. He was as full of sap as he claimed
for his twigs. Ase felt an excitement. He had been inquiring
where he might buy fruit trees, and now they arrived at his door,
an orchard come to him of its own accord. The clock struck half
after noon. Nellie bustled to china cupboard and kitchen, laid a
place for the visitor, brought coffee and poured buttermilk and
water.</p>

<p>"Sit down and have your dinner, and talk your business with
Mr. Linden. I've an errand," and she busied herself with a wicker
basket and was gone.</p>

<p>The peddler heaped his plate and sighed. He bowed his head an
instant, more in gratitude to Nellie than to God. Few tables this
time of year were so bountiful.</p>

<p>"You are kind to a traveler, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>Ase cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"The name is--?"</p>

<p>"McCarthy, sir. McCarthy."</p>

<p>He held a chicken leg sidewise, like a fiddle-bow, and Ase
knew now what the man would say as he was saying it.</p>

<p>"I have a brother in these parts somewhere. What delicious
chicken, juicy inside as my saplings. Heard in Ohio he was around
here."</p>

<p>He lifted the drumstick. "And who do you think told me? If I'm
not mistaken, your brother, Ben Linden. Unless there's other
Lindens, 'twas your brother. But no mention of the little
lady--your sister, your wife? This gentleman said his brother
might be interested in fruit trees. Excuse me," and he reached
for a wing, "and my own brother Tim resided in this
township."</p>

<p>He dispatched the wing and buttered a biscuit.</p>

<p>"If Tim can be said to reside."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Tim McCarthy works at the farm east of my wife's
people, the Wilsons. He comes here often, when his chores are
done."</p>

<p>"Well, now. I thirst for the sight of him. So my brother's
here and yours is out there. Ohio. Where I raise my beautiful
fruit trees. They call me 'Apple McCarthy'."</p>

<p>The strawberry preserves drew one hand, the biscuits the
other.</p>

<p>"Your brother Ben, now, he was planning to leave Ohio soon.
My, these are wild strawberries, ain't they. Nothing like the
wild small fruits for flavor. But my trees are cultivated,
grafted, no runts amongst 'em. Biggest apples you ever see, and
the peaches, my."</p>

<p>Ase struggled to ask the impossible question.</p>

<p>"Ben--. My brother."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Ben Linden. Didn't do as good as he expected, he
said. Had him something lined up farther out. Heading on west, he
said. Years too late for the California gold, he said, but silver
was promising. Fine young man. Make his pile some day, sure.
Couldn't decide should he take his Ohio girl with him. Don't do
that, I said, they get prettier farther on you go. How he laughed
at that. Right you are, he said. Would that be gooseberry jam?
Thank you. Now, the fruit trees. How many can you use? Don't let
me hurry you."</p>

<p>Not as well in Ohio as he expected--.</p>

<p>What had Ben expected? The Ohio farm lands were said to be so
rich that by the time a man finished dropping the seed corn, the
first kernel had sprouted. But Ben would never look to land to
make his fortune, unless to buy and sell it. That too would seem
dull to him. He was forced on, to the west, toward gold and
silver, toward some fabulous cave of diamonds. Ase wondered if
the Pacific Ocean would halt his brother. Perhaps when he reached
that far watery line, he would turn and retrace his steps. But
years from now. Years from now. Ben would make the continent last
him a long time.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "I especially recommend my Albemarle
pippins."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I've been wanting a sizeable apple orchard across
the road. I want mixed fruit trees for the house. But isn't fall
a better time for setting?"</p>

<p>Speech was not so difficult when he talked of things he knew,
of crops and trees and stock.</p>

<p>"I see you know your business, young man. Fall's much better.
But if we get plenty of rain, you'll have a year's start. And a
young fellow with as strong a back as yours wouldn't kill himself
if he had to water a few acres of saplings. Come on out to the
wagon."</p>

<p>Ase realized that he had forgotten his mother's dinner and
that Nellie had taken it to her at the cabin.</p>

<p>He said, "I'd like my mother and my wife to have a say. I'll
get them."</p>

<p>He turned back.</p>

<p>"When you give my mother news of Ben--."</p>

<p>The little man nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can trust me. I carry messages for families clear
across the country. Every mother's son is half Midas and half
saint."</p>

<p>He winked.</p>

<p>"Helps business to bring good news. But you now, you're a man
that draws the truth."</p>

<p>Because Amelia was not ready to let him go, for fear that he
would carry away with him some undelivered word of Benjamin, or
from him, Mr. McCarthy was persuaded to stay the night. The
evening was the first pleasant one with his mother since Ben had
gone. Nellie had been bland in the face of her animus, but the
air was constantly tense. Amelia drew from the peddler long and
loving messages direct from her son, along with Ohio incidents in
which he played a splendid part. She swallowed them whole in her
hunger. Amelia turned once sharply, to catch the girl unaware at
the talk of Benjamin. Nellie's pretty face seemed as unconcerned
as that of a puss meeting last year's Tom. When the supper table
was cleared, Nellie covered it with a red baize cloth and washed
the dishes while the men began their figuring.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Mr. McCarthy, this farm is mine, but I consider
that my elder son holds a third interest. With my third, I must
express my choices as representing two people, where I do not
agree with my younger son."</p>

<p>McCarthy asked politely, "Would the land where the orchard's
to go be representing any special third?"</p>

<p>"No, the farm has not been actually divided."</p>

<p>"Then would you be taking the word of a man wise in orchards,
if nothing else in the world? This assortment I have written down
here will give the finest fruit for family uses and a large
market crop besides, to put money in the bank for all of
you."</p>

<p>Amelia nodded. The list was Ase's own. Nellie smiled, putting
away the extra raspberry tarts in the cupboard. She lifted a
finger and McCarthy half-lifted one in return. The little lady
would have her snow-apple tree, and the old termagant none the
wiser. The list would include Grimes Goldens, Greenings, pippins,
russets, Maiden Blush and Northern spies. A crab apple tree would
go either side of the smokehouse, and along one line of the
enlarged fruit and vegetable garden, a row of pear trees,
Bartlett and Seckel, two peaches, a freestone and a cling, a
sweet cherry and a sour, a Green Gage plum and a Damson. McCarthy
had six grape vines left, Concord, Niagara and Delaware, and an
arbor was planned north of the wicket gate. He had a dozen poplar
saplings. The Linden house had long needed tall trees before it,
for softening. Nellie's heart was set on maples, but the poplars
were almost providentially at hand. The poplar was a sad tree,
but it grew sturdily and fast. Ase had always liked the tapering
spire, the rustling together, like restless hands, of the leaves.
Nellie agreed to the purchase and planting.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "'Tis strange now, this place has been waiting
all these years for McCarthy to bring you the fruits of the
earth. What a sight 'twill be, all the colors in harvest time of
a patchwork quilt. There's the total figure--."</p>

<p>Ase studied the column gravely. It would take almost all his
reserve cash. He had hoped to hire an extra hand this summer.
That would have to wait, and he would have to put in longer hours
of his own. But all his seed was paid for, he would soon have
lambs and calves to sell. He could spare the coming colt. Nellie
had already brought the hens into higher egg production and had
half a dozen brood hens setting early.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "Ten per cent replacement for any dead in the
fall. Ten per cent off for cash. 'Tis a good deal for me, for
you'll be taking all my stock before it dries on me."</p>

<p>Ase brought out the tin cash box. Apple McCarthy looked away
tactfully while he counted out the money. Amelia leaned forward
and swept it into three rough piles.</p>

<p>"There. We'll say the orchard's owned three ways. You can put
the three names on your receipt, Mr. McCarthy."</p>

<p>Ase stared at the divided cash. The slips of engraved paper,
the disks of metal, had been last year's wheat and corn, to be
exchanged in turn for other rich and living things, if only the
willing labor of a strong man's back and hands. The money seemed
now not the gift of fruiting vines, but an unclean medium for
human division.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "That's right, Mother Linden."</p>

<p>She winked at McCarthy. Their quick little minds met like the
juncture of two bright brooks. He picked it up.</p>

<p>"Right indeed. You'll be marking off the unborn orchard, so's
if it has to be watered in a dryness, it's every man for himself,
and God, I suppose, to take care of the watering of Benjamin's
portion."</p>

<p>Amelia's spite retreated, like a snake crawling away.</p>

<p>She said, "Why--I didn't mean it that way. Only to make things
clear."</p>

<p>"And clear they are, to McCarthy surely. The receipts, Ma'am,
here you be."</p>

<p>She said, "I'll go back to the cabin, Asahel. No, don't come
with me. Just light my lantern. Good night."</p>

<p>McCarthy sighed after her.</p>

<p>"Ah, but families do be a mixed up business. 'Tis that has
kept me a bachelor man. There's more peace amongst the
apples."</p>

<p>The soft spring night was suddenly violated by a dog fight, a
mild one, only the token bravery of Nellie's Shep against an
intruder. The intruder proved after all a friend, for it was Tim
McCarthy's little white dog. Tim stopped the argument and came
through the door, the two dogs wagging themselves behind him. He
looked around timidly.</p>

<p>"I've been lurking about 'till the old lady should be
leaving," he said. "Pray God 'twas not some other lanthern
flickering down the road."</p>

<p>He was struck by the stillness, and then he knew his
brother.</p>

<p>"Ah--. 'Tis you--. These many years now."</p>

<p>The two small men, as like as bird eggs in a nest, wrapped
short arms around each other, thumped each other's backs, and
wiped away an Irish tear or two.</p>

<p>Ase thought, "This is why I trusted the stranger's dry twigs
instantly. I knew him for the same as Tim."</p>

<p>An almost physical pain struck him. He longed to have himself
and Benjamin enwrapped as closely as these two other
brothers.</p>

<p>Tim said, "To the glory of God, I brought me fiddle with me,
and Ase here would be having his flute handy, and Brother, did
you not bring along your harmonica, I'll swear I never knew
you."</p>

<p>The music seemed to Ase the best he had ever known. Tim's
fiddle out did itself, the harmonica filled in all the empty
spaces, and his own flute was almost as sweet as he had ever
hoped for. It was Nellie, he thought, who made the difference,
even more than the new added instrument and the delight of the
McCarthys in their meeting. She patted her foot and laughed and
tossed her curls at the lively tunes, and when Tim twanged the
first notes for a gypsy song, she stood on tiptoe and lifted her
arms like a butterfly's wings, and danced and spun deliriously in
the Linden parlor that had so long been gloomy.</p>

<p>She brought cool sweet milk from the cellar, and doughnuts,
and they ate with a sleepy satisfaction. The McCarthys separated,
Tim to call his white dog to follow him down the road, his
brother to the Lindens' downstairs company bedroom.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, I don't like what your mother said about
owning the farm. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ben told me he was giving you his share. I thought your
father left the property to you two boys."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh. Then she can--. Has she made a will?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nellie, it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"It certainly does matter. I tell you, I don't like it at
all."</p>

<p>She cleared away the plates and went ahead of him to bed. The
house was still. Ase went to the cupboard and brought out Ben's
geography left from the Academy. He turned the pages slowly. The
United States of America. Here they were now. Here beyond and
south was Ohio. On the broad splayed map it seemed quite clear.
Here was the West. He pictured its spread and desolation. The
West went farther. Here was the end, the continent ended. This,
now, was the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Oh, Benjamin, my brother, he begged, stop there. I shall tend
the orchard.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c09">IX</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Apple McCarthy seemed to be made unhappy by Nellie's
breakfast. He eyed sorrowfully the pile of griddle cakes on his
plate. He poured maple syrup over them until his plate ran with
gold. He took a tentative forkful, laid down his fork, swallowed
a mouthful of the strong coffee lightened with heavy spooned
cream, and reached for the platter of savory sausages. He chewed,
staring at nothing, then pushed his plate aside.</p>

<p>"'Tis punishment," he said, "nothing but punishment."</p>

<p>Nellie lifted her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"What's the complaint about my cooking, Mr. McCarthy?"</p>

<p>The little man beat his chest with his fists.</p>

<p>"'Complaint!' says she! 'Complaint!' 'Tis the cruelty of life
I complain of, to be in Heaven and then kicked out again.
Lucifer, that's me, Lucifer McCarthy. If I could leave me
stummick here behind me, mayhap I could bear the road."</p>

<p>Nellie laughed.</p>

<p>"That's one way of asking for more hot cakes," she said, and
went to the smoking griddle on the range.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "Look now, Asahel Linden. Would this be fair or
would it not be fair? I to stay a bit to help you plant the fine
young trees, whilst Mistress Linden sets a place for me at your
table. No charge on either side."</p>

<p>Ase said, "The work is worth good wages, but I'm short on
ready money."</p>

<p>"'Tis a deal, then."</p>

<p>He buttered his fresh six inch stack of griddle cakes.</p>

<p>"Now I can eat me fill with a clear conscience."</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"Where on the blessed earth would I be getting better board
and company? After all, I but part with the little trees to pass
the time and make me simple living."</p>

<p>It was agreed that haste must be made on the planting. The
saplings had been long on the road. McCarthy had kept them moist
in their burlap wrappings. They were instinct with life, the
tight buds were aware of April, and if the stirring roots did not
soon find foothold and nourishment, an orchard would die
a-borning. With time to spare, it would have been best first to
plow the entire acreage, but the loamy soil was soft with spring,
grass and weeds yet tender, and Ase began the digging of holes to
receive the beginnings of trees. Apple McCarthy followed behind
him, expert with the setting, the tamping down of the earth.
Working back toward the log cabin at the end of the second row,
Ase looked up to see his mother staring from the window. She
appeared at the house for the noon dinner, but Apple had given
out of inventions concerning her Benjamin. She queried him
closely as to whether Benjamin was certain already to have left
Ohio. She had been thinking, she said, that she might ride there
in the apple wagon. Something had prevented her son's return, an
illness that he was hiding, or a temporary lack of funds. Or if
he was on the way to making his fortune, he would rejoice to have
her join him, at least for a while.</p>

<p>"I promise, Ma'am, he was leaving for westward close behind
me, and where you'd be finding him now, no man can tell you."</p>

<p>She did not appear in the house again.</p>

<p>The planting went fast and well. The completed field had a
strange appearance.</p>

<p>Apple said to Nellie in private, "At the moment, 'tis as
though the old harridan in the cabin had raised a crop of
witches' brooms."</p>

<p>The geometric pattern of stark black twigs was more of
graveyard than of nursery. Fire might have swept an orchard,
leaving this stricken residue. But the fire was in the mounting
sun, the sun unwrapped the sheathed buds with hot fingers,
showers came daily, the roots clutched and swelled, and one
morning Ase saw under the early mist a drift of palest green. The
young orchard was in leaf, it had come through, it was alive.</p>

<p>Apple McCarthy was reluctant to move on. Nellie complained of
the delay to her own kitchen garden and took him for helper
there. He used his horse and Ase's Brinly plow to turn the
ground. She was ambitious, and after the past Linden leanness the
fenced plot she planted seemed enormous. There were carrots and
beets, cabbages and turnips and rutabagas, Irish potatoes and
sweet, peas, tomatoes and lettuces, onions and sweet corn, pole
beans and simlins and patty-pan squash and cucumbers. Ase's
commercial planting would provide her with string beans, and
pumpkins and Hubbard squash were to be planted with his field
corn. She drove over the countryside in the light buggy
collecting seeds and slips of herbs from her friends, mint and
thyme, sage and dill, rose geranium, sweet lavender and
rosemary.</p>

<p>Ase plowed the apple orchard and sowed buckwheat broadcast.
Nellie turned from the kitchen garden to flowers, and Apple
McCarthy said it must be his last bit of helping, for the
potbelly her table had given him was in the way of his stooping.
She was up with the morning star, cooking breakfast by lamplight,
and by the time the birds were twittering sleepy fragments of
song and the pale early sun washed the polished floor and bright
braided rugs with silver, breakfast was over, Ase sent to Amelia
with a special tray, and Nellie was out of doors, digging as
busily as the robins pulling earthworms near her. Ase lingered in
his coming and going, to watch her, round and plump, her curls
damp over her intense, flushed face.</p>

<p>Tim McCarthy came every evening. The twilights lengthened. The
yard grass grew thickly and Ase herded the sheep across the road
to crop it smooth. Ase and Nellie and the brothers sat on the
sweet grass to play and sing. Shep beat his plumed tail beside
Nellie and her mother cat, bulging again, came from the barn to
sit heavily in her lap and purr. A lamp burned late in the cabin
on the brightest nights, and if Amelia heard and hated the sound
of music and of laughter, she gave no sign. Ase went several
times to say good night to her, but as his footsteps approached
her door, the light went out and there was no answer to his
rap.</p>

<p>June came in, the buckwheat made a tapestry for the embroidery
of the full-leaved apple saplings, Nellie's garden was up, with
satisfaction she picked the first greens and the first early
flower. Apple McCarthy hitched his well-fattened horse to his
wagon and was at last on his way, woeful in parting. The summer
passed in hard work, for Ase was single handed at heavy crops
that needed at least another hand. Nellie was in a frenzy of
canning and preserving. The mother cat littered behind the wood
box in the kitchen and Nellie moved in a welter of kittens until
the most ambitious climbed to the table and upset the cream, when
the whole batch was relegated again to the barn.</p>

<p>In August Nellie informed Ase that she was with child. She had
suspected it a month ago but was only now certain. The birth
would come sometime the following April. He was profoundly
stirred, but she was as casual as though she announced a pleasant
morning. A woman was wed, she tended her household, she bore her
children. She laughed at his gravity and tweaked his long
nose.</p>

<p>"If you'd worked a little harder," she said, "it would have
started earlier. I'd rather have my babies come in the winter and
have it out of the way by spring."</p>

<p>He supposed that the large size of the Wilson family made
birth to her more commonplace. He asked her permission to give
his mother the good news. She nodded.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later something will bring her around," she said.
"Maybe this will do it."</p>

<p>He found Amelia dipping water from the spring by the cabin. He
laid his hand on her shoulder. He could say only the few
necessary words.</p>

<p>"Mother, Nellie's going to have a baby."</p>

<p>She lifted the dipper to her thin lips, then poured the
remainder of the clear icy water over her hands.</p>

<p>"Of course. I told you myself. Very soon now, too."</p>

<p>She leaned over the pool and in its mirror carefully arranged
her crow-black hair.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c10">X</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Nothing was real to him except the scent of lilacs. He had
slept a little toward morning. Wakening, his thoughts were as
nebulous as the April dawn. He was suspended in a gray void, and
it seemed that he and Benjamin were dead together, and some other
with them, whom he could not place for the moment. He had not
meant to sleep. And had he slept, and was he now awake? When a
man closed his eyes at night he did not know whether he would
open them in the morning. And was he then dead or living? He did
not, himself, know. Only another, observing his breathing, could
say, "The man is not dead, but sleeping."</p>

<p>A breath of April wind stirred the curtains and the fragrance
of the lilacs came stronger and with it that sense of danger. He
started up from the couch and staggered a little. Nellie's
lilacs, that was it. Nellie had brought the lilac bushes from her
father's home, when was it, a year ago, and they were in bloom,
sickening of odor, and Nellie was in labor with his child. Now he
heard her cry. He went to the pump to splash cold water on his
face and hands, for it seemed only decent to be clean as he went
to her.</p>

<p>Aunt Jess the midwife met him at the door of the downstairs
bedroom.</p>

<p>She whispered, "The pains are coming faster. I think she'll
make it soon. Come in and speak to her."</p>

<p>He groped to the side of the great white-sheeted bed. Nellie
was as white, but veins stood out as blue as her eyes. Her curls
were wet on the pillow. She turned her head toward him.</p>

<p>An agony seized her and her face twisted. She moved her head
from side to side and moaned. The midwife gripped her hands.</p>

<p>"Bear down harder, Nellie dear, bear down. Aunt Jess is
holding on to you. Ase, you'd better get out. Call the girl. Get
my hot water going, lots of it."</p>

<p>He stumbled to the kitchen. He had kept a low fire all night
in the range, and in minutes he had it roaring, and pots and
kettles filled with pure spring water, and boiling. The Swedish
girl, Hulda, hired for the time being, came down the back stairs
rubbing the sleep from her eyes, then seemed to shake herself,
and went into brisk action. She trotted back and forth with hot
water and cloths warmed in the open oven. She took a moment out
to start a pot of coffee.</p>

<p>"Don't leave it boil over, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>He should be doing his chores, he thought, but he could not
bring himself to leave the house. The first ray of sun reached
the garden and pointed like a finger to a few early green
sprouts. Nellie had worked in the garden for an hour after her
first pains, her chubby little fingers scarcely reaching past her
great belly to press a plant here, scatter a row of home-saved
seeds there. It seemed to him that all planting of seed was a
man's work, but she had driven him out when he had finished
cultivating, fertilizing and laying off the rows. Green stuff
made good milk for the cow, she had said, and winked, and she
knew the way she wanted it. The hired girl scurried in for
another kettle of water, sweating.</p>

<p>She panted, "Coming fine, Mr. Linden. Don't look so
mournful."</p>

<p>The words were like a bone thrown to a good dog by the fire.
He felt lost, almost an outsider. The world had turned completely
female. He seemed to have had nothing to do with the child,
nothing with the woman. He was only tolerated in his own house.
The she-rites of fertility possessed it. He heard then the wail,
the strange, anguished, angry protest against human birth. He
stood up, shivering. Where had the creature of his making come
from, that it was so disturbed to leave? What would be his share
in making its life not quite as intolerable as the scream said it
feared? When the midwife at long last called him, her voice was
triumphant, that of an Amazon blowing a trumpet made for a
woman's mouth.</p>

<p>He walked past her to the bed. He had a moment's dread that
Nellie would turn her head away from him. How could a woman
forgive a man for so much pain? He had forgotten her own catlike
pleasure. He looked down at her. Aunt Jess had bathed her with
sweet-smelling soap, had dressed her in her bridal nightgown with
lace ruching at the throat, had brushed her shining curls and
tied them with a blue satin ribbon. Nellie's eyes were
twinkling.</p>

<p>"'Twasn't much fun," she said.</p>

<p>She arranged mysterious folds of cloth at her side, drew one
away to show the child, red, wrinkled, apparently blind, and
wretched. She puckered her own face in imitation.</p>

<p>"If 'twasn't a boy," she said, "I'd say, drown it. Guess being
ugly won't matter."</p>

<p>He stared. He had helped with the birthing of countless lambs
and calves and colts. He had come on baby squirrels and foxes in
their nests. This was his first sight of a new-born human. All
the other animal young arrived complete, contented. It was as
though they were born knowing--or not knowing--some fearful
secret.</p>

<p>He said, "I suppose he'll change. Nellie--how are you?"</p>

<p>She patted her stomach under the covers.</p>

<p>"Empty, thanks be. Empty of everything. I'm hungry."</p>

<p>The great bulk of Aunt Jess filled the doorway. Her face shone
like a harvest moon.</p>

<p>"Fine boy there, Ase. Never brought a better. You'll have help
on the farm before you know it."</p>

<p>He looked with a vast surge of pity at the miserable little
bundle of flesh. It was blood of his blood, flesh of his flesh,
bone of his bone. It would be a fine thing to have a tall son to
plow and harvest with him, to plant seeds and crops and fruiting
trees perhaps as yet unknown of. It was also shocking to imagine
this unhappy thing, now making sobbing sounds in its throat, as
already precipitated into the world, toiling with hard hands, its
back bent under more than weight of hoe or axe or pitchfork. He
yearned over his son and over his beloved who had borne him.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now maybe he won't want to farm. His Uncle Ben
didn't. Aunt Jess, go tell Hulda to fix me a big breakfast."</p>

<p>He reached out for her hand and knelt and held it against his
cheek. It was so small and warm, so strong and certain. His fear
for her fragility left him and he put his arms around her.</p>

<p>She said, "Better send Hulda down the road soon to call Ma.
You have your breakfast, then go bring your mother."</p>

<p>He had been astonished from the beginning by her patience with
Amelia. The venomous barbs had fallen away from her soft skin as
though it were underlaid with rawhide. He was touched now, and
grateful. Nellie had refused to have her mother in the house
during her labor. He believed that she had forbidden it to save
embarrassment at the exclusion of his own. Actually, her animal
instinct had insisted on the presence only of the capable
midwife.</p>

<p>Ase brought Amelia to the room before Nellie's mother had time
to arrive. Amelia might surprise them all, he thought, by
behaving well, but he felt safer to take no chances. She began by
speaking courteously enough.</p>

<p>"A boy, Ase says. That's good. Men are needed around here. You
don't look as if you'd suffered."</p>

<p>Nellie patted the blue satin bow. The glitter in her eyes was
surely a sign of well-being.</p>

<p>"Take a look at him. Pretty as his Pa."</p>

<p>Amelia eyed the infant.</p>

<p>"What will you name him?"</p>

<p>Nellie said, "We sort of thought you'd like to have another
Benjamin."</p>

<p>Ase was puzzled. They had agreed on the name of Nathaniel, if
the baby was a boy. Amelia stepped back from the bed.</p>

<p>"Haven't you any decency at all?"</p>

<p>Nellie's bright eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Why, Mother Linden, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Amelia was trembling.</p>

<p>"After you and Benjamin--oh, you are a shameless thing."</p>

<p>"You mean it would look as if it was Ben's baby. Guess you've
forgotten Ben's been gone a year and a half. They don't make
babies out of old women's nasty ideas."</p>

<p>It seemed to Ase that he must reach out to pull his mother
from this trap Nellie had laid for her. Yet perhaps Nellie had
been right, to force Amelia into the open, and so lay a ghost. He
laid a hand on his mother's arm. She shook it off.</p>

<p>"Forgotten how long he's been gone? Every hour's been a drop
of blood gone out of me."</p>

<p>She put her handkerchief to her lips.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Nellie, for what I suggested. I was--mistaken. But
I must forbid the name of Benjamin. He will want it for a son of
his own."</p>

<p>"Well, then, how about 'Nathaniel,' Ase? Call him 'Nat' for
short. You can stop a dog or a boy better with a short name, when
they're getting into mischief."</p>

<p>Amelia gathered her torn dignity about her and nodded.</p>

<p>"A very good name. It's been in the family. I, of course,
shall always call the child by the full name."</p>

<p>She turned to leave.</p>

<p>"But don't get the idea that the boy makes any difference
about the land."</p>

<p>The battle, then, was a draw, but with blood let on both
sides. Somehow the air was clearer. He opened a window, and past
the white ruffled curtains blowing, came the scent again of the
lilacs, not now quite so sickening.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c11">XI</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>McCarthy was playing his fiddle from the wintergreen beside
the bog. The last of the hayers had gone home in creaking wagons,
whistling to be done so early of an August day. Ase stood alone
in the high south opening of the hay mow. The new-mown timothy
and clover smelled as sweet as honey. The late afternoon sun
reached into it, as though long fingers fondled golden hair. Ase
liked the color and texture of hay at any time, even toward the
end of its life, when brown and dry as an old woman. It was most
pleasant at this moment of its fresh cutting, piled thick and
yellow in the big shadowy loft. Soon the mice would breed there
and squeak and scurry, the barn cats would climb the ladder to
hunt them, the hens would leave their own house with its trim
rows of troughs to steal their nests in the fragrant softness,
having at last to be helped down ignominiously with their broods
of downy biddies, to more conventional quarters.</p>

<p>McCarthy's fiddle grew harsher, the sound like robins
chirping. Ase smiled. Tim was signaling him to join him with his
flute.</p>

<p>A week of good work was over. His winter wheat had ripened
early, the thrashers had come, a twenty of them, the days had
been filled with the rich noise and confusion of the thrashing
machine, the talk and roars of laughter of the neighbor men come
to help, and since other wheat was not yet ready, they had stayed
on to help Ase with his haying. He would join his help to the
others, on other farms, a little later. Single-handed he had
raised a huge stand of heavy-headed wheat and could afford next
year a hired hand of his own. Wheat was bringing more than two
dollars a bushel, and after saving out next year's seed and
enough to take to the mill for the grinding of his own flour,
with middlings and good bran left over for his stock, and paying
the miller his tithe of the grain, he would have several hundred
bushels to sell for cash.</p>

<p>He took his flute from a broad beam in the hay mow. He played
a few notes on it. They fluttered like the cry of turtledoves,
joining the robins. He walked slowly up the sheep-lane, up
through the high south pasture, toward the bog.</p>

<p>The scent of the wintergreen, crushed by Tim's sitting, met
him, along with Tim's dog. He stooped under the low hanging
hemlock boughs and dropped down on the dark redolent carpet
beside his friend. The spot, so close to the menacing bog, was
secret and satisfying. From the high, shaded place he could see
the entire farm, with the great square house looking white in the
sunlight, and far away. An odor stronger than the wintergreen
came to him. McCarthy was drinking again.</p>

<p>Tim said plaintively, "Fancy now, the first time we've been to
play together since the past sweet springtime."</p>

<p>Ase put his flute to his lips.</p>

<p>"No, boy, now I have you alone for the instant, I'd be talking
a bit instead of making the music. I'm somewhat on the drink, and
feeling bold. I'll be reading your mind and heart, a thing part
happy and a thing part sad."</p>

<p>Ase stroked the head of the white dog and waited. It came to
him that he could only be at ease with those who read his mind
and heart and spoke aloud for him, where he was unable to speak
for himself. Benjamin had sometimes done this for him. This
little Irishman, twice his age, often did so, too. Nellie read
his heart, for all his wordlessness, but he realized with
discomfort that the trackless chaos of his mind had for her no
meaning. He corrected himself. It had had no meaning for
Benjamin, nor for McCarthy, either, nor the gypsies. The Old One,
yes, and Mink the Indian. Crushing a leaf of wintergreen between
his strong fingers, listening for what McCarthy, drunken but yet
wise, might have to say, he was swept by a wave of
loneliness.</p>

<p>Tim said, "You're after being so young, for the things have
come to you. You have the grand pretty wife, the right one for
you, and the baby son. You're by way of being prosperous, and
you'll be needing the prosperity, for one reason and another, the
new babes that will be coming, and the brother. Aye, the
brother."</p>

<p>He reached behind him and took a long pull from his jug.</p>

<p>"The brother. And the mother--. Now well I know, to cast a
slur on a lad's mother is to have him at the throat. I'd not be
doing that. 'Tis plain you love the woman, for all the harm she's
doing to you, and 'tis this harm of which I'd be speaking. Say
nothing, me boy-o, but let me tell it as I see it."</p>

<p>McCarthy had never before gone so far. The hostility between
him and Amelia had been quiet and tacit. It seemed to Ase that he
must stop his friend at once, for loyalty to his mother, but as
always, he could not answer.</p>

<p>"So, my Ase-one, you have the mother grieving for the other
son, and she will be making trouble for you and the sweet Nellie
until the end of her life. And what frets me, she'll be having
you feeling yourself the hired man on your own property."</p>

<p>Ase knew instantly and unhappily that Nellie had talked with
Tim.</p>

<p>Tim continued, "Your mother tells it up and down, not open,
but sly-like, how you're doing the fine job for Benjamin, and
it's pleased and astonished he'll be on his return to take over,
at the richness building, the new orchard and all. Now I'd not
see your heart be broken along with your back. I'm full of ideas,
and one is to have it out with the old harridan--excuse me, 'twas
me brother's word. Make her sign papers if needs be, not to find
your wife and babes by the side of the road one fine day."</p>

<p>McCarthy took another swig.</p>

<p>"You'd not spend the best of your life, would you, working as
you work, on land you held but temporary?"</p>

<p>Tim had opened a door to the small dark room he had been
avoiding. Ase entered it with relief. He had only half asked
himself too many questions. For all his joy in Nellie and the
child, in the crops like miracles, the orchard taking hold of the
earth with strong roots and young exultant branches, he had
suffered from his mother's hints and secret smilings. The first
unfaced question had been actually of her sanity. To deny facts,
to insist on fancies, was this what made for madness? It seemed
to him that every man and woman must do this to some degree, must
refuse in the privacy of the mind the unacceptable, taking for
truth in the heart the longed-for and desirable. No, he decided,
his mother was not truly mad. She had an obsessive love for her
absent elder son, but why not? Benjamin drew such love, as he
knew for himself. And it was not for him, the younger, quite
accidentally unloved, to condemn her vagaries.</p>

<p>He pulled a leaf of wintergreen and crushed and tasted it.
McCarthy and the white dog sat quiet. Ase dismissed the next
question as he asked it. Ben would not be ever coming home. Here
was perhaps the greatest anguish, for in his deepest love and
yearning for his brother, he feared that Benjamin was a lost
soul, would always wander, strong and beautiful and admired,
incompetent, reckless and futile.</p>

<p>But suppose he was mistaken, that Ben did return, either
prosperous as he had boasted, or broken by life. Why, then, the
way was clear. Nothing would give him greater content than to
share all he had made, had built, with his brother. Powerful or
crushed, Ben was so intimate a part of him that it made no
difference, Ben could receive all the enriched land or share it,
it was all one, when a man so loved his brother.</p>

<p>The land. Ase stroked the little dog. The land. Why, any man
had only temporary rights on the earth. His mother's talk of
control, of ownership, Tim's talk of legal rights and papers,
these were nonsense. No man owned the land. He wondered again how
long the earth had existed before the creation, emergence,
evolution or what-not, of humans. He had hoped to find the answer
in his copy of "Smith's Illustrated Astronomy and Poetical
Geography," but while he still pored of nights over the volume,
he was left unsatisfied. He asked himself now what he expected of
the land. A thought brushed him briefly as to what he expected of
life itself and he dismissed it. But the land. It was not what he
expected of it, but what it required of him. He felt himself on
firm ground. The land asked to be worked, to be taken care of
properly, and in return it would nourish all men, as long as they
were indeed its brothers.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "You are the most wordless man ever, but do be
saying in words, would you waste yourself working temporary?"</p>

<p>Ase said, "Why, yes. I would."</p>

<p>He could not understand his mother, nor even his wife, but he
had such pity for his mother, such adoration for Nellie, that he
would give his best to everything, land, mother, wife, child and
vanished brother, to go on steadily. His way was clear. He put
his flute to his lips.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "Then the saints preserve you. I've no more to
say."</p>

<p>He tuned his fiddle and lifted his bow. He led off in an Irish
lilt. By tacit consent the friends played the gayest of tunes.
There was no need today of the sad sweet songs that often eased
their shared melancholy. When the sun dropped low west of the
bog, Ase went to his belated chores. McCarthy clutched his jug in
one arm, his fiddle in the other, and staggered home behind the
little white dog. The dog watched over his shoulder, for there
were times when his master did not make it.</p>

<h2><a name="c12">XII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Nellie was cutting dahlias at the far end of the garden. Ase
stood motionless by the swinging gate to watch her, as though not
to disturb a hummingbird at its darting. She moved quickly from
one flower to another, laying the blossoms in a basket on her
arm. Beyond the cultivated flowers inside the white picket fence,
wild asters were autumn-blue and he saw that Nellie's dress was
the same color. The honey bees were working feverishly and wasps
spun drunkenly over fallen and rotting fruits. The smell of
harvest was everywhere. Nellie turned and came down the garden
path with her skimming trot that was like a plover on the ground.
His heart turned over inside him. Her simplest and most habitual
movement enchanted him. She saw him standing, tall and dark and
gaunt, his lean young face soft with his yearning. His moments of
obvious adoration brought out the most mischievous of the
constant imp in her. He opened the gate and took the basket from
her.</p>

<p>She reached up to put her arms around his neck and said,
"Close your eyes if you want something sweet."</p>

<p>He leaned low and self-blinded for the expected kiss. In an
instant she slipped a ripe Seckel pear from the basket and
crammed it against his mouth. She rescued the basket as he jerked
away, startled.</p>

<p>He sputtered, "Nellie!"</p>

<p>She said demurely, "I was going to kiss you, but look at your
dirty mouth."</p>

<p>He wiped away the crushed fruit furiously and glared at her.
She used her handkerchief solicitously to dab at his lips. Then
she laughed. He had never learned, wondered if he ever would, not
to fall into her traps. Each time that she tricked and upset him,
he was first angry, as she intended, then foolish and fatuous,
and she intended that, too. It did not matter. She was Nellie. It
was not so much that his discomfort gave her pleasure, he
supposed, as that his slowness, the very clumsiness of his
devotion, challenged her swift spirit. He sensed that he should,
this instant, spank her as she spanked the child Nat, and then
carry her upstairs and make some pretense at assault. She was
always most fevered after one of her pranks. Yet violence
appalled him, seemed both animal and stupid. He could not be
otherwise than himself. He took the basket from her and followed
her into the house.</p>

<p>He was aroused, too, his senses were acute. Fragrances
overwhelmed him at the kitchen door. They were mingled, as notes
in music mingled, as bird songs wove themselves together in the
spring. They were part of the richness of harvest time and of
life itself. Of life, he corrected himself, with Nellie. The
house, until her coming, six years ago, had had a musty, sterile
odor. He separated now one scent from another. Apple rings were
drying in pans at the back of the slow-burning range. There was
the smell of molasses cookies, of raspberry tarts, of clover and
buckwheat honey, of butternuts, hickory and black walnut nuts,
the spice of rose geranium Nellie had brought inside in fear of
sudden frost. Under the Brussels carpet in the dining-room and
the two front rooms, fresh oat-straw had been laid down during
Nellie's whirlwind fall house cleaning, both for winter warmth
and softness underfoot, and he was aware of the scent of that
too, a useable and comforting part of the harvest. He smelled the
freshness of the clean starched white curtains at all the
windows. He smelled the acidity of the dahlias and marigolds in
Nellie's basket, and under the flowers the pears, the heavy
panicles of grapes, purple, white and red, cloying in their
sweetness. It was almost too rich a time.</p>

<p>He was obliged to admit to himself that his mother's absence
was an important part of his pleasure. Apple McCarthy had written
that Ben had been reported somewhere in Indiana, having gone West
and planning to return there. Amelia had a cousin in the state
and had gone to her at once. Her plan, under the cloak of the
unquestioned relatives' long visits, was to search for her son,
hither and yon, in Indiana. With her going, a dark storm had
passed over, the doors had swung wide, the lavishness of autumn
had come inside. There seemed more room in the house, more room
in the world. He checked his thoughts in pity. He would give his
own contentment if he might so better furnish the cold empty
place in which his mother dwelt. Empty of all but Benjamin. There
seemed no question now but that her obsession had taken her a
step or two inside that palace of black ice where men are shadows
and shadows become men. She had called tentatively down the
labyrinthine corridors for her lost son, thinking she heard his
voice. A few steps further, and surely she would find him.</p>

<p>The house was comfortably warm, the sunlight streamed through
the polished windows, but Ase felt chilled. He went to the
sitting-room stove and touched a match to the pine kindling under
maple logs. He pulled a stool close to the blaze and held out his
hands to it, palms suppliant. He heard Nellie's quick small feet
upstairs, and small sounds that were Nat and the younger boy
Arent rousing from their afternoon nap. They seemed far away,
another man's wife and children. A gust of wind shook the poplars
beyond the house and cast a handful of yellow leaves against the
window, then dropped them to the ground. He had planted them, but
they were not his poplars. This was not his ground. This was not
his house. He was a stranger.</p>

<p>He passed one hand over his eyes and shook his head to clear
it. He was impatient with himself, ashamed. He had everything a
man could ask for. He wondered in horror if his adoration of
Nellie was not love at all, but only the panic of a drowning man
clinging to his rescuer. For she was rescue, truly. She was the
bridge between his isolation and the warmth and safety of life
itself. But his life was good. What was it then he wanted so and
needed? He had lost a father to death and a mother to a mania,
yet it was not a loss, for he had never possessed them. He had
lost his brother. He knew this for a positive pain. And he had
not possessed him, either. He asked himself if he wanted Benjamin
here with him, working the land against his will. He could not
ask this. Did a man's love consist only of the elements that
brought him comfort? And why one human being rather than another,
or was the love a thing nameless and faceless, given out of a
lonely need, as a child clutched a china doll or a rag wrapped
round a husk of straw, murmuring endearments? Should he have gone
with Benjamin, did he want only to be with him wherever he should
go? Or was it his destiny to be always unfilled and lonely? He
felt himself coming closer to a truth, and as his heart beat
faster, the truth evaded him.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, for goodness sake. Brooding again. I called
you twice. Here, watch the boys. And don't forget, the red
heifer's due to calve. Better keep her in the barn tonight."</p>

<p>He lifted his bowed head. She deposited Arent in his lap and
pushed young Nat toward him. He looked at his five-year-old son
and Nat stared back at him. From the beginning, the child had
eyed him with a certain coldness. He had made clumsy advances,
but from his cradle the boy had rejected them.</p>

<p>He longed to draw Nat close against him, to say, "We have both
arrived strangely on earth and shall depart strangely, and we are
related for the moment, so let us try to speak together, alien as
we may appear one to the other."</p>

<p>The little boy said, "You're ugly."</p>

<p>Ase said gently, "I know."</p>

<p>He realized that his sadness offended the child. Yet some
children were touched by adult grief, ran with small warm arms
outstretched, as though with prescience that one day they too
would be grown and even more sorrowful than sometimes happened to
them, as though by giving comfort now, they would store it safely
away for their own later need and use. Ase was conscious of an
unchildlike hardness in Nat. Astonishingly, Amelia had accepted
him. When her mind wandered, she called him "Benjamin's boy." Nat
spent long hours with her at the cabin. Ase wondered if Amelia's
tense resistance, her distaste for himself had been passed on to
the boy. In his own youth she had often said, "You know, Asahel,
you are extremely homely." There was something he should tell Nat
this instant, but he could not think what it might be. By way of
a lesson in consideration for others, perhaps he might say, "You
remember when you cut your finger? When you tell me I am ugly,
you hurt me inside, just as the knife hurt you." As he hesitated,
Nat ran from the room to the cookie jar, and then to find his
mother. Arent whimpered and Ase moved to a rocker and rocked back
and forth until Nellie came again. This child was not quite
three.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten the red heifer. He had a stall ready for
her, thick-bedded with clean straw. He joined the hired man Joe
at the barns, Shep at his heels. Nellie's aging Shep had finally
decided that following Ase was on the whole more rewarding than
following his mistress. She spent most of the time in the house,
and while he was a dog fond of his rug near the kitchen range,
beside the wood box, and returned two or three times a day for a
snooze, and to make certain she was there, and safe, the fields
and hills and woods with Ase were irresistible. He wagged his
feathery tail, for they were a little late in driving in the
cows.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I know, Shep. Come on."</p>

<p>The dog bounded ahead and met the cows, already gathered at
the pasture gate. The grass was short and dry, the nights were
growing cold, and they were anxious for the extra feeding and the
protection of the barn. Ase indicated the red heifer in the lane
and Shep cut her out, so that she might be driven to her special
stall. Ase saw the calf change position in her belly, her bag and
teats were swollen, and he prepared the things he would need if
she had difficulty with her first birthing. He gave her a wet
mash along with her hay.</p>

<p>Joe finished the milking. The hired man was not as clean as he
wished. A bit of trash floating on the foam of one bucket told
its tale of improperly washed teats. Ase deliberately poured the
cats' milk into their dishes from the cleaner bucket. When Nellie
saw the trace of dirt as she strained the other, Joe would get
the lecture he deserved, but which Ase always found it too
embarrassing to give. Unless one of his help was harsh with
animals, he offered no criticism. Every decently raised farm man
and boy in the section knew how work should be done, and it
seemed to Ase offensive to remind them. In the end, the example
of his own slow, steady perfection of labor was likely to convert
or shame them when they were remiss. Joe was leaving soon, to
work through the winter in a wagon-works. Tim McCarthy had asked
for the job, but Nellie with surprising tartness had not allowed
Ase to consider it. He leaned over to stroke the gentler of the
barn cats, washing their milky whiskers, and sighed. Tim was
indeed the most unreliable hand for miles around, too old for
much of the heavy work, besides, but he was his friend. Ase felt
uneasily that the time was coming when Tim would need actual
shelter, and he would like to have slipped him into his household
while he was not yet quite impossible. The red heifer mooed
anxiously. He studied her and rubbed her nose.</p>

<p>"Not yet, girl. Maybe tonight."</p>

<p>At the door of the kitchen he stopped and smiled to himself.
Joe was getting more than his sins warranted. Ase shared Nellie's
immaculacy, but her passion for it went to unreasonable bounds.
An outsider hearing her now would believe that Joe lived in a pig
sty and had added half its contents to the milk bucket. Joe came
out shaking his head.</p>

<p>He said, "Guess I'll go to town tonight if I can have the
wagon. She may start in again."</p>

<p>Ase nodded. He knew Joe was courting. He said, "Take the
buggy."</p>

<p>Joe's grin thanked him. He started to say, "Don't drive Dan
too hard," but then could not dampen the man's pleasure. Joe
washed up hastily at the pump and tiptoed up the back stairs to
his room to change his clothes. Joe should have hitched up before
he washed and dressed, Ase thought. Horse-and-leather was a good
clean smell, but a woman didn't want it all over a man's hands
when he touched her. He decided to take another look at the
heifer before supper, and while he was at it, he could have Dan
in the shafts by the time Joe reached the stable. The sun went to
bed under a piece-work quilt of the colors of the autumn leaves.
He was glad to be delayed outside, to stand and watch it. Nellie
was impatient with the fall of the year, for it meant a reduced
activity when all the harvest was in, too great a confinement in
the winter house for her liveliness. The season stirred him
deeply. A man could see what he had accomplished. There was time
to sit and think, when his slowness and his thought went
unnoticed. Perhaps his mother would return this winter with news
of Benjamin after all. Perhaps her Indiana visit would restore
her balance.</p>

<p>He waved Joe down the road, acceptably unodorous, and stopped
beside the poplars to look back to the south across the barns,
the fields, the softly rolling hills. The poplars had grown fast
and tall. The corn was in shock, and in the last of the sunset,
he saw it glinting golden, and the piled heaps of pumpkins as
orange as the late October sky. A blue haze hung over the
orchard. The orchard, he thought of it tenderly as Ben's orchard,
had produced its first large marketable crop. There were still
late apples to be picked that needed the touch of frost, the
Northern spies and the russets. These would be the tangiest of
all, and would keep all winter long in the stone cellar. The easy
summer apples had been sweet but insipid. He wondered, if
strength and goodness needed a touch of hardship to come to true
maturity. No, he decided, this was not necessarily so. His mother
had been subjected to the frosts and they had only made her
acid.</p>

<p>He washed with special care.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Did you let that dirty Joe take the buggy again?
The wagon's good enough for him. I don't care if he is courting.
You're too easy on the help. I'll tell you what you can do, Ase
Linden. Keep the buggy for your nasty hired hands. You can buy a
new one, just for me. I want one with red wheels and rubber
tires."</p>

<p>He could certainly afford a light rubber-tired buggy, just for
Nellie. He would break the three-year-old colt to it, and she
would have her own rig. He wished he had thought of it himself,
to have surprised her with the gift, perhaps drive it up to the
side door on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>He said, "Why, I'll order it this week."</p>

<p>Nat, staring wide-eyed, began to hop up and down.</p>

<p>He shrilled, "Dirty Joe! Dirty old Joe! Joe can't ride in my
mama's new buggy."</p>

<p>He clutched his mother's skirts and wailed, "Can I ride in it,
Ma? I can ride in the new buggy, can't I, Ma?"</p>

<p>She tousled the child's tawny hair.</p>

<p>"If you keep clean, the way Mama likes."</p>

<p>Ase's face twitched.</p>

<p>He said meekly, "Can I ride in it, too, if I keep clean?"</p>

<p>She recognized one of his rare, frail attempts at humor and
laughed. Nat stamped his foot.</p>

<p>"No, you can't! It's just for Mama and me!"</p>

<p>Nellie snapped, "Behave yourself, Nat. Papa can ride in it
because he's paying for it. It'll be his buggy and then he'll
give it to me."</p>

<p>Nat shrieked, "Give it to me, give it to me!"</p>

<p>"Now Mama will slap you in a minute. You grow up to be a big
man and make lots of money. Then you can buy all the buggies you
want, just for yourself."</p>

<p>"I won't have to let anybody ride in them?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want to, if you buy them yourself. They'll
be your very own."</p>

<p>"Oh, good!"</p>

<p>Ase was disturbed. A buggy, a wagon, such things were meant to
be shared with anyone who needed them. He had once loaned a horse
and wagon to a sick tramp, and it had been months before they
were returned to him, battered and worn, but the vagrant had
reached his home before he died. Ase did not want his child to
come to look on property as so personal, to consider it good to
exult in an exclusive ownership when another was in need. At the
same time, it did not seem suitable to correct the mother in the
presence of the boy. In any case, Nat was too young to
understand. He had noticed that children seemed innately selfish.
Nat would get over it. The farm was only recently prosperous, he
and Nellie had worked unspeakable hours, and she was undoubtedly
trying to impress it on Nat while young, that money represented
hours of human toil. There was time enough, he decided, for his
son to learn the other things. Nellie gave the two children their
meal in the kitchen and put them to bed. She and Ase sat
leisurely over their supper in the dining-room. The table was
laid as always with a fresh white linen cloth, a bowl of late
yellow roses was a central core of fragrance, the food was
savory. The intimacy, without Amelia, without Joe, without the
youngsters, was overwhelming. He laid his big gnarled hand over
Nellie's soft small one. For once, she did not bustle about,
clearing the table, washing the dishes, sweeping the kitchen
floor. He slipped away to lay a fire on their bedroom hearth. She
joined him almost instantly. He held her in what seemed a sweeter
closeness than ever before. Perhaps his deepest satisfaction was
that he found himself, for her, a great and true lover.</p>

<p>Nellie was asleep, her back turned to him afterward, as
always, when he remembered the red heifer. He left the bed
cautiously, not to awaken her, drew on coat and trousers, lit a
lantern and went to the barn. The heifer was indeed in trouble.
The calf was large and the heifer young. He was obliged to help,
to pull the wet thing into the world. The heifer went at once to
the devouring of the afterbirth. He was familiar with this
apparent monstrosity and it had always puzzled him. Yet somehow
it made all of life an endless cycle. There was first of all the
love, and he was certain the animals felt love as well as humans,
for no female of horse or dog or kine could be forced to accept a
male unwillingly. So the male element permeated the female, the
seed lay deep, as the seeds in the earth, there was the long
gestation, the release then, and the triumph of birth and of
harvest. Perhaps the bovine swallowing of the afterbirth was only
another step in the eternal nourishment, beginning the great
round once again.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the starlit autumn night. He longed to
know the relationship of the planets, the stars, the earth, one
to another. His book on astronomy was surely inadequate. There
must be another book somewhere that would tell him all he must
know of the revolving of these various strange masses. He read
the Bible constantly, for its profound study of men in trouble
and in joy, for the relation of human living to other living, for
the possibility of a man's reaching into the outer space for a
comfort the earth did not provide. He was still dissatisfied.</p>

<p>He went quietly to his bed. He lay dozing until the morning,
when it was time to visit the red heifer again, to give her, now
nursing her calf, an extra feeding, to take care of the rest of
the stock, for Joe had not appeared after his own night of
pleasure.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c13">XIII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The earth was thirsty for the snow. The winter wheat, in peril
of its life, shrank in need to be covered with the soft white
blanket. The snow began falling at dusk from a still and milky
sky. The flakes at first were large and loose. They slapped
against walls, against the boughs and trunks of trees, with the
wet impact of a child's kiss. They clung, slipped, melted, and
the earth for an hour or more drank them in like rain. With the
sudden dark, the air turned cold, the ground stiffened, the snow
gathered itself together in compact crystals and fell hard and
fast, as though the elements had had enough of softness. The
sharp particles hissed against the window-panes, then settled
down to a steady pelting.</p>

<p>Ase sensed the coming of the snow in mid-afternoon. He never
failed in his planning, but because he worked so thoroughly and
so slowly he was often somewhat behind. He had begun but had not
finished the laying of straw in the sheep-shed, the placing of
salt pans and the cleaning of feeding troughs. The hired man Joe
had moved on early to his winter factory work, probably to be
nearer to his sweetheart. Ase needed him now and knew he should
have insisted that Joe help complete these preparations before
leaving. He could not hold any man against his will. Hurry was
impossible for him, but he made a more concentrated effort, tense
against the tenseness of the sky, and finished the furnishing of
the shed for its wooly winter guests. He filled the watering
trough and set out for the high pasture. The dog Shep was
anxious, understanding that some routine was about to change. He
hesitated when his master did not go in the direction of the
cows, followed at his heels uncertainly, then knew in an instant
it was the sheep to be brought in, and bounded ahead up the brown
hill. The sheep too had felt the impending snow and had taken
refuge in the hemlock woods, dangerously near the bog. They were
not in sight and Ase was disturbed.</p>

<p>He called, "Sheep, sheep, sheep!"</p>

<p>The sweet tinkle of the wether's bell answered him. Shep heard
it, scented the flock, and was far ahead of Ase, to turn them
gently, to drive them from the dark woods, over the hill, down
the lane and into the shed, snug and welcoming. The bleats were
excited, but hungry after the late poor feeding, the sheep began
a contented nibbling on the bean-pods waiting for them. They ate
daintily, their velvet noses twitching. Ase heard the first
snowflakes plashing against the safe walls, and while there was
much work still to be done, stood watching and listening. It gave
a man almost more satisfaction to care for, feed, animals than
human beings. He wondered if there was at once something fine and
hateful in dispensing comfort to animals, so that a man felt
himself quite a fellow in being so generous and so kind, and
never mind the return the creatures gave him in one way or
another. He left the sheep-shed and with the dog drove in the
cows, the heifers, the calves. As usual, he had stood stock-still
too long, and night had come, and he was obliged to light a
lantern to finish the feeding and milking.</p>

<p>The snow was thick underfoot and on his shoulders. He put out
the barn lantern, hung it on its hook, and went bowed toward the
house with the two buckets of milk. The house was lighted. Nellie
had lamps lit in the sitting-room and the dining-room. He knew
that she hated the dark. He set down the milk pails to rest and
stared at the bright house. This was a man's great joy, to come
at nightfall after his day's work to a lighted house. The light
was orange and where it fell on the snow outside it was yellow,
and his beloved was waiting for him with food and warmth and
comfort.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "What on earth's taken you so long?"</p>

<p>"The sheep."</p>

<p>The snow scratched on the window panes like the feet of
squirrels on a shingled roof.</p>

<p>He said, "The snow came in time to save the winter wheat."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Nasty winter. Come on, supper's ready."</p>

<p>He ate abstractedly. After supper Nellie fussed with her house
plants, moving them away from the cold windows. She put a shawl
over her curls and made a dash out of doors to cut from under the
bay windows the last of her zinnias, frostbitten but still bright
and gay.</p>

<p>Ase was awake early the next morning. The snow was still
falling. He was certain that all the stock was comfortable, but
he wanted to feed them early, to speak to them, to assure them
that they would be cared for during the cold time ahead. He
dressed and went down quietly to the kitchen by the back stairs.
A rich, pungent smell came to him. He stood inside the kitchen,
astonished. Mink Fisher, the Indian friend of his childhood, lay
curled up under his blanket beside the still warm kitchen
range.</p>

<p>It was because of this dark man's teachings that Ase had moved
so silently that he had not awakened him, Mink, who was seldom
surprised by approach of bird or beast. How long was it now since
Mink had been here, usually discovered so at daybreak, by the
fire? Ten years or more, yes, more. Ase associated him with the
log-house, with the open hearth-fire whose embers flickered all
night long. Mink grunted in his sleep, as though he sensed the
bystander. His face was as Ase remembered it, thinner perhaps,
the nose more hawk-like, the cheek bones sharper. The straight
black hair was grizzled. There was none of the collapse of age,
only a finer mark of long facing of the elements, alone and
unafraid.</p>

<p>A wave of memory came over Ase, he was a boy again, who had
been a boy so brief a time. The Indian had been more of a father
than his own. He was the last of his tribe, the Fishers, in that
territory. No one knew where they had gone, or what had wiped
them out, nor why Mink did not find and follow other Indians, but
came and went, solitary, trapping and trading for a living. He
was famous for his mink pelts and so they called him "Mink." The
Linden place was the only one where he had stopped overnight, and
this was because of the silent, grave-eyed little boy who trotted
after him so trustingly, a boy who, everyone said, looked and
acted himself half Indian.</p>

<p>Here asleep lay the source of his knowledge, his voiceless
love, of wood and field and stream, of where the ginseng grew.
They had speared fish at night on the deep Linden lake, Pip Lake,
Mink called it. They had released from the traps, if not too
badly maimed, the female fox and mink and 'coon and otter, for
the game was getting scarcer, Mink said, and these were the
seedbeds for the precious fur. They had cut hemlock boughs for
couches, and roasted grouse and fish and partridge and vension
over ash and hickory coals, or buried corn in the husk, potatoes
in the skins, under hot stones to bake to tender sweetness.
Amelia's food had tasted particularly insipid after these things.
And it was Mink who had traced the stars for him, who had taken
him by the hand and led him barefoot across the Milky Way, at
home among the meteors and planets.</p>

<p>Ase turned back up the stairs and made a small noise, not to
arouse his friend too near at hand, too suddenly. Mink was on his
feet when he came down again. The Indian's eyes filled with
wonder and with light. He spoke a greeting in his own tongue. Ase
had known much of it once but now it was strange to him. He came
close and Mink laid his hands on his shoulders and looked long at
him. The Indian nodded.</p>

<p>"Man now," he said. "Boy gone."</p>

<p>Ase built up a fresh fire in the range. He put on a pot of
coffee to boil and brought out cold meats and breads and
pastries. They ate together without words.</p>

<p>Mink asked, "Father?"</p>

<p>Ase motioned to the ground.</p>

<p>"Mother?"</p>

<p>He gestured to the south, and made a sign of three moons
passed.</p>

<p>"Brother?"</p>

<p>Ase waved toward the west. Mink frowned. The west was the way
the spirits went. Ase understood, and struggled to bring back a
few of the ancient words to tell the story or his brother's
journeying. Using the pantomime of his boyhood, he began to walk
slowly the length of the room, bent and plodding, then lifted his
hand to shield his eyes against an imagined western brightness,
and turned his head from side to side in puzzling. Mink nodded.
The brother, then, the wild one, had gone west on foot, in search
of something. Mink had never made friends with this older one. He
eyed Ase keenly. He recognized the difference in the restlessness
of the two boys he had known. The other's was of feet and body,
of something of the white man's greed, no doubt it was gold for
which he hunted. This one like his son, this one's uneasiness was
of the mind and spirit. He caught sight of a child's garment hung
to dry behind the range. He touched it.</p>

<p>"Squaw?" he asked. "Papoose?"</p>

<p>Ase nodded, held up one finger, then two. Mink made motions,
indicating the curves of a woman's body, held up two fingers,
cradled his arms and held up one finger, asking, with his old
eyes crinkling, whether there were two squaws and one papoose.
Ase grinned and made reverse gestures, no, no, knowing Mink was
jesting, one wife and two young children. They laughed together
without sound, Mink shaking his lean belly.</p>

<p>The sun had risen without their noticing. It streamed through
the east window beside the ruddy range, the sky-fire stronger
than the man-fire. Nellie would be coming to the kitchen soon,
the chores were not done, but it did not matter. Ase wondered how
she would feel about Mink, for he recalled that his mother had
kept apart in his childhood when the Indian came. Nellie had got
along famously with his other friends, the gypsies. Yet she had
shared with them, and with him, at those times, their blitheness,
the singing and playing and the dancing. That was the world of
the heart, and she lived there with him always. He recognized
that the world where he met with Mink, and it did not seem now
that the Indian had been gone any time at all, was the secret
world she had never entered. On the instant, he dreaded their
coming together. Nellie had a devastating gift for mockery, and
he could see her imitating the gestures of his friend, and his
own in answer. Mink was watching him closely.</p>

<p>"I bring gift. I trade. I go," he said.</p>

<p>He turned to the large bundle beside his blanket. He unrolled
it swiftly. There were mink pelts and otter, but the bulk was a
wolfskin robe, mingled gray and tawny, warm and thick, faced with
deerskin, the skins sewed beautifully together with deer-hide
lacings. Mink pushed the robe toward Ase.</p>

<p>"You," he said.</p>

<p>This was the gift. It was too lavish. Ase shook his head. Mink
pushed it closer.</p>

<p>"You. For boy."</p>

<p>The gift was to the little boy Mink had taught and loved. Ase
could not refuse. He made a sign of gratitude and acceptance. The
trading began. Ase visualized a cape for Nellie of the mink. Its
warm chestnut color was only a few shades darker than her hair.
He did not see how he might use the otter, then he saw strips of
it, soft as kitten-fur, to trim the children's winter coats.
Somehow he was sure the new baby would be a girl and next year
Nellie could make a little cap and muff and mittens for their
daughter. The trading was business. He made a generous offer and
Mink hesitated. He wanted to make up for the gift of the robe and
he could only wonder what it was Mink wanted. In the old days, he
remembered, trade was in goods only, furs in exchange for knives,
for guns, for cooking pots, for dress goods. Mink indicated coins
between the hands. It was cash money, then, was called for. Ase
went to his tin box, brought it to the kitchen, opened it and
made a sweeping motion. Mink was to take from it what he thought
proper for the furs.</p>

<p>The Indian brushed aside the paper money and took out silver
dollars and half-dollars. He looked up questioningly. It was
still not nearly enough, Ase decided, and he put as much silver
again in Mink's hands. The Indian accepted it and rose with
dignity.</p>

<p>"Too much," he said. "But I need." He added bitterly, "White
man's life."</p>

<p>It was inconceivable to Ase that Mink should be so desperate.
The Indian had stood to him for all freedom, all natural
happiness. Now he needed these stupid bits of metal, dug from the
mother-earth, to subsist. It came to him with a shock how living
had changed, if not in his own lifetime, within what might be
called his memory, for the tales of a man's father and his
grandfather surely made up part of his own intimate recollection.
Mink's people had possessed these lands when the first Linden
arrived here a hundred years ago with his wagon load of household
goods, an axe by his left hand, a muzzle-loader by his right,
instruments both of destruction. He thought how few generations
it required to make up a century. A hundred years were no time at
all. True, the land now produced more bountifully, there was food
for many thousands of people in place of the dark virgin forest,
the axe had only made for a substitution. And the Lindens had
never turned their guns on the Indians. The first one had a gift
for healing, of men and animals, a talent as a blacksmith, and
Mink's people had come to him from the beginning in amity and
friendship. When the bloody arguments were settled, between
pioneers and Indians, the Indians were gone, all the Fisher tribe
was gone but old Mink, and the Lindens were here, and Ase was
increasing their tribe. And now Mink had no squaw, no tepee, no
campfire to return to, as orange-glowing and welcoming as
Nellie's lamplight. The honest exchange of goods was done for, he
must have pieces of the white man's metal to live by. Ase felt
himself a usurper, part of a breed of men who had brought a
plague upon the country.</p>

<p>He touched Mink's hand.</p>

<p>"You stay," he said.</p>

<p>Mink shook his head.</p>

<p>"Too late," he answered. "I go west."</p>

<p>His mouth twisted whimsically.</p>

<p>"You come."</p>

<p>Mink had not asked him to go away with him when he was a boy.
He knew he would have gone then. For a moment a longing swept him
to go with Mink into the sun, to sleep on hemlock boughs under
the stars forever.</p>

<p>"Too late," he echoed.</p>

<p>He made a parcel of meat and bread for Mink to carry with him.
He touched the wolfskin robe in thanks. There had not been wolves
here for many years.</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked, and Mink pointed again to the west, and
indicated that the robe had been traded from man to man from the
far plains until it ended here, a gift for a vanished little
boy.</p>

<p>Well, and if this bulky thing had come so far, and Mink was
going back over the trail, a message might come and go as
well.</p>

<p>"My brother," he said, and described Benjamin as best he
could, now he was a grown man, too, and asked of Mink that he
have the western Indians inquire of his going-by, and asked that
word be sent back of Benjamin's health, even of his existence,
some token from his own hand, or, best of all, because of the
grieving mother, some white man's words written down on a piece
of paper.</p>

<p>He thought that Mink might trace Ben where others had failed.
It was part of a pattern. Mink's return was scarcely surprising,
a natural thing. It seemed to him that friends were part of the
indestructible tapestry of one's life, that no matter if a thread
disappeared there, it would eventually reappear here, or in some
other place in the design, as long as it was a thread that
mattered.</p>

<p>He said, "You come again?"</p>

<p>Mink shook his head. He touched his forehead and that of Ase,
he touched his breast and that of the other. They would be always
together in those inviolable secret places, and if they could not
again speak face to face, it would not too much matter. Ase
watched his friend as far as the western rise of land. Mink would
go cross-country, never on the traveled roads, he would go up
hill and down dale until he reached his destination and his
death. Ase watched after him as he had watched after Benjamin. He
saw the old Indian wrap his blanket more tightly around him and
stride away with a long loping, his head bowed a little under the
falling snow.</p>

<p>Ase cleaned up the kitchen. He looked for a place to hide the
wolfskin robe and the mink and otter pelts, for now he could
surprise Nellie at Christmas after all. He concealed them at last
on the upper floor of the carriage shed beside the house, under
the pile of winter popcorn, not yet strung up under the rafters.
When he returned to the kitchen, Nellie was there. She had at
once discovered the amount of food missing.</p>

<p>She said, "You must not have had enough supper last night. You
can hold more than any man I know. You didn't need to wash your
dishes."</p>

<p>He hesitated. It would be nothing to tell her of the visit,
she would ask few questions, would never grumble about the food,
for she was generous with tramps. Perhaps that was it, his
friend, his almost-father, would seem to her a tramp. He was
obliged to let Mink get safely away from her. She stood still and
wrinkled her sensitive nose.</p>

<p>"Now what on earth. I smell something rank as a bear."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Probably some wild creature's just passed by," he said. "Some
wild friendly thing."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c14">XIV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The sky at noon was metallic. The brass sun hurt the eyes but
there was no heat in it. The icicles hanging from pump and eaves
held their own against it. The thick crust of the snow was smooth
and nacreous, blue-shadowed like the inside of an oyster shell.
Pip Lake was already frozen three feet deep. The day was as cold
a one as Ase could remember. He turned the big two-seated sleigh
from the barn into the drive at the side of the house. Nellie and
the children were almost certain to be ready, but since the
horses were still warm from the snug stalls, he put their
blankets over them. Even a five-minute wait might chill them. He
heard Nat howling and decided he must be getting a last-second
face washing. Out of the sun, the cold bit like ivory fangs. He
went upstairs in the carriage house and took out the wolfskin
robe from under the piled popcorn. It would spoil Nellie's
surprise, but after all, it was only two days before Christmas,
and she would never need the warmth more acutely. If his mother's
train was late, it would be night before they returned from
Peytonville.</p>

<p>The horses stamped against the cold, their breath congealed,
the harness bells jangled. Nellie came out of the house
alone.</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "You expected to take the boys. They'd
only get tired and fretful. Hulda'll put them to bed early."</p>

<p>He said, "Nat's old enough."</p>

<p>"He'll never know the difference."</p>

<p>"I heard him--"</p>

<p>"Oh, he yells about everything. He doesn't like Hulda. Tell
you, Ase, we don't know how we'll find your mother's mind. Better
to meet her alone."</p>

<p>He nodded. This was true. He helped her into the sleigh and
lifted the robe. He laid it across her lap.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," he said.</p>

<p>"You're a little early, I must say."</p>

<p>She stroked it and examined curiously the deerskin lining, the
intricate stitching.</p>

<p>"Nice. Where'd you get it? Where's it been?"</p>

<p>He stowed the blankets in the back of the sleigh and turned
the horses down the road toward the town. Nellie sniffed at the
robe.</p>

<p>She said, "It's got something to do with that smell in the
kitchen not long ago."</p>

<p>It seemed discreet enough now to tell the truth. He explained
briefly.</p>

<p>She said, "I don't think I'd like Indians. They stink."</p>

<p>Yes, he thought, they stank, and it was the rich stink of
earth, of leaves, of burning wood, of the musky cleanness of
animals. She snuggled down under the robe. She was wearing the
little red-riding-hood cape and bonnet, with her curls escaping
around her face. She looked as young as on the afternoon when she
had burst in on him with her dog and her pie and her jest about
the pie, and her making the way clear for them after Benjamin had
gone away. He put an arm around her and she nestled against him.
He had wanted to thank her for insisting that he write his mother
to come home for Christmas.</p>

<p>She had been so matter-of-fact about it, saying, "Tell your Ma
Nat would like his Grandma to see his Christmas tree."</p>

<p>Nat had expressed no such desire, and it seemed to him even
more delicate of Nellie to phrase it so.</p>

<p>She had added, "Tell her we're having a roast goose and I want
to know about the stuffing."</p>

<p>He was dimly aware of the female flattery involved.</p>

<p>The sleigh passed the Linden one-room schoolhouse, turned into
the main road to Peytonville, passed an increasing number of
houses, and then they were in the village itself. The little town
was decked out at its best. From side to side of the main street
hung garlands of ground pine dressed with red paper bells. Folk
from miles around had their horses hitched there, all the stores
were bright with Christmas wares. Ase found a hitching post,
blanketed the horses, and helped Nellie down from the sleigh, to
do their most important shopping at Mr. Peyton's General
Store.</p>

<p>It was the first time in several months they had been to town
together. There was a stir in the store, Will Peyton came from
behind a counter to pump their hands. Hank Golightly and Sam
Banks rose from their checker game by the stove to greet the
young couple. Ase felt warmed by the friendliness. Nellie
recognized shrewdly the respect given a rising citizen of
property. She could remember when no one would have noticed the
entrance of the Linden boy, the quiet one. Ben, of course, had
always attracted attention, as had she. She preened herself a
little and took advantage of Peyton to bargain sharply.</p>

<p>The Linden farm produced most staples except for such items as
tea, coffee, lemons, refined sugar, store cheese and crackers.
Nellie was well-stocked on these, her Christmas baking was
already done, but for fresh layer cakes to be baked tomorrow. She
set herself at the choosing of holiday luxuries. She bought gifts
of dress goods for the women of her own family, mufflers for the
men, and for Amelia, decided on a pair of fine black kid gloves
and a bottle of toilet water. It came to Ase that she had no
conception of the value of the wolf- and deer-skin robe, had
accepted it casually as scarcely a gift, only a warm useful
covering that smelled like Indians. The choice mink and otter
pelts would seem equally trivial to her. He made an excuse and
went down the street toward Miss Minnie's millinery and notion
shop. He was stopped along the way by village acquaintances and
by farm neighbors met ordinarily only at harvesting or at
meetings of the Grange. He was glad to turn into the warmth of
Miss Minnie's shop.</p>

<p>The pot-bellied stove was rosy-red, the windowpanes were
steamy, the dry female scent of ribbons and laces, of artificial
flowers and feathers, met him. Miss Minnie looked over her
steel-rimmed spectacles and wiped her perpetually dripping nose
on the back of her hand, which she then offered him. On a second
thought, she worked her handkerchief from her apron pocket and
blew her nose clamorously. Ase looked around him helplessly.</p>

<p>She said, "You expecting to meet your wife here, Mr.
Linden?"</p>

<p>"No. I want a present for her."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you the clever one. Not many husbands'd think of
coming to me for Christmas for their wives. And nothing, I say,
tickles a lady like a new hat or bonnet or what we call in the
trade a frou-frou. Now it's funny, two-three the drummers stops
at the Peyton House, they come to me to buy, my, the laces and
frills, but don't tell me it's for wives. I may be an old maid,
lived in Peytonville all my life, oh, trips to the city, you
know, to buy, but I say, I know human nature. A body'd almost
think you wasn't married to Nellie. Now that's a thought, folks
say you're daft about her yet, and two young ones and another
started, they say, and you can't bear her out of your sight.
Let's see now, that's nonsense, I remember when you was married,
and Preacher told it he never did see a groom look so solemn,
what am I talking about, of course you're married, but it's a
sweet sad thought, the other. And her so crazy about your brother
once."</p>

<p>She caught her breath and snuffled. Ase had a desperate
impulse to walk out of the shop. Then he was suddenly amused. The
sweet sad thought would tickle Nellie as much as a new hat. He
wondered if he could manage to tell it so that she could see Miss
Minnie as he saw her now, manless, ferret-like and sniffly,
realized it was beyond him.</p>

<p>Miss Minnie said, "Now maybe, being for a wife, you'd like one
of my own hand painted cake plates. I wouldn't boast, but I'm
famous for my hand painted roses."</p>

<p>He said hastily, "No, no thank you. Something personal."</p>

<p>His eyes lit on something blue, the color of Nellie's eyes. He
pointed, but the milliner was holding out to him a monstrous
thing, presumably a hat, wide-brimmed and a mass of cotton-cloth
pansies.</p>

<p>"Now Mr. Linden, in the trade we call this a confection."</p>

<p>He wanted to say, "Save it for the drummers," but he could not
offend her, and he pointed again to the blue thing that he now
recognized as a sort of bonnet. It was made of satin, smooth as
Nellie's skin. It seemed to be, what was it, quilted, it had a
pert pink rose at one side, and wide blue satin ribbons that he
could picture tied in a bow under Nellie's firm little chin.</p>

<p>He asked, "Can you put that in a fancy box?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, Mr. Linden, why yes, you have such good taste, of
course it's expensive, but I see you don't mind that."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Twelve dollars?"</p>

<p>He took out his leather wallet and counted out the bills. The
price shocked him, but he could not wait to see Nellie's face
adorably surrounded by this bit of blue.</p>

<p>Miss Minnie said, "Now something else, perhaps? A little
tippet? Some lace for the throat? Another little, let's say,
extravagance?"</p>

<p>He thought of his mother, and bought lace for her, and a fine
shawl. He slipped his purchases in the back seat of the sleigh
and met Nellie at the Penny Store. They bought there toys for Nat
and Arent and Nellie's nieces and nephews, and gum drops,
peppermint and licorice sticks, barley sugar candy, and bright
ornaments for the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>The afternoon had turned dark and even colder. Amelia's train
was not due until six o'clock. Ase had saved another surprise for
Nellie, supper at the Peyton House. He began to worry about the
horses. He took Nellie to the hotel, left her in the red-carpeted
lobby, and returned to drive his team to the livery stable,
ordering oats and a warm mash. It had proved an expensive day,
but he was satisfied. When he returned to the hotel, he found
Nellie in conversation with what must be one of Miss Minnie's
feather-buying drummers. He invited the man to join them for
supper, but the stranger refused.</p>

<p>The supper was a disappointment, compared with Nellie's
cooking, but there were delicacies on the menu, such as oysters.
Nellie was animated and he felt a surge of pride, seeing that the
other diners, men for the most part, watched her. The Peyton
House clock showed ten minutes to six and he and Nellie walked
the short distance to the railroad station to meet Amelia's
train. It was only a little late. Ase rejoiced when Nellie ran to
embrace his mother as she stepped down. He seemed to remember
that since the planting of the apple orchard Nellie had changed
her attitude, had given Amelia every attention. Perhaps after all
the two women would become friends. He brought the sleigh, tucked
them into the front seat beside him, drew the robe over them and
set out for home. The sleigh bells rang sweetly.</p>

<p>Amelia was cheerful as Ase had never known her.</p>

<p>She said, "I was really in despair not to find my Benjamin. I
advertised for information of him, you know, in all the Indiana
papers. But I got the best of news. A young lady answered me from
near Indianapolis and I went to see her. Benjamin had left for
the West again, a month before. A wonderful opportunity was
waiting for him, some sort of mining partnership. She was hoping
that I knew the exact location, as he had forgotten to give her
the address."</p>

<p>She coughed delicately.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are engaged. I must say, I was charmed with her.
Very pretty, and the only child of an invalid and wealthy
widower. Ben's prospects are bright indeed. He will return for
her in the spring. She was delighted with my suggestion that they
come here at once. She was certain he would agree. He had spoken
of me tenderly, most tenderly. He has been waiting to write me,
to come to me, as I knew, until he could come in happiness and
prosperity."</p>

<p>She touched Nellie's mittened hand.</p>

<p>"I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, my dear. It was
to be expected."</p>

<p>Nellie said dryly, "The whole thing's exactly what I'd
expect."</p>

<p>"Good. You have only yourself to blame for losing him."</p>

<p>Ase felt Nellie stiffen beside him. She started to speak and
did not. She nudged him in the ribs and gave her little
chuckle.</p>

<p>She said demurely, "Ase and I are very pleased for Ben."</p>

<p>The understanding came clearly to him from her that Ben had
only moved on into the void from another of his familiar
conquests. Well then, his mother would be contented until the
spring, and into the summer, drawing sustenance from this
chimaera.</p>

<p>He decided not to mention the possibility of getting a message
to Ben through Mink, it was too remote. He would wait until she
began to brood again and needed some fresh hope to cling to. She
chattered of details of her visit. She had an extra box with her,
gifts, she said, for the children, and how was her little
Nat?</p>

<p>Nellie said, "There'll be another this summer, Mother Linden.
Time for a girl. We thought she'd be little Amelia."</p>

<p>They had not discussed a name, but Ase was touched.</p>

<p>His mother said, "That might be a handicap, if her life proves
as sad as mine," yet she seemed gratified.</p>

<p>The sky over their shoulders had a ruddy afterglow. A wind had
risen, and for a hundred yards before they took the turn by the
schoolhouse, Ase thought the sound he heard was its howling
through the naked tree tops. Only the brilliance of the snow made
it possible to see the figure at the foot of the schoolhouse
steps. He halted the team. He knew at once this was Tim McCarthy,
in trouble again, and the howling had come from his little white
dog, invisible against the greater whiteness. Tim had evidently
used the last of his strength to try to enter the school-house.
The dog barked now shrilly and ran in excited circles. Ase lifted
the huddled frail body in his arms. Tim was unconscious,
breathing in deep rasps. Ase laid him on the straw of the floor
of the back seat and tucked the horse blankets around him. Tim
had on the lightest of clothing. It was impossible to know how
long he had lain there in the bitter cold. Ase motioned to the
dog to jump in. The animal was shivering and pressed close
against his master.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Tim always manages to fall drunk where you'll
find him."</p>

<p>Nellie said wryly, "It's a habit he can't get out of, along
with the liquor."</p>

<p>The two disparate women at least had this consolidarity.
Nellie had lost her tolerance of Tim, he could not tell how or
when.</p>

<p>Ase was stepping into the sleigh when he recollected. It was
seldom that Tim went out celebrating without his fiddle. Ase went
back and searched near the steps and found it. He laid it on the
back seat and set off. Hulda's lamp in her bedroom was the only
light in the house. He must remind her, no, Nellie would be sure
to, that the Lindens did not spare the oil, and always wanted
lamps lit to welcome them. He hoped she had kept the fires going.
Hulda was a good girl, she had helped Nellie off and on since the
birth of Nat. He drew up at the side of the house.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Not a light. Probably not a fire in the house.
I'll get things going, Ase, and you can bring in the stuff after
you take Tim home."</p>

<p>Nellie knew as well as he that Tim's employers were away for
the holidays and had left behind a young hired boy to take care
of the stock, against the certain eventuality of Tim's Christmas
drunk. She had probably forgotten.</p>

<p>He said, "I must bring him in."</p>

<p>He went ahead to light the kitchen lamp. He heard the women
murmuring together.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now Mother Linden agrees with me, Ase, you've
got to take that nasty old man right on to his own home."</p>

<p>They stood united against him, against his friend.</p>

<p>He said, "He doesn't have a home."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "The people he works for are responsible for him.
Not you."</p>

<p>Ase said, "But he's sick."</p>

<p>Nellie snapped, "You bet he's sick. He'll be puking all over
any minute."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he could hear Tim's agonized breathing
through the very walls. How long had Tim lain helpless in the
snow?</p>

<p>He said, "He's getting old. I'll take care of him, he won't be
any trouble."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Spoil Christmas for your old drunk, then. I
won't go near him. Mother Linden, you sleep here tonight. I don't
see why you don't move into your old downstairs bedroom here, to
stay. I hate thinking of you alone in the log-house."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "My dear, how thoughtful of you. I shall."</p>

<p>He lifted Tim from the sleigh and went with his burden into
the house. He carried his friend upstairs to a bedroom over the
kitchen which always kept a certain amount of warmth. He pulled
off Tim's heavy brogan shoes but left on his clothing for the
moment and piled quilts and a goose-down comforter over him.
Tim's breathing was stertorous.</p>

<p>Ase drove the sleigh to the barn, unhitched the horses and
made them comfortable. He still had the milking to do, the
feeding of the stock, the watering. The animals greeted him in
their various tongues and he responded with a touch here, a word
there. When he returned to the house he saw that his wife and his
mother had had a cozy bite of food and tea together. Both had
retired to their bedrooms.</p>

<p>The fire in the range had died to ashes. He built it up, made
scalding tea, took it by the back stairs to Tim's room, lit a
lamp, and forced two cups down him. Tim muttered. Ase undressed
him, stole another comforter from the nearby bedroom and spread
it over his friend, waited until Tim broke into a promising
sweat. He dried the old man with his own shirt, tucked the covers
close around his neck, and went downstairs again. He had
forgotten Tim's dog. He went out into the icy night and called.
The little dog was crouched by the woodshed door. Ase brought him
in, fed him generously, then led him up the back stairs. With a
moan of joy, the dog leaped to Tim's bed. Ase drew back the top
coverlet to let him snuggle inside.</p>

<p>Ase remembered that he had not unloaded the sleigh. But none
of the Christmas contents would be harmed by the night's cold.
Only Tim was in danger. He went to his friend three times during
the night, to cover him again against his feverish tossing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The kitchen on Christmas Eve morning was apparently chaos. Ase
stood baffled in the doorway, with no place to set down the milk
buckets. His hands were numb with cold, his nose felt
frostbitten. The center work-table seemed to have had a vast
cornucopia spilled at random across it. The big gray goose lay
ready for plucking, apples, onions, Hubbard squash, raisins were
piled around it, a pan of crumbled bread would become stuffing, a
bowl of cracked hickory-nuts needed to have the meats extracted,
cranberries would make a ruby sauce, ears of pop-corn wanted
hulling, a basket of eggs awaited a broken sacrifice. The kitchen
sink was piled with used bowls, the table between sink and stove
was covered with buttered cake tins, Nellie was spooning batter
into a row of them with machine precision. The coffee-pot
simmered at the back of the range, buckwheat batter gave out its
sharp yeasty winter smell, a skillet of sausages was frying
slowly.</p>

<p>Amelia looked in from the dining-room door.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd keep out of the way until you're ready for me.
You might just bring me a little tray of breakfast to my room. I
have my fire going."</p>

<p>The back-stair door opened and Nat reached for the last steps
precariously, little Arent clutched dangling from his front, like
a huge puppy. Nellie turned in time to thump down her bowl and
gather up the younger child as Nat stumbled. She dropped Arent in
his high-chair, opened the oven door and slid in six layer tins
of cake batter, pulled the soapstone griddle to the front of the
range, pushed more wood in the fire-box, led Nat to the
wash-stand and mopped and dried his face and hands.</p>

<p>"Milk pans in the woodshed, Ase," she said. "Strainer on the
shelf. Strain for me, then wash up for breakfast. Go make
yourself comfortable, Mother Linden, have you a nice tray in a
jiffy. Nat, find Arent something to play with. Here, give him his
spoon to bang."</p>

<p>She dipped buckwheat batter onto the griddle, turned the
sausages, stirred the oatmeal, Arent beat his silver spoon on his
wooden tray, Nat dragged the cat from under the stove by its
tail, was scratched for his pains and howled. Nellie was the
whirlwind and she was also its calm and cheerful center. When Ase
came from the wash-stand, she had breakfast on the dining table
and had begun to help Arent eat his oatmeal. She handed him the
spoon and he finished feeding the child. Nat was helping himself
busily to one cookie after another, making a ring around his
porridge plate. Nellie whisked past to the company bedroom with a
steaming tray for Amelia. She took a look at her cakes in the
oven, sat down at the table, brushed the curls away from her
moist forehead, poured a cup of coffee, and, it seemed to Ase,
breathed for the first time. She was plainly as happy as a cat in
a wool-skein.</p>

<p>He said, "This going to keep up all day?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"There'll be nothing much to do tomorrow but roast the goose
and the turkey, cook the vegetables. You can hull the popcorn or
pick out nut meats this morning if I don't find time."</p>

<p>"I can pluck the goose for you."</p>

<p>"No thanks. I want to keep the down separate. You'd get
absent-minded and have it half full of feathers. I'll keep you
busy, don't fret."</p>

<p>He watched his chance to mix a bowl of oatmeal with cream and
sugar, to pour a cup of coffee and to slip up the back stairs to
Tim. He hesitated at the door of the bedroom, set down the
dishes, and went to his cupboard for the bottle of medicinal
whiskey. Tim was awake. The old man had escaped pneumonia, but
his exposure had settled into a deep bronchial cough, and he was
wretched in general.</p>

<p>He said weakly, "Ase, the trouble I am to you."</p>

<p>Ase fed him several spoonfuls of whiskey. They grinned at each
other, for it was not his usual way of taking it. He managed the
coffee and half the oatmeal. He closed his eyes. Ase pulled the
window shades against the bright morning light, tucked in the
bedcovers and tiptoed away. Sleep and warmth would take over the
healing. He was more relieved than he could have believed. The
old man had evidently not lain too long in the cold, or he was
tough as a hickory knot, or both.</p>

<p>Amelia decided to be company, at least for the time being. She
spent the day arranging her personal belongings in the pleasant
downstairs front bedroom. Nellie took her two of her prettiest
house plants for decoration. Ase worked steadily at whatever
small jobs Nellie assigned him. His great slow hands hulled the
popcorn and picked out nut meats. Nellie forgot him, until she
noticed the bowl of shelled nuts overflowing, when she stopped
him. Nat sat on a stool and worked the wooden churn dasher
faithfully up and down until the butter came. The family had
glasses of fresh buttermilk and doughnuts in midmorning. Nat
built a set of barns in a corner with the corn cobs. Arent fell
asleep in his high chair. Cakes came and went from the oven, were
turned out to cool, were filled and frosted and sugared. Pound
cakes had been made a few days ago, fruit cakes weeks before.
Mince pies filled a long shelf in the stone cellar. In the
afternoon, Nellie made pies of pumpkin and squash, brown and
fragrant with spice, set bread dough to rise, and in a sudden
panic that there might not be enough to eat on Christmas day,
made up fresh batches of molasses and sugar cookies and a
dishpanful of doughnuts. Amelia proved vague about the stuffing
for the goose, and Nellie went quietly ahead with her usual
recipe. Ase carried the heavy goose and turkey down cellar,
dressed and trussed and ready in their roasting pans for
tomorrow's oven.</p>

<p>Supper was early and light, so far as Nellie could possibly
set a simple table. Amelia joined them. Nat whined for some of
the fresh cocoanut cake. Nellie had foreseen the danger and
produced a tiny one for his own, baked in a small tin lid, and
frosted as thickly as the big company one. He was delighted and
made it last a long time. When Nellie made griddle cakes she
always made special ones for him, the size of a half dollar. Ase
looked over the table uneasily, to choose something helpful for
Tim.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "You don't have to sneak the old bother's food to
him. I'll fix something, if you think he's slept off his
drunk."</p>

<p>"He caught cold," Ase said.</p>

<p>"Anybody else would have caught his death."</p>

<p>"He has a bad cough, Nellie."</p>

<p>She sighed and looked tired for the first time.</p>

<p>"All right. I'll make him a hot onion poultice when we go to
bed. Anything to get him on out of here in a hurry."</p>

<p>She sent him upstairs with an invalid's supper of poached eggs
and hot milk and buttered toast. The old man's eyes filled.</p>

<p>"The dear Nellie, now," he said, "taking thought for an old
bastard doesn't deserve it. I'll be making it up to her
somehow."</p>

<p>He seemed to relish the delicate food. He sat up straight.</p>

<p>"Mother of God, me fiddle!"</p>

<p>"It's safe in the woodshed."</p>

<p>"Praise be. No matter how the drink takes me, I do usually
keep a good grip of it." He eyed Ase sharply. "This time I did
not, eh? Praise to you, then, Asahel Linden my friend."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I wanted some Christmas music tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow? Eh, now. Me sick on your hands for the Lord's
birthday, and no gifts in mine."</p>

<p>Ase ached to comfort him, to assure him that his presence was
gift enough, his very life a precious thing. He hoped that in the
hubbub of a big family Christmas day, Nellie and Amelia would
greet the old fellow at least not too unkindly.</p>

<p>He said, "Nellie'll make you a poultice tonight," and returned
downstairs.</p>

<p>Arent had been put to bed, but Nat was allowed to stay up to
watch the popping of corn, its stringing, and the stringing of
the reddest cranberries, into long festoons. Ase had a small
spruce concealed in the woodshed for a Christmas tree. Amelia
helped with the popcorn as though she made the major contribution
to the holiday preparations, but she was cheerful and
talkative.</p>

<p>She took Nat on her lap and said, "Now Grandmother will tell
you all about Santa Claus."</p>

<p>Her telling of the fable was drab and unconvincing. Nat
squirmed. He was most interested in the idea that St. Nick meant
presents for him. By what mystic, reindeer-driven means they
arrived was not important.</p>

<p>"So tonight," Amelia finished, "while you're asleep, Santa
will bring things for a good boy, and tomorrow you can have them,
and it's called 'Christmas,' and we'll have roast goose and great
big cakes and plum pudding."</p>

<p>She retired to her room and Nellie put the boy to bed. Ase
brought the little spruce and set it up in a corner of the
living-room. He handed Nellie the strings of popcorn and
cranberries, the bright ornaments from the Penny Store. She
dusted tinsel over the boughs. The little tree was gay and
sparkling. They arranged the gifts under it. Nellie made a hot
onion poultice for McCarthy's chest, turned it over to Ase to
apply, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Tim protested the ungodly stink of the poultice, but resigned
himself.</p>

<p>"'Tis me punishment," he said.</p>

<p>Ase brought the dog in to him for the night. He went down
alone to the kitchen, still redolent, still warm. He fetched his
Bible and by the light of the kitchen lamp, turned the pages
until he found what he was seeking. "The Lord's birthday," Tim
had said.</p>

<p>"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,
which is Christ the Lord."</p>

<p>He had been troubled as his mother told Nat of Santa Claus. He
had wanted then to tell his first born son this older and more
stirring story. Presents, why, they were things to give, not to
receive, the Wise Men had brought gifts, not waited avidly for
them. He was disturbed over Nat's young greediness, and Amelia,
yes, Nellie too, seemed to encourage him in this.</p>

<p>He turned a page back and read, "And there were in the same
country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their
flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and
the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore
afraid."</p>

<p>As always, the majestic language moved him; the talk of
shepherds, abiding in the field. It seemed to him that a man
might meet God, if ever, in the fields, for so much of creation
was there. McCarthy was a religious man, for all his sins, and an
articulate. He would ask Tim tomorrow to tell Nat of
Christmas.</p>

<p>He closed the book and put it away. A log of charred wood
collapsed and crashed against the quiet of the house. The clock
on the mantel ticked noisily. It was nearly twelve o'clock.
Nellie's family would be arriving early the next day and there
would be confusion. Although it was so late, he decided it would
be best to give the sick ewe her drenching tonight. One of the
Wilson men would be glad to give him a hand tomorrow, yet a
stranger would disturb all the sheep, and the ewe would be more
difficult to handle. He mixed the draught, lit a lantern, put on
his greatcoat, tied a muffler over his fur cap and went out into
the still night to the sheep-shed.</p>

<p>The sheep looked up in curiosity from their beds in the deep
oat straw. Their smell was rankly sweet in the sheltered close.
The sick ewe was drowsing. Ase opened her mouth gently and had
the draught down her throat before she could become alarmed. The
sheep took the lantern light for morning and began nibbling at
their straw. The ram looked benevolently over his flock, then
nibbled, too. Passing the stable, Ase stepped inside and held his
light high, more by way of greeting than for anxiety, for all the
other stock was in good health. The red heifer who had had
trouble with her first calf rose from her knees in her stall,
recognized him, lowed softly and started at once to chew her cud.
The cows, the horses, breathed heavily. One of the barn cats
peered from a manger, its eyes wild and red in the lantern light.
It ducked away and there was the squeaking of a caught mouse. Ase
left the creatures to their sleep.</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen so many twinkling stars. They
were not moving, he thought, but were bound to cosmic stakes,
from which they struggled to be free. The earth must look so to a
night-watcher on another planet, tugging at its tethers. He
wondered what force held each one in its appointed place. He had
read in the astronomy book that the earth revolved around the
sun, the moon around the earth, and that these three were part of
a larger stellar system. And how far did that system extend, and
how many other such systems were there, and was there any end to
them and any end to man? He had read in fascination in Ben's
Academy books of what was called the force of gravity, which
pinned men down to earth so that they did not fly off into space,
kept each one dancing up and down on one spot. If a larger eye,
God, for instance, watched them, men too might appear to be
struggling against invisible deep-set stakes.</p>

<p>And was God there among the stars, Himself the gravity,
Himself the great inter-revolving, or was He, as the preachers
said, only an omnipotent human, white-bearded, stern and harsh as
Asahel's own father, with an odd capacity for watching critically
every man's thoughts and actions, disapproving particularly of
fornication and of the theft of property? The still night was so
bright that Ase blew out his lantern. He stared upward. Whatever
the truth, he found himself drawn to those outer spaces. It
seemed to him that he must perish if he could not make some sort
of communication, back and forth, just as he was desolate because
he had lost touch with his brother. He found himself denying this
so-called force of gravity. It could not be what tied men to
earth. It was a heavy weight, an unendurable pressure from the
outer-land, and if a man could once break through it, soar high
like a bird, he would be free, would meet, would join, something
greater than he, and be complete at last.</p>

<p>Walking slowly to the house, he scented the strong odor of a
fox.</p>

<p>"Help yourself to the mice," he thought, "leave the chickens
alone."</p>

<p>A sound of distant chimes came sweetly to him. The church
bells of Peytonville were ringing. It was midnight of Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c16">XVI</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Christmas day was clear and sparkling. The sun gathered its
strength. The icicles were struck to the heart, wept long crystal
tears, lost their grip on their week-long home under the eaves,
fell tinkling and broken to the ground. Nellie had slipped early
and quiet from bed. Ase, over sleeping, was late with his chores.
It was the first time the morning sun had met him returning with
the milk buckets. He had given all the stock an extra measure of
grain, scattered more handfuls than usual of barley and wheat and
corn on the snow for the winter birds. The sick ewe was better.
He found Nellie deep in the paring of vegetables and the good
smell of breakfast waiting. He strained the milk, took the wide
shallow pans to the cellar shelves, and on his way up the back
stairs to Tim McCarthy, met the old man coming down. Tim was
shaky and unshaven.</p>

<p>"The merriest of Christmases to you, my friend," he said. "Now
I've found me health, isn't it best I be taking my own road?"</p>

<p>The wistfulness was naked under his bravado. As he spoke, he
staggered and clutched at the wooden railing beside the steep
narrow stairs. Ase steadied him. His heart ached for the lonely
man.</p>

<p>"You're family, Tim," he said. "We want you here."</p>

<p>"Ah then, bless you. I'll eat at table, not to be a burden to
the darling Nellie. And I'll fiddle for you, come evening, if
it's the last fiddling I do this side of Heaven."</p>

<p>The white dog came behind him, yawning, asked to be let out,
to make an admirably large puddle in the snow. Nellie did not
look up. Ase cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Tim's better," he said.</p>

<p>"Then maybe he can give me a hand," she said tartly. "There's
still a lot to do, with Hulda gone for the holidays."</p>

<p>Tim said, "I'm good as any woman in the kitchen, Nellie
dear."</p>

<p>She dropped an onion in its pot of water and stood up.</p>

<p>"Breakfast's ready. Ase, get the boys out of your mother's
room and wash their faces. Tell her to come sit down. I can't
bother with a tray."</p>

<p>It seemed to Ase that she had a delayed irritation, quite
understandable, from her hard work the day before. He was
unwilling to admit that she could be annoyed over Tim's spending
Christmas with them. Breakfast was not out of the ordinary, but
the quantity was a menace to the coming Christmas dinner. Tim
insisted on washing the breakfast dishes. Amelia retired to her
room. The midmorning sun blazed on the snow and ice. Ase wrapped
Nat warmly over his yells to have his Christmas gifts at once,
and took him out of doors, along with a lump of suet to hang from
a poplar tree for the birds. Nat found the fallen icicles and ate
the fragments like candy.</p>

<p>The sleigh bells of the Wilson family came ringing down the
road. Ase and Nat met them, the women went into the house, the
men put away the horses and lingered in the barns to talk of farm
affairs. The sun was high. Amelia came from her room dressed in
her best. She was condescending to Nellie's people. Nellie
changed her percale dress for a silk one and replaced the gingham
apron with one of frilled organdy. The families gathered in the
living room where the Wilsons had added their gifts to the others
under the Christmas tree. Ase looked at his mother. She took
charge.</p>

<p>"Now when I give the word, everyone looks for his own
presents. Ready? Go."</p>

<p>The adults and the Wilson children went modestly to the piles
of packages to search for their own names. Ase was pained to see
Nat plunge wildly, scrambling under the tree, and to hear him
howl as he could not identify what was to be his alone. Tim
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>He called out, "Nat, me boy, wait a bit. Uncle Tim'll be
helping you."</p>

<p>He put an arm around the child, bent with him under the tree,
and brought out Nat's gifts.</p>

<p>"Look now," he said soothingly, "here's all of this, come,
we'll open them. And who's loved the little Nat so much to have
all this for him?"</p>

<p>The child grabbed avidly at his presents, was shown by Tim how
to spin the beautiful shining top. Tim drew from his pocket a
silver dollar and handed it to the boy. Nat dropped the top.</p>

<p>"Money!" he screamed.</p>

<p>He ran to his mother.</p>

<p>"Look, Ma! Is this enough to buy me a horse and buggy?"</p>

<p>The Wilson clan laughed.</p>

<p>Nellie winked and said, "With a pair of bays."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Tell the child the truth. Nathaniel dear, you'd
need a pile of silver dollars so-o-o high to buy a horse and
buggy. You can save this one, and when you grow up, you must find
a way to get lots more of them, and then you can buy anything you
want."</p>

<p>He scowled.</p>

<p>"What way?"</p>

<p>"Why, almost any way. Except stealing, of course. Lawyers and
bankers make money."</p>

<p>Bert Wilson offered, "Buy land cheap and sell it high's a
right good way."</p>

<p>Harry Wilson said, "Any business a man can build up for
himself. Long as it's his own."</p>

<p>Nellie's father said, "Anything but farming," and the
prosperous Wilsons laughed again. Amelia listened with approval.
Her black eyes were bright. Nat began to wail. He held out the
dollar with distaste.</p>

<p>"It isn't enough. It won't buy anything."</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "Uncle Tim's sorry, boy. 'Twas all I had."</p>

<p>His shining gift had become a shabby thing, to be apologized
for. Ase wanted to explain that it stood for hours of a man's
hard labor, for an old man's life running fast through the hour
glass.</p>

<p>Amelia said severely, "Nathaniel, money always buys things.
This will buy a hundred sticks of penny candy. Think of that.
It's your first dollar, too, all your very own."</p>

<p>The child looked at the piece of metal with fresh respect. The
moment's awkwardness was eased. The families compared their
gifts, thanked one another. Nellie clapped her satin bonnet over
her curls and danced around the room for admiration. She left it
on when she went to the kitchen to baste the goose. The men
settled down to talk of crops and stock and prices. The women
bustled about to help Nellie put dinner on the table.</p>

<p>The table was extended almost the length of the dining room
and a smaller table was laid in a corner for the overflow of
children. The platters and tureens of food scarcely left room for
the plates and silver. The desserts were a full pastry shop,
arranged on the sideboard, as reminder to leave a little room for
them in the stomach. The Oriental spices of the plum pudding
steaming in its linen jacket lay sharply over the pungency of the
table.</p>

<p>Ase motioned Tim, hanging back timidly, to a seat beside him.
The women began heaping plates to pass to the children. Nellie's
father announced that Ase should carve the goose under his own
roof, but he was so almighty slow, and the goose happened to be
in front of his own place, and he'd have it sliced--there now,
one breast clean already--before Ase could get a hold with the
carving fork. The Wilsons roared. Ase sliced the turkey
carefully, remembering each one's preference. Tim touched him on
the knee.</p>

<p>He whispered, "May the Lord bless this fabulous bounty to the
good of body and soul."</p>

<p>Ase closed his eyes an instant. He thought of Mink Fisher and
prayed that somewhere he had found a deep warm cave and sat by a
fire with venison roasting over it and was not walking through
the snow with a hard bit of meat or white man's dry crust of
bread in his gnarled cold hand. He prayed that Benjamin might be
sitting with friends before another generous board.</p>

<p>With dinner eaten and praised, the tiered cakes and pies
wrecked and ruined, the plum pudding turned out of its cloth and
set ablaze with applejack, two bowls of sauce to pass, one hot
and yellow-foaming, the other a hard sauce creamed to a feather,
the company disintegrated like the mounds of food. The men drunk
with overeating, staggered out of the house that suddenly
confined them. They drifted to barns and sheds and scuffled their
feet and leaned against stalls and picked their teeth with golden
straws. The women sat lethargically at table a few minutes, then
set Nellie at putting away the devastated remnants while they
washed and dried the dishes, laid a fresh damask cloth and set
the table for the evening supper. The small children fell asleep
in chairs and corners, the older nibbled on Christmas candy,
knowing they should have been allowed to eat it before dinner,
when it would have tasted better, and here and there a boy found
greed or courage for a bite or two of firm-fleshed winter
apple.</p>

<p>It was too early for the evening chores. Tim and Ase sat by
the fire without speaking. The kitchen clattered with the rattle
of plate on plate, the multiplied crash of women's voices. Nat
and a young Wilson cousin had a brief quarrel over a toy. The
little girls hugged new dolls dreamily. The boys lost heart for
barley-sugar candy and peppermint and licorice sticks, for tops
and drums and pocket-knives. They collapsed flat and quiet on the
Brussels carpet.</p>

<p>Ase looked to see if Tim were over-tiring. The old man's chin
was on his chest. He was sleeping soundly. The return of the men
for supper roused him. He played a tune on his fiddle, supper was
called, was eaten, and in a drugged group-understanding, the
Wilsons hitched up their teams to the sleighs, the women gathered
up children like armfuls of rags, dropped them deep among rugs
and straw. The sleighs slid smoothly away under the early
starlight, the bells jangling, only the horses fresh,
high-stepping. Amelia graciously offered to put Nat and Arent to
bed.</p>

<p>Nellie said sleepily, "The pudding was good, if I do say
so."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Where's Tim?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he went on with some of the folks. Said the walk the rest
of the way'd do him good. Said tell you, thanks, what was it now,
anyway, thanks."</p>

<p>The moment had never come to ask McCarthy for the telling of
the Christmas story.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase stopped the plow horse at the fence corner, for rest in
the shade of a maple. The June morning was fresh but the direct
sun brought out the sweat. Old Shep threw himself to the cool
earth, his red tongue dripping. He was inclined to be a foolish
old dog, and followed Ase behind the plow for hours, when he
would stop, seem to question himself, and answer that they were
evidently going nowhere and that he was wasting his time. Ase
cooled quickly in the shade. He stepped into the bean field and
looked to the south. On the far slopes the cattle moved in pools
of white foam that were daisies. The sheep beyond, clean in their
new wool, were visible only when they fed on into patches of
buttercup or clover. Nellie had complained of a trace of wild
garlic in the milk and butter. He must have missed a few clumps
in last year's hunt for it. He himself did not mind the faint
flavor, it gave a certain richness to the June gold of the color.
Nellie had so much butter to sell, he had best trace and uproot
the garlic in the pasture.</p>

<p>He walked between the bean rows. The young plants were
healthy, but it was clear he would not have the crop of the year
before, raised southwest beyond the apple orchard. This high
field west of the house was not fertile enough for such a rank
feeder. Wheat, rye, or barley, buckwheat, these the land would
raise, hay, of course. Corn was the proper crop for these acres.
He had not had corn here since his father's death. He examined
the plants for signs of damaging insects. Only the bees were
buried head-on in the first of the bean blossoms, scanty, he
feared. The bushes plowed under after the last crop was gathered
would enrich the soil at least. Next spring he must plant corn.
It would grow taller than he and fill the sky with the sabers of
its leaves, plume-topped and rustling. He straightened instantly
and looked across the field, almost in panic, then eased. The
road that wound into the west was visible. It dipped, narrowed to
cross the wooden bridge over the willow-bordered stream, turned
up the next hill and curved in plain sight until far away. He had
been unable to plant here any crop that would block his vision.
Back along that road would come Benjamin or news of him, if
either came at all.</p>

<p>He went back slowly to take again the plow handles. He
supposed June was a fine month everywhere. Roads all over the
country would be lined with flowering thorn and hazel. Birds
would be nesting clear to California. The roads would be stony in
places, or made of clay, or churn into a fine powder like flour,
but they would all feel good under a man's feet. They would feel
good to the hoofs of a horse. A shadow passed across the field.
An eagle was flying westward. Ase thought he did not want to walk
west, or ride, but to mount an eagle. From that height he could
recognize Ben wherever he passed him far below. He felt desperate
and earthbound. He lifted the reins and the horse turned to the
field. The aging Dan felt the reins slack and only ambled between
the rows. By noon, when the dinner bell rang, Ase had not
finished the cultivating as he had expected.</p>

<p>The family was at table as he came in from the wash bench.
Nellie and Amelia were giving conflicting orders to the children.
The relations of the two women were reasonably amiable. Nat was
demanding plum preserves before he would accept more substantial
foods. Amelia, so strangely a glutton, especially for sweets, was
backing him up. The younger boy Arent waited patiently to be
served when the argument should be ended. The baby girl 'Melie
beat on the tray of her high-chair. Ase had hoped she would
resemble Nellie, but she was a tiny copy of his mother, for whom
she had been named. Perhaps the next baby would be a girl, too,
and another Nellie. The children ate heartily and rapidly, then
broke into a clatter of talk. Nellie was chatty as always. Amelia
was in a mood for talk as well, and the dining table sounded to
him like chipping-sparrows finding a ripe grain field. Nellie
passed dishes to him and he ate automatically without
consciousness of meat or bread or fruit.</p>

<p>His silence at table had been troublesome when he was a boy,
especially on the days when Benjamin was missing. Now it went
unnoticed under the cheery confusion. He seemed also to have less
and less to say. The baby was cooing like a turtle dove. With a
happy winglike motion, she swept her mug of milk to the floor.
Nellie sighed.</p>

<p>"Hoped I was through cleaning today."</p>

<p>She brushed back her curls with the gesture Ase loved. The
children were ordinarily her entire affair, but Ase rose and went
to the kitchen for a cloth. Nellie watched his awkward mopping in
amusement and took the cloth away from him to finish. She had the
strength and stamina of a cat, but she seemed tired today. The
new baby was no more than on the way, Nellie was having spells of
sickness, which she had never had in pregnancy before. He would
drive to the Svensons' tonight to see if Hulda could be spared
again this summer. It was no time to be thinking of an out-going
road, of eagles flying westward.</p>

<p>He returned to his cultivating. The bees droned. Ase decided
he would rob part of one hive in a week or so. He enjoyed taking
each new variety of honey to Nellie. The combs of apple blossom
honey would be recognizable, pale as April sunlight. The bean
blossom honey would be nearly the color of Amelia's amber beads.
Clover honey, later, would be the color of the brook water
beneath the willows, the goldenrod again would darken, and last
would come the buckwheat honey, red black, strong and pungent,
and his favorite. He thought now of the various honeys in glass
jars, joined to the sparkling jellies on the cellar shelves, and
choosing one was like choosing a jewel. He had a color plate of
gems that had come with his encyclopedia. Holding his bony
forefinger under each one, memorizing the names, he had
recognized not only the amber, but the clear ruby of the currant,
the amethyst of the plum, the jade of gooseberry, the sardonyx of
the buckwheat. He had bought the encyclopedia this spring of a
road drummer and was vaguely disappointed. Most of the
information was strange and he read with absorption of the people
and animals of other lands, of alien fruits and vegetation. But
when he turned eagerly to learn about the stars, the planets, the
cosmos, he did not find the things he was seeking. He had thought
a book so large and thick would have some answers.</p>

<p>Old Shep lay under the maple tree with no attempt to follow
the plowing. Ase turned down the final row. The mid-afternoon sun
was in his eyes, but he thought he saw movement on the western
horizon. He stopped Dan and shaded his eyes. A small rounded
white cloud seemed to be rolling slowly along the road. Then
another and another. A familiar joy filled his chest. The gypsies
had come back again with summer. He finished his row and hurried
Dan to the barn, to be ahead of his friends to greet them.</p>

<p>The white-topped wagons turned off the road and lurched to a
stop beyond the flowing spring at the edge of the apple orchard.
The drivers jumped down and stretched their arms and legs
luxuriously. The back doors of the wagons flew open and wooden
steps dropped to earth. Children spilled out like apples from an
opened sack. They were the first to see the tall gangling young
man coming toward them. They shrieked and pointed. The men lifted
their hands high and shouted.</p>

<p>"Asah!" they called. "Asah!"</p>

<p>They poured around him like the swirling waters of the brook
in flood. It was necessary to touch him. The women came more
quietly, their eyes bright as their gold loop earrings. The
slanting sun flashed on the gold, on the shining dark eyes, on
the white teeth. There were three new babies to show him. The
queen, the Old One, took his hand and pressed it against her vast
breast. Her voice was deep and tender.</p>

<p>"Asah, the bes' friend," she said.</p>

<p>The leader suddenly shouted at the men.</p>

<p>"Horse die for drink while you play! Plenty time talk to our
Asah."</p>

<p>The men unhitched the horses and led them to the mossy
watering trough below the spring. They scooped water in their
hands and drank, the drops crystal in the sun. The children
remembered the dipper and would drink only from that, crowding
for their turns. The horses were hobbled and turned loose to
graze. A narrow strip of grass grew between the road and the
beginning of the buckwheat planted in the orchard. The buckwheat
shoots were young and tender. Ase saw the horses munching
instinctively toward them. He would not hurt his friends by
halting the horses now.</p>

<p>The women brought out their great black iron cooking kettles
and smaller copper pots and pans. Boys were sent for twigs and
branches to start the camp fire. Young men brought the whole
carcasses of two lambs from the wagons and set about dressing
them. A calf was tethered to graze. Ase smiled. The lambs had
certainly come from a flock near Peytonville and just as
certainly had not been paid for. He did not recognize the calf.
He himself was perhaps the only farmer in these parts from whom
the gypsies did not steal. But then, they had no need to. The
women took over the meat for cutting. The kettles were half
filled with water from the spring, pieces of meat and fragrant
herbs were added. Girls sat about peeling onions and potatoes.
Spits were set up for roasting haunches and special tidbits. More
wood was needed, to make beds of coals, to keep the fires burning
for the cooking and for the night's lighting.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Send the boys up the lane past the barn. There's
hickory wood cut there."</p>

<p>Speech came easily with these people.</p>

<p>He said now to the leader, "The feed's not too good here.
We'll take the horses for oats and hay. You can put them in the
pasture with mine, or in the stalls."</p>

<p>The leader flashed his teeth. His name was unpronounceable and
Ase called him "Pav."</p>

<p>"Horse like us. No stalls. Everything best under sky. Food,
sleep, love," Pav said.</p>

<p>Ase smiled and nodded. The horses were led to the barns and
given oats, then led out to the fenced pasture and turned free
without hobbles. Dan and Moll and Prince snorted, ran circling,
remembered the small pied sturdy visitors from last summer,
halted to touch noses. The Romany animals broke into joyful
racing over the pasture hill. Ase and Pav leaned on the pasture
gate and watched them.</p>

<p>Ase said, "The roan is new. Why, isn't he Grimstedt's
four-year-old?"</p>

<p>"Is so. I trade my old Betsy for him."</p>

<p>"What did you give to boot?"</p>

<p>"Little brass ring, is all."</p>

<p>Ase stared at him.</p>

<p>He said, "The roan's worth four of Betsy."</p>

<p>Pav poked his friend in the ribs and chuckled.</p>

<p>"I tell only you. Secret. I buy eggs old Grim, pay two times
too much, say nothing. I say, 'I need money so bad, I sell you my
fine Betsy ten dollar.' Old Grim lick lips. He know Betsy worth
twenty-five, thirty. He make trade quick like a wasp. I take
little brass ring off Betsy's collar, put with kiss in
pocket.</p>

<p>"Grim ask, 'What that?' I say, 'Reason I can sell Betsy ten
dollar. I take money now.' Grim go crazy."</p>

<p>Pav looked around as though the birds were spying and said
close to Ase's ear, "I tell him sometimes one mare, not all,
sometimes special mare, with gypsy brass ring on collar, she find
gold and treasure. Just stop short over gold and treasure and
switch tail. I show him gold ring, old gold pieces. 'Oh yes,' I
say, 'Betsy just stop short and switch tail. I dig a little.
Rings, gold, always there, sometimes not much, sometimes big
much, always something. Oh yes.' Betsy not so young, I say, I
never cheat him. I got young mare can do same thing with brass
ring on collar, so I not lose. Grim shake like leaf. So, I get
fine young roan for Betsy, just give little brass ring to
boot."</p>

<p>Ase smiled. It was common knowledge that Grimstedt, mean and
miserly, was convinced there was buried treasure on his land. Pav
began to shake with mirth. He poked Ase in the ribs again.</p>

<p>"Now, best of joke. Betsy terrible balker. Old Grim gonna have
holes dug all over three hundred acres."</p>

<p>Pav let loose the full peals of his laughter and Ase was
obliged to laugh silently with him. Pav sobered.</p>

<p>"Greedy man biggest fool in world," he said.</p>

<p>Ase longed to pass on the story to Nellie. Her humor ran to
practical joking, and certainly no joke could be more practical
than this one. Yet he was bound to respect Pav's confidence and
should do so. The two men turned back to the barns. Pav watched
idly and talked of other trades during the past year, rather more
honorable but equally shrewd. Ase did his chores and started to
the house for the milk buckets.</p>

<p>He said, "When I'm done, I'll bring you a few things for
supper."</p>

<p>Pav said, "You eat with us tonight. We go tomorrow. So long
'til next year to talk, play."</p>

<p>Ase nodded.</p>

<p>Pav said, "Bring the flute. We got new song."</p>

<p>Ase turned at the front path to the house.</p>

<p>He asked, "Think it'll be safe for you around here next year?
Old Grimstedt'll be ready to trade Betsy back with a charge of
buckshot to boot."</p>

<p>Pav's dark eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"No worry, my friend. Betsy so old she be dead next year, way
old Grim gonna keep her hunt treasure. So I say old Grim, 'Too
bad, too bad.' I let him cheat me then. Maybe one dollar."</p>

<p>Gathering the milk buckets and the skimmed milk for the hogs,
Ase wondered why he was not more shocked by the Rom's dishonesty,
himself with a passion for the truth. It must be from the very
fact that each trade had been based on some man's avarice, of
which Pav had only taken advantage. No man honest in his heart
would have been taken in. The stealing of stock was a more
serious matter. Yet even here, the gypsies only stole from those
who drove them off with oaths, or refused to sell them the needed
foodstuffs, such as milk and bread for the children and hay and
grain for their horses. Where they received fair treatment, they
repaid in double measure.</p>

<p>Tonight he had four brimming buckets of milk. He had to make
two trips between barn and house. Nellie was busy in the kitchen
and he strained three of the buckets. He approached her with some
uncertainty, to ask for the other bucketful, for the egg and
butter money was her own and gave her many small luxuries dear to
her, a pretty shawl, a new piece of china, or something special
for the children. He cleared his throat. She looked over her
shoulder from her work at the stove.</p>

<p>"I know. You've come begging for the gypsies. I saw them.
Heard them. Save your breath."</p>

<p>She laughed at sight of his doleful face.</p>

<p>"Now what do you want for them? You know I've never refused
you. Just get it out quick before your Ma comes complaining."</p>

<p>He put his arms around her little plump body and nuzzled her
warm neck. It was true, she had never refused him. She was as
openhanded as he. Only in the case of Tim McCarthy, something
seemed to harden in her.</p>

<p>"Sweet Nellie," he said.</p>

<p>She kissed the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>"You don't need to make up to me, either," she said, "to get
things extra."</p>

<p>She pushed a pot to the back of the stove. She brought a large
wicker hamper and began heaping it with fresh salt-rising bread,
pats of butter, cottage cheese, jars of apple butter and
preserves, doughnuts and cookies, and balanced carefully on top,
three pies. He watched her with adoration.</p>

<p>She said, "See you've saved a bucket of milk. Suppose those
wild young ones don't get it very often, but Lord knows, they
look as healthy as ours. Hurry up now, Ase. Don't stand there
gawking at me. You've seen me before. Remember? I'm Nellie
Linden. Better come back for the milk."</p>

<p>She gave him a shove.</p>

<p>The hamper was heavy. He carried it in front of him with both
hands, feeling the terrain under his feet slowly, so as not to
stumble and spill off the precariously perched pies. The hamper
stood for days of Nellie's work. Yet that work seemed always to
sit lightly.</p>

<p>"You've seen me before. I'm Nellie Linden."</p>

<p>Indeed, she was his Nellie Linden, his love and his
delight.</p>

<p>The gypsy children shrieked over the hamper and were hushed by
their mothers. Generosity was too rare a thing to permit a greedy
peeking and grabbing.</p>

<p>Ase said, "From my wife--."</p>

<p>He glowed with pride in her. The queen, the Old One herself,
unpacked the hamper. The sweet foods were laid to themselves on a
white cloth on the grass. A great bowl of cottage cheese made a
focal point and the other dishes were grouped around it. The Old
One's daughter Elissa smiled at Ase and wandered away. She
returned with handfuls of daisies and scattered them among the
foods to make a banquet table of the earth. The odors from the
stewing kettles and the spits were rich and heavy on the evening
air. The meats would not be done before nightfall. The Old One
gravely gave each now silent child one doughnut and one
cookie.</p>

<p>She said to Ase, "We wish all your house to eat with
ours."</p>

<p>He inclined his head in thanks. He returned to the house for
the milk. Nellie had evidently given away her full supply of
bread, for she was stirring up a bowl of muffin batter.</p>

<p>He said, "I'd like to eat with the Roms tonight. The Old One
wants all of us."</p>

<p>In the earliest years of their marriage Nellie had often
joined the gypsies with him for a night of singing and dancing.
His heart had thumped to see her twirling light-footed to their
tunes. Once a black rage had filled him when she danced alone
with Pav's handsome, intense son. For the last three years Nellie
had no more than made a morning call at the camp.</p>

<p>She said, "I'm not in the notion, Ase. What I want under my
bottom tonight is my bed, not the hard ground."</p>

<p>She looked at him innocently.</p>

<p>"I knew we'd be asked, so I spoke to your Ma. She'll go along
with you."</p>

<p>He stared incredulously. His spirits sank. His mother withdrew
at the time of the gypsies as she had once done from Mink
Fisher's visits. Her dislike of them had always a little chilled
his pleasure. She must have gotten wind of the big hamper, had
perhaps seen him carrying it down the road, and wished only to
see for herself the amount, in order to protest the giving. Her
presence would fall across the gaiety like a rain of sleet.
Nellie's round little breasts began to shake.</p>

<p>"Ase, Ase. Your Ma doesn't even know yet they're here."</p>

<p>He felt the usual mingling of irritation and relief. This time
the relief was the greater. His face of course had given him
away, where he would never have expressed in words his horror at
the thought of his mother among the gypsies. He picked up the
bucket of milk.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now get home sometime tonight."</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Where's Nat? He might like to go."</p>

<p>She looked at him shrewdly, so that he wondered how much she
knew.</p>

<p>"Pa stopped by when you were milking. Nat asked to take Arent
and go on home with him to spend the night."</p>

<p>Ase nodded.</p>

<p>"I won't stay too late," he said. "The Roms have to move on
tomorrow."</p>

<p>When Nat was four, he had introduced him happily to the
gypsies. He remembered his tremulous joy when they had first
begun coming in his own boyhood. His first evening of music and
play with them had been like a new star in his sky. They had
accepted him at once, as had Mink Fisher. On summer days he had
watched long hours from the westerly slope for the first glimpse
of the rolling wagons. He had run to the bridge to meet them, to
have room made for him on the lead driver's seat, only to be
overcome with shyness, until their warmth and affection eased
him.</p>

<p>He had watched Nat's face in anticipation of the growing light
of boy-wonder. Nat had stared big-eyed, had circled around the
gypsy children as though they were strange animals. The
dawn-glory had never appeared, the young imagination had never
leaped with fire. Ase had thought that Amelia must have passed on
in advance her contempt to the child. Yet her displeasure had
been for himself no more than a chill wind on a bright spring
day. Nat had since played an occasional desultory game with the
gypsy boys, always one of his own planning, and he the leader. He
had once eaten with them and had made rude faces over the rabbit
stew.</p>

<p>Last summer Nat had led the boys to the bog in a game of
Indians. If the gypsy adults knew what happened, they kept it to
themselves. What Ase saw for himself was the group of boys,
without Nat, coming in silence to the camp fires, half carrying
one of their smallest, pale and shivering and covered from head
to foot with the evil muck of the bog. The others had wiped it
from his face and eyes as best they could. The boy's mother took
him over, to wash and dress and comfort, scolding him at the same
time for going near the bog.</p>

<p>Ase asked the group of silent boys, "Why did you go to the
bog?"</p>

<p>They shrugged their shoulders.</p>

<p>One said, "To play. We didn't know it was near."</p>

<p>He was obliged to ask, "Did Nat take you? He knows
better."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>He persisted, "I must whip him if he did."</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another and began to giggle.</p>

<p>One said, "We were just running. Nobody take us."</p>

<p>They chorused, "Just running."</p>

<p>"You understand now, you must never go there again. You see
what can happen when you go too close and step in."</p>

<p>Again they exchanged glances and there was no laughter.</p>

<p>Nat had not appeared at the house until suppertime. He was a
mass of bruises. One eye was swollen shut. He had, it seemed,
already had his beating. Ase was cold to his marrow. He took the
boy aside.</p>

<p>He asked, "Why did you take the gypsy boys near the bog? Have
you forgotten the calf this spring?"</p>

<p>Nat scuffled his feet.</p>

<p>He said sullenly, "I didn't take them. They oughtn't have
blamed me."</p>

<p>"But you were the one knew the danger. You could have stopped
them. Before they got close enough for one to step in."</p>

<p>Nat looked at his father with an odd glint in his eye. Amelia
came into the room.</p>

<p>"Asahel, leave the child alone. He's already told me what
happened. He should never have been allowed to play with those
wild animals. He could have been the one to fall in. I wouldn't
put it past them for one of them to push him in."</p>

<p>Nat shouted, "I tell you, it wasn't my fault. We were just
running."</p>

<p>The words were the same the gypsy boys had used. Ase turned
away.</p>

<p>"Very well, Nat. Never let this happen again."</p>

<p>He had gone back to the gypsies that evening with foreboding.
They had greeted him gaily as always. If the elders had done any
questioning they were evidently satisfied. He had almost
forgotten the incident. Now, with Nat's retreat, his fears were
with him again. His heart was as heavy as his milk bucket.</p>

<p>The camp supper was ready. The fires had died down and slow
spirals of blue smoke arose, to disappear against the setting
sun. Low shafts of golden light slanted under the apple trees.
The birds twittered sleepily and the bees flew drowsily home to
the hives. The Old One motioned Ase to sit beside her. Elissa
filled his bowl from the stew kettle and brought him a dripping
square of roasted lamb. The Old One patted his knee.</p>

<p>"Eat now," she said. "Throw away the sad face. Later, I tell
you your troubles in the palm."</p>

<p>The gypsy band ate leisurely in spite of their appetite,
taking time out for arguments, waving pieces of meat in the air
to accent a point, falling to the food again, the argument ending
as unexpectedly as it had begun. The children gnawed on bones
sideways like young foxes. The highly seasoned stew burned Ase's
throat, but he had always liked it. He had a second bowl,
refusing Nellie's familiar dishes. The women praised her cooking.
The children could not get enough of the sweets and the warm
creamy milk. The orchard was probed by a rosy light, was
abandoned by it. The twilight was the blue of the hickory smoke.
Then it too drifted across the valley, trailed over the hilltops
and was gone. There was a time of dusk that was never darkness.
The men threw themselves on their backs in the soft grass and
stared at the night sky. Stars were tangled in the apple
branches. A gleam in the east became the crescent moon. Pav
studied it.</p>

<p>"No rain," he decided.</p>

<p>The women stirred. They stowed away the quantities of uneaten
food and washed the bowls and utensils at the flowing spring.
They packed Nellie's hamper with her clean pans and platters. The
boys built up the campfires. Pav passed a jug of a fiery sweet
liquor tasting of peaches. He brought his zither, another his
guitar, one an accordion.</p>

<p>Pav said, "We eat too much. Tonight we sing and play. No
dance."</p>

<p>Ase leaned on one elbow to listen. The first tunes were sad
and no voice sang. They were laments without words from long ago
and far away. There was a homesickness in them that broke the
heart. Ase wondered if these people, rovers by choice, longed yet
for forgotten hearths of centuries ago. And had some necessity
other than the one within themselves first set them to wandering
on the highways of the world? Pav swept his strong brown fingers
across the strings of his zither. The other instruments fell
silent. Pav sang. He sang love songs of such sweetness as the
thrush might envy. They were songs of trysts, of love achieved
and love betrayed, or cold at last.</p>

<p>The eyes of the Old One's daughter flashed in the firelight.
Her nursling was asleep in her arms but Ase felt the old spark
leap between them. There had been a time when it had been a spark
bright as a star. He had loved Nellie always, but she had been
Ben's girl. His youth had yearned to the gypsy girl. The Old One
had encouraged it. The summer before Benjamin had gone away he
had danced night after night with Elissa and felt her heart beat
hard against his own. The Old One had watched.</p>

<p>She had nodded and said to him, "Elissa bring great gift of
love. You have good life with us. Some day, you be gypsy
king."</p>

<p>The thought of the open road had stirred him and he was
tempted. The girl tempted him. Something held him back. He had
made no answer. When Benjamin had left him Nellie and she had
offered herself, for it amounted to that, he forgot Elissa, he
was lost in Nellie. Now, tonight, his flash of desire for the
gypsy made him feel for an instant disloyal. It seemed a natural
thing for Ben to move casually from one woman to another. It was
not natural for him, he thought, who had given his heart once and
for all. Well, and so he had. He recognized that the male impulse
was a thing almost apart, it responded as simply and
instinctively as a singing bird to daylight. He smiled at Elissa
with friendliness. All she did, he realized, was to make him feel
more the man.</p>

<p>Pav cried, "Enough sad! Now, Asah, the flute!"</p>

<p>Ase brought his flute from inside his shirt. Pav lifted a
finger. The instruments broke into a favorite dance tune, merry
and shrill as a flock of starlings. The rest of the night's
playing was lively, ending with a wild thing Ase had never heard
before. He tried to follow it. It was too fast, too intricate,
and though they played it several times for him, more slowly, he
was unable to pick it up. Pav laughed.</p>

<p>"Only real gypsy can play that," he said.</p>

<p>The children had fallen asleep under all the tumult. The women
threw blankets over the older and carried the younger inside the
wagons. The men inched closer to the fires and yawned. They would
sleep on the ground on a fine June night like this. The Old One
took Ase's hand and turned the palm to the light.</p>

<p>"No. Tomorrow. Before we go."</p>

<p>The campfires were like bivouacs under the apple trees. The
sky was a blue net filled with silver fish. Ase found Nellie
sleeping soundly. He longed to rouse her, but she had seemed so
tired today. He fitted his gaunt body around the curve of her
back and rested one hand gently over her breast. She did not
stir.</p>

<p>The queen herself returned the hamper at sunrise. Ase had been
restless all night and was up early to start the kitchen fire.
Curled in the bottom of a china bowl was a golden necklace of
antique design. The Old One hushed him as he tried to speak.</p>

<p>"No, no, is nothing. Now come with me."</p>

<p>The wagons were hitched and nearly ready to go. Ase marveled
that the men had driven in the horses so silently that he had
never heard them. The Old One led him up the back steps of the
lead wagon. It was immaculate. Copper pots hanging along the
walls caught the first glint of the sun. The lace curtains at the
windows were snowy. The floor was carpeted. She motioned him to
the bunk beside her. He held out his hand. She waved it away.</p>

<p>"I tell from the heart today, not the palm. You worry. I know
you since little boy. You worry, your son, the Nat one."</p>

<p>She watched his face. He nodded.</p>

<p>"Is not quite good boy. Is not quite bad. Is too young be
sure. Is all think for the Nat. Not big inside, like you. I tell
you this. Now stop worry."</p>

<p>She laid her hand with its mass of gold rings over his.</p>

<p>"Now this. This, yes, worry. Have seen your brother."</p>

<p>Her hand tightened as she watched him.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Move now. Last snow, we go far that way." She pointed to the
southwest. "See your brother there."</p>

<p>His throat was too dry for questions. She spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>"Is well, is strong. No worry there. Women?" She shrugged her
shoulders. "Sure. Tha's all right, is natural. Drink? Not too
bad, maybe. Now. Is gamble bad. Is lose money. Is got coat to
back, is all. I feed him two times, then he slip away."</p>

<p>Ase managed to ask, "Can I write him anywhere? Can you take
him money for me?"</p>

<p>"We not like ever see him again."</p>

<p>She put her hand inside her bright embroidered blouse and
fumbled for something.</p>

<p>"I find girl he knew. She write this for me. Place he think he
be when next snow fly."</p>

<p>She brought out a crumpled piece of paper. An illiterate hand
had printed in pencil the name of a town in Nevada. He stared at
it.</p>

<p>"Did he--send us a message?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Did he--ask about us?"</p>

<p>"Ask, yes. I tell him, mother fine, wife, three childs, all
fine."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"He say, 'Ase fool stay on farm, raise crops and kids.' He go
away laughing in ragged coat."</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"Now have tell you all."</p>

<p>He turned the paper over, and back again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me this yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Give you one happy night. Yes? Worry not so bad in good
sun."</p>

<p>He stumbled down the steps from the wagon. Pav clapped him on
the shoulder. The last children piled into the wagons, the steps
were drawn up, the doors closed. Pav leaped to his seat and
cracked his long red-tasseled whip over the lead team. The wagons
rolled. The children waved from the lace-curtained windows. He
watched after them down the easterly road as far as he could see
them. They took with them the thing they shared with him, the
knowledge of freedom.</p>

<p>He walked slowly to the house. Ben was well and strong. His
mother would rejoice in that. Ben had asked about them all. Ben
was on the move again. He might be in Nevada when winter came.
All this he could tell her, could try to make much of it as best
his awkward tongue allowed. He could not tell her that Benjamin
had gone as a hungry beggar to the gypsies. He steadied himself
outside the kitchen door. He opened it. Nellie was fastening the
gold necklace around her plump white throat. Her eyes were
dancing. He could not tell even Nellie that Benjamin had gone
away laughing in his ragged coat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase moved blindly through the morning's work. Nellie's
pleasure in the necklace spared him her recognition of his
anxiety. He avoided his mother. He needed the full day to prepare
himself for passing on his news of Benjamin. He wanted to give it
in the quiet lull after supper when the children were in bed. He
wanted to have ready for Amelia, as well, some suggestion, some
practical plan, for reaching Ben. Otherwise, she would burst into
the hysteria that was so close to insanity. She had been almost
normal since her return from Indiana. She had begun brooding only
lately. Ben's "fiancee," with whom she had been corresponding,
had never heard from him again. In her last letter, the girl had
given up all hope.</p>

<p>Shoveling manure from the cow barn to the compost heap, Ase
thought that if Hulda's brother Eric would come as hired man, it
was not too late to plant an extra acreage of potatoes for a cash
crop. The apple orchard was in full heavy bearing. The fruit
should bring a good price among the townsfolk. If the fall
harvest brought in enough money, there was no reason why he
should not set out for Nevada in, say, November, to find
Benjamin. Planning for the help of Eric reminded him that the
coming of the gypsies had prevented his seeing the Svensons to
ask about Hulda for Nellie. He finished cleaning out the stalls
and went to the house to wash, Nellie was not in the kitchen,
although it was the time of morning when she usually began
cooking the noon dinner. He found her lying down in their
bedroom.</p>

<p>She was pale. He sat on the edge of the bed and took her
hand.</p>

<p>"Tired, Nellie?"</p>

<p>He stroked her hair.</p>

<p>"Been sick as a stuffed pup. Can't make it out. I felt good
when I was carrying the others."</p>

<p>"Maybe we started this one too soon after 'Melie."</p>

<p>"Maybe so. Fine time to think of it."</p>

<p>They smiled at each other. The memory was still strong in them
of that warm and windy April day under the hemlocks on the south
hill. She had brought him fresh cake in mid-afternoon. She was
wearing a blue gingham ruffled sunbonnet and a blue gingham
dress. She had pushed back the sunbonnet. She had her curls
twisted and piled on top of her head, as was suitable for a young
matron. Ase had taken out the hairpins and shaken the curls down
around her shoulders. She looked to him like a ruffled blue
gentian and her breath was sweet with wintergreen leaves she had
gathered on her way. The hemlock needles were a soft and fragrant
bed. The April breeze had lifted the hemlock boughs in a rocking
motion, the earth had spun under them in one direction and the
blue April sky had reeled over them in another. They had been
almost too dizzy to stand.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm driving over to Svenson's to try to get Hulda
and Eric both. Come go with me."</p>

<p>Ordinarily she dropped any work she was doing, from churning
through washing to baking, to ride with him on his errands. She
shook her head.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sit up right now if my life depended on it. You'd
better eat with them if they ask you."</p>

<p>"They always ask. I'll take the boys along."</p>

<p>"That'll be good. Get them out of my way. Your Ma can fix
herself and 'Melie a bite for once. Don't take the boys off
dirty. Those Swedes are deadly clean."</p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled through her misery.</p>

<p>"Tell Hulda I promise not to scare her again. I do need her if
I'm going to cut up like this."</p>

<p>Ase changed his clothes. He found the boys playing in the hay
mow and so, comparatively unsoiled. They needed only a face and
hand washing and hair brushing to be presentable. The sweet hay
had even made them smell fresh, instead of like a nest of mice.
They whooped ahead of him, excited that they were to ride in
Nellie's rubber-tired buggy behind Prince, who sometimes made
life worth while by running away. They jostled each other and
chattered and quarreled amiably. Ase retired again into his
thoughts. They drove unseeing past the June hedges and fields
until Nat's sharp greedy nose caught the scent of the first wild
strawberries. Ase waited patiently while they rushed over a stone
fence into a field, to plunder and pull and cram their young
maws. Nat was still eating when Ase was obliged to call them in,
but Arent brought his father a handsome spray. The boys' hands,
faces and morning-clean blue cotton shirts were a mass of stains.
Ase stopped at the next brook and cleaned them up as far as
possible with his pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>The Svenson place on the main road north of Peytonville was
small as to house and acreage, but brought to full production
with Scandinavian genius and energy. The family had arrived on
foot not too many years ago, owning no more than the bundles they
carried on sticks over their shoulders. The natives had kept away
from them, complaining of the intrusion of foreigners. Ase had
been among the first to call on them, to offer help in home
building, or the loan of horse or cow or implements. The family
had been already a large one, the older children had hired out at
once, and the Svensons had prospered.</p>

<p>"We were all foreigners to begin with," he thought.</p>

<p>Only the Indians were born Americans. A few years of the
little red schoolhouse turned the Swedish and Norwegian boys and
girls, the German, the Irish, all of them, into children
indistinguishable from the native-born, except where a mop of
straw colored hair like a thatched roof, a round bullet head, or
a pair of smoky blue eyes revealed an older nationality.</p>

<p>The Svenson door was wide open to sun and air. Dinner was
being put on the table and the Lindens were made welcome. There
was not the variety of Nellie's table, but the food was ample and
good. Ase spoke of his business before Mrs. Svenson began with
Hulda and the other girls to clear the table, for he had found
her the dominant element in the family.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Linden said to tell you she won't scare you again,
Hulda," he finished.</p>

<p>Hulda snorted and giggled.</p>

<p>"That Mis' Linden! I t'ink I die. Hide behint garden gate when
I go at dark for lettuce and raise up cabbage head on stick. I
t'ink it devil himself."</p>

<p>Ase said soberly, "She's not feeling up to her tricks these
days. She was very sick this morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Svenson asked, "She expectin', then? How long? Two-three
month now? Yah, Hulda, you go. Eric, what you t'ink for you?"</p>

<p>The big powerful eighteen-year-old studied his rough
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes. If I go to training school next year I need the
money."</p>

<p>"Crazy boy, Mr. Linden. Wants to work wit' machine, not farm
like his Papa. Maybe he see good money you make, change his mind.
All settled then. We bring Eric and Hulda tonight, bags and the
baggages."</p>

<p>Ase walked with Svenson and the older boys around their farm
for the polite time of conversation, made his thanks for dinner
and took his leave. At the fork in the road he stopped and had
Nat hold the reins while he counted the money in his wallet. His
credit was good anywhere in Peytonville but he preferred to keep
it so, against a day when it might be needed. He had enough cash
and continued on the road into town. Will Peyton had a new brand
of seed potatoes on hand, highly recommended for quick growing,
and Ase decided on these because of the lateness of the season.
He estimated the acreage he would plant and the sacks of potatoes
were stowed in the small open compartment behind the single buggy
seat. He had a dozen or so pennies in change in his snap-purse.
He went to the glass candy counter for a treat for the
children.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Let me pick my own, Pa, gimme the pennies."</p>

<p>Ase divided between the two. He bought a bottle of tonic that
Peyton assured him was unfailing for settling a lady's stomach
when she was delicate. He looked around for some delicacy for
Nellie and settled on a package of Sultana raisins, then added a
bottle of rose water. It was mid-afternoon and he hurried Nat
over his decision as to which candies gave him the most for his
money. Nellie was up, and in the kitchen, when they reached home.
She looked herself again, and rested.</p>

<p>"Nobody but you, Ase Linden, could take all this time to ask
the Svensons a simple question. Eric and Hulda coming?"</p>

<p>He nodded. It was too laborious to tell twice of his plans, of
his trip to Peytonville for seed potatoes. He changed his clothes
without comment and went about his evening chores. He called the
boys to feed the chickens. The hogs were rooting in the woods now
and needed no more than the swill and the skimmed milk. He was
anxious to finish supper early, to hold the family conference
before the Svensons appeared. Supper was ready ahead of him.
Amelia sat daintily at table, in a fresh frilled dress of
Nellie's washing and ironing. But perhaps she had given Nellie a
little help today when she found her ill. The excitement of the
day had used the boys' energy and it was not difficult to
persuade them to bed when they were allowed to take their
half-eaten candy with them. They divided reluctantly with 'Melie,
who went to bed too with her share.</p>

<p>Nellie asked idly, "Svensons gave them the candy?"</p>

<p>"I had to go to Peytonville. They got it there."</p>

<p>He went to his coat and brought her the tonic and raisins and
rose water. Amelia lifted her heavy eyebrows. He realized he
should have brought her too at least a token.</p>

<p>He said, "I have news for you, Mother."</p>

<p>Nellie looked at him sharply. He must have news indeed when he
volunteered to open a conversation. They watched him expectantly.
He cleared his throat. In spite of his rehearsals it seemed
impossible to begin. He must not permit any trace of his own
anxiety to show through. He saw his mother frown, saw her mind
begin to work toward various suppositions.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Out with it, Ase. Is it about Ben?"</p>

<p>He said gratefully, "Yes."</p>

<p>Amelia jumped from her chair and came to him. She clutched his
shoulders with hard, probing claws. She shook him angrily.</p>

<p>"Stupid ox! How is he? Where is he? Is he coming home?"</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Leave him alone, Mother Linden. Now Ase, just
begin with how you got the news and go on from there."</p>

<p>That was the way he had planned to do. He seized the cue as he
would a life line. He swallowed. He spoke by memorized rote.</p>

<p>"The gypsies saw him last winter in the southwest. The Old One
never saw him looking so well and strong. He left ahead of them.
He has prospects in Nevada for this winter. I have the
address."</p>

<p>He touched his shirt pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm planting five acres or more of potatoes. If I make enough
on the crops, I thought I'd try to meet him out there when the
harvest's in. I thought I'd ask him to come back for the winter,
if he can leave his business."</p>

<p>He faltered. Amelia's black gimlet eyes bored into him.</p>

<p>"What else about him?"</p>

<p>"The last the Old One saw of him, he was in fine spirits. He
went away--laughing."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Give me the letter from my son. How dare you hold back his
message to his mother?"</p>

<p>He was trapped in spite of his precautions.</p>

<p>"I forgot, he inquired of all of us."</p>

<p>"Give me the letter in your pocket."</p>

<p>He said gently, "There isn't any letter, Mother."</p>

<p>He drew the rough printed paper from his shirt and gave it to
her. She turned it over and over, as he had done.</p>

<p>"You swear this is all?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>She was a dark cedar struck by lightning. She stood blasted.
As though the life sap oozed from her, tears seeped from her
eyes. They collected, flowed down her face.</p>

<p>She dropped the paper to the floor and groped to her door,
closing it behind her.</p>

<p>Ase had expected her to go mad with excitement, to insist even
that he set out for Nevada at once, harvest or no. He had not
been prepared for this. News of Benjamin's death would have been
more welcome to her, if it might preserve the illusion of his
love.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Queer old girl, isn't she? Now if I were you,
I'd write Ben to both places. The one he left and the one where
he's going. Tell him it won't kill him to write his Ma now and
then."</p>

<p>She asked suspiciously, "Has he done something he's ashamed
of? Is he making money, or down on his luck?"</p>

<p>He looked at her imploringly.</p>

<p>She said, "Well, Ben'll always come out all right. He doesn't
give a tinker's dam if he don't."</p>

<p>She had given him the only comfort possible. It was true, Ben
didn't give a tinker's dam. He looked through the bay window. The
sun had set but the sky was saffron and gold. Slowly though he
wrote, with more assurance than he spoke, there was time to write
Ben before the Svensons came.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I've got to get to bed. Something's wrong with
my legs. Put Eric in the room over the woodshed. Hulda can have
her old room at the back corner. Tell her to go ahead and make
breakfast if I'm not down ahead of her."</p>

<p>She tousled his black hair, passing him. He caught her hand
and held it against his cheek.</p>

<p>"You're turning into an old man, worrying," she said.</p>

<p>The room was quiet. Only the old clock ticked away with a
sound of importance, as though time would stand still without its
alertness. He brought pen and ink and paper to the round
baize-covered table near the window. A thrush sang flutelike its
evening song from the grape arbor, flew to the garden gate, then
on to its sleeping place in the hemlocks. A cow mooed caressingly
to her calf. The sheep in pasture bleated to one another. The
creature world fell silent. The scent of yellow roses on the
garden fence eddied through an open window. The June twilight was
blue. Ase shifted his paper. He dipped his pen and began to
write.</p>

<p>"Dear son and brother:</p>

<p>I am writing you from all of us--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c19">XIX</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Amelia kept to her room for a week. She allowed Hulda to set
trays inside her door and come for them again. Nat whined outside
for entrance and at last she let him in. She appeared at the
dinner table one noon without comment. She was haggard but her
manner was cheerful. Insisting as always that she had no
appetite, she ate with the heartiness of Eric.</p>

<p>The young Swedes were good natured, with little to say, but
the family table lost its coziness for Ase with the presence of
the hired man and girl. Fortunately, Hulda was always anxious to
get back to the kitchen to begin washing dishes, and Eric to get
out of doors to smoke his pipe. There was left a pleasant
interval when the family could dawdle over dessert and talk of
private matters.</p>

<p>Amelia said brightly, "You'd think I'd lost my senses. It came
to me that I couldn't expect that dreadful gypsy woman to take
care of Benjamin's letter to me. She lost it, of course, if she
didn't just throw it in the first pond she came to."</p>

<p>She helped herself to another wedge of cherry pie.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder she managed to hang on to his address. I'm
writing him that he mustn't be so trusting, turning over his
precious letters to people like that. No telling how many he's
sent that way. All lost, all lost. And what he must be thinking
of me for never answering. From now on, until he comes back to
his own home, he must use the regular mails. I intend to be quite
firm with him. Put out that address for me, Asahel, before you go
to the field."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase wrote him, Mother Linden. A week ago. If it
reaches him, maybe we'll be hearing by the end of July."</p>

<p>"I shan't wait to hear. I want him to have a good scolding
right away."</p>

<p>She was flushed and self-satisfied. Ase's eyes met Nellie's.
He left the table.</p>

<p>Hulda said, "Dinner all right, Mr. Linden? I don't cook good
like the Missus, but I try."</p>

<p>"It was fine, Hulda."</p>

<p>He wanted to thank her for doing so much more than was
expected of her. She had kept Nellie in bed for two days, had
slipped in an enormous washing and ironing by herself. She
insisted on doing everything that was heavy or laborious. Nellie
was feeling quite well again.</p>

<p>"It was fine," he repeated.</p>

<p>Eric sat in the sun with his back against the woodshed. The
smoke from his rank tobacco came in quick puffs out of the
porcelain pipe bowl.</p>

<p>"I think it's time to try something, Mr. Linden," he said.
"That acreage of potatoes is too much to try to plant by hand,
just the two of us. I made this."</p>

<p>He pointed to a small contraption, a wooden box with handles
and a front wheel from an old wheelbarrow. The box had a slit in
the bottom, and a lever.</p>

<p>"I saw a mechanical seeder when I was in Trent. This won't
work as good for potatoes as for seeds, the chunks are apt to
jam, but if it works at all, we'll save a week anyway. Getting
mighty late for potatoes."</p>

<p>Ase studied the planter and marveled at the boy's ingenuity.
He found himself marveling, too, how quickly these young aliens
lost their foreign accent and idiom. The first generation never
did. Even Hulda, too old for school when the Svensons had
arrived, would always say "t'ank" and "t'ink" and avoid
connecting participles. Eric had had five years in the Linden
schoolhouse. Ase smiled at him.</p>

<p>"Guess you were born for machinery, all right," he said.</p>

<p>Eric led the way to the new acreage proudly. It had had to be
readied from scratch, the rank pasture grasses turned under, the
field harrowed, the rows lined off. Yesterday had been
heart-and-back-breaking, dropping the cut pieces one by one in
the hilled furrows. As Eric predicted, the planter did not work
smoothly for long at a time. One chunk of potato too large or
uneven for the slot jammed everything. Yet for half a row at a
time, the little implement rolled along, the pieces dropping
spaced and evenly. It was a one-man job.</p>

<p>Ase said, "You should have made me one, Eric, too. You go
ahead with it. I'll begin at the other end by hand."</p>

<p>They worked steadily. Eric's face was bright, his pale hair
gold in the sun. Ase was surprised that Svenson had been willing
to release the boy for the summer. It would make a man
light-hearted to have such a son laboring beside him.</p>

<p>A day and a half completed the potato planting. A good night
rain soaked the earth. Green sprouts appeared within a week, then
crinkled leaves. The bean blossoms dried, the young beans were
infinitesimal pointed swords. Sun and rain alternated, the beans
matured rapidly. The winter wheat was ripening. Any breath of
wind made it ripple like tawny flowing hair. The summer apples
were sweetening under their thin rosy skins. Wild strawberries
had been eaten with thick golden cream, made into extravagant
tarts and shortcakes, preserved in the sun, and were now done
with. Huckleberries and blueberries made puddings and pies. The
hedges were thick with blackberries and the birds quarreled with
the Lindens over their gathering. Wild raspberries were ripening
in thick and almost inaccessible tangles.</p>

<p>Buttercups were gone. The last of the daisies met the first of
the wild roses. Wild chicory in flower was the blue of Nellie's
eyes. There was no use for Ase to gather it to take to her, for
the blooms closed tight the moment they were brought into the
house. Nellie was again not well. Her ill health was as unnatural
as the failure of the sun to rise, and for Ase as disturbing. The
road doctor stopped one day and Ase engaged him to stay a few
days to examine and treat her. Her swollen legs indicated a
kidney disfunction and the doctor gave her a diuretic. She was
relieved for a time, then relapsed, and was obliged to keep to
her bed for several days at a time. Hulda was a tower of
strength.</p>

<p>The last week of July was hot and dry. The corn shot up
overnight. Its joints creaked like those of a growing boy. The
wheat was nearly ready for cutting and thrashing. Ase drove
around the countryside to arrange for the harvesters. Old
Grimstedt owned the thrashing machine. Each grower of grain paid
a rental for its use. Labor cost nothing, for when the
neighborhood schedule was worked out, every man joined the crew.
Machine and men moved from farm to farm as agreed in advance,
according to the ripening of the grain. The wheat in particular
was stout stuff and could wait a week or two if crops overlapped.
Ase's was the earliest this year. The thrashing would begin with
him the following Monday, move on in midweek to the Wilsons and
make a circuit, ending with Grimstedt himself, whose wheat was
latest of all. Ase drove to Peytonville on Saturday. His weekly
paper, "The Farm Journal," was the only mail in his post office
box. There had been more than time to have an answer from Ben. As
he turned away, the postmaster called him back.</p>

<p>"Just finished sorting a sack, Ase. Here's two letters for
Linden."</p>

<p>Ase's hand trembled. The post office at the rear of Peyton's
store was dark. He took the letters to the light. They were the
two he had sent his brother, one to the Arizona town, the other
to Nevada. Both were stamped, "Unknown." He tore them into small
bits and dropped them in the ashes of the cold stove of the
store. He would do the same when his mother's letter was
returned. She could endure a long time on her hopes and
illusions.</p>

<p>Driving home, hunched over the reins, he himself took hope.
Ben had of course not yet reached Nevada. He was somewhere
between the two states at this moment. It was foolish to have
written him so eagerly when his whereabouts were not known. It
seemed to him that Ben existed not between two states, but
between two worlds. He had a moment's panic in which he thought
he would never find his brother, that he would hang forever
suspended between Arizona and Nevada. He straightened, slapped
the reins over Dan's back. He would write Ben to Nevada again in
October and mark his letter "Please Hold." Whether he had an
answer or no, he would go west in November.</p>

<p>The harvesters' coming had the household in such a bustle that
his brooding went unnoticed. Nellie and Hulda were cooking
feverishly as far ahead as possible. Harvesters' appetites were
proverbial. Because of the heat, meats could not be cooked in
advance, for even the cool stone cellar was subject to the
spoilage of August. Pies and breads, cookies and tarts could be
baked and stored on the cellar shelves. Gallon crocks of baked
beans would keep until Monday. Nellie was a fanatic about cakes
and doughnuts and would make these fresh each day. Ten of the men
lived at a distance and must be put up of nights. The others
would have their breakfasts and late suppers at home and return
there to sleep. There were still two vast meals to be provided
for some twenty-five men for two or three days. Amelia kept
fastidiously away from the kitchen preparations.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Nellie and Hulda made dishpanfuls of potato salad,
pickled eggs, coleslaw and one batch of doughnuts, a washtub
full. Eric had no scruples against Sunday work, as had the
previous hired man. In the afternoon he helped Ase to butcher a
hog and two spring lambs. The dressed carcasses were hung in the
smokehouse. The family ate as sketchily as was possible for
Nellie, not to save food, for there was an abundance, but for
lack of time. Nellie went to bed as early as the children. Eric
and Hulda, untired in the strength of their Swedish youth,
borrowed the second-best buggy to make a Sunday evening visit
home.</p>

<p>Ase went alone to his wheat fields in the long summer
twilight. The wheat ears were so heavy that the stalks bent
toward the ground. He studied the sky. A downpour of rain at this
time would beat the grain to earth. The skies were clear. The
evening star shone golden. He was always anxious for his crops,
not so much for their money value, as because they were a part of
him, something like his children. He had brought them into being,
nursed and tended them, and it seemed to him a betrayal of them,
of the land, when they did not thrive. Their failure was his
failure. He thought of Nat. Somehow, he was failing with him, and
he could not put his finger on the reasons. Arent was a mild boy,
perhaps too mild, and gave no trouble. He followed Nat like a
puppy. 'Melie was merely a little girl, except that now and then
her black eyes, so like Amelia's, flashed with her grandmother's
temper.</p>

<p>He cupped a bundle of wheat heads in his big hands, testing
their weight. He should have an enormous yield. Wheat prices had
not as yet been quoted. For the first time, he was concerned to
make as much money as possible. He would need a considerable sum
to make his autumn trek, not knowing what he would find at the
end of it. He stood waist deep in the wheat, tall and brooding, a
gaunt lonely figure like a scarecrow in the twilight.</p>

<p>He was up at three in the morning to do his chores. The summer
world was dark and hushed. The cows rose lumbering to their feet,
lowed softly in protest at being roused for milking. The horses
in pasture snorted at sight of the lantern flickering so early in
the morning, galloped to the fence to investigate. Streaks of
bronze were showing at the east when the threshers began to
arrive. There was a commotion of greetings, of questions, for the
entire neighborhood met only a few times a year. Teams were
unhitched, the horses turned into pasture, except for a mare who
had gone lame on the way and was rubbed down and stabled.
Grimstedt arrived with his two surly sons and the threshing
machine. They began to tinker with it. A large pile of chunk wood
was heaped ready for its firing. Eric with a helper drove an open
wagon to the lake to fill barrels for the machine's boiler. Ase
kept his own horse-drawn reaper. He hitched up Moll and Toby.
Moll was old, but Ase avoided using Prince the carriage horse for
heavy work except in an emergency. He enjoyed keeping Prince
sleek and round for Nellie's driving.</p>

<p>The dawn sky turned rosy, there was enough light to begin the
reaping. Ase turned the team into the wheat field and released a
lever. The gears ground, the knives clicked, a wide swathe opened
behind a tawny road through a golden sea. The bundlers followed
on foot, gathering the sheaves and stacking them. The sun was
above the horizon and Ase had made his second turn when he heard
the threshing machine make its sputtering starts. It spit and
stopped, spit and stopped. Jim Wilson's crew began loading the
sheaves of wheat on the hay rick. The threshing machine caught
with roar, the steam whistled, the chugging settled down to a
steady rhythm. For an hour Ase cut his swathes, the bundlers
stacked, the loads of sheaves were taken to the busy maw of the
threshing machine, the chaff blew far and wide, the tall funnel
poured out its stream of shining grain.</p>

<p>There was an irregular puffing and the machine stopped dead.
There were cries of "Breakdown! Breakdown!" Men with a mechanical
bent or interest, or those always ready for a halt in work,
hurried to join the Grimstedts. Ase remembered that he had eaten
no breakfast. He tied the team loosely to the fence and joined
the group to ask the seriousness of the machine's failure. It
would take half an hour or so, they agreed, to make repairs. He
started for the house. Tim McCarthy joined him. In the confusion
at daybreak Ase had not seen him arrive.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I'm going for breakfast. Hadn't got around to
it."</p>

<p>Tim chuckled.</p>

<p>"I'd of got around to mine," he said, "but the Boss' wife
isn't the one for rising in the darkness. I'll be ready for the
Nellie's fine dinner, and no joking."</p>

<p>"Come go with me, then."</p>

<p>"And gladly. A belly's a poor thing for work and it
empty."</p>

<p>The little man looked peaked and old. Ase wished again that he
had Tim under his wing. It was a sorry housewife who would send
the hired man off to a day's threshing without his breakfast.
Nellie frowned at sight of Tim.</p>

<p>She said, "You'll have to take what I can scrape up in a
hurry. I've just got the kids fed and out of the house and now
your mother wants a tray in her room."</p>

<p>Hulda said from the stove, "You go on wit' the tray, Missus
Linden. It take me yiffy fix two men only."</p>

<p>She pulled the griddle to the front of the range and stoked
the firebox.</p>

<p>"Kids finish op oatmeal, but I stuff you wit' panny-cakes so
you run over."</p>

<p>Tim said, "Ah, my beautiful Hulda. Now if you'll be laying me
a pretty tray, too, with a posy on it, and be serving me in the
front room, whilst I watch the others stirring."</p>

<p>She giggled.</p>

<p>"Get along wit' you, Mister Tim."</p>

<p>Nellie plopped the teapot on Amelia's tray and trotted off
with it.</p>

<p>Hulda said, "No dis-respect, Mr. Linden, but t'reshing day,
would t'ink dat old one could come to table."</p>

<p>She ladled spoonfuls of pancake batter on the smoking griddle.
Bacon sizzled in a skillet. Strong coffee simmered to greater
strength at the back of the stove. She poured big china cups of
it, set down a pitcher of thick yellow cream and one of maple
syrup, a fresh pat of butter, and served the first stacks of
cakes. She kept baking and turning and serving until a wheeze
from the threshing machine told of work ready to go forward
again. Ase and Tim hurried back.</p>

<p>Tim said, "A man cannot live by bread alone, 'tis true, but
he'd not need much else than Nellie's pancakes and syrup."</p>

<p>He added, "And the Hulda not begrudging of the batter and the
baking."</p>

<p>Ase wondered if Tim had noticed Nellie's trace of a frown.</p>

<p>The threshing machine puffed steadily all morning. Eric kept
the boiler filled, the huge pile of wood diminished, Nat, with
Arent dogging him, carried buckets of spring water to the
harvesters for drinking, machine and men sweat and thirsted and
drank, and among them poured the vast flow of wheat onto the barn
floor swept and scrubbed to receive it. The sun was high. The men
were hot and prickling. The chaff filled their hair, their ears,
and crept down their backs and chests from open shirts. The work
was slowing. The iron dinner bell above the carriage shed rang
out over the fields and barns, falteringly at first, as Hulda
gripped the heavy Manila rope, then strong and welcoming, sweeter
than any church bell. The men whooped and dropped their various
tasks. The threshing machine coughed and stopped. The harvesters
trooped to the house, to the outside wash bench, laying back
their shirts to the waist to be rid of some of the chaff, taking
turns at the two water basins and the roller towel, combing wet
hair. Ase was the last to arrive, because of stabling and
watering his horses, pitching down hay to the stalls for a noon
meal for them, too.</p>

<p>The harvest hands were seated at the dining-room table,
stretched out to its last extension leaf. The table was piled
with foods more thickly than at Christmas. Nellie and Hulda
bustled back and forth with hot dishes. Manners were of no
importance, and men reached across the table to spear pieces of
crusty fried chicken, lamb and pork chops, to scoop up helpings
of baked beans and stewed tomatoes. They wolfed down the food
without speaking. Nellie and Hulda replaced empty dishes with
full ones, kept the biscuits coming, made room on the table for
the salads, the cucumbers and sweet onions sliced in vinegar, the
quivering jellies and the pickles. The famished stomachs were a
little appeased, the men insisted they did not need clean plates
for the desserts, for they had already cleaned them, they roared
with laughter, but Nellie, fastidious, ordered Hulda to remove
the used plates and bring fresh ones while she loaded the table
once again with manifold sweets.</p>

<p>It was a time of pride in a season of abundance, and apple
dumplings and blackberry puddings and wild raspberry shortcakes
jostled the pies and the layer cakes for attention. The block of
lake ice from the sawdust of the ice-house was chipped into more
iced tea, more coffee was poured, the greediest man of all could
hold no more, and the table was bare.</p>

<p>The cry went up, "Clean the table and kiss the cook!"</p>

<p>Ase remembered the first few years of their marriage, when
Nellie relished the ceremony. He was pleased by her popularity
with the men, by her fast growing reputation as the best cook in
the township, but he did not enjoy the rough handling of her by a
couple of dozens of sweating, shouting harvesters. Today, she had
made her preparations. Before the first man could leave the table
to seize her, she rushed in a heaped platter of hot apple
fritters, Hulda tittering behind her with pitchers of maple
syrup. The men groaned.</p>

<p>"No fair, Nellie! No fair! We ate the table clean."</p>

<p>"Clean this up and see if you still feel like kissing."</p>

<p>The fritters were feather-light and delicious, but although
Fatty Edmons managed four, a dozen remained on the platter. The
harvesters accepted their defeat. They patted their stomachs and
groaned again. They wandered out of doors to pick their teeth and
smoke and stretch their legs. Hulda's strong back was wet with
sweat. Nellie mopped her flushed face. Ase offered to help clear
the table and was refused. He saw his mother peer from her room,
then mince to the table. She laid a fresh napkin at her place
over the ruined damask cloth and waited for Nellie and Hulda to
bring plates and food for the three women.</p>

<p>"Oh dear," she said, "those pigs have eaten all the chicken
livers."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I saved some back for you, Mother Linden.
Here."</p>

<p>Ase joined the men at their brief rest. They were as anxious
as he to have his threshing over and done with, if the community
schedule was to be maintained. They went back to their work. The
threshing machine broke down once again in the afternoon, but
nearly a third of the wheat fields lay shorn. It was agreed that
by working later than had been planned, the threshing could be
finished in two more days.</p>

<p>Ase sent Nat with word to Nellie to hold up the supper. Toward
sunset the men stopped, hot, exhausted, and inclined to be
quarrelsome. It had been a hard fourteen-hour day.</p>

<p>The spring-fed lake a quarter mile away was irresistible, for
all their fatigue. They stumbled to its grassy bank, stripped off
their clothing, and plunged in. The crystal water was ice cold,
the shock almost unbearable for a few moments. The men who could
not swim splashed from a shallow rock ledge. The others swam
about with a certain bravado, for the bodies of three men and a
boy who had once drowned there had never been found. Hank Wilson
soon returned to shore.</p>

<p>He said, "They say drowning's quick and easy, but I always
planned on a real nice funeral, and that's not possible without
the corpse."</p>

<p>Only Tim McCarthy dared not go into the reviving waters. He
busied himself with rinsing out the men's sweaty and chaff-filled
shirts.</p>

<p>"They're wet anyhow," he called. "I'll be making them a clean
wet."</p>

<p>The harvesters pulled them on gratefully. The heat of the
evening had them nearly dry by the time they reached the Linden
house and sat down to the supper table. Even those who lived
nearby remained to eat, as their womenfolk would not be prepared
to serve them, so late, anything more than a snack. Except for
coffee, the supper was of cold dishes. These were ample and
tasty, but the men were too tired to eat with their midday
appetite.</p>

<p>The threshing machine hit its stride and the job was finished
on the third day without interruptions. The Wilsons were next on
the list. In helping there, and at the Elkton farms beyond, Ase
and Eric were able to keep up with their own home chores night
and morning. After that, the distances were too great for going
back and forth each day. Most households had boys old enough to
leave behind to feed the stock, do the milking, and bring in wood
for cooking. Tim McCarthy had given out completely on the second
day of Ase's threshing. Even Nellie and Amelia were relieved to
have him stay at the place for the two weeks that Ase and Eric
were obliged to be away. Stove wood was no problem, for the
woodshed adjoining Nellie's kitchen was stacked to the rafters.
Tim could manage the milking and the care of the stock. Ase drove
away well pleased. His wheat yield was enormous. His week's "Farm
Journal" quoted the price as two dollars a bushel. Aside from the
other cash crops, there was already money in sight for his trip
before the snow flew. He believed as well that gentle little
McCarthy would ingratiate himself in the meantime with Nellie and
Amelia. He could not give up his hope of having the old man with
him in his few years remaining.</p>

<p>Rain threatened over the first weekend and all hands worked
through Sunday, so that Ase was not able to return home. When he
reached there the following Saturday night, he found that Nellie
in her exhaustion had come close to losing her child. She was on
her feet again, but thin and pale, with blue circles under her
eyes. He was disturbed that she had not sent word to him.</p>

<p>"Nothing you could have done," she said. "A man can't walk out
on his neighbors' threshing just because his wife has to take to
the bed."</p>

<p>The code was indeed rigid, yet he knew he would have risked
community displeasure to be with her in her illness.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now," she said. "Pull up that long face. You
look as if your pants were falling down."</p>

<p>The most important job of the moment was to haul his wheat to
market while the price was still high. If the crop in general had
been heavy, the market would soon drop. He made five trips to
Trent, twenty miles away, with the loaded wagon. Usually Nellie
enjoyed going with him on his business but she dared not risk the
jouncing of the springboard. Several miles of the journey were
over an ancient plank road. The wheat brought two and a quarter a
bushel because of its quality. His strongbox was crammed with
good green bills. He counted the money again and locked the box.
The baby was due in late December or early January. He decided to
leave early in November, regardless of weather, to wait if
necessary for Ben's arrival in Nevada, so that he might have
plenty of time to return home for the birthing.</p>

<p>The dried beans on the vines had been ready for gathering and
shelling for market some two weeks, but lack of rain had kept
them safe. Eric copied a hand-turned shelling machine he had
seen. The beans were gathered, shelled and sacked. These too
brought a good price in Trent. The vines made fine winter fodder
for the cows and sheep.</p>

<p>August burned itself out. A light frost in September touched
the potato blossoms. The potatoes were not as large as a little
longer growing would have made them, but it seemed best to dig
them at once for fear of heavier frost. A soaking rain on top of
that, as often came this time of year, would rot them almost
overnight. Ase put down a generous supply in the root-cellar for
the family and sold the bulk easily in Peytonville. The town folk
usually had small vegetable gardens of their own but seldom used
space for items like potatoes.</p>

<p>His buckwheat, barley and oats crops were not unduly large. He
and Eric threshed these by hand on the barn floor. He made
several trips to the miller at Burney's Dam to have wheat and
buckwheat ground into flour for the year's use, paying a tenth in
grain for the stone-ground milling. The last trip was with three
sacks of buckwheat. These would fit into the back of the
rubber-tired buggy, and Nellie rode with him on a crisp September
day.</p>

<p>The sumac was red, a few maple leaves were turning, the
hawthorne berries in the hedgerow winked like bright eyes. Nuts
were plentiful. Not yet ripened, the squirrels were already
eating them wastefully. Their chatter rattled over the chirping
of birds. There were no signs of migration. Nellie drew long
breaths of the clear air. Her eyes brightened. She made a note of
the thickest clusters of wild grapes for later gathering. She was
herself once more. The good early days were with them again, when
she had ridden so often with him, often snuggled close against
him. He put his free arm around her. There had been little of
love, between his fatigue and her illness.</p>

<p>She prattled to the miller and asked for a closer grinding of
the buckwheat. She watched the great mill wheel roll over and
over, spilling its load of water to foam away into the pool
beneath. She dropped in leaves to see them spin. She tasted the
raw buckwheat flour, still warm from the crushing mill stones.
She was little Nellie Wilson, and it was as though their children
had never been, no memory of all the household toil and cares. On
the way home, she pointed out the grapes.</p>

<p>She said, "Now this winter you can just get out in the woods
and kill me some game to go with wild grape jelly. We haven't had
either for two years."</p>

<p>Amelia was pouting at the length of their absence. She was
fond of Nat, but she made it plain that the care of the two
younger children for even a few hours was martyrdom.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Oh hush, Mother Linden. I'm going to make apple
cobbler just for you."</p>

<p>The corn matured, the shocks stood like tepees in the field,
the pumpkins were enormous around them, the Hubbard squash big
and noduled and firm. Squash, pumpkins, turnips, beets and
carrots went to the root-cellar. Cabbage was shredded and put
down in five-gallon crocks to make sauerkraut, made into a
relish, stuffed inside green peppers put down in herb-seasoned
cider vinegar. Popcorn was hung in bunches festooned on strings
on the upper floor of the carriage house. Hogs were butchered,
lard and sausage made, hams and bacons hung in the brick
smokehouse over slow hickory coals. Nuts were gathered, hickory,
hazel, black walnut, beech and butternut. They lay in piles under
the popcorn to make a delight of winter evenings before the
fire.</p>

<p>The apple trees were loaded. Long keeping varieties were
stored in barrels in the cellar. Nellie made crock after crock of
spiced apple butter, put up canned apple sauce and apples
quartered in thick sugar syrup. Ase pressed cider for immediate
drinking and for gifts, set away a barrel to turn hard and potent
for winter entertainment. The rest of the crop sold like hotcakes
in Peytonville. Ase and Eric cut cord on cord of wood. Hay mow,
grain bins, smokehouses, pantry, larder, cellar and root-cellar
were overflowing with food for all, until the earth's rotation
should bring another season of growing things.</p>

<p>Eric drew his summer's pay and Ase added twenty dollars extra
by way of thanks and good measure. They shook hands gravely at
parting. October was over and done, the more anxious birds were
winging south, ducks and geese stopped for rest and feeding in
the marshes beyond the willow-bordered stream. The poplar trees
were last to loose their leaves. They quivered in anguish above
the yellow piles that blew here and there in the harsh November
wind.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The earth was stricken. The out-cropping granite in the bare
pasture was the bones of the earth gnawed clean by the wolfish
winds. Maples and oaks, hickories and willows were shivering
skeletons. Pines and hemlocks were black and ominous against the
gray November sky. Crows stretched evil wings on the ridgepole of
the sheep-shed, waiting for a lamb to die. No snow had fallen to
hide the nakedness of the year's old age. The sprouts of young
winter wheat shrank in the cold, would die if not soon covered
with the white protective blanket. Smoke from the Linden chimneys
was torn as it lifted, scattered like ash across the low scudding
clouds.</p>

<p>Ase was two weeks late in preparing to leave for Nevada.
Nellie, monstrously swollen of legs, had been ill and delirious.
She recovered, was cheerfully up and about again, insisted that
he be on his way. Then Tim McCarthy, who was to take over the
chores in Ase's absence, had overlapped with a return of his
chest ailment and scarcely escaped pneumonia. Tim appeared,
shaken and coughing, with his green flowered carpetbag, ready and
able, he swore, to free his friend for the journey. Ase packed
his father's old Gladstone with the few belongings he would need,
his second best suit, extra shirts and woolen underwear,
handkerchiefs, razor, comb and toothbrush. He now planned to
spend no more than two days with Ben, whatever the circumstances
in which he found him. Tim had followed him to the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Supposing the Benjamin is not yet come when you get
there?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that. I daren't leave Nellie long too close
to her time. I'll leave a letter and money with the Sheriff, give
him something for himself to watch out for Ben. Sometimes I think
Ben doesn't go to the post office at all."</p>

<p>"No answer to your last letter?"</p>

<p>Ase shook his head.</p>

<p>"Supposing the Nellie is took before you're back?"</p>

<p>"I've spoken for Aunt Jess. She'll come the middle of December
anyway, ahead of time."</p>

<p>"That relieves me. I've done many the strange thing in me day,
but bringing childer isn't after being one of them."</p>

<p>Ase smiled at his friend.</p>

<p>"I'll only be gone through the first week in December. You've
got Hulda. And my mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, your mother is giving no thought at all to the new life
coming. Her mind is far away in Nevada. She's fair daft, looking
for you to bring back her Benny under your arm like a lost
lamb."</p>

<p>They went down the stairs together. Hulda's voice split the
air with a scream.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden!"</p>

<p>Hulda was clumsy and had probably managed to scald herself
again.</p>

<p>Amelia snapped, "Hush that hysterical Swede."</p>

<p>Ase and Tim hurried to the kitchen. Nellie lay on the floor.
Her eyes were rolled back in her head. There was evidence of dire
things occurring. Hulda began to sob.</p>

<p>"It happened just that quick, Mr. Linden. What's to do?"</p>

<p>Ase lifted Nellie in his arms and stumbled to the back
downstairs bedroom. She moaned and arched herself on the bed.
Amelia peered in wide-eyed and ran to shut herself in her own
room.</p>

<p>Ase called, "Tim! Hitch up Prince to the light buggy."</p>

<p>"Will I go then for the midwife?"</p>

<p>"Later. The new doctor in Peytonville. Bring him with you. Use
the whip on Prince both ways."</p>

<p>Tim dragged on his coat and ran.</p>

<p>Ase fumbled to undress Nellie. Her body was shaking and he
pulled a down coverlet over her.</p>

<p>"Hulda!"</p>

<p>The girl came, wiping her eyes with her apron. He said, "She
seems cold. Do you think hot cloths on her stomach?"</p>

<p>She recovered herself. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm t'inkin' hot is wrong. Ice more likely, to stop
t'ings."</p>

<p>Her judgment was probably better than his own. He nodded. She
hurried to the ice house with pan and pick. Ase sat on the side
of the bed. He chafed Nellie's numb hands between his own until
they lost their blueness. He took her small feet in his lap and
rubbed them until they no longer seemed made of marble. She
roused and cried out in pain. Hulda's towel filled with crushed
ice seemed cruel, but he laid it across Nellie's lower abdomen
and drew the coverlet close around her neck. He stroked her hair.
She opened her eyes and looked at him wildly. Her eyes were like
those of a mare he had once lost in her foaling.</p>

<p>He said, "The doctor's coming. Easy now, easy."</p>

<p>His voice was soothing, as when he spoke to his animals. She
twisted in a convulsion and then another. He was wracked with
her, his intestines were adders striking. He felt a vast nameless
guilt. She would surely die if the doctor did not come soon,
perhaps in any case she would die, and he himself could not help
her, could only hold tight to her hands, straighten her legs when
a convulsion had passed, smooth back her damp hair. He was a man
to whom physical pain was as natural, as accepted, as wind and
snow. His own scythe, glancing off a hidden boulder, had once
sliced him to the bone; he had lain again for hours with a
crushed shoulder under a dead-fall; the pain was severe. These
things were nothing. He raged with a helpless fury that this
strange agony should come to Nellie because of his love.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. Tim had been gone an hour. Prince
under the whip should have covered the road by now. Perhaps the
doctor was miles in the country in another direction, tending
some other woman in distress, and if so, would he be able to make
a choice of duty, would Tim be able to tell him of Nellie's
rareness, that because she was Nellie, she must not die? He heard
quick hoofbeats over the wooden bridge, the rattling of light
wheels. Tim turned the buggy into the driveway. Ase knew a
moment's surprise and relief that the man who jumped down with a
black bag in his hand was middle-aged. Because the doctor in the
small town was new, Ase had assumed he would be a youngster fresh
from training.</p>

<p>Tim spoke from the door, "I've winded Prince. I'll change to
the mare to go for the woman."</p>

<p>Ase nodded to the doctor in greeting. He led him in to the
bedroom. He retired outside the door during the examination.</p>

<p>"When did this begin, Mr. Linden? Has she had trouble with the
pregnancy from the beginning?"</p>

<p>Ase gave his information briefly.</p>

<p>"This is extremely serious, Mr. Linden. The child will come of
itself within a day or two, but we can't wait. Have I your
permission to take it, to save the mother? It will probably be
impossible to bring it alive."</p>

<p>Ase stared. It was a miracle that the man was here, since he
did not understand about Nellie.</p>

<p>The doctor said impatiently, "I can't answer for the woman's
life if you choose to wait for a normal birth. I can't answer for
it anyway. The kidney affection causing the convulsions has gone
far."</p>

<p>"Why," Ase said, "nothing matters but my wife. Nothing at
all."</p>

<p>"Good. Send me the girl from the kitchen."</p>

<p>The doctor gave rapid orders to Hulda. She was stolid again,
braced to be of all possible help. The bedroom door closed
against Ase. He sank into the sleepy hollow chair by the bay
window. He put his hands on his bony knees and looked unseeing
over the bleak fields. Tim drove in with Aunt Jess. She spoke,
threw off her coat and bonnet, whipped a large white coverall
apron from her bag and washed her hands. She went through the
ominous door and shut it quietly behind her.</p>

<p>Ase heard the occasional murmur of her voice, of the doctor's.
When screams came from Nellie, so different from her stoicism in
childbirth, they tore like claws through his mind and flesh. He
stepped outside the house, through the garden gate, wandered
blindly up and down the dead brown rows, until he was more
frightened to stay away than to listen. There was only silence
when he entered the house again. The door was still closed. He
heard Aunt Jess' heavy feet scuff across the bedroom carpet. He
heard her speak with excitement. He heard the doctor's answer.
"Do what you can. I've got my hands full. This is nip and
tuck."</p>

<p>Ase dropped into the sleepy hollow chair. His legs would not
hold him up. He bowed his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"God, help her, save her."</p>

<p>A gust of wind rattled the shutters, blew a whorl of smoke
backward down the chimney and into the room. His answer was the
November wind. He was presumptuous in his prayer. Who knew better
than he that a man and his beloved, one man and one woman, were
one mated pair among uncounted millions of all the animal
world?</p>

<p>There was life, the mysteriously held together molecules,
turbulent within themselves, in the very leaves of a tree, and
the leaves fell and withered and were blown away, of as much or
little consequence, as he and Nellie. They were all too tightly
bound together, men and women, creatures wild and tame, flowers,
fruits and leaves, to ask that any one be spared. As long as the
whole continued, the earth could go about its business. And if
the sun's work was one day done and the earth cooled to
desolation and all its folk and foliage with it, somewhere on or
in or among other suns and earths and stars, the life pulse would
continue, indestructible, eternal, the Life to which men gave the
name of God. Of this he was certain. He was not comforted. This
was Nellie.</p>

<p>He stood up and stared out of the window. The bedroom door
opened. Aunt Jess called to Hulda for a soft blanket warmed in
the oven. An hour passed. The midwife joined him.</p>

<p>She said, "Ase, the baby's alive. Six weeks early, isn't it? A
little girl, no bigger than a rabbit, but well formed. I think
she'll pull through. Soon as Dr. Holder knows what else he needs
from his office, you or Tim must go to town. We'll want nursing
bottles and nipples."</p>

<p>The living baby had no reality. His sunken eyes questioned
her.</p>

<p>She said gently, "Don't ask me about Nellie. We don't know.
That's a good man in there, best I ever worked with. Something
queer about him, though."</p>

<p>At noon Dr. Holder left the bedroom. He gave Ase a list of
needed items. He ate Hulda's meal quickly and with abstraction.
Ase could not swallow. He longed for the activity of the drive to
Peytonville but dared not leave the house. He sent Tim off on the
errands. The afternoon passed and the evening. Dr. Holder asked
for a cot to be put for him in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Can I see her?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"Better not. She wouldn't know you anyway."</p>

<p>Hulda returned from Amelia's room with her emptied supper
tray. His mother had not appeared all day. He wanted to ask her
to move upstairs so that Aunt Jess might be near at hand. He had
hoped she would make the offer herself.</p>

<p>Aunt Jess said, "Ase, I can use the couch in the
living-room."</p>

<p>He was unwilling to be upstairs out of sight and call of that
closed door.</p>

<p>He said, "I won't be sleeping. You go upstairs and get some
rest. I'll call you when you're needed."</p>

<p>The couch was as poor a fit for his length as for Aunt Jess'
breadth. He stoked the round-bellied stove and sat all night by
the light of its red glow. Dr. Holder called twice for Aunt Jess.
The morning came gray as ashes, the wind veered and turned to a
gale. Tim McCarthy helped with the chores. The doctor joined them
for a silent breakfast. Amelia appeared.</p>

<p>She said brightly, "I hope I won't be in the way now. Is
everything all over, everyone all right?"</p>

<p>The doctor stared at her.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Excuse me, Dr. Holder, this is my mother."</p>

<p>Amelia inclined her head. The doctor finished his study of her
and made no answer to her question. He lifted his coffee cup to
his mouth.</p>

<p>She said, "Well, a boy or a girl? Naturally, a grandmother is
a little curious."</p>

<p>Aunt Jess said bluntly, "A premature rag of a baby girl, still
breathing, but Nellie scarcely."</p>

<p>"Why, that's not like Nellie. She usually has her children as
easily as a cat. All prettied up in lace and ribbon an hour
after."</p>

<p>The doctor slammed down his cup and went back to the bedroom.
Aunt Jess followed. Tim kept his eyes on his plate. Ase watched
his mother's bland face. He could not conceive of what thoughts
lay behind it. Surely, if she still nourished a secret hate for
Nellie, she could not think of losing her with indifference, if
for no other reason than that she would never consider the care
of orphaned children. Amelia ate heartily, chatting at
random.</p>

<p>She said, "This will be quite an expense, Asahel. How long do
you plan to have this doctor stay?"</p>

<p>"As long as he's needed, if he will."</p>

<p>"Didn't he give you any idea?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he doesn't know, himself."</p>

<p>Tim left the table abruptly.</p>

<p>He said, "Ase, I'll be up in the carriage shed cleaning
harness. Call me for anything."</p>

<p>The day was as long as a week. Dr. Holder appeared for
snatches of food and coffee and once went out of doors to walk
around and around the house, deep in thought. There was indeed
something strange about him. He was a gaunt dark man, almost as
silent as Ase. His black hair was streaked with gray. His eyes
were deep-sunk and haunted. There were pouches under his eyes
that seemed of more than fatigue. His face was seamed and of a
gray-green color. His long delicate fingers twitched constantly.
He offered no information on his patient and Ase understood that
it was of no use to ask. The alien physician was fighting as
grimly for Nellie's life as though he treasured her as greatly as
her husband.</p>

<p>On the third day he had Ase send Tim to Peytonville for fresh
personal linen.</p>

<p>He sent as well the message, "Tell my housekeeper to turn
everyone away."</p>

<p>The days went by in a slow nightmare. There were scurryings in
the bedroom when the battle was close and fierce. Dr. Holder
permitted Ase to go once into the bedroom. Nellie lay in a
drugged sleep. Her small face was as sharp and bony as that of a
fox. Her opened lips were blue. Her faint breath came
irregularly, seeming more like sighs. Aunt Jess drew a cover back
from the cradle and showed him the child. It too was blue, so
tiny and fragile that he dared not touch it. He stumbled out of
the room.</p>

<p>On the eighth day Holder came to him.</p>

<p>"We've made it. She'll come through."</p>

<p>Ase noticed his mother beckoning to the doctor. They were in
conversation only a few minutes. He heard the staccato voice like
icy hail against Amelia's low smooth speech. She dismissed Holder
and called Ase to her.</p>

<p>"My dear Asahel, you are so secretive. But I got it out of
that disagreeable man that he expects Nellie to recover, as of
course I have known all along. However, it does seem that she
will be ailing for some time to come. Surely, you are not still
planning to leave her to go to Nevada."</p>

<p>"Why, no. I put that out of my mind the first day."</p>

<p>"I assumed so. And of course your duty is here. Mine is
otherwise. If you will kindly give me the money you expected to
use, McCarthy can drive me to the westbound train this evening.
Benjamin will come home with his mother where he would only laugh
at you."</p>

<p>This, then, was behind her indifference to Nellie's living or
dying. Nellie's danger had been for her a God-given opportunity.
His shoulders sagged under an almost intolerable burden.</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, it's a long difficult journey, with many
waits and changes. We don't even know whether Ben is there, or
will be."</p>

<p>She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"How will we ever find out if someone doesn't go? I should
always have been the one to do it. Get me the money."</p>

<p>He brought the cash box and counted out for her more than he
had planned to take himself. He made up a separate envelope.</p>

<p>"This is to leave with the local sheriff for Ben if he shows
up later."</p>

<p>"I shall wait until he does show up. Benjamin would never have
given anyone a definite address if he hadn't meant to go there.
But I'll take the extra money for him."</p>

<p>Her luggage, he saw, was packed already. He understood that
nothing Holder said would have mattered, nothing would have
stopped her. He marveled that she had restrained herself so many
days. He saw her off in the buggy with a deep anxiety for her, an
aging obsessed woman going alone into a rude land. He recognized
her necessity and admitted to himself his relief. Nellie could
convalesce in peace.</p>

<p>Dr. Holder announced that it was safe to leave Nellie in the
hands of Aunt Jess. He would call every few days in his own rig.
He must be sent for if there was a relapse. The man's manner was
exuberant. Ase brought out his cash box.</p>

<p>He asked, "What do I owe you, Sir?"</p>

<p>The thought was between them that the services for so many
days, day and night, ignoring other patients, could scarcely have
a price set on them. Holder named a figure that was high, yet
under the circumstances, entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>He said, "If you can afford it, Linden. Otherwise, whatever
you wish to pay. Or nothing at all."</p>

<p>Ase opened the box and counted out the bills.</p>

<p>"I should give you everything I have."</p>

<p>"It was one of my successes, yes. It makes up to me for some
of my failures."</p>

<p>The man frowned. He held out his hand. Ase shook it
warmly.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you. I guess you
understood--Nellie--."</p>

<p>His voice broke.</p>

<p>Holder said, "I assure you I had no sentiment about it. It
happened to be a challenge to me."</p>

<p>Ase watched after him in the buggy beside McCarthy. Aunt Jess
joined him at the window.</p>

<p>"I should have known at the first," she said. "It's drink. He
began on it this morning."</p>

<p>Ase was startled.</p>

<p>"Was he drinking while he was working with Nellie?"</p>

<p>"By the grace of Heaven, no, or you'd have no Nellie now. He
was nearly crazy, times, without it, but I didn't realize. He was
man enough to stick it out until he'd finished his job."</p>

<p>The whole man was suddenly explained. He had been obliged,
driven by others or by himself, to begin a new life in a small
village, far from his sources and his roots. Ase could not guess
what tragedy Holder might have brought some other man's wife,
losing her in his cups, as he might have lost Nellie. Ase
shuddered. He felt at the same time a vast pity for the man,
wondering what had turned him to his desperate escape.</p>

<p>In spite of his promise, Holder did not call in the next week.
Nellie thrived and had no need of him. Aunt Jess propped her up
with pillows, brushed and combed her curls, was able to give her
the first thorough bathing. Nellie began to have a little
appetite, and Hulda, delighted, turned to the making of creamy
custards and rich egg dishes. Ase could scarcely bear to leave
the bedside. He sat for hours in silence, devouring the sight of
her, holding her thin hand until she tired and drew it away and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>Aunt Jess devoted much of her time to the tiny baby. Cow's
milk was too strong for the infant's stomach, and the nurse
experimented with water dilution, first with a trace of sugar,
then of mild clover honey, and was not satisfied with the
results. Tim McCarthy was sent to the Svensons for goat's milk,
and this, diluted, proved the answer. The Svensons insisted on
lending the milch goat itself, to save the long trip daily.</p>

<p>The first snow fell, soft and feathery. Nellie was moved into
Amelia's front downstairs bedroom, where Ase kept a fire
crackling on the hearth the clock around.</p>

<p>She asked in wonder, "But Ase, where's your mother?"</p>

<p>"She went to Nevada in my place."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>She smoothed the counterpane. She nodded.</p>

<p>"It will satisfy her better, whether she finds Ben or
not."</p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>She said, "Too bad I'm laid up, with the old girl out of the
way. We had our best times when she was in Indiana. Remember the
night on the couch?"</p>

<p>He was horrified.</p>

<p>"Don't even think of such things, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks. Doc said a mess like this will likely never
happen again. I'm not going to be done out of my fun."</p>

<p>She was ready to see the children, to let them play in her
room and sprawl on the bed, to beg mouthfuls from her special
dishes.</p>

<p>She was able to sit in the sleepy hollow chair by the
living-room stove. Aunt Jess stayed until she was on her feet,
and Hulda had learned the variations of the baby's care and
nursing formula. Ase paid the midwife. His gratitude was
awkwardly spoken but she understood.</p>

<p>"I take no credit for Nellie, but I will say, Ase, you owe the
child to me. Doctor was ready to throw her away like a stillborn
kitten."</p>

<p>He said, "Well name her for you."</p>

<p>"I've never liked the name of 'Jessie'. But let me name her
anyhow. She's such a bit of a china thing, I'd call her
'Dolly.'"</p>

<p>He was pleased. The name was close to "Nellie," which had been
his private choice. The baby showed signs of resembling her
mother, the eyes deep blue, the wisps of hair were
chestnut-colored and curly. Aunt Jess hugged him to her big bosom
and was off, for a bit of rest, she said, before she took another
case. Nellie approved the baby's name.</p>

<p>She said, "I suppose after all this, she'll be rotten
spoiled."</p>

<p>He kept Tim on, and Nellie did not seem to mind or notice. The
old man freed him to spend more time with her. Christmas was
spent quietly. Ase made a trip to Peytonville for gifts and
holiday extras. The Wilsons came with presents but did not stay
for dinner. Nellie had reminded him in time to mail a gift to his
mother in Nevada. They had had only a note from her, telling of
her safe arrival.</p>

<p>In early February the postmaster had a thick letter for Ase
from Amelia. She described the town, only a way-station in the
desert. She was boarding with the station master's wife and while
things were rough and crude, she was comfortable. The days were
hot and sunny, the nights turned sharply cold. There was much
more sky than she was used to. The town was a gathering place for
the silver miners. Benjamin had not yet arrived. She would stay
until spring. He was likely to come with or ahead of the April
rush. She was well. She hoped all was well with the family.</p>

<p>In March she wrote for more money, as she had been obliged to
use the money saved for Benjamin. She had also engaged a man to
go back to several towns between Nevada and Arizona, where
Benjamin might have stopped to work and winter. The miners were
not striking it rich, certainly, but prospects were good, and
Benjamin had perhaps already made his pile, as they called it.
She would need money to pay her scouting messenger. In April she
wrote for money again. The family cash box had shrunken from its
bulging fullness to a few hundred dollars.</p>

<p>At the end of May Amelia stepped unexpectedly out of a
Peytonville hired rig and stalked into the house. Her black eyes
were sunk in their sockets. Her hair was untidy, her black silk
dress rumpled and spotted. She looked like a sick witch. She
jerked her head in greeting, walked into her room and closed the
door.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c21">XXI</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase was awakened by thunder growling in the south. The summer
dawn was scarcely lighter than the night. The air was still and
close. The bedroom was shadowy. Lightning flashed, the polished
highboy leaped into focus, the thunder crashed, the room was dark
again. Nellie was up ahead of him and about her business. He
turned his head toward the east at the next flash and caught a
glimpse of her in the garden, picking the day's fruits and
vegetables ahead of the storm. In the rumbling he did not hear
the opening of the door. There was a soft running sound over the
carpet, a leap like that of a kitten, and Doll was on the bed,
her fingers in his hair, her warm cheek against his.</p>

<p>"Bear hug," she said, and he squeezed her, her own small arms
tight around his long neck.</p>

<p>She was four years old, and every day of her life was a
miracle, for she was fragile as a windflower. She was a tiny
replica of Nellie, with the same blue eyes, the same white skin
and wild rose coloring, with pale curls already turning to
Nellie's darker gold. There was miracle as well in her closeness
to him. She was a fragment of himself. Their edges were raw with
recognition, so that they must constantly be fitted together,
else in the separation there was pain.</p>

<p>She brought her clothing for him to help with her dressing.
Unsteadily, her pink tongue between her lips in concentration,
she put one foot and then the other through the legs of the
diminutive ruffled drawers, was trapped by the doll's bodice and
petticoat, was rescued, sighed and turned her back in a pink
frilled pinafore to be buttoned up. The infinitesimal pearl
buttons slipped from under Ase's big knotted fingers, slid like
mercury away from the buttonholes, he was in a sweat before the
labor of love was finished. He marveled newly at the speed with
which Nellie whisked the children in and out of their
garments.</p>

<p>Doll announced, "Now I'll help you."</p>

<p>This too made for a delicious delay, a great and serious
pretense of helping on with his socks, a reaching on tiptoe to
help fasten the buckles of his overalls, her hands like white
moths against the coarse denim. He swung her to his shoulder and
carried her downstairs. Hulda had breakfast nearly ready. The
amiable Swedish girl was a family fixture now the Lindens had
prospered.</p>

<p>She said, "Best eat before chores, Mr. Linden," but he shook
his head.</p>

<p>He would not relish his breakfast with the creatures waiting,
unmilked, unwatered, unfed. Nellie came in with her overflowing
basket, a ginghamed goddess of plenty.</p>

<p>She said, "Ase, I swear you've fooled around on purpose.
You'll get soaked any minute and I think you like it."</p>

<p>He smiled and kissed the tip of her nose.</p>

<p>Doll said, "Da and I had an awful time to get dressed."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you did. Probably spent half the time hugging. Ase,
for the Lord's sake go on and milk. No, Dolly, you can't go with
him. One of you sopping wet's enough."</p>

<p>The summer storm broke before he was through at the barns. The
rain poured down, a solid deluge, as though a river dam had been
swept away. He came into the woodshed with the foam of the milk
pitted with the rain. The rain pipes were gurgling, the water
rushed noisily into the deep cistern. He was soaked through as
Nellie prophesied, and as she thought, enjoyed it. Nat and Arent
and 'Melie and Nellie laughed at the sight of him, his black hair
plastered to head and neck, water dripping from his long arms,
from nose and chin.</p>

<p>"Send out a man and get back a wet crow," Nellie said.</p>

<p>He took off his jacket, shook it and hung it in the woodshed.
Doll watched over him as he stood by the kitchen range drying his
hands, turning himself around before the heat, Nellie remarked,
like a partridge on a spit.</p>

<p>Because there was a coziness in the dark rain-swept morning,
the family was breakfasting at the kitchen table. A lamp was lit
on the warming oven over the range. They had eaten, but helped
themselves again, for company, while Hulda piled his hot plate
with savory fried ham and eggs and fresh blueberry muffins. The
pot of redolent strong coffee was emptied and Hulda made another.
They dawdled over doughnuts and sugar cookies piled with slabs of
apple blossom honey. Nellie had a notion for a raspberry tart
with her third cup of coffee and the children must then have
tarts, too. Willis, the baby, managed in an unwatched moment to
cover his face and bib with the red jam. Ase, sitting next to his
high chair, made the domestic error of swabbing him with one of
Nellie's linen napkins instead of turning him over to Hulda for
cleaning with a washcloth.</p>

<p>Nellie's sputtering subsided and Ase smiled in reassurance at
the little boy, Willis was not quite two. Nellie had borne him
without the complications Ase feared. He was not fragile, like
Doll, true, but something was lacking in his spirit. He was
quiet, as even Arent had never been, with a gentle smile that
seemed detached and lonely. It was as though Nellie's vitality
had been too much expended on birthing Dolly, or the strength of
Ase's seed had somehow been diluted. Ase yearned over the boy, he
had room for him in his heart along with Dolly, but the child,
smiling with shy courtesy, withdrew. His father could not reach
him.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Hulda, go see if Mother Linden wants anything
more."</p>

<p>The girl giggled.</p>

<p>"Has already eat breakfast like horse. Maybe she eat two
horses. I take more muffins."</p>

<p>"We've all eaten like pigs this morning. I was going to have
the tarts for dinner. Well, I'll make cupcakes."</p>

<p>Among her many famous dishes, one of Nellie's most special was
her cupcakes, for she made them in great variety with the
frostings in a veritable rainbow of coloring and decoration. For
serving, she arranged them on a huge ironstone platter in a
design, then complained that as they were taken one by one, the
platter looked untidy. Ase had begun a private project as
solution that he thought might please her. This was the morning
for finishing the cake tree.</p>

<p>The rain beat against the windowpanes. The garden was a garden
at the bottom of the sea, the feathery carrot tops waved in the
wet grayness like seaweed. The barns across the road were
scarcely visible. The log cabin had been turned over to the
children as a playhouse, where they kept their treasures and
played long games, but Nat decided for them that a dash there
through the rain was not worth while. He had a love of bodily
comfort not quite natural in a healthy boy of twelve. It was
simply that whatever happened to Nat was important, and Nat
preferred not to be wet or cold. His decisions were the last
word, although 'Melie, losing in the end, often battled him in a
temper. This morning, he announced, they would play in the attic.
They would make tents of Nellie's winter quilts and be Indians in
a siege.</p>

<p>"Come on, Doll. You'll be a white child we capture."</p>

<p>She shook her head and slipped her hand in her father's. She
would go with him where he intended to go. Nat scowled, then ran
up the back stairs with a war whoop, Arent and 'Melie behind him.
Nellie sent Hulda to bed-making and sweeping and dusting and
brought out the sacred vessels for her baking. Ase wrapped Dolly
against the weather, put his wet jacket over his head and went
with her across the driveway to the upper floor of the carriage
house. The place was dusky, odorous with hanging harness, piled
nuts and festooned popping corn.</p>

<p>He liked to work with wood. He kept blocks and boards of wild
cherry and black walnut seasoning, maple and poplar, butternut
and pine ready to his hand. There was something of the
satisfaction in carving and joining that he had from the flute.
The intangible came to life, beauty was seen, was heard, no
longer secret under his muteness. The grain of wood pleased him,
the shaded laminations and the whorls. He moved aside an
unfinished cherry table and picked up the sections of Nellie's
cake tree. The problem had been to make it at once delicate and
strong, utilitarian but not grotesque. He had made a previous one
that resembled the skeleton of a toy Christmas tree stripped of
its needles. It would have served its purpose, but its ugliness
disturbed him and he broke it up for kindling. Then in his
encyclopedia he had found his model, a picture of an ancient
candelabrum, many-branched, graceful and aspiring. He copied it
in hard maple, modified it, struggled with the flinty wood where
the slim round arms must make their acute angle. The base was a
disc, smooth and substantial. The central trunk rose from the
center, two feet in height, tapering to a point at its peak. Now
he lit a fire under his glue pot. He fitted the branches into
their proper holes, they extended widely at the bottom, narrowing
toward the top, so that in silhouette the cake tree was a
triangle. Each branch turned upward a few inches from the tip,
the tips were sharply pointed, ready not for candles but for
Nellie's sacramental cupcakes.</p>

<p>Dolly was enchanted. She was in on the secret, the only one of
the children who did not run tattling to Nellie. Ase put away his
tools. The morning had passed in his absorption. He took Doll by
one hand, the cake tree held high in the other, as though he
lifted a light for her path. The rain had stopped without their
noticing. They stood in the driveway and looked to the south. The
hills were the blue of indigo. From the valley rose drifts of
white cloud like smoke from Indian campfires. The drifts rolled
slowly, were torn, vanished above the hemlocks into the
freshening air. A ray of sunlight touched the indigo with a
single silver finger.</p>

<p>Ase and Doll listened at the kitchen door. There was only the
sound of Hulda's humming. They looked inside and motioned to her.
Nellie was talking with the children in the dining-room. Dinner
was ready. Ase whispered and Hulda nodded. She brought the great
platter of cakes to him, chuckling.</p>

<p>Nellie had outdone herself on the frosting of the cupcakes.
There were chocolate icing and white, caramel and peppermint,
cocoanut and lemon. Some of the chocolate were sprinkled with
silver pellets, the white were decorated with red cinnamon drops
or stars of citron, the caramel were indented with halves of
butternuts. Ase and Dolly set them on the smooth sharp points,
the finished pattern a bouquet of flowers. Hulda bobbed her head
from the door.</p>

<p>"Best hurry op, Mr. Linden, or she come, then surprise on
other foot."</p>

<p>They left their handiwork on the milk shelf and joined the
family. Doll was demure, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "What have you two been up to? I was just going
to send Nat to hunt for you," and helped Hulda cover the table
with the smoking dinner dishes.</p>

<p>There was fried chicken, which Nellie did not believe in
saving only for Sundays. There were sweet corn and small new
potatoes, wax beans swimming in butter and cream, hot biscuits
and sliced tomatoes, cucumbers in vinegar with rings of onion,
and the usual assortment of relishes and jelly. The noon of the
day had turned fresh and cool. The white curtains blew from the
open windows. Full sun broke through and streamed across the
damasked table.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Save room for dessert now. Took me all morning
to make it."</p>

<p>Hulda began to clear the table and winked at Ase and Doll.
Nellie followed with a stack of plates and they left the table,
slipping behind her into the woodshed. They heard her shriek.</p>

<p>"My cupcakes are gone! Nat! Did you kids go off with them?
Ase, is this what you and Doll were up to? Having a party in the
barn, I'll bet. Ase, where are you?"</p>

<p>He sent Doll ahead of him with the cake tree, one hand ready
to steady it if she faltered. Nat and Arent and 'Melie had rushed
to the kitchen commotion. They turned and stared and Nellie
stared.</p>

<p>"For the Lord's sake, Ase," she said. "A pretty trick for a
grown man to play."</p>

<p>He felt as foolish as old Shep caught lapping the cats'
milk.</p>

<p>Her calm restored with the cakes, Nellie was delighted with
her gift. She set aside the flowers and placed it in the center
of the dining table beside a bowl of floating island custard. Nat
grabbed the first cake. Little Willis reached out his hands, but
in pleasure, not greed.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Couldn't be nicer, Ase. I like the way you waxed
it so the cakes don't stick. First I've known you had any
imagination."</p>

<p>He was relieved that she had no fault to find. She made their
daily living gay and casual, but her domestic perfectionism
sometimes had him in hot water, along with the children.</p>

<p>Hulda had taken a heaping dinner tray to Amelia's room.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Bring me the rest of the cakes, Hulda, and I'll
fill up the stand again for Mother Linden. She likes things
nice."</p>

<p>Ase looked at her gratefully. His mother's madness was a quiet
thing for the most part, she had only withdrawn farther and
farther into her fantasies, keeping almost entirely to her room.
Nellie insisted that she was only sulking, cutting off her nose
to spite her face. Yet Nellie was all graciousness to the dark
unhappy woman, pampered her in every way.</p>

<p>Young 'Melie said, "I want to take the cake tree to Grandma.
Doll's had her turn carrying it."</p>

<p>Ase was aware of the jealousy of the other children toward
Dolly. It was difficult to account for, since Nellie made no
distinction among them, except for her long accepted preference
for Nat. If his children cared for him, Ase thought, it would be
reasonable for them to resent his absorption in Dolly, but they
were indifferent to him. Perhaps the jealousy was part of their
general avarice, wanting anything and everything for themselves,
as Nat had seized first choice of the decorated cakes. Nellie had
not corrected him, she had been amused. Ase felt he should have
spoken.</p>

<p>The early afternoon was sparkling, tempting all the family out
of doors. The grass was wet, sweet smelling, and Nellie allowed
the children to go barefooted. She watched them curling their
toes over the green blades and suddenly pulled off her own shoes
and stockings. Her hair was loose and in her frilled gingham she
seemed a child among them. 'Melie still played with dolls,
especially when she was at odds with Nat. She disapproved of his
plan now to continue the game of Indians over the hill, for he
and Arent always ended by running away and leaving her. When
Dolly appeared around the corner of the house with the old mother
cat in her arms, 'Melie fetched her doll clothes and doll
carriage and struggled with dressing the tabby and forcing it
under the coverlet. The cat was passive briefly, became annoyed,
yowled and clawed her way out of the cap and dress, and escaped
to the barn in outrage.</p>

<p>Nellie was sitting on the garden gate, swinging her bare
legs.</p>

<p>She called, "Try the baby pig."</p>

<p>A small pink-and-white porker of a recent litter had wandered
across the road from the barn, snuffling the ground of its new
world. Nat captured it and held it while Doll and 'Melie put its
forefeet through the arms of the long doll dress and tied the
strings of the doll bonnet under its snout. Its squeals shrilled
out of murder and the mother sow came grunting on the run. The
sow trotted along the garden fence. It passed the gate and in an
instant Nellie had dropped astride its broad neck. She gripped
the hairy ears and was off on a mad ride across the lawn and down
the road, her plump buttocks thumping up and down. The sow
spilled her off beyond the bean field, where the road began to
dip toward the bridge over the stream. She returned on muddy
feet, her dress stained and torn, pink-cheeked and laughing. The
children rolled on the grass in hysterics and Ase was chuckling,
too. She might easily have hurt herself, but she came unscathed
from all her pranks. She went to the house to change. 'Melie and
Dolly undressed the piglet and turned it loose, for the mother
was to be heard coming again. They agreed to join the boys in the
hay loft and went to the house to put away the dolls while Nat
and Arent went to the attic for the Indian gear. Ase moved Willis
inside the garden gate and brought a hoe to weed the vegetables.
The Linden world was quiet for a few minutes.</p>

<p>It was shattered by shouts and shrieks from the rear of the
house. Ase dropped his hoe and ran. In the woodshed door stood a
suspiciously small tramp. It was dressed in what he recognized as
a pair of boy's overalls and a ragged sweater and wide-brimmed
black hat left behind by Tim McCarthy. The back of its neck was
white but as he came near he saw the face, well sooted with lamp
black. The shoulders were shaking with laughter and the arms were
crossed over the head against the thwacking of a broom in Nat's
hands and a feather duster in 'Melie's.</p>

<p>Nellie gasped, "All right, kids, that's enough. It's me."</p>

<p>Dolly ran to her mother with a cry of anxiety. Nat and Arent
and 'Melie stood gaping, then Nat frowned sullenly, and Arent at
last grinned. They were not so amused this time. Nat could not
endure any joke at his expense. Ase was not amused at all. Nellie
and his mother had taught the children a fear of tramps, who were
plentiful on the roads in summer, and his loaded gun stood in the
woodshed corner. Nat might well have lifted it instead of the
broom. Yet he did not want to make too much of it with his
gravity.</p>

<p>He said, "A pretty trick, Nellie, for a grown woman to
play."</p>

<p>She said, laughing again, wiping her sooty face with an arm of
the sweater, "I never dreamed I'd fool them so. I thought they'd
know me in a minute."</p>

<p>Nat said, "The voice fooled us, Pa. Sounded deep down just
like a man. I'd have known her all right if I'd got the hat
knocked off. It was way down over her face."</p>

<p>She did indeed have an amazing talent for imitation. She had a
talent too in her mischief, so that it was always effective,
where his own attempts at mere "surprises" fell entirely flat. He
would never again make himself foolish with anything like the
cake tree. She took over the cooking of supper from Hulda. She
was still restless, and he knew that he would be allowed little
sleep this night. Her intensity built up like a volcano, she
expended a portion on her pranks, and was left still boiling. She
would be calmer again tomorrow. He was conscious of a slight
dread shadowing the pleasure of his anticipation. He could never
accustom himself to the loneliness that swept over him when she
turned afterward away from him.</p>

<p>The family was tired from the day of play. Even Nat went to
bed early without protest. Dolly came to Ase to say goodnight.
She clung to him, her lips like a butterfly on his bony face, her
small arms tight around his long neck in a passionate reluctance
to leave him. Her caresses nourished him, it was almost as though
Nellie returned his love.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dolly, still small and fragile, celebrated her sixth birthday.
Nat and Arent and 'Melie were lofty from long experience with
birthdays, but with little Willis held out their plates for
second slices of the cake. Nellie looked over her brood.</p>

<p>She said, "Doll, when you were born, we didn't think we'd ever
raise you."</p>

<p>Nat said, "I remember. She was about as big as a barn rat and
sort of blue. Aunt Jess said she had to breathe down her
throat."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, isn't it funny? Look how things change in
the years. The time jumps like a rabbit. Thinking we'd lose Doll,
and now she's a big girl. You worrying about me, and Willis
making no trouble at all. All of it in jumps. I suppose some day
it'll seem as queer to have grown children as having new
ones."</p>

<p>He was troubled by his feeling about time. It seemed to him
that he had always known that he and Nellie would have children
from their love. He had seen them from babyhood to manhood and
womanhood as a consecutive flow, like the stream that ran from
Pip Lake, under the willow trees and the wooden bridge, to join
Long Lake, to flow in turn to the Meshawk River, which, he knew,
joined other rivers and ran at last to the sea. He stood off at a
distance and saw his remotest ancestors side by side with his
farthest descendants.</p>

<p>He wondered if he had an unnatural point of view. Time for him
was not marked off in jumps, as Nellie expressed it. It was not
clearly marked and definite, it was all one, sometimes relative
but forever whole. All life seemed to him contained in the
beginning and the end, if there had ever been a beginning and if
there would ever be an end. Time was, must be, timeless. As from
a great enough height a landscape would show no detail, so from a
far enough distance all time would be seen to exist
simultaneously. He felt this in his inner mind and spirit.</p>

<p>He ate Doll's birthday cake absent-mindedly. It was six years
now since the terror of her birth and Nellie's danger, almost six
years since Amelia had returned stricken from Nevada with no word
of Ben, since his mother had retired to her room, a living dead
woman.</p>

<p>He said, "Maybe Mother would eat a piece of the cake."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "You'd better take it to her. I thought I'd treat
her yesterday with apple dumpling and she threw it on the
floor."</p>

<p>She cut a slice of cake and laid it on one of the new Haviland
china plates, one of her best linen napkins at the side. Ase went
to his mother's door and rapped.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Asahel, Mother. I have something for you."</p>

<p>Amelia opened the door. He was perpetually shocked at the
sight of her. She kept a certain tidiness, but her hair was
uncombed, her eyes vacant.</p>

<p>"Doll and I wanted you to have a piece of her birthday cake,
Mother. She's six years old today."</p>

<p>"Who's Doll?"</p>

<p>"You remember Dolly, Mother. She was born just before you went
to Nevada, looking for Benjamin."</p>

<p>He was deliberately specific, wanting to shock her back into
reality.</p>

<p>"Nevada? Benjamin? You refer to my son. You and Tim McCarthy
and the gypsies, you're keeping my son Benjamin away from me. He
writes me letters and you hide them."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well, he thought, to leave her alone with
her fantasies. They were harmless. In her darkness, they must be
even of some comfort. He wondered if he dared have someone, Tim
McCarthy possibly, write a letter as though it came from Ben. He
decided against such a deceit. She proved astonishingly shrewd at
times. If she sensed the forgery, her suspicions would be
confirmed. If she accepted it, she might become uncontrollably
hysterical with hope, might demand to set out on another
disastrous search. In any case, the truth had always seemed to
him more vital than happiness.</p>

<p>"Doll, eh?" she said. "Dolly. Yes, I remember. What a silly
name. You stayed behind for her birth, when your duty was to find
your brother. And then you sent me away instead. You hoped to
lose me, too."</p>

<p>It was of no use to remind her of her own insistence on that
fatal journey. Nothing was of any use. She eyed the cake on the
fancy plate.</p>

<p>She said, "I'll have my cake at the table with the family. You
keep me shut up in my room like a prisoner. I've scarcely seen my
youngest grandchildren. This 'Doll' now. I hear, oh, I hear
things, she's your pet. She was your pet before she was born.
This 'Dolly' lost me my Benjamin."</p>

<p>"It was Nellie I stayed behind for. You've forgotten how close
she came to dying."</p>

<p>"Nellie, Dolly, it's all the same. Why do you dote so on the
child?"</p>

<p>He could not speak the truth to this woman, his mother. Doll
was as close to him as his own skin. She lay as deep in him as
his very seed. With her, he felt himself complete, often actually
articulate. He puzzled over this relationship of parent to child,
of human to human, so that one spoke to another with
understanding and in turn was understood. It seemed to have
nothing to do with the blood relation, but only with some spark
that flashed rarely, that said, "You and I together share a
bright secret flame. Perhaps, as one, we may find the answer to
all that torments us and is hidden." It seemed to him that no man
could find it for himself, alone.</p>

<p>He said, "Come, Mother. We all want you to share in Doll's
birthday."</p>

<p>Amelia stood starkly by the festive table.</p>

<p>She said, "Dolly?"</p>

<p>The little girl held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Grandmother, come have a piece of my birthday cake."</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Why, yes. Yes indeed."</p>

<p>She studied the child. She sat down and ate, nibbled, rather,
as though a cannibal found a certain flesh distasteful.</p>

<p>She said, "Nellie, your husband has been cruel enough to
remind me of the circumstances surrounding the girl's birth."</p>

<p>"Now, Mother Linden, be sensible. I knew Ben better than you
did. You were foolish to go out looking for him. He didn't want
to be found. Ben was Ben, he wanted to be on his own. If he wants
to show up here some day, he'll come. Leave him alone."</p>

<p>Amelia rose from the table.</p>

<p>She said, "I will not be outraged in my own house. Never
forget that it is mine."</p>

<p>Her door closed behind her. The subdued children slipped away.
Nellie frowned.</p>

<p>She said, "Your mother keeps harping on her owning the farm.
She's just crazy enough or mean enough to have done something
queer about it. I've made the children be nice to her, so she'd
feel they're her own blood as much as her precious Ben. Lord
knows I've done my best for her. I've often thought what a pretty
pickle she could put us in."</p>

<p>Ase was unwilling to believe that her years of kindness and
patience toward his mother had been a matter of calculation. He
smiled.</p>

<p>"Tim McCarthy said that to me when we were first married,
Nellie. You see, nothing's happened."</p>

<p>"Well, she's getting crazier all the time. You talk to Judge
Simmons. I'm thinking of the children's future. You want to give
them all a good start in life, don't you? Make things easy for
them?"</p>

<p>A good start in life, yes, he thought, if by that was meant
strong bodies and seeking minds, and something else that only
Dolly seemed to have. An easy start for them, no. The two surely
were not the same. He heard and read much these days of giving
the younger generation "advantages" and "opportunities." Where
this concerned a better education, he agreed, with the deep
yearning of his own to know the things he had never known, to
learn not only facts and wisdom, but the truth, and beyond that,
the very nature of truth. Where it seemed to mean a blind leaving
of the farms for the cities, a seeking of less arduous labor, the
going into the businesses and industries that were making great
fortunes, for the sole purpose of making a fortune, he could see
not advantage, but loss.</p>

<p>Yet he would not discourage any of his children if what was
called the new "progressive" America attracted them. Nat
certainly would never make a farmer. In his adolescence he had a
profound distaste for all of the farm life and work that was far
more than a boyish laziness. Nat wanted frankly to make money,
for what reason he could scarcely know. Arent, Ase imagined,
would follow where Nat led, as he had always done. It was too
soon to know about the girls, or about Willis. He felt a certain
panic at the thought of more children, hoped there would be none
to prove as cold and ruthless as Nat, as blindly following as
Arent, as hard and snappish as 'Melie, as aloof as Willis, as
vulnerable, yes, that was it, as vulnerable as Doll. Children
came into the world with characters infinitely more unpredictable
than those of the creatures, from whose breeding and blood lines
much could be prophesied. Well, he thought, that was part of the
glory of human beings, that each was only himself.</p>

<p>Nellie said sharply, "Ase, I asked you a question. You never
listen to me. I say something or ask something and you just sit
dreaming."</p>

<p>It was impossible to explain that her question had started a
long train of thought, the thoughts futile, he must admit. She
was right to call it dreaming.</p>

<p>"Are you going to talk to Judge Simmons?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, Nellie, I'll talk to him. But whatever the law,
we're all right."</p>

<p>"The trouble with you, Ase, you don't have any ambition."</p>

<p>He heard that word often, too, and again, as with "advantages"
and "opportunities," "ambition" seemed to mean the avid desire to
make money for its own sake.</p>

<p>He said mildly, "I guess not. But Nat does, the way you mean
it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so. I've tried hard enough to make him
ambitious. I must say, your mother's always backed me up
there."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I wonder now. Maybe we ought to have Doc see
what he thinks about your mother."</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with her health, Nellie."</p>

<p>"You can bet your boots there isn't. She eats like a horse.
Her mind, I mean. A crazy person's will wouldn't be worth the
paper it was written on."</p>

<p>He stood up from the table. To an extent, he could understand
Nellie's concern. He knew that never, whatever mad or spiteful
act his mother committed, could he quarrel over the disposition
of the Linden land.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c23">XXIII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The afternoon in late November was brooding, making ready for
the first snow. The yet unfrozen earth was gray. The winter wheat
was a brave pale green before the dark of pine trees and of
hemlocks. The snow-containing sky was gray, the copper streaks
the color, Ase thought, of Mink Fisher's skin when he had first
known the Indian. He wondered why he thought now of old Mink and
then remembered. It had been at this season, with sky and earth
so colored, that he had once helped his friend to begin the
running of the trap lines. He longed suddenly for Mink's
presence, since the fur bearing animals, after years of
unmolested breeding, were back in numbers. Also, he realized, his
present content was so great that it needed only Mink to complete
it. The need of his brother was a steadier, more constant
pain.</p>

<p>Ase turned his rig into the barn for unhitching, marveling at
his felicity. All his crops had prospered. Severe cold had held
off, so that when the impending snow should fall, his increased
acreage of winter wheat would be bedded safe and soft against
anything but unforeseen catastrophe. The new barn, called for by
his expanding crops, had been raised, with the help of the
neighbors. Nellie was allowing him to have Tim McCarthy with him
for the winter.</p>

<p>He fingered the check in his pocket, walking in the not
entirely cold air to the house. He had shipped his apples, his
surplus barley and potatoes, his summer wheat, by the new freight
line to a more eastern market. The returns seemed to him
fabulous. They would finish paying for the new barn, they would
assure Nellie of Hulda's help for a long time, they would provide
as many hired hands as he might need for the coming spring and
summer, for he saw how he might enlarge his money-acreage by
developing his wood lot near the wintergreen bog, and turning the
old northwest wood lot into other and more profitable crops. If
and when Benjamin returned, he would be able to hear his brother
say, "Well done."</p>

<p>Hulda was doing the washing in the woodshed. Her strong fair
arms moved briskly up and down on the washboard. He wondered why
she had not married, for all her square-faced plainness, in this
country where a man needed a sturdy wife more than a handsome
one. He recognized again his good fortune in Nellie, capable and
busy as a mother wren, and still the prettiest woman in four
townships. He wanted to say something to Hulda, to let her know
that he appreciated her, beyond her wages. He cleared his throat,
to bring the always difficult speech.</p>

<p>"Hulda, what's the matter with the men around here? Somebody's
missing a good wife."</p>

<p>She drew a soapy hand across her face and flushed. He was
surprised to see tears come into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh Mr. Linden, dot's the trouble. The one I wanted, a
good-lookin' girl she got him. D'odders, all dey want is cook,
clean, wash, for free. Better I save my wages."</p>

<p>She added bitterly, "Maybe some day I buy me a hoosband."</p>

<p>He was sorry he had spoken. He had thought of Hulda as stupid
and contented. He was appalled to think how little one human
being knew of another. Any man or woman might live with a steady
heartache and there would be none to know or console. His mother,
true, announced her grief as though she beat blatantly on a
bronze bell, but it was her nature to do so. But the others were
silent: the physician Holder, driven by some tragedy unspoken;
Tim McCarthy, a sad-gay little man taken to drink and never
telling who or what had wronged him; he himself, Ase realized,
keeping secret his concern about his mother and his brother,
keeping privately above all his loneliness in the midst of love
and plenty.</p>

<p>And Nellie? She went about her family affairs gaily, playing
her tricks now that she was well again, her passion not so
insistent as once, yet he feared in her secret heart she still
longed for Benjamin, the wild, the glamorous, or for some remote
satisfaction beyond his understanding or capacity. He wanted to
comfort the Swedish girl. He could not think of anything to say.
He wanted to put his hand on her muscled arm by way of solace. He
wanted to give her his recognition of her value as a woman, even,
her solid charm.</p>

<p>He said, "You've turned into as good a cook as Mrs.
Linden."</p>

<p>"Yah. I know. I help cook soon as I finish washing."</p>

<p>Nellie and Amelia were in the sitting room. Ase was glad to
find them together.</p>

<p>He said, knowing it would please them both, "Here's the
check."</p>

<p>He laid it before them on the table. Nellie examined it
briefly.</p>

<p>"A lot more than you thought, Ase. Tell you what I want now. A
windmill for the well, so we can have a bathtub, and not have to
pump water for the house."</p>

<p>Amelia fingered the slip of paper.</p>

<p>She said, "Asahel, I've been lenient about our division of
money. I think that from now on you should give me my share."</p>

<p>He could not understand why she wanted her "share," as she
called it, for she had always had access to the family cash box.
When she had gone to Nevada in search of Ben she had nearly
depleted their joint monies.</p>

<p>He said, "Of course, Mother. I thought I'd start an account in
the new bank in Peytonville, but take whatever you want."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, you've got bills to pay out of this."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Mother Linden, we've got to save for the children's future.
They'll be needing all sorts of things. You can't hold money out
against them."</p>

<p>Amelia said blandly, "I am saying only that we must divide
properly. You forget my own child, robbed of his
inheritance."</p>

<p>Ase said, "We'll divide, Mother, any way you say."</p>

<p>Amelia went to her room.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, you're a fool. Shell ruin you if you let
her."</p>

<p>He was sickened. He could not eat the good meal Nellie put on
the table.</p>

<p>He asked, "Where are the children?"</p>

<p>"Playing in the old log house. I gave them stuff to take with
them to eat. If you don't have much to do right now, try to keep
them out of my way."</p>

<p>He went to the playhouse. It held remnants of the early
furniture, tables and stools and rawhide chairs, and enchanting
cupboards and crannies where the children could store their
treasures. He rapped on the heavy door with its shoestring latch,
for it was part of the fun that no one might enter without
knocking. 'Melie opened for him. She was nearly as tall as Nellie
and was wearing one of her mother's aprons. She was maternal and
officious.</p>

<p>The children looked up indifferently. He felt an intruder.
Nat, who had a passion for knives, was throwing his pocket knife
at a target on the wall. Arent was sorting over his collection of
birds' nests and eggs. Nat had never been interested in birds,
except to aim at them with his slingshot. 'Melie had tiny
pancakes baking on top of the stove. Her large assortment of
dolls was arranged on chairs around a table, waiting to be fed.
Willis sat in a corner, holding one of the reluctant barn cats.
Only Dolly ran to her father, clasped her thin little arms around
his long legs. He swung her to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's my Doll doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh Pa, I wanted to help cook, but I'm not any good."</p>

<p>'Melie said, flouncing herself, "She just gets in the way. Ma
says some girls are born cooks and some aren't. Dolly's plain
stupid."</p>

<p>Ase patted the child on his shoulder. He was aware of a subtle
cruelty here and did not know how to cope with it.</p>

<p>He said, "Doll can do other things. She can sing."</p>

<p>'Melie said, "Don't be silly, Pa. Who wants to listen to
singing when we're busy?"</p>

<p>Ase tried to recall where he had heard this comment before,
for it was not 'Melie's own. Yes, it had been a year or so ago at
threshing time, when Tim McCarthy had offered to sing and play,
and Nellie had stopped him curtly. Dolly buried her face in his
hair.</p>

<p>"There now, Doll, we'll sing at Christmas."</p>

<p>He felt the child trembling. He wondered to what extent 'Melie
over-rode this sensitive creature.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Who cares about Christmas singing? I hate
Christmas. I never get what I want."</p>

<p>Arent said, "Nat, you've forgotten. You wanted your pocket
knife and you got that."</p>

<p>"Yah, I wanted a gun, too, and I didn't get it. Don't you tell
me what I want."</p>

<p>Arent echoed, "That's right, you didn't get a gun."</p>

<p>Ase had told Nat that he might not have a gun of his own until
he was fourteen, some six months hence, and not then if he did
not curb himself on random inaccurate shooting. In practicing
with his father's gun, Nat had merely banged away, indifferent to
the wounding of game, seeming to want only to fire, with whatever
consequences.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Nat, you'll get your gun when you shoot
better."</p>

<p>"I've got to have my own gun, to shoot. Nothing's any good
unless it's your own."</p>

<p>Ase set Dolly down gently and left the cabin. He supposed Nat
was right, to a degree. A boy with his own gun would surely work
harder toward accuracy. He found McCarthy in the new barn. He
wanted to ask the old man's advice about Nat's trait of
possessiveness but felt it would be disloyal to his son to do
so.</p>

<p>Tim said, "It's a fine harvest you've had, Asahel my friend.
Things go well for you."</p>

<p>Ase touched the old man's arm.</p>

<p>On an impulse, he asked, "Have you heard lately from your
brother?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have that. He's selling of apple trees all over the
country. 'Tis rich he'll be if this continues. Privately, I
think, he's no more than eating regular. You know, Ase, he minds
me of your brother Benjamin that way, a-bragging and a-bumming
over the earth's surface. But good lads, both of them, good lads.
A-doing of the thing they want to do, and that's important for a
man, is it not? And I've not done it."</p>

<p>"What did you want to do, Tim?"</p>

<p>McCarthy scratched his grizzled head.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend, you do put up a problem. I'm after being a
man of simple needs. I suppose I wanted a sort of safeness, a
loving wife and childer, knowing where the next meal was coming
from for all of us, and independence on the side. Yes, that, to
be me own man under any and all conditions. None of that I've
had."</p>

<p>He turned to Ase.</p>

<p>"So now you're questioning me so sharp, what is it you've
wanted to do and have not? What is it you've been after
needing?"</p>

<p>Almost, Ase thought, he knew. He loved the land he tilled and
all its products. He wanted to know other lands and other
products, to feel strange soil under his feet, to draw strange
grasses between his fingers. He loved the changing seasons in
this place, from the first blood-root pushing through dank mould,
to the last yellow poplar leaf bedded beneath the snow. He loved
the March winds, the soft gray rain of April, the summer heat
that shimmered visibly over golden wheat, the bleak gales of
autumn, the winter ice that closed like a clean crystal death
over field and wood. He wanted to know the seasons other-where, a
wetter rain, a stronger sun, more sweeping storms and colder
ice.</p>

<p>He loved his Nellie and his Doll, felt pity and concern for
the strangers in his family, his mother and his other children.
Yet he was desolate without his brother, and it was with him he
wished to roam far away. And after he had known all possible of
this earth, he longed to know still others, to walk like a god
the starry sky. The sky itself could scarcely satisfy, it was
infinity for which he yearned, to be absorbed in it, never again
lonely, the cosmos filtering through his conscious being, and he
in turn returning to the cosmos his own awareness.</p>

<p>It was not that he willingly veiled his mind and his heart
from his friend, but only that, mute and puzzled, he could not
answer.</p>

<p>"Tim, I don't know."</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"There's things no living soul can speak to another. I
understand. I'd give you your heart's desire, if 'twas in my
hands and not the hands of God. You're a good man, Asahel Linden,
and I grieve for you, for all your plenty."</p>

<p>Ase thought, this is a rare thing, the understanding of this
old ragged farmhand, perhaps it is he who is after all my
brother. Yet with the brother, surely a man could speak out. He
remembered that he had been equally mute with Benjamin.</p>

<p>He said recklessly, "You're not to leave here this time.
You're to stay."</p>

<p>"That has been me own feeling. I doubt I'll burden you too
long."</p>

<p>The twilight was closing in. They did the evening chores. Tim
was as gentle with the stock as Ase. The sheep had not yet been
brought into their winter quarters, the weather continuing so
mild, but Ase sent Tim to the pasture with salt and extra feed.
The children came in from their play at the cabin, washed faces
and hands with the usual reluctance, as though imposed on.</p>

<p>Amelia, surprisingly, helped Nellie to serve the supper. She
gave an extra portion of her dessert to Dolly, stroking the
child's fair hair.</p>

<p>Dolly said, "Grandmother, I used to be afraid of you, but
you're so good."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear. I have never been understood."</p>

<p>The evening meal was pleasant, and all went early to bed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c24">XXIV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Snow fell softly all the winter day. The world was an inverted
paper weight, the snow filled the round atmosphere, it was the
atmosphere itself, shredded into these cool white patterns. Layer
on layer piled on the tree limbs, extended like arms for
garments, so that the trees were dressed and shapely. The roofs
of houses and barns and sheds were inches deep in eiderdown. In
late afternoon Ase heard the sleigh bells ringing, the clatter of
horse hoofs, bringing the children home from school.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the three of school age, Nat and Arent and 'Melie,
walked the two miles each way to the one-room Linden
school-house, but in times of heavy snowfall he sent them off in
the cutter, now that Nat was old enough to drive. He himself had
never had the use of a rig for school, and he remembered the
agony of walking, fighting against a bitter wind, his feet
slipping backward, half crying in exasperation, the miles taking
an eternity to cover. He had done his chores early, for there
were signs of the weather's worsening. He waited and helped the
boys unhitch and stable and feed and rub down the horse. The
lamps were lit in the house when he went to it. The windows were
golden. Firelight flickered orange and was reflected on the snow.
The house was a white-banked haven. The kitchen door opened into
a place of warmth and comfort and savory supper smells. Doll ran
to meet him. She brushed the snow from his coat sleeves. Supper
was early. If the children finished their homework quickly,
Nellie said, they might pop corn or make pulled taffy, or both.
They begged to do it now, to have the solace of munching while
they studied. Nellie laughed and agreed.</p>

<p>"It'll get all the muss out of the way at once, anyway," she
said.</p>

<p>'Melie boiled the molasses syrup while the boys shelled
popcorn and popped it over the fire in the living-room. Nellie
melted a dipper of butter for it. Ase picked out a cupful of
butternut meats for a portion of the candy. Doll helped him until
she pricked her finger. Her hands were so tiny, it seemed to him
they should be used for nothing but to hold a few thornless
flowers. It frightened him to think that she might ever have to
use them for anything harsh or heavy or unclean. The taffy was
cooled and pulled, 'Melie dictating its breaking into chunks.
Nellie warned against soiling the school books with buttery and
sticky fingers, and the children licked faithfully before turning
pages. Doll climbed into Ase's lap for her own lessons.</p>

<p>She was actually, at six, old enough for school, certainly
bright enough, but because of her frailness Ase was unwilling to
toss her into the rough and tumble of country school life, where
the pupils were sometimes as old as sixteen. Young as Doll was,
she shared with him the wonder of books and letters, and he must
be forever reading to her from his inadequate and unsuitable
volumes. She knew her alphabet and could already read and write a
few words. She wrote now with concentration, her little pink
tongue at one corner of her mouth. Ase corrected her spelling and
gave her three new words to learn. Amelia had had her supper in
her room. She opened the door.</p>

<p>She said, "You've all forgotten that poor old Grandmother
likes popcorn and taffy, too."</p>

<p>Nat mumbled, "Got a mighty good nose, to smell it through the
door."</p>

<p>Doll said, "We didn't forget. We'd have saved you some."</p>

<p>Nellie brought the plate and bowl. Amelia sat down in the
Boston rocker by the fire. She spread her handkerchief daintily
over her lap.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "You know popcorn gave you a stomach ache the
last time, Mother Linden. Better not eat so much again."</p>

<p>Amelia's sly greed for food was indeed a puzzling thing. It
was as though, feeling cheated by life, she would compensate
herself in this fashion. Surprisingly, too, she remained lean,
where Aunt Jess the midwife, who ate half as much, grew yearly
vaster. The consuming flame in Amelia seemed to burn up the
aliment as fast as she took it. She ate mincingly and steadily of
the popcorn and taffy.</p>

<p>Doll spelled her new words correctly and was praised.</p>

<p>"Now read to me, Da," she commanded.</p>

<p>Ase had exhausted the Bible stories comprehensible to a child,
unless he underestimated her understanding. His Shakespeare was
of course beyond her, but he looked forward to the time when she
would read aloud to him the rolling rhythms, where his own tongue
could only stammer. He brought a volume of his disappointing
encyclopedia and searched through it for items of interest. He
turned to the gems, and recalling his own comparison of them to
Nellie's jewel-like jellies, passed on his conception to the
little girl. She was delighted.</p>

<p>She said, "But Da, nobody can eat them like jelly, can
they?"</p>

<p>"No, Doll."</p>

<p>"Then what are they good for?"</p>

<p>Amelia brushed a crumb of candy from her flat breast.</p>

<p>"They're ornaments for rich and pretty ladies, Dolly," she
said. "They dress you up and show that you have lots of
money."</p>

<p>Ase felt a slow anger spreading through his veins. He
remembered the taint his mother had put on old McCarthy's gift of
a silver piece to Nat. He could not allow her to pass corruption
to this beloved child. He struggled for words. Doll nodded.</p>

<p>"Just something pretty to look at," she said. "Like flowers.
Da, this one, the ruby, is that right? It's the same color as
Mama's red roses."</p>

<p>It came to Ase in a wave of relief that perhaps Doll was
incorruptible.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "Just something pretty to look at, like,
flowers."</p>

<p>"Read me some more, Da."</p>

<p>He searched for something with which to feed her imagination.
All the pages seemed dull. After "gems" he came on "genie" and
tried to explain as best he might. He turned pages back again and
found "Gemini," the stars, and here he was more at home. He found
courage along with speech, and fumbling, told of Mink Fisher,
only a little, but of the Indian's taking him so long ago across
the Milky Way. Doll's eyes were wide, as starry as the sky he
attempted to describe.</p>

<p>"Da, you couldn't really walk on it, could you? You'd just
have to think about it."</p>

<p>He became aware of his mother. She had risen from her
chair.</p>

<p>"Haven't you done enough damage, Asahel, without passing on
these savage superstitions? To this child in particular, whose
birth kept you from your brother?"</p>

<p>The children were gaping. Nellie laid a hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Mother Linden."</p>

<p>Amelia said in a loud voice, "Don't you try to quiet me, you
sly one. I know you, trying to get a claim on this place."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Come, Mother. You'd better go to bed."</p>

<p>He led her away and closed the door after her. She had
frightened Willis.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Say, I think Grandma's crazy."</p>

<p>Doll was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"She's very sad, isn't she, Da?"</p>

<p>He nodded, amazed at the child's perception.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Don't any of you cross her when she's like that.
Just agree with her."</p>

<p>Nat asked, frowning, "What did she mean, talking about a
claim? It's our place, not hers, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Ase and Nellie exchanged glances. She shook her head at him in
warning.</p>

<p>She said easily, "Of course it's our place. Don't pay any
attention to Grandma's talk. She's an old lady and not
responsible."</p>

<p>Ase was obliged to agree tacitly on reassurance for the
children. He wondered unhappily if Nellie and McCarthy had been
right, after all, if years ago he should not have had the matter
out with his mother, have arranged at least some definite
division. Nat sat rocking back and forth, his hands clasped over
his knobby adolescent knees.</p>

<p>"Pa, will you sell the place some day and divide up the
money?"</p>

<p>Ase stared at the boy.</p>

<p>"Why, I hope not, Nat. This is our home. Wouldn't you like to
have your own children here some day?"</p>

<p>"Nah. No old farm for me."</p>

<p>Arent echoed, "Me either."</p>

<p>Nellie ordered them all to bed. Doll tugged at her father's
coat.</p>

<p>"Da, why is Grandmother sad?"</p>

<p>"You've heard us talk about your Uncle Benjamin. He's been
gone since before any of you were born. Grandmother worries about
him."</p>

<p>"He's lost?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Doll, he's lost."</p>

<p>He stroked her soft curls, so like Nellie's.</p>

<p>"But she has all of us."</p>

<p>He could not explain the uniqueness of love, so that out of
the largest household, one only might fill and ease the
heart.</p>

<p>"Suppose I lost you, Doll. The others wouldn't make up for it,
would they?"</p>

<p>Grief and panic struck her, as though untimely hail crushed a
windflower.</p>

<p>She sobbed, "Don't ever lose me, Da. You won't ever lose
me?"</p>

<p>He took her in his arms to comfort her.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "That's what you get for talking to her as if she
was grown up. Her grandmother had her scared to begin with."</p>

<p>She took the child away to bed. Ase brought in extra wood to
the kitchen, for the temperature was dropping rapidly. He
supposed he should not have attempted to answer Doll's question,
yet she drew honesty from him always. There seemed no limit, he
thought, to her ability to understand him. They were like two
streams meeting to make a river, so that it was impossible to
tell where one flow ended and the other began. He lay awake a
long time. The snow had stopped falling. In the increasing cold,
the house timbers groaned and cracked. Lake Pip rumbled as its
ice thickened. The bitter air was a vacuum. The night, he
suspected, was a weather breeder.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c25">XXV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase scarcely knew when morning came, for the gray of daylight
did not alter from the gray of dawn. There was no wind. The world
was hushed and still. There would be snow again, he was
certain.</p>

<p>Even Nellie overslept in the deceptive light, and there was a
bustle in the kitchen, a hurried eating of breakfast and packing
of lunch buckets, so that the children would not be late for
school. When the house had quieted, Amelia appeared to ask for
breakfast on a tray before the living-room fire. She was bland
and amiable, as though her outbreak of the night before had never
been. She called Dolly to her and made her a cup of cambric tea
from the tray.</p>

<p>Nellie murmured to Ase, "Wouldn't you think the child would be
frightened to death to go near her this morning? I suppose she's
forgotten all about it overnight."</p>

<p>It seemed more likely to him that Doll's gift for compassion
was endless. He saw her straighten the lace at her grandmother's
throat, then feed her a bit of sugar cooky dipped in the cambric
tea. They made a gracious picture together, the dark old woman
and the pale, lovely child.</p>

<p>He dressed warmly to go to the sheep-shed. He turned down the
ear flaps of his fur cap and tied a woolen muffler close. He had
not heard the wind rising, but when he stepped outside it met him
from the west, a pack of wolves springing for his throat. Driving
particles that were more ice than snow bit at his face and hands
like teeth. If the weather thickened, there would be a blizzard.
He wished he had kept the children out of school today. He was
relieved to shut the door safely on the rest of his family. The
woodshed held fuel for warmth for weeks, cellar and pantry and
attic were stocked with food for months, the winter, even. If the
blizzard came, he would keep the children home, would put old
McCarthy at house chores, at stoking the fires, and would make
his way back and forth alone to care for the stock in the barns.
His house was in order, ready for a siege. He had made with his
own hands this protection for his own. He felt the deep male
satisfaction of the provider.</p>

<p>A young ewe had been bred too early and showed signs of
lambing. He sought her out among the flock. She stood gently as
he felt her belly. Life was stirring, the lamb lay low in her
womb. It would be born perhaps at nightfall. The ram came nosing,
spoke to him, then returned to his munching of clover hay. Ase
brought extra loads of bedding straw to the shed. The sheep stood
knee deep in its warm sweetness. He filled the feeding troughs
with the best wheat middlings, pumped bucket after bucket of
water from the barnyard well. McCarthy was at the same business
in the barn. He was pitching down hay from the loft. Ase moved on
to the barn stalls.</p>

<p>McCarthy called, "'Tis a bad storm we'll get, I'm thinking. We
can make all snug and then keep to the house our own selves, save
for coming to the milch cows. Would you consider now, turning the
calves in to suck, do we have a few desperate days of it?"</p>

<p>Ase called back, "No. I can always get through."</p>

<p>McCarthy came down from the loft and chuckled.</p>

<p>"You're a man in a thousand, Asahel Linden. I was hired hand
to a devil once. 'Twas in Ohio in a flood-time, and rather than
wade to his waist only, he lost a heifer beautiful as an Irish
queen. Most others would let the calves suck and ruin the bags
for the two-great fullness."</p>

<p>Ase took a pitchfork and divided the hay among the stalls. The
cows had already come into the barn from their outside lot in
animal prescience. A sudden gust of wind shook the building. The
snow, hard and bitter, pelted the roof. The day was so gray that
the interior of the barn held almost the darkness of night.
McCarthy joined him to fetch oats and bran and shelled corn. The
cattle could be trusted not to overeat, confronted with a three
days' supply of food, but the horses would not be so cautious. He
would have to bring them water in any case. He piled their
surplus grain in a corner, to be doled out to them when he came
for the milking of the cows.</p>

<p>The wind that had been coming from the west veered to the
northwest. This gave a greater protection, especially for the
sheep-shed, which was partly open on the southern side, yet it
indicated altogether too definitely the blizzard. The snow now
swept in thickly, it was heavy and ominous, with none of the
feather lightness proper to the season. It seemed to Ase that
snow resembled human beings, after a fashion, with an equal
capacity for good or evil. It was necessary for covering the
winter wheat, it was needed for winter moisture, to supplement
the spring and summer and autumn rains, for without water neither
man nor stock nor vegetation could survive. Yet when it came, as
now, it was malevolent. He recognized in the same instant that he
was being unjust in his conception of the snow, for it was a
casual, an indifferent, force of nature, where mankind, surely,
had a choice.</p>

<p>He said to Tim, "We'd better finish here and not go in for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Right you are. The dear Nellie's food will be that more
delicious in the afternoon. Listen now, there's sleigh bells,
isn't it your light cutter coming home from the school?"</p>

<p>The sleigh turned in. The teacher had sent the children home
ahead of the storm. Ase helped Nat and Arent with the unhitching
and sent them with 'Melie to the house.</p>

<p>He said, "Tell your mother please to save dinner for Tim and
me until a little later."</p>

<p>The children ran to the house, cupping their hands over their
faces against the cutting snow and wind. Ase and Tim worked into
mid-afternoon, preparing comfort for the stock. The sheep, the
cows, the horses, the poultry, the barn cats, all snugged down,
content with the amplitude of food and of warmth.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "'Tis good to have things right and proper. No
doubt the Nellie will be after rewarding us with her good ham and
succotash."</p>

<p>They were obliged to bend low against the wind to reach the
kitchen door, scarcely visible in the murkiness. Ase pulled it
open and it flew back, straining against the hinges. He drew it
shut after them. In the woodshed they brushed the snow from their
clothing, stamped their feet and came into the kitchen. Nellie
was waiting for them, their dinner ready. The two men ate
ravenously.</p>

<p>Ase asked, "Where are the children?"</p>

<p>"They wanted to play in the log house, but I told them it was
too cold, so they're upstairs in the carriage barn, with the
stove going. I gave them stuff to eat there. The blizzard's like
a holiday for them."</p>

<p>"Where's Mother?"</p>

<p>"In her room. Didn't want any dinner. She went out for a walk
in the snow, she said. She wasn't gone long."</p>

<p>The carriage barn could not be too warm at best. He went there
to the upper story where the stove was burning bright, where the
popping corn hung festooned over the piles of hickory and
butternuts. Nat and Arent, 'Melie and Willis were finishing the
picnic food Nellie had prepared for them.</p>

<p>Ase sensed rather than saw that Dolly was not among the brood.
He checked them over, looked around the long bare room for the
child. The room was warm at the end where the stove glowed red
and the children cooked and ate and played. The other end was
cold and empty. Beside the open stairway hung the heavy rope for
ringing the farm bell above the roof.</p>

<p>He said, "Where's Doll?"</p>

<p>'Melie said, "That's the first thing you always ask, Pa.
'Where's Doll?' She didn't come with us, that's all I know."</p>

<p>She served more food in her officious way. Ase had a feeling
of guilt. It was true, Doll was his first concern. He should not
so reveal himself, to the extent of making the other children
resentful. Yet ordinarily they seemed scarcely conscious of his
presence, or, he was sure, his absence.</p>

<p>He said, "Why don't you pop some corn?"</p>

<p>Nat said, with his mouth full, "Have to wait for baby Doll for
anything special."</p>

<p>Ase turned away down the narrow steps, across the driveway
through the blinding snow, through the woodshed and into the
kitchen. Nellie had finished her work there. McCarthy was nodding
in a rocker near the range. She was not in the living-room nor
was Doll in sight. He found Nellie finally in the attic, taking
woolen clothing from chests and trunks.</p>

<p>She said over her shoulder, "Never saw it so cold. House
doesn't seem to warm up. Thought we'd all better have extra
flannel underwear. The kids getting enough to eat?"</p>

<p>"Nellie, Doll isn't with them."</p>

<p>She said, "Come to think of it, she wasn't with them when they
went out to the carriage barn. Why pshaw, she must be with your
mother in her room. Go get both of them and make them eat
something. They haven't had a bite of dinner. There's plenty in
the pantry."</p>

<p>Ase rapped on Amelia's door. There was no answer. He rapped
again.</p>

<p>"Mother, it's Ase."</p>

<p>He heard her rise, pushing back her chair, heard her slow walk
to the door. She opened it.</p>

<p>She said, "I was having such a nice nap. You shouldn't have
disturbed me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mother. I'm looking for Doll. Nellie said she must
be with you."</p>

<p>"Doll? Oh yes. Dolly. She's not here. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"She isn't with the other children."</p>

<p>"She isn't? Really, Asahel, you can't expect me to know all
these things. She went with me on my walk in the snow. I love the
fresh snow, I've always loved it, it's so clean. It makes me feel
young again. You've done such dreadful things to me, but when
Dolly and I walked in the snow together, really, I forgave
you."</p>

<p>He took her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mother, you say Doll went with you in the snow? It isn't snow
now, it's a blizzard. Where is Doll? Where did you go?"</p>

<p>She smoothed the front of her black satin dress.</p>

<p>"Why, we went for a little walk. I wanted to break some
hemlock boughs, to make a sweet-smelling pillow for my bed. The
needles smell so wonderfully in the winter."</p>

<p>He shook her roughly.</p>

<p>"Mother, where is Doll?"</p>

<p>"My son, how should I know? She had the idea that if she lay
down, the snow fairies would come to her. So, I left her lying in
the snow. A stupid child, to think that, I should say. I told her
it was not to be expected."</p>

<p>"Mother, where did you and Doll go in the snow?"</p>

<p>"Over the hill, my dear, over the hill. Somewhere."</p>

<p>He roused McCarthy by the kitchen range.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Tim. Doll is lost in the blizzard."</p>

<p>The old man shook himself.</p>

<p>"Mother of God. Where do we begin the searching for her?"</p>

<p>"Over the hill."</p>

<p>"Would that be by the wintergreen bog?"</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>Surely no child could stand against the wind. Through the
driving snow the barns were invisible from the road. Ase vanished
from Tim's sight at a distance of six feet and the old man called
out to him to wait, else he should be lost, too. They groped
their way to the lane gate. The lane was fenced to beyond the top
of the hill. They took a moment to consult, agreed to stay within
the lane, to take with them all the rope available. They gathered
plow lines, pulley ropes, in feverish haste, all they could lay
their hands on. Inside the barn the gale was a little muted.</p>

<p>McCarthy panted, "What on earth took the child away? And no
one to see her go."</p>

<p>Ase did not answer. He could not face questions, least of all
his own, not now. He led the way up the lane, bending low against
the white, dispassionate fury that was the blizzard. He blundered
into the fence, first on one side, then the other. McCarthy kept
hold of his coat tail. He tugged at it for attention.</p>

<p>"Why are you thinking first of the bog woods? She never went
there except for flowers, and never alone."</p>

<p>It must be told sooner or later. The wind whipped the words
from his mouth and flung them back at McCarthy.</p>

<p>"My mother took her over the hill somewhere to break hemlock
boughs for the needles."</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven. A day like this."</p>

<p>Toward the end of the lane they slowed and searched back and
forth across it. More than two feet of snow had already fallen.
The old snow and the new were piling in drifts waist-high. A
small body would be hidden under them.</p>

<p>McCarthy shouted, "Pray God the child's kept moving. 'Tis the
one thing would save her."</p>

<p>But she had lain down, Amelia said. So that the snow fairies
would come to her. He had told her no such fantasy. Had she then
made it for herself, or had it come from the dark arctic mind of
a madwoman? And from madness only? He lurched into the gate that
opened into the hill pasture. He tied one end of a rope to a gate
post. Shaking in the cold, he knotted rope to rope, line to line.
With luck, the lengths should reach to the hemlock wood, almost
to the near limits of the bog. At least the bog was frozen. There
was not that horror to be faced, more ominous than ever since the
day the gypsy boy had fallen in. Or been pushed. Ase felt a spasm
through his body that was of more than the cold.</p>

<p>It was impossible to keep a straight direction when there was
no landmark, nothing at all to be seen but a whirling chaos, like
nebulae in collision. There were a few more yards of rope
remaining. He crashed head on into the trunk of a tree. He
girthed it with his arms. It was the largest hemlock of all,
standing somewhat left of the entrance to the wood. He felt of it
again, to make certain, stripped a few needles from a low bough
abstractedly. The crushed wet fragrance was strong and pungent.
But there had been no such scent in his mother's room. There had
been in her room no hemlock boughs at all.</p>

<p>The trees gave some protection, the ground could be seen and
searched within a radius of some forty feet. No deep drifts were
here as yet. The bog indeed was frozen, harmless for once. They
fanned to the limits of the rope to the left and to the right. No
child was here. The trees lashed their boughs and complained.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "The only other hemlocks would be the few ones
by the northwest wood lot."</p>

<p>So they would be, Ase agreed in his mind, if his mother had
truly gone in search of them. And if not, where else might she
have led his Doll, to leave her lying in the snow?</p>

<p>"She wasn't gone long," Nellie had said.</p>

<p>He tried to reconstruct his mother's habits. She did wander
away occasionally in her desperation. Where was it he had seen
her go, from where had he sometimes found her and led her home
again? It was most often from the willow trees along the stream.
He remembered once finding her on the wooden bridge, stark as a
statue.</p>

<p>"My Benjamin left me over this bridge," she said.</p>

<p>McCarthy cried, "Asahel my friend, we'll freeze like the child
if we stand here. The ropes will not be after reaching clear to
the wood lot from the west fence, but leave us be trying as far
as possible."</p>

<p>Amelia had surely gone to the willows.</p>

<p>Ase shouted, the wind and snow again overwhelming, "We'll try
along the brook."</p>

<p>McCarthy repeated, shouting, too, "No, no, the northwest wood
lot, the only other place of hemlocks."</p>

<p>Perhaps Amelia had set out to gather boughs and had then
forgotten her errand. One place was no more hopeless for
searching than another. He had a despairing sense of haste. Doll
might perish in the very moments wasted in the wrong direction.
He worked his way back down the lane, stumbling in his hurry.
Perhaps she had found a shelter somewhere. Why, perhaps she had
even made her way to the log cabin. A child's sense of direction
was sometimes as uncanny as an animal's. Hope warmed his numb
body. In the deep snow of the road itself he managed a plunging
trot, his long legs breaking something of a trail for the little
man following half-blinded behind him. He found the split-rail
fence along the apple orchard and kept to it, tearing hands and
knees against its projecting sharpness. The fence ended. He
groped for the cabin in the clearing, decided he had missed it,
when he crashed into its wall. He felt around three sides before
his fingers recognized the door. The latch was stiff and heavy.
He had to throw his shoulder against the door to open it.</p>

<p>Tim, holding to him, yelled, "A child could not have
entered."</p>

<p>Perhaps through a window, Ase thought, unable to deny himself
his hope. The cabin was murky. It must be already twilight of the
day, indistinguishable for the storm. He found a candle on the
mantel over the hearth and lit it. Their shadows moved like
ghosts against the walls. The candlelight sought out every
corner, reached under the ancient bunks, into the cupboards,
empty of all but children's toys and knick-knacks. A battered rag
doll that was a favorite of Dolly's blinked its shoe button eyes.
This was a good omen, surely. She must be in the cabin. He opened
the door into the one small bedroom where his mother had slept as
a bride. No child was here.</p>

<p>The blizzard assailed the cabin. Snow hissed down onto the
bare hearth. The wind screamed down the chimney in a high treble
wail. McCarthy shook him.</p>

<p>"Man, we're losing time. It's the wood lot next and then the
stream. Leave us stop by and ring the bell."</p>

<p>The cabin door swung unlatched after them, the snow and wind
marched in, the rag doll with shoe button eyes was blown to the
wide-planked floor and was drifted over.</p>

<p>It was nearer night than twilight, and a cruel thing to ring
in the neighbors now for such a dangerous search. By crossing the
road and meeting the north-side rail fence, they made their way
back to the house driveway and into the carriage barn. It was
nearly dark inside but Ase found the bell rope and pulled, and
pulled again desperately, leaning back almost as far as Nellie
had done in her days of clowning. The great bell reached four
neighboring farms, including the Wilsons', and except when rung
at the conventional hours for calling the hands to table, was an
understood signal of dire need, to which all within hearing
responded. Tolling the bell, it occurred to Ase that it was fire
all would be expecting, yet they would come the quicker in
country dread of that. But the blizzard so muted the sound of the
bell that it was only the Wilsons who heard it faintly, and
agreed among themselves that it was another illusory voice of the
storm, speaking its various and evil language. Nellie heard and
called from the woodshed door. The two men reached her. They
huddled a moment in the welcome shelter.</p>

<p>She said, "Ase, I can't get a word out of your mother, but
Doll must have gone with her."</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"Better come in and have hot coffee before you go on looking.
Maybe she found a place to hide."</p>

<p>He thought, there is no place to hide from death when it
reaches out its cold definitive claws.</p>

<p>He said, "I can't come in. Tim, go in for coffee."</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "I've not been much of a man, my friend, but
I'm staying with you wherever I'm needed to go."</p>

<p>"All right, Tim. I want to go to the stream."</p>

<p>Now it was dark indeed. The night had truly come. Ase lit two
lanterns. Again, the two friends followed the rail fence, down
the road, to the wooden bridge. Ase turned off to the south. He
dipped his hands into the snowdrifts, scuffled with his feet, in
search of the unspeakable.</p>

<p>McCarthy called, "'Tis a wild goose chase, Ase, you must know
that."</p>

<p>The willow trees were weighted with snow. Their slender
branches were too burdened. Ase felt something under his foot. He
bent down and dug feverishly in the snow. The object was only a
granite rock. He went on. Now he thought that Doll was somewhere
near. His groping hand met a small hardness. He pulled on it and
pulled again. He did not lift his lantern, yet as he drew the
stiff and frozen thing from under the snow, he knew that it was
Doll.</p>

<p>A knife went through him, it was a thick knife, jagged and
dull, not cleanly sharp. It turned over and over inside his
stomach, his loins, his breast, until there was no part of him
that was not bleeding. McCarthy heard the low groan of pain and
touched him. Ase handed him his lantern and stooped to lift the
weightless body. It had frozen in the curled and sleeping
position of the embryo. McCarthy led the way with the two
lanterns lifted. The tears froze on his seamed old face as they
fell. There was no word of comfort he could ever say. He could
only hold his lanterns high to light the road for the feet of his
friend.</p>

<p>He went first into the house to send the children away
upstairs. He spread a quilt on the couch in the living room, made
a sheet ready. Nellie's shrill cries offended him.</p>

<p>He said sternly, "Hush now. Do you not be adding to the terror
for the others."</p>

<p>He could not control her. Her grief was primitive and female.
It would heal, he knew, and was no greater and no less for the
one child than it would have been for any of the others. Ase, he
thought, might better have lost his eyes, they were not so much a
part of him as this child. He dreaded to speak, but it was
necessary.</p>

<p>"Asahel, my friend, the thawing of the little limbs--. Leave
me be doing the straightening, to spare you."</p>

<p>Ase shook his head. He knelt by the couch and stroked the tiny
arms and legs until they warmed into their final coldness. He
forced himself at last to draw the sheet over her face. This was
a nightmare, surely she was only sleeping. Her mouth held a faint
smile, as though in that last sweet and drowsy moment, she may
have glimpsed the snow fairies for which she waited.</p>

<p>McCarthy said, "I'll try to be making it to town tonight, if
you'd rather. Or get in some of the Wilsons. They could not have
heard the bell."</p>

<p>Ase looked at him blankly.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said. "There's no hurry now."</p>

<p>"In the morning, then, if the blizzard's lessened. I doubt a
team could make it else."</p>

<p>Nellie had exhausted herself with sobbing. McCarthy induced
her to leave, to go to bed. He knew his friend's need to be
alone, knew when they were gone he would draw away again the
sheet, to fill his memory, quite needlessly, with the small face.
He laid his hand a moment on Ase's head, with all he could give
to it of blessing. He turned away, trudged with his old man's
slow gait up the back stairs to his bedroom. He found himself
coughing. He longed for a pot of scalding tea but was unwilling
to make a commotion in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Ase sat all night by the side of the couch. The fire died down
and he was not aware that he was cold until suddenly his fingers
were too numb to move to touch the child's marble forehead. He
thought in a panic, he must keep the room warm for Doll. He built
up the fire again. The blizzard shook the house. It came inside,
trampled him under iced and silver hoofs. He thought irrelevantly
of the ewe about to yean, she would perhaps not own the lamb, and
then he would bring the woolly orphan to a box behind the kitchen
stove and raise it on a bottle. He had promised Dolly the first
orphan lamb for her own. The knife turned in him again, the pain
rose to his throat so that he was suffocated. Sweat stood on his
forehead. He clenched his fists against the anguish tearing out
his vitals.</p>

<p>The wind cried high and thin as in the cabin.</p>

<p>All night it cried, "Don't ever lose me, Da! Don't ever lose
me!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The lilacs, growing bold too long, had over-reached
themselves. In their eighteen years since Nellie had planted
them, they had grown faster than Nat, now nearly as tall as his
father. The mass of lavender pannicles made a hanging garden of
its own, the fragrance almost too much of a sweetness, so that
Ase Linden shook his head to free his nostrils. Slyly, through
the years, the lilacs had sent out insidious suckers. Ase saw
with surprise that the young shoots had not only encroached on a
portion of the graveled driveway and on the smooth lawn, but were
flourishing in a veritable thicket beyond the west fence, and
into the field which he planned to plant this spring to
buckwheat.</p>

<p>He brought a grubbing hoe and set to work to rout them out.
They were tough, resistant. He felt the landsman's dislike for a
growing thing that ran wild beyond control. A shower of morning
dew sprayed over his face from the pendulous bloom he jostled. He
took it for reproach, for there were many things that spread as
carelessly but that delighted him; mint and water cress along the
willow stream, wild strawberries, even buttercups and daisies. He
loved flowers as Nellie did, and with an added awareness of the
mystery of their haunts, the magic of snowdrop and blood-root and
arbutus coming to blossom on the very heels of the retreating
winter. Yet the lilacs had always disturbed him. He leaned on his
hoe. Of course. He remembered now. He had awakened to the scent
of Nellie's lilacs so long ago, when he had been frightened for
her, giving birth to their first-born. It was he who was
unreasonable and not the lilacs. When he was done with his
hoeing, driveway, lawn and field clear of the suckers, he broke
an armful of the flowers in something of apology. He divided
them, took one bouquet to Nellie in the kitchen, and rapped on
the door of his mother's room to present her with the other.</p>

<p>Amelia's voice called weakly, "Come in."</p>

<p>She lay propped against her pillows. She seemed so old, so
old. He laid the lilacs on her knees, bony under the coverlet,
and took one of her withered, blue-veined hands in his gnarled
one.</p>

<p>"Lilacs, Mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can smell them. Nellie's lilacs. I remember when she
brought them here."</p>

<p>So she too, he thought, had been going back into the past on
this fair April morning. Her hands plucked at the covers, as
though she picked over the rags of memory.</p>

<p>"It seems just yesterday," she said.</p>

<p>"It was eighteen years ago."</p>

<p>He released her hand and sat in silence, counting. Why, his
mother was not old at all, as age went in this sturdy
country.</p>

<p>"Let me think now, Nellie and I are forty years of age, or
thereabouts, my mother is something past seventy, and that is
nothing."</p>

<p>Old Grimstedt, who thought to cheat Pav the gypsy, was in his
nineties, still taking his turn at the harvesting. The two
foreign brothers down the road, who kept to themselves and made
coffee of their barley grain, they were men near eighty, still
working their land alone and prospering, hiding their wealth,
folk said, under their mattress.</p>

<p>No, Ase thought, my mother is not old, not old enough to lie
like this against her pillows. Yet what was it that aged a man or
a woman? Nellie was often as young and blithe, as mischievous, as
in her girlhood. As for himself, it seemed to him that he had
been born old. He recalled all that had tormented his mother, to
make her old before her time. She lifted the lilacs to her
face.</p>

<p>Holder the physician had been right about her. Ase leaned back
in his chair and revived in anguish the day of the burying of his
Doll, the child who was alone blood of his blood, flesh of his
flesh, bone of his bone. He was back in that day, completely
vivid again, and it was a day in and of eternity.</p>

<p>It had been necessary to wait to bury Doll until the blizzard
ended, until the frozen ground thawed enough to dig her little
grave. He remembered that as the tiny coffin was lowered into the
dark and final earth, he had thought that after all, Doll would
never need to use her delicate hands for anything more harsh than
the holding of thornless flowers. He thought of the second grave,
the larger coffin. He had lost Tim McCarthy, too, a few days
after Doll. The exposure during the search had finished the old
fellow. Tim and Doll were laid side by side under the ambiguous
earth, an earth that gave and an earth that received. Ase had
been conscious of Nellie's satisfaction, under her grief, that
McCarthy was proving so little trouble after all. He recalled the
vacuity of the double funeral sermon, for there was as little the
man of God could find to say of the one as of the other, the
child dead untimely, the old man, the preacher intimated, having
lived a life as wasted. The death of Tim had been a muted thing.
Against the diapason of his agony, the lesser note was for the
moment lost.</p>

<p>Doll and Tim, he could think of them now together, a linked
thread in the pattern of pain. Yet when first the larger grave
had been covered over, and then the smaller, Tim's had been the
shadow and Doll's the substance. Amelia's stark reality had
remained as always, but now sharply to be questioned.</p>

<p>He himself would not have known how to raise the question
about his mother. Returned home from the burying, he sat numb.
Dr. Holder and Nellie had asked him to choose between two various
ways of tearing himself to pieces. Nellie had begun it.</p>

<p>She had said, "Ase, I've asked Doc what we ought to do about
your mother."</p>

<p>Holder had said gently, "I know this is painful for you,
Linden, I know it's difficult for you to speak, but we have to
get down to bedrock. Nellie told me about your mother's taking
the child out into the beginning of the blizzard and leaving her
there to die."</p>

<p>The words rang in his ears with the metal clangor of the
tolling bell no neighbor had heard or, hearing, understood and
heeded.</p>

<p>"The first question, Linden, is whether she knew what she was
doing. The next, in which case is she most dangerous?"</p>

<p>Ase had not answered. Holder had continued with the
physician's ruthful mercilessness.</p>

<p>"If she meant to do it, she may be no longer dangerous, for
she seems to have hated only the one child. Yet still, that's
murder, and my duty would be to certify her as criminally insane.
On the other hand, if her mind was merely wandering and there was
no evil intention, she might easily, another time, lead Willis
into some similar disaster. To your famous bog, for instance.
Have I laid out the issues fairly?"</p>

<p>Ase had nodded. He was cold to the marrow of his bones.</p>

<p>"Well, Linden, what's your feeling about it?"</p>

<p>His feeling? Why, it was only of nameless horror, deep and
black as the bog, enveloping as the blizzard.</p>

<p>Nellie said wearily, "Doc, you can't ask the man to pass
sentence on his own mother. I'm willing to leave it up to you, if
he is."</p>

<p>Ase had stared a long time out of the window, across the gray
hideous slush the thaw had made of the snow. It was asking too
much of the physician, too, he thought, to pass judgment on a
human soul. That was a function of God. Or was each soul supposed
to judge itself, was that the ladder by which it climbed toward
godhood? And if so, where and whose was the responsibility when a
soul like Amelia's had lost, apparently, all power of judgment?
Did it then lie in the opaque and timeless hands of time?</p>

<p>Holder persisted, "Would you like to call in some of Nellie's
people? Other doctors, perhaps, or your friend the Judge, a
home-made jury, shall we say, if you're unwilling to pass on your
mother's guilt?"</p>

<p>Tim, Ase thought, only Tim might now have helped him.</p>

<p>Nellie spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Keep it in this house, Doc. Gossip about it's not right for
the children. Unless she has to be put away, then everyone'll
know anyhow. Ase, you have to say. Either what you know or think.
Or will you leave it up to Doc?"</p>

<p>He saw his mother behind tall barred windows, the screams of
maniacs picking at her like carrion crows. It would take but a
little of this to kill her. And if she were better dead? He saw
her roaming over the pasture hill, another of Nellie's children
by the hand, moving toward the bog.</p>

<p>As though he bowed indeed to God, he said, "Whatever you
decide, Doctor," knowing he was frightened.</p>

<p>Holder drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Very well. It's a risk for all of us, but let's keep her here
for the time being. Watch her closely. Warn the children that
she's not responsible. If she shows any peculiarity she hasn't
had before, let me know at once and we'll make another decision.
I think this is the way you want it, Linden. Nellie?"</p>

<p>She passed her hand over her tear-swollen eyes, brushed back
her curls from her forehead. She spoke directly to her
husband.</p>

<p>"I can stand her around a few more years, if you can bear the
sight of her."</p>

<p>Ase laid his hand on hers.</p>

<p>He said, "You're so good."</p>

<p>Sitting at his mother's bedside now, Ase brought himself back
from his memories of that day. It had seemed a long time, as time
went for one family, with the children growing fast, and Amelia
only fading away, turning to skin and bones in her bedroom. He
was obliged to ask himself again if she had truly murdered Doll,
had been terrified, after, by her act, and so, had quieted. He
put aside his panic at the thought. In any case, Holder's
judgment had proved correct. She had given no trouble of any
sort, had turned almost gentle, lying in her bed against her
pillows, even smiling sometimes at Nellie when her tray of food
was brought her. Nellie's patience had been inexhaustible.</p>

<p>"Shall I put the lilacs in water for you, Mother?"</p>

<p>"That will be nice. On the mantel, where I can see them. So
pretty. Dear Nellie's lilacs."</p>

<p>And was this, he thought, another spurious thing, was his
mother hiding behind the lilacs? But she had been always hidden.
He brought a vase and arranged the flowers awkwardly.</p>

<p>Nellie had shortened the stems of the lilacs he had taken her
and made a low bouquet for the dining-room table. The day was
Saturday, so that the children were home from school.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Goodness knows where the boys have gone to,
you'd better ring the dinner bell."</p>

<p>He went to the carriage shed and tolled the bell. He was
annoyed with himself for being reluctant to ring it, as he had
been ashamed to find that he had blamed the lilacs this morning.
Yet ever since the twilight of the blizzard, when he and Tim
McCarthy had rung the bell, and no help had come, he had hated
the bell as he hated the lilacs. If the bell had been heard, been
recognized, the Wilsons would have come, and the other neighbors,
and Doll been found in time to save her. How could a man escape
his self-centeredness, he pondered, how divide the inevitable
from his private destiny, from his own failures and stupidity.
For he would never be done with his sense of guilt at losing
Doll. He should have asked for her earlier, he should have been
constantly aware that a life as precious as hers was always
menaced, if not by Amelia, by some other obscurity that disliked
perfection. As the last stroke of the bell died away, he heard
Nat and Arent and 'Melie and Willis running to the house,
children of his loins but not his heart, to Nellie's bountiful
table. It came to him that the one strong family bond was
Nellie's food.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Quiet down, you kids. I won't have a racket at
the table."</p>

<p>Ase thought, half smiling, "Mrs. Joshua, you might as well
tell the sun to stand still."</p>

<p>Nat at seventeen was half man, half boy. He was nearly six
feet tall and was not done growing. His shoulders were broad and
he would make a bulkier man than his father. His coloring after
all had not resembled that of his Uncle Ben, but that of the male
Wilsons. His smooth hair was sandy, his eyes were pale and cold.
His beard was sprouting, so that a weekly shaving came at once
too often and too seldom, which distressed him. He was particular
about his cleanliness and his clothing, complained that he was
not well enough dressed. Yesterday, in preparation for the Friday
night school dance at the Academy in Peytonville, he had doused
himself with Nellie's lavender toilet water, was in a rage to
find the scent, too late, unsuitable. His adolescent surliness
had hardened, he was a crude block of stone the sculptor had not
yet finished. Yet the chisel marks, his father was unhappily
certain, already indicated an ultimate ruthlessness of
character.</p>

<p>Ase helped himself to the home-corned beef and passed the
platter to Arent, sitting next him. Arent passed the platter to
Nat before helping himself.</p>

<p>'Melie snapped, "Hurry up, you greedy pigs. Ladies first."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Behave now, all of you."</p>

<p>Ase was ashamed that his lack of affection for 'Melie came so
close to actual dislike. She was the image of his mother with the
same spare frame, the same close-set black eyes and sleek black
hair. For better or for worse he loved his mother. He could not
bring himself to love this girl, so officious, so unduly
maternal, so sharp and cruel of tongue. 'Melie and Nat had always
sided together against the others. They shared a common hardness,
a similar and as yet unrevealed purpose. Ase sighed, eating
steadily without notice of what he ate.</p>

<p>Thank God, Ase thought, Nellie was done with childbearing. She
was more precious than the whole raft of them, except of course
for Dolly. The old gnawing pain assailed him. He was aroused by
laughter all around the table.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Pa, we've been holding the pie in front of your
nose for ten minutes."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now you know how your father is. He goes off
into a trance and isn't thinking at all, just dreaming about
nothing."</p>

<p>Ase felt a slow anger. He had an impulse to raise a great paw
like that of a bear, to brush them all aside. Then he was
ashamed. A father at table should join himself to the others,
whatever his private concerns. The breaking of bread together,
the sharing of salt, the eating of meat, was a sacred thing, one
small community against the outer darkness.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm sorry," and cut a wedge of pie, and could not
eat it.</p>

<p>He left the table and walked across the road. The apple
orchard was mature. Spring was early, the orchard was as he had
dreamed of it before its planting, as a parent dreams of an
unborn child, then finds the mien and character fulfilled. The
pink-and-white bloom was a sea. It spilled over the hillside in
rolling waves. The fragrance poured over him. He breathed of it
deeply, feeling cleansed. This too he had helped create. It was
beautiful and good.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Frost came on the first morning of October. Ase felt the clean
sharpness prick the hairs of his nostrils. Dolly had learned to
sing in her birdlike voice, "Jackie Frost, Jackie Frost, comes in
the night--." He hurried out of the house, as though he might
catch sight of that droll fellow Jack going away over the hill,
scattering from his paint brush the last of the white crystals.
He would have enjoyed living in pagan times, he thought. He had
read again and again in his encyclopedia of the ancient myths,
had found himself nodding in half agreement. It seemed a natural
thing to personify the seasons and the elements.</p>

<p>He stood at the edge of the road between the house and the
barns. He looked out over the fields, the meadows, the planted
crops. The sky was of a denim blue, the frost was melting under
the golden sun, the corn was golden, too, the pumpkins orange,
and all his land was brilliant in a great glory.</p>

<p>He did his chores at the barn. He had not engaged a hired man
this summer, paying, instead, the wages to Nat and a lesser
amount to Arent. He had also given Nat the use of one of the best
fields, to raise a bean crop for himself, to add to the available
cash for his entrance this fall to the state university. It had
been hard to give up his hope that Nat would study agriculture,
having rejected the arts and professions, for the Linden lands
were proving more and more profitable, so that there could be a
good living here for all. Yet Nat had insisted that he would
consider nothing except a business course. Well, Ase thought,
every man must work out his own destiny and Nat was almost a
man.</p>

<p>He took the milk to Nellie at the house. Nat and Arent were
finishing their breakfast. He sat down at the table for his
own.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Pa, I can't get those damn beans shelled and sold
in time to get to the university. You expect too much of a
fellow."</p>

<p>Ase took a mouthful of sausage. Nat should be grateful, he
thought, that the bean crop had been so heavy. It would mean that
he need not, his first year at college, do outside chores to pay
for his living, beyond the tuition for which Ase was paying.
There was a taint on Nat, he could not put his finger on it, but
it seemed to him that Nat asked for a great deal in return for
nothing. Ase thought of his own long years of toil, he recalled
his own meagre schooling. More schooling, more education, access
to more books, that must be the answer, so that a man learned all
there was to know of the world, of mankind, of ideas, of the
relation of man to the outer cosmos. If Nat could learn the
things that had been denied to him, Nat could go on where he had
been obliged, because of his ignorance, to leave off.</p>

<p>Nat repeated, "You expect too much."</p>

<p>Ase lifted his head. He studied his son, his first-born. The
boy's face was clouded and surly. No, Ase thought, it isn't that
at all, I have asked too little. It seemed to him a crucial
moment. Yet there had been others and each time the moment had
eluded him. But he could not find the words with which to speak,
he had never been able to find them. And if he had ever and
always spoken, would Nat have ever listened? Was each individual
character implicit, fixed even before birth, so that every man
went his own tormented way and could never be guided by another,
equally tormented, toward the truth? He could only help his son
at this moment in an entirely practical way.</p>

<p>"Why, Nat," he said, "I can give you a hand today. I can spare
Arent to help you, too."</p>

<p>They left the breakfast table together and went to the barn
for the shelling, in Eric's homemade machine, of Nat's crop of
beans. The beans were shelled, were put into sacks, were ready to
be hauled to market. The crop was large indeed. Nat's first year
at college was assured.</p>

<p>Nat was excited and happy at the supper table. He talked
sensibly of his plans. Before his eyes, Ase saw the cracking of
the shell that was the boy, saw the man inside, as the hard
chrysalis splits to release the locust. "Seventeen-year locust,"
Ase thought, and smiled to himself. Nat was possessed of power.
Ase felt a moment of relief for his son. However the boy used
himself, he was one who would make his way. The world would never
swallow him as it had swallowed Benjamin.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Pa, if we take the beans to Trent tomorrow, why
can't I take the train straight on from there to the college?
I'll need a few days to buy things and get settled, find a room.
I'd like to size things up a little ahead of time."</p>

<p>Ase had already been thinking over Nat's transportation.</p>

<p>He said, "No reason why I can't take you all the way."</p>

<p>Nat frowned.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Pa. I'd rather sort of go in alone. That's not so,
well, countrified."</p>

<p>Nellie said sharply, "See here now, Nat Linden, I won't have
any boy nonsense about acting ashamed of a farm. Or your father.
When he's dressed up, he's a fine looking man, good as any banker
I've ever seen."</p>

<p>It was true, in his Sunday best Asahel Linden was
distinguished. Being unconscious of his appearance, he wore his
black gabardine, starched white shirt and black string tie,
casually. Nellie saw to it that sleeves and trousers were long
enough.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Oh, I know, Pa's all right, but shucks, imagine
driving up in a wagon."</p>

<p>He grinned at his mother.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose you'd let me have Queenie and the rubber-tired
buggy, would you? And the light sleigh later? Come on, Ma, you
won't be using them much this winter."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do, Nat. If you make good marks and behave
yourself, maybe when you come home for Christmas."</p>

<p>"You know," he said. "I don't suppose you remember, but when I
was about knee high to a grasshopper you and Grandmother told me
that when I made enough money, I could have a horse and buggy of
my own."</p>

<p>"No, I don't remember."</p>

<p>Ase remembered. He remembered very well indeed.</p>

<p>'Melie said, "Nat, you going to college to learn to make
money, or to drive girls around?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a little of both."</p>

<p>The family laughed together. Ase was disappointed not to be
taking Nat all the way.</p>

<p>Nellie worked late into the night, washing and ironing and
mending odds and ends of Nat's clothing. In the end, he left most
of it for Arent. One portmanteau held all he considered fit for
his new life. Ase watched the packing, feeling the need of making
his son some special gift, tangible or intangible. There was
advice he should offer him, perhaps, but he could think of none
worth giving or that Nat would accept. At breakfast, he drew from
his pocket his own father's heavy gold hunter's watch and laid it
beside Nat's plate. Nat lifted it and balanced its weight on his
open palm.</p>

<p>"Thanks, no, Pa. Nobody carries these old-fashioned things any
more. Lot of gold in it, though. Maybe I could trade it in on a
new one."</p>

<p>Nellie reached for the watch and handed it back to Ase. Nat
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>She said, "Now say goodbye nicely to your grandmother. You
were always her favorite."</p>

<p>"She probably won't know me."</p>

<p>"She knows more than she lets on. Do as I tell you."</p>

<p>Ase wondered at Nellie's sharpness. Nat was her favorite, too.
He decided that she was only shielding herself against the pain
of his going, the first out of the nest. Since his trip today was
to be only on business, and brief at that, in the dusty wholesale
feed and grain warehouse at Trent, Ase was dressed cleanly and
decently in his second-best. He hitched the team to the already
loaded wagon while Nat paid his visit to Amelia.</p>

<p>Beside him on the seat, Nat said, "Grandmother thought I was
Uncle Ben, going away. I guess you'll be in for it again."</p>

<p>The drive to Trent seemed to Ase unduly brief. Nat watched
closely over the weighing of the dried beans and haggled for a
higher price. He put out his hand greedily for the thick roll of
bills.</p>

<p>"Damn," he said, "I haven't got anything but my pocket to keep
it in."</p>

<p>Ase took out his new leather wallet and emptied it. His old
worn one would do him as well. Nat accepted the gift with
satisfaction, filled it with most of the money, stuffing a few
small bills in his trousers pockets, and patted his hand over the
wallet in his inside breast pocket.</p>

<p>"This is one country boy that isn't going to get his pockets
picked," he said.</p>

<p>The original agreement on the bean crop had been that Nat was
to have the net profits. The cost of the seed and extra manure
for fertilizer bought from the Grimstedt's had been not
inconsiderable. Ase was unwilling to remind Nat of this. He was
glad to contribute that much more over the crop itself, as well
as the cash he had given him. Nat had considered it a hardship as
it was, to do more than his usual amount of summer work, even
though his father had paid him at a higher rate than for an
ordinary hired man.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Ready to go to the station?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother, Pa. You start on home. I'll amble around town
for a while."</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Tell Ma to keep the cookies coming. See you at
Christmas."</p>

<p>He strolled away whistling. From the back, he looked very like
Benjamin. Yet in the idleness of his gait, there was purpose. Ase
lifted the reins and slapped them lightly over the horses' backs
and turned onto the road toward home. Perhaps some time he and
Nellie might go together to visit Nat at college. Spring would be
a good time, when they could use the surrey, and Nellie would do
them proud in her Easter ruffles. It was foolish to have this
yearning to see his son walk for the first time through the door
of a great institution of learning. He had always pictured vast
gates that swung silently wide to give a glimpse of glory. No
doubt it would be like any other door.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c28">XXVIII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Lindens sat at early supper on a sharp November evening.
The sunset was reflected bronze and blue in the east. Lamps were
not yet needed. Nat's absence had changed the character of the
family for the first time since the death of Doll. There was no
quarreling at table. Young 'Melie's dominance over Arent and
Willis was complete. Her orders and critical comments were
accepted so meekly that their sharpness was dissipated like smoke
up a chimney. It had been Nat, Ase realized, who always started
the rows and trouble, 'Melie fighting him to begin with, then
veering around to his side when any of the others attacked him
with childish words or fists.</p>

<p>'Melie said, "Arent, for heaven's sake, sit up straight.
You're lying down over your plate like an old sow."</p>

<p>He said sullenly, "I'm tired."</p>

<p>He was growing too fast, Ase thought. He could remember the
fatigue of the mid-teens, when the vast quantities of food a boy
ate pushed his bones daily almost out of their sockets, drove the
rich and puzzled blood like a consuming fire through brain and
glands, leaving him exhausted. There was something else. Arent
missed Nat grievously.</p>

<p>Ase understood this, too. He recalled the first time Ben had
left home, his own desolation. Yet Arent, oddly, had no actual
love or even affection for his older brother. His loss now was
negative, not positive. It was as though his own nature were
empty, and the overflow of Nat's vitality filled and completed
it. He was a shallow stream that had no existence without the
deep spring to feed it. He was the shadow without the body. Ase
felt a sudden anxiety for the boy, greater than for Nat, for
up--or down--whatever rough or devious roads Nat might choose to
make his way, Arent would be obliged to follow, a puppet moved by
the strong hand of his master, a small soul born to be a
henchman.</p>

<p>Ase looked at the unhappy boy, embarrassed by his flash of
perception. Arent was nondescript of coloring. There had been no
one on the Wilson or Linden side of the family so drab. He was
more inclined to colds than the other children, but was healthy,
and at fifty would probably look very much as he looked at
fifteen, a man who would pass unnoticed in any crowd. Ase looked
on down the table to 'Melie, officiously cutting up meat for
Willis. She too, now nearly fourteen, would be little different
at forty. Her resemblance to her grandmother was more striking
every year, except that she would make a handsomer woman and if
possible a harder.</p>

<p>Outsiders, even the Wilsons, all spoke of 'Melie as "such a
little mother." True, she fussed and clucked over Willis, even
over Arent, like a pullet with her first brood, but she seemed to
Ase to be motivated not by any tender maternalism but by her need
to dominate. To her own offspring, he thought, she might well
seem more the stepmother of fable. He could not even quite
imagine her with children of her own. Like Nat, she would always,
he felt, make her way, the same question applying to the way she
chose. For Nat and 'Melie would do their choosing.</p>

<p>He turned his study to Willis with puzzled tenderness. Young
as he was, at ten, he had an odd independence, quite different
from that of Nat and 'Melie, and with somehow a greater
integrity. Yet he too stayed aloof from his father, with no
antagonism such as Nat's, with, indeed, a casual friendliness,
but giving the impression that he had looked to his father for
something that was not there and now would look no longer. Ase
remembered his advances to Willis, even in the days of his
absorption with Doll. He recalled holding Willis on his bony
knees, and the child's politeness, watching his chance to slip
away and play with the endless kittens. It seemed, simply, that
the strange flame of communication had never been lighted between
them.</p>

<p>Nellie was determined that Willis should not be the spoiled
baby of the family. She handled him with the firm but
dispassionate wisdom she had given the other children. Her
discipline was occasionally menaced by their taking her for
accomplice rather than mother, especially after one of her madcap
pranks. Ase sometimes thought of them as children together, she
the eldest and most dearly beloved. But she was still all woman,
her fire having subsided to a comfortable glow, rather to his
relief. There had been many times after a hard day in the fields
when Nellie had been almost too much for him.</p>

<p>He looked at her dotingly. Her added plumpness, the all but
invisible touch of gray in her gold-chestnut hair, made her in
his eyes more delightful than ever. He realized that her
expression now was dangerously demure and that the children were
giggling. For dessert, she had, along with the stewed Damson
plums, baked cupcakes in frilled papers. He had a cake in his
hand, ready for his mouth, paper and all. He dropped his hand and
the children burst into laughter.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now you shouldn't have stopped him. When your Pa
goes off into his trances, he isn't thinking about anything, and
he'd enjoy paper much as anything else."</p>

<p>Arent alone seemed not entirely amused. He shuffled his feet
restlessly.</p>

<p>He said, "Pa, I don't see why I have to keep going to school.
History, geography, reading and writing, all that stuff, it won't
do me any good when I go into business with Nat."</p>

<p>He was parroting these words from Nat, Ase knew, yet Nat
himself had been desperately anxious to go to the State
university. Neither Nat nor Arent was a good scholar, but both
managed to master the necessary subjects, Nat in particular. Ase
had the unhappy thought that Nat planned deliberately always to
keep Arent a few steps behind him, the better to use him later
for his obscure purposes.</p>

<p>He wanted to say, "Life is a difficult matter, and the more a
simple man may learn of what greater men have thought, and
taught, have spoken and have written, the better can he cope with
any sort of life."</p>

<p>He was still pondering when Nellie said, "Ase, the boy's
right. He doesn't like school, he doesn't like the farm, either.
He can just as well get a job near Nat."</p>

<p>'Melie said, "Maybe Nat wouldn't want him tagging on to his
coat tails. Interfering with girls. He might be just a nuisance.
Pa, you know it, I'm smarter than Arent, can't I go to
college?"</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I'll give you all the college you'll need right
here in this house. You've got to learn to bake a lighter cake if
you're not to shame your husband."</p>

<p>"Maybe I won't get married. Maybe I'll be a school
teacher."</p>

<p>This seemed plausible to Ase, though again, he would feel
sorry for her pupils.</p>

<p>He said, "You can go to college if you want to, 'Melie, when
the time comes."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "A lot can happen to a girl in four years. You'll
be having beaux by then, if you'll stop acting so bossy. The boys
don't like that."</p>

<p>"Some of them do. You boss Pa, lots of ways, and he likes
it."</p>

<p>Ase smiled his rare slow smile.</p>

<p>He said, "Child, your mother does it such a pretty way.
There's the difference."</p>

<p>Arent returned doggedly to his theme.</p>

<p>"How about it, Pa? Can't I quit the Academy at Christmas and
get a job near Nat?"</p>

<p>"No, son. Finish your high school and then we'll see."</p>

<p>Undressing for bed, Nellie said, "Ase, you might as well let
the boy go. Ben finished the Academy and what good did it do him?
Seems to me an education's no use if you don't want it."</p>

<p>He could not refute this. Yet a boy of fifteen knew neither
what he wanted nor needed. Or did he, if he burned with such a
secret flame as, for instance, had Dolly, who could never have
enough of learning? Or as Eric Svenson, Hulda's brother.</p>

<p>As though she read his mind, Nellie continued, "Or take Eric
on the other hand. He was hell-bent on college, and look what he
got for his trouble."</p>

<p>Her reasoning was specious, for Eric had been the victim
merely of incredibly bad luck. Ase had encouraged the young
Swede, during his summer as hired man, in his ambition to
graduate in engineering, in his dream for designing such bridges,
such buildings, as had never been seen before. It was an
architect he was meant to be, but neither the blond boy nor his
grave mentor, so few years older, understood the distinction.
Eric had moved on from the Linden farm, with his summer's savings
and Ase's parting gift, to a factory job, there to make higher
wages and larger savings toward his goal. A careless fellow
worker had caught Eric's hands in a machine, crushing the
fingers, so that factory work was as impossible as the dream of
draftsmanship. Eric had returned of necessity to his father's
farm, to till the land quietly and bitterly with his maimed
hands. Ase had hired him occasionally. Eric worked for lower
wages than the average, as there were many chores, such as
milking, that he was unable to do.</p>

<p>Ase said to Nellie, "Very well. We'll let Arent go. I'll hire
Eric again."</p>

<p>He drove Arent to the train the following Saturday. The boy
showed more enthusiasm than his father had ever seen in him. Nat
was the breath of life to him. It was touching, Ase felt, and he
thought of his own vanished brother with the familiar pain.
Perhaps he had done properly after all in letting Arent follow
Nat. Yet he was again disturbed by the vacuity of Arent's nature,
needing his brother not for love, but because without him he was
nothing. Now he might never stand on his own feet. The
relationship was even more dangerous for Nat. It seemed to Ase
that he became increasingly harder and more arrogant as he fed on
Arent's paler substance.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand in farewell after the train, but Arent did
not look back from platform or from window. He was glad that he
had brought Willis at the last moment, noticing the ten-year-old
watching wistfully the preparations for departure.</p>

<p>He said now to him, "We'll miss the boys."</p>

<p>Willis said, "They won't miss us."</p>

<p>The comment was matter of fact, as though an old man spoke
without malice of love's unrequitals. Ase looked down at the boy,
surprised. Willis had always eluded him. In a surge of affection,
he hoped it might still not be too late for communication. He
forced himself to speak more fully than was usual for him,
thinking that this unknown son was strangely adult, and he must
so address him.</p>

<p>"It's been a disappointment to me that Nat only cares about
business. I'm sorry that Arent doesn't want to go to school."</p>

<p>Long-pent ideas surged in him, of a man's need to learn all
possible that may be taught, of the values of life, whereby a
preoccupation with money seemed an ignoble thing to him, of the
greater nobility of labor with the soil, of the dreams of men, to
add to the force and beauty of all human living, those dreams too
often, as with Eric Svenson, inexplicably destroyed.</p>

<p>"A man lives a short time, but a long time, too. He
needs--"</p>

<p>He faltered, and as always, could not go on.</p>

<p>He gathered himself and asked, "What do you want to do,
Willis? If you like farming, you can go to the agricultural
college. You might want to be a doctor. A lawyer. Have you
thought about it?"</p>

<p>The boy leaned forward in the buggy, examining his copper-toed
shoes, retreating into his shell.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he said. "Anything's all right."</p>

<p>He should question further, Ase thought, no, he should avoid
questioning like the plague, should instead somehow stir this shy
male child to a willing revelation.</p>

<p>He could only say, "I'll help you with anything you want to
do."</p>

<p>Willis repeated, "It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>The buggy drew up at the Svenson house. Eric came to meet
it.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I need you again, Eric. Can you come?"</p>

<p>He was shocked by the appearance of the man. His shoulders
sagged, his lean Norse features were haggard, his once blond
shock of hair was matted, and of the gray of dead seaweed, as
though despair had washed over him in a last battering wave. He
was five years younger than Ase, whose hair at forty was still
raven black.</p>

<p>He said, "Yes, sir. Be glad to."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Eric, would you like to stay this time, for good? I
think I've lost Nat and Arent."</p>

<p>The unhappy eyes lightened, then were again beaten and
cautious.</p>

<p>"I might as well. I'm not needed here, now the new crop of
Svensons is coming along."</p>

<p>Of the large Swedish brood, Eric and Hulda alone had never
married. There were nieces and nephews at work on the expanding
farm. Hulda had not found "a husband to buy," but Ase wondered
why Eric was still a bachelor. He had been a handsome young man,
and no loving and proper woman would reject him for his hands.
The reason must be his fitful earnings, his inability to provide
a roof over their heads, necessary to marriage, where love alone
needed only a hedge-row. As occasional hired hand at other
places, Eric, he knew, often slept in shed or barn. At the Linden
farm he had always occupied a small room on the second story of
the house, above the woodshed.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Eric, if you come to stay, there's no reason why
you can't have the log cabin."</p>

<p>The man gripped his arm with a twisted hand in what seemed
almost an attack.</p>

<p>He said, "Do you mean that, Mr. Linden?"</p>

<p>He answered himself at once.</p>

<p>"You mean it. You never say anything you don't mean."</p>

<p>He brushed a sleeve across his grimed and sweating face.</p>

<p>"I'd given up. There's a girl--."</p>

<p>He looked away a moment, into a past desolate space.</p>

<p>"Of course, she isn't a girl any more. She's a woman, she's as
old as I am. She's turned gray, too. She's waited for me all
these years. She didn't care whether we ate or starved, as long
as it was together. There wasn't any way I could manage it."</p>

<p>He was fierce again, his face close.</p>

<p>"Your cabin, what it means--. She'll be with me."</p>

<p>He smiled in apology.</p>

<p>"But you know what it means."</p>

<p>Yes, he knew, but he could envy Eric the woman who would
starve with him, if it was together. He decided to pay him full
wages and to give him some breeding stock for his own, a heifer,
pigs and chickens. There would always be enough Linden fruits and
vegetables to share. It would be good to have Eric in the cabin,
so long empty, so long haunted by bitterness.</p>

<p>Ase was surprised that evening to find Nellie snappish on the
subject.</p>

<p>"You'll be over there half the time, jawing and yarning," she
said. "I thought when Tim McCarthy died I was done with your
chums."</p>

<p>He stared at her. Then he turned away his face, to smile. An
ancient puzzle was explained. Nellie, astonishingly, for no
female could have disturbed her, had been jealous of Tim. The
male community was offensive, for into it no woman could ever
enter.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c29">XXIX</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The only wonder, Ase thought, was that such a year had been so
long in coming. Catastrophe after catastrophe struck the crops. A
man working with the land might expect disaster at any time. He
had escaped it better than many of his neighbors. His instinct
for weather changes, strengthened by the lore of Mink Fisher the
Indian, had often led him to plant a crop earlier than was
customary, or when other landsmen said it was too late, and the
seasons had been harmonious with him and proved him right. Now
there seemed no benignity left in nature.</p>

<p>The spring came early. The apple orchard was a foam of
blossom. The wind veered one April day, the sun withdrew, a
norther roared down with sleet and bitter cold, and when it
passed, the orchard was a stricken thing, bereft of bloom and
hope of harvest. There would be no plums, no cherries, no
peaches. The winter wheat lay flailed to the ground and would not
rise again. Half the crop of spring lambs perished in the sudden
and unseemly cold. Eric worked through two nights with him,
saving the remainder. No hours were too long, no labor too hard
for him. The man was luminous with happiness. His middle-aged
bride had transformed the dark log cabin into a house of bright
Swedish reds and blues and yellows. Her plain sweet face was as
glowing as his.</p>

<p>To compensate for the loss of major cash crops, Ase doubled,
working with Eric a twenty-hour day, his plantings of beans, of
potatoes, of corn. These were well sprouted when two weeks of
rain turned the fields to sodden mud, and the young green sprouts
and cotyledons turned yellow, then gray, and merely disappeared.
The previous winter's store of root vegetables, of home-canned
fruits and vegetables, was eaten to the last crock of apple
butter. It was necessary to buy almost everything from
Peytonville, even feed for the stock, at new high prices. Ase
sold everything he could spare, lambs, calves, poultry, pigs. He
replanted the drowned-out house garden and fought through the wet
summer for every carrot, every beet and turnip. His cash reserves
were dangerously depleted and life was almost a matter of
immediate survival. It was necessary to keep money aside for the
next winter wheat. With no broad acres of crops to be worked and
harvested, Nat and Arent took summer jobs in Trent.</p>

<p>The price of seed wheat soared. When it was paid for, allowing
an extra acreage this time in an attempt to recoup, Ase checked
over his balance in the Peytonville bank, the remaining currency
in the tin box, and found himself perilously short. The family
would not starve, it would not go cold nor unclothed, but there
would be no amenities, and Nat would have to finance his second
year of college by himself. Eric's wages would be a steady drain.
Dismissing him was out of the question. The log cabin was the
rock on which he was building his life. Ase looked over his
account ledger. He had not realized that Nat had called on him so
often the past winter for extra money. Twenty-five dollars here,
fifty there, it amounted to several hundred dollars. His mother
and Willis had been sickly. Dr. Holder had come often and
prescribed expensive tonics.</p>

<p>Aunt Jess the midwife had been ill and unable to work at her
profession. He had taken money to her and arranged for paying a
girl to stay with her until she should recover. There were other
items, too, a contribution to the struggling high school Academy
in Peytonville. He had said nothing about these things to Nellie
or to Amelia. They made a considerable amount, more than he could
afford. He pushed the ledger away and asked himself why he had
not felt free to tell his wife and his mother that he was,
actually, robbing them of their deserved comforts. He
acknowledged to himself his fear of his mother's sharp tongue and
greediness. Yet Nellie had been always so generous with stray
tramps, with the gypsies, the bounty of her table was fabled, for
any and for all. And she had sent Hulda home with the first
tightening of his finances. He looked up from his ledgers. Eric
stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Worse than you thought, isn't it, Mr. Linden?"</p>

<p>"We'll manage somehow, Eric."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have let you pay me wages all spring. I'd work
for nothing now, but I can't. But I've got things figured out. I
can have a job hauling lumber at Peytonville, if you'll spare me
the mare to ride back and forth. That way, I can give you a hand
night and morning, and still make my wages outside, until things
get better for you."</p>

<p>Ase said slowly, "That would relieve me, Eric. But I couldn't
let you give me help without pay."</p>

<p>Eric's blue eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Then I'd have to pay you rent on the cabin, and I can't
afford to. Elsa and I can't give it up. We're having a baby in
November."</p>

<p>The man's delight was almost a tangible aura. There was
something else, Ase sensed, beyond a normal pride in paternity.
Eric had returned to his rightful share in man's hope. Life had
failed him, but it would surely never fail his child.</p>

<p>Ase rose and shook hands gravely.</p>

<p>He said, "Good luck," having in mind the perhaps dangerous
maturity of the mother in childbirth, the forever dangerous fact
of every new life, and Eric, understanding this, gripped tight
and grateful.</p>

<p>"I'll begin the hauling job day after tomorrow, Mr.
Linden."</p>

<p>July was perversely dry. The earth hardened and cracked. Ase
and Nellie carried bucket after bucket of well water to the
garden each evening. 'Melie and Willis doled it out around the
plants with dippers, making a game, stopping to dabble in the
momentary pools, so that Ase was usually obliged to finish the
job himself before going late to his chores. The small garden
fruits, the currants, the gooseberries, the raspberries and
strawberries, turned shriveled and seedy. Nellie complained of
the quality of the jam. She used honey in making it, to save the
price of sugar.</p>

<p>There were two days of bright sun toward the end of the month.
The fodder grasses, the rye and clover and timothy, dried enough
for mowing. On the third morning, Ase hitched the team to the
mowing machine by lantern light, to be ready with the first
nebulous gray before the dawn. Even the birds had not yet aroused
from sleep. He made a round of the lower pasture field before the
robins began their harsh twittering. With the first faint glow in
the east, only a prescience of sunrise, as though someone
approached from far away with a lifted lamp, the meadow larks
took to the air, disturbed by the machine rather than the day,
for which they were not ready. They circled but did not soar,
spoke but did not sing. The grasses were heavy with the dew and
made hard mowing. But the sun rose clear and golden, the mown
grass steamed and would soon dry, and Ase clucked to the horses
to move at a faster gait. They were almost too fresh from weeks
of inactivity. They broke into a trot, the whirling blades of the
mower could not keep the pace, became clogged. Ase was obliged to
saw on the lines with all his strength to slow down the team, to
save a fatal breakdown of the machine.</p>

<p>A cloud passed over the sun. It moved away to the south in a
moment, leaving the light somehow less dazzling. Ase felt that he
was racing the sun, an ant against an antelope. He would not take
time for breakfast. At eight o'clock he tied the team to the
fence, for rest, and went to the barn to do the chores. Nellie
was there, milking. Her curly head leaned against the flank of
the brindle cow, her hands looked to him like frail leaves
fluttering under the big udder, but her small strong fingers were
pumping milk from the teats in a steady stream. She turned her
head and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Bet you thought I'd forgotten how to milk."</p>

<p>He tousled her hair.</p>

<p>"Go on to the house, Nellie. I'll finish now."</p>

<p>"I'm almost done. Eric did a lot before he left. I've got the
poultry fed and watered. Go eat your breakfast. It's keeping hot
on the back of the stove."</p>

<p>He had said nothing to her of the need for hurry, but she had
understood and gone casually to do a man's work. The love in him
for her swelled like the willow stream in flood.</p>

<p>"No, Nellie, let me finish."</p>

<p>"Look at your dirty hands. I'll be through with the stripping
before you could get them washed. Go on, now."</p>

<p>He could not leave her. He would never again envy Eric his
Elsa. He squatted on his haunches and watched her, saw the sweat
come out on her forehead, and loved the dampening of her curls.
He forgot for the moment his anxieties and his danger. She stood
up from the milking stool and wrinkled her nose fastidiously at
her hands, holding them in front of her.</p>

<p>"I'll gather up the eggs, guess I won't get them smelly. You
take the milk buckets to the house."</p>

<p>"You can come back for the eggs."</p>

<p>"Want your breakfast dished up in style. I know."</p>

<p>It was not that he wanted his breakfast served, but that he
could not spare her out of his sight, not just now. She darted
ahead of him, and by the time he reached the kitchen with the
milk and had washed up and combed his hair, his late breakfast
was on the table. He coaxed her into sitting with him and she
sipped at a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>She said, "Think you can get the hay in before it rains again?
Weather still acts sort of peculiar."</p>

<p>He was jerked back painfully to the hay, to the weather, to
the fractious team waiting for him. He rose from the table. He
leaned over her and kissed her throat.</p>

<p>"Ase, for heaven's sake, we're getting to be old folks. Save
it for bedtime, anyway."</p>

<p>"Little Nellie Wilson--" he said.</p>

<p>She would always be younger than he. It would offend her to
know that what drew him to her now was not amorousness, but some
deep need of physical contact, as for a mated pair of animals
huddled together against a storm. He went back to the mowing of
the hay. Nellie brought him food at noon, to save time, brought
grain and water for the team of horses. The sun was strong all
the afternoon. The swathes of grass fell in half circles behind
the blades of the machine, drew in the warmth and dryness, were
ready to be taken to barn to nourish the stock through the coming
winter. Ase kept at the mowing until the late summer twilight. If
he had not been obliged to let Eric go, if Nat and Arent had been
with him for help, the felled and valuable fodder would have been
already raked into piles for stowing in the loft. The sun set
angrily. Ase put away the team, the machine, did the evening
chores, and went to the house for supper.</p>

<p>Nellie had a finer meal than usual for their time of dearth.
She sent the children to bed early. She took Amelia her supper
tray and retrieved it shortly. Ase was torn between a sigh and a
smile. He was exhausted, yet he gloried that he was still able to
give her some portion of a meagre happiness.</p>

<p>He was up early the next morning to go on with the mowing. On
studying the sky, he changed his mind. He decided to rake as far
as he had already mown. The hay rake was a one-horse affair and
he could spell off the two horses, having overworked them the day
before. The job took less than half as long as the mowing. The
day was cloudy but dry. In mid-afternoon, he called Nellie to
help him begin to load. He needed badly a second man to pitch
with him, but she could easily take the place of the customary
grown boy who stood on the load and evened and trampled the hay.
She put on an old pair of Arent's jeans and tied a bandana over
her hair. She pranced up and down the load. She could not help
him when it came to pitching the hay from the wagon up into the
loft of the barn. This was back-breaking work for a man alone,
with no respite. The next day was Sunday, and Eric worked with
him from sunup to sundown. Six loads were safe in the loft when
night came, and with the night, again, the rain. Two days ruined
the hay remaining on the ground. It turned black and soft and
moldy. The rains began once more in August. They opened gullies
along the granite ribs of the sheep pasture. The brook rose high,
foamed and boiled. The lower branches of the weeping willows were
drenched and muddied, untidy as matted hair. The grasses grew
rank. Wild blackberries were swollen and insipid.</p>

<p>The weather cleared and Ase mowed the short hay in the high
pasture without trouble but the amount would not see the stock
through the winter. In early September he went to the marsh along
the willow stream. The marsh grass was coarse and not too
nutritious, but Mink Fisher had told him many years ago that it
made good fodder in bad times. The Indians had often used it for
their ponies. He moved slowly across the marsh, swinging the big
hand scythe rhythmically, cautious against deep hidden pools of
water and against the equally hidden small rattlesnakes. These
had once infested the marsh by the hundreds and as a boy he had
sometimes killed as many as thirty in one day. He smiled to
himself, remembering that his father had paid him a penny a
snake. He had been rich for weeks. Of late years, the hogs had
kept the snakes down to a modest number. He stepped back as a
triangular head lifted beyond his feet, then sheared it off
neatly with his scythe. He hauled the marsh hay bundle by bundle,
by hand, to higher ground, for availability in loading the wagon.
He refused to let Nellie help this time, for a few rattlers
managed to tuck themselves inside the bundles. These he killed
with the pitchfork. The season's hay was all of poor quality but
it would see him through.</p>

<p>He went next to the sowing of the winter wheat. Eric gave him
early and late hours of unpaid-for time. The weather immediately
following was propitious and the grain sprouted and seemed
established. The home harvest was better than he had expected.
There were enough potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, pumpkin
and squash to make respectable piles in the root house and in the
cellar. The fall crop of nuts was good. He and Nellie and the
children made picnic outings on bright October days to gather the
butternuts, the hazel and black walnut, the hickory nuts. He
butchered hogs early and hung more than usual of hams and sides
in the smokehouse. Nellie put down half a dozen large crocks of
salt pork in brine. When the snowy slices were dipped in flour
and fried golden brown, served with potatoes boiled in their
jackets and rich milk gravy, the meal was savored by all the
family except Amelia. When Nellie had only such "common" food she
prepared some special delicacy for the querulous old woman. They
would all miss the apples through the winter, but on the whole,
Ase felt a new hope that they would come through to spring not
too uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of October Nat and Arent came home to get
their clothes in order. Ase had warned Nat early that he could
give him no help toward his second year of college. Nat had saved
most of his summer's wages. Ase was relieved and surprised, for
Nat had always assumed that his father could produce extra money
when he really cared to.</p>

<p>Nat explained, "I decided I'd rather get the work out of the
way this summer. I wouldn't like this business of waiting on
tables and stoking furnaces for the rich fellows. They call the
working boys slavies and stuff like that."</p>

<p>Ase said mildly, "Mr. Lincoln split rails while he studied. He
made a pretty good name for himself."</p>

<p>Nat said, "Well, there must be easier ways of getting to be
president."</p>

<p>He was sullen that he dared not use any of his money for a new
winter suit. Arent had inherited his second-best suit and now he
would have to wear his one good one every day.</p>

<p>Ase said, "If I get a good price for the young stock, maybe at
Christmas--"</p>

<p>Nat's face lightened.</p>

<p>"Fine, Pa. Even twenty-five dollars will do me."</p>

<p>Thinking out his words beforehand, Ase talked with Arent to
convince him that he should enter college, too. If his lesser
amount of saved money was not enough, surely as a freshman he
need not share Nat's lofty feeling against working on the side.
The boy nodded.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Pa. Nobody notices me anyway when Nat's
around."</p>

<p>He spoke more with pride than resentment. It was enough for
him to trail behind his brother. Nat heard his name and joined
them and questioned them.</p>

<p>He said, "I tell you, Pa, it's too hard work for one thing, to
make a living and study, too. I've got a good job for Arent in
town, in a store. We'll live in my room together and between us
we'll have enough money to do things right. Why, I can teach
Arent at night myself. The first year stuff is easy."</p>

<p>The matter was settled. It was impossible to urge Arent
further. The promise of continuing to live with Nat so elated him
that he became deaf and blind to other arguments. Ase understood
wryly what would happen. Nat would never think again of teaching
Arent, was incapable of it in any case, and he would live well,
making the show he demanded, with the help of Arent's earnings.
As ruefully, Ase acknowledged to himself that it probably did not
much matter. Arent's cup was not only empty, it had a hole in it.
Even the modest education of the Academy had gone in one ear and
out the other.</p>

<p>Ase had not entirely given up hope for Nat's development. The
boy had made good marks his first year, especially in history and
economics. Perhaps he would find a professor who would stir him,
some wise man of books who would open for him, as he himself had
been incompetent to do, the world of the mind beyond its
commercial application.</p>

<p>"History certainly teaches you, Pa," Nat had said, and Ase had
felt excitement mount in him, and had leaned forward eagerly to
listen.</p>

<p>Nat had continued, "Why, you can see where business and
political leaders made their mistakes. The depression wasn't
necessary. Cleveland proved that. Even then, a smart man could
have seen what was happening, and bought stuff low, and held it,
and then sold it high. I tell you, I wouldn't take anything for
history."</p>

<p>Ase had left Nat abruptly. What did he mean by "stuff"? He
used the word constantly. Yet it was gratifying to find that the
boy had a good mind, as strong and vital as his body. He was
young, he could change, and if not a man of letters, perhaps the
right wife would tone down his stridency. Perhaps his own
children would teach him a more basic humanity. Ase drove his two
sons to Trent to take the train for the university city. The time
was still clement, so that they went in the surrey.</p>

<p>Nat said casually, "You could just as well drive us all the
way, Pa. See the college, too."</p>

<p>Some things, Ase thought, came too late. A year ago he had
yearned to feast his eyes at least on the portals. Nat had not
asked him and Nellie to come for a visit. Nat had been ashamed of
him then, collecting the bean money from the old wagon. He was
not ashamed of the surrey, as fine a carriage as anyone had. And
Nat no doubt had in mind the saving of the two railroad fares.
No, it was too late, something was soiled.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I'd better reach home tonight."</p>

<p>He added, ashamed of his evasion, although the fact was so,
"Your grandmother had another spell, I ought to be there."</p>

<p>Elsa bore her child in the log cabin in early November. Dr.
Holder attended her with Hulda's help. Aunt Jess was past
midwifery. It was a difficult birth, but Elsa made as light of it
as Nellie had always done. The baby was a girl. Ase had wondered
if Eric might not need and have wanted a son, further to have
restored himself. He was immediately reassured.</p>

<p>Eric said to him, drinking a toast of hard cider in the cabin
to the new-born babe, to the mother, "I'm glad it's a girl. A
girl can't possibly be as disappointed in life as a boy."</p>

<p>It seemed as though Eric had always been a part of the family.
Ase was comforted by his quiet presence, by the hour of help he
gave night and morning, by the sight of lamplight in the old
cabin, and smoke curling from the chimney.</p>

<p>November was cold and dry. There were wind storms, gales that
ripped branches from the trees, but with them, no beneficence of
rain. December turned unseasonably warm. Rain fell, and the
yellowing wheat shoots turned green again. There was no snow,
none at all. Without its protective covering, the wheat was at
the mercy of winter. Bitter cold moved in, the temperatures near
zero continued for a week. The wheat froze where it stood in its
nakedness. The soft snow that fell at last was wasted on the
empty fields.</p>

<p>Ase and Nellie sat on the sofa before the living-room stove.
The children were in bed. Amelia had been troublesome all day,
calling from her room for unneeded attention, but now seemed
asleep. Nellie turned the lamp low to save the oil. The belated
snow hissed like snakes against the window panes.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I'd better sell off most of the stock now."</p>

<p>"Won't bring as good a price as in the spring."</p>

<p>"I can't pay for feed through the winter, Nellie. Not with the
wheat gone and nothing coming in. We'll just keep the brood
stock."</p>

<p>"Ase, let's keep all the turkeys. Nobody raises them much for
market. I'll set all the eggs early. They can feed spring and
summer over the high hay field where there's always so many
grasshoppers."</p>

<p>"All right, if you want to bother."</p>

<p>Yet the problem was one of survival in the meantime.</p>

<p>He said, "I hate to disappoint Nat about money for his
suit."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have come so close to promising him."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>He put a chunk of maplewood in the stove. He had timber to
spare in both wood lots. He should have thought of this
before.</p>

<p>He began felling and cutting the next day in the snow. He
hauled the wood by the cord to Peytonville and disposed of it
easily. He sent the first twenty-five dollars to Nat and felt
somehow free. He made charcoal from the smaller wood. This too
had a ready market. All winter, when the snow was not too deep or
the winds too fierce, he hauled charcoal and cordwood to
Peytonville and peddled it from door to door. Nat was furious
when he heard of this through Nellie's casual mention in a
letter. To Ase it seemed as honorable a way as any for a man to
make a living. All men sold or traded the products of their
minds, their backs or hands, for subsistence. Wood was a clean
thing, as vital as food to human life, to warm and comfort. He
began filling his pockets with hazelnuts to give the children on
his route. They left their romping, their building of snowmen, to
run to his wagon in welcome.</p>

<p>He enjoyed their shrill, friendly cry, "Here's the wood
man!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The May sun forced the wet earth to give up its moisture. The
soil steamed. Ase stood in the sparse shade of the new-leafed
poplars before his house and looked out across his land. The blue
mist rising in the valleys seemed more like smoke. It swirled and
eddied, spiraled and lifted, and almost as he watched, was
absorbed into the pale gold light. He had finished the planting
of all his fields. Spring had come early, as though to compensate
for the past year's harshness. All signs had been of a continued
blandness. He had fallen back on his long established but never
used credit with Mr. Peyton, buying seed with abandon, since he
felt certain in his bones of a fine growing season. He had
planted summer wheat. The bean crop was in, the potatoes, the
barley and the buckwheat. He had even risked so early a planting
of corn, the oak leaves being the size of a squirrel's paws.</p>

<p>Easter vacation at the university had been late this year and
Nat and Arent had come home and given him ten days of priceless
help in turning the land, fertilizing, harrowing and laying out
the rows for the planting. A little money was left from the hard
winter and Eric interrupted his job to give him two weeks of
time. There had been enough rain and not too much, and any day
now the rich brown fields would sprout with the blessed green of
growth. He took a long breath of the sweet moist air. The Lindens
had come through a perilous time. There was still meat in the
smokehouse, the one milch cow he had kept was fresh, Nellie's
chickens and turkeys were laying heavily. The fruit trees were
ending a riotous bloom. The house garden was in, nursing secretly
the good vegetables and berries.</p>

<p>It was midmorning and there was no special thing Ase found
necessary to do. It was a moment of waiting. He thought of his
mother in her closed room. She was failing fast. She had been
oddly difficult all the winter and early spring. She had become
gentler in her increasing physical frailty, yet she called on him
more and more to listen to her rambling memories, where Benjamin
was sometimes confused with her husband, again, with Ase himself.
He went to her room and found her rocking in her favorite
chair.</p>

<p>He said, "It's a beautiful warm morning, Mother. Let me put
your chair out on the grass in the sun."</p>

<p>"Benjamin? No, no, I see it's Asahel. The sun? Why, yes,
everyone's kept me from the sun. Away from the sun."</p>

<p>"Come, Mother. Hold on to me while I move your chair."</p>

<p>He settled her under the poplars in half-shade.</p>

<p>She asked, "What time is it, Benjamin?"</p>

<p>He recognized that time for her, as for him, was not of the
hours of the day.</p>

<p>"It's springtime, Mother," he answered.</p>

<p>She was satisfied. He picked a spray of lily-of-the-valley
from the corner by the house and laid it in her translucent hand.
She sniffed it with pleasure.</p>

<p>She said, "Your brother Asahel gave me a bottle of toilet
water once when he was a little boy. It smelled like this. Do you
remember?"</p>

<p>He did not remember. He did not remember her when he was
young. Perhaps she had once been tender. He felt a sense of loss
for the mother she might have been.</p>

<p>She said, "Sit near me, son."</p>

<p>He stretched his long legs on the grass beside her chair. A
nesting wren dropped a straw. It fell on Amelia's head and he
lifted it away and stroked her hair. He yearned to go back with
her the more than forty years, to begin again. She closed her
eyes and seemed to drowse. He drew her shawl around her shoulders
and slipped away.</p>

<p>It was strange to have so little to do. Later, the days would
not be long enough to contain his labor and he would out-toil the
sun. He thought of his flute. He had not played it since Tim
McCarthy died. He was not sure where he had put it, it was not in
the hay mow, nor the carriage shed, he knew. He found it at last
in the bottom drawer of his dresser, wrapped safely in clean
linen, and this was Nellie's doing. He looked around for her. He
wanted to take her with him to a hilltop and play for her. He
heard her voice, high and furious, then caught sight of her in
the barnyard, flapping her apron at an equally angry setting hen.
It was no moment to approach her for what she called, in her
spells of sternness, his moony nonsense.</p>

<p>He felt foolish in any case, but he polished his flute and
ambled across the adjacent field to the rise overlooking the
willow stream and the bridge. Perhaps he had forgotten how to
play, or the flute might have lost its key, its tone, its
sweetness. He sat with his back against a broad maple trunk. A
turtle dove mourned from the woods nearby. He put the flute to
his lips to imitate the notes. The tone was as sweet as ever. He
had not forgotten. He played to the dove and it seemed to answer.
He played at random, careless phrases like the songs of birds. He
longed for Tim McCarthy. On such an idle day in May they would
have played their best together.</p>

<p>He was absorbed in his piping. He was not aware of the
stumbling figure until it was almost on him, as though it had no
previous existence but had materialized out of his tunes, drawn
by his flute. He stood awkwardly. For an instant more the figure
was a stranger. Mink Fisher lifted a hand to him.</p>

<p>No, Ase thought, he had never quite given Mink up. His reason
had told him, that winter day so long ago, that he should not see
his friend again. It was incredible that Mink had returned, yet
he was not astonished. The old man wavered, fell on his knees and
sprawled face down at Ase's feet. Ase knelt beside him and turned
him over gently. The breeze stirred the maple leaves. Light and
shadow flickered across the seamed bronze face.</p>

<p>Mink muttered, "Too far."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Just rest."</p>

<p>The Indian's breath came heavily. His eyes were closed. Ase
loosened the ragged blanket, fanned away a fly. Mink was old and
worn past belief. He had seemed ancient that other year but now
he was more mummy than man. The skin was taut over the high
cheekbones, the black hair that had then been grizzled was now
all the color of soiled snow. Ase took Mink's wrist in his hand,
to feel for the pulse, and it was as though he lifted the straw
that had fallen on Amelia's hair. He put his arms under the
emaciated body, rose easily with it, and carried it to the house.
Mink seemed little heavier than Doll had been. The breath of life
was almost the only difference.</p>

<p>He saw Amelia still sleeping in her chair under the poplars.
Nellie nor any of the children were in sight. He took Mink to the
back downstairs bedroom and laid him on the bed. The house was
cooler than the outdoors and he drew a cover over him. Mink
turned and moaned.</p>

<p>He mumbled, "Brother--. Son--."</p>

<p>Ase went to the kitchen stove where Nellie usually kept a
kettle of hot water boiling, to make tea or coffee. The stove was
cold. He went to a cupboard that held the medicinal whiskey and
poured out a quarter of a cup. Mink's teeth were clenched, but he
held open the old man's jaws and poured down the liquor.</p>

<p>Mink said, "Eat."</p>

<p>Ase felt the hair rising on the back of his neck. Mink was
starving. He went again to the kitchen. There was no food there,
but in the pantry he found bread and buttermilk. He mixed a bowl
and fed Mink spoonful by spoonful. Mink took it greedily. A
memory came to Ase of a trek he had made with the Indian in bad
weather, when they were without food for two days. On the third
day Mink had taken some small game, had cooked it for the boy
Ase, saying he was not himself hungry. Mink had gone then without
food for three days. How long had he been now without it? He
dared not feed him too heavily at first. He set the bowl aside.
He drew the shade at the window. He pulled a chair to the side of
the bed. Mink tried to speak.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Don't talk."</p>

<p>The old man closed his eyes again. Ase sat watching him. He
was torn by grief for him, with joy in the sight of him. A few
days of rest, of nourishment, and Mink might yet recover to have
a little while to sit with him in the sun, to talk together of
the old days. He could more easily then see his friend's spirit
return finally and peacefully into his forefathers' West from
which his wracked body had made its way.</p>

<p>He wondered if he should undress Mink now. Then he saw that he
was sleeping. It was best not to disturb him. He heard Nellie
come into the house, scolding one or another of the children. Her
sharp moods never lasted for long. He would tell her later of
Mink's presence. He left the bedroom and closed the door
cautiously behind him.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "What are you prowling around in there for?"</p>

<p>He felt like a boy trapped at the cookie jar. He could not lie
to her and simple evasion was almost as difficult for him. He
stood sheepishly. She spied the flute in his shirt pocket. She
laughed.</p>

<p>"You found it. I thought I heard flute music on the hill.
Don't look so silly, it sounded nice."</p>

<p>She had shed her crossness as suddenly as the clearing of an
April sky. He swallowed, his Adam's-apple bobbing, to prepare to
give his news.</p>

<p>She said, "Go get me a side of bacon from the smokehouse. I
fooled with that dratted hen so long, I've got to fix a mighty
quick meal. 'Melie, set the table for me, put on some raspberry
jam. Hurry now, both of you."</p>

<p>He was grateful for the respite. He was shaken by Mink
Fisher's arrival and by his condition, and now he would have a
little time to think of words that might help, instead of worsen,
the situation, for Nellie was bound to object. He brought the
bacon, washed up, and went to the front yard to help his mother
into the house. She was cheerful and rational.</p>

<p>"The sun did me good," she said. "I think I'll eat at table
with you."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "You won't much like dinner, Mother Linden, but I
was late and couldn't help it. I'll give you a piece of the cold
chicken from yesterday. There's custard, too, and you always
enjoy that."</p>

<p>Amelia seated herself and spread her napkin daintily.</p>

<p>"You're very sweet to me, Nellie," she said. "I couldn't have
had a better daughter."</p>

<p>Nellie whispered to Ase, "Will the Heavens fall? A compliment
instead of a complaint."</p>

<p>She said loudly, "All right, children, both of you clean? Come
on, Ase, old slow-poke. Pass the eggs before they get stone-cold.
Sorry about the dinner. I'll fix something nice tonight."</p>

<p>For all the meagreness of the meal there were special touches,
"Nellie's way," Ase called it, that made it more than palatable.
She had added minced chives to the scrambled eggs, the creamed
potatoes swam in butter, and she had opened one of the last
precious jars of peaches to serve with the custard for
dessert.</p>

<p>Amelia said, "Very tasty, my dear, very tasty indeed."</p>

<p>Nellie cocked an eyebrow at Ase.</p>

<p>"Expect the roof to cave in," she said.</p>

<p>Amelia asked, "What did you say, dear?"</p>

<p>Nellie lifted her voice.</p>

<p>"I said we need some new shingles or the roof will cave
in."</p>

<p>She winked at Ase. Sometimes she seemed to him a born liar,
yet her untruths were always either in a spirit of elfin mischief
or in the name of family peace. Willis finished eating and asked
politely to be excused. Amelia went with young 'Melie to her
bedroom. Ase and Nellie sat alone at table. He cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"Mink Fisher is here," he said.</p>

<p>Nellie stopped her coffee cup in mid-air.</p>

<p>"Who's here?"</p>

<p>"Mink Fisher."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"My friend. The old Indian. He gave us the wolfskin robe. He
brought the mink and otter skins. You made a muff and tippet, and
trimmings for 'Melie's coat."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In the back bedroom."</p>

<p>Nellie pushed back from the table.</p>

<p>"You have that stinking Indian in the house this minute?"</p>

<p>He laid a hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Nellie, please. He's sick."</p>

<p>She wailed, "Oh, Ase, you and your sick old men!"</p>

<p>She looked over the table.</p>

<p>"I suppose he's hungry."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he's eaten for several days, Nellie. Maybe
longer."</p>

<p>"He picked a fine time to come here to get filled up. I'm not
going to pitch in and cook for him, either. Take him the rest of
the eggs, here, bread and jam, there's some custard left."</p>

<p>"Never mind the bread and jam. Too much would make him
sick."</p>

<p>"Go feed him in the kitchen. I won't have him in the
dining-room. You should have put him out in the barn."</p>

<p>He thought that Mink himself would probably have preferred a
bed of clean hay, with mice and swallows for company. Ase went to
the bedroom with the plate. The old man was too exhausted to know
or care where he lay. His eyes were still closed. Ase spoke, and
he stirred. He seemed more in coma than in sleep. Ase wondered if
rest was more needed than food, but studying the tight skin over
the protruding bones, decided that nourishment was vital. He
roused Mink and forced down most of the soft eggs and custard.
The old man drowsed again, but the sleep seemed healthful, the
breathing steadier. When he opened his eyes in mid-afternoon they
were less clouded. They took in the room, the bed.</p>

<p>He muttered, "Me too dirty."</p>

<p>He had always been clean. On their jaunts he had plunged
morning and night into lake or running stream, no matter how icy,
or the time of year. His smell was of wood smoke, of animal
pelts, of the leaves and boughs on which he bedded. Now there was
another odor, something indefinable, and Mink must have smelled
it, too.</p>

<p>Ase said, "Let me bathe you."</p>

<p>Mink shook his head.</p>

<p>"No time. Must talk."</p>

<p>He struggled to raise himself, then fell back.</p>

<p>"Come near."</p>

<p>Ase sat on the bed and leaned over him, to catch the
half-mumbled words.</p>

<p>"Long time find brother, son."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I shouldn't have let you leave me."</p>

<p>"Not you. You never lost from me. Always here--," his skeleton
hand wavered to his chest. "Other one. One you sorrow."</p>

<p>"Benjamin--."</p>

<p>Ase felt his heart pound.</p>

<p>"I find him. Almost give up. I find him."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Ase said, "You spent all these years looking for Ben."</p>

<p>"Sure. One place like another for Indian now. You say maybe I
see brother. Tell him send white man's word, Mother sorrow, you
sorrow. Now, bring word."</p>

<p>His breathing was rapid. His nostrils spread, as though to
draw in a thin air with which to continue.</p>

<p>"Long walk," he panted. "Sun rise, sun set, many times."</p>

<p>Ase said, "You could have had someone write us the news of
Ben."</p>

<p>Mink opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sure. White man say to Indian, sure, I write word, I send
word. Indian pay silver. White man write, Indian go away, white
man laugh. No word."</p>

<p>He got himself up on one elbow and said fiercely, "Mink bring
word."</p>

<p>"Lie quiet, Mink."</p>

<p>Ase could not push his friend's strength too far, however
desperate he found himself for news of Ben. He heard a sound
outside the bedroom. He turned. His mother stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>She said, "Nellie tells me there's an Indian here."</p>

<p>She made her way to the foot of the bed. Mink opened his eyes.
He stared at the old woman holding to the footboard. He spoke a
few words in his ancient tongue.</p>

<p>"It's Mink," she said. "What is he doing here?"</p>

<p>"He's brought news of Benjamin, Mother."</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Benjamin?"</p>

<p>She clutched at Ase.</p>

<p>"Benjamin! He's here!"</p>

<p>Her trembling alarmed him.</p>

<p>"No, no, Mother. Sit down. Mink will try to tell us. It's
news, only news."</p>

<p>She pushed him away and gripped the footboard and leaned over
it.</p>

<p>"You've kept it from me all this time. You and the gypsies.
Tell me."</p>

<p>Mink lifted his hand in a gesture for quiet. He stiffened his
shoulders, gathering his strength.</p>

<p>He said in a firm voice, "I hunt son, brother, far west, far
north. I find him. Big timber land."</p>

<p>Amelia said shrilly, "He owns big timber? He's rich now? He's
coming home?"</p>

<p>"Woman, be still. Son, brother, him cook in lumber camp. He
say, world go bad for him, men cheat him, much trouble."</p>

<p>Ase watched his mother. Her face was gray. Mink clenched his
fists and took a long breath.</p>

<p>"Son, brother, he say, tell you him have chance buy big timber
rights. Make much gold. Him come home two-three years now. He
say."</p>

<p>Ase caught his mother, falling. It was like catching some
small wounded and broken bird. He lifted her in his arms to carry
her to her bed. Her voice was strangely thick.</p>

<p>"I can't wait for him--any longer."</p>

<p>He called Nellie to help him with her. They saw a spasm pass
over her. Her eyes rolled back in her head.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, I think she's having a stroke. Hitch up and
go for Doc. Never mind, listen now, hitch up the light buggy and
I'll go. It'd give me the creeps to be alone in the house with
this pair of yours."</p>

<p>He stumbled to the barn, and led the fast mare to the carriage
shed, his hands all thumbs. Nellie had changed into a silk dress
and was waiting.</p>

<p>She called from her seat in the buggy, "Guess I shouldn't have
told her about the Indian."</p>

<p>She clucked to the mare and slapped the reins and was off down
the road. Ase went to his mother's room. She lay immobile. He
turned back the covers and rubbed her hands and feet as he had
done for Nellie when she lay in danger before the birth of Doll.
'Melie looked into the room, Willis wide-eyed behind her.</p>

<p>Ase said, "'Melie, come rub Grandmother's hands and feet a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"Grandmother doesn't know anything, does she, Pa?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and went to Mink. For a moment he thought
his friend had already gone away from him into the mist.</p>

<p>He called, "Mink?"</p>

<p>The old man's lips moved almost without sound. Ase put his ear
close, to hear.</p>

<p>"In shirt."</p>

<p>Ase recalled the earlier gesture. He laid back the cover and
groped inside the soiled white man's shirt. He found a dog-eared
envelope, stained with sweat. He laid it against Mink's hand.</p>

<p>"Is this what you want?"</p>

<p>"For you."</p>

<p>He saw that the envelope was addressed to him in Ben's
writing.</p>

<p>"Now I die."</p>

<p>The whisper was only a statement of fact. Across the continent
Mink had sought Ben and found him, to bring back the wanted white
man's word on paper. There was nothing more he could do for the
boy he had taught and loved. He was done with life. He rejected
it with contempt. Ase could call loudly to him, could beg him not
to go. Mink might hear but he would not listen nor ever answer.
Ase slipped the letter in a pocket. He did not know whether
Mink's breath ceased to come or whether he ceased to draw it.
There was an instant when he sensed an unheard thunder and an
unseen lightning. Then the room was filled with a vast calm. He
drew the spread over his friend's face and went out of the
room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He heard Nellie say, "Ase, for the Lord's sake, didn't you
even notice Doc's trap drive up, and me behind him? Go unhitch
both rigs."</p>

<p>It was a relief to use his hands, to rub down both lathered
animals, to feed and water them. When he returned to the house,
he met the children huddled on the lawn.</p>

<p>'Melie said, "Ma made us get out. She said children oughtn't
to be in a house with death. Willis is scared, but I'm not. I
wanted to see. Can you see death?"</p>

<p>He laid his hand on her shoulder. He was sorry that Nellie had
made of their grandmother's dying such a thing, as though a thief
and murderer had come through the window. It was a quieter
matter, he thought, for one advanced in years; not that death
comes, but that life goes. It was like the flowers in Nellie's
garden in the autumn, done with blooming; only that the long-used
life sap sank back into the earth, and so the roses, the asters,
the marigolds, being deserted, died. He took the two children by
their hands.</p>

<p>He said to Willis, "Come get some cookies. There isn't
anything in the house that wasn't here before."</p>

<p>Dr. Holder nodded to him at Amelia's bedside.</p>

<p>He said, "Your mother's had a stroke, just as Nellie
thought."</p>

<p>"Will she come through?"</p>

<p>"No. She's about gone now."</p>

<p>Holder leaned back in his chair. He frowned.</p>

<p>"Let's hope it's the end, anyway. I never told you, Linden,
but I haven't had an easy night since I advised you to keep your
mother here. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, wondering if she'd gone
berserk again."</p>

<p>Ase stood mute. If his mother breathed, that breath was
impalpable. Her face was gray as the granite in the pasture.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I've been telling Doc about that sick Indian you
put in my clean bed. The time I put in with that old Tim
McCarthy, and now with your mother giving us some peace at last,
I suppose I've got to help nurse the Indian, too."</p>

<p>He felt a revulsion that roiled his stomach. Yet, he
remembered, Nellie had been all kindness during Tim's illness and
dying. Her sharp little tongue had nothing to do with the rest of
her.</p>

<p>He said, "Mink Fisher's dead."</p>

<p>She said, "Well! That's a blessing, too."</p>

<p>Holder said, "Nothing I can do for your mother, Linden. Let me
see this Indian. Nellie told me the shock it gave the old lady
when he gave his news about that fabulous brother of yours."</p>

<p>Ase wanted to keep Mink inviolate from the professional eyeing
and probing.</p>

<p>He said, "The Indians have superstitions."</p>

<p>Mink had talked many years ago of the spirit, which asked to
be left alone for a decent period after the death of the
body.</p>

<p>Holder said, "Dead men don't have any superstitions. Nellie
says he was starving. Can't imagine an Indian starving to
death."</p>

<p>Ase was unable to stop the intrusion. The doctor threw back
the covers.</p>

<p>"I'll swear. Skin and bones. You know, in all my years of
practice, this is the first time I've ever seen an actual death
from starvation. And it had to be an Indian."</p>

<p>He studied the sharp features.</p>

<p>"Handsome old fellow. Say, Linden, you look a lot like him.
Sure he's not your sire?"</p>

<p>The doctor chuckled and left the room.</p>

<p>Ase stood over Mink's body. He stared at the still face. A
great yearning filled him. No, Mink was only the father of his
mind and spirit. He turned away, his eyes misted.</p>

<p>His mother's life left her at sunset with a quiet it had never
known before. He could only share Holder's relief. His sadness
was for the path they had missed together. He sat alone with her
into the night, grieving over the destruction she had received
and had inflicted. Nellie was asleep when he went at last to
their bedroom and he was grateful. He could not have endured her
practical chatting about the funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Dr. Holder spent the night. In the morning he made a list from
Nellie's dictation of such details as folk to be notified, the
preacher to be called for the home service, the type of coffin to
be ordered. The words penetrated Ase's brooding.</p>

<p>He heard her say, "I don't know what he expects to do with his
Indian."</p>

<p>She seemed as alien to him as some woman stepping off the
train in Peytonville. He went to the back bedroom. Mink, who had
given and had not received, Mink the proud, would share his
contempt, would ask never to be troublesome and unwanted, would
thank him wordlessly, as always, for the boon of a final
aloofness.</p>

<p>Ase wrapped the ragged Indian blanket tightly around the body
of his friend. He reached for Nellie's hand-pieced quilt for
further shroud, then dropped it as though unclean. Let Mink
Fisher go to earth in what he had come in, as he would want
it.</p>

<p>The long stiff body was awkward but it was feather-light. Ase
carried it cradled in his arms out of the back door. He circled
the house at a distance and crossed the willow stream. He walked
with long strides up the pasture hill, into the hemlocks, toward
the dark, receptive bog.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The gathering at the living-room table seemed to Ase like a
flock of crows ringed around a mass of carrion. He considered the
reading of Amelia's will a family matter, but Nellie had insisted
that not only Judge Simmons but Dr. Holder must be present. Nat
drummed his fingers on the table. Arent shifted in his chair,
watching his brother for cues. Ase brought his mother's tin box
from her room. They had been unable to find the key and the Judge
prized open the lock. A thick sheaf of bank notes lay on top.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Ah-hah."</p>

<p>The Judge laid the bills aside with a slow dignity. The next
layer was of material concerned with Benjamin, his grade school
and Academy diplomas, the few letters he had written his mother
from his periodic absences in his youth, the illiterate scrawl
brought by the gypsy queen that had proved of no use in tracing
him. The Judge laid these too aside. At the bottom of the box lay
the will. The Judge lifted it out, unfolded it with a crackling
sound. The paper was yellow with age. The Judge looked it
over.</p>

<p>"Hm-m. She had this drawn up in Trent. Odd, she didn't come to
me." He read:</p>

<p>"To my beloved son, Benjamin Linden, I leave all my property,
real and intangible--"</p>

<p>The Judge removed his spectacles and peered around the
table.</p>

<p>"A strange arrangement, under the circumstances. Does this
come as a surprise?"</p>

<p>Nellie brought her small fist down on the table.</p>

<p>"Not to me. I always knew she was up to something. Talking so
mealy-mouthed about Ben's third, Ben's share, planning all the
time to leave him everything. Something told me I was wasting my
time being good to her."</p>

<p>Nat said sharply, "What's the date of the will? Everybody
knows she was crazy as a bedbug."</p>

<p>The Judge replaced his glasses.</p>

<p>"Nearly twenty years ago. Asahel, wasn't that about the time
your brother went away and you were married?"</p>

<p>He nodded. The exact date was a week after his marriage to
Nellie.</p>

<p>"Well, Asahel, she wasn't insane then. Or you couldn't prove
it."</p>

<p>Nellie nudged Dr. Holder.</p>

<p>The physician said, "I believe you can. In my professional
opinion, Mrs. Linden's unhinged mental condition can be
definitely traced to the disappearance of her eldest son."</p>

<p>The Judge said, "Thank you, sir. Then, Ase, shall I file a
protest, using that as the basis? The will is obviously unfair.
You have carried the whole burden all these years."</p>

<p>Ase was recalling the November evening after his father's
burying. He heard again the bitter words of the quarrel. He saw
Ben scribbling out the relinquishment of his share in the farm
and his mother at once consigning it to the bright flames in the
stove. He shook his head. He heard again the implacability of her
voice revealing her hate for him, her love for his brother.</p>

<p>"No. Ben signed over his rights in the farm and Mother put the
paper in the fire. Her intention is perfectly clear."</p>

<p>"What do you plan to do, man? Go against the interests of your
own family?"</p>

<p>Nat said, "The least you can do, Pa, is keep your mouth shut
and let the Judge go ahead."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, sometimes I wonder if you aren't crazy,
too."</p>

<p>Let them think he was mad, he would not scramble at law for
Ben's property.</p>

<p>"We're making a living here. Having the deed in my name
wouldn't make any difference."</p>

<p>Nat shouted, "It makes a difference to me. What's going to
happen when you die? The state'll take the place, that's what,
and nothing for me--" he corrected himself--"for the rest of us.
That precious Uncle Ben's probably been dead for years."</p>

<p>Ase had not yet shown Ben's letter to his family. An obscure
instinct of protection had kept it privately in his pocket.</p>

<p>He said, "Ben's alive. Mink Fisher brought the word."</p>

<p>The Judge said, "Ase, I almost agree with Nellie. You are not
acting the part of a proper <i>paterfamilias.</i> I don't
understand you."</p>

<p>The table fell silent. Nat reached for the sheaf of bills and
began counting the money.</p>

<p>"Close to four thousand. Anyway, this is ours. It's what
you've been giving the old witch all this time."</p>

<p>Judge Simmons said, "The lad is right, Asahel. This cash
represents your own labor. Even, you might say, repayment for
your mother's keep. I suppose she never paid you for bed and
board?"</p>

<p>Holder said wryly, "Or for medical care. We kept her out of
the asylum, or don't you remember?"</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered, and the sweat came in the palms of his
hands. He did not answer.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, you're just being stubborn. All that
stinking Indian brought you was his own story that Ben was alive
and in his usual mess of trouble. You said we were making a
living here, but it's been a mighty poor one lately. Don't be an
idiot about this cash. It's yours, it's ours."</p>

<p>He had once as a boy in winter seen a deer surrounded by
wolves. He had been young and unarmed and had been obliged to
turn away in sickness of heart. Now he too was hemmed in by the
enemy. Nat did not surprise him, nor the rest of the pack, but he
had not expected from Nellie this subtle dishonesty. No, he
thought, she was not dishonest, she was the eternal mother, the
eternal bitch, fighting for her young and for family safety.</p>

<p>Nat said, "I don't see where there's an argument. Nobody but a
dead Indian knows where Uncle Ben is."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I have something here from Ben."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket the letter Mink Fisher had brought
him. He handed it to the Judge. Simmons read aloud slowly.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Brother Ase:</p>

<p>"This pesky old Indian of yours won't give me any peace until
I write you what he calls white-man's-word-on-paper. Can't
imagine how he happened to run across me. Have been waiting to
write you until I made my pile. So I'm killing two birds with one
stone, as think I have the big chance now if you or Mother can
send me enough money. The timber out here would knock your eyes
out. Douglas firs a hundred feet tall and six feet in diameter.
The more you can send me the more timber rights I can buy and
either re-sell at a profit or with enough cash set up my own
logging camp and really clean up. Will cut you in on it
fifty-fifty. Send an express money order, checks no good out here
and cash stolen before it arrives. Get the money out of Mother if
you don't have it but by no means give her my address. Tell her
this one is temporary, not a lie either, which you wouldn't tell
her unless you've changed, I know you. I'll write her when I'm on
my feet.</p>

<p align="right">Affection to all, your brother,          </p>

<p align="right">Benjamin Linden     </p>

<p>P.S. Have had a little bad luck but a hell of a good
time."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Well! This would have killed the old lady if the
Indian hadn't. She'd have wormed it out of you somehow, Ase."</p>

<p>He said, "I think this settles things."</p>

<p>The Judge said, "Yes. Unfortunately. We can only hope that
Benjamin doesn't put you off the farm and have it sold. However,
Asahel, any probate court would concede that you are entitled to
a share in the estate, for your mother's care."</p>

<p>"My mother didn't need to pay for her room and board. You
forget, the farm was always hers."</p>

<p>"If you insist on looking at it that way, I suppose you
consider yourself fortunate that she allowed you to farm her
place and live in her house."</p>

<p>Ase was aware of the contempt in the voice.</p>

<p>Remembering his mother's greater contempt, he said, "I
do."</p>

<p>Simmons lifted his hands to the air.</p>

<p>"Very well. Cut your own throat. I'll go ahead with the
probate and have the money sent your brother as soon as the court
permits. I shall charge a fee of three hundred dollars, since
money means nothing to you, to be taken out first, along with the
costs."</p>

<p>He gathered up the papers and left.</p>

<p>Nat's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>He said, "You know, Pa, I sort of like the sound of Uncle
Ben's proposition, thinking it over. He'll be surprised to get
that much working capital handed him. Tell him fifty-fifty is all
right. Tell him you didn't insist on a division of the cash here.
I've been hearing about that big timber. There's bound to be a
fortune in it."</p>

<p>Nellie snapped, "There's no fortune in anything in the world
Ben Linden touches. If he does put the money where he says,
there'll be a forest fire the next day and wipe it out."</p>

<p>Nat said, "Well, I'm for it. The big chance comes once to the
unluckiest man on earth. All he has to do is recognize it. And
don't think I won't know mine when it comes."</p>

<p>He frowned.</p>

<p>"Say, Pa, what kind of a fellow is this Uncle Ben? Is he the
kind to put us off the farm?"</p>

<p>Ase was half blind with rage. He stood up from the table.</p>

<p>"No. He isn't."</p>

<p>"Ma, that right?"</p>

<p>Nellie hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, Nat," she said. "That's right."</p>

<p>Ase went from the house to the barns. They did not hold their
usual comfort. He went to Pip Lake and stripped and plunged into
the icy water to try to relieve himself of his feeling of
uncleanliness. At supper, he closed his ears to the chatter of
his family and did not speak. He waited until they had gone to
bed, then sat by the lamp and wrote at length to his brother. He
dealt briefly with business matters. He gave the story of their
mother's life and death. He gave the history of his children. He
reported on the progress of the farm. He hoped that the cash
would be enough for the desired timber purposes. He made no
reproaches for Ben's two decades of silence. He expressed his
love as best he could, and begged of Ben not to lose touch with
him again. As he sealed and stamped the letter, he found himself
with his mother's ancient hope, that the family news, the
affection, would bring his brother home again.</p>

<p>Judge Simmons handled affairs promptly. The money order went
west. Word was awaited by the probate court on the disposition of
the Linden farm. Nat and Arent returned from the University. On a
Saturday in July, Ase drove to Peytonville for supplies, and to
trade in Nellie's eggs and butter, and to the post office for his
weekly papers. The postmaster handed him a letter from Ben.</p>

<p>"Judge got one from Ben, too. Guess you'll want to see the
Judge while you're in town. He hasn't told anybody how things
came out. Even Miss Minnie don't know."</p>

<p>Ase could conceive of the village curiosity over his mother's
will. He smiled.</p>

<p>He said, "I'll tell the Judge to make sure Miss Minnie's the
first to know."</p>

<p>The postmaster chuckled.</p>

<p>"We're all hoping Ben'll do the square thing."</p>

<p>"He will."</p>

<p>The Judge welcomed Ase in the dusty office. He held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Glad you came by. Well, Ase, you knew your brother better
than I did. I'd have preferred a definite renouncing of claim,
but this is good enough for the time being."</p>

<p>He pushed Ben's paper across the desk. It read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To the Peytonville Township Probate Court and to Whom it may
concern:</p>

<p>"It is my wish that my brother Asahel Linden have full use of
the Linden farm property as described, and any profits
therefrom."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The paper had been notarized. A note asked to have the deed
forwarded.</p>

<p>The Judge said, "My congratulations. Benjamin has more decency
than I gave him credit for. I heard you have a letter, too. What
does he have to say to you?"</p>

<p>Ase hesitated. It would seem ungracious, but he could not
spread whatever Ben had written him before the Judge, the town
and township.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me, I'll read it first with my family."</p>

<p>"Perfectly proper. Drop in next week if you have further news
for me."</p>

<p>The letter was addressed to Asahel Linden &amp; Family. He did
not open it until the family was gathered together around the
supper table. He glanced it over in search of one of Ben's
typical indiscretions. There seemed none and he read aloud.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Bro. Ase &amp; Nellie &amp; All:</p>

<p>"Hard to imagine my kid brother with a houseful of children
some near grown. That Nat sounds like a go-getter to me. Tell him
to look me up if he ever comes west, it's the place to be.
Wouldn't know what to do with a family myself but guess it's all
right for an old slow-poke like you, Ase. Glad to hear you're
still pretty, Nellie.</p>

<p>"Had an idea Mother would live forever. I should have written
her but didn't want her hounding me to come back.</p>

<p>"Well, folks, by the time you get this I'll be half way to the
Yukon. Suppose you've had the word. Gold. The news that's come
back says Alaska makes chicken feed out of the California gold
rush. Stake out your claims and then just pick the nuggets up off
the bare ground, some big as a hen's egg. Brings a hundred
dollars an ounce and that's what I call money. Didn't make sense
to bother with small potatoes like timber so I'm on my way
tomorrow with that good cash they sent me safe in my belt and I
mean safe, I've turned into a pretty good knock-down fighter. Had
to pay five hundred for boat fare north, a good thing, too, it
keeps out the pikers.</p>

<p>"Well, guess you won't hear from me again until I've made my
pile. Nat, how about Uncle Ben coming back to the farm driving
one of those new horseless carriages?</p>

<p>"Don't know just where I'll be, seems there's a good many rich
lodes up there, plan to pick the best before I begin raking in
those chunks of pure gold, so can't tell you where to write.
Never fear, Brother Ase, you'll have word from me sooner or
later.</p>

<p align="right">"Best to all,               </p>

<p align="right">"Bro. Ben, bro.-in-law Ben, Uncle Ben."     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase had a feeling of unbearable depression. In his heart, he
recognized, he had expected Ben's return. Well, Ben had been
generous about the farm. Yet he recognized his despisal of it,
his eagerness to leave it behind. He knew further that the two of
them equally despised property as property, both considering that
such things were only meant to be used toward some other end. And
if his end and Ben's were at variance, it had nothing to do with
their tacit understanding that a precise ownership of the farm
was irrelevant. He wondered whether Ben might not be off on
another wild goose chase, but that did not matter, either. Nellie
seemed to be speaking for him.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you, Ase? Ben's gone hog-wild again."</p>

<p>Nat's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>He said, "Now listen, Pa, you just don't know what's going on
in the world. Uncle Ben's right. This is a chance in a million.
I'm heading for the Yukon, too. Tomorrow."</p>

<p>Arent said, "Hey, you'll take me along, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. I'll have plenty of use for you."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c32">XXXII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase could not put a mortgage on property he did not own. He
was reluctant to borrow on a personal note from the Peytonville
bank, for the interest rate was ten per cent. He could borrow
ordinarily of an individual, as he had often loaned the use of
money, at the less hazardous rate of seven per cent, but his
farmer and merchant friends had suffered as serious reverses as
he. His crops were thriving, but hail or storm at any time could
finish his ruin. He asked Nellie in mid-August if she could make
her supplies last a little longer.</p>

<p>She checked the larder and announced that she could manage.
Her butter and egg money brought enough each week to trade for
flour, sugar, tea and coffee, and the garden was abundant. If he
killed an occasional lamb or shoat before he harvested his wheat,
they need not go hungry. With Nat and Arent gone, the family
seemed to eat no more than half as much. There were no longer
Amelia's delicacies and strangely large appetite to be taken care
of. The summer days being long, Eric insisted on helping for two
hours night and morning, as well as all of Sunday. He was a new
man, secure with home and family. Ase wished for the first time
that the farm was his own, only in order to give to Eric the
cabin and a few acres of land.</p>

<p>There had not been time to hear from the boys. He and Nellie
had joined battle to persuade Nat to finish his college, but it
had been like trying to rein an unbroken stallion with a cobweb.
Nellie fretted constantly. Ase was less disturbed. His instinct
told him that Nat's toughness would see him through, danger and
hard labor would only give mettle to his steel. Nat would take
care of Arent in turn because he needed him.</p>

<p>Ase walked through his wheatfield under a blazing sun. His
yield, short of new catastrophe, would be as heavy as he had ever
had. The crops of beans, of oats and barley and potatoes, were
enormous. The apple orchard was in its prime, the heavy-laden
trees grown so large their branches almost touched. The ten acres
of peach orchard on the southeast slope above the lake had come
into bearing. It was said that grains and fruits were scarce over
most of the country and prices would be high. The bank would have
loaned him any amount he asked for, but it was better this way,
to depend only on the crops themselves, on himself, on Nellie, on
Eric.</p>

<p>He crossed the road toward the beanfield. He heard a rumble of
wheels over the wooden bridge. The planks kept rattling, so that
there must be half a dozen heavy wagons coming toward him, and he
knew it was the gypsies. They had not appeared in two years and
he had missed them sorely. He waited by the side of the road. He
lifted his arm high in greeting to the lead wagon. The driver was
not Pav. The wagon came close. The driver was Pav's son. The line
of wagons drew into the accustomed camping ground in the orchard
near the spring. The back steps were lowered, the doors flew
open, the gypsies hailed him as cheerfully as ever. The younger
children had forgotten him and were shy. He looked anxiously for
the Old One. Pav's son turned from giving his orders.</p>

<p>He said, "Our queen say you come to her first thing."</p>

<p>The relief was great.</p>

<p>Carlo said, "She go soon. Very soon. My father go snow before
last."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I'm sorry. I loved him."</p>

<p>"I know. All love my father. All love our queen. All love you.
Now come."</p>

<p>Carlo led him to the rear of the lead wagon. The Old One lay
in her bunk. She was bright-eyed and Ase could not believe that
she was ill or dying. She patted the bunk and he sat down beside
her and took her brown old heavy-ringed hand in his huge
ones.</p>

<p>She said, "I think I not see you again. I say, whip horses, I
wish see our friend Asah before leave you."</p>

<p>He could not bear this further loss, he thought, not yet. He
bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Now, now! Lift the head! Good smile! How long you think Old
One like wear dress of life? Dress bright once, dance much, now
old dirty rag, throw away! Is right."</p>

<p>She stroked his hands.</p>

<p>"Now I have wish, see you, have much tell you, you have much
tell me, I decide not die today."</p>

<p>She laughed her ageless, rich, deep laugh.</p>

<p>Her face turned grave.</p>

<p>"I tell you first. Plague, smallpox, strike us like snake. My
Elissa, her babas, all, big and little. Others. Old Pav."</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers and she gripped it. She closed her
eyes. They grieved together in silence.</p>

<p>"So. Now you tell me your much sadness. Or I tell you. Some
things I know."</p>

<p>Her prescience, or her reading of his face, he could not know
which, had always amazed him.</p>

<p>He said, "My mother died. My friend the Indian died. My two
oldest sons have gone to Alaska to hunt for gold. My brother went
there, too, before them."</p>

<p>"Something more."</p>

<p>He hesitated. The fact that he had little claim, only Ben's
permission to work the land where he lived, that he was in
desperate straits for the moment, seemed trivial.</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>He shook his head. She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Money trouble. New for you. Leave me now. We talk again
tomorrow."</p>

<p>He went to the house and said to Nellie, "The gypsies are here
again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them come."</p>

<p>"What do we have for them?"</p>

<p>"Mighty little, Ase. I'm at the bottom of the flour and sugar
barrels. There's plenty of vegetables in the garden, but they
don't seem to use any, except to put in their stews. Fruit now,
they like that. I can spare a pat of butter and some eggs."</p>

<p>He thought of the enormous hampers of food Nellie used to give
him for his friends.</p>

<p>"Do the best you can. If you can stand it, I'll give them the
spotted calf we planned to raise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ase!"</p>

<p>She had raised the calf on a bottle and it followed her about
like a dog. She wiped her eyes quickly and packed a small
basket.</p>

<p>"Tell them I'm sorry it's so little. Take them the calf and
get it over with."</p>

<p>He took the inadequate food, and the calf led by a halter, to
Carlo. He could not butcher it himself.</p>

<p>He said, "I'd bring you more if I had it. The crops failed for
two years."</p>

<p>Carlo looked at him with some of his father's old
shrewdness.</p>

<p>"Is more welcome, friend Asah, because hard to spare. We thank
you. Now you eat with us tonight, like always?"</p>

<p>Ase shook his head. Carlo laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"I know. Is too much changed. No meat good when salt is
sadness."</p>

<p>At their own frugal supper Ase told Nellie of the deaths among
the Roms, of the Old One's soon-dying.</p>

<p>She said, "I always wondered about you and the gypsy girl
Elissa. You were pretty sweet on her, weren't you?"</p>

<p>He looked at her imploringly. There was nothing he could say,
in affirmation or denial. He wished she had chosen a less crude
way of expressing it. She laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you didn't actually do anything. You're
transparent as a windowpane. I'd have known."</p>

<p>He went to the front steps in the late twilight and sat
watching the campfires in the apple orchard. He thought back to
the days when he had danced with the gypsy girl. Why, she had
been a princess, the daughter of a queen. Her black hair had
brushed across his face like the wings of butterflies. He
recalled the firm roundness of her flesh. He remembered the scent
of her, made up of wood smoke, of crushed wild berries, of the
flowers she was forever gathering, sharp daisies and sweet hedge
roses. And though he had known her last as a plump matron and
mother, he would think of her forever as young and slim and
lovely. For himself, he felt old for the first time in his life.
Too much had happened in too short a while. For once, he lost his
sense of the all-embracing unity of time and recognized a
milestone in his life.</p>

<p>In the morning, Nellie considered visiting the Old One with
him and decided against it.</p>

<p>She said, "I haven't been near her the last ten years, better
not bother her now. Tell her--," she hesitated, "tell her--oh,
say something nice for me."</p>

<p>He thought miserably that he could not even speak for himself.
Nellie's not going was a mixture of delicacy and of avoidance of
difficult situations. He went to the lead wagon and called at the
back for admission.</p>

<p>"Come, my friend."</p>

<p>He was surprised to find Carlo and several of the older men
and women crowded in the wagon. The Old One held out her hand to
him.</p>

<p>She said, "Friend Asah. Like I say, I go soon. Maybe tomorrow.
Now I talk."</p>

<p>She seemed well and strong, yet if she was determined to throw
off, as she had said, the dirty cloak of living, she would surely
do so, as Mink Fisher had done. Where better for her to lie at
peace than in the ancient Linden graveyard?</p>

<p>He said, "Stay here. Now, and after."</p>

<p>"Pah! Where gypsy body lie, no matter. I go on. I like better
some strange hill where no one ever know or see. Now. Listen, our
friend. Is little something all agreed."</p>

<p>She looked around at the elders. They nodded their heads.</p>

<p>"I, Queen. King, my husband, die long ago. Pav, Pav's son
Carlo, like prince, maybe, not king. I ask you years past, be
gypsy king, marry my Elissa. Yes? Too late now, all too late.
Because I ask you, you belong. Now. I have gold, much gold. I
divide. I share. Most for tribe, little part for you."</p>

<p>She reached under her pillows and drew out an embroidered bag.
She opened it. It was heavy with gold coins.</p>

<p>"This small much for you. Is my wish. Is wish of all."</p>

<p>He said, "No."</p>

<p>The Old One continued, "I know your trouble, in a dream. Now,
Carlo tells me more."</p>

<p>He said, "No, I can't let you do this for me."</p>

<p>She said sharply, "No? So you make great gifts and take
nothing? Too proud to take gift, eh? Hold head high, say, I am
great man, I give, no gift to me from friend?"</p>

<p>He said, "It's too much."</p>

<p>"Too much, eh? What price you pay for friends? Gift is love.
You hate love?"</p>

<p>He understood that this thing could not be refused. He
inclined his head in thanks.</p>

<p>"Good, then. Little bag is for the wife. I make it long ago.
Now, you see. Your luck change. All go fine now. And so, goodbye,
my Asah. Never grieve for me. Only think sometime, when summer
wind blow, 'Ah, the Old One, she speaks to me!'"</p>

<p>He kissed her cheek and turned away. Tears that he had not
shed for his mother clouded his eyes. He watched the caravan move
on until the last dust down the road had settled.</p>

<p>He went to the house. He turned out his inheritance on the
baize-covered table before Nellie's wide eyes. He gave her the
embroidered purse and told the story.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, I'll swear, I can't figure you out.
Wouldn't lift a finger for your own money from your mother, and
then take this from strangers."</p>

<p>She spread out wonderingly the pile of gold coins.</p>

<p>"Ase, there's close to a thousand dollars here. Well, our
necks are saved, I must say. Count it."</p>

<p>He had no interest in the amount. He left the house and went
to the comfort of the barns. He found no sharpness in his pain.
The Old One's blitheness before life and death carried its own
relief. He prayed that when his time came, he would cast off the
well-worn garment with a similar courage. He walked down the row
of cattle stalls. They were empty except for one, where the
spotted calf had been silently returned and tethered.</p>

<p>Nellie had called the gypsies "strangers." They were less of
strangers to him than his own.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nat's letters to his mother were direct and often vivid. Ase
was not offended that none was ever addressed to him. He had long
accepted the bond between the two, and his own exclusion. He
handed her the letter. Nellie ripped open the envelope, scanned
the first lines, then thrust the letter at Ase, saying "Read it
to me."</p>

<p>She rocked back and forth in the Boston rocker, her hands
crossed over her plump stomach, as he read slowly aloud. Her
satisfaction rose to the surface like the thick golden cream on
the milk pans. At a piece of news, she lifted her eyebrows and
said, "Um-hum." When a remark of Nat's amused her, she wrinkled
her nose. She smiled from beginning to end. Ase thought with pain
and pity of his own mother, starved for just such nourishment
from Benjamin, driven mad, perhaps, for lack of it. Yet her fever
had been devouring. Ben had been saving his body and soul when he
begged his brother to keep from her his whereabouts, lest she
"hound" him. Nothing would have satisfied Amelia but complete
possession of her son, to all intents and purposes returning him
to the dark slyness of her womb.</p>

<p>When 'Melie and Willis trudged in from school in the November
afternoon, Nellie called them to the sitting room to hear with
her a second reading. Today's letter from Nat was filled with
news. He and Arent were leaving Alaska at last. They were taking
the next steamer south, ready to invest their gold in a stable
business.</p>

<p>They had spent three years in the field. The first year had
been a hard one. There was no alternative for Nat but to freeze
like other men in the winter, fight mosquitoes and gnats in the
summer, tramp or mush great distances, to break his back with
pick-axe, to crouch, aching, over the cold streams, panning his
gold. By the end of the year he began to use their modest hoard
of dust and nuggets for other tactics. He bought claims outright
of sick, starving or discouraged men, bought shares from others,
who, undiscouraged in the face of a promising vein, needed an
immediate subsidy with which to continue. He re-sold the
worthless claims to newly arrived "tenderfeet" at far higher
prices than he had paid, often, Ase knew, with
misrepresentations. Nat had once written that a few nuggets
"planted" under a boulder returned higher dividends than the best
bank stock. He re-sold the promising claims to the big
syndicates, retaining shares for himself and Arent. One of these
had recently proved to contain a rich lode. Instead of lamenting
that he had not kept and worked it entirely for himself, he
pointed out that he did not expect all the luck in the world,
only a generous portion of it, and a year or two of hard labor
might as easily have been spent on sterile ground.</p>

<p>He had found that the poor or dubious claims were more readily
sold, and at better prices, if he erected the roughest sort of
shack for shelter, with a cot, chair, crude stove and table, for
by the time the tenderfeet reached the interior they were likely
to be frightened by the vastness of the country, and a tarpaper
roof over a few boards gave the illusion of a home. It was this
that had given Nat his present idea. He wrote now and Ase
read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We're coming out with better than thirty thousand. Shares in
some of the claims will continue to pay off. Most fellows here
push their luck too far, stay too long and lose everything. The
Northwest is booming. There's money pouring in from gold and
timber and ship building and fishing. I'm going to have a look at
Seattle and Portland and some of the smaller places and go into
real estate and contracting. The land itself is still dirt cheap,
it's houses and stores and office buildings that are wanted, and
a little later, it'll be roads and bridges and more railroad
lines. Not such quick money as one big lucky strike in the gold,
but safe and sure, and I'll expand as fast as possible. Buy and
build and sell, buy and build and sell. Take the real big jobs on
a cost-plus basis, and I'm just the guy to see there'll be more
plus than cost.</p>

<p>"Now Ma, paper money's scarcer than gold around here, but I
got hold of a hundred dollar bill, and here it is and I want you
to blow it. There'll be more later where that came from. Let me
know how Pa's face looks when he sees it. He never said anything,
but I always sort of figured he thought I was a tramp, thought
maybe I'd end up like Uncle Ben, well, he'll see. That reminds
me, I've told you I just kept missing Uncle Ben up here and
yesterday I heard he'd gone back to the States, stony broke,
working his passage back. He did pretty well at one time, they
say, then lost down to his last nickel at cards, couldn't leave
them alone.</p>

<p>"Now, Ma, I'll be too busy to write much for a while, it'll
just be a line or two, but don't ever worry about</p>

<p align="right">"Your loving Nat."     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Nellie smoothed the greenback in her lap.</p>

<p>"I guess now, Ase, you can stop worrying about him," she said.
"He's going to get everything he ever wanted."</p>

<p>But the danger, Ase knew, had never been that Nat might not
succeed, but that he would.</p>

<p>'Melie's eyes glittered. At eighteen, she was a handsome girl
except for the too-small black eyes and the too-thin mouth. An
occasional beau appeared, to squire her to a hay-ride or a dance,
but the same one seldom came twice. Her snapped orders were not
appealing.</p>

<p>She said, "Pa, when I finish the Academy this year, I want to
go to the University for a Home Economics course."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"You may go. But you won't learn more than your mother could
teach you."</p>

<p>"Yes I will. On a different scale. Nat's going to need me. I'm
going to run his big house for him."</p>

<p>Nellie laughed.</p>

<p>"First I've heard of Nat's big house. Better wait 'til he has
one."</p>

<p>"He'll have it. I want to be ready."</p>

<p>'Melie looked at Willis speculatively.</p>

<p>"You'd better get ready, too. Better begin taking all the
business courses. You waste too much time reading."</p>

<p>Willis said, "Get ready for what?"</p>

<p>The girl frowned.</p>

<p>"To work into Nat's big business, silly."</p>

<p>"He won't want me."</p>

<p>"It's a sure thing you'll never amount to a thing by
yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't expect to amount to anything. I want to be let
alone."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that. Nat and I'll know what's good for
you."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "That's right, Willis. You can't go wrong
sticking with Nat and 'Melie."</p>

<p>The boy shrugged his shoulders. He was still pale and slight.
His eyes were red-rimmed from reading late by lamplight. Nellie
protested, but Ase would not forbid this solace of books. The
boys' adventure books had been replaced by Scott and Dickens and
Thackeray, past Willis' years, Ase thought, reading them himself
with pleasure. The Peytonville library was standardized and
meager. Ase picked up eagerly each new volume that Willis brought
home, but for all the warmth the Dickens gave him, he was still
unsatisfied. Surely there must be other books that told of larger
worlds, books more like his Shakespeare and his Bible, to carry a
man's mind and spirit soaring, to stab him with questions, and
having drawn blood, to staunch with answerings. It was the great
thinkers for whose words he longed, unknowing what he longed
for.</p>

<p>It occurred to him to speak now to Willis, to stand with him
against the others. If encouraged, the boy might have the makings
of a scholar, a man of dignity and depth. Nellie and 'Melie
bustled together to the kitchen, and when Ase turned from his
thoughts to attempt to speak, Willis had slipped away.</p>

<p>He sat alone until he was late for his chores. He was
depressed. Willis needed something from him, had perhaps always
needed something, that he was unable to give or the boy to take.
Yet there was still time. College was the next step, probably
Willis would find there the direction for his life. His
depression deepened. It was not for Nat. His concern for the
taint on his eldest son was too old a thing to disturb him now
unduly. As he had consoled himself so often, he hoped again that
the "success" toward which Nat was forging would of itself soften
him. He had read that various industrialists, whose millions had
been cut from the bodies of little men, were giving vast sums for
noble purposes. Probably a certain type of man must first satiate
his, he recalled the phrase, o'er-vaulting ambition, before he
was free to give himself to a common humanity. It was not Willis
or Nat who held him here, unable to plod on to the milking of his
cows.</p>

<p>It was Benjamin. Nat's casual news brought back painfully a
similar picture once painted by the gypsy Queen, of Ben going
away laughing in his ragged coat. That was how long ago, more
than twenty years? Ben was then still young, so that the laughter
ameliorated the rags. In his middle age, had he laughed again,
embarking on the passage that must be worked for? And was he gray
and worn, or was the hair yet tawny, the green eyes yet bright
with cat-fire? The old longing, the life-long loneliness, swept
Ase, and as he sank under its sweetness and its weight, it came
to him for the first time to wonder if Benjamin needed him, if
his brother yearned for him, too.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c34">XXXIV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It seemed to Ase that Nat's plans went forward over the years
as though he worked steadily at a difficult jig-saw puzzle. Nat's
confidence in the Pacific Northwest was justified. He poured his
earnings back into his various businesses and projects. He found
himself occasionally over-extended, strapped for cash, stretching
his credit, but it was at these times as if a piece in the puzzle
refused to fit for the moment only. He found its proper place
shortly, and the design took shape, having been definitive from
the beginning.</p>

<p>He and Arent lived as bachelors. He sent for 'Melie before she
had quite completed her course in home economics.</p>

<p>"I'll always handle the budget," he wrote, "and if Ma hasn't
taught you to cook by now, you're hopeless. Anyway, it won't be
long before the big house and plenty of servants. You might as
well get in practice."</p>

<p>The big house became a reality. It was not big enough, Nat
wrote, and in a few years there would be a larger one, the finest
mansion in the Northwest. 'Melie was hostess as well as
housekeeper, as the time had come when Nat was ready to
entertain, to establish a social position in keeping with his
financial one.</p>

<p>Nellie commented to Ase, "Don't see why he bothers about
Society if he isn't going to get married."</p>

<p>Yet she read with satisfaction the newspaper clippings that
reported on the affairs of "the rising young tycoon, Nat Linden."
She fretted that he stayed so long away. At last he returned to
the farm for a brief visit, with 'Melie and Arent in tow. Nellie
rejoiced, exhausting herself and big Elsa with cooking for Nat's
gourmand delight.</p>

<p>Ase found himself again shocked. Nat and 'Melie had a hard,
depthless glitter. They were grossly over-dressed. Nat, not quite
thirty, was florid. After each of Nellie's abundant meals he
patted tenderly the paunch he was too young to have developed. He
boasted so flagrantly of his success that it seemed to Ase that
Nat must be as loathsome in his own territory as here. Then it
struck him that his son comported himself far otherwise, no
doubt, where the opinions of men were to him important. Ase was
aware of a subtle insolence in Nat's bragging before him.</p>

<p>Arent had not changed in the nearly ten years of absence, had
neither hardened nor softened. He was still so much a nonentity
that Ase, even during the few days of the visit, often forgot
that Arent was in or about the house. Arent was dressed
expensively, but with a drab modesty that made Ase once again
unhappily certain that Nat kept his satellite inconspicuous for
his own reasons.</p>

<p>Ase was most disturbed by the response of Willis to this
visitation of the apparent mighty. The boy was attending the
Normal School, studying to become a teacher.</p>

<p>Willis had a wry wit, and for all his aloofness, Ase
remembered, the boy had said to him, "I'm not any good, Pa. Maybe
I can teach kids that are smarter than I am. Just telling them
nobody knows anything, and to go on from there."</p>

<p>But now, Willis followed Nat as a moth to a candle. The truth
appeared. Nat had had business in the central part of the
country, and had, aside from his commerce, returned to the Linden
farm for the main purpose of taking Willis away with him.</p>

<p>Nat expounded his plan. It was to take Willis back with him,
to send him to the new University nearby, to take his degrees
toward a professorship, to meet and mingle with men of
prominence.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Seems to me Will is cut out for geology. I can make
him the greatest geologist in the West."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I think he should stay here."</p>

<p>His protest sounded small and narrow even to his own ears.</p>

<p>Nat said impatiently, "Now, Pa, you had fits, in your funny
sort of quiet way, when I wouldn't finish college. Here Willis
has a chance to get somewhere, be somebody, and all you can say
is, 'I don't think he should go.' There's no future for him here.
I'm trying to help him and you're trying to hold him back."</p>

<p>Nat's proposition was valid on the surface. Ase searched his
mind for an answer and could find none. Only an obscure instinct
warned him. There was something behind Nat's apparent altruism.
Ase could not put his finger on it. He recalled with relief his
own idea that success might soften Nat. Perhaps this was the
first sign of it. He turned to Willis, and as he did so, Nat
spoke.</p>

<p>"Will, you're a great guy. Pa doesn't seem to think so. It's
up to you, fellow. You want to stick around here, teaching in a
country school, or following a plow, or you want to go with me? I
believe in you, boy, by God, I need you with me."</p>

<p>Willis looked at his father. His face was transfused with
light.</p>

<p>He said, "Nat really wants me."</p>

<p>Ase wanted to cry out, "I want you, I believe in you, too, but
something here is wrong," and could not say it.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, son?"</p>

<p>Willis said, "I want to go with Nat."</p>

<p>So, it was done, his offspring were gone, strangers, all. Eric
drove them to the Peytonville station of an afternoon. The
carriage had no sooner disappeared over the bridge than Nellie
shrieked. The garden tomatoes were over-ripe and must be canned
at once. Ase trudged to the log cabin to inform big Elsa of
Nellie's need for her.</p>

<p>For all the kitchen bustle, the Linden house seemed empty.</p>

<p>Ase sat at twilight with Eric Svenson on the south steps of
the log cabin. Eric puffed on a clay pipe. Ase whittled out the
rough shape of an ornament for a mirror frame he was making for
little Elsa, her mother's namesake. The child leaned against him,
her long fair hair flowing over his sleeve.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand to the rosette he was carving.</p>

<p>"I can see the shape now. It's going to be a hollyhock."</p>

<p>He had been following, as for Nellie's cake tree, a design he
had seen in his encyclopedia.</p>

<p>He said, "It wasn't, but I can make it a hollyhock if you'd
like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, please."</p>

<p>The realistic flower would not satisfy him, he knew, but he
would do his best for her. The little girl had the appreciation
of his small gifts that Doll had had. At first he had thought she
was Doll come back to him. The fair hair and blue eyes had snared
him in her babyhood, and her reaching out her arms to him from
her cradle. She was dear to him now, and always would be, but as
time passed he recognized the disparity in the two child natures.
Elsa was passive where Doll had been volatile. Elsa's imagination
went with his so far, then stopped short behind the increasingly
plain, sweet face. No, she was her good mother all over again,
and no Dolly. Theirs was a friendship past the gap in years, a
solid thing he was sure, but there was no glory in it. He began
widening the swirls of the rosette, to make a hollyhock.</p>

<p>Eric said, "Willis was pretty good help. I hated to see him
leave us. We'll be short handed."</p>

<p>Ase did not answer.</p>

<p>"The peach orchard has to be pruned this fall, Mr. Linden.
Maybe it can wait until the crops are in, but I think it's going
to make us nice money if we take care of it properly."</p>

<p>From the south of the log cabin the peach orchard was remotely
visible on its hill above Pip Lake. Eric had been as enthusiastic
as he in its planting and nurturing, the trees ready now for full
bearing, after two small crops.</p>

<p>Eric had said, "It will make us money, if we take care of it,"
and Eric had no stake in the orchard, none at all.</p>

<p>Ase laid down his carving. Eric had given more than he had
received. True, they were raising the stock on equal shares, the
lambs, the pigs, the calves, even the colts, but Eric was still
the hired hand, owning neither land nor home. Well, he was a
tenant, too. He had forgotten for too long a time that he,
himself, owned neither land nor home.</p>

<p>Eric said, "I want to fix up the cabin. Elsa and I hoped we'd
have more children after little Elsa, but I guess, at our age, we
were lucky to have a child at all. We've saved money, Mr. Linden,
and I'd like to make additions to the cabin, if it's all right
with you. We need another bedroom and a bigger kitchen and Elsa
wants a back porch. I can do the work."</p>

<p>"I'll provide the materials, Eric. I can't let you spend your
own money."</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, would you consider selling us the cabin, even
with only an acre or two of land?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I can't."</p>

<p>"I know how you must feel about it, the original house and
all."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, Eric. I don't own it myself."</p>

<p>Eric's alarm was clear.</p>

<p>Ase repeated, "I don't own my own house or any of the land. My
brother has allowed me the use of it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I never knew. Where is your brother, Mr.
Linden?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Eric twisted his crippled hands together. It was a constant
habit, as though he might so restore the crushed bones and
tendons.</p>

<p>Ase said, "If you want to buy somewhere, Eric, I won't hold
you here."</p>

<p>Eric said slowly, "No, I've put myself into this land. I
couldn't leave it. It would be like leaving my two Elsas. The use
of it's good enough. It's home, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>They stared together over the rich farm, the rolling hills,
the lush crops and orchards.</p>

<p>Ase felt relief from a weight he had not acknowledged. He had
dreaded Eric's leaving for land of his own.</p>

<p>He said, "I should have told you when you first came,
but--"</p>

<p>"But I was a down-and-outer. Having the cabin, and a job, and
Elsa, it was more than I'd hoped for. The other doesn't matter. I
guess you feel the same way."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And it's home to you, anyway, too."</p>

<p>To this, Ase could not answer, nor would he. His home was
otherwhere, unknown, unfound.</p>

<p>"Hard to see why your brother would leave it. It's beautiful
land, Mr. Linden. I guess you have to love it."</p>

<p>"I expect any land is beautiful if you love it."</p>

<p>"Or if you love it, maybe that makes it beautiful."</p>

<p>The two men smiled across the golden head of the child in
understanding. Eric could not fill the place of Tim McCarthy, or
Mink Fisher, or the gypsies, as young Elsa could not fill the
place of Doll, but Ase took comfort from his presence. Eric's
content warmed him like a hearth fire. Night fell and the summer
stars came into bloom like that of orchards. Big Elsa returned to
the cabin, laughing.</p>

<p>"Working with Mrs. Linden is as good as going to the circus,"
she said. "She has supper ready for you now, Mr. Linden. We
finished the canning."</p>

<p>He put his knife and carving in his pocket, young Elsa stood
on tiptoe to be kissed goodnight, and he trudged down the road to
his lighted house. It was filled with the acid sweetness of the
tomatoes. The multiple jars stood upside down on the kitchen
table, to be checked for leakage. Supper was laid on the dining
table, strangely large now for the two of them.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Glad I had something to do when the kids left. I
wouldn't want Nat sweating himself out on the farm, Lord knows,
but I feel awful empty every time he comes and goes."</p>

<p>He laid his cheek against hers. She was so bustling, so
self-sufficient, it was difficult to realize that she, too, ached
for a lost loved one. For the moment, he forgave Nat his sins,
for the love of his mother. Nellie spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Sorry supper's so late, but you wouldn't have noticed. Off
with that Eric, gabbing away, gabbing away. You and your
cronies."</p>

<p>He was amused, he was enchanted by her jealousy of his male
companionship, now that he understood it.</p>

<p>"Now, Nellie, you know I'd rather have been with you, but you
had to can tomatoes. You told me to get my big feet out,
remember?"</p>

<p>He put his arms around her in his tenderness. She pushed him
away.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," she said. "Not tonight. I'm too
tired."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c35">XXXV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Nellie laid down the letter and pushed her spectacles back on
the top of her head. Ase smiled. The effect was as though she
wore a humorous little crown. He tried to remember when her hair
had turned in color to a shining silver. It must have come
imperceptibly, for he had not been truly aware of a difference
until this moment. Her unlined, unwrinkled face was as plump as
ever, her cheeks as pink, her eyes as blue. He watched her
fatuously.</p>

<p>She said, "Don't you want to know the news? Come on back to
earth. What were you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"About you."</p>

<p>"What about me?"</p>

<p>"You're so pretty, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense. Listen, now. 'Melie wants to come home to
be married to that man Crockett. Nat and Arent and Willis want to
come, too. Nat's giving 'Melie the wedding."</p>

<p>"Why, that's fine."</p>

<p>"High time, too. I was sure 'Melie was going to be an old
maid. Seemed to be born for it, so bossy. Past thirty, too. Bet
she's got a ring in the poor fellow's nose already."</p>

<p>Yes, he thought, 'Melie's husband would gee and haw as she
cracked her whip.</p>

<p>He said, "It's been a long time since we've had the children
all together."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Ase, I've got to have new curtains and rugs for
the wedding. Nat offers money, 'Melie says, but I don't want to
take it. Can you drive me to Trent tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Out of his wealth Nat had showered gifts on his mother. He had
had a rural telephone installed for her, paying for two miles of
line. He had given her a furnace. In his own modest prosperity,
Ase had planned to surprise Nellie with these himself. He had
been too slow in getting around to them. When Nat's gifts were
expensive, Nat mentioned the cost. If Nellie's letters of thanks
were slow in reaching him, he wrote impatiently, "Didn't you get
the watch? I paid two hundred for it," and "What did Pa say about
that five-hundred-dollar sealskin coat? What did they say at the
Grange when you showed up in it?"</p>

<p>Ase was embarrassed by Nat's avidity for praise and public
acknowledgment. Nellie cooperated, and repeated prices everywhere
with na&iuml;ve pride and pleasure. Nat had asked what his father
wanted for himself. Only an interesting book now and then, he
replied. Nat had placed a standing order with a Western book
shop, and such a succession of strange books arrived, "A Girl of
the Limberlost," "Pollyanna," that Ase wrote hastily to stop
them, saying only his thanks, and that he had all the books he
needed, ashamed of himself for the untruth. He needed ten
thousand books, but not of this ilk. He heard of a great library
in the City of New York, and now that he could afford to indulge
himself, had written there, asking for recommendations of
interesting books, describing himself as a farmer nearing sixty.
He had received a catalogue of farm manuals.</p>

<p>The October sunlight had a strange quality, he noticed now, as
it played over one of the doorknobs. It lay thinly for a moment,
moved on to rest on Nellie's enormous potted fern on a tall
stand, and slid down the fronds like a trickle of leaf-stained
golden water, passed across the carpet and was gone. So, it was
late afternoon and time for his chores. He was conscious of the
stillness. It was good, in a way, but he was glad the children
were returning once more. He had missed them.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "If you'll please answer me, Ase. Can you take me
to Trent tomorrow to get things or not? Shouldn't think you'd
want Nat to do every blessed thing about the wedding."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said. "We can leave as early as you say."</p>

<p>For three weeks the correspondence was heavy between Nellie
and Nat and 'Melie. Nat had his way at last, for a church wedding
in Peytonville, with a reception afterward at the Linden house.
Both Elsas helped Nellie with a prodigious amount of baking and
cleaning and planning. The whole business seemed to Ase like some
primitive ritual, the ancient sacrifice of the bride, a tribal
thing, and he was amused. 'Melie was no longer young, and he was
certain that it was the groom who was being delivered up to her
purposes, and Nat's. Well, he was anxious to see them all again,
the offspring he had begotten.</p>

<p>Two automobiles drove up the road and stopped. Ase stared at
the strangers walking up the front path. He would have known
'Melie and Willis. He would have passed without recognition the
big suave man who was Nat and the shifty-eyed thin one who was
Arent. He went down the front steps to meet them. Nat laid an arm
patronizingly across his father's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Crock," he said, "meet my old man."</p>

<p>Crockett shook hands indifferently. 'Melie hugged her
father.</p>

<p>Nat shouted, "Get on out here, Ma! Ma!"</p>

<p>They crowded into the living-room. Nellie came running, wiping
her hands on her apron.</p>

<p>"You would catch me in the biscuit dough."</p>

<p>Nat lifted her from her feet and swung her. She shrieked and
pummeled him. The others pushed in for their share of embracing.
Even Arent grinned and rumpled her hair.</p>

<p>She said, "There now, that's over. And this is 'Melie's
Crockett, eh, poor fellow."</p>

<p>Nat whooped.</p>

<p>"Take a better look at him, Ma. I turned Sis loose on him
because he can take care of himself."</p>

<p>Crockett said, "Besides a little item of my knowing too much,
Nat. I'm safer inside the family than out."</p>

<p>His tone was light, but his eyes, Ase noticed, were as cold as
Nat's. He was almost another Nat, nearly as bulky, almost as
smoothly over-tailored, as confident, yet Ase sensed a weakness
in the face that was not in Nat's. 'Melie was as assured as ever.
In her full maturity she so resembled old Amelia that Ase was
startled. It was her fashionable clothes that had made her for a
moment alien. Willis laid a hand on his father's arm.</p>

<p>"Hey, Pa," he said. "Mighty good to see you. Been 'way too
long."</p>

<p>Ase looked hungrily into the face of this, his youngest, the
one who had so nearly missed coming close to him, as a needed
shower of rain sometimes skirts one field. Willis' eyes were sad,
like those of a good dog who has been betrayed.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, Will. You and I'll have to get out of all this
and have a talk some day."</p>

<p>He thought perhaps it was not even yet too late for
understanding. Willis moved away abruptly.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now 'Melie, you take these hoodlums and pick out
their rooms. Your Pa and I use the front downstairs bedroom, so
there's the downstairs back, and the four upstairs, and if they
don't go around, somebody can sleep at the tenant house. You and
Crockett should have got married before you came, unless you're
ready to double up right now."</p>

<p>Nat said, "Why, Ma, I'm ashamed of you," and roared.</p>

<p>Nellie said innocently, "I hear tell it's been done," and Nat
whooped again.</p>

<p>She and Nat had always spoken much the same language, he had
been her white-haired boy, and the one quality in him that Ase
could approve was his adoration for his mother, a clean thing in
the center of something soiled.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Now Ma, if you think I'm going to bed down with the
hired help, you're mistaken. I want that back downstairs bedroom
myself. Never got to sleep there when I was a kid, nobody allowed
there but company, and Pa's McCarthy and that old Indian. Think
I've spent enough on the house to be company this time."</p>

<p>'Melie herded the family upstairs with their luggage. Nat sat
down and lit a cigar.</p>

<p>He said, "You've got things looking pretty good, Ma, for an
old farmhouse. Listen now, these carpets are too old-fashioned. I
want you to take 'em up, have the floors finished and polished,
they're hard maple, aren't they, Pa? I'm going to send you some
Oriental rugs. Nothing's too good for Nat Linden's Ma. Look."</p>

<p>He drew out his wallet, making a casual show of the bills of
large denomination, and brought out a colored plate of a rug.</p>

<p>"How's that? Pretty fancy? Four hundred dollars and the small
ones to go with it a hundred each. Like it, Ma? Here, Pa, how's
it look to you?"</p>

<p>Ase studied the pattern and the colors. They were like his
southwest field in autumn, except that the red sumac, the tawny
pasture grass, the green pines, the deep blue of twilight, were
in their reality more beautiful. He did not answer.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Let's see the picture again. I don't know, Nat,
I like the carpets. Got this one new, for you to come. They're so
nice and warm underfoot in winter."</p>

<p>Nat frowned, irritated.</p>

<p>"Now, Ma, that coal furnace I gave you keeps the house hot as
hell and I know it. I want you to fix things up, live in
style."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Style's all right for you, that big house you
say you have, all kinds of help, but Pa and I like it here just
the way we have it."</p>

<p>The rest of the family came trooping downstairs. Crockett was
fascinated by the huge zinc bathtub encased in matchwood, by the
windmill that pumped the water for the house.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Will, you'd better go around with him. A city guy
can get into all sorts of trouble on a farm. Can't have our groom
falling in the well."</p>

<p>He was the benevolent brother, watching after them all.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Nat, I always thought you'd marry young and have
a big family. You used to like the girls."</p>

<p>Nat laughed complacently.</p>

<p>"Still do, Ma. Girls. Don't take much to the brood-hens. Maybe
some day I'll buy me something handsome for my house."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "'Melie, where are you and Crock going to live
when you go back?"</p>

<p>"Why, in Nat's house, just the same as before. He likes to
have Crock and me handy. Seems to think I do a pretty good job of
running the place."</p>

<p>Nat said, "She certainly does. I have a lot of, well, business
and political company, Ma, sometimes late at night, and believe
me, 'Melie keeps a whip-hand over that Jap help, gets 'em out to
serve the drinks, and the food, oh man. Not as good as yours, Ma,
but mighty fancy."</p>

<p>Ase cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Political company, you say, son?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>Nat puffed on his cigar.</p>

<p>Ase was stirred. It had always seemed to him that there could
be no nobler work, after that, perhaps, of the physician, the
teacher, the judge and the minister, than for a man to serve his
state, his country, in the legislative halls. He thought that he
might have misjudged Nat after all.</p>

<p>He said, "I'd be proud to hear that you're running for your
State Legislature, Nat. Maybe even for the United States
Congress."</p>

<p>Nat guffawed. He started to flick his cigar ash.</p>

<p>Nellie said sharply, "Now you just wait a minute, young man.
If you've got to stink up my clean house, you don't have to drop
that mess on my new carpet."</p>

<p>She brought a kitchen saucer and thumped it down on the table
beside him. He patted her arm.</p>

<p>"Ma, if a fellow was dying, you'd be afraid he'd dirty the
bed."</p>

<p>Ase recalled Nellie's horror over Tim McCarthy and Mink
Fisher. Nat had then this sensitivity, this understanding, surely
he had been mistaken in his eldest son.</p>

<p>He said eagerly, "Perhaps you can't discuss it yet."</p>

<p>Nat blew a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Pa, I wouldn't be caught dead in the State Legislature or
Congress, either. In another couple of years, I'll have our whole
legislature right in my pocket, cheap, too."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't. You've lived all your life like a stick in the
mud, no offense, but you're just an old-fashioned farmer.
Politics aren't what you think they are."</p>

<p>Ase was suddenly angry.</p>

<p>"What are they, then, if they don't serve the people?"</p>

<p>"Now Pa, the people get served. They get roads and bridges and
courthouses and railroads. Schools, too, and you ought to like
that, my God, the stew you made when I wouldn't finish college.
Smartest thing I ever did was when I got out."</p>

<p>Nat was angry, too. He leaned forward and waved his cigar.</p>

<p>"And it's Nat Linden--Nathaniel--Grandmother had fits about
calling me Nathaniel--hell, I've got to the top as Nat
Linden--Nat Linden, a poor farm boy, he's building all that
stuff. And getting his, believe me--."</p>

<p>He took out his monogrammed handkerchief and mopped his face.
He stubbed out his cigar on Nellie's saucer. He sat back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Now I don't say but that some time maybe I'd enjoy being
Governor. Not so much in it, you know, but still, 'Governor.'
Maybe about the time I buy me my blonde."</p>

<p>Ase felt sick at heart.</p>

<p>He said, "I hate to hear that your state legislators can be
bought. I don't see why anyone would want to put them in his
pocket, as you say. But the Congress has honest men."</p>

<p>"Some of 'em, sure. Lot of them the same little cheap guys.
Live on a dog's wages, why, they have to make something on the
side."</p>

<p>Ase stood up, a lean old man towering over his son.</p>

<p>He said, "I don't believe you."</p>

<p>He left the house in search of Willis. He found him at the
barns, stroking the nose of a new-born calf in the stall with its
mother.</p>

<p>"Will?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Pa."</p>

<p>"Will, Nat's been telling me things I don't like. Something's
wrong. How does he make so much money out of his building?"</p>

<p>Willis said, "You know Nat, Pa. It's more than the building.
He has lots of irons in the fire."</p>

<p>"Is he making all this money honestly?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask him?"</p>

<p>"I can talk better to you."</p>

<p>"I'm just a little cog in Nat's machine, Pa. It isn't up to me
to do any talking, even to you."</p>

<p>"Will, I wish you'd get out. You don't belong with the rest of
them."</p>

<p>"That's what I used to think. I can't quit now."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's just too late, that's all."</p>

<p>"You're still a young man, son."</p>

<p>"You get old fast when you work with Nat. Don't worry, Pa. I
make a good living. I'd never have amounted to much, anyway."</p>

<p>Perhaps not, Ase thought. Yet something in Willis had been
waylaid and destroyed. He had taken the easy road instead of the
hard one, but it was the easy road that had proved dark and
tortuous.</p>

<p>Ase put off his return to the house. He made his chores last
as long as possible. 'Melie and young Elsa were putting Nellie's
lavish supper on the table, Nat was demanding another brand of
preserves with a jovial perversity, his henchmen were laughing at
his wit. Ase washed up and slipped into his seat. The family ate
hugely, they were like a school of voracious fish feeding under
the sea of chatter. They talked of the barbecues of the West, of
the Pioneer Picnics near Peytonville, of Nellie's freezers of
Sunday ice cream in the summers of their childhood, and ended
back in Nat's establishment, describing the Japanese servants and
the fabulous parties. Nat slapped his great paunch and said he
could not hold as much more as a caraway seed. Nellie brought out
her cake tree, long unused. Nat chose first among the cup cakes
like flowers on their wooden thorns, torn between the white
frosting dotted with red cinnamon drops and the chocolate
sprinkled with silver pellets, the fresh cocoanut and the
raisin-thick spice, and took one of each.</p>

<p>'Melie laid a chocolate cup cake on Crockett's plate. He
pushed it aside and reached for a cocoanut. He did not then allow
the ring in his nose to chafe him. Ase was aware of an oddly
settled relationship between the pair. They were scarcely
bride-and-groom-to-be, but more a long-married couple with a
mutual acceptance and no love at all. Their intimacy was
obviously of long standing. It must have been almost passionless,
an affair, rather than a marriage, of convenience. Nat's tight
little family empire ran smoothly.</p>

<p>Ase was anxious for the talk to turn away from trivial
matters. His sons and their companion were at least men of the
world and would know more of tides and currents than his papers
gave him.</p>

<p>He asked, "How does the West feel about the re-election of
President Wilson?"</p>

<p>Nat clipped the end from a cigar.</p>

<p>"Biggest fool thing the country's ever done. What does a damn
professor know about government?"</p>

<p>Ase persisted, "What do they think out there about the
possibility of war?"</p>

<p>"Anything's possible under the guy. He's too full of ideas. No
common sense."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Stepping on toes, Nat. Your Pa was the only man
in the township to vote for him."</p>

<p>Nat held his cigar halfway to his mouth.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Pa, what's the matter with you? You must have
known you could have saved yourself the trip to Peytonville. One
lone vote."</p>

<p>He said stubbornly, "But it was mine."</p>

<p>He must speak now, Ase thought, he must speak of the necessity
for a man to make his choice of issues and of values, to respect
the privilege of the vote itself, lone voice or no. He tried to
think of the words that would express his meaning.</p>

<p>Nat said easily, "Forget all this political stuff at your age,
Pa. Time you were sitting back and taking things easy. That goes
for you, too, Ma. Let the hired man's wife or that pretty girl of
his do your cooking." He winked at her. "That is, after I
leave."</p>

<p>He yawned.</p>

<p>"Been a long day. Crock, you and Arent put the cars up the
side drive."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I thought you were going to come by train."</p>

<p>"Did. Had the cars sent on ahead to Trent by freight."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you need two."</p>

<p>"One for my gang and one for me and you, Ma."</p>

<p>He stood and stretched.</p>

<p>"Bed, everybody."</p>

<p>They went like obedient children.</p>

<p>Ase sat alone after the flock had broken up and gone away like
roosting birds. 'Melie, he thought, for all her hardness,
deserved better than this Crockett. He was aware of a corruption
in the man somehow more reptilian than Nat's. He dismissed the
concept but remained disturbed. It would be of no use to discuss
it with Nellie. Their daughter was being married elegantly and at
last, to a man of Nat's choice. She would, he knew, be as
horrified by his suggestion of evil expanding in the family, as
he found himself by the fact.</p>

<p>The November evening turned chill. He touched a match to the
fire laid in the stove. Nellie would scold him for making a mess
the last thing at night, but he needed the warmth and the
primitive light of the flames. He seemed to stand alone on a
desolate shore while the tide went out. He was stranded there, no
ship to bear him to sea, no horse to bear him inland. The wind
keened high overhead and then was gone, passing trackless toward
the uncharted stars.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c36">XXXVI</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase stood lost and appalled at the wedding reception. Nat had
had so many engraved invitations sent out that Nellie had
commented, "He must have just used the tax list." Nat had hired a
caterer from Trent to provide the feast, complete with champagne.
The good friends, the neighbors, the relatives, were filing by
the tables of gifts. In their esteem and affection for Ase and
Nellie, the Grange had dipped into its treasury and sent a table
service of plated silver in its own red imitation leather box.
All over the township the women had set to and made their gifts
for the Linden girl, a lace-trimmed pincushion, three kitchen
dish towels, a cross-stitched hand towel, a set of calico pot
holders, a matchholder with two sandpaper cats, one large, one
small, and the caption, "Don't scratch me, scratch Mother," a
gingham apron, an organdy party apron, a silk sewing bag, a pair
of crochet-edged pillow slips. Miss Minnie the milliner had hand
painted one of her famous cake plates in full-blown magenta
roses, neglecting her trade to finish it in time. The banker and
his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Peyton of the General Store, the
hotel-keeper, the Academy principal and his wife, had sent such
store-bought presents as cut glass jelly dishes and sets of
teacups. Aunt Jess was too feeble to attend any of the
ceremonies. She had sent a note, "For the little girl I helped
bring into the world," and with it a rare old gold and garnet
brooch, her one treasure, Ase knew. Nellie's family, the Wilsons,
had agreed that it was proper for 'Melie to have their dozen
heirloom hand-woven linen sheets. These last two gifts stood out
proudly, the only ones remotely able to face the array from Nat's
business and political associates in the west.</p>

<p>The governor of Nat's state had sent a mammoth silver service
tray. There were a gold-lined silver punch bowl, pitchers,
goblets and two sets of sterling table silver that together would
make place settings for a hundred people. There were imported
linens, ornate clocks and complete dinner services of Limoges and
Wedgwood. Ase discovered the cheap plate from the Grange between
the two sterling services. Nat stood nearby, faintly flushed,
telling Miss Minnie the source of each western gift. Ase waited
until Nat turned away from her.</p>

<p>He said, "Nat, how did these things happen to be sent here,
when they'll have to be shipped back west again?"</p>

<p>Nat rocked on his heels complacently.</p>

<p>"At my request."</p>

<p>"But they shame the folks."</p>

<p>"That's exactly the idea."</p>

<p>"Why, they'd about forgotten you and 'Melie."</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten them. And they won't forget me again.
Remember when I out-grew my suit and had to go on wearing it to
the Academy anyway, and got laughed at? And you peddled wood one
winter? Let 'em look at Nat Linden now. And I've just
started."</p>

<p>So Nat had built his life on a boy's bitterness. No, Ase
thought, this was only an excuse to build as he would have done
anyway.</p>

<p>He noticed the Widow Bedford standing in front of the display
of silver. Her knotted hands held her shabby black purse against
her stomach. She had dressed up her old felt hat with a tail
feather from her red rooster and the feather, working loose,
dipped toward her shoulder. He pushed his way to her.</p>

<p>She said, "My it's elegant, Ase. If we'd of known, been better
not to of tried to give to 'Melie. She'll think cheap of us."</p>

<p>"Which is your present? I didn't notice."</p>

<p>She turned with a flash of brightness and pointed to another
table.</p>

<p>"Pincushion."</p>

<p>He took it in his big hand. Its fat surface was covered with
an assortment of pins, plain and color-beaded, arranged in a
geometric design.</p>

<p>He said, "This is fine. Only trouble, 'Melie'll hate to use
the pins and break up the pattern. Isn't this real lace around
the edge?"</p>

<p>She touched it tenderly.</p>

<p>"From my first baby's christening dress. Satin's from my
wedding petticoat. Hated to cut into it, but I said to myself,
'Don't you be selfish, Lulu Bedford. Get it over with and you can
make pincushions other times, weddings and Christmas and the
like.' I do love a pretty pincushion."</p>

<p>He was desperate. He gathered his courage.</p>

<p>He said, "All that fancy silver and china doesn't mean a
thing. It came from men Nat does business with. Like paying a
drummer's commission. It's presents like this one 'Melie really
needed."</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Now that's so. She'll likely put all that other away and
never use it. Know I would. Guess we've given her a good start on
housekeeping, amongst us. That embroidered set from the Sewing
Circle, I helped on that, it's nice, but not too nice to
use."</p>

<p>She took the pincushion from him and replaced it on the
table.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Never could get over the idea a man'll always get
dirt on anything white."</p>

<p>She looked with satisfaction over the cross-stitched towels,
the potholders, the pillow slips.</p>

<p>"Another thing, too, Ase, these'll remind 'Melie of home. My,
she must get lonesome, way out there."</p>

<p>He said, "Maybe we seem way out here to people way out
there."</p>

<p>She chuckled and left him, to hunt out the president of the
Ladies' Sewing Circle. Ase went slowly past the gifts from the
home friends, memorizing as far as possible who had made or given
this or that. He spoke awkwardly and admiringly of stitching, of
crochet, of pansy-painted velvet plaque.</p>

<p>He clung like a drowning man to the Widow Bedford's words,
repeating, "It's what 'Melie needed for housekeeping. It will
remind her of home."</p>

<p>He reached Miss Minnie. In a moment of panic he forgot the
nature of her gift. It had probably been a hat. Perhaps a fichu
or a jabot, he had heard such terms. He remembered talk of
'Melie's "Going-away" costume.</p>

<p>He said cautiously, "'Melie was pleased with her going-away
present from you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, you haven't got the faintest idea what I gave
'Melie."</p>

<p>So, he had lost his hold on the floating log, the straw.</p>

<p>It would be politic to say, "Whatever it was, I heard 'Melie
speak especially of it."</p>

<p>He looked at her helplessly. She patted her stiff gray curls
and arched her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Just what I always say, a man doesn't ever notice. Never
mind, I understand you dreadful creatures, so I'll tell you. It
was one of my hand painted cake plates, the nicest I've ever
done, if I must say so myself."</p>

<p>He recalled at once the magenta roses and his life-raft. He
swallowed.</p>

<p>"It's what 'Melie needed for housekeeping. It will remind her
of home."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Linden, you do notice. Come to think of it, I
remember when you bought the bonnet for Mrs. Linden, gracious,
how long ago? You wouldn't have anything but that blue bonnet and
I said to myself then, 'Now Mr. Linden appreciates the
artistic.'"</p>

<p>She lowered her voice.</p>

<p>"You're the only one I can ask, please tell me, did you think
the roses had too many petals? I did suffer so, wondering if they
were too full. I get going on rose petals and I can't stop."</p>

<p>He was rescued in his time of need by Nellie.</p>

<p>"Come on, everybody. Nat's present's just been delivered. The
photographer's here, too. Nat wants pictures of everybody
outside."</p>

<p>Nat's "just delivered" gift to the bride and groom was a red
Cadillac car. It had been waiting in the carriage shed for two
days.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The farmhouse was still in confusion two days after the
reception. 'Melie's wedding gifts were strewn everywhere, half
wrapped for shipping or mailing on to the west. The furniture was
disarranged. The flowers drooped in baskets and vases, not quite
dead enough to be thrown away. In the woodshed Ase helped Willis
and Crockett with the re-crating of the bulkier gifts. Nat
strolled into the shed.</p>

<p>He said, "Ma and 'Melie and I have things all worked out.
Arent and Will and I will drive back in the new car. I've got
business on the way. 'Melie and Crock will wait a couple of weeks
and then come on out by train. Pa, you and Ma are coming with
them."</p>

<p>Ase laid down his hammer.</p>

<p>"The whole trip's on me. Won't cost you a cent, Pa. Winter
coming on, you ought to get away for a few months. Time you
crossed the country and saw the world."</p>

<p>Ase thought of the many times he had imagined himself crossing
the country and seeing the world, the panorama of the whole
United States unfolding before his hungry eyes. He might even
find Benjamin, where Nat's search and wide connections had failed
to find him. Then he knew that he could not go as Nat's guest. He
had prospered. He could well afford to pay his own and Nellie's
way. He knew again that it was not Nat's world he longed to see
or could bear to see. He could not go at all.</p>

<p>He said, "Thank you, son, not this year. Some other time your
mother and I will set out on a trip and drop in and surprise
you."</p>

<p>Nat said, "Pa, you old stick-in-the-mud. You've never been
beyond Trent in your life. Don't you have a scrap of curiosity in
you? Don't you want to see farther than your own fields and
fences?"</p>

<p>Why, Ase thought, his feet had itched all his life to walk on
stranger roads. His heart had awakened him, pounding in the
night, from dreams of meeting stranger people, red, white,
yellow, black and brown. In the dreams he sat with them beside
their various hearth fires, sharing with them the alien foods of
the encyclopedia, mysteriously communicating freely in alien
tongues. He was half blind in his mind's eye from peering across
the continent, and into the suns of foreign lands, and beyond
them, beyond the Coral Sea and the Caribbean, to Europe and
Iceland, Cape Horn and the newly discovered North Pole, past
Africa and India, the Great Wall of China and forbidden Nepal and
the steppes of Russia, into the Alps, the Andes and the
Himalayas, and high above these, up into inter-stellar spaces, so
dazzling that he might be unable to face it if he found it, the
home he yearned for, the true and final home that was not and
never had been nor could be, the old Linden farm near
Peytonville.</p>

<p>Nat said, "Listen now, Ma wants to go."</p>

<p>"What were you saying?"</p>

<p>"Pa, I don't see how she puts up with you. I was saying, Ma's
got her heart set on this trip."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>Ase picked up the hammer and drove another nail in a crate. He
thought warily that he must speak with Nellie alone, to make
certain of this.</p>

<p>He said, "If she really wants to go, no reason why she can't
go without me."</p>

<p>He was surprised when Nat pounded him on the back.</p>

<p>"Pa, that makes sense. Ma wants to see the world and you
don't. One of the Elsas can take care of you. You never know what
you're eating, anyway. God, Ma will knock 'em dead out west.
We'll stop in Chicago and rig her out. Sort of old-timey stuff,
bonnets and flounces. She'll have the Governor eating out of her
hand."</p>

<p>Ase could only privately agree with him. Nellie would be an
asset, with her wit and charm. Nat had always been ashamed of his
father. Yet was it conceivable that Nat was using his mother, as
he used the others?</p>

<p>He said, "If it's all right with your mother, I think all of
you had better leave at the same time."</p>

<p>Nat puffed on his cigar.</p>

<p>"Guess that's a good idea. Sure. Two weeks in the Cadillac,
six days on the train. 'Melie'll get there ahead of me to have
things running."</p>

<p>Willis looked up from his work on the packing of 'Melie's
crates.</p>

<p>He said, "Nat, I think I'll stay behind with Pa for a while.
He'll be pretty lonesome."</p>

<p>Nat said coldly, "Well. We can get along without you fine,
just fine."</p>

<p>Ase sensed the hostility.</p>

<p>He said, "I'll be all right alone."</p>

<p>Willis repeated stubbornly, "I'll stay here a while."</p>

<p>Nat said, "Just a while? Planning to quit? You haven't
forgotten that business at Compton?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't forgotten."</p>

<p>Nat shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Your own funeral, Will, if you have ideas, for a change."</p>

<p>Willis said, "I know."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was true, Ase found, Nellie was exhilarated at the prospect
of the trip west. Nat wanted to drive her to Trent for her
necessary shopping. Ase insisted on taking her himself in the
buggy and paying for the new clothes and luggage. She rejected
firmly a fur-trimmed broadcloth suit that was most becoming,
because of the price. Ase made an excuse to leave her and slipped
back to the shop to buy it. The family was delighted with her
wardrobe. Nat gave a grudging approval.</p>

<p>"Good enough to start out with, Ma. I'll fix you up right
later."</p>

<p>She said tartly, "Now I've no intention of letting you rig me
out like a Christmas tree. Seems to me we've already overdone
things."</p>

<p>Nat laughed.</p>

<p>"You'll change your mind when you see the clothes at
Townsend's."</p>

<p>The two sections of the family got on their way in a confusion
of equipment. The Cadillac left, heavy-loaded. Eric drove one of
the cars to the freight station, Willis the other. Ase drove
Nellie in the light buggy. She clutched his arm in a sudden
panic.</p>

<p>"Ase, I don't want to go. I can't leave you."</p>

<p>He reined in and held her close. She cried against his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He said, "Now, Nat and 'Melie want to show you off. Just have
a good time and tell me all about it when you come home. I'll get
along all right."</p>

<p>She sniffled and blew her nose and sat up.</p>

<p>"I know. I'd have had to go some time. And Lord knows, Elsa's
a better cook than your mother was, and you put up with that. Now
Ase, your winter underwear's in the bottom drawer of the cherry
dresser. You get it out the very first day of hard cold."</p>

<p>It was more painful than he had expected, to see the train
puff away, to wave after her. Perhaps he should have gone too, if
only to have spared himself this needless loss of her. He drove
home with Willis and Eric. The house was naked, only the kitchen
cozy. Nellie had left so much cooked food that Elsa was not to
come until the next morning.</p>

<p>Willis said, "Pa, you don't know how peaceful this is, in the
kitchen. Let's eat here and not bother with setting the
dining-room table."</p>

<p>Together they set out a portion of the prepared dishes. Ase
made coffee. Willis brought butter and cream from the pantry.
They ate in a comfortable silence. Willis stacked the dishes in
the sink. They lingered in the kitchen, where the wood range
glowed red.</p>

<p>Willis said, "Pa."</p>

<p>"Yes, son."</p>

<p>"Did you wonder why I stayed behind?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes."</p>

<p>"Pa, you were right. I've got to get away from Nat. It's worse
than you imagined. It's more than Nat's being crooked."</p>

<p>Ase shoved a stick of wood into the stove.</p>

<p>He said, "You'd better tell me."</p>

<p>Willis leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Pa. Arent and Crock do the dirty work. Nat keeps his own
hands clean, as far as anyone's been able to prove."</p>

<p>"I suppose Nat makes deals, as they say, to get the contracts
for those roads and bridges and buildings he talked about. He
probably pays money to men in the legislature to pass bills for
the appropriations."</p>

<p>"That's the least of it. Most of the time he builds with
inferior materials. Some of his buildings are fire traps, ways
that don't show on the surface. One of his bridges has already
fallen in. A car full of people just made it across. He got the
blame shifted to a sub-contractor. The fellow's in jail right
now. One state senator had been fighting Nat. He had some
proof--."</p>

<p>"Go on, son."</p>

<p>"They called it suicide. Maybe it was, maybe it was."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't?"</p>

<p>"If it wasn't, it was Crock. Nat would keep Arent out of a
thing like that."</p>

<p>"Will, what is your part in this?"</p>

<p>"Well, Pa, I'm a front for Nat on some of his new projects.
Mining, oil. Remember, he was going to make me a famous
geologist? That's what I am, all right. You just bet I am, Nat
planned it that way. I got my Master's degree and my Doctor's
degree, and Nat said I didn't need to go any farther, he'd set me
up in a laboratory of my own. I'd always thought I'd like
research instead of teaching. Research, sure--. Analyses, sure--.
God."</p>

<p>Ase said, "But Nat told me you were doing this."</p>

<p>"I'm doing it. For Nat. He has me set up in this famous
geological laboratory, and I'm not supposed to have any
connection with him, and he sends in 'samples,' samples of ore,
samples of soil where oil might be promising, and I run the tests
and make the reports, and then Nat sells this land all through
the West where there aren't minerals or oil at all, and all the
little fellows that buy his land are stuck with it, ruined."</p>

<p>Ase said, "But aren't your reports correct?"</p>

<p>"They are, but what Nat does is to bring in samples to my
laboratory that don't have anything to do with the land he's
selling, the companies he sells stock in. Somehow, he keeps just
within the law."</p>

<p>"You'll have to leave him and go into some other laboratory or
company, Will."</p>

<p>"I signed a contract with him. I can't work at my profession
for anyone else. He paid for my education, remember. I signed
before I knew."</p>

<p>Willis turned his face to his father in the dusk.</p>

<p>"Pa, you tried to keep me from going. When you did, did you
know about Nat?"</p>

<p>Ase felt the sweat on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Because if you did, you should have told me."</p>

<p>Willis, the shy, the mild, was suddenly his accuser. What
could he say now, and what was the truth of his knowledge of Nat,
after all? The ruthless greed he had always recognized. Other men
were cursed by it and it did not lead them into devious ways. The
gypsy boy that Nat had pushed into the bog--but he may only have
jostled him in a boy's rough play, quite without malice. Nat's
own letters from Alaska--the desperate men who bought with their
savings the worthless claims, where a few gold nuggets under a
boulder paid high dividends--but sometimes a worthless claim had
suddenly proved out, and every man who had gone into the fevered
Yukon had known he was gambling.</p>

<p>"Will, can you be sure about these things?"</p>

<p>The fire in the wood range burned low. The kitchen was in
darkness, no lamp lighted.</p>

<p>"The bribes, the rotten crookedness, yes. The big things, no.
I couldn't prove them. Nat's too smart to let them be proved. I
just know that Nat is bad, Pa. All bad. Did you? Did you always
know he was bad?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid for him, son, but I didn't know. We don't know
now, do we?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you think it's only that I'm jealous of Nat. Maybe I
am. I used to be. Ma and Grandma made such a fuss over him and
you had Dolly. I didn't seem to belong."</p>

<p>The man was explained, and the boy he had been. Ase grieved
for him. He gathered his thoughts to tell his son of his own
youth, outcast. Willis stood and spoke briskly.</p>

<p>"No, Pa, it isn't jealousy. It's just all too rank for my
stomach. I'll figure out something to do. I'm not going back if I
can help it, but it may take a miracle."</p>

<p>"Will, think about the farm. It's doing well. I've always
hoped one of you boys would stay."</p>

<p>"Thanks, no. I'm on Nat's side there. No use slaving away on
land you don't own. Good night, Pa."</p>

<p>"Good night, Willis."</p>

<p>Ase went to his bed, strange without Nellie, and lay long
awake.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c37">XXXVII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was as though Willis' confidences had never been. Ase
prodded his own timidity, to speak, to try to reach his son
again, and Willis evaded him. He seemed to have regretted his
revelations. He lingered on at the farm, withdrawn and brooding.
Eric sensed some impasse, did his best to interest Willis as a
scientist in the problem of the orchards. New diseases were
attacking the fruit. The apple orchard was past its prime true
but a sickness was on it that was not of age. Eric suggested
experiments with sprays.</p>

<p>Willis said, "That's out of my line," and would not be
allured.</p>

<p>Big Elsa mothered him and young Elsa was kind, even tender.
Their company seemed to solace him and he spent long hours at the
cabin. Ase had a sudden hope of the sweet-faced girl born to be
wife and helpmate and mother. He was disappointed when she came
to him with the news that she was shortly to marry a Jan Rabaski.
Willis was unconcerned. Elsa brought her Jan to Ase in shy
pride.</p>

<p>"He's sensitive about his English," she said, "but he's
learning fast."</p>

<p>Ase was drawn at once to the young Pole. He was as plain as
Elsa, as honest, and as dark as she was fair. He had fought in
his country's army and later with the French, had been invalided
out, his lungs affected by gas, and now, in early 1917, had
migrated to America. He was anxious to explain his position, lest
it seem equivocal. He tapped his deep chest.</p>

<p>"I get this cured," he said earnestly, "I go back fight Boche
some more. Maybe you have American army fight then. I join."</p>

<p>Willis too found him interesting. Jan came of farm stock,
small land owners, prosperous enough so that he had planned to
become a scientist. The war had ended that, and now his parents
were dead and their land ravished. His hope lay in America, and
though, his own dream over, he must make his living as a hired
farm hand, it was good that his children would be Americans, they
would go on where he had left off. He was "lucky man," he said,
to have found his Elsa, and, a stranger here, so soon. He was
working for the Grimstedt sons.</p>

<p>"Hard boss," he said, showing his white teeth, "me hard,
too."</p>

<p>He turned to Elsa.</p>

<p>"Me hard? I hard?"</p>

<p>"Almost right, Jan. We would say 'I am hard, too.'"</p>

<p>He repeated after her, an adult and serious scholar,
"I-am-hard-too," stressing the consonants.</p>

<p>When they left, Ase said to Willis, "I'm uneasy about Elsa and
her young man."</p>

<p>"I don't see why."</p>

<p>"The work at Grimstedt's is too much for an invalid."</p>

<p>"He's not an invalid. He's keeping up with it, isn't he? He's
ready to fight again, if his gassed lungs get better, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>Willis stalked away. Ase had noticed his disappearances and
did not know to what obscure refuge he went. He recalled his own
retreats, to Tim McCarthy, to Mink Fisher, to the gypsies, to his
flute. He had not played his flute in years. He had no desire to
play it now.</p>

<p>The weeks passed, Willis sullen, Jan Rabaski and young Elsa
shy and rosy with their love. Jan swore his fits of coughing were
lessening. Jan and Elsa were married in the cabin, a simple
ceremony that seemed to Ase more valid than the marriage of
'Melie and Crockett. A lone peach tree had blossomed early, and
Elsa wore a wreath of peach blossoms in her fair hair. Since Jan
and Elsa could only return to the Grimstedt tenant house, Ase
gave them for wedding present a check. Willis approached his
father. Having abandoned Nat, he was without money, had used all
his small pocket cash.</p>

<p>He said humbly, "Pa, can you do something for me? Get
something for the kids, as if it came from me? I'll pay you back
some day."</p>

<p>'Melie had discarded the set of plated table silver given her
by the Grange. Better to have it used than to collect dust in the
attic. Ase and Willis took it to the bride.</p>

<p>Willis said, "For when you have your own place, Elsa."</p>

<p>She said, "I will use it here. I would use satin and gold if I
had it, to make a home for Jan."</p>

<p>The Grimstedt tenant house was shocking. It reminded Ase of
the hovels Nat had reported erecting in Alaska, no more than four
tilting walls and a roof. Elsa had scrubbed it inch by inch, had
hung white curtains, and Jan was making rough furniture.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I wish I had room for you at my place."</p>

<p>He thought of the space of the Linden house, empty and hollow
once Willis had gone away again. It would be pleasant to have the
young couple living there. He could afford to pay another hand.
In the same instant he knew that Nellie would have none of it.
She would drive them off like a mother bird who will accept no
fledglings but her own.</p>

<p>Elsa said, "Maybe some day we can come to you."</p>

<p>Willis was increasingly restless. Ase wondered if he were
waiting for Nellie's return, not to leave his father entirely
alone. He could not question him. The wall between was as high as
ever.</p>

<p>On a day in April, 1917, Ase's county paper gave the news that
the United States had entered the war. Willis read the headlines
over his shoulder. He paced the room and turned abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well, Pa," he said, "here's my miracle."</p>

<p>Ase read again, as though to change the fact.</p>

<p>Willis said, "Mind driving me to Trent?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you don't want to think it over?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure. Any objections? You wanted me to get away from Nat.
This is it."</p>

<p>Ase had volunteered in his time for the Spanish-American War,
had been rejected, as family men were not needed and he was
over-age. He had offered himself for the simplest of reasons. It
was a man's duty to fight for his country. He thought that many
men must have many reasons. Willis' was not ignoble. He was
risking his life to save his soul.</p>

<p>"No, son. No objections."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready by the time you've hitched up. I haven't got a
thing I want or need. It's all Nat's, he paid for it from my
overcoat to my toothbrush. You can send it back to him. He has
plenty of flunkeys my size."</p>

<p>They drove to the recruiting office in Trent in silence.
Willis waited in line. Ase found the new library and browsed
through it futilely, not knowing what to ask for. He drove back
to wait for Willis. His was almost the only horse and carriage on
the streets. Nat had wanted to give him a Ford automobile, but he
preferred the leisurely pace of wagon and buggy, the clop-clop of
the horses' hoofs, the sweet smell of harness leather and of
living hide. He did not see how a man would have time to watch
the land, time to think, behind the wheel of a car. Willis came
down the steps.</p>

<p>"I'm in, Pa," he said. "They're sending me on to camp
tonight."</p>

<p>His chin was lifted. His pale eyes held the look, half
unbelief, of a long-penned dog turned loose from chain and
kennel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase had been home an hour when the telephone jangled its two
rings. Nat's voice came harsh from across the country. "Pa? Get
Will on the 'phone."</p>

<p>"He's gone, Nat. He enlisted."</p>

<p>"Christ, the damn fool. I knew he'd try it. I should have
called the minute the news broke. Sure it's too late to stop
him?"</p>

<p>"It's too late, Nat."</p>

<p>"God damn. Wait a minute, here's Ma."</p>

<p>His heart beat fast, hearing her, a bird singing over the
humming wires.</p>

<p>"Nellie--."</p>

<p>"I'm coming right home, Ase. Somebody'll wire you about my
train."</p>

<p>"Nellie--."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'll be waiting."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eric and Elsa had to laugh at him over the days. He wandered
in a daze like a bridegroom, they told him. He smiled,
unoffended. Elsa scrubbed the Linden house from top to bottom,
beat carpets and hung clean curtains.</p>

<p>"I'll only cook enough for the first meal," she said. "Mrs.
Linden will want to get to the kitchen herself. I know her."</p>

<p>It was true. Nellie returned like a small whirlwind. Within
twenty minutes she was out of Nat's satins and into gingham dress
and apron. There was little fault to be found with Elsa's work,
but with immense satisfaction she found mealy-bugs on one of her
dining-room begonias.</p>

<p>She said, "I don't know why I stayed so long. Nat's hard to
get away from. I won't be talked into it again."</p>

<p>She bustled about, examining cupboards and supplies,
rearranging furniture. Ase followed her from room to room. Once,
she turned so suddenly that she tripped over his feet, on her
heels behind her.</p>

<p>She said, "You don't have to dog me that close," but she
allowed him to hold her.</p>

<p>She was fretted about Willis, yet her concern was spotted with
Nat's anger.</p>

<p>"Nat said Will would never have been drafted, he could have
kept him out. He said he never thought Will would turn out a
traitor to him. Said he'd seen it coming, though,"</p>

<p>In his joy at her return, he would not take issue with her.
Later would be time enough to talk with her, if he could manage
the words and she would listen, of the nature of loyalty. She had
never yet listened when he fumbled at abstract discussion. Tim
McCarthy would have been his man to probe with him this matter.
He would bring it up with Eric, perhaps, although Eric's thinking
moved along more concrete lines.</p>

<p>He made a futile attempt with Nellie on one of the rare
afternoons when she sat quietly, rocking in the living-room. His
approach was unfortunate and she snapped him short.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear another word," she said. "You're going
to say something against Nat, and I won't have it. You've always
had it in for him and you just don't realize what a big man he's
turned out to be."</p>

<p>She quoted Nat constantly. He would not be hurt, seeing her
pleasure.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eric's Elsa died in December of pneumonia. Eric was stricken,
became suddenly an old man, crippled now not only of hands, but
of mind and spirit. He had waited so long for his love, and it
was taken from him untimely. Ase shared his grief.</p>

<p>He had not dared suggest to Nellie that young Elsa and her Jan
Rabaski move to the Linden farm, to live in the many-roomed
Linden home. Now she was the first to suggest that they move to
the cabin, Jan to replace Eric as hired hand, young Elsa to
replace her mother in casual help for Nellie.</p>

<p>The young couple moved into the old log cabin. Jan had offered
himself to the American Army and had been rejected, his lungs
still hard-tissued from their gassing. Young Elsa was already
happily pregnant. Nellie took a maternal interest in them, found
young Elsa of her own mind as to the importance of using enough
butter in various dishes. The Linden and Rabaski families lived
together in content.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In July of 1918 the rural telephone rang. There was a death
message, by wire, and since the telegram could not be delivered
and death messages were supposed to be delivered in person, would
the Lindens accept it?</p>

<p>Ase said, knowing the message, "Please read the telegram."</p>

<p>He listened to the reading of the telegram from the War
Department. He said, "Thank you."</p>

<p>Nellie was at his side.</p>

<p>She said, "Who's calling? Was it Nat?"</p>

<p>"No. It's Willis. He was killed at Ch&acirc;teau Thierry."</p>

<p>Even as he comforted Nellie, he felt an unreasonable
exaltation.</p>

<p>"He got away," he thought. "Willis got away."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c38">XXXVIII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Nat's exhibition at the time of 'Melie's wedding had satisfied
him. Twice he returned briefly and without ostentation, only then
because of business in a not too distant city. He preferred to
have his mother visit him each year. Ase insisted on paying her
fare, allowing Nat to do as he chose about decking her out in
made-to-order ruffles of an earlier era. He refused stubbornly to
go west with her. The trip would have to be in his own way and
time and that had never seemed to come.</p>

<p>'Melie came home alone several times in the years after her
marriage.</p>

<p>Nat, Arent and 'Melie arrived for a quiet celebration of Ase's
and Nellie's fiftieth wedding anniversary in February. It was
more and more apparent that Crockett was less 'Melie's consort
than the chief of Nat's cohorts. He had stayed behind to take
care of business. Nellie had not been feeling well and had
written Nat that she would wring his neck if he tried to make
another show of the anniversary. Nat had agreed, but on
appearing, suggested that the marriage ceremony be repeated.</p>

<p>He said, "You know, Ma, this is going to be in my newspapers,
and it would sound mighty cute."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "The very idea, I won't have it, rigging up an
old woman in her wedding duds. As if we were going to bed and
start all over again."</p>

<p>Nat roared with laughter.</p>

<p>He said, "Okay, Ma, any way you want it. I'll bet for Pa that
the spirit's willing but the flesh is weak."</p>

<p>For himself, Ase thought, another fifty years with Nellie
would be little enough. Yet the afternoon on a windy hill, when
sky and earth had reeled around them, should be put away in
camphor, like her wedding dress. It too had best be left
undisturbed.</p>

<p>Aunt Jess was dead and gone, along with Miss Minnie,
storekeeper Peyton and Dr. Holder. Only a score of friends and
relatives joined the Linden family for the anniversary
celebration. Nat's gift to his mother was a diamond brooch which
'Melie had selected with an eye to her own later use.</p>

<p>Nat took his father and mother aside that evening. In his
middle age he was florid and thickened. The perfection of his
grooming and tailoring gave a smooth covering to his coarseness.
He swelled out his chest, as he had long had a habit of doing,
before speaking. He clipped a cigar and lit it. Nellie pushed an
ashtray nearer him.</p>

<p>He said, "Now Pa, I've had enough of this nonsense about you
and Ma sticking it out on this damn farm. I know, you've done
mighty well, made a lot more money than most farmers. You've got
Will's insurance money. You're both still fairly tough, too. But
any day one of you'll be having a stroke, or breaking a leg from
trying to do too much at your age. You've got to expect to find
yourselves failing."</p>

<p>Ase frowned. More than ten years ago Nat had harped on their
age, when he and Nellie had been in the fullness of their
strength. It was as though Nat wanted them to be old, feeble and
incompetent.</p>

<p>He said, "Nat, your mother and I have talked this over. We're
satisfied here."</p>

<p>Nat flicked his cigar ash with his little finger.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Pa. You're so stubborn. There's something else
you probably won't understand, but take my word for it. We're
going to have one hell of a depression any time now. I'm all set
for it. I've been selling most of my stocks on the high market
and putting it where it's foolproof. Never mind where or how.
When it's over with, I'll own about half my state."</p>

<p>He puffed comfortably.</p>

<p>"Now listen. When the depression hits, your crops aren't going
to bring what it cost to raise them. You wouldn't like that,
would you?"</p>

<p>Ase said mildly, "It's happened before. A farmer never goes
hungry."</p>

<p>Nat sat up impatiently.</p>

<p>"My God, Pa, all you've ever been interested in, your whole
life, was just getting by, 'making a living,' you call it. On
land you don't even own."</p>

<p>The familiar expression irritated Ase. Over the years Nat and
Nellie had worn it thin.</p>

<p>Nat went on, "Of course, you haven't noticed how close the
Trent industries are coming. The newest plant's taken over the
land around Lancey Lake, not four miles away."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "We used to have the Pioneer Picnics there."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Ma. You used to have Pioneer Picnics. Now
you've got progress."</p>

<p>He leaned forward. His jaw tightened, his voice deepened. Ase
had a glimpse of the power that Nat must turn on at will, like a
water faucet.</p>

<p>"What we'll do here is plan for a factory, with workmen's
shacks built around it. Rent the shacks at a fairly high rate,
but not so high that you get an expensive turn-over in labor.
Give the dumb bozos free seeds for gardens, tie 'em up. Most of
the labor around here these days is foreigners, they'll damn near
work for nothing once they've got their own vegetable garden.
That's business psychology, Pa."</p>

<p>Ase said, "We were all foreigners here once. I don't know much
about psychology."</p>

<p>"Naturally not. I don't expect you to follow me all the way.
Now, this is just as important. The minute the depression begins,
everybody'll be in a panic, I'll step in and buy up the farms
between you and Lancey Lake for a song. When the up-swing begins
again, there'll be a big Linden industrial development here.
You'll be taken care of, Pa. You'll be in clover."</p>

<p>Ase watched Nat's cigar smoke drift through the room. It
seemed to him as ephemeral as Nat's sense of values.</p>

<p>He said, "People can put up factories and workmen's shacks
anywhere. The land all around here is too good for anything but
farming."</p>

<p>Nat stubbed out the butt of his cigar and spat.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "All right, Nat, how do you go about putting up a
factory on somebody else's property?"</p>

<p>Nat rose from his chair.</p>

<p>He shouted, "Who's paid the taxes all these years? Pa has! The
law takes care of that! I've been talking with men at the
courthouse. One word from your stupid husband, Mrs. Linden, and
it's all arranged."</p>

<p>Ase stood, tall and angry, towering over his son.</p>

<p>"This is my brother's land. You cannot use it for your
dishonest schemes."</p>

<p>Nat's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"Ma, anybody in the family ever been crazy besides Grandmother
Linden?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but your Pa."</p>

<p>She saw his stricken face.</p>

<p>"Ase, you never know when I'm teasing. We'll stay right here
and run the farm as long as we're able."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>She said, "Nat, I'm not going west with you. I know, I
promised, but your Pa needs me. Go finish your packing. You
always wait to the last minute so somebody else will get nervous
and do it for you."</p>

<p>Nat's shadows rose as he rose.</p>

<p>He said to his brother and sister, "Let's get going."</p>

<p>He turned to his father. He spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm through with this for a minute."</p>

<p>Nellie saw them off tearfully. Ase felt responsible and
guilty. Having supported him against Nat, now she snapped at
him.</p>

<p>"A fine thing, to call your own son dishonest. He only wants
to do the best thing for us."</p>

<p>He said, "You should have gone with him."</p>

<p>He was surprised at his own tartness. It occurred to him that
the increasing patience of age was as great a myth as the
unalloyed joy of youth. The longer he lived, the less tolerance
he had for the patently evil. And Nat--. He put his arms around
Nellie. Her plumpness was gone. Her fragility startled him. Her
passion having spent itself, he had not held her tight for
several years, for she had seldom ever permitted him to hold her
unless she desired him. She was so thin, so small.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm sorry. Maybe you're right, maybe Nat wants to do
the best thing for us."</p>

<p>She cried a while against his lean old breast, then pushed him
away with her lifelong gesture, her little hands rejecting a
monolith. She pulled his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped
her eyes and blew her nose. She sniffed the air. She darted to
door and windows and threw them wide. "That awful stink," she
said.</p>

<p>It was Nat's expensive cigar smoke to which she referred, but
he too welcomed the clean inrush of cold air, wiping out for the
moment a greater stench, his own along with it, for he had
compromised once again.</p>

<p>Nellie sniffled and said, "Ase, take me to see my folks. I
just can't get along without some family."</p>

<p>Her mother and father were long since dead, but two of her
brothers, with their wives and families, still lived prosperously
on the old Wilson farmstead two miles east along the road. He
hitched up the remaining horse, how many generations removed from
its ancestor, old Dan, he could not recall, and drove her in the
light buggy to her kin. He decided that he must buy an
automobile, after all. Nellie was sociable, she needed to meet
everywhere people in whom she had no concern, for whom she felt
no affection at all. This had always puzzled him, but he accepted
it as part of her.</p>

<p>On his return he went like a homing pigeon to the cabin, to
the Rabaski's. Young Elsa, he could only think of her so, and her
Jan had been prolific. There were six children from the ten years
of their union, four boys and two girls. His close friend among
these was the six-year-old, young Jan.</p>

<p>The boy ran to Ase as he knocked on the door of the cabin. "I
saw you coming," he said, and reached up to take his hand. "I
felt it in my stomach. Do you feel it in your stomach?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jan."</p>

<p>The child's phrase was as accurate as the Biblical yearning of
the bowels, he thought, for the warmth that surged through them
when they met. They went together into the cabin. Eric lifted his
head from his chimney corner. He was not as old as Ase, but the
life had gone out of him with his Elsa, and he hugged the hearth
like an ancient.</p>

<p>Young Elsa called from the kitchen, "Coffee and cake in a
minute, Mr. Linden. Glad to see you."</p>

<p>The elder three children were at school. The two toddlers
waved their toys cheerily at him. Eric's sadness was only a faint
shadow on this sunny threshold. The aroma from the kitchen was
delicious, a mixture of foreign seasonings and spices, for young
Elsa had added to her mother's Swedish dishes the Polish ones her
husband had described to her. Young Jan led Ase to a deep chair
opposite Eric by the hearth and settled himself in his lap.</p>

<p>He said, "I know you had to pay attention to your company. You
came home as soon as you could, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Ase said, "Yes, as soon as I could."</p>

<p>It was true. Because of this boy, as grave and frail as his
Dolly had been, as adoring of him, because of the miraculous
community between them, the old cabin was more nearly home than
his own. It was here he found meat for the teeth of his
spirit.</p>

<h2><a name="c39">XXXIX</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Seth Thomas clock whirred and struck three of the
afternoon. The notes hovered like birds in the comfortable warmth
of the living-room. The thin sunlight streamed through the bay
window and turned the pale green of Nellie's house fern to
silver. The fronds of the fern on its high stand touched the
floor. Ase thought it was almost like having a young willow tree
inside the house. A cricket, excited perhaps by the striking of
the clock, began chirping from somewhere under the fern. It had
escaped Nellie for weeks, but sooner or later she would take it
unaware and flip it out into the snow. Ase took her word for it
that crickets were as bad as moths for eating woolen clothing,
but a hole in a jacket elbow seemed to him a small price for the
cheerful piping in the long winter stillness.</p>

<p>The dog at his feet, sleeping in a patch of sunlight on the
carpet, roused and lifted his head. Nellie in the kitchen heard
the sound from the road and came hurrying. She pushed aside the
lace curtains at the front window and peered out. A strange Ford
passed, its wheel chains clanking on the frozen snow.</p>

<p>She said, "Pshaw now, I hoped it was going to stop."</p>

<p>Ase said, teasing her, "No matter who was in it?"</p>

<p>"Near about. Haven't laid eyes on a living soul for three
days. Seems as if the kids had been gone three months."</p>

<p>They had been for him three days of beauty and peace, the snow
as white as swan's feathers, the sky pale blue, the air sharp and
clean, the house cozy and silent, except for the cricket, the
clock, and Nellie's casual chatter. Much of the time he paid no
attention to the words, only listened with delight to the sound
of her voice, as he often listened to the brook purling under the
ice.</p>

<p>She said, "I thought maybe it was Joe Wilson and his wife,
going home. They'd have stopped in."</p>

<p>She returned to the kitchen and came back with a plate of
ginger cookies hot from the oven. He did not see how he might
manage even one, for she had made him finish the chocolate cake
at noon dinner. He made a pretense of pleasure and of hunger,
taking three of the cookies. He ate one, and while she was
hunting for the cricket under the sweeping fern fronds, he fed
the other two surreptitiously to the also overfed but greedy dog.
It seemed that she could never get out of the habit of cooking
for a large family. The doughnut and cooky crocks were always
full, varieties of cakes and pies accumulated in the pantry, a
few wedges cut out of each. Whatever friend or neighbor did stop
for a visit, went away loaded with baskets of pastries, of baked
beans, of salt-rising bread. When callers had been too long
absent, he had known her to look with disgust at an untouched
plate of jam tarts, sweep them into the swill pail for the hogs,
turn to and make a fresh batch of the identical tarts.</p>

<p>He wondered whether this was truly habit, or the expression of
her longing that her children would suddenly appear, to surround
the dining table, to eat and praise her bounty, saying, "Some
more, Ma," returning to her the sense of being loved, useful and
no longer lonely.</p>

<p>She was all he needed of companionship, except for the
inexplicable ache in his heart that he was never done with. Now
young Jan was easing it. He was forced to recognize that he alone
had never completed her life. There must always be the lover and
the beloved, and he had been the lover. Himself still yearning
for Tim McCarthy, for Doll, for Mink Fisher, for his brother
Benjamin, none, he thought, could know the nature of another's
need. Yet Nellie's seemed so plainly for her children, even for
any passer-by to serve her gay gregariousness.</p>

<p>He said, "Maybe Nat's right about our not staying here. Do you
want to leave the farm and move to town?"</p>

<p>She was sitting in the Boston rocker. She touched her foot to
the floor and set the chair in motion. She rocked and did not
answer.</p>

<p>He said, "Ben will turn up before we get too old. Then we'll
sell the farm and buy a little house in town for the three of
us."</p>

<p>"Ben had better hurry. You're seventy-one. How long do you
expect to live?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought much about it. I suppose forever."</p>

<p>"If you figure on being immortal, you'll have to do it without
me. Living one life's almost killed me."</p>

<p>He wondered if he could explain his sense of timelessness. He
did not think of it as another life, nor yet quite an immortality
of the same one. It was only, he felt, that individual lives
could no more be separated from life itself than drops of water
from the mass of ocean. He was willing to give to life the name
of "God," since men knew no other large enough with which to
speak of the ineffable, the Word made Life. He supposed men were
not yet fit or ready to be entrusted, desperately as they needed
it, with the secret of the Word. No, he could not explain.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, Nellie, if you won't go with me, I won't go
either."</p>

<p>She looked at him over her spectacles.</p>

<p>"I know you've always thought crazy, Ase, but talk sense when
you talk to me."</p>

<p>He had never talked anything but sense to her, he thought.
That was the trouble, the sense was insufficient.</p>

<p>"Has it been such a bad life for you, Nellie?"</p>

<p>The cricket chirped from under the far side of the fern and
she decided on a frond and lifted it. The cricket turned bright
eyes on her and waved its feelers. She pounced. She held it
triumphantly between two fingers.</p>

<p>"Got you, you little devil. Here, Ase, kill the thing or throw
it outdoors."</p>

<p>He took it from her, careful not to crush it. He went through
the kitchen to the woodshed. He released the cricket at the back
of the pile of stove wood.</p>

<p>He said to it and to himself, "You talked too much. Keep quiet
the rest of the winter so she won't find you again."</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him. He did have crazy thoughts, he
supposed, and it was surely not sensible to talk to a cricket,
even in his mind.</p>

<p>He reported to Nellie, "I took care of him."</p>

<p>"Good. I can't stand any kind of bugs in the house."</p>

<p>He thought she had forgotten both of his questions.</p>

<p>She said, "Ase, I don't know. It's been kind of a mixed up
life. You'll never know what I went through with your mother. And
we worked so hard and then found the place wasn't ever ours. And
Ben didn't play fair."</p>

<p>"Does it still hurt you, Nellie? Ben going away?"</p>

<p>She went to the kitchen and brought a pitcher of water for her
fern.</p>

<p>"Should have watered it yesterday," she said.</p>

<p>She replaced the pitcher on its shelf and returned with her
mending basket.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you want the truth, I've always missed him."</p>

<p>She began darning one of his socks.</p>

<p>She said, "I must say, Nat's made up for almost everything.
Can't see why you won't ever visit him with me. Why, Ase, people
fall all over him out there, you never saw anything like it.
You've hurt Nat's feelings."</p>

<p>She re-threaded her darning needle.</p>

<p>He studied her. Her soft curly hair was snow-white, with a
silver overtone. The wrinkles around her mouth and eyes were
laugh wrinkles. She was still pink and white and it seemed to him
that she had never been more beautiful.</p>

<p>She said, "Stop gawking at me."</p>

<p>"You're so pretty."</p>

<p>She used an expletive that shocked him.</p>

<p>She darned steadily. At last she finished and laid down her
mending.</p>

<p>She said, "About leaving. Maybe so. You can't sell, as long as
you're so stubborn about getting Ben declared dead and gone. Do
you suppose you could rent the farm? Think you could get enough,
with what we've saved, to rent a nice place in town?"</p>

<p>He was frightened that she might be serious. Yet if she was
unhappy here, chose actually to leave, he would do as she
wished.</p>

<p>He said, "I'll see the Rabaskis. I couldn't trust
everybody."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I know. Most folks'd ruin the land. Why don't you go over
right now?"</p>

<p>"You'll go with me?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I have to make a dried-apple pie for supper."</p>

<p>He groaned inwardly. She would eat one small piece and would
bully him to finish the rest. He had given up trying to dissuade
her from this extravagant cooking and baking. It was too deep a
satisfaction for her.</p>

<p>"How much rent had I better ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just let them name a figure, if they're interested. Then
we can make up our minds."</p>

<p>If he was obliged to leave the farm, he could leave it in no
hands except the Rabaskis'. Jan was in the cabin, and Eric and
young Elsa. The babies were sleeping. Young Jan had gone to play
with the cats in the barn.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I've come on business."</p>

<p>Eric roused from his lethargy.</p>

<p>He said, "You've got another tenant?"</p>

<p>Jan caught the old man's anxiety.</p>

<p>"Haven't I suited you, Mr. Linden?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I mean, yes, it's the other way around."</p>

<p>He was shocked to see their fear leap, like a flame ready to
devour their house. Their insecurity was greater than his own.
There was perhaps for them not ever any haven. Young Elsa dried
her hands on her apron and drew a chair close to the men by the
hearth. Her blue eyes were wide. He wanted to speak quickly, and
to the point, to ease them.</p>

<p>"It's this. My wife is restless. She's very lonely with the
family gone. My son thinks we're too old, he thinks we should
leave the farm and move to town. She hasn't made up her mind, but
we wondered if you would consider renting the farm?"</p>

<p>Jan and young Elsa looked at each other, then smiled.</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, Mr. Linden, you did scare us."</p>

<p>Jan said, "My lungs almost good now, but I thought sometimes,
when I have to cough, maybe you want stronger man."</p>

<p>"Jan, I couldn't ask for a better man."</p>

<p>He should have said it years ago.</p>

<p>Eric was watching him shrewdly. Jan drew a long breath and
reached for his pipe.</p>

<p>"So, is good then. I thank you. Now, the business. I say my
side."</p>

<p>He puffed on his pipe.</p>

<p>"If I rent farm, I have to hire other hand, just like you hire
me. Is so much cash there. So, then I pay rent, is so much cash
there. Maybe it cost more than crops pay. Excuse me, I think in
the out loud, is surprise idea."</p>

<p>Elsa cried out, "Oh Jan! We'd certainly break even. If it
would help Mr. Linden--."</p>

<p>Her eyes were clouded with tears. Jan rose and bowed gravely,
first to her and then to Ase. His dark face had paled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, I die of the shame. I am stranger, and you take
me in. You give me the life, you give me the bread for wife and
childs, you give me the roof for head, you give me the friend for
heart. I turn like wolf, give you the ungrateful. You must
forgive. Is only, all my life before, is cat eat dog, I think
selfish, I have fear. I am poor soldier after the all."</p>

<p>He bent to lay a fresh log on the hearth fire.</p>

<p>"My Elsa is the right," he said. "We do fine, rent your farm.
The rent, is what you say, what you need."</p>

<p>Eric spoke from his corner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, it isn't what you want at all, leaving the farm,
is it?"</p>

<p>His old friend's eyes were twinkling. He could only be
honest.</p>

<p>He said, "No, Eric, it isn't what I want at all."</p>

<p>"Then you go right home and tell Mrs. Linden nobody could
afford to rent the farm. Just tell her off."</p>

<p>Ase wanted to say, as he had longed to say to Dr. Holder in
the danger of Dolly's birth, "But Nellie is different."</p>

<p>He said, instead, "Jan, I don't think you would lose out by
renting. But it must be as Mrs. Linden wants."</p>

<p>Eric said, "No man who loves the land he works on wants to be
a tenant. I've told Jan and Elsa about your brother. I've had the
idea that some day, when you and I and your brother are gone,
they may be able to buy the farm. Your Nat and Arent, they won't
want it."</p>

<p>Ase had not carried his confused thoughts on death down so
practical a road. Death had shown him various of its veiled
faces. One had been a snow-swept stranger, riding away into the
night with Dolly. One had been a rescuer in armor, reaching down
to save Willis from his abyss. The death that had taken Mink, and
Tim, and the Old One, had neither stolen nor saved. They had
slipped easily into other elements where they were at home, in
bog, in earth, in summer wind. For himself, he would not know
until the moment came. But of course, the land would remain, to
be disposed of.</p>

<p>Eric said, "All Nat will want will be to turn it into cash.
You know that."</p>

<p>Yes, he knew. He knew as well that the value of the land as a
farm would not satisfy Nat. Once he himself was gone, nothing
would stop Nat's factory settlement schemes. The Rabaskis could
only move on then as tenants elsewhere. It seemed to him that he
should prepare them now. Yet meantime, no other landowner would
give them such advantageous terms, so good a house, so generous a
share of the breeding stock. He could not bring himself to speak
of Nat's greed.</p>

<p>Jan said comfortably, "Things work out okay. I know one thing,
Mr. Linden, we going have two fine farmers pretty soon, my Carl
and my Louey. Nine and eight years, they milk good already, love
help plant seed, everything. Hans, I don't know, he got that
mechanic Swede in him from his grandpa here."</p>

<p>Eric chuckled. He seemed like his old self today.</p>

<p>Jan said, "Young Jan, now, maybe you know what do with him
some day. I think sometimes maybe is going be crazy." He winked
at Elsa. "From the mama side. Or awful smart, from papa side. Mr.
Linden, you know that boy better I do, don't he seem kind of like
old man? He ask goddammest questions, things I never think
of."</p>

<p>Ase said, "He's smart, Jan. He asks me questions, too, I can't
answer."</p>

<p>Many of them, he thought, were ones he himself had asked of an
unanswering void.</p>

<p>Jan said, "Anyway, is good Rabaski kids, all. Carl, Louey,
Hans, learn good in school. Mr. Linden, don't you think I turn
out pretty good American? Got citizen paper, don't I learn talk
American like anybody?"</p>

<p>Ase put his hand to his mouth to cover his smile. Elsa burst
into laughter. Jan turned to her, his eyebrows lifted. She ran to
him and held his dark head against her breast.</p>

<p>"You talk wonderfully."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh like crazy, then. You understand okay when all I
can say was, 'love you, Elsa.' So what?"</p>

<p>"So--oh, Jan."</p>

<p>Eric and Ase stared into the fire, each with his memories of
love. The cabin door slammed open and young Jan ran in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden! I just saw your tracks in the snow."</p>

<p>The boy climbed into his bony lap, as always, as though he
merely claimed his own.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"A little while. I was talking business with your mother and
father."</p>

<p>"Do you have to go back right away?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The boy spoke passionately.</p>

<p>"Then tell me. Tell me some more. Tell me when Dolly was six
years old. Tell me when you were six years old, like me."</p>

<p>Young Jan was not at the moment the wise old man, he was all
child, delighting in tales, some of them oft told.</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>Elsa lifted a finger.</p>

<p>"Don't let him wear you out, Mr. Linden. I'll make coffee, for
when you're through."</p>

<p>Ase began, to the intent child, "I told you about Dolly and
the little pig. The one she dressed in the doll's clothes."</p>

<p>"Tell it again."</p>

<p>He repeated the story. Eric joined Elsa in the kitchen. Big
Jan left the cabin to see to the lambs. Ase was alone with the
boy. He had never told him of Mink Fisher. He told him now.</p>

<p>He said, "When I was six years old, I had an Indian for a
friend."</p>

<p>"A real Indian?"</p>

<p>"A real one."</p>

<p>He had told some of his tales of Mink Fisher to Dolly, but
there was a difference here, he was telling them now to a
man-child, and so he told of the hunts, the trapping, the
camping. He told young Jan, as he had told his Doll, of the
mythical trek across the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Young Jan said, "But you couldn't really walk across it, could
you?" and it was the question Doll had asked, and Ase was shaken,
and said, "No, only in your mind."</p>

<p>"Tell me more about Mink Fisher."</p>

<p>"Well, Jan, I was in trouble, and my brother was in trouble.
Mink Fisher found my brother and brought me word from him."</p>

<p>He found himself telling the story of so long ago, of Mink's
long search for Benjamin, of Mink's return with news, of Mink's
death. He became aware that the boy was trembling. So, Ase
thought in misery, he had been stupid again. Having found his
tongue, his words, he had alarmed the child.</p>

<p>The boy said passionately, "He was your friend. He came all
that way because he was your friend."</p>

<p>Ase thought, this was not to be believed, this young
understanding.</p>

<p>He said, "Yes. And he was my father, too. Not my real father,
but the one who taught me."</p>

<p>Elsa called, from the kitchen, "Coffee ready, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>He said, "No, I must go."</p>

<p>Young Jan clutched his legs.</p>

<p>He said, "Please don't leave me. You're my friend. You're my
father."</p>

<p>Elsa called out, "Now, Jan, let Mr. Linden go."</p>

<p>Ase trudged back to his house. Nellie had supper ready and
waiting, including the pie he must finish.</p>

<p>He said, "The Rabaskis don't think they can afford to rent the
farm."</p>

<p>She said placidly, "That's all right. I decided I couldn't
bear to have another woman's bread in my pantry, not even
Elsa's."</p>

<p>He realized that she had made her decision long before she had
sent him on his errand. He felt that a crisis had been safely
passed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c40">XL</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The late April day was balmy. Spring had come early this year
and the bees were frantic with the bounty of the apple blossoms.
The strong scent of Nellie's lilacs absorbed the cooler perfume
of the fruit bloom. The tulips bordering the front path opened
their gaudy cups, but the bees had little time for their meagre
honey.</p>

<p>Nellie sat on the edge of the bed to rest before Ase finished
helping her to dress. Since her stroke, she had been impatient
with any touch but his. Even Elsa annoyed her. Nellie had
recovered, but one hand was almost useless. Ase adjusted her lace
collar. She lifted her chin for him to fasten the collar with
Nat's diamond brooch. His big gnarled fingers took out a hairpin
and tucked back one of her wayward curls. He put an arm around
her and helped her to her feet. She clung to him as she balanced.
It was strangely sweet to him. She had never clutched him so, so
turned to him, calling eagerly, "Ase! Ase!", if he left her for a
moment in the hot days and nights of their youth. It was as
though the need of him that she had not felt in her passion,
filled her completely, now that all passion was gone.</p>

<p>He asked anxiously, "You're sure the drive won't be too much
for you?"</p>

<p>"Feel the best I have in a long time. I want to see those new
buildings in Peytonville."</p>

<p>He chose a coat from her cupboard, warmer than she might need,
since an April day could blow hot or cold at a moment's notice.
He took down a hat box from a shelf.</p>

<p>"Ase, don't make me wear a hat."</p>

<p>She had always worn one as seldom as possible, perhaps for
vanity in her hair. The only ones he could remember her wearing
had been actually not hats at all, but the hood attached to the
red cape of their early time together, and later, the blue
quilted bonnet he had given her. From both of these her curls had
stood out charmingly around her face, as she must have known. He
opened a dresser drawer and selected a pale blue gossamer wool
scarf from the large assortment. He wondered why people gave old
ladies almost nothing but scarves and handkerchiefs. Nellie liked
toilet water and candy and sherry wine. He arranged the scarf
over her head and tied the ends loosely under her chin. He pulled
out a few silver curls around her ears.</p>

<p>"Now it hides my brooch," she complained.</p>

<p>"If the day stays warm, you can take it off when we get into
town."</p>

<p>"Shall I come to the front door or the side door?"</p>

<p>He said sternly, "You sit right here until I drive the car
around and come back for you."</p>

<p>"You forgot my handkerchief."</p>

<p>He picked one of her best ones and sprinkled it with her
favorite cologne.</p>

<p>"Put some on me, too. Here, give me the bottle."</p>

<p>She took it in her good hand and doused herself liberally. He
reached for it and she gave the bottle a quick slap upward, so
that his sleeve was drenched with "an indefinable fragrance,"
according to the label. He tried to mop it off.</p>

<p>He said furiously, "Now how can I go into the bank smelling
like a confounded woman!"</p>

<p>She laughed like an imp.</p>

<p>"Ase, you should see your face."</p>

<p>How many years had it been that he had been falling into her
traps? Sixty years, and he was still her fool, her willing and
delighted fool. And for sixty years she had been saying, "You
should see your face."</p>

<p>He said, not entirely appeased, "If you don't care what people
say about your husband, it's perfectly all right."</p>

<p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"Never mind, anything you do is all right. It always has
been."</p>

<p>She said, suddenly sobered, "I know. Oh Ase, you've been a
good husband."</p>

<p>He marveled that it was necessary for him to reach the age of
eighty for her to say what she had never said before. Then he
knew that he could not have borne it earlier, as he could not
have borne this new dependence of hers in her illness. If these
things had been present with his young passion for her, he would
have exploded, would have perished from too much joy, and so have
been unable to nurse her now in her quite different need.</p>

<p>He said, "Don't move until I come."</p>

<p>Yet when he drove the automobile to the side of the house she
was waiting. She stood there, holding to the door so proudly,
that he could not scold her.</p>

<p>She said, "I couldn't wait. I'm not used to it. I've never
been an old woman before."</p>

<p>He lifted her in his arms and deposited her in the front seat
of the car. He set out for Peytonville, driving slowly and
carefully. He had bought his first car ten years ago, when she
had made the decision not to leave the farm. It had proved wise
and helpful, for he could deliver her to Peytonville shortly,
compared with the time of horse and buggy. She had been able to
visit her friends as often as she wished and had been more
contented. This was his second automobile, but he was never done
with the marvel of such transportation.</p>

<p>Neither had he ever gotten over a certain uneasiness as the
car started. It reminded him of the long-ago horse Prince, who
gave the same leap forward and was never to be counted on not to
bolt at once. His own absent-mindedness was something of a
menace. He could not safely sit hunched and abstracted with slack
reins, leaving the road to horse or team. The ditches were a
constant peril, especially when Nellie was not along to remind
him sharply. His slow speed was his protection. His long legs
were angled and cramped under the wheel, his bony elbows made
acute angles, so that pedestrians often smiled as he drove by.
Nellie said it was the first time an oversized daddy long-legs
had been seen driving an automobile. It had seemed to him that it
would have been easier to learn to fly an airplane. If a man was
going to leave his feet, the back of his horse, or the
earth-hugging wheels of buggy and of wagon, a plane somehow
seemed more logical an advance than the horseless carriage, which
was exactly that and no more.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now you're coming to the highway. Remember, the
car won't turn itself and there'll be other cars going like the
devil."</p>

<p>He had indeed not noticed that they were leaving the Linden
country road. He came to a full stop and watched to his left
while Nellie watched to the right. The traffic was heavy. Trent
had become an enormous industrial city. Peytonville had acquired
several prosperous minor industries with an expanded population
and now called itself "Peyton City." The younger residents and
the newcomers were outraged when the oldtimers persisted in
speaking of "Peytonville."</p>

<p>Nellie said, "All clear this way."</p>

<p>He accelerated and the car leaped like Prince into the middle
of the highway. He turned left toward what he and Nellie still
referred to as the village. He remembered the day so many years
ago when he had imagined himself following Ben to the west. He
recalled that even then he had wanted to ride the eagle. The
airplane was man's tame eagle. It was more, it was man's desire
for wings, no longer to be earthbound. He thought of the story of
Icarus in the encyclopedia. It had stirred him deeply, for he
felt himself in accord with this man's craving. He had acquired a
new encyclopedia, being unsatisfied by the old, and here he had
read in rapture of the Wright brothers, who had adapted the
principles of bird flight to human flight. Mechanical and clumsy
though it had proved to be, their principle seemed to him
important, but why, he could not tell.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Now go real slow, Ase. Are those the grain
elevators?"</p>

<p>"The two tallest are. The other is the new office
building."</p>

<p>"Look, Ase, you didn't tell me they've fixed over the Peyton
House. Like a city hotel, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The car crept along the altered streets. Main Street had been
widened. There were street lights and four traffic signals. Among
the new buildings an old shop here and there stood as always,
narrow and shabby. The notion store was fighting a losing battle
against a bright fronted five-and-ten. Doc Brown the druggist had
made concessions, enlarging his show windows and carrying a line
of goods in which he had little interest. His soda counter was
almost the same, and folk still came from miles around for his
homemade ice cream. He had taken over the small circulating
library, its contents the modern equivalent of "The Duchess," so
that Ase no longer troubled to study the titles. The town had no
other library.</p>

<p>Some years before, he had discovered the public library in
Trent. He went once a month for a book or two, being a slow
reader. When Nellie did not hurry him, he browsed among the open
stacks, looking into books whose titles seemed the keys he had so
long searched for. Too often a title was misleading. Some of the
books that provided the richest fare were hidden under
unrevealing names, like a rare soul behind a drab face. He had
begun to find his way past the magic gates, down a long corridor
and into the world he had dreamed of. Yet it was almost too late,
as for a man who, dying of starvation, cannot now digest the
banquet that earlier would have saved him.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "Nothing much changed through here."</p>

<p>The streets outside the business district were lined with elms
and maples. No one of the white-painted houses was newer than
fifty years. They varied from the neat little box of the Lilley
sisters, through modest homes unobtrusively Victorian, to an
occasional small mansion a hundred and fifty years of age, or
more, columned and serene. The yards were green with new grass.
Many of the housewives were working the flowers and shrubs in
their perennial beds and borders. Nellie waved to those of her
acquaintance. Ase stopped the car often for a particular friend
to speak with her, to ask details of her health, to urge her to
come in for a visit. It was her first trip since her illness, she
explained, and she had best not get out. She held her little
court along the way with gusto.</p>

<p>Ase drove into the outskirts where mediocre bungalows were
closely clustered, and on to the section of bleak flats where
shacks had been thrown up for the industrial workers. Nellie
wrinkled her nose in distaste. Ase circled by the new factories
and returned to Main Street. He had Doc Brown send out a
chocolate soda to her while he did his own business at the bank.
He had a sizeable deposit to make from the sale of early spring
lambs.</p>

<p>At the turn of the highway toward home, he asked, "Shall we go
on to Trent?"</p>

<p>"What do you want there? Just some more books? Another time,
Ase, I'm sort of giving out."</p>

<p>He looked at her anxiously. Her exhilaration had passed. Her
face was pale and pinched. There were blue circles under her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've let you overdo it today, Nellie."</p>

<p>He drove faster, concentrating on the rutted country road the
last few miles. He drew in by the side of the house. He opened
her car door and held out his arms to lift her down.</p>

<p>"Ase, I feel so faint--."</p>

<p>Her head in the blue gossamer scarf jerked backward. Her eyes
closed, opened, then rolled, unseeing. She collapsed on the seat.
He carried her, a limp rag doll, in the house and to their bed.
He felt for her pulse, but could not tell whether the beat was
hers or from his own heart. He stumbled to the wall telephone. He
could not remember the name of the young doctor in the village.
He rang.</p>

<p>He said to the operator, "Please send the doctor right away to
the Linden farm."</p>

<p>The precise voice said, "I beg your pardon. Number,
please."</p>

<p>He had forgotten the enlarged telephone exchange, and that the
elderly maiden lady operators who knew everyone, with whom
messages of any sort could be left, had long since been replaced
by younger, more efficient women.</p>

<p>He said desperately, "I want the new doctor in
Peytonville."</p>

<p>"I will give you Information."</p>

<p>The doctor was out when the call reached his office. Ase could
only ask that he be located and sent as soon as possible. He was
asked for explicit directions.</p>

<p>"But everyone knows where it is."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir. Dr. Manley would not know. Four miles out of town
on the Trent highway--a right turn onto a country road--four
miles--the first and only house on the left--. Thank you, sir.
You are positive this is an emergency? The doctor is very
busy--."</p>

<p>It seemed to Ase that it had taken no longer than this for Tim
McCarthy to hitch up, to drive horse and buggy to Peytonville,
that by now Dr. Holder would have been reining in sharply,
hurrying with his black bag. He went to Nellie. He must see her
again before he called across the road to Elsa. He leaned over
the bed. Nellie's eyes stared at the ceiling. He understood that
they would never close of themselves again. He dropped on the bed
beside her body. She had gone away without him. He had not been
there to brush back her curls, to stroke her forehead, to hold
her hand. He lay a long time, touching now and then her small
warmth, her throat, her breast, he knew he could not touch her
again when she was cold, for that would not be Nellie. He was
aroused toward evening by the sound of a car in the drive. He
heard voices. He went to the door. Elsa brought in the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, why didn't you call me? I didn't dream she was
sick again."</p>

<p>The doctor said, "Where is the patient?"</p>

<p>Ase stared at him.</p>

<p>He wanted to say, "I don't know."</p>

<p>Where was his little Nellie Wilson indeed? His sense of the
oneness, the timelessness, of God, of Man, of Life, had failed
him. Nellie did not seem to fit into the pattern. Her mischievous
vitality had no place in his theories or his philosophy. She
would reject the outer cosmic spaces, as she had rejected all
thought of immortality of body or of spirit, the one life, she
had said jestingly, having almost killed her. Yet surely she was
not lost entirely. Something of her would forever breathe with
the lilacs, would give delight to other lovers on other windy
springtime hills. Elsa poked the doctor with her elbow.</p>

<p>"He's very much upset," she whispered. "I've never seen a man
so crazy about his wife. Come with me."</p>

<p>The doctor returned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, your wife has been dead for hours. You are a
farmer, certainly you must know death when you see it."</p>

<p>Yes, Ase thought, he knew death when he saw it. He did not
answer. The doctor took out pad and pencil.</p>

<p>Elsa said, "I'll give you any information you need,
Doctor."</p>

<p>The afternoon alone with Nellie had been a rare blessing. He
would prefer to go now to the Linden cemetery and dig her grave
with his own hands. He would like to carry her there, just as she
was, in his arms, as he had carried Mink Fisher to his more
secret burial place. He would smooth the earth over her and plant
in silence living flowers from her garden, peonies and tulips.
Instead, there were unctuous strangers to be admitted, ceremonies
to be gone through with, Nat and the others to be sent for.</p>

<p>He had been prepared for the loss of Nellie when Doll was
born. He had looked then into the face of death, which, once seen
closely, may never again so shock and terrify. Death had sat by
his hearthside, waiting for Tim McCarthy, for his mother, for
Mink Fisher. Death, not he, had carried into his house the frozen
body of his Doll. He had long ago drunk too deeply of his cup of
anguish to be befuddled by it now.</p>

<p>He said, "Sit down, Doctor. I'll answer your questions. Her
name was Nellie Wilson Linden. Her age was seventy-nine--."</p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase stood under the yellowing poplars waiting for the rural
mail carrier. He thought of the early days when he must drive to
Peytonville on Saturday for mail and newspapers. It had been the
most satisfying day of the week, for there were always at least
the two weekly papers in his box. Visiting in the post office had
been pleasant, too, and the trading of Nellie's eggs and butter,
always more lively when she went with him. The rural free
delivery later had been a great convenience, of course. Now so
often the carrier passed by, calling out cheerily, "Nothing for
Linden today!" and then the disappointment was severe. Since
Nellie's death in the spring, the children wrote him only
occasionally.</p>

<p>The carrier was running late. Ase eased himself to the ground
and stretched out his long legs. The day was warm, for October,
but under the shade of the poplar trees he became conscious of
the chill of the earth. He got stiffly to his feet again and
moved closer to the road to stand in the sunshine. He looked out
over his fields and orchards. The farm crops had been abundant
this year, almost every one had been harvested profitably, but
the orchards were another matter. In his lifetime he had made
three plantings of the short-lived peach trees. The last
planting, set out by Jan Rabaski and his sons, would produce
perhaps ten more years, then be done for. The apple orchard was
nearly sixty years old. The trees were gnarled, the apples small
and unmarketable, except for making cider. He should have
replaced it years ago, but with an unreasonable tenacity, which
he now acknowledged to himself, he had thought of it as Ben's
orchard, to be preserved in its original state against his
brother's homecoming. He had been a stubborn man, he thought,
about the wrong things.</p>

<p>He listened to the familiar farm sounds. The breeding bull was
bellowing from his enclosure, the cows and heifers were answering
from their pasture. Big Jan and Carl and Louey were anxious to
enlarge the herd, for a sizeable dairy would be most profitable.
The sheep required much attention at lambing time, but they paid
well. Nellie had taken care of her money-making flocks of
chickens and turkeys until her first stroke a year or more ago,
when he had cut them down to the modest numbers that Elsa could
handle, along with her help in the Linden house.</p>

<p>The Rabaskis had thrived with him. They were cheerfully using
their savings to send Carl and Louey to the Agricultural College.
This had meant an automobile for the boys' use as well, so that
they might live at home and work mornings, evenings and week-ends
at the farming that would soon, they promised, be entirely
scientific. In another year Hans would be ready for the
mechanical courses. He was inclined to think that he would stay
on the farm, too. The acreage was large enough to warrant the use
of his talent for machinery. A big dairy herd would require
electrical milkers, an electric pump, and so on. The power
machines, the cultivators, reapers, binders, balers, sprayers,
the silo with electric hoist, that Ase had as yet not been talked
into by the Rabaskis, would take a full-time mechanic.</p>

<p>There would be no money left, Rabaski said, for college for
young Jan. At sixteen, the boy was frail, and a dreamer. He loved
the farm as passionately as the rest of them, kept up his end of
the chores, but was of little help, otherwise, and never would
be. He worked at odd hydraulic experiments in the running brook,
or sat beside it and wrote poetry. Nat was right in one respect,
Ase thought. He himself was of no help here, either.</p>

<p>He heard the mail carrier's car and moved hopefully to the
mail box. The carrier stopped.</p>

<p>"Plenty of mail today, Mr. Linden."</p>

<p>It was toward the end of the week, and there were half a dozen
assorted papers and magazines, and two letters.</p>

<p>Ase recognized Nat's engraved stationery as the carrier
remarked, "Know this will please you, hearing from the west."</p>

<p>Ase lifted his hand in thanks as the mail car drove on. He
walked slowly up the front walk and into the house. The constant
dull throbbing in his heart always became more acute when he
entered the house and Nellie was not there. Sometimes, when
absorbed, he forgot that she was dead. He found himself looking
for her, in kitchen, pantry or cellar. Then a cold blast rocked
him back on his heels as he remembered.</p>

<p>He sat down in the Boston rocker in the front room. He laid
the periodicals on the round table and opened Nat's letter.
Nellie would have rejoiced in its thickness. He himself had
always a vague dread when he heard from Nat. He put on his
spectacles and read.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Pa:</p>

<p>"I think you will agree that we have been patient with you
long enough. You are an old man and you cannot continue trying to
oversee the running of the farm. We went through all this after
Ma died. I hoped you'd have come to your senses in these six
months.</p>

<p>"For your protection as well as ours, I am going ahead with
the plans I outlined to you. My lawyers are now making the
preliminary arrangements. They have drawn up papers to have Uncle
Ben declared legally dead, having advertised for his whereabouts,
with no response. This should have been done years ago.</p>

<p>"You will be given title to the property. You will then convey
your title outright to the Linden Development Corporation, which
is made up of Arent, 'Melie, Crockett and me. This will save us a
sizeable inheritance tax, as the place has become more valuable
than you realize, because of its proximity to Trent. As I told
you in the spring, after Ma's funeral, your suggestion that the
Rabaskis be allowed to buy the land as mere farm land, 'when the
time came,' as you put it, could not be more ridiculous. All they
could offer was a modest down payment and a mortgage, where there
will be a small fortune in my ball-bearing factory, with the
surrounding settlement of workers' cottages on a rental basis.
Such rentals are infinitely more profitable than outright sales.
And now is the moment for such a project. Whether or not we are
drawn into this new European war, in case you have read anything
about it, the war will be a great money maker, even more so, I
must say, if we are fools enough to become involved.</p>

<p>"You said that you 'owed' a great deal to the Rabaskis. You
owe them nothing. They are foreign transients. You have always
been too generous with them. They will do just as well on some
other farm.</p>

<p>"Don't think for a minute that I am not considering your
welfare. We should prefer that you make your home with us, but if
you still insist on refusing, we shall arrange for a comfortable
boarding home in Peyton. This will probably suit you best, as you
seem never to have cared to venture beyond your township. I shall
of course provide you with a generous income.</p>

<p>"I am extremely busy, as I plan to run for Governor next year,
but I have taken the time to write you at such length in the hope
that you will understand the situation and will feel satisfied
with what I am doing. I have expressed myself as simply as
possible, but if there is anything you do not understand, ask me
questions. Your mind was definitely wandering when we came for
Ma's funeral. Dear Ma, I'll never get over missing her. Sometimes
I worry about you, remembering that Grandmother Linden was
crazy.</p>

<p>"I will have everything settled in a month or so. Give the
Rabaskis notice, and plan to leave the farm yourself by the end
of November.</p>

<p align="right">Your loving son,          </p>

<p align="right">Nat."     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Ase dropped the letter on the table as though to rid himself
of something obscene. He pulled out his handkerchief and wiped
his fingers. The anger that filled him was a long-dammed flood.
He began pacing the floor, stooped and trembling. His rage was so
great that he felt that if he had Nat there before him, he would
be strong enough to shake him until the teeth chattered in the
hard, complacent face.</p>

<p>He was obliged to sit down again. He mopped his forehead.
Nat's evil had come home to him to roost. He understood the
letter entirely too well. He was sickened by the implied insults.
"In case he had read anything about this new European war--."
This was the first day in months that he had not turned first to
the foreign news in his papers. He felt surely, but humbly, too,
conscious of his ignorance, that horror was abroad on the earth,
and had asked himself what any one man might do to stop it. He
could not be alone, or simple-minded, in considering war too
primitive an attempt to resolve the differences among men's
varying greeds, among their differences of mind and
philosophy.</p>

<p>He reached for one of his newspapers. He must try to answer
Nat, if Nat could ever be answered. He opened the newspaper on
his knees. The second letter in his mail dropped from between the
pages. He smiled. It was addressed in pencil in an illiterate
hand and was stamped from the west coast. This would be Joe
again, his hired man of years before, telling as usual a fabulous
tale of hard luck which would seem to call for a regiment of
troops and a thousand dollars to rescue Joe from his troubles,
and ending with a postscript asking for the "loan" of a five or
ten.</p>

<p>Ase opened the letter.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"A gentulman in my house, Mr. Benjamin Linden, has ask me to
write you to tell you he is very sick. He says will you please
come. He says you are his brother.</p>

<p align="right">Yours very truly,                </p>

<p align="right">Mrs. Athalia Brown."     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2><a name="c42">XLII</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The road that had been so long twisted seemed to him to run
plain and straight before him. He even felt no great need of
hurry. Benjamin would wait for him. There would of course be time
for thinking on the way, but some things had best be decided now.
He who had lived a formless life would make plans at last. He
could not gather all the loose and tangled threads together to
make a pattern, for the last one lay, as it had always lain, in
his brother's hands. The farm. In his need, Ben might already
have disposed of it, the Rabaskis might well, at this moment, be
shelterless.</p>

<p>In the years that he and Nellie had had the rural telephone,
"Nat's 'phone," Nellie called it, her life-saver for
communication, he had seldom used it. Only toward noon it
occurred to him that he need not drive to Peytonville to send a
telegram. He rang, with the sense that it was too easy for so
important a matter, and dictated the message to Athalia Brown,
"Am coming." Hanging up the receiver, he wondered why he had not
addressed the wire to Ben himself, knew then that his first words
to him must be in person. He heard sounds from the kitchen. That
would be Elsa, come to prepare his dinner. He was not ready for
her, neither for appetite nor giving her his news.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden?"</p>

<p>It was young Jan, calling from the doorway. The familiar
warmth came over him. It was this boy to whom he wished to
speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, Mother sent me with your dinner on a tray. She
sends her apologies, Greta seems to be coming down with the
measles and she didn't want to leave her. Is it all right?"</p>

<p>Ase said, "Come in, Jan. It's all right. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"We had our dinner early."</p>

<p>"Then sit down, Jan. I want to talk with you. I have had news
from my brother. He has sent for me."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, Mr. Linden. You never gave him up, did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I think when you feel about someone as you do about him, you
would know when he died. A radio wave would be interrupted, some
sort of static would tell you communication was broken."</p>

<p>"Even if the communication had always been one-way?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Of course, when it's two-way, the static must be
terrible. It would be like lightning."</p>

<p>"I hope it never happens to you, Jan."</p>

<p>"It will happen when I have to lose you."</p>

<p>The boy spoke simply, having made his declaration of love in
his childhood, so that it was natural now to reaffirm it so.</p>

<p>He added, "You mustn't let it happen any sooner than you have
to."</p>

<p>"I'm an old man, Jan."</p>

<p>"Has it seemed long?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Jan. It hasn't seemed any time at all."</p>

<p>"You'd never be any different yourself, Mr. Linden, but would
you do things differently if you had the chance again?"</p>

<p>"Very differently."</p>

<p>"I've always thought you wanted something you never had. It
would help to know in time, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Jan, have you decided what you want?"</p>

<p>"Not actually. I have to know more, to be sure."</p>

<p>The boy leaned toward him. He was pale. His mind and spirit
burned with an almost visible white flame. It seemed to Ase that
this accounted for his physical frailty. His tall, fine-boned
body had an insufficient margin of strength, as though it could
not support at once itself and that consuming candle-power.</p>

<p>"It has to be something in science. But abstract science, I'd
want to be a physicist, not an engineer. I won't know whether I
have a good enough mind for the kind of thing I mean until I go
farther and learn more. Father can't manage college for me, on
the heels of Carl and Louey and Hans, we had to get them through,
for the sake of the farm. I'm going to begin working my way. I
can't understand why I'm not tougher, there's nothing wrong with
me. If I give out, I'll have to go as far as I can with just
reading. The trouble is, I don't know the right books, even books
on abstract thinking. But I can find out."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I never knew the right books, either. In time. When
I began to find them, I couldn't quite understand. I suppose a
mind has to be used."</p>

<p>"It's a catalytic process."</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "I don't even know what that means."</p>

<p>The tall fair boy smiled, too.</p>

<p>"What you wanted to be was a philosopher," he said. "You are
one. It's all been locked up inside you. I'll explain catalysis
some day, when I'm sure I know what it is, myself."</p>

<p>"Now who is the old man? You were born old, Jan."</p>

<p>The understanding flashed between them.</p>

<p>Jan said shyly, "And the poetry keeps messing me up. Nobody
knows about it but you. I don't even know whether it's poetry or
only me, trying to put in words what I see and feel."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's all the same thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But what I mean, could anybody be a physicist and a
poet, too? I have to <i>know</i> more, one way or the other, or
even both ways."</p>

<p>Ase was certain now. Jan would set his goal in sight. Whatever
he became, scientist or poet, physician or professor, he would
bring to his life's work an integrity, a purity, a dedication,
that were the marks, Ase recognized belatedly, of great
souls.</p>

<p>He said, "I probably don't need to say this to you, Jan, but
it's taken me eighty years to know it. There is good and there is
evil, and every man has to throw his weight on one side or the
other."</p>

<p>He paused, embarrassed, astonished to find himself articulate
at last.</p>

<p>Jan said, "I've never thought of that."</p>

<p>"That's what is dangerous. We don't always recognize the
moments when we have to choose."</p>

<p>"But a good man would never choose the evil."</p>

<p>"No. He compromises, Jan. Or he does nothing. Sometimes he
only says nothing. He could have put up a small barrier, but he
leaves the way clear for the evil to move in."</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. It's a battle, and you can't be passive.
I think that would have been my tendency. I'll watch out for the
moments."</p>

<p>This much was done, then.</p>

<p>Ase said, "My brother is very ill. I must take the train
tomorrow, if I can take care of some business today."</p>

<p>"What can I do to help you?"</p>

<p>"If you'll drive me to Peytonville now, before the bank
closes. I'm not a reliable driver even when I have nothing on my
mind."</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, we've let your dinner get cold. Mother'll never
trust me again."</p>

<p>"Never mind. I'll have something later."</p>

<p>They drove with little talk. Their silences together were as
companionable as their speech. The bank was open. Judge Simmons'
lawyer-son was in his father's old office. Ase sent Jan to buy
his ticket, and then to wait for him.</p>

<p>Simmons listened carefully, without interruption, tapping his
pencil in his father's habit.</p>

<p>"I see. Yes, Mr. Linden, your wishes can be carried out very
simply. The only possible dispute might come over whether a
portion of the live stock could be considered as part of the farm
property, instead of your own, since your brother allowed you
only usage. It could certainly amount to too small a matter for
Nat to quibble over. Your provision for him is generous, in any
case, especially since, as you say, and as I know, he could buy
and sell all of Peyton City and never miss the money. You must be
very proud of him."</p>

<p>Simmons began to jot down notes.</p>

<p>"The sum of five thousand dollars outright to Nathaniel
Linden--it would be customary to say, 'my son, Nathaniel
Linden'--"</p>

<p>"Just the name will do."</p>

<p>"Said sum representing payment of debt to Nathaniel Linden for
education of Willis Linden, deceased--"</p>

<p>The five thousand dollars were from Willis' war insurance
policy, which he had made out to his father. Ase and Nellie had
never touched it, having in fact no need to. It was blood money,
Ase thought, he would prefer to have disposed of it otherwise,
but let it return to Nat, perhaps to shame him. It would at least
be a thrown sop to his greed, deterring him from fighting for all
possible.</p>

<p>"'To Jan Rabaski, senior, and/or his heirs and assigns, all
live stock on the Benjamin Linden farm, all farm machinery and
equipment'--(it might be a good idea, Mr. Linden, to say, 'bred'
as to the stock, and 'acquired' as to equipment) 'since
usage'--(I'll check the date)--'allowed me, Asahel Linden, of
such stock and equipment by owner, Benjamin Linden.' Mr. Linden,
this part of your arrangements would be much simpler if you wait
until after you have seen your brother. You will know then
whether he has already made some disposition of the farm."</p>

<p>Ase had himself wondered if he were being precipitous. There
were answers to be had from Ben that would resolve so many
puzzles. It was strange, he felt no hurry in reaching his
brother, but he felt a compulsion for himself.</p>

<p>He said, "I want to do what I can, now."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now we come to the provision for Jan Rabaski,
junior, not mentioned in your will. It is your intention to
establish a trust fund for him at once? To relinquish your total
cash holdings toward that purpose?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Linden, if you do this, you have nothing left for
yourself but the five thousand devised, on your death, to Nat.
You are of tough pioneer stock, sir, like my father, you may live
to be a hundred. Assuming that for one thing, and for another,
that the Linden farm may have passed to other hands, you must
retain enough to live on. You must protect yourself."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I am protecting myself for the first time in my
life."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, but it seems a risk. So, for this young
Rabaski, the trust fund, he is to have the income to use as he
chooses, until he is of legal age, twenty-one, when he is to have
the principal, to use again as he sees fit, for study, travel, I
believe that is what you mentioned? Are you sure of this?"</p>

<p>"I am sure. I must ask you another question. Could it be
claimed that I was of unsound mind in doing these things?"</p>

<p>Simmons laughed.</p>

<p>"Not in this township. Mr. Linden, you don't know how we
respect you."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Can we finish the business today? I must leave
tomorrow, to go to my brother."</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll have my stenographer type up your will, and
we can have it witnessed here. We'd better go to the bank, to
finish the matter of the trust fund for this exceptional, you
say, young man. Then you can go west in peace."</p>

<p>Ase drove back to the farm with his only true though
unbegotten son, their kinship not of the blood but of the spirit.
The physical continuity of the generations bore little or no
relation, he thought, to that kinship of mind that flashed its
inexplicable recognition, one beacon signaling another across the
darkness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The towns flashed by the train window, the farms and open
fields flashed by. If it were not for an occasional rocking on
the rails, for acceleration now, deceleration then, Ase thought
that it was like sitting in a magic vacuum, watching the earth
roll by. An eastbound train roared past on the next track, and
then his own westbound one seemed indeed stationary. The other
was gone with a final swish like the crack of a bull whip. The
landscape resumed its swift-moving panorama. Ase had the double
seats to himself and he stretched out his long legs
comfortably.</p>

<p>This was an astonishing way to cross the continent, in speed
and luxury. He had always thought of the crossing in terms, if
not actually of the covered wagons, at least of plodding
struggle. True, Benjamin had gone west by railroad those sixty
years ago, but Ase recalled the ancient, dingy, sooty trains out
of Peytonville, jerking and faltering, as though the effort to
reach the west would be too much for them, as it had once been
for many of the oxen, the men and women and children.</p>

<p>The train altered its rhythm over a bridge, and there was a
wide river beneath. Ase stared at the swirling waters, muddy with
the waste of topsoil. He had never seen a river, no body of water
larger than Pip Lake and the brook that ran gently under the
weeping willows, except in time of flood. Even in flood the brook
had been a puny thing, compared with this slow powerful stream
like a winding serpent. The river vanished, and he saw an expanse
of forest, quite different from his own small woods. Without
slowing, the train passed through the main street of a village.
The gates were lowered, a bell was ringing, and ragged children
waved at the side of an old watchman. Ase waved back to them.</p>

<p>It seemed the train would shear off the shabby house fronts.
The broken porches, the bare yards with a few dusty zinnias and
dahlias reached almost to the railroad tracks. He was astonished
by such poverty. The farms beyond the town were poor and eroded,
the buildings were shanties, the stock was haggard. Somehow he
had expected the land to be richer the farther west it went. Then
great dairy farms appeared, with enormous silos and sleek cows
with udders that must hold gallons for each milking. There were
long narrow truck farms, with the autumn vegetables laid out in
green and orange rows as handsome as Nellie's flower garden. The
train slowed but did not stop and there were grimy suburbs and
tall office and factory buildings visible across a waste of
billboards and dump heaps, and he understood that the prosperous
dairy and truck farms fed some large city. The train clacked
across a switch, passed rows of freight cars, then left all trace
of the city behind, and there were farms again.</p>

<p>The sun dropped toward its setting. He looked through the
opposite windows at the western glow, the orange of the squash
and pumpkins of the past miles. A man sitting across the aisle
caught his eye and spoke.</p>

<p>"Days getting shorter. Soon be dark."</p>

<p>Ase nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It gave him a warm feeling to be spoken to by a stranger. He
cleared his throat, trying to think of a further item of
conversation.</p>

<p>"They don't seem to have had much frost on the crops out here
yet," he said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know about that. Crops to me are just something
that ends up on the table, mighty high priced, too, in the city.
I expect you're a farmer."</p>

<p>Ase inclined his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. All my life."</p>

<p>The stranger did not reply. Something more in the way of
courtesy seemed to be called for. Ase noticed the man's small
leather case on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>He said, "I suppose you are a drummer, sir."</p>

<p>The man threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard that word since I was a kid. They call us
traveling salesmen now. We don't drum up trade any more, you
know. It's a favor when we sell you something you don't
want."</p>

<p>A call came through, "First call for dinner." The stranger
left.</p>

<p>Ase remembered that Nellie had told him of eating on the
diners on her trips to and from the West, but Elsa had packed a
shoebox full of food for him. If the train would ever stop at
some small place where he might hand over the box to such
children as he had seen at the railroad crossing, his conscience
would be clear, but the train went swiftly through such places,
and he was unwilling to waste the food, not for its value in
money, but because it stood for too many hours of men's labor. He
ignored the waiter's half-question at his side, "Diner, two cars
to the rear," and opened Elsa's box. There were fried chicken and
hard-boiled eggs, bread-and-butter and ham sandwiches, pickles
and apple tarts, all planned to be eaten neatly out of hand. He
spread the enclosed napkin over his knees and ate most of the
food absently.</p>

<p>The lights came on in the train. The world outside was shadow,
dark masses moving by, rising and falling with the terrain, as
though in the process of creation. Here and there distant windows
shone like eyes in the night. Once the train passed so close to a
small house that Ase looked in and met the eyes of the family
sitting at the supper table. He saw them stare with a
never-fading wonder at the long brightly lighted box on churning
wheels that passed so swiftly each night with its cargo of
strangers, hurtling to their unknown destinations. He wanted to
stop and go into their house and say, "I at least am not a
stranger."</p>

<p>The porter asked, "Do you wish your berth made up now,
sir?"</p>

<p>Ase looked up into a kind brown face. He was relieved.</p>

<p>He said, "I've never traveled before."</p>

<p>"I'd suggest, sir, you're such a tall gentleman, if you'll
undress in the men's room, I'll make your berth ready."</p>

<p>"I can't walk back in my night shirt, can I?"</p>

<p>The porter chuckled and Ase smiled with him.</p>

<p>"You can slip on your overcoat, sir, if you don't have a
robe."</p>

<p>He had a fine silk robe that Nat had sent him, that he had
never worn. The porter led the way with his bag to the dressing
room. It was difficult to undress and wash against the motion of
the train. He felt like a crane making its way through mud. When
he came out with his bag some time later, he was lost. Most of
the aisle was curtained off and he could not tell one berth from
another. A woman in a kimono and hair curlers brushed past him
and disappeared into one of the cubicles. The porter hurried to
him, speaking in a muted voice, not quite a whisper.</p>

<p>"Here you are, sir. See, you're No. 9, if you get up in the
night. I've left the upper berth closed to give you more
headroom. Here's your reading light, it goes on and off, so, and
here's your ventilator. You don't open the window when there's
air conditioning."</p>

<p>Ase lowered his own voice to match, understanding that others
in this odd intimacy might be already sleeping.</p>

<p>"Do people really lie down and sleep in these little
places?"</p>

<p>Of late years, Nellie had taken a compartment on her trips,
but aside from the difference in cost, he had not wanted to be
isolated from others on his first journey.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You'll find the berth real comfortable. Here's the
bell to call me. You be sure and ring it if you need anything.
Even if you just get anxious."</p>

<p>"I'm anxious now."</p>

<p>They smiled together in the dim light of the precipitous long
box. It was easy to speak with this dark quiet man.</p>

<p>"I'll put your shade up, sir, so you can see out. The moon
comes up right soon. It's nice to lie and watch the moonlight
while the land rides by. It us who's riding, but it seems the
other way."</p>

<p>"I noticed that, but I thought it was because it was new to
me."</p>

<p>"No, sir. You could ride the train a hundred years and you'd
always think it was the earth moving and not you."</p>

<p>Ase said, "I expect we're all moving all the time, all
together, only we don't know where or which way."</p>

<p>It seemed natural to be murmuring such things back and forth
with a brown man out of the encyclopedia. He had known it would
be this way, once he truly traveled.</p>

<p>He whispered, "Thank you for your courtesies."</p>

<p>He held out his hand to his new friend. The porter grasped it
with what seemed to Ase almost a hunger.</p>

<p>"Good night, sir. Sleep well."</p>

<p>Ase said, "Good night to you, too, sir."</p>

<p>He stretched out his legs as far as they would go in the
berth. There was still not room enough. There were four soft
pillows at his head and he piled these high, so that by resting
his shoulders against them, he found the extra inches for his
length. He reached up and switched off the small light. For a
moment he could see nothing at all out of the window, then again,
the obscure landscape rose and fell, rose and fell, in its
prehistoric convulsions. The moon had not yet risen, although he
sensed a vague lightening of the sky. He was moving west, the
moon would rise behind the train, he would probably not see it
directly. The berth was indeed comfortable.</p>

<p>He became aware of a brightness outside the small thick
window. The full moon was quieting the earth's upheaval, was
smoothing the fields, the pastures, the now dark farmhouses, the
small towns through which the train was passing with sad sweet
whistle blowing. He saw the moon itself. The railroad tracks must
have taken a turn, so to bring the moon into view. The steady
pound of the train was soothing. He fell deep asleep.</p>

<p>He had supposed that a change of trains at the big city meant
only a change of tired engines. He was confused to find that he
must leave the train that had been his home and go inside the
huge station, and then, two hours later, search out a new strange
train through a maze of gates. His bag had been taken away from
him and loaded with many others on a hand truck and it seemed
impossible that he should ever find it again. He was swept along
with the crowd hurrying from the train. He heard running
footsteps behind him. His brown friend spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I'll get you settled, sir, so you'll have no trouble. Just
let me have your ticket."</p>

<p>He was grateful for the strong hand on his elbow, guiding him
through the confusion. The ramps, the entrances and exits, were
endless. He could have wandered helplessly for hours, he thought,
unable to stop any one of the rushing humans for directions and
for information. They came out under a vast vaulted rotunda where
people milled back and forth like a disturbed ants' nest. A
loud-speaker was announcing trains almost unintelligibly. He
caught sight of the baggage truck ahead. His friend whistled and
truck attendant turned and waited. The two consulted, his friend
pointed back to Ase, showed his ticket, and the other, a brown
man, too, nodded. The friend returned.</p>

<p>"That man there, sir, will come for you when your train is
called. All you do is follow him."</p>

<p>"Then I won't be anxious any more."</p>

<p>The jest was warm and secret between them.</p>

<p>"Now if you'll just sit right here, sir. If you leave for
anything, come straight back to this seat. Here's your ticket,
and you'll have two hours exactly to wait. It won't seem long,
watching people the way I've noticed you watch them."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you, sir. Excuse me, I forgot, I
should have given you a tip, on the train."</p>

<p>He fumbled in his purse. The brown man held up his hand in
negation.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no sir. I couldn't take anything. It's been fine,
meeting you. I've got to get back."</p>

<p>Ase shook hands with a sense of loss. His friend began to run,
threading his way across the crowds like a brave chip fighting
its way upstream against a strong current. Ase saw him swallowed
up at last, returning to his unfinished work and the mystery of
his life. Ase sat down and stared around him.</p>

<p>The milling hordes were faceless. In among the distracted
ants, restless masses boiled aimlessly, like maggots. Here and
there a solitary figure stood inert a moment, perhaps lost, as he
himself would have been without his friend, then moved and was
absorbed by the human swarming. The light from the high dirty
windows had no vitality. There was no color here, only shades of
gray, a green coat or a red hat vanished as soon as seen, as in a
whirling spectrum. The vaulted space was filled with a roaring
cacophony of sound. Ase tried to separate its components.</p>

<p>Underground there was the puffing and chugging of the trains.
The joined murmur of voices in the station rose to the ceiling,
was trapped and could not escape, echoed downward to meet another
swell, again hopelessly rising. Under the mass-voice and above
the incoming trains and the outgoing, he identified an odd
muffled sibilance, and this was the shuffling of feet on the
marble flooring, back and forth, around and around, sluff, sluff,
sluff. Against the muted grays the black iron gates, entrances
eventually to the trains, opened and now closed, like the gates
to Hell. The loud-speaker boomed out over the coagulation of
sound. The words came clearer this time.</p>

<p>"Track seventeen. Track seventeen. All aboard for the Dixie
Special, going South, going South. Louisville, Memphis--."</p>

<p>The other place names ran together, so that Ase was glad he
was not obliged to recognize his destination among them.</p>

<p>"Track seventeen."</p>

<p>The loudspeaker was like the voice of God, calling to faceless
men to prepare for nameless places. A section of the rotating
antlike human beings resolved itself into a definitive line,
rushing blindly toward track seventeen. Ase took out his
handkerchief and mopped his face. This, he thought, was a sort of
Purgatory. All here were caught, if not quite between Heaven and
Hell, at least between going and coming, in the eternal lost and
homeless sojourn on the earth.</p>

<p>He became aware that a shabby woman had sat down next to him,
with a nursling and two older children. Her luggage consisted of
several pasteboard cartons. He wondered where she was going, and
why. The woman had a worn face, sad and sweet. His horror left
him as he saw her give the breast to her babe. He forgot the gray
shuffling mob. It was only necessary to acknowledge the
individual, courageous human, to leave the terror of the
mass.</p>

<p>The friend of his friend stood before him, saying, "Your train
is called, sir."</p>

<p>He had not realized that his two hours had passed.</p>

<p>He said, "Thank you."</p>

<p>The red-cap said, "Follow me through gate two, sir, I'll have
your bag on board."</p>

<p>Ase hurried along behind him. His ticket was checked at the
gate, he found himself in the new train, the brown man was
pushing his bag under the seat. Ase hesitated. This also kind man
was not truly his friend, as the other had been. He offered him a
five-dollar bill and was satisfied that he had done the proper
thing when the friend of his friend thanked him, bowing from the
waist.</p>

<p>He settled himself for the remaining days of his trip. He felt
now at home among the complications. He gave himself to a rapt
study of the country. He had known from his reading that it was
different in different places, but he could not believe his eyes
before the infinite variety. The plains with their miles of wheat
and corn astonished him. His fields, his and Ben's, would be lost
in their least corner. The prairies seemed somehow frightening.
There was no place where a man might stand upright above his
fields to view them, he would be dwarfed among the crops of his
own raising. Yet when he saw the mountains, he thought a man must
feel the smallest here, whether living on the peaks or in the
valleys.</p>

<p>The conception of the Continental Divide stirred him, to know
that from this torn and towering plateau all waters flowed one
way east into the Atlantic, the others west into the Pacific. He
was puzzled as well, for such a phenomenon should properly lie in
the very middle of a continent, instead of so far west. Then he
remembered from the encyclopedia that these mountains were
younger than the old hills of his home, had been spewed high from
the restless earth eras later, and he was dizzy for an instant,
picturing the continent tilting, as though the whole earth mass
were slowly rotating in and out of the vaster seas. He begrudged
his sleep at night, lay wakeful late, watching from his window,
rousing with the first light of dawn to drink in all the marvels,
having been so long athirst.</p>

<p>All was new yet all was familiar. All delighted him, yet was
alien. In the last hours across the thousands of miles of the
beautiful, the fabulous nation, he understood that he had been
watching so eagerly in the hope that he might recognize his home.
It was not here. Neither had he left it behind him.</p>

<p>The porter on this train was without the tacit understanding
of the first one, but was still his friend, a grizzled man who
must be almost as old as he. The Negro seated himself
opposite.</p>

<p>"Train running a little late, Mr. Linden. Anybody meeting
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Big town, Mr. Linden, know how to find your way, where you're
going?"</p>

<p>"I have the address."</p>

<p>Ase took out the penciled envelope from Mrs. Athalia Brown.
The porter looked at it, looked sharply again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Linden, this a rough neighborhood. Could be there's a
mistake. You better take a taxi and have the man wait, 'til you
make sure."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I'm sure."</p>

<p>The porter left to speak to other passengers. Ase had had his
bag packed for hours. He followed the crowd. The bridge train was
waiting. Its bell rang with a soft clang like an old fashioned
doorbell. It crossed a waterway as though it spun its own tracks
under it as it went, like a spider. It passed over a cantilever
bridge and on to its thin track again and tinkled into the
smaller terminal. From this, Ase walked out with his bag into a
strange, exciting world.</p>

<p>He took a deep satisfied breath after the days of closeness.
The air was implicit with the sea. It was a tangible air, strong
and moist and sharp as hard cider, so that he seemed to drink
rather than to breathe it. It was the winds of the end of one
world meeting the winds of another one beginning. If he had been
lifted by a pair of mighty fingers and deposited here like a man
jumped on a checkerboard, he would have known he had reached the
end of a land.</p>

<p>He shifted his bag to his other hand and walked on a wide
curving way on which he found himself, leading toward the west.
The time was nearly sunset, but when he came at last to an open
vista, and saw the sun, it was not a solid ball, but a series of
concentric rings like a spinning top. As he stared, it vanished
entirely. The Pacific fog was rolling in. Red beacon lights
appeared above the piers. In a moment they too were obscured by a
tumbling gray mass that must, he thought, resemble ocean
breakers. He heard a sound like the bellowing of a bull, another
answered, and another, and these, he knew, could only be the
foghorns. Thin high tootings of tugboats sounded in a panic, like
mice under the feet of the bulls.</p>

<p>He was aware of exotic odors, roasting coffee, spicy foreign
foods, and enveloping them all, the pungent, salty
fish-and-sea-weed-laden fragrance of the sea. And then the fog
was over him and around him. Ghost fingers brushed his face. The
thin grayness swirled and passed, was followed by endless phalanx
on phalanx of insubstantial substance, and he was lost in the
fog, standing alone at the outer rim of the world, and could not
see his way. Other sounds came to him, trolley bells ringing in a
staccato rhythm with the flatness of a cracked tea cup, auto
horns crying for mercy in the slowed traffic, feet running, and
nearby, a harsh dance music. He groped his way toward the music.
It came from a penny arcade a few yards away. He felt his way
through the open door and set down his bag and looked around. A
pockmarked man was picking his teeth behind a counter.</p>

<p>"What you want, Gran'pa?"</p>

<p>Ase said, "I'd appreciate it if you would get me a taxi. I'm a
stranger here."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Too bad."</p>

<p>The dingy place was filled with silence.</p>

<p>"Where you want to go to?"</p>

<p>Ase drew out the envelope.</p>

<p>"To this address."</p>

<p>"Yeah? What d'you know. No taxi ain't goin' to take you
nowhere tonight."</p>

<p>Ase said, "If you could direct me, I don't mind walking, but
it seems hard to see in the fog."</p>

<p>"No? Imagine that. Tell you what I'll do for you, Gran'pa,
just for a favor, send one o' my boys with you. Hey, Louie!"</p>

<p>A pale little man shuffled from the rear of the room. He
reminded Ase of Willis.</p>

<p>"Louie, this nice old gent'man with his nice bag is lost, and
I want you should accomp'ny him to where he's going. Get it?"</p>

<p>Louie said sullenly, "I get it. Come on, Gran'pa."</p>

<p>Ase stopped at the door and drew out the envelope again and
pointed.</p>

<p>He said, "You won't be able to read the address when we get
outside. Here, see--."</p>

<p>Louie glanced at the inscribed street and number.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "I know the place."</p>

<p>Ase followed him out into the fog.</p>

<p>"Is it far?"</p>

<p>"Couple o' blocks."</p>

<p>"You're very kind to do this for me. I hope you'll let me pay
you for your trouble."</p>

<p>Ase stumbled at the curb. He clutched at his guide.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I hold your arm? I'd feel safer."</p>

<p>The man stiffened under his touch.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I wouldn't want anything to happen now. I've come
all the way across the country to find my brother. I haven't seen
him for sixty years."</p>

<p>Louie snorted, "Jeez, a guy should live so long."</p>

<p>"I suppose it does seem a long time to a young man. I'm past
eighty now."</p>

<p>He realized that his affairs could be of no interest.</p>

<p>He asked courteously, "Have you always lived in the west?"</p>

<p>Louie grunted and seemed to hesitate at an intersection. He
set off at a faster pace along a street lined with tall narrow
houses. Even through the fog they showed poverty-stricken and
shabby. Louie stopped and pointed up a flight of steps. A pale
light illumined a sign, "Rooms 50&cent; a night."</p>

<p>"There you are."</p>

<p>He shook off Ase's arm and turned away abruptly. Ase fumbled
for his wallet.</p>

<p>"Wait, please, Louie, let me give you something, with my
thanks."</p>

<p>Louie snarled. "Put that thing away, Gran'pa, before I change
my mind. Get your ----ing brother and get the hell out of here
fast."</p>

<p>The man began to run as though in mortal peril. Ase started up
the steps, understanding now how great had been his own. Louie's
swift padding vanished in the fog-ridden night. The steps were
steep and broken and he groped his way to the front door. Through
a dirty etched glass panel he saw a corridor lit by a small
hanging electric bulb. He found a doorbell at the side and pulled
it. The sound clangored far back in what seemed an empty house. A
woman came from the rear, wiping her hands on a soiled apron. She
opened the door a crack.</p>

<p>"Full up tonight," she said, and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Ase beat on the panel. The woman continued down the corridor,
then turned and walked back quickly, opening the door wider. She
looked him up and down, saw his good overcoat and old, decent
bag.</p>

<p>"Say, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Asahel Linden. You wrote me. I came to my brother
Benjamin."</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>She shut and bolted the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Figured that's who you might be when I took a good look.
About gave you up. This way."</p>

<p>Ase followed her mechanically up dimly lighted stairs, up one
flight, two, three, and four. She took a key from her apron
pocket and opened a door. She felt for a wall switch and a
hanging bulb came on, wan under a fluted paper shade. An old man
lay on a sagging bed against the far wall.</p>

<p>Ase set down his bag.</p>

<p>The woman said, "He owes me for two weeks, but mind now, I'm
not the kind to let a man starve. I've fed him, what I had to
spare."</p>

<p>She eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>"He said you'd pay."</p>

<p>She brushed back her gray straggling hair.</p>

<p>"I hate to bring up the pay, but you don't know what I go
through, old men dying on me, still owing, and then others not
wanting the room if they hear about it. I've got my living to
make, not like a rich gentleman like you. You will pay, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll pay. Thank you."</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"Sorry I don't have no room for you tonight. Maybe down the
street a ways, if you'd care to give me something on account
before you go."</p>

<p>"I'll stay here."</p>

<p>The woman hesitated.</p>

<p>Ase said, "I won't slip away. Here."</p>

<p>He drew out his wallet and gave her some bills. The woman
sniffled.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I knew you was a gentleman. Please don't
think me hard--."</p>

<p>She went down the stairs. Ase closed the door. He went to the
side of the bed. How could this shrunken thing be Benjamin? This
man was so old, so very old, so peaked of features, unshaven and
unshorn, so small and desolate. Benjamin had been tall and lithe
and strong, with bright cat eyes and tawny hair, and laughing,
always laughing. Ase wondered if there had been some mistake and
this was not Benjamin after all.</p>

<p>The gaunt face turned to him. The unshaded light was pitiless
on the sick eyes.</p>

<p>A voice croaked, "Asahel?"</p>

<p>"Benjamin--"</p>

<p>He took the withered hand.</p>

<p>"I was afraid--you wouldn't come in time."</p>

<p>"Have you had a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No use. I'm finished."</p>

<p>The eyelids closed. They were parchment thin.</p>

<p>"The light hurts."</p>

<p>Ase turned it out. He sat on a straight chair close beside the
bed. The hand groped for him and he held it.</p>

<p>"Asahel, I've always missed you."</p>

<p>"I never knew. I've never been done missing you."</p>

<p>"I have to tell you things, Ase. You tell first. I'm so
tired."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Your family. You've done well?"</p>

<p>Ben's voice was now almost familiar.</p>

<p>He said, "No, Ben. I failed."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>He could tell it in the dark, one old face not having to see
the other.</p>

<p>He began, "One child was good. Her name was Dolly. She died
when she was six."</p>

<p>Ben said, "I remember. You wrote me. Mother killed her."</p>

<p>Ase withdrew his hand, because it was trembling.</p>

<p>"No, Ben, I never wrote you that."</p>

<p>"You didn't need to. I knew. I knew Mother better than you
did."</p>

<p>"Was she always mad?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>He could ask it, the unaskable, knowing the answer, he could
say it, the unsayable.</p>

<p>"She was evil, Ben, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"Always evil. Go on, Ase."</p>

<p>"There was another child, the youngest, a boy, Willis. He
would have been good if I had helped him. No, he was good, after
all. He died in the war in 1918."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"The oldest is Nathaniel. We call him Nat. He followed you to
Alaska. He tried to find you."</p>

<p>"I know. I dodged him. What's wrong with him?"</p>

<p>Ben spoke with the ancient authority of their youth
together.</p>

<p>"It's this. He's evil, too. I might have stopped him."</p>

<p>"How? When?"</p>

<p>Ase thought back in time. But of course, when Nat was only
six, and had despised Tim McCarthy's gift of a silver dollar
because it was not enough. He remembered with the old anguish the
matter of the gypsy boy in the bog, he remembered the revelations
of Willis, all of it swept over him, and as though his brother
were his confessor, he told it all. There was a long silence.</p>

<p>Ben said, "There were two others."</p>

<p>"Yes. Arent and 'Melie."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>Ase told. Of Arent's passive following of Nat, of 'Melie, so
like Amelia, not quite so evil, and certainly not mad at all.</p>

<p>Ben said, "Nellie?"</p>

<p>Ase said, "She died in the spring. Did you love her, Ben?"</p>

<p>The skeleton on the dirty bed chuckled.</p>

<p>"No more than a hundred others."</p>

<p>Ase was obliged to say, "She never got over loving you,
Ben."</p>

<p>"Nellie didn't love anybody, Ase."</p>

<p>He said, "It doesn't matter now. She was a good wife. I loved
her."</p>

<p>The silence came again.</p>

<p>"Anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A boy of sixteen."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>He told of Jan Rabaski. He told his plans for him.</p>

<p>"Good. He makes up for the others. You've done right, Ase.
You've done well."</p>

<p>The longed-for praise was sweet.</p>

<p>"That's all. What about you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I'm too tired, Ase."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ever come home, Ben? Why didn't you ever write
us?"</p>

<p>"I was ashamed. It was wrong to be, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was wrong."</p>

<p>"I guess--I was always looking--for something that wasn't
there. I thought I had to--find it first."</p>

<p>The voice from the ancient bones was a whisper.</p>

<p>"Lift me up. It's hard to breathe."</p>

<p>Ase fumbled in the darkness to help his brother.</p>

<p>"The light, Ase."</p>

<p>He turned it on. The shock was fresh. Ben was gone under the
glare, and in his place he saw again the stranger.</p>

<p>"Under the pillow, Ase. Hurry."</p>

<p>He groped, not knowing for what he was to search.</p>

<p>"The deed, Ase. The farm."</p>

<p>The folded paper was grimy, dark and stained with age.</p>

<p>"See. It's made over to you."</p>

<p>Ase put on his spectacles. The notarized date was of many
years before. The farm had been his own, almost since his
mother's death.</p>

<p>He said, "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I gambled it away, Ase, the minute I got it. A pal staked me
and I won it back. It frightened me. So I had it conveyed to you.
Before I could do the same thing over again."</p>

<p>Ase closed the paper.</p>

<p>"I should have sent you the deed then. Ase, I liked to have it
in my pocket. I liked to show it. I might have lice in my rags,
but I was a man of property. I was weak, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"No, you were strong."</p>

<p>"Only for an instant. But I couldn't let you be put off the
farm. You knew that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew."</p>

<p>So, he had been right about Ben, always. His decades of
fidelity had not here been wasted.</p>

<p>Ben said, "Did it make much difference, Ase, not knowing the
farm was yours?"</p>

<p>He could answer truly, as he had once answered Tim McCarthy,
as he had answered his wife and children, "It didn't make any
difference at all."</p>

<p>"Put the paper in your pocket. I have nothing else."</p>

<p>The paper was precious. Its simplicity made possible the last
step in his plans. He need do only as Ben had done. He would
convey the deed at once to Jan and Elsa Rabaski, would put it in
the mail, and not all Nat's tentacles could take it from them.
The Linden land was safe.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Ase?"</p>

<p>"Right here, Ben."</p>

<p>"Take me back home, Ase. Promise."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>The breathing seemed easier.</p>

<p>"Ase?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ben."</p>

<p>"The woman fed me."</p>

<p>"The woman?"</p>

<p>"Athalia Brown."</p>

<p>"I'll pay her."</p>

<p>"I knew her forty years ago. Wild--. Pretty--."</p>

<p>The sound was a chuckle. It was faint, as though it came from
far away, and in the instant it was gone, and there was not even
the breathing. For the last time Ben had gone away laughing in
his ragged coat.</p>

<p>Ase pulled a battered rocking chair to the one window, then
switched off the light. Sounds were muffled by the fog. The cable
cars, the boat whistles, the foghorns, were far away. The
grayness swept past the dusty window, not quite tangible, not
quite visible. He sat all night like a disembodied spirit,
keeping an appointed vigil. Toward morning, the fog lifted.
Sunlight touched the roof tops. Sparrows stirred. In the distance
he saw a glimmer of unfamiliar light and color. He knew that he
was seeing a fragment of the bay, the beginning of the sea. The
Pacific had halted Benjamin, as he had once prayed.</p>

<p>He stood up stiffly. He felt as emptied of life as the body on
the bed. He had come to the end of a long road. He was without
pain, now that Ben had left him past any finding. Nothing was
different, his brother was no more lost to him than he had ever
been. It came to him with a sharp knowledge that in his
loneliness he was not alone.</p>

<p>He thought, "Every man has lost his brother."</p>

<h2><a name="c44">XLIV</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Not the wings beat, but the motors. The plane was a great bird
with two hearts, palpable and pulsating. It ran across the runway
like a plover, like a plover lifted suddenly into the air. Ase
was conscious of the straining climb. Space was a heavy thing, it
pushed the weight of the universe on the metallic bird to hold it
down, the twin hearts throbbed against it. More than ever Ase
felt that men were not held to earth, and by it, but were crushed
there by an imponderable vastness. The tallest trees could grow
no taller, not that their roots chained them, or the force of
gravity, but because their strength was unequal to the greater
pressure. The earth had thrust up its mountains as high as
possible, and the mountains were collapsing not from below but
from above, as though the kind firm hand of a master pressed on a
dog and a great voice said quietly, "Down."</p>

<p>The plane leveled off. The twin hearts had won their battle,
the motored bird was in its element and there was now no sense of
motion at all. Ase had imagined that even enclosed in the belly
of the mechanical bird, he would be conscious of flight. He
wanted to feel the effort, the winds of the world streaming past
his face. The sense of height was compensation. He saw the earth
plainly as a battered planet. The skin was cracked and wrinkled,
gashed with canyons, torn and split by rivers. Mountains were
jumbles of sterile stone. Cities were already ruins, as though he
saw them a thousand years in the future, or in the past. Only the
farms and fields were beautiful. Green and red and golden and
violet squares and rectangles spoke of man's sole kindness to the
earth. Ase wished he had celestial seeds to scatter, to drift
down on the brown fresh-plowed acres, there to grow some rare
unearthly crop. He would tell young Jan of this fancy, and they
would smile together.</p>

<p>It had occurred to him to telephone the farm this morning. He
had talked with them, one by one. They pleased him with something
deeper than their gratitude. They would cherish the land and not
despoil it. Young Jan was grave before his trust. This, too,
would never be betrayed.</p>

<p>The boy said at last, "We miss you. We are waiting for you. We
are your family now."</p>

<p>He was welcome. He had given away the very roof over his head,
and for the first time in his life, he was wanted under it. He
was warmed, who had so long been cold.</p>

<p>The boy had said, "You'll need to rest," and he had answered
"I've had a taste of travel, Jan. Perhaps I'll just keep on
going."</p>

<p>He folded his bony hands over the box that held his brother's
ashes. He should have made his flight, he thought, the other way
around. There was no need for hurry now, returning whence he had
come. Had he flown west, they would have had long days to talk
together. And of what more would they have spoken? It had all
been said. For a lifetime they had carried the words and the love
within them, had shared all they ever could have shared, a
continent apart.</p>

<p>He, too, he recognized, had sought to find the unfindable. He
had lost and sought a brother, and it was in the faces of all men
he should have peered. He had been homeless, and knew that for
such men as he there was no home, only an endless journey. He had
sought to know the unknowable. He and his whole race, great,
slow, groping, God-touched children, would have to wait a long
time, he supposed, for that, learning one lesson a millennium,
sometimes forgetting it and having to begin all over. He himself,
he thought humbly, had learned far too little. He had done much
harm. He had known good from evil, and he had sat miserable and
mute when the fight was called for. He had carried his standards
into battle perhaps not quite too late. He could not know whether
his good had been greater than his evil. No man could balance the
delicate scales, for he himself weighted one end and could not
reach across to weight the other. An invisible hand would add or
subtract. An unheard voice would speak the answer.</p>

<p>Ase was recalled to the immediacy of the plane. A flock of
south-bound geese slanted past him. The plane had suddenly lifted
its nose. It climbed so steeply that the earth ball seemed
visibly to roll toward the east. The sky was torn by the plane,
the clouds were tattered, they fell away in streamers, massed
again in a billowing sea and hid the world below.</p>

<p>A group of strangers, boxed together, was rocketing toward the
sun, the stars. Most of them were frightened. Ase felt a surge of
joy. It was of the purity of his boyhood, when with Mink Fisher
he had imagined himself walking barefoot across the Milky Way.
The consciousness of flight was so powerful that he lifted his
hands from his safety belt and held them stretched before him,
like an angel on the wing.</p>

<p>A stewardess balanced herself against the acute angle and
leaned over him.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, astonished.</p>

<p>"We climb for another half an hour, then level off. After
that, the flight is normal."</p>

<p>She turned across the aisle to speak to a white-faced
woman.</p>

<p>But this, he thought, was normal. Some hunger, some obscure
instinct, was assuaged by this swift reaching into space. His
excitement mounted with the plane. He longed to have the half
hour last for half a millennium, to keep on and on, higher and
higher, farther and farther, to the core of the cosmos. He
recalled his years of watching after the bird migrations.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he thought, this was what afflicted men. The battered
planet he had seen under him could not last forever. Something in
man was surely eternal, if only his awareness of eternity.
Perhaps, he thought, perhaps--. Man might be migratory, too. In
his blood and bones there might stir the same blind avian impulse
toward unknown places. Since man could not soar alone, he had
evolved these miraculous instruments of flight, making ready for
an ultimate home, aeons and aeons hence.</p>

<p>Ase felt a constriction of his heart. There was a spasm that
was more of pressure than of pain. The pressure increased. He
could endure only a little more of it. He would not cry out to
alarm his fellow passengers. He clenched his hands. He looked
from his window. The land was reeling away from him. The fields
were indistinguishable. He wished he might recognize a winter
wheat field. After all, the earth was pain to leave. To know it
was to love it. Perhaps those distant migrants of his imagining
would feel a nameless nostalgia, would think wordlessly, as he
thought now, "Dear earth, place once of my abiding."</p>

<p>The pressure was a flood. He was not afraid.</p>

<p>It had been so brief a sojourn, not even a full century. He
had been a guest in a mansion and he was not ungrateful. He was
at once exhausted and refreshed. His stay was ended. Now he must
gather up the shabby impedimenta of his mind and body and be on
his way again.</p>
