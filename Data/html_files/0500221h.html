  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">I. &mdash; A STRANGE MEETING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was early in March, 1969, that I set out from my bleak
  camp on the desolate shore some fifty miles southeast of Herschel Island
  after polar bear. I had come into the Arctic the year before to enjoy the
  first real vacation that I had ever had. The definite close of the Great War,
  in April two years before, had left an exhausted world at peace&mdash;a
  condition that had never before existed and with which we did not know how to
  cope.</p>

  <p>I think that we all felt lost without war&mdash;I know that I did; but I
  managed to keep pretty busy with the changes that peace brought to my bureau,
  the Bureau of Communications, readjusting its activities to the necessities
  of world trade uninfluenced by war. During my entire official life I had had
  to combine the two&mdash;communications for war and communications for
  commerce, so the adjustment was really not a Herculean task. It took a little
  time, that was all, and after it was a fairly well accomplished fact I asked
  for an indefinite leave, which was granted.</p>

  <p>My companions of the hunt were three Eskimos, the youngest of whom, a boy
  of nineteen, had never before seen a white man, so absolutely had the last
  twenty years of the Great War annihilated the meager trade that had formerly
  been carried on between their scattered settlements and the more favored
  lands of so-called civilization.</p>

  <p>But this is not a story of my thrilling experiences in the rediscovery of
  the Arctic regions. It is, rather, merely in way of explanation as to how I
  came to meet him again after a lapse of some two years.</p>

  <p>We had ventured some little distance from shore when I, who was in the
  lead, sighted a bear far ahead. I had scaled a hummock of rough and jagged
  ice when I made the discovery and, motioning to my companion to follow me, I
  slid and stumbled to the comparatively level stretch of a broad floe beyond,
  across which I ran toward another icy barrier that shut off my view of the
  bear. As I reached it I turned to look back for my companions, but they were
  not yet in sight. As a matter of fact I never saw them again.</p>

  <p>The whole mass of ice was in movement, grinding and cracking; but I was so
  accustomed to this that I gave the matter little heed until I had reached the
  summit of the second ridge, from which I had another view of the bear which I
  could see was moving directly toward me, though still at a considerable
  distance. Then I looked back again for my fellows. They were no where in
  sight, but I saw something else that filled me with consternation&mdash;the
  floe had split directly at the first hummock and I was now separated from the
  mainland by an ever widening lane of icy water. What became of the three
  Eskimos I never knew, unless the floe parted directly beneath their feet and
  engulfed them. It scarcely seems credible to me, even with my limited
  experience in the Arctics, but if it was not that which snatched them forever
  from my sight, what was it?</p>

  <p>I now turned my attention once more to the bear. He had evidently seen me
  and assumed that I was prey for he was coming straight toward me at a rather
  rapid gait. The ominous cracking and groaning of the ice increased, and to my
  dismay I saw that it was rapidly breaking up all about me and as far as I
  could see in all directions great floes and little floes were rising and
  falling as upon the bosom of a long, rolling swell.</p>

  <p>Presently a lane of water opened between the bear and me, but the great
  fellow never paused. Slipping into the water he swam the gap and clambered
  out upon the huge floe upon which I tossed. He was over two hundred yards
  away, but I covered his left shoulder with the top of my sight and fired. I
  hit him and he let out an awful roar and came for me on a run. Just as I was
  about to fire again the floe split once more directly in front of him and he
  went into the water clear out of sight for a moment.</p>

  <p>When he reappeared I fired again and missed. Then he started to crawl out
  on my diminished floe once more. Again I fired. This time I broke his
  shoulder, yet still he managed to clamber onto my floe and advance toward me.
  I thought that he would never die until he had reached me and wreaked his
  vengeance upon me, for though I pumped bullet after bullet into him he
  continued to advance, though at last he barely dragged himself forward,
  growling and grimacing horribly. He wasn't ten feet from me when once more my
  floe split directly between me and the bear and at the foot of the ridge upon
  which I stood, which now turned completely over, precipitating me into the
  water a few feet from the great, growling beast. I turned and tried to
  scramble back onto the floe from which I had been thrown, but its sides were
  far too precipitous and there was no other that I could possibly reach,
  except that upon which the bear lay grimacing at me. I had clung to my rifle
  and without more ado I struck out for a side of the floe a few yards from the
  spot where the beast lay apparently waiting for me.</p>

  <p>He never moved while I scrambled up on it, except to turn his head so that
  he was always glaring at me. He did not come toward me and I determined not
  to fire at him again until he did, for I had discovered that my bullets
  seemed only to infuriate him. The art of big game hunting had been
  practically dead for years as only rifles and ammunition for the killing of
  men had been manufactured. Being in the government service I had found no
  difficulty in obtaining a permit to bear arms for hunting purposes, but the
  government owned all the firearms and when they came to issue me what I
  required, there was nothing to be had but the ordinary service rifle as
  perfected at the time of the close of the Great War, in 1967. It was a great
  man-killer, but it was not heavy enough for big game.</p>

  <p>The water lanes about us were now opening up at an appalling rate, and
  there was a decided movement of the ice toward the open sea, and there I was
  alone, soaked to the skin, in a temperature around zero, bobbing about in the
  Arctic Ocean marooned on a half acre of ice, with a wounded and infuriated
  polar bear, which appeared to me at this close range to be about the size of
  the First Presbyterian church at home.</p>

  <p>I don't know how long it was after that that I lost consciousness. When I
  opened my eyes again I found myself in a nice, white iron cot in the sick bay
  of a cruiser of the newly formed International Peace Fleet which patrolled
  and policed the world. A hospital steward and a medical officer were standing
  at one side of my cot looking down at me, while at the foot was a fine
  looking man in the uniform of an admiral. I recognized him at once.</p>

  <p>"Ah," I said, in what could have been little more than a whisper, "you
  have come to tell me the story of Julian 9th. You promised, you know, and I
  shall hold you to it."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You have a good memory. When you are out of this I'll keep my
  promise."</p>

  <p>I lapsed immediately into unconsciousness again, they told me afterward,
  but the next morning I awoke refreshed and except for having been slightly
  frosted about the nose and cheeks, none the worse for my experience. That
  evening I was seated in the admiral's cabin, a Scotch highball, the principal
  ingredients of which were made in Kansas, at my elbow, and the admiral
  opposite me.</p>

  <p>"It was certainly a fortuitous circumstance for me that you chanced to be
  cruising about over the Arctic just when you were," I had remarked. "Captain
  Drake tells me that when the lookout sighted me the bear was crawling toward
  me; but that when you finally dropped low enough to land a man on the floe
  the beast was dead less than a foot from me. It was a close shave, and I am
  mighty thankful to you and to the cause, whatever it may have been, that
  brought you to the spot."</p>

  <p>"That is the first thing that I must speak to you about," he replied. "I
  was searching for you. Washington knew, of course, about where you expected
  to camp, for you had explained your plans quite in detail to your secretary
  before you left, and so when the President wanted you I was dispatched
  immediately to find you. In fact, I requested the assignment when I received
  instructions to dispatch a ship in search of you. In the first place I wished
  to renew our acquaintance and also to cruise to this part of the world, where
  I had never before chanced to be."</p>

  <p>"The President wanted me!" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Secretary of Commerce White died on the fifteenth and the President
  desires that you accept the portfolio."</p>

  <p>"Interesting, indeed," I replied; "but not half so interesting as the
  story of Julian 9th, I am sure."</p>

  <p>He laughed good naturedly. "Very well," he exclaimed; "here goes!"</p>

  <p>Let me preface this story, as I did the other that I told you on board the
  liner Harding two years ago, with the urgent request that you attempt to keep
  constantly in mind the theory that there is no such thing as time&mdash;that
  there is no past and no future&mdash;that there is only now, there never has
  been anything but now and there never will be anything but now. It is a
  theory analogous to that which stipulates that there is no such thing as
  space. There may be those who think that they understand it, but I am not one
  of them. I simply know what I know&mdash;I do not try to account for it. As
  easily as I recall events in this incarnation do I recall events in previous
  incarnations; but, far more remarkable, similarly do I recall, or should I
  say foresee? events in incarnations of the future. No, I do not foresee
  them&mdash;I have lived them.</p>

  <p>I have told you of the attempt made to reach Mars in the Barsoom and of
  how it was thwarted by Lieutenant Commander Orthis. That was in the year
  2026. You will recall that Orthis, through hatred and jealousy of Julian 5th,
  wrecked the engines of the Barsoom, necessitating a landing upon the moon,
  and of how the ship was drawn into the mouth of a great lunar crater and
  through the crust of our satellite to the world within.</p>

  <p>After being captured by the Va-gas, human quadrupeds of the moon's
  interior, Julian 5th escaped with Nah-ee-lah, Princess of Laythe, daughter of
  a race of lunar mortals similar to ourselves, while Orthis made friends of
  the Kalkars, or Thinkers, another lunar human race. Orthis taught the
  Kalkars, who were enemies of the people of Laythe, to manufacture gunpowder,
  shells and cannon, and with these attacked and destroyed Laythe.</p>

  <p>Julian 5th and Nah-ee-lah, the moon maid, escaped from the burning city
  and later were picked up by the Barsoom which had been repaired by Norton, a
  young ensign, who with two other officers had remained aboard. Ten years
  after they had landed upon the inner surface of the moon Julian 5th and his
  companions brought the Barsoom to dock safely at the city of Washington,
  leaving Lieutenant-Commander Orthis in the moon.</p>

  <p>Julian 5th and the Princess Nah-ee-lah were married and in that same year,
  2036, a son was born to them and was called Julian 6th. He was the
  great-grandfather of Julian 9th for whose story you have asked me, and in
  whom I lived again in the twenty-second century.</p>

  <p>For some reason no further attempts were made to reach Mars, with whom we
  had been in radio communication for years. Possibly it was due to the rise of
  a religious cult which preached against all forms of scientific progress and
  which by political pressure was able to mold and influence several successive
  weak administrations of a notoriously weak party that had had its origin
  nearly a century before in a group of peace-at-any-price men.</p>

  <p>It was they who advocated the total disarmament of the world, which would
  have meant disbanding the International Peace Fleet forces, the scrapping of
  all arms and ammunition, and the destruction of the few munition plants
  operated by the governments of the United States and Great Britain, who now
  jointly ruled the world. It was England's king who saved us from the full
  disaster of this mad policy, though the weaklings of this country aided and
  abetted by the weaklings of Great Britain succeeded in cutting the peace
  fleet in two, one half of it being turned over to the merchant marine, in
  reducing the number of munition factories and in scrapping half the armament
  of the world.</p>

  <p>And then in the year 2050 the blow fell. Lieutenant-Commander Orthis,
  after twenty-four years upon the moon, returned to earth with one hundred
  thousand Kalkars and a thousand Va-gas. In a thousand great ships they came
  bearing arms and ammunition and strange, new engines of destruction fashioned
  by the brilliant mind of the arch villain of the universe.</p>

  <p>No one but Orthis could have done it. No one but Orthis would have done
  it. It had been he who had perfected the engines that had made the Barsoom
  possible. After he had become the dominant force among the Kalkars of the
  moon he had aroused their imaginations with tales of the great, rich world
  lying ready and unarmed within easy striking distance of them. It had been an
  easy thing to enlist their labor in the building of the ships and the
  manufacture of the countless accessories necessary to the successful
  accomplishment of the great adventure.</p>

  <p>The moon furnished all the needed materials, the Kalkars furnished the
  labor and Orthis the knowledge, the brains and the leadership. Ten years had
  been devoted to the spreading of his propaganda and the winning over of the
  Thinkers, and then fourteen years were required to build and outfit the
  fleet.</p>

  <p>Five days before they arrived astronomers detected the fleet as minute
  specks upon the eyepieces of their telescopes. There was much speculation,
  but it was Julian 5th alone who guessed the truth. He warned the governments
  at London and Washington, but though he was then in command of the
  International Peace Fleet his appeals were treated with levity and ridicule.
  He knew Orthis and so he knew that it was easily within the man's ability to
  construct a fleet, and he also knew that only for one purpose would Orthis
  return to Earth with so great a number of ships. It meant war, and the earth
  had nothing but a handful of cruisers wherewith to defend herself&mdash;there
  were not available in the world twenty-five thousand organized fighting men,
  nor equipment for more than half again that number.</p>

  <p>The inevitable occurred. Orthis seized London and Washington
  simultaneously. His well armed forces met with practically no resistance.
  There could be no resistance for there was nothing wherewith to resist. It
  was a criminal offense to possess firearms. Even edged weapons with blades
  over six inches long were barred by law. Military training, except for the
  chosen few of the International Peace Fleet, had been banned for years. And
  against this pitiable state of disarmament and unpreparedness was brought a
  force of a hundred thousand well armed, seasoned warriors with engines of
  destruction that were unknown to earth men. A description of one alone will
  suffice to explain the utter hopelessness of the cause of the earth men.</p>

  <p>This instrument, of which the invaders brought but one, was mounted upon
  the deck of their flag ship and operated by Orthis in person. It was an
  invention of his own which no Kalkar understood or could operate. Briefly, it
  was a device for the generation of radio activity at any desired vibratory
  rate and for the directing of the resultant emanations upon any given object
  within its effective range. We do not know what Orthis called it, but the
  earth men of that day knew it was an electronic rifle.</p>

  <p>It was quite evidently a recent invention and, therefore, in some respects
  crude, but be that as it may its effects were sufficiently deadly to permit
  Orthis to practically wipe out the entire International Peace Fleet in less
  than thirty days as rapidly as the various ships came within range of the
  electronic rifle. To the layman the visual effects induced by this weird
  weapon were appalling and nerve shattering. A mighty cruiser vibrant with
  life and power might fly majestically to engage the flagship of the Kalkars,
  when as by magic every aluminum part of the cruiser would vanish as mist
  before the sun, and as nearly ninety per cent of a peace fleet cruiser,
  including the hull, was constructed of aluminum, the result may be
  imagined&mdash;one moment there was a great ship forging through the air, her
  flags and pennants flying in the wind, her band playing, her officers and men
  at their quarters; the next a mass of engines, polished wood, cordage, flags
  and human beings hurtling earthward to extinction.</p>

  <p>It was Julian 5th who discovered the secret of this deadly weapon and that
  it accomplished its destruction by projecting upon the ships of the Peace
  Fleet the vibratory rate of radio-activity identical with that of aluminum,
  with the result that, thus excited, the electrons of the attacked substance
  increased their own vibratory rate to a point that they became dissipated
  again into their elemental and invisible state&mdash;in other words aluminum
  was transmuted into something else that was as invisible and intangible as
  ether. Perhaps it was ether.</p>

  <p>Assured of the correctness of his theory, Julian 5th withdrew in his own
  flagship to a remote part of the world, taking with him the few remaining
  cruisers of the fleet. Orthis searched for them for months, but it was not
  until the close of the year 2050 that the two fleets met again and for the
  last time. Julian 5th had, by this time, perfected the plan for which he had
  gone into hiding, and he now faced the Kalkar fleet and his old enemy,
  Orthis, with some assurance of success. His flagship moved at the head of the
  short column that contained the remaining hope of a world and Julian 5th
  stood upon her deck beside a small and innocent looking box mounted upon a
  stout tripod.</p>

  <p>Orthis moved to meet him&mdash;he would destroy the ships one by one as he
  approached them. He gloated at the easy victory that lay before him. He
  directed the electronic rifle at the flagship of his enemy and touched a
  button. Suddenly his brows knitted. What was this? He examined the rifle. He
  held a piece of aluminum before its muzzle and saw the metal disappear. The
  mechanism was operating, but the ships of the enemy did not disappear. Then
  he guessed the truth, for his own ship was now but a short distance from that
  of Julian 5th and he could see that the hull of the latter was entirely
  coated with a grayish substance that he sensed at once for what it
  was&mdash;an insulating material that rendered the aluminum parts of the
  enemy's fleet immune from the invisible fire of his rifle.</p>

  <p>Orthis's scowl changed to a grim smile. He turned two dials upon a control
  box connected with the weapon and again pressed the button. Instantly the
  bronze propellers of the earth man's flagship vanished in thin air together
  with numerous fittings and parts above decks. Similarly went the exposed
  bronze parts of the balance of the International Peace Fleet, leaving a
  squadron of drifting derelicts at the mercy of the foe.</p>

  <p>Julian 5th's flagship was at that time but a few fathoms from that of
  Orthis. The two men could plainly see each other's features. Orthis's
  expression was savage and gloating, that of Julian 5th sober and
  dignified.</p>

  <p>"You thought to beat me, then!" jeered Orthis. "God, but I have waited and
  labored and sweated for this day. I have wrecked a world to best you, Julian
  5th. To best you and to kill you, but to let you know first that I am going
  to kill you&mdash;to kill you in such a way as man was never before killed,
  as no other brain than mine could conceive of killing. You insulated your
  aluminum parts thinking thus to thwart me, but you did not know&mdash;your
  feeble intellect could not know&mdash;that as easily as I destroyed aluminum
  I can, by the simplest of adjustments, attune this weapon to destroy any one
  of a hundred different substances and among them human flesh or human
  bone.</p>

  <p>"That is what I am going to do now, Julian 5th. First I am going to
  dissipate the bony structure of your frame. It will be done
  painlessly&mdash;it may not even result in instant death, and I am hoping
  that it will not. For I want you to know the power of a real
  intellect&mdash;the intellect from which you stole the fruits of its efforts
  for a lifetime; but not again, Julian 5th, for today you die&mdash;first your
  bones, then your flesh, and after you, your men and after them your spawn,
  the son that the woman I loved bore you; but she&mdash;she shall belong to
  me! Take that memory to hell with you!" and he turned toward the dials beside
  his lethal weapon.</p>

  <p>But Julian 5th placed a hand upon the little box resting upon the strong
  tripod before him, and he, it was, who touched a button before Orthis had
  touched his. Instantly the electronic rifle vanished beneath the very eyes of
  Orthis and at the same time the two ships touched and Julian 5th had leaped
  the rail to the enemy deck and was running toward his arch enemy.</p>

  <p>Orthis stood gazing, horrified, at the spot where the greatest invention
  of his giant intellect had stood but an instant before, and then he looked up
  at Julian 5th approaching him and cried out horribly.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he screamed. "Always all our lives you have robbed me of the
  fruits of my efforts. Somehow you have stolen the secret of this, my greatest
  invention, and now you have destroyed it. May God in Heaven&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried Julian 5th, "and I am going to destroy you, unless you
  surrender to me with all your force."</p>

  <p>"Never!" almost screamed the man, who seemed veritably demented, so
  hideous was his rage. "Never! This is the end, Julian 5th, for both of us,"
  and even as he uttered the last word he threw a lever mounted upon a control
  board before him. There was a terrific explosion and both ships, bursting
  into flame, plunged meteor-like into the ocean beneath.</p>

  <p>Thus went Julian 5th and Orthis to their deaths, carrying with them the
  secret of the terrible destructive force that the latter had brought with him
  from the moon; but the earth was already undone. It lay helpless before its
  conquerors. What the outcome might have been had Orthis lived can only remain
  conjecture. Possibly he would have brought order out of the chaos he had
  created and instituted a reign of reason. Earth men would at least have had
  the advantage of his wonderful intellect and his power to rule the ignorant
  Kalkars that he had transported from the moon.</p>

  <p>There might even have been some hope had the earth men banded together
  against the common enemy, but this they did not do. Elements which had been
  discontented with this or that phase of government joined issues with the
  invaders. The lazy, the inefficient, the defective, who ever place the blame
  for their failures upon the shoulders of the successful, swarmed to the
  banners of the Kalkars, in whom they sensed kindred souls.</p>

  <p>Political factions, labor and capital saw, or thought they saw, an
  opportunity for advantage to themselves in one way or another that was
  inimical to the interests of the others. The Kalkar fleets returned to the
  moon for more Kalkars until it was estimated that seven millions of them were
  being transported to earth each year.</p>

  <p>Julian 6th, with Nah-ee-lah, his mother, lived, as did Or-tis, the son of
  Orthis and a Kalkar woman, but my story is not to be of them, but of Julian
  9th, who was born just a century after the birth of Julian 5th.</p>

  <p>Julian 9th will tell his own story.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">II. &mdash; SOOR, THE TAX COLLECTOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WAS born in the Teivos of Chicago on January 1st, 2100, to
  Julian 8th and Elizabeth James. My father and mother were not married as
  marriages had long since become illegal. I was called Julian 9th. My parents
  were of the rapidly diminishing intellectual class and could both read and
  write. This learning they imparted to me, although it was very useless
  learning&mdash;it was their religion. Printing was a lost art and the last of
  the public libraries had been destroyed almost a hundred years before I
  reached maturity, so there was little or nothing to read, while to have a
  book in one's possession was to brand one as one of the hated intellectuals,
  arousing the scorn and derision of the Kalkar rabble and the suspicion and
  persecution of the lunar authorities who ruled.</p>

  <p>The first twenty years of my life were uneventful. As a boy I played among
  the crumbling ruins of what must once have been a magnificent city. Pillaged,
  looted and burned half a hundred times Chicago still reared the skeletons of
  some mighty edifices above the ashes of her former greatness. As a youth I
  regretted the departed romance of the long gone days of my fore-fathers when
  the earth men still retained sufficient strength to battle for existence. I
  deplored the quiet stagnation of my own time with only an occasional murder
  to break the monotony of our bleak existence. Even the Kalkar Guard stationed
  on the shore of the great lake seldom harassed us, unless there came an
  urgent call from higher authorities for an additional tax collection, for we
  fed them well and they had the pick of our women and young
  girls&mdash;almost, but not quite as you shall see.</p>

  <p>The commander of the guard had been stationed here for years and we
  considered ourselves very fortunate in that he was too lazy and indolent to
  be cruel or oppressive. His tax collectors were always with us on market
  days; but they did not exact so much that we had nothing left for ourselves
  as refugees from Milwaukee told us was the case there.</p>

  <p>I recall one poor devil from Milwaukee who staggered into our market place
  of a Saturday. He was nothing more than a bag of bones and he told us that
  fully ten thousand people had died of starvation the preceding month in his
  Teivos. The word Teivos is applied impartially to a district and to the
  administrative body that maladministers its affairs. No one knows what the
  word really means, though my mother has told me that her grandfather said
  that it came from another world, the moon, like Kash Guard, which also means
  nothing in particular&mdash;one soldier is a Kash Guard, ten thousand
  soldiers are a Kash Guard. If a man comes with a piece of paper upon which
  something is written that you are not supposed to be able to read and kills
  your grandmother or carries off your sister you say: "The Kash Guard did
  it."</p>

  <p>That was one of the many inconsistencies of our form of government that
  aroused my indignation even in youth&mdash;I refer to the fact that the
  Twenty-Four issued written proclamations and commands to a people it did not
  allow to learn to read and write, I said, I believe, that printing was a lost
  art. This is not quite true except as it refers to the mass of the people,
  for the Twenty-Four still maintained a printing department, where it issued
  money and manifestos. The money was used in lieu of taxation&mdash;that is
  when we had been so over-burdened by taxation that murmurings were heard even
  among the Kalkar class the authorities would send agents among us to buy our
  wares, paying us with money that had no value and which we could not use
  except to kindle our fires.</p>

  <p>Taxes could not be paid in money as the Twenty-Four would only accept gold
  and silver, or produce and manufactures, and as all the gold and silver had
  disappeared from circulation while my father was in his teens we had to pay
  with what we raised or manufactured.</p>

  <p>Three Saturdays a month the tax collectors were in the market places
  appraising our wares and on the last Saturday they collected one per cent of
  all we had bought or sold during the month. Nothing had any fixed
  value&mdash;today you might haggle half an hour in trading a pint of beans
  for a goat skin and next week if you wanted beans the chances were more than
  excellent that you would have to give four or five goat skins for a pint, and
  the tax collectors took advantage of that&mdash;they appraised on the basis
  of the highest market values for the month.</p>

  <p>My father had a few long haired goats&mdash;they were called Montana
  goats, but he said they really were Angoras, and mother used to make cloth
  from their fleece. With the cloth, the milk and the flesh from our goats we
  lived very well, having also a small vegetable garden beside our house; but
  there were some necessities that we must purchase in the market place. It was
  against the law to barter in private, as the tax collectors would then have
  known nothing about a man's income. Well, one winter my mother was ill and we
  were in sore need of coal to heat the room in which she lay, so father went
  to the commander of the Kash Guard and asked permission to purchase some coal
  before market day. A soldier was sent with him to Hoffmeyer, the agent of the
  Kalkar, Pthav, who had the coal concession for our district&mdash;the Kalkars
  have everything&mdash;and when Hoffmeyer discovered how badly we needed coal
  he said that for five milk goats father could have half his weight in
  coal.</p>

  <p>My father protested, but it was of no avail and as he knew how badly my
  mother needed heat he took the five goats to Hoffmeyer and brought back the
  coal. On the following market day he paid one goat for a sack of beans equal
  to his weight and when the tax collector came for his tithe he said to
  father: "You paid five goats for half your weight in beans, and as everyone
  knows that beans are worth twenty times as much as coal, the coal you bought
  must be worth one hundred goats by now, and as beans are worth twenty times
  as much as coal and you have twice as much beans as coal your beans are now
  worth two hundred goats, which makes your trades for this month amount to
  three hundred goats. Bring me, therefore, three of your best goats."</p>

  <p>He was a new tax collector&mdash;the old one would not have done such a
  thing; but it was about that time that everything began to change. Father
  said he would not have thought that things could be much worse; but he found
  out differently later. The change commenced in 2017, right after Jarth became
  Jemadar of the United Teivos of America. Of course, it did not all happen at
  once. Washington is a long way from Chicago and there is no continuous
  railroad between them. The Twenty-Four keeps up a few disconnected lines; but
  it is hard to operate them as there are no longer any trained mechanics to
  maintain them. It never takes less than a week to travel from Washington to
  Gary, the western terminus.</p>

  <p>Father said that most of the railways were destroyed during the wars after
  the Kalkars overran the country and that as workmen were then permitted to
  labor only four hours a day, when they felt like it, and even then most of
  them were busy making new laws so much of the time that they had no chance to
  work, there was not enough labor to operate or maintain the roads that were
  left, but that was not the worst of it. Practically all the men who
  understood the technical details of operation and maintenance, of engineering
  and mechanics belonged to the more intelligent class of earthmen and were,
  consequently, immediately thrown out of employment and later killed.</p>

  <p>For seventy-five years there had been no new locomotives built and but few
  repairs made on those in existence. The Twenty-Four had sought to delay the
  inevitable by operating a few trains only for their own
  requirements&mdash;for government officials and troops; but it could now be
  but a question of a short time before railroad operation must
  cease&mdash;forever. It didn't mean much to me as I had never ridden on a
  train&mdash;never even seen one, in fact, other than the rusted remnants,
  twisted and tortured by fire, that lay scattered about various localities of
  our city; but father and mother considered it a calamity&mdash;the passing of
  the last link between the old civilization and the new barbarism.</p>

  <p>Airships, automobiles, steamships, and even the telephone had gone before
  their time; but they had heard their fathers tell of these and other wonders.
  The telegraph was still in operation, though the service was poor and there
  were only a few lines between Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard. To the west
  of us was neither railroad nor telegraph. I saw a man when I was about ten
  years old who had come on horseback from a Teivos in Missouri. He started out
  with forty others to get in touch with the east and learn what had transpired
  there in the past fifty years; but between bandits and Kash Guards all had
  been killed but himself during the long and adventurous journey.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget how I hung about picking up every scrap of the
  exciting narrative that fell from his lips nor how my imagination worked
  overtime for many weeks thereafter as I tried to picture myself the hero of
  similar adventures in the mysterious and unknown west. He told us that
  conditions were pretty bad in all the country he had passed through; but that
  in the agricultural districts living was easier because the Kash Guard came
  less often and the people could gain a fair living from the land. He thought
  our conditions were worse than those in Missouri and he would not remain,
  preferring to face the dangers of the return trip rather than live so
  comparatively close to the seat of the Twenty-Four.</p>

  <p>Father was very angry when he came home from market after the new tax
  collector had levied a tax of three goats on him. Mother was up again and the
  cold snap had departed leaving the mildness of spring in the late March air.
  The ice had gone off the river on the banks of which we lived and I was
  already looking forward to my first swim of the year. The goat skins were
  drawn back from the windows of our little home and the fresh, sun-laden air
  was blowing through our three rooms.</p>

  <p>"Bad times are coming, Elizabeth," said father, after he had told her of
  the injustice. "They have been bad enough in the past; but now that the swine
  have put the king of swine in as Jemadar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"S-s-sh!" cautioned my mother, nodding her head toward the open
  window.</p>

  <p>Father remained silent, listening. We heard footsteps passing around the
  house toward the front and a moment later the form of a man darkened the
  door. Father breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "it is only our good brother Johansen. Come in,
  Brother Peter and tell us the news."</p>

  <p>"And there is news enough," exclaimed the visitor. "The old commandant has
  been replaced by a new one, a fellow by the name of Or-tis&mdash;one of
  Jarth's cronies. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>Brother Peter was standing between father and mother with his back toward
  the latter, so he did not see mother place her finger quickly to her lips in
  a sign to father to guard his speech. I saw a slight frown cross my father's
  brow, as though he resented my mother's warning; but when he spoke his words
  were such as those of our class have learned through suffering are the
  safest.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to think," he said, "or to question in any way what the
  Twenty-Four does."</p>

  <p>"Nor for me," spoke Johansen quickly; "but among friends&mdash;a man
  cannot help but think and sometimes it is good to speak your
  mind&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>Father shrugged his shoulders and turned away. I could see that he was
  boiling over with a desire to unburden himself of some of his loathing for
  the degraded beasts that Fate had placed in power nearly a century before.
  His childhood had still been close enough to the glorious past of his
  country's proudest days to have been impressed through the tales of his
  elders with a poignant realization of all that had been lost and of how it
  had been lost. This he and mother had tried to impart to me as others of the
  dying intellectuals attempted to nurse the spark of a waning culture in the
  breasts of their offspring against that always hoped for, yet seemingly
  hopeless, day when the world should start to emerge from the slough of slime
  and ignorance into which the cruelties of the Kalkars had dragged it.</p>

  <p>"Now, Brother Peter," said father, at last, "I must go and take my three
  goats to the tax collector, or he will charge me another one for a fine." I
  saw that he tried to speak naturally; but he could not keep the bitterness
  out of his voice.</p>

  <p>Peter pricked up his ears. "Yes," he said, "I had heard of that piece of
  business. This new tax collector was laughing about it to Hoffmeyer. He
  thinks it a fine joke and Hoffmeyer says that now that you got the coal for
  so much less than it was worth he is going before the Twenty-Four and ask
  that you be compelled to pay him the other ninety-five goats that the tax
  collector says the coal is really worth."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed mother, "they would not really do such a wicked
  thing&mdash;I am sure they would not."</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged. "Perhaps they only joked," he said; "these Kalkars are
  great jokers."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said father, "they are great jokers; but some day I shall have my
  little joke," and he walked out toward the pens where the goats were kept
  when not on pasture.</p>

  <p>Mother looked after him with a troubled light in her eyes and I saw her
  shoot a quick glance at Peter, who presently followed father from the house
  and went his way.</p>

  <p>Father and I took the goats to the tax collector. He was a small man with
  a mass of red hair, a thin nose and two small, close-set eyes. His name was
  Soor. As soon as he saw father he commenced to fume.</p>

  <p>"What is your name, man?" he demanded insolently.</p>

  <p>"Julian 8th," replied father. "Here are the three goats in payment of my
  income tax for this month&mdash;shall I put them in the pen?"</p>

  <p>"What did you say your name is?" snapped the fellow.</p>

  <p>"Julian 8th," father repeated.</p>

  <p>"Julian 8th!" shouted Soor. "'Julian 8th!' I suppose you are too fine a
  gentleman to be brother to such as me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Brother Julian 8th," said father sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Go put your goats in the pen and hereafter remember that all men are
  brothers who are good citizens and loyal to our great Jemadar."</p>

  <p>When father had put the goats away we started for home; but as we were
  passing Soor he shouted: "Well?"</p>

  <p>Father turned a questioning look toward him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" repeated the man.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," said father; "have I not done all that the law
  requires?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you pigs out here?" Soor fairly screamed. "Back in
  the eastern Teivos a tax collector doesn't have to starve to death on his
  miserable pay&mdash;his people bring him little presents."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said father quietly, "I will bring you something next time I
  come to market."</p>

  <p>"See that you do," snapped Soor.</p>

  <p>Father did not speak all the way home, nor did he say a word until after
  we had finished our dinner of cheese, goat's milk and corn cakes. I was so
  angry that I could scarce contain myself; but I had been brought up in an
  atmosphere of repression and terrorism that early taught me to keep a still
  tongue in my head.</p>

  <p>When father had finished his meal he rose suddenly&mdash;so suddenly that
  his chair flew across the room to the opposite wall&mdash;and squaring his
  shoulders he struck his chest a terrible blow.</p>

  <p>"Coward! Dog!" he cried. "My God! I cannot stand it. I shall go mad if I
  must submit longer to such humiliation. I am no longer a man. There are no
  men! We are worms that the swine grind into the earth with their polluted
  hoofs. And I dared say nothing. I stood there while that offspring of
  generations of menials and servants insulted me and spat upon me and I dared
  say nothing but meekly to propitiate him. It is disgusting.</p>

  <p>"In a few generations they have sapped the manhood from American men. My
  ancestors fought at Bunker Hill, at Gettysburg, at San Juan, at Chateau
  Thierry. And I? I bend the knee to every degraded creature that wears the
  authority of the beasts at Washington&mdash;and not one of them is an
  American&mdash;scarce one of them an earth man. To the scum of the moon I bow
  my head&mdash;I who am one of the few survivors of the most powerful people
  the world ever knew."</p>

  <p>"Julian!" cried my mother, "be careful, dear. Some one may be listening."
  I could see her tremble.</p>

  <p>"And you are an American woman!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Julian, don't!" she pleaded. "It is not on my account&mdash;you know that
  it is not&mdash;but for you and our boy. I do not care what becomes of me;
  but I cannot see you torn from us as we have seen others taken from their
  families, who dared speak their minds."</p>

  <p>"I know, dear heart," he said after a brief silence. "I know&mdash;it is
  the way with each of us. I dare not on your account and Julian's, you dare
  not on ours, and so it goes. Ah, if there were only more of us. If I could
  but find a thousand men who dared!"</p>

  <p>"S-s-sh!" cautioned mother. "There are so many spies. One never knows.
  That is why I cautioned you when Brother Peter was here today. One never
  knows."</p>

  <p>"You suspect Peter?" asked father.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," replied mother; "I am afraid of every one. It is a
  frightful existence and though I have lived it thus all my life, and my
  mother before me and her mother before that, I never became hardened to
  it."</p>

  <p>"The American spirit has been bent but not broken," said father. "Let us
  hope that it will never break."</p>

  <p>"If we have the hearts to suffer always it will not break," said mother,
  "but it is hard, so hard&mdash;when one even hates to bring a child into the
  world," and she glanced at me, "because of the misery and suffering to which
  it is doomed for life. I yearned for children, always; but I feared to have
  them&mdash;mostly I feared that they might be girls. To be a girl in this
  world today&mdash;Oh, it is frightful!"</p>

  <p>After supper father and I went out and milked the goats and saw that the
  sheds were secured for the night against the dogs. It seemed as though they
  became more numerous and more bold each year. They ran in packs where there
  were only individuals when I was a little boy and it was scarce safe for a
  grown man to travel an unfrequented locality at night. We were not permitted
  to have firearms in our possession, nor even bows and arrows, so we could not
  exterminate them and they seem to realize our weakness, coming close in among
  the houses and pens at night.</p>

  <p>They were large brutes&mdash;fearless and powerful. There was one pack
  more formidable than the others which father said appeared to carry a strong
  strain of collie and airedale blood&mdash;the members of this pack were
  large, cunning and ferocious and were becoming a terror to the city&mdash;we
  called them the Hellhounds.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">III. &mdash; THE HELLHOUNDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER we returned to the house with the milk Jim Thompson
  and his woman, Mollie Sheehan, came over. They lived up the river about half
  a mile, on the next farm, and were our best friends. They were the only
  people that father and mother really trusted, so when we were all together
  alone we spoke our minds very freely. It seemed strange to me, even as a boy,
  that such, big strong men as father and Jim should be afraid to express their
  real views to any one, and though I was born and reared in an atmosphere of
  suspicion and terror I could never quite reconcile myself to the attitude of
  servility and cowardice which marked us all.</p>

  <p>And yet I knew that my father was no coward. He was a fine-looking man,
  too&mdash;tall and wonderfully muscled&mdash;and I have seen him fight with
  men and with dogs and once he defended mother against a Kash Guard and with
  his bare hands he killed the armed soldier. He lies in the center of the goat
  pen now, his rifle, bayonet and ammunition wrapped in many thicknesses of
  oiled cloth beside him. We left no trace and were never even suspected; but
  we know where there is a rifle, a bayonet and ammunition.</p>

  <p>Jim had had trouble with Soor, the new tax collector, too, and was very
  angry. Jim was a big man and, like father, was always smooth shaven as were
  nearly all Americans, as we called those whose people had lived here long
  before the Great War. The others&mdash;the true Kalkars&mdash;grew no beards.
  Their ancestors had come from the moon many years before. They had come in
  strange ships year after year, but finally, one by one, their ships had been
  lost and as none of them knew how to build others or the engines that
  operated them the time came when no more Kalkars could come from the moon to
  earth.</p>

  <p>That was good for us, but it came too late, for the Kalkars already here
  bred like flies in a shady stable. The pure Kalkars were the worst, but there
  were millions of half-breeds and they were bad, too, and I think they really
  hated us pure bred earth men worse than the true Kalkars, or moon men,
  did.</p>

  <p>Jim was terribly mad. He said that he couldn't stand it much
  longer&mdash;that he would rather be dead than live in such an awful world;
  but I was accustomed to such talk&mdash;I had heard it since infancy. Life
  was a hard thing&mdash;just work, work, work, for a scant existence over and
  above the income tax. No pleasures&mdash;few conveniences or comforts;
  absolutely no luxuries&mdash;and, worst of all, no hope. It was seldom that
  any one smiled&mdash;any one in our class&mdash;and the grown-ups never
  laughed. As children we laughed&mdash;a little; not much. It is hard to kill
  the spirit of childhood; but the brotherhood of man had almost done it.</p>

  <p>"It's your own fault, Jim," said father. He was always blaming our
  troubles on Jim, for Jim's people had been American workmen before the Great
  War&mdash;mechanics and skilled artisans in various trades. "Your people
  never took a stand against the invaders. They flirted with the new theory of
  brotherhood the Kalkars brought with them from the moon.</p>

  <p>"They listened to the emissaries of the malcontents and, afterward, when
  Kalkars sent their disciples among us they &lsquo;first endured, then pitied,
  then embraced.' They had the numbers and the power to combat successfully the
  wave of insanity that started with the lunar catastrophe and overran the
  world&mdash;they could have kept it out of America; but they
  didn't&mdash;instead they listened to false prophets and placed their great
  strength in the hands of the corrupt leaders."</p>

  <p>"And how about your class?" countered Jim, "too rich and lazy and
  indifferent even to vote. They tried to grind us down while they waxed fat
  off of our labor."</p>

  <p>"The ancient sophistry!" snapped father. "There was never a more
  prosperous or independent class of human beings in the world than the
  American laboring man of the twentieth century."</p>

  <p>"You talk about us! We were the first to fight it&mdash;my people fought
  and bled and died to keep Old Glory above the capitol at Washington; but we
  were too few and now the Kash flag of the Kalkars floats in its place and for
  nearly a century it had been a crime punishable by death to have the Stars
  and Stripes in your possession."</p>

  <p>He walked quickly across the room to the fireplace and removed a stone
  above the rough, wooden mantel. Reaching his hand into the aperture behind he
  turned toward us.</p>

  <p>"But cowed and degraded as I have become," he cried, "thank God I still
  have a spark of manhood left&mdash;I have had the strength to defy them as my
  fathers defied them&mdash;I have kept this that has been handed down to
  me&mdash;kept it for my son to hand down to his son&mdash;and I have taught
  him to die for it as his forefathers died for it and as I would die for it,
  gladly."</p>

  <p>He drew forth a small bundle of fabric and holding the upper corners
  between the fingers of his two hands he let it unfold before us&mdash;an
  oblong cloth of alternate red and white striped with a blue square in one
  corner, upon which were sewn many little white stars.</p>

  <p>Jim and Mollie and mother rose to their feet and I saw mother cast an
  apprehensive glance toward the doorway. For a moment they stood thus in
  silence, looking with wide eyes upon the thing that father held and then Jim
  walked slowly toward it and, kneeling, took the edge of it in his great,
  horny fingers and pressed it to his lips and the candle upon the rough table,
  sputtering in the spring wind that waved the the goat skin at the window,
  cast its feeble rays upon them.</p>

  <p>"It is the Flag, my son," said father to me. "It is Old Glory&mdash;the
  flag of your fathers&mdash;the flag that made the world a decent place to
  live in. It is death to possess it; but when I am gone take it and guard it
  as our family has guarded it since the regiment that carried it came back
  from the Argonne."</p>

  <p>I felt tears filling my eyes&mdash;why, I could not have told
  them&mdash;and I turned away to hide them&mdash;turned toward the window and
  there, beyond the waving goat skin, I saw a face in the outer darkness. I
  have always been quick of thought and of action; but I never thought or moved
  more quickly in my life than I did in the instant following my discovery of
  the face in the window. With a single movement I swept the candle from the
  table, plunging the room into utter darkness, and leaping to my father's side
  I tore the Flag from his hands and thrust it back into the aperture above the
  mantel. The stone lay upon the mantel itself, nor did it take me but a moment
  to grope for it and find it in the dark&mdash;an instant more and it was
  replaced in its niche.</p>

  <p>So ingrained were apprehension and suspicion in the human mind that the
  four in the room with me sensed intuitively something of the cause of my act
  and when I had hunted for the candle, found it and relighted it they were
  standing, tense and motionless where I had last seen them. They did not ask
  me a question. Father was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"You were very careless and clumsy, Julian," he said. "If you wanted the
  candle why did you not pick it up carefully instead of rushing at it so? But
  that is always your way&mdash;you are constantly knocking things over."</p>

  <p>He raised his voice a trifle as he spoke; but it was a lame attempt at
  deception and he knew it, as did we. If the man who owned the face in the
  dark heard his words he must have known it as well.</p>

  <p>As soon as I had relighted the candle I went into the kitchen and out the
  back door and then, keeping close in the black shadow of the house, I crept
  around toward the front, for I wanted to learn, if I could, who it was who
  had looked in upon that scene of high treason. The night was moonless but
  clear, and I could see quite a distance in every direction, as our house
  stood in a fair size clearing close to the river. Southeast of us the path
  wound upward across the approach to an ancient bridge, long since destroyed
  by raging mobs or rotting away&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;and presently
  I saw the figure of a man silhouetted against the starlit sky as he topped
  the approach. The man carried a laden sack upon his back. This fact was, to
  some extent, reassuring as it suggested that the eavesdropper was himself
  upon some illegal mission and that he could ill afford to be too particular
  of the actions of others. I have seen many men carrying sacks and bundles at
  night&mdash;I have carried them myself. It is the only way, often, in which a
  man may save enough from the tax collector on which to live and support his
  family.</p>

  <p>This nocturnal traffic is common enough and under our old tax collector
  and the indolent commandant of former times not so hazardous as it might seem
  when one realizes that it is punishable by imprisonment for ten years at hard
  labor in the coal mines and, in aggravated cases, by death. The aggravated
  cases are those in which a man is discovered trading something by night that
  the tax collector or the commandant had wanted for himself.</p>

  <p>I did not follow the man, being sure that he was one of our own class, but
  turned back toward the house where I found the four talking in low whispers,
  nor did any of us raise his voice again that evening.</p>

  <p>Father and Jim were talking, as they usually did, of the West. They seemed
  to feel that somewhere, far away toward the setting sun, there must be a
  little corner of America where men could live in peace and
  freedom&mdash;where there were no Kash Guards, tax collectors or Kalkars.</p>

  <p>It must have been three quarters of an hour later, as Jim and Mollie were
  preparing to leave, that there came a knock upon the door which immediately
  swung open before an invitation to enter could be given. We looked up to see
  Peter Johansen smiling at us. I never liked Peter. He was a long, lanky man
  who smiled with his mouth; but never with his eyes. I didn't like the way he
  used to look at mother when he thought no one was observing him, nor his
  habit of changing women every year or two&mdash;that was too much like the
  Kalkars. I always felt toward Peter as I had as a child when, barefooted, I
  stepped unknowingly upon a snake in the deep grass.</p>

  <p>Father greeted the newcomer with a pleasant "Welcome, Brother Johansen;"
  but Jim only nodded his head and scowled, for Peter had a habit of looking at
  Mollie as he did at mother, and both women were beautiful. I think I never
  saw a more beautiful woman than my mother and as I grew older and learned
  more of men and the world I marveled that father had been able to keep her
  and, too, I understood why she never went abroad; but stayed always closely
  about the house and farm. I never knew her to go to the market place as did
  most of the other women. But I was twenty now and worldly wise.</p>

  <p>"What brings you out so late, Brother Johansen?" I asked. We always used
  the prescribed "Brother" to those of whom we were not sure. I hate the
  word&mdash;to me a brother meant an enemy as it did to all our class and I
  guess to every class&mdash;even the Kalkars.</p>

  <p>"I followed a stray pig," replied Peter to my question. "He went in that
  direction," and he waved a hand toward the market place. As he did so
  something tumbled from beneath his coat&mdash;something that his arm had held
  there. It was an empty sack. Immediately I knew who it was owned the face in
  the dark beyond our goatskin hanging. Peter snatched the sack from the floor
  in ill-concealed confusion and then I saw the expression of his cunning face
  change as he held it toward father.</p>

  <p>"Is this yours, Brother Julian?" he asked. "I found it just before your
  door and thought that I would stop and ask."</p>

  <p>"No," said I, not waiting for father to speak, "it is not ours&mdash;it
  must belong to the man whom I saw carrying it, full, a short time since. He
  went by the path beside the old bridge." I looked straight into Peter's eyes.
  He flushed and then went white.</p>

  <p>"I did not see him," he said presently; "but if the sack is not yours I
  will keep it&mdash;at least it is not high treason to have it in my
  possession." Then, without another word, he turned and left the house.</p>

  <p>We all knew then that Peter had seen the episode of the flag. Father said
  that we need not fear, that Peter was all right; but Jim thought differently
  and so did Mollie and mother, I agreed with them. I did not like Peter. Jim
  and Mollie went home shortly after Peter left and we prepared for bed. Mother
  and Father occupied the one bedroom. I slept on some goat skins in the big
  room we called the living room. The other room was a kitchen. We ate there
  also.</p>

  <p>Mother had always made me take off my clothes and put on a mohair garment
  for sleeping. The other young men I knew slept in the same clothes they wore
  during the day; but mother was particular about this and insisted that I have
  my sleeping garments and also that I bathed often&mdash;once a week in the
  winter. In the summer I was in the river so much that I had a bath once or
  twice a day. Father was also particular about his personal cleanliness. The
  Kalkars were very different.</p>

  <p>My underclothing was of fine mohair, in winter. In summer I wore none: I
  had a heavy mohair shirt and breeches, tight at waist and knees and baggy
  between, a goatskin tunic and boots of goatskin. I do not know what we would
  have done without the goats&mdash;they furnished us food and raiment. The
  boots were loose and fastened just above the calf of the leg with a
  strap&mdash;to keep them from falling down. I wore nothing on my head, summer
  or winter; but my hair was heavy. I wore it brushed straight back, always,
  and cut off square behind just below my ears. To keep it from getting in my
  eyes I always tied a goatskin thong about my head.</p>

  <p>I had just slipped off my tunic when I heard the baying of the Hellhounds
  close by. I thought they might be getting into the goat pen, so I waited a
  moment, listening and then I heard a scream&mdash;the scream of a woman in
  terror. It sounded down by the river near the goat pens, and mingled with it
  was the vicious growling and barking of the Hellhounds. I did not wait to
  listen longer, but seized my knife and a long staff. We were permitted to
  have no edged weapon with a blade over six inches long. Such as it was, it
  was the best weapon I had and much better than none.</p>

  <p>I ran out the front door, which was closest, and turned toward the pens in
  the direction of the Hellhounds' deep growling and the screams of the
  woman.</p>

  <p>As I neared the pens and my eyes became accustomed to the outer darkness I
  made out what appeared to be a human figure resting partially upon the top of
  one of the sheds that formed a portion of the pen wall. The legs and lower
  body dangled over the edge of the roof and I could see three or four
  Hellhounds leaping for it, while another, that had evidently gotten a hold,
  was hanging to one leg and attempting to drag the figure down.</p>

  <p>As I ran forward I shouted at the beasts and those that were leaping for
  the figure stopped and turned toward me. I knew something of the temper of
  these animals and that I might expect them to charge, for they were quite
  fearless of man ordinarily; but I ran forward toward them so swiftly and with
  such determination that they turned growling and ran off.</p>

  <p>The one that had hold of the figure succeeded in dragging it to earth just
  before I reached them and then it discovered me and turned, standing over its
  prey, with wide jaws and terrific fangs menacing me. It was a huge beast,
  almost as large as a full grown goat, and easily a match for several men as
  poorly armed as I. Under ordinary circumstances I should have given it plenty
  of room; but what was I to do when the life of a woman was at stake?</p>

  <p>I was an American, not a Kalkar&mdash;those swine would throw a woman to
  the Hellhounds to save their own skins&mdash;and I had been brought up to
  revere woman in a world that considered her on a par with the cow, the nanny
  and the sow, only less valuable since the latter were not the common property
  of the state.</p>

  <p>I knew then that death stood very near as I faced that frightful beast and
  from the corner of an eye I could see its mates creeping closer. There was no
  time to think, even, and so I rushed in upon the Hellhound with my staff and
  blade. As I did so I saw the wide and terrified eyes of a young girl looking
  up at me from beneath the beast of prey. I had not thought to desert her to
  her fate before; but after that single glance I could not have done so had a
  thousand deaths confronted me.</p>

  <p>As I was almost upon the beast it sprang for my throat, rising high upon
  its hind feet and leaping straight as an arrow. My staff was useless and so I
  dropped it, meeting the charge with my knife and a bare hand. By luck the
  fingers of my left hand found the creature's throat at the first clutch; but
  the impact of his body against mine hurled me to the ground beneath him and
  there, growling and struggling, he sought to close those snapping fangs upon
  me. Holding his jaws at arm's length I struck at his breast with my blade,
  nor did I miss him once. The pain of the wounds turned him crazy and yet, to
  my utter surprise found I still could hold him and not that alone; but that I
  could also struggle to my knees and then to my feet&mdash;still holding him
  at arm's length in my left hand.</p>

  <p>I had always known that I was muscular; but until that moment I had never
  dreamed of the great strength that Nature had given me, for never before had
  I had occasion to exert the full measure of my powerful thews. It was like a
  revelation from above and of a sudden I found myself smiling and in the
  instant a miracle occurred&mdash;all fear of these hideous beasts dissolved
  from my brain like thin air and with it fear of man as well. I, who had been
  brought out of a womb of fear into a world of terror, who had been suckled
  and nurtured upon apprehension and timidity&mdash;I, Julian 9th, at the age
  of twenty years, became in the fraction of a second utterly fearless of man
  or beast. It was the knowledge of my great power that did it&mdash;that and,
  perhaps, those two liquid eyes that I knew to be watching me.</p>

  <p>The other hounds were closing in upon me when the creature in my grasp
  went suddenly limp. My blade must have found its heart. And then the others
  charged and I saw the girl upon her feet beside me, my staff in her hands,
  ready to battle with them.</p>

  <p>"To the roof!" I shouted to her; but she did not heed. Instead she stood
  her ground, striking a vicious blow at the leader as he came within
  range.</p>

  <p>Swinging the dead beast above my head I hurled the carcass at the others
  so that they scattered and retreated again and then I turned to the girl and
  without more parley lifted her in my arms and tossed her lightly to the roof
  of the goat shed. I could easily have followed to her side and safety had not
  something filled my brain with an effect similar to that which I imagined
  must be produced by the vile concoction brewed by the Kalkars and which they
  drank to excess, while it would have meant imprisonment for us to be
  apprehended with it in our possession. At least, I know that I felt a sudden
  exhilaration&mdash;a strange desire to accomplish wonders before the eyes of
  this stranger, and so I turned upon the four remaining hellhounds who had now
  bunched to renew the attack and without waiting for them I rushed toward
  them.</p>

  <p>They did not flee; but stood their ground, growling hideously, their hair
  bristling upon their necks and along their spines, their great fangs bared
  and slavering; but among them I tore and by the very impetuosity of my attack
  I overthrew them. The first sprang to meet me and him I seized by the neck
  and clamping his body between my knees I twisted his head entirely around,
  until I heard the vertebrae snap. The other three were upon me then, leaping
  and tearing; but I felt no fear. One by one I took them in my mighty hands
  and lifting them high above my head hurled them violently from me. Two only
  returned to the attack and these I vanquished with my bare hands disdaining
  to use my blade upon such carrion.</p>

  <p>It was then that I saw a man running toward me from up the river and
  another from our house. The first was Jim, who had heard commotion and the
  girl's screams and the other was my father. Both had seen the last part of
  the battle and neither could believe that it was I, Julian, who had done this
  thing. Father was very proud of me and Jim was, too, for he had always said
  that having no son of his own father must share me with him.</p>

  <p>And then I turned toward the girl who had slipped from the roof and was
  approaching us. She moved with the same graceful dignity that was
  mother's&mdash;not at all like the clumsy clods that belonged to the Kalkars,
  and she came straight to me and laid a hand upon my arm.</p>

  <p>"Thank, you!" she said; "and God bless you. Only a very brave and powerful
  man could have done what you have done."</p>

  <p>And then, all of a sudden, I did not feel brave at all; but very weak and
  silly, for all I could do was finger my blade and look at the ground. It was
  father who spoke and the interruption helped to dispel my embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked, "and from where do you come? It is strange to
  find a young woman wandering about alone at night; but stranger still to hear
  one who dares invoke the forbidden deity."</p>

  <p>I had not realized until then that she had used His name; but when I did
  recall it, I could not but glance apprehensively about to see if any others
  might be around who could have heard. Father and Jim I knew to be safe; for
  there was a common tie between our families that lay in the secret religious
  rites we held once each week. Since that hideous day that had befallen even
  before my father's birth&mdash;that day, which none dared mention above a
  whisper, when the clergy of every denomination, to the last man, had been
  murdered by order of the Twenty-Four, it had been a capital crime to worship
  God in any form whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Some madman at Washington, filled, doubtless, with the fumes of the awful
  drink that made them more bestial even than Nature designed them, issued the
  frightful order on the ground that the church was attempting to usurp the
  functions of the state and that also the clergy were inciting the people to
  rebellion&mdash;nor do I doubt but that the latter was true. Too bad, indeed,
  that they were not given more time to bring their divine plan to
  fruition.</p>

  <p>We took the girl to the house and when my mother saw her and how young and
  beautiful she was and took her in her arms, the child broke down and sobbed
  and clung to mother, nor could either speak for some time. In the light of
  the candle I saw that the stranger was of wondrous beauty. I have said that
  my mother was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen, and such is the
  truth; but this girl who had come so suddenly among us was the most beautiful
  girl.</p>

  <p>She was about nineteen, delicately molded and yet without weakness. There
  were strength and vitality apparent in every move she made as well as in the
  expression of her face, her gestures and her manner of speech. She was
  girlish and at the same time filled one with an impression of great reserves
  of strength of mind and character. She was very brown, showing exposure to
  the sun, yet her skin was clear&mdash;almost translucent.</p>

  <p>Her garb was similar to mine&mdash;the common attire of people of our
  class, both men and women. She wore the tunic and breeches and boots just as
  mother and Mollie and the rest of us did; but somehow there was a
  difference&mdash;I had never before realized what a really beautiful costume
  it was. The band about her forehead was wider than was generally worn and
  upon it were sewn numerous tiny shells, set close together and forming a
  pattern. It was her only attempt at ornamentation; but even so it was quite
  noticeable in a world where women strove to make themselves plain rather than
  beautiful&mdash;some going even so far as to permanently disfigure their
  faces and those of their female offspring, while others, many, many others,
  killed the latter in infancy. Mollie had done so with two. No wonder that
  grown-ups never laughed and seldom smiled!</p>

  <p>When the girl had quieted her sobs on mother's breast father renewed his
  questioning; but mother said to wait until morning, that the girl was tired
  and unstrung and needed sleep. Then came the question of where she was to
  sleep. Father said that he would sleep in the living room with me and that
  the stranger could sleep with mother; but Jim suggested that she come home
  with him as he and Mollie had three rooms, as did we, and no one to occupy
  his living room. And so it was arranged, although I would rather have had her
  remain with us.</p>

  <p>At first she rather shrank from going, until mother told her that Jim and
  Mollie were good, kind-hearted people and that she would be as safe with them
  as with her own father and mother. At mention of her parents the tears came
  to her eyes and she turned impulsively toward my mother and kissed her, after
  which she told Jim that she was ready to accompany him.</p>

  <p>She started to say goodbye to me and to thank me again; but, having found
  my tongue at last, I told her that I would go with them as far as Jim's
  house. This appeared to please her and so we set forth. Jim walked ahead and
  I followed with the girl, and on the way I discovered a very strange thing.
  Father had shown me a piece of iron once that pulled smaller bits of iron to
  it. He said that it was a magnet.</p>

  <p>This slender, stranger girl was certainly no piece of iron, nor was I a
  smaller bit of anything; but nevertheless I could not keep away from her. I
  cannot explain it&mdash;however wide the way was I was always drawn over
  close to her, so that our arms touched and once our hands swung together and
  the strangest and most delicious thrill ran through me that I had ever
  experienced.</p>

  <p>I used to think that Jim's house was a long way from ours&mdash;when I had
  to carry things over there as a boy; but that night it was far too
  close&mdash;just a step or two and we were there.</p>

  <p>Mollie heard us coming and was at the door, full of questionings, and when
  she saw the girl and heard a part of our story she reached out and took the
  girl to her bosom, just as mother had. Before they took her in the stranger
  turned and held out her hand to me.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" she said, "and thank you again, and, once more, may God, our
  Father, bless and preserve you."</p>

  <p>And I heard Mollie murmur: "The Saints be praised!" and then they went in
  and the door closed and I turned homeward, treading on air.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">IV. &mdash; BROTHER GENERAL OR-TIS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE next day I set out as usual to peddle goat's milk. We
  were permitted to trade in perishable things on other than market days,
  though we had to make a strict accounting of all such bartering. I usually
  left Mollie until the last as Jim had a deep, cold well on his place where I
  liked to quench my thirst after my morning trip; but that day Mollie got her
  milk fresh and first and early&mdash;about half an hour earlier than I was
  wont to start out.</p>

  <p>When I knocked and she bid me enter she looked surprised at first, for
  just an instant, and then a strange expression came into her eyes&mdash;half
  amusement, half pity&mdash;and she rose and went into the kitchen for the
  milk jar. I saw her wipe the corners of her eyes with the back of one finger;
  but I did not understand why&mdash;not then.</p>

  <p>The stranger girl had been in the kitchen helping Mollie and the latter
  must have told her I was there, for she came right in and greeted me. It was
  the first good look I had had of her, for candle light is not brilliant at
  best. If I had been enthralled the evening before there is no word in my
  limited vocabulary to express the effect she had on me by daylight.
  She&mdash;but it is useless. I cannot describe her!</p>

  <p>It took Mollie a long time to find the milk jar&mdash;bless
  her!&mdash;though it seemed short enough to me, and while she was finding it
  the stranger girl and I were getting acquainted. First she asked after father
  and mother and then she asked our names. When I told her mine she repeated it
  several times. "Julian 9th," she said; "Julian 9th!" and then she smiled up
  at me. "It is a nice name, I like it."</p>

  <p>"And what is your name?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Juana," she said&mdash;she pronounced it Whanna; "Juana St. John."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," I said, "that you like my name; but I like yours better." It
  was a very foolish speech and it made me feel silly; but she did not seem to
  think it foolish, or if she did she was too nice to let me know it. I have
  known many girls; but mostly they were homely and stupid. The pretty girls
  were seldom allowed in the market place&mdash;that is, the pretty girls of
  our class. The Kalkars permitted their girls to go abroad, for they did not
  care who got them, as long as some one got them; but American fathers and
  mothers would rather slay their girls than send them to the market place, and
  the former often was done. The Kalkar girls, even those born of American
  mothers, were coarse and brutal in appearance&mdash;low-browed, vulgar,
  bovine. No stock can be improved, or even kept to its normal plane, unless
  high grade males are used.</p>

  <p>This girl was so entirely different from any other that I had ever seen
  that I marvelled that such a glorious creature could exist. I wanted to know
  all about her. It seemed to me that in some way I had been robbed of my right
  for many years that she should have lived and breathed and talked and gone
  her way without my ever knowing it, or her. I wanted to make up for lost time
  and so I asked her many questions.</p>

  <p>She told me that she had been born and raised in the Teivos just west of
  Chicago, which extended along the Desplaines River and embraced a
  considerable area of unpopulated country and scattered farms.</p>

  <p>"My father's home is in a district called Oak Park," she said, "and our
  house was one of the few that remained from ancient times. It was of solid
  concrete and stood upon the corner of two roads&mdash;once it must have been
  a very beautiful place, and even time and war have been unable entirely to
  erase its charm. Three great poplar trees rose to the north of it beside the
  ruins of what my father said was once a place where motor cars were kept by
  the long dead owner. To the south of the house were many roses, growing wild
  and luxuriant, while the concrete walls, from which the plaster had fallen in
  great patches, were almost entirely concealed by the clinging ivy that
  reached to the very eaves.</p>

  <p>"It was my home and so I loved it; but now it is lost to me forever. The
  Kash Guard and the tax collector came seldom&mdash;we were too far from the
  station and the market place, which lay southwest of us, on Salt Creek. But
  recently the new Jemadar, Jarth, appointed another commandant and a new tax
  collector. They did not like the station at Salt Creek and so they sought for
  a better location and after inspecting the district they chose Oak Park, and
  my father's home being the most comfortable and substantial, they ordered him
  to sell it to the Twenty-Four.</p>

  <p>"You know what that means. They appraised it at a high figure&mdash;fifty
  thousand dollars it was, and paid him in paper money. There was nothing to do
  and so we prepared to move. Whenever they had come to look at the house my
  mother had hidden me in a little cubby-hole on the landing between the second
  and third floors, placing a pile of rubbish in front of me, but the day that
  we were leaving to take a place on the banks of the Desplaines, where father
  thought that we might live without being disturbed, the new commandant came
  unexpectedly and saw me.</p>

  <p>"&lsquo;How old is the girl?' he asked my mother.</p>

  <p>"&lsquo;Fifteen,' she replied sullenly.</p>

  <p>"&lsquo;You lie, you sow!' he cried angrily; &lsquo;she is eighteen if she
  is a day!'</p>

  <p>"Father was standing there beside us and when the commandant spoke as he
  did to mother I saw father go very white and then, without a word, he hurled
  himself upon the swine and before the Kash Guard who accompanied him could
  prevent it, father had almost killed the commandant with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>"You know what happened&mdash;I do not need to tell you. They killed my
  father before my eyes. Then the commandant offered my mother to one of the
  Kash Guard, but she snatched his bayonet from his belt and ran it through her
  heart before they could prevent her. I tried to follow her example, but they
  seized me.</p>

  <p>"I was carried to my own bedroom on the second floor of my father's house
  and locked there. The commandant said that he would come and see me in the
  evening and that everything would be all right with me. I knew what he meant
  and I made up my mind that he would find me dead.</p>

  <p>"My heart was breaking for the loss of my father and mother, and yet the
  desire to live was strong within me. I did not want to die&mdash;something
  urged me to live, and in addition there was the teaching of my father and
  mother. They were both from Quaker stock and very religious. They educated me
  to fear God and to do no wrong by thought or violence to another, and yet I
  had seen my father attempt to kill a man, and I had seen my mother slay
  herself. My world was all upset. I was almost crazed by grief and fear and
  uncertainty as to what was right for me to do.</p>

  <p>"And then darkness came and I heard someone ascending the stairway. The
  windows of the second story are too far from the ground for one to risk a
  leap; but the ivy is old and strong. The commandant was not sufficiently
  familiar with the place to have taken the ivy into consideration and before
  the footsteps reached my door I had swung out of the window and, clinging to
  the ivy, made my way to the ground down the rough and strong old stem.</p>

  <p>"That was three days ago. I hid and wandered&mdash;I did not know in what
  direction I went. Once an old woman took me in overnight and fed me and gave
  me food to carry for the next day. I think that I must have been almost mad,
  for mostly the happenings of the past three days are only indistinct and
  jumbled fragments of memory in my mind. And then the hellhounds! Oh, how
  frightened I was! And then&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>I don't know what there was about the way she said it; but it seemed to me
  as though it meant a great deal more than she knew herself. Almost like a
  prayer of thanksgiving, it was, that she had at last found a safe haven of
  refuge&mdash;safe and permanent. Anyway, I liked the idea.</p>

  <p>And then Mollie came in, and as I was leaving she asked me if I would come
  that evening, and Juana cried: "Oh, yes, do!" and I said that I would.</p>

  <p>When I had finished delivering the goats' milk I started for home, and on
  the way I met old Moses Samuels, the Jew. He made his living, and a scant one
  it was, by tanning hides. He was a most excellent tanner, but as nearly every
  one else knew how to tan there was not many customers; but some of the
  Kalkars used to bring him hides to tan. They knew nothing of how to do any
  useful thing, for they were descended from a long line of the most ignorant
  and illiterate people in the moon and the moment they obtained a little power
  they would not even work at what small trades their fathers once had learned,
  so that after a generation or two they were able to live only off the labor
  of others. They created nothing, they produced nothing, they became the most
  burdensome class of parasites the world ever has endured.</p>

  <p>The rich nonproducers of olden times were a blessing to the world by
  comparison with these, for the former at least had intelligence and
  imagination&mdash;they could direct others and they could transmit to their
  offspring the qualities of mind that are essential to any culture, progress
  or happiness that the world ever may hope to attain.</p>

  <p>So the Kalkars patronized Samuels for their tanned hides, and if they had
  paid him for them the old Jew would have waxed rich; but they either did not
  pay him at all or else mostly in paper money. That did not even burn well, as
  Samuels used to say.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Julian," he called as we met. "I shall be needing some
  hides soon, for the new commander of the Kash Guard has heard of old Samuels
  and has sent for me and ordered five hides tanned the finest that can be.
  Have you seen this Or-tis, Julian?" He lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>I shook my head negatively.</p>

  <p>"Heaven help us!" whispered the old man. "Heaven help us!"</p>

  <p>"Is he as bad as that, Moses?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The old man wrung his hands. "Bad times are ahead, my son," he said. "Old
  Samuels knows his kind. He is not lazy like the last one and he is more cruel
  and more lustful; but about the hides. I have not paid you for the
  last&mdash;they paid me in paper money; but that I would not offer to a
  friend in payment for a last year's bird's nest. May be that I shall not be
  able to pay you for these new hides for a long time it depends upon how
  Or-tis pays me. Sometimes they are liberal&mdash;as they can afford to be
  with the property of others; but if he is a half-breed, as I hear he is, he
  will hate a Jew, and I shall get nothing. However, if he is pure Kalkar it
  may be different&mdash;the pure Kalkars do not hate a Jew more than they hate
  other Earthmen, though there is one Jew who hates a Kalkar."</p>

  <p>That night we had our first introduction to Or-tis. He came in person; but
  I will tell how it all happened. After supper I went over to Jim's. Juana was
  standing in the little doorway as I came up the path. She looked rested now
  and almost happy. The hunted expression had left her eyes and she smiled as I
  approached. It was almost dusk, for the spring evenings were still short; but
  the air was balmy, and so we stood on the outside talking.</p>

  <p>I recited the little gossip of our district that I had picked up during my
  day's work&mdash;the Twenty-Four had raised the local tax on farm
  products&mdash;Andrew Wright's woman had given birth to twins, a boy and a
  girl; but the girl had died; no need of comment here as most girl babies
  die&mdash;Soor had said that he would tax this district until we all died of
  starvation&mdash;pleasant fellow, Soor&mdash;one of the Kash Guard had taken
  Nellie Levy&mdash;Hoffmeyer had said that next winter we would have to pay
  more for coal&mdash;Dennis Corrigan had been sent to the mines for ten years
  because he had been caught trading at night. It was all alike, this gossip of
  ours&mdash;all sordid, or sad, or tragic; but then life was a tragedy with
  us.</p>

  <p>"How stupid of them to raise the tax on farm products," remarked Juana;
  "their fathers stamped out manufactures and commerce and now they will stamp
  out what little agriculture is left."</p>

  <p>"The sooner they do it the better it will be for the world," I replied.
  "When they have starved all the farmers to death they themselves will
  starve."</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, she reverted to Dennis Corrigan. "It would have been
  kinder to have killed him," she said.</p>

  <p>"That is why they did not do so," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever trade at night?" she asked, and then before I could reply:
  "Do not tell me. I should not have asked; but I hope that you do not&mdash;it
  is so dangerous; nearly always are they caught."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "Not nearly always," I said, "or most of us would have been in
  the mines long since. We could not live otherwise. The accursed income tax is
  unfair&mdash;it has always been unfair, for it falls hardest on those least
  able to support it."</p>

  <p>"But the mines are so terrible!" she exclaimed, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "the mines are terrible. I would rather die than go
  there."</p>

  <p>After a while I took Juana over to our house to see my mother. She liked
  the house very much. My father's father built it with his own hands. It is
  constructed of stone taken from the ruins of the old city&mdash;stone and
  brick. Father says that he thinks the bricks are from an old pavement, as we
  still see patches of these ancient bricks in various localities. Nearly all
  our houses are of this construction, for timber is scarce. The foundation
  walls and above the ground for about three feet are of rough stones of
  various sizes and above this are the bricks. The stones are laid so that some
  project farther than others and the effect is odd and rather nice. The eaves
  are low and overhanging and the roof is thatched. It is a nice house and
  mother keeps it scrupulously clean within.</p>

  <p>We had been talking for perhaps an hour, sitting in our living
  room&mdash;father, mother, Juana, and I&mdash;when the door was suddenly
  thrust open without warning and we looked up to see a man in the uniform of a
  Kash Guard confronting us. Behind him were others. We all rose and stood in
  silence. Two entered and took posts on either side of the doorway and then a
  third came in&mdash;a tall, dark man in the uniform of a commander, and we
  knew at once that it was Or-tis. At his heels were six more.</p>

  <p>Or-tis looked at each of us and then, singling out father, he said: "You
  are Brother Julian 8th."</p>

  <p>Father nodded. Or-tis eyed him for a moment and then his gaze wandered to
  mother and Juana, and I saw a new expression lessen the fierce scowl that had
  clouded his face from the moment of his entry. He was a large man; but not of
  the heavy type which is most common among his class. His nose was thin and
  rather fine, his eyes cold, gray, and piercing. He was very different from
  the fat swine that had preceded him&mdash;very different and more dangerous;
  even I could see that. I could see a thin, cruel upper lip and a full and
  sensuous lower. If the other had been a pig this one was a wolf and he had
  the nervous restlessness of the wolf&mdash;and the vitality to carry out any
  wolfish designs he might entertain.</p>

  <p>This visit to our home was typical of the man. The former commander had
  never accompanied his men on any excursion of the sort; but the Teivos was to
  see much of Or-tis. He trusted no one&mdash;he must see to everything himself
  and he was not lazy, which was bad for us.</p>

  <p>"So you are Brother Julian 8th!" he repeated. "I do not have good reports
  of you. I have come for two reasons tonight. One is to warn you that the Kash
  Guard is commanded by a different sort of man from him whom I relieved. I
  will stand no trifling and no treason. There must be unquestioned loyalty to
  the Jemadar at Washington&mdash;every national and local law will be
  enforced. Trouble makers and traitors will get short shrift. A manifesto will
  be read in each market place Saturday&mdash;a manifesto that I have just
  received from Washington. Our great Jemadar has conferred greater powers upon
  the commanders of the Kash Guard. You will come to me with all your
  grievances. Where justice miscarries I shall be the court of last resort. The
  judgment of any court may be appealed to me.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, let wrongdoers beware as under the new law any cause
  may be tried before a summary military court over which the commander of the
  Kash Guard must preside."</p>

  <p>We saw what it meant&mdash;it didn't require much intelligence to see the
  infamy and horror of it. It meant nothing more nor less than that our lives
  and liberty were in the hands of a single man and that Jarth had struck the
  greatest blow of all at human happiness in a land where we had thought such a
  state no longer existed&mdash;taken from us the last mocking remnant of our
  already lost freedom, that he might build for his own aggrandizement a
  powerful political military machine.</p>

  <p>"And," continued Or-tis, "I have come for another reason&mdash;a reason
  that looks bad for you, Brother Julian; but we shall see what we shall see,"
  and turning to the men behind him he issued a curt command: "Search the
  place!" That was all; but I saw, in memory, another man standing in this same
  living room&mdash;a man from beneath whose coat fell an empty sack when he
  raised an arm.</p>

  <p>For an hour, they searched that little three room house. For an hour they
  tumbled our few belongings over and over; but mostly they searched the living
  room and especially about the fireplace did they hunt for a hidden nook. A
  dozen times my heart stood still as I saw them feeling of the stones above
  the mantel.</p>

  <p>We all knew what they sought&mdash;all but Juana&mdash;and we knew what it
  would mean&mdash;if they found it. Death for father and for me, too, perhaps,
  and worse for mother and the girl. And to think that Johansen had done this
  awful thing to curry favor for himself with the new commander! I knew it was
  he&mdash;I knew it as surely as though Or-tis had told me. To curry favor
  with the commander. I thought that that was the reason then. God, had I but
  known his real reason!</p>

  <p>And while they searched, Or-tis talked with us. Mostly he talked with
  mother and Juana. I hated the way that he looked at them, especially Juana;
  but his words were fair enough. He seemed to be trying to get an expression
  from them of their political ideas&mdash;he, who was of the class that had
  ruthlessly stolen from women the recognition they had won in the twentieth
  century after ages of slavery and trials, attempting to sound them on their
  political faiths! They had none&mdash;no women have any&mdash;they only know
  that they hate and loathe the oppressors who have hurled them back into
  virtual slavery. That is their politics; that is their religion. Hate. But
  then the world is all hate&mdash;hate and misery.</p>

  <p>Father says that it was not always so; but that once the world was
  happy&mdash;at least, our part of the world; but the people didn't know when
  they were well off. They came from all other parts of the world to share our
  happiness and when they had won it they sought to overthrow it, and when the
  Kalkars came they helped them.</p>

  <p>Well, they searched for an hour and found nothing; but I knew that Or-tis
  was not satisfied that the thing he sought was not there and toward the end
  of the search I could see that he was losing patience. He took direct charge
  at last and then when they had no better success under his direction he
  became very angry.</p>

  <p>"Yankee swine!" he cried suddenly, turning upon father. "You will find
  that you cannot fool a descendant of the great Jemadar Orthis as you have
  fooled the others&mdash;not for long. I have a nose for traitors&mdash;I can
  smell a Yank farther than most men can see one. Take a warning, take a
  warning to your kind. It will be death or the mines for every traitor in the
  Teivos."</p>

  <p>He stood then in silence for a moment, glaring at father and then his gaze
  moved to Juana.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, girl?" he demanded. "Where do you live and what do you do
  that adds to the prosperity of the community?"</p>

  <p>"Adds to the prosperity of the community!" It was a phrase often on their
  lips and it was always directed at us&mdash;a meaningless phrase, as there
  was no prosperity. We supported the Kalkars and that was their idea of
  prosperity. I suppose ours was to get barely sufficient to sustain life and
  strength to enable us to continue slaving for them.</p>

  <p>"I live with Mollie Sheehan," replied Juana, "and help her care for the
  chickens and the little pigs; also I help with the housework."</p>

  <p>"H-m!" ejaculated Or-tis. "Housework! That is good&mdash;I shall be
  needing some one to keep my quarters tidy. How about it, my girl? It will be
  easy work, and I will pay you well&mdash;no pigs or chickens to slave for.
  Eh?"</p>

  <p>"But I love the little pigs and chickens," she pleaded, "and I am happy
  with Mollie&mdash;I do not wish to change."</p>

  <p>"Do not wish to change, eh?" he mimicked her. She had drawn farther behind
  me now, as though for protection, and closer&mdash;I could feel her body
  touching mine. "Mollie can doubtless take care of her own pigs and chickens
  without help. If she has so many she cannot do it alone, then she has too
  many, and we will see why it is that she is more prosperous than the rest of
  us&mdash;probably she should pay a larger income tax&mdash;we shall see."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" cried Juana, frightened now on Mollie's account. "Please, she
  has only a few, scarcely enough that she and her man may live after the taxes
  are paid."</p>

  <p>"Then she does not need you to help her," said Or-tis with finality, a
  nasty sneer upon his lip. "You will come and work for me, girl!"</p>

  <p>And then Juana surprised me&mdash;she surprised us all, and particularly
  Or-tis. Before she had been rather pleading and seemingly a little
  frightened; but now she drew herself to her full height and with her chin in
  air looked Or-tis straight in the eye.</p>

  <p>"I will not come," she said, haughtily; "I do not wish to." That was
  all.</p>

  <p>Or-tis looked surprised; his soldiers, shocked. For a moment no one spoke.
  I glanced at mother. She was not trembling as I had expected. Her head was
  up, too, and she was openly looking her scorn of the Kalkar. Father stood as
  he usually did before them, with his head bowed; but I saw that he was
  watching Or-tis out of the corners of his eyes and that his fingers were
  moving as might the fingers of hands fixed upon a hated throat.</p>

  <p>"You will come," said Or-tis, a little red in the face now at this
  defiance. "There are ways," and he looked straight at me&mdash;and then he
  turned upon his heel and, followed by his Kash Guard, left the house.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE FIGHT ON MARKET DAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the door had closed upon them Juana buried her face in
  her hands.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what misery I bring everywhere," she sobbed. "To my father and mother
  I brought death, and now to you all and to Jim and Mollie I am bringing ruin
  and perhaps death also. But it shall not be&mdash;you shall not suffer for
  me! He looked straight at you, Julian, when he made his threat. What could he
  mean to do? You have done nothing. But you need not fear. I know how I may
  undo the harm I have so innocently done."</p>

  <p>We tried to assure her that we did not care&mdash;that we would protect
  her as best we could and that she must not feel that she had brought any
  greater burden upon us than we already carried; but she only shook her head
  and at last asked me to take her home to Mollie's.</p>

  <p>She was very quiet all the way back, though I did my best to cheer her
  up.</p>

  <p>"He cannot make you work for him," I insisted. "Even the Twenty-Four,
  rotten as it is, would never dare enforce such an order. We are not yet
  entirely slaves."</p>

  <p>"But I am afraid that he will find a way," she replied, "through you, my
  friend. I saw him look at you and it was a very ugly look."</p>

  <p>"I do not fear," I said.</p>

  <p>"I fear for you. No, it shall not be!" She spoke with such vehement
  finality that she almost startled me and then she bid me good night and went
  into Mollie's house and closed the door.</p>

  <p>All the way back home I was much worried about her, for I did not like to
  see her unhappy. I felt that her fears were exaggerated, for even such a
  powerful man as the commandant could not make her work for him if she did not
  wish to. Later he might take her as his woman if she had no man, but even
  then she had some choice in the matter&mdash;a month in which to choose some
  one else if she did not care to bear his children. That was the law.</p>

  <p>Of course, they found ways to circumvent the law when they wanted a girl
  badly enough&mdash;the man of her choice might be apprehended upon some
  trumped-up charge, or even be found some morning mysteriously murdered. It
  must be a heroic woman who stood out against them for long, and a man must
  love a girl very deeply to sacrifice his life for her&mdash;and then not save
  her. There was but one way and by the time I reached my cot I was almost
  frantic with fear lest she might seize upon it.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes I paced the floor and with every minute the conviction
  grew that the worst was about to happen. It became an obsession. I could see
  her even as plainly as with my physical eyesight and then I could stand it no
  longer.</p>

  <p>Bolting for the doorway I ran as fast as my legs would carry me in the
  direction of Jim's house. Just before I reached it I saw a shadowy figure
  moving in the direction of the river. I could not make out who it was; but I
  knew and redoubled my speed.</p>

  <p>A low bluff overhangs the stream at this point and upon its edge&mdash;I
  saw the figure pause for a moment and then disappear. There was a splash in
  the water below just as I reached the rim of the bluff&mdash;a splash and
  circling rings spreading outward on the surface of the river in the
  starlight.</p>

  <p>I saw these things&mdash;the whole picture&mdash;in the fraction of a
  moment, for I scarcely paused upon the bluff's edge; but dove headlong for
  the rippling water close to the center of those diverging circles.</p>

  <p>We came up together, side by side, and I reached out and seized her tunic,
  and thus, holding her at arm's length, I swam ashore with her, keeping her
  chin above water. She did not struggle and when at last we stood upon the
  bank she turned upon me, tearless, yet sobbing.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it?" she moaned. "Oh, why did you do it? It was the only
  way&mdash;the only way."</p>

  <p>She looked so forlorn and unhappy and so altogether beautiful that I could
  scarcely keep from taking her in my arms, for then, quite unexpectedly, I
  realized what I had been too stupid to realize before&mdash;that I loved
  her.</p>

  <p>But I only took her hands in mine and pressed them very tightly and begged
  her to promise me that she would not attempt this thing again. I told her
  that she might never hear from Or-tis again and that it was wicked to destroy
  herself until there was no other way.</p>

  <p>"It is not that I fear myself," she said. "I can always find this way out
  at the last minute; but I fear for you who have been kind to me. If I go now
  you will no longer be in danger."</p>

  <p>"I would rather be in danger than have you go," I said simply. "I do not
  fear."</p>

  <p>And she promised me before I left her that she would not try it again
  until there was no other way.</p>

  <p>As I walked slowly homeward my thoughts were filled with bitterness and
  sorrow. My soul was in revolt against this cruel social order that even
  robbed youth of happiness and love. Although I had seen but little of either
  something within me&mdash;some inherent instinct I suspect&mdash;cried aloud
  that these were my birthright and that I was being robbed of them by the
  spawn of lunar interlopers. My Americanism was very strong in
  me&mdash;stronger, perhaps, because of the century old effort of our
  oppressors to crush it and because always we must suppress any outward
  evidence of it. They called us Yanks in contempt; but the appellation was our
  pride. And we, in turn, often spoke of them as kaisers; but not to their
  faces. Father says that in ancient times the word had the loftiest of
  meanings; but now it has the lowest.</p>

  <p>As I approached the house I saw that the candle was still burning in the
  living room. I had left so hurriedly that I had given it no thought, and as I
  came closer I saw something else, too. I was walking very slowly and in the
  soft dust of the pathway my soft boots made no sound, or I might not have
  seen what I did see&mdash;two figures, close in the shadow of the wall,
  peering through one of our little windows into the living room.</p>

  <p>I crept stealthily forward until I was close enough to see that one was in
  the uniform of a Kash Guard while the other was clothed as are those of my
  class. In the latter I recognized the stoop shouldered, lanky figure of Peter
  Johansen. I was not at all surprised at this confirmation of my
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>I knew what they were there for&mdash;hoping to learn the secret hiding
  place of the Flag&mdash;but I also knew that unless they already knew it
  there was no danger of their discovering it from the outside, since it had
  been removed from its hiding place but once in my lifetime that I knew of and
  might never again be, especially since we knew that we were suspected. So I
  hid and watched them for a while and then circled the house and entered from
  the front as though I did not know that they were there, for it would never
  do to let them know that they had been discovered.</p>

  <p>Taking off my clothes I went to bed, after putting out the candle. I do
  not know how long they remained&mdash;it was enough to know that we were
  being watched, and though it was not pleasant I was glad that we were
  forewarned. In the morning I told father and mother what I had seen. Mother
  sighed and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is coming," she said. "I always knew that sooner or later it would
  come. One by one they get us&mdash;now it is our turn."</p>

  <p>Father said nothing. He finished his breakfast in silence and when he left
  the house he walked with his eyes upon the ground, his shoulders stooped and
  his chin upon his breast&mdash;slowly, almost unsteadily, he walked, like a
  man whose heart and spirit are both broken.</p>

  <p>I saw mother choke back a sob as she watched him go and I went and put my
  arm about her.</p>

  <p>"I fear for him, Julian," she said. "A spirit such as his suffers terribly
  the stings of injustice and degradation. Some of the others do not seem to
  take it so to heart as he; but he is a proud man of a proud line. I am
  afraid&mdash;" she paused as though fearing even to voice her fears&mdash;"I
  am afraid that he will do away with himself."</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "he is too brave a man for that. This will all blow
  over&mdash;they only suspect&mdash;they do not know, and we shall be careful
  and then all will be right again&mdash;as right as anything ever is in this
  world."</p>

  <p>"But Or-tis?" she questioned. "It will not be right until he has his
  will."</p>

  <p>I knew that she meant Juana.</p>

  <p>"He will never have his will," I said. "Am I not here?"</p>

  <p>She smiled indulgently. "You are very strong, my boy," she said; "but what
  are two brawny arms against the Kash Guard?"</p>

  <p>"They would be enough for Or-tis," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You would kill him?" she whispered. "They would tear you to pieces!"</p>

  <p>"They can tear me to pieces but once."</p>

  <p>It was market day and I went in with a few wethers, some hides and cheese.
  Father did not come along&mdash;in fact, I advised him not to as Soor would
  be there and also Hoffmeyer. One cheese I took as tribute to Soor. God, how I
  hated to do it! But both mother and father thought it best to propitiate the
  fellow, and I suppose they were right. A lifetime of suffering does not
  incline one to seek further trouble.</p>

  <p>The market place was full, for I was a little late. There were many Kash
  Guards in evidence&mdash;more than usual. It was a warm day&mdash;the first
  really warm day we had had&mdash;and a number of men were sitting beneath a
  canopy at one side of the market place in front of Hoffmeyer's office. As I
  approached I saw that Or-tis was there, as well as Pthav, the coal baron, and
  Hoffmeyer, of course, with several others including some Kalkar women and
  children.</p>

  <p>I recognized Pthav's woman&mdash;a renegade Yank who had gone to him
  willingly&mdash;and their little child, a girl of about six. The latter was
  playing in the dust in front of the canopy some hundred feet from the group,
  and I had scarcely recognized her when I saw that which made my heart almost
  stop beating for an instant.</p>

  <p>Two men were driving a small bunch of cattle into the market place upon
  the other side of the canopy, when suddenly I saw one of the creatures, a
  great bull, break away from the herd and with lowered head charge toward the
  tiny figure playing, unconscious of danger in the dust. The men tried to head
  the beast off, but their efforts were futile. Those under the canopy saw the
  child's danger at the same time that I did and they rose and cried aloud in
  warning. Pthav's woman shrieked and Or-tis yelled lustily for the Kash Guard;
  but none hastened in the path of the infuriated beast to the rescue of the
  child.</p>

  <p>I was the closest to her and the moment that I saw her danger I started
  forward; but even as I ran there passed through my brain some terrible
  thoughts. She is Kalkar! She is the spawn of the beast Pthav and of the woman
  who turned traitor to her kind to win ease and comfort and safety! Many a
  little life has been snuffed out because of her father and his class! Would
  they save a sister or a daughter of mine?</p>

  <p>I thought all these things as I ran; but I did not stop
  running&mdash;something within impelled me to her aid. It must have been
  simply that she was a little child and I the descendant of American
  gentlemen. No, I kept right on in the face of the fact that my sense of
  justice cried out that I let the child die.</p>

  <p>I reached her just a moment before the bull did and when he saw me there
  between him and the child he stopped and with his head down he pawed the
  earth, throwing clouds of dust about, and bellowed&mdash;and then he came for
  me; but I met him half way, determined to hold him off until the child
  escaped if it were humanly possible for me to do so. He was a huge beast and
  quite evidently a vicious one, which possibly explained the reason for
  bringing him to market, and altogether it seemed to me that he would make
  short work of me; but I meant to die fighting.</p>

  <p>I called to the little girl to run and then the bull and I came together.
  I seized his horns as he attempted to toss me, and I exerted all the strength
  in my young body. I had thought that I had let the Hellhounds feel it all
  that other night; but now I knew that I had yet more in reserve, for to my
  astonishment I held that great beast and slowly, very slowly, I commenced to
  twist his head to the left.</p>

  <p>He struggled and fought and bellowed&mdash;I could feel the muscles of my
  back and arms and legs hardening to the strain that was put upon them; but
  almost from the first instant I knew that I was master. The Kash Guards were
  coming now on the run, and I could hear Or-tis shouting to them to shoot the
  bull; but before they reached me I gave the animal a final mighty wrench so
  that he went first down upon one knee and then over on his side and there I
  held him until a sergeant came and put a bullet through his head.</p>

  <p>When he was quite dead Or-tis and Pthav and the others approached. I saw
  them coming as I was returning to my wethers, my skins and my cheese. Or-tis
  called to me and I turned and stood looking at him as I had no mind to have
  any business with any of them that I could avoid.</p>

  <p>"Come here, my man," he called.</p>

  <p>I moved sullenly toward him a few paces and stopped again.</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" He was eying me closely now. "I never saw such strength in
  any man. You should be in the Kash Guard. How would you like that?"</p>

  <p>"I would not like it," I replied. It was about then, I guess, that he
  recognized me, for his eyes hardened. "No," he said, "we do not want such as
  you among loyal men." He turned upon his heel; but immediately wheeled toward
  me again.</p>

  <p>"See to it, young man," he snapped, "that you use that strength of yours
  wisely and in good causes."</p>

  <p>"I shall use it wisely," I replied, "and in the best of causes."</p>

  <p>I think Pthav's woman had intended to thank me for saving her child, and
  perhaps Pthav had, too, for they had both come toward me; but when they saw
  Ortis's evident hostility toward me they turned away, for which I was
  thankful. I saw Soor looking on with a sneer on his lips and Hoffmeyer eying
  me with that cunning expression of his.</p>

  <p>I gathered up my produce and proceeded to that part of the market place
  where we habitually showed that which we had to sell, only to find that a man
  named Vonbulen was there ahead of me. Now there is an unwritten law that each
  family has its own place in the market. I was the third generation of Julians
  who had brought produce to this spot&mdash;formerly horses mostly, for we
  were a family of horsemen; but more recently goats since the government had
  taken over the horse industry. Though father and I still broke horses
  occasionally for the Twenty-Four, we did not own or raise them any more.</p>

  <p>Vonbulen had had a little pen in a far corner, where trade was not so
  brisk as it usually was in our section, and I could not understand what he
  was doing in ours, where he had three or four scrub pigs and a few sacks of
  grain. Approaching, I asked him why he was there.</p>

  <p>"This is my pen now," he said. "Tax collector Soor told me to use it."</p>

  <p>"You will get out of it," I replied. "You know that it is ours&mdash;every
  one in the Teivos knows that it is and has been for many years. My
  grandfather built it and my family have kept it in repair. You will get
  out!"</p>

  <p>"I will not get out," he replied truculently. He was a very large man and
  when he was angry he looked quite fierce, as he had large mustaches which he
  brushed upward on either side of his nose&mdash;like the tusks of one of his
  boars.</p>

  <p>"You will get out or be thrown out," I told him; but he put his hand on
  the gate and attempted to bar my entrance.</p>

  <p>Knowing him to be heavy minded and stupid I thought to take him by
  surprise, nor did I fail as, with a hand upon the topmost rail, I vaulted the
  gate full in his face, and letting my knees strike his chest, I sent him
  tumbling backward into the filth of his swine. So hard I struck him that he
  turned a complete back somersault and as he scrambled to his feet, his lips
  fouled with oaths, I saw murder in his eye. And how he charged me! It was for
  all the world like the charge of the great bull I had just vanquished except
  that I think that Vonbulen was angrier than the bull and not so good
  looking.</p>

  <p>His great fists were flailing about in a most terrifying manner and his
  mouth was open just as though he intended eating me alive; but for some
  reason I felt no fear. In fact, I had to smile to see his face and his fierce
  mustache smeared with dirt.</p>

  <p>I parried his first wild blows and then stepping in close I struck him
  lightly in the face&mdash;I am sure I did not strike him hard, for I did not
  mean to&mdash;I wanted to play with him; but the result was as astonishing to
  me as it must have been to him, though not so painful. He rebounded from my
  fist fully, three feet and then went over on his back again, spitting blood
  and teeth from his mouth.</p>

  <p>And then I picked him up by the scruff of his neck and the seat of his
  breeches, and lifting him high above my head, I hurled him out of the pen
  into the market place where, for the first time, I saw a large crowd of
  interested spectators.</p>

  <p>Vonbulen was not a popular character in the Teivos, and many were the
  broad smiles I saw on the faces of those of my class; but there were others
  who did not smile. They were Kalkars and half breeds.</p>

  <p>I saw all this in a single glance and then I returned to my work, for I
  was not through. Vonbulen lay where he had alighted and after him and onto
  him, one by one, I threw his sacks of grain and his scrub pigs and then I
  opened the gate and started out to bring in my own produce and live stock. As
  I did so I almost ran into Soor, standing there eying me with a most
  malignant expression upon his face.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he fairly screamed at me.</p>

  <p>"It means," I replied, "that no one can steal the place of a Julian as
  easily as Vonbulen thought."</p>

  <p>"He did not steal it," yelled Soor. "I gave it to him. Get out! It is
  his."</p>

  <p>"It is not yours to give," I replied. "I know my rights and no man shall
  take them from me without a fight. Do you understand me?"</p>

  <p>And then I brushed by him without another glance and drove my wethers into
  the pen. As I did so I saw that no one was smiling any more&mdash;my friends
  looked very glum and very frightened; but a man came up from my right and
  stood by my side, facing Soor, and when I turned my eyes in his direction I
  saw that it was Jim.</p>

  <p>Then I realized how serious my act must have seemed, and I was sorry that
  Jim had come and thus silently announced that he stood with me in what I had
  done. No others came, although there were many who hated the Kalkars fully as
  much as we.</p>

  <p>Soor was furious; but he could not stop me. Only the Twenty-Four could
  take the pen away from me. He called me names and threatened me; but I
  noticed that he waited until he had walked a short distance away before he
  did so. It was as food to a starving man to know that even one of our
  oppressors feared me. So far this had been the happiest day of my life.</p>

  <p>I hurriedly got the goats into the pen and then, with one of the cheeses
  in my hand, I called to Soor. He turned to see what I wanted, showing his
  teeth like a rat at bay.</p>

  <p>"You told my father to bring you a present," I yelled at the top of my
  lungs, so that all about in every direction heard and turned toward us. "Here
  it is!" I cried. "Here is your bribe!" and I hurled the cheese with all my
  strength full in his face.</p>

  <p>He went down like a felled ox and the people scattered like frightened
  rabbits. Then I went back into the pen and started to open and arrange my
  hides across the fence so that they might be inspected by prospective
  purchasers.</p>

  <p>Jim, whose pen was next to ours, stood looking across the fence at me for
  several minutes. At last he spoke:</p>

  <p>"You have done a very rash thing, Julian," he said, and then: "I envy
  you."</p>

  <p>It was not quite plain what he meant and yet I guessed that he, too, would
  have been willing to die for the satisfaction of having defied them. I had
  not done this thing merely in the heat of anger or the pride of strength; but
  from the memory of my father's bowed head and my mother's tears&mdash;in the
  realization that we were better dead than alive unless we could hold our
  heads aloft as men should. Yes, I still saw my father's chin upon his breast
  and his unsteady gait and I was ashamed for him and for myself; but I had
  partially washed away the stain and there had finally crystallized in my
  brain something that must have been forming long in solution there&mdash;the
  determination to walk through the balance of my life with my head up and my
  fists ready&mdash;a man&mdash;however short my walk might be.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">VI. &mdash; THE COURT MARTIAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT afternoon I saw a small detachment of the Kash Guard
  crossing the market place. They came directly toward my pen and stopped
  before it. The sergeant in charge addressed me: "You are Brother Julian 9th?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Julian 9th," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You had better be Brother Julian 9th when you are addressed by Brother
  General Or-tis," he snapped back. "You are under arrest&mdash;come with
  me!"</p>

  <p>"What for?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Brother Or-tis will tell you if you do not know&mdash;you are to be taken
  to him."</p>

  <p>So! It had come and it had come quickly. I felt sorry for mother; but, in
  a way, I was glad. If only there had been no such person in the world as
  Juana St. John I should have been almost happy, for I knew mother and father
  would come soon and, as she always taught me, we would be reunited in a happy
  world on the other side&mdash;a world in which there were no Kalkars or
  taxes&mdash;but then there was a Juana St. John and I was very sure of this
  world, while not quite so sure of the other, which I had never seen, nor any
  one who had.</p>

  <p>There seemed no particular reason for refusing to accompany the Kash
  Guard. They would simply have killed me with their bullets and if I went I
  might have an opportunity to wipe out some more important swine, than they,
  before I was killed&mdash;if they intended killing me. One never knows what
  they will do&mdash;other than that it will be the wrong thing.</p>

  <p>Well, they took me to the headquarters of the Teivos, way down on the
  shore of the lake; but as they took me in a large wagon drawn by horses it
  was not a tiresome trip and, as I was not worrying, I enjoyed it. We passed
  through many market places, for numerous districts lie between ours and
  headquarters, and always the people stared at me, just as I had stared at
  other prisoners being carted away to no one knew what fate. Sometimes they
  came back&mdash;sometimes they did not. I wondered which I would do.</p>

  <p>At last we arrived at headquarters after passing through miles of lofty
  ruins where I had played and explored as a child. I was taken immediately
  into Or-tis's presence. He sat in a large room at the head of a long table,
  and I saw that there were other men sitting along the sides of the table, the
  local representatives of that hated authority known as the Twenty-Four, the
  form of government that the Kalkars had brought with them from the moon a
  century before. The Twenty-Four originally consisted of a committee of that
  number. Now, however, it was but a name that stood for power, for government
  and for tyranny. Jarth the Jemadar was, in reality, what his lunar title
  indicated&mdash;emperor. Surrounding him was a committee of Twenty-Four
  Kalkars; but as they had been appointed by him and could be removed by him at
  will, they were nothing more than his tools. And this body before which I had
  been haled had in our Teivos the same power as the Twenty-Four which gave it
  birth, and so we spoke of it, too, as the Twenty-Four, or as the Teivos, as I
  at first thought it to be.</p>

  <p>Many of these men I recognized as members of the Teivos. Pthav and
  Hoffmeyer were there, representing our district, or misrepresenting it, as
  father always put it, yet I was presently sure that this could not be a
  meeting of the Teivos proper, as these were held in another building father
  south&mdash;a magnificent pillared pile of olden tunes that the government
  had partially restored as they had the headquarters, which also had been a
  beautiful building in a past age, its great lions still standing on either
  side of its broad entranceway.</p>

  <p>No, it was not the Teivos; but what could it be, and then it dawned upon
  me that it must be an arm of the new law that Or-tis had announced, and such
  it proved to be&mdash;a special military tribunal for special offenders. This
  was the first session and it chanced to be my luck that I committed my
  indiscretion just in time to be haled before it when it needed someone to
  experiment on.</p>

  <p>I was made to stand, under guard, at the foot of the table and as I looked
  up and down the rows of faces on either side I saw not a friendly
  eye&mdash;no person of my class or race&mdash;just swine, swine, swine.
  Low-browed, brute-faced men, slouching in their chairs, slovenly in their
  dress, uncouth, unwashed, unwholesome looking&mdash;this was the personnel of
  the court that was to try me&mdash;for what?</p>

  <p>Or-tis asked who appeared against me and what was the charge. Then I saw
  Soor for the first time. He should have been in his district collecting his
  taxes; but he wasn't. No, he was there on more pleasant business. He eyed me
  malevolently and stated the charge: resisting an officer of the law in the
  discharge of his duty and assaulting same with a deadly weapon with intent to
  commit murder.</p>

  <p>They all looked ferociously at me, expecting, no doubt, that I would
  tremble with terror, as most of my class did before them; but I couldn't
  tremble&mdash;the charge struck me as so ridiculous. As a matter of fact, I
  am afraid that I grinned. I know I did.</p>

  <p>"What is it," asked Or-tis, "that amuses you so?"</p>

  <p>"The charge," I replied.</p>

  <p>"What is there funny about that?" he asked again. "Men have been shot for
  less&mdash;men who were not suspected of treasonable acts."</p>

  <p>"I did not resist an officer in the discharge of his duty," I said. "It is
  not one of a tax collector's duties to put a family out of its pen at the
  market place, is it?&mdash;a pen they have occupied for three generations. I
  ask you, Or-tis, is it?"</p>

  <p>Or-tis half rose from his chair. "How dare you address me thus?" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>The others turned scowling faces upon me and, beating the table with their
  dirty fists, they all shouted and bellowed at me at once; but I kept my chin
  up as I had sworn to do until I died.</p>

  <p>Finally they quieted down and again I put my question to Or-tis and I'll
  give him credit for answering it fairly. "No," he said, "only the Teivos may
  do that&mdash;the Teivos or the commandant."</p>

  <p>"Then I did not resist an officer in the discharge of his duty," I shot
  back at them, "for I only refused to leave the pen that is mine. And now
  another question: Is a cheese a deadly weapon?"</p>

  <p>They had to admit that it was not. "He demanded a present from my father,"
  I explained, "and I brought him a cheese. He had no right under the law to
  demand it, and so I threw it at him and it hit him in the face. I shall
  deliver thus every such illegal tithe that is demanded of us. I have my
  rights under the law and I intend to see that they are respected."</p>

  <p>They had never been talked to thus before and suddenly I realized that by
  merest chance I had stumbled upon the only way in which to meet these
  creatures. They were moral as well as physical cowards. They could not face
  an honest, fearless man&mdash;already they were showing signs of
  embarrassment. They knew that I was right and while they could have condemned
  me had I bowed the knee to them they hadn't the courage to do it in my
  presence.</p>

  <p>The natural outcome was that they sought a scapegoat, and Or-tis was not
  long in finding one&mdash;his baleful eye alighted upon Soor.</p>

  <p>"Does this man speak the truth?" he cried at the tax collector. "Did you
  turn him out of his pen? Did he do no more than throw a cheese at you?"</p>

  <p>Soor, a coward before those in authority over him, flushed and
  stammered.</p>

  <p>"He tried to kill me," he mumbled lamely, "and he did almost kill Brother
  Vonbulen."</p>

  <p>Then I told them of that&mdash;and always I spoke in a tone of authority
  and I held my ground. I did not fear them and they knew it. Sometimes I think
  they attributed it to some knowledge I had of something that might be
  menacing them&mdash;for they were always afraid of revolution. That is why
  they ground us down so.</p>

  <p>The outcome of it was that I was let go with a warning&mdash;a warning
  that if I did not address my fellows as brother I would be punished, and even
  then I gave the parting shot, for I told them I would call no man brother
  unless he was.</p>

  <p>The whole affair was a farce; but all trials were farces, only, as a rule,
  the joke was on the accused. They were not conducted in a dignified or proper
  manner as I imagine trials in ancient times to have been. There was neither
  order nor system.</p>

  <p>I had to walk all the way home&mdash;another manifestation of
  justice&mdash;and I arrived there an hour or two after supper time. I found
  Jim and Mollie and Juana at the house, and I could see that mother had been
  crying. She started again when she saw me. Poor mother! I wonder if it has
  always been such a terrible thing to be a mother; but, no, it cannot have
  been, else the human race would long since have been extinct&mdash;as the
  Kalkars will rapidly make it, anyway.</p>

  <p>Jim had told them of the happenings in the market place&mdash;the episode
  of the bull, the encounter with Vonbulen and the matter of Soor. For the
  first time in my life, and the only time, I heard my father laugh aloud.
  Juana laughed, too; but there was still an undercurrent of terror that I
  could feel and which Mollie finally voiced.</p>

  <p>"They will get us yet, Julian," she said; "but what you have done is worth
  dying for."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried my father. "I can go to the butcher with a smile on my lips
  after this. He has done what I always wanted to do; but dared not. If I am a
  coward I can at least thank God that there sprang from my loins a brave and
  fearless man."</p>

  <p>"You are not a coward!" I cried, and mother looked at me and smiled. I was
  glad that I said that, then.</p>

  <p>You may not understand what father meant by "going to the butcher," but it
  is simple. The manufacture of ammunition is a lost art&mdash;that is, the
  high-powered ammunition that the Kash Guard likes to use&mdash;and so they
  conserve all the vast stores of ammunition that were handed down from ancient
  times&mdash;millions upon millions of rounds&mdash;or they would not be able
  to use the rifles that were handed down with the ammunition. They use this
  ammunition only in cases of dire necessity, a fact which long ago placed the
  firing squad of old in the same class with flying machines and automobiles.
  Now they cut our throats when they kill us and the man who does it is known
  as the butcher.</p>

  <p>I walked home with Jim and Mollie and Juana; but more especially Juana.
  Again I noticed that strange magnetic force which drew me to her, so that I
  kept bumping into her every step or two, and, intentionally, I swung my arm
  that was nearest to her in the hope that my hand might touch hers, nor was I
  doomed to disappointment and at every touch I thrilled. I could not but
  notice that Juana made no mention of my clumsiness, nor did she appear to
  attempt to prevent our contact; but yet I was afraid of her&mdash;afraid that
  she would notice and afraid that she would not. I am good with horses and
  goats and Hellhounds; but I am not much good with girls.</p>

  <p>We had talked upon many subjects and I knew her views and beliefs and she
  knew mine, so when we parted and I asked her if she would go with me on the
  morrow, which was the first Sunday of the month, she knew what I meant. She
  said that she would, and I went home very happy, for I knew that she and I
  were going to defy the common enemy side by side&mdash;that hand in hand we
  would face the Grim Reaper for the sake of the greatest cause on earth.</p>

  <p>On the way home I overtook Peter Johansen going in the direction of our
  home. I could see that he had no mind to meet me and he immediately fell to
  explaining lengthily why he was out at night, for the first thing I did was
  to ask him what strange business took him abroad so often lately after the
  sun had set.</p>

  <p>I could see him flush even in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Why," he exclaimed, "this is the first time in months that I have gone
  out after supper," and then something about the man made me lose my temper
  and I blurted out what was in my heart.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" I cried. "You lie, you damned spy!"</p>

  <p>And then Peter Johansen went white and, suddenly whipping a knife from his
  clothes, he leaped at me, striking wildly for any part of me that the blade
  might reach. At first he almost got me, so unexpected and so venomous was the
  attack; but though I was struck twice on the arm and cut a little I managed
  to ward the point from any vital part, and in a moment I had seized his knife
  wrist. That was the end&mdash;I just twisted it a little&mdash;I did not mean
  to twist hard&mdash;and something snapped inside his wrist.</p>

  <p>Peter let out an awful scream, his knife dropped from his fingers, and I
  pushed him from me and gave him a good kick as he was leaving&mdash;a kick
  that I think he will remember for some time. Then I picked up his knife and
  hurled it as far as I could in the direction of the river, where I think it
  landed, and went on my way toward home&mdash;whistling.</p>

  <p>When I entered the house mother came out of her room and, putting her arms
  about my neck, she clung closely to me.</p>

  <p>"Dear boy," she murmured, "I am so happy, because you are happy. She is a
  dear girl, and I love her as much as you do."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" I asked. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I heard you whistling," she said, "and I knew what it meant&mdash;grown
  men whistle but once in their lives."</p>

  <p>I picked her up in my arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother, dear!" I cried. "I wish it were true and maybe it will be
  some day&mdash;if I am not too much of a coward; but not yet."</p>

  <p>"Then why were you whistling?" she asked, surprised and a bit skeptical,
  too, I imagine.</p>

  <p>"I whistled," I explained, "because I just broke the wrist of a spy and
  kicked him across the road."</p>

  <p>"Peter?" she asked, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mother, Peter. I called him a spy and he tried to knife me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my son!" she cried. "You did not know. It is my fault, I should have
  told you. Now he will fight no more in the dark; but will come out in the
  open and when he does that I am lost."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not mind dying," she said; "but they will take your father first,
  because of me."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I can understand nothing of what you are driving
  at."</p>

  <p>"Then listen," she said. "Peter wants me. That is the reason he is spying
  on your father. If he can prove something against him and father is taken to
  the mines or killed, Peter will claim me."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Peter himself has told me that he wants me. He tried to make me leave
  your dear father and go with him, and when I refused he bragged that he was
  in the favor of the Kalkars and that he would get me in the end. He has tried
  to buy my honor with your father's life. That is why I have been so afraid
  and so unhappy; but I knew that you and father would rather die than have me
  do that thing, and so I have withstood him."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell father?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I dared not. He would have killed Peter and that would have been the end
  of us, for Peter stands high in the graces of the authorities."</p>

  <p>"I will kill him!" I said.</p>

  <p>She tried to dissuade me, and finally I had to promise her that I would
  wait until I had provocation that the authorities might recognize. God knows
  I had provocation enough, though.</p>

  <p>After breakfast the next day we set out singly and in different
  directions, as was always our custom on the first Sunday in each month. I
  went to Jim's first to get Juana as she did not know the way, having never
  been with us. I found her ready and waiting and alone, as Jim and Mollie had
  started a few minutes before, and seemingly very glad to see me.</p>

  <p>I told her nothing of Peter, as there is enough trouble in the world
  without burdening people with any that does not directly threaten them. I led
  her up the river for a mile and all the while we watched to see if we were
  followed. Then we found a skiff, where I had hidden it, and crossed the
  river. After hiding it again we continued on up for half a mile. Here was a
  raft that I had made myself, and on this we poled again to the other
  shore&mdash;if any followed us they must have swum, for there were no other
  boats on this part of the river.</p>

  <p>I had come this way for several years&mdash;in fact, ever since I was
  fifteen years old&mdash;and no one had ever suspected or followed me, yet I
  never relaxed my vigilance, which may account for the fact that I was not
  apprehended. No one ever saw me take to either the skiff or the raft and no
  one could even have guessed my destination, so circuitous was the way.</p>

  <p>A mile west of the river is a thick forest of very old trees and toward
  this I led Juana. At its verge we sat down, ostensibly to rest; but really to
  see if any one was near who might have followed us or who could accidentally
  discover our next move. There was no one in sight, and so, with light hearts,
  we arose and entered the forest.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of a mile we made our way along a winding path and then I
  turned to the left at a right angle and entered thick brush where there was
  no trail. Always we did this, never covering the last quarter of a mile over
  the same route, lest we make a path that might be marked and followed.</p>

  <p>Presently we came to a pile of brush wood, beneath one edge of which was
  an opening into which, by stooping low, one might enter. It was screened from
  view by a fallen tree, over which had been heaped broken branches. Even in
  winter time and early spring the opening in the brush beyond was invisible to
  the passers-by, if there had been any passers-by. A man trailing lost stock
  might come this way; but no others, for it was a lonely and unfrequented
  spot. During the summer, the season of the year when there was the greatest
  danger of discovery, the entire brush pile and its tangled screen were hidden
  completely beneath a mass of wild vines, so that it was with difficulty that
  we found it ourselves.</p>

  <p>Into this opening I led Juana&mdash;taking her by the hand as one might a
  blind person, although it was not so dark within that she could not see
  perfectly every step she took. However, I took her by the hand, a poor excuse
  being better than none. The winding tunnel beneath the brush was a hundred
  yards long, perhaps&mdash;I wished then that it had been a hundred miles. It
  ended abruptly before a rough stone wall in which was a heavy door. Its oaken
  panels were black with age and streaked with green from the massive hinges
  that ran across its entire width in three places, while from the great lag
  screws that fastened them to the door brownish streaks of rust ran down to
  mingle with the green and the black. In patches moss grew upon it, so that
  all in all it had the appearance of great antiquity, though even the oldest
  among those who knew of it at all could only guess at its age. Above the
  door, carved in the stone, was a shepherd's crook and the words, <i>Dieu et
  mon droit</i>.</p>

  <p>Halting before this massive portal I struck the panels once with my
  knuckles, counted five and struck again, once; then I counted three and, in
  the same cadence, struck three times. It was the signal for the
  day&mdash;never twice was it the same. Should one come with the wrong signal
  and later force the door he would find only an empty room beyond.</p>

  <p>Now the door opened a crack and an eye peered forth, then it swung outward
  and we entered a long, low room lighted by burning wicks floating in oil.
  Across the width of the room were rough wooden benches and at the far end a
  raised platform upon which stood Orrin Colby, the blacksmith, behind an altar
  which was the sawn off trunk of a tree, the roots of which, legend has it,
  still run down into the ground beneath the church, which is supposed to have
  been built around it.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">VII. &mdash; BETRAYED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were twelve people sitting on the benches when we
  entered, so that with Orrin Colby, ourselves and the man at the door we were
  sixteen in all. Colby is the head of our church; his great grandfather was a
  Methodist minister. Father and mother were there, sitting next to Jim and
  Mollie, and there were Samuels the Jew, Betty Worth, who was Dennis
  Corrigan's woman, and all the other familiar faces.</p>

  <p>They had been waiting for us and as soon as we were seated the services
  commenced with a prayer, every one standing with bowed head. Orrin Colby
  always delivered this same short prayer at the opening of services each first
  Sunday of every month. It ran something like this:</p>

  <p>"God of our fathers, through generations of persecution and cruelty in a
  world of hate that has turned against You, we stand at Your right hand, loyal
  to You and to our Flag. To us Your name stands for justice, humanity, love,
  happiness and right, and the Flag is Your emblem. Once each month we risk our
  lives that Your name may not perish from the earth. Amen!"</p>

  <p>From behind the altar he took a shepherd's crook to which was attached a
  flag like that in my father's possession and held it aloft, whereat we all
  knelt in silence for a few seconds. Then he replaced it and we arose. Then we
  sang a song&mdash;it was an old, old song that started like this: "Onward,
  Christian Soldiers." It was my favorite song. Mollie Sheehan played a violin
  while we sang.</p>

  <p>Following the song Orrin Colby talked to us&mdash;he always talked about
  the practical things that affected our lives and our future. It was a homely
  talk, but it was full of hope for better times. I think that at these
  meetings, once each month, we heard the only suggestions of hope that ever
  came into our lives. There was something about Orrin Colby that inspired
  confidence and hope. These days were the bright spots in our drab
  existence.</p>

  <p>After the talk we sang again and then Samuels the Jew prayed and the
  regular service was over, after which we had short talks by various members
  of our church. These talks were mostly on the subject which dominated the
  minds of all&mdash;a revolution but we never got any further than talking.
  How could we? We were probably the most thoroughly subjugated people the
  world ever had known&mdash;we feared our masters and we feared our neighbors.
  We did not know whom we might trust, outside that little coterie of ours, and
  so we dared not seek recruits for our cause, although we knew that there must
  be thousands who would sympathize with us. Spies and informers were
  everywhere&mdash;they, the Kash Guard and the butcher, were the agencies by
  which they controlled us; but of all we feared most the spies and informers.
  For a woman, for a neighbor's house, and in one instance of which I know, for
  a setting of eggs, men have been known to inform on their
  friends&mdash;sending them to the mines or the butcher.</p>

  <p>Following the talks we just visited together and gossiped for an hour or
  two, enjoying the rare treat of being able to speak our minds freely and
  fearlessly. I had to re-tell several times my experiences before Ortis's new
  court-martial and I know that it was with difficulty that they believed that
  I had said the things I had to our masters and come away free and alive. They
  simply could not understand it.</p>

  <p>All were warned of Peter Johansen and the names of others under suspicion
  of being informers were passed around that we might all be on our guard
  against them. We did not sing again, for even on these days that our hearts
  were lightest they were too heavy for song. About two o'clock the pass signal
  for the next meeting was given out and then we started away singly or in
  pairs. I volunteered to go last, with Juana, and see that the door was
  locked. An hour later we started out, about five minutes behind Samuels the
  Jew.</p>

  <p>Juana's mother had passed down to her by word of mouth an unusually
  complete religious training for those days and she, in turn, had transmitted
  it to Juana. It seemed that they, too, had had a church in their district;
  but that a short time before it had been discovered by the authorities and
  destroyed, though none of the members of the organization had been
  apprehended. So close a watch was kept thereafter that they had never dared
  seek another meeting place.</p>

  <p>She told me that their congregation was much like ours in personnel and
  with the knowledge she had of ancient religious customs it always seemed odd
  to her to see so different creeds worshiping under one roof in even greater
  harmony than many denominations of the same church knew in ancient times.
  Among us were descendants of Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic
  and Jew that I knew of and how many more I did not know, nor did any of us
  care.</p>

  <p>We worshiped an ideal and a great hope, both of which were all goodness,
  and we called these God. We did not care what our great-grandfathers thought
  about it or what some one a thousand years before had thought or done or what
  name they had given the Supreme Being, for we knew that there could be but
  one and whether we called Him one thing or another would not alter Him in any
  way. This much good, at least, the Kalkars had accomplished in the world; but
  it had come too late. Those who worshiped any god were becoming fewer and
  fewer. Our own congregation had fallen from twenty-two a year or so before to
  fifteen&mdash;until Juana made us sixteen.</p>

  <p>Some had died natural deaths and some had gone to the mines or the
  butcher; but the principal reason of our decadence was the fact that there
  were too few children to take the place of the adults who died&mdash;that and
  our fear to seek converts. We were dying out, there was no doubt of it, and
  with us was dying all religion. That was what the lunar theory was doing for
  the world; but it was only what any one might have expected. Intelligent men
  and women realized it from almost the instant that this lunar theory stuck
  its ugly head above our horizon&mdash;a political faith that would make all
  women the common property of all men could not by any remote possibility have
  respect, or even aught but fear, for any religion of ancient times, and the
  Kalkars did, just what any one might have known they would do&mdash;they
  deliberately and openly crushed all churches.</p>

  <p>Juana and I had emerged from the wood when we noticed a man walking
  cautiously in the shade of the trees ahead of us. He seemed to be following
  some one and immediately there sprang to my thoughts the ever near
  suspicion&mdash;spy.</p>

  <p>The moment that he turned a bend in the pathway and was out of our sight
  Juana and I ran forward as rapidly as we could go that we might get a closer
  view of him, nor were we disappointed. We saw him and recognized him and we
  also saw whom he shadowed. It was Peter Johansen, carrying one arm in a
  sling, sneaking along behind Samuels.</p>

  <p>I knew that if Peter was permitted to shadow Samuels home he would
  discover the devious way the old man followed and immediately, even though he
  had suspected nothing in particular before, he would know that Moses had been
  upon some errand that he didn't wish the authorities to learn of. That would
  mean suspicion for old Samuels and suspicion usually ended in conviction upon
  one charge or another. How far he had followed him we could not guess, but
  already we knew that it was much too near the church for safety. I was much
  perturbed.</p>

  <p>Casting about in my mind for some plan to throw Peter off the track I
  finally hit upon a scheme which I immediately put into execution. I knew the
  way that the old man followed to and from church and that presently he would
  make a wide detour that would bring him back to the river about a quarter of
  a mile below. Juana and I could walk straight to the spot and arrive long
  before Samuels did. And this we proceeded to do.</p>

  <p>About half an hour before we reached the point at which we knew he would
  strike the river, we heard him coming and withdrew into some bushes. On he
  came all oblivious of the creature on his trail and a moment later we saw
  Peter come into view and halt at the edge of the trees. Then Juana and I
  stepped out and hailed Samuels.</p>

  <p>"Did you see nothing of them?" I asked in a tone of voice loud enough to
  be distinctly heard by Peter, and then before Samuels could reply I added:
  "We have searched far up the river and never a sign of a goat about&mdash;I
  do not believe that they came this way after all; but if they did the
  Hellhounds will get them after dark. Come, now, we might as well start for
  home and give the search up as a bad job."</p>

  <p>I had talked so much and so rapidly that Samuels had guessed that I must
  have some reason for it, and so he held his peace, other than to say that he
  had seen nothing of any goats. Not once had Juana or I let our glances betray
  that we knew of Peter's presence, though I could not help but seeing him
  dodge behind a tree the moment that he saw us.</p>

  <p>The three of us then continued on toward home in the shortest direction
  and on the way I whispered to Samuels what we had seen. The old man chuckled,
  for he thought as I did that my ruse must have effectually baffled
  Johansen&mdash;unless he had followed Moses farther than we guessed. We each
  turned a little white as the consequences of such a possibility were borne
  home upon us. We did not want Peter to know that we even guessed that we were
  followed and so we never once looked behind us, not even Juana, which was
  remarkable for a woman, nor did we see him again, though we felt that he was
  following us. I for one was sure, though, that he was following at a safer
  distance since I had joined Samuels.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously during the ensuing week the word was passed around by
  means with which we were familiar that Johansen had followed Samuels from
  church; but as the authorities paid no more attention to Moses than before we
  finally concluded that we had thrown Peter off the trail.</p>

  <p>The Sunday following church we were all seated in Jim's yard under one of
  his trees that had already put forth its young leaves and afforded shade from
  the sun. We had been talking of homely things&mdash;the coming crops, the
  newborn kids, Mollie's little pigs. The world seemed unusually kindly. The
  authorities had not persecuted us of late. A respite of two weeks seemed like
  heaven to us. We were quite sure by this time that Peter Johansen had
  discovered nothing and our hearts were freer than for a long time past.</p>

  <p>We were sitting thus in quiet and contentment, enjoying a brief rest from
  our lives of drudgery, when we heard the pounding of horses' hoofs upon the
  hard earth of the path that leads down the river in the direction of the
  market place. Suddenly the entire atmosphere changed&mdash;relaxed nerves
  became suddenly taut; peaceful eyes resumed their hunted expression. Why? The
  Kash Guard rides.</p>

  <p>And so they came&mdash;fifty of them&mdash;and at their head rode Brother
  General Or-tis. At the gateway of Jim's house they drew rein and Or-tis
  dismounted and entered the yard. He looked at us as a man might look at
  carrion; and he gave us no greeting, which suited us perfectly. He walked
  straight to Juana, who was seated on a little bench beside which I stood
  leaning against the bole of the tree. None of us moved. He halted before the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I have come to tell you," he said to her, "that I have done you the honor
  to choose you as my woman, to bear my children and keep my house in
  order."</p>

  <p>He stood then looking at her and I could feel the hair upon my head rise
  and the corners of my upper lip twitched&mdash;I know not why. I only know
  that I wanted to fly at his throat and kill him, to tear his flesh with my
  teeth&mdash;to see him die! And then he looked at me and stepped back, after
  which he beckoned to some of his men to enter. When they had come he again
  addressed Juana, who had risen and stood swaying to and fro, as might one who
  has been dealt a heavy blow upon the head and half stunned.</p>

  <p>"You may come with me now," he said to her, and then I stepped between
  them and faced him and again he stepped back a pace.</p>

  <p>"She will not come with you now, or ever," I said, and my voice was very
  low&mdash;not above a whisper. "She is my woman&mdash;I have taken her!"</p>

  <p>It was a lie&mdash;the last part, but what is a lie to a man who would
  commit murder in the same cause. He was among his men now&mdash;they were
  close around him and I suppose they gave him courage, for he addressed me
  threateningly.</p>

  <p>"I do not care whose she is," he cried, "I want her and I shall have her.
  I speak for her now and I speak for her when she is a widow. After you are
  dead I have first choice of her and traitors do not live long."</p>

  <p>"I am not dead yet," I reminded him. He turned to Juana.</p>

  <p>"You shall have thirty days as the law requires; but you can save your
  friends trouble if you come now&mdash;they will not be molested then and I
  will see that their taxes are lowered."</p>

  <p>Juana gave a little gasp and looked around at us and then she straightened
  her shoulders and came close to me.</p>

  <p>"No!" she said to Or-tis. "I will never go. This is my man&mdash;he has
  taken me. Ask him if he will give me up to you. You will never have
  me&mdash;alive."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure of that," he growled. "I believe that you are both
  lying to me, for I have had you watched and I know that you do not live under
  the same roof. And you!" he glared at me. "Tread carefully, for the eyes of
  the law find traitors where others do not see them." Then he turned and
  strode from the yard. A minute later they were gone in a cloud of dust.</p>

  <p>Now our happiness and peace had fled&mdash;it was always thus&mdash;and
  there was no hope. I dared not look at Juana after what I had said; but then,
  had she not said the same thing? We all talked lamely for a few minutes and
  then father and mother rose to go and a moment later Jim and Mollie went
  indoors.</p>

  <p>I turned to Juana. She stood with her eyes upon the ground and a pretty
  flush upon her cheek. Something surged up in me&mdash;a mighty force, that I
  had never known, possessed me, and before I realized what it impelled me to
  do I had seized Juana in my arms and was covering her face and lips with
  kisses.</p>

  <p>She fought to free herself, but I would not let her go.</p>

  <p>"You are mine!" I cried. "You are my woman. I have said it&mdash;you have
  said. You are my woman. God, how I love you!"</p>

  <p>She lay quiet then and let me kiss her, and presently her arms stole about
  my neck and her lips sought mine in an interval that I had drawn them away
  and they moved upon my lips in a gentle caress that was yet palpitant with
  passion. This was a new Juana&mdash;a new and very wonderful Juana.</p>

  <p>"You really love me?" she asked at last. "I heard you say it!"</p>

  <p>"I have loved you from the moment I saw you looking up at me from beneath
  the Hellhound," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You have kept it very much of a secret to yourself then," she teased me.
  "If you loved me so, why did you not tell me? Were you going to keep it from
  me all my life, or were you afraid? Brother Or-tis was not afraid to say that
  he wanted me. Is my man less brave than he?"</p>

  <p>I knew that she was only teasing me, and so I stopped her mouth with
  kisses and then: "Had you been a Hellhound, or Soor, or even Or-tis," I said,
  "I could have told you what I thought of you, but being Juana and a little
  girl the words would not come. I am a great coward."</p>

  <p>We talked until it was time to go home to supper and I took her hand to
  lead her to my house. "But first," I said, "you must tell Mollie and Jim what
  has happened and that you will not be back. For a while we can live, under my
  father's roof, but as soon as may be I will get permission from the Teivos to
  take the adjoining land and work it and then I shall build a house."</p>

  <p>She drew back and flushed.</p>

  <p>"I cannot go with you yet," she said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked. "You are mine!"</p>

  <p>"We have not been married," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"But no one is married," I reminded her. "Marriage is against the
  law."</p>

  <p>"My mother was married," she told me. "You and I can be married. We have a
  church and a preacher. Why cannot he marry us? He is not ordained because
  there is none to ordain him; but being the head of the only church that he
  knows of or that we know of, it is evident that he can be ordained only by
  God and who knows but that He already has done so."</p>

  <p>I tried to argue her out of it as now that Heaven was so near I had no
  mind to wait three weeks to attain it. But she would not argue&mdash;she just
  shook her head and at last saw that she was right and gave in&mdash;as I
  would have had to do in any event.</p>

  <p>The next day I sought Orrin Colby and broached the subject to him. He was
  quite enthusiastic about it and wondered that they had never thought of it
  before. Of course, they had not because marriage had been obsolete for so
  many years that no one considered the ceremony necessary, nor, in fact, was
  it. Men and women were more often faithful to one another through life than
  otherwise&mdash;no amount of ceremony or ritual could make them more so. But
  if a woman wants it she should have it. And so it was arranged that at the
  next meeting Juana and I should be married.</p>

  <p>The next three weeks were about the longest of my life and yet they were
  very, very happy weeks, for Juana and I were much together, as it had finally
  been decided that in order to carry out our statements to Or-tis she must
  come and live under our roof. She slept in the living room and I upon a pile
  of goat skins in the kitchen. If there were any spies watching us, and I know
  that there were, they saw that we slept every night under the same roof.</p>

  <p>Mother worked hard upon a new tunic and breeches for me, while Mollie
  helped Juana with her outfit. The poor child had come to us with only the
  clothes she wore upon her back; but even so, most of us had few
  changes&mdash;just enough to keep ourselves decently clean.</p>

  <p>I went to Pthav, who was one of our representatives in the Teivos, and
  asked him to procure for me permission to work the vacant land adjoining my
  father's. The land all belonged to the community, but each man was allowed
  what he could work as long as there was plenty, and there was more than
  plenty for us all.</p>

  <p>Pthav was very ugly&mdash;he seemed to have forgotten that I had saved his
  child's life&mdash;and said that he did not know what he could do for me,
  that I had acted very badly to General Or-tis and was in disfavor, beside
  being under suspicion in another matter.</p>

  <p>"What has General Or-tis to do with the distribution of land by the
  Teivos?" I asked. "Because he wants my woman will the Teivos deny me my
  rights?"</p>

  <p>I was no longer afraid of any of them and I spoke my mind as freely as I
  wished&mdash;almost. Of course, I did not care to give them the chance to
  bring me to trial as they most assuredly would have done had I really said to
  them all that was in my heart, but I stood up for my rights and demanded all
  that their rotten laws allowed me.</p>

  <p>Pthav's woman came in while I was talking and recognized me, but she said
  nothing to me other than to mention that the child had asked for me. Pthav
  scowled at this and ordered her from the room, just as a man might order a
  beast around. It was nothing to me, though, as the woman was a renegade
  anyway.</p>

  <p>Finally I demanded of Pthav that he obtain the concession for me unless he
  could give me some valid reason for refusing.</p>

  <p>"I will ask it," he said finally, "but you will not get it&mdash;be sure
  of that."</p>

  <p>I saw that it was useless and so I turned and left the room, wondering
  what I should do. Of course, we could remain under father's roof, but that
  did not seem right, as each man should make a home for himself. After father
  and mother died we would return to the old place, as father had after the
  death of my grandfather, but a young couple should start their life together
  alone and in their own way.</p>

  <p>As I was leaving the house Pthav's woman stopped me. "I will do what I can
  for you," she whispered. She must have seen me draw away instinctively as
  from an unclean thing, for she flushed, and then said: "Please don't! I have
  suffered enough. I have paid the price of my treachery; but know, Yank," and
  she put her lips close to my ear, "that at heart I am more Yank than I was
  when I did this thing. And," she continued, "I have never spoken a word that
  could harm one of you. Tell them that&mdash;please tell them! I do not want
  them to hate me so, and, God of our Fathers! How I have suffered&mdash;the
  degradation, the humiliation. It has been worse than what you are made to
  suffer. These creatures are lower than the beasts of the forest. I could kill
  him if I were not such a coward. I have seen, and I know how they can make
  one suffer before death."</p>

  <p>I could not but feel sorry for her, and I told her so. The poor creature
  appeared very grateful, and assured me that she would aid me.</p>

  <p>"I know a few things about Pthav that he would not want Or-tis to know,"
  she said, "and even though he beats me for it I will make him get the land
  for you."</p>

  <p>Again I thanked her, and departed, realizing that there were others worse
  off than we&mdash;that the closer one came to the Kalkars the more hideous
  life became.</p>

  <p>At last the day came, and we set out for the church. As before I took
  Juana, though she tried to order it differently; but I would not trust her to
  the protection of another. We arrived without mishap&mdash;sixteen of
  us&mdash;and after the religious services were over, Juana and I stood before
  the altar, and were married&mdash;much after the fashion of the ancients, I
  imagine.</p>

  <p>Juana was the only one of us who was at all sure about the ceremony, and
  it had been she who trained Orrin Colby&mdash;making him memorize so much
  that he said his head ached for a week. All I can recall of it is that he
  asked me if I would take her to be my lawfully wedded wife&mdash;I lost my
  voice, and only squeaked a weak yes&mdash;and that he pronounced us man and
  wife, and then something about not letting any one put asunder what God had
  joined together. I felt very much married, and very happy, and then just as
  it was all nicely over, and everybody was shaking hands with us, there came a
  loud knocking at the door, and the command: "Open, in the name of the
  law!"</p>

  <p>We looked at one another and gasped. Orrin Colby put a finger to his lips
  for silence, and led the way toward the back of the church where a rough
  niche was built containing a few shelves upon which stood several rude
  candlesticks. We knew our parts, and followed him in silence, except one who
  went quickly about putting out the lights. All the time the pounding on the
  door became more insistent, and then we could hear the strokes of what must
  have been an ax beating at the panels. Finally a shot was fired through the
  heavy wood, and we knew it was the Kash Guard.</p>

  <p>Taking hold of the lower shelf Orrin pulled upward with all his strength
  with the result that all the shelving and woodwork to which it was attached
  slid upward revealing an opening beyond. Through this we filed, one by one,
  down a flight of stone steps into a dark tunnel. When the last man had passed
  I lowered the shelving to its former place.</p>

  <p>Then I turned, and followed the others, Juana's hand in mine. We groped
  our way for some little distance in the darkness of the tunnel until Orrin
  halted, and whispered to me to come to him. I went and stood at his side
  while he told me what I was to do. He had called upon me because I was the
  tallest, and the strongest of the men. Above us was a wooden trap. I was to
  lift this.</p>

  <p>It had not been moved for generations, and was very heavy with earth, and
  growing things above; but I put my shoulders to it, and it had to
  give&mdash;either it or the ground beneath my feet, and that could not give.
  At last I had it off, and in a few minutes I had helped them all out into the
  midst of a dense wood. Again we knew our parts, for many times had we been
  coached for just such an emergency, and one by one the men scattered in
  different directions.</p>

  <p>Suiting our movements to a prearranged plan, we reached our homes from
  different directions, and at different times, some arriving after sundown, to
  the end that were we watched none might be sure that we had been upon the
  same errand or to the same place.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE ARREST OF JULIAN 8TH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MOTHER had supper ready by the time Juana and I arrived.
  Father said they had seen nothing of the Kash Guard, nor had we; but we could
  guess at what had happened at the church. The door must finally have given
  into their blows. We could imagine their rage when they found that their prey
  had flown, leaving no trace. Even if they found the hidden tunnel, and we
  doubted that they had, the discovery would profit them but little. We were
  very sad, though, for we had lost our church. Never again in this generation
  could it be used. We added another mark to the growing score against
  Johansen.</p>

  <p>The next morning as I was peddling milk to those who live about the market
  place, Old Samuels came out of his little cottage, and hailed me.</p>

  <p>"A little milk this morning, Julian!" he cried, and when I carried my
  vessel over to him he asked me inside. His cottage was very small, and simply
  furnished as were all those that made any pretense to furniture of any sort,
  some having only a pile of rags or skins in one corner for a bed and perhaps
  a bench or two which answered the combined purposes of seats and table. In
  the yard behind his cottage he did his tanning, and there also was a little
  shed he called his shop where he fashioned various articles from the hides he
  tanned&mdash;belts, head bands, pouches, and the like.</p>

  <p>He led me through the cottage, and out to his shed, and when we were there
  he looked through the windows to see that no one was near.</p>

  <p>"I have something here," he said, "that I meant to bring to Juana for a
  wedding gift yesterday; but I am an old man, and forgetful, and so I left it
  behind. You can take it to her, though, with the best wishes of Old Samuels
  the Jew. It has been in my family since the Great War in which my people
  fought by the side of your people. One of my ancestors was wounded on a
  battlefield in France, and later nursed back to health by a Roman Catholic
  nurse, who gave him this token to carry away with him that he might not
  forget her. The story is that she loved him; but being a nun she could not
  marry. It has been handed down from father to son&mdash;it is my most prized
  possession, Julian; but being an old man, and the last of my line I wish it
  to go to those I love most dearly, for I doubt that I have long to live.
  Again yesterday, I was followed from the church."</p>

  <p>He turned to a little cupboard on the wall, and removing a false bottom
  took from the drawer beneath a small leather bag which he handed to me.</p>

  <p>"Look at it," he said, "and then slip it inside your shirt so that none
  may know that you have it."</p>

  <p>Opening the bag I brought forth a tiny image carved from what appeared to
  be very hard bone&mdash;the figure of a man nailed to a cross&mdash;a man
  with a wreath of thorns about his head. It was a very wonderful piece of
  work&mdash;I had never seen anything like it in my life.</p>

  <p>"It is very beautiful," I said. "Juana will be thankful, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what it is?" he asked, and I had to admit that I did not.</p>

  <p>"It is the figure of the Son of God upon the cross," he explained, "and it
  is carved from the tusk of an elephant. Juana will&mdash;" But he got no
  farther. "Quick!" he whispered, "hide it. Someone comes!"</p>

  <p>I slipped the little figure inside my shirt just as several men crossed
  from Samuels's cottage to his shop. They came directly to the door, and then
  we saw that they were Kash Guards. A captain commanded them. He was one of
  the officers who had come with Or-tis, and I did not know him.</p>

  <p>He looked first at me and then at Samuels, finally addressing the
  latter.</p>

  <p>"From the description," he said, "you are the man I want&mdash;you are
  Samuels the Jew?"</p>

  <p>Moses nodded affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"I have been sent to question you," said the officer, "and if you know
  when you are well off you will tell me nothing but the truth, and all of
  that."</p>

  <p>Moses made no reply&mdash;he just stood there, a little, dried&mdash;up
  old man who seemed to have shrunk to even smaller proportions in the brief
  moments since the officer had entered. Then the latter turned to me, and
  looked me over from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Julian 9th," I replied. "I was peddling milk when I stopped in to
  speak with my friend."</p>

  <p>"You should be more careful of your friends, young man," he snapped. "I
  had intended letting you go about your business; but now that you say you are
  a friend of his we will just keep you, too. Possibly you can help us."</p>

  <p>I didn't know what he wanted; but I knew that whatever it was he would get
  precious little help from Julian 9th. He turned to Moses.</p>

  <p>"Do not lie to me! You went to a forbidden meeting yesterday to worship
  some god, and plot against the Teivos. Four weeks ago you went to the same
  place. Who else was there yesterday?"</p>

  <p>Samuels looked the captain straight in the eye, and remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Answer me, you dirty Jew!" yelled the officer, "or I will find a way to
  make you. Who was there with you?"</p>

  <p>"I will not answer," said Samuels.</p>

  <p>The captain turned to a sergeant standing behind him. "Give him the first
  reason why he should answer," he directed.</p>

  <p>The sergeant, who carried his bayonet fixed to his rifle, lowered the
  point until it rested against Samuels's leg, and with a sudden jab ran it
  into the flesh. The old man cried out in pain, and staggered back against his
  little bench. I sprang forward, white with rage, and seizing the sergeant by
  the collar of his loose tunic hurled him across the shop. It was all done in
  less than a second, and then I found myself facing as many loaded rifles as
  could crowd into the little doorway. The captain had drawn his pistol, and
  levelled it at my head.</p>

  <p>They bound me, and sat me in a corner of the shop, and they were none too
  gentle in the way they did it, either. The captain was furious, and would
  have had me shot on the spot had not the sergeant whispered something to him.
  As it was he ordered the latter to search us both for weapons, and when they
  did so they discovered the little image on my person. At sight of it a sneer
  of triumph curled the lip of the officer.</p>

  <p>"So-ho!" he exclaimed. "Here is evidence enough. Now we know one at least
  who worships forbidden gods, and plots against the laws of his land!"</p>

  <p>"It is not his," said Samuels. "It is mine. He does not even know what it
  is. I was showing it to him when we heard you coming, and I told him to hide
  it in his shirt. It is just a curious relic that I was showing him."</p>

  <p>"Then you are the worshiper after all," said the captain.</p>

  <p>Old Samuels smiled a crooked smile. "Who ever heard of a Jew worshiping
  Christ?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The officer looked at him sharply. "That is right," he admitted, "you
  would not worship Christ; but you have been worshiping something&mdash;it is
  all the same&mdash;they are all alike. This for all of them," and he hurled
  the image to the earthen floor, and ground it, in broken fragments, into the
  dirt with his heel.</p>

  <p>Old Samuels went very white then, and his eyes stared wide and round; but
  he held his tongue. Then they started in on him again, asking him to name
  those who were with him the day before, and each time they asked him they
  prodded him with a bayonet until his poor old body streamed blood from a
  dozen cruel wounds. But he would not give them a single name, and then the
  officer ordered that a fire be built and a bayonet heated.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes hot steel is better than cold," he said. "You had better tell
  me the truth."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you nothing," moaned Samuels in a weak voice. "You may kill
  me; but you will learn nothing from me."</p>

  <p>"But you have never felt red-hot steel before," the captain taunted him.
  "It has wrung the secrets from stouter hearts than that in the filthy carcass
  of a dirty old Jew. Come now, save yourself the agony, and tell me who was
  there, for in the end you will tell."</p>

  <p>But the old man would not tell, and then they did the hideous thing that
  they had threatened&mdash;with red-hot steel they burned him after tying him
  to his bench.</p>

  <p>His cries and moans were piteous&mdash;it seemed to me that they must have
  softened stone to compassion; but the hearts of those beasts were harder than
  stone.</p>

  <p>He suffered! God of our Fathers! how he suffered; but they could not force
  him to tell. At last he lost consciousness and then the brute in the uniform
  of captain, rageful that he failed, crossed the room, and struck the poor,
  unconscious old man a heavy blow in the face.</p>

  <p>After that it was my turn. He came to me.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you know, pig of a Yank!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"As he died, so can I die," I said, for I thought that Samuels was
  dead.</p>

  <p>"You will tell," he shrieked, almost insane with rage. "You will tell or
  your eyes will be burned from their sockets." He called the fiend with the
  bayonet&mdash;now white hot it seemed, so terrifically it glowed.</p>

  <p>As the fellow approached me the horror of the thing they would do to me
  seared my brain with an anguish almost as poignant as that which the hot iron
  could inflict on flesh. I had struggled to free myself of my bonds while they
  tortured Samuels, that I might go to his aid; but I had failed. Yet, now,
  scarcely without realizing that I exerted myself, I rose, and the cords
  snapped. I saw them step back in amazement as I stood there confronting
  them.</p>

  <p>"Go," I said to them. "Go before I kill you all. Even the Teivos, rotten
  as it is, will not stand for this usurpation of its authority. You have no
  right to inflict punishment. You have gone too far."</p>

  <p>The sergeant whispered for a moment to his superior, who finally appeared
  to assent grudgingly to some proposition of the others and then turned, and
  left the little shop.</p>

  <p>"We have no proof against you," said the sergeant to me. "We had no
  intention of harming you. All that we wanted was to frighten the truth out of
  you; but as to that," and he jerked a thumb toward Samuels, "we have the
  proof on him, and what we did we did under orders. Keep a still tongue in
  your head or it will be the worse for you, and thank the star under which you
  were born that you did not get worse than he."</p>

  <p>Then he left, too, and took the soldiers with him. I saw them pass into
  the rear doorway of Samuels's cottage, and a moment later I heard their
  horses' hoofs pounding on the surface of the market place. I could scarcely
  believe that I had escaped. Then I did not know the reason for it; but that I
  was to learn later, and that it was not so much of a miracle after all.</p>

  <p>I went right to poor old Samuels. He was still breathing, but
  unconscious&mdash;mercifully so. The withered old body was hideously burned,
  and mutilated, and one eye&mdash;but why describe their ghoulish world. I
  carried him into his cottage, and laid him on his cot, and then I found some
  flour, and covered his burns with it&mdash;that was all I knew to do for him.
  There were no doctors such as the ancients had, for there were no longer
  places of learning in which they could be trained. There were those who
  claimed to be able to heal. They gave herbs and strange concoctions; but as
  their patients usually died immediately we had little confidence in them.</p>

  <p>After I had put the flour on his wounds, I drew up a bench, and sat down
  beside him so that when he regained consciousness he would find a friend
  there to wait upon him. As I sat there looking at him he died. Tears came to
  my eyes in spite of all that I could do, for friends are few, and I had loved
  this old Jew, as we all did who knew him. He had been a gentle character,
  loyal to his friends, and inclined to be a little too forgiving to his
  enemies&mdash;even the Kalkars. That he was courageous his death proved.</p>

  <p>I put another mark against the score of Peter Johansen.</p>

  <p>The following day, father, Jim, and I buried old Samuels, the authorities
  came and took all his poor little possessions, and his cottage was turned
  over to another. But I had one thing, his most prized possession, that they
  did not get, for before I left him after he died, I went back into his shop,
  and gathered up the fragments of the man upon the cross, and put them into
  the little leather bag in which he had kept them.</p>

  <p>When I gave them to Juana, and told her the story of them she wept and
  kissed them, and with some glue such as we make from the hides and tendons of
  goats we mended it so it was difficult to tell where it had broken. After it
  was dry Juana wore it in its little bag about her neck, beneath her
  clothing.</p>

  <p>A week after the death of Samuels, Pthav sent for me, and very gruffly
  told me that the Teivos had issued a permit for me to use the land adjoining
  that allotted to my father. As before, his woman stopped me as I was
  leaving.</p>

  <p>"It was easier than I thought," she told me, "for Or-tis has angered the
  Teivos by attempting to usurp all its powers, and knowing that he hates you
  they were glad to grant your petition over his objections."</p>

  <p>I had heard rumors lately of the growing differences between Or-tis and
  the Teivos, and had learned that it was these that had saved me from the Kash
  Guard that day&mdash;the sergeant having warned his superior that should they
  maltreat me without good and sufficient reason the Teivos could take
  advantage of the fact to discipline the Guard and they were not yet ready for
  the test&mdash;that was to come later.</p>

  <p>During the next two or three months I was busy building our home and
  getting my place in order. I had decided to raise horses and obtained
  permission from the Teivos to do so&mdash;again over Or-tis's objections. Of
  course, the government controlled the entire horse traffic; but there were a
  few skilled horsemen permitted to raise them, though at any time their herds
  could be commandeered by the authorities. I knew that it might not be a very
  profitable business, but I loved horses and wanted to have just a few&mdash;a
  stallion and two or three mares. These I could use in tilling my fields and
  in the heavier work of hauling and at the same time I would keep a few goats,
  pigs and chickens to insure us a living.</p>

  <p>Father gave me half his goats and a few chickens and from Jim I bought two
  young sows and a boar. Later I traded a few goats to the Teivos for two old
  mares that they thought were no longer worth keeping, and that same day I was
  told of a stallion&mdash;a young outlaw&mdash;that Hoffmeyer had. The beast
  was five years old and so vicious that none dared approach him and they were
  on the point of destroying him.</p>

  <p>I went to Hoffmeyer and asked if I could buy the animal&mdash;I offered
  him a goat for it, which he was glad to accept, and then I took a strong rope
  and went to get my property. I found a beautiful bay with the temper of a
  Hellhound. When I attempted to enter the pen he rushed at me with ears back
  and jaws distended, but I knew that I must conquer him now or never, and so I
  met him with only a rope in my hand, nor did I wait for him. Instead, I ran
  to meet him and when he was in reach I struck him once across the face with
  the rope, at which he wheeled and let both hind feet fly out at me. Then I
  cast the noose that was at one end of the rope and caught him about the neck
  and for half an hour we had a battle of it.</p>

  <p>I never struck him unless he tried to bite or strike me and finally I must
  have convinced him that I was master, for he let me come close enough to
  stroke his glossy neck, though he snorted loudly all the while that I did so.
  When I had quieted him a bit I managed to get a half hitch around his lower
  jaw, and after that I had no difficulty in leading him from the pen. Once in
  the open I took the coils of my rope in my left hand and before the creature
  knew what I was about had vaulted to his back.</p>

  <p>He fought fair, I'll say that for him, for he stood on his feet; but for
  fifteen minutes he brought into play every artifice known to horse-kind for
  unseating a rider. Only my skill and my great strength kept me on his back
  and at that even the Kalkars who were looking on had to applaud.</p>

  <p>After that it was easy. I treated him with kindness, something he had
  never known before, and as he was an unusually intelligent animal, he soon
  learned that I was not only his master, but his friend. From being an outlaw
  he became one of the kindest and most tractable animals I have ever seen, so
  much so, in fact, that Juana used to ride him bareback.</p>

  <p>I love all horses and always have, but I think I never loved any animal as
  I did Red Lightning, as we named him.</p>

  <p>The authorities left us pretty well alone for some time because they were
  quarreling among themselves. Jim said there was an ancient saying about
  honest men getting a little peace when thieves fell out and it certainly
  fitted our case perfectly. But the peace didn't last forever, and when it
  broke the bolt that fell was the worst calamity that had ever come to us.</p>

  <p>One evening father was arrested for trading at night and taken away by the
  Kash Guard. They got him as he was returning to the house from the goat pens
  and would not even permit him to bid goodbye to mother. Juana and I were
  eating supper in our own house about three hundred yards away and never knew
  anything about it until mother came running over to tell us. She said that it
  was all done so quickly that they had father and were gone before she could
  run from the house to where they arrested him. They had a spare horse and
  hustled him onto it&mdash;then they galloped away toward the lake front. It
  seems strange that neither Juana nor I heard the hoof beats of the horses,
  but we did not.</p>

  <p>I went immediately to Pthav and demanded to know why father had been
  arrested, but he professed ignorance of the whole affair. I had ridden to his
  place on Red Lightning and from there I started to the Kash Guard barracks
  where the military prison is. It was contrary to law to approach the barracks
  after sunset without permission, so I left Red Lightning in the shadow of
  some ruins a hundred yards away and started on foot toward that part of the
  post, where I knew the prison to be located. It consisted of a high stockade
  around the inside of which were rude shelters. Upon the roofs of these armed
  guards patrolled. The center of the rectangle was an open court where the
  prisoners exercised, cooked their food and washed their clothing&mdash;if
  they cared to. There were seldom more than fifty confined there at a time, as
  it was only a detention camp to hold those awaiting trial and those sentenced
  to the mines. The latter were usually taken away when there were from
  twenty-five to forty of them.</p>

  <p>They marched them in front of mounted guards a distance of about fifty
  miles to the nearest mines, which lie southwest of our Teivos, driving them,
  like cattle, with heavy whips of bullhide. To such great cruelty were they
  subjected, so escaped convicts told us that always at least one out of every
  ten died upon the march.</p>

  <p>Though men were sometimes sentenced for as short terms as five years in
  the mines, none ever returned, other than the few who escaped, so harshly
  were they treated and so poorly fed. They labored twelve hours a day.</p>

  <p>I managed to reach the shadow of the wall of the stockade without being
  seen, for the Kash Guard was a lazy, inefficient, insubordinate soldier. He
  did as he pleased, though I understand that under Jarth's regime an effort
  was made to enforce discipline as he was attempting to institute a military
  oligarchy. Since Or-tis came they had been trying to revive the ancient
  military salute and the use of titles instead of the usual "Brother."</p>

  <p>After I reached the stockade I was at a loss to communicate with my
  father, since any noise I might make would doubtless attract the attention of
  the guard. Finally through a crack between two boards, I attracted the
  attention of a prisoner. The man came close to the stockade and I whispered
  to him that I wished to speak to Julian 8th. By luck I had happened upon a
  decent fellow, and it was not long before he had brought father and I was
  talking with him in low whispers.</p>

  <p>He told me that he had been arrested for trading by night and that he was
  to be tried on the morrow. I asked him if he would like to escape&mdash;that
  I would find the means if he wished me to, but he said that he was innocent
  of the charge as he had not been off our farm at night for months and that
  doubtless it was a case of mistaken identity and that he would be freed in
  the morning.</p>

  <p>I had my doubts, but he would not listen to escape as he argued that it
  would prove his guilt and they would have him for sure.</p>

  <p>"Where is there that I may go," he asked, "if I escape? I might hide in
  the woods, but what a life! I could never return to your mother and so sure
  am I that they can prove nothing against me that I would rather stand trial
  than face the future as an outlaw."</p>

  <p>I think now that he refused my offer of assistance not because he expected
  to be released, but because he feared that evil might befall me were I to
  connive at his escape. At any rate, I did nothing, since he would not let me,
  and went home again with a heavy heart and dismal forebodings.</p>

  <p>Trials before the Teivos were public, or at least were supposed to be,
  though they made it so uncomfortable for spectators that few, if any, had the
  temerity to attend. But under Jarth's new rule the proceedings of the
  military courts were secret and father was tried before such a court.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">IX. &mdash; I HORSEWHIP AN OFFICER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE passed days of mental anguish&mdash;hearing nothing,
  knowing nothing&mdash;and then one evening a single Kash Guard rode up to
  father's house. Juana and I were there with mother. The fellow dismounted and
  knocked at the door&mdash;a most unusual courtesy from one of these. He
  entered at my bidding and stood there a moment looking at mother. He was only
  a lad&mdash;a big, overgrown boy, and there was neither cruelty in his eyes
  nor the mark of the beast in any of his features. His mother's blood
  evidently predominated, and he was unquestionably not all Kalkar. Presently
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Which is Julian 8th's woman?" he asked; but he looked at mother as though
  he already guessed.</p>

  <p>"I am," said mother.</p>

  <p>The lad shuffled his feet and caught his breath&mdash;it was like a
  stifled sob.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "that I bring you such sad news." Then we guessed
  that the worst had happened.</p>

  <p>"The mines?" mother asked him, and he nodded affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Ten years!" he exclaimed, as one might announce a sentence of death, for
  such it was. "He never had a chance," he volunteered. "It was a terrible
  thing. They are beasts!"</p>

  <p>I could not but show my surprise that a Kash Guard should speak so of his
  own kind, and he must have seen it in my face.</p>

  <p>"We are not all beasts," he hastened to exclaim.</p>

  <p>I commenced to question him then and I found that he had been a sentry at
  the door during the trial and had heard it all. There had been but one
  witness&mdash;the man who had informed on father, and father had been given
  no chance to make any defense.</p>

  <p>I asked him who the informer was.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure of the man," he replied; "he was a tall,
  stoop&mdash;shouldered man. I think I heard him called Peter."</p>

  <p>But I had known even before I asked. I looked at mother and saw that she
  was dry-eyed and that her mouth had suddenly hardened into a firmness of
  expression such as I had never dreamed it could assume.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the youth, "it is not. I am instructed to notify you that
  you have thirty days to take another man or vacate these premises," and then
  he took a step toward mother.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, madam," he said. "It is very cruel; but what are we to do? It
  becomes worse each day. Now they are grinding down even the Kash Guard, so
  that there are many of us who&mdash;" but he stopped suddenly as though
  realizing that he was on the point of speaking treason to strangers, and
  turning on his heel, he quit the house and a moment later was galloping
  away.</p>

  <p>I expected mother to break down then; but she did not. She was very brave;
  but there was a new and terrible expression in her eyes&mdash;those eyes that
  had shone forth always with love. Now they were bitter, hate-filled eyes. She
  did not weep&mdash;I wish to God she had&mdash;instead, she did that which I
  had never known her to do before&mdash;she laughed aloud. Upon the slightest
  pretext, or upon no pretext at all, she laughed. We were afraid for her.</p>

  <p>The suggestion dropped by the Kash Guard started in my mind a train of
  thought of which I spoke to mother and Juana, and after that mother seemed
  more normal for a while, as though I had aroused hope, however feeble, where
  there had been no hope before. I pointed out that if the Kash Guard was
  dissatisfied the time was ripe for revolution, for if we could get only a
  part of them to join us, there would surely be enough of us to overthrow
  those who remained loyal. Then we would liberate all prisoners and set up a
  republic of our own such as the ancients had had.</p>

  <p>God of our fathers! How many times&mdash;how many thousand times had I
  heard that plan discussed and re-discussed! We would slay all the Kalkars in
  the world, and we would sell the land again that men might have pride of
  ownership and an incentive to labor hard and develop it for their children,
  for well we knew by long experience that no man will develop land that
  reverts to the government at death, or that government may take away from him
  at any moment. We would encourage manufactures; we would build schools and
  churches; we would have music and dancing; once again we would live as our
  fathers had lived.</p>

  <p>We looked for no perfect form of government, for we realized that
  perfection is beyond the reach of mortal men&mdash;merely would we go back to
  the happy days of our ancestors.</p>

  <p>It took time to develop my plan. I talked with every one I could trust and
  found them all willing to join me when we had enough. In the meantime, I
  cared for my own place and father's as well&mdash;I was very busy and time
  flew rapidly.</p>

  <p>About a month after father was taken away I came home one day with Juana
  who had accompanied me up river in search of a goat that had strayed. We had
  found its carcass, or rather its bones, where the Hellhounds had left them.
  Mother was not at our house, where she now spent most of her time, so I went
  over to father's to get her. As I approached the door I heard sounds of an
  altercation and scuffling that made me cover the few remaining yards at a
  rapid run.</p>

  <p>Without waiting to knock, as mother had taught me always to do, I burst
  into the living room to discover mother in the clutches of Peter Johansen.
  She was trying to fight him off; but he was a large and powerful man. He
  heard me just as I leaped for him and, turning, grappled with me. He tried to
  hold me off with one hand then while he drew his knife; but I struck him in
  the face with one fist and knocked him from me, away across the room. He was
  up again in an instant, bleeding from nose and mouth, and came back at me
  with his knife in his hand, slashing furiously. Again I struck him and
  knocked him down and when he arose and came again, I seized his knife hand
  and tore the weapon from him. He had no slightest chance against me, and he
  saw it soon, for he commenced to back away and beg for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Kill him, Julian," said mother. "Kill the murderer of your father."</p>

  <p>I did not need her appeal to influence me, for the moment that I had seen
  Peter there I know my long awaited time had come to kill him. He commenced to
  cry then&mdash;great tears ran down his cheeks and he bolted for the door and
  tried to escape. It was my pleasure to play with him as a cat plays with a
  mouse.</p>

  <p>I kept him from the door, seizing him and hurling him bodily across the
  room. Then I let him reach the window, through which he tried to crawl. I
  permitted him to get so far that he thought he was about to escape and then I
  seized him again and dragged him back to the floor, and lifting him to his
  feet I made him fight.</p>

  <p>I struck him lightly in the face many times and then I laid him on his
  back across the table, and kneeling on his chest, I spoke to him softly.</p>

  <p>"You had my friend, old Samuels, murdered, and my father, too, and now you
  come to attack my mother. What did you expect, swine; but this? Have you no
  intelligence? You must have known that I would kill you&mdash;speak!"</p>

  <p>"They said that they would get you today," he whimpered. "They lied to me.
  They went back on me. They told me that you would be in the pen at the
  barracks before noon. Damn them, they lied to me!"</p>

  <p>So! That was how it was, eh? And the lucky circumstance of the strayed
  goat had saved me to avenge my father and succor my mother; but they would
  come yet. I must hurry or they might come before I was through. So I took his
  head between my hands and bent his neck far back over the edge of the table
  until I heard his spine part, and that was the end of the vilest traitor who
  ever lived&mdash;one who professed friendship openly and secretly conspired
  to ruin us. In broad daylight I carried his body to the river and threw it
  in. I was past caring what they knew. They were coming for me and they would
  have their way with me whether they had any pretext or not. But they would
  have to pay a price for me, that I determined, and I got my knife and
  strapped it in its scabbard about my waist beneath my shirt. But they did not
  come&mdash;they had lied to Peter just as they lie to everyone.</p>

  <p>The next day was market day and tax day, so I went to market with the
  necessary goats and produce to make my trades and pay my taxes. As Soor
  passed around the market place making his collections, or rather his levies,
  for we had to deliver the stuff to his place ourselves, I saw from the
  excited conversation of those in his wake that he was spreading consternation
  among the people of the commune.</p>

  <p>I wondered what it might all be about, nor had I long to wait to discover,
  for he soon reached me. He could neither read nor write; but he had a form
  furnished by the government upon which were numbers that the agents were
  taught how to read and which stood for various classes of produce, livestock
  and manufactures. In columns beneath these numbers he made marks during the
  month for the amounts of my trades in each item&mdash;it was all crude, of
  course, and inaccurate; but as they always overcharged us and then added
  something to make up for any errors they might have made to our credit, the
  government was satisfied even if we were not.</p>

  <p>Being able to read and write as well as to figure, I always knew to a dot
  just what was due from me in tax, and I always had an argument with Soor,
  from which government emerged victorious every time.</p>

  <p>This month I should have owed him one goat; but he demanded three.</p>

  <p>"How is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Under the old rate you owed me the equivalent of a goat and a half; but
  since the tax has been doubled under the new law, you owe me three goats."
  Then it was I knew the cause of the excitement in other parts of the market
  place.</p>

  <p>"How do you expect us to live if you take everything from us?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The government does not care whether you live or not," he replied, "as
  long as you pay taxes while you do live."</p>

  <p>"I will pay the three goats," I said, "because I have to; but next market
  day I will bring you a present of the hardest cheese I can find."</p>

  <p>He did not say anything, for he was afraid of me unless he was surrounded
  by Kash Guards, but he looked mighty ugly. After he had passed along to the
  next victim I walked over to where a number of men were evidently discussing
  the new tax. There were some fifteen or twenty of them, mostly Yanks, and
  they were angry&mdash;I could see that before I came close enough to hear
  what they were saying. When I joined them one asked me what I thought of this
  new outrage.</p>

  <p>"Think of it!" I exclaimed. "I think what I have always thought&mdash;that
  as long as we submit without a murmur they will continue to increase our
  burden, that is already more than we can stagger under."</p>

  <p>"They have taken even my seed beans," said one, who raised beans almost
  exclusively. "As you all know, last year's crop was small and beans brought a
  high price, so they taxed me on my trades at the high price and then
  collected the tax in beans at the low price of the previous year. They have
  been doing that all this year; but I hoped to save enough for seed until now
  they have doubled the tax I know that I shall have no beans to plant next
  year."</p>

  <p>"What can we do about it?" asked another hopelessly. "What can we do about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"We can refuse to pay the tax," I replied.</p>

  <p>They looked at me much as men would look at one who said: "If you do not
  like it, you may commit suicide."</p>

  <p>"The Kash Guard would collect the tax and it would be heavier still, for
  they would kill us and take our women and all that we possess," said one.</p>

  <p>"We outnumber them," said I.</p>

  <p>"But we cannot face rifles with our bare hands."</p>

  <p>"It has been done," I insisted, "and it is better to die like men, facing
  the bullets, than by starvation like spineless worms. We are a hundred, yes,
  a thousand to their one, and we have our knives, and there are pitchforks and
  axes, besides the clubs that we can gather. God of our Fathers! I would
  rather die thus, red with the blood of these swine, than live as they compel
  us to live!"</p>

  <p>I saw some of them looking about to see who might have heard me, for I had
  raised my voice in excitement; but there were a few who looked steadily at me
  and nodded their heads in approval.</p>

  <p>"If we can get enough to join us, let us do it!" cried one.</p>

  <p>"We have only to start," I said, "and they will flock to us."</p>

  <p>"How should we start?" asked another.</p>

  <p>"I should start on Soor," I replied. "I should kill him and Pthav and
  Hoffmeyer first, and then make a round of the Kalkar houses where we can find
  rifles, possibly, and kill them all as we go. By the time the Kash Guard
  learns of it and can come in force, we shall have a large following. If we
  can overcome them and take their barracks we shall be too strong for any but
  a large force, and it will take a month to get many soldiers here from the
  East. Many of the Kash Guard will join us&mdash;they are
  dissatisfied&mdash;one of their number told me so. It will be easy if we are
  but brave."</p>

  <p>They commenced to take a great interest and there was even a cry of "Down
  with the Kalkars!" but I stopped that in a hurry, as our greatest hope of
  success lay in a surprise attack.</p>

  <p>"When shall we start?" they asked.</p>

  <p>"Now," I replied, "if we take them unaware, we shall be successful at
  first, and with success others will join us. Only by numbers, overwhelming
  numbers, may we succeed."</p>

  <p>"Good!" they cried. "Come! Where first?"</p>

  <p>"Soor," I said. "He is at the far end of the market place. We will kill
  him first and hang his head on a pole. We will carry it with us and as we
  kill we will place each head upon a pole and take it with us. Thus we will
  inspire others to follow us and put fear in the hearts of our enemies."</p>

  <p>"Lead on, Julian 9th!" they cried. "We will follow!"</p>

  <p>I turned and started in the direction of Soor and we had covered about
  half the distance when a company of Kash Guard rode into the market place at
  the very point where Soor was working.</p>

  <p>You should have seen my army. Like mist before a hot sun it disappeared
  from view, leaving me standing all alone in the center of the market
  place.</p>

  <p>The commander of the Kash Guard company must have noticed the crowd and
  its sudden dispersion, for he rode straight toward me, alone. I would not
  give him the satisfaction of thinking that I feared him and so I stood there
  waiting. My thoughts were of the saddest&mdash;not for myself, but for the
  sorry pass to which the Kalkar system had brought Americanism. These men who
  had deserted me would have been in happier days the flower of American
  manhood; but generations of oppression and servitude had turned their blood
  to water. Today they turned tail and fled before a handful of half-armed,
  poorly disciplined soldiers. The terror of the lunar fallacy had entered
  their hearts and rotted them.</p>

  <p>The officer reined in before me and then it was that I recognized
  him&mdash;the beast who had tortured and murdered old Samuels.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he barked.</p>

  <p>"Minding my own business, as you had better do," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You swine are becoming insufferable," he cried. "Get to your pen, where
  you belong&mdash;I will stand for no mobs and no insolence."</p>

  <p>I just stood there looking at him; but there was murder in my heart. He
  loosened the bull-hide whip that hung at the pommel of his saddle.</p>

  <p>"You have to be driven, do you?" He was livid with sudden anger and his
  voice almost a scream. Then he struck at me&mdash;a vicious blow with the
  heavy whip&mdash;struck at my face. I dodged the lash and seized it,
  wrenching it from his puny grasp. Then I caught his bridle and though his
  horse plunged and fought I lashed the rider with all my strength a dozen
  times before he tumbled from the saddle to the trampled earth of the market
  place.</p>

  <p>Then his men were upon me and I went down from a blow on the head. They
  bound my hands while I was unconscious and then hustled me roughly into a
  saddle. I was half dazed during the awful ride that ensued&mdash;we rode to
  the military prison at the barracks and all the way that fiend of a captain
  rode beside me and lashed me with his bullhide whip.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; REVOLUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THEN they threw me into the pen where the prisoners were
  kept and after they had left I was surrounded by the other unfortunates
  incarcerated there. When they learned what I had done they shook their heads
  and sighed. It would be all over with me in the morning, they
  said&mdash;nothing less than the butcher for such an offense as mine.</p>

  <p>I lay upon the hard ground, bruised and sore, thinking not of my future
  but of what was to befall Juana and mother if I, too, were taken from them.
  The thought gave me new strength and made me forget my hurts, for my mind was
  busy with plans, mostly impossible plans, for escape&mdash;and vengeance.
  Vengeance was often uppermost in my mind.</p>

  <p>Above my head, at intervals, I heard the pacing of the sentry upon the
  roof. I could tell, of course, each time that he passed and the direction in
  which he was going. It required about five minutes for him to pass above me,
  reach the end of his post and return&mdash;that was when he went west. Going
  east he took but a trifle over two minutes. Therefore, when he passed me
  going west his back was toward me for about two and a half minutes; but when
  he went east it was only for about a minute that his face was turned from the
  spot where I lay.</p>

  <p>Of course, he could not see me while I lay beneath the shed; but my
  plan&mdash;the one I finally decided upon&mdash;did not include remaining in
  the shed. I had evolved several subtle schemes for escape; but finally cast
  them all aside and chose, instead, the boldest that occurred to me. I knew
  that at best the chances were small that I could succeed in my plan and
  therefore the boldest seemed as likely as any other and it at least had the
  advantage of speedy results. I would be free or I would be dead in a few
  brief moments after I essayed it.</p>

  <p>I waited, therefore, until the other prisoners had quieted down and
  comparative silence in the direction of the barracks and the parade assured
  me that there were few abroad. The sentry came and went and came again upon
  his monotonous round. Now he was coming toward me from the east and I was
  ready, standing just outside the shed beneath the low eaves which I could
  reach by jumping. I heard him pass and gave him a full minute to gain the
  distance I thought necessary to drown the sounds of my attempt from his ears.
  Then I leaped for the eaves, caught with my fingers and drew myself quickly
  to the roof.</p>

  <p>I thought that I did it very quietly, but the fellow must have had the
  ears of a Hellhound for no more had I drawn my feet beneath me for the quick
  run across the roof than a challenge rang out from the direction of the
  sentry and almost simultaneously the report of a rifle.</p>

  <p>Instantly all was pandemonium. Guards ran, shouting, from all directions,
  lights flashed in the barracks, rifles spoke from either side of me and from
  behind me, while from below rose the dismal howlings of the prisoners. It
  seemed then that a hundred men had known of my plan and been lying in wait
  for me; but I was launched upon it and even though I had regretted it, there
  was nothing to do but carry it through to whatever was its allotted end.</p>

  <p>It seemed a miracle that none of the bullets struck me; but, of course, it
  was dark and I was moving rapidly. It takes seconds to tell about it; but it
  required less than a second for me to dash across the roof and leap to the
  open ground beyond the prison pen. I saw lights moving west of me and so I
  ran east toward the lake and presently the firing ceased as they lost sight
  of me, though I could hear sounds of pursuit. Nevertheless, I felt that I had
  succeeded and was congratulating myself upon the ease with which I had
  accomplished the seemingly impossible when there suddenly rose before me out
  of the black night the figure of a huge soldier pointing a rifle point blank
  at me. He issued no challenge nor asked any question&mdash;just pulled the
  trigger. I could hear the hammer strike the firing pin; but there was no
  explosion. I did not know what the reason was, nor did I ever know. All that
  was apparent was that the rifle misfired and then he brought his bayonet into
  play while I was springing toward him.</p>

  <p>Foolish man! But then he did not know that it was Julian 9th he faced.
  Pitifully, futilely he thrust at me and with one hand I seized the rifle and
  tore it from his grasp. In the same movement I swung it behind me and above
  my head, bringing it down with all the strength of one arm upon his thick
  skull. Like a felled ox he tumbled to his knees and then sprawled forward
  upon his face. He never knew how he died.</p>

  <p>Behind me I heard them coming closer and they must have seen me, for they
  opened fire again and I heard the beat of horses' hoofs upon my right and
  left. They were surrounding me upon three sides and upon the fourth was the
  great lake. A moment later I was standing upon the edge of the ancient
  breakwater while behind me rose the triumphant cries of my pursuers. They had
  seen me and they knew that I was theirs.</p>

  <p>At least, they thought they knew so. I did not wait for them to come
  closer; but raising my hands above me I dove head foremost into the cool
  waters of the lake. Swimming rapidly beneath the surface I kept close in the
  shadows and headed north.</p>

  <p>I had spent much of my summer life in the water of the river so that I was
  much at home in that liquid element as in air, but this, of course, the Kash
  Guard did not know, for even had they known that Julian 9th could swim they
  could not at that time have known which prisoner it was who had escaped and
  so I think they must have thought what I wanted them to think&mdash;that I
  had chosen self&mdash;drowning to recapture.</p>

  <p>However, I was sure they would search the shore in both directions and so
  I kept to the water after I came to the surface. I swam farther out until I
  felt there was little danger of being seen from shore, for it was a dark
  night. And thus I swam on until I thought I was opposite the mouth of the
  river when I turned toward the west, searching for it.</p>

  <p>Luck was with me. I swam directly into it and a short distance up the
  sluggish stream before I knew that I was out of the lake; but even then I did
  not take to the shore, preferring to pass the heart of the ancient city
  before trusting myself to land.</p>

  <p>At last I came out upon the north bank of the river, which is farthest
  from the Kash Guard barracks, and made my way as swiftly as possible up
  stream in the direction of my home. Here, hours later, I found an anxious
  Juana awaiting me, for already she had heard what had transpired in the
  market place. I had made my plans and had soon explained them to Juana and
  mother. There was nothing for them but to acquiesce, as only death could be
  our lot if we remained in our homes another day. I was astonished, that they
  had not already fallen upon Juana and mother. As it was they might come any
  minute. There was no time to lose.</p>

  <p>Hastily wrapping up a few belongings I took the Flag from its hiding place
  above the mantel and tucked it in my shirt&mdash;then we were ready. Going to
  the pens we caught Red Lightning and the two mares and three of my best milk
  goats. These latter we tied and after Juana and mother had mounted the mares
  I laid one goat in front of each across a mare's withers and the third before
  myself upon Red Lightning, who did not relish the strange burden and gave me
  considerable trouble at first.</p>

  <p>We rode out up river, leaving the pens open that the goats might scatter
  and possibly cover our trail until we could turn off the dusty path beyond
  Jim's house. We dared not stop to bid Jim and Mollie goodbye lest we be
  apprehended there by our enemies and bring trouble to our good friends. It
  was a sad occasion for poor mother, leaving thus her home and those dear
  neighbors who had been as close to her as her own; but she was as brave as
  Juana.</p>

  <p>Not once did either of them attempt to dissuade me from the wild scheme I
  had outlined to them. Instead, they encouraged me and Juana laid her hand
  upon my arm as I rode beside her, saying: "I would rather that you died thus
  than that we lived on as downtrodden serfs, without happiness and without
  hope."</p>

  <p>"I shall not die," I said, "until my work is done, at least. Then if die I
  must I shall be content to know that I leave a happier country for my fellow
  men to live in."</p>

  <p>"Amen!" whispered Juana.</p>

  <p>That night I hid them in the ruins of the old church, which we found had
  been partially burned by the Kalkars. For a moment I held them in my
  arms&mdash;my mother, and my wife&mdash;and then I left them to ride toward
  the southwest and the coal mines. The mines lie about fifty miles away and
  west of south according to what I had heard. I had never been to them; but I
  knew that I must find the bed of an ancient canal and follow it through the
  district of Joliet and between fifteen and twenty miles beyond, where I must
  turn south and, after passing a large lake, I would presently come to the
  mines. I rode the balance of the night and into the morning until I commenced
  to see people astir in the thinly populated country through which I
  passed.</p>

  <p>Then I hid in a wood through which a stream wound and here, found pasture
  for Red Lightning and rest for myself. I had brought no food, leaving what
  little bread and cheese we had brought from the house for mother and Juana. I
  did not expect to be gone over a week and I knew that with goat's milk and
  what they had on hand in addition to what they could find growing wild, there
  would be no danger of starvation before I returned&mdash;after which we
  expected to live in peace and plenty for the rest of our days.</p>

  <p>My journey was less eventful than I had anticipated. I passed through a
  few ruined villages and towns of greater or less antiquity, the largest of
  which was ancient Joliet, which was abandoned during the plague fifty years
  ago, the Teivos headquarters and station being removed directly west a few
  miles to the banks of a little river. Much of the territory I traversed was
  covered with thick woods, though here and there were the remnants of
  clearings which were not yet entirely reclaimed by nature. Now and again I
  passed those gaunt and lonely towers in which the ancients stored the winter
  feed for their stock. Those that have endured were of concrete and some
  showed but little the ravages of time, other than the dense vines that often
  covered them from base to capital, while several were in the midst of thick
  forests with old trees almost entwining them, so quickly does Nature reclaim
  her own when man has been displaced.</p>

  <p>After I passed Joliet I had to make inquiries. This I did boldly of the
  few men I saw laboring in the tiny fields scattered along my way. They were
  poor clods, these descendants of ancient America's rich and powerful farming
  class.</p>

  <p>Early in the second morning I came within sight of the stockade about the
  mines. Even at a distance I could see that it was a weak, dilapidated thing
  and that the sentries pacing along its top were all that held the prisoners
  within.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, many escaped; but they were soon hunted down and
  killed as the farmers in the neighborhood always informed on them. The
  commandant at the prison had conceived the fiendish plan of slaying one
  farmer for every prisoner who escaped and was not recaught.</p>

  <p>I hid until night and then, cautiously, I approached the stockade, leaving
  Red Lightning securely tied in the woods. It was no trick to reach the
  stockade, so thoroughly was I hidden by the rank vegetation growing upon the
  outside. From a place of concealment I watched the sentry, a big fellow; but
  apparently a dull clod who walked with his chin upon his breast and with the
  appearance of being half asleep.</p>

  <p>The stockade was not high and the whole construction was similar to that
  of the prison pen at Chicago, evidently having been designed by the same
  commandant in years gone by. I could hear the prisoners conversing in the
  shed beyond the wall and presently when one came near to where I listened I
  tried to attract his attention by making a hissing sound.</p>

  <p>After what seemed a long time to me, he heard me; but even then it was
  some time before he appeared to grasp the idea that some one was trying to
  attract his attention. When he did he moved closer and tried to peer through
  one of the cracks; but as it was dark out he could see nothing.</p>

  <p>"Are you a Yank?" I asked. "If you are I am a friend."</p>

  <p>"I am a Yank," he replied. "Did you expect to find a Kalkar working in the
  mines?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know a prisoner called Julian 8th?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be thinking for a moment and then he said: "I seem to have
  heard the name. What do you want of him?"</p>

  <p>"I wait to speak to him&mdash;I am his son."</p>

  <p>"Wait!" he whispered. "I think that I heard a man speak that name today. I
  will find out&mdash;he is near by."</p>

  <p>I waited for perhaps ten minutes when I heard some one approaching from
  the inside and presently a voice asked if I was still there.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "Is that you, father?" for I thought that the tones were
  his.</p>

  <p>"Julian, my son!" came to me almost as a sob. "What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>Briefly I told him and then of my plan. "Have the convicts the courage to
  attempt it?" I asked, in conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," he said, and I could not but note the tone of utter
  hopelessness in his voice. "They would wish to; but here our spirits and our
  bodies both are broken. I do not know how many would have the courage to
  attempt it. Wait and I will talk with some of them&mdash;all are loyal; but
  just weak from overwork, starvation and abuse."</p>

  <p>I waited for the better part of an hour before he returned. "Some will
  help," he said, "from the first, and others if we are successful. Do you
  think it worth the risk&mdash;they will kill you if you fail&mdash;they will
  kill us all."</p>

  <p>"And what is death to that which you are suffering?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said, "but the worm impaled upon the hook still struggles and
  hopes for life. Turn back, my son; we can do nothing against them."</p>

  <p>"I will not turn back," I whispered. "I will not turn back."</p>

  <p>"I will help you; but I cannot speak for the others. They may and they may
  not."</p>

  <p>We had spoken only when the sentry had been at a distance, falling into
  silence each time he approached the point where we stood. In the intervals of
  silence I could hear the growing restlessness of the prisoners and I guessed
  that what I had said to the first man was being passed around from mouth to
  mouth within until already the whole adjacent shed was seething with
  something akin to excitement. I wondered if it would arouse their spirit
  sufficiently to carry them through the next ten minutes. If it did success
  was assured.</p>

  <p>Father had told me all that I wanted to know&mdash;the location of the
  guard house and the barracks and the number of Kash Guard posted
  here&mdash;only fifty men to guard five thousand! How much more eloquently
  than words did this fact bespeak the humiliation of the American people and
  the utter contempt in which our scurvy masters hold us&mdash;fifty men to
  guard five thousand!</p>

  <p>And then I started putting my plan into execution&mdash;a mad plan which
  had only its madness to recommend it. The sentry approached and came opposite
  where I stood and I leaped for the eaves as I had leaped for the eaves of the
  prison pen at Chicago, only this time I leaped from the outside where the
  eaves are closer to the ground and so the task was easier. I leaped and
  caught hold. Then I scrambled up behind the sentry and before his dull wits
  told him that there was some one behind him I was upon his back and the same
  fingers that threw a mad bull closed upon his windpipe. The struggle was
  brief&mdash;he died quickly and I lowered him to the roof. Then I took his
  uniform from him and donned it, with his ammunition belt, and I took his
  rifle and started out upon his post, walking with slow tread and with my chin
  upon my breast as he had walked.</p>

  <p>At the end of my post I waited for the sentry I saw coming up and when he
  was close to me I turned back and he turned back away from me. Then I wheeled
  and struck him an awful blow upon the head with my rifle. He died more
  quickly than the other&mdash;instantly, I should say.</p>

  <p>I took his rifle and ammunition from him and lowered them inside the pen
  to waiting hands. Then I went on to the next sentry, and the next, until I
  had slain five more and passed their rifles to the prisoners below. While I
  was doing this five prisoners who had volunteered to father climbed to the
  roof of the shed and stripped the dead men of their uniforms and donned
  them.</p>

  <p>It was all done quietly and in the black night none might see what was
  going on a few feet away. I had to stop when I came near to the guard house.
  There I turned back and presently slid into the pen with my accomplices who
  had been going among the other prisoners with father arousing them to mutiny.
  Now were most of them ready to follow me, for so far my plan had proven
  successful. With equal quietness we overcame the men at the guard house and
  then moved on in a silent body toward the barracks.</p>

  <p>So sudden and so unexpected was our attack that we met with little
  resistance. We were almost five thousand to forty now. We swarmed in upon
  them like wild beasts upon a foe and we shot them and bayonetted them until
  none remained alive. Not one escaped. And now we were flushed with success so
  that the most spiritless became a veritable lion for courage.</p>

  <p>We who had taken the uniform of the Kash Guard discarded them for our own
  garb, as we had no mind to go abroad in the hated livery of our oppressors.
  That very night we saddled their horses with the fifty saddles that were
  there and fifty men rode the balance of the horses bareback. That made one
  hundred mounted men and the others were to follow on foot&mdash;to Chicago.
  "On to Chicago!" was our slogan.</p>

  <p>We traveled cautiously, though I had difficulty in making them do so, so
  intoxicated were they with their first success. I wanted to save the horses
  and also I wanted to get as many men into Chicago as possible, so we let the
  weakest ride, while those of us who were strong walked, though I had a time
  of it getting Red Lightning to permit another on his sleek back.</p>

  <p>Some fell out upon the way from exhaustion or from fear, for the nearer
  Chicago we approached the more their courage ebbed. The very thought of the
  feared Kalkars and their Kash Guard took the marrow from the bones of many. I
  do not know that one may blame them, for the spirit of man can endure only so
  much and when it is broken only a miracle can mend it in the same
  generation.</p>

  <p>We reached the ruined church a week from the day I left mother and Juana
  there and we reached it with less than two thousand men, so rapid had been
  the desertion in the last few miles before we entered the district.</p>

  <p>Father and I could scarcely wait to see our loved ones and so we rode on
  ahead to greet them, and inside the church we found three dead goats and a
  dying woman&mdash;my mother with a knife protruding from her breast. She was
  still conscious when we entered and I saw a great light of happiness in her
  eyes as they fell upon father and upon me. I looked around for Juana and my
  heart stood still, fearing that I would not find her&mdash;and fearing that I
  would.</p>

  <p>Mother could still speak, and as we leaned over her as father held her in
  his arms she breathed a faint story of what had befallen them. They had lived
  in peace until that very day when the Kash Guard had stumbled upon
  them&mdash;a large detachment under Or-tis himself. They had seized them to
  take them away; but mother had had a knife hidden in her clothing and had
  utilized it as we saw rather than suffer the fate she knew awaited them. That
  was all, except that Juana had had no knife and Or-tis had carried her
  off.</p>

  <p>I saw mother die, then, in father's arms and I helped him bury her after
  our men came and we had shown them what the beasts had done, though they knew
  well enough and had suffered themselves enough to know what was to be
  expected of the swine.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE BUTCHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE went on then, father and I filled with grief and
  bitterness and hatred even greater than we had known before. We marched
  toward the market place of our district, and on the way we stopped at Jim's
  and he joined us. Mollie wept when she heard what had befallen mother and
  Juana but presently she controlled herself and urged us on and Jim with us,
  though Jim needed no urging. She kissed him goodbye with tears and pride
  mingled in her eyes, and all he said was: "Goodbye, girl. Keep your knife
  with you always."</p>

  <p>And so we rode away with Mollie's "May the Saints be with you!" in our
  ears. Once again we stopped, at our abandoned goat pens, and there we dug up
  the rifle, belt and ammunition of the soldier father had slain years before.
  These we gave to Jim.</p>

  <p>Before we reached the market place our force commenced to dwindle
  again&mdash;most of them could not brave the terrors of the Kash Guard upon
  which they had been fed in whispered story and in actual experience since
  infancy. I do not say that these men were cowards&mdash;I do not believe that
  they were cowards and yet they acted like cowards. It may be that a lifetime
  of training had taught them so thoroughly to flee the Kash Guard that now no
  amount of urging could make them face it. The terror had become instinctive
  as is man's natural revulsion for snakes. They could not face the Kash Guard
  any more than some men can touch a rattler, even though it may be dead.</p>

  <p>It was market day and the place was crowded. I had divided my force so
  that we marched in from two directions in wide fronts, about five hundred men
  in each party, and surrounded the market place. As there were only a few men
  from our district among us, I had given orders that there was to be no
  killing other than that of Kash Guards until we, who knew the population,
  could pick out the right men.</p>

  <p>When the nearest people first saw us they did not know what to make of it,
  so complete was the surprise. Never in their lives had they seen men of their
  own class armed and there were a hundred of us mounted. Across the plaza a
  handful of Kash Guard were lolling in front of Hoffmeyer's office. They saw
  my party first, as the other was coming up from behind them, and they mounted
  and came toward us. At the same moment I drew the Flag from my breast and,
  waving it above my head, urged Red Lightning forward, shouting, as I rode:
  "Death to the Kash Guard! Death to the Kalkars!"</p>

  <p>And then, of a sudden, the Kash Guard seemed to realize that they were
  confronted by an actual force of armed men and their true color became
  apparent&mdash;all yellow. They turned to flee, only to see another force
  behind them. The people had now caught the idea and the spirit of our purpose
  and they flocked around us shouting, screaming, laughing, crying.</p>

  <p>"Death to the Kash Guard!" "Death to the Kalkars!" "The Flag!" I heard
  more than once, and "Old Glory!" from some who, like myself, had not been
  permitted to forget. A dozen men rushed to my side and grasping the streaming
  banner pressed it to their lips, while tears coursed down their cheeks. "The
  Flag! The Flag!" they cried. "The Flag of our fathers!"</p>

  <p>It was then, before a shot had been fired, that one of the Kash Guard rode
  toward me with a white cloth above his head. I recognized him immediately as
  the youth who had brought the cruel order to mother and who had shown sorrow
  for the acts of his superiors.</p>

  <p>"Do not kill us," he said, "and we will join with you. Many of the Kash
  Guard at the barracks will join, too."</p>

  <p>And so the dozen soldiers in the market place joined us, and a woman ran
  from her house carrying the head of a man stuck upon a short pole and she
  screamed forth her hatred against the Kalkars&mdash;the hatred that was the
  common bond between us all. As she came closer I saw that it was Pthav's
  woman and the head upon the short pole was the head of Pthav. That was the
  beginning&mdash;that was the little spark that was needed. Like maniacs,
  laughing horribly, the people charged the houses of the Kalkars and dragged
  them forth to death.</p>

  <p>Above the shrieking and the groans and the din could be heard shouts for
  the Flag and the names of loved ones who were being avenged. More than once I
  heard the name of Samuels the Jew. Never was a man more thoroughly avenged
  than he that day.</p>

  <p>Dennis Corrigan was with us, freed from the mines, and Betty Worth, his
  woman found him there, his arms red to the elbows with the blood of our
  oppressors. She had never thought to see him alive, and when she heard his
  story, and of how they had escaped, she ran to me and nearly pulled me from
  Red Lightning's back trying to hug and kiss me.</p>

  <p>It was she who started the people shouting for me until a mad, swirling
  mob of joy-crazed people surrounded me. I tried to quiet them, for I knew
  that this was no way in which to forward our cause, and finally I succeeded
  in winning a partial silence. Then I told them that this madness must cease,
  that we had not yet succeeded, that we had won only a single small district
  and that we must go forward quietly and in accordance with a sensible plan if
  we were to be victorious.</p>

  <p>"Remember," I admonished them, "that there are still thousands of armed
  men in the city and that we must overthrow them all, and then there are other
  thousands that the Twenty-Four will throw in upon us for they will not
  surrender this territory until they are hopelessly defeated from here to
  Washington&mdash;and that will require months and maybe years."</p>

  <p>They quieted down a little then and we formed plans for marching
  immediately upon the barracks that we might take the Kash Guard by surprise.
  It was about this time that father found Soor and killed him.</p>

  <p>"I told you," said father, just before he ran a bayonet through the tax
  collector, "that some day I would have my little joke, and this is the
  day."</p>

  <p>Then a man dragged Hoffmeyer from some hiding place and the people
  literally tore him to pieces, and that started the pandemonium all over
  again. There were cries of "On to the barracks!" and "Kill the Kash Guard!"
  followed by a concerted movement toward the lake front. On the way our
  numbers were increased by volunteers from every house&mdash;either fighting
  men and women from the houses of our class, or bloody heads from the houses
  of the Kalkars, for we carried them all with us, waving above us upon the
  ends of poles and at the head of all I rode with Old Glory, now waving from a
  tall staff.</p>

  <p>I tried to maintain some semblance of order, but it was impossible, and so
  we streamed along, screaming and killing, laughing and crying, each as the
  mood claimed him. The women seemed the maddest, possibly because they had
  suffered most, and Pthav's woman led them. I saw others there with one hand
  clutching a suckling baby to a bare breast while the other held aloft the
  dripping head of a Kalkar, an informer, or a spy. One could not blame them
  who knew the lives of terror and hopelessness they had led.</p>

  <p>We had just crossed the new bridge over the river into the heart of the
  great, ruined city, when the Kash Guard fell upon us from ambush with their
  full strength. They were poorly disciplined; but they were armed, while we
  were not disciplined at all nor scarcely armed. We were nothing but an angry
  mob into which they poured volley after volley at close range.</p>

  <p>Men, women and babies went down and many turned and fled; but there were
  others who rushed forward and grappled hand to hand with the Kash Guard,
  tearing their rifles from them. We who were mounted rode among them. I could
  not carry the Flag and fight, so I took it from the staff and replaced it
  inside my shirt and then I clubbed my rifle and guiding Red Lightning with my
  knees I drove into them.</p>

  <p>God of our fathers! But it was a pretty fight. If I had known that I was
  to die the next minute I would have died gladly for the joy I had in those
  few minutes. Down they went before me, to right and to left reeling from
  their saddles with crushed skulls and broken bodies, for wherever I hit them
  made no difference, in the result&mdash;they died if they came within reach
  of my rifle, which was soon only a bent and twisted tube of bloody metal.</p>

  <p>And so I rode completely through them with a handful of men behind me. We
  turned then to ride back over the crumbling ruins that were in this spot only
  mounds of debris and from the elevation of one of these hillocks of the dead
  past I saw the battle down by the river and a great lump came into my throat.
  It was all over&mdash;all but the bloody massacre. My poor mob had turned at
  last to flee. They were jammed and stuck upon the narrow bridge and the Kash
  Guard were firing volleys into that wedged mass of human flesh. Hundreds were
  leaping into the river only to be shot from the banks by the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Twenty-five mounted men surrounded me&mdash;all that was left of my
  fighting force&mdash;and at least two thousand Kash Guard lay between us and
  the river. Even could we have fought our way back we could have done nothing
  to save the day or our own people. We were doomed to die, but we decided to
  inflict more punishment before we died.</p>

  <p>I had in mind Juana in the clutches of Or-tis&mdash;not once had the
  frightful thought left my consciousness&mdash;and so I told them that I would
  ride to headquarters and search for her and they said that they would ride
  with me and that we would slay whom we could before the soldiers
  returned.</p>

  <p>Our dream had vanished, our hopes were dead. In silence we rode through
  the streets toward the barracks. The Kash Guard had not come over to our side
  as we had hoped&mdash;possibly they would have come had we some measure of
  success in the city; but there could be no success against armed troops for a
  mob of men, women and children.</p>

  <p>I realized too late that we had not planned sufficiently, yet we might
  have won had not some one escaped and ridden ahead to notify the Kash Guard.
  Could we have taken them by surprise in the barracks the outcome might have
  been what it had been in the market places through which we had passed. I had
  realized our weakness and the fact that if we took time to plan and arrange
  some spy or informer would have divulged all to the authorities long before
  we could have put our plans into execution. Really, there had been no other
  way than to trust to a surprise attack and the impetuosity of our first
  blow.</p>

  <p>I looked about among my followers as we rode along.</p>

  <p>Jim was there, but not father&mdash;I never saw him again. He probably
  fell in the battle at the new bridge. Orrin Colby, blacksmith and preacher,
  rode at my side, covered with blood&mdash;his own and Kash Guard. Dennis
  Corrigan was there, too.</p>

  <p>We rode right into the barrack yard, for with their lack of discipline and
  military efficiency they had sent their whole force against us with the
  exception of a few men who remained to guard the prisoners and a handful at
  headquarters building. The latter was overcome with scarcely a struggle and
  from one whom I took prisoner I learned where the sleeping quarters of Or-tis
  were located.</p>

  <p>Telling my men that our work was done I ordered them to scatter and escape
  as best they might, but they said that they would remain with me. I told them
  that the business I was on was such that I must handle it alone and asked
  them to go and free the prisoners while I searched for Juana. They said that
  they would wait for me outside and we parted.</p>

  <p>Or-tis's quarters were on the second floor of the building in the east
  wing and I had no difficulty in finding them. As I approached the door I
  heard the sound of voices raised in anger within and of rapid movement as
  though some one was running hither and thither across the floor. I recognized
  Or-tis's voice&mdash;he was swearing foully, and then I heard a woman's
  scream and I knew it was Juana.</p>

  <p>I tried the door and found it locked. It was a massive door, such as the
  ancients built in their great public buildings, such as this had originally
  been, and I doubted my ability to force it. I was mad with apprehension and
  lust for revenge and if maniacs gain tenfold in strength when the madness is
  upon them I must have been a maniac that moment, for when, after stepping
  back a few feet, I hurled myself against the door, the shot bolt tore through
  the splintering frame and the barrier swung in upon its hinges with a loud
  bang.</p>

  <p>Before me, in the center of the room, stood Or-tis with Juana in his
  clutches. He had her partially upon a table and with one hairy hand he was
  choking her. He looked up at the noise of my sudden entry, and when he saw me
  he went white and dropped Juana, at the same time whipping a pistol from its
  holster at his side. Juana saw me, too, and springing for his arm dragged it
  down as he pulled the trigger so that the bullet went harmlessly into the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Before he could shake her off I was upon him and had wrenched the weapon
  from his grasp. I held him in one hand as one might a little child&mdash;he
  was utterly helpless in my grip&mdash;and I asked Juana if he had wronged
  her.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she said, "he just came in after sending the Kash Guard away.
  Something has happened. There is going to be a battle; but he sneaked back to
  the safety of his quarters."</p>

  <p>Then she seemed to notice for the first time that I was covered with
  blood. "There has been a battle!" she cried, "and you have been in it."</p>

  <p>I told her that I had and that I would tell her about it after I had
  finished Or-tis. He commenced to plead and then to whimper. He promised me
  freedom and immunity from punishment and persecution if I would let him live.
  He promised never to bother Juana again and to give us his protection and
  assistance. He would have promised me the sun and the moon, and all the
  little stars, had he thought I wished them, but I wished only one thing just
  then and I told him so&mdash;to see him die.</p>

  <p>"Had you wronged her," I said, "you would have died a slow and terrible
  death; but I came in time to save her, and so you are saved that
  suffering."</p>

  <p>When he realized that nothing could save him he began to weep, and his
  knees shook so that he could not stand, and I had to hold him from the floor
  with one hand and with my other clenched I dealt him a single terrific blow
  between the eyes&mdash;a blow that broke his neck and crushed his skull. Then
  I dropped him to the floor and took Juana in my arms.</p>

  <p>Quickly, as we walked toward the entrance of the building, I told her of
  all that had transpired since we parted, and that now she would be left alone
  in the world for a while, until I could join her. I told her where to go and
  await me in a forgotten spot I had discovered upon the banks of the old canal
  on my journey to the mines. She cried and clung to me, begging to remain with
  me but I knew it could not be, for already I could hear fighting in the yard
  below. We would be fortunate indeed if one of us escaped. At last she
  promised on condition that I would join her immediately, which, of course, I
  had intended doing as soon as I had the chance.</p>

  <p>Red Lightning stood where I had left him before the door. A company of
  Kash Guard, evidently returning from the battle, were engaged with my little
  band that was slowly falling back toward the headquarters building. There was
  no time to be lost if Juana was to escape. I lifted her to Red Lightning's
  back from where she stooped, and threw her dear arms about my neck, covering
  my lips with kisses.</p>

  <p>"Come back to me soon," she begged, "I need you so&mdash;and it will not
  be long before there will be another to need you, too."</p>

  <p>I pressed her close to my breast. "And if I do not come back," I said
  "take this and give it to my son to guard as his fathers before him have." I
  placed the Flag in her hands.</p>

  <p>The bullets were singing around us and I made her go, watching her as the
  noble horse raced swiftly across the parade and disappeared among the ruins
  to the west. Then I turned to the fighting to find but ten men left to me.
  Orrin Colby was dead and Dennis Corrigan. Jim was left and nine others. We
  fought as best we could, but we were cornered now, for other guards were
  streaming onto the parade from other directions and our ammunition was
  expended.</p>

  <p>They rushed us then&mdash;twenty to one&mdash;and though we did the best
  we could they overwhelmed us. Lucky Jim was killed instantly, but I was only
  stunned by a blow upon the head.</p>

  <p>That night they tried me before a court-martial and tortured me in an
  effort to make me divulge the names of my accomplices. But there were none
  left alive that I knew of, even had I wished to betray them. As it was, I
  just refused to speak. I never spoke again after bidding Juana goodbye, other
  than the few words of encouragement that passed between those of us who
  remained fighting to the last.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning I was led forth to the butcher.</p>

  <p>I recall every detail up to the moment the knife touched my
  throat&mdash;there was a slight stinging sensation followed instantly
  by&mdash;oblivion.</p>

  <p>It was broad daylight when he finished&mdash;so quickly had the night
  sped&mdash;and I could see by the light from the port hole of the room where
  we sat that his face looked drawn and pinched and that even then he was
  suffering the sorrows and disappointments of the bitter, hopeless life he had
  just described.</p>

  <p>I rose to retire. "That is all?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "that is all of that reincarnation."</p>

  <p>"But you recall another?" I persisted. He only smiled as I was closing the
  door.</p>
