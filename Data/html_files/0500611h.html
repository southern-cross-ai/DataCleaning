<h1>Sand and Foam</h1>

<p class="author">by<br>
<br>
<b>Kahlil Gibran</b></p>

<hr>

<p>I AM FOREVER walking upon these shores,<br>
Betwixt the sand and the foam,<br>
The high tide will erase my foot-prints,<br>
And the wind will blow away the foam.<br>
But the sea and the shore will remain<br>
Forever.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Once I filled my hand with mist.<br>
Then I opened it and lo, the mist was a worm.<br>
And I closed and opened my hand again, and behold there was a
bird.<br>
And again I closed and opened my hand, and in its hollow stood a
man with a sad face, turned upward.<br>
And again I closed my hand, and when I opened it there was naught
but mist.<br>
But I heard a song of exceeding sweetness.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It was but yesterday I thought myself a fragment quivering
without rhythm in the sphere of life.<br>
Now I know that I am the sphere, and all life in rhythmic fragments
moves within me.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They say to me in their awakening, &#8220;You and the world you
live in are but a grain of sand upon the infinite shore of an
infinite sea.&#8221;<br>
And in my dream I say to them, &#8220;I am the infinite sea, and
all worlds are but grains of sand upon my shore.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Only once have I been made mute. It was when a man asked me,
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The first thought of God was an angel.<br>
The first word of God was a man.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We were fluttering, wandering, longing creatures a thousand
thousand years before the sea and the wind in the forest gave us
words.<br>
Now how can we express the ancient of days in us with only the
sounds of our yesterdays?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The Sphinx spoke only once, and the Sphinx said, &#8220;A grain
of sand is a desert, and a desert is a grain of sand; and now let
us all be silent again.&#8221;<br>
I heard the Sphinx, but I did not understand.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Long did I lie in the dust of Egypt, silent and unaware of the
seasons.<br>
Then the sun gave me birth, and I rose and walked upon the banks of
the Nile,<br>
Singing with the days and dreaming with the nights.<br>
And now the sun threads upon me with a thousand feet that I may lie
again in the dust of Egypt.<br>
But behold a marvel and a riddle!<br>
The very sun that gathered me cannot scatter me.<br>
Still erect am I, and sure of foot do I walk upon the banks of the
Nile.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Remembrance is a form of meeting.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We measure time according to the movement of countless suns; and
they measure time by little machines in their little pockets.<br>
Now tell me, how could we ever meet at the same place and the same
time?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Space is not space between the earth and the sun to one who
looks down from the windows of the Milky Way.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Humanity is a river of light running from the ex-eternity to
eternity.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Do not the spirits who dwell in the ether envy man his pain?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On my way to the Holy City I met another pilgrim and I asked
him, &#8220;Is this indeed the way to the Holy City?&#8221;<br>
And he said, &#8220;Follow me, and you will reach the Holy City in
a day and a night.&#8221;<br>
And I followed him. And we walked many days and many nights, yet we
did not reach the Holy City.<br>
And what was to my surprise he became angry with me because he had
misled me.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Make me, oh God, the prey of the lion, ere You make the rabbit
my prey.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>One may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>My house says to me, &#8220;Do not leave me, for here dwells
your past.&#8221;<br>
And the road says to me, &#8220;Come and follow me, for I am your
future.&#8221;<br>
And I say to both my house and the road, &#8220;I have no past, nor
have I a future. If I stay here, there is a going in my staying;
and if I go there is a staying in my going. Only love and death
will change all things.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How can I lose faith in the justice of life, when the dreams of
those who sleep upon feathers are not more beautiful than the
dreams of those who sleep upon the earth? &gt;Strange, the desire
for certain pleasures is a part of my pain.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Seven times have I despised my soul:<br>
The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain
height.<br>
The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.<br>
The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and
the easy, and she chose the easy.<br>
The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself
that others also commit wrong.<br>
The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her
patience to strength.<br>
The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew
not that it was one of her own masks.<br>
And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it
a virtue.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I AM IGNORANT of absolute truth. But I am humble before my
ignorance and therein lies my honor and my reward.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>There is a space between man&#8217;s imagination and man&#8217;s
attainment that may only be traversed by his longing.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Paradise is there, behind that door, in the next room; but I
have lost the key.<br>
Perhaps I have only mislaid it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You are blind and I am deaf and dumb, so let us touch hands and
understand.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The significance of man is not in what he attains, but rather in
what he longs to attain.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Some of us are like ink and some like paper.<br>
And if it were not for the blackness of some of us, some of us
would be dumb;<br>
And if it were not for the whiteness of some of us, some of us
would be blind.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Give me an ear and I will give you a voice.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Our mind is a sponge; our heart is a stream.<br>
Is it not strange that most of us choose sucking rather than
running?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When you long for blessings that you may not name, and when you
grieve knowing not the cause, then indeed you are growing with all
things that grow, and rising toward your greater self.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When one is drunk with a vision, he deems his faint expression
of it the very wine.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You drink wine that you may be intoxicated; and I drink that it
may sober me from that other wine.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When my cup is empty I resign myself to its emptiness; but when
it is half full I resent its half-fulness.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The reality of the other person is not in what he reveals to
you, but in what he cannot reveal to you.<br>
Therefore, if you would understand him, listen not to what he says
but rather to what he does not say.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Half of what I say is meaningless; but I say it so that the
other half may reach you.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A sense of humour is a sense of proportion.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>My loneliness was born when men praised my talkative faults and
blamed my silent virtues.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Life does not find a singer to sing her heart she produces
a philosopher to speak her mind.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A truth is to be known always, to be uttered sometimes.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The real in us is silent; the acquired is talkative.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The voice of life in me cannot reach the ear of life in you; but
let us talk that we may not feel lonely.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When two women talk they say nothing; when one woman speaks she
reveals all of life.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Frogs may bellow louder than bulls, but they cannot drag the
plough in the field not turn the wheel of the winepress, and of
their skins you cannot make shoes.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Only the dumb envy the talkative.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If winter should say, &#8220;Spring is in my heart,&#8221; who
would believe winter?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Every seed is a longing.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Should you really open your eyes and see, you would behold your
image in all images.<br>
And should you open your ears and listen, you would hear your own
voice in all voices.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It takes two of us to discover truth: one to utter it and one to
understand it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Though the wave of words is forever upon us, yet our depth is
forever silent.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Many a doctrine is like a window pane. We see truth through it
but it divides us from truth.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Now let us play hide and seek. Should you hide in my heart it
would not be difficult to find you. But should you hide behind your
own shell, then it would be useless for anyone to seek you. &gt;A
woman may veil her face with a smile.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How noble is the sad heart who would sing a joyous song with
joyous hearts.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>He who would understand a woman, or dissect genius, or solve the
mystery of silence is the very man who would wake from a beautiful
dream to sit at a breakfast table.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I would walk with all those who walk. I would not stand still to
watch the procession passing by.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You owe more than gold to him who serves you. Give him of your
heart or serve him.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Nay, we have not lived in vain. Have they not built towers of
our bones?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Let us not be particular and sectional. The poet&#8217;s mind
and the scorpion&#8217;s tail rise in glory from the same
earth.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Every dragon gives birth to a St. George who slays it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Trees are poems that the earth writes upon the sky. We fell them
down and turn them into paper that we may record our emptiness.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Should you care to write (and only the saints know why you
should) you must needs have knowledge and art and music &#8211; the
knowledge of the music of words, the art of being artless, and the
magic of loving your readers.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They dip their pens in our hearts and think they are
inspired.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Should a tree write its autobiography it would not be unlike the
history of a race.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If I were to choose between the power of writing a poem and the
ecstasy of a poem unwritten, I would choose the ecstasy. It is
better poetry.<br>
But you and all my neighbors agree that I always choose badly.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Poetry is not an opinion expressed. It is a song that rises from
a bleeding wound or a smiling mouth.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Words are timeless. You should utter them or write them with a
knowledge of their timelessness.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A POET IS a dethroned king sitting among the ashes of his palace
trying to fashion an image out of the ashes.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the
dictionary.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>In vain shall a poet seek the mother of the songs of his
heart.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Once I said to a poet, &#8220;We shall not know your worth until
you die.&#8221;<br>
And he answered saying, &#8220;Yes, death is always the revealer.
And if indeed you would know my worth it is that I have more in my
heart than upon my tongue, and more in my desire than in my
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If you sing of beauty though alone in the heart of the desert
you will have an audience.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Poetry is wisdom that enchants the heart.<br>
Wisdom is poetry that sings in the mind.<br>
If we could enchant man&#8217;s heart and at the same time sing in
his mind,<br>
Then in truth he would live in the shadow of God.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Inspiration will always sing; inspiration will never
explain.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We often sing lullabies to our children that we ourselves may
sleep.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>All our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of
the mind.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Thinking is always the stumbling stone to poetry.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A great singer is he who sings our silences.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How can you sing if your mouth be filled with food?<br>
How shall your hand be raised in blessing if it is filled with
gold?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They say the nightingale pierces his bosom with a thorn when he
sings his love song.<br>
So do we all. How else should we sing?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Genius is but a robin&#8217;s song at the beginning of a slow
spring.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Even the most winged spirit cannot escape physical
necessity.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A madman is not less a musician than you or myself; only the
instrument on which he plays is a little out of tune.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The song that lies silent in the heart of a mother sings upon
the lips of her child.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>No longing remains unfulfilled.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I have never agreed with my other self wholly. The truth of the
matter seems to lie between us.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Your other self is always sorry for you. But your other self
grows on sorrow; so all is well.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>There is no struggle of soul and body save in the minds of those
whose souls are asleep and whose bodies are out of tune.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When you reach the heart of life you shall find beauty in all
things, even in the eyes that are blind to beauty.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We live only to discover beauty. All else is a form of
waiting.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Sow a seed and the earth will yield you a flower. Dream your
dream to the sky and it will bring you your beloved.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The devil died the very day you were born.<br>
Now you do not have to go through hell to meet an angel.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Many a woman borrows a man&#8217;s heart; very few could possess
it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If you would possess you must not claim.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When a man&#8217;s hand touches the hand of a woman they both
touch the heart of eternity.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Love is the veil between lover and lover.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Every man loves two women; the one is the creation of his
imagination, and the other is not yet born.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Men who do not forgive women their little faults will never
enjoy their great virtues.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Love that does not renew itself every day becomes a habit and in
turn a slavery.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Lovers embrace that which is between them rather than each
other.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Love is a word of light, written by a hand of light, upon a page
of light.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an
opportunity.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If you do not understand your friend under all conditions you
will never understand him.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Your most radiant garment is of the other person&#8217;s
weaving;<br>
You most savory meal is that which you eat at the other
person&#8217;s table;<br>
Your most comfortable bed is in the other person&#8217;s house.<br>
Now tell me, how can you separate yourself from the other
person?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Your mind and my heart will never agree until your mind ceases
to live in numbers and my heart in the mist.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We shall never understand one another until we reduce the
language to seven words.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>HOW SHALL MY heart be unsealed unless it be broken?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Only great sorrow or great joy can reveal your truth.<br>
If you would be revealed you must either dance naked in the sun, or
carry your cross.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Should nature heed what we say of contentment no river would
seek the sea, and no winter would turn to Spring. Should she heed
all we say of thrift, how many of us would be breathing this
air?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You see but your shadow when you turn your back to the sun.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You are free before the sun of the day, and free before the
stars of the night;<br>
And you are free when there is no sun and no moon and no star.<br>
You are even free when you close your eyes upon all there is.<br>
But you are a slave to him whom you love because you love him,<br>
And a slave to him who loves you because he loves you.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We are all beggars at the gate of the temple, and each one of us
receives his share of the bounty of the King when he enters the
temple, and when he goes out.<br>
But we are all jealous of one another, which is another way of
belittling the King.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You cannot consume beyond your appetite. The other half of the
loaf belongs to the other person, and there should remain a little
bread for the chance guest.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If it were not for your guests all houses would be graves.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Said a gracious wolf to a simple sheep, &#8220;Will you not
honor our house with a visit?&#8221;<br>
And the sheep answered, &#8220;We would have been honored to visit
your house if it were not in your stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I stopped my guest on the threshold and said, &#8220;Nay, wipe
not your feet as you enter, but as you go out.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Generosity is not in giving me that which I need more than you
do, but it is in giving me that which you need more than I do.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You are indeed charitable when you give, and while giving, turn
your face away so that you may not see the shyness of the
receiver.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The difference between the richest man and the poorest is but a
day of hunger and an hour of thirst.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We often borrow from our tomorrows to pay our debts to our
yesterdays.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I too am visited by angels and devils, but I get rid of
them.<br>
When it is an angel I pray an old prayer, and he is bored;<br>
When it is a devil I commit an old sin, and he passes me by.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>After all this is not a bad prison; but I do not like this wall
between my cell and the next prisoner&#8217;s cell;<br>
Yet I assure you that I do not wish to reproach the warder not the
Builder of the prison.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Those who give you a serpent when you ask for a fish, may have
nothing but serpents to give. It is then generosity on their
part.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Trickery succeeds sometimes, but it always commits suicide.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You are truly a forgiver when you forgive murderers who never
spill blood, thieves who never steal, and liars who utter no
falsehood.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>He who can put his finger upon that which divides good from evil
is he who can touch the very hem of the garment of God.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If your heart is a volcano how shall you expect flowers to bloom
in your hands?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A strange form of self-indulgence! There are times when I would
be wronged and cheated, that I may laugh at the expense of those
who think I do not know I am being wronged and cheated.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>What shall I say of him who is the pursuer playing the part of
the pursued?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Let him who wipes his soiled hands with your garment take your
garment. He may need it again; surely you would not.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It is a pity that money-changers cannot be good gardeners.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Please do not whitewash your inherent faults with your acquired
virtues. I would have the faults; they are like mine own.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How often have I attributed to myself crimes I have never
committed, so that the other person may feel comfortable in my
presence.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Even the masks of life are masks of deeper mystery.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You may judge others only according to your knowledge of
yourself.<br>
Tell me now, who among us is guilty and who is unguilty?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The truly just is he who feels half guilty of your misdeeds.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Only an idiot and a genius break man-made laws; and they are the
nearest to the heart of God.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It is only when you are pursued that you become swift.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I have no enemies, O God, but if I am to have an enemy<br>
Let his strength be equal to mine,<br>
That truth alone may be the victor.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You will be quite friendly with your enemy when you both
die.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Perhaps a man may commit suicide in self-defense.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Long ago there lived a Man who was crucified for being too
loving and too lovable.<br>
And strange to relate I met him thrice yesterday.<br>
The first time He was asking a policeman not to take a prostitute
to prison; the second time He was drinking wine with an outcast;
and the third time He was having a fist-fight with a promoter
inside a church.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If all they say of good and evil were true, then my life is but
one long crime.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Pity is but half justice.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>THE ONLY ONE who has been unjust to me is the one to whose
brother I have been unjust.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When you see a man led to prison say in your heart,
&#8220;Mayhap he is escaping from a narrower prison.&#8221;<br>
And when you see a man drunken say in your heart, &#8220;Mayhap he
sought escape from something still more unbeautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Oftentimes I have hated in self-defense; but if I were stronger
I would not have used such a weapon.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How stupid is he who would patch the hatred in his eyes with the
smile of his lips.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Only those beneath me can envy or hate me.<br>
I have never been envied nor hated; I am above no one.<br>
Only those above me can praise or belittle me.<br>
I have never been praised nor belittled; I am below no one.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Your saying to me, &#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; is
praise beyond my worth, and an insult you do not deserve. &gt;How
mean am I when life gives me gold and I give you silver, and yet I
deem myself generous.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When you reach the heart of life you will find yourself not
higher than the felon, and not lower than the prophet.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Strange that you should pity the slow-footed and not the
slow-minded,<br>
And the blind-eyed rather than the blind-hearted.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It is wiser for the lame not to break his crutches upon the head
of his enemy.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How blind is he who gives you out of his pocket that he may take
out of your heart.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Life is a procession. The slow of foot finds it too swift and he
steps out;<br>
And the swift of foot finds it too slow and he too steps out.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If there is such a thing as sin some of us commit it backward
following our forefathers&#8217; footsteps;<br>
And some of us commit it forward by overruling our children.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The truly good is he who is one with all those who are deemed
bad.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We are all prisoners but some of us are in cells with windows
and some without.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Strange that we all defend our wrongs with more vigor than we do
our rights.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Should we all confess our sins to one another we would all laugh
at one another for our lack of originality.<br>
Should we all reveal our virtues we would also laugh for the same
cause.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>An individual is above man-made laws until he commits a crime
against man-made conventions; After that he is neither above anyone
nor lower than anyone.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Government is an agreement between you and myself. You and
myself are often wrong.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Crime is either another name of need or an aspect of a
disease.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Is there a greater fault than being conscious of the other
person&#8217;s faults?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If the other person laughs at you, you can pity him; but if you
laugh at him you may never forgive yourself.<br>
If the other person injures you, you may forget the injury; but if
you injure him you will always remember.<br>
In truth the other person is your most sensitive self given another
body.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>How heedless you are when you would have men fly with your wings
and you cannot even give them a feather.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Once a man sat at my board and ate my bread and drank my wine
and went away laughing at me.<br>
Then he came again for bread and wine, and I spurned him;<br>
And the angels laughed at me.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Hate is a dead thing. Who of you would be a tomb?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It is the honor of the murdered that he is not the murderer.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The tribune of humanity is in its silent heart, never its
talkative mind.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They deem me mad because I will not sell my days for gold;<br>
And I deem them mad because they think my days have a price.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They spread before us their riches of gold and silver, of ivory
and ebony, and we spread before them our hearts and our
spirits.;<br>
And yet they deem themselves the hosts and us the guests.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I would not be the least among men with dreams and the desire to
fulfill them, rather than the greatest with no dreams and no
desires.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into
silver and gold.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>We are all climbing toward the summit of our hearts&#8217;
desire. Should the other climber steal your sack and your purse and
wax fat on the one and heavy on the other, you should pity him;<br>
The climbing will be harder for his flesh, and the burden will make
his way longer.<br>
And should you in your leanness see his flesh puffing upward, help
him a step; it will add to your swiftness.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You cannot judge any man beyond your knowledge of him, and how
small is your knowledge.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I would not listen to a conqueror preaching to the

<p>The truly free man is he who bears the load of the bond slave
patiently.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A thousand years ago my neighbor said to me, &#8220;I hate life,
for it is naught but a thing of pain.&#8221;<br>
And yesterday I passed by a cemetery and saw life dancing upon his
grave.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Strife in nature is but disorder longing for order.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Solitude is a silent storm that breaks down all our dead
branches;<br>
Yet it sends our living roots deeper into the living heart of the
living earth.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Once I spoke of the sea to a brook, and the brook thought me but
an imaginative exaggerator;<br>
And once I spoke of a brook to the sea, and the sea thought me but
a depreciative defamer.</p>

<p>How narrow is the vision that exalts the busyness of the ant

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The highest virtue here may be the least in another world.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The deep and the high go to the depth or to the height in a
straight line; only the spacious can move in circles.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>IF IT WERE not for our conception of weights and measures we
would stand in awe of the firefly as we do before the sun.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A scientist without imagination is a butcher with dull knives
and out-worn scales.<br>
But what would you, since we are not all vegetarians?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When you sing the hungry hears you with his stomach.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Death is not nearer to the aged than to the new-born; neither is
life.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If indeed you must be candid, be candid beautifully; otherwise
keep silent, for there is a man in our neighborhood who is
dying.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Mayhap a funeral among men is a wedding feast among the
angels.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A forgotten reality may die and leave in its will seven thousand
actualities and facts to be spent in its funeral and the building
of a tomb.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>In truth we talk only to ourselves, but sometimes we talk loud
enough that others may hear us.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses
it simply.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If the Milky Way were not within me how should I have seen it or
known it?</p>

<p>Unless I am a physician among physicians they would not believe

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Every great man I have known had something small in his make-up;
and it was that small something which prevented inactivity or
madness or suicide.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The truly great man is he who would master no one, and who would
be mastered by none.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I would not believe that a man is mediocre simply because he
kills the criminals and the prophets.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Tolerance is love sick with the sickness of haughtiness.</p>

<p>Worms will turn; but is it not strange that even elephants will

<p>We are all seeking the summit of the holy moutain; but shall not

<p>Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep,
too grave to laugh, and too self-ful to seek other than itself.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Had I filled myself with all that you know what room should I
have for all that you do not know?</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the

ungrateful to these teachers.</p>

<p>An exaggeration is a truth that has lost its temper.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>If you can see only what light reveals and hear only what sound

Then in truth you do not see nor do you hear.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A fact is a truth unsexed.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>You cannot laugh and be unkind at the same time.</p>

<p>Said a hunted fox followed by twenty horsemen and a pack of

twenty foxes riding on twenty asses and accompanied by twenty
wolves to chase and kill one man.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you have solved all the mysteries of life you long for

<p>My friend, you and I shall remain strangers unto life,<br>

<p>Yestereve I saw philosophers in the market-place carrying their
heads in baskets, and crying aloud, &#8220;Wisdom! Wisdom for
sale!&#8221;<br>
Poor philosophers! They must needs sell their heads to feed their
hearts. &gt;Said a philosopher to a street sweeper, &#8220;I pity
you. Yours is a hard and dirty task.&#8221;<br>
And the street sweeper said, &#8220;Thank you, sir. But tell me
what is your task?&#8221;<br>
And the philosopher answered saying, &#8220;I study man&#8217;s
mind, his deeds and his desires.&#8221;<br>
Then the street sweeper went on with his sweeping and said with a
smile, &#8220;I pity you too.&#8221;</p>

But I say, &#8220;A bird and a feather in the bush is worth more

Your seeking after <em>that feather</em> is life with winged feet;
nay, it is life itself.</p>

<p>There are only two elements here, beauty and truth; beauty in

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Great beauty captures me, but a beauty still greater frees me
even from itself.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Beauty shines brighter in the heart of him who longs for it than
in the eyes of him who sees it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>I admire him who reveals his mind to me; I honor him who unveils

<p>We choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience
them.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When either your joy or your sorrow becomes great the world

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Desire is half of life; idifference is half of death.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The bitterest thing in our today&#8217;s sorrow is the memory of

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They say to me, &#8220;You must needs choose between the
pleasures of this world and the peace of the next world.&#8221;<br>
And I say to them, &#8221;I have chosen both the delights of this
world and the peace of the next. For I know in my heart that the

And you may say in your innocence, &#8220;How noble is the one and

But should you close your eyes and listen awhile you would hear a

<p>You may have heard of the Blessed Mountain.<br>
It is the highest mountain in our world.<br>

valley.<br>
That is why it is called the Blessed Mountain.</p>

<p>Every thought I have imprisoned in expression I must free by my
deeds.</p>
