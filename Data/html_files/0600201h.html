<br>
MR. RICARDO IN BRITTANY</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Ricardo sat on an iron chair at an iron table
outside a bar and drank with his coffee a sweet and heady liqueur.
Yet he was exhilarated "Nobody would believe it," he said with a
little giggle. But it was Brittany and summer time. "Browsing with
Browning in Brittany," he alliterated wittily, "and so far I have
been fortunate enough not to meet James Lee's wife." Mr. Ricardo
was quite alone. He had sent his luggage home from Aix and with his
suit-case, his fine big Rolls-Royce and his chauffeur was making a
roundabout tour through Brittany to Cherbourg; whence by a
transatlantic liner what was to him a preferable entry to England
could be achieved. But the car had lurched and something had
broken. For three days he must stay in this little town with the
uncommon name. But his liner wasn't due at Cherbourg for four
days&mdash;and it was Brittany and summer time.</p>

<p>Moreover, this drowsy little square of Lezardrieux, with the
raised terrace at which he sat, the three sides of shops and houses
and the empty fourth, where a steep cliff of sand and bushes
dropped to the pool of the Lezardrieux river, made a sharp appeal
to him. It was operatic. Below the brow of the hill, he could
almost hear the conductor tap with his baton for attention. That
boy in the bright red shirt strolling across the square might at
any moment burst into song. But it would only have made an
anti-climax if he had. For the stout, middle-aged woman who had
waddled out from the Bar with a big letter in her hand was now at
Mr. Ricardo's elbow. "You gave my estaminet as your address at
Lezardrieux, sir?"</p>

<p>"I telegraphed it," Mr. Ricardo agreed. "I had not yet found a
lodging in the town."</p>

<p>"Then this letter is for you, perhaps. There is another English
gentleman..."</p>

<p>"Captain Mordaunt. Yes. He owns the small yacht in the Pool.
Perhaps if you would let me see the letter, I could tell you for
which of us it comes."</p>

<p>For the woman, in her desire that so unusual an occurrence as a
letter should not miscarry, was clasping it tightly to her bosom.
As she showed the face of it, Mr. Ricardo recognised the hand which
had written it.</p>

<p>"It's for me," he cried with a little whoop of excitement. He
snatched the envelope from her reluctant hand and tore it open. He
read:</p>

<p class="letter">My dear friend,<br>
I accuse the reception of your invitation...</p>

<p>and sat back, reflecting with toleration, "Yes, he would accuse
something&mdash;it's his nature to&mdash;and I have no doubt that
he has signed his name like a peer of England." He turned, to the
back of the letter. There it was. "Hanaud"&mdash;just
"Hanaud"&mdash;the name of terror.</p>

<p>"Really, really," Mr. Ricardo said to himself and the smile of
amusement passed from his lips.</p>

<p>After all, it was a year since he had invited Chief Inspector
Hanaud of the Paris Sureté to spend a holiday in Grosvenor Square.
Hanaud could have accused the reception of his letter a year ago.
But he had not accused it. He had kept it on the chance that he
might want to accuse it at a later time. And the time had come.</p>

<p>"But I don't know," said Mr. Ricardo indignantly, as he turned
to the lady of the estaminet. "It is Madame Rollard, is it
not?"</p>

<p>It certainly was Madame Rollard, as she assured him. But Mr.
Ricardo was not thinking of Madame Rollard. He hit the offending
letter with his knuckles.</p>

<p>"These are not manners."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"I do not keep a lodging house."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Definitely no." as though she had fathomed his troubles, and at
each shake her body wobbled like a jelly.</p>

<p>"I must consider," said Mr. Ricardo truculently.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Madame. "There must be thought, and no doubt
Calvados to encourage it;" and she waddled back to her bar.</p>

<p>Over his second Calvados, Mr. Ricardo read the rest of Hanaud's
letter, and one sentence in it dispersed all his irritation:
"Besides the holiday, there is a little thing I have to do, a
little perplexity I have to make clear, in which I shall ask for
your help." The letter fluttered down upon Mr. Ricardo's knees, and
he drew in a breath and his face lost ten years of its age. Those
little perplexities! Didn't he know them? He would be insulted,
ridiculed, outraged, baffled, humiliated, used. Yet there would be
thrills, excitements, perils. Life would become once more a topaz
instead of a turquoise. He would be helping to track great
criminals to their doom. He and Hanaud, or, more probably, Hanaud
and he.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo turned again to the letter; and in a few moments
sprang to his feet. Hanaud would travel by the Channel steamer to
Dover to-morrow. He would reach London by five, Grosvenor Square by
five-thirty. But here was Ricardo, marooned in Lezardrieux. He
rushed to the Post Office and sent off a telegram to his
housekeeper. If only he were volatile enough to travel on that same
beam! There was a midnight ship from Le Havre, but he couldn't
reach Le Havre. He came back into the square. Oh, he couldn't sit
in that iron chair by that iron table for two more days and,
frankly, however much enthusiasm for Brittany might have hidden the
truth from him at the beginning, he did not like Calvados. In
despair he walked to the edge of the square and looked down into
the pool. There were fishing boats drawn up on the beach, fishing
boats afloat at anchor, and amongst them&mdash;yes,
undoubtedly&mdash;a small ketch yacht. The water in the pool was so
deep that the ketch was moored close enough under the hill to
escape a careless eye. But to Mr. Ricardo's envious gaze, the
lustrous black paint of its sides, its white deck and burnished
brass were as explicit as a dictionary.</p>

<p>"If I only owned it," cried Mr. Ricardo, noting, to be sure, how
calm was the air and the sky how cloudless.</p>

<p>And lo! there was a stir upon the deck. The ketch was slowly
beginning to swing her bows towards the sea. Three men clambered
from the fo'c'sle, removed the covers from the sails and the wheel
and pulled the dinghy in to the starboard side.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo looked over his shoulder and saw Captain Mordaunt
walking across the square to the path which slanted down the sand
cliff to the beach.</p>

<p>"Captain Mordaunt," he said, stepping to his side. Mr. Ricardo
remembered him as a retired Captain of Grenadiers who passed from
cocktail party to cocktail party but had no intimates; a man
dissatisfied, jealous, with a grudge against the world. But there
was no sign of discontent about him now. His face had smoothed out,
there was a smile upon his lips, a friendliness in his manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Ricardo."</p>

<p>Ricardo looked down at the river. A hand was culling the dinghy
towards the beach.</p>

<p>"That is your ketch."</p>

<p>Mordaunt nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Agamemnon," he said with a laugh. "There was a time when
trawler-owners fancied high-sounding names. I didn't change it when
I bought her. But I added a bathroom."</p>

<p>"Very convenient," said Mr. Ricardo primly.</p>

<p>"Inevitable," returned Captain Mordaunt. "Agamemnon without a
bathroom? He would be alive now."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, whose acquaintance with the classics was limited,
felt it prudent to titter. He added: "You are crossing to
England?"</p>

<p>Captain Mordaunt became wary. He looked at the sky; he looked at
Mr. Ricardo. "You would like a passage?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Captain Mordaunt nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well," he argued thoughtfully, "I have a spare cabin and the
boat's sound and the weather looks good. But it's the fourth week
in August and one can't count on it, and if it should come on to
blow, these little ketches bounce about a bit, and we're very close
to the water of course..."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo raised a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>"I am something of a yachtsman, too," he said, with a smile;
comrade to comrade, as it were.</p>

<p>"Indeed, several times Mr. Ricardo had sailed out of and back
into Brightlingsea harbour on the Dutch barge of a friend, and
once, on a smooth clear day of June, he had made the ocean voyage
from Ryde to Weymouth, but when he said that he was a yachtsman, he
was undoubtedly exaggerating. Mordaunt rather obviously doubted but
accepted it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," and Mr. Ricardo hurried away to his lodging with a
great show of pleasure.</p>

<p>But the pleasure was evaporating. Had he not, after all, been in
a needless hurry? Who was Hanaud that he could not be left to
investigate by himself for a day? There was no doubt he had been
hasty. That was certainly a very small Agamemnon swinging round in
the Pool, as Agamemnons go. Mr. Ricardo had a suspicion that
Captain Mordaunt might have acquired greater merit if, instead of
cramming a bathroom into this very small Agamemnon, he had bought a
bigger Agamemnon with a bathroom in it already.</p>

<p>"Half an hour, Mr. Ricardo," had said Captain Mordaunt.</p>

<p>"Half an hour," Mr. Ricardo had repeated.</p>

<p>He gave instructions and money to his chauffeur, packed his
suit-case, and was waiting on the beach when the nose of the dinghy
grounded upon it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2"><small>CHAPTER 2</small></a><br>
<br>
MEERSCHAUM</h2>

<p class="first">The ketch, with her propeller turning, slipped
down the ten miles of the Lezardrieux river between the buoys and
the lighthouses, turned eastwards at the mouth to avoid the sunken
slabs, and wriggled out into the open sea. A steady wind was
blowing on her beam. The engine was switched off, the sails
hoisted, the log run out, and the course laid for the Start. The
land sank out of sight.</p>

<p>Captain Mordaunt followed Mr. Ricardo down to the spare cabin in
the stern of the ketch.</p>

<p>"We will dine early, if you don't mind. There are only four of
us all told, the skipper, the mate, the steward and myself, and at
night we want two on deck when we are crossing the Channel, even if
the night's fine. I can, by the way, lend you a thick coat and a
yachting cap."</p>

<p>The first sign of any change came, indeed, when they were eating
their dinner, side by side on the cushioned lounge in the little
saloon. The ketch rose and dipped suddenly with a thud, as if it
had met some unexpected swell of the sea and, a few moments later,
the sheets of the mainsail rattled on the deck as the great wing of
canvas was drawn in. Mordaunt looked up at the tell tale compass
fixed above his head.</p>

<p>"The wind has shifted to the north," he said.</p>

<p>The yachtsman of the quiet waters looked anxiously at his host.
"Is that"&mdash;he searched for a word&mdash;"awkward?" he asked,
hoping that the tremor was unnoticeable in his voice. After all,
they were a very long way from the land.</p>

<p>Mordaunt shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Prolongs our passage. A cigar?" He reached for a box behind on
the shelf. "Try those dates in brandy! We'll have some coffee," and
he rang the hand-bell.</p>

<p>But whilst they drank their coffee, the movement of the ketch
increased. To Mr. Ricardo she seemed now to hop forward and come
down with a noisy crunch. Mordaunt smiled.</p>

<p>"There's some wind somewhere ahead of us," he said. "Let's go up
and see. You had better put that thick coat on."</p>

<p>When they stepped from the tiny deck-house on to the deck, Mr.
Ricardo was disturbed.</p>

<p>"Glary," said Hamlin the skipper at the wheel; glary it
certainly was. The sun was sinking in the west, a plate without
effulgence, a plate as yellow as an old spade guinea. The kindness
had all died out of the sky and, when the sun had gone, there were
left a livid glare, a cold sea and this little ship alone in the
midst of it.</p>

<p>Mordaunt looked up at the topsail.</p>

<p>"We might carry on until we get the weather news," he said. For
these were the days before the Second War, when Broadcasting House
flung out her warnings and good tidings to all the ships on the
near seas.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock night was closing in. Mr. Ricardo was seated in
a corner of the deckhouse. Mordaunt leaned over a small receiver
mounted on a revolving pedestal. Hamlin's big figure blocked the
doorway as he bent to listen; and suddenly, startlingly, a new
voice spoke clearly out of the darkness at their elbows, giving
them the weather report.</p>

<p>"A deep depression over Ireland is moving rapidly to the
south-east. There will be a gale in the Channel to-night."</p>

<p>"As a rule, that gives us half an hour," said Hamlin. He and
Mordaunt were out of the deck-cabin in an instant, leaving Ricardo
almost sick with indignation against the radiant cheerful voice
which had announced the direful news.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he know we're out here in a cockle-shell?" he
exclaimed. "He's going home to have supper&mdash;a nice hot supper
in a nice hot room&mdash;on land! And we're here, drowned men
practically."</p>

<p>But there was activity enough upon the deck. A storm jib was
set, the topsail taken down and folded away with the big jib in the
locker, the main and mizzen sails were reefed, and the sidelights
burning brightly lifted on their shelves. The ship was snug and her
crew clothed in oilskins and high boots.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo stood in the doorway of the cabin looking forward
over its roof. The ketch still rose and dipped upon the unbroken
swell, but ahead in the darkness lines of white ran out to right
and left on the crests of waves with extraordinary speed.</p>

<p>"Here it comes," said Mordaunt. He raised his hand to the mizzen
rigging on the port side. Hamlin, the skipper, was at the wheel,
lifting the boat gently up to the wind. Mordaunt grinned at
Ricardo.</p>

<p>"I should go down and get into your bunk whilst you can," he
cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo shook his head. That was quite unthinkable.</p>

<p>"I'll stay in the deckhouse for a little," he said, and then
more bravely, "This is a new experience for me."</p>

<p>He crouched on the divan in the deckhouse with a foot against
the rail-guard of the companion, and a few moments afterwards the
gale broke upon them like an army. A wave smote the ketch so that
it shuddered. Its crest leaped gaily over the port bow and ran in
streams along the deck, whilst the bulk of it roared away to
leeward from under the keel in an angry tumble of white fire.</p>

<p>"Disappointed, that's what it was," Mr. Ricardo began, but he
could not go on.</p>

<p>For all about them was noise, noise unbelievable and yet
combined into an awful harmony. The waves hammered and roared; the
wind shrilled through the rigging like a Sabbath of lost souls; the
planks groaned and clamoured that not for one moment longer could
they cling together; and, above all other sounds, the topping-lift
thrashed the belly of the mainsail with the crack of a hundred
pistols.</p>

<p>Ricardo was terrified into a hopeless acquiescence.</p>

<p>"It can't go on," he said to himself as he clutched at anything
which was clutchable in the deck-cabin. "That's all. It can't go
on."</p>

<p>But it did go on, hour after hour, until Mr. Ricardo actually
dozed and then woke to an incident very pleasant but quite
incredible. Mordaunt was at the helm, the skipper by the port
rigging, when Mordaunt held the ship up to meet a more passionately
venomous wave than any which had gone before. The two men bent
their heads as the brine cut their faces like a whiplash.</p>

<p>"That was a nasty one," cried the skipper.</p>

<p>"A beast!" answered Mordaunt; and then, to Ricardo's
stupefaction, they laughed, not with the wry laughter of the
defeated, but heartily, enjoyably.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps, after all" thought Ricardo. He was glad that he
had not taken Mordaunt's advice and retired to his bunk. He would
have been ice-cold with terror. He couldn't say that it was warm up
here in the deckhouse, but it was friendly, and near to people who
could laugh at the right moment. Again Mr. Ricardo dozed and woke;
and now the mate was at the wheel whilst Mordaunt stood on one side
unclenching his frozen fingers and Hamlin upon the other. Suddenly
they all looked up and, as they looked, a ghostly twilight was
diffused about the world. Mr. Ricardo was in the mood to believe
that here at last was the Day of Judgement, so unillumined was the
light, so pallid the faces lifted to it. But the mate broke the
solemnity of the moment by asserting "'Tis the dawning," and after
both men had stared at him in admiration of his optimism, the
laughter and the raillery were renewed. The mate was the
incorrigible consoler. Somewhere, high up, beyond apprehension, and
almost beyond faith, a full moon was riding in a blue sky and some
sliver of its radiance slipped through. Mr. Ricardo clambered
through the doorway and looked forward over its roof, clinging with
both hands. As far as the eyes could reach, great black seas, like
mountains, raced after each other in a riot of foam, whilst above
his head the swaying topmast seemed on the point of scraping and
snapping; a roof of grey cement, so solid and so low was the canopy
of cloud. But whilst he watched the chink closed up again and once
more there was no light but the white fire of the waves and the
more friendly gleam of the binnacle lamp.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo scrambled back to his corner in the deck house. He
pulled up the cushion behind him so that his head rested more
comfortably upon it.</p>

<p>"After all, we're still afloat," he reflected. "I have not been
seasick&mdash;" this he put down less to his panic than to his
quality as a yachtsman&mdash;"and those three men, though they are
unalarmed, are watchful."</p>

<p>They were more than ever watchful now, it seemed. For more and
more often he heard the man in the bows sing out: "Light ahead,
sir."</p>

<p>And more and more often the answer from the man at the wheel:
"Right!"</p>

<p>For they were crossing now the crown of the great trunk road
which flows from Ushant to the Port of London.</p>

<p>To the sound of those cries Mr. Ricardo fell asleep, and was
only awakened by someone shaking him by the shoulder. Mordaunt was
leaning over him.</p>

<p>"We can see the light at Start Point," he said.</p>

<p>The motion of the ship had diminished, the noise had lost its
terror, they were feeling the protection of the land, the gale was
dying. Again Mr. Ricardo stood at the cabin door and looked
forward. All was darkness, but in a few seconds he saw, as at the
end of a long black iron tube, a faint glimmer which broadened out
to the likeness of a beautiful incandescent moth and shrivelled
again into nothing. Mordaunt, at his side, began to count: "One,
two, three.."</p>

<p>He counted up to twenty, and the light shone again.</p>

<p>"Yes, Start Point," said Mordaunt. "But, of course, we're a long
way from it yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo stayed thereafter at the deckhouse door, and so was
a witness of the incident which made that night more than ever
memorable to him and perplexed the forgotten Hanaud for so
long.</p>

<p>A big ancient rusty iron steamer came lumbering up from the west
across the bows of Agamemnon but yawing as she came, as if she had
not made up her mind whether to run ashore on the long ledge of
Start Point or strike away for the French coast.</p>

<p>"Look out, sir!" cried Hamlin, the skipper, sharply to Mordaunt
at the wheel. "She's a dago with the cabin-boy in command and all
the rest of 'em asleep."</p>

<p>It was that spectral hour between night and dawn when all is
magnified and yards are miles. Mordaunt held his ketch up until he
had shaken what wind there was out of her sails; and it was lucky
that he did, for his bowsprit hardly scraped clear of the iron
monster's side.</p>

<p>"There! I told you, didn't I?" cried Hamlin, and he pointed to
where a light shone on the name upon a buoy. "A dago!"</p>

<p>All could read the name. El Rey. But they had hardly time to
read it. For a cry, like a wail, was borne to them urgently upon
the breeze.</p>

<p>Men who sail in little boats are accustomed to see in the dark
of the night and bad weather light on land, where there is no land,
and to hear voices from the sea, where no men are drowning&mdash;so
accustomed that they do not speak of them lest they should be
thought to talk foolishly. So now Mordaunt and his crew looked each
to the other, hesitating whether they should seem to have heard.
But the cry reached them again, weaker, yet nearer, and just over
the port bow.</p>

<p>The mate shouted "Hold on!" and cutting a life-buoy loose from
the main rigging, hurled it out. The ketch was lying now, head in
to the wind, with its sails flapping. Hamlin pulled up out of its
slots the panel of bulwark which opened the port gangway and,
flinging himself on his face, leaned over the side. The mate and
the steward joined him, one upon his knees, the other with a
boathook in his hands. From his, position at the wheel Mordaunt
could see nothing of what was happening, but something or someone
was being lifted on board.</p>

<p>It was someone, a slim young man with hair as black as ebony,
and a face of a pallor so thick that it could hardly ever before
have met the daylight. So Mordaunt thought, until the rescued man
was stretched on deck. He was alive but snatching at the air in his
exhaustion.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a grey cotton shirt, a jacket and a pair of
trousers of canvas, and he wore sandshoes on his naked feet.</p>

<p>"Brandy," said Mordaunt, and the steward dived down the
companion. He came back with a full glass and, lifting the man's
shoulders against his knee, put the glass to his lips. The young
man's face was long, his body where it showed at the neck and
breast just bones in an envelope of skin. He took a drink of the
brandy, threw back his head on the steward's knee and coughed.</p>

<p>"A martyr by El Greco, without a martyr's saintliness," said
Mordaunt, thinking the stranger beyond hearing.</p>

<p>"A dago," said Hamlin the skipper.</p>

<p>The stranger turned his eyes on Hamlin and said: "Damn your
eyes!" in English unmistakable, and fainted away.</p>

<p>Mordaunt gave his orders. "You had better get him below, rub him
down with a hot towel, give, him a spare suit of pyjamas, and put
him to bed in Mr. Ricardo's berth with a hot-water bottle. You
don't mind?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo didn't mind. He was, indeed, fluttering around,
trying to help and getting in everybody's way. Meanwhile a question
was troubling his mind as much as he, in his efforts to help, was
troubling Craston, the mate, and the steward. Why did the name of
the ship, El Rey&mdash;"The King"&mdash;awaken some vague familiar
resonance in his brain? El Rey... El Rey... No, there was no
answer.</p>

<p>When he climbed the companion again on to the deck, the light on
Start Point had been extinguished, the day had come, and the ketch
had borne away upon its course.</p>

<p>"Mind the Skerries' buoy, sir," said Hamlin. "The tide's setting
us to the east."</p>

<p>"I know," Mordaunt answered; and after a moment or two, Hamlin
continued: "A queer thing. That young-fellow-my-lad must have
tumbled off the stern of that ship just as she began to cross our
bows. The tide brought him straight down on us. A bit of good luck,
I should say."</p>

<p>Mordaunt grinned and shook his head.</p>

<p>"A bit of good timing, I should."</p>

<p>And with that Mr. Ricardo's memory began to work. El Rey! He had
read about it. Certain States of South America had chartered El
Rey&mdash;Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia&mdash;to carry back to their
respective countries some undesirable aliens. She was to call at
Spanish and French ports and in England. Then she was to go on with
the rest of her passengers to the Baltic and Germany. There lay the
explanation of something which had puzzled them, all, but of which
no one had spoken. The stranger had a broad black band about his
right leg above the ankle, as though a heavy iron fetter had for
years bitten into his flesh.</p>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3"><small>CHAPTER 3</small></a><br>
<br>
MORDAUNT WRITES A LETTER</h2>

<p class="first">Mordaunt dropped his anchor in the Dart river
above the ferry which crosses from Dartmouth town and the railway
station at Kingswear. The morning was clear, but neither town was
yet alert to it. Mordaunt felt in one of the pigeon-holes at the
back of the deckhouse and drew out of it a plain yellow flag.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" he said and Hamlin took it from his hand. It was
the flag flown by every vessel hailing straight from a foreign
port, and no one, whether passenger or crew, must leave her until
the harbour authorities had given her clearance. Hamlin, the
skipper, balanced the folded flag on the palm of his hand. He was
thinking that Captain Mordaunt and his Agamemnon had sailed in and
out of Dartmouth so often that no one on shore would trouble about
his port of departure unless the yellow flag invited him.</p>

<p>"I am to hoist this?" he asked, thrusting out his under-lip.</p>

<p>Mordaunt nodded his head and added slowly, "Yes."</p>

<p>"You've a good deal to do, Captain Mordaunt, haven't you? You
have to lay up the boat, travel to London, settle your affairs for
a long absence..."</p>

<p>"Still," Mordaunt interrupted, "there are rules."</p>

<p>They were both thinking of the stranger with the black band
above his ankle who in the misty dawn had come aboard.</p>

<p>"He'll have to report, of course, when the Customs men come on
board," said Mordaunt. "I don't see why I should be delayed."</p>

<p>Hamlin was still patting doubtfully the piece of bunting in his
hand. It was clearly important that Mordaunt should not be held up
in the Dart river by regulations at this time. Mordaunt spoke
quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll wake him up, whilst you hoist that;" and Mordaunt had only
reached the bottom of the companion when the yellow flag flickered
up the mast like a flame.</p>

<p>The stranger, however, wanted no awakening. He was sitting,
shaved and dressed, down to his shoes, in clothes which belonged to
Mordaunt.</p>

<p>"Your steward lent me these," he said.</p>

<p>"And he was quite right," Mordaunt returned with a smile.</p>

<p>A box full of cigarettes and an ash-tray were lying on the table
and Mordaunt pushed the box over to the stranger. "Don't you
smoke?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do."</p>

<p>"Then try one, please!"</p>

<p>There was something vulpine in the speed of the stranger's thin
long fingers as they darted towards the box; but it was not so
startling as the control which stopped them at the rim of the box
and set them tapping out a bar of a tune before they dropped
languidly on one of the paper tubes. Yet he was starving for a
cigarette! So, at all events, Mr. Ricardo decided, as he sat
unnoticeable reading, or pretending to read, an official report
taken from the bookcase above his head; and so, too, had decided.
He said pleasantly:</p>

<p>"You should have helped yourself."</p>

<p>The man from the sea shook his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"That would have put me at too heavy a disadvantage."</p>

<p>He struck a match and lit his cigarette and, as he drew the
smoke into his lungs, he uttered a little moan of delight.
"Oh...oh!"</p>

<p>He looked at the brand on the tube. "Turkish."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The stranger inhaled with his eyes closed. How many years had
passed since this enjoyment had been allowed to him? Mr. Ricardo
wondered. But, indeed, it was more than an enjoyment, however
sensuous. It seemed to take from him the suspicion, the fear, the
expectation of an enemy in everyone, which Mr. Ricardo had
observed. He sat there smoking, a man repaired. Mordaunt, with a
glance of amusement at him, opened a drawer in the table.</p>

<p>"I have got something to say to you&mdash;by the way, my name's
Mordaunt, Philip Mordaunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and for more than a moment afterwards
there followed a disconcerting silence. Then the stranger replied:
"And mine is Devisher&mdash;Bryan Devisher."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>Mordaunt took from the drawer which he had opened a letter-case
and counted out fifteen pounds in notes.</p>

<p>"Before we talk," he said, "I should be happier if we were on
still more equal terms. Will you borrow these from me?"</p>

<p>Upon the white face a flush slowly spread. "Philip Mordaunt, you
said?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Captain," and seeing that Devisher's eyes were
wandering about the cabin, Mordaunt lifted a blotting pad with some
paper upon it, placed them in front of him, and added a pencil from
the table drawer. He gave the name of a club.</p>

<p>Devisher wrote down the address, tucked the paper away in a
pocket, and did the same with the money.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" he said; and as there had been no patronage in the
offer, so there was no servility in the acceptance.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Mordaunt. He was sitting on the couch against the
saloon wall with its lockers and its high ledge, whilst Devisher
was on a chair at the head of the table at his right hand. "Now,
the position is this. No one must leave this ship until the Customs
officers come on board. They won't be here probably for another
hour. It's hardly eight yet. But when they do come, you ought to
make a full statement to them."</p>

<p>"I see, yes," Devisher observed, staring down at the mahogany
table. He could not keep the bitterness out of his voice, which
already had a natural rasp, but he could, according to Mr. Ricardo,
hide thus the savage fury of his eyes. "That I fell overboard, for
instance."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Without a passport."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"From the ship, El Rey."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It was as evident to Devisher as to Ricardo on the opposite side
of the saloon, that "the ship El Rey" meant no more to Mordaunt
than information of a merely formal kind.</p>

<p>"With the black mark of a fetter so wide and deep around my
ankle, that I am likely to wear it to the day of my death."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo sat up. No, no, he said to himself. Every word up
till now had been inspired by the right spirit and used in the
right place. But this reference to the chain by the man who had
worn it&mdash;no, no! A lack of susceptibility to the higher
tastes, an indelicacy. Fie, fie, Mr. Devisher!</p>

<p>Apparently, however, Captain Mordaunt was unconscious of any
want of tact in his guest. He laughed as frankly as Devisher had
spoken.</p>

<p>"That's your affair. I don't see how the Customs could make any
charge, whether you declared it or not."</p>

<p>The words were lightly said but not lightly taken. Devisher had
so far kept to the same unemotional key, but now he clapped his
hands to his face and he shivered like a man stricken with a mortal
chill. Mordaunt drew back in discomfort.</p>

<p>"I must tell you," cried Devisher violently, plucking is hands
away from his face; and Mordaunt's discomfort increased. A
scene&mdash;he had a horror of it, he had been at every shift he
knew to avoid it.</p>

<p>"My name is Devisher, Bryan Devisher, yes. But it's not the name
on my passport in the purser's cabin on El Rey."</p>

<p>"Then you give your real name here," Mordaunt interrupted, but
the interruption went almost unheard and certainly not
considered.</p>

<p>"I took part in a revolution over there in Venezuela," the young
man rushed on, the words almost tumbling in a froth like a breaker
from his mouth. "And it was high time, I can tell you. A revolution
was wanted, but it failed. Vicente Gomez, the dictator won, as he
always did. I lay quiet up in Caracas, but I was betrayed&mdash;and
I think I know, too, who betrayed me. I spent six years dragging an
iron cannon-ball in the Castillo del Libertador, an island prison
in the bay with its cells below the water-line. Six mortal years
until Vicente Gomez died. Then we were released. I forget how many
tons of iron fetters and handcuffs were thrown into the sea. But
after a time, when this ship El Rey was chartered, I was
deported."</p>

<p>To both his auditors the story was true. The white mask of
Devisher's face, which had felt neither sun nor wind for years,
bore out his words, apart from the black ring about his ankle. And
the horrors which they suggested were stark before their eyes.</p>

<p>"But we have a Minister there, a Consul," cried Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"You could have appealed to them," added Mordaunt.</p>

<p>Devisher shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Not a chance! I hadn't made myself known to any of them whilst
I could. Besides..." and his eyes fell sullenly and, after a moment
or two, a displeasing sly smile twisted his face.</p>

<p>But Mordaunt had had enough. The sly smile had put a full stop
at the end of all this palaver. Confessions were for the priest in
the curtained darkness of his confessional box, not for the tiny
saloon of a ketch in the river Dart on an August morning. He rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he exclaimed, and he rang a hand-bell vigorously.</p>

<p>The steward appeared from the pantry forward before Devisher
could add another word.</p>

<p>"I want a hot bath, Perry, and then we'll all want
breakfast."</p>

<p>Breakfast, that was what they wanted. They would be different
men with some good hot bacon and eggs and coffee inside of them. He
heard the water begin to run from the taps in the bathroom beyond
his tiny cabin on his right. He stood for a moment, seized by a
fresh idea. He sat down, took a block of notepaper, envelopes, and
a fountain pen out of the drawer.</p>

<p>"Yes, whilst I am waiting, I'll write a letter;" and, pulling
the blotting pad towards him, he began to write, slowly, selecting
his words, a very still figure, so that no one interrupted him;
Devisher perhaps because his outburst had been silenced, Ricardo
certainly because he was trying to reconcile this Captain Mordaunt
with the Mordaunt against whom he had brushed at so many six
o'clock sherry parties. Then he had been a flibbertigibbet of a
man, querulous, caustic, defeated, the sort of man who sees others
of his age leaving him behind, making their names, and complains,
"If only I could find my vocation, they'd soon be surprised." But
now he had authority, he was solidly sure, and it was not because
he was captain of his boat and knew how to sail it. Even at
Lezardrieux, Mr. Ricardo had discovered serenity and consequently a
good-humour in him which were new.</p>

<p>"Well, I shall get to the bottom of that," he thought
cheerfully. For Mr. Ricardo counted himself a very acute observer
of character.</p>

<p>Mordaunt had finished his letter by the time when the steward
told him his bath was ready. He folded it, put it into an envelope
and addressed the envelope. Then he got to his feet.</p>

<p>"You'll please begin breakfast as soon as it's brought in. I'm
not going to hurry;" and he suddenly turned to Devisher. "You may
have many troubles and few friends in front of you, for all I know.
I should like to help you because you came to me out of the
sea."</p>

<p>"Meerschaum," Devisher interposed, "but not half as
valuable."</p>

<p>Mordaunt was not to be diverted.</p>

<p>"But I shan't be in England. So I can't. But this man can, if
anyone can," and he handed the letter he had written to Devisher.
"He's old, crotchety, very much eighteen-seventy, but he's wise,
and if you tell him everything, he may throw you another life
buoy."</p>

<p>He waited for no answer. Devisher heard the door of the cabin
close whilst he was still reading the address upon the envelope. He
repeated the name aloud on a note of perplexity.</p>

<p>"Septimus Crottle, Esq."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, who had been rent between curiosity and the
obligation of gentlemanly reticence, gave a little jump. Devisher
seemed to become aware of Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Septimus Crottle?</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not."</p>

<p>"Yet you jumped when I read the name."</p>

<p>"Did I?" Mr. Ricardo beamed. He liked people to find
significance in his reactions.</p>

<p>"You did, but it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was nettled.</p>

<p>"It might matter," said he stiffly.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Devisher smiled as he spoke, but with a polite
indifference.</p>

<p>"Septimus Crottle is the owner of the Dagger Line of
Steamships," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>The indifference passed from Devisher's face.</p>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4"><small>CHAPTER 4</small></a><br>
<br>
"AGAMEMNON'S" BATH</h2>

<p class="first">Mordaunt stripped himself of his suede jerkin, his
high sea-boots, and the rest of his defences against a gale, and
slipped into the bath. After the buffeting of sea and wind, the
velvet caress of hot fresh water was a delight for a Roman emperor.
He shaved in it, soaped his limbs, and emptied his sponge again and
again over his head, wondering whether there could be anything as
good as living hard and bathing soft. But it was Agamemnon's bath.
It is true that no lady with a meat axe was secretly opening the
bathroom door, no lads of the village listening timidly in the road
were wailing "Ai, ai! That was a nasty one!" as the axe was heftily
administered. But it was still, in its way, fateful. Mordaunt lay
and relaxed his sinews and steeped his limbs and closed his
eyes&mdash;and opened them and closed them again. From far away
there was a splash of sculls, the grating of a rowing boat against
a ship's side, and then a voice, thin and small, as though it spoke
through a hundred folds of grey silk, but cheerful:</p>

<p>"So here you are, back again, Aggy boy."</p>

<p>Mordaunt assured himself solemnly that Aggy Boy was not a
name.</p>

<p>"I propose to see about that," and he was apparently still
proposing to see about it, when a hammering upon the door aroused
him. The steward's voice spoke urgently.</p>

<p>"Your breakfast's getting cold, Captain Mordaunt."</p>

<p>And Mordaunt realised that what was happening to his breakfast
had happened to his bath. He climbed out of it with a shiver, and
in a quarter of an hour, and in a shore-going blue suit, he was
sitting down in the saloon to a breakfast fresh from the stove.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo at the other side of the cabin was smoking a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Do you mind this whilst you're eating?" he asked, waving
it.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," answered Mordaunt. Suddenly he cried out: "Where is
Devisher?</p>

<p>"He has gone, I think."</p>

<p>Mordaunt rose and called up the companion for Hamlin, and Hamlin
came down, contentedly smiling.</p>

<p>"Mr. Devisher?" Mordaunt asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"It's just like this, sir. The Customs didn't come on board,
knowing of us well, but just passed the time of day. The two
gentlemen were down in the saloon, but soon afterwards the&mdash;I
can't fit my tongue to his name&mdash;the passenger from the
foreign ship comes up. I was hauling down the yellow flag, and he
asks what he should do now. I showed him the harbour-master's
office by the slipway, and he said he would go and report if he
could be put ashore. There was a boatman 'sculling about for a job
So I called him up to the gangway and off the gentleman went."</p>

<p>Mordaunt looked not too pleased.</p>

<p>"Just like that?" he said. "Without a word?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. He said you were in your bath and not to be
disturbed. He said he'd write to you."</p>

<p>Mordaunt laughed.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and went on with his breakfast. "After
all, he has saved us some trouble."</p>

<p>"And some delay," Hamlin added quickly. "We should have been
kept here all day, telling the same story over and over."</p>

<p>It was clear both to Mordaunt and Ricardo that the skipper had
edged Devisher over the yacht's side as soon as he got the chance,
guessing that the last place Devisher would visit would be the
harbour-master's office, or the office of any other functionary of
the port. Mordaunt, however, was really troubled&mdash;and once
more to Mr. Ricardo's surprise; Mr. Ricardo could see him at a
cocktail party a year ago, overshouting some other gossip to tell
his story with a sardonic amusement&mdash;lest he had let loose an
equivocal person, if not a bandit, on the world.</p>

<p>"Well, he has gone," said Mordaunt at last.</p>

<p>"With your letter to Mr. Septimus Crottle," Mr. Ricardo added;
and now Mordaunt laughed without any reservation.</p>

<p>"Old Septimus can take it," he cried. "Besides, I shall see
Septimus on Sunday night, and that's before he will."</p>

<p>Mordaunt took a cigar from a mahogany box and split the end of
it by the squeeze of his finger and thumb. He lit it and sat back
smiling, as if the picture of Septimus Crottle banished the picture
of a bandit.</p>

<p>"Do you know Crottle? The queerest old bird. Owns the Dagger
Line, and was once a commander&mdash;a tyrant in a reefer jacket
then, and a tyrant in a broad cloth frock-coat now. Choked off any
young men who came after one of his daughters, not because they
were gold-diggers, but because it was the business of maidens to
wait upon their fathers."</p>

<p>"Amiable patriarch," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Patriarch, yes; amiable, no," Mordaunt returned, mid laughed
again. "You should see him on his Sunday nights. In his glory! But
he's shrewd, too. And he'd do you a good turn&mdash;" Mordaunt
paused, "that is, if you acted on his advice, of course. You see,
he's never in doubt."</p>

<p>Mordaunt was no longer deriding the comic aspect of Septimus
Crottle. Mr. Ricardo suspected, indeed, that he was to hear the
explanation of that change in Mordaunt which had so perplexed him.
There was a confusion, a hesitation, in Mordaunt's manner.</p>

<p>"I never told you how I came across old Septimus, did I? But, of
course, I didn't. I was on this ketch in the Helford river. A great
sailor of small boats had built his home there, and a few of us
used to anchor about his house for his birthday. There were four or
five yachts anchored in the pool above and below and opposite to
Helford village. Septimus came in a schooner with more draught than
any of our boats, and anchored down the river at Passage. Well,
that evening&mdash;I don't know what made me do it&mdash;I had seen
him in the garden that afternoon, an old boy, straight as a
flagstaff, without any inhibitions; and there he was, once the
commander of a ship, now the owner of the Dagger Line. So that
night I sent an excuse from a party on one of the yachts, dined
alone, and afterwards sculled in my dinghy down to the schooner at
Passage."</p>

<p>He had found Septimus seated in the shelter of his deck cabin,
with a rug about his waist and a trifle suspicious that an
upstanding young fellow should row away from a golden company to
pass an hour with a solitary old crab-apple. Septimus Crottle did
not ask his new companion why, but he gave him a large Havana cigar
and, as Mordaunt drew a lighter from his pocket, he objected.</p>

<p>"Will you use the box of wooden matches at your elbow,
please."</p>

<p>Mordaunt turned round. A small table had been, placed
noiselessly beside his chair with an ash-tray upon it and a box of
Bryant and May's matches. So much reverence for a cigar seemed to
Mordaunt to call for a response, and as he smoked, it certainly
did.</p>

<p>"This really is a wonderful cigar, Mr. Crottle," said Mordaunt,
pitching his praise high.</p>

<p>"It is the best," returned Mr. Crottle, simply and sufficiently.
"It's mine."</p>

<p>Philip did not feel that his impulse had been fruitful. On the
other hand, the old man, with his sharp nose and his lean chin,
seemed quite content that the younger man should sit by his side
and say nothing. The tide sang against the planks of the schooner.
Up in the pool by Helford village the lights of the yachts threw
out from their skylights a glow of jewels cased in black velvet.
From one, a woman's voice, fresh and clear as a blackbird's in the
dew of the morning, soared in a delight which knocked against the
stars; and Mordaunt found himself pouring out in a low voice the
story of his distress, the twistings and turnings in a world where
he had lost his way.</p>

<p>He had resigned his commission when one of the youngest
captains, after the 1914-18 war, meaning to think over his life and
plan what he should do. He might go into Parliament. He had a house
and land in Dorset where there was an opportunity. Or he might go
into business&mdash;big business&mdash;in the City. Or he might
write&mdash;a comedy which would endure with "The Way of the World"
an epic, perhaps, which would stand on the same shelf with "The
Ring and the Book" a novel which would make people cry Fielding
Redivivus. Meanwhile, he did nothing. Some day he would begin, when
he was quite sure of the road which led to greatness. But meanwhile
he ran about from party to party, talking with other young men and
women of the fine thing he was going to do. But one after another
the young men passed him into a different and busier country. One
was elected to the House of Commons, and made a first speech which
was the talk of the town. A second wrote a play which stirred the
critics and filled the theatre for a year. A third wrote a book
which was bought as well as read. They would all come back, of
course, as their squibs flickered out. But they didn't come back,
and there was he, still wandering from party to party, jealous,
dissatisfied, hollow as an empty tin. Septimus Crottle listened
whilst the stars slid down the sky and the lights went out in the
yachts in the pool. Then he said quietly: "Great authors! To me
they are the loud-speakers of God." He turned to Mordaunt. "Are you
of their company?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" Mordaunt asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"They have their labels."</p>

<p>"For instance?</p>

<p>"They think less of the name they make than of the work they
do."</p>

<p>Mordaunt laughed curtly. Admit that, and he was ruled out! But
how could he not admit that?</p>

<p>"Well, I asked for it," he told himself, and thought that he
might just as well, like Oliver, ask for more. So he said, rather
arrogantly: "Perhaps there are other labels."</p>

<p>Old Crottle was quite unimpressed by his young friend's curling
lip.</p>

<p>"Of course." And after a glance at Mordaunt, Septimus looked out
over the dark water, selecting one which would be most
suitable.</p>

<p>"They don't nurse long grievances," he said. "They are too busy
creating. They curse and damn for five minutes and then they get on
with their job."</p>

<p>For the second time that night Philip Mordaunt took it on the
point of his chin. He took a whisky and soda afterwards and hoped
that he had not obtruded too long between Mr Crottle and his
repose.</p>

<p>Mr. Crottle, however, confessed to having been flattered by
Philip Mordaunt's visit.</p>

<p>"Besides," he said, standing at the gangway, "every-body enjoys
giving advice, as long as he's quite certain that the advice isn't
what the advised had come to hear."</p>

<p>Mordaunt halted on the first rung of the ladder and stepped on
board again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in some surprise, "the curious thing is that I'm
not discouraged. On the contrary, I am relieved."</p>

<p>The sense of relief stayed with Mordaunt as he sculled back to
his yacht, and was no less strong the next morning. Old Septimus
had banged the door on a good many dreams which of late were
darkening into torments. He had left Mordaunt to find another door
for himself, and it was evident to Mr. Ricardo that somehow
Mordaunt had succeeded.</p>

<p>Philip looked up at the clock on the wall behind the stove as he
ended his story.</p>

<p>"You'll want to catch the Torbay Limited," he continued. "There
it is, in Kingswear station. Hamlin will land you at the steps and
put your bag in your carriage. I am sorry that I couldn't give you
a better passage from France."</p>

<br>
DANIEL HORBURY</h2>

<p class="first">On that afternoon, Mr. Horbury, Member of
Parliament for the Kempston Division of London, walked from the
House of Commons to his office at a few minutes after four. He had
done two useful things for himself, and perhaps for his country. He
had asked a question and he had voted in a division. The division
took place on the Government's need to occupy the whole time of the
sitting, and was a daily affair, occurring just after questions
were concluded. Thus a shrewd man, and no one had ever denied
shrewdness to Mr. Horbury, could well within the compass of an hour
establish proofs of his stern determination to fulfil his duties
towards his constituents and the State. That the division was a
formality, mattered nothing; that he would not be present to vote
upon the serious question for which the Government claimed the
whole sitting, mattered less. He had had his name duly noted down
on the division list, and it was the division a day which kept the
opponent away and confirmed the constituents in the belief that
they had chosen the best sort of man to represent them.</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury, having thus done his duty, ambled across St.
James's Park to his office in King Street. He was a heavily-lipped,
short-legged, obese man who walked like a pigeon, crossing his
toes. He was not noticeable indeed unless he raised his head, and
then the big red face on its bull neck startled one. For his head,
down to a line just below the eyes, was massive as an emperor's,
and the strong eyes were noble. But below the eyes a curious blend
of the animal and the insignificant disgraced his features. His
nose, for in stance, was small and round, his upper lip long, and
the swollen jaw not so much massive as brutal&mdash;the jaw of a
great ape welded to the brow of a Caesar, set upon a torso of so
slovenly a vulgarity that the man almost escaped the curiosity of
the passers-by. But there were some to whom he was unknown, people
no doubt a little more sensitive than their neighbours, who felt a
chill if he approached, like that cold aura which, in the legends
of the Sabbaths, enfolded the person of Satan. Mr. Horbury walked
clumsily and slowly, round the water where the pigeons imitated his
progress, to the Marlborough Gate, through a dark and exclusive
arcade, and so to his fine panelled offices in King Street.</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury was uneasy. There was a certain danger to be
eliminated. Not so very serious a danger. Daniel Horbury was
accustomed to navigating shoals still more menacing than the shoals
of Lezardrieux. But, in order to eliminate the danger of this
afternoon, Horbury would have to relinquish a victim, a victim
plump and ripe, the fruit of a golden tree, and Mr. Horbury had the
greatest detestation of such sacrifices. He went through the outer
office into his own sanctuary. It was panelled with rosewood. The
deep arm-chairs were cushioned with a dark red damask. A great
walnut writing-table, shaped in an arc and fashioned in the days of
Queen Anne, with, the carved pigeon-holes and little doors of its
period, decorated the centre of an Aubusson carpet.</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury paused for a moment upon the threshold, consoled for
his uneasy reflections by the sheen and costliness of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>"Not many offices like this, Foster," he said to a clerk who was
reading out a list of names at his elbow.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Foster was an old-fashioned clerk from Gracechurch Street and
knew Big Business to be more generally associated with worn
linoleum, upright Victorian chairs, and ink-stained
writing-tables.</p>

<p>"Will you see Mr. Ricardo at five-thirty?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ricardo?"</p>

<p>Horbury became very still. Mr. Ricardo! He had never heard of a
Mr. Ricardo. And the unknown was always dangerous.</p>

<p>"It is not convenient," said Horbury. "This afternoon I don't
wish to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Horbury shut the door. On the writing-table lay the last edition
of the Evening Standard. He approached it with a careful
carelessness, for there are times when a prudent man will play-act
even to himself alone. He turned the pages as though they were of
little interest, and came willy-nilly to the shipping news. There,
at the very head of the column, the announcement stood:</p>

<p>"El Rey from South American ports passed Prawle Point at 6
a.m."</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury expected the announcement, yet he was taken aback.
Providence should have intervened, as Providence had often
dutifully done, in Mr. Horbury's affairs. There were, however,
occasions when Providence, though willing, wanted just a trifle of
help. Horbury must, in the parliamentary phrase, explore the
avenues. He went to a cupboard and opened it. Two shelves were
disclosed. On the first stood half-a-dozen glasses and a small
wire-cutter; on the lower half a dozen swelling bottles with a
golden-yellow foil guarding the mushroom-headed corks and a famous
year on a printed strip.</p>

<p>The pop of the cork was heard by the clerks and no longer
provoked even the office humorist to imitate the sound of liquid
hissing into a glass.</p>

<p>Horbury, in his sanctuary, drank half of his bottle. He lifted
the receiver from the hook of his telephone and dialled LED 0045.
In a little while he heard a door close noisily and, upon the
closing of the door, an eager, wooing voice.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Beautiful?"</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury smiled, showing all his teeth to the gums, but he
used a pleasant voice.</p>

<p>"No, not more so than usual. It's just plain Daniel Horbury
speaking."</p>

<p>At the other end of the line there was silence. Daniel Horbury
really smiled this time as he pictured to himself a man shocked
into speechlessness and grey with fear.</p>

<p>"You got my message?" Horbury continued.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sorry I use your private number."</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>Horbury made a joke. At least it seemed a joke at the time.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ricardo," he returned. It was the last name which he had
heard when he entered his office, and he rang off before another
question could be put to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Horbury finished off his bottle of champagne, leaning back
in his chair with his short legs crossed under his walnut table. He
was tempted, indeed, to commemorate the name of Mr. Ricardo with a
second bottle. After all, he was wont to argue, as long as you
don't begin before eleven o'clock in the morning, champagne can't
do you much harm. It gives a sparkle to your plans and delays their
over-hasty execution.</p>

<p>But to-day execution was needed. He pushed his chair back,
unlocked a drawer and lifted out of it a small chart set flat with
drawing-pins upon a thin ebony board. Five black pins were stuck in
the chart, and now Horbury added a sixth, just seven miles west of
Start Point where, at six o'clock on that morning, El Rey had
lumbered past the Prawle Signal Station on her journey to Thames'
mouth. Horbury replaced the map in the drawer. He then called up
his flat in Park Lane. He asked for his wife, and when she spoke to
him there was suddenly another man at Horbury's desk, one with a
laugh in his eyes as well as on his lips, and even a throb of music
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Olivia&mdash;that's you? Yes, and the sound of you drives
everything else out of my head&mdash;listen now, it's
urgent&mdash;oh, by the way, I heard you called beautiful less than
half an hour ago&mdash;oh, I needn't have rung you up to tell you
that?&mdash;you haven't got it at all&mdash;I heard you addressed
as Beautiful over a private line," and he chuckled comfortably.
There came back to him a tiny cry.</p>

<p>"You've been reading my letters!"</p>

<p>"Would I?" cried Horbury indignantly. "The number was given to
me by a Mr. Ricardo."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Ricardo. But don't go away. This is serious. We must go
down to Lordship Lane to-night. At least, I must, and I do hope you
will. We are free to-night, aren't we?"</p>

<p>In a room overlooking Hyde Park a woman half the age of the
Obese Romeo in King Street listened and smiled. "Yes, I'll come,"
and again Romeo was talking.</p>

<p>"We might sleep there, don't you think? It'll be the full moon.
You know how the big oaks with their black shadows make crazy
patterns on the meadow; and all the birds aren't dumb at the end of
August when you're near."</p>

<p>It was commonplace raillery, but whoever had seen Olivia
Horbury, with a tender smile trembling upon her lips, might well
have addressed her as "Beautiful."</p>

<p>"What's the plan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Will you drive the small car and pick me up here at
seven-thirty? We might dine at the Milan Grill, and get to the
house at half-past nine. And somewhere about half-past ten I'll
lock the front door, and we shall be alone in that lovely
silence&mdash;Beautiful."</p>

<p>He could hear the deep breath she drew and wanted no other
answer. He rang off and settled himself to compose a speech for the
September rally in his constituency. Then he bathed, shaved, and
dressed for the evening in a dinner jacket. He was hardly ready
before Foster announced to him that Mrs. Horbury was waiting for
him. He sent the commissionaire out to the car with the chart,
bidding him ask Mrs. Horbury to take care that the pins were not
displaced; and he took from a secret drawer in the Queen Anne
bureau a large sealed envelope which just fitted into the inside
pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>He slipped on his overcoat and stood once more upon the
threshold, looking here and there about the room. He was merely
admiring its sheen and costliness. It did not occur to him that he
would never see it again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6"><small>CHAPTER 6</small></a><br>
<br>
A WAKEFUL NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Ricardo arrived in London at half-past three.
He had slept in the train and was looking forward to giving his
friend, Monsieur Hanaud, over a charming little dinner for two,
quite a comical account of his night's adventure on the mail ship
Agamemnon, plying between Brittany and the Dart.</p>

<p>But, alas! though he rehearsed the scene diligently, letting the
real terrifying danger leak through the amusing episodes, making
much of the mate's miscalculation of the dawn, it was good work
wasted. Only Hanaud's suit-case arrived in Grosvenor Square in time
for dinner.</p>

<p>With the bag, however, there was a note of eastern abasement,
written hastily in pencil at Victoria Station. Hanaud had a
telephone call and a visit to make, and he must attend a conference
after that with Superintendent Maltby, who would keep him to
dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was torn between testiness and gratitude. On the one
hand he had, in order to fulfil the duties of a host, endured
through a long, dark night the impact of those black, snow-crested
waves. On the other hand, even as he spread his napkin over his
knees, his eyes closed and his head nodded. Mr. Ricardo, in fact,
was exhausted, and as soon as the formula of his dinner was
complete, he rang for his butler.</p>

<p>"Thompson, I shall go to bed. You will see when Monsieur Hanaud
comes in that he has everything he wants. You will ask him what he
would like for his breakfast. For me, after my usual breakfast
upstairs at eight, I shall come down at nine-thirty. Will you
please tell him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir." And Mr. Ricardo, revived by a glass of old
port, majestically ascended the stairs Not every one in Grosvenor
Square had passed the last night battling in a cockleshell against
a gale. There had been times when Monsieur Hanaud had treated him
lightly. Those times had gone. Let him give heed now! Let him give
heed and listen!</p>

<p>And how right Mr. Ricardo was! If Hanaud had received one hint
of the fine story of Agamemnon and his bath, he would have fled
from Superintendent Maltby and the dubious dishes of Soho to the
fastidious menu at Grosvenor, Square.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Ricardo, for all his fatigue, slept not so well. At some
hour, about which he did not trouble himself to be precise, he was
aroused by one of those penetrating conversations in whispers which
people use when they are trying not to wake their neighbours.</p>

<p>"Really, really," Mr. Ricardo murmured drowsily. "If they would
only talk quietly, I should still be asleep. But those gasps and
hisses remind me of the early days of the Underground, or of First
Nights when villains were villains. I can hear every word."</p>

<p>Addressing thus the emptiness of the room, he did gather that
Monsieur Hanaud had arrived and wished to be called early the next
morning.</p>

<p>"There is a telephone, of course, in my bedroom?"</p>

<p>A pause followed, a stately pause, meant to tell Hanaud exactly
where he got off. It was followed by Thompson's most glacial
voice.</p>

<p>"I think, sir, you must have forgotten that Mr. Ricardo is
sensitive to telephones."</p>

<p>"Ah! He would be!"</p>

<p>"There are three telephone instruments in the house, sir. One in
the staff's quarters on its own line. There is a second one in the
hall. From that, again, there is an extension to a third instrument
in the library. I think if you are intending to confer with
Scotland Yard during the hours of darkness, the hall telephone
would be the less disturbing."</p>

<p>Certainly, Mr. Ricardo reflected with pleasure, Thompson has the
most dignified modes of expression, and he fell asleep. But at some
later moment, he lay again in the half-way house between
consciousness and dreams and seemed to hear a muffled foot glide by
his door and down the stairs. But Thompson had been wrong.</p>

<p>Although the library was beneath Mr. Ricardo's bedroom, the
floor was of Cubitt's making, so that no sound reached to the room
above. On the other hand, the hall was less furnished, it was
hollow, and noises rose from it. Thus Mr. Ricardo heard a whirr,
and another, and another.</p>

<p>"The district," he thought.</p>

<p>Then came four twirls of the dial.</p>

<p>"The number," he continued, and, adopting Thompson's phrase, he
explained the matter with a smile "Hanaud is conferring with
Scotland Yard during the hours of darkness."</p>

<p>That Thompson, being wrong in the matter of resonance might also
be wrong in the destination of Hanaud's message, he was far too
sleepy to argue. He heard no words, he drifted away into another
world where Agamemnon rose out of a black sea with a huge telephone
machine in his hand, and cried "It's the dawning." Mr. Ricardo was
aware of nothing thereafter until the curtain-rings rattled and the
blinds were drawn up and his cup of tea was steaming by his
bedside.</p>

<p>He dressed deliberately. The mere fact that his friend had
arrived that morning neither hurried nor halted him. He descended
to his library at nine-thirty, and was surprised. For bending over
a copy of The Times sat Monsieur Hanaud, attired for an English day
in the country. He wore a rough suit of bright yellow, football
stockings, and mountaineering boots. To Mr. Ricardo his appearance
was delightful as well as amusing. Even the familiar blue
paper-case of black cigarettes was pleasant to his eyes, and he
sniffed the acrid fumes as a Malayan returning to his native
country after a long absence might sniff his first doerian.</p>

<p>"You have waited for me to share your work. That is kind."</p>

<p>But Hanaud, after greetings of a warmer character than Mr.
Ricardo was used to or, indeed, desired, exclaimed dolefully:</p>

<p>"But there is no work to share. There never was very much. Just
a little affair to be privately arranged which would do justice to
a certain Parisian and at the same time give me a chance to meet my
friend. But..." and before he could even shrug his shoulders the
telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"I tell you afterwards," said Hanaud as Ricardo lifted the
receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>Ricardo confirmed it with a nod. "The message is for you."</p>

<p>Hanaud took the receiver from Ricardo.</p>

<p>"'Allo, 'Allo! Ah, it is the admirable Maltby! Yes, I listen
with both my ears. So!"</p>

<p>And Ricardo saw the look upon his friend's face change from
attention to stupefaction. Hanaud held the ear-piece close against
his ear Finally he spoke. "In half an hour? Yes I will come. I
thank you" and very slowly he replaced the receiver upon its stand
To Ricardo, watching his friend's face, the room had lost its
comfort It had become very still, very cold.</p>

<p>"You knew him?" Hanaud asked.</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>"Daniel Horbury."</p>

<p>Ricardo started "I know of him," he replied. "Who in London
didn't?" He added cautiously: "I will give you, my friend, some
information. It is said that the police are on his heels."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no! The information is wrong," cried Hanaud. "He has no
heels. He is a shark."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo looked sourly at his friend from the Sureté. He must
always have the last word.</p>

<p>"Well, what has Daniel Horbury done now?" Mr Ricardo asked
sulkily.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is it," said Hanaud, nodding his head.</p>

<p>"What is what?</p>

<p>"He has cutted his throat."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo pushed back his chair. "Dead?</p>

<p>"Last night," Hanaud added gloomily. "I shall go to the house.
Yes. But is it worth while? To have Hanaud looking about the room?
Yes, the good superintendent thinks well of it. 'He may see
something, that piece of quicksilver, which we do not, to explain
this suicide.' But for me, it's a tragedy." He threw up his hands
in despair.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"There were two rogues who cheated a Parisian years ago. One
Horbury, the second a younger man just released from prison and
deported from South America. Without them both, we have not the
evidence. With them both, we don't want the prosecution. We want
the money repaid. Now Horbury has slitted his throat, and the man
from South America..."</p>

<p>"Bryan Devisher," said Ricardo carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hanaud, "that's the..." He stopped, staring at
Ricardo with his mouth open. Never had Ricardo enjoyed such a
triumph. His blood sang proudly in his veins. But outwardly he was
as negligent as before.</p>

<p>"What of Bryan Devisher?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He was drownded dead yesterday morning..."</p>

<p>"Off the Start Lighthouse from the ship El Rey," Mr. Ricardo
interrupted.</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>"I had made arrangements for a little talk with Devisher after
he had landed. Then we go to Horbury together and he pays the bill.
But now Horbury has slitted his throat and Devisher is
drownded."</p>

<p>"But Devisher is not drowned dead."</p>

<p>Hanaud looked at him with awe. Then he seized the telephone and
dialled with ferocity, speaking the while to his companion.</p>

<p>"You will come with me to the house of Daniel Horbury? Yes," and
into the mouthpiece "It is Hanaud. Could I speak to Mister the
Superintendent Maltby? "&mdash;and so again to Ricardo "You will
use your car, yes? And you shall tell me about this Devisher as we
go. Is that you, Maltby? I am staying here in the Grosvenor Square
with a dear friend who, I can tell you, has been very helpful to me
on many delicate occasions," and Hanaud did not even project a wink
down the mouthpiece. "Yes, I should very much like his assistance.
Yes, I stay with him in the Grosvenor Square when I come to London.
The most charming of hosts."</p>

<p>"Really, really," Mr. Ricardo tittered, blushing in his
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"His name?" Hanaud continued. "Mr. Julius Ricardo."</p>

<p>It seemed that something exploded at the other end of the
telephone. Was it laughter? Was it surprise? Was it joy?</p>

<p>"We come in his car, a Rolls-Royce. Very fast, very fine. Give
me the address again." Hanaud wrote it down on a pad of paper and
rang off.</p>

<p>"What a coincidence," cried Mr. Ricardo, beaming. "Devisher, me,
you, Horbury!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Hanaud, jeering like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"It might happen once in a hundred times," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"But it does happen every day once in a hundred times," Hanaud
replied, and he hurried off to dress himself in less outrageous
clothes, whilst Mr. Ricardo called up his Rolls-Royce, No. 2, to
the door.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7"><small>CHAPTER 7</small></a><br>
<br>
THE LITTLE AFFAIR THREATENS<br>
TO BECOME THE BIG AFFAIR</h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Ricardo was a trifle uncomfortable as he drove
with Hanaud to the Embankment. Police authorities did not, as a
rule, endure easily the presence of laymen at their investigations,
however simple. But he had heard the voice of Superintendent Maltby
as he spoke over the wire. It was hearty. He had jumped at the
name. "Mr. Ricardo! You are staying with Mr. Ricardo in Grosvenor
Square? Bring him along, of course, my dear Hanaud. The very
thing!"</p>

<p>Hearty&mdash;yes. Enthusiastic even. But perhaps a little
unsettling. He reflected, however: "It may be that he has heard of
me giving Hanaud now and then a tiny help where social knowledge
was needed, or some delicate impression was to be felt. One never
knows. But I was conscious of quite a shock. Really, I might have
been a criminal;" and Mr. Ricardo uttered a little laugh, an uneasy
little laugh, as though the great doors of Wormwood Scrubs were
opening before him.</p>

<p>"And now," said Hanaud, tapping him upon the knee, "you tell me,
do you not, of Bryan Devisher?"</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>The car was crossing Battersea Bridge. The sunlight was
glittering upon the water. Seagulls wheeled and swooped in the
inimitable beauty of their flight. Above them and about them was
summer, its scents, its warmth; and against that bright background
Mr. Ricardo told the story of how the waif from the sea came aboard
the Agamemnon.</p>

<p>"In my mind, for it would not have been polite to have said it
aloud, I called him meerschaum," said Mr. Ricardo, who had done
nothing of the kind. "See? A piece of meerschaum."</p>

<p>Hanaud, however, was indifferent at the moment to Ricardo's
witticisms. He sat upright, his broad, shaven face very serious.
"No, it would not have been polite to have said anything so
stinging aloud," he replied, his mind far away from his words, and
he turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"This man Devisher. Did he really fall overboard?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo replied slowly "It was thought by the men on
Agamemnon that he took a chance."</p>

<p>"With the odds against him?" said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Hanaud dug his hands into his pockets He was obviously puzzled.
"It is not pleasant, of course, to be landed as an undesirable at
Gravesend. But, after all, he would be alive."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud took his hands from his pockets and threw them
up. "It is something to be alive."</p>

<p>"There might be other charges against him," Ricardo suggested,
"waiting for him at Gravesend He told us that the name upon his
passport was false."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud waved the suggestion aside. Some other question
was troubling him. "And he went ashore at Dartmouth alone, with
fifteen pounds in his pocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he go to the harbour-master's office?"</p>

<p>"He landed at the slip close to the harbour-master's office, but
I think that if he had gone to the office, some official would have
come off to ask whether we corroborated his story."</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head in agreement. Then he asked: "Do you
think the Captain Mordaunt was really asleep in his bath?"</p>

<p>The question had occurred to Mr. Ricardo, but he had made up his
mind.</p>

<p>"I do. It is true that Mordaunt was in a hurry to lay up his
yacht for the winter. But he really meant that Devisher must make
his position clear to the authorities."</p>

<p>Hanaud, however, was not so confident. "It will be. Yes. No
doubt. But I should like to converse a little with the Captain
Mordaunt, none the less."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo shook his head. That would not be so easy. On
Sunday, it was true, Captain Mordaunt would be present at one of
the famous evenings of Septimus Crottle. But Julius Ricardo did not
belong to that circle, and did not propose to do a gate-crash with
Hanaud at his elbow. He said: "There, my friend, I cannot help
you."</p>

<p>"It is a pity," Hanaud returned, staring out of the window. And
suddenly he turned back upon Ricardo. "This Torbay train? He
arrives in London at half-past three?</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ricardo.</p>

<p>"And you travel on him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you take the luncheon in the dining-car? Yes?</p>

<p>"No. I slept in my compartment."</p>

<p>"Was Devisher upon that train?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was a long train with many carriages. I never
saw Devisher."</p>

<p>"So that, for all you know, my friend Ricardo, Bryan Devisher
may have arrived in London at half-past three yesterday afternoon.
It is agreed?</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Hanaud twisted his body and shook his big shoulders and made the
grunts and moans of discomfort.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," he cried to Mr. Ricardo, who didn't see at
all how it was. "There is my little affair. I wind it up and I take
a vacancy. Good! If it be. But it isn't. My friend, I do not want
my little affair to become your big affair. No."</p>

<p>"And you're afraid of that?" replied Ricardo in surprise.</p>

<p>Hanaud laid his hand impressively on Ricardo's arm.</p>

<p>"So afraid that it gives me the gaiters," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo translated correctly, but, looking into his friend's
troubled face, knew that this was not the moment for correcting the
translation.</p>

<p>"You had better tell me what your little affair is."</p>

<p>"I will," Hanaud replied as he pulled his blue-paper packet of
cigarettes from his pocket, "whilst we smoke the Maryland." He
offered the packet to Mr. Ricardo, who recoiled from it as if it
were a dish of poison, and then, having lit one, continued: "It was
seven or eight years ago. Daniel Horbury was in a smaller way of
business, but he had his fingers in a hundred pies, and you know
that a day comes when there must be real money on the table. Mr.
Horbury knew the date of that day. Ten thousand pounds on the
table&mdash;and he had not one sliver."</p>

<p>"Stiver," Ricardo corrected.</p>

<p>"As I said, one sliver," Hanaud agreed equably. "Mrs. Hubbard,
she was naked. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Positively." said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Good! But he has associates, not clerks exactly, and not
partners. Strap-hangers, you call them."</p>

<p>"And sometimes hangers-on," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Amongst them, Bryan Devisher. A valuable one for the Daniel
Horburys. He had good manners, good looks, youth, and he was not
odd. Public School and the entrance into houses of which the good
Horbury only knew the portico. You follow me?</p>

<p>"I am alongside of you," Ricardo observed with his eyes on the
window. Battersea Park had been left behind. The car had skirted
the Park, crossed a main road, dived southward into a street where
little houses with little gardens were succeeding terraces. They
might reach the end of their journey before Hanaud had reached the
beginning of his. "You would be wise to continue."</p>

<p>"I go." Hanaud bounced up and down on the seat, marshalling his
facts. Then he raised an imperative finger.</p>

<p>"First an historical set of pearls disappears. Second, Mr.
Devisher sells them to a jeweller, Gravot, in the Place Vendôme,
for ten thousand pounds. Daniel Horbury has his ten thousand pounds
on the table. Act one! See?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo nodded his head.</p>

<p>"But the loss of the pearls is discovered," Hanaud resumed, "and
Gravot of the Place Vendôme must give them back. For that is the
law. Gravot gives them back, but he is out for Devisher's
blood."</p>

<p>"I see that," Ricardo agreed.</p>

<p>"But there is no Devisher. He has gone. One of Horbury's little
pies was a revolution in Venezuela. It was needed. The revolution
fails. Devisher finds himself in the Castillo del Libertador, and
is there for life, or for as long as Vicente Gomez lives. So at
once there is difficulty. There is not, without Devisher himself,
proof that the ten thousand pounds Horbury put upon the table were
the ten thousand pounds paid by Gravot of the Place Vendôme."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;there's the jeweller..."</p>

<p>"Down the drain, as you say in your picturesque way. Exactly, my
friend. Oh, how quick you are! That Mr. Ricardo&mdash;who shall get
by him? He wait&mdash;with his glasses not straight upon his nose.
Then he pounce&mdash;the jaguar! The criminal? Poor fellow! It is
over." Mr. Ricardo wriggled and blushed and laughed&mdash;a small,
modest laugh.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, yes," he said, playing a little tune upon his
knees with his fingers. "It is over."</p>

<p>"But my Gravot," resumed Hanaud after his flatteries had been
enjoyed, "with him the years have passed. He wants now, not the
blood, but his good money. So we try, as I told you, for a friendly
settlement."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo frowned over the problem very astutely.</p>

<p>"Yes. No doubt nowadays Daniel Horbury could command ten
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Yet he slitted his throat," replied Hanaud quickly. "Explain
that to me. After all, it is not an ordinary behaviour."</p>

<p>"It is not," Mr. Ricardo agreed.</p>

<p>It was not reasonable, he thought, even if Hanaud had come.</p>

<p>"By the way," he asked, "did Horbury know that you had come to
London?"</p>

<p>Hanaud was emphatic. Superintendent Maltby knew and perhaps one
or two officials of his service. And a lawyer. But no one else.</p>

<p>"As I told you, we did not wish the prosecution. I called on the
solicitor Preedy, who was employed in the original case, when I
left Victoria Station."</p>

<p>Again Mr. Ricardo was silent. The little houses with the little
gardens were giving place to big houses with big gardens. There
were big trees, too, chestnuts and oaks and beeches, holding up
their thick lacework of leaves and branches, so that even upon the
roads there was the cool refreshment of a green world. But there
was clearly no comfort for Monsieur Hanaud in the pleasure of the
morning.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "Devisher&mdash;Bryan Devisher&mdash;did he
talk to you on the yacht?</p>

<p>"A little, yes."</p>

<p>"For an example?"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was being bustled, an experience which he disliked
extremely. There was something said. It was at the back of his
mind, almost tangible, really tangible if he wasn't bustled. And
suddenly he had it. "He said that after the revolution failed, he
might have got away; but he was betrayed."</p>

<p>"By Horbury?" Hanaud flashed the question at him.</p>

<p>"He did not say, but he looked as if he knew. Yes, I remember,
he was whiter than ever, his eyes staring and his lips working with
a curious little smile." And Mr. Ricardo shivered suddenly, as he
had not shivered in the saloon of the yacht when the words were
spoken.</p>

<p>Hanaud leaned back in the car. After a little while he said
slowly: "He took a chance. Perhaps he took that chance, not because
I or Maltby might be waiting at Gravesend for El Rey to anchor, but
because Horbury might be&mdash;or shall we say Horbury's friends?
Do you see?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo saw very clearly not merely Devisher's staring eyes
and twisted smile, but saw them lost in a great crowd on the
arrival platform of a railway station. Three-thirty, the Torbay
Limited! Devisher had the advantage of the big rusty steamer by an
afternoon&mdash;and a night. He had the advantage of Horbury by an
afternoon&mdash;and a night&mdash;of Horbury, who had sold him into
six years of hell in the Castillo del Libertador.</p>

<p>"But I do not want my little affair eight years old to widen
himself out into the big case of Horbury," cried Hanaud, spreading
out his arms in an extreme vexation. "No! Saperlipopette, I do not
want it!"</p>

<p>He took a black cigarette from his blue-paper packet and lit it,
and as he snapped the lighter he shook off from his big shoulders
the suspicions which had troubled him.</p>

<p>"However, we fright ourselves for nothing at all. Men like
Horbury! They commit such follies. They are often in the odd
street."</p>

<p>"Queer street," Mr. Ricardo corrected.</p>

<p>"So I said," observed Hanaud. "But you will be disappointed,"
and he shook his head sadly at his friend. "That Mr. Ricardo! He
likes his bit of crime," and with a laugh he nudged Mr. Ricardo in
the ribs.</p>

<p>There were few things which Ricardo detested more heartily than
these familiar nudges with the elbow. As a rule he left a
sufficient space between himself and Hanaud for them to miss him.
But they were travelling in his second Rolls-Royce, a smaller
limousine, with no arm-rest to protect him, and the elbow jolted
him unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I am not the only one who will be disappointed," he said
tartly.</p>

<p>"Who else?</p>

<p>"Gravot of the Place Vendôme," said Ricardo. Hanaud smiled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my friend. This Daniel Horbury had a wife. We
shall see. She might wish to make the amends."</p>

<p>A wife! It was the first time that Mr. Ricardo had ever heard of
Horbury's wife. His horses, to be sure! But a wife! Mr. Ricardo was
conscious of a sinking at his heart. Had he known that a wife would
be present, questioned, harassed, maybe in tears, he would perhaps
have sent Monsieur Hanaud on his quest alone. But he had himself to
come, he reflected; the police wanted him at their side. He
recalled the hearty invitation of Superintendent Maltby over the
telephone, but now he recalled it with relief. Certainly Mr.
Ricardo could hardly have refused.</p>

<p>"England expects..." he said to himself&mdash;was there a cliché
with which he was unfamiliar?&mdash;and he sought an anodyne for
his uneasiness in a curious speculation. Horbury had married either
in his youth, when the passions were hot and the world just waiting
to be turned over on its back like a turtle; or in his maturity,
when the years had given him a plump and purselike semblance. In
the one case he would have married a girl of his own station, but
worse educated; in the other a white-fingered daughter of the
counties, disdainful and greedy.</p>

<p>In neither case should I care a tuppenny damn, Mr. Ricardo
thought, and giggled at the common but expressive phrase.</p>

<p>The car was passing upon its right hand the playing fields of a
great school. The school buildings, a fine central hall linked by a
covered way with two big blocks of classrooms, all in deep red
brick and white stone, faced a second main high road. And this
road, too, the motor-car crossed. As it entered a narrower,
gently-sloping avenue, Monsieur Hanaud read a name upon a tin
plate. "Lordship Lane. It is here."</p>

<p>On their left hand, large villas lay hidden amongst trees,
behind fences and high laurels. On the right a meadow, set here and
there with a great oak or a chestnut, sloped up to a low hedge and
the flank of a two-storied small white house. Behind it rose a
screen of holly, so thick, so high, that it made a curtain quite
isolating the house from its neighbour.</p>

<p>"White Barn," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>A policeman saluted. The car turned in at the gate and stopped
in the gravelled court in front of the door. Already two cars were
parked there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8"><small>CHAPTER 8</small></a><br>
<br>
WHITE BARN&mdash;THE LOCKED DOOR</h2>

<p class="first">White Barn was a pleasant oblong unpretentious
house without gables or ornaments. It had neither basement nor
front steps, and on the upper side, between the tall hedge and the
house, a garage had been built without spoiling its symmetry. It
was of two storeys only, a small manor house of some two hundred
years of age. The door was in the centre of the house with a large
window on either side, and it was ajar. Hanaud pushed it open.</p>

<p>"It is permitted...?" he asked.</p>

<p>A man of middle age, with a pair of sharp grey eyes set in an
inconspicuous face, stepped forward.</p>

<p>"It is desired."</p>

<p>"That you, the Superintendent, should be here.."</p>

<p>"Is a compliment to France."</p>

<p>These politenesses having been exchanged, Hanaud introduced Mr.
Ricardo, and the Superintendent's inconspicuous features became at
once so vivid that, according to Ricardo's fancy, they claimed the
attention of the world.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ricardo! It is a pleasure. We shall not ask you anything
for the moment, but later you will, I am sure, help us."</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby's eyes were widening alarmingly as they
looked over Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"This is Detective-Inspector Herbert," he said, pointing to a
second officer in plain clothes, "and Sergeant Hughes." This was a
slight, smiling man in uniform who moved round between Mr. Ricardo
and the door.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Mr. Ricardo, but he was not comfortable. It
seemed that he had tumbled from the high pulpit of Investigation
into the dock. Before he could remember any crime which he had
committed, the offensive elbow caught him again sharply in the
ribs.</p>

<p>"Really, really," he exclaimed in a fluster. He had almost cried
aloud, "Not guilty, m'lud."</p>

<p>Hanaud however, quite unconsciously rescued him from his
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"It is charming this house, yes?" he said, and Mr. Ricardo
cordially agreed.</p>

<p>He had, indeed, been surprised when he first saw it between the
trunks of the trees, by its plain, unbedizened beauty; and the hall
matched it. It was in the shape of a capital T. Where Mr. Ricardo
stood, with his back to the front door, he looked straight down the
long leg of the T, past the staircase, to the door of the service
quarters. The broad cross-piece in which they all stood stretched
from side to side of the house. On each side of the front door a
big window looked upon the courtyard, and on each side, facing the
window on the inner wall, was a mahogany door; that upon Mr.
Ricardo's right, or London side, leading to the room which
commanded the garden and the meadow to the edge of the Turnpike
Road; that upon his left, into some chamber hued with a subdued
green light by the holly hedge. The floor of the hall was a dark
polished oak, whose severity was relieved by two or three Eastern
rugs. A Sheraton sideboard spread its elegance under the right-hand
window, a small writing-table received light from the left, and
between each mahogany door and the edge of the long passage, a
Chippendale chair, upholstered in a dark red silk, kept a comely
balance.</p>

<p>"So! The Horburys lived here?" said Hanaud. "I should have
thought Park Lane, perhaps, or Piccadilly."</p>

<p>Ricardo smiled. He, too, had found something inconsistent
between White Barn and the hot, equivocal, noisy career of Mr.
Daniel Horbury, financier.</p>

<p>"He did live in Park Lane," Superintendent Maltby agreed. "As
for this little house, it may be that Mrs Horbury&mdash;but we
shall hear."</p>

<p>A door behind the staircase opened as he spoke. It was obviously
a second door from that room upon the left-hand side which
shortened the journey to the kitchen. A middle-aged woman, broad
and stout, with a cotton frock and a large apron in front of it,
waddled into the passage carrying a breakfast tray and vanished
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wallace," explained Maltby. "She is the char woman. She
comes every day at eight, airs the rooms and makes the beds when
they have gone to town. She was with Mrs. Horbury when we
came."</p>

<p>"You have seen Madame Horbury?" Hanaud asked.</p>

<p>Maltby shook his head. "I thought it would be more comfortable
for the poor lady if, first of all, we got the body out of the way
and the photographs and the finger prints taken. We will hear now
what Mrs. Wallace has to tell us."</p>

<p>The charwoman came along the passage. Her eyes were red as if
she had been crying and her face was mottled; but now that the
shock of her discovery was dulled, she was beginning to see herself
as the one without whom the story could not be told at all. The
Superintendent asked her to seat herself in one of the chairs and
she did with a sniff which might have been gratitude for his
consideration or grief for the loss of "the master".</p>

<p>"They didn' live here 'xacly," she said, "but they use to be
here when they was firs' married, and Mr. Horbury kep on, the
house, sort of sentimental. And every now and then, especial in the
summer, they'd dine early in London and she'd drive him down in the
car. Mr. Horbury, he didn' drive at all but she's a beautiful
driver. I expec' what with parties and speeches and goin's-on, they
came down to be quiet-like together."</p>

<p>"They were fond of one another?" the Superintendent asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, special," replied Mrs. Wallace. "Beauty and the Beast, I
use to call 'em, though it seems sort o' sacrilegious now. You
could hear them laughin' in the mornin' gay as gay, and as I says
you don't go laughin' proper with people before breakfast unless
you've got hearts attune," she added surprisingly.</p>

<p>The Superintendent, whilst applauding Mrs. Wallace's philosophy
of love, led her to describe the habits of the household.</p>

<p>"Did you know when Mr. and Mrs. Horbury were coming down for the
night?" he asked. "Did they telephone, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Mr. Horbury, he said that was making arrangements.
What he wanted was or-gan-i-sation." She brought out the big word
in cautious syllables. "Oh, he was a one for organisation, was Mr.
Horbury. He said without organisation he wouldn't have a bottle o'
Pommery '06 in the 'ouse or a penny-piece in the bank. How I did
laugh, sir, 'im puttin' a bottle of champagne before money in the
bank, and so did he when I pointed it out to 'im."</p>

<p>"Yes, that must have seemed very funny to Mr. Horbury," said the
Superintendent dryly. "Now come to last night."</p>

<p>"I did what I always did," she replied. "There are electric
fires in the bedrooms and everywhere except the garden-room. I put
the logs there and the paper all ready to light. In the kitchen I
prepared a primus stove with some fresh eggs and bacon sliced ready
in a glass jar, and rolls and butter and corfy, if they should want
a little supper, as it were. Plates and cups and saucers and
glasses and knives and forks, of course. There were some bottles of
the Pommery in the cupboard. They never drank nothing but the
champagne and never more than one bottle, though I think he drank
most o' that. Just brushed her lips with it, as you might say.
Often and often I've found her glass half-full and the bottle empty
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Did they bring friends with them?" asked Maltby, who now let
her ramble on as she willed that he might get lights from as many
angles as possible on this tragedy.</p>

<p>"No, no, never," she replied. "They just come here to be easy.
They just come to be quiet-like together. So I put everything ready
and shut up the house and went away at five o'clock as I always
did," she resumed, "and I came back at eight o'clock punctual this
morning and let myself in with my latchkey."</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" the Superintendent asked, and she produced a
small Yale key on a ring. Maltby balanced it for a moment in the
palm of his hand. "How many are there of these?"</p>

<p>"Three, sir," she answered. "Mr. and Mrs. Horbury each have
one."</p>

<p>Maltby nodded his head and gave the key back to her. "Now, when
you got in?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace drew a great breath. She was clearly going to put
over a big performance, thought Mr. Ricardo. Not one horrific
detail was to be omitted. She had gone at once to the kitchen. The
primus stove was unlit, the eggs were still in their paper bag, the
bacon in its glass jar, the butter in a curious glass dish with a
lid, standing in a glass saucer. "Irish, Mr. Horbury says.
Whatifer, he calls it and what's it fer, I calls it. Leadeny stuff.
It wouldn't do for the village, I can tell you. When we wants
glass, we wants glass, if you understand me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do understand," replied the Superintendent cordially.
His voice sounded as if he couldn't have endured a piece of Watifer
in his house for a minute.</p>

<p>"So everything was untouched," Mrs. Wallace continued. "I hangs
up my coat and bonnet on the peg behind the door, and I lights the
stove and puts a kettle of water to make myself a nice cup o' tea,
and I says, 'Maria, here's a neasy day for you.' But I hadn't
hardly spoken the words when I noticed that the drinkin' glasses
weren't there. Two there should have been, and two there weren't.
Moreover the cupboard door was open. Generally it's locked, with
the key in the lock. There were two glasses missing but no bottle
missing. That weren't like Mr. Horbury. Allus took the bottle into
the garden-room, he did. 'So they're here arter all,' I says, 'and
lucky I was to put the kettle on to boil for their mornin' tea.' I
hadn't a suspicion in my mind. There! Not one."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Why should you?" the Superintendent asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace had run back along the passage to open the windows
and air the garden-room. She pointed dramatically to the door in
the inner wall opposite to the hall window on the right of Mr.
Ricardo.</p>

<p>"It was ajar," she said, "and the lights still burning." She had
flung the door open with a gesture worthy of Mrs. Siddons, she had
advanced a step, and she had seen "the poor gentleman" still
sitting in his chair, but his body stretched across the little
table in front of it, the blotting-book pushed forward over the
edge, his arm outstretched. His throat was gaping, and just
underneath the outstretched hand, lying in a great pool of blood,
was the knife.</p>

<p>"A horrible thing with a long blade and a handle pale blue, just
like Cambridge under Hammersmith Bridge. I shrieked," she cried,
and her arms whirled in the air. "Never had I seen such a sight.
Everything went black. I tottered. I was goin' to faint, I was,
when I remembered that poor woman upstairs. 'My dooty,' I says to
myself and after clawing to the door a bit to steady myself, I
stumbled upstairs to their bed-room door. And it was locked."</p>

<p>"Locked?" Hanaud cried suddenly in a sharp voice, and bowed his
apologies to the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Locked," replied Mrs. Wallace, glaring at Hanaud, "which it
never had been before. Never! I used to' take their mornin' tea
into them regular as if they were the King and Queen. And now the
door was locked."</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded, but he was puzzled. Here was something which
needed explanation. Meanwhile he could not reconcile that locked
door and the wife behind it, with Maria's story of the couple
coming down alone to be 'quiet-like' together in their suburban
solitude and 'gay as gay.' the next morning.</p>

<p>"What did you do when you found the door locked, Mrs. Wallace?"
the Superintendent asked, keeping her to her story.</p>

<p>"I beat on it," she replied. "I cried 'Open, please! There's
horrors, Mrs. Horbury. Oh! the poor gentleman.' And I heard Mrs.
Horbury say, in a low voice and quite from the floor, as it was:
'Wait! I'll let you in.' She seemed to bump against the door and
unlocked it. But as she unlocked it, she said again 'Wait! Wait!'
and I heard her stumbling into her bed. Then at last she said,
'Come in!'"</p>

<p>"And then?" Again it was Maltby who urged her.</p>

<p>"When I went in&mdash;it was terrible. There was the twin bed
which Mr. Horbury used, turned down for him, and his fugiamas, as
he called them&mdash;Japan, you know&mdash;spread out as I had
spread them, and Mrs. Horbury in her bed with the blankets up to
her chin, white as a sheet and shivering&mdash;oh, as if she was an
iceberg in the Arctic Ocean. 'Oh, you poor, poor darlin', I said,
just as if we were both of the same stature. I told her the truth
and she said, still all frozen and her teeth chattering, 'Get me my
dressing-gown. We must ring up the police.' We came down the stairs
together. I pointed to the garden-room and said in a whisper, 'It's
in there.' But she shook her head and rang up the police
station."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the message?"</p>

<p>Inspector Herbert of the local constabulary answered for Mrs.
Wallace. "We took it down." He turned towards Sergeant Hughes, who
turned back the leaves of a notebook and read aloud: "This is Mrs.
Horbury speaking from White Barn. Will you please send the proper
people up here? My husband has died&mdash;by violence."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hughes then took over the history of events from Maria
Wallace, the charwoman.</p>

<p>"The message was quite clear and quite without hysteria, but the
voice was urgent and distressed. We sent at once what men we
had&mdash;photographer, finger print man&mdash;and we rang up the
police surgeon, Dr. Claxton. The french windows into the garden
were locked and it looked as if Mr. Horbury had committed suicide.
Since Mr. Horbury was a Member of Parliament and well known in
business circles"&mdash;Sergeant Hughes dwelled for a little longer
than need be upon that useful phrase&mdash;"we rang up Scotland
Yard and tried to get in touch with Superintendent Maltby, who had
not yet..."</p>

<p>"That's enough about that," the Superintendent interrupted with
some hauteur.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said the Sergeant and crossed out the
offending lines.</p>

<p>The Superintendent coughed. "Of course," he explained, "if one
sits up all night..."</p>

<p>"With a sick friend," the Sergeant interpolated, his eyes again
stolidly upon the wall, and the Superintendent, who possessed a
sense of humour, made a good mark against the name of Sergeant
Hughes.</p>

<p>"By the time Superintendent Maltby arrived the drudgery had been
completed," Sergeant Hughes read. "The police surgeon, Dr. Claxton,
had met the late Mr. Horbury's doctor, Cornish, at White Barn. They
made a cursory examination to be certain that life was extinct, and
after the police had taken the necessary measurements, Dr. Claxton
conveyed the corpse in the station ambulance to the mortuary,
having arranged with Dr. Cornish to join him later with a view to a
full post-mortem investigation. Whilst the body was being removed,
the finger-prints and photographs taken, Inspector Herbert asked
Dr. Cornish to look after Mrs. Horbury and prepare her for an
interview with Superintendent Maltby, who would doubtless wish to
ask her some questions."</p>

<p>"Up till now, then," said Maltby, "no one has received any
account of what happened last night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Beyond that Mrs. Horbury locked her door," said Mr. Ricardo,
and, though the fact was known be the separation of this fact from
the rigmarole of Mrs. Wallace gave to it a new significance. There
was a pause, even a stiffening of attitudes, a silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, however, had up to this moment experienced no
flashing revelation which he wished to pass on to his colleagues.
From the first aspect of White Barn he had suffered a confusion. He
could hardly reconcile Horbury with this house, and still less with
his retention of it as a refuge where he and a wife could be
"quiet-like together." But when he had at last accepted these
details, he found them weakened, if not contradicted, in that Mrs.
Horbury had gone up to her bedroom alone and locked the door. Had
they quarrelled, Ricardo wondered? Hardly enough to account for
Horbury's suicide, in any case. Horbury and his wife&mdash;the
homely background to the flamboyant career&mdash;Pommery '06 at
Bentano's in the Strand and domestic felicity in Lordship Lane. For
a student of life, a fascinating case; but, since his wife had
locked the bedroom door, an enigma.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by Hanaud in a most deferential voice.
"May I ask a question?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Maltby answered. "We shall welcome your assistance,
although I fancy we shall find the Horbury affair not too
difficult."</p>

<p>"I thank you," Hanaud answered.</p>

<p>How charmingly correct they both were, Mr. Ricardo reflected, as
Hanaud now turned to the charwoman.</p>

<p>"Was it by means of this telephone that Madame Horbury summoned
the police this morning?"</p>

<p>A telephone machine was standing almost at Hanaud's left hand on
the writing-table beneath the window.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Hanaud looked at the handle of the receiver and with a little
bow to Sergeant Hughes: "I see there are traces of the powder for
the finger prints."</p>

<p>"We found some old marks of Mrs. Wallace's fingers which she let
us take and a new, quite clear, set, which we take to have been
made by Mrs. Horbury," answered Hughes.</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;and Hanaud turned back to the charwoman&mdash;"is
this the only telephone in the house?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Mounseer. It is a French gentleman, isn't it? This is
the one which I use for ordering things&mdash;coal and food, and
suchlike. But there is an extension in the garden-room which Mr.
and Mrs. Horbury use when they want to use it. But that's only onct
in a blue moon."</p>

<p>"But they are rung up, the bell rings here?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Maltby with a touch of impatience. What on
earth had the telephone here to do with the case of a man who had
cut his throat in the garden-room? The charwoman, however, was all
for giving information. When would life have another thrill for her
like this?</p>

<p>"Yes, Mounseer, the bell rings here and in the garden-room and
you can answer from either."</p>

<p>"You are bound to hear it, then, wherever you are?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace laughed.</p>

<p>"You'd have to be as deaf as a post not to hear it," she said.
"Bad as a firebell, I says. I can shut the kitchen door never so,
but let that bell go off, and there's no being quiet-like until
you've answered it."</p>

<p>"Quiet-like," said Mr. Ricardo solemnly, with a nod to the
charwoman. "That is the key word."</p>

<p>"To what?" asked the Superintendent. Mr. Ricardo had not an
idea.</p>

<p>But Hanaud hurried to his rescue. "Yes, my friends," he declared
with a serious face, which somehow frightened everyone else in the
hall, "I think we shall find that there is much which is too
quiet-like in the whole of this affair."</p>

<p>"The locked door?" Maltby suggested.</p>

<p>"That is one thing," Hanaud replied, "but only one thing."</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. Then Maltby, shaking from his shoulders
some horror which he did not wish to believe, moved. "Let us see
this garden-room."</p>

<p>He walked to the door upon the right hand, opposite to the
window under which stood the Sheraton sideboard. It was a thick
mahogany door with a glass handle. He took out his handkerchief and
wrapped it round the glass. But Sergeant Hughes interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"The only prints upon that handle were the same as those clear
prints upon the telephone on the writing table."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Horbury's then?" said Maltby.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And one set only?" suddenly Hanaud interposed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"As she went upstairs&mdash;to lock her door? Yes, no doubt,"
cried Hanaud. "But when they arrived in the evening, eh, my friend?
To spend an evening quiet-like together. Which of them opened this
door?"</p>

<p>"No doubt Olivia Horbury." said the Sergeant, politely
condescending.</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt," cried Hanaud, and there was no politeness at all
in his voice. "And she was kind enough to save us trouble by
placing her fingers on the handle in exactly the same position as
she did when she drew the door to, to go upstairs to her room and
lock herself in. That is curious, no?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hughes looked uncomfortable. Superintendent Maltby was
troubled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't understand that," he remarked unhappily. "It
might, of course, happen by chance, once..."</p>

<p>And Monsieur Hanaud cut in: "Yes, my friend, once&mdash;when the
moon is blue."</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby, with a gesture of annoyance, threw open
the door of the garden-room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9"><small>CHAPTER 9</small></a><br>
<br>
THE UNSPOKEN WORD</h2>

<p class="first">They entered an oblong room with panelled walls
enamelled white. One or two girandoles and one or two water-colours
decorated the panels. The carpet was thick and of a warm wine-dark
red, and the curtains and pelmets of heavy silk matched it in
colour. A white marble fireplace had a panel of blue Wedgwood
figures below the mantelshelf. Mr. Ricardo was the last to enter,
and, standing by the door, he shut his eyes tight and asked of
himself: "What message has this room for me?"</p>

<p>Apparently it had none. Isolate himself as he might, no message
shot tingling across his mind. And, besides, Mrs. Wallace, the
charwoman, was talking volubly.</p>

<p>"The room was lit and the curtains drawn as though it was still
night, and there was the poor gentleman sprawled across the table,
and gore&mdash;you wanted to be a butcher born, you did, not to
feel sickish. Then I screamed and ran out of the room."</p>

<p>It was not wonderful to Mr. Ricardo that she should feel
sickish. He conceived that if his mind had been less alert, he
might have felt a trifle sickish himself. Upon his right hand were
two french windows opening on to a green and pleasant garden with
the great meadow beyond a low hedge. Although birds sang no more,
rooks wheeled and cawed about one of the oaks and, as the branches
swayed, the sun threw an ever-changing pattern of draperies upon
the grass. An idyllic place where lovers could be quiet-like
together&mdash;especially at night with the curtains drawn and an
aromatic log fire burning on the hearth. Now the small table was
pushed forward, and blood had splashed even on the enamelled wall
and coagulated in what seemed an enormous pool upon the carpet. A
blotting-book bound in a buhl cover, ornamented with
mother-of-pearl, had tumbled off the table and stood on its edges,
like a child's tent, on the rim of the dried pool. Beside it were
the splinters of a broken wineglass. Mr. Ricardo could almost see
the heavy figure of the man slumped over the table and the right
arm flung forward just over the spot where a cardboard cover had
been placed to mark the position where the knife had fallen.</p>

<p>The table stood close to the fireplace with a chair, against the
wall behind it, in which Horbury had been sitting. It was small and
there should have been, one would have thought, letters, papers of
some sort, scattered upon the floor. For a fountain pen with its
nib exposed had peeped out beneath his arm.</p>

<p>"There were no papers," Inspector Herbert explained. "It struck
me as curious."</p>

<p>The Superintendent walked to the fireplace and, going down on
his knees, poked amongst the ashes. Then he sat back upon his
heels. "Yes, it's curious," he said slowly. "If he burnt papers, he
did it thoroughly. There's nothing here but an old butt of a cigar.
He must have tossed that into the fire, and then put an end to
everything."</p>

<p>Hanaud, for his part, was more concerned with the appointments
of the room. The table at which Horbury had sat was on the further
side of the fireplace from the door, and still further along the
wall, in the corner, a cushioned chair with arms was placed. It
looked diagonally across the room towards the door, and the cushion
at the back of it was crumpled. A long table stood against the wall
running between that corner and the windows. Opposite to the
fireplace was a sofa with a back, and upon that, too, there were
cushions which had been disarranged. At the end of it a round
mahogany table was placed, and on it was a glass half full of
champagne.</p>

<p>"It seems that at one moment Madame Horbury sat here with her
glass of champagne at her elbow and, as that good woman tells us,"
Hanaud said with a glance towards the charwoman, "she took no more
of it than she usually did. And there upon the floor are the
splinters of Horbury's glass. But why should Horbury, of all men,
have put the bottle back in the cupboard?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby nodded his head. "We don't want to make
difficulties for ourselves, do we?" To him this was a plain case of
suicide by a man of a very stormy history, who might well have
found himself with no option between death or a long term of penal
servitude. "These are small matters."</p>

<p>"Yet there is another. May I again interfere?"</p>

<p>Hanaud was all smiles and deference and entirely at Mister the
Superintendent's disposal. Mister the Superintendent, indeed, was
beginning to wonder whether he had been wise to invite this burly
Frenchman. But he tried not to show it.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said. "My dear Hanaud, we know of your
painstaking methods. A hair on a coat-sleeve, a key lost or
found..."</p>

<p>"Lost or found!" cried Hanaud. "Was ever anything more properly,
more profoundly said? My dear Monsieur!"</p>

<p>He walked lightly across the room to the table against the end
wall. On it stood a telephone instrument of the modern kind, ear
and mouthpiece in one, resting on a cradle, and a dial at the foot
of the instrument. But it was not the telephone which had attracted
him. Almost, but not quite, behind the machine, something had
gleamed.</p>

<p>"Yes, another little matter, and that, too, out of place," and
Monsieur Hanaud was not the man to keep a note of triumph out of
his voice. He held up a bunch of keys, picking it up daintily by
the ring.</p>

<p>"You will observe that there is a Yale latch-key on the ring. Is
not this the bunch of keys which the good Horbury carried on a
chain in the pocket of his trousers? Yes? It seems so. Perhaps
Mister Herbert will tell us."</p>

<p>"Them's his keys," said Mrs. Wallace. "I've seen them over and
over."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hughes, at a nod from Maltby, took the keys and went
out of the room. When he returned, he addressed himself to
Maltby.</p>

<p>"It is the key of the front door, sir."</p>

<p>Maltby crossed to the side table and, taking a piece of chalk
from his pocket, held it above the spot where Hanaud's eye had
discovered the bunch.</p>

<p>"That the place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Maltby marked the place and both men stood for a moment in a
perplexity. After all, why should Horbury have taken the bunch off
the chain on which he usually carried it?</p>

<p>"If the lock of the door had been stiff, for instance," said
Hanaud. "Yes, it would have been easier to turn it:"</p>

<p>"But the lock wasn't stiff," replied Hughes. "And why should he
put the bunch on the table?"</p>

<p>All three men stared again at the chalk mark on the table.
Another little thing. But an unusual thing. And therefore needing
explanation.</p>

<p>"It's certainly odd," Maltby exclaimed. He turned rather
savagely upon the charwoman. "You never saw them off the
chain?"</p>

<p>"Never," she declared. "Cross my thumbs!"</p>

<p>"But it might happen?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace sniggered. "And it might rain pigs and chocolate
creams," she answered, "but it don't."</p>

<p>"Of course "&mdash;Maltby disregarded the charwoman's nettled
rejoinder&mdash;"Horbury might have wanted to telephone. Standing
up straight after dialling, the edge of the table may have pressed
the bunch into his thigh He may have taken the keys from the spring
hook of the chain and tossed them where they fell. A little
fanciful?" he asked of Sergeant Hughes, who looked more than a
little troubled by this sudden high flight of his superior
officer.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not fanciful at all," he replied, "but"&mdash;and he
blurted out the uncontroversial fact&mdash;"that telephone wasn't
used last night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace sniggered again. But it was Hanaud who spoke, a
little startled perhaps and certainly perplexed.</p>

<p>"I should like to be very sure of that," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"You may be," said the Sergeant. "That&mdash;well, that handle
thing was tested for prints. There wasn't a mark of any kind upon
it."</p>

<p>"No, and there wouldn't be," cried Mrs. Wallace, folding her
arms across her body. "Not if it wasn't used last night. Yesterday
morning I dusted it, I did, and when I dusts, I dusts."</p>

<p>"Did you take the receiver from the cradle?"</p>

<p>"That I did," she answered. "I holds the spring down, see? With
my left hand. Then I takes off the handle thing. Then I slips one
of the two telephone books on to them supports to keep them down.
Then I dusts the thing thoroughly&mdash;earpiece and mouthpiece and
all&mdash;and slips it back again."</p>

<p>She contemplated Monsieur Hanaud with an aggressive face, but he
answered her with a bow which was quite disarming. "Madame, I do
not doubt you for a moment. The whole room is an example for
housewives."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace relaxed from her indignation; and the next moment
she smiled. For Sergeant Hughes added his tribute of praise.</p>

<p>"That's true," he said. "I never saw furniture so clean. There
are marks on Mr. Horbury's chair and table made by him, as we know,
and a few on the mantel shelf and the arm of the settee, where Mrs.
Horbury sat with her glass of champagne. They correspond with the
prints on the telephone in the hall. But, apart from those, nothing
at all."</p>

<p>"Except, perhaps," Hanaud suggested, "some on the arms of that
chair in the corner where the cushion is disarranged?"</p>

<p>Hughes was for the moment taken aback.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he answered after a pause. "That's queer, that is. I
was here whilst the finger-print men were at work. There were no
prints on that chair at all. It may be that the cushion was thrown
on to the chair, perhaps by Horbury himself from his chair behind
the table."</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that Hanaud had lost interest in the
matter.</p>

<p>"Very likely," he said with a shrug of his shoulders and a nod
of his head. "Little things. As the Superintendent tells us wisely,
we must not make too much of them."</p>

<p>A bell rang in the passage and the knocker rattled upon the
outside door.</p>

<p>"It will be the doctor," said Herbert, and Maltby nodded to the
charwoman.</p>

<p>"Will you let him in, please, and then we need not keep you from
your duties."</p>

<p>The charwoman brought into the parlour a minute afterwards a
big-boned, loose-limbed man, with a genial, bluff manner, and a
suit of dark clothes even looser than his limbs.</p>

<p>"Dr. Claxton," said the charwoman.</p>

<p>"And very many thanks for your help, Mrs. Wallace," Maltby said
gratefully. "When I ring, will you ask Mrs. Horbury if she is ready
to receive us?"</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Wallace was out of the room, Claxton held out to
Maltby a narrow longish cardboard box. "The Inspector at the
station wanted you to see this."</p>

<p>Maltby took off the lid and all could see the gleam of a
long-bladed knife. Hanaud took a step towards it and Maltby made
him an apology.</p>

<p>"I forget my manners. Dr. Claxton, I present you to Monsieur
Hanaud of the Paris Sureté."</p>

<p>"It is an honour," returned Dr. Claxton with a keen glance at
the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Ricardo," added Maltby with a wave of the hand a little
too careless.</p>

<p>But Dr. Claxton turned with a smile and an extended hand.</p>

<p>"Of Grosvenor Square?" he asked, and lifted Mr. Ricardo into a
heaven of delight. He wondered whether, if by any chance he should
ever fall ill, it would seem unusual if he were to send to Lordship
Lane for a doctor. He had no time to solve this important problem
at the moment. For Maltby was kneeling down by that clotted mush of
blood on the floor.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought the old man had so much blood in him?"
Mr. Ricardo observed, quoting from Macbeth.</p>

<p>"But he wasn't old," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ricardo was quoting from a standard case before the days of
finger-prints," said Claxton.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo heaved a sigh of pleasure. He had been feeling
rather chilly in that room. Even Hanaud had been too engrossed in
some troublesome thoughts of his own to keep his friend constantly
within the consultation. Now he had an ally.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Maltby over his shoulder. "The prints on the
knife handle?"</p>

<p>"Horbury's," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Maltby removed the cover from the blood upon the floor. The
shape of the long knife was as clearly moulded in red as if it had
been made in a sculptor's clay. Maltby took his handkerchief from
his pocket and carefully lifted the knife from the box. It fitted
exactly in the space. To Mr. Ricardo it looked the most murderous
of weapons; one side of the blade was thin and sharp as a razor,
the other more than usually broad and heavy, as though it had been
loaded; and what gave to it a curiously sinister aspect was the
pale blue colour of the handle. It was a weapon of death imitating
a child's toy. Even so unimaginative a woman as Mrs. Wallace had
noticed especially that gay bright colour&mdash;"Cambridge passing
under Hammersmith Bridge."</p>

<p>"One of the occasions, I suppose," Mr. Ricardo ruminated, "when
Oxford had been embarrassed by their long list of wins and didn't
try."</p>

<p>He did not pursue this engaging topic for Hanaud turned a pursed
and frowning face upon the doctor.</p>

<p>"There seems to be no hinge where the blade joins the handle of
the knife."</p>

<p>"There is none."</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head. He glanced sharply at Ricardo and so
back again to the doctor.</p>

<p>"I see. South American, do you think?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent once more began to show signs of impatience
at Hanaud's excursions beyond the strict boundaries of this
garden-room; and Dr. Claxton drew back from the dangerous game of
conjecture.</p>

<p>"No knowledge. No theories," he announced curtly, and Maltby
nodded. "That's sound. Speculation may be the soul of conversation,
but it's a will o' the wisp to a Superintendent of Police."</p>

<p>Hanaud was not at all abashed. He was darting glances on the
floor, on the settee, on the mantelshelf, as if he had not heard
one word of the rebuke.</p>

<p>"If it is your hat you look for, my friend you left it in the
hall," Maltby continued sweetly, and Inspector Herbert did audibly
snigger. Hanaud smiled apologetically.</p>

<p>"My hat? Yes, there he is. He will not run away. But, Inspector,
the sheath, he does."</p>

<p>"Sheath!" Herbert exclaimed.</p>

<p>"To be sure. The knife, since he does not shut himself, will
carry himself in a sheath. It was on the body perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor and "No," the Inspector agreed. Maltby
cried: "There is a drawer in the table at which Horbury sat. We may
have overlooked it."</p>

<p>He went behind the table and pulled out the drawer with a little
more violence than it needed.</p>

<p>"No," he said and he acknowledged Hanaud's question with a stiff
bow. "But it must be somewhere;" and at once everyone in the room
began to search for it.</p>

<p>"It might be of soft leather," said Herbert.</p>

<p>"Or of stiff leather," said Mr. Ricardo helpfully. He was down
on his knees with the Sergeant. They peered under the chairs and
tables, they turned up the edges of the carpet, they swung back the
window curtains. Maltby picked up the blotting-book, shook it out
and replaced it. Hanaud pushed his hand down at the side and the
back of the settee. The few things which Herbert had taken from the
dead man's pockets&mdash;a small diary, a gold pencil, a few
half-crowns, a black letter-case with some pound notes in the
partitions, the steel chain with the tab at the end for the
trouser-button&mdash;were all arranged upon the mantelshelf. But of
any protection for that deadly weapon with the blue handle, there
was nowhere any sign.</p>

<p>"It is just another of the little things which do perplex me,"
said Hanaud, and then the doctor took him up.</p>

<p>"But there is no doubt that this was the knife he used," he
argued. "No shadow of doubt! He had drawn it from left to right
across his throat. He had severed the carotid artery. The blood
must have burst from it in great gouts, as though it had been
pumped. He would have died very quickly."</p>

<p>"When?" Hanaud asked sharply; and Mr. Ricardo with a jerk drew
himself erect.</p>

<p>He knew that here was the question to which Hanaud had been
working up from the first moment when he had entered the room.
"When?" Just that! All the rest, the small particulars discovered
which made suicide a verdict difficult to accept, were the knitting
of a pattern to which the answer to his question was the key. He
had no wish, as Ricardo knew, to see his small affair of the pearls
merging in the ever so much bigger crime of murder. But the plain
reason for his life had driven him irresistibly. Murder must be
revealed any where, upon whomsoever the blame fell. When did
Horbury die then? At what hour? Answer!</p>

<p>The doctor answered:</p>

<p>"It is not always possible to be exact. But within limits one is
justified, and in this case Mr. Cornish, a famous surgeon, agreed
absolutely with me. We examined the body of Daniel Horbury in the
mortuary at ten o'clock this morning and we agreed that death had
taken place between ten and twelve hours before."</p>

<p>"Not after midnight then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not after midnight," Doctor Claxton stated firmly,
"and not before ten. We cannot be more precise."</p>

<p>Hanaud's eyes dropped from the doctor's face, and he stood so
with his eyes on the ground. Then he slipped into an armchair below
the fireplace and stared moodily into the ashes. He was not acting.
His disarmament was as apparent as his honesty. There was no one in
that room who interrupted him, no one indeed who stirred.</p>

<p>"My friend, I beg your pardon," he said to Maltby very gently.
"Yet perhaps, in the end, you will say, 'That Hanaud! He was the
nuisance, but he helped.'"</p>

<p>"I should not say he was the nuisance," Maltby returned with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Although one might think it," Hanaud answered. "But I will not
keep you on the tip-toes. No! I was very anxious yesterday to
settle my little dispute with this Horbury. So, on arriving in
London by the Continental train, I rang up his office. I did not
give my name, but I said my business was urgent. Horbury was not in
his office, but the telephone number of White Barn was given to me.
I dined with you, my friend Maltby, and I went home to Grosvenor
Square. But I could not sleep. I said to myself, 'That is a
slippery one, that Horbury! How do I know that he has not caught
the night train to Rome?' There are reasons besides why he might.
So at half-past two in the morning..."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five minutes to three," Mr. Ricardo interrupted.</p>

<p>"You heard me?"</p>

<p>"I heard you go down the stairs and call up a number on the
telephone, but what number I did not hear."</p>

<p>"Good! I have the corroboration," cried Hanaud. "This was the
number&mdash;White Barn."</p>

<p>"You called up this house?" exclaimed Maltby.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"At twenty-five minutes to three in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you got an answer?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what happened. I got cluck-cluck, cluck-cluck, like
a clock. Then that ceased. So someone had lifted the receiver from
the cradle. I said 'It is Mr. Horbury? Excuse please the hour. It
is most urgent.' There was no answer, and I began to wonder whether
the receiver had not been lifted just to stop the bell ringing
through the house. Then, after a moment or two, I heard a little
rattle as the handle was replaced on the spring&mdash;and the line
went dead."</p>

<p>Again Hanaud received the tribute of silence. Then the
detective-inspector suggested: "Mrs. Horbury perhaps?"</p>

<p>Hanaud shook his head.</p>

<p>"You heard the woman Wallace. There are only two instruments in
the house. One in the hall, the other here. On the telephone in the
hall, there were old prints of hers and one set&mdash;mind, only
one set&mdash;of Mrs. Horbury's, made this morning when she rang
the police."</p>

<p>Nobody wished to accept the consequence of his argument. Not
even Hanaud himself. He looked at the bright and inviting room with
its enamelled walls, its deep cushioned seats, the delicate tracery
of the plaster on the ceiling and the long windows opening on to
trim lawn and wide meadow, where the sunlight and the oaks played a
swiftly-moving game in black and gold.</p>

<p>"So then?" Maltby challenged, himself the first to grasp the
nettle.</p>

<p>"So then," Hanaud repeated, "at half-past two this morning, in
this room&mdash;perhaps the lamps were lit and the curtains drawn
and the fire bright upon the hearth; perhaps the room was dark and
the windows open to the shadows and the silver, as now to the
shadows and the gold&mdash;someone stood by that table and with a
covered hand lifted the earpiece, mouthpiece, what you will, and
held it,&mdash;not to listen to a message, but to stop the call
jangling through the house."</p>

<p>"Some one?" Herbert repeated. "Mrs. Horbury then?"</p>

<p>Hanaud replied thoughtfully: "Yet I do not think it was Madame
Horbury. Imagine it! Horbury has been dead for three to four hours.
Someone in this room hears the telephone, lifts the receiver, does
not answer, and replaces it." He pointed across the room to the
table. "Was it then, do you think, that someone tossed the keys on
the table?"</p>

<p>Maltby bent down.</p>

<p>"You have in your mind, Monsieur Hanaud," he stated rather than
asked, "a picture, and perhaps the name of that someone."</p>

<p>"Picture, no! Name, perhaps yes. There was one who&mdash;and
again I say, perhaps&mdash;had great reason to hate Daniel
Horbury."</p>

<p>A look of bewilderment passed over Maltby's face.</p>

<p>"Devisher?" he said.</p>

<p>"Bryan Devisher," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;we both know. At Gravesend, he was not on
board. He was lost at sea during the night."</p>

<p>"And that also is true. But he could have been in this house
last night. Let Mr. Ricardo tell us."</p>

<p>He swung round upon Ricardo with the outstretched forefinger of
melodrama; and everyone turned about and stared, incredulous, ready
at a word to contradict.</p>

<p>"Really, really," Mr. Ricardo stammered. He swallowed hurriedly.
He was not averse to his proper share of the limelight. But he
preferred that it should glow brighter and brighter upon him
gradually, that he should, as it were, slide into it. But to stand
one moment obscure, and the next moment lit up like the ghost of
Sir Marmaduke&mdash;well, really, really! It was the penalty one
paid for the friendship of Hanaud. However, it was an hour to be
registered. He looked at his watch He gave himself twelve minutes,
and as the clock struck twelve he finished.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the superintendent warmly. "That is very
important, and, if I may say so who have listened to many stories,
very closely told."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was delighted and would have been more delighted
still if Hanaud had not with a bow and a smirk taken the
commendation to himself. "Really I might be his ventriloquist's
dummy," he reflected acidly.</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby moved to the fireplace and rang the bell.
"There is no evidence that Devisher was here," he said.</p>

<p>"None," Hanaud agreed.</p>

<p>"We shall hear now what Mrs. Horbury has to tell us," said
Maltby and the charwoman opened the door.</p>

<p>"Will you ask Mrs. Horbury if she will receive us?" he asked
and, when she had gone upon her errand, he resumed. "It will be
best, I think, that no mention of Bryan Devisher should be made, no
hint given of that story of the sea which Mr. Ricardo has told to
us."</p>

<p>These words were not a hint. They were a definite order, and
Maltby looked to each of his companions in tutu for a promise of
obedience.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said and Mrs. Wallace came back with a message that
Mrs. Horbury would receive them at once. Mr. Ricardo hung back, but
Maltby took him by the arm with a smile.</p>

<p>"You have been very good. You never spoke out of turn. Will you
be my secretary for half an hour? Let us go!" And they filed out of
the room.</p>

<p>The one word murder, of which all had for so long been thinking,
had never once been spoken.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"><small>CHAPTER 10</small></a><br>
<br>
OLIVIA</h2>

<p class="first">She was standing in the room with the windows
looking upon the holly hedge. But there was space enough between
the hedge and the windows for the sunlight to fall golden upon the
gravel path between and to fill the room with a serene and quiet
light.</p>

<p>"I don't want to distress you more than must be," said Maltby
gently; and Olivia Horbury gravely acknowledged his courtesy.</p>

<p>"You have your duty, Superintendent."</p>

<p>She was tall and dressed in a coat and skirt of dark blue and a
white shirt with a collar. Her hair, which was black but had the
blue sheen of a raven's wing, was parted in the middle and drawn
softly back, masking the tops of her ears. Beneath its heavy mass
her face was very pale and her eyes, enormous under the long,
upturned lashes, were black as night, too, and as night
unfathomable. Prepared as Mr. Ricardo had been for someone of a
closer kinship with the house than with her gross bandit of a
husband, he was none the less surprised. The broad forehead, the
wide spacing of her eyes, the delicacy of nose and nostril, the
short upper lip and the curve of cheek and jaw gave her beauty; but
the supple grace of her movements, the slenderness of her figure,
the long white hands, made her exquisite besides... She was neither
of the Lambeth Walk nor of bankrupt gentility. He was inclined,
with a rare spurt of fancy, to think that she was born at Sèvres,
and there had got lost amongst images with the colours of pale
flowers as lovely as herself. There Horbury, on an off day between
Longchamps and Auteuil, bought her, noticing that she was alive and
so worth more of his money than the others. Her voice, however,
upset Ricardo's fairy tale. For it was not silvery and light, as it
should have been, but full and low.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down, Superintendent&mdash;and your friends, of
course."</p>

<p>Was there a hint of a question in her use of the word friends?
Mr. Ricardo hoped not. The very last thing for which he wished was
to be turned out of the room. The Superintendent took it up
indirectly.</p>

<p>"I don't want any misunderstanding, Mrs. Horbury," he said. "You
have a perfect right to refuse to tell me anything, with or without
a solicitor present. The only person you will definitely be called
upon to answer is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The coroner," she interposed. "But I have nothing to hide from
you, Superintendent."</p>

<p>She sat upon the opposite side of the table, the bright green
hedge beyond the window behind her. The men began to take their
seats opposite, like so many directors at a board meeting. But
Superintendent Maltby was not satisfied. He had his country's
belief in fair play, except, perhaps, so far as Bryan Devisher was
concerned.</p>

<p>"This," he said, laying his hand for a moment on Hanaud's arm,
"is Monsieur Hanaud of the Sureté in Paris. You might object to his
presence. I am in your hands."</p>

<p>Olivia Horbury's eyes moved slowly towards the burly Frenchman.
There was no hostility in them, no change in the stillness of her
face.</p>

<p>"I think, of all men, Monsieur Hanaud should be here," she said.
"He is far more in this "&mdash;she paused, as though she hated to
use high-sounding words&mdash;"tragedy, than perhaps he knows."</p>

<p>Hanaud was disconcerted. He looked inquiringly at Mrs. Horbury;
he bobbed his head at her; he sat down rather heavily.
"Dee-flated," said Mr. Ricardo, but he only said it to himself.</p>

<p>"I should be obliged, madam, if you would tell us what happened
here last night," said Maltby, and the detective-sergeant at once
produced a notebook and an indelible pencil.</p>

<p>"Beginning with&mdash;?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Your reason for spending the night at White Barn. I understand
that it was not unusual for you and your husband to come here
unexpectedly. But was there yesterday any special reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered at once. "Dan rang me up yesterday afternoon
from King Street."</p>

<p>"King Street, St. James," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"From his offices?"</p>

<p>"Yes Witherton's Rooms, where, in the thirties of last century,
the select dined and gambled, and yesterday Daniel only drank a
glass of Pommery '06 and gambled."</p>

<p>A slow and wistful smile changed surprisingly Olivia Horbury's
face. It lost its hard calm and with the calm something of its
pallor. A rose-leaf pink softened it and a tender humour shone in
her eyes. She might have been watching, with more amusement than
disapproval, the antics of a not very well-behaved boy.</p>

<p>"And he was in some trouble?" Maltby asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo saw the tears suddenly flood her eyes and glisten on
her lashes. He heard her voice check and, for a second,
tremble.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Would I drive him down to White Barn? So many dangers
had there conjured themselves into nothing. Of course, I would!
There were no special arrangements to be made. Daniel changed into
his dinner jacket at the office. I picked him up there and drove
him to the Milan Grill, where we dined. It was, perhaps, half-past
seven. He told me nothing at dinner, but drank&mdash;see, I am
frank with you, Superintendent!&mdash;more than he usually did. We
left the hotel at a few minutes before nine. I noticed the clock in
the small hall. It was the time when the theatres were filling. But
beyond Battersea Bridge there was very little traffic, and I
reached White Barn well before half-past nine."</p>

<p>"You noticed no one in Lordship Lane whom you knew?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Horbury looked at Maltby in surprise. "No. There was no one
to notice," she answered at once. "Not a soul. The gate was open.
It is left open. I drove the car into the space in front of the
door and left it so that it could be backed into the garage. Dan
got out and opened the door of the house with his latchkey."</p>

<p>"That was on his ring of keys?" Maltby asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olivia, dwelling for a second on the monosyllable.
"No doubt."</p>

<p>"And he carried the ring in his pocket on a chain?"</p>

<p>The even flow of Mrs. Horbury's narrative was checked. She did
not take her eyes from Maltby's face, but suddenly they were
wary.</p>

<p>"As so many people do," Maltby added in an indifferent
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose he did," she answered. "Anyway, he opened the
house door and came back to the garage."</p>

<p>It was noticeable to Mr. Ricardo, who prided himself
considerably upon the nicety of his observation, that she who had
been so slick&mdash;he used in his thoughts that unpleasant
word&mdash;in her statement of quite unimportant details, such as
the exact time at which they dined and the traffic on the roads,
was now not so sure, was wondering; not what the answer was, but
what it was politic that it should be.</p>

<p>"And I suppose Mr. Horbury backed the car into the garage and
locked it up again?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"He could do that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He never drove a car because his mind ran off to
business in the midst of Piccadilly, but he could drive," Mrs.
Horbury answered. "Whilst he was putting the car away, I went into
the garden-room and lit the fire. It was dark, but the moon was
like gold in a clear dark sky, and I thought what a pity it was to
close out the last of the summer nights. But Dan liked to be what
he called snug&mdash;fire burning, blinds down, curtains drawn, and
a glass of the only wine in the world at his elbow." Again that
half smile of amusement and affection gave to her face
tenderness.</p>

<p>"You did share a bottle of champagne yesterday evening, didn't
you?" said Maltby. "And by share, I don't mean divide."</p>

<p>Olivia Horbury bowed her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not at once. Dan came in just as I had finished
lighting the fire."</p>

<p>"You had left the door open?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I closed it after he had entered. He flung himself in
his chair at the back of the table. He pulled his fountain pen out
of his pocket and opened the blotting-book."</p>

<p>"Before you go on, may I interrupt?" Maltby asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"What had Mr. Horbury done with his coat and hat?"</p>

<p>Olivia looked up at the ceiling as if trying to remember. Then
her eyes were suddenly turned to Mr. Ricardo. Whether she saw him
or not, he could never be sure.</p>

<p>"I don't think he had a hat at all," she explained. "But he
certainly came away from the Milan Grill with a brown overcoat over
his dress-jacket. I expect that he hung it up in the hall."</p>

<p>"He wasn't wearing it, then, in the garden-room?"</p>

<p>"No, I should certainly have noticed it if he had been."</p>

<p>He had taken off his overcoat before he had entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, you are both in the garden-room," Maltby resumed.</p>

<p>"My husband was in trouble. He said that, to put the lid on,
Monsieur Hanaud was on his way from Paris with a criminal charge
against him which, even if he got the verdict, would ruin his
career."</p>

<p>Hanaud sat back in his chair with a look of absolute incredulity
upon his face. "But, madame, this is a lunacy. It was a small
affair for him, for me, too, Hanaud. A small conversation, an
injustice put right..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Horbury replied coldly: "My husband did not take it so
lightly, Monsieur Hanaud," and Hanaud threw up his hands.</p>

<p>It was Maltby's moment to take charge again.</p>

<p>"From whom did Horbury hear of Monsieur Hanaud's visit?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "He was in great distress and I didn't
press him with questions. He jumped up after that and said that a
glass of wine might help us."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Maltby, leaning forward a little. He glanced quickly
at Detective-Sergeant Hughes, who was holding his notebook below
the table upon his knees. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Daniel fetched two glasses of champagne from the kitchen and
drank his own with one gulp."</p>

<p>"Just the two of you standing in the garden-room?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I remember Dan saying with a sort of hysterical laugh:
'That isn't the proper way to treat a wine like that. Upon my word,
I deserve all that Hanaud can do to me!"</p>

<p>"He said that?" exclaimed Hanaud without any apologies to the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"I remember it clearly," Mrs Horbury declared; and once more
Hanaud sat back in his chair, but this time with such a look of
admiration upon his face that Mr. Ricardo was quite at a loss to
understand it.</p>

<p>"It could not be disputed," he said, bowing to her; and now she
was for a moment disconcerted. "So Horbury does a thing which he
had never in his life done before. He put a bottle of Pommery '06
half-full back in the cupboard."</p>

<p>Mr Ricardo was indignant. Hanaud had no manners. He was French,
of course. You had to take that into account. But if ever a man had
called a charming woman a liar to her face, that man was Hanaud of
the Paris Sureté. He just didn't believe that Horbury had put back
the half-empty bottle into the cupboard. Unusual? Perhaps. People
did unusual things&mdash;he himself, for instance, who, only two
nights ago, had crossed the Channel in a cockle-boat. However,
Olivia Horbury had resumed her story, and it was more pleasant to
listen to her low and melodious voice than to reflect how curiously
wrong Hanaud could be when he was removed from the perhaps rather
sordid purlieus of Paris.</p>

<p>Mrs Horbury was saying: "Daniel was less discouraged. He had got
out of scrapes just as awkward before. He supposed it was just
returning to this house which so comforted him&mdash;but he
wondered at times whether the big fight was worth all it
cost&mdash;" and then, without a break in her voice, without any
warning change in feature or expression, she uttered a little cry
and covered her face with her hands. She bent her head forward and
the tears ran between her fingers and splashed upon the table.
There was no sound from her throat of a sob, but she pressed her
hands tight, although they could not hold back her tears. Not one
of those who saw her but was distressed. So calm and sedate she had
been, she had even laughed wistfully once or twice as she spoke of
Daniel; and then came this flood of grief as though a gate had
burst.</p>

<p>Maltby spoke with compassion: "I am sorry. One cannot help these
interviews being distressing. Perhaps you would like us to
wait..."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried with a sudden violence. "Let us finish!" She
took her hands away from her face and dried her eyes and swallowed.
Then she made her apology for her outburst. "You are right. It is,
of course, disturbing. But I am almost at an end. For, seeing that
Daniel was in an easier mood, I went up to bed."</p>

<p>"And what time would that be?" Maltby asked easily. "Did you
notice?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; There's a clock upon the mantelshelf of the
garden-room. It was half-past ten."</p>

<p>"You expected him to follow you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "He gave me three-quarters of an hour, as a
rule. But it had been a tiring evening, and as soon as I was in bed
I fell asleep."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud now covered his face, but it was to hide a grin,
not a flood of tears. So far, to his thinking, Olivia Horbury had
told her tale cleverly, but there was a snag just ahead of her
which he did not see how she could weather.</p>

<p>"And you slept well?"</p>

<p>"Too well," she answered remorsefully.</p>

<p>"Too well&mdash;because you had quarrelled?"</p>

<p>Olivia Horbury was bewildered. She raised her eyes and stared
blankly at the Superintendent. And then to the recognition of all
of them bewilderment became deliberately intended. At first she had
been surprised. Now surprise was being acted.</p>

<p>"If we ever quarrelled, the quarrel ended before we parted," she
said, and waited for a trap to be sprung. Superintendent Maltby
obliged.</p>

<p>"How is it, then, since you hadn't quarrelled, and since you
expected Mr. Horbury to follow you in three-quarters of an hour,
that your door was locked against him?"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't!"</p>

<p>The Superintendent jumped in his chair as he heard that calm,
quiet statement. Hanaud looked down at the table; for the smile
upon his face was more pronounced than ever. She would have her
answer ready, not a doubt of it, and quite a good answer, too.</p>

<p>"But, madam," Maltby answered, and now there was a note of
sternness in his voice. He was not a preparatory schoolboy in
flannel shorts who must take what is told him without
contradiction. "Your charwoman, Mrs. Wallace, found your door
locked this morning."</p>

<p>"But that's not all she told you," Olivia Horbury returned.</p>

<p>"No, there was more," Maltby admitted.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mrs. Horbury. "I left my door on the latch.
Daniel, if he finds me asleep, is careful to make no noise. I slept
until I was awakened by a scream. A scream of horror. I sat up with
my heart beating. I saw that the lights were on, although the
sunlight was streaming round the edges of the blinds. Then I
noticed that Dan's bed had not been slept in, that the coverlet had
been turned down, and that his pyjamas were spread out upon it,
waiting for him. Something terrible had happened. I sprang out of
bed, afraid, and I turned the key without thinking. I heard Mrs.
Wallace sobbing and crying out bits of words which I couldn't
understand, and I did "&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders&mdash;"the
fool thing which women do. I fainted. I know. For when I came to my
senses I was lying on the floor and Mrs. Wallace was banging on the
door. I can only have lain there for a few seconds, but "&mdash;and
she shivered as she recalled the moment&mdash;"I felt as cold as
ice. I unlocked the door and told Mrs. Wallace to wait until I got
into bed again."</p>

<p>She sat with all their eyes upon her, intent upon telling her
story without unnecessary lamentations. If ever a woman was
speaking the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, Mr. Ricardo
was certain it was now. If the telephone had rung at half-past two
in the morning, she had not run down the stairs to answer it, Mr.
Ricardo put his hand in his bosom ready to swear it. Even Maltby
seemed to be impressed.</p>

<p>"I see," he said slowly. Then, like one turning to a lighter
subject: "Will you carry your mind back to the hour or two when you
and your husband were in the garden-room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Horbury, during that time, take his keys off the chain
in his pocket?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Horbury's forehead wrinkled. She drew a deep breath or two.
"I don't think that he did."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Maltby. "There is just one last question which
I must ask you. But I am afraid it is the most trying for you of
them all." He held out his hand to the Detective-Sergeant.</p>

<p>With a little gasp, Olivia whispered: "That can't be
helped."</p>

<p>The Detective-Sergeant put into Maltby's hand the long, white
cardboard box. It was ornamented with gold lines. It was gay and
gleaming, the sheath of beauty's buckler and weapon, a dainty
flickering toy to exploit a pair of passionate eyes or make malice
of an admirable mouth. But the prettier it looked, the more Olivia
Horbury dreaded it. Maltby set it down on the mahogany table and
rather slowly, with his eyes upon Olivia, "Now!" he whispered.
Really, he might have been a conjuror, Mr. Ricardo thought. And
then Maltby suddenly whisked the lid from the box, and there was no
luxurious fan of painted chicken skin with a handle of jade, but
the long, blood-crusted blade and the straight handle of Cambridge
blue.</p>

<p>Olivia set her hands against the table's edge and thrust her
chair back. The knife might have been a cobra and she the rabbit,
so helplessly she stared at it.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that knife, madam?"</p>

<p>Olivia shook her head once and a second time more violently. But
Maltby must have the word spoken and duly recorded in Hughes'
notebook.</p>

<p>"You mean, madam, that you have never seen it before," he said,
polite but insistent.</p>

<p>"I do mean just that," she answered, and, as Maltby covered the
box again with its lid, she uttered a sigh of relief and suddenly
swayed in her chair. Mr. Ricardo uttered a cry. He saw her slipping
down by the bed room door. "She will fall," he cried.</p>

<p>But however caustic Hanaud might be in words, he was very quick
on his feet when succour was needed. He was already at Olivia's
side and supporting her. "You know what I think?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Maltby.</p>

<p>"I think that a bottle of the Pommery '06 would be the best
thing for Mrs. Horbury."</p>

<p>Mrs. Horbury sprang up at once. "No, please! I am quite well."
She turned to Maltby. "If you have done with me, I will go
home."</p>

<p>Maltby bowed to her. "I have to thank you very much for
answering my questions. I shall have to lock up this house for the
moment and leave the constable in charge." He turned to Inspector
Herbert. "Mrs. Wallace must go, too, and will you take her
latchkey?"</p>

<p>Herbert went off upon his mission. Mrs. Horbury said: "No doubt
you will want mine, too, Superintendent?"</p>

<p>"I should prefer to have it. Should you need anything here, you
have only to name it to me or Inspector Herbert."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Olivia. She took a dark blue hat which had
been lying on a chair, pinned it on in front of a mirror, and drew
down a veil which hid her eyes. They gathered in the hall: Mrs.
Horbury, the charwoman, Maltby, Hanaud, Mr. Ricardo, Herbert and
Hughes. Mrs. Wallace was the first to go.</p>

<p>"The detective-inspector has your address," said Maltby. "You
will be wanted at the inquest, of course. Notice will be sent to
you."</p>

<p>She went away on foot and then the garage door was opened by
Herbert. "You have petrol enough, madam?"</p>

<p>"More than enough," she answered as she opened the door and
climbed into the car. She drove the little car out into the open
and stopped again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hanaud," she called, and Monsieur Hanaud advanced from
the group at the garage door. "It is not private," she added, and
Hanaud stopped so that all might hear. "You spoke of some injustice
to be put right."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"You must give me a few days."</p>

<p>"Certainly. It is ages since I was in a vacancy. I will give
myself one now until you are ready."</p>

<p>Olivia Horbury stared for a moment. "I should like your
address."</p>

<p>Hanaud smiled. It was the moment for an off-hand gesture, an
address hardly worth giving, so certain it was that he must lodge
there. "The Grosvenor Square. The corner house."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Olivia with a little twist of her lips. "Have they
got one in Grosvenor Square now?" and she drove out past the
policeman at the gate and turned her car towards London, her face
losing its humour as the chestnuts and the gardens disappeared. The
flat and arid life of the town&mdash;she must get used to that now
that Dan, with his rogueries and his good humour, his preposterous
politics and his queer truth to her, had gone. That, sooner or
later, he might go to prison for a long time she had felt sure,
even before she had married. But death&mdash;violent,
bloody&mdash;Dan hated the sight of blood&mdash;this sort of death
above all! And as she drove across Battersea Bridge and past the
Houses of Parliament yet a third and this time a passionate,
expression began to burn in her eyes.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The police officers returned to the house. In the upper rooms a
bathroom, two servants rooms, a dressing-room for Mr. Horbury, and
the big double bedroom, nothing new was discovered. The windows of
the garden-room, its door, the doors of the dining-room and the
kitchen&mdash;everything was made safe.</p>

<p>"There will be a man in the house, as well as one outside, until
the inquest's over," said Maltby, as he handed over the keys to
Inspector Herbert. "I have arranged for it at the Station."</p>

<p>They were in the hall, and Maltby was opening the front door
when Hanaud cried: "'Arf a mo! There is somethin' we forget? Yes,
no?"</p>

<p>He dashed across the hall, and a rather condescending smile at
the antics of the foreigner which had begun to broaden over
Maltby's face was suddenly frozen there.</p>

<p>Hanaud went straight to a cupboard in the wall. It was not
locked. He pulled it open and there, for all to see, a brown
overcoat of a light weight, and a white silk scarf hung upon a
hook.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he cried. "The Horbury's coat!"</p>

<p>He turned it so that the lining showed and the inside pocket in
the breast. He stood up on the tips of his toes to peer into it.
Suddenly he whipped the silk scarf from the hook, shook it out, and
spread it over his palm. He felt in the breast pocket of the
overcoat and stood for a moment, or two afterwards with his back
towards his companions, and in the poise of his head and the stoop
of his shoulders there was a bitter confession of defeat.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, indeed, feared that, he was going to disgrace the
whole confraternity of the Sureté by a shameless attempt to hide
his discovery. But it was not unusual for Mr. Ricardo to be wrong.
Hanaud was double-dyed in his vocation. He would follow relentless
through the dark labyrinth of a crime; but he never pretended when
a stiff barrier had to be climbed; and never denied failure when
one simple fact, which could not fairly be explained away, brought
him up all standing and closed the case. He knew the difference
between a full-stop and a semi-colon. So now he came slowly to his
colleagues, holding and hiding his treasure in a scarf. A
semi-colon?&mdash;at the least. A full-stop?&mdash;maybe.</p>

<p>"It is over," he said, holding forward his swathed hand.</p>

<p>Maltby looked puzzled. "The Case&mdash;if it is a Case?" the
Superintendent asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. For the Coroner at all events"&mdash;the semi-colon, so to
speak&mdash;"it is over."</p>

<p>Hanaud turned back with deliberate care the folds of the scarf.
Lying upon it, across the palm of his hand, was the thick, stiff
sheath of a long knife. It was decorated at the wider end with a
pattern in thread of Cambridge blue.</p>

<p>"And in Horbury's top-coat, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Maltby looked with a smile of relief at Inspector Herbert. "That
settles it, then."</p>

<p>The knife on the ground beneath Horbury's hand and his
finger-marks upon the handle; the sheath in the pocket of the
overcoat in which Horbury had driven from London: facts. All else
was wild surmise.</p>

<p>"For the Coroner, yes," Hanaud repeated as he handed scarf and
sheath to the detective-sergeant.</p>

<p>But for the Red Judge? The full stop? He was not so sure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"><small>CHAPTER 11</small></a><br>
<br>
THE BLIND MAN'S DOG</h2>

<p class="first">On the gravelled enclosure where Mr. Ricardo's
second Rolls Royce stood side by side with the swift but
inconspicuous police car, Hanaud spread a large white hand over his
paunch.</p>

<p>"I rumble," he said. "It is the luncheon gong."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo bowed eagerly to Superintendent Maltby. "I shall be
honoured if you will join us," he exclaimed, but the Superintendent
shook his head.</p>

<p>"I must go back to the Yard. There are other matters awaiting
me." He noticed the gloom gather on Hanaud's face and hurriedly
went on: "You may be assured that we shall not neglect the
interesting points you have raised. Inspector Herbert will submit a
full report, of which you shall have a copy at the corner house in
Grosvenor Square." Not by the twitch of a muscle did he express his
pleasure in that unusual address. "And I think you should come with
me to Mr. Horbury's offices in King Street. At half-past three?
Will you and Mr. Ricardo call for me just before the half-hour?
Meanwhile, I'll send out a call for Bryan Devisher, on the chance
that he will have something to tell us. And I hope to find all
ready for us at the Yard, some particulars of Mrs. Horbury's
history."</p>

<p>Hanaud's face had been growing happier and happier, now that the
file was not to be closed and put away upon its shelf.</p>

<p>"I thank you," he said gratefully.</p>

<p>Maltby was carrying a key with a linen tab tied to it. He called
the constable on duty at the gate.</p>

<p>"This is the charwoman's key. You will be responsible for it,
and Inspector Herbert will see that you are relieved. You will
allow no one to enter the house without his or my leave."</p>

<p>The constable saluted and took the key.</p>

<p>"No one, sir? Not even Mrs. Horbury?"</p>

<p>Hanaud gasped audibly.</p>

<p>"That woman! Above all, no," he whispered, and Maltby took up
the words at once.</p>

<p>"Above all, not Mrs. Horbury."</p>

<p>The constable saluted again and retired to the gate. Maltby
glanced curiously at the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"I thought that you were rather on her side," he said.</p>

<p>And, for a moment, Hanaud hung in a suspense. Should he speak?
Shouldn't he? But he was effervescent. He simply had to.</p>

<p>"That woman!" he cried, and admiration was loud in his voice.
"She is a oner! She is the goods! I tell you. She is out of the top
of her drawers."</p>

<p>"Really, really," cried Mr. Ricardo, quite shocked.</p>

<p>"An idiom, my friend. I use him," said Hanaud affably.</p>

<p>"Use him properly then," Ricardo remonstrated. "She is out of
the top drawer."</p>

<p>"So I said, my friend," Hanaud returned, he continued
enthusiastically: "And how she lied! Mind you, she will give back
the money of Monsieur Gravot, even if she starves. In the name of
the Place Vendôme, I honour her for it. But how she lied to us! And
with what aplumbing! The woman screamed, and she jumped out of bed
half-awake and turned the key of her door and fainted. Did she? Oh,
no, no!" and his face lost all its humour, and his voice all its
excitement. "Oh, no, no," he repeated in a whisper, and the lids of
his eyes half closed, as though he were watching somewhere a long
way off a scene of horror which nothing could prevent.</p>

<p>"I was looking very sharply, my Maltby, when you placed the long
cardboard fan case down on the table in front of her. I think that
already she knew what was in it. It was not surprise she betrayed.
There was no staring up into your face to read what startling
discovery you had made. No, she gazed at the case, she gathered
herself, her feet pressed upon the ground, her hands gripping each
other, to meet with nothing more than a shock of horror, a recoil
of disgust, her second view of that brutal weapon. She pushed her
chair back&mdash;yes, with the proper violence, and no doubt there
was nature enough in the violence, but there was no surprise."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly both Maltby and Herbert listened with discomfort. It
was not merely that Hanaud's words strengthened an unwelcome
suspicion of their own. But through his heavy features there shone
a light, even in his whispers there sounded an authority which
could not but arrest their judgment.</p>

<p>"You think she knew already what the thing in the cardboard box
was? What it had done?" cried Ricardo.</p>

<p>"I do," Hanaud returned slowly. "I think that she was present
when a great crime was committed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Horbury," cried Maltby.</p>

<p>"By Devisher," Mr. Ricardo amended.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"And, if she knew, why should she keep silent?" Maltby
asked.</p>

<p>"Again, I don't know," Hanaud repeated.</p>

<p>But he was not abandoning his inspiration. If anything, it grew
stronger. For he looked about him, and in that noonday sunlight,
with the blackbirds and the thrushes calling from the garden, he
suddenly shivered.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," he cried, a man in distress. "What happened
here when even this house was silent, and nothing moved but the
shadows on path and meadow and lawn, as the moon drenched the world
in silver? Let me tell you what I&mdash;see. Her, Olivia Horbury,
when the crime was done and the house empty, climbing the stairs to
her room. It was not yet midnight&mdash;and all the long night to
live through. She must go to bed, leave the light on to help the
man who needs no more helping. She turns from one side to the other
until&mdash;surely it is close on dawn?&mdash;suddenly the
telephone rings through the house, shrill enough even to wake that
sprawling figure in the room below. Did she look at her watch and
note that the night was not half spent? And suddenly the telephone
stops. Too abruptly, too quickly! Someone is in the house besides
herself and the dead man. A friend? No! The murderer returned, not
trusting her word, to make sure. To make sure by a second crime.
Imagine her panic, if you can? She sprang out of bed, she locked
the door between her and death, and so fell fainting to the floor,
to be awakened: hours afterwards by the screams, the banging upon
the panels."</p>

<p>He stopped and a silence followed upon his words. Maltby was the
first to shake off the obsession, but he was troubled, none the
less. Although he strove to speak lightly, his voice betrayed him.
"Facts, Monsieur Hanaud! Facts we must cling to. Not imagination,
however subtle."</p>

<p>Hanaud answered with a smile. "Yes, facts, my dear Maltby, and a
little imagination to interpret them. Imagination on a
leash&mdash;he is the blind man's dog." He mounted into Mr
Ricardo's car and produced his blue packet of abominable
cigarettes. "Just before half-past three, then!"</p>

<p>"Just before half-past three," cried Maltby from the window of
the police car, "and, my dear colleague, I shall hope for some more
idioms from you in the course of the afternoon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"><small>CHAPTER 12</small></a><br>
<br>
BIG BUSINESS AND SWITCHBACK BUSINESS</h2>

<p class="first">At a small table for two in Signor Bentano's
restaurant in the Strand, Monsieur Hanaud tucked the end of his
napkin between his collar and his neck and drank a glass of Porto
as an appetiser. It was a restaurant famous for its cuisine, which
was hampered in the evening by an orchestra in gallery and a crowd
on its way to the theatres. But in the morning the clients were for
the most part of the more jovial and sporting business men.</p>

<p>"So it was here that the Horbury lunched," said Hanaud, looking
about him. "Good! So we get the atmosphere, and that is enough. We
eat and we keep our eyes open, and we talk of the ballet and
whether the filet mignon is as tender here as at Lame's."</p>

<p>And in that way the meal was eaten pleasantly enough, with a
bottle of Clos de Tart to keep it company. At the end of it, Hanaud
produced his inevitable blue packet of black cigarettes. But Mr.
Ricardo was firm and stern. "You shall not," he said. "There are
limits. On the borderland of the Clos de Tart there are Hoyo de
Monterrey cigars, but not your revolting cigarettes."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud was, having been well fed, docile. He lit his
cigar. "Am I allowed a peppermint?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo smiled indulgently. "You are. A simple glass of
Signor Bentano's brandy will do for me."</p>

<p>Hanaud smiled affably as he sipped his peppermint. "What did
your Mr. Gladstone say in 1884?"</p>

<p>"That will never be known," Ricardo declared firmly. He was not
prepared to argue. By three o'clock Signor Bentano's clients had
gone back to their amusements or their business. At a quarter past,
Mr. Ricardo paid his bill, and the pair travelled in the
Rolls-Royce to Scotland Yard. Maltby and Herbert were waiting, and
Maltby handed an envelope to Hanaud.</p>

<p>"You will find in that a copy of all we know about Olivia
Horbury. It is much what you would expect, I think."</p>

<p>Hanaud put the envelope away in his pocket, and the half-hour
had not struck when they were on their way to what had once been
Witherton's Rooms in St. James'.</p>

<p>They were received in a small office of unnoticeable
appointments by a long grey man, as thin as a question mark and
almost as bent. He was handsomely dressed in a dark grey suit with
a cutaway morning coat, a stiff white collar and a grey silk tie.
He had a thin grey Chinaman's moustache, of which he would lure the
ends into his mouth and by biting them assure himself that there
was something he need not question. He had so few qualities akin to
the boisterous roguery of Mr. Horbury's career that all the four
men counted him as a watchdog, put in by a firm which was owed
money. The grey man, however, rose to his feet and made a small
bow.</p>

<p>"Superintendent Maltby, I believe. I have been instructed to put
the office at your disposal."</p>

<p>"Mr. Foster, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have been Mr. Horbury's manager for five years?"</p>

<p>There was still some surprise in Maltby's voice and it brought a
sardonic smile to Foster's mouth. "His managing clerk," he
answered, lifting a hand in correction. "Mr. Horbury's business
was, in the main, personal and conducted by himself. I fancy that I
owe my length of service and my very good salary to the fact that I
was honest and that, however uncongenial some of his activities may
have been, I did not pry into what didn't concern me."</p>

<p>"I see," said Maltby dryly. "It's no use coming to you for
secrets."</p>

<p>"No. For I don't know any," said Foster. He crossed the room to
a door and, with something of mockery in the gesture, flung it
open. "This, gentlemen, was Mr. Horbury's private office."</p>

<p>They went into it one by one and stared. Maltby pursed up his
lips and whistled. Rosewood panels decorated the walls, the
furniture was upholstered in red damask, leather arm-chairs stood
on each side of the Adam fireplace, and in the centre, on a thick
Aubusson carpet, stood a beautiful big walnut writing-table, with a
semi-circular top of pigeon-holes and drawers.</p>

<p>"Queen Anne," Mr. Ricardo thought, looking at it with envy.</p>

<p>"Yes, all sheen and costliness," said Mr. Foster, in answer to
the Superintendent's whistle. Maltby, however, was less concerned
with the glitter of the office than with his need to reach more
familiar terms with this difficult managing clerk. He had not
noticed the irony in Foster's voice, and was led consequently to
make the most unfortunate mistake. He looked about him with
admiration.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Big Business, eh?" and saw disdain
completely occupy Foster's face.</p>

<p>"Forty years in the City have led me to associate Big Business
with furniture which invites you to go away as soon as your
business is concluded."</p>

<p>The Superintendent's approach had been faulty. But he had still
one other pebble if he could fit it somehow into his sling. At the
present moment, however, Foster was not mixing his metaphors. He
was driving straight on.</p>

<p>"Mr. Horbury himself, who had the most redeeming sense of
humour, knew quite well that Big Business had nothing to do with
the style of this room. For I ventured, falling, if I may say so,
into your mistake, Superintendent, to expostulate with Mr. Horbury
upon it, and he answered, 'My good Foster, the sort of clients you
are used to will no doubt shudder, but the sort of clients I expect
will imagine this is the replica of a nobleman's study.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo felt internally a sort of warmth. It is, after all,
always pleasant to see a policeman put in his place.</p>

<p>"Big Business," continued Mr. Foster, warming to his theme. He
crossed the room, unlocked a cupboard and flung open the door. On
one shelf stood glasses, capacious goblets of thin glass. On the
other bottle upon bottle of Pommery '06. "Look!" cried Mr. Foster,
and he added with the most assertive waggings of his head, "Cocks
don't porp in Big Business."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo here felt constrained to intervene. "Mr. Foster
means, of course, that corks don't&mdash;" but he was allowed to
get no further.</p>

<p>"No, no, my friend," cried Hanaud. "I like him as he is. Cocks
don't porp in Big Business. There is a profundity there." He turned
with a bow to Foster. "I thank you, sir. I use him."</p>

<p>But Mr. Foster was staring curiously at Hanaud. He said to the
Superintendent:</p>

<p>"You did not, I think, present me to these gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Maltby answered with a little discomfort. "This is
Monsieur Hanaud of the Sureté of Paris."</p>

<p>He paused, his eyes watching the clerk keenly, but on Foster's
face there was nothing but bewilderment, no realisation that here
was Horbury's enemy; not even any recognition of the name.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hanaud?" he repeated with an inquisitive glance at the
Frenchman. "But as I told you, Superintendent, Mr. Horbury worked
alone." His eyes came quickly back to the Frenchman's face. "Might
I ask you, sir, whether we owe to your sudden arrival the&mdash;the
crisis of last night? If my question is incorrect, I beg you to
forget it."</p>

<p>"Your question is incorrect to the last degree," Hanaud returned
with a smile. "But I am glad that you asked. For everywhere I see
eyes of suspicion and hear ditto voices. I came from France
yesterday, the complete incog of the wheel. No one knows me. I came
to see the Horbury, it is true, but on a small matter of
business."</p>

<p>Foster's gaze passed doubtfully on.</p>

<p>"And this," said Maltby, "is Mr. Ricardo."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Foster. "That is interesting. You rang up Mr.
Horbury yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"I did!" exclaimed the astounded Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maltby keenly. "I want the details of that call, Mr.
Ricardo."</p>

<p>Ricardo stared blankly at the Superintendent. "You knew about
it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I did. At my first contact with this office I was
told that an unknown Mr. Ricardo had rung up yesterday and obtained
from some incautious clerk Mr. Horbury's address in the suburbs.
Come, come, sir! You have been very quiet about it all, but we have
been waiting for you."</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby, Mr. Foster the clerk, and Inspector
Herbert were all closing in on Mr. Ricardo with determination. He
seemed to hear the handcuffs jingling, he almost looked round for
the ewer of his prison-cell that he might wet his throat.</p>

<p>"Take out your notebook, Inspector, and set down the business
Mr. Ricardo had with Horbury yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"I had no business with Horbury," Ricardo persisted.</p>

<p>"And why he wanted the address in Lordship Lane," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What time was it when Mr. Ricardo rang up?" Maltby asked.</p>

<p>"Immediately after five," Foster returned; and a great light
shone in upon Ricardo's troubled mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, and he rang up from Victoria Station," he
declared, gazing at Monsieur Hanaud with indignant eyes. "The
Continental train was no doubt punctual."</p>

<p>Hanaud was seldom abashed. "Evidently I rang up from the
Victoria Station. I did not wish my visit to excite the fear, so I
did not give my name."</p>

<p>"That's no excuse for giving mine. And why should people be
afraid of you?" Mr. Ricardo straightened his knees and scoffed at
Hanaud's self-importance.</p>

<p>The Frenchman shook his head in melancholy reproof. "So! You
trample on the poor Hanaud, the alien, the humble one. Yet how you
are unjust! It is a mixture, a jumble up. If I say it is someone
who stays with the fine Mr. Ricardo of Grosvenor Square it becomes,
before you can twinkle a bedpost, Mr. Ricardo himself. You all see
that, I am sure."</p>

<p>What Mr. Ricardo saw was that the prison walls were fading into
air: what Superintendent Maltby saw was that a hopeful clue to the
suicide of Horbury, upon which he had set some store, was dead as a
doornail.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a puzzle," said Foster frowning thoughtfully at
Maltby. "You see we are not Big Business, but Switchback Business.
Sometimes we are up, up, up..."</p>

<p>"With cocks porping," Hanaud interposed.</p>

<p>"And the Banks smiling. Sometimes we are down, down, down, with
the creditors filling King Street and Mr. Horbury
invisible&mdash;and perhaps Superintendent Maltby not so far
away."</p>

<p>"And what was it this time?" Maltby asked quickly, but Foster
was equally quick to avoid an answer. He shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was, as I told you, a personal business. We shall know when
the accountants make their report," he said frostily. "But do not
expect Big Business. Even those fine gentlemen," and he pointed to
a photograph of a horse hanging upon a nail, "never won a race
except at Ostend."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Maltby, seizing his opportunity at last, "I'd sooner
see a Rugby football match at Twickenham any day."</p>

<p>Foster gasped. Under the solemn aspect of Superintendent Maltby,
he had found a brother. "Would you?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Rather! Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Both faces went back to the Ostend champion, but their thoughts
had nothing to do with the sport of kings. Mr. Foster was turning
over in his mind pictures of finely fought football matches. Maltby
was saying prudently to himself, "You've hooked him. Play him
carefully!" With invariable care, he had left a direction early
that morning for a check-up of Horbury's staff, and of the few
discoveries this was apparently the most valuable. It established
him on a brotherly footing with the old clerk.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the last England and Scotland match?" Foster
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"My word, yes," Maltby exclaimed ecstatically. He had never seen
a Rugby game since his boyhood. "That was a match!"</p>

<p>"Just a run away from the beginning."</p>

<p>"To the end," Maltby was about to add, and fortunately saved his
prestige by smiling at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Until the last two quick goals saved us," cried Foster. He
laughed aloud. He almost stood upright. Every Saturday he hurried
from the office, drank a glass of beer, swallowed a sandwich, and
passed an afternoon of enchantment, watching heroes. He turned to
Maltby and grasped him by the arm. "I'll show you what is puzzling
me."</p>

<p>He led the Superintendent to a panel of the wall where a
large&mdash;map, was it?&mdash;or cartoon?&mdash;was wound up on a
spring roller. Foster pulled upon a string, unrolled it and made
the string fast to a nail; and, as if a military command had been
given, everyone in that room took a step backwards and stared.
Maltby was the first to find his tongue.</p>

<p>"It's difficult to surprise me, but if not Big Business, then
Hot Stuff!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, though he sought for a pointed and devastating
phrase, could not achieve it. No doubt he was stunned. "Really,
really, what vulgarity!" he stammered.</p>

<p>Inspector Herbert said nothing and made a note. Perhaps Monsieur
Hanaud was the only one of the four to appreciate it properly. A
laugh of enjoyment, if so thin a sound could be so described,
tinkled suddenly. "He was a&mdash;what you call him?&mdash;a gamin,
a monkey, an urchin, that Horbury! How I would have liked it if he
had lived."</p>

<p>Foster swung round, surprised, and in spite of himself pleased.
He was not as a rule in favour of foreigners. Finicking people who
would be frightened by a good square meal off a saddle of South
Down lamb, and hadn't learnt how to be beaten at games. Yet this
one had got nearer to the truth than any of his visitors.</p>

<p>"That's right, monsieur. A touch of the gutter boy in him, to be
sure. Always winked at himself, whatever roguery he was up to."</p>

<p>The Wembley Stadium had noticeably diminished the correctitude
of the clerk, who chuckled and rubbed his hands. "Half of that was
just fun to him," he cried, pointing to the wall on which the big
cartoon blazed.</p>

<p>It represented a crowded House of Commons, Horbury standing in
the Prime Minister's usual place at the Treasury Bench, with his
hand on a red box and an incredulous face turned towards an
opponent who had dared to interrupt him, and the Speaker on his
feet with a shocked expression and these words enclosed, as it
were, in a bubble issuing from his lips: "Order! Order! If it's in
Horbury's Newsbag, it is so."</p>

<p>"Pretty crude, the colours," said Maltby with a grin.</p>

<p>"No doubt, but it would nobble the public," Foster returned.</p>

<p>"Horbury's Newsbag," said Maltby. "A newspaper?"</p>

<p>"A weekly," returned Foster.</p>

<p>"But I've never heard of it."</p>

<p>"You were going to," Foster replied. "Switchback business. A big
lottery on the Derby in Switzerland put us up. Horbury's Newsbag
was going to put us higher. In a fortnight that poster was going to
go on every hoarding big enough to hold it which Horbury could lay
his hands upon. A week afterwards the first number was to be
published. He had got his staff for it. There were to be
competitions with tremendous prizes. All the political stuff he was
going to write himself. I warned him that he was overdoing it. But
he wouldn't hear a word. He just looked at that cartoon&mdash;I
told you he had a sense of humour&mdash;and cried with a grin as
broad as his face, 'I tell you, Foster, Horbury's News-Bag is going
to be Horbury's Nosebag, and pretty full too!' Now mark me,
Superintendent "&mdash;and Foster sat down in one of those too easy
chairs and shook his finger at the Superintendent&mdash;"and you
too, the detective of France. Horbury said that to me less than a
week ago! Well then, explain to me last night!"</p>

<p>Maltby nodded his head thoughtfully and Hanaud sat himself down
at Foster's side. "There was real money in the bank?" he asked.</p>

<p>Foster answered him a little more stiffly than he would have
answered Maltby. "Lots of it. The accountants, Trenlove and
Timmins, a firm of the highest integrity, will no doubt supply you
with a statement."</p>

<p>"You were up, up, up," said Hanaud, "with the cocks
porping."</p>

<p>Foster agreed with a smile. "That little joke amused you, eh?"
And he added with a shrug of the shoulders, "but there have been
times when the car rushed head-long down the curve, and there,
perhaps, was the Superintendent at the bottom of the curve, waiting
for the smash, and the razor perhaps not so far from the throat,
But last night&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>Ricardo was oddly affected by the scene, so that he felt always
on the edge of a revelation, but a revelation which never broke.
Maltby, greatly annoyed that a simple verdict of suicide was
becoming less and less acceptable, and at the same time honestly
troubled as to what dark mystery the evidence was leading to, stood
alone, staring now at the preposterous cartoon, now at the
portraits of Horbury's second-class racehorses. And in the two
armchairs, side by side, Hanaud and the clerk talked in low voices
quickly together. Anyone who has stumbled into an accidental
witticism and finds it credited to him as intentional will regard
with favour the man who has made this pleasant error. Altogether,
what with this engaging Frenchman and the comrade of Wembley,
Foster was now inclined to give all the help which he had meant to
deny.</p>

<p>"Apart from his lottery and the nosebag," Hanaud asked, "was
there, do you think, any private affair which troubled him?" Mr.
Foster shook his head. "Any enemy getting nearer and nearer to
him?" Foster looked sharply at Hanaud and pondered and pondered in
vain. "Did you ever hear him mention Bryan Devisher?"</p>

<p>Foster sprang at the name. Here at all events was something
definite, even if it was definitely to be denied. "I never heard
the name before you spoke it."</p>

<p>The hopefulness died out of Hanaud's voice and Mr. Ricardo
recognised that the moment had come for him to encourage his
friend. "But Mr. Horbury, no doubt, was a man of many secrets," he
said.</p>

<p>"Secrets is it?" cried Foster. "To be sure, there were secrets!
His, mind you."</p>

<p>"Yes, his, of course. But sometimes perhaps these secrets had
outward signs with them?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby had swung round upon this question and
stood, holding his attitude, afraid lest a movement catching the
eye or ear should distract Foster's attention.</p>

<p>"Outward signs?" Foster repeated.</p>

<p>"Such as an unlikely visitor and a long conference?"</p>

<p>Mr. Foster reflected, heaved a sigh and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Some unusual thing he did and hid?"</p>

<p>Mr. Foster sat up straight.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "I wonder," and then he sat so long with his eyes
bright and his head on one side like a bird that patience herself
could hardly have borne it.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he whispered to himself, and every head was bent
towards him. But he only relaxed in his chair. He was still seeing
something that no other of them could see. "And hid, you said?" He
turned towards Hanaud.</p>

<p>"And hid," Hanaud confirmed.</p>

<p>"Did and hid?"</p>

<p>"Did and hid," repeated Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," said Mr. Foster suddenly, and of the four, three
started and smiled, and were warned by a movement of Hanaud's
wrist.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," Hanaud whispered.</p>

<p>Foster rose from his chair and crossed the room to the walnut
writing-table. There was a row of pigeon-holes with drawers
underneath them and in the middle a small locked door with walnut
wood pillars on each side. Underneath the table there was a long
drawer across and two smaller drawers, one on each side. Foster
pulled at the brass handle of the smaller and lower drawer on the
left-hand side and found it locked. He looked up at Maltby. "You
have Horbury's keys?"</p>

<p>Inspector Herbert advanced, he took an envelope from his pocket
and the bunch of keys from the envelope.</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Foster tried one or two before he lit upon the right one. It
might have been play-acting, but, to Ricardo's thought, the man was
feverishly eager now to reveal the secret of that drawer.</p>

<p>"Now we shall see," and he pulled it open. He peered into it, he
thrust his hand into the furthest end of it, and drew it out again
with a cry of disappointment. The drawer was empty. He sat back in
Horbury's chair and looked from face to face, bidding them notice
how the fates played with men.</p>

<p>"But it was there! I saw him put it away when he had done with
it and lock the drawer before he went to his bath. Ah!"</p>

<p>He sprang up, passed through his own room along a corridor. At
the end of the corridor a dressing-room led into a bathroom. A
charwoman had evidently cleaned the room after Horbury had dressed,
for the clothes he had worn in his office lay neatly folded on a
couch.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mr. Foster and he darted forward. "To be sure! To be
sure! I had forgotten." He turned round, flourishing triumphantly a
copy of an evening newspaper above his head.</p>

<p>"Was that what you were looking for?" Maltby asked glumly.</p>

<p>"Oh no," he admitted, dropping at once to disappointment. Mr.
Foster was rather like a rock which expands in the sun and
contracts sharply in a frost. "No, and I don't see it anywhere at
all. However, we have got the evening paper," and once more he
flourished the paper. He had found it carefully folded like the
clothes and half hidden beneath them. "And that may help!"</p>

<p>"How?" asked Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>But Mr. Foster was lost in thought and to Ricardo's idea, most
provokingly. "I have a notion," Foster exclaimed, and he turned to
the corridor.</p>

<p>"What we want is a fact," Maltby returned.</p>

<p>Over his shoulder Foster called out, "A notion is the cocoon of
a fact."</p>

<p>He hurried down the passage back to Horbury's office, seated
himself importantly in Horbury's chair and, after a definite poise
of his left hand to make clear to all the thing which he was doing,
he struck a gong upon the table with the flat of his palm and sat
back, his arms folded.</p>

<p>"Napoleon," Hanaud whispered. "Something will come of it."</p>

<p>A boy came of it. He sat in the general clerks' room, behind
Foster's, and appeared by a parallel doorway.</p>

<p>"John," said Mr. Foster with dignity.</p>

<p>"John yourself," said the boy. "Mr. John Urwick Esquire to you,
please!" So quickly had the discipline of Daniel Horbury's firm
disintegrated.</p>

<p>"Mr. John Urwick, will you ask the commissionaire to step here
for a moment?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind, seeing it's you," John Urwick answered as he
swaggered by. But he swaggered by Mr. Ricardo too, and he, incensed
by so much impertinence crowning so many failures and delays, was
carried to the very extreme of violence. "Really! Really?" he
cried and, swinging his leg, he landed Mr. John Urwick Esquire a
real one in the right place with the right foot. John with a yelp
flew across the room, dropping the Mr. on one side and the Esquire
on the other. He dashed out of the door and with a speed which
marked a new era in his life, brought in the commissionaire and
slunk away behind him to his office. Mr. Ricardo, however, rather
pleased with his resource, was completely occupied by the
commissionaire, who stood at attention before Mr. Foster.</p>

<p>"Brown, you saw Mr. Horbury go away from the office
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he take anything with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know what it was?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help knowing, sir. I was a petty officer in the
Navy."</p>

<p>"Oh!" and Mr Foster was not the only one of that company who was
startled by the answer. "What was it that he took away?"</p>

<p>"A chart, sir," and Foster's hand thumped down upon the table.
"Of course!" and for the first time the Superintendent and his
companions began to learn something of that missing article which
had so intrigued the secretary.</p>

<p>It was a small chart pinned at the four corners on to a flat
ebony board by ordinary flat brass drawing-pins. It was easy enough
to carry and it might have been carried under the arm, but for a
difficulty. Pins had been pricked into the chart as if to mark out
a course&mdash;only a few of them, but long ones, black ones with
glass heads in the shape and colour of white ensigns.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster's memory responded to this extra flick. His hand
darted to a small flat box of white cardboard. Within a decorative
wreath on the outside was the name Hamley, and an address. Mr.
Foster lifted out the box from the pigeon-hole in which it lay and
opened it. "Like that?" he asked, holding up just such a pin as
Brown had described.</p>

<p>"Exactly that," Brown answered.</p>

<p>Maltby closed the box and took it up from under his nose. Not a
very considerate action, in Mr. Ricardo's judgment, but to be
expected. Fortunately, however, Foster's fingers were still holding
the pin which he had taken out of the box for Brown's inspection.
He stepped noiselessly forward. "One for me, please!" and he
snatched at it.</p>

<p>But he only scratched a red line across the back of his hand,
for which the managing clerk made no apology.</p>

<p>"Later on, no doubt," he said, waving the pin back wards and
forwards and using familiar words to answer familiar questions, but
with his mind lost in other matters.</p>

<p>"Horbury was sitting where I am," they heard him say, "and I
came in behind him from my office with some letters for him to
sign. Yes. He hadn't heard me come in. He was bending over
something in front of him, which I now know to be a chart, hunched
over it. But where does the evening paper come in?&mdash;wait a
bit&mdash;I know. Horbury grabbed at it. It was lying on the top of
the desk above the pigeon-holes. He turned over the pages, hardly
read a line at the top of a page, and drove in a new pin rather
viciously. Did he turn the pages of the paper back
again&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," Monsieur Hanaud broke in.</p>

<p>Maltby turned round, half jealous, half friendly.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Look!" Hanaud pointed to the top line of the page. "Shipping
news," and underneath it, "El Rey passed Frawle Point at 6
a.m."</p>

<p>Maltby recognised the name and all that it meant in the shape of
further investigation. He heaved a sigh, reluctant to abandon the
simple verdict of suicide. But he was honest down to the soles of
his boots. He smiled grimly at Hanaud. "Yes, that was the ship
which carried Bryan Devisher. And seven miles farther on, Devisher
took a header into a rough sea. Yes&mdash;but damn!"</p>

<p>The oath came from the heart of a busy, overworked public
servant who couldn't have shirked the least item of his job even
had he wished to.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster had no ears at this moment for either Hanaud or
Maltby. He was sunk deep in his recollections.</p>

<p>"I was standing "&mdash;he looked round&mdash;"just where Brown
is standing. There was, yes&mdash;I think I can say that&mdash;a
little gasp of fear when he looked at the evening paper, and he
jabbed rather viciously the last pin into the chart. By the
way&mdash;" and he turned round with a smile. "All right, Brown,
that will do," but when Brown had gone, the smile was still upon
his face. "Did you notice those pins? Black pins with the White
Ensign flying. Very characteristic of Horbury. All for King and
Country. The old rogue&mdash;you couldn't but like him. He must
have gone out of his way to the toy shop in Regent Street to get
those pins. However, there he was jabbing his pin in, and he was
suddenly aware of me behind him. He just flung himself over the
chart and said: 'You can leave those letters on the little table by
the fireplace. I'll sign them before I go,' and he pulled out the
lower drawer on his left hand, as if he were going to replace the
chart as soon as I left the room. But, you see, he took it
away."</p>

<p>Mr. Foster swung round in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Inspector Herbert.</p>

<p>They stood in a semicircle about Foster's chair, brooding upon
him. Mr. Ricardo could imagine nothing more intimidating than the
group they formed, and, indeed, felt some secret pleasure that he
was one of the intimidators. Foster was undoubtedly affected. He
rubbed the palms of his hands together, leaning forward in his
chair.</p>

<p>"There, that's all," he cried, throwing himself back and meeting
Ricardo's gaze rather than the gaze of any of the others.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! he looks at you. You are the magnetic one," said Hanaud
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Ricardo wished that the charge were true. "I accuse him less,"
he answered regretfully.</p>

<p>"It is curious, though, that Horbury should have taken that
chart away with him to White Barn," Foster resumed carelessly. He
was seeking an opportunity of breaking up that arc of intimidating
bodies and faces and slipping out of it. But Hanaud was too quick
for him.</p>

<p>"It is still more curious that not a fragment of the chart, not
a splinter of the ebony board, nor even one of the drawing-pins was
to be found at White Barn."</p>

<p>"Yes; that is more curious still," Foster admitted. "Someone
must have taken it away."</p>

<p>"Then you admit a someone," said Maltby sternly.</p>

<p>"No, I do not," cried Foster agitatedly, and then surrendering:
"Kamerad!"</p>

<p>He took the bunch of keys from the lower left-hand drawer where
it dangled and, fitting one to the lock of the small chamber in the
middle of the pigeon-holes, he said:</p>

<p>"There's a letter. It won't help you. I didn't mean to mention
it because it could clearly have nothing whatever to do with your
case. It is written to really big business, you know. I was more
than a little astonished that Horbury should be writing at all to
this person. However, he was, and a long letter, too."</p>

<p>"Do you know what it was about?" Maltby asked.</p>

<p>"Not an idea," replied Foster. "But it had enclosures, I
remember noticing that."</p>

<p>"And the address?" said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The address, of course. Horbury made no secret from me
that there was such a letter, you must understand. If anything
happened to him&mdash;you know the way men talk&mdash;I was to see
that it went."</p>

<p>"He said that?" exclaimed Mr. Ricardo. "If anything happened to
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think the material words were I was to see that it went,"
replied Foster. "For he said them with a wink..."</p>

<p>"A wink?" repeated Hanaud.</p>

<p>Foster nodded. "A bit phoney, eh? But you'll be able to break
the seal and see for yourselves."</p>

<p>"It was sealed, was it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, black wax. Horbury pointed that out to me and winked
again. Suggestive, eh? Hot stuff, I think, my late employer."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Maltby. "But that little cupboard
you've opened is as empty as Mother Hubbard's. There's nothing in
it."</p>

<p>Foster grinned. "It's not as easy as all that, you know. There's
a little wooden latch in the roof of it." He felt with the tip of
his middle finger and shot back a wooden peg. Then he stretched his
hand in to the back of the cupboard where a hole had been cut in
the side wall. "Here she comes!" He was now able to slide forward
the pillar on the left side of the cupboard. It was seen to be a
narrow drawer set vertically, so that the opening was at the top.
He took it out, turned it upside down and shook it. It was as empty
as the cupboard. He tapped the sides and shook it a second time. He
peered into it.</p>

<p>"It was there!" he cried. "He put it away for safety."</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby took the drawer and examined it. "Anyone
who knew the trick might have stolen it," he argued.</p>

<p>"No. He would need to open this little door first, and for that
he would want the key."</p>

<p>"Can you tell when he took it away?"</p>

<p>Foster nodded his head. "Yesterday," he answered. "Horbury was
very busy with his first number of the Newsbag. So it was only two
days ago that he had an hour or two to spare. He made up his packet
and sealed the envelope and put it away ready in the secret drawer
the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, then," Maltby agreed. "And ready for use, if the
person whom it affected was not amenable, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Foster set back the secret drawer in its place, shot the
wooden latch into its place, locked the cupboard drawer, and, with
a great formality, handed back the keys to the Inspector. He was
once more the managing clerk, official and discreet.</p>

<p>"I could not for a moment, Superintendent, subscribe to any such
suggestion," he said, and Monsieur Hanaud rose with a smile from
his chair.</p>

<p>"No, no, my friend, that is clear, and the Superintendent never
meant that you should," he said gaily. "But one thing, you can tell
us, the great boum to whom the package was addressed."</p>

<p>"The Big Noise," Mr. Ricardo said usefully to a rather perplexed
managing clerk.</p>

<p>"Yes. You certainly have a right to the name," the managing
clerk replied. "It was the name of Septimus Crottle, the Head of
the great Dagger Line, and it was addressed to him at his private
residence, 41A, Portman Square."</p>

<br>
FEARS, DOUBTS, CURIOSITY</h2>

<p class="first">Dinner was finished. The windows were open and the
road across Grosvenor Square was quiet as a country lane. Yet even
so, it was hardly more quiet than the dining-room where the three
men sat about Mr. Ricardo's round table. Four pale blue candles,
set in tall, painted candlesticks of Battersea enamel burned, and
no other light. The three men had pushed their coffee cups aside;
they were smoking; but they were not talking, until Mr. Ricardo,
embarrassed by the silence, must needs break it with a not very
happy fancy.</p>

<p>"My four candles burn in the dusk like little flaming spears,
the brighter as the darkness grows. I have two flaming spears one
on each side of me, and the blacker the problem, the more
brilliantly they will pierce it."</p>

<p>Hanaud shook his head. It was difficult for Ricardo to gauge the
hooded look of his face, but he replied with a gravity in his voice
which Ricardo had heard only once or twice before. "For myself, I
could find a better image in one of your candles than a spear
pointing to the truth."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"A heart turned upside down."</p>

<p>Julius Ricardo was as much startled by the quiet voice as by the
strange figure which he used. "By what?" he began, but he felt
Maltby's hand close upon his arm. Hanaud, however, answered the
unfinished question.</p>

<p>"By fear."</p>

<p>And for a moment the darkness seemed to deepen and the
illumination of the candles to grow dim.</p>

<p>"I have been feeling like a man who is sent to find a number in
one of the narrow corridors of your new hotels. You cannot find it,
and at the end the corridor turns, and again the corridor turns,
and again you cannot find the room. But for me, I meet fear."</p>

<p>Once more there was silence, but Ricardo no longer wished to
interrupt it, and Maltby's hand was withdrawn from his sleeve. Then
Hanaud resumed:</p>

<p>"Permit that I tell you how it grew. First we have a suicide, a
thing simple, and with the Horburys almost natural. The razor close
to the throat, as the good Foster said. But not now. The business
is up, up, up. Horbury's Newsbag becomes Horbury's nosebag. The
great poster will be on all the streets. Laughter and money and
cocks porping&mdash;yes, yes, yes. But suicide. No!"</p>

<p>"There was the chart," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"The chart Horbury leans over to hide from the Foster eyes, I do
not forget him. One cannot doubt what he represented with his black
glass pins with the white ensign, and the last pin jammed in
angrily opposite to the Prawle Station. It marked the journey of
that old steamship El Rey, the ports she had put into to deliver
back her unsatisfactory visitors, the Lloyds Stations she had
signalled. A trouble, yes. A danger, perhaps; but to be met
to-morrow. That night, no danger at all. El Rey was still upon its
way. It was rounding Beachy Head."</p>

<p>"That's quite right," Maltby agreed. "There was a clerk from
Horbury's office at Gravesend to meet El Rey in the morning.
Horbury couldn't have expected Devisher."</p>

<p>"Yet he took with him to White Barn the chart?" said Hanaud,
pursuing his own thoughts. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," answered Maltby. He leaned back and drew at
his cigar with a greater ease than he had shown before. "He had
tried to hide it already from Foster. He wanted to get rid of
it."</p>

<p>"And he certainly did," cried Mr. Ricardo, clenching the matter
finally with a rather irritating laugh.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Hanaud swiftly.</p>

<p>"There was a log fire," Mr. Ricardo replied no less swiftly.</p>

<p>"Saperlipopette!" cried Hanaud, beating with his fist on the
table. "That will not do. That tough white paper of which the
charts are made. That little flat ebony board. All burnt up in a
small log fire so that not an ash of blackened paper, not a
splinter of the board, not even a brass drawing-pin is left to tell
us here it was burnt. I am for the miracle, yes; but miracles must
be reasonable."</p>

<p>It did occur to Ricardo that the question whether a miracle
could be a miracle if it was reasonable might be a diverting
subject for a debating society. But Hanaud was too much in earnest.
He had never known Hanaud utter that explosive outrage of a
word&mdash;Saperlipopette&mdash;unless he was in his most serious
mood. So without flippancy he suggested: "That chart may have been
overlooked in White Barn."</p>

<p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders. "My dear friend! The English
police! They may be accused of the want of imagination, perhaps,
but they do not overlook things, no, not anything. And a little
chart nailed on an ebony board with glass pins pricked in? No, no,
let us be serious."</p>

<p>"All the more serious," added Maltby imperturbably, "because a
second search was made in White Barn after we had left Horbury's
office this evening and nothing was found."</p>

<p>"Very well." Mr. Ricardo would accept the disappearance of the
chart by another agency than the log fire. The explanation was to
be found with the explanation of Horbury's death in Hanaud's hinted
theory of the morning.</p>

<p>"Very well. The man Devisher comes to White Barn. It is the
address of Horbury which he remembers. He comes late, he quarrels,
having good reason for a quarrel. He murders&mdash;that was your
fear&mdash;and, taking the chart with him, he goes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>The abrupt question shot at him across the table brought Mr.
Ricardo to a stop. After all, that was to be considered, and at
once a mountain of difficulties confronted him. Devisher had
arrived probably at half-past three in London, in a borrowed suit
of clothes, what was left of fifteen pounds after his fare and his
luncheon had been paid, and no luggage. He had found his way to
Lordship Lane, if the theory of a revengeful murder were accepted,
unnoticed, and had unnoticed got away in the middle of the night to
some place where he could lie in safety.</p>

<p>"Ever since you gave us his name and description, the search has
gone on," said Maltby gloomily. "Hotels, lodging-houses,
shelters&mdash;a man without passport or luggage."</p>

<p>"Add that he has not been in England or in touch with anyone in
England for seven years, shall we say?&mdash;and then that he
disappears as easily as if he had a place in every thieves' kitchen
in London&mdash;that is hard to believe."</p>

<p>"But it might happen," cried Mr. Ricardo, "and perhaps it might
be the more likely to happen if he were unaware that I was looking
for him."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud threw up his hands.</p>

<p>"We lose ourselves in the dialectic. We make up the fairy tale.
We sober policemen! I tell you my trouble."</p>

<p>He pushed everything away from in front of him&mdash;plates,
cups and saucers, table-mats&mdash;making an empty space as though
he were about to deal a pack of cards.</p>

<p>"In the first place, there is no reason for suicide. The
excellent Foster makes that clear. In the second, Horbury has a
poor little wretch whom he has injured, due to arrive in England
this morning. Horbury has made his arrangements that the man shall
be met. That he was afraid of him there is no sign. But the man was
already in England. It may be that he made his way to White Barn
last night. It may be that he murdered Horbury&mdash;just settling
his account. I do not say no. But I do not say yes. I say that if
he was at White Barn, taking a desperate chance, he blundered in
upon some much bigger affair, and must be hidden away now."</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby pushed out his underlip and glowered at
the mahogany table.</p>

<p>"I haven't got that," he protested. "Devisher was not alone, or,
at all events, ceased to be alone? Of course, his disappearance, a
man without money or luggage or friends&mdash;yes, I suppose you
might infer that there were others, or one other, who was concerned
in seeing that he got safely away."</p>

<p>"And the wife," Hanaud added quickly. "Olivia Horbury. Let us
not forget her. Whatever we told her, whatever we showed her, she
was not startled. Full of horror, as anyone would be who was forced
to live over again some dreadful hours, but surprised&mdash;no. She
knew. She was present. Yet she would not speak."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she had been cowed..." Ricardo began, but he suffered
his very frequent experience of never being allowed to finish a
sentence.</p>

<p>"Ah! Ah! Ah!" exclaimed Hanaud. "I see you. But she was not
cowed to-day with the police at the gate and in the house. Then
what was the compulsion which shut her lips? Something
grim&mdash;something brutal. The sure knowledge that if she spoke,
she would follow on the husband's road. Oh, there was someone else
at White Barn last night, and that someone returned."</p>

<p>"Devisher?" Mr. Ricardo suggested "To recover the chart on the
ebony board."</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head once or twice, dissatisfied but unable to
disregard the argument. "It may be. He would not want the chart
discovered. It points too clearly towards him."</p>

<p>"But you yourself think that someone else came for something
else?" said Maltby.</p>

<p>There was amusement in his voice and, at the same time, respect.
It was amusing that Hanaud should so shut his eyes to the obvious
explanations of Horbury's death, suicide or murder by Bryan
Devisher; that he should chase in his mind some phantasm of his own
creation. And yet, he had the power to leave one uneasy. That image
of a narrow corridor, and another, and another, and at the
end&mdash;fear. Maltby certainly did not like it.</p>

<p>"You think Mrs. Horbury is in danger?" he said.</p>

<p>"That, I think, could be," replied Hanaud.</p>

<p>"From Devisher?" Maltby persisted, and Hanaud suddenly thrust
forth his hands, palms outwards.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! My Maltby. I am not here to make the confusion, to
tickle you with the red-hot poker. Joey in the woodpile. No! I
abandon you for your delight and go upon my vacancy."</p>

<p>And the three men lost at once their tension. Cigars were
renewed, a business-like decanter of Armagnac went forth upon its
rounds. Maltby, Ricardo, both were at pains to discover the ideal
place where Hanaud might pass his vacancy. "Margate," said Maltby.
Ricardo plumped for Brighton. But the unaccountable Hanaud had
already his own plan.</p>

<p>"Cathedrals," he said "I like to sit on the pavement under a
stripy awning at a marble table and look at them. They are solid.
If I cross the road to one and say, 'I arrest you,' it does not
mind. It just says, 'Here is that foolish little Hanaud,' and very
far away, in the depths of her, I hear a chuckle. Yes, I shall to
see a cathedral to-morrow. I am told she is very beautiful."</p>

<p>It was astonishing, even to Ricardo, to discover so much romance
under the practical urgency of Hanaud's character, but he was
startled to hear the Frenchman add: "She has what is rare, perhaps,
the flying buttocks."</p>

<p>Maltby jumped in his chair. Mr. Ricardo looked, coldly at his
friend. "A French cathedral, no doubt," he commented acidly.</p>

<p>"No, no!" Monsieur Hanaud was as serious as a man could be. "I
shall not give you the laugh by pronouncing the barbaric word of
the city which she makes beautiful. No, I shall lead a porter at
the rail way station to a board. I shall point with my stick, I
shall press money into his thorny hand."</p>

<p>"Horny," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"And I shall say," continued Hanaud, without paying the
slightest attention to Ricardo's interruption, "'Please to buy me
the go and return ticket to that unpronounceable place. For I am
now upon my vacancy.'"</p>

<p>Superintendent Maltby stubbed out the butt of his cigar into an
ashtray.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the porter's reaction to your request," he
said, and then the smile left his face. "So you give up?" he cried
with a challenge in his voice; and, indeed, that was to Ricardo the
most astounding factor in the whole case. Hanaud gave up. He would
go on a vacancy and moon under a stripy awning on Gothic
architecture.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Maltby. You shall have your way. You shall make
that amusing Horbury a fellow of the sea. It shall all be as you
wish. And yet I hope that when I come back and have my little
meeting with the adorable Madame Horbury and carry off my cheque
for the patient Gravot of the Place Vendôme, you, as you say
good-bye, will tell me something I much wish to know."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Superintendent Maltby put his interrogation suspiciously.
"And what is that something?"</p>

<p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders. He flapped a hand and flung the
subject away. Yet he was curious.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would like to know what switchback business had to write
to big business. What Horbury's Newsbag had to say to the great
Dagger Line of Steamships. And what Daniel Horbury enclosed to
Septimus Crottle in so carefully sealed an envelope."</p>

<p>"But that letter has disappeared," cried Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Precisely, my friend," Hanaud returned. "That is why I am
curious."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"><small>CHAPTER 14</small></a><br>
<br>
A MEETING IS ARRANGED</h2>

<p class="first">When the unobtrusive Thompson slid into Mr.
Ricardo's bedroom the next morning with his morning tea, carried
over land through how many countries, lest one tang of the sea
should tincture its fragrance, he carried in upon the tray a note
from Hanaud. Mr. Ricardo was grateful. No man was less
hail-fellow-well-met in the morning, than he. Rosy-cheeked people
who hardly knocked before they bustled in, nephews and nieces and
such-like modern importunities, were not allowed. The act of
getting up was a slow and quiet ritual, to be conducted without
words. Not until he was afoot and dressed would he consider with
what rocks and stones and trees he was to be rolled round in
earth's diurnal course.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a desire to do what he could for his
friend that he opened his note. Mr. Ricardo read that Hanaud had
put off his visit to the unpronounceable city owing to the
persistence of a surprising idea. He himself must see this Septimus
Crottle. He had no authority by which he could claim an interview.
He was of no account in this Horbury affair. It was even possible
that Septimus had never heard the name of Hanaud, for nothing was
more curious than the smallness of the orbits within which fame was
circumscribed. As Mr. Ricardo had himself observed, no one could
answer what Mr. Gladstone had said in 1884. Well, then, it would be
desirable that Hanaud should have an introduction to Septimus
Crottle, and who could give it but that excellent Mister the
Captain Mordaunt, who, one might think&mdash;No? Yes?&mdash;had a
passion for introducing strangers to Septimus Crottle. Monsieur
Hanaud threw himself at the feet of his dear friend. 'I understand,
the note concluded, that Septimus Crottle is difficult, but as you
know I am at my best with difficult people. You have seen me at
work. I am inspired, I soar.' and he signed in his usual style as a
peer of the realm.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo derided the signature and scoffed in his mild way at
the vanity of the writer. But he, too, was reluctant to leave this
odd matter of Horbury's letter to Septimus Crottle undiscovered. He
wanted to know the answer to a host of other questions besides. Who
had come to the house and lifted the telephone receiver in the
early morning? Why had Olivia Horbury locked her door? And when?
And why, with Horbury's Newsbag ready to become Horbury's Nosebag,
had Horbury drawn that unusual blue-handled knife across his
carotid artery&mdash;if he had?</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo accordingly rose, dressed with his usual
circumspection, and found Captain Mordaunt preparing to eat his
luncheon at his club and more than a little worried. He drew
Ricardo into the bar as if he had been his dearest friend. "A
cocktail before we lunch?"</p>

<p>The invitation was, in the modern phrase, telescoped. "I'd
rather have a Manzanilla," said Mr. Ricardo, and the barman gazed
at him with the awe due to a customer who knew of a drink unknown
to the barman.</p>

<p>"We're just out of it, sir," he said. He thought of embroidering
his statement with the news that there had been a great run lately
on that there drink, but the theme was dangerous.</p>

<p>"A glass of your driest sherry, then," said Mr. Ricardo, and
with Uncle Pepe the barman walked on solid ground.</p>

<p>At luncheon, Mordaunt began whilst Mr. Ricardo was still
twittering. Maltby had called on him this morning, Maltby with an
infernal fellow with a notebook. Where was Bryan Devisher? Why
wasn't his arrival notified to the authorities? Etcetera,
etcetera.</p>

<p>"I am bound to say that Maltby was pleasant," Mordaunt
continued. "He seemed to know already all that I was telling
him."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo smiled wisely. "He was checking up the statement I
had already made."</p>

<p>Mordaunt stared at his companion and leaned forward eagerly.
"Perhaps you can help, Mr. Ricardo. I must leave England on Monday.
Ticket taken, cabin booked. All that could stop me would be the
police."</p>

<p>"You're not involved in any way," said Mr. Ricardo confidently.
"You did all that a reasonable man in a hurry could be expected to
do. I am here. We told the same story, no doubt. I am sure that
Maltby won't want you to stay."</p>

<p>Captain Mordaunt was greatly relieved. His voice lightened, his
face lost its gloom and, as he looked at the trim and decorous Mr.
Ricardo, a smile came and went upon his lips.</p>

<p>"So there is an affair of a kind?" he suggested. Mr. Ricardo
seemed to weigh his inclination to talk against his reticence as an
unofficial sleuth. "Yes. I can say so much&mdash;there is," he said
darkly.</p>

<p>"And you are in it, of course."</p>

<p>In a whisper, attended by a knowing smile, Mr. Ricardo replied:
"Up to the neck."</p>

<p>"Crime, then?"</p>

<p>Crime, the wonderful word. It drew the two men together in a
net. That crime fascinated Mr. Ricardo was known to all his
acquaintances. But were they not fascinated, too? Let a man say in
any company that he has been present at the Old Bailey when any
crime is being probed and established, a silence will follow upon
his words, however carelessly he may speak them. He may be merely
the dullard, the last-wicket-rabbit brought in to make up the
party, but at once he becomes the cynosure. He will be plied with
questions. He will not relapse into obscurity until all that he can
contribute on the characters, the passions, and the event which
have woven the dark pattern, has been brought to light. And even
then each one of the party with a small pang of regret, reflect:
"If only I had been in his place, I should have noticed so much
more."</p>

<p>So now Captain Mordaunt, though his hopes were cast overseas,
leaned forward with shining eyes. "Yes. You are known to be a
student of crime, Mr. Ricardo."</p>

<p>At such moments Mr. Ricardo was apt to become a trifle fatuous.
He laughed affectedly. "Not really? A dilettante, perhaps. But a
student? Well, perhaps others might say so."</p>

<p>"Maltby said that you had got the little Frenchman with
you."</p>

<p>"Little! My dear Mordaunt! He's as big as a bull and quite as
obstreperous."</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet him," said Mordaunt; and there was a great
deal more than mere curiosity in the warmth of his voice.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Ricardo, "nothing could be easier."</p>

<p>He had his cue, and over the luncheon table he told Mordaunt all
that he knew of the Horbury puzzle.</p>

<p>"Devisher has disappeared. Yes, an ominous fact. Yet Hanaud
seems to set as much&mdash;no, I am inexact&mdash;more importance
upon the sealed letter with the enclosures addressed by Horbury to
Septimus Crottle. Has he received it? If so, why does he keep it to
himself? Does he know nothing about it? Hanaud would very much like
to make Crottle's acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Septimus Crottle is a queer old bird," said Mordaunt
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"A crotchety patriarch, I think you called him," Mr. Ricardo
added. "Hanaud is aware that he must tread gently."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the old man doesn't," replied Mordaunt. "He's a
trampler." He thought for a moment. "I tell you what. We'll have
some coffee and a cigar upstairs whilst I see what I can do."</p>

<p>They went upstairs to the smoking-room. Coffee and liqueurs of
brandy were put beside them on small stools.</p>

<p>"Cigars," ordered Mordaunt, and at once Mr. Ricardo broke
in.</p>

<p>"Claro, please! At this hour not a Colorado."</p>

<p>"Good God, man," Mordaunt exclaimed, "I'm not offering you a
beetle;" and, having established Mr. Ricardo in comfort, he went
off to the telephone office. He returned in a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>"It is all right. I didn't mention the letter or, indeed,
anything about Horbury's death. I should think he'll go straight up
in the air when he hears that Horbury has written to him at all.
But that's your pigeon. All I said was that Hanaud and you want to
have a word with him."</p>

<p>"And he's willing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A nice bit of crime, you know! I am going to him on Sunday
evening and I'll take you and the Frenchman with me. But I warn
you. You have got to fit in. Sunday night is his company night.
There's a ritual. The family, one or two friends. We have a glass
of port, then someone reads a book, then the girls&mdash;there
isn't one of them under thirty&mdash;are sent off to bed, and then
you'll get your conversation. You're not to dress, and you have
your dinner before you go. I'll come to your house at ten minutes
to eight."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo drew back. The order of the day was not to him a
phrase for committees.</p>

<p>"Then we must dine at seven!" he exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, the old man moves with the times," said Mordaunt. "When he
was captain of the steam-packet Tunis he dined at six."</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"><small>CHAPTER 15</small></a><br>
<br>
SEPTIMUS READS A BOOK</h2>

<p class="first">Septimus Crottle lived in a big Victorian house in
a big Victorian way. There was now no outward sign upon him that he
had not lived upon the land all his life. The weather had faded
from his cheeks, and neither an eye of steel nor an aura of
tremendous authority are qualities limited to sea captains. It
might, indeed, have been Mr. Dombey who received his three new
guests at eight o'clock of the evening in his dining-room in
Portman Square. He wore a long frock-coat of broadcloth, and above
the folds of a black satin neckcloth, decorated with a single pearl
of great size, two sharp points of white and glossy collar clipped
his face.</p>

<p>"You will drink a glass of port, gentlemen," Septimus said.
"Mary, set some chairs and glasses."</p>

<p>There was no manservant in the house; patriarchs, after all, are
waited upon by maidens. Mary cleared three places at the long
table, one upon Crottle's right for Monsieur Hanaud and two upon
his left for Mordaunt and Mr. Ricardo. The ladies, of course, had
already retired to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I welcome you to my house, Monsieur Hanaud," said Septimus,
holding up his glass of wine.</p>

<p>"It was gracious of you to invite me, Mr. Crottle," Hanaud
returned, holding up his.</p>

<p>Both men bowed and drank, and Hanaud, as he put his glass down,
exclaimed in an ecstasy: "And this is a wonderful glass of Porto
which you are giving me!"</p>

<p>"It's the best," said Septimus, quite simply. "It's mine.
George, fill Monsieur Hanaud's glass."</p>

<p>A fair-haired youth upon Ricardo's right obeyed with a broad
grin upon his face and a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"The guv'nor decanted it himself from his own private bin,
Monsieur Hanaud," he said genially. "There aren't many to whom he
shows that consideration."</p>

<p>Hanaud tasted his wine and looked up at the ceiling. He tasted
it again and held it for a long time in his mouth, and swallowed it
at last slowly, with his eyes closed. Mr. Ricardo was disgusted
with his friend's behaviour. To Hanaud, Porto was Porto, and the
blacker it was and the stickier it was, the more Hanaud enjoyed it.
"Look at the hypocrite," Mr. Ricardo said to himself. "He's
obsequious."</p>

<p>But obviously Septimus was pleased. "I shall offer you a cigar,"
he continued, "but I am afraid that must wait until after our
reading. Mean while I should like to present to you my nephew,
George Crottle. The gentleman sitting on the other side of Captain
Mordaunt you may perhaps know."</p>

<p>Hanaud looked at a thin, tall, narrow man with a grey
moustache.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said with an air of surprise as he held out his
hand. "I certainly have had the honour to meet him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Alan Preedy is one of the Line's solicitors."</p>

<p>"But in a very small way," Preedy put in modestly. "I don't
aspire to famous cases."</p>

<p>"No doubt they will come," Hanaud protested.</p>

<p>"But not, I hope, in connection with the Dagger Line," said
George Crottle in mock dismay.</p>

<p>"I think that is unlikely," said Septimus, with a touch of
irritation in his voice. "I have another nephew "&mdash;and the
irritation was still audible&mdash;"who apparently is not giving us
the pleasure of his company to-night."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," Preedy interrupted rather eagerly, as
if he recognised that a smooth relationship between the elder and
the younger branches of the Crottle firm was one of his duties. "I
fancy Mr. James arrived a moment ago."</p>

<p>Septimus turned his head and listened.</p>

<p>"I can't hear a sound," said George. "Old James has carted us,
this night of all nights, when our Uncle Septimus is reading."</p>

<p>Septimus looked at his nephew with approval, but Alan Preedy
still appeared for the absent one.</p>

<p>"It was a taxi stopping at the door which I heard, and the
passing of change makes the driver, as a rule, undress himself by
several layers of clothes. Ah, there he is!"</p>

<p>Alan Preedy had hardly finished before the housebell rang, but
he had finished. Mr. Ricardo looked with admiration at the lawyer,
upon whose face there rose a blush.</p>

<p>"Yes," said George gaily to Ricardo, "if I wanted to listen at a
keyhole, I should brief Preedy as my substitute. It's quite a
gift."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud seemed to be concentrating his attention upon
his Porto, and said nothing.</p>

<p>James Crottle, a tall, dark and grim young man, entered the
room. He made his apologies to his uncle, clapped Preedy heartily
upon the shoulder, and said with a laugh:</p>

<p>"The law's delays are nothing to a taxicab's."</p>

<p>He nodded to Mordaunt, was introduced to Hanaud and Ricardo, and
took his seat at the table on the side of the Frenchman. The
difference between him and George was remarkable. George, the
fair-haired youth, seemed by comparison with him of almost feminine
good looks. There was a supple grace in his slim figure and a
friendliness in his smile and eyes which James was without. James
leaned a little forward and said to Hanaud: "My uncle did not tell
us that we were to have the honour to-night of meeting anyone so
distinguished as you."</p>

<p>There was just a hint of a question in his words which Septimus
took up: "Monsieur Hanaud has, I gather, some matter of importance
which he wishes to talk over with me after wards."</p>

<p>Coffee was brought in on a great silver tray, and Ricardo, under
such security as the clatter of the cups granted him, said to his
neighbour, Alan Preedy: "This is to me the greatest blessing of the
evening so far. For keep my head from nodding during a reading,
that I cannot do."</p>

<p>"Septimus isn't so bad," Preedy returned. "It's his turn to read
to-night, thank the Lord! You'll see, he'll probably keep you
awake."</p>

<p>At that moment the parlourmaid entered the room and announced to
Septimus that the ladies were assembled in the drawing-room and
that the clock had struck the hour three minutes ago.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose that we had better go, Mary," he said with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and the room all prepared as if it was for a Church
Service," she answered.</p>

<p>For perhaps a minute Mr. Septimus did not budge, a little colour
rose into his face, the smile remained upon his mouth, and a
sparkle of fire revived the youth of his eyes. He looked and smiled
straight ahead of him, savouring in advance the small ritual of the
assembly, the resonance of his voice, the stillness of his audience
as he held it in a magic web. There was romance in these Sunday
nights for Septimus Crottle. At this hour, once in every fourth
week, he recaptured some shadow of the thrill and glory of his
first command. When he opened the book, he stepped again upon his
bridge. He was no longer the owner of the Dagger Line, concerned
with questions of policy, he was the young Lord and Master of his
ship, of its passengers, its crew and its cargo. He stood at the
pilot's side in Southampton Water with his eyes fixed upon tropical
harbours, where after weeks of vigilance he would hear the
thunderous rattle of the anchor chains in the bows. He rose from
his chair, his old wrinkled face eager and radiant. "Let us go!" he
cried on a rising note.</p>

<p>Mordaunt noticed the change and smiled. "He has dropped his
pilot. He has set his course between the Spithead Forts for the
Nab. Has he the clusters of palm trees in his vision, a scent of
strange perfumes in his nostrils, the sing-song of coolies in his
ears? And he's only stepping from a dining-room to a drawing-room
in Portman Square."</p>

<p>But this was Mordaunt's thought and his alone. It was prompted
by the same instinctive sympathy which had once made him row down
Helford River to Passage to hear some home-truths from this
redoubtable old man.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was not given to such fancies. He was simply
troubled by the knowledge that for an hour, in a room where every
curtain, every piece of furniture was certain to offend the eye, he
must listen to this old fellow droning out the pages of a book.
Monsieur Hanaud, for his part, was puzzled, and he was showing that
he was puzzled&mdash;showing it so much indeed that as he walked
towards the door of the room, he felt a hand upon his sleeve. He
turned and saw George Crottle at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Something, I can see, is perplexing you, Monsieur Hanaud. Can I
help?"</p>

<p>Hanaud was at once all contrition and apology. He stammered, he
spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"It was an impoliteness... I beg you to forgive. The habit grows
of itself... One asks oneself the questions, and suddenly one is
guilty of an inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," George replied. "I could see you looking from James
to me and from me to James."</p>

<p>Hanaud was more confused than ever. "I had no right to make the
comparison," he said.</p>

<p>"No. And I should not have been surprised. So often one sees
it&mdash;in brothers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who don't seem to belong to the same litter, eh?" George
returned with a laugh. "James!" and the dark young man turned back
from the door.</p>

<p>"'What is it?" he asked, not too pleasantly.</p>

<p>"All is discovered! We are lost!" George resumed, and he turned
again to Hanaud. "You are right, Monsieur Hanaud, we are not
brothers at all, and, what's more, our names aren't even
Crottle."</p>

<p>James uttered a small cry of impatience and followed the rest of
the party out of the room. George, however, detained the Frenchman.
He burst into a laugh as he watched James's abrupt departure. "You
may as well have the facts, Monsieur, especially as they throw an
amusing light on Uncle Sep's quarter-deck style."</p>

<p>Uncle Sep's sister Maria had married William Martindale, and had
had one son, George. But William Martindale was already a widower
with a stepson by his first marriage, James Urquhart. Thus both
James and George were in no blood relationship to each other.
William Martindale was himself a partner in a firm of small
prosperity, and upon his death, Septimus bought up the Line, added
the few good cargo ships which it owned to the Dagger fleet, and
took both boys into the management. James was by three years the
elder, but George was the actual nephew, and it was generally
understood that on Crottle's death or retirement, George Martindale
would become Chairman of the Line. James, however, was to be left
substantially in it, a director and a partner.</p>

<p>"Then one morning," continued George, "we both woke up to read
in The Times that we had changed our names to Crottle. It isn't
what you'd call a pretty name and, as you could see, James is still
peeved about it&mdash;all the more because the old man, neither
before nor since, has ever said a word about it to either of us. He
just did it&mdash;the bit of brimstone in our treacle, but there's
such a lot of treacle that I, at all events, didn't notice the
bitter taste at all."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud thanked him for the explanation, and added: "It
is, after all, natural that Mr. Crottle should like to leave his
name associated with the great Dagger Line. One day, no doubt, he
will be Lord Crottle."</p>

<p>"Not he," cried George with a laugh. "He's Mr. Crottle of the
Dagger Line&mdash;and proud of it."</p>

<p>But they were in the doorway of the drawing-room now, where
conversation was exchanged in low voices, as if they were all in
the porch of a church. Monsieur Hanaud was presented by George to
the three daughters of Septimus. It was Mordaunt's story that the
Patriarch had turned a most deliberate back upon suitors for their
hands. Certainly all three of them were in their thirties. Anne,
the youngest, a large handsome woman with a high colour and
pronounced features; Audrey, smaller, prettier, but beginning to
look a little like a horse; and Agatha, the eternal spinster,
angular, acrimonious, awkward. Her hair, gathered in a tight bun,
was already grey, and her face, with its high thin nose and a
bitter mouth, had lost, so worn it was and tired, any pretension to
charm which it might have had. She gave Monsieur Hanaud a hand so
thin that it caused him a little shock, as though he had shaken
hands with a skeleton; and whereas the other two sisters had shown
some little excitement, not at meeting him, but at the recurrence
of this weekly ceremonial, she greeted him with a dull eye and a
languid voice. "I hope you won't be too bored."</p>

<p>"I?" exclaimed Hanaud. "But I am never bored, even when there is
reason to be. So how could I be bored here?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo caught the words and once more whispered
"hypocrite." The room was just what he expected. Not one artistic
nerve in him but twanged distressfully. The curtains were of
crimson rep with pelmets disfigured by yellow rectangles; the
chairs of black painted wood, with thin gold lines, were
upholstered tightly in black and green silk with buttons sunk in
little pits; and wherever an antimacassar could be hung, it was
hung. One particular piece shook Mr. Ricardo to his centre&mdash;a
cabinet without a curve, made in black painted wood. There was an
oblong bevelled mirror in the raised central back, and below the
level surface two cupboards with bouquets of roses painted on the
doors. His eye, indeed, rested with pleasure upon an oval mahogany
table, a Regency cabinet in white and gold in a corner of the room,
and an arm-chair by Chippendale in which Septimus was to sit. An
electric lamp with a green shade burned upon the table, and the
book from which Septimus Crottle was to read lay closed within the
circle of light.</p>

<p>"All ready?" asked George of the company, and each one took the
seat arranged. The chairs were grouped in an irregular curve. Thus
Hanaud was sitting almost behind old Mr. Crottle's shoulder; two
daughters, Anne and Audrey, came next; the lawyer, Preedy, sat at
the head of the table, and Agatha was at his right. Mr. Ricardo sat
at Agatha's right and beyond her Mordaunt. George occupied the end
of the table fronting Alan Preedy, and between George and his uncle
was an empty place for James. Thus, in a free space, sat Mr.
Septimus Crottle of the Dagger Line.</p>

<p>It was remarkable how clearly that order was established in
Ricardo's mind; for his was not a tidy mind. Yet he had hardly to
shut his eyes, before he could see each one of those ten people
sitting upright and stiff, side by side. It is, perhaps, still more
remarkable that Ricardo grasped exactly why the positions were so
accurately registered in his memory.</p>

<p>"All ready?" asked George at the table; and at once, by gesture
or word, assent was made. Mr. Ricardo expected that now the book
would be opened and the reading begin. But George cried over his
shoulder "Go!" and James switched off the lights of the room. There
was only one left burning, that of the lamp with the green shade
upon the table. James slipped into the empty chair. The room sank
to darkness, the ugliness of its equipment vanished. Above the
coats of the men and the dresses of the women an arc of faces
gleamed, all set towards the one lamp, faces lifeless and pallid as
masks; and Mr. Ricardo understood that, however dull the book and
however inadequate the reader, not once would his head nod or his
eyes close until the reading was finished.</p>

<p>He was conscious of an excitement which ran through his veins
and throbbed in his ears. For a moment or two he could not trace it
to its source. There was the old man with his wrinkled features in
the full bright light and, in spite of his frock-coat and
upstanding stock, of some obvious brotherhood with the sea. There
was, above the green shade of the lamp, the circle of white dead
faces. But to neither of these causes was due the expectancy racing
through him. He came to the explanation at last and, though he knew
it for an illusion and the merest of accidents, it did not lose its
hold. The book which lay upon the table directly beneath the lamp
was bound in cloth of exactly the same pale colour as the painted
handle of the knife which had caused Horbury's death. It shone in
the gloom of that room; it alone shone: it claimed the eyes; it
seemed to Ricardo to make a promise&mdash;or perhaps a threat. More
likely a threat, since it was with a definite relief that he saw
the old man's thickly-veined hands open the book somewhere towards
the end where a ribbon marked the place.</p>

<p>Septimus began to read. For a little while Ricardo did not
notice the theme of the book. Words followed words in the rhythm of
prose&mdash;so much he observed, but he was too surprised by the
voice of the reader to take to himself their meaning. The voice was
clear and musical and muted to the compass of the room, but it was
troubled, so troubled that the reader seemed to find in this
far-off story of Marie Antoinette&mdash;for here and there her name
came and went amongst the words&mdash;some quite personal and
startling application. Mr. Ricardo began to listen now to what was
read, and it was read so faithfully that the stodgy room in Portman
Square vanished altogether, and he moved in the squalor of the
Conciergerie, amongst ruffianly gaolers and elegant dandies and
great ladies awaiting, with a jest to hide their fears, the creak
and rumble of the tumbrils at door. Against that background the
wail of a boy rose and fell like a tide.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette had paid for the folly of her and her
inadequate life. Septimus read of the Dauphin&mdash;a boy, sickly,
spoilt, but punished by such drawn-out cruelty as, even in these
days, few boys have endured. He needed playmates of his own age, he
was allowed none. He wanted fresh air, open fields, sunlight and
good food. He was given instead the foul, overbreathed vapours of
the Conciergerie, a small cell with a high small window on a hall,
and once a day a word or two of abuse from his gaoler as his food
and his jug of water were brought in to him. The Dauphin of France
was too dangerous a magnet for all that was left in France or
abroad of the old regime. But he couldn't be tried. He couldn't be
sent to the guillotine. Even the rabble shrank from that abominable
horror. What the most abject slander could do to asperse his
character was done. But it was not enough. He must disappear. So he
was left, locked up in his cell, a child without books, without
clean linen, without a doctor, without a mother, to get through
each day and night and the next and the next as best he could.
Finally the gaoler ceased to show his face or utter a word. Once a
day a panel was opened, food and water were pushed through, and the
panel was closed again. That was all. And after an
eternity&mdash;of what torrents of tears, of what gusts of passion,
of what lonely despair!&mdash;neither the plate of food, nor the
jug of water were touched. For twenty-four hours, for forty-eight
hours they were left, and then for the first time in weeks the door
of the dark cell was unlocked.</p>

<p>Old Septimus read so far, controlling his voice, but stopping
now and again to control it, and bending his head a little lower
over the page. Then suddenly he stopped, closed the book, and
raised a face so ravaged with horror, so old beyond all age, that
it imposed silence upon all that company. It was a silence as heavy
as a pall, and it was broken at last by one deep sigh.</p>

<p>Every head had been lowered or shaded by a hand or fixed upon
the reader, and all had been a little dazed. That one deep sigh
must have seemed to have been breathed by a corporate voice, to
have issued from the blended emotions of them all. But it was a
shock to all. It jarred upon all except Septimus Crottle at the
table. He was still in the Conciergerie, standing at the door of
the cell as the key at last grated in the lock. But to the rest it
was grievous. There had been no pity in it, no horror, no refusal.
Construed into words it meant "At last!" Something long sought for
had been discovered.</p>

<p>Septimus finished before his hour was up, but at the end of a
chapter, so that it was natural that he should halt there. He
closed the book slowly after marking the page with the ribbon, and
said in a voice which surprised the audience, so unmoved and
ordinary it was once more: "I think we can stop this book here and
choose another one for our next Sunday."</p>

<p>He rose, and the bright sheen of the blue cover moved out of the
circle of light, to Ricardo's relief. Septimus walked to a table
which stood under a window at the end of the room. It had a drawer
with a couple of gilt handles. Septimus pulled one of them, but the
drawer remained closed. For a moment he was puzzled, and a
frightened voice cried "Father, it's locked."</p>

<p>The cry sprang from the mouth of Agatha. She jumped up and,
pushing the chairs apart, hurried to the mantelshelf. But she was
too late. For even while she was fumbling in a china box set on a
ledge by the mirror, Septimus pulled the handle again. But this
time it was a tug, a jerk, and with a crack the drawer burst
open.</p>

<p>"It was locked. Why?"</p>

<p>"The key caught in one's dress."</p>

<p>Agatha showed the key to Septimus. It was rather long.</p>

<p>"You see how it juts out. I took it from the lock." But Septimus
had still one foot in the Conciergerie. He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"The drawer's no use to me now," he said, and Hanaud was already
at his side. Cumbrous though he was, no one moved so swiftly, so
unsuspiciously as Hanaud when he chose. "Can I help, Monsieur
Crottle?" he asked, and he laid his hand upon the top of the open
drawer.</p>

<p>"No, the lock's broken," interposed Agatha. "It's a gimcrack
affair, anyway," and as in the room the lights were turned up she
shut the drawer so violently that Hanaud had barely time to snatch
his hand away.</p>

<p>"Did I catch your fingers?" Agatha asked, staring at him
angrily, and obviously hopeful that she had.</p>

<p>"No, no, mademoiselle." Hanaud returned with a smile. "You would
have to be quicker than that."</p>

<p>He turned towards Crottle, who walked to the one solid piece of
furniture in the room&mdash;a Chippendale bureau which stood
against a wall opposite to the cabinet. It had a bookcase with
shelves and glass doors on the top and below it a front which could
be let down to make a writing-table. Septimus Crottle let the front
down, pushed the book in, locked up the front again, and pocketed
the key. He said in a curious, hard, resentful voice, which
astonished no one who had heard him reading, and would have
astonished anyone who had not: "I never want to see that book
again."</p>

<p>He was once more Septimus Crottle, the owner of the great Dagger
Line. He stepped out to Mordaunt. "You're off to-morrow, Mordaunt,
and I'm sorry to say not on one of my ships. But my ships sail on
Fridays, so it couldn't be helped. I'm going to tell you that your
letter put you up a peg or two in my esteem." A sudden smile made
his face very pleasant and friendly. "This is your last night in
England, so you will have letters to write. I am to talk with these
gentlemen"&mdash;he waved a hand towards Ricardo and
Hanaud&mdash;"so I'll say good night and good luck."</p>

<p>He shook hands with Mordaunt, but for a few seconds did not
move. Then he said "Yes," and took a step or two towards the door;
and again he said "Yes," adding, as once more he moved on, "If
there's anything we can do for you, write to me," and this time he
reached the door. But there he turned, having made up his mind. He
came straight back into the middle of the room challenging them all
to blame him if they dared. "Meanwhile, Mordaunt, you might perhaps
do something for me."</p>

<p>His voice was now firm but gentle, and Ricardo wondered
afterwards whether something of the pity which he had felt and
imposed upon his audience for that young victim of a nation's
revolt was still working within him.</p>

<p>"My youngest daughter&mdash;Rosalind. She was lovely to look at.
She said she was stifled in this house. I didn't understand that.
She married against my will. Leete, the name was. She may be still
where you are going. I think the marriage has turned out ill. God
knows, I take no pride in that! So, if you meet her, will you tell
her that her place is here&mdash;and empty."</p>

<p>So it was not pity which had moved him, not even compunction,
Mr. Ricardo thought, but just the patriarch's feeling that, owing
to the wrong-headed folly of one of the family, there was an
uncomfortable gap which should be closed.</p>

<p>"Of course I will, sir," said Mordaunt, and at once voices broke
out in a babble. The only words Ricardo distinguished were spoken
by George Crottle enthusiastically: "It would be fine to have Rosie
back again."</p>

<p>Septimus turned with an apology to his two new guests, and he
included in his smile Mr. Alan Preedy. "But these are family
matters. You have something to say to me, Monsieur Hanaud. Will you
and your friend come along with me to the smoking-room? George, and
James too, perhaps, since in so much they take my place. To
everyone else, good night."</p>

<p>He led the four men to a room along the corridor behind the
drawing-room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"><small>CHAPTER 16</small></a><br>
<br>
HANAUD SMOKES A CIGAR&mdash;OR DOES HE?</h2>

<p class="first">It always gave Mr. Ricardo a pinch, as it were, of
malicious pleasure to see Hanaud's discomfort when he drank a
whisky and soda; and a still stronger and more satisfactory pinch
to watch his inability to cope with a big cigar. Hanaud would so
much sooner have smoked one of his own black abominations. Thus Mr.
Ricardo's spirit, which had been undoubtedly depressed by the
reading in the drawing-room, rose with a bound when Septimus,
standing by a tray which held bottles of soda-water and a black,
pot-bellied bottle of whisky, invited his guests to drink.</p>

<p>"A whisky and soda, Monsieur Hanaud?"</p>

<p>"What would be an English evening without it?" Hanaud returned
with a flourish. He took a tumbler from the tray and held it out to
Septimus. But, even so, there was a twisting of his nostrils as the
smell of the liquor reached them, and a gentle writhing of his
features, as he realised that he must actually drink it, which was
reminiscent of the Christian martyrs. Worse, how ever, was to come.
As Hanaud stood with the tumbler in one hand and the other fumbling
in his pocket for a cigarette, Septimus produced a large box of
cigars from a cabinet.</p>

<p>"But that is a big box, Monsieur Crottle!"</p>

<p>"They are big, big cigars," Ricardo replied gleefully.</p>

<p>"They look wonderful," said Monsieur Hanaud. He stared
doubtfully into the box, advancing and withdrawing a hand; rather,
Ricardo thought, like a young lady in the days of his youth on the
steps of a bathing machine dipping her toes into the water on some
bleak summer morning.</p>

<p>"They're the best," Septimus explained. "They are mine."</p>

<p>Hanaud quivered as he took a cigar of a length associated with
one English aristocrat and two English statesmen.</p>

<p>"You'll spoil me," he said, holding up a warning finger to
Septimus; and, indeed, Mr. Ricardo fancied that that might really
happen before Hanaud had reached the end of his cigar. However,
diplomacy meant doing a good many repugnant things with an air of
extreme pleasure, for the sake of establishing a position, didn't
it?</p>

<p>"Have a light," said Septimus, and he struck a big wooden match.
"You wouldn't, I am sure, insult that cigar with a briquet."</p>

<p>"I would not, indeed," cried Hanaud, hastily withdrawing his
hand from his pocket. He carried his cigar and his tumbler to a
chair which really was easy and settled himself into it with
deliberation. He was marking time. Certainly there was a little
noise outside the room for which, indeed, Hanaud was to blame. He
had been the last of the five to enter the smoking-room and he had
not latched the door. The front door closed once, gently, as Alan
Preedy, quiet, as gentlemen of the law should be, departed. Then
followed a rustle of skirts and a couple of high-pitched voices on
the stairs. The ladies were going to bed&mdash;or two of them, at
all events.</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur Hanaud, in what way can I help you?" said
Septimus, upright in a straight-backed chair.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you frankly," Hanaud replied, and he felt in his
pockets. He looked at Ricardo. "You can oblige me. I left, or I
think I left, a little diary in a topcoat in the hall."</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you," Ricardo answered readily. He had, in
truth, not needed the quick glance which Hanaud had thrown at him.
He was really wanted now!</p>

<p>"It's the grey coat," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"I remember," said Ricardo.</p>

<p>He didn't remember at all, but he went out of the room. In front
of him stretched the long corridor to the inner of the two hall
doors, empty&mdash;but not quite silent. A strange sound made
itself faintly heard as he listened. What it was that Hanaud wanted
of him, he could not imagine. All the more reason, therefore, to
miss nothing, however infinitesimal. The strange sound was rather
like the bleating of a sheep. And it came from the drawing-room
just in front of the smoking-room, through the open door. And the
room was still lit, although the girls, as Septimus had called
them, had gone up to bed.</p>

<p>But Ricardo had only heard two voices. Was the third bleating in
the drawing-room, and which of the three would it be? He advanced
stealthily, noiselessly. He, Julius Ricardo, of Grosvenor Square,
was primitive man-trapper, Redskin with the
scalping-knife&mdash;Mr. Ricardo loved the picture&mdash;or perhaps
not primitive man at all, but the man of to-day, acute, erudite,
the sleuth&mdash;Mr. Ricardo liked the picture still more. He held
his breath, he moved on tiptoe&mdash;and stopped. From the spot
where he stood he stared through the doorway into a long oblong
mirror against the drawing-room wall. He saw reflected in it the
gimcrack table with the gilt handles, and the drawer once more open
and, in front of it, seated in the chair which she had used during
the reading, Agatha. But not the Agatha of the reading. This was a
woman stricken. She sat with her hands to her face, shuddering. At
times the shuddering mounted to a sob of horror and so stopped
altogether. But it began again, and again so ended. Ricardo noticed
that there lay upon her lap a card which had been torn across in
two pieces; and even from where he stood he could see that there
was writing on the card.</p>

<p>As he watched, he was aware of a change in her. Instead of the
horror there was now uneasiness. She moved her shoulders, the hands
fluttered upon her face; and he was warned. People who do not know
that they are watched, sometimes by some instinct suspect it. He
himself was the cause of her uneasiness. He stooped low. He had
time to see her snatch her hands from her face, stare with a
violent shiver at the torn pieces of the card, and then drop them
into a wastepaper basket by the side of the cabinet. The carpet was
thick and he made no noise. He stood straight up now, pulling down
his coat. He said in a voice no louder than was natural: "The grey
topcoat? All right."</p>

<p>He walked forward past the door of the drawing-room, humming a
little tune to himself. He was extremely careful not to direct one
glance into the lighted room; and as he reached the contraption by
the hall door, with its hat-and-coat-rack and its tin trough for
umbrellas, he so rattled it that only the most obsessed people in
the world could have been unaware that he was pretending with every
artifice that he was not pretending. However, it was one of the
most obsessed people whom he had to deceive; and whilst he was
fumbling in the empty pockets of a coat, he heard a click as a
light was switched off, and a moment later the hiss and rustle of a
dress upon the stairs.</p>

<p>"There's nothing," Mr. Ricardo was saying aloud. Really, he was
playing his part admirably. "I can't understand it." He heard a
door shut upstairs. Then he stopped at once his untheatrical piece
of theatre. But he waited, listening for that door perhaps to open
again; it did not. Now he hurried back along the corridor. He
slipped into the dark drawing-room. Enough light crept in from the
hall to define the plan of the room. But he must not stumble over
furniture and he must be quick. He slid between the chairs to the
wastepaper basket. A great fear was troubling him that the basket
might be full with the litter of the day. But his fingers assured
him that, except for two small pieces of pasteboard, the basket was
empty. He snatched those pieces up. Above his head he heard a
woman's heels tapping. He slipped out and returned to the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>"I can't find it," he said. "I am very sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hanaud, disappointed. "Well, I've no doubt that I can
remember all that's necessary," he added encouragingly, and
Ricardo, with confidence, shut the door.</p>

<p>Hanaud was leaning forward to speak, when Septimus said: "You
have let your cigar go out, Monsieur Hanaud."</p>

<p>"And if you think that's a good beginning, my friend, you are
wrong," Ricardo commented silently.</p>

<p>Even Hanaud realised his fault. "I have, indeed. It is not to be
pardoned. But with a wooden match, I light him again. So."</p>

<p>"Now blow once."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud blew.</p>

<p>"Now you can smoke it."</p>

<p>Hanaud drew in a breath. "It is delicious," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Septimus.</p>

<p>"But I waste the time. There was a man of whom, Monsieur
Crottle, you will only have heard. Daniel Horbury."</p>

<p>From neither James nor George was there a start nor any
movement.</p>

<p>"He committed suicide," said Septimus.</p>

<p>"So it is said."</p>

<p>"An inquest will be held on Tuesday."</p>

<p>"And that same verdict will probably be given."</p>

<p>"But you don't believe it, Monsieur Hanaud?"</p>

<p>There was no shrugging of the shoulders now in Monsieur Hanaud,
no flourishing of arms. "I don't believe it, Monsieur Crottle."</p>

<p>"And whether it was suicide or murder&mdash;I take murder to be
the only alternative&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Crottle paused, but his eyes met only a face of wood, and he
resumed: "How am I concerned?"</p>

<p>"He wrote a letter to you, sir."</p>

<p>The sentence was thrown quickly at Septimus&mdash;a grenade to
produce an explosion. All it produced was a smile of amusement on
Crottle's old pippin of a face.</p>

<p>"They all do."</p>

<p>Hanaud was clearly puzzled. "They?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Horbury and men like him," Septimus repeated.</p>

<p>"What is it, then, they want?"</p>

<p>"A passage on the Dagger Line, Monsieur Hanaud, to the land of
their dreams&mdash;a land where there are no extradition
treaties."</p>

<p>"But there were enclosures in the letter."</p>

<p>"There would be. Passages must be paid for."</p>

<p>"And he didn't send the letter at once. He kept it by him."</p>

<p>"That, also, they all do&mdash;for Mr. Micawber's immortal
reason."</p>

<p>"Something turning up," Mr. Ricardo interpreted.</p>

<p>Hanaud was disappointed. He refused to accept the obvious and
practical conclusions of Septimus Crottle.</p>

<p>"But Monsieur Crottle, you will pardon me. Horbury was not in
distress. In fact "&mdash;if it came to idiomatic phrases, Hanaud
could hold his own&mdash;"in fact," he exclaimed triumphantly, "he
was upsidaisy."</p>

<p>"Financially?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We have the evidence, eh, my friend," and he turned to
Ricardo. "Horbury's nosebag."</p>

<p>"But was he upsidaisy with the police, Monsieur Hanaud?"
Septimus answered with his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>Hanaud, however, was ready for him there. "The Superintendent
Maltby had no intention to arrest him."</p>

<p>Septimus Crottle smiled. "It might be that the Superintendent
Maltby didn't explain, even to you, Monsieur Hanaud, all that he
had in his mind. I am afraid that, after all, you have found a
mare's nest."</p>

<p>"And I, no doubt, am the foal," Hanaud returned quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was in the mood to applaud the witticism, even
though it was founded on a mispronunciation. He did not like to see
his friend so put down. Even Septimus began to laugh, but corrected
himself immediately. Instead of a congratulation, he implied a
censure. He said: "You have again let your cigar go out."</p>

<p>"It is the excitement," returned Hanaud. He rose, and young
George Crottle was in front of him with a match-box in his hand.
For a moment Hanaud stared at him as if he had forgotten his
presence. Then he looked from him to James. Then he said: "Oh, yes,
Mr. George Crottle! Mr. James Crottle! You agree, of course, with
your uncle?"</p>

<p>The question, though out of keeping no doubt with the times, was
quite appropriate to this particular uncle and nephews, so
masterful the one, so debonair or amenable the others.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say old Horbury wrote the letter," replied the
debonair George, "and put it away on the chance that he might some
time want it in a hurry. There it was."</p>

<p>"But there it isn't," replied Hanaud.</p>

<p>"It has disappeared?" asked James. He looked quickly at his
uncle.</p>

<p>"Without trace. We have searched the office, Horbury's desk, his
blotting-pad, and his house."</p>

<p>"'White Barn?" said James Crottle.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Hanaud, and Septimus appeared surprised.</p>

<p>"You know the house?" he asked of his nephew.</p>

<p>"The name was in the evening papers," George explained.</p>

<p>"There is no reason that I can see "&mdash;and Hanaud, who had
started smoothly, now halted and pronounced slowly each word, as if
he had just begun to see&mdash;"why Horbury should have taken the
letter to White Barn. But he may have done."</p>

<p>"However, it wasn't there, and, mind you, we looked everywhere,
Maltby and I."</p>

<p>"In the blotting-book?" James asked.</p>

<p>"The one on the floor?" said Hanaud, and George Crottle chuckled
loudly.</p>

<p>"I've heard that Horbury did a good deal of his business over a
bottle, or bottles, of Pommery, but I never thought that he
couldn't stand up to it and had to keep his blotting-book on the
floor."</p>

<p>A little long-winded Mr Ricardo thought. Rather silly, too.
George Crottle, with all his good fellowship, might become a
rattle, when a gaffe had been made, to cover up the man who had
made it. But the rally of dialogue was swift enough to cover more
than a gaffe. Moreover, Hanaud chose that moment to close a subject
which had become interesting to Ricardo. He flung himself away from
George Crottle and the big offending box of Bryant and May.</p>

<p>"In a moment I ask for the match, Monsieur George, the splutter,
the flame. Yes, I shall ask for them," and with a laugh he
challenged George to contradict him. "But at the moment "&mdash;he
turned, still smiling, to Septimus&mdash;"it is to you, Mr.
Crottle, that I would like to tell all, if you will have the
patience to listen to me."</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Septimus.</p>

<p>"I have little concern in this affair," and Hanaud explained the
case of Devisher and Gravot of the Place Vendôme. "That is all
settled. I shall carry back from the widow Horbury in notes of the
Bank of England the money owed to him. But I went with
Maltby"&mdash;and he described with a quiet force what he had seen
and what he had inferred; the sudden determination of the Horburys
to spend the night at the house in Lordship Lane, the manner of
Olivia Horbury itself&mdash;"to read what people say is one thing,
to hear them saying it is very much another"&mdash;the locked door,
the telephone receiver lifted and replaced in the dark of the
morning, the absence of all the natural fingerprints on the
furniture, the want of any reason why suicide should have been
committed, the disappearance of Devisher. "Yes, and something more,
the disappearance of a little chart, fixed on an ebony board."</p>

<p>"Chart?" exclaimed Septimus, sitting forward.</p>

<p>"Chart?" George Crottle echoed.</p>

<p>"Chart?" James Crottle repeated.</p>

<p>They were men of the sea, the three of them. Charts were part of
their business. There were rolls of charts in the cupboards of the
offices of the Dagger Line. It was inevitable that the Crottles
should sit up and wonder what in the world Daniel Horbury was doing
with a chart.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was marked, too, with pins, little black glass pins,
with a white ensign on the top, such as you may buy at a toyshop.
They seemed to mark the passage of a steamship&mdash;El Rey, which
brought Devisher home."</p>

<p>"And the chart has disappeared?" Septimus asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hanaud, "with the letter."</p>

<p>"Burnt, no doubt," George returned.</p>

<p>"Cartridge paper," said Septimus with a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"And the ebony board, too? Yes, it is possible. There was a
small fire at White Barn. But why should Horbury be so anxious to
burn so carefully that not splinter of the wood nor an edge of the
cartridge paper should be left for us to find? And after so much
trouble to stretch his chart flat and prick it day by day? It
doesn't sound reasonable."</p>

<p>Septimus Crottle nodded his head.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't. But this man, Devisher? He was rescued by
Mordaunt's yacht. He left Kingswear by the Torbay Express
"&mdash;once more Septimus went over the old ground. "Devisher is
the man to look for."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Hanaud. "Yes, no doubt, and Maltby is looking
for him."</p>

<p>Septimus Crottle was watching Hanaud's face closely. "But he has
disappeared?"</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head. "Yes. Like Horbury's letter to you, the
marked chart: and the ebony board."</p>

<p>"With them, perhaps," suggested George Crottle, and Hanaud swung
swiftly round to him.</p>

<p>"Then Devisher was at White Barn on Thursday night," returned
Hanaud, and George Crottle's face flamed red. He began to make in a
kind of hurry some faltering suggestions which seemed superlatively
foolish to Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Then he will have taken the letter."</p>

<p>"From the blotting-book on the floor," Hanaud interposed with a
grin.</p>

<p>"And the chart," James Crottle added without remarking upon the
interposition, "and gone off according to his plan."</p>

<p>Hanaud broke in again, shaking his head as if thus he shook all
the plans away into the air.</p>

<p>"How can he have made plans, Mr. James? He arrived in London by
the Torbay Express. He had no luggage, no friends, a borrowed suit
of clothes, and ten or eleven pounds, and he had been at least six
years away, buried in a foreign prison. Yet, within a few hours, he
has made such fine plans that he can commit a murder in Lordship
Lane and make a vanishing that all the police in London cannot
explain."</p>

<p>Septimus Crottle was as interested now as if some baffling crime
had been committed on a ship under his command.</p>

<p>"But he has disappeared, Monsieur Hanaud! That's the fact, the
impossible fact which is always happening."</p>

<p>"I do not lose sight of him. It is one of the facts which make
me think he did not murder on Thursday night. I think that somehow
he fitted in with other plans&mdash;maybe Horbury's, if, indeed,
Horbury did the slitting, maybe some unknown murderer's." He turned
with confidence to Ricardo. "My very good friend and
consultationist "&mdash;Ricardo shivered a little at the coinage of
that new and, alas! adoptable word&mdash;"Ricardo was for some
hours on Mordaunt's boat with Devisher. Tell us what you thought of
Bryan Devisher, Mr. Julius."</p>

<p>Among the innumerable irritations which vexed the even flow of
Mr. Ricardo's spirit, perhaps none hurt so much as liberties taken
with his name. To be "Mr. Julius" was to be a younger son addressed
by a superior being&mdash;like a butler, say. He was being bidden
to speak up and tell his little story. On the other hand, his good
name as a man of observation was at stake, and that was more
important than irritation. Mr. Ricardo spoke up.</p>

<p>"He did not seem to be revengeful. He was hard, yes. But six
years in the island dungeon had killed I think, the spirit in him.
To lie soft and easy was the idea, and he saw a way of realising
it, so long as he could get away from the steamer El Rey without
reporters, and the police checking up on him. No, I agree with
Hanaud, I doubt if he was the man to commit a murder."</p>

<p>"So the murderer escapes," said George Crottle with a smile of
sympathy. "I am afraid we all prefer a laugh at the police to the
capture of a criminal."</p>

<p>Hanaud took up the statement very good-humouredly. He laughed
with George Crottle.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, that is so. But why do we prefer a laugh at
the police? Because, in our heart and soul, we know that the
criminal will not escape, after all."</p>

<p>"He will do it again, you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean more. The little offences, if they escape, at once there
is some bad example and some harm is done. That is all. But the big
crimes like murder, they may not escape. Once or twice, in the blue
of the moon, there may be a nobility and it never fails to be
recognised. Oh, never! But, as a rule, Monsieur George, accept the
creed of an old tracker, the two remarkable characteristics of the
big crime are its meanness and its cruelty."</p>

<p>Septimus Crottle was undoubtedly interested. He nodded his head,
sitting upright in his high-backed chair.</p>

<p>James Crottle said with a trifle of cynicism: "It would need a
bold man to hold out against you and Mr. Ricardo."</p>

<p>"I hope that one day, Monsieur Hanaud," Septimus added, "you
will come on some other than a Sunday evening and tell me in detail
a few of your cases."</p>

<p>"I hope," cried Hanaud, "that I may give you some day the whole
story of the night at White Barn in the Lordship Lane."</p>

<p>As this was spoken, it took on a more important meaning,
certainly in Hanaud's ears, no less certainly in Mr. Ricardo's.
Hanaud glanced slyly at George Crottle and James.</p>

<p>"It may be, after all, that I make a mistake. Once I made one.
In this case, however, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Although the coroner's jury will say suicide?" James Crottle
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But in that case it is over."</p>

<p>"No. You see, Mr. James, Maltby is not satisfied."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>The exclamation came from Septimus. What this flibbertigibbet of
a Frenchman, who hadn't the stomach to let him smoke a Romeo and
Juliet Corona cigar, thought, was one thing&mdash;of the mere
weight of a cigarette, say. What the Superintendent Maltby, of the
tenacious, deliberate mind, thought, was quite another&mdash;of the
weight of a Romeo and Juliet Corona cigar, in fact.</p>

<p>"Therefore, if the letter from the late Horbury were to reach
you," Hanaud continued, as he rose from his chair, "it might,
perhaps, help to send it on to Maltby."</p>

<p>"I will do so," said Septimus, accompanying his two guests to
the front door.</p>

<p>Hanaud drove home uncomfortably by Ricardo's side in the
Rolls-Royce No. 1, which had that evening arrived by way of
Cherbourg. He had many postures, but no words, and experience had
made Mr. Ricardo too wary to provoke them.</p>

<br>
THE TORN CARD</h2>

<p class="first">Once the two friends were seated in the study of
the corner house, Hanaud had to speak.</p>

<p>"A peppermint frappé?" he asked, and added, rather proud of what
he thought to be a humorous phrase, "Can do?"</p>

<p>"I should think nothing is more unlikely," Ricardo returned as
he rang the bell. "Thompson, could yon manage a peppermint frappé
at this hour?"</p>

<p>Thompson came as near to a smile as his code of manners
permitted.</p>

<p>"Monsieur asked for one once some years ago and caught us at a
disadvantage. A few moments, monsieur."</p>

<p>So Hanaud sipped his peppermint frappé and smoked his black
cigarettes, whilst Ricardo reflected on the oddities of
friendship.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hanaud smiled: "You shall tell me what you saw when you
were kind enough to search for the diary I had not left in my
topcoat."</p>

<p>Ricardo made a grimace. "It was not pleasant."</p>

<p>"The Miss Agatha, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ricardo described her shuddering in horror with the broken
drawer open at her side and the torn pieces of a card upon her
lap.</p>

<p>"She swept them into the wastepaper basket," he continued, "and
after I was in the hall she turned out the lights and went up to
bed."</p>

<p>"Dropped them&mdash;just like that&mdash;in the wastepaper
basket?" Hanaud mused, "and turned out the lights."</p>

<p>"But that didn't baffle me," cried Mr. Ricardo triumphantly. "I
knew Miss Agatha might perhaps hear the snap of the switch if I
turned the lights on, so I didn't touch it. I knew she might wonder
if a chair or a table were overturned, so I slipped like an eel
between them;" and Mr. Ricardo, to make this piece of sleuthing as
admirable and vivid to Hanaud as it was to himself, twisted and
slid towards the table; and undoubtedly Hanaud did
admire&mdash;little cries of admiration broke from him. He had
hands raised ready to applaud. Mr. Ricardo loved that moment, and
to complete the movement with a most dramatic finish, he plunged
his hand into his trouser pocket and flung the two pieces of
pasteboard below Hanaud's eyes upon the table.</p>

<p>Well, where were the words of praise? Or, if not of praise, of
thanks, for a most difficult example of the detective's art? Mr.
Ricardo opened his eyes. He had closed them as he had flung the
pasteboard fragments&mdash;and he saw Hanaud staring at those
fragments in consternation.</p>

<p>"You picked them out of the tub?" he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Of course. Wasn't I right?"</p>

<p>"No, my friend."</p>

<p>"But there was a word written on the card."</p>

<p>"I read it when Septimus jerked open the drawer."</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I did wrong," said Mr. Ricardo tartly. Hanaud was
swift to reassure his friend. It was not that Mr. Ricardo had done
wrong. No, no! On the contrary! He had done too much right. Miss
Agatha's agitations, they were suggestive, and described with a
particularity only to be found in a master&mdash;and with an
economy, too&mdash;it is so rare to use few words when many would
do. It did not really matter so much that he had removed the two
pieces of card.</p>

<p>"In any case the servants would have emptied them into the
dustbin in the morning," said Ricardo, once more smiling.</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>The contradiction came like a slap in the face.</p>

<p>"Why no, no?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Hanaud sweetly, "at this moment, perhaps, or
perhaps in an hour or in two hours, Agatha will wake uneasy. And in
a little while she will understand why she is uneasy. That torn
card&mdash;it should be burnt. She will creep down in the dark,
with a torch, perhaps&mdash;and the pieces&mdash;they have gone!
Oh, in the long run it does not matter. Very likely she will,
think, 'Oh, it is that inquisitive one from France, he was at the
elbow of Septimus,' and she will be more discreet. But..."</p>

<p>"But what?" Mr Ricardo demanded impatiently</p>

<p>Hanaud finished his peppermint and stubbed out his cigarette. "I
should not be quick to destroy those two pieces of card," he
replied slowly. "It is for you, of course, to say... For me, I wait
upon the exquisite Madame Horbury to-morrow morning and in the
afternoon I return to Paris. But, my friend, if I were you, I
should lock them up. One never knows."</p>

<p>He stood up and, with a complete change of tone, added: "We go
to bed, no, yes? We will not lose the sleep? We meet at the
luncheon, when I say to you farewell. What I owe to you!" and
Hanaud betook himself upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo took the ashtray on which Hanaud's cigarette still
smouldered and emptied it into the fire-place. As he replaced it on
the table, he saw the torn pieces of the card; and it flashed
across his thoughts that he had never read the word written across
them.</p>

<p>He fitted them together. It was a word, of course, but it was
more&mdash;a name. And as Mr. Ricardo read the name he was seized
with a discomfort, the same sort of discomfort as had seized upon
Hanaud in the motor car. Fear, in other words. The fear a man might
have as he looked down into a pit. For the name written upon the
card was&mdash;Horbury&mdash;with an initial in front of
it&mdash;D&mdash;yes, of course, D. Mr. Ricardo was half inclined
to let those two pieces of card follow the cigarette ash into the
fire. But in his mind's eye he saw Hanaud's face again, serious and
alarmed. He locked the pieces safely in a drawer of his private
desk.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"><small>CHAPTER 18</small></a><br>
<br>
THE HOLLY HEDGE</h2>

<p class="first">The flat on the first floor of Audley Court had
neither the elegance of White Barn nor the opulent glitter of
Horbury's office. It was not furnished to a period. A Sheraton
writing-table stood side by side with a marqueterie cabinet.
Comfort was the note of it, and quiet colours, restful to tired
eyes. Hanaud's first thought, indeed, as he moved into the
sitting-room and across to the window and looked over the tree tops
of the avenue to the wide grassland of the park, was that here was
a refuge for a far-thinking statesman rather than for a
double-dealer in the equities.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Horbury will be here immediately," said the butler with a
bow.</p>

<p>Hanaud beheld his broad shoulders and his lean strength with
contentment and, as the man turned away, he said firmly: "'Arf a
mo'!"</p>

<p>The butler, used to all conditions of men, turned about stolidly
and waited.</p>

<p>"You've been a sailor," said the perspicacious visitor. The
butler complimented Hanaud with as much of a smile as he allowed
himself on duty.</p>

<p>"Admirals at sea and generals on land wouldn't agree about that,
sir. But name of Hanworth to both."</p>

<p>Hanaud was puzzled and then especially pleased.</p>

<p>"I have him. A marine."</p>

<p>Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"We have them, too. Les Fusiliers-Marins&mdash;yes? They are
much thought of and they think much of themselves. Good! Then you
stay here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, whether Mrs. Horbury will require me."</p>

<p>"But if she does&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Her service is a pleasure, sir," Hanworth replied. A little
sententious, no doubt&mdash;the super-marine on duty&mdash;but,
however you looked at it, good marks for Olivia Horbury.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Hanaud to himself as Hanworth left the room; and
"Ha!" he said to himself again, drumming on the window-pane
contentedly; and a quiet voice with a tremor of amusement broke in
upon his contentment.</p>

<p>"The name was Gravot, I think, Monsieur Hanaud?" He swung round.
Olivia Horbury was seated at a table under the second of the two
windows.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, you make the heart beat," he said.</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Monsieur Hanaud."</p>

<p>"Yes, that way, too. But at the moment it is the noiselessness."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hanaud, do you wish me to believe that you belong to
the day when women's gowns whispered and their bangles rattled and
all the birds in the garden piped 'she is here, she is here'?"</p>

<p>"I try, madame, to be of my day and the Code Napoleon&mdash;" He
broke off, noticing that she sat with an open cheque book in front
of her.</p>

<p>"No, please, that is not possible now. I had hoped to return to
Paris with one like that. But now there must be lawyers and
hindrances." He pointed to the cheque book. "Instead, perhaps, a
little signed letter on the crested paper that as soon as the
probations are over a cheque will be posted."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur Hanaud, that's what I was doing." She put a
slender forefinger on the twopenny stamp. "Perhaps you don't know
that that was Daniel's crest."</p>

<p>She smiled as she spoke and Hanaud laughed, and Olivia laughed
again.</p>

<p>"What a woman!" Hanaud exclaimed to his soul. "She can make the
joke about the good Horbury's honesty, but none the less yesterday
she was in tears for him." Indeed, as he watched her writing the
cheque, her laughter dwindled to a whimper and the tears once more
filled her eyes.</p>

<p>She scribbled a note, put it into an envelope with the cheque,
sealed it, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"I have drawn the cheque on my private account. The branch of
the bank I deal with is on the ground floor of the next block of
flats. I have already arranged with the manager. Hanworth will
bring you back a draft upon the Paris branch." She sent Hanworth
off with the sealed envelope. "He will not be five minutes."</p>

<p>Hanaud felt a trifle uncomfortable. After all, it was a large
sum of money.</p>

<p>"It may be months before the estate is finally wound up," he
said.</p>

<p>"A year, monsieur. And since there is no reason that Monsieur
Gravot of the Place Vendôme, who has waited so long for his money,
should wait for another year, you shall take it back to him." She
got up with a swift movement and invited him to a chair. "I don't
want you, Monsieur Hanaud, to misunderstand me. Daniel and I were
the very best of friends. Lots of people, no doubt, will give you
quite another picture of him, and theirs may be true from their
points of view; I'll go further, and say it is. For me it was all
different."</p>

<p>There was a suggestion in her tone that he could have her story
if he wished; and at that moment there was nothing Hanaud wished
more. A younger daughter of an impoverished family, she had been
carefully educated so that she might earn her living as a teacher
in a high school.</p>

<p>"I was almost learned in those days," and she spoke of them as
so remote that they were difficult and, astonishing to remember.
"But it wasn't any good, for I couldn't teach. I could chatter, but
I couldn't instruct. I could get enjoyment myself out of Virgil,
say&mdash;oh, yes, you needn't look so surprised, Monsieur Hanaud,
it's not, as you might say, a politeness&mdash;but I couldn't
impart it. So I thought that I would go on the stage."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olivia, taking up his exclamation relentlessly. "You
think Daniel might have noticed me in the back row of the chorus,
but could hardly have had the entrée into a high school."</p>

<p>That is exactly what Hanaud had thought, but, having once been
chided for his manners, he did not propose to fail again.</p>

<p>"No, no, Madame Horbury," he cried. "It was that I saw you
myself upon the boards&mdash;the lady of Scotland coming down the
stairs with the candlestick."</p>

<p>"Yes, and both acting equally well&mdash;no, I am wrong," she
answered, and again her lips curved in good humour and her eyes for
a second danced, "for the candle had a flame and I hadn't. I was no
better on the stage than I was in the high school. But I didn't
believe it, of course. I wanted my opportunity. I was playing small
parts, maids, you know, with the tea-tray&mdash;I suppose that I
didn't look so impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Monsieur Hanaud broke in with a flourish: "Every great lady
must have prayed for such a maid!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better say every great husband?" she replied dryly.
"Anyway, you are quite right. Daniel was dabbling in theatrical
management, and I sat next to him at a supper party. He was full
of&mdash;fun, perhaps, isn't the right word&mdash;jocularity's
better, and very sympathetic. My opportunity would come. Not a
passionate part, no, a static part&mdash;arranging everything for
the passionate ones, without leaving a trace of one's mascara on
one's cheeks. As you see, he knew that I couldn't act.
Yet"&mdash;and there came a tenderness into her voice, whilst
neither her eyes nor her lips lost their humour&mdash;"yet he put
up a play for me."</p>

<p>"Because he hoped that the quiet looks and the quiet part might
draw the town?"</p>

<p>Olivia shook her head gently. "No, because he wanted me to marry
him, and he knew that if I did, without failing in a big part, I
should always feel aggrieved that I had never had my chance."</p>

<p>"The play did fail?"</p>

<p>Olivia Horbury shivered, and half of her shivering, even so long
afterwards, was serious.</p>

<p>"I was scarified. I wanted to put all the dramatic critics into
a bag with a couple of cats and throw it into the Bosphorus. Daniel
filled the house with paper for a month, but that wanted more
canvassing than ever he did to get into Parliament. We got married
immediately afterwards."</p>

<p>That had been six years ago. Olivia had been twenty-two years
old at the time of the marriage, and for the next two years they
had lived at White Barn in Lordship Lane.</p>

<p>"I fell in love with the house as soon as I saw it."</p>

<p>"The holly hedge? It was already there, of course?"</p>

<p>Olivia's face grew soft. Her eyes beamed. "I am glad you
remembered it," she said warmly. "It was there, but it was ragged.
It was like a man who wants his hair cutting. And there were holes
in it. I looked after it myself. Days and days in the autumn I
stood on a ladder and clipped it. We had a gardener to look after
the flowers. But the holly hedge was my job. I let nobody else
touch it. I saw it grow glossy and the holes fill up until it was a
great high evergreen wall." She laughed happily. "Even now I drive
down and spend delightful days looking after it."</p>

<p>"Even now?" Hanaud pressed the question with a smile.</p>

<p>"Even now. Still no one must touch it except me."</p>

<p>She checked her eager speech rather suddenly and turned towards
the window. Once she threw a swift glance towards him and saw that
he was watching her.</p>

<p>"But though we took this flat afterwards, when we had money,"
she resumed quickly, "it was because Dan had to see people. We
wanted to keep White Barn for ourselves. So perhaps, Monsieur
Hanaud, you can understand my willingness to settle the account of
your jeweller in the Place Vendôme. Whenever we were on number
seventeen with the carrées and the transversales and seventeen won,
a good wedge of the winnings was handed over to me. Of course, it
was borrowed again, fairly often at the beginning, but of late Dan
was on seventeen quite often."</p>

<p>Hanworth returned to the flat with the draft upon the Paris
branch of the Bank. Olivia looked it through and handed it to
Hanaud.</p>

<p>"It is correct?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is oke," he returned, as though indeed it were something
more, and taking from his pocket-book a receipt by Gravot et Cie of
the Place Vendôme, he laid it upon her writing-table. Then he bowed
over her hand.</p>

<p>"So," said she, "it is all ended."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He turned and walked towards the door. But he walked ever more
slowly, and when his hand was on the knob of the door he stopped
altogether.</p>

<p>"For my friend, Gravot, yes," he repeated.</p>

<p>"There will be other claimants? Maybe," she asked and answered
behind him.</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of claimants," he replied, and he turned
round towards her rather swiftly and dramatically. It was a
disservice to Hanaud that, although he could keep drama out of his
thoughts, he never could out of his actions; and generally it was
transpontine drama. He saw a young woman without any of the tender
humour which had moved her a few minutes ago, wary and
suspicious.</p>

<p>"Of whom, then?" She was as curt as she was wary.</p>

<p>"I cannot say for sure."</p>

<p>"In other words, you don't know."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Hanaud agreed.</p>

<p>No three words were more repugnant for Hanaud to utter amongst
little people in connection with a small case; and none easier when
he was coping with big problems and intelligent minds. And at all
events Olivia Horbury was&mdash;relieved?&mdash;yes, relieved by
his ignorance. Her face grew less tight, her eyes less wary; she
drew a breath. Hanaud had expected dismissal. He was invited to
continue.</p>

<p>"I do not for one moment think that Horbury used that
blue-handled knife himself," he said, and saw her lips twitch and a
gleam of horror in her eyes as he thus described the weapon. "And
my good friend, the Superintendent Maltby, begins to think with me.
But, see! I am in a special debt to you. Moreover, now you stand
all queenly and prickles, I will say it."</p>

<p>Suddenly the smile for which Hanaud had ceased to hope glimmered
again upon her lips. She sat down in a chair. "You shall," she
said.</p>

<p>"At White Barn, I was moved. There was something I did not
understand, something in all this grim tragedy, pleasant and
disturbing, of which I now have a tiny hold." He was discovering a
Titania permanently in love with Bottom, though of that couple he
had never heard. If Racine had imagined such a pair, Hanaud would
surely have quoted him, for he was well up in Racine. But,
unfortunately, Racine only dealt in the heroes of Troy and the
ghosts of Sophocles, and wit these Horbury and White Barn had no
connection.</p>

<p>"So I will say, I beg you to be careful." He nodded his
head.</p>

<p>"And why, Monsieur Hanaud?"</p>

<p>The question was gently, but firmly put. Olivia was guarding her
secrets. Hanaud hesitated over his answer. But he felt, and felt
strongly, that he could speak more exactly to Olivia than he would
have dared with weaker vessels. He said: "Because there may be
danger for you again."</p>

<p>Olivia did not move, and there was more deliberation than
surprise in her face. "Again?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. There was danger when, in the middle of the night, a
telephone receiver was lifted from its cradle in an empty house and
you locked your door."</p>

<p>Olivia's face grew white as a plaster mask. Even her lips were
bloodless. But in her eyes there was fear. And yet, for Hanaud, not
enough fear. She was keeping her secrets, and Hanaud felt the
danger grow and seep into this room like a miasma and fold about
her till darkness grew between them. Olivia got up from her chair.
If the danger was not to end, talk of it should.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she said and her voice was warm. Hanaud accepted
her decision. But he had a practical word.</p>

<p>"You keep the marine?"</p>

<p>There was urgency in his voice. A fusilier-marin of twenty
years' service with the honourable discharge! To be fostered,
yes.</p>

<p>Olivia's voice broke into an open, joyous laugh. "Of course! If
he will stay and wait upon a lone woman in Lordship Lane."</p>

<p>"You go back there?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the formalities allow."</p>

<p>She waited now for him to give the sign that their interview was
ended and, as he bowed to her, she rang the bell. As she heard the
front door close she said slowly, "I have lost a friend."</p>

<p>But Hanaud was a persistent animal and was not so sure.</p>

<br>
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING "O" AND NOT "D"</h2>

<p class="first">Luncheon was over at the corner house. Hanaud ate
the last of his brandied cherries and, with a sigh of content,
brought forth his cigarettes.</p>

<p>"To-night I shall be in Paris. My vacancy is past. The
cathedrals which I so much wished to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From a café opposite with a striped awning," Mr. Ricardo
interposed with more of regret than sarcasm in his voice. Hanaud
from time to time opened a door upon a different and intriguing
world, and now the door was to close. But more than the closing
door he regretted its tiler[?]. Strict but impish, relentless yet
kind, Hanaud seasoned Mr Ricardo's ineffective days and raised him
at times into high consideration. The corner house would be very
empty after the four o'clock express had steamed out to Folkestone.
Mr. Ricardo foresaw himself suffering a nostalgia for the smell of
the black cigarettes from the blue paper packets and&mdash;he
actually coined a portmanteau word&mdash;the argotistical
flourishes of Hanaud's speech. He felt that, but for Thompson, he
would have tried a peppermint frappé last thing at night. He summed
him up, at all events, in the lingo Hanaud might have used, "He's a
one".</p>

<p>"A cognac with your coffee in the study?" Mr. Ricardo
suggested.</p>

<p>"Superb!" answered Hanaud; and in a few minutes; seated in a
comfortable chair with a Maryland between his lips, his coffee
smoking at his elbow and an ancient goblet of fine glass, worthy of
its little pool of condensed sunlight, in his hand, he was gazing
across the square. His luggage was packed. Thompson would book it
to Paris and find a seat for him on the train. He should have been
at ease, but his shoulders twitched and his eyes were gloomy, and
even when he set the golden pond gently swirling just beneath his
nose, it released no sunlight on his face.</p>

<p>"I do not like things unfinished," he exclaimed "Pictures which
trail away to a corner like the train of a lady's dress, books
which another author completes, crimes which are not
solved&mdash;especially crimes which are not solved because other
crimes come after them."</p>

<p>"Imitation crimes," said Mr Ricardo, and it is deplorable that
he, so fastidious and indeed finicking, should at this moment have
committed the vulgar crime of using a noun when an adjective would
be correct.</p>

<p>"Not only those," Hanaud answered, concerned with facts and
indifferent to grammar. "They are not so difficult. But the crimes
which follow because someone has a glimpse into the crime which is
not explained."</p>

<p>"And you have that glimpse?" Ricardo was startled into
asking.</p>

<p>"I have," Hanaud answered simply as he exhaled a little cloud of
smoke. "Yes, I have him, but not enough of him to paint the rest of
the picture or write the last chapters of the book." He shrugged
his shoulders. "But, after all, he is Maltby's pigeon."</p>

<p>"Then the jeweller of the Place Vendôme must still whistle for
his cheque?" Mr. Ricardo was sorry. When Hanaud failed, he felt
that he lost a few plumes himself.</p>

<p>"No, no." Hanaud pulled his pocket-book from the breast of his
coat and slipped back the band of india-rubber which held it
shut.</p>

<p>"See! An envelope. Inside the envelope a banker's draft on Paris
and a little note for Gravot of Madame Horbury's regrets."</p>

<p>He showed them to Ricardo and replaced the draft in the
envelope, whilst his friend's eyes lingered over Olivia's apology.
"O. Horbury," Mr. Ricardo said as he came to the signature.</p>

<p>"Yes," Hanaud observed with a good deal of significance. "We
have seen that name written before&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>There was a note in Hanaud's voice which puzzled Ricardo. As if
they two had been especially privileged.</p>

<p>"We? You and I? No!"</p>

<p>For answer Hanaud pointed to the drawer in which were locked
away two torn halves of a pasteboard card.</p>

<p>"But 'D. Horbury' was the name written," cried Ricardo. "D for
Daniel." He was straining his eyes, as if he could force the name
to take shape upon the air. "Yes, D for Dan&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got up and, taking his keys from his pocket, opened the
drawer. He brought the two pieces of card to a small table by the
side of his chair and fitted them together.</p>

<p>"D. Horbury," he insisted. "Of course, my dear man! D..." and
his voice weakened.</p>

<p>The name was written in some sort of flurry. The initial was
attached to the name, as if the writer had written it without
lifting the pen from the card; great was the need to write it out
and have done it for good. Suppose that you started to write O,
beginning at the top and following down on the right-hand side and
up on the left, and then made a twirl at the top so that the pen
might run away to the first letter of the surname, H., you might
indeed mistake it for a D, as he himself had done. The more he
looked at the writing, the surer he felt. O for Olivia, not D for
Daniel&mdash;yes, but why?</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was not very alert to whispers from the dark pools
of fear where knowledge ends, but here something which troubled
him, for which he must find, if he could, some quite simple and
comfortable explanation. He had seen Agatha Crottle's face at the
exact moment when the lock was broken and the drawer, with a sound
of splintering wood, burst open. There had been such a look of
terror in her eyes, such a sickly convulsion of her features as he
hoped never to see again. He had slammed a shutter across that
vision in his mind and by no word had reopened it. But it was in
front of him now.</p>

<p>"You saw her that night when she was alone," said Hanaud with a
challenge in his voice.</p>

<p>"I saw her in a mirror. But her hands covered her face. Tears
were falling between her fingers and running down the backs of her
hands. She was in a storm of misery. Why?" Hanaud could explain it.
He had sent him on a pretence just to see and bring back that
story. "You expected that I should see what I did," Ricardo
cried.</p>

<p>Hanaud shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"I was not sure."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was frightening."</p>

<p>And now, as gravely, Hanaud nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the word," he said. "You have heard of people who
hate enough to summon death to help them. They use a sort of
witchcraft."</p>

<p>Hanaud's voice dropped as he spoke, and to Ricardo the room,
even on that day of late summer, had suddenly grown cold.</p>

<p>"They write the name of their enemy on a card, and they lock it
away in a drawer where no one will see it. They make of that drawer
a coffin. And it has been known&mdash;whether by chance or some
dreadful power of evil&mdash;that the victim has fallen sick, has
faded until, in an agony of remorse, the would-be murderer has
unlocked the drawer and torn up the card."</p>

<p>"As she did&mdash;Agatha?" cried Ricardo in a great relief.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Hanaud replied sombrely. "One of the name of Horbury
has died violently. But not the woman. She had never unlocked the
drawer. She did not mean it to be unlocked. Are you sure those
passionate tears were not tears of bitter anger? Isn't it even
possible that she thought that she had killed the man when she had
meant to kill the wife? In that extremity she might have believed
it."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, of course, chose the obvious explanation of the
words. "But you can't mean," he gasped, "that Miss Agatha had set
her heart on that fat rogue Horbury!"</p>

<p>"I don't," Hanaud answered with a grin upon his face in which
there was neither humour nor amusement.</p>

<p>"Upon someone else, then?"</p>

<p>"Obviously," replied Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;oh, I see&mdash;who had set his heart on Olivia
Horbury?"</p>

<p>"So it would seem."</p>

<p>So here was Mr. Ricardo faced with the triangle of the
dramatists. Two women and a man or two men and a woman. It was a
triangle of the first sort in this case. A man pursued by Agatha
who had set his longings on Olivia.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" cried Ricardo.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," Hanaud returned, and the lines of
disappointment deepened on Ricardo's face. After all, what's the
use of a walking Who's Who if it doesn't answer your
questions?&mdash;he asked of himself indignantly.</p>

<p>The Frenchman continued:</p>

<p>"The unknown man. Perhaps my friend, the murderer. There is now
something we did not have before, a reason for murder."</p>

<p>They had Devisher, to be sure, or they would have, if they could
lay their hands upon him. But neither Ricardo, nor Hanaud, nor
indeed Maltby, had any real belief in the guilt of Devisher.
Ricardo was thrown back upon his disinclination to accept the
picture of Agatha Crottle presented to him.</p>

<p>"She is middle-aged. I can't believe she ever had a lover," he
cried. "She is of the kind which finds its consolation in
religion."</p>

<p>And there Hanaud wholly agreed with him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she goes to church, no doubt of it, and prays with
all her soul. But to such, what is the witchcraft of the locked
drawer but a more desperate prayer? She is helping. Oh, I have seen
them, the religious ones, the unconsidered ones, the world's faded,
pitiable wallflowers, when passion comes to them for the first time
in middle-age they can be dangerous."</p>

<p>And so quietly, yet with such significance, did Hanaud let that
word fall from his lips that once more Ricardo gazed into a black
pit with horror in his eyes.</p>

<p>But Thompson, the unfailing, brought the grim conference to an
end. The Rolls Royce (No. 1) was at the door. He himself was now
starting in the second car. A quarter of an hour and they should
follow.</p>

<p>"I shall come with you," said Ricardo, and he stood by the
train's side after Hanaud had taken his seat.</p>

<p>"You will come back, I hope," he said.</p>

<p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It may be," and he suddenly leaned out of the window. "I will
tell you a little thing. Maltby will press at the inquest for an
open verdict. This affair is not ended, my friend."</p>

<p>"And there will be danger before it is ended," Ricardo
declared.</p>

<p>But this danger struck first of all where neither of them
expected it.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"><small>CHAPTER 20</small></a><br>
<br>
MORDAUNT READS A SIGNAL</h2>

<p class="first">It was Mr. Ricardo's way when some high narrative
of fact or fancy was acclaimed, to discover some detail or episode,
which no one else had remarked, and to applaud it to the exclusion
of all other details, and indeed, of the whole pattern. The detail
or episode may have been quite insignificant. That did not matter.
His concentration upon it made strangers wonder for a moment
whether he were not a very deep fellow. And indeed, Mr. Ricardo
enjoyed that pleasant sense of equality with his betters which
comes from travelling first on a second-class ticket. Thus it was
he who noticed what a vastly important part in the explication of
the Horbury Affair was played by the one who had the smallest
concern in it. "Mordaunt," Mr. Ricardo would say, standing on his
hearthrug before the fire and nodding his head sagely like a
mandarin in ivory, "Please don't forget Mordaunt." He should have
added "verb. sap.", and perhaps we might add it for him.</p>

<p>For on the morning when probate of Horbury's will was granted to
his widow&mdash;that is a few weeks after Horbury's
death&mdash;Philip Mordaunt was walking along the street of Nubar
Pasha, in Cairo. It was half-past eleven. The wide platform of
Shepheard's Hotel was as yet sparsely occupied and he passed it
with a distinct pleasure. He had the time but no longer the wish to
explore it. He passed the Esbekiyeh Gardens and crossed the head of
the road leading to the great Bazaar. Later, when the platform
outside Shepheard's was filled and the alleys of the Mouski empty,
he would walk that way, but for the moment he had a happier task.
He continued along the straight broad avenue of Abdul Azziz. Upon
his left hand the great sand cliffs of the Nile Valley were closing
in. Just behind this street the houses were thinning out on the
rising ground. Spaces of brown earth, broken walls, an Arab
cemetery replaced them; and then it came into view&mdash;the
village of Elaoui.</p>

<p>It hung like a cage under the high edge of the cliff, tiny, yet,
in that clear air, distinct&mdash;three sides of a square rather
like Lezardrieux, except in one particular, and an awkward
particular. At Lezardrieux the road from the square down to the
river ran backwards and forwards across the slope in reasonable
gradients, some times invisible under a cliff, sometimes in full
view on a plateau. From Elaoui one road, straight as the blade of a
sword, dropped like a precipice from the outcrop of rock on which
centuries ago the village was built. It dropped for a mile in
length till it joined the desolation of broken walls without which
no eastern city is complete; and throughout that mile not a
building nor a tree cast a shadow across it. Moreover, it was
lighted at night at the top, where it passed between old brick
walls into the village square, and half-way down, and, most
usefully for a keen-eyed watchman in the square, at the bottom
where at last it swerved amongst the ruins and was lost. Mordaunt
could see it, plain as a panel painted white in a wall of pale red.
Not a car, however swift, could ascend that road without
advertising its approach. And it was the only road, as the village
about the square was one house with a hundred tunnels and passages;
for the inhabitants of the village were one close-knit, remote
family. A formidable village under the eaves of the high Mokattam
Hills&mdash;an island with a single causeway, always watched, and
time to spare!</p>

<p>Mordaunt took his first look at the Elaoui village, as he walked
along the street of Abdul Azziz, with as much indifference as he
could counterfeit, and suddenly came to a halt. Straight ahead of
him, the owner of a little bar had set out a few iron tables and
iron chairs on the pavement; and at one of these, facing him, sat a
man he knew. A man whom he had last seen on his yacht in Dartmouth
Harbour, wearing a suit of his clothes and with fifteen pounds of
his money in his pocket. Devisher! Yes, Devisher, but now a
Devisher whose face had begun to fill out, who wore white flannel
trousers and white buckskin shoes and a grey coat and waistcoat
suitable to the season and the place. It perplexed Mordaunt for a
moment that, although they were face to face and the distance with
each step that he took narrowing between them, Devisher did not see
him. Mordaunt laughed, and the laugh brought no look of recognition
to Devisher's face.</p>

<p>"Well," Mordaunt reflected, laughing again at the image of the
dead-and-gone Mordaunt which rose in his mind, "that would have
annoyed me a few months ago. I couldn't have believed that anyone
who had once seen the Mordaunt who was shortly to electrify the
world wouldn't have known him again."</p>

<p>There was a vanity, too, even in that reflection, Mordaunt began
to recognise. But he was too beset by curiosity to continue his
analysis. Devisher did not see him because all the senses that he
had were gathered and blended into one. He was listening as the
blind listen, to hear something far away beyond the hearing of the
men with vision. His eyes, a little down-turned, were empty.</p>

<p>Mordaunt was already abreast of the table, but instead of
passing on he dropped his hand sharply on Devisher's shoulder and
slid into the iron chair opposite. Devisher' reaction to that clap
of the hand was astonishing. With a yelp which was sharp with
terror, Devisher sprang to his feet. He looked around wildly and
brought his eyes down at last to Mordaunt's face.</p>

<p>"You?" he gasped, and then cried sharply: "What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>Philip Mordaunt answered meekly: "Cairo&mdash;early
October&mdash;mayn't I? Or do you already own the town?"</p>

<p>Devisher laughed a little uneasily, but he was bringing his
nerves under control and made a shift to excuse his cry of
fear.</p>

<p>"You might have realised, Captain Mordaunt, that for the
residents of the Castillo del Libertador, the laying on of hands
was a rite seldom associated with pleasure."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Mordaunt answered. "What are you drinking?"</p>

<p>"Beer. Not so bad."</p>

<p>Mordaunt rapped upon the table and two long glasses topped with
snow were set before them.</p>

<p>"Here's luck!" said Devisher as he drank.</p>

<p>"The skin off your nose!" replied Mordaunt.</p>

<p>"I, too, take in the Sunday newspapers," said Devisher, and
Mordaunt produced a cigar case. "Will you?" he asked, holding out
the case.</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Mordaunt pinched the end of one of the cigars and put it between
his lips and felt in his pocket for a box of matches. But the box
was hardly out before he heard a tiny click and a spirit-fed
lighter was burning under his nose.</p>

<p>"Why waste a match? Try this!" cried Devisher with a curious
urgency.</p>

<p>Mordaunt had it on the tip of his tongue to answer that he
preferred a wooden match, but a startling conjecture suddenly
struck him dumb. It wasn't probable; it was hardly tenable at all.
But if it were true? It explained the expectancy and concentration
of Devisher, the eager offer of his cigar lighter, his presence at
this hour, at this bar, in this broad street under the hanging
village of Elaoui. Did it explain, too, Devisher's presence in
Cairo? Mordaunt must discover the answer to that question. It was
not busybody's work. It was his appointed work. But he must
approach it cunningly and he was a novice in the art.</p>

<p>Luckily for Mordaunt, Devisher was not at his ease. He had a
question or two which clamoured for answers.</p>

<p>"You know," he began as he lit a cigarette and put his lighter
back into his pocket, "when I saw you in the cabin of your
yacht&mdash;whether it was something you said or just an impression
that I got&mdash;I thought you had evolved out of your experiences
a sort of complete new pattern to which you were going to fit your
life."</p>

<p>"I had?" asked Philip, apparently as much at sea now as he had
been on his yacht.</p>

<p>"Yes," Devisher added, with just a hint of disdain for the man
who made a plan but couldn't act on it. "And then, a month or so
later, I find you strolling along a street of Cairo, the complete
tourist, a walking poster for Mr. Cook."</p>

<p>Mordaunt's face flushed. The contemptuous good-humour stung him
and he leaned forward sharply to show Mr. Bryan Devisher how wrong
he was. But he showed nothing. A warning bell was beginning to ring
rather urgently in his brain. Devisher's scorn was meant to sting,
and to sting him into admissions, if admissions there were.
Mordaunt lowered his head. He drank his beer silently,
shamefacedly. The rush of blood into his face might as truly have
expressed his shame as his anger.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he confessed. "I had made a plan. I was
going to do wonders. But you know what I did do? "&mdash;and he
uttered a harsh little laugh&mdash;. "I fell asleep in my bath.
That's me, I am afraid."</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, with now and then a jerk of
amusement, and now and then a pull at his beer, and now and then a
puff at his cigar.</p>

<p>"The complete tourist. Not so bad for you, Mr. Devisher, but too
hard a stroke to be pleasant to me. After I had had the nerve too,
one night on the Helford river, to give old Septimus Crottle a full
history&mdash;" Mordaunt broke off suddenly. He had been tilting
his chair on to its back legs. He brought the forelegs down with a
bang upon the stones. "Of course," he cried. "I gave you a letter
to old Septimus, didn't I?"</p>

<p>Devisher was not prepared for that question being flung at him.
He was distracted, too, by the crash of the chair legs upon the
stones. He could listen and talk, but he couldn't listen as he
wished to listen if the talk was to be punctuated by these
exclamation marks.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did."</p>

<p>"And you used it, I hope."</p>

<p>Devisher jumped at the suggestion. It explained at once his
presence in Cairo, his means of livelihood. He would have been
compelled to offer some explanation to the man who had seen him
last in such distressful circumstances. Here was a providential
explanation provided by this simpleton. Devisher smiled and spread
out his hands. "Well, you see. I am here."</p>

<p>"Permanently?"</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"The Dagger Line?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to you."</p>

<p>And Philip Mordaunt began to doubt. Septimus? Was there anything
in the world so dear to that old man's heart as the Dagger Line?
Its prestige, the beauty of its ships, their efficiency and speed?
Mordaunt had written a fair letter to Septimus, concealing nothing
which he knew, not even the deep black ring round Devisher's ankle.
To try such an applicant out in an office under his eye&mdash;yes,
that the old tyrant might do. But to send him at once abroad to a
place so important in the shipping world as the Canal&mdash;that
didn't sound like Septimus at all.</p>

<p>"You're stationed at Port Said, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, here. The Line has an office in Cairo."</p>

<p>Well, that might be so. Mordaunt leaned back in his chair, and
Devisher said with a smile. "It looks as if the old man has taken a
risk. But that isn't the case really. I have merely routine work.
As you saw, probably, I didn't want responsibility. Checking up on
passages, passing the time of day with Cook's and the travel
agents. And I'm not alone in the office. It just suits me, and if
it doesn't run to cocktails at Shepheard's, it does to a decent
glass of beer in the street of Abdul Azziz."</p>

<p>He had hardly finished when a match was struck upon the other
side of the street. Devisher did not turn his head, but he
heard&mdash;Mordaunt was sure of it. There was a quick flicker in
his eye&mdash;Mordaunt classed it with the scratch of the match
upon the emery paper&mdash;and a relaxation of his face. A signal
had been given and taken. Mordaunt, for his part, could look across
the road. He saw a tall youth in an Arab gown standing outside a
cheap provision shop with a cigarette in his mouth which he had
just lighted, and a big box of Bryant &amp; May's matches in his
hand. The young Arab drew at his cigarette to make sure that it was
alight and then, putting the match-box into his pocket, strolled
away.</p>

<p>High up above their heads the village of Elaoui clung under the
rim of the hill. Mordaunt was tempted to draw Devisher's attention
to it and watch confusion trouble his face. But he bethought him of
a better way, which would not betray himself.</p>

<p>Devisher was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock!" he said, and he finished his glass, of beer.
"That will give me just the hour I want before lunch." He looked
around for the waiter and summoned him. "I had a glass before you
came," and as he paid for it, Mordaunt said blandly:</p>

<p>"I'm very glad that we met, and I'm very glad, too, that things
have smoothed themselves out for you. I'll write to old Septimus
to-day and tell him that I've met you and thank him."</p>

<p>Now he saw more than confusion rise in Devisher's face. He saw
fear. He heard a quick gasp.</p>

<p>"I've already done that," exclaimed Devisher.</p>

<p>"But not for me," Mordaunt returned with a laugh. "I wish you
could. I hate letter-writing. But this one I must write
myself."</p>

<p>He watched Devisher hurry away. Septimus and the Dagger Line
could not blend with Elaoui and a young Arab striking a match in
the street of Abdul Azziz. The sooner he wrote to Crottle to thank
him for giving Devisher a chance, the better. That was all that he
need do; and, indeed, he wrote the letter and posted it that
evening.</p>

<p>But it was already too late.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"><small>CHAPTER 21</small></a><br>
<br>
THE HOUSE WITH THE TAMARISKS</h2>

<p class="first">Mordaunt sat for a few minutes longer at his iron
table. The functions of Devisher in Cairo and the unlikely action
of Septimus Crottle were put aside. He rose a little reluctantly
and turned back to the great Bazaar. Midday had emptied its narrow
streets. He stopped once at a small booth and bought a packet of
cigarettes from an old white-bearded Arab in a blue cloak. At a
corner he turned to the north-east and walked into a quarter where
the indifference and quiet of decay followed with an astonishing
abruptness upon the noisy bargainings of the Bazaar. He came to a
silent open space.</p>

<p>Mordaunt had seldom seen anything more desolate. Once, no doubt,
it had been built upon. For it had certainly never been laid out as
a garden or a place of ornament and rest. Here, for instance, a
wall began for no reason, continued for a few yards, and for no
reason ceased. Here a mound of bricks with a floor of bricks spread
like an open fan about it showed where a house had slipped to the
ground. Everywhere the earth was uneven and in colour of a dull
yellow and was withdrawing, it seemed, from sight under a yellow
pall made of its own dust. Were there a flint upon that ground, it
had no facet from which the sun could strike a spark. The whole
place was melancholy and more silent than the desert, as all places
will be where dwellings are relapsing slowly into the shapeless
earth from which they sprang.</p>

<p>As Mordaunt leaned forward he saw on his left hand two trees of
tamarisk which stood within a wall at the path's side. He had begun
to hope that he had missed his way. But his courage sank now. The
house of the tamarisks!</p>

<p>He went forward to it. It was a large house with a gate and,
within the gate, three brick steps led up to the door. Again the
hope that he had been misled encouraged him; so little sign was
there that anyone for many years had made a home of it. But he had
instructions nowadays. He opened the gate, mounted the three steps,
and smartly knocked upon the door with the crook of his stick.</p>

<p>To his surprise, it was opened so quickly that he seemed to have
been awaited. A young woman, indeed she was little more than a
girl, stood in the doorway with a look of eagerness upon her white
face. Never had anyone in Mordaunt's experience appeared so out of
place as this girl in this dusty area of ruin. She was slender,
dressed in a coat and skirt of dark grey, shabby, no doubt, but as
trim and tidy as when it came first from its George Street tailor
in London, and with nothing of Egypt in her dark blue eyes.
Mordaunt had not a doubt that here his walk ended. But there was
obviously no such conviction in the woman in the doorway. There had
been a welcome for someone, but it had faded into bewilderment at
the sight of him; and even that bewilderment had not been able to
master her disappointment. She was very white. The youth of her
face was spoilt by her fatigue and under the broad forehead her
eyes brooded upon him incuriously.</p>

<p>"You have come to the wrong house, I think," she said.</p>

<p>To Mordaunt, this gracious English voice was lovely as music,
however commonplace the words. "I am sure not," he answered. "In a
way, no doubt, I am sorry, but in a way perhaps I am glad." If
Mordaunt had been at pains to replace her distress with a return of
her bewilderment, he could hardly have done better. "You are Mrs.
Leete."</p>

<p>Now, indeed, she was surprised. The white brows drew together
under the swathe of fair hair which crowned her head. "Yes."</p>

<p>In the admission there was a question.</p>

<p>"When I left London, your father, Mr. Septimus Crottle, asked me
to bring you a message."</p>

<p>For a moment her face softened. A smile almost flickered across
her lips, as though she saw Septimus suddenly in his frock coat
with the points of his high white collar cupping his cheeks. All
that she said, however, was again "Yes?" but now in a voice less
hostile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crottle wished you to know that your place was always kept
for you in Portman Square."</p>

<p>Once more the smile almost curved her lips and the ghost of a
smile glimmered in the dark pools of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Next to Agatha's, was it? Do Sunday nights still go on?"</p>

<p>"Rather," Mordaunt exclaimed, commending them.</p>

<p>"Yes, riotous, weren't they?" she answered dryly, and added
thoughtfully: "I ran out&mdash;that was the phrase&mdash;but I may
come back&mdash;to 1870&mdash;if I wish." She remained silent, and
then threw up her head "Wouldn't it have been better for all of
them&mdash;Anne Audrey and Agatha&mdash;if they had run out, too!
"&mdash;and recovering from her outburst, "I should, of course,
very much like to hear all you have to tell me. But to-day&mdash;"
and again distress took her by the throat so that her voice broke.
"If you will give me your address, I'll write to you."</p>

<p>Mordaunt pulled out of his pocket a small diary with loose
leaves. He was saved one awkward moment; it was all the more
welcome since there were many others ahead. He wrote his name and
title on one leaf and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"Yobosci," she began as she read. "That's captain, I think.
Captain Philip Mordaunt&mdash;" and as her eyes ran along the
written words, she stopped abruptly and began again. "The
Coastguard Directorate. I see."</p>

<p>There was no resentment in her voice and no suggestion that
Mordaunt had set a trap for her. "I see," merely meant, "It was
expected." Mordaunt, however, took the words to himself.</p>

<p>"No doubt I should have put my duty first," he stammered.</p>

<p>"We are all recommended to do that," she answered gravely.</p>

<p>"What I said was true," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Rosalind Leete looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"No doubt," she replied.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;your father's message. He did send it."</p>

<p>She looked&mdash;and again with a trifle of amusement&mdash;at
his face, so troubled lest he should be thought guilty of a
despicable subterfuge. "I never thought for a moment that you had
made the message up."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mordaunt fervently, and so began to stammer
again. "As for the other matter"&mdash;no other matter had been
mentioned but neither pretended that it didn't exist&mdash;"as for
this other matter&mdash;it's&mdash;well&mdash;it's different."</p>

<p>"It would be," said Rosalind Leete. Clearly she had to help him
out. "As you pointed out, it's a matter of your duty and it should
have come first."</p>

<p>Mordaunt caught at the word. "Yes."</p>

<p>Rosalind stepped aside in the hall and he crossed the threshold.
She shut the front door and threw open the door of the room which
looked out upon the empty space. Mordaunt walked into a room,
meagrely equipped but clean as soap and a scrubbing brush could
make it. One or two cotton mats were spread upon the bare floor.
The furniture was of painted deal and upholstered in brown plush, a
sofa, an arm-chair and half a dozen straight-backed chairs&mdash;a
suite in fact from a Cairene Bon Marché. But more pitiable than any
sign of poverty was the absence of any of those trifles which,
through their private associations, will make a home out of the
barest lodgings. Septimus had declared that the marriage had
failed. Mordaunt had thought, "There spoke the architect of his
family, angry because a brick had fallen from its place." But
clearly the marriage had failed. There was not a photograph in the
style of ten or fifteen years ago, not some little toy or book
which linked the grievous to-day with a pleasant schoolroom, not
some small picture or statue on which one hangs a dream. Mordaunt's
face was compassionate as he stood in that inhospitable room. He
had a queer vision of the girl setting those small memorials out
when she and her husband came first to live there and removing them
one by one as the shadows darkened upon their lives until the room
became the cold waiting-room of a railway station.</p>

<p>"Now," she said.</p>

<p>"I want to see Professor Leete."</p>

<p>That the title was no longer Leete's by right, Mordaunt knew,
but still to attach it to his name might give her a momentary
comfort. It seemed, however, that she would have no pretences.</p>

<p>"Then you didn't know?" she cried.</p>

<p>But the cry was so wild, the look so amazed, that more must have
happened than the loss of Leete's professorship. Rosalind clapped
her hand suddenly to her mouth to stop the hysteria in which her
voice was rising. But she succeeded. She drew away her hand and let
it fall by her side.</p>

<p>"What else should I know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What you shall know," she answered.</p>

<p>The words were not clipped. There was nothing whatever dramatic
in her gesture. She walked to a door at the side of the room and
opened it.</p>

<p>"He is here," she said.</p>

<p>Mordaunt followed her into a bedroom as mean in its equipment as
the parlour. But it had a dignity which the other room had not. For
in the bed a dead man lay swathed already for the grave. He had the
likeness of a man of middle age, with black hair growing thin and a
face so discoloured and emaciated that it was shocking to see.
Moreover, there was no peace in it.</p>

<p>Mordaunt bent his head towards Rosalind.</p>

<p>"I was abrupt. I am sorry. This&mdash;you were right&mdash;I
didn't know,", and he looked at her full in the face. "Can I help
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she answered quietly.</p>

<p>"It happened&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"This morning at five o'clock."</p>

<p>"You had a doctor?"</p>

<p>"An Egyptian. Dr. Achmed Agami. He has been attending my
husband. He is very kind. You know that here there must be no
delays. He is arranging everything."</p>

<p>There were possibilities of delay, a simple form of embalming,
but no doubt the doctor had explained that. If there were no
friends to escort Leete to his grave, and Mordaunt thought that he
had shaken off all of them except this girl, delay was little to be
desired.</p>

<p>"The actual cause was, I suppose, malaria?"</p>

<p>Rosalind Leete looked at him with surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. How could you tell that?"</p>

<p>For one might have thought that he had starved to death, even
with those wrappings about his throat and neck.</p>

<p>"It ends that way so often," said Mordaunt gently.</p>

<p>And it begins so easily, so pleasantly. Perhaps a reward for a
day's overwork, perhaps idly as an experiment, perhaps, as with the
fellaheen, to gratify a lust. There were a thousand entrances into
that fatal Enchanted Cavern.</p>

<p>"It began in Luxor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the Valley of the Kings," she answered. "He was sent out
with an American Mission. Why it began, I don't know," and for the
second time her voice broke. "I hope that it wasn't my fault."</p>

<p>Mordaunt wondered how much of truth there was in that
self-reproach. It might have been that she had run out to escape
from the sea-discipline of the house in Portman Square rather than
from any love of her professor. Somehow disappointment had
come.</p>

<p>"You went to him straight from your father's house?" Even as he
spoke, he realised the question's impertinence, but she answered at
once.</p>

<p>"We had arranged everything on tiptoes. We were married in St.
Bride's, at the back of Fleet Street, on a Friday morning and left
by the boat-train for Brindisi."</p>

<p>Had he looked for so much more from her than she, with all the
promise of her youth, had to give him? For she must have been
glorious three years ago before poverty and shame had reclothed her
in distress. It was certainly distress rather than grief, distress
and a gnawing sense of guilt, which numbed her now.</p>

<p>Mordaunt could read the history of their marriage easily enough,
once the lure of the drug had caught him. The man's loss of
interest in his most fascinating work, his long absences, the
growing slovenliness of his dress and his looks, the whispers which
became open talk, the loss of discipline amongst the men employed,
the dismissal, the flight to a native quarter in Cairo, the growing
urgency for the drug, the diminishing means to gratify it, more
boracic to less heroin&mdash;until in the end it came to an Arab in
a back room of the Mouski using an hypodermic needle which was
never disinfected. Hence malaria and this polluted skeleton of an
outcast who had once ruled men and held his head high.</p>

<p>Mordaunt turned towards Rosalind Leete.</p>

<p>"You are alone here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is a woman. She is buying food now. She has been very
helpful."</p>

<p>"But she doesn't sleep here?"</p>

<p>Rosalind Leete looked about the room.</p>

<p>"We have nothing worth anybody's while to steal."</p>

<p>Nevertheless this grim morning had been foreseen. It was
properly humbling to Philip Mordaunt to realise that all the high
services which he had begun to watch himself rendering to the
hapless daughter of Septimus Crottle had already been discounted.
Rosalind had sufficient money to pay all that was due, she had
taken, a room in an English boarding-house in the Sharià Abdin. She
had been working in the Museum for Henry Scobell, one of the
greatest of English Egyptologists, owing to a certain skill which
she had acquired in photography and typewriting.</p>

<p>"So you have been the breadwinner in Cairo?" he said.</p>

<p>"He was too ill," she answered, and the noise of wheels broke in
upon her voice.</p>

<p>She looked out of the window as a van stopped before the house
and a sharp movement warned him that here, after all, were friendly
offices which a deputy might take over.</p>

<p>Mordaunt was the only mourner besides herself at the burial in
the English cemetery that afternoon.</p>

<p>"I am grateful," she said as they walked away, "and in a day or
two I should like to talk to you. I shouldn't wonder if I could
help you," she added with a ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the village of Elaoui?" he asked.</p>

<p>She repeated the name. "No."</p>

<p>"Nor of a match struck at a certain hour in a certain
place?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet I think we might help one another, nonetheless," he said as
he left her at her door.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"><small>CHAPTER 22</small></a><br>
<br>
MORDAUNT MAKES A BRILLIANT SUGGESTION</h2>

<p class="first">On a Sunday morning Mordaunt waited anxiously in
the gardens of Gezireh for coming of Rosalind Leete. He would
hardly have admitted anxiety. For he could find no excuse for it in
the help which so far she had given him. A few small tradesmen,
like the little Arab with the white beard and the blue coat from
whom once Mordaunt had bought cigarettes, had been gathered in for
selling slippers of hashish, and a few more important dealers in
carpets for selling the more deadly heroin. But the profits were so
great that there were always others to take the risks.</p>

<p>There was the troublesome business that, although just when at
one time the traffic in drugs seemed to be mastered, it had
broadened out with a violence and fatality too big, it seemed, for
the private trafficker and most difficult to explain. It was
thought&mdash;no, it was believed&mdash;and surely it was more than
believed, it was known&mdash;that a great and bloody-minded nation
which called crime culture and theft civilisation and enslavement
hegemony, had, as a wise policy, set out to corrupt and destroy the
Egyptians by the illicit smuggling of drugs into that country. It
was no longer a case of this or that man, or this or that company,
running hashish or heroin or cocaine into Egypt for profit at the
risk of penal servitude for its officials on the spot. It was a
national policy aiming at a national destruction. It was the curse
of the fellaheen that he would starve rather, than control his
lusts, leave his family to starve and himself, within a few months,
die, an idiot and a pauper. However carefully he had tilled his
land and paid his dues, however many the hours he had given to the
tiny canals and ditches which had watered his fields and secured
some sort of a livelihood for his family and himself, they would
have no memories to restrain him. There were no cords which would
bind him to the mast of his daily work, once the siren music
condensed, within those dark blue paper bags was allowed to swell.
All would go, industry, food, life. Colossal! One of the great
signal posts from which the world's traffic was controlled would
lie open for a great and worthy nation to use it entirely for its
own advantage. A people would have perished&mdash;well, great
nations march to their destiny over roads ballasted by corpses.
That was dutiful!</p>

<p>So the slippers of hashish and the envelopes of thick blue
paper, filled with the sparkling white crystals of heroin were sunk
in waterproof bags off Mersa Matruli, or were carried across Sinai
on the back of camels, and were ferried across the Canal. But a
centre was needed where all this vital fodder could be collected in
safety and distributed with as little danger as was possible. For a
national policy, and so magnificent a policy as the destruction of
another nation by the most corrupt and vicious incitements,
organisation was needed&mdash;good, careful organisation, such as
this high-class, A.1., sedulous nation had always at its command.
It was a short sighted nation, physically, and something of that
short sight had crept into its plans as well as into the eyes which
passed them as perfect.</p>

<p>The centre had been found, the clearing-house, in the village of
Elaoui. Approached by a single road which could be watched night
and day and whence ample warning could be given, that honeycomb of
houses was the best hiding-place near Cairo. It had moreover a most
saintly mosque, dating from the twelfth century, of which one of
the Elaoui family was the priest. That this sacred building did, in
fact, hide those dangerous cargoes, no one of the authorities
concerned could doubt. But the mosque could not be searched.
Another point of junction must be discovered, where the village
under the rim of the hill touched the great city by the river.</p>

<p>And it was discovered after a great deal of patience.</p>

<p>The family of the Elaoui held itself strictly aloof. If a member
of it went down into the city, he made his home there. He was not
an outcast, but he had lost his Place in the home circle. He
remained on terms of friendship with his kinsmen and, when occasion
served, he did business with such as descended to do business with
him. There were a good many of that upland who had married and made
their homes in Cairo and, carrying on tradition, they cultivated a
secret clanship. With the gradual storage of the forbidden drugs in
that unassailable village, the opportunity for mutual service
arrived. As soon as enough had been gathered in those rambling
dwellings and that saintly mosque to soak the town, a youth
strolled down from the village to the street of Abdul Azziz and at
twelve o'clock noon precisely struck a wooden match in front of a
certain provision shop. There was no crime in that. But it was the
sign for the Elaoui men in the city to make their secret bargains
with the actual dealers, a carpet seller with a big shop in a main
street, or a lesser one, like the seller of cigarettes in the blue
cloak on the edge of great Bazaar; and in a day or so the traffic
was in full swing. At times a dealer was caught and disappeared for
years into the grim convict prison. But he never talked. At times a
youth was seen to strike his match at the appointed time in the
appointed street. But if a man couldn't light a cigarette in a
public place at midday, what was the world coming to? The secret of
the distribution had been kept, and with that problem the new and
unknown officer in the Coast-Guard Directorate was set to deal.</p>

<p>Mordaunt thought over his problem as he waited for Rosalind on a
bench in that long avenue which leads at last to the Anglo-American
Hospital. So far fortune had served him. He had seen the match
actually struck. He had noticed expectation in the bearing of a man
whom he knew before the match was struck and relaxation afterwards;
and the man himself was suspect.</p>

<p>Mordaunt wondered whether he had been wise to inform Bryan
Devisher that he would write to thank Septimus for his kindness.
There had been a quite unmistakable flash of fear across Devisher's
face. Yet who but Septimus could have appointed him to a seat in
the offices of the Dagger Line?</p>

<p>Mordaunt shrugged his shoulders. The question was not worth a
minute of debate. For Mordaunt had written on the evening of his
encounter with Devisher thanking Septimus for so readily helping
his acquaintance and hoping, without any great conviction, that
good would come of it. The letter should have reached London now.
It would probably be delivered on Monday morning at the office of
the Company. He had addressed his letter to the Chief Office rather
than to Portman Square, since it was upon a business matter. Well,
in ten days, if not before, he would have an answer; and, as he
pushed the trouble away from him, a small hand fell lightly on his
shoulder and he looked up to find some other trouble waiting to
take its place.</p>

<p>"I am late," said Rosalind.</p>

<p>"There is always an excuse for it," Philip replied as he rose
from the bench, "and to-day I'm afraid a reason."</p>

<p>Rosalind nodded and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"Yes. I had to decide. It was difficult. James thought, that
since I had got this job with Mr. Scobell, I might as well get on
with it."</p>

<p>"James?" Mordaunt asked, rather at a loss. "Is he the successor
to Septimus?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know. I suppose George and James are equal. But
James saw no reason why I should go back. I couldn't help. George,
however, is a real Crottle. We ought to be together, the lot of us,
in one room!"</p>

<p>Her lips twisted a little crookedly even at this moment as she
thought of the code of the Crottles. But Mordaunt knew her well
enough to be assured that her trouble was real. She sat with her
hands folded in her lap, very quiet, looking straight ahead of
her.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My father."</p>

<p>He hesitated. But her face was troubled and perplexed, rather
than grief-stricken.</p>

<p>"He is ill?"</p>

<p>"Not unless he has lost his memory," and she swung round to
Mordaunt, "and can you imagine Septimus doing that?"</p>

<p>"No," Mordaunt answered, and now the nature of the disaster was
clear. "Septimus has vanished?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is lost altogether. Of course we always say that such
things can't happen nowadays. But they always are happening."</p>

<p>Mordaunt sat and stared at Rosalind. He was never very quick to
recognise and separate the sets of complications which one event
might cause. And several questions were struggling to take form in
his thoughts. One came first, and he asked it of her rather
breathlessly. "When did Septimus disappear?"</p>

<p>Rosalind gave him the date and Mordaunt traced it back to a day
which began forty-eight hours after the match had been struck in
the street of Abdul Azziz&mdash;and after Mordaunt had warned
Devisher that he meant to write a letter of thanks to Septimus.
Meanwhile Rosalind explained. "I got this telegram this morning
from George. The Line has two offices, the main big one in
Leadenhall Street and a smaller one in Whitehall, which father, of
late years, used. You know how he lived?"</p>

<p>"By watches."</p>

<p>"He had no fixed rule as to the hour when he went to his office,
but he left it at six every day, from Monday to Friday."</p>

<p>This was his daily walk, whether fine or wet, whether winter or
summer. On this Friday&mdash;it was a Friday and the footpaths, for
that reason perhaps, a little less crowded than at six o'clock they
usually were&mdash;he would have walked up Whitehall until he was
opposite the mouth of Downing Street. There he would have crossed
the road, passed through Downing Street, traversed St. James's Park
to the Mall, and walked up the slope of the Green Park to
Piccadilly. At times, if the weather was very fine, he would
prolong his constitutional to Hyde Park Corner and the Marble Arch,
but as a rule it came to an end in Piccadilly opposite to the Turf
Club. Here he hailed a taxi and was driven home to Portman
Square.</p>

<p>Now on this Friday night a fog was settling like a brown blanket
on the town and the month being October, the nights were closing
in. Septimus was recognised by a policeman under the lamp-post at
the entrance to Downing Street&mdash;and was never seen again. The
nephews waited for some days on the chance that some body would
have met and recognised Septimus, but now George had thought it
wise to telegraph the news to Rosalind and summon her home.</p>

<p>"And you are going?" Mordaunt asked, and when she agreed he
nodded his head once or twice like someone reckoning that here was
a disaster to be added to the rest.</p>

<p>"I am not going for any but rather mean reasons," Rosalind
continued. "They have always expected me&mdash;my family, my
father, too&mdash;to come crawling home, asking for shelter and the
run of the cupboard: I want to go back and show them that one
needn't necessarily fail. I want to wave a flag&mdash;yes, it's
beastly and boastful, I know&mdash;for five minutes. Then I shall
come back again."</p>

<p>"And find me packed off on an easier job, I expect."</p>

<p>Suddenly Rosalind struck the seat with the palm of her hand.
"No, no!" she cried with a curious violence. She sprang to her
feet. "We have had failures, both of us. But we are not to continue
having failures. We are going to do well&mdash;both of us." And she
turned away abruptly to hide perhaps the colour which rushed in her
face. She was aware, quite unwittingly, of a community in their
lives. She had paraded it too far, buoyantly, she had brandished
it. She turned back again to Philip with quite another impulse.</p>

<p>"You will still be digging into your problem," she cried. "I
want to see the end of it. If you are ready to blow the Last Post
outside the walls of Elaoui, wait please, until I can hear the
notes, however far away I am."</p>

<p>She had the eagerness of a child, she was so certain that the
great cause must prevail, that Mordaunt laughed with her on a wave
of confidence.</p>

<p>"I'll try. As you come steaming into Cairo in three weeks, you
shall hear them faint as fairy chimes from the edge of the
hill."</p>

<p>They were moving away to take their luncheon for once in the
grill-room of Shepheard's when the idea came into Mordaunt's head.
It was such a scintillating and illustrious idea, such an idea
amongst ideas, that Mordaunt wondered how he came by it. He stopped
dead on the bridge between the island and the city.</p>

<p>"My word!" he cried.</p>

<p>If ideas were to come to him of such beauty, why, he might solve
the problem of Elaoui before Rosalind came back.</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't like that to happen, Rosalind," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, Philip, it wouldn't be pleasant," Rosalind returned, and it
was noticeable perhaps, although neither of them noticed it, that
this was the first time that in talking together they were using
their Christian names.</p>

<p>"No. I want you to be in on it," he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more lucid," replied Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Of course," said he, and he suddenly began to walk forward at a
great rate.</p>

<p>"Philip, I can't keep up," she replied; and he stopped again,
full of remorse.</p>

<p>"It was the idea."</p>

<p>"Yes, ideas do run away with one," she answered.</p>

<p>"And this one, oh, I want it to be ever so clear."</p>

<p>"It's certainly a little involved at the moment."</p>

<p>"Then I've put it wrong," said Philip.</p>

<p>"You haven't put it at all," replied Rosalind. Philip Mordaunt
stopped and stared at her.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose I haven't," he conceded. "But we'll go along
slowly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are not moving at all now," Rosalind interposed.</p>

<p>Mordaunt looked at the bridge as if he expected it to be a
staircase on the Underground Railway.</p>

<p>"No, we're not," he remarked with surprise.</p>

<p>He walked on again with Rosalind at his side, but now more
discreetly.</p>

<p>"Your boat leaves Port Said?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"You'll get off at Marseilles?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And take the Blue Train?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Right. I'll tell you what, Rosalind! I'll get it all clear in
my mind and whilst we are lunching I'll reel it off."</p>

<p>"That would be a change," said Rosalind and, with a little
gurgle of amusement, she walked by the side of her frowning
companion up the long street to the hotel. They had a wash, they
drank a cocktail, they sat down to luncheon in the grill-room, and
Mordaunt was ready with his idea.</p>

<p>"I took to Portman Square the last time I saw your father, an
acquaintance of mine, Julius Ricardo."</p>

<p>"He was on your yacht with Bryan Devisher."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And with Ricardo, a friend of his, a French detective
of mark, Hanaud."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Hanaud was a big, heavy man with thick black hair and a blue
jowl. He looked rather like a French comedian. He appeared to be as
clumsy as a rhino, but he moved as lightly as an antelope, and he
had quiet eyes which saw everything and a voice which was of no
account and suddenly had all the authority in the world. I watched
him whilst Septimus was reading&mdash;a book about Marie
Antoinette's boy, the young Dauphin of France, and it seemed to me
afterward that if I had wanted an account of that queer event with
nothing left out, I might have got it from him."'</p>

<p>Rosalind Leete was listening now and with much the same
concentration as Hanaud had shown. She no longer interrupted.</p>

<p>"Hanaud was very interested in the death of Daniel Horbury. He
had a question or two to ask of Septimus which I didn't hear, and
he was, I think, inclined to believe that somehow Bryan Devisher
was concerned in it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She recoiled ever so slightly. "Bryan Devisher," she
repeated.</p>

<p>"That's the man to keep in mind," said Mordaunt cheerfully. As
long as you kept him in mind, it seemed that all the inferences
would come trotting up one after another by themselves. "From the
moment he deserted the Agamemnon in Dartmouth Harbour to the moment
when I found him by chance in the Sharia Abdul Azziz, he
disappeared altogether, although the police the next day were
searching for him."</p>

<p>"He disappeared with a letter from you to my father?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A letter of recommendation?"</p>

<p>"No. Of introduction, yes. I gave what I knew of his
history."</p>

<p>"The black rim round the ankle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The Horbury swindle over the necklace?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know of it when I wrote the letter."</p>

<p>Rosalind nodded at him with a frowning brow. "There's a lesson
for you not to write letters to other people's fathers recommending
engaging scoundrels."</p>

<p>"You weren't other people. You aren't other people. Devisher
wasn't engaging. And the letter wasn't delivered," he countered,
and then came dolefully to the honest conclusion: "Yet I am
beginning to be afraid that that letter did all the harm."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because I am only just beginning to think things
out," he said so contritely that Rosalind's hand slipped across the
table and gave his arm upon the table a friendly and comforting
shake. "You see, he couldn't have delivered the letter because he
couldn't have done it until some time on the day when the police
net was out for him&mdash;the Friday."</p>

<p>"Still, when you found him here, he was engaged in the office of
the Dagger Line," she argued, and Mordaunt took her up at once.</p>

<p>"All the more reason to suggest that he hadn't delivered it. The
Dagger Line was almost the Holy Grail to Septimus. To put an
unknown man out of a prison straight away into the Dagger Line
here&mdash;in Cairo&mdash;no, Septimus would never have done it. If
I hadn't been sure of it at once, I ought to have been absolutely
sure the moment I saw the terror in Devisher's face when I told him
that I should write to Septimus and thank him."</p>

<p>"But you did write that day."</p>

<p>"Yes, I wrote," said Mordaunt emphasising the word. For it
condemned him. He pointed towards her hand-bag at her elbow. "You
received a telegram. I gave him a week, a clear week, to telegraph
or telephone."</p>

<p>A silence followed whilst Rosalind followed out the
possibilities which that difference of time suggested. This was how
the story ran then: Devisher had friends who were expecting him in
England, rogues of quality, the Horburys in fact. They had hidden
him, obtained for him somehow this cover in the Steamship Office
and sent him to take his profits and risks in the drug racket in
Cairo. But if Mordaunt's letter of thanks ever reached old Septimus
Crottle, the whole scheme would be blown sky-high. Therefore
Septimus must be kidnapped, removed, got out of the way somehow,
until Mordaunt's letter could be surely intercepted and
destroyed.</p>

<p>Rosalind shrank from facing that tragical dilemma&mdash;but she
did face it. Septimus Crottle came of a tough yeoman stock. He
could face&mdash;he had faced&mdash;disasters and conspiracies. She
knew of no secret flaws in that old and stubborn man which would
defeat him. And such a hue and cry would be raised that all England
would be searching for him and not searching in vain.</p>

<p>This was the legend which commended itself to those two novices
over the luncheon table.</p>

<p>"I will write carefully a letter to Hanaud explaining
everything, the striking of the match, what it means, Devisher's
recognition of it, my foolish letter to
Crottle&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosalind.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the letter this evening in an open envelope. You
will read it and then gum it down so that no one else can read it.
I'll send Hanaud a telegram saying that you will leave the Blue
Train at the Gare du Nord on the morning when you arrive, and that
you will call on him at the Sureté that morning and go on by the
afternoon train to England."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;Rosalind asked doubtfully&mdash;"you say he's
important. Will he see me?"</p>

<p>"I introduced him to Septimus. Of course he will," Mordaunt
replied. "Besides, he's interested in the letter Horbury wrote to
Crottle which was never delivered. Oh, he'll, see you," and as if
to make sure that a meal so dismal should not end in frowns and
gloom, he added: "If you have any luck you'll meet Mr.
Ricardo."</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"><small>CHAPTER 23</small></a><br>
<br>
HANAUD RETURNS, AND ANOTHER</h2>

<p class="first">Faithful to her instructions from a more
experienced traveller, Rosalind continued in the Blue Train from
the Gaze de Lyon to the Gare du Nord. At the Gare du Nord she
descended and followed a porter, who carried her two travelling
cases up the steps to the small hotel in the station building. A
letter was handed to her by the manageress in which Hanaud begged
her to make no fixed arrangements, assured her that his debt to his
English friends would not be diminished by the utmost help which he
could give to her, and that by the time she had made herself
comfortable and taken her little breakfast, a messenger would come
for her. By his signature, he was still a member of the Peerage.
Rosalind enjoyed an admirable hot bath, a change into a well-tended
black suit, a white silk shirt with a frill of lace, a pair of
beige silk stockings and shoes as admirable as her bath, and took
an equally admirable little breakfast in the restaurant. When she
had finished her cigarette a messenger bowed before her. Monsieur
Hanaud was at her disposal. She followed him to a car in the
courtyard and was whisked away through the traffic by a driver, who
used his gong rather as a musical instrument playing a coloratura
solo than as a motorist's signal, across the bridge to the Sureté.
In an office looking out upon the quay and the river, Monsieur
Hanaud received her.</p>

<p>"You will see in England that dear Mr. Ricardo," he said as he
held open an agate cigarette-box. "Will you, please, at some time
suitable, indicate to him I do not offer to my friends those
deplorable cigarettes in a blue paper cover which hurt him so much
when he smells me smoking them. A match? So! You have a letter for
me I think? Thank you! Will you sit here whilst I read it?"</p>

<p>He put her into a comfortable chair whilst he read the letter,
and it was not in order to make her feel more at her ease that he
read it with, now and then, an exclamation of pleasure. When he had
finished it, he laid it down and thumped it with little blows of
his fist.</p>

<p>"So-o-o!" he exclaimed slowly and he became aware of his guest.
He had gleaned something out of that letter more than they knew who
had sent it.</p>

<p>"Madame, the letter is helpful. I sympathise with you over the
absence of your father, Mr. Crottle, but I do not think it will be
for long. Meanwhile, I say that you and the good Mordaunt torture
yourselves without the reason if you think the kidnap was to
anticipate Mordaunt's letter of thanks."</p>

<p>"Then you are acquitting Bryan Devisher of having any share in
all this trouble of the Horburys and the Crottles?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am? Am I? I plead at all events that we do not exaggerate
the share. Listen, as they say in the films," he continued,
hitching his chair forward and then casting his glance in a wide
sweep about the room. He lowered his voice, he nodded his head with
the sagacity of an alderman. "I will tell you the truth. The negro
in the firewood is a bird of another colour."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thank you!" she cried warmly. "That does make everything
so clear."</p>

<p>Hanaud had the grace to blush. He had intended to save himself
from a young lady's questions by making the young lady feel
foolish. All that he had succeeded in doing was to make himself
look ever so much more foolish than she could have felt. However,
he was not a man of grudges. To get your own back was not really a
necessity. He laughed with friendliness.</p>

<p>"I tell you, madame, something more. You are the first to link
with the affair of Crottle the affair of Horbury. Yes, they are
one. What happened on that moonlit night at White Barn? Who was
there? And why? Hours afterwards, when all was over and the
moonlight growing grey, who lifted the telephone mouthpiece from
its cradle to silence it? And who silenced&mdash;oh, something ever
so much more important than the telephone...?" He was following his
own fancies and forebodings as they had crowded in upon him that
August morning in the white house beneath the beech trees and the
oaks.</p>

<p>"Who or what silenced Olivia Horbury? Why did she lock her door?
For how long did she lie in a swoon against it? Only when we know
all that happened at White Barn between the great holly hedge and
the toll gate road on that night of late August&mdash;only then
shall we put an end to the chain of crimes which began there.
Daniel Horbury is murdered. That is no great harm, you may say. But
Septimus Crottle disappears&mdash;and next&mdash;ah, what comes
next?" He broke off with a shiver of the shoulders, so violent so
unexpected, that Rosalind was shocked by it.</p>

<p>"Unless we are quick," Hanaud continued. He folded Mordaunt's
letter to him without noticing what he was doing, slowly and
carefully, so that each crease crossed the paper exactly as it had
done; all his urgency rang in the whisper of his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, unless we are very quick."</p>

<p>Hanaud looked up. He saw Rosalind Leete with a pair of startled
eyes staring at him from a face as white as paper. Was it she? Or
that other woman of whom he dreaded to hear? He moved to bring
himself back from that corner of London. Outside the window those
cries were rising from the quay, that flashing silver flood was the
river Seine under the midday sun. Besides, this one's hair was of
the colour of a summer sunset. That one's hair in London of the
midnight.</p>

<p>"I frightened you," he said remorsefully.</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p>"You will come to London perhaps?"</p>

<p>There was an insistence in Rosalind's question which made him
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must pay for frightening you," he cried and was met with
frowns and disfavour. "I am serious," she said.</p>

<p>Hanaud opened a drawer and produced a passport, a special
request from the Sureté that all help needed shall be granted to
him, a special authorisation from the Home Office and finally a
ticket.</p>

<p>"As soon as Captain Mordaunt telegraphed to me of your coming, I
wrote to my friend the Superintendent, Maltby and at once
everything was made easy. But I must say frankly that there is
nothing which I can do which Maltby cannot do. We had many talks
together, I think in the end we saw with one eye. But frankly, too,
I do not like unfinished things."</p>

<p>Hanaud was preening himself upon the nobility of his character,
whilst he disclaimed all superiority to his English colleague. He
had a false modesty which earned him jeers and sarcasms and
disparagements and a true modesty which kept warm for him the
loyalty of his department. It was the false modesty which was
talking now, mimicking a humility which he did not possess and
depreciating the social value of his calling.</p>

<p>"Now you, Madame Leete, by what route do you travel?"</p>

<p>"I proposed, if I was free, to travel by the afternoon
train."</p>

<p>"Arriving at ten-thirty or so?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Hanaud sat for a minute without speaking. Then he proposed to
her a change. "If you do not arrive to-night," he said, "I do not
think that anything we fear can happen. You are expected to bring
important information?"</p>

<p>"About Bryan Devisher, yes."</p>

<p>"But no one knows yet what your information is. It may be of
more importance than anyone thinks. Therefore it will be waited
for."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But if you arrive to-night, you do not know who will meet you
or how many there will be in the house to hear your story; and
before that awkward hour of midnight it may be known that you have
not so much to tell after all."</p>

<p>Rosalind sat back in her chair. She was breathing rather
quickly. She was still frightened. Nay, she was more frightened
than ever. She felt so near, as this man talked to her, to some
grim lake of horrors writhing just beyond her feet. "What do you
want me to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Keep for us this night safe."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud did not much like the sea. He preferred the
shortest Channel crossing. But, if he had affairs to wind up, he
could sleep without malaise on the steamer from Havre to
Southampton. It was convenient. There was time to dine on arrival
at Havre, and time to dine well. There were private cabins on the
ship, one of which he would procure for Madame, as well as change
her ticket. "La Gare d'Orléans, Madame." A clerk should accommodate
her ticket at Mr. Cook's. And to-morrow morning Mr. Ricardo should
meet them on the quay in his Rolls Royce No. 1, and drive with them
to London.</p>

<p>Hanaud rang the bell and consigned her to his clerk. But while
that man waited outside the door, the truth forced its way to
speech.</p>

<p>"We are neither such clever ones, nor such fools people think. A
crime may be committed. Such crafty plans may be invented to hide
it up that we could never unravel them. But very often a little
accidental thing happens, a change of weather, the departure of a
train changed by an hour, some unexpected visitor at a late hour of
the night. Ah, if we are quick to seize up that small scrap of grit
which blows in from the window and spoils the smooth fine machine,
to know it for what it is, then Madame"&mdash;no, he couldn't keep
it down, the other side of him must have its turn&mdash;"then,
Madame Leete, one becomes Hanaud."</p>

<p>At all events this should be said. By travelling on the Havre
packet to Southampton Rosalind did more than save a night. She
saved a life.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>There were warm salutations by Hanaud and a deprecatory
reception of them by Mr. Ricardo on the quayside. The rest is
silence. It was, besides, early in the morning and the rugs folded
in Rolls Royce No. 1 were appealing. Rosalind had drunk tea and
Hanaud what passed for coffee on the ship. Mr. Ricardo had done as
much at the South-Western Hotel. Hanaud's papers had wafted the two
travellers through the Customs house. The car flowed round Bargate
and along the street Above Bar to Winchester.</p>

<p>"We breakfast here, the English breakfast. Yes, I am the
cosmopolitan. I like him. I eat him. The eggs, the bacon, the sole,
the mutton chops and the Oxford marmalade. The night was
untroubled?&mdash;yes "&mdash;this with a glance of enquiry towards
Mr. Ricardo. "So for half an hour! Then we go on to London. We send
Mrs. Leete home in a cab from Waterloo Station. We collect Maltby:
over the luncheon at the Corner House we hold the council of war.
Then perhaps we stretch out the hand&mdash;and make an arrest," he
was going to add. "But," he stopped and heaved a prodigious
sigh&mdash;"we are in England. Prisoners will not keep in the cell
here. They must be aired in public before the magistrates at once,
yes, and the police must be ready with their case, pronto,
pronto."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, who was prepared like any true-blue to enter the
lists for habeas corpus, regarded his friend's lament as a tribute
rather than as a challenge, and the car drove on through the woods
of Hartley Wintney whilst the shadows were folded away. It was
broad daylight when they dropped down the hill to Cobham and swept
up the left-hand turn on to the open Fairmile. Gorse and heather
and the straight white road running through, and not a soul to be
seen. At least, so it seemed.</p>

<p>There was no one visible ahead. Monsieur Hanaud, who was sitting
opposite to Mr. Ricardo with his back to the bonnet, asked
suddenly: "You permit?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, he turned and rapped upon the
glass panel and within a few yards the car stopped. Hanaud turned
towards Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Leete, I beg you to answer me a question."</p>

<p>"If I can."</p>

<p>"Of whom was Miss Agatha enamoured?"</p>

<p>Rosalind listened. She was amazed, then she intrigued, then she
was wildly amused. She broke a laugh.</p>

<p>"Agatha! Oh, poor Agatha!"</p>

<p>There was no malice, no scorn in the laughter. It was
sufficiently affectionate to persuade her audience that she would
have wished a lover on Agatha if she could.</p>

<p>"Of no one, then?"</p>

<p>Rosalind took the question seriously. Her thoughts ran back to
olden days. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It's six years since I ran out. There was no one then. No one
was ever expected by the rest of us. Perhaps we made it
obvious&mdash;you know how cruel women can be without meaning
it&mdash;and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hanaud, who was listening in an excitement which no other in the
car understood, broke in:</p>

<p>"So that was it, perhaps. She was told too often that she was
the spinster, that there was no man for her, and she invented one.
Oh, it is no new thing."</p>

<p>Rosalind, however, would not accept the calumny.</p>

<p>"She was religious. No! If there were a love story, even if it
were only a dream of a love story, it would have a real live person
for its hero. And I think," Rosalind added, looking out of the
window, "such an apparition would have so astonished her&mdash;at
the beginning, at all events&mdash;that she must have had very good
reasons for believing in his sincerity."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>This fantastic story of the coffin and the locked drawer began
to slide out of a grim fairyland into the land of fact. "Then Miss
Agatha is rich?"</p>

<p>"One might call her so. She was the first child. My mother left
her what she had, shares in the Dagger Line, when they were worth
very little and they are now worth a good deal."</p>

<p>"Rich in her own right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To be signed away over her own hand?"</p>

<p>"If she so chose."</p>

<p>And the coffin slid out stark before Hanaud's eyes. The
outrageous improbability became solid. Someone in desperate need of
money had advanced, had pretended, had prolonged the pretences in
the hope of eventual escape, had inspired a passion, had betrayed
in what bower his hopes really had their home. Hanaud raised his
hands and let them fall rather helplessly. If only he knew what had
happened between the holly wall and the turnpike road on that night
of ending August!</p>

<p>"If there has been anything, it began after I had gone away,"
said Rosalind.</p>

<p>Hanaud smiled gratefully.</p>

<p>"You have told me, not for the first time, more than you think
to have told me. I should have asked you this question before."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because, if I had waited for another five minutes, I should not
have had the chance ever to ask it of you at all."</p>

<p>To the surprise of everyone, he tapped again upon the glass,
and, sliding it to one side, gave an order to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Back the car slowly with the least fussiness possible, until I
tap. Then stop!"</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked behind him. No car was approaching. No one
stirred at all in all that wide expanse of heath and road and sky
except one old man resting upon a bench at the edge of the common
above, the road, with his hands to his face and his elbows propped
upon his knees.</p>

<p>The car slid gently past him below, but he took no notice of it.
It seemed at first that he was in an abstraction, staring at the
ground with his temples between his fingers. Hanaud tapped gently
on the glass and the car stopped without a sound. It was seen then
that the tips of the old man's fingers were working.</p>

<p>Hanaud leaned forward and noiselessly opened the door of the car
at the side of the bank.</p>

<p>"Madame Leete," he said, "there is your father. I saw him as our
car passed."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"><small>CHAPTER 24</small></a><br>
<br>
AN UNLIKELY MEETING ON THE FAIRMILE</h2>

<p class="first">The man on the bench certainly did not recognise
the voice and it is doubtful if he heard the words He was occupied.
On the ground between his feet were a small pile of strips of
sticking-plaster; and now and again his fingers added to it from
his brows and the sockets of his eyes. "Father," Rosalind repeated;
but the old man was not ready, and the small group stood about him
and waited. It was curious to Mr. Ricardo, rather horrible to
Rosalind, and quite comprehensible to Hanaud that this
sticking-plaster covered no wound; the skin below it was patched
and discoloured, but there was no mark of a knife or a blow; and
one of these patches, crossing the lips diagonally from a nostril
to the chin, showed to what purpose the plaster had been put. His
eyes had been hooded and his mouth had been gagged.</p>

<p>He lifted his head and became aware of the group about him. He
looked at Ricardo and at Hanaud and at Rosalind, and then sat back
and drew in some great breaths of air. Then he looked again at
Rosalind, and suddenly barked out with a resentful note in his
voice: "Rosalind, eh?"</p>

<p>Then he laughed as she shrank a foot or so away from him.
"There, my girl, I'm not barking at you for leaving the ship, but
for seeing me in this humiliating condition when you come
back."</p>

<p>He held out a hand to her, and with the help of his other hand
and the back of the seat he managed to struggle to his feet. He
looked at Hanaud and then at Ricardo, balancing himself with
difficulty. There was very little in him of the Septimus Crottle
whom they could remember. He was shrunken now and a good decade had
been added to his years. But the very spirit of the man had gone.
They could see it by the way he clung to his daughter's arm for
protection&mdash;he, the patriarch!</p>

<p>"Mordaunt sent you&mdash;Mordaunt, who thought&mdash;what was
his word?&mdash;that I had no inhibitions, that I was free of the
terrors, of the weaknesses, of the degradations under which other
men fall&mdash;I!" and his voice rose in a scream suddenly, as a
car rose up above the hill at Cobham and raced forward towards the
group. He sank down upon the bench behind them. But the car went
past without slackening. There were people in it, men and women
laughing and talking. Septimus watched it between the bodies of his
friends, at first only with his eyes, then with a trembling finger
until it disappeared in the dust, and then until the dust itself
had cleared away.</p>

<p>"All my life I have had that fear," he went on, communing with
himself rather than talking to his companions, "of being shut away
in a silent place."</p>

<p>"Like the Dauphin of France," Hanaud exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>"A small dark place, where no one came, where one spoke, whence
you couldn't escape," he continue "until&mdash;until you died all
by yourself. All my life had been afraid of it. That's why I liked
the bridge of my ship. The wide air and the stars in front of me. I
tried to laugh the fear out of me&mdash;to bully it out of
me&mdash;and then it happened."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Hanaud, and Septimus Crottle drew back. He tried to
throw a great deal of surprise and scorn into his looks.</p>

<p>"What! Don't you know? You and your friend Maltby? The police?"
and then, in a panic of shame and fear: "Strange that I should
remember names, but of what happened to me that
night&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>To Mr. Ricardo it occurred that there was a question still more
important to be answered. How did the old boy come to find himself
alone on the Fairmile in the early morning with his face visored
and latticed with sticking plaster? And, arising out of the answer
to that question, whatever it might be, was it wise for them all to
be standing in plain view on the high footpath above the road?</p>

<p>He suggested that Mr. Crottle might find the cushions of his car
more comfortable than the hard rails of the park seat by the
roadside. But Crottle was suspicious on the instant. He looked at
the great car, at the white empty road, at Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" he asked, and his head twisted from side to
side.</p>

<p>"You can trust me, sir, in any case," declared Hanaud And Mr.
Ricardo reflected how seldom Hanaud seemed to be important when he
most cried himself up to be and how remarkably dominant and
inspiring he could grow when he was not thinking of himself at all.
Yesterday in Paris, he had been an expert speaking out of his
knowledge and of the wisdom which knowledge had brought. To-day it
was Hernani, and not a very good Hernani either.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo's suggestion was obviously reasonable, and the whole
party moved to the car. But, even in those few moments, it became
still more noticeable how his experience had crippled Septimus, how
swift and complete his disintegration had been. He walked
irresolutely with his shoulders bowed and eyes which, despite his
will, searched at every rustle for an enemy. Even in the car he
must sit with his hand upon the lock of the door and the long
stretch of road visible ahead of him and the driver's mirror well
within his vision.</p>

<p>"We will go forward slowly?" Hanaud asked.</p>

<p>And suddenly, with a flash of cunning, Septimus replied with
another question: "Where to?"</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded with some satisfaction. He had his own answer to
that question and wanted no conflict with Septimus over it.</p>

<p>"Let us see!"</p>

<p>He made a sign to Mr. Ricardo and, as the car moved on towards
London, Septimus Crottle was questioned as to what he remembered of
his disappearance.</p>

<p>"I left the office&mdash;it's almost at the corner of Parliament
Street&mdash;at six, as I usually did. There was a thick fog,
turning brown, and night coming on. It seemed to me the moment to
shorten speed, eh? I've crept across the Bay in my young days in
that sort of weather. There was a street light opposite to Downing
Street. I remember crossing there. There was a policeman standing
just under the light."</p>

<p>"There was," Hanaud agreed.</p>

<p>"I crossed, walked through Downing Street, descended the steps
at the end, and passed the Memorial to the Guards opposite to the
Parade&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that point Septimus Crottle came to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>"Well?" Hanaud asked, and, shaking his head, Crottle answered in
a sullen voice: "I remember not one thing more. The Guards
Memorial, yes. I crossed the road, wondering whether I was going to
be run down by a car. I crossed quickly and I almost ran into the
stone of the Memorial. But I didn't. No, I didn't. But I don't
remember one thing more until&mdash;" and the old man began to
shake. A few little cries, they were less cries than the sobs of
child lost in some jungle of horrors, broke from him and grew in
loudness. His hand fidgeted with the handle of the door. He looked
about him as a man looks, caught by his enemies. He whimpered.</p>

<p>"We shall leave it there," Monsieur Hanaud cried cheerfully,
"until we collect the admirable Maltby," and a shadow of a smile
brightened Septimus Crottle's face. "If my case is in his
hands,&mdash;" he cried.</p>

<p>"But it is, Mr. Crottle," said Hanaud. "We have talked together,
he in the Scotch Yard and I in Paris, over the vanishment of
monsieur and of something else which I, the obstinate, congregate
with it."</p>

<p>Septimus looked up curiously and bowed.</p>

<p>"But there is now a little thing, is there not?" and he made his
two fingers run along the arm of the seat and spring into the air.
Hanaud was nervous, Ricardo decided. Now, why? There was a problem,
or&mdash;to adopt the humorous slang which Mr. Ricardo thought it
modern to approve&mdash;or was there? But he was nervous. Yes. Once
more the fingers ran daintily along the arm at his side and sprang
into the air.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a small&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't do that, please," cried Septimus, watching the two nimble
fingers. "It confuses me. What do you mean by it? Do it again and
I'll jump into the road." The old man, suspicious of this unusual
if harmless manoeuvre, was watching Hanaud alertly, one hand upon
the lock of the door.</p>

<p>"It's all right, father," said Rosalind, and she turned
apologetically to Hanaud. "I expect that any new movement disturbs
him."</p>

<p>"Yes. Certainly any movement so typically French," added Mr.
Ricardo sternly but with a warm inward satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was French," Rosalind confirmed. She was eager to make
discomfort comfortable for her good friend of the Sureté. She had
no reason to realise that if there was one point outside his
profession upon which Hanaud prided himself, it was his anomalous
internationalism. It was just the Frenchiness of the gesture which
worried him.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo hugged himself with pleasure, and who shall grudge
it to him? Hanaud's ears would burn. So English wasn't he? "Mon
pied!" Mr. Ricardo exclaimed silently&mdash;and aloud: "It'll be
all right when we get hold of Maltby."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Maltby," Mr. Crottle repeated happily.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo nodded towards Hanaud.</p>

<p>"We will drive straight to the Yard. Maltby will not dance his
fingers along the arm of the seat. At the Yard&mdash;" and a blank
determined negative came explosively from the most unexpected
quarter:</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>It was Septimus who uttered the word. He was looking from one to
the other with just that bright flash of cunning in his eyes which
they had all noticed before when he was sitting on the garden
seat.</p>

<p>"Maltby, yes&mdash;with Monsieur Hanaud, to whose kindness I am
deep in debt," Crottle continued, "but privately. It is the full
morning now. If we drive into Scotland Yard we may be seen. There
will be many on the Embankment."</p>

<p>"At home, then!" cried Rosalind, but still Septimus shook his
head. "I have servants. I have three daughters&mdash;besides you,
Rosalind. Within an hour the evening correspondents would be
knocking at the door. It is not known that I have come back. I
shall go to a nursing home where no inquiries would be
answered."</p>

<p>With an "Ouf!" Monsieur Hanaud showed them as radiant a face as
a man of his sallow complexion could. "The nursing home, it is
good. But better still is the house of my good friend Mr.
Ricardo."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Mr. Ricardo was not quite sure that he
welcomed this interruption of his routine. Also, if the invitation
had to be offered, he would, on the whole, have preferred to offer
it himself. But Hanaud rushed on. There was an entrance through the
Mews at the back of the house. Also, since it would quickly be seen
that he, Hanaud of the Sureté was visiting once more his old
friend, it would be natural for the good Maltby to call. As for
visitors, Thompson, the invaluable, would reject them, and no doubt
Maltby would lend a fine young fellow who could fit himself into
one of Mr Ricardo's liveries. There were many spare rooms in the
corner house. No one would be so pleased as Mr Ricardo to help in
this affair.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo could do nothing but agree. He certainly did object
to the lack of ceremony in the requisition of his house and perhaps
still more to the trifle of malice in Hanaud's smile. If Maltby was
necessary before the necessity for silence could be explained, so,
too, was Mr. Ricardo's fine house in Grosvenor Square.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, you make fun of your poor Hanaud. Well, well!" Hanaud
exclaimed gaily. "After all, we are twins."</p>

<p>"Personally, I should prefer to say 'quits,'" Mr. Ricardo
replied acidly.</p>

<p>Thus, in any case, it was decided. Septimus was smuggled
unnoticed through the Mews at the back of Ricardo's house and the
car was driven on to Waterloo Station with Rosalind and Hanaud.</p>

<p>"I take you out of your way," Rosalind protested, but Hanaud
shook his head and got in beside her.</p>

<p>"We must be sure that the appearance of papa has not altered the
story to be told," he argued. "You are to say that Mordaunt saw
Bryan Devisher in the street of Abdul Azziz and drank a bottle of
beer with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That Devisher said that he had presented Mordaunt's letter of
introduction to Septimus and that Septimus had appointed him to a
position in the Cairo office of the Dagger Line."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That Mordaunt had written to Septimus to thank him for his
kindness."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head.</p>

<p>"And that Devisher was really concerned with a nation's policy
to rot the Egyptian people with drugs."</p>

<p>Hanaud swung round to the girl. He frowned, he pursed his
lips.</p>

<p>"You would say that?" he asked. "Because a match is struck in a
street?"</p>

<p>Rosalind was astonished. He had listened to her in Paris without
seeming to doubt a word of the story she told.</p>

<p>"Would it be fair to say the match was struck because heroin had
come to Elaoui?" He was drumming on his knees, troubled by a doubt
whether he was fair to a possible enemy. Rosalind found it a little
difficult to identify Hanaud with this extremely scrupulous
officer.</p>

<p>"You think that I should forget that circumstance?" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Ah, circumstance&mdash;yes, the convenient word. But suppose
the true word is coincidence. Then you tell your story and this
poor man&mdash;ouf!"</p>

<p>Rosalind glanced at him again. She said firmly: "I will not
mention the matchbox, nor Elaoui, nor Philip's idea at all."</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud's relief was curiously great. It was all very
well to wish to be fair, but to wish for it much, as first his
anxiety and now his relief established, Rosalind did not believe.
She was not, however, given time to debate the question in her
thoughts. Hanaud chattered to her about her sisters until they
reached the station. They had to discover a train from Southampton
which would fit in with her arrival in a taxi at Portman Square.
They were fortunate there, for a train was due in ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Shall I say you crossed with me, Monsieur Hanaud?" she asked as
he stood by the door of the taxi.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, madame. You can, I am sure, find a
friend whom you wished to seize the opportunity to visit. Better
still, you went to the Paris office of your Line to find out
whether they had news of him. So you missed the boat train."</p>

<p>He stood back and drew a long breath of relief as Rosalind's cab
drove off. He sent Mr. Ricardo's Rolls Royce back to Grosvenor
Square and took another to Scotland Yard. He took a hurried
luncheon with Maltby at a little restaurant in Soho, and at
half-past two he looked, at his watch.</p>

<p>"Septimus Crottle has something to tell us," he said.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said Maltby; and, finding a taxi at the
door&mdash;in those days such miracles happened&mdash;they drove to
the corner house in Grosvenor Square.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"><small>CHAPTER 25</small></a><br>
<br>
AT ARKWRIGHT'S FARM</h2>

<p class="first">Indeed Septimus had something to tell. He sat in
an arm-chair in a big room overlooking the Square and overlooked by
none. He was bathed, shaven, dressed in clean linen borrowed from
Ricardo, with a dark-blue dressing-gown over all. But, the marks of
terror were still engraved upon his face and his eyes were the
eyes, unmistakably explicit, of one who has passed through the
shadows of death. They tell no story, they deny that they have a
story to tell, but they inspire the prayer, "God forbid that I
should suffer as this man has!" And he was years older, shrunken in
his spirit and his courage as much as in his frame. He was like,
too, some sharp and watchful animal of the forests and the heath.
The simplest little unexpected sound set him quivering and, still
worse, cringing, as if there were no end to the new horrors which
stood darkly about him. That this man had ever commanded a great
ship through gales and reefs, across the wide oceans of the world,
and brought his cargoes and his passengers safe to far ports,
seemed to the most unimaginative of his visitors beyond credulity
itself to believe.</p>

<p>Happily Mr. Ricardo had an inspiration from a kindly heart. He
came into the room with Maltby and Hanaud at his heels, carrying a
box of Havana cigars. It was all very well for Septimus to tell the
world that his cigars were the best, but they were no better than
Ricardo's. And, as he held out the box, Ricardo said: "I thought
that you might like to lunch alone, Mr. Crottle, after these stormy
times, but these I hope you will enjoy in company."</p>

<p>The old man's face lit up with the cigar. Mr. Ricardo could have
done nothing more wise. The smoke curling upwards, the fragrance
which comes from nowhere but Havana, with all its associations of
ease and pleasurable moments, brought comfort and a smile to
Septimus Crottle.</p>

<p>"I thank you," he said warmly to Ricardo, and Hanaud, must add
his comment.</p>

<p>"He has the tact, my friend Ricardo. Not from the books of the
deportment writers. No, no, he has it here," and he laid his hand
admiringly upon his heart.</p>

<p>Septimus, however, was finding his recollection crystallise more
easily into speech, now that he had cigar between his lips.</p>

<p>"When I became conscious, my eyes were covered," he said with a
shiver of disgust. "I was aware we were in a car&mdash;a
man&mdash;I think&mdash;I can't be sure, but I doubt if my
instincts would lead me astray&mdash;a man of the sea and a woman."
He was silent for a little while, and went on choosing rather
meticulously his words. "Afterwards&mdash;I can't say more than
that now at events&mdash;there was I with the nightmare of a life
discovered and made true&mdash;oh, yes, discovered! When the
nightmare began, I can't remember, for I've always remembered the
nightmare,"&mdash;he shut his eyes and shivered, looking back over
years of watchfulness and years of imagined horror.</p>

<p>"To be confronted with it, eh?" he looked at Hanaud and from
Hanaud to Ricardo, perhaps with some vague idea that they, who had
been present when his voice had broken over the dreadful history of
the young Dauphin, would picture to themselves with what detail
that history had been staged again.</p>

<p>"They had a lanthorn, which they set upon a white deal table.
They emptied my pockets. They took everything from me except two
things. This," he took out of his waistcoat pocket a small thin
diary with a single thin pencil in a sheath. "They were very jocose
about it. It would pass the time for me to read in the daylight by
the chinks of the shutters the engagements I was going to keep. Oh,
very jocose they were, and unwise. And the second thing was this.
They were funny about this, too."</p>

<p>The second thing was an old battered silver watch with an old
strap and buckle, which he took from his watch-pocket. It was as
big as a turnip, thick and round, and indeed, to modern eyes,
looked comical enough. But Septimus Crottle handled it as fondly as
if it had been a jewel fashioned by Cellini.</p>

<p>"I bought that when I was an apprentice in a clipper. Very funny
they were about that, too. What a fortunate thing it was for me
that, when I wanted to know the time, I shouldn't have to ask a
policeman! Very funny, and still more unwise." He looked at the
clock. "Listen," he said.</p>

<p>The hands made the hour to be three and the silence was broken
by three faint little silvery chimes from Crottle's watch.</p>

<p>"A repeater!" exclaimed Ricardo.</p>

<p>"A repeater. They didn't know. It was just a piece of luggage.
They left it with me and slammed the door and locked it. I was in
the dark with the watch in my hand and, as I stood there, I heard
above the roof of the house the drone of an aeroplane, the throb
and pulse of its engines, the rush overhead and the swift decline
to silence. Even at that moment it was pleasant, companionable, a
promise. I asked my watch the time. It was midnight."</p>

<p>The next morning, by a ray of light, a golden ray on which the
sun danced like Blondin on his tight-rope into the black room,
Septimus had ticked off in his diary the day, October the eighth,
on which he had been taken, and this new day which had come. That
night, too, the friendly aeroplane roared at midnight a friendly
"Here I am," and was gone. Septimus Crottle could test his watch by
its passage. There was a water-tap and a basin and a bucket and a
straw mattress in his shuttered room besides the deal table. At
times&mdash;and with difficulty he blurted out a word here and
there&mdash;he must stand silent with his face to the wall, whilst
the room was cleaned and his food brought in. But no one spoke and,
like all prisoners, he began to live little things, and, above all,
for the moments when he could tick off the day in his diary and
when the aeroplane announced from afar its approach, thundered
overhead and died away.</p>

<p>"In a little while I was able to expect it," he said, "sitting
in the dark. Then I would hear it and press the spring of the
repeater. It was punctual like a postman, sometimes on the tick of
twelve, sometimes few seconds later. I think that waiting for the
noise it kept me alive all through that first week. And the one
night it didn't come at all."</p>

<p>To each one of his auditors, so completely were they held by the
sombre fire of his eyes and the simplicity of his tale, the sudden
drop of his voice to a whisper brought the same shock of
catastrophe which the absence of the aeroplane had brought to
him.</p>

<p>"Even later on...?" Hanaud began in a hush.</p>

<p>"That night it never passed overhead at all."</p>

<p>"You are sure? "</p>

<p>"I lay awake until the morning was a grey mist in the room."</p>

<p>"And what morning was this?" cried Maltby with curious
violence.</p>

<p>Old Septimus opened his diary.</p>

<p>"The fourteenth of October. Look! I put a ring about the line
which marked the day. For it looked as if I had lost my only
friend."</p>

<p>Maltby almost snatched the diary from his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, the fourteenth. But you heard it the next night?"</p>

<p>Septimus came to life again. There was a smile upon his face, a
kind of lilt in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it the next night. And every night of the six
nights which followed. I heard it even yesterday."</p>

<p>But Maltby had not waited to hear the end of that sentence. He
was out of the room. They heard his feet running down the stairs to
the hall; and a moment afterwards his voice upon the telephone.</p>

<p>But they distinguished none of the words; and now that Septimus
had come to the end of his narrative, the fatigue of his adventure
was upon him and his head nodding on his shoulders. A bedroom,
however, had been prepared for him and Mr. Ricardo's housekeeper, a
matron and such as one could count upon in that household, was at
the door.</p>

<p>"A nice sleep, a nice dinner in bed..."</p>

<p>"And another nice cigar after the dinner," said Crottle with a
grin at Ricardo.</p>

<p>"And the gentleman will be himself again," observed Mrs.
Ffennell, the housekeeper, "if he isn't that already."</p>

<p>But there was still some knowledge for which Hanaud could not
endure to wait until the next morning.</p>

<p>"Before you go, sir," he exclaimed, throwing himself in front of
Septimus and his hands flapping signals of distress to Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Let us finish with it. You are wondering how you came to find
me on a bench half-way along the Fairmile?"</p>

<p>"But exactly," cried Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell you. All I know is that these people, the
man and the woman, talked late. I heard their voices through the
floorboards. Then I heard the motor-car being brought from
somewhere. I used my watch. It was three in the morning. They came
up the stairs almost immediately afterwards with the lanthorn. But
I was not able to see much, as you know," and now there was more
anger than horror at the indignities which he had suffered. "I was
no match for them, even if I had possessed my usual strength. I got
up and dressed, whilst they hurried me."</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment whilst he straightened out his
recollections.</p>

<p>"Yes. They were frightened. It gave me a sudden shock of
pleasure," and Crottle's face cracked with grin more blissful than
any which Hanaud could remember. "Their hands shook. They spoke too
quickly to be understood, as if the hangman were at their
heels."</p>

<p>Again the old man's voice dropped to a whisper. "When I could
see nothing, nor speak, they were busy with the room. There were
nails torn out of the shutters and the shutters folded back. The
mattress was pulled out of the room. It all took a few minutes I
think the room was dismantled Then I was take down to the car. They
spoke in whispers. We drove off quietly and slowly. Then we drove
faster and for hours. But whether we went backwards and forwards,
or straight, is more than I can tell. They turned me out about
seven o'clock&mdash;a little later perhaps."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment. Mr. Ricardo was looking at his diary.
Summer time would end in a couple of days now. The dawn would just
be showing when Septimus Crottle was pushed out of the car at the
edge of the common.</p>

<p>"Yes, we passed about eight," Mr. Ricardo declared but Hanaud
did not answer.</p>

<p>"That's all I have to tell you," said the old man.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo sprang to his feet and went with him to the door.
There Mrs. Ffennell, the housekeeper, and Thompson awaited him and
led him to his room.</p>

<p>"That was interesting," said Mr. Ricardo as he came back into
the room. He saw Hanaud still seated in his chair, his face
troubled and perplexed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "a terrible story. Did you follow Crottle's
reactions? Now that old fear was at the top of his mind, now the
mishandling, the affront to his dignity."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was excited. He was living great deep moments. He
took a glance at the window. Outside, in the Square, men and women
were going about their ordinary business, unaware of all that was
happening up here just above their heads. An old man telling a
story of cruelty, and Hanaud and Maltby and himself launched out to
catch the criminals.</p>

<p>"A strange, grim story, my friend," he cried with pride. He
almost added, "Find its equal in France, if you can!"</p>

<p>But, before he could utter so outrageous a boast, Hanaud quietly
interposed.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I find most curious? They were frightened. The
man and the woman. In the middle of the night they must take the
old fellow away, dump him somewhere along an empty road and fly
off. They were frightened. Why? No one challenged them. Why?"</p>

<p>He was still pondering this question when the door was flung
open. Maltby came back into the room and his face was alight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crottle?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He has gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Good. There will be a plain-clothes officer in the house
to-night. He will run no danger."</p>

<p>Hanaud looked up at him.</p>

<p>"You have news?"</p>

<p>Maltby nodded his head. Mr. Ricardo could have shaken him. He
had no vivacity, no emotions? But at last Maltby spoke.</p>

<p>"The Western Air Company flies a nightly service from Heston. It
stops at Taunton, Exeter and Plymouth. It leaves Heston at eleven.
On the night of the fourteenth of October the engine failed a
quarter of an hour after it had taken off. It was able to return to
Heston. There was no service to Plymouth that night."</p>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"><small>CHAPTER 26</small></a><br>
<br>
TWO OF THE LITTLE ACCIDENTS</h2>

<p class="first">There were not many travelling by the Airway on
that night, and the three men at the back of the car could talk and
watch without interruption. Two nights had passed since the moon
was full, but the black curtain was rolled back from the sky now,
and more and more clearly the tranquil countryside reached out
below, great trees and their shadows on fields of silver-grey, long
rounded ridges of turf and rock which sprang high and broke off,
rivers like glistening highways. And now and then they sank low
enough to imagine that by holding their breath they could hear the
lowing of cows.</p>

<p>"We could hear of no other service which missed a beat, as you
might say, on the night of Thursday, October the fourteenth,"
Maltby declared in answer to a question from Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes now," said Mr. Ricardo looking at his watch, and
Hanaud fetched out of his pocket the clumsy silver chronometer of
Septimus Crottle. He laid it face upwards on the table between
them, and all three bent their heads over the white face.</p>

<p>"Twelve minutes, by the old man's repeater," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was regarding his friend with awe. He looked round
suspiciously. There were three naval officers on their way to
Plymouth, a journalist bound for Exeter, and a couple of holiday
folk for Cornwall. But they were all to the front of the car. He
turned back to Hanaud.</p>

<p>"I should never have thought of that," he said, reproaching
himself, "if I lived till I was a hundred. You actually borrowed
the watch from Mr. Crottle?"</p>

<p>Hanaud shook his head.</p>

<p>"I took it when he wasn't looking."</p>

<p>Whether borrowed or taken, the watch was an advantage. It gave
them an absolute precision for their arrangements.</p>

<p>"If you, Monsieur Hanaud, will watch on this side of the plane,
Mr. Ricardo and I will look after the other."</p>

<p>Maltby moved across the aisle and drew back the curtain. Ricardo
placed himself in the seat in front and both stared down through
the moonlit air. The aeroplane was travelling along a big
whale-backed ridge like one of the Berkshire Downs. Here and there
the smooth turf was broken by a black outcrop of rock; here and
there in a scoop of the sides there grew a little spinney of
larches. Below and along the three men watched with a concentration
which spread through the car and provoked the curiosity of the
other travellers, so that their conversation ceased and they, too,
began to look downwards, but for what they did not know.</p>

<p>On the table in front of Hanaud the monstrous watch of Septimus
ticked, it seemed to Ricardo, louder and louder with each second.
He saw now, beside the surface of the down below him, flat meadows
to his right, with cut ditches in which water gleamed, and a long
way forward and to his right a sprinkling of lights which betokened
a town. Bitter thoughts came into his mind "We are on the wrong
air-line. There will be another company running a different
service. Perhaps, if Maltby hadn't booked us as ordinary
passengers! In front there, in the pilot's cabin, a man would see
more clearly." Why was it so important to hide their movements?
Secrecy&mdash;hush, hush&mdash;there could be too much of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo was beginning to boil with exasperation, when
suddenly Hanaud's finger closed upon a spring and the clear, yet
tiny chimes, chimes of the little people, tinkled with a strange
incongruity through that most modern of carrier wagons.</p>

<p>"We shall miss it," Ricardo cried, and even as he cried he saw
it, just ahead, just before the down broke off abruptly in the
plain. It stood in the open upon a slope of ground, with a break
like a quarry in the side of the down behind it, a farm-house
without a light in any window, and not another house visible its
neighbourhood. Ricardo turned excitedly towards the Superintendent.
"Do you see? Do you see?" he asked in a whisper, and the rudder of
the aeroplane gave a wriggle. The machine was turning, so that it
would move straight over the house towards the grouped lights of
the city. In a second Hanaud would see it upon his side. Mr.
Ricardo rushed across the cabin. Hanaud was sitting with his face
at the window and his hands curved about it to shut out the light
above and behind him.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" And the aeroplane swung clear of the down and
swept across the fields and dykes of Sedgemoor to the airport on
the edge of the city.</p>

<p>"Did you see?" asked Ricardo.</p>

<p>Hanaud picked up the watch and tucked it away in his pocket, a
little embarrassed by his friend's excitement. But Maltby cleared
the air with a most unveracious story.</p>

<p>"The house was probably not that house, but one of an earlier
date. But certainly Monmouth was taken there. His men had broken
before Colonel Kirke's pikes on this flat land. Monmouth, I think,
was found under a truss of straw in one of the outbuildings."</p>

<p>Maltby noticed the other passengers turning away with a smile
from these historical enthusiasts, and the aeroplane took the
ground.</p>

<p>As they dismounted a big man in a blue suit advanced towards
them. "Superintendent Maltby? My name's Lance. Inspector
Lance."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>"There are rooms for your party engaged at the hotel," said
Lance, "and I would rather talk there."</p>

<p>A car was waiting, and a few minutes afterwards Inspector Lance,
in a comfortable sitting-room warmed by a bright fire, with a hot
grog at his elbow, was administering, not without a certain
pleasure, the coldest of cold douches to his colleague from the
Metropolis.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you have wasted your time, Superintendent. If
I had only known before," and he sighed as he looked into the
coals.</p>

<p>"You couldn't, because we didn't," Maltby answered.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, for instance," said Lance slowly.</p>

<p>Maltby smiled.</p>

<p>"If we had known yesterday, I should have been able to give you
a much more complete account of how much we needed your help than I
could over the telephone this afternoon."</p>

<p>Inspector Lance admitted by implication to have had his plumage
a trifle ruffled.</p>

<p>"The call sounded a little abrupt." Nobody could be humbler than
Maltby when something was to be gained by humility.</p>

<p>"It must have," he agreed remorsefully. But there had been no
time for the courtesies. He had only just that moment learnt what
air service failed on the night of October 14th. "But perhaps now
you will, over another glass of this excellent whisky, allow me to
tell you a little more particularly of our need."</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and on the appearance of the Boots&mdash;for
it was then half an hour after midnight&mdash;said "Repeat!"</p>

<p>The Boots looked at Hanaud, and, whether he was naturally
sympathetic or just wished to spare him an unnecessary journey up
and down the stairs, pointed out: "The foreign gentleman has drunk
nothing."</p>

<p>"I want nothing," Hanaud snapped. As if he couldn't pass for an
idiomatic Englishman anywhere!</p>

<p>Maltby was suddenly afraid that here again the proper courtesies
had been neglected.</p>

<p>"This is Monsieur Hanaud of the Sureté in Paris," he said,
addressing the whole room. He tried to gather a few bouquets from
his recollections, but once again the notice was too short, "of
whose activities you will not need me to remind you."</p>

<p>It was not very good, no, and Hanaud was justly annoyed.</p>

<p>"You will not join us, monsieur?" asked Lance, and Ricardo
seized the moment gleefully.</p>

<p>"Hanaud is partial to a peppermint frappé, which he is unlikely
to get at this hour of the night in the west of England. So perhaps
a glass of Porto or a cup of coffee?</p>

<p>"Ah! Coffee!" cried Hanaud, and the Boots went away upon his
errand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maltby filled in those details of the history of
Septimus Crottle which he had not had the time to give over the
telephone. When he had finished, Inspector Lance threw his hands up
in the air.</p>

<p>"The luck of the thing! Of all the unchancy businesses," and he
swung round, now thoroughly mollified, to his companions.</p>

<p>"Arkwright's. That's the name of the place. A farm once, and not
so bad. But the owner, old Mrs. Destries over to Bridgewater, sold
off most of the land, and the house stood there unlet for a long
time."</p>

<p>In the end a man, Frank Barnish, with his wife, had hired it. It
had a few acres of grazing land, which they let, and made do with a
vegetable plot, a small orchard, a couple of pigs and some
chickens. He had been a sailor, it seemed, but they made no
friends; he, a hulking big fellow, cantankerous and sullen, and she
a good match for him. They gave no trouble but, nobody liked them;
they never fitted in. They were just solitary people in a solitary
place. They had some money of late weeks, and had bought somewhere
in London an old motor-car.</p>

<p>"A battered old blue thing to look at," said Lance. "But once I
saw her coming into the town, and she could go."</p>

<p>He looked straight at Maltby and added: "So it's just your bad
luck, Superintendent."</p>

<p>Maltby was tired by now of vague assertions that his luck was
out. He answered shortly: "What is?"</p>

<p>"That you didn't come yesterday."</p>

<p>"They have gone?"</p>

<p>Inspector Lance nodded. He got up and offered a cigarette to
Maltby, began to offer one to Monsieur Hanaud, but, seeing what he
was smoking, fell back aghast, and was offered and accepted a cigar
for himself by Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Yes. Upon receipt of your message&mdash;sounds like old days,
doesn't it, Superintendent?&mdash;in accordance with instructions,
I proceeded, etcetera, etcetera.."</p>

<p>"The people who put through the message to you from the Yard
don't seem to have used very much tact, I am afraid," Maltby
replied dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. Urgency and good manners have different
patterns," said Lance. He conveyed to everyone in the room a
pleasant sense of enjoyment. Here were two important officials from
London and Paris and a tertium quid all of a flutter, who had flown
down to teach the West Country yokels their business, whereas if
they had only talked with reasonable clarity over the
telephone...</p>

<p>"You see, we sent out a police-officer upon the receipt of your
message to keep an eye upon Arkwright's, and he reported that there
was no one about."</p>

<p>"When was that, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"About seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"And where did he report from?"</p>

<p>"Arkwright's."</p>

<p>The Barnishes had a telephone in a living-room which they never
used, except perhaps for telephoning. The police-officer had found
the door on the latch and not an answer to a cry.</p>

<p>"I told him to hold on and I would send him another man to keep
him company. Empty houses at night are creepy things. We shall find
the two men there in the morning. There's obviously nothing more
that we can do until then."</p>

<p>Inspector Lance picked up his hat and threw the stump of his
cigar into the fireplace.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Hanaud, at his sweetest, "and should ever
fortune send you on the air to Paris, may I do no less for
you!"</p>

<p>Inspector Lance looked a trifle doubtfully at Hanaud, as though
he were not quite sure how to interpret that sentence. He bowed,
however, and remarked: "I hope that you'll all be comfortable."</p>

<p>He was just opening the door he came to a halt. He clicked his
tongue several times against his palate in annoyance, shut the
door, and marched back into the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"It is by our mistake, perhaps, that the Barnishes have escaped
you. I hope not. We had our local duty to do, and no word from you
earlier, I think, than four."</p>

<p>Hanaud leaned forward. What little pellet of discomfort was the
Inspector now going to discharge upon them? One fairly potent in
aroma, Hanaud gathered from the slow-savouring smile of penitence
which waited upon his speech.</p>

<p>"We knew nothing until then," Maltby declared. "We telephoned as
soon as we knew."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what a pity! You see, a farmer who grazes his sheep on
the down at the back of Arkwright's sent in the morning before a
shepherd to complain of a dog which had killed some of his ewes.
The man thought that the dog was an Irish wolf-hound. Well, you
gentle men of the Yard will know that an Irish wolf-hound's like a
German. He can't be cured. So, naturally, we got to work and,
naturally, Arkwright's was the first objective."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Hanaud jumped from his chair.</p>

<p>"Arkwright's was the nearest house. Also, Barnish was a morose,
unfriendly man. It might, perhaps, give him a sullen sort of
pleasure to injure a neighbour, especially with some cruelty added.
Moreover, if he had a dog, he hadn't something else which went with
it&mdash;a dog licence."</p>

<p>"And when did you send your officer?" Hanaud asked.</p>

<p>"Let me see. The shepherd reached us about twelve. We sent Cox
out&mdash;yes&mdash;as soon as he had had his dinner. He went off
upon his bicycle at two o'clock or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"Yesterday?" said Maltby.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;conveniently but incorrectly," Inspector Lax
replied, and he looked at the clock on the mantel "It's getting on
towards two o'clock in the morning&mdash;yes, we'll call it
yesterday. Cox bicycled out to Arkwright's at two o'clock on the
afternoon of Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Tuesday," said Mr. Ricardo with approval. He did not mean to be
a cipher in these agreements and explanations, even though,
whenever he did put in his everybody else turned and stared at him
as though had only at that moment materialised in the room.
"Tuesday afternoon at two."</p>

<p>"Barnish was at home," Lance continued. "It's a curious old
house, shingle and bricks and little windows. There's an archway
through to the yard at the back and the front door, as you might
say, is on the right-hand side under the arch."</p>

<p>"Then Cox got off his bicycle," Mr. Ricardo suggested, to help a
rather lame story on to its climax, and met the thoughtful glance
of the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, did he?" the Inspector asked. "Did he get off his
bicycle? Or did he just stop at the door, like, with one foot on
the ground and the other on the pedal? We'll have to consider of
that. It didn't occur to any of us that you gentlemen would think
the point important."</p>

<p>There was only one action for Mr. Ricardo to take, and he took
it. Hadn't the Duke of Wellington once gone on his knees to a
ridiculous Spanish General who had felt himself insulted? "The
matter being important&mdash;down I plumped," wrote the Duke and,
fortified with that example, Mr. Ricardo grovelled.</p>

<p>"I won't interrupt again. I apologise, Inspector, on my knees,"
he said meekly.</p>

<p>Inspector Lance was mollified.</p>

<p>"He did get off, I think, for as he was propping his bicycle
against the wall, the house door being a bit open, he heard a chair
flung back and a dish clattering on the floor, as if the Barnishes
had been fairly startled, and in a second Barnish was blocking the
doorway, with a face like thunder. He began with a quarrelsome,
'What do you want?' and then saw Cox's uniform. Cox said he turned
quite sickish in colour, but looked better when he was asked
whether he had an Irish wolf-hound or any sort of dog."</p>

<p>Barnish said that he had none, and stood in the door way as if
that ended the matter. But Cox was pertinacious and said that he
would go in and have a look round. For a moment it seemed that
Barnish would hinder him, as, of course, he had a right to do, but
he stood aside at last.</p>

<p>"'All right,' he said. 'But you people in your uniforms, you
upset women, you know.'"</p>

<p>And certainly when Cox pushed his way into the kitchen he saw a
very frightened woman. But there was no dog, though he looked into
the cellar to find him. Cox did not go upstairs. First, because the
stairs weren't visible from the kitchen. They were behind a door at
the end of a corridor. Second, if the animal were locked up
anywhere, it would be in the outbuildings. Cox searched the
outbuildings beyond the arch, with Barnish and his wife treading
upon his heels, and it had none of the pleasure of a treasure-hunt.
He was very glad to make sure that there was no dog upon the
premises, get upon his bicycle again&mdash;this last the Inspector
underlined with a formal little bow to Mr. Ricardo&mdash;and report
to headquarters.</p>

<p>"Cox wasn't comfortable about his visit to Arkwright's," Lance
continued. "There was something about the two Barnishes which he
didn't understand, something which gave him gooseflesh, he said,
and Cox isn't the man to get queer fancies. Then, at four o'clock
to-day, you telephoned."</p>

<p>Inspector Lance walked to the door.</p>

<p>"You would like to see Arkwright's, no doubt," he said. Hanaud
directed an imploring glance towards Maltby and Maltby understood
and replied accordingly: "Very much, if it could be early."</p>

<p>"We'll make it eight o'clock if you like, and you could catch a
fast train up to London at nine-fifteen."</p>

<p>Thus it was arranged. Hanaud stood looking into the fire after
Lance had gone with a curious smile breaking the composure of his
face and then vanishing and recurring again. He was remembering the
speech he had made to Mrs. Leete in Paris, and how pat this example
had come upon it. A plot was worked out, watertight,
undiscoverable, with its sequences and rehearsals; a foggy night, a
kidnapping, a lonely farm where, sooner or later, release could be
arranged, unless, happiest consequence of all, madness solved all
the troubles and made truth an acrostic which none could ever read.
But for two small accidents! An aeroplane crossing the sky each
night above the prison house at midnight, and a sheep-killing dog
which brought a policeman from town.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Hanaud, "Barnish and his wife thought the game
was up, the dog licence an excuse for the snoop, and, one, two,
they get rid of their prisoner and disappear. The little accidents
one cannot foresee, they burst open perfect crimes."</p>

<p>But the morning was advancing, and no one, not even Mr. Ricardo,
was willing to listen further.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maltby curtly. "Rouse[?] and two people who walk a
mile or so home from a country dance. And a newsboy sent back one
morning for a fresh batch of papers who passes a door three times,
and sees it shut, and finds it open, and next time it's shut again.
Oh, yes! Suppose we go to bed!"</p>

<p>To bed they went. And a few minutes after eight that morning
they were trampling, with a little more noise than perhaps was
necessary, about the squalid house and precincts of Arkwright's
Farm. Why they were noisy, no one of them was quite sure, no one
would have admitted it if he had been sure. Horror and fear and
suffering had left behind them in that house an air which was heavy
and charged with dim threats. For no reason, each one looked
quickly over his shoulder when he had passed a door, or, if he
turned a sharp corner, made shift to return upon his steps in
silence to see whether he was followed. And in one room the three
of them halted with one accord. It was a bare room with no
furniture in it but a deal table in a squat tower with a broken
window over the back yard and a little hatch upon the corridor.</p>

<p>All eagerly agreed with Lance that it was the service hatch
which had turned their suspicions into certainties. But it was
nothing of the kind. As they stood in the wretched room, they knew
that they had reached the end of their search. There was an
oppression which weighed upon their brains, a cruelty which
clutched at heir hearts until they hurt. Maltby stepped forward,
but very quietly, like a churchwarden in a church, and, pulling
forward one of the shutters from the clip which held it to the
outside wall, showed them where the screws had fixed it to the
window frame.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, as though he were confirming some thing they
were all agreed about, "it was here."</p>

<p>"Yes, the room is hateful," said a voice which Ricardo hardly
recognised as Hanaud's, so quiet and yet so respectful was the
sound of it. But no more was said. Inspector Lance was looking at
his watch. "If you gentlemen want to catch the nine-fifteen&mdash;"
and Hanaud started again into animation.</p>

<p>"I think we do," said Maltby, and to Hanaud: "You agree?"</p>

<p>But Hanaud's face was so smoothed out with relief that no words
were needed from him. He uttered them none the less, and they
remained for a long while stark in Mr. Ricardo's thoughts.</p>

<p>"What I see and smell and touch through all this house, and,
above all, in this empty room, is cruelty. We ought to be
quick."</p>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27"><small>CHAPTER 27</small></a><br>
<br>
SHATTERING QUESTIONS</h2>

<p class="first">"The first thing to do always," said Maltby, "is
put people in their proper places."</p>

<p>"The difficulty is to know what are their proper places," Hanaud
complained.</p>

<p>"Well, I know mine," said Septimus. "I am Chairman of the Dagger
Line of Steamships, and my first business is to know what sort of
hash my young directors have made of my business during my weeks of
absence."</p>

<p>He pressed the butt of his cigar down in an ashtray and looked
towards Maltby. "And perhaps you, Superintendent, could find time
to come with me and learn whether any demand for ransom has been
made?"</p>

<p>"Ransom? Ah! That is an idea. Yes," Hanaud cried with a bright
look, as though the suggestion of ransom was one of those original
strokes of genius which suddenly illuminate a mystery. "You will go
to your main office in Leadandall Street?</p>

<p>"Leadenhall Street," Mr. Crottle corrected.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I said," Hanaud replied. "Then if I come with you,
perhaps, Mr. Crottle, you will tell a clerk to find a cabin for me
on a nice big ship to Cherbourg?"</p>

<p>Mr. Crottle turned with a little disappointment in his face.
"You are returning?"</p>

<p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders. "You sail on Fridays. I remember
that you said so."</p>

<p>"Yes, but to-day&mdash;this morning&mdash;" Maltby exclaimed in
perplexity, "you spoke very seriously."</p>

<p>"I am a serious person," said Hanaud.</p>

<p>"You spoke some other words," Maltby hesitated to repeat them in
Mr. Crottle's presence. "And after them, 'We ought to be
quick.'"</p>

<p>"So, you see, I shall only have a few hours to roll with my
friend Ricardo."</p>

<p>For a moment there was the silence of stupefaction. But Mr.
Ricardo was an expert interpreter: "He means to loaf," he
explained; but it was not the alluring picture of Hanaud and
Ricardo rolling in each others' arms across Grosvenor Square which
had brought Maltby so sharply up. He and Hanaud were staring at one
another. Quite slowly Hanaud nodded thrice, and the doubt cleared
away from Maltby's face.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>Now, all these vague sentences and vaguer glances which had been
spoken and exchanged since Hanaud had asked Septimus for a passage
to Cherbourg were intelligible enough to Mr. Ricardo. The affair
would finish before to-night. The whole affair. Horbury as well as
Crottle. That was clear. But the conversation up to that moment was
a different matter altogether.</p>

<p>It took place after luncheon in Ricardo's dining-room. The
three&mdash;Maltby, Hanaud and Ricardo&mdash;had got back to the
house to find Septimus up and dressed and impatiently walking an
imaginary bridge in Mr. Ricardo's library; and whilst Julius was
ordering luncheon and the appropriate wine to go with it, and
causing as much delay as was possible, the other two had some kind
of a conference with Septimus Crottle. From that conference
resulted undoubtedly Crottle's proposal to present himself at once
at his head office with Maltby, and Hanaud's decision to seek at
the same place a passage to Cherbourg. The conversation, however,
seemed natural and spontaneous enough, but there was no debate, and
to Mr. Ricardo, who liked now and then to enliven his language with
a slang word, it all sounded phoney. It gave him the impression
that he was being deliberately excluded from the climax. He didn't
like that at all.</p>

<p>"After all, where would they have been without me?" he asked of
himself indignantly. He had noticed things every now and then. He
had been the first to distinguish Arkwright's Farm, hadn't he? And
here they were leaving him at home. In fact, here was Septimus
holding out his hand to him.</p>

<p>"I thank you very much for your hospitality," he said. "From the
office I shall go home to Portman Square, where I shall look
forward to the pleasure of seeing you."</p>

<p>It was almost worse to hear Maltby observing with a kindly nod:
"You will, perhaps, let me disturb you again when we have put our
heads together with the young directors?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, indeed, was almost in tears. An outsider, he! The
mere caretaker of the corner house! And at that, as Crottle and
Maltby were going out of the door, the voice of Hanaud fell upon
his ears like balm upon an open wound.</p>

<p>"Let them go first in a taxi. We follow in the Rolls Royce. It
will be easy."</p>

<p>"But it's in the garage," cried Ricardo in despair.</p>

<p>Hanaud shook his head with a beaming smile.</p>

<p>"I took the liberty. I spoke to Thompson. It was not my place.
You forgive?"</p>

<p>"But I am grateful," Ricardo explained; and the taxi was still
in sight across the square when the Rolls Royce slid noiselessly to
the door. It was not Mr. Ricardo's habit to look with any
complacency upon intruders who took upon themselves to ride his
small thunders and direct his storms, but he rejoiced that they
were easily able to keep the taxicab within their vision.</p>

<p>"It is the fault of Monsieur Crottle," Hanaud explained, rather
nobly to Mr. Ricardo's thinking. "He cannot forgive me for that I
prefer the peppermint and the cigarette."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo must answer nobility with nobility. "No, no, my
friend, blame me and Maltby. It is not formal and correct that I
should be here."</p>

<p>And so, disputing gracefully, they drove up to the door of the
Dagger Line in Leadenhall Street on the number plate of the taxi;
and Mr. Ricardo stepped nimbly from the car to the annoyance of
Superintendent Maltby. But he said nothing. For Septimus walked
straight from the street into the big front office.</p>

<p>By the door a commissionaire sat at a small desk and at the
sight of Septimus he uttered a cry. Then he rose to his feet and
stood with his hand at the salute. And that was more than enough.
Behind a long counter which ran from wall to wall there were many
desks. From each of those desks there rose a man with some warm
exclamation of welcome in his mouth. They crowded to the long
counter. One or two of the chief clerks held out their hands, and
as Septimus, for once in a way openly moved, grasped them and said
with a smile of mock surprise, "Well, upon my word, I seem to be
popular with my officers," there broke forth laughter and rapping
on the long mahogany board, and a lift of voices which were
obviously going to end in a rousing chorus of "For he's a jolly
good fellow."</p>

<p>But the welcome never rose to that height. For, just when all
Leadenhall Street was about to ring with a celebration which really
belonged more to Lloyds across the way, a bell rang and an angry
voice shouted through the room on a loud-speaker: "I can't hear
myself speak."</p>

<p>Septimus stepped back and all the joyous clamour died suddenly.
Mr. Ricardo noticed a change in Crottle's face which baffled his
understanding. It moved in a second from good humour to an anger so
violent as to pass belief. That so much fire could blaze in old
eyes, or that an old face, carved by time, could twist into a shape
so malignant, was the strangest of metamorphoses. It was the flash
of a moment, like some swift scene in a moving picture, so swift
that it was almost invisible, but so vivid that it left a memory
more real and complete than a mountain of detail could have
done.</p>

<p>Crottle lowered his head then, so that none could see his face,
and stood as still as a statue in a silence which had grown
constrained and somehow rather alarming. Then, in a quiet voice, he
said:</p>

<p>"That complaint came from my room, I think."</p>

<p>The head clerk flushed and stammered. "Yes, sir. They moved in
there."</p>

<p>"They?"</p>

<p>"Mr. George and Mr. James."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>It was more than a trifle shocking to Mr. Ricardo to see how
deeply the old man was moved by this encroachment of his nephews.
They had been tactless, culpably tactless, too ready to assume that
Septimus's chair was empty and too quick to share it. The business
of the Dagger Line had to go on, that was evident, but they could
have controlled it for a few weeks without changing their offices.
They wanted all the trappings at once. It was not very clever. At
the same time, the old man's rage was quite extravagant.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I didn't serve under him," was one of Ricardo's
thoughts, and, "Upon my word, Rosalind was quite right to run out,"
another. For still Septimus dared not show them his face and,
though his body was quiet, his voice shook.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "it's a good rule to take the first of
the tide. Only the tide don't always run true," and in an effort to
smile with good humour he contrived the ugliest grimace which
Ricardo had ever seen.</p>

<p>A clerk lifted a flap in the counter.</p>

<p>"I'll tell the young gentlemen that you have returned, sir," he
said, and at once Septimus stopped him.</p>

<p>"You won't, indeed," Septimus replied; and now there was some
pleasure in his voice, a rather acid pleasure. He laughed. "We'll
surprise them. You, too, Mr. Ricardo. I'm glad that we didn't leave
you behind after all."</p>

<p>Septimus was chuckling with enjoyment. School-boyish, perhaps,
and a grim sort of schoolboyishness at that, Ricardo reflected.
Septimus was preparing his surprise with all the dramatic effects
and an audience into the bargain. He would relish his little
triumph, but Ricardo would have bet a large slice of his fortune
that not a glimpse would Crottle give to either of his heirs of the
misery and torture which he had endured at Arkwright's farm.</p>

<p>"Come," said Septimus, and he led the way into a passage at the
side of the main office.</p>

<p>"The first door's my room," he said, stopping before it. "The
next door is theirs. You'll be able, in their room, Monsieur
Hanaud, to select your cabin to Cherbourg."</p>

<p>He looked about him to make sure that his audience was complete,
and then gently opened the door and stepped inside. The two nephews
were seated opposite to each other at a big leather-padded table,
George with his back to the door and James with his face to it. But
his face was bent upon his papers and George did not turn.</p>

<p>"I didn't ring," said James without looking up. "Mr. George
objected very properly to the noise."</p>

<p>"No doubt my welcome home was a little obstreperous," said
Septimus, and at the sound of his voice James dropped his papers
and sprang to his feet. He was white as a sheet.</p>

<p>"George," he cried sharply. For George had no risen, had not
even turned his head, so engrossed was he upon his work.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, looking up towards James. But the
attitude and the pallor of his stepbrother's face startled him. He
came out of a dream, a dream of ships and cargoes. "What is it?" he
began, and he turn round with a perplexity so marked upon his face
that he seemed hardly yet aware of any new big crisis in the
affairs of the Dagger Line. But now he saw Septimus standing two
feet from him. He reeled back against the desk. His voice rang out
in a cry of delight, his face beamed, and if he didn't hold out his
hands it was because they clutched the edge of the table behind him
to hold him up.</p>

<p>"You, sir! At last! Thank Heaven! We've wanted you!"</p>

<p>"And my room, too," said Crottle drily&mdash;a reply which, to
Mr. Ricardo, lowered the whole dignity of this welcome home.</p>

<p>"Well, we had to find our way, sir, through so many
complications which you naturally had kept under your own control,"
George explained apologetically. "You have been away a long
time."</p>

<p>"A fortnight," answered Septimus.</p>

<p>"A fortnight, yes," said George. "A long time, sir, for the
Dagger Line with a jury-rigged rudder," and he laughed and made a
little bow. "We were afraid," he explained again, "that something
had happened to you. You were staying...?"</p>

<p>And Septimus took him up in the same cordial tone.</p>

<p>"At Arkwright's Farm. A few miles from Sedgemoor."</p>

<p>"Sedgemoor?" George repeated with hardly a stammer, and
"Sedgemoor," James Crottle repeated again, idiotically. "Why,
that's where...</p>

<p>"Yes, where Monmouth was defeated, wasn't it?" added George.</p>

<p>Septimus nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I think we might read about it on a Sunday evening. It would
make kindlier reading than the history of the Dauphin of
France."</p>

<p>"My word, yes," said George Crottle heartily, and Septimus took
a step forward.</p>

<p>"By the way," he asked easily, "do either of you remember that
we employed a man named Barnish on one of our ships? "&mdash;and at
Ricardo's side even Hanaud jumped a little.</p>

<p>James Crottle was obviously troubled, but less by the name,
Ricardo would have said, than by the oddity of the question.</p>

<p>"Barnish?" James echoed, and again "Barnish?" but on different
inflexions.</p>

<p>"Frank Barnish," Septimus repeated and, as George Crottle shook
his head, he turned and drew Maltby into the room. "But it doesn't
matter. This is Superintendent Maltby of Scotland Yard," he
explained. "The Superintendent will see if the staff can turn up
his name," and with a pleasant nod he dismissed the Superintendent
upon this business. Then, as though he had just noticed Hanaud and
Ricardo for the first time, he called them forward.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hanaud and Mr. Ricardo, you do know. Monsieur Hanaud
pays us the compliment of wishing to return to Paris via Cherbourg
on one of our ships. If you," and he looked towards Hanaud and
Ricardo, "will go into the office which my nephews use as a rule,
Jenkins will see what he can do for you."</p>

<p>He waved his hand to the head clerk, who was standing just
within the doorway, and then unlatched a communicating door between
his office and that of the nephews.</p>

<p>George moved forward.</p>

<p>"I had better see that they are comfortable..." he began, but
Septimus interrupted him with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, they will only have a minute or so to wait. Jenkins will go
along to them. It's obvious from what you said when I first came in
that we have a bit of work to do, and the sooner we confer about
it, the quicker we'll get it done."</p>

<p>He opened the connecting-door and invited Hanaud and his friend
to enter. He shut the door behind them and, seeing that Jenkins had
already gone and closed the door upon the passage, he drew up a
chair to their table.</p>

<p>"Now let's put our three heads together," he cried, relaxing
into some sort of gaiety. Indeed, neither of his two nephews could
ever have seen the old man in a more genial mood.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>There were two tables in this second room. Into a chair by the
nearest Hanaud dropped, exhausted with admiration.</p>

<p>"But he is superb," he cried, "absolutely superb! And it was
shattering, mind you, all of it quite shattering. But none the
less, he was superb!" and, putting the tips of his fingers to his
lips, Hanaud blew a fervent kiss to so glorious a comedian.</p>

<p>Julius Ricardo was inclined to think the applause a little too
French and explosive, but he realised that some tribute from
himself was due. So he said: "Yes, he was remarkable, especially
after those dreadful days he must have spent at Arkwright's Farm,"
and he did not notice the open-mouthed stupefaction with which
Hanaud received the comment.</p>

<p>It was natural indeed that he should not. For Hanaud was already
engaged in a kind of visual catalogue of the room's contents. A big
single knee-hole table for James, another like it for George, a
filing cabinet, a bookcase in which some Admiralty Guides kept
company with some naval almanachs, some chairs, a shelf against the
wall, on which stood a chronometer in a mahogany box and&mdash;just
what Hanaud was looking for.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he, and he was out of his chair and across the room
with that light, swift step, which, after all these years, Ricardo
could never quite reconcile with his cumbrous build. Behind the
chronometer, on the shelf, was a roll of big charts. And suddenly
Ricardo was aware that Hanaud had a pair of fine india-rubber
gloves upon his hands. But when he had slipped them on, he had not
one idea.</p>

<p>Hanaud lifted the charts carefully from the shelf and brought
them over to the table.</p>

<p>"Listen for Jenkins in the passage," he said, "but he'll give us
time."</p>

<p>Hanaud unrolled the charts and they sprang back into a roll.</p>

<p>"There are some paper weights."</p>

<p>He nodded to two which he had pushed aside&mdash;heavy things of
bronze and malachite. Under Hanaud's direction, Ricardo placed
them, one at each corner of the lower end of the charts. He
unrolled the charts again from the bottom and held them flat. The
one uppermost was a big chart of the English Channel. He let it
slip from his fingers and it rolled itself again down to the paper
weights. The next one was of the Indian Ocean, and the third of the
Mediterranean Sea, and the fourth of the Great Barrier Reef on the
coast of Australia. They were in no sort of order at all, and from
the clean look of them and the speed with which each one rolled,
itself up the moment it was released, it looked as if they had not
been examined for many a day.</p>

<p>Hanaud looked at, and let go, seven of them quickly and then
stopped with a little cry. From the side of the last sheet, so
quick to hide its secrets, the corner of another paper was sticking
out&mdash;and, of course, just a that moment Jenkins must knock
upon the passage door.</p>

<p>Hanaud swore, and not his favourite polysyllabic oath: "Will you
stand in front of the table, please, friend?"</p>

<p>He ran to the door and opened it. But he planted himself in the
doorway and thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"You can arrange for me? So! That is good. The Formosa. On the
Friday, to be sure."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo, with some surprise, heard Hanaud making his plans,
but it was altogether a surprising day for Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Then you will make out for me a ticket and I pick him up at the
desk as I go out. Yes? I thank you. You are the kindness itself."
He closed the door upon Jenkins. "And please to keep the snotty
nose out of this room for the future."</p>

<p>"Really, really," said Ricardo, who disliked such phrases.
Monsieur Hanaud, on the other hand, was radiant because he had used
this one so appositely.</p>

<p>"It is not a pleasant word?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is not," said Mr. Ricardo with severity.</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded his head vigorously once or twice.</p>

<p>"I thought so. It was used upon me once in my early days by an
English chauffeur who thought I was examining too inquisitively the
interior of his good lady's motor-car. However, work, not
words&mdash;how often do our good statesmen tell us so!"</p>

<p>Hanaud was again at the table. He uncurled the seventh map and
there, lying upon the centre of it was a much smaller chart with,
here and there, pin-points marked upon it.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" he asked in a low voice. "Do you see the corners
where it has been stretched out and fixed by drawing-pins to a
board?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ricardo. "I do."</p>

<p>It was a small chart of the western seaboard of Europe; the
southern coastline of Spain, Gibraltar, Portugal, the Bay of Biscay
and the English Channel.</p>

<p>"Look where the pins were set. Cadiz first, then round on the
west at Lisbon, next up at Vigo. El Rey had landed her undesirables
in Spain and Portugal. Then straight across the Bay to Brest, where
she discharges her French load. Then across to the Start, just
after she made her number. Do you remember Foster, Horbury's clerk?
On the afternoon of the night when he died, Horbury, reading in the
Evening Standard that El Rey had made her number at Lloyd's station
at Prawle Point at six in the morning, stuck in his little black
pin with the white top there, at the Start lighthouse, just by, and
chanced a final one opposite to Selsea Bill&mdash;see?&mdash;which
he reckoned El Rey to have reached just at that moment."</p>

<p>"El Rey?" exclaimed Mr. Ricardo, staring at the map. He
remembered very clearly that rusty old iron boat in the dim of the
morning floundering amidst a welter of white foam at the end of the
bowsprit of Agamemnon.</p>

<p>"And here, just beyond Start Point, you picked up the passenger
with the black rim round his ankle."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Devisher," he cried.</p>

<p>"Bryan Devisher," Hanaud agreed. "At last we know," Ricardo
exclaimed, "the murderer of Daniel Horbury."</p>

<p>Hanaud choked suddenly and swallowed and came to himself. He
made a low bow.</p>

<p>"As your proverb says. The costumier is alway right."</p>

<p>But Hanaud had not yet finished with the chart. Whilst talking
to Jenkins he had slipped off a glove in his pocket, and he began
to press the ungloved fingers of that hand upon the chart.</p>

<p>"Now yours, please!"</p>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo hesitated, wondering whether or no he was condoning
or implicating himself in some great crime. But Hanaud seized his
hand and dabbed it down upon the paper in one place and in
another.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, and he began to roll up the charts again with
great care. "They must look just as they did."</p>

<p>"They?" said Mr. Ricardo in a hushed voice. "Yes. But what have
we done?"</p>

<p>Hanaud carried the roll back to the shelf and meticulously
replaced it behind the chronometer.</p>

<p>"We?" he asked. "Why, we have left our evidence quite beyond all
challenge that we saw the Horbury's chart with the pin-pricks,
slipped, as we expected to find it, in a sheaf of other charts in
the office of the younger Mr. Crottles."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo stepped back.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he whispered.</p>

<p>He was in a maze. He was also conscious, proudly conscious, that
the presentiment which had so stirred him at Lezardrieux was true.
He was engaged in the elucidation of a great and mysterious
crime.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said again.</p>

<p>He looked at the door which communicated with the office of
Septimus Crottle. He pointed towards it.</p>

<p>"You did not expect that you would be interrupted from that
room?"</p>

<p>"No," Hanaud answered. "I thought that Mr. Septimus would
prevent it."</p>

<p>So this was the explanation of those secret conferences before
luncheon at the corner house. It was reckoned a possibility,
perhaps more than a possibility, that the small chart which had
disappeared from White Barn on the night of Horbury's death might
be found in a roll of charts in one particular office of the Line.
It had been arranged that Hanaud should have time to search for
it.</p>

<p>"It was one of the nephews, then," said Ricardo in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Hanaud did not pretend to misunderstand him.</p>

<p>"Which?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why not both?" asked Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Hanaud echoed.</p>

<p>"We must find out," Ricardo urged.</p>

<p>"I think we shall to-night," replied Hanaud. "Now we ought to
say that the ticket is arranged."</p>

<p>He went to the communicating door and knocked upon it and
entered. Septimus was seated at the head of the table discussing
genially with his young partners the affairs of the Line. Was it
possible that those two young men, or one of them, had murdered
Horbury and planned the sequestration of Septimus, and that
Septimus knew of it at this moment? Ricardo could hardly believe
it.</p>

<p>"It is fixed?" cried Septimus. "We carry the great detective to
Cherbourg, do we?"</p>

<p>Septimus is untrue to Septimus, Mr. Ricardo reflected. There's
something in it. Aloud, Septimus continued: "That is good news to
compensate for our bad news."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Hanaud replied. "My sincere regrets. It is not, I hope,
serious."</p>

<p>Septimus was obviously not overwhelmed. "Not very serious, but
troublesome, as all new arrangements are. Preedy has left us."</p>

<p>The statement took both Hanaud and Ricardo by surprise. Preedy?
It was almost an effort to remember him. Of such small importance
had he seemed to be in the great affairs of the Line.</p>

<p>"Why has he gone, Mr. Crottle?" Ricardo asked, and, with a touch
of malice in his tone, Septimus answered:</p>

<p>"He saw the red light."</p>

<p>Both George and James ducked their heads a little over their
papers.</p>

<p>"He is in trouble with his lungs. He is leaving&mdash;I think,
George, that you said he had left&mdash;for Switzerland, and will
be away for two years."</p>

<p>"That is unfortunate," said Hanaud, and Septimus agreed.</p>

<p>"Preedy was a very useful ally. These Barnishes, for instance.
It looks as if they had got away. But Preedy would have laid his
hands upon them. Well, it can't be helped! I shall see you at my
house to-night;" and with a wave of his hand Septimus dismissed
them.</p>

<p>Ricardo had entered the corridor by the second door. He saw
Hanaud emerge from Septimus's room, close the door, and lean
against it.</p>

<p>"Preedy! I never gave a thought to him!" he muttered, his mind
disturbed. "Should I have? For what reason?"</p>

<p>Although he only communed with himself, his last question
reached Ricardo's ears and he answered it: "Preedy had a special
gift."</p>

<p>Hanaud answered: "Yes, to be sure."</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the corridor to the main office.
Ricardo had, in fact, answered Hanaud's question better than either
of them knew.</p>

<p>At the counter in the outmost office Hanaud asked for and
received his ticket by the SS <i>Formosa</i> to Cherbourg. And that again
stirred Mr. Ricardo indescribably. Hanaud, who hated the sea, who
never travelled to England except by the shortest passage between
Calais and Dover, meant actually to sail on an ocean-going
steamship to Cherbourg. Oh, certainly Mr. Ricardo was in the way of
great events.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap28" id="chap28"><small>CHAPTER 28</small></a><br>
<br>
HANAUD BORROWS ROLLS ROYCE NO. 2</h2>

<p class="first">Septimus arrived in a small car, with a constable
on the seat by the side of the driver, at the corner house half an
hour after Hanaud and Ricardo. Maltby had sent the car for him, and
it was as well, Ricardo reflected. For it was no longer the
Septimus whom anger had inspired to establish his old authority and
sow confusion amongst his partners. He was tired; the fire had gone
from him; he was that haggard and humbled man on the bench above
the Fairmile.</p>

<p>"Maltby told me that he would be here," he complained in a weak,
querulous voice, as he was shown by Thompson into the library.</p>

<p>"A cup of tea, sir," Ricardo suggested, and the old man had
hardly raised the cup to his lips before Maltby hurried in.</p>

<p>"I have some news," he said as Ricardo handed a cup to him.</p>

<p>"Good?" Hanaud asked.</p>

<p>"It fits in."</p>

<p>He leaned forwards to Septimus.</p>

<p>"Frank Barnish was the bo'sun of your first oil-driven
ship."</p>

<p>"The Acropolis. Was he?" exclaimed Septimus with a sudden smile.
But the smile was for that adventure in new ships rather than for
her bo'sun.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He gave trouble, drank too much, resented orders,
and, once the voyage was over, was not signed on again. It was a
grievance which he didn't forget. He had the reputation of being a
revengeful fellow although a capable seaman, never held up a job
for long. It must have been a blessing for him when he was put in
to Arkwright's Farm."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have been a long job, either," said Septimus.
"More than that, it wasn't meant to be a long job."</p>

<p>And he sat for a moment or two shaking. He was back in that
shuttered room at Arkwright's.</p>

<p>"Come, sir, that's all over," Maltby declared. "We are looking
after you now."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Septimus cried eagerly, and he caught Maltby by the
arm. "I have great confidence in you, Maltby. You were to give me
some instructions, I think."</p>

<p>He asked for them rather pitifully.</p>

<p>"I think you should go home, sir. There is a constable in the
front of your car. There will be another outside your house. I
shall be obliged if you will refuse to discuss your absence at all,
but just take everything easily. If you will leave it all to us, we
will keep in touch with you."</p>

<p>Words&mdash;and words which meant nothing at all&mdash;but they
satisfied Septimus. He rose from his chair with some difficulty and
went, downstairs on Maltby's arm. Ricardo, at the window, watched
the car drive away in the darkness. In old age, he thought, how
swift the change can be from great authority to exhaustion and how
permanent! It was the horror which Septimus had suffered that
filled his mind now, no longer the audacity of the crime nor its
authors. Maltby spoke at his shoulder in attune with his
thoughts:</p>

<p>"It's a new family that the old gentleman will find in Portman
Square. One of the daughters ran out, did she? Well they've all run
out now. New clothes, a theatre or two, friends to entertain. A
little cruel it sounds, perhaps. But after those years of
submission and boredom and orders and what not, to be expected,
what? Pretty natural. I don't think he'll round them up again.
Patriarchs don't go down in the twentieth century. Or do they?"</p>

<p>"And Miss Agatha?" Hanaud asked suddenly from the room behind
them. But Maltby merely shrugged his shoulders in surprise. He had
no answer to that question; and now that Septimus had been packed
off home, he was anxious and hurried. Hanaud pointed to the
chairs.</p>

<p>"In a dry we finish everything."</p>

<p>Maltby was puzzled but took a seat.</p>

<p>"He means in a sec," Ricardo explained, and took another. Maltby
nodded and turned to Hanaud.</p>

<p>"So you have found something?"</p>

<p>"That chart."</p>

<p>Maltby sat back in his chair.</p>

<p>"The chart with the black pins which Horbury brought from his
office to White Barn on Thursday, August the twenty-sixth."</p>

<p>"And which Devisher took away?" said Maltby.</p>

<p>"But he didn't take it away," cried Hanaud. "We found it this
afternoon slipped into a great roll of charts in the office of the
young Crottles."</p>

<p>"You are sure?" Maltby exclaimed. He was more astounded, more
troubled than Ricardo expected.</p>

<p>"So you see. The affair of Horbury and the affair of
Crottle&mdash;they are one."</p>

<p>It was Hanaud's old point once more enforced upon unwilling
ears.</p>

<p>"There is the vanishing of Devisher, too," Hanaud continued,
ticking off the points on his fingers.</p>

<p>"Still..." Maltby doubted</p>

<p>"The man without money and without friends. There is his
reappearance, besides."</p>

<p>"I know, but.."</p>

<p>"There is the telephone which was lifted and replaced. There is
the blotting-book. There is the door which was locked."</p>

<p>Hanaud was rushing back through the events of that night of
death, Thursday, August the twenty-sixth.</p>

<p>Still Maltby was not convinced, though what course, Hanaud was
urging upon him, Ricardo could not tell.</p>

<p>"And there was another night. Oh, if you had been there you
would not doubt&mdash;when, in a deep silence, a sigh was
breathed."</p>

<p>Maltby stared between his knees at the carpet. "There is not
enough," he said, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Not when we add to-day the finding of the chart?" Maltby rose
ponderously to his feet, whilst Hanaud watched his every movement
with hopeful, eager eyes. "We must be quick," he said. Maltby
nodded his great head.</p>

<p>"This is our one night. After the old man's appearance at his
office, to-night there will be action," Hanaud argued.</p>

<p>Maltby flung back his head and swore. "If only we had the
Barnishes!" he cried.</p>

<p>"The Barnishes!" cried Hanaud in almost a scream of disdain.
"They are nothing."</p>

<p>Maltby frowned gloomily at the Frenchman. A man who had to
decide between peace and war might look like that. So might a youth
who had to choose between a blonde and a brunette. He heaved a
great sigh. He made a great resolve&mdash;to hesitate again.</p>

<p>"I must go to the Yard," he said, and as disappointment deepened
on Hanaud's face: "I shall make all the arrangements,
however&mdash;you know." He nodded portentously. "And I shall come
back. Let me see!"</p>

<p>Ricardo interrupted.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Hanaud, you are dining with Septimus. He said so
in his office."</p>

<p>Hanaud swept the interruption away.</p>

<p>"Comedy, my dear friend. The false invitation which leaves me
free. It was arranged."</p>

<p>"I shall come back with full authority," said Maltby, his breast
swelling, "but..." and he relapsed again into doubt. "A little
before eight, then. That will give us time&mdash;if we move," he
said, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will dine here?" said Mr. Ricardo, and Hanaud
took him up at once.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we will dine! But not the big dinner, no. Some hors
d'oeuvres perhaps, the joint, the sweet, the coffee. Admirable."</p>

<p>"Really, really." Mr. Ricardo addressed dumbly the vacant air.
"Do I keep the inn, The Policemen's Rest?"</p>

<p>But Maltby was clattering down the stairs, and Hanaud was urging
him to hurry. Hanaud came back to the library and dropped into a
chair, limp and dejected.</p>

<p>"It is but and but and but with that man!" he exclaimed moodily.
"He will never&mdash;no, never&mdash;come up and be scratched."</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Ricardo was still contemplating himself as the
appointed innkeeper to the police, who shall say? He cried
indignantly, for he had the strongest possible views upon this
necessity of the times: "I bet you he has been vaccinated over and
over again."</p>

<p>Hanaud stared at him.</p>

<p>"The vaccination? You talk of this at this hour!" He danced in a
rage about the room and suddenly slipped, tame as a cat, to
Ricardo's side. "It is not yet six of the clock, no. And at the
moment when I most need his friendship, I gibe. Yes, I gibe
fatally!" Smooth, soft words, and the voice so remorseful, so
tender.</p>

<p>"What do you want now?" Ricardo asked laughing&mdash;though he
did not wish to laugh.</p>

<p>"The Rolls Royce."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Not the Rolls Royce No. 1. No, no, my friend! I ask for no such
enormity. But the Rolls Royce No. 2. the wee, wee one."</p>

<p>He smiled like a child asking for his father's second gold watch
and confident that he would get it.</p>

<p>"I have no wee, wee car," Mr. Ricardo said firmly. But it was
clear to him that Hanaud was passionately anxious to go somewhere.
After all, he wanted help.</p>

<p>"I doubt if I shall have a chauffeur waiting," he objected. "I
have given no orders."</p>

<p>"A chauffeur!" cried Hanaud, and he thumped his chest. "I,
Hanaud, I am the best chauffeur in Europe."</p>

<p>There was no answer to this statement, except the most direct of
negatives; and Ricardo had no authority to make it.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said.</p>

<p>He led Hanaud to the back of the house and to the garage in the
Mews. He threw open the doors whilst Hanaud climbed into the
car.</p>

<p>"You go to Scotland Yard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Hanaud, fiddling with the instruments.</p>

<p>"And you will drive on the wrong side of the road?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Ricardo stood at the side and saw Rolls Royce No. 2 dash out
into the street, scatter a handful of people in the roadway and
disappear.</p>

<p>"It may be that he is the best driver in Europe, but there are no
signs of it," he said to himself. However, what did it matter, even
if Rolls Royce No. 2 became a scrap heap? Agitations were here. The
world was bubbling. Great criminals sitting at their ease would
feel the handcuffs on their wrists. If only Maltby had the courage.

<p>"But, but..." Mr. Ricardo could take it to his soul with pride that
he had never said "But but..." when Rolls Royce No. 2 had been
commandeered. He had let it go to a man who must drive on the wrong
side of the road, if he was to survive.</p>

<p>Ricardo shut the garage door and returned to the front of his
house. He ordered the short dinner which Hanaud demanded. It was to
be on the table at eight, with the Burgundy&mdash;say the Musigny,
a lighter wine and more fit to precede a nocturnal expedition.
Coffee to follow and perhaps a glass of Armagnac. He did not want
fingers to tremble on the trigger of a pistol. Mr. Ricardo waited.
The clocks chimed&mdash;the hour of seven, the half hour which
followed; and Hanaud tumbled into the room, his dress dishevelled,
his face dirty, his hands scratched and bleeding, yet with so proud
a look of conquest in his face that Mr. Ricardo thought of Napoleon
at Marengo, and, being English, of Wellington on the mountain of
Bussaco. His eyes sparkled, his arms were spread out in an ecstasy.
But Ricardo noticed, above all, the lines of dirt upon his face,
the torn collar, blood upon the knuckles, the dust upon the
clothes.</p>

<p>"You have had a smash!" he cried.</p>

<p>"No, I am not hurt," Hanaud answered, "but I thank you for the
thought." It was not for him to recognise that Ricardo's thought
was for Rolls Royce No. 2. "It was nothing. Just once I was on the
right side of the road and I meet a taxicab. But I was
quick&mdash;oh, I surprise myself. The driver he threw a name at
me&mdash;the name&mdash;not nice. I forgive him with a wave of the
hand, and I drove on. I keep on the wrong side of the road
carefully, and Rolls Royce No. 2, she has the right to be proud.
Look, it is seven-thirty. We have a quarter of an hour before
Maltby arrives."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ricardo eagerly. He was to hear, no doubt, the story
of Rolls Royce No. 2's adventures, "Over a glass of Porto, you
shall..." But he got no further.</p>

<p>"But first the wash!" Hanaud exclaimed "I disgust myself. I
change the clothes. But not the smoking. Nor for you, my friend. It
will not be. But&mdash;but Maltby, but Maltby, winner of the Derby
Round. You shall, see! To-night we prowl!"</p>

<p>Hanaud was half-way up the stairs to his bedroom before he had
finished talking. Ricardo delayed following his example for just
the time it took to order Royce No. 1 to be ready at the door by
half-past eight.</p>

<p>Washed and dressed in inconspicuous clothes, the two men
descended into the study with five minutes to spare before the time
of Maltby's arrival.</p>

<p>"A Porto," Ricardo cried gaily as he filled Hanaud's glass. "For
me the Manzanilla!"</p>

<p>There was just time, he reflected, for him to hear the story of
his friend's adventures and the reason for all his excitement.</p>

<p>"There's something I want to tell you very much," said Hanaud,
as he lit a cigarette and sipped his Porto.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would wish it!" cried Ricardo. "Such old compères as
we are," and with a most unusual gesture he clinked his glass
against Hanaud's. But, alas! he was to be disappointed.</p>

<p>"There was much misunderstanding. I was hurt. 'He makes a jest
of me,' I said, whereas Maltby explained that his mistake was to
imagine that I understood English which, as you know, I do."</p>

<p>Ricardo sank back. He was to be told, after all, nothing more
than the tale of some ridiculous squabble which he and Maltby had
in olden days. He could have groaned.</p>

<p>"But the first day, when I came on Gravot's account and dined
with Maltby in Soho, all was put right."</p>

<p>"So you told me," Ricardo answered acidly. And he had lent the
man his Rolls Royce, too!</p>

<p>"But I did not tell you the story of the misunderstanding."
Hanaud leaned forward smiling, so urgently did he feel that he must
tell it.</p>

<p>"Fire away," said Ricardo with resignation. "I'm here to be
shot."</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said to himself, "I'm not audience enough for
the real thing. He wants Maltby and myself to be paralysed
together."</p>

<p>Hanaud fired away accordingly.</p>

<p>"There was a dead Frenchman in Golden Square with a bottle
beside him.."</p>

<p>That was as far as he got in this never-to-be-told story, when
the door was opened and Maltby announced.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap29" id="chap29"><small>CHAPTER 29</small></a><br>
<br>
THE LETTER TO SEPTIMUS</h2>

<p class="first">They stood about the fireplace, Ricardo upon one
side, Maltby on the other, and Hanaud, serene, masterful, in the
middle. The Manzanilla and the Port were forgotten. It was the
scene of three men, Ricardo realised; the inevitable great scene of
the plays of Sardou; and this one stage-managed&mdash;produced was
the modern word, wasn't it?&mdash;by Hanaud, chief dramatist of the
Sureté Française.</p>

<p>"I have a present for you," said Hanaud, smiling.</p>

<p>"There is only one present," Maltby grumbled.</p>

<p>"And here it is," said Hanaud. Slowly he brought out from the
inner pocket of his jacket an oilskin wrapper fastened with a
button, He offered it to Maltby with a bow. For a moment Maltby
stared at it. Then he raised his eyes to Hanaud's face. Then he
pounced upon the present. He carried it to a small table farther
back from the fire, and the group of three was formed again about
it.</p>

<p>Maltby unbuttoned the wrapper and took from it a folder of
morocco leather, which might hold perhaps a button-hook, a
penknife, a nail file, a pair of tweezers, such as a woman
travelling light might take in her suit case. This he unwrapped and
disclosed, folded length wise on the washleather lining, a letter
in an envelope, so folded that the seal was not cracked.</p>

<p>With a little cry Maltby tossed the morocco case aside and
flattened the letter upon the table under the palm of his hand. It
seemed that he was afraid to reveal even to himself the name of him
to whom the letter was written, so long he looked from one face to
another, so firmly he held the envelope flat upon the table. At
last lie lifted up his hand sharply and there was the name for all
three of them to read 'Septimus Crottle, Esq.,' and the address in
Portman Square.</p>

<p>On a writing-table by the window a tortoiseshell paper-knife
with a silver handle was gleaming. Maltby fetched it and pulled up
a chair.</p>

<p>"Let us see where we are." he said, tapping the letter with the
tortoiseshell blade. "This is presumably the letter which Horbury
took away from his office on the afternoon of Thursday, August the
twenty-sixth."</p>

<p>"With the chart," cried Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yes," Maltby agreed.</p>

<p>"Which we found this afternoon in the office of the younger
Crottles." said Hanaud.</p>

<p>Again Maltby agreed. He took the paperknife and slit the top of
the envelope.</p>

<p>"It ought to have gone to Mr. Septimus before I opened it," 'he
said remorsefully.</p>

<p>"But since you have opened it," Hanaud suggested, and he had no
twinges of conscience.</p>

<p>"We might as well read&mdash;" said Maltby doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What that old rogue Daniel Horbury had to say to him. Yes,
yes!" cried Hanaud, and he turned to Ricardo. "You agree, my
friend? To be sure. Yes."</p>

<p>"I think," said Ricardo, "that you are the most lawless person
in the world. Still, I agree."</p>

<p>And Maltby, with his forefinger and his thumb, slipped out of
the envelope a letter with two enclosures folded within it. He
flattened his hand upon the enclosures as they dropped on to the
table.</p>

<p>"Horbury's letter first, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Hanaud, and though he sat upright at the table,
his feet were dancing with impatience upon the carpet.</p>

<p>Maltby read it through without the omission of a word. It was
written in Horbury's dutiful style. He was a public man and a
Member of Parliament. His first thought was that his obligations
demanded in no uncertain manner that he should communicate the
enclosures at once to the Crown Prosecutor for such action as he
deemed fit. On the other hand, he could not shut his eyes to the
high prestige of the Dagger Line and its importance as a commercial
asset to the country. On the whole, then, he had determined, though
with some heavy doubts, that the patriotic thing to do was send the
two documents straight to Mr. Septimus Crottle as Chairman of the
Line, and leave them in his hand. He remained Mr. Crottle's
obedient servant.</p>

<p>"Send them straight, to be sure," said Maltby with grunt. "So he
keeps them in the secret drawer of his desk. The damned old
blackmailer!"</p>

<p>He dropped the letter with disgust upon the table and took up
the two enclosures. As he read them his face grew very grave, and
he nodded his head twice or three times to Hanaud.</p>

<p>"Yes, these are enough," he said.</p>

<p>The first was a receipt for three thousand pounds made out to
Kapitän von Kluckner, Military Attaché, and signed George Crottle.
The second was an undertaking that SS <i>Harold</i>, a freight carrier of
the Dagger Line, would call at a certain port in the Adriatic Sea
and take on board two hundred kilogrammes of hashish and five
hundred grammes of heroin from Sofia for Egypt.</p>

<p>And this undertaking, too, was addressed to Kapitän von Kluckner
and signed by George Crottle.</p>

<p>Of the three, Ricardo alone was plunged in confusion George?
George Crottle, drug-runner in the pay of a foreign Embassy? The
kidnapper, then, of old Septimus? George, with his charm and his
slim figure and his bright fair hair. It was not possible! But
Hanaud and Maltby kept exchanging glances as though they met at
last on friendly ground. Maltby packed Horbury's letter and
enclosures away in his pocket-book; and Thompson at the door
announced that dinner was served.</p>

<p>It was a meal taken in haste and seasoned with little
conversation. The presence of Thompson prevented all discussion but
that of world affairs, and nobody at the table was for the moment
interested in them. Coffee was served in the dining-room. An
extraordinary habit, Mr. Ricardo reflected, that of drinking black
coffee and liqueurs after meals when obviously there was work
waiting to be done. Cigars were on the way round, too. Then we
shall never get off! A small fellow for Maltby&mdash;that was
sensible. Hanaud only ate his own black cigarettes. Well, he might
as well smoke a small cigar himself and, like Maltby and his
friend, sip this very seductive yellow Chartreuse. Even Mr. Ricardo
realised that there was no need for hurry, and he was inclined to
resent the strokes of a nearby clock. Maltby counted the
strokes.</p>

<p>"Nine," said he.</p>

<p>Hanaud looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Nine," said he.</p>

<p>For both men the search was ended, conclusions had been reached,
action was now to be taken, peace of mind had come. They might be
wrong, but the question was for others to decide, not for them.</p>

<p>Thompson entered.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hughes is in the hall, sir."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hughes!" Ricardo repeated. For some vague reason the
name was familiar.</p>

<p>"We wanted a young man," said Maltby. "I got him moved up to the
Yard."</p>

<p>He remembered now the young officer in uniform who took notes at
White Barn. "Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I liked his cheek," Maltby replied with a grin "Shall we
go?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hughes saluted as the three men descended the
stairs.</p>

<p>"All quiet, Sergeant?</p>

<p>"Up till I left, sir. There's a journey proposed for
to-night."</p>

<p>"So I supposed," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"But," and Sergeant Hughes looked puzzled, "it's a short journey
with no luggage."</p>

<p>"Just as far as White Barn and back," Hanaud suggested, and
Maltby smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, that criminal stays and fights," and Ricardo had reason
afterwards to reflect how wrong these great men could sometimes
be.</p>

<p>A small black police car stood in front of the Rolls Royce.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better give you and Sergeant Hughes a lift? We shall
otherwise leave you behind," said Mr Ricardo grandly.</p>

<p>Hanaud sniggered&mdash;a malicious snigger. Maltby answered.</p>

<p>"We don't look much to be sure, by the side of your elephant,
Mr. Ricardo. But we can go&mdash;I don't say faster than the wind,
for the wind's quite out of date as a comparison, but faster than
an empty army lorry in a crowded street;" and he doubled himself up
into the black car with Sergeant Hughes, whilst Hanaud and Ricardo
climbed into the elephant. There was a man in plain clothes by the
driver and no address was given. The cars started, kept their
distance like ships in line ahead, and they did, to Hanaud's
delight, pass an empty army lorry in the Brompton Road.</p>

<p>In a quieter road the cars stopped; and as the occupants
alighted, a uniformed constable saluted Maltby and spoke a few
words to him. Maltby beckoned to the rest of his party and went
forward. On the right-hand side of the road a crescent of small and
attractive Regency houses curved about a garden. The houses were
lit up for the most part and the blinds drawn. But in front of one
of them a small car stood with its lamps unlit.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cluster of the uniformed police about a
gate which led through the garden to a front-door. The room to the
right of the round white stone arch of the portico was lit. Maltby
walked up to the door and rang the bell. The shrill sound of it
rang through the house, but there was no answer, no movement at all
in that lighted room. Ricardo had in his mind the picture of a man
there suddenly stricken by that bell as by a stroke of paralysis.
There was not a lift of the blind, not the shifting of a chair.</p>

<p>Maltby rang a second time with a louder insistence. From inside
the room a shadow was cast upon the blind. A man stood with the
light behind him. Then he moved somewhere to the back of the room
so that no shadow was any longer shown. Even then a few unnecessary
seconds passed before a door into the passage was opened and steps
approached. The front door was unlatched. There was no light in the
passage except the panel which glowed from the open doorway. The
young man had withdrawn into the darkness behind it.</p>

<p>"My servants are away for the evening. Will you kindly come
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Mr. George Crottle." said Maltby.</p>

<p>"I, too, have an appointment. I shall be obliged..."</p>

<p>"I am Superintendent Maltby. My business won't wait," Maltby
stated.</p>

<p>There followed a few seconds of silence.</p>

<p>"You will make it, please, as short as you can." George Crottle
replied pleasantly. "Will you come in?"</p>

<p>He led the way into a sitting-room, furnished with comfort and
elegance. It was brightly lit and a writing bureau from which the
chair had been thrust back filled a corner of the room. Maltby was
followed by Hanaud, Ricardo and Sergeant Hughes. Crottle, as he
closed the door, saw two uniformed constables in the porch.</p>

<p>"Rather a large escort, Superintendent, haven't you?" he said
coolly. His face was pale, but his voice was composed, and the only
sign of disturbance which he showed was that only now, for the
first time, did he recognise Hanaud and Ricardo.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, nodding at them with a smile; and some
wariness was now audible in his tones. "I the pleasure of meeting
you, I think, in Portman Square. Will you sit down?"</p>

<p>Maltby, in a formal voice, cut across these politenesses. "Mr.
George Crottle, I must ask you some questions. You need not answer
them unless you wish to. But I must warn you that if you do, your
answers will be written down and may be used in evidence."</p>

<p>In fact, Sergeant Hughes had already a large notebook open and a
pencil in his hand.</p>

<p>"You may sit down if you wish," Maltby continued.</p>

<p>"Of course," Crottle answered, but he remained standing.</p>

<p>"You are George Crottle, employed by your uncle, Mr. Septimus
Crottle, in the service of the Dagger Line of steamships?"</p>

<p>"No," cried George Crottle, and it was only now, when all was
relaxed, that those present realised under how much tension George
Crottle had preserved his calm. He had seemed at ease before, he
was at ease now.</p>

<p>"No, no, Superintendent, that won't do. I am a director and a
partner. The old boy was in a fairly black rage when he turned up
this afternoon and found that my stepbrother and myself had annexed
his office. I thought that he would pay us out in some way. But, my
word, it's pretty hot to suggest that I had anything to do with his
disappearance."</p>

<p>George must have been either completely innocent of any share in
the abduction of Septimus, or completely sure that the Barnishes
were safe from the police.</p>

<p>"For I suppose that's what the patriarch has been doing?" he
added. And now he did sit down and took at random a small cigar
from a box on a table at his side, pinched the end and reached out
his left hand for a box of wooden matches lying on a sofa.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Maltby solidly, "we have no charge from Mr.
Septimus. I must ask you what you were doing on the night of
Thursday, August the twenty-sixth?"</p>

<p>George Crottle sat with the match-box still in his extended
hand.</p>

<p>"August the twenty-sixth? That's a long time ago,
Superintendent. I can't remember off-hand. But there's a day-book
on the desk in the corner which might tell us."</p>

<p>He pointed with the matches towards the bureau where he had been
sitting. Maltby turned his head towards it, and during that glance
George Crottle put the cigar between his teeth. Hughes found the
book upon the flat surface of the bureau and flipped back the pages
to the month of August.</p>

<p>"There is no entry on that date."</p>

<p>George Crottle shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was the day before the steamship Sheriff sailed from
Southampton," said Maltby.</p>

<p>Crottle frowned, looked at Maltby as though the answer were to
be discovered in his face, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said between his teeth, "No."</p>

<p>Maltby took a step nearer to him and, taking his letter-case
from his pocket-book, showed to Crottle an empty envelope sealed
with a black seal, but slit open at the top.</p>

<p>"You know this envelope?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen it."</p>

<p>"But you know the handwriting?"</p>

<p>Crottle leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is Daniel Horbury's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>These monosyllables were uttered with a most convincing
perplexity. He closed his hand over the matchbox and with a sly
smile began to draw it to his chest, But whilst his hand was still
moving, Maltby struck his arm with a swift and violent blow and
snatched the matchbox from his hand.</p>

<p>"George Crottle," he said, "I arrest you for the murder of
Daniel Horbury at his house of White barn on the night of the
twenty-sixth of August."</p>

<p>Mr. Ricardo felt the floor turning underneath him. He was
prepared for George Crottle's arrest for the abduction of Septimus,
or for conspiring with the Kapitän von Kluckner, but on a charge of
murder, no. If, however, Mr. Ricardo did not know where he stood,
George Crottle certainly did. With a backward jerk of his head, he
drew the whole length of that small cigar between his teeth. He
crushed it with a snap of his jaws. A tiny tinkle of glass was
heard, for a fraction of a second his face was convulsed with all
the agony of the world, and then he fell dead into the arms of
Maltby and Hughes.</p>

<p>In Crottle's pocket was found a flat black silk cord with a
slip-knot which ran very easily and smoothly; and in a locked
drawer of the bureau a manuscript.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap30" id="chap30"><small>CHAPTER 30</small></a><br>
<br>
STRAWS IN THE WIND</h2>

<p class="first">The manuscript which Maltby found locked in George
Crottle's bureau offered a complete account of the crimes without a
sign of remorse. On the other hand, it was very vain&mdash;youth's
passionate cry for authority over age alternating with youth's
despair at age's authority over youth. He had completed the
inevitable drudgery which precedes mastery in either the arts or
industry, to find himself in the end a cipher in a counting-house.
Septimus Crottle should have handed over the Dagger Line years ago
to nimbler wits and wider views. But he had not: and this is what
had come of his obstinacy&mdash;a perpetual maddening threat which
he was going to get rid of to-night.</p>

<p>"I go out to-night to play my last hand. If I succeed I shall
destroy this manuscript, although its logic might hold a lesson for
students and its narrative another for authors."</p>

<p>The statement cleared up those difficulties which Hanaud and Mr.
Ricardo had been unable to resolve. But it contained disclosures
which affected not merely the high prestige of the Dagger Line, but
the policy of the Realm. It was, therefore, after earnest
consideration, suppressed. George Crottle could not, after all, be
brought to trial, the two Barnishes had disappeared, and, although
Mrs. Horbury was amenable to the law for her secrecy, there was no
certainty that the verdict would condemn her. An inquest was held
in due course, at an early hour, and, coinciding with the proximity
of a general election, provoked little attention. Maltby, however,
had a copy of the manuscript and bade Hanaud and his friend to a
luncheon on the next Sunday at his Cottage at Thames Ditton. They
were bidden to come early so that the manuscript might be read and
finished with before luncheon. Hanaud was able to prolong his
vacancy until Monday, and thus on a Sunday of early autumn the
great Rolls Royce No. 1 rolled down to that pleasant village at
eleven o'clock in the morning. Maltby, in his riverside cottage,
was an amiable host, a trifle too fussy perhaps. He set out a great
jug of ale and glasses on a tablecloth of pink and white squares,
pulled up some comfortable chairs, invited his friends to take
their seats, and took from a drawer a few typewritten sheets of
paper taped into a blue cover.</p>

<p>"Will you read it, sir?" he asked of Ricardo, and Ricardo
responded instantly.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear Maltby. The story is yours, and I want
to listen to it."</p>

<p>There was a noticeable relief in Maltby's voice as he accepted
the task and quickly drawing up a chair to the table he began to
read:</p>

<p>I was dipped. Horses which never won, women who always lost and
cards which never dealt you a house without giving to your
neighbour four of a kind. I didn't know where to turn. There was
only Septimus, and to confide in him meant humiliation which I was
not prepared to endure, even if he were prepared&mdash;a thing I
very much doubted&mdash;to overlook my ill-fortune.</p>

<p>This is some years ago now&mdash;the actual date isn't
necessary. I was crossing the Green Park one lovely day of early
June when a very young voice ordered me to stop. I obeyed at once.
I was in the mood to find an omen in any occurrence, however
trivial. My name was called, 'George! George!' I looked round, only
to be once more disappointed. The call had come out of the air, a
clear bell full of promise. But there rose up from a seat my cousin
Agatha.</p>

<p>"I want you to come with me," she cried in the breathless way
she had&mdash;at all events when she talked with me.</p>

<p>I guessed a church or a picture gallery, but I had hardly the
time to shake my head, when she added: "To the Caledonian
Market."</p>

<p>Could any proposal be more crazy? Yet just for that reason more
appealing. The Caledonian Market, where junk jostled treasures, or
so they say. Of course, I would go, and the blood rushed into her
face when she clutched my arm as I told her so. We stopped a taxi
in the Mall and drove out past Smithfield. I was careful, you'll
understand, not to ask Agatha the reason for her choice. Only fools
analyse inspirations, wise men act on them. There might be
something in those old Arabian stories.</p>

<p>"Suppose I found a bottle with a genius in it!" I said, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I wish you'd always be like this to me," she
answered. Boring? Yes, but Agatha did bore.</p>

<p>In the market it was junk, junk all the way, and imitations
under my feet like mad. No doubt there were pieces of Ming under
the Doulton, but there was no stoppered bottle from the dreams of
Scheherazade, and I couldn't see the Ming. I was feeling deflated
when, looking up from a job lot of culinary articles, I saw a man
whom I knew, Herr Kapitän von Kluckner, the foreign Military
Attaché. I should not probably have paid to him any attention had
he not met my eyes with a frown of displeasure and changed his
quick, purposeful step into the saunter of an idle foreigner,
sneering at the oddities of London. I watched him curiously from a
distance and was still more surprised to see him entering a
barber's shop on the east side of the market.</p>

<p>Now, what in the world induces the elegant Military Attaché to
come up to the Caledonian Market to get himself shaved?" I asked,
and Agatha, for once on the spot, pointed to the name above the
shop, and said: "Do you think that Mr. Straws alters his name and
writes music in his spare time?"</p>

<p>A week or so later I began to meet the Herr Kapitän here and
there at luncheon or at dinner. I suppose that he had his spies
poking their noses and their sharp ears into all sorts of places.
Anyway, at one house, where I had been losing a great deal of
money, he took me aside for a drink and talked. It was absurd that
there should be any enmity between the two countries. In fact, they
could now help each other very considerably without compromising
each other's independence. Each country stood primarily for
itself&mdash;that was clear. But; apart from that clear principle,
there were many smaller opportunities of mutual help. "For
instance..." he began, and broke off as others approached us. He
talked for a few minutes, and then said he must be off, for he had
a busy day in front of him. "I must get myself shaved, today," he
said with a laugh as he smoothed his chin, and away he went. He had
made an appointment with me. That's what it came to I had long
since made up my mind that the barber's shop was a letter-box in
which spies could post their letters. But it was more than that. It
was a house of assignation, and I felt that it was a duty to
discover what the Herr Kapitän was up to.</p>

<p>But he wouldn't know my motive and it was like his impertinence
to expect me. A curtain covered the doorway of Mr. Straws'
establishment. It led into a passage at the side of the shop, and a
man was waiting in the passage. He marched off to the back of the
house without a word and, in a room too mean and undistinguished
for a design so vast, a proposal was made to me. The destruction of
a race. The death of Egypt. Not by shells or bombs or fire but by
subtler weapons. Heroin, cocaine, hashish! Children would not be
born, work would not be done, starvation would follow, and a
decadent people would make place for the legions of the North.</p>

<p>I was dazzled. England would share, of course, and England, in
contributing the Dagger Line, could pull an oar. It was a nightmare
turned into an idea. It was colossal. It was a prairie fire with
its rolling smoke, its roar and its crackle and its glare, eating
up the dead dry grass. I walked out with a good fat cheque in my
pocket and my head up.</p>

<p>It wasn't so difficult. We had freighters as well as passenger
ships. I had served in both the South American and the Eastern
trade, and knew the routine of the ports. We shipped a good deal of
furniture, most of it sound, of course, but, betwixt and between,
pieces which held a fortune. We had help, too. A consul would want
a new consular outfit&mdash;not that he, good man, was ever aware
of it. But the outfit would arrive all right in a fine big trunk
and would be collected on the quay by a dragoman (of sorts) who
could pass his stuff through the Customs without examination.
Sometimes it was a case of books, which never reached the library
of the Minister who didn't expect it. We picked the cargo up in our
small freighters from surprising places. Sofia gave us&mdash;when I
say gave, there was no giving in that trade&mdash;a good deal at
ports in the east of Europe. But, of course, notes had to be
written, commitments acknowledged, receipts sent. The trading bills
were all Sir Garnet, of course. But, keeping pace with those bills,
there were more intimate acknowledgments to be made. My Herr
Kapitän saw to that.</p>

<p>I don't think that I was careless. There was once a letter which
I wrote in Pevensey Crescent and which I thought that I had posted.
I had a new servant just about then. There was another which was
not received, a little too frank about some freight from Sofia
which we were to pick up at Salonika. Those two letters worried me
a little, and I got rid of my servant, thinking that the
carelessness was his. Until one morning a message came over the
telephone from Horbury. It came to Pevensey Crescent. He said that
he had two interesting documents upon which he would be honoured if
I would give him my advice. I was alarmed. I didn't, know Horbury,
but I knew that blackmail was his business, and the fact that I was
comfortably paying off my debts may well have attracted his
attention. But I did know Olivia. I had met her at supper parties
and at dances more than once. I couldn't believe that she had
married that pigeon-toed old beetle for anything but his money. She
was always easy to look at and she had moments of great beauty. I
had nursed an idea that one day, when I had a bit more time, we
might see a good deal more of one another. So I thought that it
might be prudent if I probed her a little before I answered
Daniel.</p>

<p>So I called on her in her ormulu flat in Park Lane that
afternoon. As a rule with women I have been fairly astute. I have
made my approaches with discretion and, on the whole, I have not
been unfortunate. But this time I was out of breath, as it were,
and I rushed my fences.</p>

<p>She was difficult. I stammered a few love passages and she
supplied with a kindly smile the words for which, in my passion, I
was supposed to be at a loss. Disconcerting! I gave her my private
telephone number at the office and I told her that I gave it to
very few, She wrote it down carefully in a little book, saying,
"Harem, I suppose, is the operative word."</p>

<p>I asked her casually whether Daniel had spoken to her about me,
and she replied "Oh, no," as if I were not nearly grown up enough
to interest Daniel. Then she gave me a cup of China tea and a
cucumber sandwich and sent me away. I ought to have left in a rage,
but I felt like a cat. If you say "Puss, puss, puss, lovely
pussie," it just walks away, but if you pull its tail and turn your
back on it, it rubs itself against your legs. I began, in fact, to
ring her up on my private line.</p>

<p>But I had, nevertheless, to make an appointment with Daniel. He
had the receipt and the details of the cargo at Salonika, and there
was no getting round them. Horbury was formal and grave. As a
legislator, he had his duty to do. I must see that. He ought to
send these papers straight to the Public Prosecutor. But he had no
wish to be hard, and if he sent them to Septimus, the harm would be
stopped, and I should escape a long term of penal servitude.</p>

<p>"'Why not say a stretch?" I inquired, foolishly disdainful.</p>

<p>"Because a stretch is only a year, and I couldn't promise you
that," he answered.</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," was his next line, "but happily you can't
sin without payment, or civilisation would be down the drain." Oh,
Daniel Horbury knew his stuff, and I left his office a slave. What
I got from Herr Kapitän Peter I had to pay to Legislator Paul, and
the more the better. But that wasn't the worst of it...</p>

<p>Here Maltby lifted his eyes from his manuscript.</p>

<p>"We can realise, without reading of it, the perpetual terror
which George Crottle endured. So I come at once to his account of
the Thursday night when he obeyed Horbury's summons and paid his
first visit to White Barn."</p>

<p>Hanaud sat forward on the edge of his chair; his perplexities
were to be resolved. Mr. Ricardo saw the gulls swooping and
wheeling over Battersea Bridge on the sunlit morning when he drove
out of London to Lordship Lane. Maltby turned over a couple of
typewritten pages of lamentations and resumed his tale.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap31" id="chap31"><small>CHAPTER 31</small></a><br>
<br>
THE GRIM WORD</h2>

<p class="first">I didn't intend murder. I had played with the grim
word sometimes during the last months, no doubt; and I had the
blue-handled knife. I bought it a long time ago in Uruguay, and,
being at the age when what you want to do you want to do one plus,
I got proficient in throwing it. It had lain in an old box, but I
got it out. Did you ever notice how many commons there are close to
London with small woods on them where you can wander most of the
day and never meet a soul? I had reason to, for I acquired a
greater proficiency than I had ever had. I could pin a strip of
white paper round the trunk of a tree, walk away with my knife in
its sheath within my breast pocket, turn, and it seemed that as I
flashed my hand the white paper split and the knife was quivering
in the bark. I carried it about with me always. But that was not
because I definitely meant to use it, but because the possession of
it, the sense of it against my ribs, made me feel less paltry.</p>

<p>Of course the idea must have been in my mind. I had, in fact,
prepared a hidey-hole for myself in the West Country in case it
should be necessary. But I had never formulated a time or a place
or a definite point of the dialogue which I should reach
before&mdash;before the collar of white paper split. Certainly I
did not on this Thursday evening. For I took Preedy with me. Preedy
was a smart, quick, sedulous small-job attorney who had been very
useful in resisting claims when I was in trouble and in settling
them when I was better off. I had managed, in return, to slip him
into the company's affairs. A few small cases which he handled very
well did his reputation a world of good. He was devoted to me, and
I certainly should not have taken him to White Barn had I
definitely meant to turn the grim word into fact. Indeed, he was so
angry that I had allowed myself to be blackmailed without
consulting him, that I seldom mentioned Horbury to him at all.</p>

<p>There's only one answer to the blackmailer&mdash;no answer. A
lagging, like God's sunlight, hots it up for the blackmailer as
well as the blackmailed, and the blackmailer knows it.</p>

<p>But this particular summons, made, of course, over the telephone
to Pevensey Crescent, hinted at mutual benefits and a settlement.
Preedy wanted to go first and look round before I came. We had
neither of us visited White Barn before, but Horbury had given me
the bearings so accurately that a mistake could hardly be made.
Preedy arrived in his small car a few minutes after half-past nine.
A small garage stood on the left-hand side of the house, but the
door was locked and the little courtyard was empty. A light,
however, was burning in the hall and Preedy, leaving his car on the
right of the yard, rang the bell. The lock, he noticed, was of the
Yale kind. A man who was undoubtedly, to Preedy's thinking,
Horbury, opened the door and silently contemplated a stranger.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Horbury's house?" asked Preedy.</p>

<p>"But there's no fishing," said Daniel, and he began to close the
door.</p>

<p>"George has not arrived?" Preedy asked again quickly.</p>

<p>"No," said Horbury, "but we are expecting the Dragon along at
any moment," and he closed the door a little more.</p>

<p>"I am on the staff of the Dagger Line," Preedy hurried to
explain, "and I am George Crottle's private solicitor."</p>

<p>For a moment Daniel Horbury was disturbed. Then his face cleared
and split with a grin.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," he said heartily, "in George's place I should
have brought my solicitor with me, too. Meanwhile, come in and meet
the wife."</p>

<p>Mr. Alan Preedy looked and looked again, and drew a deep breath.
Olivia laughed and blushed.</p>

<p>"I must apologise, Mrs. Horbury," said Preedy. "For the most
honest compliment I have ever received," and then Preedy says, to
the surprise of them both, he lifted up a finger.</p>

<p>"Crottle's here," he said quietly, and with so much certainty
that, after a moment of stupor, they began to peer into the corners
of the room. Preedy smiled.</p>

<p>"He has just crossed the Turnpike Road into the Lane."</p>

<p>"Has he now?" cried Horbury, suddenly, as he thought, tumbling
to the joke. He listened and nodded "He's wearing shoes with crêpe
soles."</p>

<p>"He's driving an Austin twelve," Preedy corrected, and suddenly
a small car drove into the courtyard a stopped.</p>

<p>"My word!" said Horbury. He saw vistas of high service done for
him by Alan Preedy. The man might hear the most valuable
conversations from impossible distances. "You and I must have a
talk, Mr. Preedy, one of these days," and, as if to emphasise the
wish, the front-door bell rang sharply.</p>

<p>It was I who rang. The season was the season of full moon, and a
silver light, daylight almost without its harshness, made the world
suave and nearly kind. Preedy's car stood to the right of White
Barn, and there was room for me to park mine between his car and
the door.</p>

<p>Horbury came to the front door. He did not offer to shake my
hand, but his voice cooed: "Your first visit to my refuge, Mr.
Crottle? You'll hope, no doubt, that it will be the last." He
opened a cupboard by the side of the front door and I saw his light
brown overcoat hanging on a peg. "What, no overcoat? You boys! Your
friend Preedy's just the same. Wish I could risk it."</p>

<p>"So Preedy's before me?" I said as I hung my hat next to
Horbury's overcoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's talking to Olivia in the garden-room."</p>

<p>I stood, a little startled. "Mrs. Horbury is here, too?"</p>

<p>Horbury nodded his head. "She knows nothing of our little secret
and there'll be no necessity to go into details. But I'm no
chauffeur, and the fewer people who know of our meeting here, the
better. Olivia drove me down. Romantic, eh? Back to the old house
in the suburbs! We shall sleep here to-night after you have gone.
Just the two of us in the empty house. Beautiful!" And he reached
up and snapped the light off in the hall. Horbury's little speech
was steeped in malice and the grin on his face was impish. He stood
very still in the black hall, listening to me breathing and no
doubt savouring it with enjoyment. Playing with fire? No, but with
a long, heavy, blue-handled knife. No doubt it was very
tempting.</p>

<p>"Might I hear what you have to say to me?" I said quietly. "The
nut, after all, can't be expected to enjoy the cracks of the
crackers, even if they are wisecracks."</p>

<p>Horbury threw open the door of the lighted garden room.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, you know Mr. George Crottle, don't you," said
Horbury with a chuckle. "Isn't it a disgrace to me that you thought
of this wonderful name for Olivia before I did?"</p>

<p>He knelt down by the fire and warmed his hands. "Chilly, these
nights," he said as he stood up again. I didn't answer. On the
floor, by the side of a table, a small chart was pinned on a board.
But I wasn't curious about that. I saw Olivia come forward from her
corner. She was dressed in a black gown of satin with a short coat
of white ermine which, as the room grew warm, she had thrown open.
Against the background of fur, the slender white neck and throat
rose from the black gown, too slender, it seemed, for even that
small head with its heavy coronal of hair. She was as delicate to
the eye as china, rose-white, with the velvet of the crimson rose
upon her lips, a creature of health and fire. And I hated her. So
they've made a joke of me! Robbed me and laughed at me. A harlequin
on a string&mdash;that's what I am; and quite slowly I slid my left
hand down the breast of my jacket. The comforting hard feel!
Beautiful? Yes, she was at that moment, with a look of concern upon
her face and question in her eyes. Very likely she knew nothing of
this blackmailing business, knew only that I made love to her and
laughed at me for my pains. I think that I began to hate her at
that moment.</p>

<p>"You go over there, Beautiful," said Horbury, "and smoke a
cigarette whilst I have a word or two with these gentlemen."</p>

<p>Olivia moved away to a cushioned chair at the corner of the
wall. Horbury invited me to a seat on the divan and sat himself on
a chair with its back to the wall and with the little table in
front of him with a blotting-book upon it&mdash;a lady's
blotting-book from a suburban drawing room. Buhl and
mother-of-pearl. Preedy&mdash;you have to take note of him, if you
please&mdash;he found a chair with arms like the chair at Horbury's
table, a good chair of Chinese Chippendale with a seat of crimson
brocade, and moved it a little so that he sat with his back to the
wall on the side of the fireplace opposite to Horbury. Thus all
three, Preedy, Horbury and Olivia, were sitting in a parallel,
facing the garden windows. I alone sat with my back to them. Not
that that mattered, for the blinds were pulled down and the
curtains drawn across them. Horbury, Preedy and I, on the other
hand, made an isosceles triangle, of which I was the apex, Preedy
and Horbury the angles at the base.</p>

<p>Horbury then told us the story of Bryan Devisher, which Preedy,
with his lawyer's eye for facts, condensed into a few
sentences.</p>

<p>"There was a lady with a very rich husband in a very big house
in the Bayswater Road. She loved the graceful Bryan, and he pinched
her pearls, lovely pearls, milk and moonlight. This, remember, was
before the Japs had taught the oyster their barbarous efficiency.
He sold the pearls to a French jeweller. I think he tried the usual
trick of substituting a lump of coal, but it didn't work. Where the
cash went, it is, perhaps, not necessary to state."</p>

<p>"And how do you know all this?" Horbury exclaimed, startled.</p>

<p>"The lady who loved so unwisely brought her secrets to me in the
Gray's Inn Road," Preedy returned.</p>

<p>"And you advised her.."</p>

<p>"To make a clean breast of it to her husband." He smiled
idiotically. "A happy metaphor, what?"</p>

<p>"You mean, you advised her to confess to her husband that she
had loved and been robbed?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Preedy, and I blew a long whistle of derision.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said with dignity, "that I should give the same
correct advice to erring wives on all occasions. But I am bound to
admit that there were special reasons in this case. Devisher had
been spirited away; and although strong suspicions pointed to
certain people, there wasn't actual evidence."</p>

<p>"And she took your advice?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She did. There was the usual uproar. The police were called in.
The husband was going to have a divorce, a resonant, shattering
divorce. Wasn't he just? Then it died down. The pearls came back,
you see. The French jeweller had to give them up, since that's the
law. Then the husband recollected that he had run out of the course
once or twice himself and that he wanted to get into Parliament and
reckoned that it wouldn't help to let the electors see what his
wife thought of him. Finally came an evening when he had a good
dinner, and a successful game of bridge, when his wife looked her
best in her prettiest frock, and we ring down the curtain on a
domestic scene."</p>

<p>"And what has all this to do with me?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Wait, sir, if you please," said Preedy, and then, "Ah!" as
Horbury stooped and picked up the chart from the floor.</p>

<p>Horbury glanced again at Alan Preedy in surprise. "Then you know
of this, too?' he asked, tapping the ebony board.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Hanaud, the French detective, called on me at five-thirty this
afternoon. He came straight from Victoria Station. But continue,
please! My friend's impatient?"</p>

<p>Daniel Horbury described the journey of El Rey. "I marked on
this chart, from Lloyd's reports, the harbours at which the ship
discharged its undesirables. It signalled Prawle Point at six this
morning and will discharge her English batch at Gravesend to-morrow
morning. One of that batch is Bryan Devisher."</p>

<p>He stood up and, laying the flat of his left hand upon the
blotting-book as if he needed its support, took from the
mantelshelf a thin little dark blue book. When he sat down again he
was aware of a change in the room, a tension, a greater depth in
the silence. He looked sharply towards me and saw that my eyes were
fixed with more than a little concern upon Preedy. He had been
sitting up straight and fairly stiff against the wall, but was, now
stiffer than ever and withdrawn into some solitude of his own. His
face was shuttered, his eyes blank, he gave me the impression of
some lonely lighted house in the country which has suddenly gone
black at the distant wail of a warning.</p>

<p>"You weren't listening to me?" cried Horbury roughly.</p>

<p>He obviously liked to be listened to, as a Member of Parliament
should be. Preedy's eyes&mdash;I can't say opened&mdash;for they
were open before, but they lived again and a smile took the
severity from his face and deepened the wrinkles at the corners of
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I was listening," said Preedy. "You are proposing a
deal, I think?"</p>

<p>Horbury leaned back in his chair. "You are quick, Mr.
Preedy."</p>

<p>"We have to be in the Gray's Inn Road." he retorted. "You want a
cabin."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On the Dagger Line."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For Bryan Devisher?"</p>

<p>"As soon as can be."</p>

<p>"Whither?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind as long as it's far away and there's a job for him
at the end of it," said Horbury.</p>

<p>"On the Company's staff?"</p>

<p>"That would be desirable," said Daniel Horbury.</p>

<p>"And what do you offer in return?"</p>

<p>Horbury's replies had been thought out, but they were no quicker
than Preedy's questions, which came rattling on the answers like
the sharp bursts of a machine-gun. Horbury relaxed now, smiling
contentedly. "Ah There we are!" he said.</p>

<p>"Are we?"</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>Daniel had no doubts. If there was no eagerness in Preedy's
face, there was enough of it in mine.</p>

<p>"I propose that a couple of letters which, if I had strictly
regarded my duty to my country, I should have sent to the Public
Prosecutor, but which I have addressed to Mr. Septimus Crottle,
should be handed over for delivery to Mr. George Crottle."</p>

<p>I interrupted here with a good deal too much fervour to please
my solicitor Preedy.</p>

<p>"We have a ship the Sheriff, sailing from Southampton at five
o'clock to-morrow afternoon. We have a cabin or two free. One of
the firm usually goes to Southampton to see the firm's ship off,
and it's my turn to-morrow."</p>

<p>No doubt I was a little too ready to agree. I was indeed ready
to invite the unknown Devisher, to travel in my car to Southampton,
when Preedy objected: "Even so, he'll want a new passport, won't
he?"</p>

<p>Daniel Horbury handed him the small blue book. Preedy turned it
over and opened it.</p>

<p>"The photograph was taken more than six years ago," agreed
Horbury.</p>

<p>"When you sent him gun-running to Venezuela," Preedy replied. He
turned to the page with the photograph and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect that that will get him on board, especially if he
motors with you."</p>

<p>He gave me a nod and a smile. There was, after all, very little
which got by Alan Preedy. But he had, nevertheless, not done with
his difficulties. "But will he go? There's no case against him. The
pearls are back, the wife and husband reconciled."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't know that," said Horbury. "Besides, the
Frenchman's here, you said."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Acting for Gravot of the Place Vendôme."</p>

<p>Again Preedy grinned at Horbury. "I see you know the name all
right. Curious, isn't it?" But Horbury was not the sort of man to
be offended by a little sarcasm. He didn't even blush, and Preedy
continued. "Hanaud says Gravot has cooled down, too. He doesn't
want any extradition. He wants his cash back."</p>

<p>"But Devisher doesn't know that either. Besides, he probably
hasn't got a farthing, and a pleasant cruise on a tip-top liner
with a comfortable easy job at the end of it&mdash;not too bad,"
Horbury explained anxiously. "Further," and he looked down at the
table and added with a hard note in his voice, "he's obnoxious to
me."</p>

<p>Preedy laughed.</p>

<p>"Obnoxious is an excellent word. A dandy of a word. All right!
When you hand over to me the letter to Septimus Crottle..."</p>

<p>"On the quay-side."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Preedy tucked the passport away in his pocket. "You'll go down
by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go in George's car and hand over the passport to
Devisher as you hand the letter to George."</p>

<p>Horbury beamed. "Good!" he cried. He sprang up from his chair
and, still supporting himself with the flat of his left hand, took
a cigar from the mantelshelf and bit off the end.</p>

<p>"The ship is the Sheriff," I said, and I gave the number of the
quay at which she berthed.</p>

<p>Horbury took a pen from his waistcoat pocket, lifted a tiny
corner of the blotting-book and wrote the name Sheriff upon it.
Then he put the pen away in his pocket, lit the cigar and blew a
ring of smoke into the air.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, a man conscious of a rather virtuous day's
work. "Now it's all Sir Garnet."</p>

<p>I suppose that since I have already used it, I got that old
phrase from him. Anyway, he folded his fat arms across his chest
and concentrated on blowing exactly rounded rings of smoke into the
air. I expect that he was wondering why we didn't get up from our
chairs, say "Until to-morrow, by the Sheriff," and take our leave.
I was wondering that, too, but, after all, if you bring a solicitor
with you, you're a mug if you don't use him. I watched Preedy. He
sat stiff and straight against the wall and looked as if he didn't
mean to move until the Day of Judgment. He was puzzled, too, and
annoyed. Finally he seemed to flare up.</p>

<p>"What I don't understand, Mr. Horbury, is why all the flummery?
Why all the pretence? Surely we can fix everything now and have
done with it?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" cried Horbury. "My dear fellow!" and even to
me, Preedy at that moment seemed a daunting figure. He sat up so
inhumanly straight, he spoke with so impersonal a tone, he gazed
with so unwinking a stare across the room. One of the gods or kings
from the Old Nile come back to sit in judgment.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I wouldn't of course bring those letters here,
no, not I!" And the way in which he held tightly pressed against
each other the covers of his blotting-book proved to me that there
was a good deal more than the word 'Sheriff' between the
leaves.</p>

<p>I couldn't help wondering for a moment whether, for all his
effectiveness, I had been wise to bring Preedy. If Horbury and I
had been alone, those infernal letters might already have been in
the fire and an order for a cabin on the Sheriff in Horbury's
pocket. But we were two men against one, and the rules of the game
which we were playing excluded neither violence nor any kind of
treachery.</p>

<p>"They are safely locked away where they can't be found," he
exclaimed with a slobbering sort of laugh, and Preedy cut in across
his words very quietly now.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of your bits of paper," he said.</p>

<p>He moved at last. It was curiously startling to see. His head
turned round until he faced Horbury and he asked, with the
annoyance most people feel when they see someone complicating a
perfectly simple question: "Why on earth don't you let him in?"</p>

<p>In reply to Horbury's look of bewilderment, he stretched out an
arm with his forefinger pointed towards the curtained windows
across the room. Even then no one except Olivia at once understood.
She had been sitting not far away, forgotten in the urgency of our
deal, but alert to each step of it and to the three characters who
were conducting it. She rose from her chair and turned towards us.
Was there something protective in her attitude? In her mere rising
from her chair? Something which cleared the fog from Daniel's
brain? His eyes followed the line of Preedy's arm, straight as a
bar to the finger's end.</p>

<p>"Let who in?"</p>

<p>"Devisher."</p>

<p>Horbury tried to scoff. "Rubbish!" he cried, and laughed, but
the laugh was more of a sob of anxiety than a laugh. "Devisher is
at this moment tumbling up and down in an old iron ship off Beachy
Head" and then in an appeal for confirmation, "Isn't that
true?"</p>

<p>Preedy's answer came at once, not to be denied; and the very
gentleness of his voice made it more than ever implacable. "I have
heard the footsteps of a man for the last half-hour. I could almost
draw a map of your garden from the sound of them."</p>

<p>No other words could have so affected Horbury. They were the
drops in the laboratory phial which change in a second the red to
blue. Terror swept over him. He saw a panther slinking, padding his
garden paths, waiting for the guests to go&mdash;Devisher. It was
one thing to send an agent to Gravesend who would promise
compensation, claim El Rey's passenger as his friend, wrap him in
the favour of a Member of Parliament and bring him along to King
Street, St. James's, in broad daylight. It was quite another thing
to find him hiding in this quiet garden for a solitary interview
with him in an empty house. Horbury uttered a little screech and
his face turned yellow. The whole casing of the man collapsed, his
small mouth dropped open&mdash;it looked horrid, obscene, and his
eyes could not turn from the curtains.</p>

<p>There was no doubt why he was afraid. He had sent Devisher out
of the country and then betrayed him to that soft-hearted man, the
Dictator of Venezuela. He had imagined himself free of him until
the Judgment Day and here he was in the moonlit garden of White
Barn with six years of the Castillo del Libertador behind him. I
had never seen so much fear made visible. And I enjoyed it! My
word, how I enjoyed it!</p>

<p>"You are afraid, Mr Daniel Horbury," I said with a chuckle of
pleasure "You don't mind facing a body of shareholders thirsting
for your blood. A mellifluous voice and silky-smooth words, and
they want to give you what you've left them. But one man with a
nasty account to settle, waiting in a lonely garden&mdash;that's
quite a different affair."</p>

<p>And quietly, just as quietly as Preedy talked, Olivia came
across the room to Horbury's side.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," she said to me.</p>

<p>Why couldn't she stay in her corner? It wasn't her business we
were discussing. She had been told to stay there. But he was
throwing out his left hand to her and she took it and held it and
willed him to resistance.</p>

<p>"Well, if he is here&mdash;I don't see how he can be&mdash;yes,
we had better get him in," he quavered, "whilst we're all together.
Then, when we've settled everything, Mr. Preedy, perhaps, will take
him back to town."</p>

<p>Nobody said a word. Nobody doubted that somehow, translated from
the moonlit Channel, Devisher was waiting in the moonlit garden.
Olivia put an end to the tension. She uttered a little cry of
revolt. "I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>Preedy's arm fell straight to his side&mdash;a decision given
and not to be gainsaid. Olivia moved&mdash;did she ever
walk?&mdash;across the room to the curtains.</p>

<p>"Let us make quite sure first," Horbury quavered.</p>

<p>"You must put out the lights, then."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Horbury wailed, but no one took any notice of him at
all.</p>

<p>There was but the one switch to control all the lights in the
room, although, here and there, the walls were plugged for standard
lamps, and that switch was at the side of the door into the hall. I
stood up and, after turning round, walked to the door. It was set
in the wall at a right-angle to the garden wall. I turned. Preedy
still sat stiff against his wall like the effigy of a god. Horbury
had been smoking a cigar when the warning of Devisher's presence
had stunned him. The cigar had fallen from his mouth and bounced
upon the table. He had put it into his mouth again and, just in
order to do something, was drawing upon it, though only the tiniest
grey spirals of vapour curled up from an edge and the end was as
black as that ebony board on which the chart was fixed.</p>

<p>Olivia stood by the curtains. "Wait! The fire," she said.</p>

<p>"It is out," I answered, but the grate was obscured from me by
the back of the divan.</p>

<p>"Then go!" Olivia ordered, and I turned down the switch. But I
had been wrong about the fire. As the darkness fell, one of the
logs sent forth a little spurt of flame which strengthened into a
flickering blaze and gleamed upon the white ceiling and sparkled in
every polished panel in the room. I heard a small gasp of relief
from Horbury&mdash;how he was petrified by this ordeal!&mdash;and
though I took no stock of it, I noticed that the spiral of smoke
from his black cigar was a trifle heavier.</p>

<p>The log moved in the grate, the spurt of flame died altogether,
the fire was out and the last glimpse of Daniel Horbury was
gone.</p>

<p>"Now," Olivia whispered.</p>

<p>Without letting one ring rattle upon the pole, she drew the
curtains apart so that one panel of the long glass door was exposed
from the lintel to the ground. A thin curtain of brown linen hung
over it and the moon made of it a sheet of silver and dappled the
floor about its edges with pools of silver, but left the hollow of
the room black with the depth of a Rembrandt.</p>

<p>Except for the shadows of some boughs of the oak trees in the
meadow beyond the garden, the screen was blank. Yet so completely
had Preedy taken the mastery of our minds that no one holding his
breath in the darkness of the room doubted that he had only to wait
in order to see it occupied.</p>

<p>One could not see or hear Olivia move, but a sharp click rang
like a pistol shot through the darkness. She had unlocked the glass
door. Again one could not see or hear Olivia move, but I know now
that without touching chair or table she slipped back to her seat
in the corner of the room. I remained by the light switch at the
angle, and suddenly a figure was on the blind, to me at all events
it looked gigantic and grotesque. Daniel Horbury yelped&mdash;there
is no other word for the sharp, queer cry of pain which broke from
him. But the figure advanced and the nearer it came, the less
formidably supernatural it became. It was now no more than a huge
man, clumsy but dangerous still, for it lurched this way and that,
a night bird scouting for a victim. And now, as he advanced yet
nearer, he was slender as a youth and his twistings mere hesitation
and timidity. He wore a felt hat and, since his back was towards
the moon, it was impossible to distinguish his features. As if he
were tired of waiting for the cars in the court yard to take their
departure, he came forward on tiptoe across a gravel path and laid
his ear against the glass pane of the door. Satisfied, apparently,
that the room was empty, he tried the handle and the glass door
swung open at his touch. He stepped over the threshold silently and
easily into&mdash;of course&mdash;an empty room.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>This wasn't the challenge of the buccaneer. His voice was a
whisper, his question an appeal.</p>

<p>"Devisher!" cried Horbury.</p>

<p>No one answered him. But Bryan Devisher had not spent six years
in the dungeons of the Castillo del Libertador for nothing. He knew
his mistake as soon as he had made it. There were others in the
room besides Horbury. He sprang to one side out of that picture
frame of moonlight.</p>

<p>"This is a trap, what?"</p>

<p>And, by the most wondrous luck, Horbury's cigar glowed red. He
had puffed and drawn the black thing into life, unaware of what he
was doing. Devisher flung the curtains across the glass door. There
was no caution about the rings on the pole this time. They rattled
like all the clogs on the French market stones. His voice changed
to anger.</p>

<p>"A trap!" he repeated.</p>

<p>Oh, it was Devisher&mdash;and my great moment. Never did I
deserve it. He dashed for the door, close at my side, stopped,
searched for the handle, breathing hard. And precisely then, with
one movement, as I had been taught, I tore the knife from its
sheath and flung it. It sped true, true, true, with a hiss. For the
fraction of a second I saw it by the light of Horbury's cigar curve
down and inwards and take him by the throat. I heard a horrible
gurgle, a heavy fall of a heavy body upon the table, a jet like a
fountain bursting, and a burning cigar described a circle in the
air. But I had my own to do. Devisher was dragging and scuffling at
the door. He had forgotten, in his absence of more than six years
the height of the handle from the ground and whether the door
opened inwards or outwards. I grappled with him, the blood surging
in every vein. I was free from the old rogue with the lovely voice
and the silky-smooth words and the cruelty of a cat.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" I cried. "You don't get away like that! No,
sir!"</p>

<p>But I found the handle for him nonetheless, and tore open the
door. He had shaken me off and flung himself through the doorway in
a trice. I didn't make it very difficult for him. He was as
panic-stricken as old dead Demosthenes Junior had been, but he kept
his wits and, once he was out in the hall, he slammed the door hard
and locked us all in. In the sudden silence, drop-drop-drop,
measured like the drops from a medicine bottle, pattered on the
floor. Olivia's voice rose in a scream.</p>

<p>"Lights! Lights! Lights!"</p>

<p>Never did Hamlet's uncle call for them so eagerly. I turned the
switch and the room sprang to light.</p>

<p>Preedy stooped, picked up a burning cigar from the mat and
tossed it into the fire. So far as I remember, that was the third
movement he had made during that evening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap32" id="chap32"><small>CHAPTER 32</small></a><br>
<br>
COUNTERPLOTS</h2>

<p class="first">Olivia was near to the centre of the room when the
lights were turned on. Horbury's gross body had fallen forward over
the blotting-book and the table, but in his panic he had drawn its
legs so tightly to him as a defence that he was wedged in his
chair. His head was turned towards me, so that she could not see
the wound at his throat. But the pool of blood upon the floor and
the blue-handled knife amongst it could have left her in no doubt
of his death. She did not touch him but she covered her face with
her hands, and then, taking them away, said in a pitiful quiet
voice: "Daniel! Oh, Daniel!"</p>

<p>I was hurt by her appeal. You may think that unimportant, but I
was. It sounded as if a child were complaining of some injustice
and asking for it to be explained to her; and explained by the one
man who would never explain anything any more&mdash;not even to an
assembly of shareholders in the Cannon Street Hotel who wanted to
know where their dividends had gone to. Did I utter some sort of
cry? I don't know, but I felt that her face turned suddenly towards
me. In a fluster I rattled the handle of the door.</p>

<p>"He has locked us in."</p>

<p>As I spoke I heard the whirr of an engine starting. And a car
turned to the left out of the courtyard and raced down to the
Turnpike Road, the noise of the engine dwindling as it went.</p>

<p>"He has locked us all in together," she said, and it seemed to
me that a cruel, bitter little smile for a second on her lips.
"There has been murder done. We must ring up the police."</p>

<p>She was walking back towards the telephone on the long table
close to the corner in which she had been sitting, when once more
Preedy took charge.</p>

<p>"Wait, please, Mrs. Horbury!"</p>

<p>Olivia stopped and turned. "Why? There has been murder
done."</p>

<p>Again she looked straight at me. Did she know? Yes, but by
nothing she had seen or heard. Perhaps her soul had claimed the
truth from me and mine had been forced to answer. My secret was
hers, too, I felt quite sure, and fortunately Preedy was there to
stand between us.</p>

<p>"Murder, if you will," he said clearly. "He has stolen one of
our cars, Crottle's or mine." There was a look of bewilderment in
Olivia's eyes "This man, Devisher, Bryan Devisher," Preedy
explained. "But he can't get far. If you telephone now, he may very
likely be caught within the hour. And then, of course, nothing
could save him. He had suffered damnably&mdash;I am sorry to say it
here and now&mdash;at Horbury's hands. If ever a man had a motive
to take the law into his hands, Bryan Devisher had."</p>

<p>"Bryan Devisher?" she repeated thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He has come straight from South America. I suppose that he had
planned somehow to arrive a day before his time. He waits in the
garden of a house he knew, no doubt well, in olden days, until he
thinks the coast is clear. He uses a South American way of
adjusting his wrongs and, as you said, locks us all in together and
bolts."</p>

<p>"Bryan Devisher?" Olivia repeated. When she used the name before
she had been bewildered. Now she was realising how exactly he
fitted the niche which was being built for him&mdash;Bryan
Devisher, Murderer.</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt he can be caught, tried, hanged. It is as you
will."</p>

<p>Olivia looked at Preedy. She transferred her thoughts to him. He
was now the antagonist, not I.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on, speaking reasonably, "Crottle and I are
here. We are the witnesses. We saw Horbury in a panic. We saw
Devisher come into the room with the moonlight behind him. We heard
the swish of the knife, the struggle of George Crottle to arrest
him, the slamming of the door, and the key turned in the lock."</p>

<p>How could she fight all this evidence? But she stood where she
was, giving no ground.</p>

<p>"But why were we here?" he resumed. "George Crottle and Preedy,
his lawyer. What were we doing at White Barn on this night? We
shall be asked. And we shall have to answer."</p>

<p>"What will you answer?"</p>

<p>The question was stubborn and resentful. It matched her white,
still face, the upright defiance of her stance.</p>

<p>"The truth," answered Preedy. "We were blackmailed. The
wickedest crime in the Calendar of Justice. Worse than murder,
judges say. More cruel, more"&mdash;and his voice dropped a little
out of consideration for her, but lost none of its
determination&mdash;"more mean."</p>

<p>Her head flashed up in revolt against the word and dropped
again.</p>

<p>"If it's not murder, then, what is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Suicide."</p>

<p>It was a hard choice and Preedy left it so. The decision must be
hers. She stood and shifted a foot, following the pattern of the
carpet whilst she made it, She might accuse me, of course. I could
see the thought in her mind as she lifted a rebellious face towards
me. But, if I had planned murder, should I have brought my lawyer
with me to see it done? Devisher was so much the more obvious
criminal and usually the obvious criminal is the right criminal.
Moreover, she wouldn't want the wrong man to go to the scaffold and
she wouldn't want to listen to a true story of blackmail by Daniel
and the judge's comments upon it. She suddenly sat down upon a
chair as though her knees failed her.</p>

<p>"He was very good to me," she said in a whisper, her head bowed,
her hands clasped together. And the battle was over.</p>

<p>"We must have the door unlocked," said Preedy briskly. "Perhaps
Mrs. Horbury will do it, since you have a key."</p>

<p>Olivia looked blank until Preedy pointed out that she would have
to go round by the garden and let herself in at the front door.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>She fetched her handbag from the chair in the corner and took
from it a bunch of keys. She thrust the curtain aside and the
moonlit garden seemed to be waiting for her.</p>

<p>"There was once a tree spoiling all the prospect," she said with
a little break in her voice. "Oh, not a beech tree, but just a
negligible Scotch fir, and I had it cut down, so that the eyes
travel without fatigue across the lawn to a sunk fence and beyond
that over the long meadow to the Turnpike Road. I had a curious
sense of freedom when the tree had gone."</p>

<p>She stood looking out and behind her the blood from Horbury's
throat which had splashed upon the table began again to slip from
its polished surface. Again it fell slowly and horribly, one and
one and one. The sound seemed to hush all the world so that it
might be heard the better. Olivia's face was twisted with pain. She
turned and flung the words at Preedy.</p>

<p>"Do you hear? You with the quick ears? Doesn't each drop cry
aloud for vengeance?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of the cost of vengeance," he replied, "to all of
us. To you. And even to him."</p>

<p>Olivia turned back to the window. I think that she saw Horbury
alive and in the dock, sentenced. For she whispered, more to
herself than to either of us: "Day after endless day. The
vision&mdash;this&mdash;" and she reached out her hand towards the
meadows and the trees, "narrowing with each year until it
vanished."</p>

<p>She spoke as if you could punish a dead body. Then she did the
last thing I wanted her to do. She took the key of the door from
the small ring of keys which she held. She offered it, shining in
the palm of her hand, to Preedy.</p>

<p>"One of you. I stay with my man."</p>

<p>There was a gleam of admiration of her in Preedy's eyes, and
when he bowed to her, as he did, it was, I think, as much to
conceal a little smile of defeat as to acknowledge her words with
respect.</p>

<p>"You, George," he said to me, and Olivia turned her hand above
an occasional table. As she walked away from it towards her dead
husband's side, the key tinkled on the mahogany surface.</p>

<p>I took it, went out by the garden door and round by a little
path to the front of the house. I noticed that it was my small car,
the one nearest to the front door, which Devisher had taken. Then I
let myself in. But I didn't immediately return to the garden-room.
One Yale latch-key is like another, and I had in my pocket one
which fitted the drawer of my desk. I compared the pair by the hall
lamp, but it would not do to exchange them. Olivia's key was marked
by three scratches at intervals, mine had no clues to ownership at
all. I put my own key back in my pocket. The cupboard door stood
open. My hat hung on a peg next to Horbury's coat. I took the
sheath of the knife from my coat breast pocket and, after wiping it
clean, put it into the pocket of Horbury's coat. On unlocking the
door of the garden-room I saw Preedy busily polishing the furniture
frames and the tables.</p>

<p>"You sat at the corner of that divan all the time," he said to
me.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He began to enumerate the places where fingerprints might have
been found of others besides Horbury and Olivia&mdash;the
garden-door and the door into the hall for instance.</p>

<p>"There's the outside of the door into the hall," he said.
"Devisher will have left the palm of his hand upon the panels."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I had a picture of Devisher slamming the door and locking us in.
I turned towards it, and Olivia said: "You will leave my key,
please."</p>

<p>I dropped her latchkey on the same table which she had used.
Polishing the outer panels with the door half open, I saw her
identify her key and replace it on its ring. I drew a breath of
relief that I had not tried to substitute a key of my own for
hers.</p>

<p>"There, I think that will do. Now it remains&mdash;a rather
gruesome business, I am afraid&mdash;to make a tableau which the
police can reconstruct in the morning."</p>

<p>Olivia drew back with a shiver. "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Must!" cried Preedy, and for the first time roughly. "It's
getting late. We can't go on advancing and retreating. We are not
dancing the Lancers."</p>

<p>He approached her impatiently, almost threateningly. I suppose
that from the other side I closed in upon her. For she looked at me
sharply and then back again at the set and quiet features of
Preedy. Quiet they were, but there was now a menace in the room, a
chill.</p>

<p>"There have been pacts, haven't there?" said Preedy.</p>

<p>"Pacts?"</p>

<p>She was really bewildered.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to take you for a fool. You understand well
enough. Pacts. The coroners' courts are full of them."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide. She looked at Preedy. She looked at me. I
think that we must both by now have been standing quite close to
her.</p>

<p>"Suicide pacts," she said with a little falter in her voice. But
she didn't move, not a foot, not a hand. I don't think it would
have been lucky for her if she had. We were all three as motionless
as effigies. All three might move as sedately or as violently as
the plot demanded, but not one alone. No, indeed. But I believed, I
still believe, that if she had been absolutely certain that I and
not the innocent Devisher would be convicted of the murder, she
would have taken her risks of us and let Horbury's blackmailing be
exposed. But she had no such certainty. Whatever she might say, the
evidence pointed to Devisher and not to me.</p>

<p>"Then that's settled," said Preedy. "We all three have the same
secret to hide. Will you bring the little table&mdash;yes, the one
from which you took your key, and set it between the corner of the
divan and&mdash;well, here?"</p>

<p>He pointed to Horbury.</p>

<p>"Now, please sit on the divan, your hand perhaps on the end so
as to leave your prints."</p>

<p>He then asked her where the champagne, the famous Pommery '06,
was kept. He left us together, and I can't remember a period more
embarrassing. But, in truth, he worked quickly. He came back with
two goblets of thin glass which Horbury affected. One was half
full, and that he placed on the occasional table by Olivia. The
other he set on the table over which Horbury lay. There was just
room for it. He had a cloth in his hand and he wiped away from the
glasses all traces of his own handling of them.</p>

<p>"Will you touch that with your fingers and your lips," he said,
pointing to the half-filled glass in front of her. But she nodded
to the glass on Horbury's table.</p>

<p>"That one first."</p>

<p>Preedy handed it to her and she drank it with a little nod and a
small wistful smile towards the horror sprawled over the table. She
drank it to the last drop, partly as a tribute to a good many
pleasant hours spent with her ogre at White Barn, partly because
she was as near exhaustion as a woman well could be. A little
colour rose into her face as she handed back the empty glass to
him. Preedy balanced it once more on the table, and then with a
push toppled it off on to the ground, where the thin glass smashed
into splinters.</p>

<p>"We were sitting here?" she asked. "Just the pair of us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Then you left him and went up to bed."</p>

<p>"And fell asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You heard nothing until your servant screamed in the
morning."</p>

<p>"And I waked," she said sardonically, and so paused and
shivered, "to find the door unlocked?"</p>

<p>She thought upon the endless hours of darkness during which she
must lie and listen, and perhaps hear that dead man struggling to
rise from the table. Where she had shivered, she now shuddered so
that her teeth rattled.</p>

<p>"'What if the vigil&mdash;for that it must be&mdash;persuaded no
one?" she asked.</p>

<p>Preedy set out his argument. Men like Horbury had always
troubles which were secret. He had weathered storms, no doubt, but
men lose heart at the last. "And so, sitting up here alone at
night, and, if things were well with him, perhaps thinking that he
was, after all, doing his best for you, he sought this way out.
There is one more thing to be done, alas!"</p>

<p>On the floor, amidst the congealing blood, lay the long,
thin-bladed knife with its gay blue handle. Preedy knelt, took his
handkerchief from his pocket, and stooped.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The cry broke from Olivia Horbury passionately. Her eyes were
ablaze, her arm stretched out with, a pointing finger as steady as
justice itself. Preedy sat back on his heels.</p>

<p>"His fingers held that knife!"</p>

<p>That one fact swept all the arguments for our decision out of
her mind.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Preedy.</p>

<p>"His fingers were the last to hold it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The murderer's."</p>

<p>Proof was there lying in that red pool&mdash;proof which would
hang.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I expostulated. Who knew but that some unlucky chance might send
us a visitor who would know us again&mdash;a stranger asking his
way, a motorist who had run short of petrol, a neighbour with
sickness in the house whose telephone was under repair. Preedy
waited with his eyes on Olivia.</p>

<p>"There must be other ways by which guilt comes home," she said.
"Let me, please, do what must be done."</p>

<p>She knelt in Preedy's place. He handed her a clean handkerchief
and, taking up the heavy knife by its blade delicately from the
congealing blood in which it lay, she wiped the handle. Then,
lifting it to Horbury's out-thrown hand, she placed it in his palm
and closed his fingers about it. She opened them again. It needed
now some effort, but she made it and, still holding it by the blade
under the handkerchief, she replaced it exactly where it had
lain.</p>

<p>"That is all?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We can go."</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and with such a look of horror upon her
face as neither of us had ever seen. She tore the curtain aside
from the glass door and passed into the garden. Heaven knows what
her thoughts were, but they did not hold her long. Long enough,
however, to give me the chance of which I had begun to despair. A
steel chain ran from Horbury's waist into his trouser pocket and
the pocket gaped. At the end of the chain a ring of keys hung by a
spring hook. I had the time to release the ring from the spring
hook, replace the chain and thrust the keys into my pocket, when
the garden door was slammed fast and locked. Olivia came back into
the room and drew the curtains again so carefully that not a fold
was disarranged, not a thread of light shone out upon the lawn.</p>

<p>I took up the ebony board with the chart pinned upon it. Preedy
was looking about the room, touching a chair here and there with
his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"We ought to have left the prints of the woman who cleans the
room," he said, "but we couldn't." He turned to me. "You turned on
the lights."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He dusted the switch with the white handkerchief and I noticed
that a faint blue stain had been left upon the cambric by the
handle of the knife.</p>

<p>"You will leave the lights on, of course," he said to Olivia who
was following us. In the hall she latched the door and locked it.
Preedy stopped at once.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," he said gently. "In the morning the door must
be found unlocked."</p>

<p>Olivia bowed her head and unlocked it. Then she held open the
front door of the house. A small breath of wind was rustling
amongst the boughs of the trees.</p>

<p>"There was much that was sordid&mdash;worse, if you
will&mdash;in my husband's life," said Olivia. "You were right. I
would not wish his story to be known to the world, just so that a
man called Devisher might be hanged. No!" and she added, after a
pause, "there would have to be a much better reason than that."
Though her voice was low, her eyes were fierce, her face quite
haggard and all its beauty gone. "Yes, a much stronger reason."</p>

<p>And upon the two men who listened to her a sense of new danger
rolled like a tide.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap33" id="chap33"><small>CHAPTER 33</small></a><br>
<br>
GEORGE RETURNS</h2>

<p class="first">We rolled Preedy's car out on to the road,
although there was really no reason for such secrecy. Preedy was in
an excellent mood, one moment whistling a tune, another assuring me
in answer to some anxious question, that it was all Sir Garnet.
Certainly he was correct in one particular. The problem of Devisher
was solved.</p>

<p>We found my car outside the gardens of Pevensey Crescent and
Devisher inside it. He knew the truth and, at the same time, his
own danger. He wanted no trouble any more. He had already endured
his life-time's share and, knowing as much as he did, he applied
with some confidence for the opportunity of an easy life in some
quiet corner of the world. This took place over a whisky-and-soda
in my parlour.</p>

<p>"What about Cairo?" I asked a little too promptly to please
Preedy.</p>

<p>"All that has got to stop," he said. "I am going up to the
Caledonian Market myself to see about it."</p>

<p>"But there are cargoes arranged and some on the way."</p>

<p>"They will be the last," said Preedy, and he looked at Devisher.
"Well, for the moment, Cairo. Then what about Ceylon, where every
prospect pleases? They tell me that as you approach that island a
delightful aroma of spices floats out to you across the sea."</p>

<p>"Either place will be A.1. for me," Devisher agreed with
relief.</p>

<p>It was arranged there and then. I was not expected at the office
the next morning. I was to start in my car with Devisher at
half-past eight. There would be traffic already on the roads and I
must never exceed the speed limit or in any way attract attention.
I was to drive to Southampton through Camberley and Hartley Row. At
Basingstoke and Winchester I was to buy some ready-made clothes,
shirts, flannels, under clothes and shoes. Devisher would have his
new passport. Since I was well-known to the dock officials, there
would be no trouble at the gates. I was to make him out a ticket in
the Southampton office of the Line and see him off with the ship. I
had the resident staff part of the Line under my control and could
arrange by a telegram for his arrival at Port Said to be expected.
Then Preedy took him away for the night.</p>

<p>Preedy was equally confident that I should have no trouble with
Olivia. She wouldn't move, for her dead husband's sake. But,
although I had not argued, I had not agreed. The amitié amoureuse,
which was all I was going to allow her with Daniel, would in time
wear off. And then? I could not but remember the bitterness of her
last words. They had frightened Preedy.</p>

<p>I had, however, already taken Horbury's keys from his pocket and
I meant to use them that night. I remembered that whenever Horbury
had risen from his chair, he had kept a solid hand upon his
blotting-book, and that when he had written in it the name of the
ship Sheriff, he had lifted the stiff cover only just enough to use
a corner of the blotting-paper. That precious letter to Septimus
was between the covers of buhl and mother-of-pearl. Horbury had
brought it to White Barn, had meant to hand it over, but I suppose
lost his confidence in us at the last minute. I meant to get it
before the police did. I don't think that Preedy had noticed me
lifting Horbury's keys. He had been too busy polishing away
fingerprints and I hadn't consulted him. This, the last achievement
of the night, I proposed to carry out alone.</p>

<p>Instead of backing the car into the little garage at the side of
my house, I drove it away to Battersea. I would keep within the
speed-limit all the way to Southampton, but there was no reason why
I should follow that good advice to-night. Night, I say, but it was
half-past two in the morning when I left the car under the trees at
the side of the road. A risk? Yes, but I had to take it. The choice
lay between driving into the courtyard and very likely arousing
Olivia's attention, or leaving the car beyond the reach of her ears
The chances of a policeman discovering it were about
fifty-fifty.</p>

<p>There was no one whom I could see or hear. The moon was still
bright and the world asleep. I crept up to the house and let myself
in with Horbury's key, taking the bunch with me as soon as the hall
door was open. I fixed up the latch so that I could get away
quickly if it became necessary and I stood still for a few moments
in the black hall, listening, until the silence itself began to
roar in my ears I moved like a ghost to the garden-room door and
noiselessly turn the handle with my fingers wrapped in my
handkerchief The lights were burning. Horbury was sprawled across
his table; but there was a change in the room since last I had seen
it&mdash;a change which caught me by the heart and stopped the
blood in my veins. The blotting-book was on its edges on the floor
now instead of lying flat under the weight of Horbury's body.</p>

<p>As soon as I recovered my breath, I crossed the room on tiptoe
and stooped over it. It stood half-open, the back uppermost. There
was no letter under it, none between the leaves. No danger from the
woman upstairs! Oh, wasn't there? She had come back to this room
when she was alone. She had pushed the blotting-book from under
Horbury's body. I could hear the buttons of his waistcoat
scratching across the metal cover. She had taken the letter to
Septimus out of it and then she had toppled it on to the edge of
the congealing blood on the floor. What a damnable woman! I was
wondering what I should do when the telephone rang on the long
table against the wall. It wasn't possible! I stood up stiff as a
tombstone. No, it wasn't possible! Who should be ringing up White
Barn at half-past in the morning? The Love-Nest? No! But there the
bell was, one, two, pause, one, two, pause. It had got to be
stopped. It wasn't until I lifted the receiver from its cradle that
I realised that I had acknowledged the call. Someone was in the
house then, more, was in the room where a man had committed suicide
three to four hours before and where he still lay sprawled across
the table. I heard a voice calling Horbury. It seemed to come out
of my hand. I looked down and saw that my hand was bare. I was not
going to answer the call&mdash;not I! The noise of ringing had
ceased&mdash;that was one good thing. I took my handkerchief from
my breast-pocket with my left hand and carefully wiped the handle
between the ear and the mouthpiece. Then I replaced it on its
cradle. The sound: was not renewed at all events. The caller had
ceased to call.</p>

<p>I rubbed the sweat off my forehead. I was streaming with it. I
was thinking that, whatever happened, never in all my life could I
be so startled again. And the next moment the thought was
disproved. The last horror of that night capped all. Somewhere,
above my head, a key was turned in a lock and someone fell. I
didn't stay after that. I tossed Horbury's ring of keys on to the
table by the instrument. Then I fled. Oh, yes, even in my panic, I
pulled to the door of the garden-room and opened the front-door of
the house with my handkerchief about my hand. I did it without
reflecting, for I was incapable of reflection. I ran down the lane.
It was still deserted. To put the proper finish on the night, I
should have found that some thief had run away with my car. But,
beyond expectation, it was there where I had left it. I drove back
to London. My word, the lighted streets! I eased the car very
gently into its garage and went to bed.</p>

<p>Mistakes, of course, were made. Preedy made one on this night.
He cleaned the garden-room of fingerprints so thoroughly that the
absence of them became suspicious. I don't see how that could have
been helped, however, and I don't count that as his mistake. Where
he really went wrong was in the matter of a bottle of Pommery '06.
He opened it in the pantry without leaving marks on it, but, having
filled two glasses, he stoppered the bottle again and put it back
amongst the others. There is not very much to be said for Daniel
Horbury, but he never opened a bottle of Pommery '06 without making
sure that the very last drop was going to be squeezed out of
it.</p>

<p>I, however, erred more completely. I should never have taken
Horbury's keys from his pocket and returned to White Barn. I should
never have taken up the telephone receiver from its cradle. I
should have slipped Daniel's ring of keys once more upon his spring
lock. But all these errors are nothing compared with the folly I
was guilty of in letting myself go when old Sept broke down over
the captivity of the young Dauphin! It is said that I sighed! I let
out a great big 'O' of delight. For the first time I had found a
weak spot in the chain-mail of the old boy's authority. My hide-out
became a prison. The Barnishes wouldn't be sorry to have Captain
Septimus under their charge for a little. Captain Septimus had
sacked Fred Barnish at five minutes' notice. A few weeks of
Arkwright's Farm for Septimus and I saw myself Chairman and
Managing Director of the Dagger Line. And then all's spoilt because
a copper walks into the farm because he suspects that Barnish is
keeping a dog without having a dog licence! Well, I ask you!</p>

<p>However, even so, I might perhaps have got through but for the
idiot Ricardo and the preposterous Nosey Parker from Paris.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Maltby was caught off his guard by the final sentence. He had
meant to leave it out altogether, but discovered himself
floundering amongst the opening words. He was then forced to read
it without the omission of a word. Mr. Ricardo flushed with shame,
but Hanaud jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.</p>

<p>"Without Mr. Ricardo," he cried, "where should I be? Like the
good George, I ask you. I should still be driving over the Bridge
of Battersea amongst the seagulls. As for mistakes, it is possible
that once or twice in my life I make one," he said dreamily. "I do
not know."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap34" id="chap34"><small>CHAPTER 34</small></a><br>
<br>
THE LAST</h2>

<p class="first">At luncheon the conversation was desultory, but a
few additions were made, chiefly by Maltby, to complete the pattern
of the story. For instance, certain changes were taking place in
the staff of a foreign Embassy and a barber's shop on the edge of
the Caledonian Market had been closed down. The presence of
Mordaunt, as an officer in the Egyptian Coastguard Service, had
caused one more upheaval to the unfortunate Bryan Devisher, He had
been moved on, overnight, as it were, to Delagoa Bay, where a small
trade had been carried on by the Dagger Line. He was now dismissed
from that service altogether and was working as book-keeper in a
Portuguese store. It would be for the Egyptian Government to ask
for his extradition if it thought it worth while, but it probably
would not.</p>

<p>"And now," said Maltby, "there is one question which we all wish
to ask, Monsieur Hanaud."</p>

<p>Luncheon was over. Coffee smoked upon the table and a cigar, a
pipe, a cigarette smoked in the air, dimming the bright aspect of
the Thames.</p>

<p>Monsieur Hanaud beamed.</p>

<p>"Ask!" he answered with simplicity.</p>

<p>"Where was the Crottle letter hidden?"</p>

<p>"And how did you find out?"</p>

<p>The questions were fired at him from right and left.</p>

<p>"It was not so difficult to find out, but it was amusing all the
same. Maltby, with Bryan Devisher and the Dagger Line and the
Caledonian Market all on his shoulders at once, he leaves that
little problem to me! Listen! The letter was in the blotting-book.
Horbury had come to make a bargain. It was not in nature that he
should not have with him his evidence that there was a bargain to
be made. That was clear the next day when in the secret drawer in
Horbury's office the letter was no longer to be found. But I was
sure of it in the morning. I could not see how, in falling forward,
Horbury had pushed that book with its heavy cover off the table. It
seemed to me to have been worked from under him by someone else.
The book was empty. Who, then, had the letter? Someone had come
back for it. Someone who heard the telephone ring hours after
Horbury was dead? Had he found it? I thought not. I thought that
the lady who faced us in the dining-room would have had the courage
to secure that weapon for herself as soon as she was left alone.
Well, then, where was it? The police went through the house with a
toothbrush..."</p>

<p>"Comb," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

<p>"As I said," Hanaud continued imperturbably, "and they did not
find it. Therefore it was not in the house. But it was near."</p>

<p>"In Olivia Horbury's handbag," Ricardo suggested.</p>

<p>"Not safe enough," replied Maltby.</p>

<p>"And too bulky for her dress," Hanaud corroborated. "So I smoke
a cigarette and I reflect. The garden?&mdash;with a gardener one
day a week, that's what it looked like. Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ricardo; and Maltby, looking out on his own patch of
carefully tended flowers, nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"But there was a fine thing in that garden which was tended with
all the loving care it merited."</p>

<p>"The holly hedge," cried Maltby.</p>

<p>"Yes. It stood twenty feet high. It was clipped. It was smooth
as a yew hedge. I wondered. Then, when I called on that kind lady
for the money for my patient Gravot of the Place Vendôme, I praise
the fine hedge and her face lights up. Always in the old days when
they were poor, she had clipped it on a ladder and looked after it
herself, and still trusted it to no one. Then, a little quickly,
she adds that it requires little attention now. 'Once a year. I
clipped it in the autumn,' and, rather red in the face, she wished
me good morning. So I have it! Carefully wrapped in waterproof
rubber, it is, when it is advisable to hide it, hidden in the
hedge. Then I make pictures. It will be high, yes. We will need the
ladder. It will be at the end near the road. No, no. Then I get
from Maltby a description of her bedroom. There are two windows
opening on to meadows and one window opposite the holly hedge. I do
not need to seek more. On a level with the window, whence it could
just be seen, thrust into the hedge out of reach."</p>

<p>At this moment, Monsieur Hanaud looked at his watch and leaped
to his feet.</p>

<p>"My dear friends, I have to fly. I have promised to say good-bye
to a young lady at the boat train on the Victoria Station at five
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, you Frenchmen! Ha! ha!" roared Maltby, shaking with
delight.</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied Hanaud, catching up his hat and his gloves and
his stick. "The days of the wink and the gay twinkle in the eyes
are past for me. I say good-bye in all respect to a lady who
returns to her duties in Cairo as the secretary of a famous
archaeologist."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Ricardo, to whom this announcement was news. "Mrs.
Rosalind Leete."</p>

<p>"Mrs Leete," Hanaud agreed with a smile "It is pleasant to see
the young so devoted to such serious topics as Neferti and the
mummies of dead kings. But I do not think that her duties will be
prolonged."</p>

<p>"And how is that?" asked Maltby, who had no liking for
allusions.</p>

<p>"I gather from a word dropped here and there that the excellent
Mordaunt will be on the quay at Port Said."</p>

<p>Mordaunt and Rosalind Yes, you have got to have it, you know...
Well, perhaps you needn't. We can more suitably complete the
pattern of this story with the few words which passed between the
two unlikely friends the next morning at the corner house and
Hanaud's departure for the Continent.</p>

<p>For the end of the holiday so often postponed had really come.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, Hanaud was to take the train to
Folkestone. Meanwhile, over his cigarette after breakfast, he
looked backwards to the morning at the end of August when, with
seagulls swooping over the river, he had driven with Ricardo across
Battersea Bridge.</p>

<p>"Until you told me the story of Devisher's rescue, I was ready
to accept the theory of Horbury's suicide. But that made a
difference, eh? Here was a man, free as any stranger in London,
with as black a score against Horbury as a man could have. Also he
knew White Barn as Horbury's home. Someone was at White Barn
unexpectedly that night. Otherwise all the usual, natural
fingerprints wouldn't have been removed. Some one was too anxious.
But, if Devisher had broken in and exacted his revenge, what was he
doing in the house three and a half to four hours after he had
committed his murder? And why did Olivia Horbury protect him?"</p>

<p>Ricardo nodded his head very wisely.</p>

<p>"So I began to wonder whether there was not, besides Devisher,
someone else in the garden-room. And I was puzzled by that word
'Sheriff' written on the corner of the blotting-pad. Yes, I was
very puzzled. Could there perhaps be something else which explained
Mrs. Horbury's silence, the lifting of the telephone receiver, the
locked door, the Sheriff everything?"</p>

<p>"That afternoon Septimus Crottle swung into the picture," said
Ricardo.</p>

<p>"The name of Crottle brought Maltby to help us. Why was it that
this man without money, without friends, Bryan Devisher, could not
be found? Because, on Friday afternoon, the steamship Sheriff of
the Dagger Line sailed with a last-minute passenger whom George
Crottle had motored that morning to Southampton. The beautiful
routine work, my friend, of the British police!"</p>

<p>Hanaud and Mr. Ricardo said good-bye a few hours later on the
platform at Victoria Station, Mr. Ricardo all friendship and
regret, Monsieur Hanaud a little lost, as though he had forgotten
something important to remember. But, as the whistle blew and, the
train started, his face cleared. He stood in the doorway of the
coach, beaming.</p>

<p>"You are quite yourself, eh?" cried the anxious Ricardo.</p>

<p>Hanaud nodded. He had remembered. He laughed. He answered: "I am
all Sir Garnet."</p>
