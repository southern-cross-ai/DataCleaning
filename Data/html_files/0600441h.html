CASE OF MRS. EMSLEY</a></h2>
<p class="first">IN the fierce popular indignation which is excited by a
sanguinary crime there is a tendency, in which judges and juries share, to
brush aside or to treat as irrelevant those doubts the benefit of which is
supposed to be one of the privileges of the accused. Lord Tenterden has
whittled down the theory of doubt by declaring that a jury is justified in
giving its verdict upon such evidence as it would accept to be final in any of
the issues of life. But when one looks back and remembers how often one has
been very sure and yet has erred in the issues of life, how often what has
seemed certain has failed us, and that which appeared impossible has come to
pass, we feel that if the criminal law has been conducted upon such principles
it is probably itself the giant murderer of England. Far wiser is the
contention that it is better that ninety-nine guilty should escape than that
one innocent man should suffer, and that, therefore, if it can be claimed that
there is one chance in a hundred in favour of the prisoner he is entitled to
his acquittal. It cannot be doubted that if the Scotch verdict of 'Not proven,'
which neither condemns nor acquits, had been permissible in England it would
have been the outcome of many a case which, under our sterner law, has ended
upon the scaffold. Such a verdict would, I fancy, have been hailed as a welcome
compromise by the judge and the jury who investigated the singular
circumstances which attended the case of Mrs. Mary Emsley.</p>
<p>The stranger in London who wanders away from the beaten paths and strays
into the quarters in which the workers dwell is astounded by their widespread
monotony, by the endless rows of uniform brick houses broken only by the corner
public-houses and more infrequent chapels which are scattered amongst them. The
expansion of the great city has been largely caused by the covering of district
after district with these long lines of humble dwellings, and the years between
the end of the Crimean War and 1860 saw great activity in this direction. Many
small builders by continually mortgaging what they had done, and using the
capital thus acquired to start fresh works which were themselves in turn
mortgaged, contrived to erect street after street, and eventually on account of
the general rise of property to make considerable fortunes. Amongst these
astute speculators there was one John Emsley, who, dying, left his numerous
houses and various interests to his widow Mary.</p>

<p>Mary Emsley, now an old woman, had lived too long in a humble fashion to
change her way of life. She was childless, and all the activities of her nature
were centred upon the economical management of her property, and the collection
of the weekly rents from the humble tenants who occupied them. A grim, stern,
eccentric woman, she was an object of mingled dislike and curiosity among the
inhabitants of Grove Road, Stepney, in which her house was situated. Her
possessions extended over Stratford, Bow, and Bethnal Green, and in spite of
her age she made long journeys, collecting, evicting, and managing, always
showing a great capacity for the driving of a hard bargain. One of her small
economies was that when she needed help in managing these widespread properties
she preferred to employ irregular agents to engaging a salaried representative.
There were many who did odd jobs for her, and among them were two men whose
names were destined to become familiar to the public. The one was John Emms, a
cobbler; the other George Mullins, a plasterer.</p>
<p>Mary Emsley, in spite of her wealth, lived entirely alone, save that on
Saturdays a charwoman called to clean up the house. She showed also that
extreme timidity and caution which are often characteristic of those who
afterwards perish by violence&mdash;as if there lies in human nature some vague
instinctive power of prophecy. It was with reluctance that she ever opened her
door, and each visitor who approached her was reconnoitred from the window of
her area. Her fortune would have permitted her to indulge herself with every
luxury, but the house was a small one, consisting of two stories and a
basement, with a neglected back garden, and her mode of life was even simpler
than her dwelling. It was a singular and most unnatural old age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Emsley was last seen alive upon the evening of Monday, August 13th,
1860. Upon that date, at seven o'clock, two neighbours perceived her sitting at
her bedroom window. Next morning, shortly after ten, one of her irregular
retainers called upon some matter of brass taps, but was unable to get any
answer to his repeated knockings. During that Tuesday many visitors had the
same experience, and the Wednesday and Thursday passed without any sign of life
within the house. One would have thought that this would have aroused instant
suspicions, but the neighbours were so accustomed to the widow's eccentricities
that they were slow to be alarmed. It was only upon the Friday, when John Emms,
the cobbler, found the same sinister silence prevailing in the house, that a
fear of foul play came suddenly upon him. He ran round to Mr. Rose, her
attorney, and Mr. Faith, who was a distant relation, and the three men returned
to the house. On their way they picked up Police-constable Dillon, who
accompanied them.</p>
<p>The front door was fastened and the windows snibbed, so the party made their
way over the garden wall and so reached the back entrance, which they seem to
have opened without difficulty. John Emms led the way, for he was intimately
acquainted with the house. On the ground floor there was no sign of the old
woman. The creak of their boots and the subdued whisper of their voices were
the only sounds which broke the silence. They ascended the stair with a feeling
of reassurance. Perhaps it was all right after all. It was quite probable that
the eccentric widow might have gone on a visit. And then as they came upon the
landing John Emms stood staring, and the others, peering past him, saw that
which struck the hope from their hearts.</p>
<p>It was the footprint of a man dimly outlined in blood upon the wooden floor.
The door of the front room was nearly closed, and this dreadful portent lay in
front of it with the toes pointing away. The police-constable pushed at the
door, but something which lay behind it prevented it from opening. At last by
their united efforts they effected an entrance. There lay the unfortunate old
woman, her lank limbs all asprawl upon the floor, with two rolls of wall-paper
under her arm and several others scattered in front of her. It was evident that
the frightful blows which had crushed in her head had fallen upon her
unforeseen, and had struck her senseless in an instant. She had none of that
anticipation which is the only horror of death.</p>

<br>
<p>The news of the murder of so well known an inhabitant caused the utmost
excitement in the neighbourhood, and every effort was made to detect the
assassin. A Government reward of &pound;100 was soon raised to &pound;300, but
without avail. A careful examination of the house failed to reveal anything
which might serve as a reliable clue. It was difficult to determine the hour of
the murder, for there was reason to think that the dead woman occasionally
neglected to make her bed, so that the fact that the bed was unmade did not
prove that it had been slept in. She was fully dressed, as she would be in the
evening, and it was unlikely that she would be doing business with wall-papers
in the early morning. On the whole, then, the evidence seemed to point to the
crime having been committed upon the Monday evening some time after seven.
There had been no forcing of doors or windows, and therefore the murderer had
been admitted by Mrs. Emsley. It was not consistent with her habits that she
should admit anyone whom she did not know at such an hour, and the presence of
the wall-papers showed that it was someone with whom she had business to
transact. So far the police could hardly go wrong. The murderer appeared to
have gained little by his crime, for the only money in the house, &pound;48,
was found concealed in the cellar, and nothing was missing save a few articles
of no value. For weeks the public waited impatiently for an arrest, and for
weeks the police remained silent though not inactive. Then an arrest was at
last effected, and in a curiously dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>Amongst the numerous people who made small sums of money by helping the
murdered woman there was one respectable-looking man, named George Mullins
&mdash;rather over fifty years of age, with the straight back of a man who has
at some period been well drilled. As a matter of fact, he had served in the
Irish Constabulary, and had undergone many other curious experiences before he
had settled down as a plasterer in the East-end of London. This man it was who
called upon Sergeant Tanner, of the police, and laid before him a statement
which promised to solve the whole mystery.</p>
<p>According to this account, Mullins had from the first been suspicious of
Emms, the cobbler, and had taken steps to verify his suspicions, impelled
partly by his love of justice and even more by his hope of the reward. The
&pound;300 bulked largely before his eyes. 'If this only goes right I'll take
care of you,' said he, on his first interview with the police, and added, in
allusion to his own former connection with the force, that he 'was clever at
these matters.' So clever was he that his account of what he had seen and done
gave the police an excellent clue upon which to act.</p>
<p>It appears that the cobbler dwelt in a small cottage at the edge of an old
brick-field. On this brick-field, and about fifty yards from the cottage, there
stood a crumbling outhouse which had been abandoned. Mullins, it seems, had for
some time back been keeping a watchful eye upon Emms, and he had observed him
carrying a paper parcel from his cottage and concealing it somewhere in the
shed. 'Very likely,' said the astute Mullins, 'he is concealing some of the
plunder which he has stolen.' To the police also the theory seemed not
impossible, and so, on the following morning, three of them, with Mullins
hanging at their heels, appeared at Emms's cottage, and searched both it and
the shed. Their efforts, however, were in vain, and nothing was found.</p>
<p><a id="pic-me3" name="pic-me3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<img src="0600441h-images/MrsEmsley-03.jpg" title=
"Illustration by Sidney Paget" style="float:right">
<p>This result was by no means satisfactory to the observant Mullins, who rated
them soundly for not having half-searched the shed, and persuaded them to try
again. They did so under his supervision, and this time with the best results.
Behind a slab in the outhouse they came on a paper parcel of a very curious
nature. It was tied up with coarse tape, and when opened disclosed another
parcel tied with waxed string. Within were found three small spoons and one
large one, two lenses, and a cheque drawn in favour of Mrs. Emsley, and known
to have been paid to her upon the day of the murder. There was no doubt that
the other articles had also belonged to the dead woman. The discovery was of
the first importance then, and the whole party set off for the police-station,
Emms covered with confusion and dismay, while Mullins swelled with all the
pride of the successful amateur detective. But his triumph did not last long.
At the police-station the inspector charged him with being himself concerned in
the death of Mrs. Emsley.</p>
<p>'Is this the way that I am treated after giving you information?' he
cried.</p>
<p>'If you are innocent no harm will befall you,' said the inspector, and he
was duly committed for trial.</p>
<p>This dramatic turning of the tables caused the deepest public excitement,
and the utmost abhorrence was everywhere expressed against the man who was
charged not only with a very cold-blooded murder, but with a deliberate attempt
to saddle another man with the guilt in the hope of receiving the reward. It
was very soon seen that Emms at least was innocent, as he could prove the most
convincing alibi. But if Emms was innocent who was guilty save the man who had
placed the stolen articles in the outhouse? and who could this be save Mullins,
who had informed the police that they were there? The case was prejudged by the
public before ever the prisoner had appeared in the dock, and the evidence
which the police had prepared against him was not such as to cause them to
change their opinion. A damning series of facts were arraigned in proof of
their theory of the case, and they were laid before the jury by Serjeant Parry
at the Central Criminal Court upon the 25th of October, about ten weeks after
the murder.</p>
<p>At first sight the case against Mullins appeared to be irresistible. An
examination of his rooms immediately after his arrest enabled the police to
discover some tape upon his mantelpiece which corresponded very closely with
the tape with which the parcel had been secured. There were thirty-two strands
in each. There was also found a piece of cobbler's wax, such as would be needed
to wax the string of the inner parcel. Cobbler's wax was not a substance which
Mullins needed in his business, so that time theory of the prosecution was that
he had simply procured it in order to throw suspicion upon the unfortunate
cobbler. A plasterer's hammer, which might have inflicted the injuries, was
also discovered upon the premises, and so was a spoon which corresponded
closely to the spoons which Mrs. Emsley had lost. It was shown also that Mrs.
Mullins had recently sold a small gold pencil-case to a neighbouring barman,
and two witnesses were found to swear that this pencil-case belonged to Mrs.
Emsley and had been in her possession a short time before her death. There was
also discovered a pair of boots, one of which appeared to fit the impression
upon the floor, and medical evidence attested that there was some human hair
upon the sole of it. The same medical evidence swore to a blood mark upon the
gold pencil which had been sold by Mrs. Mullins. It was proved by the
charwoman, who came upon Saturdays, that when she had been in the house two
days before the murder Mullins had called, bringing with him some rolls of
wall-paper, and that he had been directed by Mrs. Emsley to carry it up to the
room in which the tragedy afterwards occurred. Now, it was clear that Mrs.
Emsley had been discussing wall-papers at the time that she was struck down,
and what more natural than that it should have been with the person who had
originally brought them? Again, it had been shown that during the day Mrs.
Emsley had handed to Mullins a certain key. This key was found lying in the
same room as the dead body, and the prosecution asked how it could have come
there if Mullins did not bring it.</p>
<p>So far the police had undoubtedly a very strong case, and they endeavoured
to make it more convincing still by producing evidence to show that Mullins had
been seen both going to the crime and coming away from it. One, Raymond, was
ready to swear that at eight o'clock that evening he had caught a glimpse of
him in the street near Mrs. Emsley's. He was wearing a black billy-cock hat. A
sailor was produced who testified that he had seen him at Stepney Green a
little after five next morning. According to the sailor's account his attention
was attracted by the nervous manner and excited appearance of the man whom he
had met, and also by the fact that his pockets were very bulging. He was
wearing a brown hat. When he heard of the murder he had of his own accord given
information to the police, and he would swear that Mullins was the man whom he
had seen.</p>
<p>This was the case as presented against the accused, and it was fortified by
many smaller points of suspicion. One of them was that when he was giving the
police information about Emms he had remarked that Emms was about the only man
to whom Mrs. Emsley would open her door.</p>
<p>'Wouldn't she open it for you, Mullins?' asked the policeman.</p>
<p>'No,' said he. 'She would have called to me from the window of the
area.'</p>
<p>This answer of his&mdash;which was shown to be untrue&mdash;told very
heavily against him at the trial.</p>
<p>It was a grave task which Mr. Best had to perform when he rose to answer
this complicated and widely-reaching indictment. He first of all endeavoured to
establish an alibi by calling Mullins's children, who were ready to testify
that he came home particularly early upon that particular Monday. Their
evidence, however, was not very conclusive, and was shaken by the laundress,
who showed that they were confusing one day with another. As regards the boot,
the counsel pointed out that human hair was used by plasterers in their work,
and he commented upon the failure of the prosecution to prove that there was
blood upon the very boot which was supposed to have produced the blood-print.
He also showed as regards the bloodstain upon the pencil-case that the barman
upon buying the pencil had carefully cleaned and polished it, so that if there
was any blood upon it, it was certainly not that of Mrs. Emsley. He also
commented upon the discrepancy of the evidence between Raymond, who saw the
accused at eight in the evening in a black hat, and the sailor who met him at
five in the morning in a brown one. If the theory of the prosecution was that
the accused had spent the night in the house of the murdered woman, how came
his hat to be changed? One or other or both the witnesses must be worthless.
Besides, the sailor had met his mysterious stranger at Stepney Green, which was
quite out of the line between the scene of the crime and Mullins's
lodgings.</p>
<p>As to the bulging pockets, only a few small articles had been taken from the
house, and they would certainly not cause the robbers pockets to bulge. There
was no evidence either from Raymond or from the sailor that the prisoner was
carrying the plasterer's hammer with which the deed was supposed to have been
done.</p>
<p>And now he produced two new and very important witnesses, whose evidence
furnished another of those sudden surprises with which the case had abounded.
Mrs. Barnes, who lived in Grove Road, opposite to the scene of the murder, was
prepared to swear that at twenty minutes to ten on Tuesday morning
&mdash;twelve hours after the time of the commission of the crime, according to
the police theory&mdash;she saw someone moving paper-hangings in the top room,
and that she also saw the right-hand window open a little way. Now, in either
of these points she might be the victim of a delusion, but it is difficult to
think that she was mistaken in them both. If there was really someone in the
room at that hour, whether it was Mrs. Emsley or her assassin, in either case
it proved the theory of the prosecution to be entirely mistaken.</p>
<p><a id="pic-me4" name="pic-me4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<img src="0600441h-images/MrsEmsley-04.jpg" title=
"Illustration by Sidney Paget" style="float:right">
<p>The second piece of evidence was from Stephenson, a builder, who testified
that upon that Tuesday morning he had seen one Rowland, also a builder, come
out of some house with wall-papers in his hand. This was a little after ten
o'clock. He could not swear to the house, but he thought that it was Mrs.
Emsley's. Rowland was hurrying past him when he stopped him and asked him
&mdash;they were acquaintances&mdash;whether he was in the paper line.</p>
<p>'Yes; didn't you know that?' said Rowland.</p>
<p>'No,' said Stephenson, 'else I should have given you a job or two.'</p>
<p>'Oh, yes, I was bred up to it,' said Rowland, and went on his way.</p>
<p>In answer to this Rowland appeared in the box and stated that he considered
Stephenson to be half-witted. He acknowledged the meeting and the conversation,
but asserted that it was several days before. As a matter of fact, he was
engaged in papering the house next to Mrs. Emsley's, and it was from that that
he had emerged.</p>
<p>So stood the issues when the Chief Baron entered upon the difficult task of
summing up. Some of the evidence upon which the police had principally relied
was brushed aside by him very lightly. As to the tape, most tape consisted of
thirty-two strands, and it appeared to him that the two pieces were not exactly
of one sort. Cobbler's wax was not an uncommon substance, and a plasterer could
not be blamed for possessing a plasterer's hammer. The boot, too, was not so
exactly like the blood-print that any conclusions could be drawn from it. The
weak point of the defense was that it was almost certain that Mullins hid the
things in the shed. If he did not commit the crime, why did he not volunteer a
statement as to how the things came into his possession? His remark that Mrs.
Emsley would not open the door to him, when it was certain that she would do
so, was very much against him. On the other hand, the conflicting evidence of
the sailor and of the other man who had seen Mullins near the scene of the
crime was not very convincing, nor did he consider the incident of the key to
be at all conclusive, since the key might have been returned in the course of
the day. On the whole, everything might be got round except the hiding of the
parcel in the shed, and that was so exceedingly damning that, even without
anything else, it amounted to a formidable case.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for three hours and then brought in a verdict of
'Guilty,' in which the judge concurred. Some of his words, however, in passing
sentence were such as to show that his mind was by no means convinced upon the
point.</p>
<p><a id="pic-me5" name="pic-me5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="0600441h-images/MrsEmsley-05.jpg" title=
"Illustration by Sidney Paget"></div>
<br>
<p>'If you can even now make it manifest that you are innocent of the charge,'
said he, 'I do not doubt that every attention will be paid to any cogent proof
laid before those with whom it rests to carry out the finding of the law.'</p>
<p>To allude to the possibility of a man's innocence and at the same time to
condemn him to be hanged strikes the lay mind as being a rather barbarous and
illogical proceeding. It is true that the cumulative force of the evidence
against Mullins was very strong, and that investigation proved the man's
antecedents to have been of the worst. But still, circumstantial evidence, even
when it all points one way and there is nothing to be urged upon the other
side, cannot be received with too great caution, for it is nearly always
possible to twist it to some other meaning.</p>
<p>In this case, even allowing that the evidence for an alibi furnished by
Mullins's children was worthless, and allowing also that Mr. Stephenson's
evidence may be set aside, there remains the positive and absolutely
disinterested testimony of Mrs. Barnes, which would seem to show that even if
Mullins did the crime he did it in an entirely different way to that which the
police imagined. Besides, is it not on the face of it most improbable that a
man should commit a murder at eight o'clock or so in the evening, should remain
all night in the house with the body of his victim, that he should do this in
the dark&mdash;for a light moving about the house would have been certainly
remarked by the neighbours&mdash;that he should not escape during the darkness,
but that he should wait for the full sunlight of an August morning before he
emerged?</p>
<p>After reading the evidence one is left with an irresistible impression that,
though Mullins was very likely guilty, the police were never able to establish
the details of the crime, and that there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice
when the death sentence was carried out.</p>
<p>There was much discussion among the legal profession at the time as to the
sufficiency of the evidence, but the general public was quite satisfied, for
the crime was such a shocking one that universal prejudice was excited against
the accused. Mullins was hanged on the 19th of November, and he left a
statement behind him reaffirming his own innocence. He never attempted to
explain the circumstances which cost him his life, but he declared in his last
hours that he believed Emms to be innocent of the murder, which some have taken
to be a confession that he had himself placed the incriminating articles in the
shed. Forty years have served to throw no fresh light upon the matter.</p>

<br>
<p>WILLIAM ROSE. I am a solicitor residing in Victoria-park square&mdash;I knew
Mrs. Mary Emsley, who lived at 9, Grove-road&mdash;she was a client of mine,
and had been so for some years prior to her death&mdash;she was possessed of
considerable house property in that neighbourhood&mdash;she collected a great
part of her rents herself from weekly tenants&mdash;she lived alone, without
any servant&mdash;I know a person of the name of Walter Emm&mdash;he
occasionally assisted her in the collection of rents&mdash;On Friday, 17th
August, Emm called on me and made a communication to me&mdash;I did not go with
him, but sent him, and appointed to meet him at the house in Grove-road&mdash;I
met Dillon there&mdash;the door of the house was fastened when we got
there&mdash;we knocked at the front door and there was no admittance to be
gained&mdash;I then desired the constable to get over the garden wall at the
back&mdash;he did so, and said the door was open, and I went over the wall and
followed him in the same way&mdash;we went through the house&mdash;we found no
person on the ground floor&mdash;the door of the parlour was open, and the back
window appeared to be a little open&mdash;there is a front and back parlour;
they open from the one to the other, and form one room&mdash;we then went up on
to the first floor&mdash;the door of the front bedroom on the first floor was
open&mdash;that was the room used by the deceased as her bedroom&mdash;there is
a small back room as well with lumber in it&mdash;the bed appeared not to have
been slept in&mdash;we then went up stairs to the second floor&mdash;the door
of the front room was open, and I there saw the body of Mrs. Emsley, with her
head towards the landing, near the doorway&mdash;the body was lying so much in
the doorway as to prevent the door from closing&mdash;you could scarcely enter
the room without treading over the body&mdash;there was a bundle of papers for
papering rooms in front of her, and two pieces of paper under her arm&mdash;Dr.
Gill was then sent for at my request; he came almost immediately&mdash;the
deceased remained in the position in which she was lying until the doctor came,
at my request, she was not disturbed in any way&mdash;when I was there that day
I noticed this key (<i>produced</i>)&mdash;it is a remarkable one&mdash;I saw
it in the bedroom of the deceased, on the first floor&mdash;that is the room
underneath that in which she was found dead&mdash;the key was on the
table&mdash;there was a table in the bed-room next to the window, and I am not
sure whether it was not in a basket, I think it was&mdash;there was some
biscuit in the basket, and I think some other keys, but I noticed that key
particularly on account of the bow being remarkable.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. BEST (<i>with</i> MR. PALMER). <i>Q.</i> You
have known the prisoner, I believe? <i>A.</i> I don't think I ever saw him till
he was in custody; I think that was the first time I ever saw him; to my
knowledge I had never seen him before&mdash;I think Mrs. Emsley bad a person of
the name of Rowland who assisted her in the collection of rents&mdash;I never
heard of a man of the name of Wright&mdash;I am not sure that a person of the
name of Wilson, of Ratcliffe, did not collect some rents&mdash;he is a tenant
of hers&mdash;I have no personal knowledge of that&mdash;the fastening to the
front door was a common lock and a latch-key lock&mdash;I looked at the street
door and found that the door had been apparently pulled to&mdash;it was not
fastened inside&mdash;there are bolts inside&mdash;those were not
fastened&mdash;there did not appear to have been any force at all&mdash;there
was a great quantity of blood about in this room where we found the deceased
lying&mdash;not all over her; there was a pool of blood; I did not notice
particularly as to any splashes about the room&mdash;the smell and appearance
was so offensive I did not enter the room to examine it minutely.</p>
<p>EDWARD DILLON (<i>Police-sergeant, K 19</i>). On Friday, 17th August, I was
called by a man, of the name of Emm, to No. 9, Grove-road&mdash;I went there
and found Mr. Rose, Mr. Faith, Mr. Whitaker, and Mr. Biggs, waiting outside the
house&mdash;I gained admittance at the next door, and passed over the back wall
to the back yard of the deceased's house-I found the back door shut, on the
latch&mdash;the front door was shut on the spring-lock, but not double-locked;
it would double-lock&mdash;there were no bolts drawn&mdash;a person going out
and pulling the front door after him would leave it securely latched&mdash;I
next went into the back parlour, and saw the back window raised up four or five
inches&mdash;the shutters were closed but not fastened; not bolted&mdash;I saw
the front parlour window shutters down and the curtains drawn back&mdash;I went
into the front parlour; the curtains were drawn back and the shutters open; the
window was fastened by a catch above&mdash;I next proceeded to the first floor
front room&mdash;I saw a bed there which did not appear to have been slept in
recently; the bed was not made-the right hand window-blind in the room was
drawn down and the left drawn up-I then went into the back room on the same
floor, which was filled with lumber and a quantity of paper hangings&mdash;I
then went up stairs, and saw the deceased lying dead in the front
room&mdash;that was on the floor above the front bed-room&mdash;the left hand
window in the room was raised up a few inches, the right hand window was
down&mdash;the deceased was lying on her left side, with her head against the
door-post; her face was towards the boards, downwards, on the left
side&mdash;there were a quantity of paper-hangings in that room and a quantity
behind the deceased's back; there were several pieces near her head&mdash;I
noticed the floor of the landing outside, and observed a footprint in the
blood&mdash;I was not present when the piece of board was cut out&mdash;Dr.
Gill was then sent for&mdash;I remained there till he came&mdash;everything was
left in the same state as I have described it until Dr. Gill made his
appearance&mdash;from the direction of the footprint the foot would be coming
from the room&mdash;I examined all the bolts of the doors and shutters in the
house&mdash;I discovered no marks whatever of any violent entry having been
made&mdash;I afterwards made a search of the rooms below, and found a gold
mourning ring between the bed-tick and mattress&mdash;the ring is in Court; my
inspector has it&mdash;I found that in the first-floor, in the bed room; it
bore the inscription of Samuel Emsley, Esq.&mdash;I also saw three half-pence
in coppers on a chair&mdash;I gave the ring to Inspector Kerrison&mdash;I
remained on the premises till I was relieved&mdash;the garden of the house is
surrounded by walls&mdash;the gardens of the houses at the back of the houses
in Grove-road abut on the garden of the house of the deceased on either
side&mdash;there is no road between&mdash;the houses in Grove-street are at the
back of the Grove-road houses&mdash;the back door of No. 9 has a glass window
in it.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> You went to this room where you found the
deceased lying, did you observe whether there was much blood about it?
<i>A.</i> A great quantity of blood&mdash;there were a great many splashes
about the floor and the wall, as if the blood had spurted out from the person
who had been struck.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did you notice the direction in which the
blood appeared to have flowed? <i>A.</i> It appeared to have flowed in front of
the woman from the position I found her in, and a great quantity splashed
behind her.</p>
<p>SAMUEL LAWRENCE GILL. I am a member of the Edinburgh College of Physicians,
and a surgeon of London&mdash;I was called in to see the deceased&mdash;I found
her lying at full length on her left side, with the face turned a little more
to the left, towards the boards&mdash;she was dressed&mdash;there was no sign
of her having made any preparation for going to bed&mdash;the first wound which
presented itself to my notice was a large opening in the back of the skull,
extending deeply into the brain&mdash;I think that was the result of repeated
blows&mdash;that wound alone was quite sufficient to account for
death&mdash;there were a great number of minute portions of the skull carried
completely within the brain and packed under the other portion of the skull,
into the interior of the substance of the brain, and deposited within the upper
portion of the skull&mdash;the posterior portion of the cerebrum would be
immediately exposed to that injury, the posterior portion of the big brain, and
of the little brain also, the opening was so large&mdash;there were several
other wounds which would have caused death besides that one&mdash;the wound
over the left ear would have caused death&mdash;it was a contused wound, and
the whole of the temporal bone on that side was driven in; that also being in
small fragments&mdash;there was also a blow above the other ear, that was a
contused wound&mdash;there was no wound in the scalp on that side, but there
had evidently been a heavy blow on that side&mdash;there was also what we
should almost term a lacerated wound above the left eyebrow, and another, wound
in the left ear, also a lacerated wound&mdash;before I saw this hammer
(<i>produced</i>) I had formed an opinion as to the character of the instrument
with which these blows were inflicted&mdash;the wound, which was the result of
repeated blows, might have been inflicted with the blunt side of this
hammer&mdash;I had an opportunity of seeing whether the hammer fitted the wound
on the eyebrow; the blade, of the hammer corresponded with the length of that
wound&mdash;I consider it was. such a wound as might have been inflicted by the
thin end of that hammer&mdash;I noticed a quantity of blood; there was a pool
on the floor which had flowed from the body, from one point, passing away from
her into the room from the doorway&mdash;from the place where the head was, the
room was. inclined&mdash;I noticed a mark of blood on the under part of her
petticoat, but, of course, external, as the petticoat was drawn upwards over
the head&mdash;it was a superficial smear&mdash;it appeared to me as if
something had been wiped on it</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Could you form any opinion from the
appearance of the wounds which wound was inflicted first? <i>A.</i> It would be
a mere, matter of opinion, but I should rather think that the wound on the
temple had been inflicted first; that appeared to have been one blow&mdash;the
body was slightly decomposed when I saw it&mdash;the face was very slightly
decomposed&mdash;I don't think the incised wound on the eyebrow was as. much
decomposed as the opposite side of the face&mdash;there were indications of
decomposition going on, certainly&mdash;the effect of decomposition, under some
circumstances, would be to cause a wound to expand, to gape&mdash;I don't
consider that it was at all distended from decomposition, because it was
comparatively dry&mdash;in this case the wound would gape slightly,
certainly&mdash;I forget how long after my first examination this hammer was
shown to me; I should think a week, perhaps more&mdash;I have not the slightest
recollection; it might have been a fortnight; I don't bear it in mind&mdash;I
did not compare the hammer with the body&mdash;I measured the wound over the
eyebrow, and probed the depth of it with my finger&mdash;I form my opinion as
to the instrument which inflicted the wounds from the appearance of the wounds
and from being accustomed to see wounds inflicted by all sorts of
instruments&mdash;a piece of iron, an iron bar, sharp at the end, would,
undoubtedly produce such wounds as these&mdash;I should think it possible,
certainly, that the wounds at the back of the head might have been done with a
larger instrument than this&mdash;I considered they could have been done with a
hammer&mdash;the wound at the back of the head was considerably greater than
this part of the hammer; it was some inches in size&mdash;I should imagine that
whatever instrument was used there would be a considerable quantity of blood on
it.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Could large wounds, larger than any single
wound, have been inflicted by that hammer by repeated blows? <i>A.</i> By
repeated blows&mdash;I measured the wound on the eyebrow; it was an inch and a
half long&mdash;all I say is that this hammer might have inflicted the
wounds&mdash;I gave it as my opinion when I saw the body that she had been
dead, in all probability, three or four days&mdash;I saw her on Friday in the
middle of the day&mdash;what I saw and observed was quite consistent with an
attack on Monday, 13th August.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> You say her appearance was consistent with her being
wounded on the Monday; that what happened to her might have happened on Monday?
<i>A.</i> Quite likely&mdash;I could not fix within a day either way&mdash;it
might have been on Monday evening, or Tuesday morning, or on the
Sunday&mdash;it would depend on the state of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH PASHLEY. I reside at 16, Grove-road, immediately opposite No. 9,
where Mrs. Emsley used to live&mdash;I have lived there twelve years&mdash;I
last saw her alive on Monday evening, August 13th, between 7 and 8 o'clock,
sitting at her first-floor window&mdash;she usually went to bed about 10, or
even before, I have seen her, but usually about 10&mdash;the shutters of her
house were always closed by dusk&mdash;I never saw them open after dusk&mdash;I
noticed her house about 12 o'clock on the night of 13th August&mdash;the
shutters were open&mdash;my attention was attracted by it; I thought it
remarkable&mdash;I observed the house early the next morning, about daybreak;
it was not quite light&mdash;the shutters were not closed&mdash;the blinds were
just the same as they were on the Monday&mdash;the first floor blind was
down&mdash;the window even with it was up rather more than half-way&mdash;one
blind was pulled down and the other blind was rather more than half-way
up&mdash;there were no blinds on the second floor&mdash;one of the windows of
the second floor was slightly open&mdash;I saw a person on the Wednesday knock
at the door three times&mdash;I observed other persons knocking, but I do Dot
know which days they were&mdash;when persons knocked at the door of the
deceased she would open the first-floor window, where she usually sat, and look
out and speak to them from the window&mdash;she would sometimes speak to them
from the area, which is grated over&mdash;there was no access into the house by
the area&mdash;she would only let those persons in who were in the habit of
going there, or who worked then&mdash;if she knew them she would come down or
answer them from the window, but she always looked out from the window
first</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> There was nobody in the house with her?
<i>A.</i> No; she never kept any servants in my experience&mdash;I do not know
how many persons were in the habit of visiting her during the day&mdash;she was
generally out in the day&mdash;only a very few work people went into the
house&mdash;I can't say how many; not so many as a dozen&mdash;she never had
any tradespeople&mdash;I have seen a paperhanger go in&mdash;I have seen Mr.
Rowland go in, and Mr. Emm&mdash;I do not know Mr. Wilson, or Mr.
Wright&mdash;I have seen others go in but they would be persons who were
bringing things to the house, and I know she knew them.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH FRANCES MUGGERIDGE. I live at 17, Grove-road, nearly opposite the
house of the deceased, Mrs. Emsley&mdash;On Monday, 13th August, I saw her
about 7 o'clock in the evening, sitting at her first-floor bedroom
window&mdash;I did not observe her doing anything&mdash;I noticed the house
again that night between 10 and 11&mdash;the parlour shutters were open and one
of the curtains was drawn further back than usual, and the first-floor bedroom
window was half-way up; the shutters being open at that time was an unusual
circumstance&mdash;I had noticed it was her habit to close her shutters at
dusk, had also observed that when persons called on her she would look out at
the window or answer them up the area&mdash;on Wednesday morning, about 11
o'clock, I saw a man and woman call at the house&mdash;they knocked several
times at the door and gained no admittance&mdash;I did not observe any one else
particularly after that</p>
<p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am in Mr. Linsell's service, a draper in the Mile-end-
road&mdash;I did not know Mrs. Emsley myself&mdash;I remember having to take a
message there on Tuesday, the 14th August, about half-past 8 in the
morning&mdash;I was sent by my master&mdash;I knocked at the door for about
five minutes, loud, so that anybody must have heard, if there had been anybody
in the house&mdash;I then went away and returned again in the evening between 8
and 9; I knocked again and failed to gain admittance&mdash;I looked through the
key hole to see if I could see anybody.</p>
<p>JOHN COOK. I reside at Peckham, and am a builder&mdash;On 14th August, a
little after 10 in the morning, I called at 9, Grove-road, at the house of Mrs.
Emsley, about some paper hangings&mdash;I expected to buy some&mdash;I had
received a note on the 10th, saying that she had some to dispose of&mdash;I
knocked at the door three times and got no admittance&mdash;I then walked away
round the square, and about, and came again, knocked and got no admittance.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>, <i>Q.</i> Had you known this old lady before?
<i>A.</i> About two years&mdash;I had not had dealings with her for
paper-hangings before this&mdash;I am building on her ground and therefore she
often came to see me&mdash;I think it was the last day in July she was at my
house.</p>
<p>EDWIN EMM. I am the son of Walter Thomas Emm, a shoemaker, living at Mr.
Emsley's brick-fields, Bethnal-green&mdash;I knew the deceased&mdash;on Monday,
13th August last, I was sent by my father to her house for some brass
taps&mdash;I did not go that day, I went on the following day and knocked at
the door of the house.</p>
<p>RICHARD TANNER. I am a sergeant of the detective police&mdash;I know the
prisoner; I have only known him since the murder&mdash;I was employed to
investigate this murder, with Inspector Thornton and Sergeant Thomas&mdash;I
had seen the prisoner previous to his making a communication to me, about 28th
August, as near as I can recollect; it was the latter end of August&mdash;he
was fetched from his lodgings by Sergeant Thomas, and Mr. Thornton and myself
had a consultation with him in reference to the murder of Mrs. Emsley&mdash;we
sent for him for the purpose of making inquiries&mdash;on Saturday, 8th
September, about 6 o'clock, he came to my house in Wood-street,
Westminster&mdash;he did not wear spectacles when he came to me&mdash;he said,
"I am come to give you some information; I have been to Mr. Thornton's and he
is out"&mdash;I asked him into my room and he said, "You know, Sergeant Tanner,
that since I saw you and Inspector Thornton, I have had my suspicions about the
man who committed the murder, and I have been watching him"&mdash;I said,
"Before you go any farther, Mullins, who is it 1s.; he replied, "Emms"&mdash;I
believe his name is Emm, but he said "Emms"&mdash;he said, "This morning I went
to Emsley's brick-field at 5 o'clock, and I remained there watching Emms,
pretending to be picking herbs, and between 8 and 9 o'clock I saw Emms come out
of his house and go to a ruined cottage about fifty yards in front of his
house; he brought out from then a large parcel, took it indoors, remained about
ten minutes, came out again, appeared to be looking about him, and he had a
small parcel in his hand about the size of a pint pot; he went to a shed or a
lean-to adjoining big own house, went inside, remained about two minutes, came
out again with, out the parcel and went indoors"&mdash;I said, "What do you
think the parcel contained?"&mdash;he said, "I can't tell"&mdash;I then left my
own home with him and went to Mr. Thornton's residence which is close
by&mdash;he said nothing else before we went to Mr. Thornton's&mdash;he said
nothing about where the parcel was put, further than what I have
stated&mdash;he did not then give any information about where the parcel was
put&mdash;we went to Thornton's&mdash;he was not at home&mdash;I walked with
him then as far as Palace-yard&mdash;I asked him if he would have some
refreshment and he did; we had a glass of ale&mdash;when we came out, on
parting he said, "Now don't go without me"&mdash;he desired to go that
night&mdash;I said, "No, I can't go to-night"&mdash;I had a motive, Mr.
Thornton was not there and he had charge of the case&mdash;I think I said, "Mr.
Thornton is not at home; I can't go without him"&mdash;he then said, "Now don't
go without me"&mdash;I said, "No, you know I have taken down the substance of
your statement, in writing in a book, and no advantage shall be taken of your
information; I hope you think we are beyond that"&mdash;he said, "Very
well"&mdash;I said, "I will go with you tomorrow morning; I will send a
sergeant for you, where shall I send for you?"&mdash;he said, "To 17,
Oakum-street, Chelsea"&mdash;a reward had been offered at that time&mdash;I
have got a bill (<i>producing one</i>) similar to those which were posted and
placarded about&mdash;it was posted all over London; first a reward of
100<i>l.</i> and then of 300<i>l.</i>&mdash;Mullins was aware of the reward
having been offered&mdash;he said on parting, "Don't go without me; if it comes
off all right I will take care of you"&mdash;that is the substance of what
passed between us that night&mdash;I went the next morning to Emsley's
brick-field with Inspector Thornton, Sergeant Thomas, and the prisoner&mdash;we
went in a cab&mdash;nothing passed with me, I was outside; Thornton and Thomas
were inside with him&mdash;this plan (<i>produced</i>) appears very
correct&mdash;there is a shed by the side of Emm's cottage in which ultimately
the parcel was found&mdash;there is a ruined house shown here; that is about
fifty yards from Emm's cottage&mdash;it was about midday on Sunday morning when
we arrived there&mdash;the ruin is a perfect wreck; it is a very old
dilapidated cottage, in fact, there is a hole in the wall where any person ean
go in&mdash;there is a door to the shed by Emm's cottage, but the lower half of
it is gone, there is only the top portion complete&mdash;it was open&mdash;it
appears that anybody, at any time, could have got into that shed&mdash;at the
time we arrived on that morning the shed was open, and there was a slab of
stone just against the side of it&mdash;that is shown on the plan&mdash;this
field, which is called Emsley's brick-field, is an open field; persons have no
right there, but they can get in very easily&mdash;the palings appear to be
knocked down&mdash;there is room enough for any person to go in&mdash;there is
a gate also which I found open, but independent of that, there are gaps in the
palings which appear to have been knocked down, and any person can get
in&mdash;we arrived in Bonner's-lane, myself, Thornton, and Thomas were walking
down Bonner's-lane, and through a gap in the place we saw Emm and a man
standing in conversation&mdash;they were at the other end of the field from
Emm's house, at the extreme end, I should say quite 200 yards&mdash;we told
Mullins to remain as it were about here (<i>pointing to the plan</i>), out of
the field entirely so as not to be seen&mdash;we all three went to Emm; he was
called aside, and Mr. Thornton made some communication to him in my
presence&mdash;he was told the accusation in substance, that Mullins had
made&mdash;we did not tell him that Mullins had made it&mdash;I then went, by
the direction' of Inspector Thornton, to Emm's house and searched it&mdash;I
spoke to Mrs. Emm&mdash;Emm was not there then, he was left with Mr.
Thornton&mdash;we looked in the shed and at that time found nothing&mdash;we
then went back to Mr. Thornton to report the result of our mission, and at that
period Mullins appeared in the field, within fifty yards of us&mdash;I found
Thornton and Emm had advanced to the ruined cottage; they were standing in
front of it&mdash;at the time I saw Mullins in the field I went to him, and on
my approach he said, "You have not half searched the place, she (meaning, I
suppose, Mm. Emm) had her back to you all the while; come, I will show you
where I think it is put"&mdash;I said, "No, not now; we don't want Emm to know
you are the informant," and in the conversation we walked round between a stack
of bricks and another old shed which is in the field&mdash;we halted four or
five yards in front of the identical shed which he alluded to as where he saw
Emm put the parcel, and he said, "There, look now, go and pull down that
b&mdash;slab and turn up those bricks"&mdash;I looked at him and retired with
him from the spot&mdash;I did not go towards the shed&mdash;I came back some
twenty yards&mdash;I spoke to Sergeant Thomas and desired him to go and pull
down the stone, at the same time telling Mullins to go to the Rising Sail and
wait for me&mdash;Thomas went to the stone and returned to where Thornton, Emm,
and I were&mdash;Thornton and Emm were still in front of the ruin&mdash;I saw
Thomas pull the stone on one side, and saw him bring out the parcel&mdash;the
slab is shown on the plan, we had simply to pull the stone forward and take it
out; anyone could have placed it there without going into the shed&mdash;the
parcel was opened in the presence of Emm&mdash;I cannot speak to its condition
so well as Thomas; he handled it and undid it&mdash;I did not handle it in its
original state&mdash;I saw it opened and saw what it contained&mdash;this is
the outer paper; it was tied round the same as it is now, with this piece of
tape&mdash;it is a piece of tape which might form an apron string or anything
of that sort; besides that there was an inner parcel&mdash;this is it, it was
tied as it is now, with a piece of shoemaker's waxed string&mdash;it contained
some pieces of newspaper, some blotting paper, one metal table spoon, and three
metal tea spoons, and these two lenses or magnifying glasses; two of the spoons
are lettered "W. P."&mdash;besides these there was a cheque for 10<i>l.</i> on
the Bank of London&mdash;this is it&mdash;that cheque is described in the
handbill as a cheque drawn by Pickering and Carrier on the Bank of London,
dated August 14th, 1860&mdash;those were all the contents of the parcel&mdash;I
was then directed to fetch Mullins back from the public-house, which I did,
leaving Thornton, Thomas, and Emm still in front of the ruined
shed&mdash;Mullins came back and stood in front of an old waggon that was
there&mdash;he said, "Have you found anything?"&mdash;he appeared delighted,
rubbed his hands, and laughed, and said, "Have you found any
b&mdash;money?"&mdash;I said; "Thomas has found something, I cannot tell you
what; Emm is very ill"&mdash;he appeared to laugh, rubbed his hands and said,
"Oh, of course he would be"&mdash;I was then told to take him to the station in
Arbour-square, which I did&mdash;Emm was also taken&mdash;he was there charged
and Mullins also&mdash;he was charged by Inspector Thornton, in my presence,
the charge was taken down in writing&mdash;the charge sheet is not
here&mdash;it would be at Scotland-yard now&mdash;upon being charged, Mullins
said, "Is this the way I am to be served, after giving information?"&mdash;I
searched him&mdash;I found that his shoe was tied with a piece of waxed
string&mdash;I have it here; it is waxed with cobbler's wax&mdash;the string
round the parcel is waxed with cobbler's wax&mdash;I also found on him a
pocket-book and some spectacles, but nothing material to this case; the
spectacles were in his pocket&mdash;I afterwards went to 33, Barnsley-street,
where he occupied a room&mdash;I there found a piece of tape, which 1
produce.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Has that piece of tape been examined so as to ascertain the
number of threads it contains? <i>A.</i> It was examined by several gentlemen
on the coroner's jury who were drapers; I have not counted the number of
threads in it&mdash;Inspector Thornton was originally a draper&mdash;the piece
of tape at the extreme end of the parcel, I thought corresponded with this
piece&mdash;they appear to me to be the same tape&mdash;I think the short piece
at the end of the parcel, and this piece, correspond; they appear to be exactly
the same kind of tape.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> I believe you also produce a piece of wax that
you found on the chimney piece in the prisoner's room? <i>A.</i> Thomas found
that in my presence&mdash;I saw him take it from the chimney- piece&mdash;I was
also with Mr. Thornton when he found the hammer.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>, <i>Q.</i> If understand you rightly, you had been in
communication with the prisoner as early as 28th August? <i>A.</i> I think
about that time&mdash;a reward had been offered then; 300<i>l.</i>&mdash;the
whole of the reward had been offered then&mdash;it was offered on the 24th.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> The 300<i>l.</i> had been offered before you had any
communication with the prisoner? <i>A.</i> Yes.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> You have told us that you left him outside the field
while you went to search the shed. <i>A.</i> Yes; I supposed him during that
time to be where I had directed him to wait, outside the field&mdash;when I
afterward? saw him coming towards the shed, he was about fifty or sixty yards
from it; he could not from where he was, have seen what we had done inside the
shed&mdash;he could see us enter the shed&mdash;we remained there two minutes
probably, then he came up to us&mdash;he did not first call our attention to
the bricks which were lying about&mdash;he did not mention anything about
searching some bricks previous to telling us about the slab&mdash;I am sure he
did not, or about searching some wood&mdash;he afterwards said "Turn up those
bricks"&mdash;that was before we had found the parcel&mdash;Emm is by trade a
shoemaker&mdash;I found his tools in his house; his daughter was at
work&mdash;I examined his tools; I believe a shoemaker's hammer was amongst
them; I am not quite sure&mdash;I believe shoemakers use a hammer in their
trade&mdash;Sergeant Thomas searched that portion of the house.</p>
<p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I am a sergeant of the detective police&mdash;On Sunday
morning, 9th September, in consequence of instructions from Inspector Thornton,
I went to 17, Oakum-street, Chelsea, between 10 and 11 in the day; I found the
prisoner there&mdash;he came out of the house; I was just behind him&mdash;I
took a turn and met him, and beckoned to him when he saw me, and he followed me
into the Brompton-road&mdash;he spoke first to me, he said "Thomas, I took you
to be Tanner"&mdash;he said "You know that I am very elever in these matters, I
have been working hard, day and night to discover the murderer of Mrs. Emsley,
and I have found him out"&mdash;I said, "Who do you suspect?"&mdash;he said,
"The man Emm, who gave evidence on the coroner's inquest; he was suspected; no
one had better opportunity, as he was in the habit of taking small sums of
money, and would be admitted by Mrs. Emsley at any time"&mdash;I said,
"Mullins, would she admit you V&mdash;he said, "Oh, no, she would answer me
from the window, and up the area"&mdash;he said nothing more at that
time&mdash;I had seen him before and spoken to him before&mdash;I had not know
him for any number of years&mdash;I went with him to Scotland-yard, and then
went with him, Inspector Thornton, and Tanner, to Bethnal-green&mdash;as we
were going along in the cab, the prisoner and Thornton were in conversation,
and after they had stopped, I said, "Mullins, what sort of a parcel did you see
Emm place in the shed?"&mdash;he jumped up, put his hand into his coat pocket,
and withdrew a handkerchief, and rolled it up to about the same size as the
parcel, and said, "That is about the size."</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> And was that the size? <i>A.</i> Yes; I afterwards found
that to be the size.</p>
<p>MR. CLERK. <i>Q.</i> Was he telling Thornton in the cab what he had seen Emm
do? <i>A.</i> Thornton and the prisoner were in conversation, but I did not
bear all they said&mdash;When we got to the brick-field we went into the
brickfield&mdash;I went to the shed that had been spoken of, adjoining the
house&mdash;I looked into the shed, but did not disturb anything; I merely
looked into it&mdash;after that I went into the house and searched there; I saw
some papers relating to some property between the deceased and Emm&mdash;I then
returned to Inspector Thornton, and at that time Mullins made his appearance in
the field&mdash;I had taken him up Bonner's-lane, out of sight of Emm's place
altogether, and said, "Mullins, remain here till we send for you"&mdash;that
was about 150 yards from the place where I next saw him&mdash;he had some
conversation with Tanner in the field&mdash;I did not hear what
passed&mdash;Tanner then spoke to me, and from what he said I went again to the
shed, and removed a flagstone that was just inside the door, and there I found
a parcel, tied round with tape&mdash;it was behind the stone, between the stone
and the wall&mdash;at the bottom there were some bricks and rubbish&mdash;the
stone was buried about three or four inches outside and inside&mdash;the parcel
was on the top of the bricks, between the wall and the stone&mdash;the bricks
were not visible from outside, in the field, until I had removed the stone, not
what was behind the stone, not in the middle, where the parcel was&mdash;the
stone was two inches from the wall at the bottom part&mdash;it was standing
nearly against the wall, it leant towards the wall&mdash;the brick rubbish was
between the bottom of the stone and the wall&mdash;the brick rubbish was not
visible when I was outside in the field&mdash;when I took the parcel I brought
it to where Thornton was standing in the field&mdash;I spoked to Emm first,
before I untied the parcel&mdash;Mullins was not near enough to hear what was
said&mdash;I opened the parcel in Tanner's presence&mdash;it contained some
spoons, a cheque for 10<i>l.</i> and two lenses&mdash;I afterwards went to 33,
Barnsley-street, I went to the back room on the ground floor in that
house&mdash;I had been in that room before&mdash;the prisoner lived there; I
had seen him there&mdash;I there found a small bit of shoemaker's wax and a
small bit of twine, together on the mantelpiece&mdash;I produce them&mdash;the
street door of the house opens by a small bit of twine; anybody can open it
from the outside&mdash;the door of the prisoner's room was locked&mdash;I had
not the key with me; I broke it open&mdash;I afterwards went to the house, 17,
Oakum-street, from which I had seen the prisoner come&mdash;a person named
Kelly is the landlady of that house&mdash;I went into a back room there where I
found the prisoner's wife, and in that room I found a spoon, which I produce,
it has on the back of it the letters W. P.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> That is the ordinary trade mark, is it not?
<i>A.</i> I believe so&mdash;I believe it is the maker's mark&mdash;the spoons
are ordinary sort of German metal spoons, generally in use&mdash;there is a
slight difference between the appearance of the spoon found at the prisoner's
house, and the spoons found in the parcel&mdash;I should say the one found in
the house was worn more than those found in the parcel&mdash;two of those in
the parcel are alike, and one of those in the parcel and the one found in the
house are just the same pattern&mdash;when I come to look at the bowls they are
a different shape (<i>examining them</i>)&mdash;three are alike; the one found
in the house is similar to this&mdash;they are German silver&mdash;I first went
to the house in Barnsley-street, on Tuesday, 28th August&mdash;it is a very
small backroom where the prisoner lived, not very clean&mdash;I saw no one
there besides himself&mdash;there was a person living up stairs, an invalid,
whose name I do not know&mdash;there was no one down stairs&mdash;I do not know
how many rooms there are upstairs, there are three down&mdash;the prisoner
occupied one, no one occupied the others&mdash;that was the only room occupied
down stairs.</p>
<p>DR. GILL (<i>re-examined</i>). I have examined the ends of the two pieces of
tape produced&mdash;I have carefully counted the number of strands in
them&mdash;Tanner was present&mdash;he counted them before me, not letting me
know the number he counted; there are thirty-three strands in each.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> So that those two pieces are pieces of the same sort of
tape? <i>A.</i> They are in my opinion&mdash;that is all I can say.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> You are not engaged in the manufacture of tape, I
suppose? <i>A.</i> No; I have been in the habit of examining all fabrics, I
examine all things that I feel an interest in, under the microscope&mdash;I am
in the habit of examining cotton, silk, or anything, for my own private
investigation.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> It is a very beautiful investigation
sometimes, is it not, to examine fabrics? <i>A.</i> It is exceedingly
beautiful.</p>
<p>STEPHEN THORNTON. I am an inspector of the detective police&mdash;On
Saturday, 8th September, the prisoner called at my house&mdash;on the following
morning I went with Tanner, Thomas, and the prisoner, to Bethnal-green&mdash;as
we went along, the prisoner said he had been watching Emm, who had been living
in Mr. Emsley's brick-field, Bethnal-green, for some time, and on Saturday,
about half-past 8 in the morning, he saw him come out of his house, go to a
ruin or shed, about fifty yards from his house, bring out a parcel, and,
looking about him, go into his own house, that he was there a few minutes, then
came out with a smaller parcel, and went to a shed or lean-to adjoining his own
house, and was there about a minute, and then came out without the
parcel&mdash;he said the parcel that he fetched from his own house was a small
parcel about the size of a pint pot&mdash;I went to that
brickfield&mdash;directions were given to Thomas to search in the shed and the
house&mdash;the parcel was afterwards brought to me&mdash;Emm was not in good
health at that time; he seemed to be labouring from illness, and
suffering&mdash;had given instructions to Mullins as to where he was to
remain&mdash;I told him to remain outside the brick-field, and if we wanted him
we would send for him&mdash;I saw him in the brick-field at the extreme or
northeast end of the brick-field shortly after&mdash;some ten minutes
afterwards he came up to within twenty-five yards of where I was standing, and
I sent Tanner to take him away&mdash;I saw the parcel opened, and the contents
have been produced here&mdash;I afterwards went to the house in
Barnsley-street, and found this plasterer's hammer, which has been
produced&mdash;I found it lying with other tools, I believe, on the floor in
the room.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> The hammer was quite open, I believe, not
concealed? <i>A.</i> It was lying on the floor&mdash;there was no concealment
about it&mdash;I examined it directly, and found it nearly in the same state as
it is now&mdash;there was some plaster on it&mdash;it was not so clean as it is
now&mdash;it appeared to me as if it had been used&mdash;I have been engaged in
giving directions about this case the whole time, but part of the time I have
been on leave&mdash;I have not received any communication that a person was
seen to come out of the deceased's house on the Tuesday morning&mdash;in
consequence of something I have made inquiries about one or two persons besides
Mullins, previous to his being apprehended.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Since his apprehension, have you made inquiry
about any other person? <i>A.</i> No; I have not.</p>
<p>JOHN JOSHUA CARRIER. I am one of the firm of Pickering and Co. 4, Suffolk-
street, Cambridge-road&mdash;I knew the deceased Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I last saw
her alive on Monday, 13th August last&mdash;I drew this cheque, and paid it to
her&mdash;I gave it to her&mdash;it is dated 14th August; it should have been
the 13th&mdash;it is an error in the date&mdash;it is a mistake I made in
drawing it.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Are you quite sure you drew it on the 13th? <i>A.</i> Quite
sure, and gave it her myself on the same morning.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> What time did you give it her? <i>A.</i>
About 12 o'clock; it might have been a little before 12.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> How long had you been a tenant of Mrs. Emsley's? <i>A.</i>
About eighteen years, the old and new firm together&mdash;I am not aware that
she kept a banker&mdash;I do not know anything about that; I did not know that
she did&mdash;I paid her on other occasions, sometimes by cheque, and sometimes
money; more frequently by cheque&mdash;I do not know what became of the cheques
after she had them&mdash;we never crossed the cheques; it was always an open
cheque that I gave her&mdash;I cannot say now whether in looking over our
accounts I ever ascertained when the cheques came into our bankers as
paid&mdash;I know nothing about it.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> This cheque has never been through your
bankers; it has never been paid? <i>A.</i> Never.</p>
<p>JOSEPH BIGGS. I live at Connaught-row, Bethnal-green. I was well acquainted
with Mrs. Mary Emsley during the last four years, I think this is the fourth
summer&mdash;I knew her husband before, from about the year 1820&mdash;I was in
the habit of calling upon her in general once a week, since she lived in
Grove-road&mdash;I used to call there on Sunday evening mostly&mdash;I called
there on Sunday, 12th August, the day before this calamitous affair&mdash;I was
to have gone there on the Tuesday to see Mr. Cook, he being an acquaintance of
mine&mdash;I did not go at the time appointed; instead of going at 11, it was
about half-past 1&mdash;I could not get in&mdash;I have seen some plate which
the deceased deposited with me; I did not see it from the time of her
depositing it with me, until the time she wanted to take something out of it, I
had not any farther knowledge of it&mdash;I kept it secured as she tied it
up&mdash;she took back some of that; a few articles to sell, such as a silver
snuff-box, a lady's pencil-case, and a silver watch, and gold pins with
coloured stones&mdash;she took away a silver pencil-case with her about four
months ago, I think, somewhere early in the summer; I cannot call to mind the
time exactly; it was about four months, it might have been more or less&mdash;I
did not see that pencil-case afterwards until I saw it at the police court, or
rather until Tanner showed it to me&mdash;I believe that this (<i>produced</i>)
was the pencil-case which she took away with her, and for this reason; when she
took it out of the parcel, (indeed I did not know it was there before,) she
said "Here is a pencil-case, seeming to say, "Would you like to have
it?"&mdash;that was how I understood her&mdash;I took hold of it and said, "Oh,
it is an old-fashioned concern"&mdash;the point was thin, very much bent, more
so than it is now&mdash;that has been put in order&mdash;I said I did not think
I should&mdash;"I don't think it is of much use, it appears to be very much
broke"&mdash;she said, "I don't suppose it is;" and consequently took it back
again with her&mdash;I observed the head of the pencil-case at the time; it was
a round head like this; I believe this to be the very pencil-case&mdash;I saw
some lenses of a telescope in her possession, something like four weeks before
her decease, when she gave them to me to look at, saying, "Here are two
glasses, which do you think magnifies the most?" and so on&mdash;these appear
to me to be the very two glasses; I remember one was much better than the
other&mdash;I believe they are the same.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Then this pencil-case is not in the same
state as when it left you? <i>A.</i> It is not&mdash;it looked much older
then&mdash;I believe it is the same&mdash;at the time it was shown to me, I was
not aware that any one was charged with the murder&mdash;they brought it to me
and said "Do you know anything of this?"&mdash;I knew nothing at all about its
being sold, or bought, or the least thing, not a word&mdash;of course I said,
"Yes"&mdash;there is nothing I can positively swear to about it, any more than
that I believe it to be the very same&mdash;the old lady was fond of selling
her articles that she took away with her&mdash;I believe she was fond of money,
and was in the habit of converting the things into money&mdash;these two lenses
are two simple glasses&mdash;I believe them to be the two; of course I could
not say there are not two others like them&mdash;I never to my knowledge saw
any like them before&mdash;I know she had two like these&mdash;I am not
accustomed to look at lenses.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> You believe the pencil and the lenses to have
belonged to this old lady? <i>A.</i> I believe they did; conscientiously.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH GOETZ. I am the wife of Joseph Goetz, of 18, Bamsley-street,
Bethnal-green&mdash;I was the niece of Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I know the
prisoner&mdash;I know that he was in the habit of working at times for my
aunt&mdash;I remember hearing of the murder of my aunt on the Friday&mdash;I
had seen her on the Monday before that at my house; she dined with me on that
day&mdash;she left me at a quarter to 2 o'clock&mdash;while she was there the
prisoner came there for some keys; he came first for a box lock&mdash;my aunt
gave him some keys&mdash;he came twice or three times that day&mdash;he asked
for keys each time&mdash;he came and said it was a key wanted, not a box; I
gave him four or five keys, and he came back with several which would not do,
and he had a few more&mdash;I recognize this key, it is one that was amongst
the keys that I gave to Mullins&mdash;that was on the Monday that my aunt was
murdered&mdash;I next saw that key at my aunt's house on the Sunday
following&mdash;that was after the murder&mdash;I believe these to be the same
tea-spoons that I have seen my aunt use&mdash;I have noticed one of them bent
in the handle; this one (<i>pointing it out</i>)&mdash;I noticed that the last
time that I tea'd in that house&mdash;I saw it about four weeks before the
murder&mdash;I believe these spoons to have belonged to my aunt&mdash;I know a
pencil-case that she had; it is before me; I recognize it&mdash;it appears to
be a pencil-case that she used at my house several times&mdash;there is nothing
particular about it that I had noticed before&mdash;I think I had seen it a few
weeks before 13th August, at my house&mdash;my aunt was accustomed to visit me;
she never came into Bamsley-street without coming&mdash;I am aware that there
were no tea-spoons left in her house after the murder&mdash;I could not find a
tea-spoon to use for my breakfast, not one of any description.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> When did you examine the house? <i>A.</i> I
was called in on Friday, and on Saturday morning I had breakfast there, and I
could not find a tea-spoon&mdash;that was the first time I looked for
spoons&mdash;I did not find any&mdash;I looked for them in a table-drawer in
the kitchen, and on the dresser; they were usually kept amongst the tea-things
in the kitchen&mdash;I have seen three or four spoons there at a time&mdash;I
have seen more than those, but not in that house; I have seen silver spoons,
but not in that house&mdash;I do not know how long the old lady was in the
habit of using the pencil-case; I have seen it on and off, for some
time&mdash;I have seen it a long time, perhaps four years, before&mdash;she was
not in the habit of using it constantly but at different times I have seen
it&mdash;I have known the prisoner about six or seven months at the outside, to
the best of my recollection&mdash;I have known him as being, generally
speaking, employed by my aunt&mdash;he was at work for her during that period,
when there was any work to do&mdash;he was the person she employed usually to
carry out her plastering jobs, and so on&mdash;since the last man died Mullins
generally did the work&mdash;she had a large number of houses, and consequently
there was a great deal of work to be done, constant work&mdash;when she has
been staying at my house, he has called there to see her, and received his
orders from her, frequently&mdash;by her orders I told him to call on that very
Monday for the lock to put on a door&mdash;I gave him a box-lock first&mdash;my
aunt left my house that day about a quarter to 2 o'clock&mdash;Mullins had been
there from 10 to 12 o'clock, during that time&mdash;I can't say exactly at what
time&mdash;he did not come back again about 2 o'clock&mdash;I am quite positive
he never came to the house after my aunt left; not till Wednesday&mdash;he
left, and went away to get some keys for another door&mdash;he left with my
aunt&mdash;that was the third time of his leaving&mdash;he had been to and fro
with keys, fitting to other doors&mdash;my aunt had other business to do, and
he went away with the keys by himself; and after the third time he went away
with my aunt from the door, down to the house where he lived.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH GEORGE. I live at 8, Cutworth-street, Bethnal-green&mdash;I knew
the deceased Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I had attended her for 18 months as a
charwoman&mdash;she had no other attendant than me, that I know of&mdash;I was
in the habit of going to the house on Saturdays&mdash;she slept in the one-pair
front room&mdash;when any one called on her, her habit was to look out from the
area, or to look out of the window if it was dusk, before she answered
them&mdash;that was what she did when I was there&mdash;I was last there before
the murder on the Saturday, as Mrs. Emsley was supposed to be murdered on the
Monday&mdash;on the Saturday before that she had received a lot of
paperhangings&mdash;they were put up stairs in the two-pair front and back
rooms&mdash;Mullins carried them up; no one else&mdash;I had seen him there
before several times&mdash;I knew that he did work for Mrs. Emsley, aud he was
in the habit of coming on a Saturday to be paid for the work he had
done&mdash;I saw him there on the Saturday before the murder was supposed to be
committed&mdash;he was then paid about 6s. by the deceased&mdash;she took the
money from her pocket&mdash;she gave me the money to examine it, to take to the
door to see if there were any sovereigns in it&mdash;it was about dusk, 7
o'clock&mdash;she said it was to look if there were any sovereigns in
it&mdash;Mullins was not near enough to hear that remark of hers&mdash;there
were no sovereigns&mdash;he left at 7 o'clock&mdash;I remained till past 10
o'clock, my usual time&mdash;I have seen three tea-spoons&mdash;these are
exactly like them, but I cannot swear they are the same&mdash;they are exactly
the same sort&mdash;there were but three kept in the kitchen&mdash;I last saw
them on the Saturday&mdash;when I left at 10 o'clock I left them there.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> You attended her as charwoman weekly?
<i>A.</i> Yes; she employed no other servant&mdash;she was an old lady, very
penurious in her habits&mdash;she was never in the habit of carrying any
sovereigns in her pocket, to my knowledge&mdash;she did not live in a very
humble way&mdash;it was a very respectable house, a large house&mdash;her mode
of living was humble, not extravagant&mdash;I have known her 17 years, when she
was first married to Mr. Emsley&mdash;during that time I never saw her with
much money in her pocket&mdash;some times I saw a couple of bags on the
mantel-piece, about as large as my fist, but I never saw them untied&mdash;I
saw them when I went, but they were not there again&mdash;I did not see any
bags on the mantel-piece on this Saturday evening&mdash;I partly cleaned that
room on the Saturday&mdash;an old gentleman came on the Saturday of the name of
Green&mdash;he lived up at the Park&mdash;there was also a short man came to
look at the paper&mdash;I believe that to be Mr. Wright, in the
Mile-end-road&mdash;I did not know him at the time&mdash;a man also came about
12 o'clock with a bundle of paperhangings&mdash;she had a great many
paperhangings&mdash;she was not in the habit, till latterly, of selling them,
not till a week or two before her death&mdash;a week or two before she died she
had several persons call upon her about paperhangings&mdash;I never saw but
this Mr. Wright.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did Wright go away while you were there?
<i>A.</i> Yes&mdash;Mr. Green is 50 or 60 years old&mdash;I do not know whether
the other person bought some&mdash;Mrs. Emsley took him up stairs&mdash;I do
not know whether he bought any&mdash;he passed out&mdash;he went away while I
was there&mdash;this was on the Saturday&mdash;the old lady used to carry a
small basket in collecting her rents, and put the money into a leather bag.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Had she any banker? <i>A.</i> Yes; she went to the
bank&mdash;I heard say she did bank; she banked with the Bank of England.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Did you ever go to the Bank of England for her?
<i>A.</i> No; when the gentleman called about the paperhangings the old lady,
as he left, seemed to say that he was to call another time&mdash;I did not
distinctly hear&mdash;I only passed on the stairs.</p>
<p>WALTER THOMAS EMM. I am a shoemaker by trade&mdash;I reside at a little
cottage in Emsley's brick-field, Globe-town, Bethnal-green&mdash;I know the
prisoner&mdash;I have know him from, I think, about the beginning of last
February&mdash;he has visited at my house&mdash;he has had meals there&mdash;he
has had tea three or four times at the house in the brick-field, and I think he
has had meat and bread too there, after dinner when he has called in&mdash;I
think it was about four weeks before 13th August, the day of the murder, that
he had been at my cottage, but I saw him in Barnsley-street two days in that
week&mdash;I had to fetch him on the Thursday before the 13th August for the
old lady, to move a slab-stone in one of the houses in Barnsley-street, in the
back yard&mdash;I saw him on the Friday before the murder, in the
afternoon&mdash;I was frequently in the habit of seeing him&mdash;he worked for
me&mdash;he worked for Mrs. Emsley, and I had to see him&mdash;I was employed
by Mrs. Emsley to collect her rents, and I took jobs from her&mdash;I remember
Thornton, and Thomas, and Tanner coming to me at the brick-field&mdash;that was
on Sunday, 9th September, I think&mdash;I was then taken in custody&mdash;I did
not know what the charge was&mdash;I was charged with having a parcel there
belonging to Mrs. Emsley.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> We have heard that a parcel was found by Serjeaut Thomas, behind a
slab in an out-house of your cottage; did you put it there? <i>A.</i> No; I had
not anything whatever to do with that parcel&mdash;I had never seen that parcel
before it was produced in my presence by Thomas&mdash;I was aware that a reward
had been offered&mdash;I saw the old lady on the afternoon of Monday, 13th
August, about 2 o'clock, at the end of Barnsley-street&mdash;that was the last
time I saw her alive&mdash;after I left Mrs. Emsley on Monday, 13th August, I
went into one of the houses to see a plumber, and from there I went
home&mdash;I got home about half-past 3&mdash;I then stopped at home till 6
o'clock, or a little after 6; then I went with Mr. Rowland to Bethnal-green
workhouse&mdash;I stopped there for some time, till Rowland, and my wife, and a
Mrs. Buckle came out&mdash;I then went on to the field again with them&mdash;I
wanted Rowland to drive me to Stratford&mdash;I was on the field some length of
time&mdash;I could not catch the pony to get it harnessed; that took me some
time&mdash;then I went to Mr. Rumble, the owner of the pony, to see if he would
come and catch it, and when I came back again Rowland and my wife, and some one
else, had caught the pony&mdash;I started about 9 o'clock to go to Bromley and
Stratford&mdash;it might be two or three minutes past 9, I am not exactly
confident what time exactly it was&mdash;I think I got home to Globe-town about
half-past 11 o'clock&mdash;my wife went with me to Stratford, and a woman of
the name of Buckle; and Rumble, the owner of the pony, drove me there&mdash;we
were the four that went&mdash;I have a toll-ticket that I had on that day; this
is it (<i>produced</i>)&mdash;the date is the 13th of the 8th month.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> On the solemn oath that you have taken to tell the truth, had you
anything to do with the murder of this old lady? <i>A.</i> No I had not&mdash;I
remember the day I was taken into custody, when the parcel was found&mdash;on
the previous day, Saturday, I think it was about half-past 9 when I got
up&mdash;I was not well that day, or I should have been up before&mdash;I went
out of the cottage that day, I think, about a quarter or twenty minutes past
10&mdash;I had not left the cottage before that at all&mdash;ray daughter was
in the cottage that morning&mdash;she works for me&mdash;she binds, and works
on the seat&mdash;my wife was in the cottage that morning&mdash;I know a shed
about 40 or 50 yards from my cottage&mdash;I did not go there that
morning&mdash;I did not put any parcel there&mdash;I did not go into the shed
that morning by the side of my cottage&mdash;I only went to the shed on the
right side&mdash;that is&mdash;a water- closet&mdash;I went there&mdash;I
returned in two or three minutes&mdash;I then remained in the house working
till my dinner was ready&mdash;I was not outside any more&mdash;I collected
rents for the old lady, at Stratford&mdash;that was my business that
night&mdash;I went there by Mrs. Emsley's orders at 2 o'clock that day when I
saw her, because I did not send my boy on Saturday&mdash;it was one house I
went to, to receive 1<i>l.</i>&mdash;I did not receive the 1<i>l.</i>&mdash;I
went for that purpose&mdash;I did not call at Mrs. Emsley's house after that
till the following Wednesday, 15th August&mdash;I called for her to go with me
to Stratford&mdash;I found no admittance to the house&mdash;afterwards, in
consequence of what I had heard, I acquainted Mr. Rose, at his private house,
at 8 o'clock on the following Friday morning, that I could not obtain admission
to the house.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> How often did you go on the Wednesday to
this house? <i>A.</i> On Wednesday, the 15th, I went in the afternoon, and
then, as I came home from Stratford, at half-past 9 in the evening&mdash;I
knocked in the afternoon; there was no answer&mdash;I knocked again at night at
half-past 9&mdash;I did not stop there, because it was raining&mdash;I sent my
wife on the Thursday morning&mdash;I went on Thursday evening myself&mdash;I
knocked again; there was no answer&mdash;Mr. Whitaker, a relative of Mrs.
Emsley's, lives close by there, across in the Bow-road&mdash;I can't say that I
thought there was something the matter with the old lady; when I knocked twice
on the Wednesday&mdash;on the Thursday night I should say I did&mdash;I did not
go and tell any one then that I could not get in&mdash;I spoke to the next-door
neighbour, at No. 8, who came home while I was standing there&mdash;I said,
"Have you seen Mrs. Emsley to-day?"&mdash;he said, "No, I have been out all
day"&mdash;he looked at my wife and said, "Why, you were here this
morning"&mdash;my wife had told me she had knocked in the morning&mdash;I said,
"I have been knocking now for some time; it is very strange; I was knocking
here at half-past 9 last night"&mdash;he said, "Oh! then she came home
late"&mdash;with that I turned to my wife and said, "Well, we had better let
this be; we will call one of the youngsters up in the morning, and send them to
the house, and see whether we find the house in the same position as it is now;
if we find the house in the same position then I will let all that I know who
know Mrs. Emsley know of it"&mdash;for that reason I called the girl up at 6
o'clock, and sent her to the house&mdash;she came home again to me, and I got
my breakfast, and then I called on Mr. Rose, and told him all that had gone
on&mdash;I then recollected that the boy could not get admittance on the
Tuesday, and I told Mr. Rose of it&mdash;from there I sent one of the children
to Mr. Biggs, and I went to Brook-street, Ratcliff, to a Mr. Churchley,
thinking he might have seen Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I did not know that the old lady
was subject to fits, and that she had a swimming in the head about three or
four weeks previous to her being murdered&mdash;I don't think I have said that
I thought she was in a fit when I called on the Wednesday&mdash;I am sure I did
not say so&mdash;I could not have said such a thing as that&mdash;if I had
thought that, I could have got a ladder and got into the house&mdash;I did not
allege, as a reason for not telling her relatives, that I thought she was in a
fit&mdash;I am sure of that&mdash;I was in the habit of going sometimes three
times a week to Stratford to collect those rents, Monday, Wednesday, and
Saturday&mdash;I used to take the old lady the rents as soon as I got
back&mdash;I never went on a Wednesday but what I did receive some
rents&mdash;on Mondays and Saturdays I did not have to call at her
house&mdash;I dare say that this was the only occasion within the last month or
so that I went down in a vehicle to collect these rents, but I have often been
to Stratford in a vehicle&mdash;I don't know that I received tickets from the
turnpike-keeper always&mdash;sometimes the driver of the cart did&mdash;it has
not always been the same that drove me&mdash;when I have received them I have
not taken any notice whether I have kept them, for I did not think they would
be of any use to me&mdash;I found this one in my pocket&mdash;I did not think
it would be any use to me&mdash;I found it in my waistcoat pocket&mdash;you are
obliged to have them, because you go through two or three bars, and are obliged
to sing out the number&mdash;I can't say whether I wore that waistcoat from
that time up to the time I found the ticket; sometimes I put on one and
sometimes another&mdash;I have got, perhaps, half-a-dozen waistcoats or
more&mdash;I put on one, a thick waistcoat suitable for a chilly night, and a
thin oue if it is warm&mdash;I asked the carman if he had this ticket and I
felt in my pockets to see if I had got it, and I found it in one of my
pockets&mdash;I can't say when&mdash;it was after my apprehension that I found
it; after I was locked up&mdash;this was not the first time I have ever said
anything about this ticket&mdash;I took it, I think, the first week after I was
liberated&mdash;I took it to Mr. Wontner&mdash;Mr. Wontner told me to take care
of it&mdash;I did not produce it before the magistrate; it was never asked
for&mdash;I had it there ready if asked for&mdash;Mr. Wontner had it, and he
gave it me back again, and told me to take care of it&mdash;Rowland was the
name of one of the persons with me that evening&mdash;he was with me up to
about 9 o'clock, but Rumble, Buckle, and my wife were the parties that went
with me to Stratford&mdash;I cannot tell you when I first saw Rowland after
that, for I often saw him&mdash;I saw him shortly after I was released, but he
told the officers, and told Mr. Young, the same day I was locked up, before I
was released, that Rumble and Buckle were with me&mdash;he knew it the day
before I was discharged&mdash;it was not told in my presence&mdash;I was locked
up when Rowland had got Rumble and Buckle to prove that I was there&mdash;they
had not been examined then&mdash;I was not well when I saw Mullins on the
Friday previous to the murder&mdash;that was a month before I was taken&mdash;I
had been on and off in an ill state, the whole of that time&mdash;I had not
been lying in bed till half-past 9 each morning from the time I saw Mullins
first till I was taken, but in between I had&mdash;I have not been up as early
as 5 o'clock&mdash;I am confident of that&mdash;I got up as early as 8 o'clock
within a day or two of my being taken in custody, not earlier than 8 I am quite
sure; never on any occasion that I now think of, I don't think I have been up
before 8, I know that I have not; it is above thinking, I know I was not up
before 8&mdash;there was nothing for me to look after on the field; for that
reason I should not have to get up&mdash;I carry on the trade of a
shoemaker.</p>
<p>MARY ANN BUCKLE. I live at Holly-bush-gardens, Bethnal-green-road&mdash;I
remember going with Emm on a Monday down to Stratford&mdash;I had been at the
workhouse that day with Mrs. Emm&mdash;Mrs. Emm and I went first&mdash;Mr.
Rowland came while we were there&mdash;I do not know exactly what day of the
month it was; it was the 13th August I suppose; the day it was expected that
the old lady was murdered&mdash;it was, as near as I can say, about half-past 6
o'clock that day, that I saw Rowland&mdash;Walter Emm was waiting outside the
Union when we came out&mdash;I saw him there&mdash;I afterwards went down in a
cart to Stratford with Emm and his wife&mdash;Rumble drove us&mdash;when we got
back to Mr. English's it was nearly half-past 11&mdash;he lives in Park-street,
Bethnal-green&mdash;Emm was with us all that time&mdash;we stopped at Mr.
English's about five minutes.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> When were you first asked, and by whom,
about this evening that you went to Stratford with Emm? <i>A.</i> At
Arbour-square; last Tuesday, week I think&mdash;I had not been asked
before&mdash;I recollected going down to Stratford on that particular day,
because they said it was 13th August that the old lady was murdered&mdash;I did
not hear, I think, before the Sunday that the old lady was murdered&mdash;I
heard that Emm was taken in custody and charged with the murder&mdash;I knew
that he was out with us that evening&mdash;I did not tell anybody so, his wife
was with us at the same time&mdash;I did not hear of his being taken till the
Monday morning as he was taken on the Sunday&mdash;I then went to Mrs. Emm and
she was gone out&mdash;I saw her on the Monday night&mdash;I went to her house
and saw him&mdash;I believe I spoke first&mdash;I can hardly recollect the
words I said to him&mdash;I said. "Mr. Emm, I heard you were taken up for Mrs.
Emsley"&mdash;he said, "Yes;" he was out on bail&mdash;he said, "Do you
remember Monday, 13th August, I was with you at Stratford?"&mdash;I did not say
anything about it&mdash;I have been at Stratford since, but never
before&mdash;I went on the Tuesday after this, along with Mrs. Emm&mdash;Mr.
Rowland was not with me either time&mdash;he was not with me on the Monday,
only when he was in with us at the workhouse&mdash;I, Mr. and Mrs. Emm, and Mr.
Rumble went to Stratford&mdash;on the Tuesday I, and Mr. and Mrs. Emm, and Mr.
Rowland went, not Mr. Rumble; I think it was Mr. Rowland&mdash;I am quite sure
it was Rowland&mdash;we walked down there on the Tuesday; we did not go in any
vehicle.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Who was with you on Monday? <i>A.</i> Mr. and Mrs. Emm,
myself and Mr. Rumble&mdash;we started to go down there at ten minutes past 9
when we were at the end of White-horse-lane, when we got to the toll, and it
was about half-past 11 when we were back in at Mr. English's&mdash;we all came
back together, and Mr. and Mrs. Emm and his eldest daughter went with me to my
place, and Mr. Rumble went home.</p>
<p>MR. CLARK. <i>Q.</i> Had you gone down to see about a house? <i>A.</i> Yes,
to collect some rents; and we went to see a house that was there to
let&mdash;there were two at the time, and the lady shewed us one house, and we
said we did not like the house; we thought the other one was the best&mdash;I
walked down on the Tuesday to see the house again, and paid a deposit on it on
the Monday night.</p>
<p>THOMAS RUMBLE. I live at Digby-street, Grove-lane, Bethnal-green, and a
carman&mdash;I know Emm well&mdash;I keep my horse in his field&mdash;I
remember Monday night, 13th August&mdash;I went out with him that
night&mdash;the little boy came round to me first&mdash;I did not go round to
his place; the little boy came round to me and said he could not catch the
pony, and his father could not, and his father came round&mdash;I sent my
little boy round with the father and they caught the pony&mdash;it was about 8
o'clock when he came round to me&mdash;about 9 o'clock, when the pony was
caught, it was put in the cart opposite my place, and Mr. and Mrs. Emm, and
Mrs. Buckle, and I got into the cart&mdash;I drove them from there to
Bromley&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Emm got out of the cart at Bromley, and Mrs. Buckle
and I sat in the cart&mdash;after that we went on to Stratford&mdash;we got
back, not to Mr. Emm's house, but to the beershop just at the top of the
street, about half-past 11.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Do you remember Emm being taken up by the
police? <i>A.</i> Yes, on the Sunday&mdash;I heard of it on the Sunday, because
I was in the field in the afternoon&mdash;I can't say when my attention was
first called to the day upon which I drove him and his wife down to
Stratford&mdash;it was on the day when Mr. Emm was taken in the field; that is
all I know; I don't know the day&mdash;I speak with certainty as to the day I
went down to Stratford; it was on the 13th.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> How do you know that; have you any book in which you
entered any charge against him, or anything of that sort? <i>A.</i> No; I am
confident it was Monday.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Might it have been the Monday before? <i>A.</i> No, it
was Monday the 13th&mdash;I know it by the toll-ticket&mdash;I took the toll-
ticket, and I believe I passed it into Mr. Emm's hands&mdash;I cannot say that
I have sees it since&mdash;I saw the date on the toll-ticket&mdash;I know that
was the very day I went through the gate&mdash;I always get a ticket when I go
through the gate&mdash;I have been through a good many times before and since;
I always had tickets&mdash;I have got one in my pocket now but I do not know
the date of it&mdash;I can't say who first spoke to me about that particular
day after Emm was taken in custody&mdash;Mr. Tanner and Thomas came to let me
know about it&mdash;I can't say the day of the month they came to me; it was a
very few days after Emm was taken; I can't say what day&mdash;they both came
together&mdash;I can't say which spoke to me first&mdash;I can't say whether
they did or not speak to me before I said anything to them&mdash;I believe they
said to me,"Do you remember the day you drove Emm down to
Stratford?"&mdash;they said, "Do you remember driving Emm down on Monday, 13th
August last?"&mdash;it was not from what they said that I remembered the day;
because the toll-ticket, as I told you before, told me the day of the month; I
remember the night very well&mdash;when the man gave the toll-ticket to me I
passed it to Emm, and I saw the number of it then&mdash;that was the first time
I saw the date, and I did not take any notice of it till Tanner and Thomas came
to me&mdash;they did not put it to me as Monday, August 13th; I can't say
whether I or they said it.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Have you any other reason for remembering the
night than what you have told us? <i>A.</i> No&mdash;I first heard of the
murder on the Friday, I believe&mdash;I believe it was supposed to have been
committed on Monday, the 13th&mdash;I have driven Mrs. Buckle down to Stratford
before&mdash;I drove her in company with Mr. and Mrs. Emm on that night, 13th
August&mdash;I never drove her down to Stratford before that, to my
knowledge&mdash;that was the first night I ever drove her down.</p>
<p>ANN EMM. I am the wife of Walter Thomas Emm&mdash;I remember my husband
being taken into custody on the Sunday&mdash;he got up on the morning of the
Saturday before that, about half-past 9&mdash;he was very ill on Friday&mdash;I
am quite sure he did not get up till half-past 9&mdash;he only went out of the
cottage to the water-closet and in again, and I was at the door when he went
outside&mdash;that was on the Saturday morning&mdash;my husband could not have
gone out to the shed by the side of our house, or have gone to the ruin,
between 8 and 9 o'clock, without my knowing it, and I am sure he did
not&mdash;I remember Monday, 13th August&mdash;I remember going to
Stratford&mdash;I was at my father's, at the Union, before I went down to
Stratford&mdash;Mrs. Buckle went with me&mdash;Mr. Rowland and my husbaud came
shortly afterwards&mdash;it was pretty well 7 o'clock in the afternoon when
they came to me&mdash;Mr. Rumble went down to Stratford&mdash;from 7 o'clock
that afternoon till I returned from Stratford, I was with my husband&mdash;I
went to Stratford about 9 at night&mdash;Mrs. Buckle, Mr. Rumble, and my
husband went with me&mdash;Rowland did not go with us&mdash;he left us when we
got into the cart&mdash;I am quite sure this was Monday, 13th August</p>
<p>Cross-Examined. <i>Q.</i> When did you first remember that was the day you
went to Stratford? <i>A.</i> I knew it was on the 13th we went to Stratford,
because of going to get some rent for the old lady&mdash;I used to go to
Bromley getting rents of little houses there, and then accompany my husband to
Stratford&mdash;I was in the habit of going on other days&mdash;I remember this
particular Monday the 13th, because it was the day I went to see my father
before I went&mdash;I went to see him several times, but I did not go to
Stratford the same day, afterwards: that I am sure of&mdash;it was the Monday,
as we found Mrs. Emsley was dead on the following Friday&mdash;it was before,
not after my husband was taken in custody, that it came to my recollection; of
course I was aware it was the 13th that I went&mdash;I know we all four went
together to Stratford on that day&mdash;I should have known it was that
particular Monday, if my husband had not been apprehended, because we rode
there in a cart on the Monday&mdash;I have thought of it a good many times
since&mdash;my husband is naturally a very ailing man; he often gets up
late&mdash;he was very seldom out of the place unless I knew where he was
going, or what for&mdash;I usually get up first&mdash;I am generally up as soon
as he is&mdash;I generally know where he goes to when he goes out of the house;
he tells me if he is going anywhere particular&mdash;he never goes away without
saying where he is going.</p>
<p>SUSANNAH EMM. I am the daughter of Walter Emm&mdash;I live with him in the
cottage in the brick-field&mdash;I remember the Monday morning on which the
police came to our house, and took my father into custody&mdash;my father had
been in a very bad state of health the day before&mdash;he had his breakfast in
bed&mdash;I give it to him at about a quarter to 9&mdash;he was then in
bed&mdash;I assist him in his business&mdash;I work by the window against the
shed&mdash;there are five windows to the cottage, two down stairs and three
up&mdash;if a person goes from the door to the shed, they must pass the window
where I was sitting at work&mdash;after I gave my father his breakfast at a
quarter to 9, I was sitting at work at the window all the day, barring when I
got up to my meals&mdash;my father did not go by the window to that shed while
I was at work there&mdash;he could not have gone by without my seeing
him&mdash;I could also see from the window the ruined cottage in the
field&mdash;nobody went there from our cottage that morning&mdash;I was at work
in the cottage all the day, except the time I was at my meals&mdash;I know the
prisoner by sight&mdash;he has had meals at our house sometimes&mdash;in the
course of that Saturday morning on which my father was in bed I saw Mullins in
the brick-field&mdash;that was about half-past 2 in the afternoon&mdash;he was
at the back of the school wall, right straight across the field from the
window&mdash;the school is right at the opposite end of the field to our
cottage&mdash;I see the cottage here (<i>referring to the plan</i>)&mdash;it
was somewhere about here that I saw the prisoner at half-past 2&mdash;this is
the window where I was sitting&mdash;when I saw the prisoner in the brick-field
about half-past 2, he was walking along, looking down on the ground as if he
was looking for something.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> How far off was he? <i>A.</i> He was three
parts across the field&mdash;shoemaking is the work I follow at this
window&mdash;I can look out of the window and make shoes as well; because I am
not looking at the shoes perhaps every minute in the day&mdash;I look out of
the window very often&mdash;I always look about the field&mdash;anybody could
go to the shed without my seeing them, but not to the ruin&mdash;I do not
always have my eyes fixed on the shed; on the ruin I do, but not on the
shed&mdash;I look at the ruin always, because it is right level with the
window&mdash;I went to work that morning before I gave my father his breakfast;
and I sat at the window at work all day afterwards&mdash;I was there the day
before, Friday, and the day before that&mdash;I worked all the week&mdash;I
always work at the window.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> The shed where you heard of the parcel being
found, is on the left of your window? <i>A.</i> Yes; therefore a person might
come this way to it without my seeing them&mdash;if a person went from the door
of our cottage they could not go to the shed without my seeing them.</p>
<p>WALTER THOMAS EMM, JUN. I remember my father being taken in custody&mdash;I
am ten years old&mdash;my father was taken in custody on the Sunday&mdash;I
know the prisoner Mullins&mdash;I had seen him before that Sunday&mdash;I saw
him in the field on Friday, lying down with a handkerchief up to his
eyes&mdash;he was lying at the back of the school wall&mdash;I saw him there
about half an hour&mdash;I went away then to mind my pigs&mdash;I saw him again
on Saturday, he came up towards some mound where they were putting down some
drain pipes, and walked back again&mdash;it was a heap of sand in the middle of
the field&mdash;he stayed there about half an hour&mdash;I did not see him
there again.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Had you seen him there any days before?
<i>A.</i> Yes; I saw him one or two weeks&mdash;he was getting herbs; picking
up something off the ground&mdash;there were not persons putting drains down
when he went up to this place by the sand; they were making a road there, there
were eight men there&mdash;he did not go close to them, because there was a
mound they were knocking down&mdash;he did not go and look at them; he walked
up towards the mound, and then he walked back again&mdash;I do not know whether
they could see him&mdash;he knew me.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> What were you doing there? <i>A.</i> I was
minding my father's pigs.</p>
<p>JOHN RAYMOND. I am a tailor by business, and reside at 12,
Oxfordsquare&mdash;I remember the night of 13th August&mdash;I know the
Grove-road&mdash;I did not know and never saw Mrs. Emeley&mdash;at the corner
of Grove-road there is a public-house, of the sign of the Earl of
Aberdeen&mdash;there is a urinal by the side of it; about twelve feet from
it&mdash;I remember being there on the evening of 13th August, about ten
minutes to 8 o'olock&mdash;there was a man there and I waited&mdash;I was
facing the urinal so as to see any one that came out&mdash;I saw the man that
came out; it was the prisoner&mdash;he went round the corner of the Aberdeen;
going round the corner, and turning to the right, would lead to the house No.
9, on the right hand side of the way.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> How far would the place be from the house No. 9? <i>A.</i>
About four hundred and twenty yards as near as possible.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Have you measured it? <i>A.</i> No; it is
merely guess.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> You are a tailor? <i>A.</i> Yes; a
journeyman tailor; not a jobbing tailor&mdash;I am a coat maker&mdash;I work
for Mr. James Cook, of 63, Shorediteh&mdash;he was the last pereon&mdash;in
1847, I worked for Stevens and Clark&mdash;I have not been working for anybody
since&mdash;I have been working nine years for the person who employed
me&mdash;I work for him now; I am quite sure&mdash;I am not obliged to send for
my work at all&mdash;I go to and for the premises for my work&mdash;I went to
Scotland-yard on the Friday previous to the last examination of the
prisouer&mdash;the prisoner bad been examained twice, I believe, previously to
my going to Scotland-yard&mdash;I had beard of it&mdash;I read the newspapers;
I had not read the account of the examination in the newspapers, never but
once.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Did you know the prison by sight? <i>A.</i> I never saw him
in my life&mdash;I did not know him by name&mdash;I identified him simply by
seeing the account of the examination in the papers, and I was satisfied that
the man I saw come out of the urinal was the man charged with the
murder&mdash;that was the way in which I imagined the case&mdash;having read
the papers and seen that he was termed a plasterer by trade, and seeing the
person come out of the urinal I saw that that man was a plasterer&mdash;I first
saw him so as to identify him on 2d October, at the police-court in
Arbour-square.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> You say you saw something in the papers about his being
a plasterer, did you also see a description of what he was like? <i>A.</i> No,
I did not, I am quite sure&mdash;I observed that he was a plasterer by the coat
he wore and the billy-cocked hat&mdash;he looked like a man engaged in that
capacity returning home from his work at that hour of the nigh&mdash;I only
caught a casual glance of him as he came out of the urinal&mdash;I observed his
face&mdash;I did not take the trouble to count how many persons there ware in
the room with the prisoner when I saw him at Arbour-square&mdash;he was among a
great many more; these might have been twenty&mdash;he was not in the court,
bat in a room at the door of the court&mdash;I was taken there to see if I
could point out the man I saw in the urinal&mdash;he had not then got on a
plasterer's coat and a billy-cocked hat&mdash;I swore to him by his
feature&mdash;I did see his features on the night in question, not longer
perhaps than for two or three minutes&mdash;the man gave me every opportunity
of looking at his countenance from what I was told and what I saw in the
papers, I was satisfied that the man I had seen in the retiring-place was the
man who was charged with the murder&mdash;I do not always notice the persons I
see, but I was standing in this position (<i>folding his arms</i>) waiting to
go in, and the man as he came out looked straight at me, up and down&mdash;it
was not a casual glance that I had, the man gave me every opportunity of
looking at his features, he seemed to be struck with my appearance&mdash;he
stood and looked at me&mdash;I did not describe the appearance of the man
before I went to the polioce court, not to a single person.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> When you went to the police-conrt was the
prisoner at all pointed out to you, or did you select him from a number of
other persons? <i>A.</i> I selected him instantly the door was opened&mdash;he
was not pointed out to me at all.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Have you any doubt at all, on the oath you have taken, that he is
the man? <i>A.</i> I know I am on the charge of murder, and that, on the part
of her Majesty, if I had had the least doubt previous to my going in, I should
have given the prisoner the benefit thereof&mdash;he came out of the urinal and
looked me in the face&mdash;I was close to him&mdash;I had a full opportunity
of seeing him.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> What officer went with you into the room where the
prisoner was? <i>A.</i> Serjeant Tanner&mdash;I should imagine there were from
fifteen to twenty persons there&mdash;I could not positively swear there were
twenty&mdash;I am positively certain there were fifteen&mdash;they were men and
women, apparently prisoners, charged with various offences, waiting to go
before the magistrate.</p>
<p>MR. BEST to RICHARD TANNER. <i>Q.</i> Did you accompany the lost witness
into the room? <i>A.</i> Yes; I suppose there were about twelve or fifteen
persons there&mdash;it is rather difficult to tell the number of persons really
in the room&mdash;there were probably three or four men of about the same age
as the prisoner&mdash;I told the witness to follow me, that there would be a
number of persons, to look about him, and if he saw the prisoner to say
so&mdash;he stopped me and told me that the prisoner, who was then sitting down
at the end of the room, was the man he had seen come out of the urinal and turn
down the Grove-road.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Was he long in coming to that conclusion? <i>A.</i> Not
more than a minute.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> You have seen the prisoner on several occasions, have
you ever seen him with a billy-cocked hat? <i>A.</i> I never saw him but twice
before he was a prisoner&mdash;I never saw him with anything of that
description.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did you in any way point out the prisoner, or
suggest, or direct the witness in reference to him? <i>A.</i> No; what he did
was perfectly spontaneous.</p>
<p>Prisoner. <i>Q.</i> Had he not the opportunity of seeing me on previous days
at Arbour-square? <i>A.</i> Certainly; if he had been there.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> According to the practice would the witness be entitled to
any part of the reward for giving evidence on this occasion? <i>A.</i> I think
not&mdash;I have known a reward to be divided between witnesses in a case.</p>
<p>JOHN MITCHELL. I am a seaman&mdash;I also work at the docks&mdash;I live at
Hoxton&mdash;I was working at the docks on Monday, 13th, and Tuesday, 14th
August&mdash;I left my house at 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning to go to my
work&mdash;on my way to the docks I passed through Stepney-green&mdash;it might
be about five minutes to 5, as I was going down from the top of the
Green&mdash;as I was going through the Green towards the docks I saw a man
coming up the Green towards me, he was on the same side of the road as myself,
the right side&mdash;there was nothing about the man at first to attract my
attention, but on acloser approach he trembled&mdash;he seemed in a state of
very nervous excitement&mdash;he had a flush on his cheek, he trembled, and his
lips quivered&mdash;he was on the kerb and I was on the right, and he made a
cross-walk and came aside of me, and as he came close to me I took my hands out
of my pocket and he made a falter and trembled, and he stepped on my left and I
turned round and had a look at his back afterwards&mdash;I had an opportunity
of seeing his face distinctly as he came towards me&mdash;I took particular
remark of all his feature&mdash;the prisoner is the man&mdash;his pockets were
very bulky, particularly the right-hand pocket&mdash;I know the
Grove-road&mdash;I suppose where I met the man would be about three-quarters of
a mile from there&mdash;I know Barnsley-street&mdash;it would be a circuitous
route to come that way from Grove-road to Barnsley-street&mdash;the
Mile-end-road would be the direct way.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> I believe you were quite frightened at the
man, were you not? <i>A.</i> He rather alarmed me, but he did not frighten me
much; I got out of his road&mdash;I stepped on one side; seeing a man in that
state, of course it alarmed me; you would have been alarmed if you had been
there&mdash;he had on corduroy trousers, a brown wide-awake, and a kind of a
drab tweed coat, with shooting pockets, and the pockets were loaded up to the
mouth, at least the mouth gaped; there was something heavy in the bottom of
them&mdash;both the pockets quite bulged out, very largely indeed&mdash;he
seemed to labour under the weight he was carrying&mdash;he Seemed to labour
that way that it excited my suspicion that he had done something bad&mdash;it
was as though he was carrying something very bulky.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> When did you give any information of what you had seen? <i>A.</i>
I took no more notice of it till I heard of the murder on the Friday; I saw
posted up at a newsvendor's the atrocious murder of an old lady, but I did not
know in what part of Stepney it was; and about a week after that I went through
the Grove-road and made inquiry about what was the matter, and they told me
that was where the old lady was murdered, and then I directly calculated that
it was the party I had seen that morning&mdash;I went and gave information to
the police two or three days after, at the Robert-street station&mdash;I do not
know the date&mdash;I think it was the inspector I went to; he had pen and ink
before him, but whether he took heed of it or not I did not know&mdash;I went
and gave information on the tuesday as the prisoner was in custody on the
Monday&mdash;I heard that a man had been taken into custody, and according to
the description of him I took it to be the party I had seen&mdash;I did not
hear a description of him from anybody, but I heard many people talking about
him, and by that I thought he was the party&mdash;I did not go to see the
prisoner until I saw him at the House of Detention; that was on the Saturday as
he was in custody on the Monday&mdash;I then saw the prisoner&mdash;he was in
his cell by himself&mdash;nobody showed him to me; the turnkey took me round
and opened every door&mdash;I saw no man completely to resemble the man but the
prisoner&mdash;I saw about thirty&mdash;when the door was opened he stood
sideways, all the others faced out&mdash;it was not that that made me think
something was not right&mdash;I knew his features again directly, by the
description I gave of him&mdash;I could not be mistaken in him&mdash;I did not
go by what I heard from other people&mdash;I had been talking about this with
lots of other people; before the murder was discovered and afterwards&mdash;I
am a dock labourer&mdash;I was brought up a seaman&mdash;I have to be at my
work at six o'clock, and I have to walk four miles and a half&mdash;I belong to
the transporting gang, that remove the ships from one part to another&mdash;I
heard of the reward that had been offered&mdash;that was not before I gave the
information&mdash;I did not do it for the reward&mdash;I expect to be rewarded
for it.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> What opportunity had you of seeing the
prisoner?&mdash;how long do you think you saw him when you met him in
Stepney-green? <i>A.</i> It might be about five minutes&mdash;I was abreast of
Mr. Spill's manufactory when I saw the man coming up&mdash;he was about abreast
of College-terrace&mdash;I suppose that might be 300 yards from me&mdash;he was
coming up in my direction for about five minutes&mdash;I did not have that
opportunity of seeing his features, not till he got closer&mdash;I remarked to
myself I wondered who he was.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> What opportunity had you of seeing his face when he came up to
you? <i>A.</i> By his ghastly appearance&mdash;when I went to the House of
Detention there was nobody there but two turnkeys and one
gentleman&mdash;neither of those persons pointed out the prisoner to me in any
way&mdash;they opened thirty cells; I went through them all and eventually
selected this man&mdash;I do not know whether a wide-awake and a billy-cocked
hat are the same.</p>
<p>STEPHEN THORNTON (<i>re-examined</i>). A billy-cock and a wide-awake are the
same thing.</p>
<p>WILLIAM ROWLAND. I live at 25, Barnaley-street, Bethnal-green, and am a
paper-hanger&mdash;I was in the habit of doing work for Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I was
for some years warrant officer, at Worship-street police court&mdash;I saw Mrs.
Emsley at my house on 13th August last, and paid her some money, about
2<i>l.</i>&mdash;I never saw her afterwards&mdash;I know the prisoner&mdash;I
know him as working for Mrs. Emsley occasionally&mdash;I saw him on Monday,
13th, about the middle of the day, somewhere about 1 or 2 o'clock, two I think
it was, in Temple-terrace, close by Barnsley- street&mdash;I did not see him
again till the Wednesday&mdash;he was to do some work for me on the
Monday&mdash;I gave him directions to do it and expected he would have
completed it on the Monday, but he did not till the Wednesday&mdash;he did not
come to work on the Tuesday&mdash;he came on the Wednesday&mdash;I saw him at
the job on the Wednesday&mdash;I said nothing to him that day&mdash;he
completed the work&mdash;I saw him again on the Friday&mdash;he came to me and
asked me to assist him in doing some work&mdash;I said, "I cannot very well
afford the time, as I have got some other job"&mdash;he said, "If you will I
will come and assist you," and he did come and assist me in the morning, and
then I went to Gaffney's, the cooper's, and on the road I met a person who
asked me, in Mullins's presence, "Have you heard that an old lady has been
murdered in Grove-road? "I said, "No, I have not, "and the party said," I hope
it is not Mrs. Emsley"&mdash;I noticed Mullins at that time&mdash;I noticed a
tremor come over him, and a slight alteration of the features&mdash;I then went
on with him to Gaffney's and finished his job&mdash;I found his work was done
in a very strange manner, the paper was all turned upside down, and his mode of
doing things was more like a person that was imbecile than anything
else&mdash;after finishing what I agreed to do for him I left, and just
afterwards I heard it confirmed that it was Mrs. Emsley that was
murdered&mdash;I then went back to the cooper's where he was at work, called
him out, and said, "Mullins, I want to speak to you; it is Mrs. Emsley that is
murdered"&mdash;I then saw a very remarkable change in the man&mdash;he said,
"Is it? come outside," in a nervous irritable way&mdash;he seemed excited, very
much indeed&mdash;he said, "Come, and have some drink"&mdash;there was a public
house about two doors off, and he said, "Let us have some rum, you like
rum"&mdash;I do not like rum particularly, however, I did have some with him,
and then I noticed that his appearance indicated something very extraordinary;
he was pale, and he shook and trembled, which gave me a notion at the time that
there was something very wrong about him&mdash;I next saw him on Wednesday, 5th
September, previous to the apprehension of Emm on the Sunday&mdash;I met him
about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening&mdash;I said to him, "Mullins, they
have not found out the murderer of Mrs. Emsley; have you heard anything of the
murder of Mrs. Emsley?"&mdash;he said, "No; "Nor have I, "I said&mdash;he said
he was going to get something for his supper&mdash;I said, "I am going round
here; "he said, "I will walk with you"&mdash;we went into a house to see a
person, but did not see him&mdash;when we came out the prisoner said, "Let us
have some spirits, I want some spirits, "and we did have a small drop of
gin&mdash;I then went out of the house with him and I said, "Mullins, I suspect
a man very strongly, and I have got him in my mind's eye now, and I will not
lose sight of him till the perpetrator of this diabolical murder has been
discovered"&mdash;he then assumed a very ghastly appearance; a pallor came over
him, a death-like hue, and he said, "I suspect the man likewise, and I am
watching him now"&mdash;I said, "I believe, Mullins, the man I suspect is not
the man you suspect"&mdash;he then wanted to leave me, although he had said he
was going my way&mdash;I said, "I thought you were going to get something for
your supper?"&mdash;he said, "No, I shall not have any supper now"&mdash;then I
put another question to him respecting the removal of the paper at Mrs.
Emsley's house, which had been deposited in the parlour and which was taken up
into the second floor&mdash;he said, "Some man helped me to move it"&mdash;I
said, "Who was that man?"&mdash;he said, "I can't describe the man"&mdash;I
said, "Why, can't you describe the man that helped you for an hour and a half,
you being an old officer?"&mdash;he said, "No, I can't"&mdash;I said, "I can
hardly believe you"&mdash;he then said, "I will leave you, I won't go any
further with you, "and there I left him&mdash;I had known him before for nearly
three months&mdash;I had heard of him before that, but did not know him
personally&mdash;I know Mrs. Emm&mdash;on 13th August, the very day in
question, I went with her to the workhouse to see a relation of hers, an old
gentleman that I have known many years&mdash;her husband was with her&mdash;we
went there about half-past 6, and stopped there till it was getting dark; at
that time it was dark about half-past 7; we could hardly see in the ward where
the old man was lying&mdash;she remained with me the whole of the time, and Emm
was there&mdash;about ten minutes past 9, that same night, they went away with
a man who is here, the driver of the cart&mdash;Mrs. Emm, Mrs. Buckley, and
Walter Emm, four of them, went away in the cart&mdash;I saw them depart; they
were going to Stratford&mdash;they wanted me to go, but I said, no, I had other
business&mdash;I saw them depart about ten minutes past 9 that same night.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Mulling is a plasterer by trade is he not,
not a paperhanger? <i>A.</i> Well, I don't know exactly what he is; he was
represented to me to be a plasterer, and I believe he is&mdash;it is not
difficult-to put up paperhangings&mdash;as a business it is nothing, you may
learn it in about six months&mdash;I don't believe Mullins is a paper-hanger;
not a tradesman&mdash;I have had several conversations with him about this poor
old lady&mdash;I know he was in the habit of going to her place, and working
for her&mdash;I was also in the habit of being employed by her&mdash;I was
sorry to hear of her death, because I lose something by it; I felt grieved that
a woman should be murdered in that way, and so would any man with any
feeling&mdash;I did not see the prisoner from the 13th till the 15th&mdash;I
saw him once or twice afterwards&mdash;I had no other conversation with him
after the 5th September, that was the last; that was after the murder had been
found out&mdash;the other conversation was before it was discovered&mdash;I saw
him about the neighbourhood several times during that period&mdash;it was not
because the carpenters had not finished their work that he did not finish the
job, there were no carpenters employed&mdash;there was some patch-work to
finish to the ceilings in some small houses, which was work that required to be
done directly, as it puts them to inconvenience, and I expected him to do
it&mdash;the old paper had not to be taken off, not as far as he was
concerned.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Do you remember what sort of a hat he wore generally? <i>A.</i>
Yes, sometimes a hat and sometimes a peaked cap&mdash;when I saw him about 2
o'clock on the Monday I believe he had his hat or cap on; I really cannot tell
now&mdash;I never saw him wear a billy-cock hat&mdash;I have never given any
information against a man named Smith about this murder&mdash;I spoke before
the Coroner of the man having some quarrel with Mrs. Emsley&mdash;that was
before I know anything about this charge, it was after she was found
murdered&mdash;I did not give information about Smith, I merely said that he
had had a quarrel with Mrs. Emsley and the matter was referred to me&mdash;she
said to me, "This man wants to rob me, Mr. Rowland, of a 50<i>l.</i>
note"&mdash;I said, "No, I don't think he does"&mdash;she had detained his
rent-book and he was trying to get it and seized her basket&mdash;he was a
tenant of Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I know him, he is a lame man and walks with a
crutch&mdash;I settled the matter between them amicably, I found that Mrs.
Emsley was wrong and the tenant was right; but she made use of an exclamation,
"This man wants to rob me of a 50<i>l.</i> note, and I have got it
here"&mdash;I did not tell the Coroner I had important evidence to give&mdash;I
said I had evidence to give respecting the customs and habits of the late Mrs.
Emsley&mdash;I was not examined then; I think not till the third time.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Do I understand you to say that this dispute
whatever it was, between Mrs. Emsley and Smith was amicably settled? <i>A.</i>
Yes, and they parted on friendly terms, at least they were both
satisfied&mdash;Smith is a man of about forty-six years of age.</p>
<p>ISAAC TYRRELL. I live at 1, Temple-terrace, Bethnal-green&mdash;I know the
prisoner, he has worked at my house, not for me&mdash;I remember his working
there on Monday, 13th August, pointing tiles and repairing the ceiling of the
front-room&mdash;I saw him at work on that day&mdash;he had a hammer that he
was working with&mdash;he knocked the ceiling down with a hammer&mdash;this
(<i>produced</i>) is something like the hammer.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Is that the common hammer that is used by a plasterer?
<i>A.</i> It is.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Do you remember what time he left his work?
<i>A.</i> About 6 in the evening; it was not finished&mdash;I had not given
directions as to its being finished&mdash;I had nothing whatever to do with
it&mdash;he came next on the Wednesday, not before&mdash;he did not come at all
on the Tuesday.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> I believe he could not finish in
consequence of some carpenter's work being required to be done? <i>A.</i> Oh,
no; he could have finished&mdash;he wanted some cement for the tiles on the
copper; he could have done that&mdash;I can't say whether he got any cement
that day; I did not see him&mdash;I believe there was none there on the
Monday&mdash;he had other tools with him, he had a trowel&mdash;he did not
leave them behind, he took them away with him, I am confident of
that&mdash;there were no boards given him to be fastened down by a carpenter,
not in my house&mdash;a piece of board was given him on the Thursday to put on
the trap door leading to the copper&mdash;that was not finished till the
Thursday; the cement was put on on the Wednesday. THOMAS PRIOR. I am barman at
the Royal Oak public-house, Keppelstreet, Chelsea&mdash;On Friday, 7th
September last, I bought a pencil-case of the prisoner's wife&mdash;this is the
one (<i>produced</i>)&mdash;the point of the pencilcase was bent nearly flat
when I bought it&mdash;I straightened it&mdash;it was very dirty indeed&mdash;I
cleaned it with rotten stone.</p>
<p>ANN COOPER. I am a widow living at 12, Little Orford-street, Chelsea&mdash;I
know the prisoner&mdash;he, his wife and family, lodged at my house&mdash;he
has five children; they left my house on 26th August&mdash;after they left
Inspector Thornton came there&mdash;I saw him find a boot&mdash;I had seen that
boot before; I saw it thrown out of Mullins' window on the Sunday afternoon, as
they left in the evening&mdash;it was in the dust-hole when Thornton found
it&mdash;this is the boot (<i>produced</i>). <i>Cross-examined.</i> <i>Q.</i>
What part of the house were you in when you say this boot came out of the
window? <i>A.</i> In the first-floor back room, looking into the
yard&mdash;there are three rooms up stairs and two down, and a kitchen; it came
out of the back parlour window&mdash;I was shaking a cloth out of the window
from a young man's table who had been having breakfast&mdash;it was not Charles
Shirley, he was not in the house at that time.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Was the back parlour a room occupied by the prisoner?
<i>A.</i> That was the room occupied by him.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Who occupied the other rooms? <i>A.</i> A person of the
name of Cowper occupied the front parlour&mdash;he had been there about a
week&mdash;a young man named Levick also lived in the house; he left on the
following Saturday&mdash;there was no other person living there&mdash;I think
Cowper served in a china-ware shop, but I don't know exactly; the other man
used to drive a coal cart, his employer is a coal and coke merchant&mdash;I am
sure there was no man of the name of Shirley there&mdash;I have seen a young
man of that name there once or twice whilst Mullins was there.</p>
<p>MR. PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Who was he? did you know anything about him? <i>A.</i>
I did not know much about him&mdash;I believe his father is a calenderer, a
calico glazer, or something of that sort, not a plasterer&mdash;he is about
twentyfive or twenty-six years of age&mdash;Mullins did not sleep at home
regularly&mdash;I believe he once told me that his work laid over at Stepney,
it was his habit to go out on a Monday and return on Saturday night&mdash;his
wife and children were most of the time at home&mdash;I believe Mrs. Mullins
used to go oat washing.</p>
<p>STEPHEN THORNTON (<i>re-examined</i>). I found this boot in the dust-hole
described by Mrs. Cooper at the house 12, Orford-street, Marlborough-road,
Chelsea&mdash;I gave instructions for a piece of the landing to be cut out on
the second-floor of the house 9, Grove-road&mdash;it was done and I produce
it&mdash;Sergeant Tanner actually cut it out&mdash;there is a foot mark of
blood on it, of the left boot of a man, coming from the room.</p>
<p>WILLIAM THOMAS (<i>re-examined</i>). I was present when the piece of wood
was cut out of the landing&mdash;this is the piece, it was taken from the
landing on the second-floor; the top of the house.</p>
<p>STEPHEN THORNTON (<i>re-examined</i>). The marks on it are marks of
blood&mdash;I had to wash the boot, it was in a very filthy state, it laid
about two feet in the ashes&mdash;I have made a comparison of the boot with the
marks on this piece of the landing&mdash;there are two nails near the too that
seem to correspond exactly, and there is a licking up of the blood in the
centre of the boot which appears to me a hole that would gather up the blood
and leave the impression that appears to be left on that board&mdash;there is a
double row of nails on the left side of the boot, and there are two nails more
especially very prominent in the boot as there is on the board; if you turn the
boot on to the impression you will see the two nails speak of&mdash;in washing
the boot a great portion of the heel fell off; it was in a filthy
state&mdash;all manner of filth had been thrown into the dust-hole.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Did you put this pencil mark round the
impression? <i>A.</i> No; I think Dr. Gill did it&mdash;I had seen the marks
repeatedly&mdash;these two nails in the shoe were strong in my mind&mdash;it
was that which made me bring the boot away having an idea of what such an
impression would leave in the warm blood&mdash;Tanner cut the mark out&mdash;a
board was previously nailed over it by one of the officers&mdash;I saw it
nailed over with instructions that it should be preserved.</p>
<p>RICHARD TANNER (<i>re-examined</i>). The piece of wood which Thornton has
produced is in the same state that it was when it was first observed at the
house, with the exception of the pencil mark round it, that was made by Dr.
Gill in my presence&mdash;I cut it out myself&mdash;I understand the terms
billycock and wide-awake to mean the same thing&mdash;in London they are
generally called wide-awakes, in Staffordshire and those parts, I have heard
they are called billy-cocks.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> I believe you were not at the house the first time the
footmark was discovered? <i>A.</i> I was the first detective at the house,
Dillon was there before me, it was pointed out to me by inspector Kerrison.</p>
<p>WALTER KERRISON (<i>Police-inspector</i>). I produce a knife which I found
in the pocket of the deceased&mdash;I searched her pockets in the
morning&mdash;I saw Dillon find a ring; this is it (<i>produced</i>) it was
found between the mattress and the bed&mdash;I observed some marks of blood on
the landing of the room&mdash;I called Dr. Gill's attention to them&mdash;this
is the piece of board that was cut out of that landing&mdash;with the exception
of the pencil mark, it is in the same state as when I first observed it&mdash;I
found nothing in the old lady's pockets but this knife&mdash;I found no money
or anything of the kind.</p>
<p>DR. GILL (<i>re-examined</i>). I have examined this boot with a powerful
magnifying glass&mdash;I found one hair between the welt and the sole in this
broken side, the best part of it was packed within the boot; I found another
hair on the surface, and a third here&mdash;I am of opinion that they were
human hairs&mdash;I think I can produce them now&mdash;part of them were cut up
to put under the microscope, and part of them Dr. Letheby cut up.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Do you say that they are certainly human hairs? <i>A.</i>
Certainly&mdash;I ascertained that, by means of the microscope&mdash;my
experience enables me to say that they are human hairs&mdash;I could tell what
colour they were&mdash;they were much the same colour as Mrs. Emsley's
hair&mdash;I had some of her hair in my possession to compare the two&mdash;I
compared the hairs with what I actually took from her head&mdash;they appeared
to correspond in colour.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> You cannot of course say more than that?
<i>A.</i> No one could say more than that&mdash;human hair is used for plaster
and mortar; there is no doubt of that&mdash;I examined the pencil case that has
been produced&mdash;I saw a spot on it which I imagined to be blood&mdash;it
was on the edge&mdash;I asked Dr. Ansell to examine it with me, and we examined
it together under the microscope&mdash;in my judgment that spot was
blood&mdash;a microscope is an infallible test as far as regards the proof of
blood&mdash;it is believed to be so.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> You cannot tell whether that blood was human blood or
not, I believe? <i>A.</i> Certainly not.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Unfortunately at present there is no test by
which you can detect human blood from other blood, is there? <i>A.</i> No.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Where is the mark you speak of? <i>A.</i> Along the line of
the opening of the pencil case; between that and the head.</p>
<p>ROBERT WENT (<i>Policeman, K 160</i>). After the discovery of the murder I
searched the coal cellar at the house, 9, Grove-road&mdash;in the coal cellar
under the coal, I found a tin box&mdash;it was wrapped up in part of a
handkerchief&mdash;I found in the box 16<i>l.</i> 2s. in silver, and
32<i>l.</i> in gold.</p>
<p>JAMES WRIGHT. I am an estate and house agent&mdash;I cany on my business in
Bow-road&mdash;I called on Mrs. Emsley about some paper-hangings on Saturday,
the 11th, to the best of my knowledge; the Saturday previous to the
murder&mdash;I saw her in the evening about 6 o'clock&mdash;I remained with
her, I dare say, an hour; not looking at the papers all the time&mdash;I went
up stairs&mdash;when I first went in the passage, the charwoman who has been
examined, opened the door&mdash;that was the last time I saw the old
lady&mdash;there was another person in the house at the time&mdash;I saw a
person sitting on the stairs&mdash;that was the person whom I saw at the
Coroner's jury&mdash;his name is Mullins&mdash;I see him here now&mdash;it is
the prisoner.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Where do you live?&mdash;in the
neighbourhood? <i>A.</i> About two hundred yards from the place&mdash;I was not
at the house at all on Tuesday, the 14th, I am quite positive&mdash;I do not
know a man of the name of Stevenson&mdash;I am quite positive that I never
entered the house after the Saturday&mdash;not at all in the afternoon of
Tuesday&mdash;that I am quite positive of.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Is there any pretence for suggesting that you
were ever near the house after the Saturday? <i>A.</i> Not any&mdash;I know the
old lady before&mdash;I had done several things for her.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH FUKE. I am married, and live at 17 1/2, James-street,
Commercial-road, East&mdash;that house belonged to the late Mrs. Emsley&mdash;I
was tenant of a house of hers at No. 14, in that street&mdash;I know the
prisoner&mdash;I remember hearing of this murder&mdash;he came to my house a
few days before 13th August, to set a copper&mdash;that was, I believe, about
twelve days before 13th August&mdash;when he came, he said Mrs. Elmsley was a
miserable old wretch; that she sent men about to do work, but she did not
always find them in materials to do it with&mdash;I asked him what he required
and he said some cement&mdash;I asked him what quantity, he said, "About a
peck"&mdash;I gave him the money and he went for it, and when he returned he
further said that he had been at her house that morning; that she was sitting
down to breakfast which he would not have sat down to himself, she would not
even allow herself as much as a farthing's worth of milk to put in her tea; she
was drinking it without, but I need not take any notice of it to her; it was a
great pity such a miserable old wretch should be allowed to live.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined</i>. <i>Q.</i> Was that alluding to her penurious habits,
and mode of life? you did not think he was going to murder her, from that?
<i>A.</i> No; I believed it was in allusion to her penurious habits.</p>
<p>The following Witnesses were called for the Defence.</p>
<p>MARY MULLINS On 13th August last, I resided with my mother, at 12, Orford-
street, Chelsea&mdash;my father lived at Barnsley-street at that time&mdash;two
of my brothers, James and Thomas, lived at home with my mother&mdash;there was
another, John, he used to be down with my father; he sometimes used to come up
to mother's&mdash;I have seen this pencil-case with my brother James, in June
and July, in his possession&mdash;I do not know, where my brother James is
now&mdash;he is a sailor&mdash;I saw it in June last&mdash;I have seen it
several times since at my mother's house, in August, and about a fortnight
before my father was taken&mdash;I have had frequent opportunities of observing
it&mdash;I have had it in my hand several times&mdash;I believe this to be the
pencilcase I have seen with my brother.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> When did you first
hear of the murder? <i>A.</i> I can't exactly say the day of the month&mdash;it
was on Saturday&mdash;I read of it in the papers&mdash;I was in a situation at
9, Sloane-terraee, Chelsea, with Mr. Gibson&mdash;I have seen Mrs. Emsley once
or twice&mdash;I know that my father worked for her&mdash;I had not seen my
father before I heard of the murder&mdash;I saw him on the Saturday night, that
was after the murder; I was dismissed the same day by Mr. Gibson from his
service; on the Monday after my father was taken&mdash;he was taken on the
Sunday&mdash;it was in September that I was dismissed&mdash;I was dismissed
from my situation because my master read of it in the paper&mdash;that was
all&mdash;I swear that&mdash;that is all the reason I can give&mdash;he told me
I had better go, as my father had been taken, as he did not like to have me in
the house.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Was nothing said about removing a stone in the kitchen? <i>A.</i>
Yes; I dropped a shilling there&mdash;the reason I was dismissed was not
because I had been found removing a stone in the kitchen, and been supposed to
be hiding something&mdash;it was after that, when I was paid my wages, when
master told me to go&mdash;mistress paid me in the kitchen, and I dropped a
shilling down by the side of the fire-place&mdash;there was a little girl came
in, she saw me removing the stone&mdash;I told her to hold the candle while I
removed it; she told my master after I had left&mdash;the removal of the stone
was not the cause of my being dismissed&mdash;I found the shilling&mdash;no one
was present when I found it&mdash;the little girl who held the light did not
see me pick it up; she was called away&mdash;the bell rang for her to go up
stairs&mdash;I did not find the shilling in anybody's presence&mdash;I was not
dismissed for removing the stone because it was supposed I was hiding
something&mdash;the master, when I took the papers up in the morning, read of
it in the newspapers&mdash;he did not tell me for an hour after, for one of the
young ladies was ill, and he was afraid it might disturb them, so he called me
out, and told me to meet him in Sloane-street; and he asked me if I had heard
about my father; he said he had seen it in the newspapers, and it was very bad,
and he wished me to leave&mdash;I had got the stone up before the little girl
came into the kitchen&mdash;I called her to hold the candle for me&mdash;she
was accidentally called away, and did not see me find the shilling; I did not
tell her not to say anything about it&mdash;I did not tell her I would give her
sixpence if she did not say anything about it&mdash;I can't say exactly what
time in the day it was that this stone was being removed, a little after 2
o'clock, I think&mdash;I was dismissed on the Monday after my father was taken;
about 4 o'clock I think it was; between 3 and 4 o'clock&mdash;I was lifting the
stone about 2 o'clock, and I was dismissed between 3 and 4 o'clock&mdash;it was
after the master had told me to leave, that I was lifting the stone; I had to
get my clothes and things&mdash;I last saw my brother James in July, or the
beginning of August; in July I think it was&mdash;I had not seen him for some
time before the murder; he did not leave home since the murder; he left some
time before&mdash;I have seen this pencil-case with my brother James&mdash;I
have two other brothers, John and Thomas&mdash;John used to sleep sometimes at
my mother's, sometimes down at my father's; both of them, John and Thomas,
slept sometimes in my mother's room, and sometimes with my father&mdash;my
father used to come home very seldom; only on the Saturday&mdash;he was not in
the habit of sleeping with us; only on Saturday night or Sunday&mdash;my
brother went down in the country, and he heard of my brother coming home from
sea, and came to see him, and he remained at home till some time after my
brother came home from sea&mdash;my brother came home from sea in May&mdash;in
August John and Thomas were living generally with my mother&mdash;Thomas was in
a situation at a green-grocer's, in Marlborough-road, Chelsea&mdash;he was an
errand-boy&mdash;he used to go there regularly every day, and slept at
home&mdash;when I was out of a situation I used to sleep at home&mdash;I went
to see my father on the Saturday after the murder, because I was anxious to
hear about it; I was anxious to hear about Mrs. Emsley, seeing it in the
papers&mdash;he did not send or come to me, I went to him, to my
mother's&mdash;I was paid 12<i>l.</i> a year by Mr. Gibson&mdash;I can't say
exactly how much it was that I received on the Monday when I was
dismissed&mdash;it was not so much as a pound&mdash;it was 17s. or 18s. I am
not sure which&mdash;I was only there for a short time&mdash;the slab that I
was removing, was in the back kitchen, by the side of the fire-place; there was
a hole by the side of the fender&mdash;Mr. Gibson's is a large house.</p>
<p>THOMAS MULLINS. I live at No. 1, Rose-court, East Smithfield&mdash;I am
about sixteen years old&mdash;I work at light labouring&mdash;I have once
assisted my father in his trade&mdash;I have been to see him in Barnsley-
street&mdash;I stayed with him there&mdash;I remember Monday, 13th August
last&mdash;I was staying with him in Barnsley-street that day, at No.
33&mdash;my brother John was staying with him besides me&mdash;I was doing
nothing that day&mdash;I was at home all day&mdash;my father was out at
work&mdash;I remember what time he came home that evening from his work, it was
about a quarter-past 7&mdash;he stayed in the house after that, and did not go
out any more after that&mdash; he slept there&mdash;he slept in a little bed by
himself, and I and my brother slept together in the same room&mdash;I got up in
the morning about half-past 7&mdash;my father, after he got up, went and
water-washed the passage ceiling, and stopped the nail holes&mdash;he was at
work doing that till about 12 o'clock; he then came in and had his dinner about
12, and went out about half-past 12&mdash;I did not go with him&mdash;I do not
know this boot at all&mdash;I have never seen it&mdash;I never saw my father
with a boot like that&mdash;I clean my father's boots sometimes&mdash;I know
what a billy-cock hat is&mdash;I never saw my father wear one of
those&mdash;one generally hears it called by that name&mdash;it is a round
hat&mdash;it is the same thing as a wide-awake&mdash;he had not a brown
wide-awake on the Monday evening at all, he had his hat.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARKY. <i>Q.</i> When did you last see
your brother James? <i>A.</i> About three mouths ago from this time as near as
I can judge&mdash;I perfectly remember the time of the murder; he was then at
home.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> When did he leave home? <i>A.</i> Oh, he was not at home; I made a
mistake&mdash;I said just now that he was at home&mdash;he left home about
three or four weeks before the supposed murder.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> If you knew that, what made you tell me that he was at home?
<i>A.</i> I bethought myself; it ran in my mind&mdash;I have been spoken to
about whether my brother was at home or not at the time of the murder&mdash;it
has not been very much spoken of in our family whether he was at home or
not&mdash;I have heard it spoken of, because some persons asked me&mdash;I made
a mistake when I said that he was at home&mdash;he never wore a wide-awake
hat&mdash;there was not such a thing as a wide-awake hat in the family&mdash;he
went to sea&mdash;I do not know where he is&mdash;he went in the
"Mechanic"&mdash;I don't know where for; New York&mdash;I was not in work at
the time of the murder&mdash;I have worked in the Marlborough-road&mdash;I was
not working there in August&mdash;I can swear I was with my father on the
13th&mdash;I was not at work at a green-grocer's in Marlborough-road in
August&mdash;Yes, I dare say I was; the very day I left I came down to my
father's.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Were you at work in Marlborough-road at a green-grocer's in
the month of August? <i>A.</i> I do not know; I don't recollect.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Just now you said the very day you left you
came down to your father's? <i>A.</i> I came down to my father's&mdash;it was
on a Sunday morning that I left, and I came down on Monday to my
father's&mdash;I can't answer whether I was at work at this green-grocer's on
Sunday, 12th August&mdash;I have done work since 13th August, at Mr.
Pinnock's&mdash;I have only been there one day, that is all the work I can
recollect that I have done since 13th August&mdash;that is all that I have done
since 13th August&mdash;I do recollect&mdash;before the 12th August I was at
work at a green-grocer's in Marlborough-road, all that part of August up to the
12th&mdash;Pinnock is the name of the green-grocer&mdash;I was also at work for
him two Saturdays ago&mdash;that is all the work I have done&mdash;I had been
at work for him about six months before, and I have done one job for him
since&mdash;I was dismissed&mdash;I was not sent away&mdash;I left myself, of
my own accord&mdash;I did not have any other situation&mdash;I was not sent
away, I am quite sure&mdash;I am quite sure I left on 12th August&mdash;I did
not go with my father on the 13th&mdash;I was at Barasley-street all day on
13th August&mdash;I was there about 12 o'clock in the day time&mdash;no one
went with me, only myself; that was all&mdash;my brother John was down in the
room in Barnsley-street&mdash;I slept at home on the Sunday night with my
father, in Orford-street&mdash;that was on the Sunday night&mdash;my father was
at home on the Sunday&mdash;he left home on the Monday morning about six
o'clock&mdash;no one went with him&mdash;I went to Barnsley-street at 12
o'clock in the day&mdash;I did nothing there all day&mdash;I went there to see
my father, and to see how he got on with his work&mdash;that was not the reason
I gave up my situation&mdash;I did not shut myself in the room all day&mdash;my
brother John was there when I got there&mdash;he and I were in the room all day
together; at 12 o'clock we were&mdash;I went out, but I was not long
out&mdash;my brother did not go with me; he stayed in&mdash;he had slept in
Barnsley-street the night before, by himself&mdash;he is older than I&mdash;I
did not know that from him; I knew it by myself&mdash;I was there with
him&mdash;no, not the night before; I was there all the day with him, and he
slept there&mdash;I know he slept there on the Sunday night, because I went
home, and my brother did not sleep with me, and when I went down there on the
Monday morning he was there&mdash;I slept with my mother in Orford-street on
the Sunday night&mdash;my brother John was not there&mdash;he slept at
Barnsley- street&mdash;he was not doing any work at that time&mdash;he was not
in work at all, neither of us&mdash;he was looking after work, he went there
being near the docks&mdash;I went out for about a quarter of an hour&mdash;I
have no remembrance what time of the day that was&mdash;it was about the middle
of the day&mdash;I dined that day in Barnsley-street, with my father and
brother&mdash;I am sure my father dined there; we had some bread and meat for
dinner&mdash;we dined about one o'clock&mdash;my father came home to have his
dinner&mdash;I don't recollect at what time he came home to his
dinner&mdash;there was no table in the room when I was there&mdash;there was
one chair&mdash;there was no bed forme to lie on&mdash;I and my brother did not
sleep on the bare floor&mdash;there were some canes there on the floor, that
they make chairs of&mdash;they were on the bed and we took them off the bed and
put them on the floor&mdash;the bed is a mere tressel with a sacking; my father
slept there&mdash;that is the little bed I spoke of just now&mdash;my father
remained in after coming home about a quarter to 7&mdash;we had our supper
afterwards&mdash;I had some bread and tea for supper&mdash;my brother and I
went to bed at 9 o'clock&mdash;I did not go to sleep&mdash;I was not awake all
night&mdash;we did not go to sleep till my father got into bed&mdash;I went to
sleep about 12 o'clock&mdash;I went to bed about 9 and went to sleep about
12&mdash;I could not go to sleep&mdash;I do not know what time my father went
to sleep&mdash;he went to bed at the same time we did&mdash;I could not go to
sleep till my father came to bed&mdash;he came to bed at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Why could you not go to sleep before 12 o'clock? <i>A.</i> Because
I could I not&mdash;I am really in earnest in saying that&mdash;I did not go
away the next day&mdash;I remained in Barnsley-street the whole of the next
day, Tuesday&mdash;I slept with I my father again on Tuesday night&mdash;I
continued to sleep there till about Thursday, and then I went home
again&mdash;my brother John was in the same room&mdash;I went out once on the
Tuesday for a quarter of an hour again, not much more&mdash;the room is a very
small room on the ground-floor&mdash;I and my brother remained in that room the
whole of Monday and Tuesday&mdash;I got there on Monday, about 12 o'clock;
alone&mdash;I first heard of the murder on Saturday evening&mdash;I then
remembered that I had slept there on the Monday night&mdash;when I first heard
of the murder on the Saturday evening I remembered that I had slept there on
the Monday night&mdash;I first heard of the murder when my father came
home&mdash;there was a row in the house with Mrs. Emsley and another woman, I
was in the room&mdash;that was, I believe, on the Monday&mdash;a row in No. 33,
Barnsley-street&mdash;that was one of Mrs. Emsley's houses&mdash;there were
some children used to sleep in the room; Mrs. Musick's&mdash;they slept in the
room my father occupied&mdash;I can't recollect where they slept on the Monday
night&mdash;they did not sleep with me&mdash;I do not know about their sleeping
in the same room; I don't recollect it&mdash;those children are about seven or
eight years old; the eldest&mdash;there are three children&mdash;I can't
recollect whether they slept in the room that same night&mdash;I don't
recollect whether they did on the Tuesday night&mdash;I have slept in the same
room with those children, in Barnsley-street&mdash;I can't tell whether they
slept with me on the Monday night&mdash;I don't know whether my brother
can&mdash;I can't tell you&mdash;I don't recollect whether they slept there on
the Tuesday, or on the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> When did you last sleep in Barnsley-street? <i>A.</i> On
Wednesday night&mdash;I never went there any more after&mdash;I came up to look
after work&mdash;I last slept in Barnsley-street on the Wednesday after 13th
August&mdash;there was a Mrs. Musick, the mother of these children, who slept
there&mdash;I had slept there before the Monday&mdash;I was in the habit of
sleeping then sometimes.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did you sleep there on the Saturday nigh
before the Monday? <i>A.</i> No&mdash;Mrs. Emsley did not turn Mrs. Musiek
out&mdash;she ordered her to go&mdash;she stayed there by my father's
permission while he was away&mdash;when my father was up at Brompton she used
to sleep in the same room&mdash;that is what I have been told&mdash;I have
never slept in the same room when she has been sleeping there&mdash;I do not
know where she slept on the night of 13th August&mdash;I believe she was in the
house&mdash;when my father was there she used to sleep in the back kitchen, and
her children used sometimes to sleep in my father's room.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> I will again ask you how you came to know, on the Saturday
following the murder, that the murder was committed on Monday, 13th August; how
was your attention called to the date? <i>A.</i> Well, hearing of the row, in
Barnsley-street on the Monday when I was there&mdash;I did not know that the
murder was committed on the Monday night; I did not say it had been committed
on the Monday night&mdash;no one asked me on the Saturday whether I remembered
having slept there on the Monday&mdash;I understood by the papers that the
murder was committed on the 13th&mdash;I heard that on the Saturday evening; I
heard that it was committed on the Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> When you heard of this murder having been committed did
you remember the row in Barnsley-street? <i>A.</i> Yes&mdash;it was from that
that I remembered being in Barnsley-street on the Monday&mdash;the bed of
rushes was not a very comfortable bed; I could not go to sleep because it was
so hard.</p>
<p>JOHN MULLINS. I am the son of the prisoner, and live at No. 1, Rose- court,
East Smithfield&mdash;I am a labourer&mdash;at present I am out of
employ&mdash;when I am employed it is at the docks&mdash;I remember my father
living at 33, Barnsley-street, right well; I lived there with him&mdash;I was
there on Monday, 13th August last&mdash;my father was there on that day, and my
brother, the last witness&mdash;my father went out at his regular time in the
morning, a little after 8, after breakfast&mdash;he came home again about 12, I
should say, and had his dinner; he then went to work again&mdash;I next saw him
at 7 o'clock; it might want a few minutes to 7&mdash;he came into the room
where I was&mdash;he had his supper at 8 o'clock and went to bed at 9&mdash;I
went to bed there&mdash;I slept in that room&mdash;my father slept in the
bed&mdash;I did not go to sleep for some time after I went to bed; it is not
every time you can go to sleep when you lie down&mdash;I got up in the morning
about the same time, half-past 7&mdash;my father got up, he had his breakfast a
little after 8 o'clock, and then he water washed the passage and stopped the
nail-holes&mdash;at 12 o'clock he came in to his dinner, and at half-past 12 he
told me he was going to Cambridge-road to work there; he then left&mdash;I
never saw this boot in all my life&mdash;I know right well what a billy-cock
hat is&mdash;it is what they wear in Ireland&mdash;my father never wore one of
those.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did you ever wear
one? <i>A.</i> At times, in Ireland, I might have one for about a month&mdash;I
am not at work now&mdash;I was not at work at the time I spoke of in
August&mdash;I have not been at work since&mdash;I should say it was about four
months since I was at work in the docks; during that time I have done nothing,
because my health would not allow me&mdash;I have lived with my father during
that time in Barnsley-street, and at Brompton, in Orford-street&mdash;I went
there once or twice&mdash;my father slept at home on the night of the
murder&mdash;I mean in Little Orford-street.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> You said just now that he got up about 8, his usual time, on the
Monday morning, is that so? <i>A.</i> You speak a little too fast for me; I
recollect my father getting up on Monday morning, 13th August&mdash;if you
speak a little easier I shall understand you.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Where did you sleep on Monday night, 13th August? <i>A.</i>
At 33, Barnsley-street.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> You are quite sure of that? <i>A.</i> On
Monday night I slept in Barnsley-street; and on Sunday night, with my
father&mdash;he had his breakfast on Monday morning, I recollect that.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Who slept with your father on the Sunday night besides
yourself?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> On Sunday night? he used to go home of a Saturday night.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Never mind what he used to do; you say you slept with your father
on the Sunday night, at Barnsley-street, who slept with you? <i>A.</i> On
Sunday night? you are mistaken, you spoke too fast; I did not understand what
you said.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> You said distinctly that you slept with your father in Barnsley-
street, and that your father got up to breakfast at 8 o'clock in the morning,
is that true or false? <i>A.</i> You say, where he had his breakfast on Monday
morning, don't you? well, he had it in Oakum-street, no, not in Oakum-street,
at 33, Barnsley-street.</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> On Monday morning he had his breakfast in Barnsley- street,
is that so? <i>A.</i> On Monday morning had he his breakfast in
Barnsley-street? he used to go away on Monday morning from Oakum-steeet.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Were you at home all day on the Monday, it
seems to puzzle you about the breakfast? <i>A.</i> No, it does not puzzle
me&mdash;I cannot say whether he did breakfast in Barnsley-street on the Monday
morning&mdash;he used to come home on Saturday night to his own place&mdash;to
the best of my knowledge I was at 33, Barnsley-street on the Sunday
night&mdash;I did not sleep there on the Tuesday night; I went up to Little
Orford-street&mdash;I can't say how long I stayed there; my father was out at
work on the Monday and I was in the room along with my brother Thomas&mdash;on
Sunday night I think I slept with myself&mdash;if I said I slept with my father
I was mistaken&mdash;I did not do any work on Monday&mdash;I did not go out the
whole of the day&mdash;I sat in the little room all day reading an almanack,
that was all that there was there&mdash;there was a little bedstead in the
room, only one&mdash;my brother Thomas slept with me on the Monday
night&mdash;I know three little children of the name of Musick&mdash;they used
to sleep in the kitchen&mdash;they have; slept in my father's room&mdash;on
Monday night they slept in the kitchen&mdash;I won't swear that they did; they
must either have slept in the room or in the kitchen&mdash;I swear they slept
in the house, I used to hear them asking their mother for a good many
things&mdash;I did not leave the house till Tuesday evening&mdash;I remained in
the house all day doing nothing&mdash;there were other persons in the house at
33, Barnsley-street&mdash;I know a young woman named Brimson&mdash;I think Mrs.
Musick saw my father water-washing the passage and stopping the nail-holes; she
was in and out&mdash;I don't know where she is now; we can't find her; she is
put out of the way, there is no doubt about it&mdash;I remember right well when
my brother went to sea, it was in July&mdash;I cannot tell where these children
slept on the night in question, except that they slept in the house.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Have you tried to find Mrs. Musick? <i>A.</i> Yes, we
have made inquiries about her and cannot find her out&mdash;I had no billy-cock
hat on this Monday.</p>
<p>CAROLINE BARNES. I live at Laurestine-cottage, Grove-road&mdash;I know No.
9, Grove-road, where Mrs. Emsley lived&mdash;my house is nearly opposite to
that house&mdash;I remember Monday, 13th August last&mdash;I saw Mrs. Einsley,
on that day&mdash;I saw the house on the Tuesday morning&mdash;I saw some one
moving the paper on the Tuesday morning&mdash;the paper was very white outside,
paper-hangings&mdash;it was in the top room&mdash;it was about twenty minutes
to 10 o'clock when I saw this&mdash;I saw the right hand window of the top room
open a little way, which attracted my attention&mdash;I saw the window move; it
attracted me being opened; I saw it opening&mdash;I could not tell who the
person was that was in the room.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> When was your
attention first called to this matter; when did you hear of the murder?
<i>A.</i> On the Friday&mdash;I told Mr. Rose about this; I said I supposed it
to be Mrs. Emsley, but I did not see the old lady&mdash;I said I had not seen
her since I saw her moving the paper&mdash;I supposed it to be her; I did not
take any notice&mdash;I was very busy at the time&mdash;it was about twenty
minutes to 10 on the Tuesday.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> I believe you gave evidence of this before the coroner?
<i>A.</i> I did.</p>
<p>JAMES STEVENSON. I am a builder, and reside at 3, Library-road,
Oldford&mdash;I had occasion to go to Grove-road on Tuesday morning, 14th
August last&mdash;I called at 3, Grove-road, at the house of a man named
Piper&mdash;I did not see him, but I saw his family, and left a message for
him&mdash;that was just turned half-past 10 o'clock&mdash;since I heard of the
circumstance I have noticed the house where Mrs. Emsley used to live, No. 9,
Grove-road&mdash;I had not noticed it previously&mdash;I passed by that house
about half-past 9 o'clock, or a few minutes later that morning&mdash;I went
round into the Grove-road, and left a message for Mr. Piper, the plasterer, and
after leaving there I walked on the other side of the way towards Bow station,
undecided whether I should go home by bus or not&mdash;after I had walked a few
paces towards the Bow-railway station I looked down the Bow-road, and in
looking down the Bow-road I saw a tall man coming out of a garden there with
some paper under his arm&mdash;whether it was three or four pieces I cannot be
positive&mdash;he was coming out of a garden apparently about the number of the
house, No. 9&mdash;I then returned, and walked a few paces towards the city of
London, and as I was walking I looked down the Grove-road again, and saw the
person coming towards the Mile-end-road or Bow-road, some people call it one
and some the other&mdash;after that I crossed over the road, one door from the
Grove- road, and then I made up my mind to go home&mdash;I was walking towards
home, and had just turned the corner to go down the Grove-road when I met the
party face to face, nearly in each other's arms&mdash;I said, "Hallo, what, are
you in the paper line?"&mdash;he said, "Yes, "in a flurried manner (<i>speaking
in a faltering tone</i>)&mdash;I thought it might be from my coming on him all
of a sudden&mdash;he said, "Yes, didn't you know that?"&mdash;I said, "No, I
didn't know it; had I known it I could have given you a job, for I have got
about 180 pieces of paper being hung"&mdash;he said, "Oh, yes, I have served my
time at it"&mdash;"Well," I said, "I shall want some more done by and by, and
the first job I have I know where you live, in Barnsley-street,
Bethnal-green."</p>
<p>COURT. <i>Q.</i> Then you knew the man? <i>A.</i> Yes, I knew him well, it
was Mr. Rowland.</p>
<p>MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Did you give any information of this to any one?
<i>A.</i> Not till some days afterwards&mdash;I told my sister-in-law&mdash;on
the Saturday afternoon I went to Mr. Rose, the solicitor of Mrs. Emsley, and
made him acquainted with it&mdash;that was the day after the murder was made
known&mdash;I heard of it on the Friday, and on the Saturday I went and made
him acquainted with it&mdash;he recommended me to go to Scotland-yard&mdash;I
did not go that evening, but I went next morning, Monday; and gave information
to Sergeant Tanner, and from that Sergeant Tanner and Inspector Thornton came
to my house, and after that Inspector Kerrison, and I was summoned on the
inquest, but was not examined. I gave in a written statement at the time to
Sergeant Tanner.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> I don't know whether
you were aware that there was a house being papered next door to the
deceased's? <i>A.</i> No, I did not know anything about that&mdash;I did not
even know that she lived there until after the affair&mdash;I do not know
whether that was so or not&mdash;this was on the Tuesday morning, 14th
August&mdash;I did not recognize Mr. Rowland until I came upon him as I have
described&mdash;I did not know previously that he was a paper-hanger by
trade&mdash;I only knew it from what he stated.</p>
<p>MICHAEL GAFFNET. I live at 7, Queen's-row, Cambridge-road,
Bethnalgreen&mdash;I know the prisoner&mdash;he was doing work for me in
August&mdash;I remember Tuesday, 14th August&mdash;he came to work for me on
that day&mdash;he came about 1 o'clock&mdash;I had never seen him before the
Monday when he came to look at the work.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> What time do you say
he was working for you? <i>A.</i> It was about 1 o'clock on the Tuesday when he
came&mdash;he had not been at work on the Monday for me&mdash;he only came to
look at the work&mdash;I asked him when he would be there, so as I might clear
the things out of the way for him, and he said he would be there on the Tuesday
morning&mdash;he did not name the time, but he came about 1 o'clock in the
day.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY in reply re-called</p>
<p>WILLIAM ROWLAND. I know James Stevenson the builder; I see him in
Court&mdash;I did not see him in Grove-road on 14th August last&mdash;I was not
near the place&mdash;several witnesses can prove that I was some two miles from
there at the time, and the whole of the day&mdash;I did not come out of any
house there&mdash;perhaps it may be necessary to explain that I saw Mr.
Stevenson some time previous, nearly a week before, and I then had some paper
under my arm&mdash;I have known him for some years, and I know he is a man
labouring under some impressions, in fact, I have the impression that he was
not quite right in his mind.</p>
<p>CAROLINE BRIMSON. I am single&mdash;I work in a laundry&mdash;I have an aunt
who lodged at 33, Barnsley-street&mdash;Mrs. Musick used sometimes to attend
upon her, she is an invalid&mdash;she is not bed ridden, but she was so for
nine months&mdash;Mrs. Musick used to attend upon her&mdash;in consequence of
Mrs. Musick going away, I went to Barnsley-street to attend upon my
aunt&mdash;I had just left service&mdash;I went on the Tuesday&mdash;I do not
know the day of the month, but it was on the Tuesday as Mrs. Emsley was
supposed to be murdered on the Monday&mdash;I am quite sure of that&mdash;I
went there at 10 o'clock in the morning&mdash;I was there the whole of that day
and the next, and have been there ever since&mdash;I know the two young men,
the Mullins, I saw them there&mdash;I saw one on the Tuesday, the shortest one
(<i>Thomas</i>)&mdash;the other one was not there at all on the
Tuesday&mdash;he was there on the Tuesday'week; the following Tuesday&mdash;I
remember the place being waterI washed&mdash;I was there at the time, because
the prisoner borrowed my aunt's pail to do it with&mdash;the prisoner
water-washed the place on the Thursday, not on the Tuesday, but
Thursday&mdash;that was not the first time I had seen the prisoner
there&mdash;I saw him on the Tuesday morning between 9 and 10 o'clock&mdash;I
am quite sure the water-washing was on the Thursday.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by</i> MR. BEST. <i>Q.</i> Were you attending upon your
aunt at this time? <i>A.</i> Yes, I was principally engaged with my aunt during
the day, I when I had nothing to do at the laundry&mdash;my aunt had the up
stairs apartmeats&mdash;I was up and down&mdash;I did not go in and out of
Mullins's room&mdash;I was never in his room in my life&mdash;he washed the
passage&mdash;on the Thursday, it was a wash of a yellowish cast&mdash;I did
not notice whether it, was first white-washed on the Saturday.</p>
<p>MR. SERJEANT PARRY. <i>Q.</i> Did Mullins do anything at all on the Tuesday
in the way of water-washing? <i>A.</i> No.</p>
<p class="cp">GUILTY.&mdash; DEATH.</p>
