<h2><a name="chap1_1"
id="chap1_1">1. ABDUCTION</a></h2>
<p class="first">THE moons of Mars looked down upon a giant
Martian thoat as it raced silently over the soft mossy ground.
Eight powerful legs carried the creature forward in great,
leaping strides.</p>

<p>The path of the mighty beast was guided telepathically by the
two people who sat in a huge saddle that was cinched to the
thoat's broad back.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, to ride
forth weekly to inspect part of her grandfather's vast farming
and industrial kingdom.</p>

<p>Her journey to the farm lands wound through the lonely Helium
Forest where grow the huge trees that furnish much of the lumber
supply to the civilized nations of Mars.</p>

<p>Dawn was just breaking in the eastern Martian sky, and the
jungle was dark and still damp with the evening dew. The gloom of
the forest made Dejah Thoris thankful for the presence of her
companion, who rode in the saddle in front of her. Her hands
rested on his broad, bronze shoulders, and the feel of those
smooth, supple muscles gave her a little thrill of confidence.
One of his hands rested on the jewel-encrusted hilt of his great
long sword and he sat his saddle very straight, for he was the
mightiest warrior on Mars.</p> <hr>

<div align="center"> <img src="0600581h-images/GiantOfMars-02.png"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div> <hr> <br>

<p>John Carter turned to gaze at the lovely face of his
princess.</p>

<p>"Frightened, Dejah Thoris?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never, when I am with my chieftain," Dejah Thoris smiled.</p>

<p>"But what of the forest monsters, the arboks?"</p>

<p>"Grandfather has had them all removed. On the last trip, my
guard killed the only tree reptile I've ever seen."</p>

<p>Suddenly Dejah Thoris gasped, clutched vainly at John Carter
to regain her balance. The mighty thoat lurched heavily to the
mossy ground. The riders catapulted over his head. In an instant
the two had regained their feet; but the thoat lay very
still.</p>

<p>Carter jerked his long sword from its scabbard and motioned
Dejah Thoris to stay at his back.</p>

<p>The silence of the forest was abruptly shattered by an uncanny
roar directly above them.</p>

<p>"An arbok!" Dejah Thoris cried.</p>

<p>The tree reptile launched itself straight for the hated man-
things. Carter lifted his sword and swung quickly to one side,
drawing the monster's attention away from Dejah Thoris who
crouched behind the fallen thoat.</p>

<p>The earthman's first thrust sliced harmlessly through the
beast's outer skin. A huge claw knocked him off balance, and he
found himself lying on the ground with the great fangs at his
throat.</p>

<p>"Dejah Thoris, get the atom gun from the thoat's back," Carter
called hoarsely to the girl. There was no answer.</p>

<p>Calling upon every ounce of his great strength, Carter drove
his sword into the arbok's neck. The creature shuddered. A stream
of blood gushed from the wound. The man wriggled from under the
dead body and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Dejah Thoris! Dejah Thoris!"</p>

<p>Wildly Carter searched the ground and trees surrounding the
dead thoat and arbok. There was no sign of Dejah Thoris. She had
utterly vanished.</p>

<p>A shaft of light from the rising sun filtering through
the foliage glistened on an object at the earthman's feet. Carter
picked up a large shell, a shell recently ejected from a silent
atom gun.</p>

<p>Springing to the dead thoat, he examined the saddle trappings.
The atom gun that he had told Dejah Thoris to fire was still in
its leather boot!</p>

<p>The earthman stooped beside the dead thoat's head. There was a
tiny, bloody hole through its skull. That shot and the charging
arbok had been part of a well conceived plan to abduct Dejah
Thoris, and kill him!</p>

<p>But Dejah Thoris&mdash;how had she disappeared so quickly, so
completely?</p>

<p>Grimly, Carter set off at a run back to the forest toward
Helium.</p>

<p>Noon found the earthman in a private audience chamber of
Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, grandfather of Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>The old jeddak was worried. He thrust a rough piece of
parchment into John Carter's hand. Crude, bold letters were
inscribed upon the parchment; and as Carter scanned the note his
eyes burned with anger. It read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I, Pew Mogel, the most powerful ruler on Mars,
have decided to take over the iron works of Helium. The iron will
furnish me with all the ships I need to protect Helium and the
other cities of Barsoom from invasion. If you have not evacuated
all your workers from the iron mines and factories in three days,
then I will start sending you the fingers of the Royal Princess
of Helium. Hurry, because I may decide to send her tongue, which
wags too much of John Carter. Remember, obey Pew Mogel, for he is
all-powerful."</p>

<p><br>
Tardos Mors dug his nails into the palms of his hands.
"Who is the upstart who calls himself the most powerful ruler of
Mars?"</p>

<p>Carter looked thoughtfully at the note.</p>

<p>"He must have spies here," he said. "Pew Mogel knew that I was
to leave this morning with Dejah Thoris on a tour of
inspection."</p>

<p>"A spy it must have been," Tardos Mors groaned. "I found this
note pinned to the curtains in my private audience-chamber. But
what can we do? Dejah Thoris is the only thing in life that I
have left to love&mdash;" His voice broke.</p>

<p>"All Helium loves her, Tardos Mors, and we will all die before
we return to you empty-handed."</p>

<p>Carter strode to the visiscreen and pushed a button.</p>

<p>"Summon Kantos Kan and Tars Tarkas." He spoke quickly to an
orderly. "Have them come here at once."</p>

<p>Soon after, the huge, green warrior and the lean, red man were
in the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate, John Carter, that I am here in Helium on my
weekly visit from the plains." Tars Tarkas, the green thark,
gripped his massive sword with his powerful four hands. His
great, giant body loomed majestically above the others in the
room.</p>

<p>Kantos Kan laid his hand on John Carter's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I was on my way to the palace when I received your summons.
Already, word of our princess' abduction has spread over Helium.
I came immediately," said the noble fellow, "to offer you my
sword and my heart."</p>

<p>"I have never heard of this Pew Mogel," said Tars Tarkas. "Is
he a green man?"</p>

<p>Tardos Mors grunted, "He's probably some petty outlaw or
criminal who has an overbloated ego."</p>

<p>Carter raised his eyes from the ransom note.</p>

<p>"No, Tardos Mors, I think he is more formidable than you
imagine. He is clever, also. There must have been an airship,
with a silent motor, at hand to carry Dejah Thoris away so
quickly&mdash;or perhaps some great bird! Only a very powerful
man who is prepared to back up his threats would kidnap the
Princess of Helium and even hope to take over the great iron
works.</p>

<p>"He probably has great resources at his command. It is
doubtful, however, if he has any intention of returning the
princess or he would have included more details in his ransom
note."</p>

<p>Suddenly the earthman's keen eyes narrowed. A shadow had moved
in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>With a powerful leap, Carter reached the arched doorway.
A furtive figure melted away into the semi-gloom of the
passageway, with Carter close behind.</p>

<p>Seeing escape impossible, the stranger halted, sank to one
knee and leveled a ray-gun at the approaching figure of the
earthman. Carter saw his finger whiten as he squeezed the
trigger.</p>

<p>"Carter!" Kantos Kan shouted, "throw yourself to the
floor."</p>

<p>With the speed of light, Carter dropped prone. A long blade
whizzed over his head and buried itself to the hilt in the heart
of the stranger.</p>

<p>"One of Pew Mogel's spies," John Carter muttered as he rose to
his feet. "Thank you, Kantos Kan."</p>

<p>Kantos Kan searched the body but found no clue to the man's
identity.</p>

<p>Back in the audience-chamber, the men set to work with fierce
resolve.</p>

<p>They were bending over a huge map of Barsoom when Carter
spoke.</p>

<p>"Cities for miles around Helium are now all friendly. They
would have warned us of this Pew Mogel if they had known of him.
He has probably taken over one of the deserted cities in the dead
sea bottom east or west of Helium. It means thousands of miles to
search; but we will go over each mile."</p>

<p>Carter seated himself at a table and explained his plan.</p>

<p>"Tars Tarkas, go east and contact the chiefs of all your
tribes. I'll cover the west with air scouts, Kantos Kan will stay
in Helium as contact man. Be ready night and day with the entire
Helium air force. Whoever discovers Dejah Thoris first will
notify Kantos Kan of his position. Naturally, we can only
communicate to each other through Kantos Kan. The wave length
will be constant and secret, 2000 kilocycles."</p>

<p>Tardos Mors turned to the earthman.</p>

<p>"Every resource in my kingdom is at your command, John
Carter."</p>

<p>"We leave at once, your majesty; and if Dejah Thoris is alive
on Barsoom, we shall find her," replied John Carter.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap1_2" id="chap1_2">2. THE SEARCH</a></h2>

<p class="first">WITHIN three hours, John Carter was standing on
the roof of the Royal Airdrome giving last-minute instructions to
a fleet of twenty-four fast, one-man scouts.</p>

<p>"Cover all the territory in your district thoroughly. If you
discover anything, don't attempt to handle it by yourself. Notify
Kantos Kan immediately." Carter surveyed the grim faces before
him and knew that they would obey him.</p>

<p>"Let's go." Carter jerked a thumb over his shoulder to the
ships.</p>

<p>The men scattered and soon their planes were speeding away
from Helium.</p>

<p>Carter stayed on the roof long enough to check with Kantos
Kan. He adjusted the earphones around his head and then signalled
on 2000 kilocycles. The dots and dashes of Kantos Kan's reply
began coming in immediately.</p>

<p>"Your signal comes in perfectly. Tars Tarkas is just leaving
the city. The air fleet is mobilizing. The entire air force will
stand by to come to your aid. Kantos Kan signing off."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Night found Carter cruising about five hundred
miles fromHel ium. He was very tired. The search of several ruined
cities and canals had been fruitless. The buzzing of the microset
aroused him again.</p>

<p>"Kantos Kan reporting. Tars Tarkas has organized a complete
ground search east to south; other air scouts west to south
report nothing. Will acquaint you with any news that might come
in. Awaiting orders. Will stand by. Signing off."</p>

<p>"No orders. No news. Carter signing off."</p>

<p>Wearily he let the ship drift. No need to look further until
the moons came up. The earthman fell into a fitful sleep.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the speaker sounded, jerking Carter to
wakefulness. Kantos Kan was signalling again, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Tars Tarkas has found Dejah Thoris. She is held in a deserted
city on the banks of the dead sea at Korvas." Kantos Kan gave the
exact latitude and longitude of the spot.</p>

<p>"Further instructions from Tars Tarkas request the greatest
secrecy in your movements. He will be at the main bridge leading
into the City. Kantos Kan signing, off. Come in, John
Carter."</p>

<p>John Carter signed off with Kantos Kan, urging him to stand by
constantly to be ready with the Helium Air Fleet. Now he set his
gyro-compass, a device that would automatically steer him to his
destination.</p>

<p>Several hours later, the earthman flew over a low range of
hills and saw below him an ancient city on the banks of the Dead
Sea. He circled his plane and dropped to the bridge where he had
been instructed to meet Tars Tarkas. Long, black shadows filled a
dry gully below him.</p>

<p>Carter climbed out of his plane, keeping to the shadows, and
made his way to the towering ruins of the city. It was so quiet
that a lonely bat swooping from a tower sounded like a falling
airship.</p>

<p>Where was Tars Tarkas? The green man should have appeared at
the bridge.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the city, Carter stepped into the black
shadow of a wall and waited. No sound broke the stillness of the
quiet night. The city was like a tomb. Demos and Phobos, the two
fast-moving moons of Mars, whirled across the heavens.</p>

<p>Carter stopped breathing to listen. To his keen ears came the
faint sound of steps&mdash;strange, shuffling steps dragging
closer.</p>

<p>Something was coming along the wall. The earthman tensed,
ready to spring away to his ship. Now he could hear other steps
all around him. Inside the ruins something dragged against the
fallen rocks.</p>

<p>Then a great, heavy body dropped on John Carter from the wall
above. Hot, fetid breath burned his neck. Huge, shaggy arms
smothered him in their fierce embrace.</p>

<p>The thing hurled him to the rough cobblestones. Huge hands
clutched at his throat. Carter turned his head and saw above him
the face of a great, white ape.</p>

<p>Three of the creature's fellows were circling around Carter,
striving to tie his feet with a piece of rope while the other
choked him into insensibility with his four mighty hands.</p>

<p>Carter wriggled his feet under the belly of the ape with whom
he was grappling. One mighty heave sent the creature into the air
to fall, groaning and helpless, to the ground.</p>

<p>Like a cornered banth,* Carter was on his feet, crouched
against the wall, awaiting the attacking trio, with drawn
sword.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A banth&mdash;the huge, eight-legged lion
of Mars. <span class="smcap">Ed</span>. ]</p>

<p>They were mighty beasts, fully eight feet tall with long,
white hair covering their great bodies. Each was equipped with
four muscular arms that ended in tremendous hands armed with
sharp, hooked claws. They were baring their fangs and growling
viciously as they came toward the earthman.</p>

<p>Carter crouched low; and as the beasts sprang in, his earthly
muscles sent him leaping high into the air over their heads. The
earthman's heavy blade, backed by all the power of his muscles,
smacked down upon one ape's head, splitting the skull wide
open.</p>

<p>Carter hit the ground and, turning, was ready when the two
apes remaining flew at him again. There was a hideous, hair-
raising shriek as this time the earthman's sword sank deep into a
savage heart.</p>

<p>As the monster sprawled to the ground, the earthman jerked
free his sword.</p>

<p>Now the other beast turned and slunk away in fright, his eyes
gleaming at Carter in the darkness as it fled down a long
corridor in the adjacent building. The earthman could have sworn
that he heard his own name coming from the ape's throat and
mingling with its sullen growl as it fled away.</p>

<p>The earthman had just seized his sword when he felt a rush of
air above his head. There was a blur of motion as something came
down toward him.</p>

<p>Now he felt himself clutched about the waist; then he was
jerked fifty feet into the air. Struggling for breath, Carter
clutched at the thing encircling his body. It was as horny as the
skin of an arbok. It had hairs as large as tree roots bristling
from the horny scales.</p>

<p><i>It was a giant hand!</i></p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_3" id="chap1_3">3. JOOG THE GIANT</a></h2>

<p class="first">JOHN CARTER found himself looking into a
monstrous face.</p>

<p>From top of shaggy head to bottom of its hairy chin, the head
measured fully fifteen feet.</p>

<p>A new monstrosity had come to life on Mars. Judging by the
adjacent buildings, the creature must have been a hundred and
thirty feet tall!</p>

<p>The giant raised Carter high over his head and shook him; then
he threw back his face. Hideous, hollow laughter rumbled out of
his pendulous lips revealing teeth like small mountain crags.</p>

<p>He was dressed in an ill-fitting, baggy tunic that came down
in loose folds over his hips but which allowed his arms and legs
to be free.</p>

<p>With his other hand he beat his mighty chest.</p>

<p>"I, Joog. I, Joog," he kept repeating as he continued to laugh
and shake his helpless victim. "I can kill! I can kill!"</p>

<p>Joog, the giant, commenced to walk. Carefully he stepped along
the barren streets, sometimes going around a building that was
too high to step over.</p>

<p>Finally he stopped before a partially ruined palace. The
ravages of time had only dimmed its beauty. Huge masses of moss
and vines trailed through the masonry, hiding the shattered
battlements. With a sudden thrust, Joog, the giant, shoved John
Carter through a high window in the palace tower.</p>

<p>When Carter felt the giant's hold releasing upon him he
relaxed completely. He hit the stone floor in a long roll,
protecting his head with his arms. As he lay in the deep darkness
of the place where he had fallen, the earthman listened while he
regained his breath.</p>

<p>No sound came to his ears for some time; then he began to hear
the heavy breathing of Joog outside his window. Once more
Carter's earthly muscles, reacting to the lesser gravity of Mars,
sent him leaping twenty feet to the sill of the narrow window.
Here he clung and looked once again into the hairy, hideous face
of the giant.</p>

<p>"I, Joog. I, Joog," he mumbled. "I can kill! I can kill!" The
giant's breath swept over Carter like a blast from a sulphur
furnace. There would be no escape from that window!</p>

<p>Once more he dropped down into his cell. This time he
commenced a slow circuit of the room, groping his way along the
polished ersite slabs that formed the wall. The cobblestone floor
was thick with debris. Once, Carter heard the sinister hiss of a
Martian spider as he brushed its web.</p>

<p>How long he groped his way around the walls, there was no way
of knowing. It seemed hours. Then, suddenly, the deathly silence
was shattered by a woman's scream coming from somewhere in the
building.</p>

<p>John Carter could feel his skin grew cold. Could that have
been the voice of Dejah Thoris?</p>

<p>Once again John Carter leaped toward the faint light that
marked the window ledge. Cautiously, he looked down. Joog lay on
his back on the flagstones below, breathing as though he were
asleep, his great chest rising five feet with every breath.</p>

<p>Quietly he started to edge his way along a ledge that ran from
the window and disappeared into the shadow of an adjoining tower.
If he could make that shadow without awakening Joog!</p>

<p>He had almost gained his objective when Joog growled
hoarsely.</p>

<p>He had opened one great eye. Now he reached up and, grabbing
Carter by the leg, hurled him into the tower window again.</p>

<p>Wearily, the earthman crawled to the wall of his dark cell and
there slumped down against it. That scream haunted his memory. He
was tormented by the thought that Dejah Thoris might be in
danger.</p>

<p>And where was Tars Tarkas? Pew Mogel must have captured him,
too. Carter suddenly sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>One of the ersite slabs at his back had moved! He waited.
Nothing came out. Cautiously, he approached the rock and shoved
it with his foot. The slab moved slightly inward. Now Carter
shoved the stone with all his tremendous strength. Inch by inch
he moved it until finally there was room for him to squeeze his
body through.</p>

<p>He was still in utter darkness, but his gripping fingers
revealed to him that he was in a corridor between two walls.
Perhaps this was the way out of his prison!</p>

<p>Carefully he shoved the stone back into position, leaving no
trace of his disappearance from the room. The corridor in which
he found himself was so low that he was forced to crawl on hands
and knees. The low corridor had the stench of age, as if it had
been unused for a long time.</p>

<p>Gradually the tunnel sloped more and more downward. Many
little side-passages branched off from the main tunnel. There was
no light, no noise. Only a faint, pungent odor beginning to fill
the air.</p>

<p>Now it was growing lighter. The earthman realized that he must
be in the subterranean caverns of the palace. The dim light was
caused by the phosphorescent radium glow that is used on all Mars
for radiation.</p>

<p>The source of this faint light the earthman suddenly
discovered. It was shining through a cleft in the wall ahead.
Pushing aside another loose stone, John Carter crawled forth into
a chamber. He drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>Facing him was a warrior with drawn sword, the point of which
was almost touching the breast of the earthman!</p>

<p>John Carter leaped back with the speed of lightning, whipped
out his own sword and struck at the other's weapon.</p>

<p>The arm of the red man fell from his body to the floor where
it dissolved into dust. The ancient sword clattered on the
cobblestones.</p>

<p>Carter could see now that the warrior had been leaning against
the wall, balanced there precariously for ages, his sword arm
extending in front of him just as it had stiffened long ago in
death. The loss of the arm overbalanced the torso which toppled
to the floor and there dissolved into a heap of ash-like
dust!</p>

<p>In an adjoining chamber there were a score of women, beautiful
girls, chained together by collars of gold around their necks.
They sat at a table where they had been eating, and the food was
still before them. They had been the prisoners, the slaves of the
rulers of the long-dead city. The dry, motionless air combined
with some gaseous secretion from the walls and dungeons had
preserved their beauty through the ages.</p>

<p>The earthman had traversed some little distance down a musty
corner when he became aware of something scraping behind him.
Whirling into a side corridor he looked back. Gleaming eyes were
coming toward him. They followed him as he backed into the
tunnel.</p>

<p>Now again came the scraping, repeated this time farther ahead
in the tunnel. Other eyes shone ahead of him.</p>

<p>John Carter ran forward, his sword-point extended. The eyes
ahead retreated, but those in back of him started to close.</p>

<p>It was very dark now, but far ahead the earthman could see a
faint gleam of light filtering into the tunnel.</p>

<p>He ran toward the light. Fighting the things where he could
see them would be a lot easier than stumbling around in a dark
corridor.</p>

<p>Carter entered the room and in the dim light came face to face
with the creature whose eyes he had seen ahead of him in the
tunnel. It was a species of the huge three-legged Martian rat!</p>

<p>Its yellow fangs were bared hideously in a vicious snarl, as
it backed slowly away from Carter to the far end of the small
room.</p>

<p>Now behind him came the other rat, and together the two beasts
started to close in upon the earthman.</p>

<p>Carter smiled grimly as he gripped his sword.</p>

<p>"I am the proverbial cornered rat now," he muttered as he
swung his blade at the nearest creature.</p>

<p>It ducked the blow and scurried toward him.</p>

<p>But the earthman's sword was ready. The charging rat lunged
full upon the waiting sword-point.</p>

<p>The momentum of the beast carried Carter back five feet; but
he still retained a hold on his sword, the point of which had
plunged through the animal's single shoulder and pierced its wild
heart.</p>

<p>When Carter had jerked free his sword and turned to meet his
other antagonist an exclamation of dismay escaped his lips.</p>

<p>The room was half filled with rats!</p>

<p>The creatures had entered through another opening and had
formed a circle around him, waiting to attack.</p>

<p>For half an hour, Carter battled furiously for his life in the
lonely dungeon beneath the palace in the ancient city of
Korvas.</p>

<p>The carcasses of the dead rats were piled high around him, but
still they came and eventually they overpowered him by their very
numbers.</p>

<p>John Carter went down by a terrific blow to his head from a
snake-like tail.</p>

<p>He was half stunned, but he still clung tenaciously to his
sword as he felt himself seized by the arms and dragged away into
the darkness of an adjoining tunnel.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_4" id="chap1_4">4. THE CITY OF RATS</a></h2>

<p class="first">JOHN CARTER recovered fully when he was dragged
through a pool of muddy water. He heard the rats greedily
drinking, saw their green eyes gleaming in the darkness. The
smell of freshly dug earth reached his nostrils and he realized
that he was in a burrow far under the subterranean vaults of the
palace.</p>

<p>Several rats on either side of him had hold of his arms by
their forepaws as they dragged him along. It was very
uncomfortable, and he wondered how much longer the journey would
last.</p>

<p>Nor had he long to wait. The strange company finally came out
into a huge underground cavern. Light from the outside filtered
down through various openings in the ceiling above, its rays
reflecting on thousands of gleaming stalactites of red sand
stone. Massive stalagmites, huge sedimentary formations of
grotesque shape, rose up from the floor of the cavern.</p>

<p>Among these formations on the floor were numerous domeshaped
mud huts.</p>

<p>As Carter was dragged by, he stared at a hut that several rats
were constructing. The framework was composed of white sticks of
various shapes plastered with mud from an underground stream bed.
The white sticks were very irregular in length and size. One of
the rats stopped work to gnaw at a stick. It looked like a
bone.</p>

<p>As he was dragged closer, he saw that the stick was a human
thigh bone!</p>

<p>The mud huts were studded with bones and skulls, upon some of
which were still dangling hideously the vestiges of hair and
skin. Carter noticed that the tops of all the skulls had been
removed, neatly sliced off.</p>

<p>The earthman was dragged to a clearing in the center of the
cavern. Here, upon a mound of skulls, sat a rat half again as
large as the others.</p>

<p>The baleful, pink eyes of the creature glared at Carter as he
was dragged up on top of the mound.</p>

<p>The beasts released their hold upon the earthman and descended
to the bottom of the mound, leaving Carter alone with the large
rat.</p>

<p>The long whiskers of the monster were constantly twitching as
the thing sniffed at the man. It had lost one ear in some battle
long ago and the other was bright with scar-tissue.</p>

<p>Its little pink eyes surveyed Carter for a long time while it
fondly caressed its long, hairless tail with its one claw-like
paw.</p>

<p>This, evidently, was the King of the Rats.</p>

<p>"Lord of the Underworld," Carter thought, trying to hold his
breath. The stench in the cavern was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes from Carter's, the rat reached down
and picked up a skull beside him and put it in front of Carter.
This he repeated, picking up a skull from the other side and
placing it beside the first. By repeating this, he eventually
formed a little ring of topless heads in front of the earth-
man.</p>

<p>Now, very judiciously, he climbed inside the circle of skulls
and picking one of them up tossed it to Carter. The earthman
caught it and tossed it back at the king.</p>

<p>This seemed to annoy his royal highness. He made no effort to
catch the skull and it flew past him and went bouncing down the
mound.</p>

<p>Instead, the king leaped up and down inside the little circle
of skulls, at the same time emitting angry squeals.</p>

<p>This was all very puzzling to the earthman. As he stood there,
he became aware of two circles of rats forming at the base of the
mound, each circle consisting of about a thousand animals. They
began a weird dance, moving around the raised dais of bones
counter-clockwise. The tail of each rat was gripped in the mouth
of the following beast, thus forming a continuous chain.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the earthman was in the center of a
weird ritual. While he was ignorant of the exact nature of the
ceremony, he had little doubt as to its final outcome. The
countless barren skulls, the yellowed ones that filled the cavern
were mute, horrible evidence of his final fate.</p>

<p>Where did the rats get all the bodies from which the skulls
were obtained and why were the tops of those skulls missing? The
City of Korvas, as every Martian schoolboy knew, had been
deserted for a thousand years; yet many of the skulls and bones
were recently picked clean of their flesh. Carter had seen no
evidence in the city of any life other than the great white apes
and the mysterious giant, and the rats themselves.</p>

<p>However, there had been the woman's scream that he had heard
earlier. This thought accentuated his ever-present anxiety over
Dejah Thoris's safety and whereabouts.</p>

<p>This delay was tormenting. As the circles of rats closed in
about him, the earthman's eyes eagerly searched for some avenue
of escape.</p>

<p>The rats circled slowly, watching their king who rose to his
hind legs stamping his feet, thumping his tail. The mound of
skulls echoed hollowly.</p>

<p>Faster danced the king and faster moved the circles of rats
drawing ever closer to the mound.</p>

<p>The closer rats shot hungry glances at the earthman. Carter
smiled grimly and gripped his sword more tightly. Strange that
they should let him retain it.</p>

<p>More than one of the beasts would die before he was overcome,
and the king would be the first to go. There was no doubt that he
was to be sacrificed to furnish a gastronomic orgy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the king stopped his wild gyrations directly in front
of Carter. The dancers halted instantly, watching, waiting.</p>

<p>A strange, growling squeal started deep in the king's throat
and grew in volume to an ear-piercing shriek. The King of Rats
stepped over the ring of skulls and advanced slowly toward
Carter.</p>

<p>Once again the earthman glanced about seeking some means of
escape from the mound. This time he looked up. The ceiling was at
least fifty feet away. No native-born Martian would ever consider
escaping in that direction.</p>

<p>But John Carter had been born on the planet Earth, and he had
brought with him to Mars all the strength and agility of a
trained athlete.</p>

<p>It was upon this, combined with the lesser gravity of Mars,
that the earthman made his quick plan for the next moment.</p>

<p>Tensely he waited for his opportunity. The ceremony was nearly
concluded. The king was baring his fangs not a foot from Carter's
neck.</p>

<p>The earthman's hand tightened on his sword-hilt; then the
blade streaked from its scabbard. There was a blur of motion and
a sickening smack. The king's head flew into the air and then
rolled away, bouncing down the mound.</p>

<p>The other beasts beneath were stunned into silence, but only
momentarily. Now, squealing wildly, they swarmed up the mount
intent on tearing the earthman to pieces.</p>

<p>John Carter crouched and with a mighty leap his earthly
muscles sent him shooting fifty feet up into the air.</p>

<p>Desperately he clutched and held to a hanging stalactite. Soon
he was swinging on the hanging moss to the vast upper reaches of
the cavern.</p>

<p>Once he looked down to see the rats milling and squealing in
confusion beneath. One other fact he noted, also. Apparently
there was only one means of entrance or exit into the dungeon
that formed the rats' underground city, the same tunnel through
which he had first been dragged.</p>

<p>Now, however, the earthman was intent upon finding some means
of exit in the ceiling above.</p>

<p>At last he found a narrow opening; and plunging through a
heavy curtain of moss Carter swung into a cave.</p>

<p>There were several tunnels branching off into the darkness,
most of them thickly hung with the sticky webs of the great
Martian spider. They were evidently parts of a vast underground
network of tunnels that had been fashioned long ages ago by the
ancients who once inhabited Korvas.</p>

<p>Carter was ready with his blade for any encounter with man or
beast that might come his way; and so he started off up the
largest tunnel.</p>

<p>The perpetually burning radium light that had been set in the
wall when the tunnel was constructed furnished sufficient
illumination for the earthman to see his way quite clearly.</p>

<p>Carter halted before a massive door set into the end of a
tunnel. It was inscribed with hieroglyphics unfamiliar to the
earthman. The subdued drone of what sounded like many motors
seemed to come from somewhere beyond the door.</p>

<p>He pushed open the unbarred door and halted just beyond,
staring unbelievingly at the tremendous laboratory in which he
found himself.</p>

<p>Great motors pumped oxygen through low pipes into rows of
glass cages that lined the walls and filled the antiseptically
white chamber from end to end. In the center of the laboratory
were several operating tables with large searchlights focused
down upon them from above.</p>

<p>But the contents of the glass cages immediately absorbed the
earthman's attention.</p>

<p>Each cage contained a giant white ape, standing upright
inside, apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>The top of each hairy head was swathed in bandages. If these
beasts were dead, why then the oxygen tubes running to their
cages?</p>

<p>Carter moved across the room to examine the cases at closer
range. Halfway to the farther wall he came upon a low, glassed
dome that covered a huge pit set in the floor.</p>

<p>He gasped. The pit was filled with dead bodies, red warriors
with the tops of their heads neatly sliced off!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_5" id="chap1_5">5. CHAMBER OF HORRORS</a></h2>

<p class="first">FAR below, in the pit, John Carter could see
forms moving in and about the bodies of the dead red men.</p>

<p>They were rats; and as he watched the earthman could see them
dragging bodies off into adjoining tunnels. These tunnels
probably entered the main one which ran into the rats'
underground city.</p>

<p>So this was where the beasts got the skulls and bones with
which they constructed their odorous, underground dwellings!</p>

<p>Carter's eyes scanned the laboratory. He noted the operating
tables, the encased instruments above, the anesthetics.
Everything pointed to some grisly experiment, conducted by some
insane scientist.</p>

<p>Within a glass case were many books. One ponderous volume was
inscribed in gold letters: PEW MOGEL, HIS LIFE AND WONDERFUL
WORKS.</p>

<p>The earthman frowned. What was the explanation? Why this well-
equipped laboratory buried in an ancient lost city, a city
apparently deserted except for apes, rats, and a giant man?</p>

<p>Why the cases about the wall containing the mute, motionless
bodies of apes with bandaged heads? And the red men in the
pit&mdash;why were their skulls cut in half, their brains
removed?</p>

<p>From whence came the giant, the monstrous creature whose
likeness had existed only in the Barsoomian folklore?</p>

<p>One of the books in a case before Carter bore the name "Pew
Mogel". What connection had Pew Mogel with all this and who was
the man?</p>

<p>But more important, where was Dejah Thoris, the Princess of
Helium?</p>

<p>John Carter reached for Pew Mogel's book. Suddenly the room
fell silent. The generators that had been humming out their
power, stopped.</p>

<p>"Touch not that book, John Carter," came the words echoing
through the laboratory.</p>

<p>Carter's hand dropped to his sword. There was a moment's
pause; then the hidden voice continued.</p>

<p>"Give yourself up, John Carter, or your princess dies." The
words were apparently coming from a concealed loudspeaker
somewhere in the room.</p>

<p>"Through the door to your right, earthman, the door to your
right."</p>

<p>Carter immediately sensed a trap. He crossed to the door.
Warily, he pushed it open with his foot.</p>

<p>Upon a gorgeous throne at the far end of a huge dome-shaped
chamber sat a hideous, misshapen man. A tiny, bullet head
squatted upon massive shoulders.</p>

<p>Everything about the creature seemed distorted. His torso was
crooked, his arms were not equal in length; one foot was larger
than the other.</p>

<p>The face in the diminutive head leered at John Carter. A thick
tongue hung partly out over yellowed teeth.</p>

<p>The hulking body was encased in gorgeous trappings of platinum
and diamonds. One claw-like hand stroked the bare head.</p>

<p>From head to foot there was apparently not a hair on his
body.</p>

<p>At the man's feet crouched a great, four-armed shaggy
brute&mdash;another white ape. Its little red eyes were fixed
steadily upon the earthman as he stood at the far end of the
chamber.</p>

<p>The man on the throne idly fingered the microphone with which
he had summoned Carter to the room.</p>

<p>"I have trapped you at last, John Carter!" Beady, cocked eyes
glared with hatred. "You cannot cope with the great brain of Pew
Mogel!"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel turned to a television screen studded with dials and
lights of various colors.</p>

<p>His face twisted into a smile. "You honor my humble city, John
Carter. It is with the greatest interest I have watched your
progress through the many chambers of the palace with my
television machine." Pew Mogel patted the machine.</p>

<p>"This little invention of my good teacher, Ras Thavas,"
continued Pew Mogel, "which I acquired from him, has been an
invaluable aid to me in learning of your intended search for my
unworthy person. It was unfortunate that you should suspect the
honorable intentions of my agent that afternoon in the Jeddak's
chambers.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, however, he had already completed his mission;
and through an extension upon this television set, concealed
cleverly behind a mirror in the Jeddak's private throne room, I
was able to see and hear the entire proceedings."</p>

<p>Pew Mogel laughed vacantly, his little unblinking eyes staring
steadily at Carter who remained motionless at the other end of
the room.</p>

<p>The earthman could see nothing in the chamber that indicated a
trap. The walls and floor were all of grey, polished ersite
slabs. Carter stood at one end of a long aisle leading to Pew
Mogel's throne.</p>

<p>Slowly he advanced toward Pew Mogel, his hand grasping his
sword, the muscles of his arm etched bands of steel.</p>

<p>Halfway down the aisle, the earthman halted. "Where is Dejah
Thoris?" His words cut the air.</p>

<p>The microcephalic head* of Pew Mogel cocked to one side.
Carter waited for him to speak.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A microcephalic head is one possessing a
very small brain capacity. It is the opposite of megacephalic,
which means a large brain capacity. Generally microcephalia is a
sign of idiocy, although in the case of Pew Mogel, the condition
did not mean idiocy, but extreme craftiness, and madness, which
might indicate that, since Pew Mogel was an artificial, synthetic
product of Ras Thavas, one of Mars's most famous scientists, his
microcephalia was either caused by a disease, or by inability of
the brain to adapt itself to a foreign ill-fitting cranial
cavity. Pew Mogel's head was obviously too small for his body, or
for his brain. <span class="smcap">Ed</span>. ]</p>

<p>In spite of having the features of a man, Pew Mogel did not
look quite human. There was something indescribably repulsive
about him, the thin lips, the hollow cheeks, the close-set
eyes.</p>

<p>The Carter realized that those eyes were unblinking. There
were no eyelids. The man's eyes could never close. Pew Mogel
spoke coldly. "I am greatly indebted to you for this visit. I was
fortunate enough to be able to entertain your princess and your
best friend; but I hardly dared to hope you would honor me,
too."</p>

<p>Carter's face was expressionless. Slowly he repeated, "Where
is Dejah Thoris?"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel leered mockingly.</p>

<p>The earthman advanced toward the throne. The white ape at Pew
Mogel's feet growled, the hairs on its neck bristling upright as
Pew Mogel flinched slightly.</p>

<p>Again the twisted smile passed over his face as he raised his
hand toward John Carter and drawled.</p>

<p>"Have patience, John Carter, and I will show you your
princess; but first, perhaps you will be interested in seeing the
man who, last night, told you to meet him at the main bridge
outside the city."</p>

<p>Pew Mogel hooked one of his fingers over a lever projecting
from the golden arm of his throne and slipped it toward himself.
A pillar to the left of his throne, half set in the wall, began
to revolve slowly.</p>

<p>A giant green man appeared, chained to the pillar. His four
mighty arms were strapped securely; and for Pew Mogel's
additional safety, several steel chains were wrapped around his
body and cinched with massive padlocks. His neck and ankles were
also secured with bands of steel, also padlocked.</p>

<p>"Tars Tarkas!" Carter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Kaor, John Carter," there was a grim smile on Tars Tarkas'
face as he replied. "I see our friend here trapped us both the
same way; but it took a giant fifteen times my size to hold me
while they trussed me in these chains."</p>

<p>"The message you sent me last night&mdash;" In a flash, Carter
realized the truth. Pew Mogel had faked the messages from Kantos
Kan and Tars Tarkas, trapping them both in the city the night
before.</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent you both identical messages," said Pew Mogel,
"each message apparently from the other. The proper broadcasting
length I ascertained from listening to the concealed microphone I
had planted in the Jeddak's throne room. Clever, eh?"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's left eye suddenly popped out of its socket and
dangled on his cheek. He took no notice of it, but continued to
speak, glancing first at Carter and then at Tars Tarkas with the
other eye.</p>

<p>"You have both met Joog," stated Pew Mogel. "One hundred and
thirty feet tall, he is all muscle, a product of science, the
result of my great brain. With my own hands I created him from
living flesh, the greatest fighting monster that Barsoom has ever
seen. I modeled him from the organs, tissues, and bones of ten
thousand red men and white apes."</p>

<p>Pew Mogel, becoming aware of his left eye, quickly shoved it
back into place.</p>

<p>Tars Tarkas laughed one of his rare laughs. "Pew Mogel," he
said, "you are falling apart. As you claim to have created your
giant, so you yourself have been made.</p>

<p>"Unless I miss my guess, John Carter," continued Tars Tarkas,
"this freak before us who calls himself a king has, himself,
crawled out of a tissue vat!"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's pallid countenance turned even paler as he leaped
to his feet. He struck Tars Tarkas a vicious blow on the
face.</p>

<p>"Silence, green man!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>Tars Tarkas only smiled at this insult, ignoring the pain.
John Carter's face was a frozen mask. One more blow at his
defenseless friend would have sent him at Pew Mogel's throat.</p>

<p>Better to bide his time, he knew, until he learned where Dejah
Thoris was hidden.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel sank back upon his throne. The white ape, who had
risen, once more squatted down at his master's feet.</p>

<p>Presently Pew Mogel smiled again.</p>

<p>"So sorry," he drawled, "that I lost my temper. Sometimes I
forget that my present appearance reveals the nature of my
origin.</p>

<p>"You see, soon I shall have trained one of my apes in the
intricate procedure of transferring my marvelous brain into a
suitable, handsome body; then no one will guess that I am not
like any other normal man on Barsoom."</p>

<p>John Carter smiled grimly at Pew Mogel's words.</p>

<p>"Then you <i>are</i> one of Ras Thavas' synthetic men?"</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_6" id="chap1_6">6. PEW MOGEL</a></h2>

<p class="first">"YES, I am a synthetic man," answered Pew Mogel
slowly. "My brain was the greatest achievement of all The Master
Mind's creations.</p>

<p>"For years I was a devoted pupil of Ras Thavas in his
laboratories at Morbus. I learned all that the Master could teach
me of the secrets of creating living tissue. When I learned from
him all that I thought necessary to pursue my plans, I left
Morbus. With a hundred synthetic men I escaped over the Great
Toonolian Marshes on the backs of malagors, the birds of
transport.</p>

<p>"I brought with me all the intricate equipment that I could
steal from his laboratories. The rest, I have fashioned here in
this ancient deserted city where we finally landed."</p>

<p>John Carter was studying Pew Mogel intently.</p>

<p>"I was tired of being a slave," continued Pew Mogel. "I wanted
to rule; and by Issus, I have ruled; and some day I shall rule
all Barsoom!"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>"It was not long before red men gathered in our city, escaped
and exiled criminals. Since their faces would only lead them to
capture and execution in other civilized cities on Barsoom, I
persuaded them to allow me to transfer their brains into the
bodies of the stupid white apes that overran this city.</p>

<p>"I promised to later restore their brains into the bodies of
other red men, provided they would help me in my conquests."</p>

<p>Carter recalled the apes with the bandaged heads in the
adjoining laboratory, and the red men with their skulls sliced
off in the chamber of the rats. He began to understand a little;
then he remembered Joog.</p>

<p>"But the giant?" asked John Carter. "Whence came he?"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel was silent for a minute; then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Joog I have built, piece by piece, during several years, from
the bones, tissues and organs of a thousand red men and white
apes who came voluntarily to me or whom I captured.</p>

<p>"Even his brain is the synthesis of the brains of ten thousand
red men and white apes. Into Joog's veins I have pumped a serum
that makes all tissues self-repairing.</p>

<p>"My giant is practically indestructible. No bullet or cannon-
shot made can stop him!"</p>

<p>Pew Mogel smiled and stroked his hairless chin.</p>

<p>"Think how powerful my ape soldiers will be," he purred, "each
one armed with the great strength of an ape. With their four arms
they can hold twice as many weapons as ordinary men, and inside
their skulls will function the cunning brains of human
beings.</p>

<p>"With Joog and my army of white apes, I can go forth and
become master of all Barsoom." Pew Mogel paused and then added,
"provided I acquire more iron for even greater weapons than I
already have."</p>

<p>Now Pew Mogel had risen from his throne in his great
excitement.</p>

<p>"I preferred to conquer peacefully by first acquiring the
Helium iron works as payment for Dejah Thoris's safe return. But
the Jeddak and John Carter force me into other alternatives.
However, I'll give you one more chance to settle peacefully," he
said.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's hand moved toward the right arm of his throne, as
he pulled a duplicate lever. A beautiful woman swung into
view.</p>

<p>It was Dejah Thoris!</p>

<p>At the sight of his princess chained to the other pillar
before him John Carter grew very pale. He sprang forward to free
her.</p>

<p>His earthly muscles could have easily covered the distance in
one leap; but halfway there in his spring, Dejah Thoris and Tars
Tarkas saw the earthman sprawl in mid-air as though he had struck
full force against some invisible barrier. Half-stunned, he
crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris gave a little cry. Tars Tarkas strained at his
bonds. Slowly, the earthman rose to his feet, shaking his body
like some majestic animal. With his sword he reached down and
felt the barrier that stood between him and the throne.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"You are trapped, John Carter. The invisible glass partition
that you struck is another invention of the great Ras Thavas that
I acquired. It is invulnerable.</p>

<p>"From there, you may watch the torture of your princess,
unless she sees fit to sign a note to her father demanding the
surrender of Helium to me."</p>

<p>The earthman looked at his princess not ten feet from him.
Dejah Thoris held her head proudly high, which was answer enough
to Pew Mogel's demands that she betray her people.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel saw, and angrily issued a command to the ape. The
white brute rose and ambled over to Dejah Thoris. Grabbing her
hair with one paw, he forced her head back until he could see her
face. His hideous grinning face was not two inches from hers.</p>

<p>"Demand Helium's surrender," hissed Pew Mogel, "and you shall
have your freedom!"</p>

<p>"Never!" the word shot back at him.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel flung another command to the ape.</p>

<p>The creature planted his great, pendulous lips on those of the
princess. Dejah Thoris went limp in his embrace, while Tars
Tarkas surged vainly at the steel chains. The girl had
fainted.</p>

<p>The earthman again hurled himself futilely against the barrier
that he could not see.</p>

<p>"Fool," yelled Pew Mogel, "I gave you your chance to retain
your princess by turning over to me the Helium iron works; but
you and the Jeddak thought you could thwart me and regain Dejah
Thoris without paying me the price I asked for her safe return.
For that mistake, you all die."</p>

<p>Pew Mogel again reached over to the instrument board beside
his throne. He began to turn several dials, and Carter heard a
strange, droning noise that increased steadily in volume.</p>

<p>Suddenly the earthman turned and raced for the door through
which he came.</p>

<p>But before he had covered fifteen feet, another barrier had
closed down. Escape through the door was impossible.</p>

<p>There was a window over on the wall to his right. He leaped
for it. He struck another glass barrier.</p>

<p>There was another window on the left side of the room. He had
nearly reached it when he was met by another wall of invisible
glass.</p>

<p>In a flash he became acutely conscious of his predicament. The
walls were moving in upon him. He could see now that the glass
barriers had moved out from cleverly concealed slits in the
adjoining walls.</p>

<p>The two side barriers, however, were fastened to horizontal
pistons in the ceiling. These pistons were moving together,
bringing the glass walls toward each other, and would eventually
crush the earthman between them.</p>

<p>Upon John Carter's finger was a jeweled ring. Set in the
center of the ring was a large diamond. Diamonds can cut
glass!</p>

<p>Here was a new type of glass, but the chances were it was not
as hard as the diamond on Carter's finger!</p>

<p>The earthman clenched his fist, pressed the diamond ring
against the barrier in front of him and quickly made a large
circular scratch in the glass surface.</p>

<p>Then he crashed his body with all his strength against the
area of glass enclosed by the scratch.</p>

<p>The section broke out neatly at the blow, and the earthman
found himself face to face with Pew Mogel.</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris had regained consciousness, a set, intent
expression on her beautiful face. A grim smile had settled over
Tars Tarkas's lips when he saw that his friend was no longer
impeded by the invisible barriers.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel shrank back on his throne and gasped in a cracked
voice.</p>

<p>"Seize him, Gore, seize him!" Little beads of sweat stood
forth on his brow.</p>

<p>Gore, the white ape, released his hold on Dejah Thoris and,
turning, saw the earthman advancing toward them. Gore snarled
viciously, revealing jagged, mighty fangs. He crouched low, so
that his four massive fists supported his weight on the floor.
His little, beady, blood-shot eyes gleamed hatred, for Gore hated
all men save Pew Mogel.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_7" id="chap1_7">7. THE FLYING TERROR</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS Gore, the great white ape with a man's brain,
crouched to meet John Carter, he was fully confident of
overcoming his puny man opponent.</p>

<p>But to make assurance doubly sure, Gore drew the great blade
at his side and rushed madly at his foe, hacking and cutting
viciously.</p>

<p>The momentum of the brute's attack forced Carter backward a
few steps as he deftly warded off the mighty blows.</p>

<p>But the earthman saw his chance. Quickly, surely, his blade
streaked. There was a sudden twist and Gore's sword went hurtling
across the room.</p>

<p>Gore, however, reacted with lightning speed. With his four
huge hands he grasped the naked steel of the earthman's
sword.</p>

<p>Violently he jerked the blade from Carter's grasp and, raising
it overhead, snapped the strong steel in two as if it had been a
splinter of wood.</p>

<p>Now, with a low growl, Gore closed in; and Carter
crouched.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man leaped over the ape's head; but again with
uncanny speed the monster shot out a hairy hand and grasped the
earthman's ankle.</p>

<p>Gore held John Carter in his four hands, drawing the man
closer and closer to the drooling jowls and gleaming fangs.</p>

<p>But with a surge of his mighty muscles, the earthman jerked
free his arm and sent a terrific blow crashing full into Gore's
face.</p>

<p>The ape recoiled, dropping John Carter, and staggered back
toward the huge window on the right wall by Pew Mogel's
throne.</p>

<p>Here the beast tottered; and the earthman, seeing his chance,
once again leaped into the air, but this time flew feet foremost
toward the ape.</p>

<p>At the moment of contact with the ape's chest, Carter extended
his legs violently; and so, as his feet struck Gore, this force
was added to the hurtling momentum of his body.</p>

<p>With a bellowing cry, Gore hurtled out through the window and
his screams ended only when he landed with a sickening crunch in
the courtyard far below.</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris and Tars Tarkas, chained to the pillars, had
watched the short fight, fascinated by the earthman's sure, quick
actions.</p>

<p>But when Carter did not succumb instantly to Gore's attack,
Pew Mogel had grown frightened. He began jerking dials and
switches; and then spoke swiftly into the little microphone
beside him.</p>

<p>So now, as the earthman regained his feet and advanced slowly
toward Pew Mogel, he did not see the black shadow that obscured
the window behind him.</p>

<p>Only when Dejah Thoris screamed a warning did the earthman
turn.</p>

<p>But he was too late!</p>

<p>A giant hand, fully three feet across, closed about his body.
He was lifted from the floor and pulled out quickly through the
window.</p>

<p>To Carter's ears came the hopeless cry of his princess mingled
with the cruel, hollow laugh of Pew Mogel.</p>

<p>Carter did not need the added assurance of his eyes to know
that he was being held in the grasp of Pew Mogel's synthetic
giant. Joog's fetid breath blasting across his face was ample
evidence.</p>

<p>Joog held Carter several feet from his face and contracted his
features in the semblance of a grin, exposing his two great rows
of cracked, stained teeth the size of sharp boulders.</p>

<p>Hoarse, gurgling sounds emanated from Joog's throat as he held
the earthman before his face.</p>

<p>"I, Joog. I, Joog," the monster finally managed. "I can kill!
I can kill!"</p>

<p>Then he shook his victim until the man's teeth rattled.</p>

<p>But quite suddenly the giant was quiet, listening; then Carter
became aware of muffled words coming, apparently, from Joog's
ear.</p>

<p>Then John Carter realized that the command was coming from Pew
Mogel, transmitted by short wave to a receiving device attached
to one of Joog's ears.</p>

<p>"To the arena," repeated the voice. "Fasten him over the
pit!"</p>

<p>The pit&mdash;what new form of devilish torture was this?
Carter tried vaguely to ease the awful pressure that was crushing
him.</p>

<p>But his arms were pinned to his sides by the giant's grasp.
All the man could do was breathe laboriously and hope that Joog's
great strides would soon bring them to his destination, whatever
that might be.</p>

<p>The giant's tremendous pace, stepping over tall, ancient
edifices or across wide, spacious plazas in single, mighty
strides, soon brought them to a large, crowded amphitheater on
the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>The amphitheater apparently was fashioned from a natural
crater. Row upon row of circular tiers had been carved within the
inner wall of the crater, forming a series of levels upon which
sat thousands of white apes.</p>

<p>In the center of the arena was a circular pit about fifty feet
across. The pit contained what appeared to be water whose level
was about fifteen feet from the top of the pit.</p>

<p>Three iron-barred cages hung suspended over the center of the
pit by means of three heavy ropes, one attached to the top of
each cage and running up through a pulley in the scaffolding
built overhead and down to the edge of the pit where it was
anchored.</p>

<p>Joog climbed partly over the edge of the coliseum and
deposited Carter on the brink of the pit. Five great apes held
him there while another ape lowered one of the cages to ground
level.</p>

<p>Then he reached out with a hooked pole and swung the cage over
the edge. He unlocked the cage door with a large key.</p>

<p>The keeper for the key was a short, heavy-set ape with a bull
neck and exceedingly close-set eyes.</p>

<p>This brute now came up to Carter and although the captive was
being held by five other apes, he grabbed him cruelly by the hair
and jerked Carter into the cage, at the same time kicking him
viciously.</p>

<p>The cage door was slammed immediately, it's padlock bolted
closed. Now Carter's cage was pulled up over the pit and the rope
anchored to a davit at the edge.</p>

<p>It was not long before Joog returned with Dejah Thoris and
Tars Tarkas. Their chains had been removed.</p>

<p>They were placed in the other two cages that hung over the pit
next to John Carter.</p>

<p>"Oh, John Carter, my chieftain!" cried Dejah Thoris, when she
saw him in the cage next to hers. "Thank Issus you are still
alive!" The little princess was crying softly.</p>

<p>John Carter reached through the bars and took her hand in his.
He tried to speak reassuring words to her but he knew, as did
Tars Tarkas, who sat grim faced in the other cage beside his,
that Pew Mogel had ordained their deaths&mdash;but in what
manner they would die, Carter, as yet, was uncertain.</p>

<p>"John Carter," spoke Tars Tarkas softly, "do you notice that
all those thousands of apes gathered here in the arena apparently
are paying no attention to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed," replied the earthman. "They are all looking
into the sky toward the city."</p>

<p>"Look," whispered Dejah Thoris. "It's the same thing on which
the ape rode when he captured me in the Helium Forest after
shooting our thoat!"</p>

<p>There appeared in the sky, coming from the direction of the
city, a great, lone bird upon whose back rode a single man.</p>

<p>The earthman's keen eyes squinted for an instant. "The bird is
a malagor. Pew Mogel is riding it."</p>

<p>The bird and its rider circled directly overhead.</p>

<p>"Open the east gate," Pew Mogel commanded, his voice ringing
out through a loudspeaker somewhere in the arena.</p>

<p>The gates were thrown open and there began pouring out into
the arena wave after wave of malagors exactly like the bird Pew
Mogel rode.</p>

<p>As the malagors came out, column after column of apes were
waiting at the entrance to vault onto the birds' backs. As each
bird was mounted, it rose into the air by telepathic command to
join a constantly growing formation circling high overhead.</p>

<p>The mounting of the birds must have taken nearly two hours, so
great were the numbers of Pew Mogel's apes and birds. Carter
noticed that upon each ape's back was strapped a rifle and each
bird carried a varying assortment of military equipment,
including ammunition supplies, small cannon and a submachine gun
was carried by each flight platoon.</p>

<p>At last all was ready and Pew Mogel descended down over the
cages of his three captives.</p>

<p>"You see now Pew Mogel's mighty army," he cried, "with which
he will conquer Helium and then all Barsoom." The man seemed very
confident, for his crooked, misshapen body sat very straight upon
his feathered mount.</p>

<p>"Before you are chewed to bits by the reptiles in the water
below you," he said "you will have a few moments to consider the
fate that awaits Helium within the next forty-eight hours. I
should have preferred to conquer peacefully but you interfered.
For that, you die, slowly and horribly."</p>

<p>Pew Mogel turned to the only ape that was left in the arena,
the keeper of the key to the cages.</p>

<p>"Open the flood-gate!" was his single command before he rose
up to lead his troops off toward the north.</p>

<p>Accompanying the weird, flying army in a sling carried by a
hundred malagors rode Joog, the synthetic giant. A hollow,
mirthless laugh peeled like thunder from the giant's throat as he
was born away into the sky.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_8" id="chap1_8">8. THE REPTILE PIT</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS the last bird in Pew Mogel's fantastic army
flapped out of sight behind the rim of the crater, John Carter
turned to Tars Tarkas in the cage hanging beside him. He spoke
softly so that Dejah Thoris would not hear.</p>

<p>"Those creatures will make Helium a formidable enemy," he
said. "Kantos Kan's splendid air-fleet and infantry will be hard
pressed against those thousands of apes equipped with human
brains and modern armament, mounted upon fast birds of prey!"</p>

<p>"Kantos Kan and his air-fleet are not even in Helium to
protect the city," announced Tars Tarkas grimly. "I heard Pew
Mogel bragging that he had sent Kantos Kan a false message,
supposedly from you, urging that all Helium's fleet, as well as
all the ships of the searching party, be dispatched to your aid
in the Great Toonolian Marshes."</p>

<p>"The Toonolian Marshes!" Carter gasped, "They're a thousand
miles from Helium in the other direction."</p>

<p>A little scream from Dejah Thoris brought the men's attention
to their own, immediate fate.</p>

<p>The ape beside the pit had pulled back a tall, metal lever.
There was a gurgle of bubbles as air blasted up from the water in
the pit below the three captives and the water at the same time
commenced to rise slowly.</p>

<p>The guard now unfastened the rope on each cage and lowered
them so that the cage tops were a little below the surface of the
ground inside the pit. Then he refastened the ropes and stood for
some time on the brink looking down on the helpless captives.</p>

<p>"The water rises slowly," he sneered thickly, "and so I shall
have time now for a little sleep."</p>

<p>It was uncanny to hear words issuing from the mouth of the
beast. They were barely articulate, for although the human brain
in the ape's skull directed the words, the muscles of the larynx
in the creature's throat were normally unequipped for the
specialized task of human speech.</p>

<p>The guard lay down on the brink and stretched his massive,
squat body.</p>

<p>"Your death cries will awaken me," he mumbled pleasantly,
"when the water begins to envelop your feet and the reptiles
start clawing at you through the bars of your cages." Whereupon,
the ape rolled over and began snoring.</p>

<p>It was then that the three captives saw the slanting, evil
eyes, the rows of flashing teeth, in a dozen hideous, reptilian
faces staring greedily up at them from the rising waters
below.</p>

<p>"Quite ingenious," remarked Tars Tarkas, his stoic face giving
no more evidence of fear than did that of the earthman. "When the
water partly submerges us, the reptiles will reach in with their
claws and begin tearing us to pieces&mdash;if there is any life
left in us, the rising water will drown it out when finally it
submerges the tops of our cages."</p>

<p>"How horrible!" gasped Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>John Carter's eyes were fastened on the brink of the pit. From
his cage he could just see one of the guard's feet as the fellow
lay asleep at the edge of the pit.</p>

<p>Cautioning the others to silence, Carter began swinging his
body back and forth while he held fast to the bars of the cage.
If he could just get it swinging&mdash;!</p>

<p>The water had risen to about ten feet below their cages.</p>

<p>It seemed an eternity before he could get the heavy cage to
even moving slightly. Nine feet to the water surface and those
hideous, staring eyes and those gleaming teeth!</p>

<p>The cage was swinging now a little more, in rhythm to the
earthman's constantly swaying body.</p>

<p>Eight feet, seven feet, six feet came the water. There were
about ten reptiles in the water below the captives&mdash;ten
pairs of narrow, evil eyes fixed steadily to their prey.</p>

<p>The cage was swinging faster.</p>

<p>Five feet, four feet, Tars Tarkas and Dejah Thoris could feel
the hot breath of the reptiles!</p>

<p>Three feet, two feet! Only two more feet to go before the
steadily swinging cage would cut into the water and slow down to
a standstill.</p>

<p>But the iron prison, swinging pendulum-like, would reach the
brink on its next swing so this time as the cage moved toward the
brink on which lay the sleeping guard, John Carter knew he must
act quickly.</p>

<p>As the bars of the cage smacked against the cement wall of the
pit, John Carter's arms shot out with the quickness of a striking
snake.</p>

<p>His fingers closed in a grip of steel about the ankle of the
sleeping guard.</p>

<p>An ear piercing shriek rang out across the arena, echoing
dismally in the hollow crater, as the ape felt himself jerked
suddenly from his slumbers.</p>

<p>Back swung the cage. Carter regrasped the shrieking ape with
his other hand through the bars as they swung out over the water.
The reptiles had to lower their heads as the cage moved over them
so close had the water risen.</p>

<p>"Good work, John Carter," came Tars Tarkas's tense words as he
reached out and grabbed hold of the ape with his four mighty
hands. At the same time, Carter's cage splashed to a sudden stop.
It had hit the water's surface.</p>

<p>"Hold him, Tars Tarkas. While I pull the key off the
scoundrel's neck&mdash;there, I've got it!"</p>

<p>The water was flowing over the bottom of the cages. One of the
reptiles had reached a horny arm in Dejah Thoris's cage and was
attempting to snag her body with its sharp, hooked claws.</p>

<p>Tars Tarkas flung the ape's body with all the force of his
giant thews straight at the reptile beside the girl's cage.</p>

<p>"Quickly, John Carter," cried Dejah Thoris. "Save yourself
while they are fighting over the ape's body."</p>

<p>"Yes," echoed Tars Tarkas, "unlock your cage and get out while
there is still time."</p>

<p>A half-smile lifted the corner of Carter's mouth as he swung
open his prison door and leaped to the top of Dejah Thoris's
cage.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner stay and die with you both," the earthman said,
"than desert you now."</p>

<p>Carter soon had the princess' prison door unlocked but as he
reached down to lift the girl up, a reptile darted forward into
the cage with the princess.</p>

<p>In a quick second, Carter was inside the girl's cage, already
knee-deep in water and he had hurled himself onto the back of the
reptile. A steely arm was clamped tightly around the creature's
neck. The head was jerked back just in time for the heavy jaws
snapped closed only an inch from the girl's body.</p>

<p>"Climb out, Dejah Thoris&mdash;to the top of the cage!"
ordered Carter. When the girl had obeyed, Carter dragged the
flopping, helpless reptile to the cage door, as other slimy
monsters started in. Using its body as a shield before him, the
earthman forced his way to the door.</p>

<p>In an instant he had released his hold and vaulted up on top
of the cage with the girl.</p>

<p>A moment later he had unlocked Tars Tarkas's cage door. After
the green man had swung up beside them without mishap, the three
climbed the ropes to the scaffolding above and then lowered
themselves down to the ground beside the pit.</p>

<p>"Thank Issus," breathed the girl as they sat down to regain
their breaths. Her beautiful head was cushioned upon Carter's
shoulder, and he stroked her lovely black hair reassuringly.</p>

<p>Presently the earthman rose to his feet. Tars Tarkas had
motioned him across the arena.</p>

<p>"There are some malagors left inside here," Tars Tarkas called
from the entrance to the cavern inside the crater from where had
come Pew Mogel's mounts.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Carter. "There may be a chance yet to reach
and help Helium."</p>

<p>A moment later they had caught two of the birds and had risen
over the ancient city of Korvas.</p>

<p>They spotted their planes on the outskirts of the city where
they had left them the night they were tricked into being
captured by Pew Mogel.</p>

<p>But to their disappointment, the controls had been destroyed
irreparably, so they were forced to continue their journey on the
backs of the malagors.</p>

<p>However, the malagors proved speedy mounts. By noon the next
day the trio had reached the City of Thark, inhabited by a
hundred thousand green warriors over whom Tars Tarkas ruled.</p>

<p>Gathering the warriors together in the marketplace, Tars
Tarkas and John Carter explained the peril that confronted Helium
and asked for their support in marching to their allies' aid.</p>

<p>As one man, the mighty warriors shouted their approval. The
next day dawned upon a long caravan of thoat-mounted soldiers
streaming out from the city gates towards Helium.</p>

<p>A messenger was sent on a malagor to the Toonolian Marshes in
an attempt to locate Kantos Kan and urge him to return home with
his fleet to aid in the defense of Helium.</p>

<p>Tars Tarkas had abandoned his malagor to this messenger, in
favor of a thoat upon which he rode at the head of his warriors.
Directly above him, mounted on the other malagor rode Dejah
Thoris and John Carter.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_9" id="chap1_9">9. ATTACK ON HELIUM</a></h2>

<p class="first">JOHN CARTER and Dejah Thoris, mounted upon their
malagor, were scouting far ahead of the main column of advancing
warriors when they first came in sight of the besieged City of
Helium.</p>

<p>It was bright moonlight. The princess voiced a little,
disappointed cry when she looked out across the spacious valley
towards Helium. Her grandfather's city was completely surrounded
by the besieging troops of Pew Mogel.</p>

<p>"My poor city!" The girl was crying softly, for in the bright
moonlight below could be easily discerned the terrific gap in the
ramparts and the many crushed and shattered buildings of the
beautiful metropolis.</p>

<p>John Carter telepathically commanded the malagor to land upon
a high peak in the mountains overlooking the Valley of
Helium.</p>

<p>"Listen," cautioned John Carter. Pew Mogel's light entrenched
cannon and small arms were commencing to open fire again by
moonlight. "They are getting ready for an air attack."</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind the two foothills between the valley and
the towering peaks, there rose the vast, flying army of Pew
Mogel.</p>

<p>"They are closing in from all sides," Dejah Thoris cried.</p>

<p>The great winged creatures and their formidable ape riders
were swooping down relentlessly upon the city. Only a few of
Helium's airships rose to give battle.</p>

<p>"Kantos Kan must have taken nearly all Helium's fleet with
him," the earthman remarked. "I am surprised Helium has withstood
the attack as long as this."</p>

<p>"You should know my people by now, John Carter," replied the
princess.</p>

<p>"The infantry and anti-aircraft fire entrenched in Helium are
doing well," Carter replied. "See those birds plummet to the
ground."</p>

<p>"They can't hold out much longer, though," the girl replied.
"Those apes are dropping bombs squarely into the city, as they
swoop over, wave after wave of them&mdash;oh, John Carter, what
can we do?"</p>

<p>John Carter's old fighting smile, usually present at times of
personal danger, had given way to a stern, grave expression.</p>

<p>He saw below him the oldest and most powerful city on Mars
being conquered by Pew Mogel's forces. Armed with Helium's vast
resources, the synthetic man would go forth and conquer all the
civilized nations on Mars.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand years of Martian learning and culture wrecked
by a power-mad maniac, himself the synthetic product of civilized
man!</p>

<p>"Is there nothing we can do to stop him, John Carter?" came
the girl's repeated question.</p>

<p>"Very little, I'm afraid, my princess," he replied sadly, "All
we can do is station Tars Tarkas's green warriors at an
advantageous point in preparation for the counterattack and trust
to fate that our messenger reached Kantos Kan in time that he may
return and aid us."</p>

<p>"Without supporting aircraft, our green warriors, heroic
fighters that they are, can do little against Pew Mogel's
superior numbers in the air."</p>

<p><br> When John Carter and Dejah Thoris returned to Tars
Tarkas, they reported what they had seen.</p>

<p>The great Thark agreed that his warriors could avail but
little in a direct attack against Pew Mogel's air force. It was
decided that half their troops be concentrated at one point and
at dawn attempt to rush into the City.</p>

<p>The remaining half of the warriors would scatter into the
mountains in smaller groups and engage the enemy in guerrilla
warfare.</p>

<p>Thus they hoped to forestall the fate of Helium until Kantos
Kan returned with his fleet of speedy air fighters.</p>

<p>"Helium's fleet of trim, metal fighting craft will furnish Pew
Mogel's feathered bird brigade a worthy enemy," remarked Tars
Tarkas.</p>

<p>"Provided, of course," added John Carter, "Kantos Kan's fleet
reaches Helium before Pew Mogel has entrenched himself in the
City and returned his own anti-aircraft guns upon them."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">All that night in the mountains, under cover of semi-darkness,
John Carter and Tars Tarkas reorganized and restationed their
troops. By dawn, all was ready.</p>

<p>John Carter and Tars Tarkas would lead the advance half of the
Tharks in a wild rush toward the gates of Helium, the other half
would remain behind, covering their comrades' assault with long
range rifles.</p>

<p>Much against the earthman's will, Dejah Thoris insisted she
would ride into the City beside him upon their malagor.</p>

<p>It was just commencing to grow brighter.</p>

<p>"Prepare to charge," John Carter ordered. Tars Tarkas passed
the word down and across by his orderly to his unit
commanders.</p>

<p>"Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!" echoed down and across
the battalions of magnificent, four-armed green fighters astride
their eight-legged, massive, restless thoats.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged by as the troop lines swung around. Steel
swords were drawn from scabbards. Hammers, on short deadly ray-
pistols, clicked back as they cocked over saddle pommels.</p>

<p>John Carter looked around at the girl sitting so straight and
steady behind him.</p>

<p>"You are very brave, my princess," he said.</p>

<p>"It's easy to be brave," she replied, "when I'm so close to
the greatest warrior on Mars."</p>

<p>"Charge!" came John Carter's terse, sudden order.</p>

<p>Down the mountain and across the plain toward Helium streaked
the savage horde of Tharks. Out ahead raced Tars Tarkas, his
sword held high.</p>

<p>Far ahead and above, on speedy wings, streaked the malagor
bearing John Carter and the Princess of Helium.</p>

<p>"John Carter, thank Issus!" Dejah Thoris cried in relief and
pointed toward the far mountain skyline.</p>

<p>"The Helium fleet has returned," shouted John Carter. "Our
messenger reached Kantos Kan in time!" Over the mountains, with
flying banners streaming, sailed the mighty Helium fleet.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence in the entrenched guns of the
enemy. They had seen the charging Tharks and the Helium fleet
simultaneously.</p>

<p>A great cry of triumph rose from the ranks of the charging
warriors at the sight of the Helium fleet streaking to their
aid.</p>

<p>"Listen," cried Dejah Thoris to Carter, "the bells of Helium
are tolling our victory song!" then it seemed as though all of
Pew Mogel's guns broke loose at once and from behind the
protecting hills rose his flying legions of winged malagors. Upon
their backs rode the white apes with men's brains.</p>

<p>Down upon the legions of Tharks came wave after wave of Pew
Mogel's feathered squadrons. In true blitzkrieg fashion, the
birds would swoop down just out of sword's reach over the green
warriors. As each bird pulled out of its dive, the ape on its
back would empty its death-dealing atom gun into the mass of
warriors beneath.</p>

<p>The carnage was terrific. Only after Tars Tarkas and John
Carter had led their warriors into the first lines of entrenched
apes did the Tharks find an enemy with whom they could fight
effectively.</p>

<p>Here, the four-armed green soldiers of Thark fought gloriously
against the great white apes of Pew Mogel's ghastly legions.</p>

<p>But never for a second did the horrible death-dealing
squadrons cease their attacks from above. Like angry hornets, the
thousands dove, killed, climbed again, always killing.</p>

<p>John Carter masterfully controlled his frightened bird while
he issued orders and directed attacks from his vantage point
immediately above the center of battle.</p>

<p>Bravely, efficiently, the Princess of Helium protected her
chieftain against countless side and rear attacks from the air.
The barrel of her radium pistol was red-hot with constant firing
and many were the charging birds and shrieking apes she sent
catapulting into the melee below.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hoarse shout rose again from Pew Mogel's legions on
ground and in the air.</p>

<p>"What is it, my chieftain?" cried the girl. "Why are the enemy
shouting in triumph?"</p>

<p>John Carter looked toward the advancing ships now over the
mountains only half a mile away, then his blood ran cold.</p>

<p>"The giant&mdash;Joog the giant!"</p>

<p>The creature had risen up from behind the shelter of a
low hill, as the ships approached above him. The giant grasped a
huge tree trunk in his mighty hand.</p>

<p>Even from where they were, John Carter could discern the head
of a man sitting in an armor-enclosed, steel howdah strapped to
the top of Joog's helmet.</p>

<p>From the giant's lips there suddenly issued a thunderous,
shrieking roar that echoed in the mountains and across the
plain.</p>

<p>Then he clambered swiftly to the top of a small hill. Before
the astonished Heliumites could swerve their speeding craft, the
giant struck out mightily with the great tree trunk.</p>

<p>The great, synthetic muscles of Pew Mogel's giant swung the
huge weapon full into the advancing craft.</p>

<p>The vanguard of twenty ships, the pride of Helium's air-fleet
met the blow head-on&mdash;went smashing and shattering against
the mountain-side, carrying their crews to swift, crushing
death!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_10" id="chap1_10">10. TWO THOUSAND
PARACHUTES</a></h2>

<p class="first">KANTOS KAN'S flagship narrowly escaped
annihilation at the first blow of the giant. The creature's club
only missed the leading ship by a few feet.</p>

<p>From their position on the malagor, John Carter and Dejah
Thoris could see many of the airships turning back toward the
mountains. Others, however, were not so fortunate.</p>

<p>Caught in the wild rush of air resulting from the giant's
swinging club, the craft pitched and tossed crazily out of
control.</p>

<p>Again and again the huge tree trunk split through the air as
the giant swung blow after blow at the helpless ships.</p>

<p>"Kantos Kan is re-forming his fleet," John Carter shouted
above the roar of battle as the fighting on the ground was once
more resumed with increased zeal.</p>

<p>"The ships are returning again," cried the princess, "toward
that awful creature!"</p>

<p>"They are spreading out in the air," the earthman replied.
"Kantos Kan is trying to surround the giant!"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Look, they are giving him some of Pew Mogel's own
medicine!"</p>

<p>Helium's vast fleet of airships was darting in from all sides.
Others came zooming down from above. As they approached within
range of their massive target, the gunners would pour out a
veritable hail of bullets and rays into the giant's body.</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris sighed in relief.</p>

<p>"He can't stand that much longer!" she said.</p>

<p>John Carter, however, shook his head sadly as the giant began
to strike down the planes with renewed fury.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's useless. Not only those bullets but the ray-
guns as well are having no effect upon the creature. His body has
been imbued with a serum that Ras Thavas discovered. The stuff
spreads throughout the tissue cells and makes them grow
immediately with unbelievable speed to replace all wounded or
destroyed flesh."</p>

<p>"You mean," Dejah Thoris asked, horror-stricken, "the awful
monster might never be destroyed?"</p>

<p>"It is probable that he will live and grow forever," replied
the earthman, "unless something drastic is done to destroy
him."</p>

<p>A sudden fire of determination flared in the earthman's steel
grey eyes.</p>

<p>"There may be a way yet to stop him, my princess, and save our
people&mdash;"</p>

<p>A weird, bold plan had formulated itself in John Carter's
mind. He was accustomed to acting quickly on sudden impulse. Now
he ordered his malagor down close over Tars Tarkas's head.</p>

<p>Although he knew the battle was hopeless, the green man was
fighting furiously on his great thoat.</p>

<p>"Call your men back to the mountains," shouted Carter to his
old friend. "Hide out there and reorganize&mdash;wait for my
return!"</p>

<p><br> The next half hour found John Carter and the girl beside
Kantos Kan's flagship. The great Helium Fleet had once more
retreated over the mountains to take stock of its losses and re-
form for a new attack.</p>

<p>Every ship's captain must have known the futility of further
battle against this indomitable element; yet they were all
willing to fight to the last for their nation and for their
princess, who had so recently been rescued.</p>

<p>After the earthman and the girl boarded the flagship, they
freed the great malagor that had so faithfully served them.
Kantos Kan joyously greeted the princess on bended knee and then
welcomed his old friend.</p>

<p>"To know you two are safe again is a pleasure that even
outweighs the great sadness of seeing our City of Helium fall
into the enemy's hands," stated Kantos Kan sincerely.</p>

<p>"We have not lost yet, Kantos Kan," said the earthman. "I have
a plan that might save us&mdash;I'll need ten of your largest
planes manned by only a minimum crew."</p>

<p>"I'll wire orders for them to break formation and assemble
beside the flagship immediately," replied Kantos Kan, turning to
an orderly.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," added Carter. "I'll want each plane equipped
with <i>two hundred parachutes</i>!"</p>

<p>"Two hundred parachutes?" echoed the orderly. "Yes, sir!"
Almost immediately there were ten large aircraft, empty troop
ships, drifting in single file formation beside Kantos Kan's
flagship. Each had a minimum crew of ten men and two hundred
parachutes, two thousand parachutes in all!</p>

<p>Just before he boarded the leading ship, John Carter spoke to
Kantos Kan.</p>

<p>"Keep your fleet intact," he said, "until I return. Stay near
Helium and protect the city as best you can. I'll be back by
dawn."</p>

<p>"But that monster," groaned Kantos Kan. "Look at him. We must
do something to save Helium."</p>

<p>The enormous creature, standing one hundred and thirty
feet tall, dressed in his ill-fitting, baggy tunic, was tossing
boulders and bombs into Helium, his every action dictated through
short wave by Pew Mogel, who sat in the armored howdah atop the
giant's head.</p>

<p>John Carter laid his hand on Kantos Kan's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't waste further ships and men uselessly in fighting the
creature," he warned "and trust me, my friend. Do as I
say&mdash;at least until dawn!"</p>

<p>John Carter took Dejah Thoris's hand in his and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my chieftain," she whispered, tears filling her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You'll be safer here with Kantos Kan, Dejah Thoris," spoke
the earthman; and then, "Goodbye, my princess," he called and
vaulted lightly over the craft's rail to the deck of the troop
ship alongside. It pained him to leave Dejah Thoris; yet he knew
she was in safe hands.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Dejah Thoris and Kantos Kan watched the ten
speedy craft disappear into the distant haze.</p>

<p>When John Carter had gone, Kantos Kan unfurled Dejah Thoris's
personal colors beside the nation's flag; so that all Helium
would know that their princess had been found safe and the people
be heartened by her close presence.</p>

<p>During his absence, Kantos Kan and Tars Tarkas followed the
earthman's orders, refraining from throwing away their forces in
hopeless battle. As a result, Pew Mogel's fighters had moved
closer and closer to Helium; while Pew Mogel himself was even now
preparing Joog to lead the final assault upon the fortressed
city.</p>

<p><br>
Exactly twenty-four hours later, John Carter's ten ships
returned.</p>

<p>As he approached Helium, the earthman took in the situation at
a glance. He had feared that he would be too late, for his secret
mission had occupied more precious time than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>But now he sighed with relief. There was still time to put
into execution his bold plan, the plan upon which rested the fate
of a nation.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_11" id="chap1_11">11. A DARING PLAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">FEARING that Pew Mogel might somehow intercept
any shortwave signal to Kantos Kan, John Carter sought out the
flagship and hove to alongside it.</p>

<p>The troop ships that had accompanied him on his secret mission
were strung out behind their leader.</p>

<p>Their captains awaited the next orders of this remarkable man
from another world. In the last twenty-four hours they had seen
John Carter accomplish a task that no Martian would have even
dreamed of attempting.</p>

<p>The next four hours would determine the success or failure of
a plan so fantastic that the earthman himself had half-smiled at
its contemplation.</p>

<p>Even his old friend, Kantos Kan, shook his head sadly when
John Carter explained his intentions a few minutes later in the
cabin of the flagship.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's no use, John Carter," he said. "Even though
your plan is most ingeniously conceived, it will avail naught
against that horrible monstrosity.</p>

<p>"Helium is doomed, and although we shall all fight until the
last to save her, it can do no good."</p>

<p>As he talked, Kantos Kan was looking down at Helium far below.
Joog the giant could be seen on the plain hurling great boulders
into the city.</p>

<p>Why Pew Mogel had not ordered the giant into the city itself
by this time, Carter could not understand&mdash;unless it was
because Pew Mogel actually enjoyed watching the destructive
effect of the boulders as they crashed into the buildings of
Helium.</p>

<p>Actually, Joog, however frightful in appearance, could best
serve his master's purpose by biding his time, for he was doing
more damage at present than he could possibly accomplish within
the city itself.</p>

<p>But it was only a matter of time before Pew Mogel would order
a general attack upon the city.</p>

<p>Then his entrenched forces would dash in, scaling the walls
and crashing the gates. Overhead would swoop the supporting apes
on their speedy mounts, bringing death and destruction from the
air.</p>

<p>And finally Joog would come, adding the final coup to Pew
Mogel's victory.</p>

<p>The horrible carnage that would then fall upon his people made
Kantos Kan shudder.</p>

<p>"There is no time to lose, Kantos Kan," spoke the earthman. "I
must have your assurance that you will see that my orders are
followed to the letter."</p>

<p>Kantos Kan looked at the earthman for some time before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"You have my word, John Carter," he said, "even though I know
it will mean your death, for no man, not even you, can accomplish
what you plan to do!"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the earthman. "I shall leave immediately; and
when you see the giant raise and lower his arm three times, that
will be your signal to carry out my orders!"</p>

<p>Just before he left the flagship, John Carter knocked at Dejah
Thoris's cabin door.</p>

<p>"Come," he heard her reply from within. As he threw open the
door, he saw Dejah Thoris seated at a table. She had just flicked
off the visiscreen upon which she had caught the vision of Kantos
Kan. The girl rose, tears filling her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do not leave again, John Carter," she pleaded. "Kantos Kan
has just told me of your rash plan&mdash;it cannot possibly
succeed, and you will only be sacrificing yourself uselessly.
Stay with me, my chieftain, and we shall die together!"</p>

<p>John Carter strode across the room and took his princess in
his arms&mdash;perhaps for the last time. She pillowed her head
on his broad chest and cried softly. He held her close for a
brief moment before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Upon Mars," he said, "I have found a free and kindly people
whose civilization I have learned to cherish. Their princess is
the woman I love.</p>

<p>"She and her people to whom she belongs are in grave danger.
While there is even a slight chance for me to save you and Helium
from the terrible catastrophe that threatens all Mars, I must
act."</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris straightened a little at his words and smiled
bravely as she looked up at him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, my chieftain," she whispered. "For a minute, my
love for you made me forget that I belong also to my people. If
there is any chance of saving them, I would be horribly selfish
to detain you; so go now and remember, if you die the heart of
Dejah Thoris dies with you!"</p>

<p>A moment later John Carter was seated behind the controls of
the fastest, one-man airship in the entire Helium Navy.</p>

<p>He waved farewell to the two forlorn figures who stood at the
rail of the flagship.</p>

<p>Then he opened wide the throttle of the quiet radium engine.
He could feel the little craft shudder for an instant as it
gained speed. The earthman pointed its nose upward and rose far
above the battleground.</p>

<p>Then he nosed over and dove down. The wind whistled shrilly
off the craft's trim lines as its increased momentum sped it,
comet-like, downward&mdash;straight toward the giant!</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap1_12" id="chap1_12">12. THE FATE OF A
NATION</a></h2>

<p class="first">NEITHER Pew Mogel nor the giant Joog had yet
seen the lone craft diving toward them from overhead. Pew Mogel,
seated inside the armored howdah that was attached to Joog's
enormous helmet, was issuing attack orders to his troops by
shortwave.</p>

<p>A strip of glass, about three feet wide, completely encircled
the howdah, enabling Pew Mogel to obtain complete, unrestricted
vision of his fighting forces below.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Pew Mogel had looked up through the circular glass
skylight in the dome of his steel shelter, he would have seen the
earthman's speedy little craft streaking down on him from
above.</p>

<p>John Carter was banking his life, that of the woman he loved
and the survival of Helium upon the hope that Pew Mogel would not
look up.</p>

<p>John Carter was driving his little craft with bullet
speed&mdash;straight toward that circular opening on top of Pew
Mogel's sanctuary.</p>

<p>Joog was standing still now, shoulders hunched forward. Pew
Mogel had ordered him to be quiet while he completed his last-
minute command to his troops.</p>

<p>The giant was on the plain between the mountains and the city.
Not until he was five hundred feet above the little round window
did Carter pull back on the throttle.</p>

<p>He had gained his great height to avoid discovery by Pew
Mogel. His speed was for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Now, if he were to come out alive himself, he must slow down
his hurtling craft. That impact must occur at exactly the right
speed.</p>

<p>If he made the crash too fast, he might succeed only in
killing himself, with no assurance that Pew Mogel had died with
him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the speed of his ship were too slow it
would never crash through the tough glass that covered the
opening. In that case, his crippled plane would bounce harmlessly
off the howdah and carry Carter to his death on the battlefield
below.</p>

<p>One hundred feet over the window!</p>

<p>He shut off the motor, a quick glance at the
speedometer&mdash;too fast for the impact!</p>

<p>His hands flew over the instrument panel. He jerked back on
three levers. Three little parachutes whipped out behind the
craft. There was a tug on the plane as its speed slowed down.</p>

<p>Then the ship's nose crashed against the little window!</p>

<p>There was a crunch of steel, a splinter of wood, as the
ship's nose collapsed; then a clatter of glass that ended in a
dull, trembling thud as the craft bore through the window and
lodged part way in the floor of Pew Mogel's compartment.</p>

<p>The tail of the craft was protruding out of the top of the
howdah, but the craft's door was inside the compartment.</p>

<p>John Carter sprang from his ship, his blade gleaming in his
hand.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel was still spinning around crazily in his revolving
chair from the tremendous impact. His earphones and attached
microphone, with which he had directed Joog's actions as well as
his troop formations, had been knocked off his head and lay on
the floor at his feet.</p>

<p>When his foolish spin finally stopped, Pew Mogel remained
seated. He stared incredulously at the earthman.</p>

<p>His small, lidless eyes bulged. He opened his crooked mouth
several times to speak. Now his twisted fingers worked
spasmodically.</p>

<p>"Draw your sword, Pew Mogel!" spoke the earthman so low that
Pew Mogel could hardly hear the words.</p>

<p>The synthetic man made no move to obey.</p>

<p>"You're dead!" he finally croaked. It was like the man was
trying to convince himself that what he saw confronting him with
naked sword was only an ill-begotten hallucination. So hard, in
fact, did Pew Mogel continue to stare that his left eye behaved
as Carter had seen it do once before in Korvas when the creature
was excited.</p>

<p>It popped out of its socket and hung down on his cheek.</p>

<p>"Quickly, Pew Mogel, draw your weapon&mdash;I have no time to
waste!"</p>

<p>Carter could feel the giant below him growing restless,
shifting uneasily on his enormous feet. Apparently he did not yet
suspect the change of masters in the howdah strapped to his
helmet; yet he had jumped perceptibly when Carter's craft had
torn into his master's sanctuary.</p>

<p>Carter reached down and picked up the microphone on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Raise your arm," he shouted into the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then the giant raised the right arm high
over his head.</p>

<p>"Lower arm," Carter commanded again. The giant obeyed.</p>

<p>Twice more, Carter gave the same command and the giant obeyed
each time. The earthman half smiled. He knew Kantos Kan had seen
the signal and would follow the orders he had given him
earlier.</p>

<p>Now Pew Mogel's hand suddenly shot down to his side. It
started back up with a radium gun.</p>

<p>There was a blinding flash as he pulled the trigger; then the
gun flew miraculously from his hand.</p>

<p>Carter had leaped to one side. His sword had crashed against
the weapon knocking it from Pew Mogel's grasp.</p>

<p>Now the man was forced to draw his sword.</p>

<p>There, on top of the giant's head, fighting furiously
with a synthetic man of Mars, John Carter found himself in one of
the weirdest predicaments of his adventurous life.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel was no mean swordsman. In fact, so furious was his
first attack that he had the earthman backing around the room
hard-pressed to parry the swift torrent of blows that were aimed
indiscriminately at every inch of his body from head to toe.</p>

<p>It was a ghastly sensation, fighting with a man whose eye hung
down the side of his face. Pew Mogel had forgotten that it had
popped out. The synthetic man could see equally well with either
eye.</p>

<p>Now Pew Mogel had worked the earthman over to the window. Just
for an instant he glanced out.</p>

<p>An exclamation of surprise escaped his lips.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_13" id="chap1_13">13. PANIC</a></h2>

<p class="first">JOHN CARTER'S eyes followed those of Pew Mogel.
What he saw made him smile, renewed hope surging over him.</p>

<p>"Look, Pew Mogel," he cried. "Your flying army is
disbanding!"</p>

<p>The thousands of malagors that had littered the sky with their
hairy riders were croaking hoarsely as they scattered in all
directions. The apes astride their backs were unable to control
their wild fright. The birds were pitching off their riders in
wholesale lots, as their great wings flapped furiously to escape
that which had suddenly appeared in the sky among them.</p>

<p>The cause of their wild flight was immediately apparent.</p>

<p>The air was filled with parachutes, and dangling from each
falling parachute was a three-legged Martian rat&mdash;every
Martian bird's hereditary foe!</p>

<p>In the quick glance that he took, Carter could see the
creatures tumbling out of the troop ship into which he had loaded
them during his absence of the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>His orders were being followed implicitly.</p>

<p>The rats would soon be landing among Pew Mogel's entrenched
troops.</p>

<p>Now, however, John Carter's attention returned to his own
immediate peril.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel swung viciously at the earthman. The blade nicked
his shoulder, the blood flowed down his bronzed arm.</p>

<p>Carter stole another glance down. Those rats would need
support when they landed in the trenches.</p>

<p>Good! Tars Tarkas's green warriors were again racing out of
the hills, unhindered now by scathing fire from an enemy
above.</p>

<p>True, the rats when they landed would attack anything in their
path; but the green Tharks were mounted on fleet thoats, the apes
had no mounts. No malagor would stay within sight of its most
hated enemy.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel was backing up now once more near the window. Out of
the corner of his eye, Carter caught sight of Kantos Kan's air
fleet zooming down towards Pew Mogel's ape legions far below.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel suddenly reached down with his free hand.</p>

<p>His fingers clutched the microphone that Cater had dropped
when Pew Mogel had first rushed at him.</p>

<p>Now the creature held it to his lips and before the earthman
could prevent it he shouted into it.</p>

<p>"Joog!" He cried, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p>

<p>The next second, John Carter's blade has severed Pew Mogel's
head from his shoulders.</p>

<p>The earthman dived for the microphone as it fell from the
creature's hands; but he was met by Pew Mogel's headless body as
it lunged blindly round the room still wielding its gleaming
weapons.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's head rolled about the floor, shrieking wildly as
Joog charged forward to obey his master's last command to
kill!</p>

<p>Joog's head jerked back and forth with each enormous stride.
John Carter was hurled roughly about the narrow compartment with
each step.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's headless body floundered across the floor still
striking out madly with the sword in it's hand.</p>

<p>"You can't kill me. You can't kill me," shrieked Pew Mogel's
head, as it bounced about "I am Ras Thavas's synthetic man. I
never die. I never die!"</p>

<p>The narrow entrance door to the howdah had flopped open as
some flying object hit against its bolt.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's body walked vacantly through the opening and went
hurtling down to the ground far below.</p>

<p>Pew Mogel's head saw and shrieked in dismay; then Carter
managed to grab it by the ear and hurl the head out after the
body.</p>

<p>He could hear the thing shrieking all the way down; then its
cries ceased suddenly.</p>

<p>Joog was now fighting furiously with the weapon he had just
uprooted.</p>

<p>"I kill! I kill!" he bellowed as he smacked the huge club
against the Helium planes as they drove down over the
trenches.</p>

<p>Although the howdah was rocking violently, Carter clung to the
window. He could see the rats landing now by the scores, hurling
themselves viciously at the apes in the trenches.</p>

<p>And Tars Tarkas's green warriors were there now, also. They
were fighting gloriously beside their great, four-armed
leader.</p>

<p>But Joog's mighty club was mowing down a hundred fighters at a
time as he swept it close above the ground.</p>

<p>Joog had to be stopped somehow!</p>

<p>John Carter dove for the microphone that was sliding around
the floor. He missed it, dove again. This time his fingers held
it.</p>

<p>"Joog&mdash;stop! Stop!" Carter shouted into the microphone.
Panting and growling, the great creature ceased his ruthless
slaughter. He stood hunched over, the sullen, glaring hatred
slowly dying away in his eyes, as the battle continued to rage at
his feet.</p>

<p>The apes were now completely disbanded. They broke over
the trenches and ran toward the mountains, pursued by the
vicious, snarling rats and the green warriors of Tars Tarkas.</p>

<p>John Carter could see Kantos Kan's flagship hovering near
Joog's head.</p>

<p>Fearing that Joog might aim an irritated blow at the craft
with its precious cargo, the earthman signalled the ship to
remain aloft.</p>

<p>Then his command once again rang into the microphone.</p>

<p>"Joog, lie down. Lie down!"</p>

<p>Like some tired beast of prey, Joog settled down on the ground
amid the bodies of those he had killed.</p>

<p>John Carter leaped out of the howdah onto the ground. He still
retained hold of the microphone that was tuned to the shortwave
receiving set in Joog's ear.</p>

<p>"Joog!" shouted Carter again. "Go to Korvas. Go to
Korvas."</p>

<p>The monster glared at the earthman, not ten feet from his
face, and snarled.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap1_14" id="chap1_14">14. ADVENTURE'S END</a></h2>

<p class="first">ONCE again the earthman repeated his command to
Joog the giant. Now the snarl faded from his lips and from the
brute's chest came a sound not unlike a sigh as he rose to his
feet once again.</p>

<p>Turning slowly, Joog ambled off across the plain toward
Korvas.</p>

<p>It was not until ten minutes later after the Heliumite
soldiers had stormed from their city and surrounded the earthman
and their princess that John Carter, holding Dejah Thoris tightly
in his arms, saw Joog's head disappear over the mountains in the
distance.</p>

<p>"Why did you let him go, John Carter?" asked Tars Tarkas, as
he wiped the blood from his blade on the hide of his sweating
thoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, why," repeated Kantos Kan, "when you had him in your
power?"</p>

<p>John Carter turned and surveyed the battlefield.</p>

<p>"All the death and destruction that has been caused here today
was due not to Joog but to Pew Mogel," replied John Carter.</p>

<p>"Joog is harmless, now that his evil master is dead. Why add
his death to all those others, even if we could have killed
him&mdash;which I doubt?"</p>

<p>Kantos Kan was watching the rats disappear into the far
mountains in pursuit of the great, lumbering apes.</p>

<p>"Tell me, John Carter," finally he said, a queer expression on
his face, "how did you manage to capture those vicious rats, load
them into those troop ships and even strap parachutes on
them?"</p>

<p>John Carter smiled. "It was really simple," he said. "I had
noticed in Korvas, when I was a prisoner in their underground
city, that there was only one means of entrance to the cavern in
which the rats live&mdash;a single tunnel that continued back for
some distance before it branched, although there were openings in
the ceiling far above; but they were out of reach.</p>

<p>"I led my men down into that tunnel and we built a huge smoke
fire with debris from the ground above. The natural draft carried
the smoke into the cavern.</p>

<p>"The place became so filled with smoke that the rats passed
out by the scores from lack of oxygen, for they couldn't get by
the fire in the tunnel&mdash;their only means of escape. Later,
we simply went in and dragged out as many as we needed to load
into our troop ships."</p>

<p>"But the parachutes!" exclaimed Kantos Kan. "How did you
manage to get those on their backs or keep them from tearing them
off when the creatures finally became conscious?"</p>

<p>"They did not regain consciousness until the last minute,"
replied the earthman. "We kept the inside cabin of each troop
ship filled with enough smoke to keep the rats unconscious all
the way to Helium. We had plenty of time to attach the parachutes
to their backs. The rats came to in midair after my men shoved
them out of the ships."</p>

<p>John Carter nodded toward the disappearing creatures in the
mountains. "They were very much alive and fighting mad when they
hit the ground, as you saw," added the earthman. "They simply
stepped out of their parachute harnesses when they landed, and
leaped for anyone in sight.</p>

<p>"As for the malagors," he concluded, "they are birds&mdash;and
birds on both earth and Mars have no love for snakes or rats. I
knew those malagors would prefer other surroundings when they saw
and smelled their natural enemies in the air around them!"</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris looked up at her chieftain and smiled.</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a man before?" she asked. "Could it be
that all earthman are like you?"</p>

<p><br> That night all Helium celebrated its victory. The streets
of the city surged with laughing people. The mighty, green
warriors of Thark mingled&mdash;in common brotherhood with the
fighting legions of Helium.</p>

<p>In the royal palace was staged a great feast in honor of John
Carter's service to Helium.</p>

<p>Old Tardos Mors, the jeddak, was so choked with feeling at the
miraculous delivery of his city from the hands of their enemy and
the safe return of his granddaughter that he was unable to speak
for some time when he arose at the dining table to offer the
kingdom's thanks to the earthman.</p>

<p>But when he finally spoke, his words were couched with the
simple dignity of a great ruler. The intense gratitude of these
people deeply touched the earthman's heart.</p>

<p>Later that night, John Carter and Dejah Thoris stood alone on
a balcony overlooking the royal gardens.</p>

<p>The moons of Mars circled majestically across the heavens,
causing the shadows of the distant mountains to roll and tumble
in an ever-changing fantasy over the plain and the forest.</p>

<p>Even the shadows of the two people on the royal balcony slowly
merged into one.</p> <hr> <br>

I also have to inject a little weather and scenery in my

that I especially deplore in the writings of others. Yet there is
something to be said in extenuation of weather and scenery,
which, together with adjectives, do much to lighten the burdens

<p class="first">I AM no scientist. I am a fighting man. My most

no reason to alter my theories as to its proper application to
the many problems with which I have been faced. This is not true
of the scientists. They are constantly abandoning one theory for
another one. The law of gravitation is about the only theory that
has held throughout my lifetime&mdash;and if the earth should
suddenly start rotating seventeen times faster than it now does,
even the law of gravitation would fail us and we would all go
sailing off into space.</p>

<p>Theories come and theories go&mdash;scientific theories. I
recall that there was once a theory that Time and Space moved
forward constantly in a straight line. There was also a theory
that neither Time nor Space existed&mdash;it was all in your
mind's eye. Then came the theory that Time and Space curved in
upon themselves. Tomorrow, some scientist may show us reams and
reams of paper and hundreds of square feet of blackboard covered
with equations, formulae, signs, symbols, and diagrams to prove
that Time and Space curve out away from themselves. Then our
theoretic universe will come tumbling about our ears, and we
shall have to start all over again from scratch.</p>

<p>Like many fighting men, I am inclined to be credulous
concerning matters outside my vocation; or at least I used to be.
I believed whatever the scientists said. Long ago, I believed
with Flammarion that Mars was habitable and inhabited; then a
newer and more reputable school of scientists convinced me that
it was neither. Without losing hope, I was yet forced to believe
them until I came to Mars to live. They still insist that Mars is
neither habitable or inhabited, but I live here. Fact and theory
seem to be opposed. Unquestionably, the scientists appear to be
correct in theory. Equally incontrovertible is it that I am
correct in fact.</p>

<p>In the adventure that I am about to narrate, fact and theory
will again cross swords. I hate to do this to my long-suffering
scientific friends; but if they would only consult me first
rather than dogmatically postulating theories which do not meet
with popular acclaim, they would save themselves much
embarrassment.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Dejah Thoris, my incomparable princess, and I
were sitting upon a carved ersite bench in one of the gardens of
our palace in Lesser Helium when an officer in the leather of
Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, approached and saluted.</p>

<p>"From Tardos Mors to John Carter, Kaor!" he said. "The jeddak
requests your immediate presence in the Hall of Jeddaks in the
imperial palace in Greater Helium."</p>

<p>"At once," I replied.</p>

<p>"May I fly you over, sir?" he asked. "I came in a two-
seater."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I replied. "I'll join you at the hangar in a
moment." He saluted and left us.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked Dejah Thoris. "I don't recall ever having
seen him before."</p>

<p>"Probably one of the new officers from Zor, whom Tardos Mors
has commissioned in the Jeddak's Guard. It was a gesture of his,
made to assure Zor that he has the utmost confidence in the
loyalty of that city and as a measure for healing old
wounds."</p>

<p>Zor, which lies about three hundred eighty miles southeast of
Helium, is one of the most recent conquests of Helium and had
given us a great deal of trouble in the past because of
treasonable acts instigated by a branch of its royal family led
by one Multis Par, a prince. About five years before the events I
am about to narrate occurred, this Multis Par had disappeared;
and since then Zor had given us no trouble. No one knew what had
become of the man, and it was supposed that he had either taken
the last, long voyage down the river Iss to the Lost Sea of Korus
in the Valley Dor or had been captured and murdered by members of
some horde of savage Green men. Nor did anyone appear to
care&mdash;just so he never returned to Zor, where he was
thoroughly hated for his arrogance and cruelty.</p>

<p>"I hope that my revered grandfather does not keep you long,"
said Dejah Thoris. "We are having a few guests for dinner
tonight, and I do not wish you to be late."</p>

<p>"A few!" I said. "How many? Two hundred or three hundred?"</p>

<p>"Don't be impossible," she said, laughing, "Really, only a
few."</p>

<p>"A thousand, if it pleases you, my dear," I assured her as I
kissed her. "And now, good-by! I'll doubtless be back within the
hour." That was a year ago!</p>

<p>As I ran up the ramp toward the hangar on the palace roof, I
had, for some then unaccountable reason, a sense of impending
ill; but I attributed it to the fact that my <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with my princess had been so quickly interrupted.</p>

<p>The thin air of dying Mars renders the transition from day to
night startlingly sudden to an earthman. Twilight is of short
duration owing to the negligible refraction of the sun's rays.
When I had left Dejah Thoris, the sun, though low, was still
shining; the garden was in shadow, but it was still daylight.
When I stepped from the head of the ramp to that part of the roof
of the palace where the hangar was located which housed the
private fliers of the family, dim twilight partially obscured my
vision. It would soon be dark. I wondered why the hangar guard
had not switched on the lights.</p>

<p>In the very instant that I realized that something was amiss,
a score of men surrounded and overpowered me before I could draw
and defend myself. A voice cautioned me to silence. It was the
voice of the man who had summoned me into this trap, When the
others spoke, it was in a language I had never heard before. They
spoke in dismal, hollow monotone, expressionless, sepulchral.</p>

<p>They had thrown me face down upon the pavement and trussed my
wrists behind my back. Then they jerked me roughly to my feet.
Now, for the first time, I obtained a fairly good sight of my
captors. I was appalled. I could not believe my own eyes. These
things were not men. They were human skeletons! Black eye sockets
looked out from grinning skulls. Bony, skeletal fingers grasped
my arms. It seemed to me that I could see every bone in each
body. Yet the things were alive! They moved. They spoke. They
dragged me toward a strange craft that I had not before noticed.
It lay in the shadow of the hangar, long, lean, sinister. It
looked like an enormous projectile, with rounded nose and
tapering tail.</p>

<p>In the first brief glance I had of it, I saw fins forward
below its median line, a long, longitudinal aileron (or so I
judged it to be) running almost the full length of the ship, and
strangely designed elevator and rudder as part of the empennage
assembly. I saw no propellers; but then I had little time for
close examination of the strange craft, as I was quickly hustled
through a doorway in its metal side. The interior was pitch dark.
I could see nothing other than the faint light of the dying day
visible through long, narrow portholes in the ship's side.</p>

<p>The man who had betrayed me followed me into the ship with my
captors. The door was closed and securely fastened; then the ship
rose silently into the night. No light showed upon it, within or
without. However, I was certain that one of our patrol ships must
see it; then, if nothing more, my people would have a clue upon
which to account for my disappearance; and before dawn a thousand
ships of the navy of Helium would be scouring the surface of
Barsoom and the air above it in search of me, nor could any ship
the size of this find hiding place wherein to elude them.</p>

<p>Once above the city, the lights of which I could see below us,
the craft shot away at appalling speed. Nothing upon Barsoom
could have hoped to overhaul it. It moved at great speed and in
utter silence. The cabin lights were switched on. I was disarmed
and my hands were freed. I looked with revulsion, almost with
horror, upon the twenty or thirty creatures which surrounded
me.</p>

<p>I saw now that they were not skeletons, though they still
closely resembled the naked bones of dead men. Parchment-like
skin was stretched tightly over the bony structure of the skull.
There seemed to be neither cartilage nor fat underlying it. What
I had thought were hollow eye sockets were deep set brown eyes
showing no whites. The skin of the face merged with what should
have been gums at the roots of the teeth, which were fully
exposed in both jaws, precisely as are the teeth of a naked
skull. The nose was but a gaping hole in the center of the face.
There were no external ears, only the orifices, nor was there any
hair upon any of the exposed parts of their bodies nor upon their
heads. The things were even more hideous than the hideous
kaldanes of Bantoom those horrifying spider men into whose toils
fell Tara of Helium during that adventure which led her to the
country of The Chessmen of Mars; they, at least, had beautiful
bodies, even though they were not their own.</p>

<p>The bodies of my captors harmonized perfectly with their
heads&mdash;parchment-like skin covered the bones of their limbs
so tightly that it was difficult to convince one's self that it
was not true bone that was exposed. And so tightly was this skin
drawn over their torsos that every rib and every vertebra stood
out in plain and disgusting relief. When they stood directly in
front of a bright light, I could see their internal organs.</p>

<p>They wore no clothing other than a G-string. Their harness was
quite similar to that which we Barsoomians wear, which is not at
all remarkable, since it was designed to serve the same purpose,
supporting a sword, a dagger, and a pocket pouch.</p>

<p>Disgusted, I turned away from them to look down upon the moon
bathed surface of my beloved Mars. But where was it! Close to
port was Cluros, the farther moon! I caught a glimpse of its
surface as we flashed by. Fourteen thousand five hundred miles in
a little more than a minute! It was incredible.</p>

<p>The red man who had engineered my capture came and sat down
beside me. His rather handsome face was sad. "I am sorry, John
Carter," he said. "Perhaps, if you will permit me to explain, you
will at least understand why I did it. I do not expect that you
will ever forgive me."</p>

<p>"Where is this ship taking me?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"To Sasoom," he said.</p>

<p>Sasoom! That is the Barsoomian name for Jupiter three hundred
and forty-two million miles from the palace where my Dejah Thoris
awaited me!</p><br> <br>

<h2 style="page-break-before: auto"><a name="chap2_2"
id="chap2_2">2. U DAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">FOR some time I sat in silence, gazing out in
the inky black void of space, a Stygian backdrop against which
stars and planets shone with intense brilliancy, steady and
untwinkling. To port or starboard, above, below, the heavens
stared at me with unblinking eyes&mdash;millions of white hot,
penetrating eyes. Many questions harassed my mind. Had I been
especially signalled out for capture? If so, why? How had this
large ship been able to enter Helium and settle upon my landing
stage in broad daylight? Who was this sad-faced, apologetic man
who had led me into such a trap? He could have nothing against me
personally. Never, before he had stepped into my garden, had I
seen him.</p>

<p>It was he who broke the silence. It was as though he had read
my thoughts. "You wonder why you are here, John Carter," he said.
"If you will bear with me, I shall tell you. In the first place,
let me introduce myself. I am U Dan, formerly a padwar in the
guard of Zu Tith, the Jed of Zor who was killed in battle when
Helium overthrew his tyrannical reign and annexed the city.</p>

<p>"My sympathies were all upon the side of Helium, and I saw a
brilliant and happy future for my beloved city once she was a
part of the great Heliumetic empire. I fought against Helium;
because it was my sworn duty to defend the jed I loathed&mdash;a
monster of tyranny and cruelty&mdash;but when the war was over, I
gladly swore allegiance to Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium.</p>

<p>"I had been raised in the palace of the jed in utmost intimacy
with the members of the royal family. I knew them all well,
especially Multis Par, the prince, who; in the natural course of
events, would have succeeded to the throne. He was of a kind with
his father, Zu Tith&mdash;arrogant, cruel, tyrannical by nature.
After the fall of Zor, he sought to foment discord and arouse the
people to revolt. When he failed, he disappeared. That was about
five years ago.</p>

<p>"Another member of the royal family whom I knew well was as
unlike Zu Tith and Multis Par as day is unlike night. Her name is
Vaja. She is a cousin of Multis Par. I loved her and she loved
me. We were to have been married, when, about two years after the
disappearance of Multis Par, Vaja mysteriously disappeared."</p>

<p>I did not understand why he was telling me all this. I was
certainly not interested in his love affairs. I was not
interested in him. I was still less interested, if possible, in
Multis Par; but I listened.</p>

<p>"I searched," he continued. "The governor of Zor gave me every
assistance within his power, but all to no avail. Then, one
night, Multis Par entered my quarters when I was alone. He wasted
no time. He came directly to the point.</p>

<p>"'I suppose,' he said, 'that you are wondering what has become
of Vaja.'</p>

<p>"I knew then that he had been instrumental in her abduction;
and I feared the worst, for I knew the type of man he was. I
whipped out my sword. 'Where is she?' I demanded. 'Tell me, if
you care to live.'</p>

<p>"He only laughed at me. 'Don't be a fool,' he said. 'If you
kill me you will never see her again. You will never even know
where she is. Work with me, and you may have her back. But you
will have to work fast, as I am becoming very fond of her. It is
odd," he added reminiscently, "that I could have lived for years
in the same palace with her and have been blind to her many
charms, both mental and physical&mdash;especially physical.'</p>

<p>"'Where is she?' I demanded. 'If you have harmed her, you
beast&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Don't call names, U Dan,' he said. 'If you annoy me too
greatly I may keep her for myself and enlist the services of some
one other than you to assist me with the plan I had come to
explain to you. I thought you would be more sensible. You used to
be a very sensible man; but then, of course, love plays strange
tricks upon one's mental processes. I am commencing to find that
out in my own case.' He gave a nasty little laugh. 'But don't
worry,' he continued. 'She is quite safe&mdash;so far. How much
longer she will be safe depends wholly upon you.'</p>

<p>"'Where is she?' I demanded.</p>

<p>"'Where you can never get her without my help,' he
replied.</p>

<p>"'If she is anywhere upon all Barsoom, I shall find her,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'She is not on Barsoom. She is on Sasoom.'</p>

<p>"'You lie, Multis Par,' I said.</p>

<p>"He shrugged, indifferently. 'Perhaps you will believe her,'
he said, and handed me a letter. It was indeed from Vaja. I
recall its message word for word:</p>

<p>"'Incredible as it may seem to you, I am a prisoner on Sasoom.
Multis Par has promised to bring you here to me if you will
perform what he calls a small favor for him. I do not know what
he is going to ask of you; but unless it can be honorably done,
do not do it. I am safe and unharmed.'"</p>

<p>"What is it you wish me to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to quote his exact words; but this, in
effect, is what he told me: Multis Par's disappearance from Zor
was caused by his capture by men from Sasoom. For some time they
had been coming to this planet, reconnoitering, having in mind
the eventual conquest of Barsoom.</p>

<p>I asked him for what reason, and he explained that it was
simply because they were a warlike race. Their every thought was
of war, as it had been for ages until the warlike spirit was as
compelling as the urge for self-preservation. They had conquered
all other peoples upon Sasoom and sought a new world to
conquer.</p>

<p>They had captured him to learn what they could of the
armaments and military effectiveness of various Barsoomian
nations, and had decided that as Helium was the most powerful, it
would be Helium upon which they would descend. Helium once
disposed of the rest of Barsoom would, they assumed, be easy to conquer.</p>

<p>"And where do I come in in this scheme of theirs?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that," said U Dan. "The Morgors are a
thorough-going and efficient people. They neglect no littlest
detail which might effect the success or failure of a campaign.
They already have excellent maps of Barsoom and considerable data
relative to the fleets and armament of the principal nations.
They now wish to check this data and obtain full information as
to the war technique of the Heliumites. This they expect to get
from you. This they will get from you."</p>

<p>I smiled. "Neither they nor you rate the honor and loyalty of
a Heliumite very highly."</p>

<p>A sad smile crossed his lips. "I know how you feel," he said.
"I felt the same way&mdash;until they captured Vaja and her life
became the price of my acquiescence. Only to save her did I agree
to act as a decoy to aid in your capture. The Morgors are adepts
in individual and mass psychology as well as in the art of
war."</p>

<p>"These things are Morgors?" I asked, nodding in the direction
of some of the repulsive creatures. U Dan nodded. "I can
appreciate the position in which you have been placed," I said,
"but the Morgors have no such hold on me."</p>

<p>"Wait," said U Dan.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Just wait. They will find a way. They are fiends. No one
could have convinced me before Multis Par came to me with his
proposition that I could have been forced to betray a man whom I,
with all decent men, admire as I have admired you, John Carter.
Perhaps I was wrong, but when I learned that Vaja would be
tortured and mutilated after Multis Par had had his way with her
and even then not be allowed to die but kept for future torture,
I weakened and gave in. I do not expect you to forgive, but I
hope that you will understand."</p>

<p>"I do understand," I said. "Perhaps, under like circumstances,
I should have done the same thing." I could see how terribly the
man's conscience tortured him. I could see that he was
essentially a man of honor. I could forgive him for the thing
that he had done for an innocent creature whom he loved, but
could he expect me to betray my country, betray my whole world,
to save a woman I had never seen. Still, I was bothered. Frankly,
I did not know what I should do when faced with the final
decision. "At least," I said, "should I ever be situated as you
were, I could appear to comply while secretly working to defeat
their ends."</p>

<p>"It was thus that I thought," he said. "It is still the final
shred by which I cling to my self-respect. Perhaps, before it is
too late, I may still be able to save both Vaja and
yourself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can work together to that end and to the salvation
of Helium," I said; "though I am really not greatly worried about
Helium. I think she can take care of herself."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Not if a part, even, of what Multis Par
has told me is true. They will come in thousands of these ships,
invisible to the inhabitants of Barsoom. Perhaps two million of
them will invade Helium and overrun her two principal cities
before a single inhabitant is aware that a single enemy threatens
their security. They will come with lethal weapons of which
Barsoomians know nothing and which they cannot, therefore,
combat."</p>

<p>"Invisible ships!" I exclaimed. "Why I saw this one plainly
after I was captured."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It was not invisible then, but it was
invisible when it came in broad daylight under the bows of your
patrol ships and landed in one of the most prominent places in
all Lesser Helium. It was not invisible when you first saw it;
because it had cast off its invisibility, or, rather, the Morgors
had cast it off so that they might find it again themselves, for
otherwise it would have been as invisible to them as to us."</p>

<p>"Do you know how they achieve this invisibility?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Multis Par has explained it to me," relied U Dan. "Let me
see; I am not much of a scientist, but I think that I recall more
or less correctly what he told me. It seems that on some of the
ocean beaches on Sasoom there is a submicroscopic, magnetic sand
composed of prismatic crystals. When the Morgors desire
invisibility for a ship, they magnetize the hull; and then from
countless tiny apertures in the hull, they coat the whole
exterior of the ship with these prismatic crystals. They simply
spray them out, and they settle in a cloud upon the hull, causing
light rays to bend around the ship. The instant that the hull is
demagnetized, these tiny particles, light as air, fall or are
blown off; and instantly the ship is visible again."</p>

<p>Here, a Morgor approached and interrupted our conversation.
His manner was arrogant and rude. I could not understand his
words, as he spoke his own language in the hollow, graveyard
tones I had previously noticed. U Dan replied in the same
language but in a less lugubrious tone of voice; then he turned
to me.</p>

<p>"Your education is to commence at once," he said, with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"During this voyage you are to learn the language of the
Morgors," he explained.</p>

<p>"How long is the voyage going to last?" I asked. "It takes
about three months to learn a language well enough to understand
and make yourself understood."</p>

<p>"The voyage will take about eighteen days, as we shall have to
make a detour of some million miles to avoid the Asteroids. They
happen to lie directly in our way."</p>

<p>"I am supposed to learn their Language in eighteen days?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"You are not only supposed to, but you will," replied U
Dan.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_3" id="chap2_3">3. THE MORGORS OF
SASOOM...</a></h2>

<p class="first">MY education commenced. It was inconceivably
brutal, but most effective. My instructors worked on me in
relays, scarcely giving me time to eat or sleep. U Dan assisted
as interpreter, which was immensely helpful to me, as was the
fact that I am exceedingly quick in picking up new languages.
Sometimes I was so overcome by lack of sleep that my brain lagged
and my responses were slow and inaccurate. Upon one such
occasion, the Morgor who was instructing me slapped my face. I
had put up with everything else; because I was so very anxious to
learn their language&mdash;a vital necessity if I were ever to
hope to cope with them and thwart their fantastic plan of
conquest. But I could not put up with that. I hit the fellow a
single blow that sent him entirely across the cabin, but I almost
broke my hand against his unpadded, bony jaw.</p>

<p>He did not get up. He lay where he had fallen. Several of his
fellows came for me with drawn swords. The situation looked bad,
as I was unarmed. U Dan was appalled. Fortunately for me, the
officer in command of the ship had been attracted by the
commotion and appeared at the scene of action in time to call his
men off. He demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>I had now mastered sufficient words of their language so that
I could understand almost everything that was said to me and make
myself understood by them, after a fashion. I told the fellow
that I had been starved and deprived of sleep and had not
complained, but that no man could strike me without suffering the
consequences.</p>

<p>"And no creature of a lower order may strike a Morgor without
suffering the consequences," he replied.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to do nothing about it," he replied. "My orders
require me to bring you alive to Eurobus. When I have done that
and reported your behavior, it will lie wholly within the
discretion of Bandolian as to what your punishment shall be;"
then he walked away, but food was brought me and I was allowed to
sleep; nor did another Morgor strike me during the remainder of
the voyage.</p>

<p>While I was eating, I asked U Dan what Eurobus was. "It is
their name for the planet Sasoom," he replied.</p>

<p>"And who is Bandolian?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he would be called a jeddak on Barsoom. I
judge this from the numerous references I have heard them make
concerning him. Anyhow, he seems to be an object of fear if not
veneration."</p>

<p>After a long sleep, I was much refreshed. Everything that I
had been taught was clear again in my mind, no longer dulled by
exhaustion. It was then that the commander took it upon himself
to examine me personally. I am quite sure that he did so for the
sole purpose of finding fault with me and perhaps punishing me.
He was extremely nasty and arrogant. His simplest questions were
at first couched in sarcastic language; but finally, evidently
disappointed, he left me. I was given no more instruction.</p>

<p>"You have done well," said U Dan. "You have, in a very short
time, mastered their language well enough to suit them."</p>

<p>This was the fifteenth day. During the last three days they
left me alone. Traveling through space is stupifyingly
monotonous. I had scarcely glanced from the portholes for days.
This was, however, principally because my time was constantly
devoted to instruction; but now, with nothing else to do, I
glanced out. A most gorgeous scene presented itself to my
astonished eyes. Gorgeous Jupiter loomed before me in all his
majestic immensity. Five of his planets were plainly visible in
the heavens. I could even see the tiny one closest to him, which
is only thirty miles in diameter. During the ensuing two days, I
saw, or at least I thought I saw, all of the remaining five
moons. And Jupiter grew larger and more imposing. We were
approaching him at the very considerable speed of twenty-three
miles per second, but were still some two million miles
distant.</p>

<p>Freed from the monotony of language lessons, my mind was once
more enslaved to my curiosity. How could life exist upon a planet
which one school of scientific thought claimed to have a surface
temperature of two hundred and sixty degrees below zero and which
another school was equally positive was still in a half molten
condition and so hot that gases rose as hot vapor into its thick,
warm atmosphere to fall as incessant rain? How could human life
exist in an atmosphere made up largely of ammonia and methane
gases? And what of the effect of the planet's terrific
gravitational pull? Would my legs be able to support my weight?
If I fell down, would I be able to rise again?</p>

<p>Another question which presented itself to my mind, related to
the motive power which had been carrying us through space at
terrific speeds for seventeen days. I asked U Dan if he knew.</p>

<p>"They utilize the Eighth Barsoomian Ray, what we know as the
ray of propulsion, in combination with the highly concentrated
gravitational forces of all celestial bodies within the range of
whose attraction the ship passes, and a concentration of Ray L
(cosmic rays) which are collected from space and discharged at
high velocities from propulsion tubes at the ship's stern. The
eighth Barsoomian Ray helps to give the ship initial velocity
upon leaving a planet and as a brake to its terrific speed when
approaching its landing upon another. Gravitational forces are
utilized both to accelerate speed and to guide the ship. The
secret of their success with these interplanetary ships lies in
the ingenious methods they have developed for concentrating these
various forces and directing their tremendous energies."</p>

<p>"Thanks, U Dan," I said, "I think I grasp the general idea. It
would certainly surprise some of my scientific friends on
earth."</p>

<p>My passing reference to scientists started me to thinking of
the vast accumulation of theories I was about to see shattered
when I landed on Jupiter within the next twenty-four hours. It
certainly must be habitable for a race quite similar to our own.
These people had lungs, a heart, kidneys, a liver, and other
internal organs similar to our own. I knew this for a fact, as I
could see them every time one of the Morgors stood between me and
a bright light, so thin and transparent was the parchment-like
skin that stretched tightly over their frames. Once more the
scientists would be wrong. I felt sorry for them. They have been
wrong so many times and had to eat humble pie. There were those
scientists, for instance, who clung to the Ptolemaic System of
the universe; and who, after Galileo had discovered four of the
moons of Jupiter in 1610, argued that such pretended discoveries
were absurd, their argument being that since we have seven
openings in the head&mdash;two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and
a mouth, there could be in the heavens but seven planets. Having
dismissed Galileo's absurd pretensions in this scientific manner,
they caused him to be thrown into jail.</p>

<p>When at a distance of about five hundred thousand miles from
Jupiter, the ship began to slow down very gradually in
preparation for a landing; and some three or four hours later we
entered the thick cloud envelope which surrounds the planet. We
were barely crawling along now at not more than six hundred miles
an hour.</p>

<p>I was all eagerness to see the surface of Jupiter; and
extremely impatient of the time that it took the ship to traverse
the envelope, in which we could see absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>At last we broke through, and what a sight was revealed to my
astonished eyes! A great world lay below me, illuminated by a
weird red light which seemed to emanate from the inner surface of
the cloud envelope, shedding a rosy glow over mountain, hill,
dale, plain, and ocean. At first I could in no way account for
this all-pervading illumination; but presently, my eyes roving
over the magnificent panorama lying below me, I saw in the
distance an enormous volcano, from which giant flames billowed
upward thousands of feet into the air. As I was to learn later,
the crater of this giant was a full hundred miles in diameter and
along the planet's equator there stretched a chain of these
Gargantuan torches for some thirty thousand miles, while others
were dotted over the entire surface of the globe, giving both,
light and heat to a world that would have been dark and cold
without them.</p>

<p>As we dropped lower, I saw what appeared to be cities, all
located at a respectful distance from these craters. In the air,
I saw several ships similar to that which had brought me from
Mars. Some were very small; others were much larger than the one
with which I had become so familiar. Two small ships approached
us, and we slowed down almost to a stop. They were evidently
patrol ships. From several ports guns were trained on us. One of
the ships lay at a little distance; the other came alongside. Our
commander raised a hatch in the upper surface of the ship above
the control room and stuck his head out. A door in the side of
the patrol ship opened, and an officer appeared. The two
exchanged a few words; then the commander of the patrol ship
saluted and closed the door in which he had appeared. We were
free to proceed. All this had taken place at an altitude of some
five thousand feet.</p>

<p>We now spiraled down slowly toward a large city. Later, I
learned that it covered an area of about four hundred square
miles. It was entirely walled, and the walls and buildings were
of a uniform dark brown color, as were the pavements of the
avenues. It was a dismal, repellent city built entirely of
volcanic rock. Within its boundaries I could see no sign of
vegetation&mdash;not a patch of sward, not a shrub, not a tree;
no color to relieve the monotony of somber brown.</p>

<p>The city was perfectly rectangular, having a long axis of
about twenty-five miles and a width of about sixteen. The avenues
were perfectly straight and equidistant, one from the other,
cutting the city into innumerable, identical square blocks. The
buildings were all perfect rectangles, though not all of either
the same size or height&mdash;the only break in the depressing
monotony of this gloomy city.</p>

<p>Well, not the only break: there were open spaces where there
were no buildings&mdash;perhaps plazas or parade grounds. But
these I did not notice until we had dropped quite low above the
city, as they were all paved with the same dark brown rock. The
city was quite as depressing in appearance as is Salt Lake City
from the air on an overcast February day. The only relief from
this insistent sense of gloom was the rosy light which pervaded
the scene, the reflection of the flames of the great volcanoes
from the inner surface of the cloud envelope; this and the
riotous growth of tropical verdure beyond the city's
walls&mdash;weird, unearthly growths of weird unearthly hues.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the two patrol ships, we now dropped gently
into a large open space near the center of the city, coming to
rest close to a row of hangars in which were many craft similar
to our own.</p>

<p>We were immediately surrounded by a detail of warriors; and,
much to my surprise, I saw a number of human beings much like
myself in appearance, except that their skins were purple. These
were unarmed and quite naked except for G strings, having no
harness such as is worn by the Morgors. As soon as we had
disembarked, these people ran the ship into the hangar. They were
slaves.</p>

<p>There were no interchanges of greetings between the returning
Morgors and those who had come out to meet the ship. The two
commanding officers saluted one another and exchanged a few
routine military brevities. The commander of our ship gave his
name, which was Haglion, the name of his ship, and stated that he
was returning from Mars&mdash;he called it Garobus. Then he
detailed ten of his own men to accompany him as guards for U Dan
and me. They surrounded us, and we walked from the landing field
in the wake of Haglion.</p>

<p>He led us along a broad avenue filled with pedestrian and
other traffic. On the sidewalks there were only Morgors. The
purple people walked in the gutters. Many Morgors were mounted on
enormous, repulsive looking creatures with an infinite number of
legs. They reminded me of huge centipedes, their bodies being
jointed similarly, each joint being about eighteen inches long.
Their heads were piscine and extremely ugly. Their jaws were
equipped with many long, sharp teeth. Like nearly all the land
animals of Jupiter, as I was to learn later, they were ungulate,
hoofs evidently being rendered necessary by the considerable
areas of hardened lava on the surface of the planet, as well as
by the bits of lava rock which permeate the soil.</p>

<p>These creatures were sometimes of great length, seating as
high as ten or twelve Morgors on their backs. There were other
beasts of burden on the avenue. They were of strange, unearthly
forms; but I shall not bore you by describing them here.</p>

<p>Above this traffic moved small fliers in both directions. Thus
the avenue accommodated a multitude of people, strange, dour
people who seldom spoke and, as far as I had seen, never laughed.
They might have, as indeed they looked, risen from sad graves to
rattle their bones in mock life in a cemetery city of the
dead.</p>

<p>U Dan and I walked in the gutter, a guard on the sidewalk
close beside each of us. We were not good enough to walk where
the Morgors walked! Haglion led us to a large plaza surrounded by
buildings of considerable size but of no beauty. A few of them
boasted towers&mdash;some squat some tall, all ugly. They looked
as though they had been built to endure throughout the ages.</p>

<p>We were conducted to one of these buildings, before the
entrance to which a single sentry stood. Haglion spoke to him,
and he summoned an officer from the interior of the building,
after which we all entered. Our names and a description of each
of us were entered in a large book. Haglion was given a receipt
for us, after which he and our original escort left.</p>

<p>Our new custodian issued instructions to several warriors who
were in the room, and they hustled U Dan and me down a spiral
stairway to a dim basement, where we were thrown into a gloomy
cell. Our escort locked the door on us and departed.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap2_4" id="chap2_4">4. ...AND THE
SAVATORS</a></h2>

<p class="first">ALTHOUGH I had often wondered about Jupiter, I
had never hoped nor cared to visit it because of the inhospitable
conditions which earthly scientists assure us pertain to this
great planet. However, here I was, and conditions were not at all
as the scientists had described. Unquestionably, the mass of
Jupiter is far greater than that of earth or Mars, yet I felt the
gravitational pull far less than I had upon earth. It was even
less than that which I had experienced upon Mars. This was due, I
realized, to the rapid revolution of the planet upon its axis.
Centrifugal force, tending to throw me off into space, more than
outweighed the increased force of gravitation. I had never before
felt so light upon my feet. I was intrigued by contemplation of
the height and distances to which I might jump.</p>

<p>The cell in which I found myself, while large, precluded any
experiments along that line. It was a large room of dark brown
lava rock. A few white lights set in recesses in the ceiling gave
meager illumination. From the center of one wall a little stream
of water tinkled into a small cavity in the floor, the overflow
being carried off by a gutter through a small hole in the end
wall of the cell. There were some grass mats on the floor. These
constituted the sole furnishings of the bleak prison.</p>

<p>"The Morgors are thoughtful hosts," I remarked to U Dan. "They
furnish water for drinking and bathing. They have installed
sewage facilities. They have given us whereon to lie or sit. Our
cell is lighted. It is strong. We are secure against the attacks
of our enemies. However, as far as the Morgors are concerned,
I..."</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" cautioned U Dan. "We are not alone." He nodded
toward the far end of the cell. I looked, and for the first time
perceived what appeared to be the figure of a man stretched upon
a mat.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, it arose and came toward us. It was, indeed, a
man. "You need have no fear of me," he said. "Say what you please
of the Morgors. You could not possibly conceive any terms of
opprobrium in which to describe them more virulent than those
which I have long used and considered inadequate."</p>

<p>Except that the man's skin was a light blue, I could not see
that he differed materially in physical appearance from U Dan and
myself. His body, which was almost naked, was quite hairless
except for a heavy growth on his head and for eyebrows and
eyelashes. He spoke the same language as the Morgors. U Dan and I
had been conversing in the universal language of Barsoom. I was
surprised that the man had been able to understand us. U Dan and
I were both silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested our cell mate, "you do not understand the
language of Eurobus&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"We do," I said, "but we were surprised that you understood
our language."</p>

<p>The fellow laughed. "I did not," he said. "You mentioned the
Morgors, so I knew that you were speaking of them; and then, when
your companion discovered me, he warned you to silence; so I
guessed that you were saying something uncomplimentary about our
captors. Tell me, who are you? You are no Morgors, nor do you
look like us Savators."</p>

<p>"We are from Barsoom," I said.</p>

<p>"The Morgors call it Garobus," explained U Dan.

<p>"I have heard of it," said the Savator. "It is a world that lies
far above the clouds. The Morgors are going to invade it. I suppose
they have captured you either to obtain information from you or to
hold you as hostages."</p>

<p>"For both purposes, I imagine," said U Dan. "Why are you
imprisoned?"</p>

<p>"I accidentally bumped into a Morgor who was crossing an
avenue at an intersection. He struck me and I knocked him down.
For that, I shall be destroyed at the graduation exercises of the
next class."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The education of the Morgor youth consists almost wholly of
subjects and exercises connected with the art of war. Because it
is spectacular, because it arouses the blood lust of the
participants and the spectators, personal combat winds up the
exercises upon graduation day. Those of the graduating class who
survive are inducted in the warrior caste&mdash;the highest caste
among the Morgors. Art, literature, and science, except as they
may pertain to war, are held in contempt by the Morgors. They
have been kept alive upon Eurobus only through the efforts of us
Savators; but, unfortunately, to the neglect of offensive
military preparation and training. Being a peace loving people,
we armed only for defense." He smiled ruefully and shrugged. "But
wars are not won by defensive methods."</p>

<p>"Tell us more about the graduating exercises," said U Dan.
"The idea is intriguing. With whom does the graduating class
contend?"</p>

<p>"With criminals and slaves," replied the Savator. "Mostly men
of my race," he added; "although sometimes there are Morgor
criminals of the worst types sentenced to die thus. It is
supposed to be the most shameful death that a Morgor can die,
fighting shoulder to shoulder with members of a lower order
against their own kind."</p>

<p>"Members of a lower order!" I exclaimed. "Do the Morgors
consider you that?"</p>

<p>"Just a step above the dumb beasts, but accountable for our
acts because we are supposed to be able to differentiate between
right and wrong&mdash;wrong being any word or act or facial
expression adversely critical of anything Morgorian or that can
be twisted into a subversive act or gesture."</p>

<p>"And suppose you survive the graduating contest," I asked.
"Are you then set at liberty?"</p>

<p>"In theory, yes," he replied; "but in practice, never."</p>

<p>"You mean they fail to honor terms of their own making?"
demanded U Dan.</p>

<p>The Savator laughed. "They are entirely without honor," he
said, "yet I do not know that they would not liberate one who
survived the combat; because, insofar as I know, no one ever has.
You see, the members of the class outnumber their antagonists two
to one."</p>

<p>This statement gave me a still lower estimate of the character
of the Morgors than I had already inferred from my own
observation of them. It is not unusual that a warlike people
excel in chivalry and a sense of honor; but where all other
characteristics are made subservient to brutality, finer
humanistic instincts atrophy and disappear.</p>

<p>We sat in silence for some time. It was broken by the Savator.
"I do not know your names," he said. "Mine is Zan Dar."</p>

<p>As I told him ours, a detail of Morgor warriors came to our
cell and ordered U Dan and me to accompany them. "Good-by!" said
Zan Dar. "We probably shall never meet again."</p>

<p>"Shut up, thing!" admonished one of the warriors.</p>

<p>Zan Dar winked at me and laughed. The Morgor was furious.
"Silence, creature!" he growled. I thought for a moment that he
was going to fall upon Zan Dar with his sword, but he who was in
charge of the detail ordered him out of the cell. The incident
was but another proof of the egomaniac arrogance of the Morgors.
However, it helped to crystallize within me an admiration and
liking for the Savator that had been growing since first he spoke
to us.</p>

<p>U Dan and I were led across the plaza to a very large building
the entrance to which was heavily guarded. The hideous, grinning,
skull-like heads of the warriors and their skeletal limbs and
bodies, together with the dark and cavernous entrance to the
building suggested a grisly fantasia of hell's entrance guarded
by the rotting dead. It was not a pleasant thought.</p>

<p>We were held here for quite some time, during which some of
the warriors discussed us as one might discuss a couple of stray
alley cats. "They are like the Savators and yet unlike them,"
said one.</p>

<p>"They are quite as hideous," said another.</p>

<p>"One of them is much darker than the other."</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, I was struck by the color of these
Morgors. Instead of being ivory color, they were a pink or rosy
shade. I looked at U Dan. He was a very dark red. A glance at my
arms and hands showed that they, too, were dark red; but not as
dark a red as U Dan. At first I was puzzled; then I realized that
the reflection of the red glare of the volcanoes from the inner
surface of the cloud envelope turned our reddish skins a darker
red and made the yellow, parchment-like skins of the Morgors
appear pink. As I looked around, I realized that this same
reddish hue appeared upon everything within sight. It reminded me
of a verse in the popular song I heard some time ago on one of my
visits to earth. It went, I think: "I am looking at the world
through rose colored glasses, and everything is rosy now." Well,
everything wasn't rosy with me, no matter how rosy this world
looked.</p>

<p>Presently an officer came to the entrance and ordered our
escort to bring us in. The interior of the building was as
unlovely as its exterior. Although this was, as I later learned,
the principal palace of the Morgor ruler, there was absolutely no
sign of ornamentation. No art relieved the austerity of gloomy,
lava-brown corridors and bare, rectangular chambers. No hangings
softened the sharp edges of openings; no rugs hid even a part of
the bare, brown floors. The pictureless walls frowned down upon
us. I have seldom been in a more depressing environment. Even the
pits beneath the deserted cities of Barsoom often had interesting
vaulted ceilings, arched doorways, elaborate old iron grill work,
attesting the artistic temperaments of their designers. The
Morgors, like death, were without art.</p>

<p>We were led to a large, bare chamber, in which a number of
Morgors were clustered about a desk at which another of the
creatures was seated. All Morgors look very much alike to me, yet
they do have individual facial and physical characteristics; so I
was able to recognize Haglion among those standing about the
desk. It was Haglion who had commanded the ship that had brought
me from Mars.</p>

<p>U Dan and I were halted at some distance from the group, and
as we stood there two other red Martians were brought into the
room, a man and a girl. The girl was very beautiful.</p>

<p>"Vaja!" exclaimed U Dan, but I did not need this evidence to
know who she was. I was equally certain that the man was Multis
Par, Prince of Zor. He appeared nervous and downcast, but even so
the natural arrogance of the man was indelibly stamped upon his
features.</p>

<p>At U Dan's exclamation, one of those guarding us whispered,
"Silence, thing!" Vaja's eyes went wide in incredulity as she
recognized my companion; and she took an impulsive step toward
him, but a warrior seized her arm and restrained her. The faint
shadow of a malicious smile touched the thin lips of Multis
Par.</p>

<p>The man seated at the desk issued an order, and all four of us
were brought forward and lined up in front of him. The fellow
differed in appearance not at all from other Morgors. He were no
ornaments. His harness and weapons were quite plain but evidently
serviceable. They were marked with a hieroglyph that differed
from similar markings on the harness and weapons of the other
Morgors, as those of each of the others differed from all the
rest. I did not know then what they signified; but later learned
that each hieroglyph indicated the name, rank, and title of him
who wore it. The hieroglyph of the man at the desk was that of
Bandolian, Emperor of the Morgors.</p>

<p>Spread upon the desk before Bandolian was a large map, which I
instantly recognized as that of Barsoom. The man and his staff
had evidently been studying it. As U Dan and I were halted before
his desk with Vaja and Multis Par, Bandolian looked up at the
Prince of Zor.</p>

<p>"Which is he," he asked, "who is called Warlord of Barsoom?"
Multis Par indicated me, and Bandolian turned his hollow eyes
upon me. It was as though Death had looked upon me and singled me
out as his own. "I understand that your name is John Carter," he
said. I nodded in affirmation. "While you are of a lower order,"
he continued, "yet it must be that you are endowed with
intelligence of a sort. It is to this intelligence that I address
my commands. I intend to invade and conquer Barsoom (he called it
Garobus), and I command you to give me all the assistance in your
power by acquainting me and my staff with such military
information as you may possess relative to the principal powers
of Garobus, especially that one known as the Empire of Helium. In
return for this your life will be spared."</p>

<p>I looked at him for a moment, and then I laughed in his face.
The faintest suggestion of a flush overspread the pallor of his
face. "You dare laugh at me, thing!" he growled.</p>

<p>"It is my answer to your proposition," I said.</p>

<p>Bandolian was furious. "Take it away and destroy it!" he
ordered.</p>

<p>"Wait, Great Bandolian!" urged Multis Par. "His knowledge is
almost indispensable to you, and I have a plan whereby you may
make use of it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Bandolian.</p>

<p>"He has a mate whom he worships. Seize her and he will pay any
price to protect her from harm."</p>

<p>"Not the price the Morgor has asked," I said to Multis Par,
"and if she is brought here it will be the seal upon your death
warrant."</p>

<p>"Enough of this," snapped Bandolian. "Take them all away."</p>

<p>"Shall I destroy the one called John Carter?" asked the
officer who commanded the detail that had brought us to the
audience chamber.</p>

<p>"Not immediately," replied Bandolian.</p>

<p>"He struck a Morgor," said Haglion; "one of my officers."</p>

<p>"He shall die for that, too," said Bandolian.</p>

<p>"That will be twice," I said.</p>

<p>"Take it away!" snapped Bandolian.</p>

<p>As we were led away, Vaja and U Dan gazed longingly at one
another.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_5" id="chap2_5">5. I WOULD BE A
TRAITOR</a></h2>

<p class="first">ZAN DAR, the Savator, was surprised to see us
returned to the cell in so short a time. "In fact," he said, "I
did not expect ever to see you again. How did it happen?"</p>

<p>I explained briefly what had occurred in the audience chamber,
adding, "I have been returned to the cell to await death."</p>

<p>"And you, U Dan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know why they bothered to take me up there," replied
U Dan. "Bandolian paid no attention to me whatever."</p>

<p>"He had a reason, you may rest assured. He is probably trying
to break down your morale by letting you see the girl you love,
in the belief that you will influence John Carter to accede to
his demands. John Carter lives only because Bandolian hopes to
eventually break down his resistance."</p>

<p>Time dragged heavily in that cell beneath the Morgor city. For
that matter, there would have been none had we been above ground,
for there are no nights upon Jupiter. It is always day. The sun,
four hundred eighty-three million miles away, would shed but
little light upon the planet even were it exposed to the full
light of the star that is the center of our solar system; but
that little light is obscured by the dense cloud envelope which
surrounds this distant world. What little filters through is
negated by the gigantic volcanic torches which bathe the entire
planet in perpetual daylight. Although Jupiter rotates upon its
axis in less than ten hours, its day is for eternity.</p>

<p>U Dan and I learned much concerning conditions on the planet
from Zan Dar. He told us of the vast warm seas which seethed in
constant tidal agitation resulting from the constantly changing
positions of the four larger moons which revolve about Jupiter in
forty-two hours, eighty-five hours, one hundred seventy-two
hours, and four hundred hours respectively while the planet spins
upon its axis, making a complete revolution in nine hours and
fifty-five minutes. He told us of vast continents and enormous
islands; and I could well imagine that such existed, as a rough
estimate indicated that the area of the planet exceeded twenty-
three billion square miles.</p>

<p>As the axis of Jupiter is nearly perpendicular to the plane of
its motion, having an inclination of only about 30, there could
be no great variety of seasons; so over this enormous area there
existed an equable climate, warm and humid, perpetually lighted
and heated by the innumerable volcanoes which pit the surface of
the planet. And here was I, an adventurer who had explored two
worlds, cooped up in a subterranean cell upon the most amazing
and wonderful planet of our entire solar system. It was
maddening.</p>

<p>Zan Dar told us that the continent upon which we were was the
largest. It was the ancestral home of the Morgors, from which
they had, over a great period of time, sallied forth to conquer
the remainder of the world. The conquered countries, each of
which was ruled by what might be called a Morgor Governor-
General, paid tribute to the Morgors in manufactured goods,
foodstuffs, and slaves. There were still a few areas, small and
considered of little value by the Morgors, which retained their
liberty and their own governments. From such an area came Zan
Dar&mdash;a remote island called Zanor.</p>

<p>"It is a land of tremendous mountains, thickly forested with
trees of great size and height," he said. "Because of our
mountains and our forests, it is an easy land to defend against
an airborne enemy."</p>

<p>When he told me the height of some of the lofty peaks of
Zanor, it was with difficulty that I could believe him: to a
height of twenty miles above sea level rose the majestic king of
Zanor's mountains.</p>

<p>"The Morgors have sent many an expedition against us," said
Zan Dar. "They get a foothold in some little valley; and there,
above them and surrounding them in mountain fastnesses that are
familiar to us and unknown to them, we have had them at our
mercy, picking them off literally one by one until they are so
reduced in numbers that they dare remain no longer. They kill
many of us, too; and they take prisoners. I was taken thus in one
of their invasions. If they brought enough ships and enough men,
I suppose they could conquer us; but our land is scarcely worth
the effort, and I think they prefer to leave us as we are to give
their recruits practice in actual warfare."</p>

<p>I don't know how long we had been confined when Multis Par was
brought to our cell by an officer and a detachment of warriors.
He came to exhort me to cooperate with Bandolian.</p>

<p>"The invasion and conquest of Barsoom are inevitable," he
said. "By assisting Bandolian you can mitigate the horror of it
for the inhabitants of Barsoom. You will thus be serving our
world far better than by stupidly and stubbornly refusing to meet
Bandolian half way."</p>

<p>"You are wasting your time," I told him.</p>

<p>"But our own lives depend upon it," he cried. "You and U Dan,
Vaja, and I shall die if you refuse. Bandolian's patience is
almost worn out now." He looked pleadingly at U Dan.</p>

<p>"We could not die in a better cause," said U Dan, much to my
surprise. "I shall be glad to die in atonement for the wrong that
I did John Carter."</p>

<p>"You are two fools!" exclaimed Multis Par, angrily.</p>

<p>"At least we are not traitors," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"You will die, John Carter," he growled; "but before you die,
you shall see your mate in the clutches of Bandolian. She has
been sent for. Now, if you change your mind, send word by one of
those who bring your meals."</p>

<p>I sprang forward and knocked the creature down. I should have
killed him then had not the Morgors dragged him from the
cell.</p>

<p>So they had sent for Dejah Thoris&mdash;and I was helpless.
They would get her. I knew how they would get her, by assuring
her that only through her cooperation could my immediate death be
averted. I wondered if they would win. Would I, in the final
test, sacrifice my beloved princess or my adopted country?
Frankly, I did not know; but I had the example of U Dan to guide
me. He had placed patriotism above love. Would I?</p>

<p>Time dragged on in this gloomy cell where there was no time.
We three plotted innumerable futile plans of escape. We
improvised games to help mitigate the monotony of our dull
existence. More profitably, however, U Dan and I learned much
from Zan Dar concerning this great planet. And Zan Dar learned
much of what lay beyond the eternal cloud envelope which hides
from the view of the inhabitants of Jupiter the sun, the other
planets, the stars, and even their own moons. All that Zan Dar
knew of them was the little he had been able to glean from
remarks dropped by Morgors of what had been seen from their
interplanetary ships. Their knowledge of astronomy was only
slightly less than their interest in the subject, which was
practically non-existent. War, conquest, and bloodshed were their
sole interests in life.</p>

<p>At last there came a break in the deadly monotony of our
lives: a new prisoner was thrown into the cell with us. And he
was a Morgor! The situation was embarrassing. Had our numbers
been reversed, had there been three Morgors and one of us, there
would have been no doubt as to the treatment that one would have
received. He would have been ostracized, imposed upon, and very
possibly abused. The Morgor expected this fate. He went into a
far corner of the cell and awaited what he had every reason to
expect. U Dan, Zan Dar, and I discussed the situation in
whispers. That must have been a trying time for the Morgor. We
three finally decided to treat the creature simply as a fellow
prisoner until such time as his own conduct should be our
eventual guide. Zan Dar was the first to break the ice. In a
friendly manner he asked what mischance had brought the fellow to
this pass.</p>

<p>"I killed one who had an influential relative in the palace of
Bandolian," he replied, and as he spoke he came over closer to
us. "For that I shall die, probably in the graduating exercises
of the next class. We shall doubtless all die together," he added
with a hollow laugh. He paused. "Unless we escape," he
concluded.</p>

<p>"Then we shall die," said Zan Dar.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Morgor.</p>

<p>"One does not escape from the prisons of the Morgors," said
Zan Dar.</p>

<p>I was interested in that one word "perhaps". It seemed to me
fraught with intentional weaning. I determined to cultivate this
animated skeleton. It could do no harm and might lead to good. I
told him my name and the names of my companions; then I asked
his.</p>

<p>"Vorion," he replied; "but I need no introduction to you, John
Carter. We have met before. Don't you recognize me?" I had to
admit that I did not. Vorion laughed. "I slapped your face and
you knocked me across the ship. It was a noble blow. For a long
time they thought that I was dead."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "you were one of my instructors. It may please
you to know that I am going to die for that blow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Vorion. There was that "perhaps" again.
What did the fellow mean?</p>

<p>Much to our surprise, Vorion proved not at all a bad
companion. Toward Bandolian and the powerful forces that had
condemned him to death and thrown him into prison he was
extremely bitter. I learned from him that the apparent veneration
and loyalty accorded Bandolian by his people was wholly a matter
of disciplined regimentation. At heart, Vorion loathed the man as
a monster of cruelty and tyranny. "Fear and generations of
training hold our apparent loyalty," he said.</p>

<p>After he had been with us for some time, he said to me, "You
three have been very decent to me. You could have made my life
miserable here; and I could not have blamed you had you done so,
for you must hate us Morgors."</p>

<p>"We are all in the same boat," I said. "We could gain nothing
by fighting among ourselves. If we work together, perhaps..." I
used his own perhaps.</p>

<p>Vorion nodded. "I have been thinking that we might work
together," he said.</p>

<p>"To what end?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Escape."</p>

<p>"Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>U Dan and Zan Dar were eager listeners. Vorion turned to the
latter. "If we should escape," he said, "you three have a country
to which you might go with every assurance of finding asylum,
while I could expect only death in any country upon the face of
Eurobus. If you could promise me safety in your country&mdash;:" He
paused, evidently awaiting Zan Dar's reaction.</p>

<p>"I could only promise to do my best for you," said Zan Dar;
"but I am confident that if you were the means of my liberation
and return to Zanor, you would be permitted to remain there in
safety."</p>

<p>Our plotting was interrupted by the arrival of the detail of
warriors. The officer in command singled me out and ordered me
from the cell. If I were to be separated from my companions, I
saw, the fabric of my dream of escape dissolve before my
eyes.</p>

<p>They led me from the building and across the plaza to the
palace of Bandolian, and after some delay I found myself again in
the audience chamber. From behind his desk, the hollow eyes of
the tyrant stared at me from their grinning skull. "I am giving
you your last chance," said Bandolian; then he turned to one of
his officers. "Bring in the other," he said. There was a short
wait, and then a door at my right opened and a guard of warriors
brought in the "other". It was Dejah Thoris! My incomparable
Dejah Thoris!</p>

<p>What a lovely creature she was as she crossed the floor
surrounded by hideous Morgors. What majestic dignity, what
fearlessness distinguished her carriage and her mien! That such
as she should be sacrificed even for a world! They halted her
scarce two paces from me. She gave me a brave smile, and
whispered, "Courage! I know now why I am here. Do not weaken.
Better death than dishonor."</p>

<p>"What is she saying?" demanded Bandolian.</p>

<p>I thought quickly. I knew that the chances were that not one
of them there understood the language of Barsoom. In their stupid
arrogance they would not deign to master the tongue of a lower
order.</p>

<p>"She but pleads with me to save her," I said. I saw Dejah
Thoris smile. Evidently they had taught her the language of the
Morgors on the long voyage from Mars.</p>

<p>"And you will be wise to do so," said Bandolian, "otherwise
she will be given to Multis Par and afterward tortured and
mutilated many times before she is permitted to die."</p>

<p>I shuddered in contemplation of such a fate for my princess,
and in that moment I weakened once again. "If I aid you, will she
be returned unharmed to Helium?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Both of you will&mdash;after I have conquered Garobus,"
replied Bandolian.</p>

<p>"No! No!" whispered Dejah Thoris. "I should rather die than
return to Helium with a traitor. No, John Carter, you could never
be that even to save my life."</p>

<p>"But the torture! The mutilation! I would be a traitor a
thousand times over to save you from that, and I can promise you
that no odium would be attached to you: I should never return to
Barsoom."</p>

<p>"I shall be neither tortured nor mutilated," she said. "Sewn
into my harness is a long, thin blade."</p>

<p>I understood and I was relieved. "Very well," I said. "If we
are to die for Barsoom, it is not more than thousands of her
brave warriors have done in the past; but we are not dead yet.
Remember that, my princess; and do not use that long, thin blade
upon yourself until hope is absolutely dead."</p>

<p>"While you live, hope will live," she said.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Bandolian. "I have listened long enough to
your silly jabbering. Do you accept my proposition?"</p>

<p>"I am considering it," I said, "but I must have a few more
words with my mate."</p>

<p>"Let them be few," snapped the Morgor.</p>

<p>I turned to Dejah Thoris. "Where are you imprisoned?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"On the top floor of a tower at the rear of this building at
the corner nearest the great volcano. There is another Barsoomian
with me, a girl from Zor. Her name is Vaja."</p>

<p>Bandolian was becoming impatient. He drummed nervously on his
desk with his knuckles and snapped his grinning jaws together
like castanets. "Enough of this!" he growled. "What is your
decision?"</p>

<p>"The matter is one of vast importance to me," I replied. "I
cannot decide it in a moment. Return me to my cell so that I may
think it over and discuss it with U Dan, who also has much at
stake."</p>

<p>"Take it back to its cell," ordered Bandolian; and then, to
me: "You shall have time, but not much. My patience is
exhausted."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_6" id="chap2_6">6. ESCAPE</a></h2>

<p class="first">I HAD no plan. I was practically without hope,
yet I had gained at least a brief reprieve for Dejah Thoris.
Perhaps a means of escape might offer itself. Upon such
unsubstantial fare I fed the shred of hope to which I clung.</p>

<p>My cell mates were both surprised and relieved when I was
returned to them. I told them briefly of what had occurred in the
audience chamber of Bandolian. U Dan showed real grief when he
learned that Dejah Thoris was in the clutches of the Morgors, and
cursed himself for the part he had taken in bringing her and me
to a situation in which we faced the alternatives of death or
dishonor.</p>

<p>"Vain regrets never got anyone anywhere," I said. "They won't
get us out of this cell. They won't get Dejah Thoris and Vaja out
of Bandolian's tower. Forget them. We have other things to think
about." I turned to Vorion. "You have spoken of the possibility
of escape. Explain yourself."</p>

<p>He was not accustomed to being spoken to thus peremptorily by
one of the lower orders, as the Morgors considered us; but he
laughed, taking it in good part. The Morgors cannot smile. From
birth to death they wear their death's head grin&mdash;frozen,
unchangeable.</p>

<p>"There is just a chance," he said. "It is just barely a
chance. Slender would be an optimistic description of it, but if
it fails we shall be no worse off than we are now."</p>

<p>"Tell us what it is," I said.</p>

<p>"I can pick the lock of our cell door," he explained. "If luck
is with us, we can escape from this building. I know a way that
is little used, for I was for a long time one of the prison guard."</p>

<p>"What chance would we have once we were in the streets of the
city?" demanded U Dan. "We three, at least, would be picked up
immediately."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," said Vorion. "There are many slaves on the
avenues who look exactly like Zan Dar. Of course, the color of
the skin of you men from Garobus might attract attention; but
that is a chance we shall have to take."</p>

<p>"And after we are in the streets?" asked Zan Dar. "What
then?"</p>

<p>"I shall pretend that I am in charge of you. I shall treat you
as slaves are so often treated that it will arouse no comment nor
attract any undue attention. I shall have to be rough with you,
but you will understand. I shall herd you to a field where there
are many ships. There I shall tell the guard that I have orders
to bring you to clean a certain ship. In this field are only the
private ships of the rich and powerful among us, and I well know
a certain ship that belongs to one who seldom uses it. If we can
reach this ship and board it, nothing can prevent us from
escaping. In an hour from now, we shall be on our way to
Zanor&mdash;if all goes well."</p>

<p>"And if we can take Vaja and Dejah Thoris with us," I
added.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten them," said Vorion. "You would risk your
lives for two females?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said U Dan.</p>

<p>Vorion shrugged. "You are strange creatures," he said.</p>

<p>"We Morgors would not risk a little finger for a score of
them. The only reason that we tolerate them at all is that they
are needed to replenish the supply of warriors. To attempt to
rescue two of yours may easily end in disaster for us all."</p>

<p>"However, we shall make the attempt," he said.

<p>"Are you with us, Zan Dar?" I asked the Savator.</p>

<p>"To the end," he said, "whatever it may be."</p>

<p>Again Vorion shrugged. "As you will," he said, but not with
much enthusiasm; then he set to work on the lock, and in a very
short time the door swung open and we stepped out into the
corridor. Vorion closed the door and relocked it. "This is going
to give them food for speculation," he remarked.</p>

<p>He led us along the corridor in the opposite direction from
that in which we had been brought to it and from which all those
had come who had approached our cell since our incarceration. The
corridor became dark and dusty the farther we traversed it.
Evidently it was little used. At its very end was a door, the
lock to which Vorion quickly picked; and a moment later we
stepped out into a narrow alleyway.</p>

<p>So simple had been our escape up to now that I immediately
apprehended the worst: such luck could not last. Even the alley
which we had entered was deserted: no one had seen us emerge from
the prison. But when we reached the end of the alley and turned
into a broad avenue, the situation was very different. Here were
many people&mdash;Morgors upon the sidewalks, slaves in the
gutters, strange beasts of burden carrying their loads of
passengers upon the pavement.</p>

<p>Now, Vorion began to berate and cuff us as we walked in the
gutter and he upon the sidewalk. He directed us away from the
central plaza and finally into less frequented avenues, yet we
still passed too many Morgors to suit me. At any minute one of
them might notice the unusual coloration of U Dan's skin and
mine. I glanced at Zan Dar to note if the difference between his
coloration and ours was at all startling, and I got a shock. Zan
Dar's skin had been blue. Now it was purple! It took me a moment
to realize that the change was due to the rosy light of the
volcano's flames turning Zan Dar's natural blue to purple.</p>

<p>We had covered quite a little distance in safety, when a
Morgor, passing, eyed us suspiciously. He let us go by him; then
he wheeled and called to Vorion. "Who are those two?" he
demanded. "They are not Savators."</p>

<p>"They have been ill," said Vorion, "and their color has
changed." I was surprised that the fellow could think so
quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, who are you?" asked the fellow, "and what are you doing
in charge of slaves while unarmed?"</p>

<p>Vorion looked down at his sides in simulated surprise. "Why, I
must have forgotten them," he said.</p>

<p>"I think that you are lying to me," said the fellow. "Come
along with me, all of you."</p>

<p>Here seemed an end of our hopes of escape. I glanced up and
down the street. It appeared to be a quiet, residential avenue.
There was no one near us. Several small ships rested at the curb
in front of drear, brown domiciles. That was all. No eyes were
upon us. I stepped close to the fellow who had thus rashly
presented himself as an obstacle in the way of Dejah Thoris'
rescue. I struck him once. I struck him with all my strength. He
dropped like a log.</p>

<p>"You have killed him," exclaimed Vorion. "He was one of
Bandolian's most trusted officers. If we are caught now, we shall
be tortured to death."</p>

<p>"We need not be caught," I said. "Let's take one of these
ships standing at the curb. Why take the time and the risk to go
farther?"</p>

<p>Vorion shook his head. "They wouldn't do," he said. "They are
only for intramural use. They are low altitude ships that would
never get over even a relatively small mountain range; but more
important still, they cannot be rendered invisible. We shall have
to go on to the field as we have planned."</p>

<p>"To avoid another such encounter as we have just experienced,"
I said, "we had better take one of these ships at least to the
vicinity of the field."</p>

<p>"We shall be no worse off adding theft to murder," said Zan
Dar.</p>

<p>Vorion agreed, and a moment later we were all in a small ship
and sailing along a few yards above the avenue. Keenly
interested, I carefully noted everything that Vorion did in
starting the motor and controlling the craft. It was necessary
for me to ask only a few questions in order to have an excellent
grasp of the handling of the little ship, so familiar was I with
the airships of two other worlds. Perhaps I should never have the
opportunity to operate one of these, but it could do no harm to
know how.</p>

<p>We quitted the flier a short distance from the field and
continued on foot. As Vorion had predicted, a guard halted us and
questioned him. For a moment everything hung in the balance. The
guard appeared skeptical, and the reason for his skepticism was
largely that which had motivated the officer I had killed to
question the regularity of Vorion's asserted mission, the fact
that Vorion was unarmed. The guard told us to wait while he
summoned an officer. That would have been fatal I felt that I
might have to kill this man, too; but I did not see how I could
do it without being observed, as there were many Morgors upon the
field, though none in our immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Vorion saved the day. "Come! Come!" he exclaimed in a tone of
exasperation. "I can't wait here all day while you send for an
officer. I am in a hurry. Let me take these slaves on and start
them to work. The officer can come to the ship and question me as
well as he can question me here."</p>

<p>The guard agreed that there was something in this; and, after
ascertaining the name and location of the ship which we were
supposed to clean, he permitted us to proceed. I breathed an
inward sigh of relief. After we had left him, Vorion said that he
had given him the name and location of a different ship than that
which we were planning to steal Vorion was no fool.</p>

<p>The ship that Vorion had selected was a slim craft which
appeared to have been designed for speed. We lost no time
boarding her; and once again I watched every move that Vorion
made, questioning him concerning everything that was not entirely
clear to me. Although I had spent some eighteen days aboard one
of these Morgorian ships, I had learned nothing relative to their
control, as I had never been allowed in the control room or
permitted to ask questions.</p>

<p>First, Vorion magnetized the hull and sprayed it with the fine
sands of invisibility; then he started the motor and nosed up
gently. I had explained my plan to him, and once he had gained a
little altitude he headed for the palace of Bandolian. Through a
tiny lens set in the bow of this ship the view ahead was
reflected upon a ground glass plate, just as an image is
projected upon the finder of a camera. There were several of
these lenses, and through one of them I presently saw the square
tower at the rear of the palace, the tower in which Dejah Thoris
and Vaja were confined.</p>

<p>"When I bring the ship up to the window," said Vorion, "you
will have to work fast, as the moment that we open the door in
the ship's hull, part of the interior of the ship will be
visible. Some one in the palace or upon the ground may notice it,
and instantly we shall be surrounded by guard and patrol
ships."</p>

<p>"I shall work fast," I said.</p>

<p>I must admit that I was more excited than usual as Vorion
brought the craft alongside the tower window, which we had seen
was wide open and unbarred. U Dan and Zan Dar stood by to open
the door so that I could leap through the window and then to
close it immediately after I had come aboard with the two girls.
I could no longer see the window now that the craft was broadside
to it; but at a word from Vorion, U Dan and Zan Dar slid the door
back. The open window was before me, and I leaped through it into
the interior of the tower room.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, fortunately for Dejah Thoris, and
fortunately&mdash;for Vaja, it was the right room. The two girls
were there, but they were not alone. A man held Dejah Thoris in
his arms, his lips searching for hers. Vaja was striking him
futilely on the back, and Dejah Thoris was trying to push his
face from hers.</p>

<p>I seized the man by the neck and hurled him across the room,
then I pointed to the window and the ship beyond and told the
girls to get aboard as fast as they could. They needed no second
invitation. As they ran across the room toward the window, the
man rose and faced me. It was Multis Par! Recognizing me, he went
almost white; then he whipped out his sword and simultaneously
commenced to shout for the guard.</p>

<p>Seeing that I was unarmed, he came for me. I could not turn
and run for the window: had I, he could have run me through long
before I could have reached it; so I did the next best thing. I
charged straight for him. This apparently suicidal act of mine
evidently confused him, for he fell back. But when I was close to
him, he lunged for me. I parried the thrust with my forearm. I
was inside his point now, and an instant later my fingers closed
upon his throat. Like a fool, he dropped his sword then and
attempted to claw my fingers loose with his two hands. He could
have shortened his hold on it and run me through the heart, but I
had had to take that chance.</p>

<p>I would have finished him off in a moment had not the
door of the room been then thrown open to admit a dozen Morgor
warriors. I was stunned! After everything had worked so well, to
have this happen! Were all our plans to be thus thwarted? No, not
all.</p>

<p>I shouted to U Dan: "Close the door and take off! It is a
command!"</p>

<p>U Dan hesitated. Dejah Thoris stood at his side with one hand
outstretched toward me and an indescribable expression of anguish
on her face. She took a step forward as though to leap from the
ship back into the room. U Dan quickly barred her way, and then
the ship started to move away. Slowly the door slid closed, and
once again the craft was entirely invisible.</p>

<p>All this transpired in but a few seconds while I still clung
to Multis Par's throat. His tongue protruded and his eyes stared
glassily. In a moment more he would have been dead; then the
Morgor warriors were upon me, and I was dragged from my prey.</p>

<p>My captors handled me rather roughly and, perhaps, not without
reason, for I had knocked three of them unconscious before they
overpowered me. Had I but had a sword! What I should have done to
them then! But though I was battered and bruised as they hustled
me down from the tower, I was smiling; for I was happy. Dejah
Thoris had been snatched from the clutches of the skeleton men
and was, temporarily at least, safe. I had good cause for
rejoicing.</p>

<p>I was taken to a small, unlighted cell beneath the tower; and
here I was manacled and chained to the wall. A heavy door was
slammed shut as my captors left me, and I heard a key turn in a
massive lock.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_7" id="chap2_7">7. PHO LAR</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN solitary confinement unrelieved by even a
suggestion of light, one is thrown entirely upon the resources of
one's thoughts for mitigation of absolute boredom, such boredom
as sometimes leads to insanity for those of weak wills and feeble
nerves. But my thoughts were pleasant thoughts. I envisaged Dejah
Thoris safely bound for a friendly country in an invisible ship
which would be safe from capture, and I felt that three of those
who accompanied her would be definitely friendly and that one of
them, U Dan, might be expected to lay down his life to protect
her were that ever necessary. As to Vorion, I could not even
guess what his attitude toward her would be.</p>

<p>My own situation gave me little concern. I will admit that it
looked rather hopeless, but I had been in tight places before and
yet managed to survive and escape. I still lived, and while life
is in me I never give up hope. I am a confirmed optimist, which,
I think, gives me an attitude of mind that more often than not
commands what we commonly term the breaks of life.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was not long confined in that dark cell. I
slept once, for how long I do not know; and I was very hungry
when a detail of warriors came to take me away, hungry and
thirsty, for they had given me neither food nor water while I had
been confined.</p>

<p>I was not taken before Bandolian this time, but to one of his
officers, a huge skeleton that continually opened and closed its
jaws with a snapping and grinding sound. The creature was Death
incarnate. From the way he questioned me, I concluded that he
must be the lord high inquisitor. In silence, he eyed me from
those seemingly hollow sockets for a full minute before he spoke;
then he bellowed at me.</p>

<p>"Thing," he shouted, "for even a small part of what you have
done you deserve death&mdash;death after torture."</p>

<p>"You don't have to shout at me," I said; "I am not deaf."</p>

<p>That enraged him, and he pounded upon his desk. "For impudence
and disrespect it will go harder with you."</p>

<p>"I cannot show respect when I do not feel respect," I told
him. "I respect only those who command my respect. I surely could
not respect a bag of bones with an evil disposition."</p>

<p>I do not know why I deliberately tried to infuriate him.
Perhaps it is just a weakness of mine to enjoy baiting enemies
whom I think contemptible. It is, I admit, a habit fraught with,
danger; and, perhaps, a stupid habit; but I have found that it
sometimes so disconcerts an enemy as to give me a certain
advantage. In this instance I was at least successful in part:
the creature was so furious that for some time it remained
speechless; then it leaped to its feet with drawn sword.</p>

<p>My situation was far from enviable. I was unarmed, and the
creature facing me was in an uncontrollable rage. In addition to
all this, there were four or five other Morgors in the room, two
of whom were holding my arms, one on either side. I was as
helpless as a sheep in an abattoir. But as my would-be
executioner came around the end of his desk to spit me on his
blade, another Morgor entered the room.</p>

<p>The newcomer took in the situation at a glance, and shouted,
"Stop, Gorgum!" The thing coming for me hesitated a moment then
he dropped his point.</p>

<p>"The creature deserves death," Gorgum said, sullenly. "It
defied and insulted me&mdash;me, an officer of the Great
Bandolian!"</p>

<p>"Vengeance belongs to Bandolian," said the other, "and he has
different plans for this insolent worm. What has your questioning
developed?"</p>

<p>"He has been so busy screaming at me that he has had no time
to question me," I said.</p>

<p>"Silence, low one!" snapped the newcomer. "I can well
understand," he said to Gorgum, "that your patience must have
been sorely tried; but we must respect the wishes of the Great
Bandolian. Proceed with the investigation."</p>

<p>Gorgum returned his sword to its scabbard and reseated himself
at his desk. "What is your name?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"John Carter, Prince of Helium," I replied. A scribe at
Gorgum's side scribbled in a large book. I supposed that he was
recording the question and the answer. He kept this up during the
entire interview.</p>

<p>"How did you and the other conspirators escape from the cell
in which you were confined?" Gorgum asked.</p>

<p>"Through the doorway," I replied.</p>

<p>"That is impossible. The door was locked when you were placed
in the cell. It was locked at the time your absence was
discovered."</p>

<p>"If you know so much, why bother to question me?"</p>

<p>Gorgum's jaws snapped and ground, more viciously than ever.
"You see, Horur," he said angrily, turning to the other officer,
"the insolence of the creature."</p>

<p>"Answer the noble Gorgum's question," Horur snapped at me.
"How did you pass through a locked door?"</p>

<p>"It was not locked."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> locked," shouted Gorgum.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "What is the use?" I asked. "It is a waste of time
to answer the questions of one who knows more about the subject
than I, notwithstanding the fact that he was not there."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, in your own words how you escaped from the
cell," said Horur in a less irritating tone of voice.</p>

<p>"We picked the lock."</p>

<p>"That would have been impossible," bellowed Gorgum.</p>

<p>"Then we are still in the cell," I said. "Perhaps you had
better go and look."</p>

<p>"We are getting nowhere," snapped Horur.</p>

<p>"Rapidly," I agreed.</p>

<p>"I shall question the prisoner," said Horur. "We concede that
you did escape from the cell."</p>

<p>"Rather shrewd of you."</p>

<p>He ignored the comment. "I cannot see that the means you
adopted are of great importance. What we really wish to know is
where your accomplices and the two female prisoners are now.
Multis Par says that they escaped in a ship&mdash;probably one
of our own which was stolen from a flying field."</p>

<p>"I do not know where they are."</p>

<p>"Do you know where they planned to go?"</p>

<p>"If I did, I would not tell you."</p>

<p>"I command you to answer me, on pain of death."</p>

<p>I laughed at the creature. "You intend to kill me anyway; so
your threat finds me indifferent."</p>

<p>Horur kept his temper much better than had Gorgum, but I could
see that he was annoyed. "You could preserve your life if you
were more co-operative," he said. "Great Bandolian asks but
little of you. Tell us where your accomplices intended going and
promise to aid Great Bandolian in his conquest of Helium, and
your life will be spared."</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>"Wait," urged Horur. "Bandolian will go even further.
Following our conquest of Helium, he will permit you and your
mate to return to that country and he will give you a high office
in the new government he intends to establish there. If you
refuse, you shall be destroyed; your mate will be hunted down
and, I promise you, she will be found. Her fate will be
infinitely worse than death. You had better think it over."</p>

<p>"I do not need to think over such a proposition. I can give
you a final answer on both counts&mdash;my irrevocable answer. It
is&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>If Horur had had a lip, he would doubtless have bitten it. He
looked at me for a long minute, then he said, "Fool!" after which
he turned to Gorgum. "Have it placed with those who are being
held for the next class;" then he left the room.</p>

<p>I was now taken to a building located at some distance from
those in which I had previously been incarcerated, and placed in
a large cell with some twenty other prisoners, all of whom were
Savators.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" demanded one of my fellow prisoners after
my escort had left and locked the door. "A man with a red skin!
He is no Savator. What are you, fellow?"</p>

<p>I did not like the looks of him, nor his tone of voice. I was
not seeking trouble with those with whom I was to be imprisoned
and with whom I was probably destined to die; so I walked away
from the fellow and sat down on a bench in another part of the
chamber, which was quite large. But the fool followed me and
stood in front of me in a truculent attitude.</p>

<p>"I asked you what you were," he said, threateningly; "and when
Pho Lar asks you a question, see that you answer it&mdash;and
quickly. I am top man here." He looked around at the others.
"That's right, isn't it?" he demanded of them.</p>

<p>There were some sullen, affirmative grunts. I could see at
once that the fellow was unpopular. He appeared a man of
considerable muscular development; and his reception of me, a
newcomer among them, testified to the fact that he was a bully.
It was evident that e had the other prisoners cowed.</p>

<p>"You seem to be looking fohr trouble, Lo Phar," I said; "but I
am not. I am already in enough trouble."</p>

<p>"My name is Pho Lar, fellow," he barked.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make? You would stink by any name."
The other prisoners immediately took interested notice. Some of
them grinned.</p>

<p>"I see that I shall have to put you in your place," said Pho
Lar, advancing toward me angrily.</p>

<p>"I do not want any trouble with you," I said. "It is bad
enough to be imprisoned, without quarreling with fellow
prisoners."</p>

<p>"You are evidently a coward," said Pho Lar; "so, if you will
get down on your knees and ask my pardon, I shall not harm
you."</p>

<p>I had to laugh at that, which made the fellow furious; yet he
hesitated to attack me. I realized then that he was a typical
bully, yellow at heart. However, to save his face, he would
probably attack me if he could not bluff me. "Don't make me
angry," he said. "When I am angry I do not know my own strength.
I might kill you."</p>

<p>"I wonder if this would make you angry," I said, and slapped
him across the cheek with my open palm. I slapped him so hard
that he nearly fell down. I could have slapped him harder. This
staggered him more than physically. The blood rushed to his blue
face until it turned purple. He was in a spot. He had started
something; and if he were to hold his self-appointed position as
top man, as he had described himself, he would have to finish it.
The other prisoners had now all arisen and formed a half circle
about us. They looked alternately at Pho Lar and at me in eager
anticipation.</p>

<p>Pho Lar had to do something about that slap in the face. He
rushed at me and struck out clumsily. As I warded off his blows,
I realized that he was a very powerful man; but he lacked
science, and I was sure that he lacked guts. I determined to
teach him a lesson that he would not soon forget. I could have
landed a blow in the first few seconds of our encounter that
would have put him to sleep, but I preferred to play with
him.</p>

<p>I countered merely with another slap in the face. He came back
with a haymaker that I ducked; then I slapped him again a little
harder this time.</p>

<p>"Good work!" exclaimed one of the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Go to it, red man!" cried another.</p>

<p>"Kill him!" shouted a third.</p>

<p>Pho Lar tried to clinch; but I caught one of his wrists,
wheeled around, bent over, and threw him over my shoulder. He lit
heavily on the lava flooring. He lay there for a moment, and as
he scrambled to his feet I put a headlock on him and threw him
again. This time he did not get up; so I picked him up and hit
him on the chin. He went down for a long count. I was through
with him, and went and sat down.</p>

<p>The prisoners gathered around me. I could see that they were
pleased with the outcome of the fight. "Pho Lar's had this coming
to him for a long time," said one.</p>

<p>"He sure got it at last!"</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"My name is John Carter. I am from Garobus."</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," said one. "I think we all have. The
Morgors are furious at you because you tricked them so easily. I
suppose they have sent you here to die with us. My name is Han
Du." He held out a hand to me. It was the first time that I had
seen this friendly gesture since leaving the earth. The Martians
place a hand upon your shoulder. I took his hand.</p>

<p>"I am glad to know you, Han Du," I said. "If there are many
more here like Pho Lar, I shall probably need a friend."</p>

<p>"There are no more like him," said Han Du, "and he is
finished."</p>

<p>"You intimated that you are all doomed to die," I said. "Do
you know when or how?"</p>

<p>"When the next class graduates, we shall be pitted against
twice our number of Morgors. It will be soon, now."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_8" id="chap2_8">8. IN THE ARENA</a></h2>

<p class="first">PHO LAR was unconscious for a long time. For a
while, I thought that I might have killed him; but finally he
opened his eyes and looked about. Then he sat up, felt of his
head, and rubbed his jaw. When his eyes found me, he dropped them
to the floor. Slowly and painfully he got to his feet and started
for the far side of the room. Four or five of the prisoners
immediately surrounded him.</p>

<p>"Who's top man now?" demanded one of them and slapped him. Two
more struck him. They were pushing him around and buffeting him
when I walked among them and pushed them away.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone," I said. "He has had enough punishment for a
while. When he has recovered, if one of you wishes to take him
on, that will be all right; but you can't gang up on him."</p>

<p>The biggest of them turned and faced me. "What have you go to
say about it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"This," I replied and knocked him down.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked at me. "I was just asking," he said, and
grinned a sickly grin; then everybody laughed and the tension was
over. After this, we got along famously&mdash;all of us, even Pho
Lar; and I found them all rather decent men. Long imprisonment
and the knowledge that they were facing death had frayed their
nerves; but what had followed my advent had cleared the air, much
as a violent electrical storm does. After that there was a lot of
laughing and talking.</p>

<p>I inquired if any of them were from Zan Dar's country Zanor;
but none of them was. Several of them knew where it was, and one
scratched a rough map of part of Jupiter on the wall of our cell
to show me where Zanor was located. "But much good it will do you
to know," he said.</p>

<p>"One never can tell," I replied.</p>

<p>They had told me what I was to expect at the graduating
exercises, and I gave the subject considerable thought. I did not
purpose attending a Morgor commencement in the role of a willing
sacrifice.</p>

<p>"How many of you men are expert swordsmen?" I asked.</p>

<p>About half of them claimed to be, but it is a failing of
fighting men to boast of their prowess. Not of all fighting men,
but of many, usually those with the least to boast of. I wished
that I had some means of determining which were really good.</p>

<p>"Of course we can't get hold of any swords," I said, "but if
we had some sticks about the length of swords, we could soon find
out who were the best swordsmen among us."</p>

<p>"What good would that do us?" asked one.</p>

<p>"We could give those Morgors a run for their money," I said,
"and make them pay for their own graduation."</p>

<p>"The slave who brings our food is from my country," said Han
Du. "I think he might smuggle a couple of sticks in to us. He is
a good fellow. I'll ask him when he comes."</p>

<p>Pho Lar had said nothing about his swordsmanship; so, as he
had proved himself a great boaster, I felt that he was not a
swordsman at all. I was sorry, as he was by far the most powerful
of all the Savator prisoners; and he was tall, too. With a little
skill, he should have proved a most formidable swordsman. Han Du
never boasted about anything; but he said that in his country,
the men were much given to sword play; so I was counting on
him.</p>

<p>Finally, Han Du's compatriot smuggled in a couple of wooden
rods about the length of a long sword; and I went to work to
ascertain how my fellow prisoners stacked up as swordsmen. Most
of them were good; a few were excellent; Han Du was magnificent;
and, much to everyone's surprise, Pho Lar was superb. He gave me
one of the most strenuous workouts I have ever had before I could
touch him. It must have taken me nearly an hour to disarm him. He
was one of the greatest swordsmen I had ever faced.</p>

<p>Since our altercation upon my induction to their company, Pho
Lar had kept much to himself. He seldom spoke, and I thought he
might be brooding and planning on revenge. I had to find out just
where he stood, as I could not take any chances on treachery or
even half-hearted co-operation.</p>

<p>I took Pho Lar aside after the passage with the wooden sticks.
I put my cards squarely on the table. "My plan," I said,
"requires as many good swordsmen as I can get. You are one of the
finest I have ever met, but you may think that you have reason to
dislike me and therefore be unwilling to give me your full
support. I cannot use any man who will not follow me and obey me
even to death. How about it?"</p>

<p>"I will follow wherever you lead," he said. "Here is my hand
on it&mdash;if you will take my hand in friendship."</p>

<p>"I am glad to do it."</p>

<p>As we grasped hands, he said, "If I had known a man like you
years ago, I should not have been the fool that I have been. You
may count on me to my last drop of blood, and before you and I
die we shall have shown the Morgors something that they will
never forget. They think that they are great swordsmen, but after
they have seen you in action they will have their doubts. I can
scarcely wait for the time."</p>

<p>I was impressed by Pho Lar's protestations. I felt that he was
sincere, but I could not disabuse my mind of my first impression
of him that he was at heart an arrant coward. But perhaps, facing
death, he would fight as a cornered rat fights. If he did, and
didn't lose his head, he would wreak havoc on the Morgors.</p>

<p>There were twenty of us in that cell. No longer did time drag
heavily. It passed quickly in practice with our two wooden rods.
Han Du, Pho Lar, and I, acting as instructors, taught the others
what tricks of swordsmanship we knew until we were twenty
excellent swordsmen. Several were outstanding.</p>

<p>We discussed several plans of action. We knew that, if custom
prevailed, we should be pitted against forty young Morgor cadets
striving to win to the warrior caste. We decided to fight in
pairs, each of our ten best swordsmen being paired with one of
the ten less proficient; but this pairing was to follow an
initial charge by the first ten, with our team mates close behind
us. We hoped thus to eliminate many of the Morgors in the first
few moments of the encounter, thus greatly reducing the odds
against us. Perhaps we of the first ten overestimated our
prowess. Only time would tell.</p>

<p>There was some nervousness among the prisoners, due, I think,
to the uncertainty as to when we should be called upon to face
those unequal odds. Each knew that some of us would die. If any
survived, we had only rumor to substantiate our hope that they
would be set free; and no man there trusted the Morgors. Every
footfall in the corridor brought silence to the cell, with every
eye fixed upon the door.</p>

<p>At long last our anxiety was relieved: a full company of
warriors came to escort us to the field where we were to fight. I
glanced quickly around at the prisoners' faces. Many were smiling
and there were sighs of relief. I felt greatly encouraged.</p>

<p>We were taken to a rectangular field with tiers of seats on
each of its four sides. The stands were crowded. Thousands of
eye's stared from the hollow sockets of grinning skulls. It might
have been a field day in Hell. There was no sound. There were no
bands. There were no flying flags, no color. We were given swords
and herded together at one end of the field. An official gave us
our instructions.</p>

<p>"When the cadets come on the field at the far end, you will
advance and engage them." That was all.</p>

<p>"And what of those of us who survived?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None of you will survive, creature," he replied.</p>

<p>"We understand that those who survived would be given their
freedom," I insisted.</p>

<p>"None of you will survive," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Would you like to place a little bet on that?"</p>

<p>"None of your impudence, creature." The fellow was getting
angry.</p>

<p>"But suppose one of us should survive?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"In that case his life would be spared and he would be allowed
to continue in slavery, but none has ever survived these
exercises. The cadets are on the field!" he cried. "Go to your
deaths, worms!"</p>

<p>"To your stations, worms!" I commanded. The prisoners laughed
as they took their allotted positions: the first ten in the front
line, each with his partner behind him. I was near the center of
the line. Han Du and Pho Lar were on the flanks. We marched
forward as we had practiced it in our cell, all in step, the men
in the rear rank giving the cadence by chanting, "Death to the
Morgors!" over and over. We kept intervals and distance a little
greater than the length of an extended sword arm and sword.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Morgors had never seen anything like
that at a commencement exercise, for I could hear the hollow
sound of their exclamations of surprise arising from the stands;
and the cadets advancing to meet us were seemingly thrown into
confusion. They were spread out in pairs in a line that extended
almost all the way across the field, and it suddenly became a
very ragged line. When we were about twenty-five feet from this
line, I gave the command, "Charge!"</p>

<p>We ten, hitting the center of their line, had no odds against
us: the Morgors had spread their line too thin. They saw
swordsmanship in those first few seconds such as I'll warrant no
Morgor ever saw before. Ten Morgors lay dead or dying on the
field, as five of our first ten wheeled toward the right,
followed by our partners; and our remaining ten men wheeled to
the left.</p>

<p>As we had not lost a man in the first onslaught, each ten was
now pitted against fifteen of the enemy. The odds were not so
heavily against us. Taking each half of the Morgor line on its
flank, as we now were, gave us a great advantage; and we took
heavy toll of them before those on the far flanks could get into
action, with the result that we were presently fighting on an
almost even footing, our partners having now come into
action.</p>

<p>The Morgors fought with fanatic determination. Many of them
were splendid swordsmen, but none of them was a match for any of
our first ten. I caught an occasional glimpse of Pho Lar. He was
magnificent. I doubt that any swordsman of any of the three
worlds upon which I had fought could have touched Pho Lar, Han
Du, or me with his point; and there were seven more of us here
almost as good.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes of the start of the engagement, all
that remained was the mopping up of the surviving Morgors. We had
lost ten men, all of the first ten swordsmen having survived. As
the last of the Morgors fell, one could almost feel the deathly
silence that had settled upon the audience.</p>

<p>The nine gathered around me. "What now?" asked Pho Lar.</p>

<p>"How many of you want to go back to slavery?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted nine voices.</p>

<p>"We are the ten best swords on Eurobus," I said. "We could
fight our way out of the city. You men know the country beyond.
What chance would we have to escape capture?"</p>

<p>"There would be a chance," said Han Du. "Beyond the city, the
jungle comes close. If we could make that, they might never find
us."</p>

<p>"Good!" I said, and started at a trot toward a gate at one end
of the field, the nine at my heels.</p>

<p>At the gateway, a handful of foolish guardsmen tried to stop
us. We left them behind us, dead. Now we heard angry shouts
arising from the field we had left, and we guessed that soon we
should have hundreds of Morgors in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Who knows the way to the nearest gate?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I do," said one of my companions. "Follow me!" and he set off
at a run.</p>

<p>As we raced through the avenues of the drear city, the angry
shouts of our pursuers followed us; but we held our distance and
at last arrived at one of the city gates. Here again we were
confronted by armed warriors who compelled us to put up a stiff
battle. The cries of the pursuing Morgors grew louder and louder.
Soon all that we had gained would be lost. This must not be! I
called Pho Lar and Han Du to my side and ordered the remaining
seven to give us room, for the gateway was too narrow for ten men
to wield their blades within it advantageously.</p>

<p>"This time we go through!" I shouted to my two companions as
we rushed the surviving guardsmen. And we went through. They
hadn't a chance against the three best swordsmen of three
worlds.</p>

<p>Miraculous as it may seem, all ten of us won to freedom with
nothing more than a few superficial scratches to indicate that we
had been in a fight; but the howling Morgors were now close on
our heels. If there is anything in three worlds that I hate, it
is to run from a foe; but it would have been utterly stupid to
have permitted several hundred angry Morgors to have overtaken
me. I ran.</p>

<p>The Morgors gave up the chase before we reached the jungle.
Evidently they had other plans for capturing us. We did not stop
until we were far into the tropical verdure of a great forest;
then we paused to discuss the future and to rest, and we needed
rest.</p>

<p>That forest! I almost hesitate to describe it, so weird, so
unearthly was it. Almost wholly deprived of sunlight, the foliage
was pale, pale with a deathlike pallor, tinged with rose where
the reflected light of the fiery volcanoes filtered through. But
this was by far its least uncanny aspect: the limbs of the trees
moved like living things. They writhed and twined, myriad,
snakelike things. I had scarcely noticed them until we halted.
Suddenly one dropped down and wrapped itself about me. Smiling, I
sought to disentwine it. I stopped smiling: I was as helpless as
a babe encircled by the trunk of an elephant. The thing started
to lift me from the ground, and just then Han Du saw and leaped
forward with drawn sword. He grasped one of my legs, and at the
same time sprang upward and struck with the keen edge of his
blade, severing the limb that had seized me. We dropped to the
ground together.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" I exclaimed. "What is it? and why did it do
that?"</p>

<p>Han Du pointed up. I looked. Above me, at the end of a strong
stem, was a huge blossom&mdash;a horrible thing! In its center
was a large mouth armed with many teeth, and above the mouth were
two staring, lidless eyes.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," said Han Du, "that you are not of Eurobus.
Perhaps you have no such trees as these in your world."</p>

<p>"We certainly have not," I assured him. "A few that eat
insects, perhaps, like Venus's-flytrap; but no maneaters."</p>

<p>"You must always be on your guard when in one of our forests,"
he warned me. "These trees are living, carnivorous animals. They
have a nervous system and a brain, and it is generally believed
that they have a language and talk with one another."</p>

<p>Just then a hideous scream broke from above us. I looked up,
expecting to see some strange, Jupiterian beast above me, but
there was nothing but the writhing limbs and the staring eyes of
the great blossoms of the man-trees.</p>

<p>Han Du laughed. "Their nervous systems are of a low order," he
said, "and their reactions correspondingly slow and sluggish. It
took all this time for the pain of my sword cut to reach the
brain of the blossom to which that limb belongs."</p>

<p>"A man's life would never be safe for a moment in such a
forest," I commented.</p>

<p>"One has to be constantly on guard," admitted Han Du. "If you
ever have to sleep out in the woods, build a smudge. The blossoms
don't like smoke. They close up, and then they cannot see to
attack you. But be sure that you don't oversleep your
smudge."</p>

<p>Vegetable life on Jupiter, practically devoid of sunlight, has
developed along entirely different lines from that on earth.
Nearly all of it has some animal attributes and nearly all of it
is carnivorous, the smaller plants devouring insects, the larger,
in turn, depending upon the larger animals for sustenance on up
to the maneaters such as I had encountered and those which Han Du
said caught and devoured even the hugest animals that exist upon
this strange planet.</p>

<p>We posted a couple of guards, who also kept smudges burning;
and the rest of us lay down to sleep. One of the men had a
chronometer, and this was used to inform the men on guard when to
awaken their relief's. In this way, we all took turns watching
and sleeping.</p>

<p>When all had slept, the smudges were allowed to burn more
brightly, the men cut limbs from the living trees, sliced them
and roasted them. They tasted much like veal. Then we talked over
our plans for the future. It was decided that we should split up
into parties of two or three and scatter; so that some of us at
least might have a chance to escape recapture. They said that the
Morgors would hunt us down for a long time. I felt that we would
be much safer remaining together as we were ten undefeatable
sword-arms; but as the countries from which my companions came
were widely scattered; and, as naturally, each wished if possible
to return to his own home, it was necessary that we separate.</p>

<p>It chanced that Han Du's country lay in the general direction
of Zanor, as did Pho Lar's; so we three bid good-by to the others
and left them. How I was to reach faraway Zanor on a planet of
twenty-three billion square miles of area, I was at some loss to
conceive. So was Han Du. He told me that I would be welcome in
his country, if we were fortunate enough to reach it; but I
assured him that I should never cease to search for Zanor and my
mate.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2_9" id="chap2_9">9. TO ZANOR!</a></h2>

<p class="first">I SHALL not bore you with an account of that
part of my odyssey which finally brought me to one of the cities
of Han Du's country. We kept as much to cover as we could, since
we knew that if Morgors were searching for us, they would be
flying low in invisible ships. Forests offered us our best
protection from discovery, but there were wide plains to cross,
rivers to swim, mountains to climb.</p>

<p>In this world without night, it was difficult to keep account
of time; but it seemed to me that we must have traveled for
months. Pho Lar remained with us for a great deal of the time,
but finally he had to turn away in the direction of his own
country. We were sorry to lose him, as he had developed into a
splendid companion; and we should miss his sword, too.</p>

<p>We had met no men, but had had several encounters with wild
beasts&mdash;creatures of hideous, unearthly appearance, both
powerful and voracious. I soon realized the inadequacy of our
swords as a sole means of defense; so we fashioned spears of a
bamboolike growth that seemed wholly vegetable. I also taught Han
Du and Pho Lar how to make bows and arrows and to use them. We
found them of great advantage in our hunting of smaller animals
and birds for food. In the forests, we subsisted almost wholly on
the meat of the man-tree.</p>

<p>At last Han Du and I came within sight of an ocean. "We are
home," he said. "My city lies close beside the sea." I saw no
city.</p>

<p>We had come down out of some low hills, and were walking
across a narrow coastal plain. Han Du was several yards to my
right, when I suddenly bumped into something solid&mdash;solid as
a brick wall; but there was nothing there! The sudden collision
had caused me to step back. I stretched out my hands, and felt
what seemed to be a solid wall barring my way, yet only a level
expanse of bare ground, but the ground was not entirely bare. It
was dotted, here and there, with strange plants a simple,
leafless stock a foot or two tall bearing a single fuzzy blossom
at its top.</p>

<p>I looked around for Han Du. He had disappeared! He had just
vanished like a punctured soap bubble. All up and down the shore
there was no place into which he could have vanished, nothing
behind which he would have hidden, no hole in the ground into
which he might have darted. I was baffled. I scratched my head in
perplexity, as I started on again toward the beach only to once
more bump into the wall that was not there.</p>

<p>I put my hands against the invisible wall and followed it. It
curved away from me. Foot by foot, I pursued my tantalizing
investigation. After a while I was back right where I had started
from. It seemed that I had run into an invisible tower of solid
air. I started off in a new direction toward the beach, avoiding
the obstacle which had obstructed my way. Alter a dozen paces I
ran into another; then I gave up&mdash;at least temporarily.</p>

<p>Presently I called Han Du's name aloud, and almost instantly
he appeared a short distance from me. "What kind of a game is
this?" I demanded. "I bump into a wall of solid air and when I
look for you, you are not anywhere, you have disappeared."</p>

<p>Han Du laughed. "I keep forgetting that you are a stranger in
this world," he said. "We have come to the city in which I live.
I just stepped into my home to greet my family. That is why you
could not see me." As he spoke, a woman appeared beside him, and
a little child. They seemed to materialize out of thin air. Had I
come to a land of disembodied spirits who had the power to
materialize? I could scarcely believe it, as there was nothing
ghostly nor ethereal about Han Du.</p>

<p>"This is O Ala, my mate," said Han Du. "O Ala, this is John
Carter, Prince of Helium. To him we owe my escape from the
Morgors."</p>

<p>O Ala extended her hand to me. It was a firm, warm hand of
flesh and blood. "Welcome, John Carter," she said. "All that we
have is yours."</p>

<p>It was a sweet gesture of hospitality; but as I looked around,
I could not see that they had anything. "Where is the city?" I
asked.</p>

<p>They both laughed. "Come with us," said O Ala. She led the
way, apparently around an invisible corner; and there, before me,
I saw an open doorway in thin air. Through the doorway, I could
see the interior of a room. "Come in," invited O Ala, and I
followed her into a commodious, circular apartment. Han Du
followed and closed the door. The roof of the apartment was a
dome perhaps twenty feet high at its center. It was divided into
four rooms by sliding hangings which could be closed or drawn
back against the wall.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't I see the house from the outside?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is plastered on the outside with sands of invisibility
which we find in great quantity along the beach," explained Han
Du. "It is about our only protection against the Morgors. Every
house in the city is thus protected, a little over five hundred
of them."</p>

<p>So I had walked into a city of five hundred houses and seen
only an expanse of open beach beside a restless sea. "But where
are the people?" I asked. "Are they, too, invisible?"</p>

<p>"Those who are not away, hunting or fishing, are in their
homes," explained O Ala. "We do not venture out any more than is
necessary, lest Morgors be cruising around in their invisible
ships and see us; thus discovering our city."</p>

<p>"If any of us should be thus caught out," said Han Du, "he
must run away from the city as fast as he can, for if he entered
a house, the Morgors would immediately know that there was a city
here. It is the sacrifice that each of us is in honor bound to
make for the safety of all, for he who runs is almost invariably
caught and carried away, unless he chooses to fight and die."</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said to Han Du, "how in the world you found your
house, when you could not see it or any other house."</p>

<p>"You noticed the umpalla plants growing throughout the city?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I noticed some plants, but I saw no city."</p>

<p>They both laughed again. "We are so accustomed to it that it
does not seem at all strange to us," said O Ala, "but I can
understand that it might prove very confusing to a stranger. You
see, each plant marks the location of a house. By long
experience, each of us has learned the exact location of every
house in the city in relation to every other house."</p>

<p>I remained for what may have been five or six days of earth
time in the home of Han Du and O Ala. I met many of their
friends, all of whom were gracious and helpful to me in every way
that they could be. I was furnished with maps of considerable
areas of the planet, parts of which, I was told, were still
unexplored even by the Morgors. Of greatest value to me was the
fact that Zanor appeared on one of the maps, which also showed
that a vast ocean lay between me and the country in which I
believed Dejah Thoris to be. How I was to cross this ocean
neither I nor my new found friends could offer a suggestion,
other than the rather mad scheme I envisioned of building a sail
boat and trusting myself to the mad caprices of an unknown sea
perhaps swarming with dangerous reptiles. But this I at last
decided was the only hope I had for being again reunited with my
princess.</p>

<p>There was a forest several miles along the coast from the
city, where I might hope to find trees suitable for the
construction of my craft. My friends tried their best to dissuade
me; but when they found that I was determined to carry out my
plan, they loaned me tools; and a dozen of them volunteered to
accompany me to the forest and help me build my boat.</p>

<p>At last all was in readiness; and, accompanied by my volunteer
helpers, I stepped from the house of Han Du to start the short
march to the forest.</p>

<p>Scarcely were we in the open when one of my companions cried,
"Morgors!" Whereupon the Savators scattered in all directions
away from their city.</p>

<p>"Run, John Carter!" shouted Han Du, but I did not run.</p>

<p>A few yards distant, I saw the open doorway in the side of an
invisible ship; and I saw six or seven Morgors emerge from it.
Two rushed toward me; the others scattered in pursuit of the
Savators. In that instant a new plan flashed across my mind.
Hope, almost extinct leaped to life again.</p>

<p>I whipped my sword from its scabbard and leaped forward to
meet the first of the oncoming Morgors, thanking God that there
were only two of them, as delay might easily wreck my hopes.
There was no finesse in my attack: it was stark, brutal murder;
but my conscience did not bother me as I drew my sword from the
heart of the first Morgor and faced the second.</p>

<p>The second fellow gave me a little more trouble, as he had
been forewarned by the fate of his companion; and, too, he
presently recognized me. That made him doubly wary. He commenced
to howl to the others, who were pursuing the Savators, to come
back and help him, bellowing that here was the creature from
Garobus who had led the slaughter at the graduating exercises.
From the corner of an eye, I saw that two of them had heard and
were returning. I must hurry!</p>

<p>The fellow now fought wholly on the defensive in order to gain
time for the others to join him. I had no mind to permit this,
and I pressed him hard, often laying myself wide open, a great
swordsman could have killed me easily. At last I reached him with
a mighty cut that almost severed his head from his body; then,
with only a quick glance behind me to see how close the others
were, I leaped toward the open doorway of the otherwise invisible
ship, a Morgor close upon my heels.</p>

<p>With naked blade still in my hand, I sprang aboard and closed
the door behind me; then I wheeled to face whatever of their
fellows had been left aboard to guard the craft. The fools had
left no one. I had the ship all to myself; and as I ran to the
controls I heard the Morgors beating upon the door, angrily
demanding that I open it. They must have taken me for a fool,
too.</p>

<p>A moment later the ship rose into the air, and I was away upon
one of the strangest adventures of my life&mdash;navigating an
unknown planet in an invisible craft. And I had much to learn
about navigation of Jupiter. By watching Vorion, I had learned
how to start and stop a Morgor ship, how to gain or lose
altitude, and how to cloak the ship in invisibility; but the
instruments upon the panel before me were all entirely
meaningless to me. The hieroglyphs of the Morgors were quite
unintelligible. I had to work it all out for myself.</p>

<p>Opening all the ports, I had a clear field of vision. I could
see the shore I had just left, and I knew the direction of the
coast line. Han Du had explained this to me. It ran due north and
south at that point. The ocean lay to the west of it. I found an
instrument which might easily have been a compass; when I altered
the course of the ship, I saw that it was a compass. I now had my
bearings as closely as it was possible for me to get them. I
consulted my map and discovered that Zanor lay almost exactly
southeast; so out across that vast expanse of ocean I turned the
prow of my ship.</p>

<p>I was free. I had escaped the Morgors unharmed. In Zanor,
Dejah Thoris was safe among friends. That I should soon be with
her, I had no doubt. We had experienced another amazing
adventure. Soon we should be reunited. I had not the slightest
doubt of my ability to find Zanor. Perhaps it is because I am
always so sure of myself that I so often accomplish the seemingly
impossible.</p>

<p>How long I was in crossing that dismal ocean, I do not know.
With Jupiter whirling on its axis nearly three times as fast as
earth, and with no sun, moon, nor stars, I could not measure
time.</p>

<p>I saw no ship upon that entire vast expanse of water, but I
did see life&mdash;plenty of it. And I saw terrific storms that
buffeted my craft, tossing it about like a feather. But that was
nothing compared with what I saw below me as the storms at the
height of their fury lashed the surface of the waters. I realized
then how suicidal would have been my attempt to cross that
terrible ocean in the frail craft that I had planned to build. I
saw waves that must have measured two hundred feet from trough to
crest&mdash;waves that hurled the mighty monsters of the deep as
though they had been tiny minnows. No ship could have lived in
such seas. I realized then why I saw no shipping on this great
Jupiterian ocean.</p>

<p>But at last I sighted land ahead&mdash;and what land! Zan Dar
had told me of the mighty mountains of Zanor rearing their
forested heads twenty miles above the level of the sea, and it
was such mountains that lay ahead of me. If I had reckoned
accurately, this should be Zanor; and these breath-taking
mountains assured me that I had not gone wrong.</p>

<p>I knew from Zan Dar's explanation just where to search for the
stamping grounds of his tribe&mdash;a wild mountain tribe of
fighting men. They lay in a land of meadows and ravines on the
east slope of the highest mountain and at an altitude of only
about ten miles, or about halfway to the summit. Here the air is
only slightly thinner than at sea level, as the cloud envelope
retains the atmosphere of Jupiter as though it were held in a
bag, permitting none of it to escape, while the rapid revolution
of the planet tends to throw the atmosphere far up from the
surface.</p>

<p>Most fortunate was I in coming upon the village of Zan Dar
with little or no difficulty. Entirely invisible, I hovered above
it, dropping down slowly. I knew that the moment they saw a
Morgor ship, they would disappear into the forests that
surrounded the village, waiting there to rush upon any Morgors
who might be foolish enough to leave the ship after landing.</p>

<p>There were people in plain view of me in the village as I
dropped to within fifty feet of the ground. I stopped the ship
and hung there, then I demagnetized the hull; and, as the ship
became instantly visible, I leaped to the door and pushed it
open; so that they could see that I was no Morgor. I waved to
them and shouted that I was a friend of Zan Dar, and asked
permission to land.</p>

<p>They called to me to do so, and I brought the ship slowly
toward the ground. My lonely voyage was over. I had surmounted
seemingly insurmountable obstacles and I had reached my goal.
Soon my incomparable Dejah Thoris would be again in my arms.</p>
