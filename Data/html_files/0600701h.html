<h2><a name="note" id="note">AUTHOR'S NOTE</a>
</h2>

<p class="note">MY knowledge of Sumatra at the time that I chose it
as the scene of a Tarzan story was pathetically inadequate; and as
there was not a book on Sumatra in the Honolulu Public Library, nor
in any of the book stores, it bade fair to remain inadequate.</p>

<p class="note">I wish therefore to acknowledge my indebtedness to
those whose kindness furnished me with the information I sought. If
this volume happens to fall into the hands of any of them, I hope
they will not feel that I abused that kindness.</p>

<p class="note">And so, my sincere thanks to Messrs. K. van der
Eynden, S.J. Rikkers, and Willem Folkers of the Netherlands India
Government; to Mr. C.A. Mackintosh, Netherlands Consul in Honolulu;
to Messrs. N.A.C. Slotemaker de Brume, Director, B. Landheer, and
Leonard de Greve of The Netherlands Information Bureau, New York,
and to my good friend Capt. John Philip Bird, A.A.C. of S., G-2,
USAFPOA, who arranged my first meeting with the Netherlanders.</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Edgar Rice Burroughs</span>,
Honolulu, 11 Sep. 1944</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">PROBABLY not all Dutchmen are stubborn,
notwithstanding the fact that stubbornness is accounted one of
their national characteristics along with many virtues. But if some
Dutchmen lacked stubbornness, the general average of that
intangible was maintained in the person of Hendrik van der Meer. As
practiced by him, stubbornness became a fine art. It also became
his chief avocation. His vocation was that of rubber planter in
Sumatra. In that, he was successful; but it was his stubbornness
that his friends boasted of to strangers.</p>

<p>So, even after the Philippines were invaded and Hong Kong and
Singapore fell, he would not admit that the Japanese could take
Netherland East India. And he would not evacuate his wife and
daughter. He may be accused of stupidity, but in that he was not
alone. There were millions in Great Britain and the United States
who underestimated the strength and resources of Japan&mdash;some
in high places.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Hendrik van der Meer hated the Japanese, if one can
hate what one looks upon contemptuously as vermin. "Wait," he said.
"It will not be long before we chase them back up their trees." His
prophecy erred solely in the matter of chronology. Which was his
undoing.</p>

<p>And the Japs came, and Hendrik van der Meer took to the hills.
With him went his wife, who had been Elsje Verschoor, whom he had
brought from Holland eighteen years before, and their daughter,
Corrie. Two Chinese servants accompanied them&mdash;Lum Kam and
Sing Tai. These were motivated by two very compelling urges. The
first was fear of the Japanese, from whom they knew only too well
what to expect. The other was their real affection for the van der
Meer family. The Javanese plantation workers remained behind. They
knew that the invaders would continue to work the plantation and
that they would have jobs.</p>

<p>Also, this Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity appealed to them. It
would be nice to have the tables turned and be rich and have white
men and women to wait on them.</p>

<p>So the Japs came, and Hendrik van der Meer took to the hills.
But not soon enough. The Japs were always right behind him. They
were methodically tracking down all Netherlanders. The natives of
the kampongs where the van der Meers stopped to rest kept them
informed. By what natural or uncanny powers the natives knew while
the Japs were still miles away is beside the question. They knew,
as primitive people always know such things as quickly as more
civilized peoples might learn them by telegraph or radio. They even
knew how many soldiers composed the patrol&mdash;a sergeant, a
corporal, and nine privates.</p>

<p>"Very bad," said Sing Tai, who had fought against the Japs in
China. "Maybe one time an officer is a little human, but enlisted
men never. We must not let them catch," he nodded toward the two
women.</p>

<p>As they went higher into the hills, the going became bitter. It
rained every day, and the trails were quagmires. Van der Meer was
past his prime, but he was still strong and always stubborn. Even
had his strength given out, his stubbornness would have carried him
on.</p>

<p>Corrie was sixteen then, a slender blonde girl. But she had
health, strength, and endurance. She could always have kept up with
the men in the party. But with Elsje van der Meer it was different.
She had the will but not the strength. And there was no rest. They
would scarcely reach a kampong and throw themselves down on the
floor of a hut, wet, muddy, exhausted, before the natives would
warn them away. Sometimes it was because the Jap patrol was gaining
on them. But often it was because the natives feared to let the
enemy find them harboring whites.</p>

<p>Even the horses gave out at last, and they were compelled to
walk. They were high in the mountains now. Kampongs were far apart.
The natives were fearful and none too friendly. Only a few years
ago they had been cannibals.</p>

<p>For three weeks they stumbled on, searching for a friendly
kampong where they might hide. By now it was obvious that Elsje van
der Meer could go but little farther. For two days they had come
upon no kampong. Their food was only what the forest and the jungle
offered. And they were always wet and cold.</p>

<p>Then late in the afternoon they came upon a wretched village.
The natives were surly and unfriendly, but still they did not deny
them such poor hospitality as they could offer. The chief listened
to their story. Then he told them that while they could not remain
in his village, he would have them guided to another far off the
beaten track, where the Japs would never find them.</p>

<p>Where, a few weeks before, he might have commanded, van der Meer
now swallowed his pride and begged the chief to permit them at
least to remain overnight that his wife might gain strength for the
journey that lay ahead. But Hoesin refused. "Go now," he said, "and
I will furnish guides. Remain, and I will make you prisoners and
turn you over to the Japanese when they come." Like the headmen of
other villages through which they had passed, he feared the wrath
of the invaders should they discover that he was harboring
whites.</p>

<p>And so the nightmare journey was resumed through terrain cut by
a frightful chasm, river eroded in tuff strata laid down through
the ages by nearby volcanoes. And this river cut their trail, not
once, but many times. Sometimes they could ford it. Again it could
be crossed only on frail, swaying rope bridges. And this long after
dark on a moonless night.</p>

<p>Elsje van der Meer, now too weak to walk, was carried by Lum Kam
in an improvised sling strapped to his back. The guides, anxious to
reach the safety of a kampong, urged them constantly to greater
speed, for twice they had heard the coughing of tigers&mdash;that
coughing grunt that chills the blood.</p>

<p>Van der Meer walked close to Lum Kam to steady him should he
slip upon the muddy trail. Corrie followed behind her father, and
Sing Tai brought up the rear. The two guides were at the head of
the little column.</p>

<p>"You tired, missy?" asked Sing Tai. "Maybe so better I carry
you."</p>

<p>"We all are tired," replied the girl; "but I can carry on as
long as any of you. I wonder how much farther it is."</p>

<p>They had started to ascend a trail steeply. "Pretty soon there,"
said Sing Tai. "Guide say kampong top of cliff."</p>

<p>But they were not pretty soon there, for this was the most
arduous part of the journey. They had to stop often and rest. Lum
Kam's heart was pounding. But it was this loyal heart and an iron
will that kept him from sinking down exhausted.</p>

<p>At long last they reached the top, and presently the barking of
dogs told them that they were approaching a kampong. The natives,
aroused, challenged them. The guides explained their presence, and
they were admitted. Taku Muda, the chief, greeted them with
friendly words.</p>

<p>"You are safe here," he said. "You are among friends."</p>

<p>"'My wife is exhausted," explained van der Meer. "She must have
rest before we can go on. But I do not wish to expose you to the
anger of the Japanese should they discover that you had helped us.
Let us rest here tonight; and tomorrow, if my wife can be moved,
find us a hiding place deeper in the mountains. Perhaps there is a
cave in some isolated gorge."</p>

<p>"There are caves," replied Taku Muda, "but you will remain here.
Here you are safe. No enemy will find my village."</p>

<p>They were given food and a dry house in which to sleep. But
Elsje van der Meer could eat nothing. She was burning with fever,
but there was nothing they could do for her. Hendrik van der Meer
and Corrie sat beside her the remainder of the night. What must
have been the thoughts of this man whose stubbornness had brought
this suffering upon the woman he loved? Before noon Elsje van der
Meer died.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as a grief too poignant for tears. Father
and daughter sat for hours, dry eyed, beside their dead, stunned by
the catastrophe that had overwhelmed them. They were only dully
conscious of sudden turmoil and shouting in the compound. Then Sing
Tai burst in upon them.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried. "Japs come. One man guide last night bring
'um. Hoesin bad man. He send 'um."</p>

<p>Van der Meer rose. "I will go and talk with them," he said. "We
have done nothing. Maybe they will not harm us."</p>

<p>"You no know monkey-men," said Sing Tai.</p>

<p>Van der Meer shrugged. "There is nothing else I can do. If I
fail, Sing Tai, try to get missy away. Do not let her fall into
their hands."</p>

<p>He went to the door of the hut and descended the ladder to the
ground. Lum Kam joined him. The Japs were on the far side of the
compound. Van der Meer walked boldly toward them, Lum Kam at his
side. Neither man was armed. Corrie and Sing Tai watched from the
dark interior of the hut. They could see, but they could not be
seen.</p>

<p>They saw the Japs surround the two men. They heard the voice of
the white man and the monkey jabber of the Japs, but they could not
make out what was said. Suddenly they saw a rifle butt rise above
the heads of the men. It was thrust as suddenly downward. They knew
that on the other end of the rifle was a bayonet. They heard a
scream. Then more rifle butts were raised and lunged downward. The
screams ceased. Only the laughter of the sub-men was to be
heard.</p>

<p>Sing Tai seized the girl's arm. "Come!" he said, and drew her to
the rear of the hut. There was an opening there and, below, the
hard ground. "I drop," said Sing Tai. "Then missy drop. I catch
'um. Savvy?"</p>

<p>She nodded. After the Chinese had dropped safely, the girl
leaned from the opening to reconnoiter. She saw that she could
climb most of the way down. To drop into Sing Tai's arms might
easily have injured him. So she came safely down to within a few
feet of the ground, and Sing Tai lowered her the rest of the way.
Then he led her into the jungle that grew close to the kampong.</p>

<p>Before dark they found a cave in a limestone cliff and hid there
for two days. Then Sing Tai returned to the kampong to investigate
and to get food if the Japs had left.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he returned to the cave empty handed. "All
gone," he said. "All dead. Houses burned."</p>

<p>"Poor Taku Muda," sighed Corrie. "This was his reward for an act
of humanity."</p>

<p>Two years passed. Corrie and Sing Tai had found asylum in a
remote mountain kampong with Chief Tiang Umar. Only occasionally
did news from the outside world reach them. The only news that
would be good news to them would have been that the Japs had been
driven from the island. But that news did not come. Sometimes a
villager, trading far afield, would return with stories of great
Japanese victories, of the American Navy sunk, of German victories
in Africa, Europe, or Russia. To Corrie the future seemed
hopeless.</p>

<p>One day a native came who did not belong to the village of Tiang
Umar. He looked long at Corrie and Sing Tai, but he said nothing.
After he had gone away, the Chinese told the girl. "That man bad
news," he said. "Him from kampong Chief Hoesin. Now he go tell and
monkey-men come. Maybeso you better be boy. Then we go away and
hide some more."</p>

<p>Sing Tai cut Corrie's golden hair to the proper length and dyed
it black. He painted her eyebrows, too. She was already deeply
tanned by the equatorial sun, and with the blue trousers and the
loose blouse he fashioned for her, she could pass as a native boy
anything but the closest scrutiny. Then they went away again,
taking up their interminable flight. Tiang Umar sent men to guide
them to a new sanctuary. It was not far from the village&mdash;a
cave close to a tiny mountain stream. There there were to be found
many varieties of the edible things that grow in a Sumatran forest
jungle, and in the stream there were fish. Occasionally, Tiang Umar
sent some eggs and a chicken. Once in a while pork or dog meat.
Corrie could not eat the latter, so Sing Tai got it all. A youth
named Alam always brought the food. The three became fast
friends.</p>

<p>Captain Tokujo Matsuo and Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe led a
detachment of soldiers deep into the mountains to locate strategic
positions for heavy coastal guns and survey practical roads leading
to them.</p>

<p>They came to the kampong of Hoesin, the chief who had betrayed
the van der Meers. They knew of him by report as one who would
collaborate with the Japanese. Still it was necessary to impress
him with their superiority; so, when he failed to bow from the
waist when they approached him, they slapped his face. One of the
enlisted men ran a bayonet through a native who refused to bow to
him. Another dragged a screaming girl into the jungle. Captain
Matsuo and Lieutenant Sokabe smiled toothy smiles. Then they
demanded food.</p>

<p>Hoesin would rather have cut their throats, but he had food
brought to them and to their men. The officers said that they would
honor him by making his village their headquarters while they
remained in the vicinity. Hoesin saw ruin staring him in the face.
Frantically he searched his mind for some artifice by which he
could rid himself of his unwelcome guests. Then he recalled the
story that one of his people had brought him a few days before from
another village. It did not seem to him very likely to be of value
in ridding himself of these monkeys, but it would do no harm to
try. He thought about it during a sleepless night.</p>

<p>The following morning he asked them if they were interested in
finding enemies who had taken refuge in the mountains. They said
that they were. "Two years ago three whites and two Chinese came to
my village; I sent them on to another village, because I would not
harbor enemies of Greater East Asia. The white man's name was van
der Meer."</p>

<p>"We have heard of him," said the Japs. "He was killed."</p>

<p>"Yes. I sent guides to show your soldiers where they were
hiding. But the daughter and one of the Chinese escaped. The
daughter is very beautiful."</p>

<p>"So we have heard. But what of it?"</p>

<p>"I know where she is."</p>

<p>"And you have not reported it?"</p>

<p>"I only just discovered her hiding place. I can give you a guide
who will lead you to it."</p>

<p>Captain Matsuo shrugged. "Bring us food," he ordered.</p>

<p>Hoesin was crushed. He had food sent them, and then he went to
his hut and prayed to Allah or Buddha or whatever god he prayed to,
asking him to strike the monkey-men dead, or at least cause them to
depart.</p>

<p>Matsuo and Sokabe discussed the matter over their meal. "Perhaps
we should look into the matter," said the former. "It is not well
to have enemies in our rear."</p>

<p>"And they say that she is beautiful," added Sokabe.</p>

<p>"But we cannot both go," said Matsuo. Being both lazy and the
commanding officer, he decided to send Lieutenant Sokabe with a
detachment to find the girl and bring her back. "You will kill the
Chinese," he ordered, "and you will bring the girl
back&mdash;unharmed. You understand? Unharmed."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe came a few days later to the kampong of
Tiang Umar the Chief. Being a very superior person, Lieutenant
Sokabe slapped the old chief so hard that he fell down. Then
Lieutenant Sokabe kicked him in the belly and face. "Where are the
white girl and the Chinese?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"There is no white girl here, nor any Chinese."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"You lie. Soon you will tell the truth." He ordered a sergeant
to get him some bamboo splinters, and when they were brought, he
drove one beneath one of Tiang Umar's finger nails. The old man
screamed in agony.</p>

<p>"Where is the white girl?" demanded the Jap.</p>

<p>"I know of no white girl," insisted Tiang Umar.</p>

<p>The Jap drove another splinter beneath another nail, but still
the old man insisted that he knew nothing of any white girl.</p>

<p>As Sokabe was preparing to continue the torture, one of the
chief's wives came and threw herself upon her knees before him. She
was an old woman&mdash;Tiang Umar's oldest wife. "If you will hurt
him no more, I will tell you how you may find the white girl and
the Chinese," she said.</p>

<p>"This is better," said Sokabe.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Alam knows where they hide," said the old woman, pointing to a
youth.</p>

<p>Corrie and Sing Tai sat at the mouth of their cave. It had been
a week since Alam had brought them food, and they were expecting
him soon with eggs perhaps, and pork or a piece of dog meat. Corrie
hoped that it would be eggs and a chicken.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon some one come," said Sing Tai, listening. "Too
many. Come back into the cave."</p>

<p>Alam pointed out the cave to Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe. Tears
welled from the youth's eyes. Had his life alone been forfeit, he
would have died before he would have led these hated monkey-men to
the hiding place of this girl whom he fairly worshipped. But the
lieutenant had threatened to destroy everyone in the village if he
failed to do so, and Alam knew that he would keep his word.</p>

<p>Hideo Sokabe and his men entered the cave, Sokabe with drawn
sword, the men with fixed bayonets. In the dim light, Sokabe saw a
Chinese and a young native boy. He had them dragged out. "Where is
the girl?" he demanded of Alam. "You shall die for this, and all
your people. Kill them," he said to his men.</p>

<p>"No!" screamed Alam. "That is the girl. She only wears the
clothes of a boy."</p>

<p>Sokabe tore open Corrie's blouse. Then he grinned. A soldier ran
a bayonet through Sing Tai, and the detachment marched away with
their prisoner.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">S/SGT. Joe "Datbum" Bubonovitch of Brooklyn,
assistant engineer and waist gunner, stood in the shade of the wing
of Lovely Lady with the other members of the combat crew of the big
Liberator.</p>

<p>"I've found them pretty swell guys," he said in evident
disagreement with a remark made by ball turret gunner S/Sgt. Tony
"Shrimp" Rosetti of Chicago.</p>

<p>"Yeah? So I suppose dat George Toid was a swell guy. Say, we got
a mayor in Chicago oncet wot dared dat guy to come on over. He said
he'd punch him in de snoot."</p>

<p>"You got your dates mixed, Shrimp."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well, I don't like cartin' no bloody Britisher around in
de Lovely Lady. An' I hear he's a dook, or sumpn."</p>

<p>"I guess here comes your duke now," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>A jeep pulled up beneath the wing of the B-24, disgorging three
officers&mdash;an RAF colonel, an AAF colonel, and an AAF major.
Capt. Jerry Lucas of Oklahoma City, pilot of the Lovely Lady,
stepped forward; and the AAF colonel introduced him to Col.
Clayton.</p>

<p>"All set, Jerry?" asked the American colonel.</p>

<p>"All set, sir."</p>

<p>Electricians and armorers, having given the final, loving
check-up to their gadgets and guns, dropped through the bomb bay
doors; and the combat crew climbed aboard.</p>

<p>Col. John Clayton was flying as an observer on a reconnaissance
and photographic mission over Jap-held Sumatra in Netherland East
Indies, from an air field in (censored). Going forward to the
flight deck when he came aboard, he stood behind the pilots during
the take-off. Later, on the long flight, he took the co-pilot's
place, sometimes the pilot's. He talked with the navigator and the
radio engineer. He edged his way aft along the catwalk through the
bomb bay between auxiliary gas tanks necessitated by the long
flight. The plane carried no bombs. Shrimp and Bubonovitch and the
tail gunner and the other waist gunner were sprawled on the deck
against life rafts and parachutes. Shrimp was the first to see
Clayton open the little door forward of the ball turret.</p>

<p>"Hst!" he warned. "Here comes the dook."</p>

<p>Clayton edged around the ball turret, stepped over Shrimp and
Bubonovitch, and stopped beside the photographer, who was fiddling
with his camera. None of the enlisted men stood up. When a fighting
plane takes to the air, military formality is left grounded. The
photographer, a Signal Corps sergeant, looked up and smiled.
Clayton smiled back and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>Cold wind was swirling up around the ball turret and hurtling
out the tail gunner's open window. The noise of the motors was
deafening. By placing his mouth within an inch of the
photographer's ear and shouting, Clayton asked some questions about
the camera. The photographer screamed his replies. A B-24 in flight
discourages conversation, but Clayton got the information he
wished.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on the edge of a life raft between Shrimp and
Bubonovitch. He passed around a package of cigarettes. Only Shrimp
refused. Bubonovitch offered Clayton a light. Shrimp looked
disgusted. He remembered George III, but he couldn't remember what
he had done. All he knew was that he didn't like Britishers.</p>

<p>Shouting, Clayton asked Bubonovitch his name and where he came
from. When Bubonovitch said Brooklyn, Clayton nodded. "I've heard a
lot about Brooklyn," he said.</p>

<p>"Probably about dem bums," said Bubonovitch. Clayton smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p>"They call me 'Dat Bum,'" said Bubonovitch, grinning. Pretty
soon he was showing the English colonel pictures of his wife and
baby. Then they signed each other's Short Snorter bills. That
brought the other waist gunner, the tail gunner, and the
photographer into the picture. Shrimp remained aloof and
superior.</p>

<p>After Clayton had gone forward, Shrimp allowed that he'd just as
soon have Tojo or Hitler sign his Short Snorter bill as a "dirty
Britisher." "Look wot they done at the Alamo," he challenged.</p>

<p>"You mean Thermopylae," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Well, wot's the difference?"</p>

<p>"He's a good guy," said the tail gunner.</p>

<p>"Like our officers," said the other waist gunner. "No side."</p>

<p>It was dawn when they sighted the northwesterly tip of Sumatra,
and a perfect day for a photographic mission. There were clouds
above the mountains that form the backbone of the eleven hundred
miles long island that sprawls across the equator south and west of
the Malay Peninsula; but the coast line, as far as they could see
it, was cloudless. And it was the coast line they were primarily
interested in.</p>

<p>The Japs must have been taken wholly by surprise, for they had
been photographing for almost half an hour before they encountered
any flak. And this was most ineffective. But as they flew down the
coast, it increased in volume and accuracy. The plane got some
shrapnel from near misses, but luck held with them for a long
time.</p>

<p>Near Padang, three Zeros roared down on them out of the sun.
Bubonovitch got the leader. They could see the plane burst into
flame and plummet earthward. The other two peeled off, and kept at
a respectful distance for a while. Then they turned back. But the
ack-ack increased in volume and accuracy. The inboard starboard
engine got a direct hit, and shrapnel sprayed the cockpit. Lucas's
flak vest saved him, but the co-pilot got a direct hit in the face.
The navigator slipped the co-pilot's safety belt and dragged him
from the cockpit to administer first aid. He was already dead.</p>

<p>So thick and so close was the flak by now, that the great ship
seemed to be bucking like a bronco. To attempt to avoid it, Lucas
turned inshore away from the coast where he knew that most of the
anti-aircraft batteries would be located. In shore, too, were
clouds above the mountains in which they could hide as they turned
back toward home.</p>

<p>Home! Liberators had made great flights in the past on three
engines. The twenty-three-year-old captain had to think quickly. It
was a snap judgment, but he knew it was sound. He ordered
everything thrown overboard except their parachutes&mdash;guns,
ammunition, life rafts, everything. It was the only chance they had
of making their base. Zeros didn't worry Lucas. Zeros usually kept
their distance from heavy bombers. Except for one stretch of water,
the crossing of Malacca Strait, he could keep near land all the
way, skirting the coast of Malaya northwest. If they had to bail
out over water, they would be near shore; and their Mae Wests would
have to answer. That was why he felt that he could jettison the
life rafts.</p>

<p>As they turned in toward the mountains and the clouds, the flak
came thicker and thicker. The Japs must have guessed the pilot's
plan. Lucas knew that some of the mountain peaks rose to twelve
thousand feet. He was flying at twenty thousand now, but slowly
losing altitude. But he was leaving the shore batteries behind.</p>

<p>They were well above the mountains when a mountain battery
opened up on them. Lucas heard a terrific burst, and the plane
careened like a wounded thing. He fought the controls. He spoke
into the intercom, asking reports. There was no reply. The intercom
was dead. He sent the radio man back to check the damage. Clayton,
in the co-pilot's seat, helped with the controls. It required the
combined strength of both men to keep the plane from nosing over.
Lucas called to the navigator. "Check and see that everybody
jumps," he said. "Then you jump."</p>

<p>The navigator poked his head into the nose to tell the nose
gunner to jump. The nose gunner was dead. The radio man came back
to the flight deck. "The whole goddam tail's shot off," he said.
"Butch and that photographer went with it."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Lucas. "Jump, and make it snappy." Then he turned
to Clayton. "Better bail out, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you, if you don't mind, Captain," said
Clayton.</p>

<p>"Jump!" snapped Lucas.</p>

<p>Clayton smiled. "Right-o!" he said.</p>

<p>"I've opened the bomb bay doors," said Lucas. "It's easier out
that way. Make it snappy!"</p>

<p>Clayton reached the catwalk in the bomb bay. The ship was
falling off on one wing. It was evidently going into a spin. One
man could not hold it. He wanted to hang on until Lucas
jumped&mdash;until the last minute. It was the last minute. The
ship careened, throwing Clayton from the catwalk. His body struck
the side of the bomb bay and then rolled out into thin air.</p>

<p>Unconscious, he hurtled toward death. Through heavy, enveloping
clouds his body fell. Lovely Lady, her three motors still roaring,
raced past him. Now, when she crashed she was sure to burn, leaving
nothing for the enemy to learn or salvage.</p>

<p>But momentarily stunned, Clayton soon regained consciousness.
But it took several seconds before he realized his situation. It
was like awakening in a strange room. He had passed through the
cloud bank, and was now in a torrential tropical rain below it.
Perhaps it was to the cold rain that he owed his salvation. It may
have revived him just in time to pull the rip cord while there was
still a margin of seconds.</p>

<p>His chute billowed above him, and his body snapped grotesquely
at the sudden retardation of his fall. Directly beneath him a sea
of foliage billowed to the pounding of hurtling masses of rain. In
a matter of seconds his body crashed through leaves and branches
until his chute caught and held him suspended a couple of hundred
feet above the ground. This close had he come to death.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, he heard a rending and crashing a few hundred
yards away&mdash;a dull explosion followed by a burst of flame.
Lovely Lady's funeral pyre lit up the dismal, dripping forest.</p>

<p>Clayton seized a small branch and pulled himself to a larger one
that would support him. Then he slipped off the chute harness and
his Mae West. His uniform and his underclothes, to the skin, were
soaked and soggy. He had lost his cap during his fall. Now he
removed his shoes and threw them away. His pistol and ammunition
belt followed. Then his socks, tunic, trousers, and underclothes.
He retained only a web belt and his knife in its scabbard.</p>

<p>He next climbed upward until he could release the snagged chute.
He cut away all the lines, wrapped the silk in a small bundle; and,
together with the lines, tied it to his back. Then he commenced the
descent toward the ground. He swung down easily from branch to
branch. From the lowest branches, giant creepers depended to the
ground undergrowth below. Down these he clambered with the agility
of a monkey.</p>

<p>From the silk of his chute, he fashioned a loin cloth. A sense
of well being, of happiness surged through him. Now, that which he
had lost he had regained. That which he loved most. Freedom. The
habiliments of civilization, even the uniform of his country's
armed forces, were to him but emblems of bondage. They had held him
as his chains hold the galley slave, though he had worn his uniform
with pride. But to be honorably free of it was better. And
something told him that Fate may have ordained that he was to serve
his country quite as well naked as uniformed. Else why had Fate
plunged him thus into an enemy stronghold?</p>

<p>The pouring rain sluiced down his bronzed body. It tousled his
black hair. He raised his face to it. A cry of exaltation trembled
on his lips but was not voiced. He was in the country of the
enemy.</p>

<p>His first thought now was of his companions. Those who had
alighted within sound of the crashing plane would naturally attempt
to reach it. He made his way toward it. As he went, he searched the
ground. He was looking for a certain plant. He did not entertain
much hope of finding it in this strange, far away land. But he did.
He found it growing luxuriantly. He gathered some and macerated the
great leaves between his palms. Then he spread the juice over his
entire body, face, limbs, and head.</p>

<p>After that he took to the trees where traveling was easier than
through the lush and tangled undergrowth. Presently he overtook a
man stumbling toward the wrecked plane. It was Jerry Lucas. He
stopped above him and called him by name. The pilot looked in all
directions, except up, and saw no one. But he had recognized the
voice.</p>

<p>"Where the heck are you, colonel?"</p>

<p>"If I jumped, I'd land on your head."</p>

<p>Lucas looked up, and his mouth dropped open. An almost naked
giant was perched above him. He thought quickly: The guy's gone off
his bean. Maybe he hit his head when he landed. Maybe it was just
shock. He decided to pay no attention to the nudity. "Are you all
right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clayton. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Fit as a fiddle."</p>

<p>They were but a short distance from the Lovely Lady. The flames
were rising high above her, and some of the trees were blazing.
When they got as close to her as the heat would permit they saw
Bubonovitch. Bubonovitch saw Lucas and greeted him happily. But he
did not see Clayton until the latter dropped from a tree and
alighted in front of him. Bubonovitch reached for his .45. Then he
recognized the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Migawd!" he exclaimed. "What happened to your clothes?"</p>

<p>"I threw them away."</p>

<p>"Threw them away!"</p>

<p>Clayton nodded. "They were wet and uncomfortable. They weighed
too much."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch shook his head. His eyes wandered over the
Englishman. He saw the knife. "Where's your gun?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I threw that away, too."</p>

<p>"You must be crazy," said Staff Sergeant Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Lucas, standing behind Clayton, shook his head vigorously at his
crewman. But the remark didn't seem to excite Clayton, as the pilot
had feared it might. He just said, "No, not so crazy. You'll be
throwing yours away pretty soon. Inside of twenty-four hours it
will be rusty and useless. But don't throw your knife away. And
keep it clean and sharp. It will kill and not make as much noise as
a .45."</p>

<p>Lucas was watching the flames licking through the openings in
his beloved plane. "Did they all get out?" he asked
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Yes. Lieut. Burnham and I jumped together. He should be close
around here somewhere. All those who were alive got out."</p>

<p>Lucas raised his head and shouted: "Lucas calling! Lucas
calling!"</p>

<p>Faintly an answer came: "Rosetti to Lucas! Rosetti to Lucas! For
Pete's sake come an' get me down outta dis."</p>

<p>"Roger!" shouted Lucas, and the three men started in the
direction from which Shrimp's voice had come.</p>

<p>They found him&mdash;dangling in the harness of his chute a good
hundred feet above the ground. Lucas and Bubonovitch looked up and
scratched their heads&mdash;at least figuratively.</p>

<p>"How you goin' to get me down?" demanded Shrimp.</p>

<p>"Damifino," said Lucas.</p>

<p>"After a while you'll ripen and drop," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Funny, ain'tcha, wise guy? Where'd you pick up dat dope widout
no clothes?"</p>

<p>"This is Colonel Clayton, half-wit," replied Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Oh." It is amazing how much contempt can be crowded into a
two-letter word. And S/Sgt. Tony Rosetti got it all in. It couldn't
be missed. Lucas flushed.</p>

<p>Clayton smiled. "Is the young man allergic to Englishmen?"</p>

<p>"Excuse him, colonel; he doesn't know any better. He's from a
suburb of Chicago known as Cicero."</p>

<p>"How you goin' to get me down?" demanded Shrimp again.</p>

<p>"That's just what I don't know," said Lucas.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll think of some way by tomorrow," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"You ain't a-goin' to leaf me up here all night!" wailed the
ball turret gunner.</p>

<p>"I'll get him down," said Clayton.</p>

<p>There were no vines depending from the tree in which Shrimp hung
that came close enough to the ground to be within reach of Clayton.
He went to another tree and swarmed up the vines like a monkey.
Then he found a loose liana some fifty feet above the ground.
Testing it and finding it secure, he swung out on it, pushing
himself away from the bole of the tree with his feet. Twice he
tried to reach a liana that hung from the tree in which Shrimp was
isolated. His outstretched fingers only touched it. But the third
time they closed around it.</p>

<p>The strength of this liana he tested as he had the other; then,
keeping the first one looped around an arm, he climbed toward
Shrimp. When he came opposite him, he still could not quite reach
him. The gunner was hanging just a little too far from the bole of
the tree.</p>

<p>Clayton tossed him the free end of the liana he had brought over
with him from an adjoining tree. "Grab this," he said, "and hang
on."</p>

<p>Rosetti grabbed, and Clayton pulled him toward him until he
could seize one of the chute's shrouds. Clayton was seated on a
stout limb. He drew Rosetti up beside him.</p>

<p>"Get out of your chute harness and Mae West," he directed.</p>

<p>When Shrimp had done so, Clayton threw him across a shoulder,
seized the liana he had brought from the nearby tree, and slipped
from the limb.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" screamed Rosetti as they swung through space.</p>

<p>Holding by one hand, Clayton seized a waving branch and brought
them to a stop. Then he clambered down the liana to the ground.
When he swung Rosetti from his shoulder, the boy collapsed. He
could not stand. And he was shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>Lucas and Bubonovitch were speechless for a moment. "If I hadn't
seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it," said the
pilot.</p>

<p>"I still don't believe it," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Shall we look for the others?" asked Clayton. "I think we
should try to find them and then get away from the plane. That
smoke can be seen for miles, and the Japs will know exactly what it
is."</p>

<p>They searched and called for several hours without success. And
just before dark they came upon the body of Lieut. Burnham, the
navigator. His chute had failed to open. With their knives they dug
a shallow grave. Then they wrapped him in his chute and buried him.
Jerry Lucas said a short prayer. Then they went away.</p>

<p>In silence they followed Clayton. His eyes were scanning the
trees as they passed them, and it was evident that he was searching
for something. Quite spontaneously, they all seemed to have
acquired unlimited confidence in the big Englishman. Shrimp's eyes
seldom left him. Who may say what the little Cicero mucker was
thinking? He had not spoken since his rescue from the tree. He had
not even thanked Clayton.</p>

<p>It had stopped raining and the mosquitoes swarmed about them. "I
don't see how you stand it, colonel," said Lucas, slapping at
mosquitoes on his face and hands.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" exclaimed Clayton. "I meant to show you." He searched
about and found some of the plants he had discovered earlier in the
afternoon. "Mash these leaves," he said, "and rub the juice on all
the exposed parts of your body. The mosquitoes won't bother you
after that."</p>

<p>Presently, Clayton found that for which he had been
looking&mdash;trees with interlacing branches some twenty feet
above the ground. He swung up easily and commenced to build a
platform. "If any of you men can get up here, you can help me. We
ought to get this thing done before dark."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"It's where we're going to sleep tonight. Maybe for many
nights."</p>

<p>The three men climbed slowly and awkwardly up. They cut branches
and laid them across the limbs that Clayton had selected, forming a
solid platform about ten by seven feet.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it have been easier to have built a shelter on the
ground?" asked Lucas.</p>

<p>"Very much," agreed Clayton, "but if we had, one of us might be
dead before morning."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Because this is tiger country."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"I have smelled them off and on all afternoon."</p>

<p>S/Sgt. Rosetti shot a quick glance at Clayton from the corners
of his eyes and then looked as quickly away.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Englishman knotted several lengths of chute
shrouds together until he had a rope that would reach the ground.
He handed the end of the rope to Bubonovitch. "Haul in when I give
you the word, Sergeant," he said. Then he dropped quickly to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Smelled 'em!" said S/Sgt. Rosetti, exuding skepticism.</p>

<p>Clayton gathered a great bundle of giant elephant ears, made the
end of the rope fast to it, and told Bubonovitch to haul away.
Three such bundles he sent up before he returned to the platform.
With the help of the others, he spread some on the floor of the
platform and with the remainder built an overhead shelter.</p>

<p>"We'll get meat tomorrow," said Clayton. "I'm not familiar with
the fruits and vegetables here except a few. We'll have to watch
what the monkeys eat."</p>

<p>There were plenty of monkeys around them. There had been all
afternoon&mdash;chattering, scolding, criticizing the
newcomers.</p>

<p>"I recognize one edible fruit," said Bubonovitch. "See? In that
next tree, Durio zibethinus, called durian. That siamang is eating
one now&mdash;Symphalangus syndactylus&mdash;the black gibbon of
Sumatra, largest of the gibbons."</p>

<p>"He's off again," said Shrimp. "He can't even call a ant a
ant."</p>

<p>Lucas and Clayton smiled. "I'll get some of the fruit of the
Durio zibeth-whatever-you-call-it," said the latter. He swung
agilely into the adjoining tree and gathered four of the large,
prickly skinned durians, tossing them one by one to his companions.
Then he swung back.</p>

<p>Rosetti was the first to cut his open. "It stinks," he said. "I
ain't that hungry." He started to toss it away. "It's spoiled."</p>

<p>"Wait," cautioned Bubonovitch. "I've read about the durian. It
does stink, but it tastes good. The natives roast the seeds like
chestnuts."</p>

<p>Clayton had listened to Bubonovitch attentively. As they ate the
fruit, he thought; What a country! What an army!</p>

<p>A sergeant who talks like a college professor&mdash;and comes
from Brooklyn at that! He thought, too, how little the rest of the
world really knew America&mdash;the Nazis least of all. Jitterbugs,
playboys, a decadent race! He thought of how gallantly these boys
had fought their guns, of how Lucas had made sure that his crew and
his passenger were out before he jumped. Of how the boy had fought
hopelessly to save his ship.</p>

<p>Night had fallen. The jungle sounds and the jungle voices were
different now. There was movement everywhere around
them&mdash;unseen, stealthy. A hollow, grunting cough rose from the
foot of their tree.</p>

<p>"Wot was dat?" asked Shrimp.</p>

<p>"Stripes," said Clayton.</p>

<p>Shrimp wanted to ask what stripes was, but so far he had
addressed no word to the Britisher. However, curiosity at last got
the best of pride. "Stripes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tiger."</p>

<p>"Geeze! You mean they's a tiger loose down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Two of them."</p>

<p>"Geeze! I seen 'em oncet at the zoo in Chicago. I guess it
wouldn't be so healthy down there. I heard they ate people."</p>

<p>"We've got to thank you, Colonel, that we're not down there,"
said Jerry Lucas.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd be a lot of babes in the woods without him," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"I learned a hell of a lot in Colonel Saffarrans' jungle
training outfit," said Shrimp, "but nothin' about wot to do about
tigers."</p>

<p>"They hunt mostly at night," Clayton explained. "That's when you
have to be on your guard." After a while he said to Bubonovitch,
"From what little I have read about Brooklyn I was led to believe
that Brooklynites had a special pronunciation of English all their
own. You talk like any one else."</p>

<p>"So do you," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Clayton laughed. "I was not educated at Oxford."</p>

<p>"Bum had a higher Brooklyn education," explained Lucas. "He went
through sixth grade."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti dropped off to sleep. Clayton and Lucas
sat at the edge of the platform, their legs dangling, planning for
the future. They agreed that their best chance lay in getting a
boat from friendly natives (if they could find any) on the
southwest coast of the island and then trying to make Australia.
They spoke of this and many other things. Lucas talked about his
crew. He spoke of them with pride. Those who were unaccounted for,
he worried about. Those who were dead were dead. There was nothing
to be done about that now. But Clayton could tell by the tenseness
in his voice when he spoke of them how he felt about them.</p>

<p>He spoke of Rosetti. "He's really a good kid," he said, "and a
top ball turret gunner. Nature molded him for the job. There isn't
much room in a ball turret. Bum says the War Department should
breed 'em, crossing midgets with pygmies. Shrimp has the DFC and
Air Medal with three clusters. He's a good kid all right."</p>

<p>"He certainly hasn't much use for Britishers," laughed
Clayton.</p>

<p>"What with all the Irish and Italians in Chicago, it's not
surprising. And then Shrimp never had much of a chance to learn
anything. His father was killed in Cicero in a gang war when he was
a kid, and I guess his mother was just a gangland moll. She never
had any use for Shrimp, nor he for her. But with a background like
that, you've got to hand it to the kid. He didn't get much
schooling, but he kept straight."</p>

<p>"Bubonovitch interests me," said the Englishman. "He's an
unusually intelligent man."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's not only intelligent, but he's extremely well
educated. The former is not necessarily a corollary of the latter.
Bubonovitch is a graduate of Columbia. His father, a school
teacher, saw to that. Bum got interested in the exhibits in The
American Museum of Natural History in New York when he was in high
school. So he specialized in zoology, botany, anthropology, and all
the other ologies that a fellow has to know to be valuable to the
museum. And when he graduated, he landed a job there. He likes to
pull scientific names of things on Shrimp just to annoy him."</p>

<p>"Then it's probably a good thing for Sgt. Rosetti's blood
pressure that I haven't an Oxford accent," said Clayton.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>As Corrie van der Meer trudged along with her captors her mind
was occupied with but two problems: how to escape and how to
destroy herself if she could not escape. Alam, walking beside her,
spoke to her in his own language, which she understood but which
the Japs did not.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he begged, "for leading them to you. They tortured
Tiang Umar, but he would not tell. Then his old wife could stand it
no longer, and she told them that I knew where you were hiding.
They said that they would kill everyone in the village if I did not
lead them to your hiding place. What could I do?"</p>

<p>"You did right, Alam. Sing Tai and I were only two. It is better
that two die than all the people of a village."</p>

<p>"I do not want you to die," said Alam. "I would rather die
myself."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "What I fear," she said, "is that I may
not find the means to die&mdash;in time."</p>

<p>Lieut. Sokabe spent the night in the kampong of Tiang Umar. The
villagers were sullen and glowering; so Sokabe posted two sentries
before the door of the house where he and his captive slept. To
further preclude the possibility that she might escape, he bound
her wrists and her ankles. Otherwise, he did not molest her. He had
a healthy fear of Capt. Tokujo Matsuo, whose temper was notoriously
vile; and he had a plan.</p>

<p>When he set out the next morning, he took Alam along to act as
interpreter should he require one. Corrie was glad of the company
of this friendly youth. They talked together as they had the
previous day. Corrie asked Alam if he had seen any of the guerrilla
bands that she had heard rumors of from time to time, bands made up
of Dutchmen who had escaped to the hills&mdash;planters, clerks,
soldiers.</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen them; but I have heard of them. I have
heard that they have killed many Japanese. They are desperate men.
The Japanese are always searching for them. They offer the native
people rich rewards for pointing out their hiding places; so these
men are suspicious of all natives they do not know, thinking they
may be spies. It is said that a native who falls into their hands
never returns to his village unless they know that they can trust
him. And who can blame them? I have also heard that many natives
have joined them. Now that we have learned that Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity is for the Japanese alone, we hate them." They passed
the spot where the village of Taku Muda had stood. There was no
evidence that man had ever set foot there, so completely had the
jungle reclaimed it.</p>

<p>"This is the prosperity that the Japanese bring us," said
Alam.</p>

<p>The morning wore on. They marched beneath sullen clouds in a
tropical downpour. The gloomy forest stunk of rotting vegetation.
It exhaled the vapors of death. Death! The girl knew that every
step she took was bringing her closer to it. Unless&mdash;hope does
not die easily in the breast of youth. But unless what?</p>

<p>She heard the roar of motors overhead. But she was used to that
sound. The Japs were always flying over the island. Then, from a
distance, there came to her ears a crashing and rending followed by
a dull explosion. She did not hear the motors again. She thought,
of course, that it was an enemy plane; and it filled her with
satisfaction. The Japs jabbered about it excitedly. Lt. Sokabe
considered investigating. He talked with a sergeant. At last they
decided that they could never find the plane in this tangle of
jungle and forest. It was too far away.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when they reached the kampong that Capt.
Tokujo Matsuo had commandeered for the use of his detachment.
Standing in the doorway of the house that the two officers had taken
for their quarters, Matsuo watched the party approach.</p>

<p>He called to Sokabe. "Where are the prisoners?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant seized Corrie roughly by the arm and pulled her
out of line and toward the captain. "Here," he said.</p>

<p>"I sent you for a Chinaman and a yellow haired Dutch girl, and
you bring back a black haired native boy. Explain."</p>

<p>"We killed the Chinaman," said Sokabe. "This is the Dutch
girl."</p>

<p>"I do not feel like joking, you fool," snarled Matsuo.</p>

<p>Sokabe prodded the girl up the ladder that led to the doorway.
"I do not joke," he said. "This is the girl. She has disguised
herself by dyeing her hair black and wearing the clothing of a
native boy. Look!" Roughly he parted Corrie's hair with his dirty
fingers, revealing the blonde color close to the scalp.</p>

<p>Matsuo scrutinized the girl's features closely. Then he nodded.
"She suits me," he said. "I shall keep her."</p>

<p>"She belongs to me," said Sokabe. "I found her and brought her
here. She is mine."</p>

<p>Matsuo spat. His face turned red. But he managed to restrain
himself. "You forget yourself, Lieutenant Sokabe," he said. "And
take your orders from me. I am commanding officer here. You will
find yourself other quarters at once and leave the girl here."</p>

<p>"You may be a captain," said Sokabe; "but now, because of the
great size of the imperial army and the many casualties, many
officers are low born. My honorable ancestors were samurai. My
honorable uncle is General Hideki Tojo. Your father and all your
uncles are peasants. If I write a letter to my honorable uncle, you
will not be a captain any more. Do I get the girl?"</p>

<p>There was murder in Matsuo's heart. But he chose to dissemble
his wrath until such time as Sokabe might meet an accidental death.
"I thought you were my friend," he said, "and now you turn against
me. Let us do nothing rash. The girl is nothing. Descendants of the
gods should not quarrel over such a low born creature. Let us leave
the matter to the decision of our colonel. He will be here to
inspect us soon." And before he gets here, thought Matsuo, an
accident will befall you.</p>

<p>"That is fair enough," agreed Sokabe. It will be most
unfortunate, he thought, should my captain die before the colonel
arrives.</p>

<p>The girl understood nothing that they said. She did not know
that for the time being she was safe.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Alam left the kampong to return to his
village.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">JERRY LUCAS was awakened by the violent shaking of
the platform. It awakened Bubonovitch and Rosetti, also. "Wot
fell!" exclaimed the latter.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch looked around. "I don't see anything."</p>

<p>Jerry leaned far out and looked up. He saw a huge black form a
few feet above him, violently shaking the tree.</p>

<p>"Cripes!" he exclaimed. "Do you guys see what I see?"</p>

<p>The other two looked up. "Geeze!" said Rosetti. "Wot a mug! I
never knew monkeys came dat big."</p>

<p>"That is not a monkey, you dope," said Bubonovitch. "It is known
as Pongo pygmaeus, but why the pygmaeus I have not pursued my
studies far enough to ascertain. It should be Pongo giganteum."</p>

<p>"Talk United States," growled Shrimp.</p>

<p>"It's an orangutan, Shrimp," said Lucas.</p>

<p>"From the Malay 'oran-utan,' meaning wild man," added
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"What does it want?" inquired Shrimp. "Wot in 'ell 's it shakin'
the tree like dat for? Tryin' to shake us out? Geeze! wot a mug. Is
he a man eater, Perfesser Bubonovitch?"</p>

<p>"He is chiefly herbivorous," replied Bubonovitch. Rosetti turned
to Lucas.</p>

<p>"Do monks eat people, Cap?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Lucas. "Just leave 'em alone, and they'll leave
you alone. But don't get fresh with that baby. He could take you
apart like nobody's business."</p>

<p>Shrimp was examining his .45. "He ain't a-goin' to take me
apart, not while I got Big Bertha here."</p>

<p>The orangutan, having satisfied his curiosity, moved slowly off.
Shrimp started stripping his .45. "Geeze! It's started to rust
already, just like&mdash;" He looked around. "Say! Where's the
dook?"</p>

<p>"Cripes! He's gone," said Lucas. "I never noticed."</p>

<p>"Maybe he fell off," suggested Rosetti, peering over the edge.
"He wasn't a bad guy fer a Britisher."</p>

<p>"That's sure some concession, coming from you," said
Bubonovitch. "Do you know, Cap'n, Shrimp wouldn't play billiards
even for fear he might have to put English on the cue ball."</p>

<p>Shrimp sat up suddenly and looked at the others. "I just
happened to think," he said. "Did either of youse hear dat scream
last night?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Lucas. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"It sounded like some one bein' kilt. Didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it did sound sort of human."</p>

<p>"Sure. Dat's it. The dook fell off an' a tiger got 'im. That was
him screamin'."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch pointed. "Here comes his ghost."</p>

<p>The others looked. "Fer Pete's sake!" said Rosetti. "Wot a
guy!"</p>

<p>Swinging through the trees toward them, the carcass of a deer
slung over one shoulder, was the Englishman. He swung onto the
platform. "Here's breakfast," he said. "Go to it."</p>

<p>Dropping the carcass, he drew his knife and hacked out a
generous portion. Tearing the skin from the flesh with powerful
fingers, he squatted in a far corner of the platform and sank his
strong teeth into the raw flesh. Shrimp's jaw dropped and his eyes
went wide. "Ain't you goin' to cook it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What with?" inquired Clayton. "There's nothing around here dry
enough to burn. If you want meat, you'll have to learn to eat it
raw until we can find a permanent camp and get something that will
burn."</p>

<p>"Well," said Shrimp, "I guess I'm hungry enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll try anything once," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Jerry Lucas hacked off a small piece and started to chew it.
Clayton watched the three men chewing on bits of the warm raw meat.
"That's not the way to eat it," he said. "Tear off pieces you can
swallow, and then swallow them whole. Don't chew."</p>

<p>"How did youse learn all dis?" inquired Rosetti.</p>

<p>"From the lions."</p>

<p>Rosetti glanced at the others, shook his head, and then tried to
swallow too large a piece of venison. He gagged and choked.
"Geeze!" he said, after he had disgorged the morsel, "I never went
to school to no lions." But after that he did better.</p>

<p>"It's not so bad when you swallow it whole," admitted Lucas.</p>

<p>"And it fills your belly and gives you strength," said
Clayton.</p>

<p>He swung into the next tree and got more durian fruit. They ate
it now with relish. "After dis," said Shrimp, "there ain't nuthin'
I can't eat."</p>

<p>"I passed a stream near here," said Clayton. "We can drink
there. I think we'd better get started. We've got to do some
reconnoitering before we can make any definite plans. You might
take some of this meat along in your pockets if you think you'll be
hungry again soon. But there's plenty of game everywhere. We won't
go hungry."</p>

<p>No one wanted to take any of the meat; so Clayton tossed the
carcass to the ground. "For Stripes," he said.</p>

<p>The sun was shining, and the forest teemed with life.
Bubonovitch was in his element. Here were animals and birds he had
studied about in books, or whose dead and mounted frames he had
seen in museums. And there were many that he had neither seen nor
heard of. "A regular museum of natural history on the hoof," he
said.</p>

<p>Clayton had led them to the stream, and after they had quenched
their thirsts he guided them to a well marked game trail he had
discovered while hunting for their breakfast. It wound downward in
the direction he and Lucas had decided they would take&mdash;toward
the west coast, many, many long marches away.</p>

<p>"There have been no men along this trail recently," said
Clayton, "but there have been many other animals&mdash;elephant,
rhinos, tigers, deer. It was on this trail that I found our
breakfast."</p>

<p>Shrimp wanted to ask how he had caught the deer, but realized
that he had recently been altogether too familiar with a Britisher.
Probably a friend of George Toid, he thought, and winced. It curled
his hair to think what the mob would say could they know of it.
Still, he had to admit that the guy wasn't a bad guy, even though
he hated to admit it.</p>

<p>They were moving up wind, and Clayton paused and raised a
warning hand. "There is a man ahead of us," he said in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"I don't see no one," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Clayton, "but he's there." He stood still
for a few minutes. "He's going the same way we are," he said. "I'll
go ahead and have a look at him. The rest of you come along
slowly." He swung into a tree and disappeared ahead.</p>

<p>"You can't see no one, you can't hear no one; and this guy tells
us there's a guy ahead of us&mdash;and w'ich way he's goin'!"
Rosetti looked appealingly at Lucas.</p>

<p>"He hasn't been wrong yet," said Jerry.</p>

<p>Sing Tai did not die. The Jap bayonet inflicted a cruel wound,
but pierced no vital organ. For two days Sing Tai lay in a welter
of blood, deep hidden in his cave. Then he crawled out. Suffering
from shock, weak from loss of blood and lack of food and water,
often on the verge of fainting from pain, he staggered slowly along
the trail toward the village of Tiang Umar. Orientals are more
easily resigned to death than are Occidentals, so greatly do their
philosophies differ. But Sing Tai would not die. While there was
hope that his beloved mistress might live and need him, he, too,
must live.</p>

<p>In the village of Tiang Umar he might get word of her. Then he
might be able to determine whether to live or die. So Sing Tai's
loyal heart beat on, however weakly. Yet there were moments when he
wondered if he would have the strength to carry on to the village.
Such thoughts were depressing him when he was startled to see an
almost naked giant appear suddenly in the trail before him&mdash;a
bronzed giant with black hair and gray eyes. This, perhaps, is the
end, thought Sing Tai.</p>

<p>Clayton had dropped into the trail from an overhanging tree. He
spoke to Sing Tai in English, and Sing Tai replied in English which
had just a trace of pidgin. In Hong Kong, Sing Tai had lived for
years in the homes of Englishmen.</p>

<p>Clayton saw the blood soaked garments and noted the outward
signs of weakness that seemed to verge on collapse. "How you get
hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Jap monkey-man run bayonet through me&mdash;here." He indicated
the spot in his side.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Clayton, and Sing Tai told his story.</p>

<p>"Are there Japs near here?"</p>

<p>"Me no think so."</p>

<p>"How far is this village you are trying to reach?"</p>

<p>"Not very far now&mdash;maybe so one kilometer."</p>

<p>"Are the people of that village friendly to the Japanese?"</p>

<p>"No. Very much hate Japs."</p>

<p>Clayton's companions appeared now from around a curve in the
trail. "You see," said Lucas. "Right again."</p>

<p>"That guy is always right," muttered Shrimp, "but I don't see
how he done it&mdash;not with no glass ball nor nuthin'."</p>

<p>"Not even with the aid of mirrors," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Sing Tai looked at them apprehensively as they approached. "They
are my friends," said Clayton&mdash;"American aviators."</p>

<p>"Melicans!" breathed Sing Tai with a sigh of relief. "Now I know
we save missie."</p>

<p>Clayton repeated Sing Tai's story to the others, and it was
decided that they should go on to Tiang Umar's village. Clayton
gathered the Chinese gently into his arms and carried him along the
trail. When Sing Tai said that they were near the village, the
Englishman put him down, and told them all to wait while he went
ahead to investigate. The Jap detachment might still be there. It
was not, and he soon returned.</p>

<p>Tiang Umar received them well when Sing Tai had explained who
they were. With Sing Tai acting as interpreter, Tiang Umar told
them that the Japs had left the previous morning, taking the Dutch
girl and one of his young men with them. What was their
destination, he did not know. He knew that there was a Jap camp one
day's march to the southwest. Perhaps they had gone to that camp.
If they would wait in his kampong, he was sure that the youth,
Alam, would return, as the Japs had taken him along only to act as
interpreter in the villages they might pass through.</p>

<p>They decided to wait. Clayton was especially anxious to; and
when it was decided, he went off into the forest alone. "He'll
probably come back wit' one of them there water buffalo under his
arm," predicted Shrimp. But when he came back he had only some
tough and slender branches and some bamboo. With these and some
chicken feathers and fiber cord given him by Tiang Umar, he
fashioned a bow, some arrows and a spear. The tips of his weapons
he fire hardened. With parachute silk, he made a quiver.</p>

<p>His companions watched with interest. Rosetti was not greatly
impressed when Clayton explained that his armament would serve not
only to ensure them plenty of game but as weapons of defense and
offense against men. "Do we hold de game w'ile he shoots at it?" he
asked Bubonovitch. "Say, an' if any guy ever pricked me wid one of
dem t'ings, an' I found it out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be corny," said Bubonovitch. But weapons, to Rosetti,
meant .45s, tommy guns, machine guns, not slivers of bamboo with
chicken feathers at one end.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, Alam returned. He was immediately
surrounded by a crowd of jabbering natives. Sing Tai finally got
his story and retold it to Clayton. Alam knew that the two Jap
officers had quarreled over the girl and that she was still safe at
the time he had left the village that morning.</p>

<p>Sing Tai, with tears in his eyes, begged Clayton to rescue
Corrie from the Japs. Clayton and the Americans discussed the
matter. All were in favor of the attempt, but not all for the same
reasons. Clayton and Bubonovitch wished to save the girl. Lucas and
Rosetti wished to discomfit the Japs.</p>

<p>They were little interested in the girl, both being misogynists.
Lucas was a woman hater because the girl he had left behind in
Oklahoma City had married a 4-F two months after Jerry had gone
overseas. Rosetti's hatred of them stemmed from his lifelong hatred
of his mother. Early the following morning they set out, guided by
Alam.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THEY moved slowly and cautiously, Clayton
reconnoitering ahead of the others. Shrimp didn't see why they had
brought Alam, and was sure that they would become lost. In a weird
sign language of his own invention, he was constantly asking Alam
if they were on the right trail. The native, not having the
slightest idea what Shrimp's wild gesticulating meant, nodded and
smiled as soon as Rosetti started to point and grimace.</p>

<p>Lucas and Bubonovitch were not as much concerned as Shrimp. They
had more confidence in the Englishman than he. However, they could
not know that Clayton needed no guide to show him the trail of a
detachment of soldiers accompanied by a white girl and a native
youth. Everywhere along the trail the signs of their recent passage
were obvious to his trained senses.</p>

<p>It was dark when they approached the village. Clayton had the
others wait while he went ahead to investigate. He found the
village poorly guarded and entered it with ease. The night was
moonless and clouds hid the stars. There were dim lights in a few
of the houses. Conditions were ideal for the furtherance of the
plan Clayton had worked out.</p>

<p>Close to the point at which he had entered his keen sense of
smell located the white girl. He heard the angry jabbering of two
Japs in the house with her. They would be the two officers still
quarreling over her.</p>

<p>He left the village at the same point at which he had entered it
and passed around it to its lower end. There was a sentry here.
Clayton did not wish any sentry at this point. The fellow patrolled
back and forth. Clayton crouched behind a tree, waiting. The sentry
approached. Something leaped upon him from behind; and before he
could voice a cry of warning, a keen blade bit deep into his
throat.</p>

<p>Clayton dragged the corpse out of the village, and returned to
his companions. He whispered instructions; then he led them to the
lower end of the village. "Your .45s," he had said, "will probably
fire the cartridges that are in the chambers. The chances are that
the mechanisms are so rusted by this time that they will not eject
the shell nor reload, but fire as long as they will fire. When they
jam, throw rocks into the village to keep attention attracted in
this direction. And all the while, yell like hell. Start this in
three minutes. In four minutes, get out of there and get out quick.
We'll rendezvous on the back trail above the village. Keep your
watch dial hidden from the village, Captain." Then he was gone.</p>

<p>He returned to the upper end of the village and hid beneath the
house in which were the two officers and the girl. A minute later,
shots rang out at the lower end of the village and loud yells
shattered the silence of the night. Clayton grinned. It sounded as
though a strong force were attacking the village.</p>

<p>A second later the two officers ran from the house, screaming
orders, demanding explanations. Soldiers swarmed from other houses
and all ran in the direction of the disturbance. Then Clayton ran
up the ladder that led to the doorway of the house and entered. The
girl lay on sleeping mats at the rear of the single room. Her
wrists and ankles were bound.</p>

<p>She saw this almost naked man cross the floor toward her at a
run. He stooped down and gathered her in his arms, carried her from
the house and out into the jungle. She was terrified. What new
horror awaited her?</p>

<p>In the dim light within the room, she had only seen that the man
was tall and that his skin was brown. Out along a jungle trail he
bore her for a short distance. Then he halted and put her down. She
felt something cold press against her wrists&mdash;and her hands
were free. Then the cords around her ankles were cut.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she demanded in Dutch.</p>

<p>"Quiet!" he cautioned.</p>

<p>Presently, four others joined them; and they all moved in
silence with her along the dark trail. Who were they? What did they
want of her? The one word, "quiet," spoken in English had partially
reassured her. At least they were not Japs.</p>

<p>For an hour they moved on in unbroken silence, Clayton
constantly alert for sounds of pursuit. But none developed. At last
he spoke. "I think we confused them," he said. "If they are
searching, it is probably in the other direction."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Corrie, this time in English.</p>

<p>"Friends," replied Clayton. "Sing Tai told us about you. So we
came and got you."</p>

<p>"Sing Tai is not dead?"</p>

<p>"No, but badly wounded."</p>

<p>Alam spoke to her then and reassured her. "You are safe now," he
said. "I have heard that Americans can do anything. Now I believe
it."</p>

<p>"These are Americans?" she asked incredulously. "Have they
landed at last?"</p>

<p>"Only these few. Their plane was shot down."</p>

<p>"That was a pretty cute trick, Colonel," said Bubonovitch. "It
certainly fooled them."</p>

<p>"It came near doing worse than that to me, because I forgot to
caution you as to the direction of your fire. Two bullets came
rather too close to me for comfort." He turned to the girl. "Do you
feel strong enough to walk the rest of the night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite," she replied. "You see I am used to walking. I have
been doing a lot of it for the past two years, keeping out of the
way of the Japs."</p>

<p>"For two years?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ever since the invasion. I have been hiding in the
mountains all this time, Sing Tai and I." Clayton drew her out, and
she told her story&mdash;the flight from the plantation, the death
of her mother, the murder of her father and Lum Kam, the treachery
of some natives, the loyalty of others.</p>

<p>They reached the village of Tiang Umar at dawn, but they
remained there only long enough to get food; then they moved on,
all but Alam. A plan had been worked out during the night. It was
based on the belief that the Japs would eventually return to this
village to look for the girl. Furthermore Corrie wished to have
nothing done that would jeopardize the safety of these people who
had befriended her.</p>

<p>Corrie and Sing Tai knew of many hiding places in the remote
fastnesses of the mountains. They had been forced to move closer to
Tiang Umar's village because of their inability to get proper or
sufficient food for themselves in these safer locations. But now it
would be different. The Americans could do anything.</p>

<p>They had been forced to leave Sing Tai behind, as he was in no
condition to travel. Tiang Umar assured them that he could hide the
Chinese where the Japs could not find him if they should return to
the village.</p>

<p>"If I can, I shall let you know where I am, Tiang Umar," said
Corrie; "then, perhaps, you will send Sing Tai to me when he is
strong enough to travel."</p>

<p>Corrie led the party deep into the wilds of the mountain
hinterland. Here there were rugged gorges and leaping streams,
forests of teak, huge stands of bamboo, open mountain meadows man
deep with tough grasses.</p>

<p>Lucas and Clayton had decided to go thus deeper into the
mountains and then cut to the southeast before turning toward the
coast. In this way they would avoid the area in which the plane had
crashed, where the Japs had probably already instituted a thorough
search. They would also encounter few if any villages whose
inhabitants might put Japs upon their trail.</p>

<p>Clayton often foraged ahead for food, always returning with
something. It might be partridge or pheasant, sometimes deer. And
now at their camps he made fire, so that the Americans could cook
their food.</p>

<p>On the trail, Clayton and Corrie always led the way, then came
Bubonovitch, with Lucas and Shrimp bringing up the rear, keeping as
far away from the Dutch girl as possible. They were unreconciled to
the presence of a woman. It was not so much that Corrie might
jeopardize their chances to escape. It was just that they objected
to women on general principles.</p>

<p>"But I suppose we gotta put up wit' de dame," said Rosetti. "We
can't leaf the Japs get her."</p>

<p>Jerry Lucas agreed. "If she were a man, or even a monkey, it
wouldn't be so bad. But I just plain don't have any time for
women."</p>

<p>"Some dame double-cross you?" asked Shrimp.</p>

<p>"I could have forgiven her throwing me over for a 4-F as soon as
I was out of sight," said Jerry, "but the so-and-so was a
Republican into the bargain."</p>

<p>"She ain't hard to look at," conceded Shrimp, grudgingly.</p>

<p>"They're the worst," said Jerry. "Utterly selfish and greedy.
Always gouging some one. Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! That's all they think
of. If you ever decide to marry, Shrimp," advised Jerry,
pedantically, "marry an old bag who'd be grateful to any one for
marrying her."</p>

<p>"Who wants to marry an old bag?" demanded Shrimp.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to worry about wolves."</p>

<p>"Whoever marries dis little Dutch number'll have plenty to worry
about. All de wolves in de woods'll be howlin' round his back door.
Ever notice dem lamps w'en she smiles?"</p>

<p>"You falling for her, Shrimp?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no; but I got eyes, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"I never look at her," lied Jerry.</p>

<p>Just then a covey of partridges broke cover. Clayton already had
an arrow fitted to his bow. Instantly the string twanged and a
partridge fell. The man's movements were as swift and sure and
smooth as the passage of light.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Rosetti. "I give. The guy's not human.
Howinell did he know them boids was goin' to bust out? How could he
hit 'em with dat t'ing?"</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head. "Search me. He probably smelled 'em, or
heard 'em. Lots of the things he does are just plain uncanny."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to learn to shoot one of dem t'ings," said
Shrimp.</p>

<p>Presently, Rosetti overcame his Anglophobia sufficiently to
permit him to ask Clayton to show him how to make a bow and arrows.
Lucas and Bubonovitch expressed a similar desire. The next day
Clayton gathered the necessary materials, and they all set to work
under his guidance to fashion weapons, even Corrie.</p>

<p>The Dutch girl braided the bow strings from fibers from the long
tough grasses they found in open spaces in the mountains. Clayton
shot birds for the feathers, and taught the others how properly to
fletch their arrows. The fashioning of the weapons was a pleasant
interlude to long days of scaling cliffs, battling through jungle
undergrowth, marching down one declivity only to climb up once more
to descend another. It was the first time that the five had had any
protracted social intercourse, for after each hard day's march
their greatest need had been sleep.</p>

<p>The Dutch girl sat near Jerry Lucas. He watched her nimble
fingers braiding the fibers, and thought that she had pretty
hands&mdash;small and well shaped. He noticed, too, that
notwithstanding two years of bitter hardships she still gave
attention to her nails. He glanced at his own, ruefully. Somehow,
she always looked trim and neat. How she accomplished it was beyond
him.</p>

<p>"It will be fun to hunt with these," she said to him in her
precise, almost Oxford English.</p>

<p>"If we can hit anything," he replied. She speaks better English
than I, he thought.</p>

<p>"We must practice a great deal," she said. "It is not right that
we four grown-up people should be dependent upon Colonel Clayton
for everything, as though we were little children."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Is he not wonderful?"</p>

<p>Jerry mumbled a "Yes," and went on with his work. With awkward,
unaccustomed fingers he was trying to fletch an arrow. He wished
the girl would keep still. He wished she were in Halifax. Why did
there have to be girls around to spoil a man's world?</p>

<p>Corrie glanced up at him, puzzled. Her eyes reflected it. Then
she noticed his awkward attempts to hold a feather in place and
fasten it there with a bit of fiber. "Here," she said. "Let me help
you. You hold the feather and I'll bind the fiber around the shaft.
Hold it close in the groove. There, that's right." Her hands,
passing the fiber around the arrow, often touched his. He found the
contact pleasant; and because he found it so, it made him
angry.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, almost rudely, "I can do this myself. You need
not bother."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, surprised. Then she went back to braiding
the bow strings. She did not say anything, but in that brief glance
when their eyes had met he had seen surprise and hurt in hers. He
had seen the same once in a deer he had shot, and he had never
again shot a deer.</p>

<p>You're a damned heel, he thought of himself. Then, with a great
effort of will power, he said, "I am sorry. I did not mean to be
rude."</p>

<p>"You do not like me," she said. "Why? Have I done something to
offend you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. And what makes you think I don't like you?"</p>

<p>"It has been quite obvious. The little sergeant does not like
me, either. Sometimes I catch him looking at me as though he would
like to bite off my head."</p>

<p>"Some men are shy around women," he said.</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "Not you," she said.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment. Then he said, "Would you mind
helping me again? I am terribly awkward at this."</p>

<p>Corrie thought, "He is a gentleman, after all."</p>

<p>Again she bound the feathers fast while he held them in place.
And their hands touched. Chagrined, Jerry found himself moving his
so that they would touch oftener.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MUCH time was devoted to archery even on the
march. Corrie shamed the men. She was very quick and very accurate,
and she drew a strong bow&mdash;the full length of a two foot,
eight inch arrow until the feathers touched her right ear.</p>

<p>Clayton complimented her. Shrimp told Bubonovitch that it was a
sissy sport anyway. Jerry secretly admired her prowess and was
ashamed of himself for admiring it. He tried to concentrate on the
girl in Oklahoma City and the Republican 4-F.</p>

<p>Corrie explained that she had belonged to an archery club for
two years in Holland while there at school, and that she had kept
up the practice after she returned to her father's plantation. "If
I were not good at it by this time, I should think myself very
stupid."</p>

<p>Eventually, even Shrimp commenced to brag about his
marksmanship. They were all pretty good, and woe betide any game
bird or animal that crossed their path. They had found a couple of
dry caves in a limestone cliff, and Clayton had decided that they
should remain there until some new clothing and footwear could be
fashioned, for their shoes were practically gone and their clothing
in shreds.</p>

<p>The Englishman had roughly cured a deer skin, and had fashioned
an awl and needles from bamboo. With the same tough fiber used for
their bows and arrows, Corrie was making crude sandals for them
with these materials and tools.</p>

<p>She worked alone one morning while the men went out to hunt. Her
thoughts ranged over the two years that had passed&mdash;years of
sorrow, hardship, and danger. Years of pain and unshed tears and
hate. She thought of her present situation&mdash;alone in the
vastness of a mountain wilderness with four strange men, four
foreigners. And she realized that she had never felt safer and that
for the first time in two years she was happy.</p>

<p>She smiled when she thought of how terrified she had been when
that almost naked brown man had carried her off into the forest.
And how surprised she had been when she learned that he was a Royal
Air Force colonel. She had liked him and Sergeant Bubonovitch from
the very beginning. Her heart had warmed to the sergeant from the
moment that he had shown her the pictures of his wife and baby. She
had not liked "the little sergeant" nor Captain Lucas. They are
both boors, she had thought; but the captain is the worst because
he is an educated man and should know better than to behave toward
me as he has.</p>

<p>That was what she had thought until lately, but since the day
that she had helped him fletch his arrows he had been different. He
still did not seek her company, but he did not avoid her as he had
in the past. Bubonovitch had told her what a fine pilot he was and
how his crew worshiped him. He cited several examples of Lucas'
courage, and they lost nothing in the telling. Crew members are
that way if they like an officer.</p>

<p>So Corrie concluded that Lucas was a man's man and possibly a
woman hater. And she found the latter idea intriguing. It was also
amusing. She smiled as she thought of how a woman hater must feel
in such a situation&mdash;forced into close companionship with a
woman day after day. And a young and pretty woman, she added
mentally. For Corrie was eighteen, and she knew that she was even
more than pretty&mdash;even in rags and with that horrid head of
hair, mostly a rusty black, but blonde at the roots. She had no
mirror, but she had seen her reflection in still pools of water.
That always made her laugh. She laughed easily and often these
days, for she was strangely happy.</p>

<p>She wondered if Captain Lucas would have disliked her if they
had met under normal conditions&mdash;she with lovely gowns and her
beautiful, golden hair becomingly arranged. Had she been given to
self-analysis, she would probably have wondered also why he was so
much in her thoughts. Of course he was good-looking in an extremely
masculine way.</p>

<p>She thought of him as old, and would have been surprised to have
learned that he was only twenty-three. Responsibility and many
hours of intense nervous strain had matured him rapidly. To hurl
thirty tons of aluminum and steel and high explosives into the air
and into battle, to feel that upon you alone depends the safety of
a beautiful, half-million dollars worth of plane and the lives of
nine of your best friends is sufficient responsibility to bring
lines of maturity to any face. They had left their mark on Jerry
Lucas's. Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of voices. At
first she assumed that the hunters were returning. Then, as the
sounds came nearer, she recognized the intonation of native speech;
and a moment later several Sumatrans appeared in the mouth of the
cave. They were ugly, vicious looking men. There were ten of them.
They took her away with them. From their conversation she soon
learned why: the Japs had offered a reward for the capture of her
and Sing Tai.</p>

<p>The sun was setting when the hunters returned to the cave. The
brief equatorial twilight would soon be followed by darkness. The
men missed the girl immediately and commenced to speculate on the
explanation.</p>

<p>"She probably run out on us," said Shrimp. "You can't trust no
dame."</p>

<p>"Don't be a damn fool," snapped Lucas. Shrimp's jaw dropped in
surprise. He had been sure that the captain would agree with him.
"Why should she run out on us?" demanded Lucas. "We offer her the
only chance she has to escape the Japs. She probably went
hunting."</p>

<p>"What makes you think she has run away from us, Rosetti?" asked
Clayton, who was examining the ground just outside of the cave
entrance.</p>

<p>"I know skoits," said Shrimp.</p>

<p>"I'd want better evidence than that," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't go hunting," said Bubonovitch from the back of
the cave.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Lucas.</p>

<p>"Her bow and arrows are here."</p>

<p>"No, she didn't go hunting and she didn't run away," said
Clayton. "She was taken away by force by a band of natives. There
were about ten men in the band. They went that way." He
pointed.</p>

<p>"You got a crystal ball, Colonel?" asked Bubonovitch
skeptically.</p>

<p>"I have something more dependable&mdash;two eyes and a nose. So
have you men, but yours are no good. They have been dulled by
generations of soft living, of having laws and police and soldiers
to surround you with safeguards."</p>

<p>"And how about you, Colonel?" asked Lucas banteringly.</p>

<p>"I have survived simply because my senses are as acute as those
of my enemies&mdash;usually far more acute&mdash;and are combined
with experience and intelligence to safeguard me where there are no
laws, no police, no soldiers."</p>

<p>"Like in London," observed Bubonovitch. Clayton only smiled.</p>

<p>"What makes you sure she didn't go with the natives willingly?"
asked Jerry Lucas. "She might have had some good reason that we, of
course, can't know anything about. But I certainly don't believe
that she deserted us."</p>

<p>"She was taken by force after a very brief struggle. The signs
are plain on the ground. You can see here where she held back and
was dragged along a few feet. Then her tracks disappear. They
picked her up and carried her. The stink of natives clings to the
grasses."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we waiting for then?" demanded Lucas. "Let's get
going."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Shrimp. "Let's get after the dirty so-and-sos. They
can't take&mdash;" He stopped suddenly, surprised by the strange
reaction the abduction of the hated "dame" had wrought.</p>

<p>It had started to rain&mdash;a sudden tropical deluge. Clayton
stepped into the shelter of the cave. "There is no use in starting
now," he said. "This rain will obliterate the scent spoor, and we
couldn't follow the visible spoor in the dark. They will have to
lie up somewhere for the night. Natives don't like to travel after
dark on account of the big cats. So they won't gain on us. We can
leave immediately it is light enough in the morning for me to see
the trail."</p>

<p>"The poor kid," said Jerry Lucas.</p>

<p>The moment that it was light enough to see, they were off to
track down Corrie's abductors. The Americans saw no sign of any
spoor, but to the habituated eyes of the Englishman it ran clear
and true. He saw where they had put Corrie down a short distance
from the cave and made her walk.</p>

<p>It was midmorning when Clayton stopped and sniffed the breeze
that blew gently from the direction from which they had come.
"You'd better take to the trees," he said to the others. "There's a
tiger coming down the trail behind us. He's not very far away."</p>

<p><br><br>Corrie's abductors had camped at the edge of a mountain meadow
as darkness approached. They built a fire to keep the great cats
away, and huddled close to it, leaving one man on guard to tend
it.</p>

<p>Tired, the girl slept for several hours. When she awoke, she saw
that the fire was out and knew that the guard must have fallen
asleep. She realized that now she might escape. She looked toward
the dark, forbidding forest&mdash;just a solid blank of blackness.
But in it lurked possible death. In the other direction, the
direction in which these men were taking her, lay something worse
than death. She balanced the certainty against the possibility and
reached her decision quickly.</p>

<p>Silently she arose. The guard lay stretched beside the ashes of
the dead fire. She passed around him and the others. A moment later
she entered the forest. Though the trail was worn deep it was
difficult to follow it in the darkness; and she made slow progress,
often stumbling. But she went on, that she might put as much
distance between herself and her captors as possible before
daylight, being certain that they would follow her.</p>

<p>She was frightened. The forest was full of sound&mdash;stealthy,
menacing sound. And any one of them might be the footsteps or the
wings of Death. Yet she felt her way on, deeper and deeper into the
impenetrable gloom until she heard a sound that turned her blood
cold&mdash;the cough of a tiger. And then she heard it crashing
through the undergrowth as though it had caught her scent or heard
her.</p>

<p>She groped to the side of the trail, her hands outstretched. She
prayed that she might find a tree she could scale. A hanging vine
struck her in the face as she blundered into it. She seized it and
started to climb. The crashing of the beast's body through the
tangle of shrubbery sounded closer. Corrie clawed her way upward.
From below came a series of hideous growls as the tiger sprang. The
impact of his body nearly tore the vine from her grasp, but terror
and desperation lent her strength.</p>

<p>Once more the vine swayed violently as the beast sprang again,
but now the girl knew that it could not reach her if the vine held.
There lay the danger. Twice more the tiger sprang, but at last
Corrie reached one of the lower branches&mdash;a leafy sanctuary at
least from the great cats. But there were other menaces in the
jungle that could range far above the ground. The most fearsome of
these was the python.</p>

<p>The carnivore remained beneath the tree for some time.
Occasionally it growled. At last the girl heard it move away. She
considered descending and continuing her flight. She was sure that
Clayton at least would search for her, but he could do nothing
until daylight. She thought of Jerry Lucas. Even if he did not like
her, he would probably help in the search for her&mdash;not because
she was Corrie van der Meer, but because she was a woman. And of
course Bubonovitch would come, and the little sergeant might be
shamed into it.</p>

<p>She decided to wait until daylight. Sometimes Stripes hunted in
the daytime, but most usually at night. And this was what the
Malays called tiger weather&mdash;a dark, starless, misty
night.</p>

<p>Eventually the long night ended, and Corrie clambered down into
the trail and continued her interrupted flight. She moved swiftly
now.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the branches of a tree that overhung the
trail, the survivors of Lovely Lady waited for the tiger to pass
and permit them to descend. They had no intention of interfering
with his passage. The Americans assured one another that they had
not lost a tiger, and grinned as though the remark was
original.</p>

<p>They had accompanied Clayton into trees so many times that
Shrimp said he expected to sprout a tail most any time. "That's all
you need," Bubonovitch assured him.</p>

<p>Around them were the ordinary daylight sounds of the forest, to
which they were now so accustomed&mdash;the raucous cries of birds,
the terrific booming of siamang gibbons, the chattering of the
lesser simians&mdash;but no sound came from the tiger. Shrimp
decided that it was a false alarm.</p>

<p>Below them, not more than a hundred feet of the trail was
visible between two turnings&mdash;about fifty feet in each
direction. Suddenly the tiger appeared, slouching along
loose-jointed and slab-sided, noiseless on his cushioned pads.
Simultaneously a slender figure came into view around the opposite
turning. It was Corrie. Both the tiger and the girl stopped, facing
one another less than a hundred feet apart. The tiger voiced a low
growl and started forward at a trot. Corrie seemed frozen with
horror. For an instant she did not move. And in that instant she
saw an almost naked man drop from above onto the back of the
carnivore. And following him instantly, three other men dropped to
the trail, jerking knives from their sheaths as they ran toward the
man battling with the great cat. And first among them was S/Sgt.
Rosetti, the British hater.</p>

<p>A steel thewed arm encircled the tiger's neck, mightily muscled
legs were locked around its groin, and the man's free arm was
driving a keen blade deep into the beast's left side. Growls of
fury rumbled from the savage throat of the great cat as it threw
itself about in agony and rage. And, to Corrie's horror, mingled
with them were equally savage growls that rumbled from the throat
of the man. Incredulous, the three Americans watched the brief
battle between the two&mdash;two jungle beasts&mdash;powerless to
strike a blow for the man because of the wild leapings and turnings
of the stricken tiger.</p>

<p>But what seemed a long time to them was a matter of seconds
only. The tiger's great frame went limp and sank to the ground. And
the man rose and put a foot upon it and, raising his face to the
heavens, voiced a horrid cry&mdash;the victory cry of the bull ape.
Corrie was suddenly terrified of this man who had always seemed so
civilized and cultured. Even the men were shocked.</p>

<p>Suddenly recognition lighted the eyes of Jerry Lucas. "John
Clayton," he said, "Lord Greystoke&mdash;Tarzan of the Apes!"</p>

<p>Shrimp's jaw dropped. "Is dat Johnny Weissmuller?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head as though to clear his brain of an
obsession. His thin veneer of civilization had been consumed by the
fires of battle. For the moment he had reverted to the savage
primordial beast that he had been raised. But he was almost
instantly his second self again.</p>

<p>He welcomed Corrie with a smile. "So you got away from them," he
said.</p>

<p>Corrie nodded. She was still shaken and trembling, and almost on
the verge of tears&mdash;tears of relief and thanksgiving. "Yes, I
got away from them last night; but if it hadn't been for you, it
wouldn't have done me much good, would it?"</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that we happened to be at the right place at
the right time. You had better sit down for a while. You look all
in."</p>

<p>"I am." She sat down at the edge of the trail, and the four men
gathered around her. Jerry Lucas beamed with pleasure and relief.
Even Shrimp was happy about it all.</p>

<p>"I'm sure glad you're back, Miss," he said. Then, when he
realized what he had said, he turned red. Shrimp's psyche had
recently received terrific jolts. A couple of lifelong phobias were
being knocked into a cocked hat. He had come to admire an
Englishman and to like a dame.</p>

<p>Corrie told them of her capture and escape, and she and the
Americans discussed the killing of the tiger. "Weren't you afraid?"
she asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Tarzan, who had never been afraid in his life, only cautious,
was always at a loss to answer this question, which had been put to
him many times before. He simply did not know what fear was.</p>

<p>"I knew I could kill the beast," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought you were crazy when I saw you drop on it," said
Bubonovitch. "I was sure scared."</p>

<p>"But you came down just the same to help me, all of you. If you
thought you might be killed doing it, that was true bravery."</p>

<p>"Why haven't you told us you were Tarzan?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"What difference could it have made?"</p>

<p>"We were sure dumb not to have recognized you long ago," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Corrie said that she could go on. The men gathered the bows they
had flung aside when they dropped to the ground, and they started
back toward their camp. "Funny none of us thought to shoot it wit'
arrows," said Shrimp.</p>

<p>"They would only have infuriated it," said Tarzan. "Of course,
if you got one through his heart that would kill a tiger; but he
would live long enough to do a terrible lot of damage. Many a
hunter has been mauled by lions after sending a large caliber
bullet through its heart. These great cats are amazingly tenacious
of life."</p>

<p>"To be mauled by a lion or tiger must be a terrible way to die,"
said Corrie, shuddering.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it would seem to be a rather nice way to
die&mdash;if one had to die," said Tarzan. "A number of men who had
been mauled by lions and lived have recorded their sensations. They
were unanimous in declaring that they felt neither pain nor
fear."</p>

<p>"Dey can have it," said Shrimp. "I'll take a tommy gun for
mine."</p>

<p>Tarzan brought up the rear of the little column on the way back
to camp, that Usha the Wind might bring to his nostrils warning of
the approach of the Sumatrans, if they were pursuing Corrie, before
they came too close.</p>

<p>Shrimp walked beside him, watching his every move with admiring
eyes. To think, he said to himself, that I'd ever be runnin' around
in a jungle wit' Tarzan of de Apes. Bubonovitch had convinced him
that it was not Johnny Weissmuller. Jerry and Corrie led the way.
He walked just behind one of her shoulders. He could watch her
profile from that position. He found it a very nice profile to
watch. So nice that, though he tried, he couldn't conjure up the
likeness of the girl in Oklahoma City for any length of time. His
thoughts kept coming back to the profile.</p>

<p>"You must be very tired," he said. He was thinking that she had
walked this trail all the day before and all this day, with
practically no sleep.</p>

<p>"A little," she replied. "But I am used to walking. I am very
tough."</p>

<p>"We were frightened when we found you gone and Tarzan discovered
that you had been abducted."</p>

<p>She threw him a quick, quizzical glance. "And you a misogynist!"
she chided.</p>

<p>"Who said I was a misogynist?"</p>

<p>"Both you and the little sergeant."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you that, and Shrimp doesn't know what a
misogynist is."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that. I meant that you are both misogynists. No
one told me. It was quite obvious."</p>

<p>"Maybe I thought I was," he said. Then he told her about the
girl in Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>"And you love her so much?"</p>

<p>"I do not. I guess my pride was hurt. A man hates to be brushed
off."</p>

<p>"Brushed off? What is that?"</p>

<p>"Jilted&mdash;and for a Republican 4-F."</p>

<p>"Is that such a terrible person? I never heard of one
before."</p>

<p>Jerry laughed. "Really, no. But when you're mad you like to call
names, and I couldn't think of anything else. The fellow is really
all right. As a matter of fact I am commencing to love him."</p>

<p>"You mean that it is better to discover, before marriage, that
she is fickle rather than after?"</p>

<p>"We'll settle for that&mdash;for the time being. I just know
that I would not want her to be in love with me now."</p>

<p>Corrie thought that over. Whatever she deduced from it, she kept
to herself. When they reached camp a few minutes later, she was
humming a gay little tune.</p>

<p>After she had gone into the cave, Bubonovitch said to Jerry,
"How's the misogynist this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Shut your trap," said Jerry.</p>

<p>Tarzan, in questioning Corrie about her abductors, had
ascertained that there had been ten of them and that they were
armed with kris and parang. They carried no firearms, the Japs
having confiscated all such weapons as they could find.</p>

<p>The five were gathered at the mouth of the cave discussing plans
for the future, which included tactics in the event the tribesmen
returned and proved belligerent. Those who wished always had an
equal voice in these discussions; but since they had left the ship,
where Jerry's authority had been supreme, there had been a tacit
acknowledgment of Tarzan's position as leader. Jerry realized the
fitness of this. There had never been any question in his mind, nor
in the minds of the others, that the Englishman was better equipped
by knowledge and experience of the jungle, acute sense
perceptivity, and physical prowess to guide and protect them than
were any of the others. Even Shrimp had had to acknowledge this,
and at first that had been hard. Now he would have been one of the
Britisher's most ardent supporters had there been any
dissidents.</p>

<p>"Corrie tells me," said Tarzan, "that there are ten men in the
party that took her. Most of them, she says, are armed with a long
straight kris, not the wavy bladed type with which most of us are
familiar. They all carry parangs, a heavy knife designed more for
use as a tool than a weapon. They have no firearms."</p>

<p>"If they come, we shall have to stop them before they get to
close quarters. Corrie will act as interpreter. While they
outnumber us more than two to one, we should have no difficulty in
holding our own. We are four bows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Five," corrected Corrie.</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "We are five bows, and we are all good shots. We
shall try to convince them that they had better go away and leave
us alone. We shall not shoot until it is absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>"Nuts," said Shrimp. "We'd ought to let 'em have it for stealin'
de kid." Corrie gave him a look of surprise and incredulity. Jerry
and Bubonovitch grinned. Shrimp turned red.</p>

<p>"There goes another misogynist," Bubonovitch whispered to
Jerry.</p>

<p>"I know how you feel, Rosetti," said Tarzan. "I think we all
feel the same way. But years ago I learned to kill only for food
and defense. I learned it from what you call the beasts. I think it
is a good rule. Those who kill for any other reason, such as for
pleasure or revenge, debase themselves. They make savages of
themselves. I will tell you when to fire."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they won't come after all," said Corrie.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "They will come. They are almost
here."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Iskandar awoke the sun was shining full in
his face. He raised himself on an elbow. His eyes took in the scene
before him. His nine companions slept. The sentry slept beside a
dead fire. The captive was not there.</p>

<p>His cruel face distorted in rage, Iskandar seized his kris and
leaped to his feet. The shrieks of the sentry awakened the other
sleepers. "Pig!" screamed Iskandar, hacking at the head and body of
his victim as the man tried to crawl away from him on hands and
knees. "The tigers could have come and killed us all. And because
of you, the woman has escaped."</p>

<p>A final blow at the base of the brain, which severed the spinal
column, ended the torture. Iskandar wiped his bloody kris on the
garments of the dead man and turned his scowling face upon his men.
"Come!" he ordered. "She cannot have gotten far. Hurry!"</p>

<p>They soon picked up Corrie's footprints in the trail and hurried
in pursuit. Halfway along the trail to the cave where they had
captured her, they came upon the body of a tiger. Iskandar examined
it closely. He saw the knife wounds behind its left shoulder. He
saw many footprints in the muddy trail. There were those of the
girl and others made by the same crude type of sandal that she had
worn, but larger&mdash;the footprints of men. And there were prints
of the bare feet of a man. Iskandar was puzzled. There seemed ample
evidence that someone had stabbed the tiger to death. But that was
impossible. No one could have come within reach of those terrible
talons and jaws and lived.</p>

<p>They pushed on, and in the afternoon they came within sight of
the cave.</p>

<p>"Here they come," said Jerry Lucas.</p>

<p>"There are but four men," said Iskandar. "Kill the men, but do
not harm the woman." The nine tribesmen advanced confidently with
bared kris. Tarzan permitted them to approach within a hundred
feet; then he had Corrie address them. "Stop!" she said. "Do not
come any closer."</p>

<p>Each of the five had fitted an arrow to his bow. The left hand
of each held additional arrows. Iskandar laughed and gave the word
to charge. "Let them have it," said Tarzan, sending an arrow
through Iskandar's leg, dropping him. Four others were hit by that
first flight of arrows. Two of the others stopped, but two came on
yelling like demons. Tarzan drove an arrow through the heart of
each. They were too close to be spared as he had spared Iskandar.
So close that one of them fell almost touching Tarzan's feet.</p>

<p>He turned to Corrie. "Tell them that if they throw down their
weapons and put their hands up, we will not kill them."</p>

<p>After the girl had translated the instructions, the Sumatrans
grumbled sullenly; but they did not throw down their weapons nor
raise their hands.</p>

<p>"Fit arrows to your bows and advance slowly," ordered Tarzan.
"At the first threatening move, shoot to kill."</p>

<p>"You wait here, Corrie," said Jerry. "There may be a fight."</p>

<p>She smiled at him but ignored his directions; so he put himself
in front of her as they advanced. It was a long arrow that Tarzan
had fitted to his bow, a heavy bow that only Tarzan could draw. He
aimed the arrow at Iskandar's heart, and whispered to Corrie.</p>

<p>"He will count to ten," the girl explained to the Sumatran. "If
you have not all thrown down your weapons and raised your hands
before he finishes counting he will kill you. Then we will kill the
others."</p>

<p>Tarzan commenced to count, Corrie translating. At five, Iskandar
gave in. He had looked into the gray eyes of the giant standing
above him and he was afraid. The others followed the example of
their leader.</p>

<p>"Rosetti," said Tarzan, "gather up their weapons and retrieve
our arrows. We will keep them covered."</p>

<p>Rosetti gathered the weapons first; then he yanked the arrows
from the limbs and bodies of the five who had been hit but not
killed. With the dead he was more gentle.</p>

<p>"Tell them to take their dead and get out of here, Corrie. And
that if they ever annoy us again we will kill them all."</p>

<p>Corrie translated, adding a punch line of her own devising:
"This man who speaks to you through me is no ordinary man. Armed
only with a knife, he leaped upon the back of a tiger and killed
it. If you are wise, you will obey him."</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Corrie," said Jerry. "Ask them if they have seen
any American fliers recently who had bailed out of a damaged plane,
or heard of any."</p>

<p>Corrie put the question to Iskandar and received a sullen
negative. The chief got to his feet and gave orders to his men,
none of whom was seriously wounded. They picked up their dead and
started away, but Iskandar stopped them. Then he turned to Tarzan.
"You will let us take our weapons?" he asked. Corrie
translated.</p>

<p>"No." This seemed to need no translation or admit of argument.
The chief had looked again into the gray eyes of the giant who had
killed the tiger he had seen upon the trail, and what he had seen
there had frightened him. They are not the eyes of a man, he
thought. They are the eyes of a tiger.</p>

<p>Snarling a Malayan oath beneath his breath, he ordered his men
to march, and followed them.</p>

<p>"We'd orter have killed 'em all," said Shrimp. "They'll tell the
foist yellow-bellies they see where to find us."</p>

<p>"If we followed that plan to its logical conclusion," said
Tarzan, "we'd have to kill every human being we meet. Any of them
might tell the Japs."</p>

<p>"You don't believe much in killin' people." Tarzan shook his
head in negation.</p>

<p>"Not even Japs?"</p>

<p>"That is different. We are at war with them. Neither in hatred
nor revenge and with no particular pleasure I shall kill every Jap
I can until the war is over. That is my duty."</p>

<p>"Don't you even hate 'em?"</p>

<p>"What good would it do if I did? If all the many millions of
people of the allied nations devoted an entire year exclusively to
hating the Japs it wouldn't kill one Jap nor shorten the war one
day."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch laughed. "And it might give 'em all stomach
ulcers."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "I can recall having felt hatred but once in my
life or killing for revenge but once&mdash;Kulonga, the son of
Mbonga. He killed Kala, my foster mother. Not only was I very young
then, but Kala was the only creature in the world that loved me or
that I loved. And I thought then that she was my own mother. I have
never regretted the killing."</p>

<p>While they talked, Corrie was cooking their supper. Jerry was
helping her&mdash;not that she needed any help. They were grilling
pheasants and venison over a fire just inside the mouth of the
cave. Bubonovitch was examining the weapons left by the Sumatrans.
He selected a kris for himself. Jerry and Shrimp followed his
example, and Jerry brought Corrie a parang.</p>

<p>"Why did you ask that bandit if he had heard of any American
fliers who had bailed out recently?" Corrie asked Lucas.</p>

<p>"Two of my crew, who are known to have bailed out, are
unaccounted for&mdash;Douglas, my radioman, and Davis, a waist
gunner. We hunted for them, but could find no trace of them. We
found the body of Lieutenant Burnham whose chute had failed to
open. So we figured that if either of the other chutes had failed
to open we should have found the body nearby. We all jumped within
a matter of a few seconds."</p>

<p>"How many were you?"</p>

<p>"Eleven&mdash;nine in the crew, Colonel Clayton, and a
photographer. My bombardier was left behind because he was sick.
Anyway, we weren't carrying any bombs. It was just a reconnaissance
and photographic mission."</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Corrie. "There are four of you here,
Lieutenant Burnham makes five, and the two unaccounted for make
seven. What became of the other four?"</p>

<p>"Killed in action."</p>

<p>"Poor boys," said Corrie.</p>

<p>"It is not those who are killed who suffer," said Jerry. "It is
those who are left behind&mdash;their buddies and their folks back
home. Maybe they're better off. After all, this is a hell of a
world," he added bitterly, "and those who get out of it are the
lucky ones."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his. "You mustn't feel that way. There may
be a lot of happiness in the world for you yet&mdash;for all of
us."</p>

<p>"They were my friends," he said, "and they were very young. They
hadn't had a chance to get much out of life. It just doesn't seem
right. Tarzan says that it does no good to hate, and I know he's
right. But I do hate&mdash;not the poor dumb things who shoot at
us and whom we shoot at, but those who are responsible for making
wars."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "I hate them, too. But I hate all Japs. I
hate the 'poor dumb things who shoot at us and whom we shoot at.' I
am not as philosophical as you and Tarzan. I want to hate them. I
often reproach myself because I think I am not hating bitterly
enough." Jerry could see that hate reflected in her eyes, and he
thought what a horrible thing it was that such an emotion could
have been aroused in the breast of one so innately sweet and kind.
He said to her what she had said to him: "You mustn't feel that
way," and he added, "You were never made for hate."</p>

<p>"You never saw your mother hounded to death and your father
bayoneted by those yellow beasts. If you had and didn't hate them
you wouldn't be fit to call yourself a man."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," he said. He pressed her hand. "Poor
little girl."</p>

<p>"Don't sympathize with me," she said almost angrily. "I didn't
cry then. I haven't cried since. But if you sympathize with me, I
shall."</p>

<p>Had she emphasized "you?" He thought that she had&mdash;just a
little. Why, he asked himself, should that send a little thrill
through him? I must be going ga-ga, he thought.</p>

<p>Now the little band gathered around the cooking fire for supper.
They had broad leaves for plates, sharpened bamboo splinters for
forks, and of course they had their knives. They drank from
gourds.</p>

<p>Besides pheasant and venison, they had fruit and the roasted
seeds of the durian. They lived well in this land of plenty. "T'ink
of de poor dogfaces back at base," said Shrimp, "eatin' canned hash
an' spam."</p>

<p>"And drinking that goddam G-I coffee," said Bubonovitch. "It
always made me think of one of Alexander Woolcott's first lines in
'The Man Who Came to Dinner.'"</p>

<p>"I'll trade places with any dogface right now," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"What's a dogface?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess originally it was supposed to mean a doughboy;
but now it sort of means any enlisted man, more specifically a
private."</p>

<p>"Any G-I Joe," said Shrimp.</p>

<p>"What a strange language!" said Corrie. "And I thought I
understood English."</p>

<p>"It isn't English," said Tarzan. "It's American. It's a young
and virile language. I like it."</p>

<p>"But what is a doughboy? And a G-I Joe?"</p>

<p>"A doughboy is an infantryman. A G-I Joe is an American
soldier&mdash;Government Issue. Stick with us, Corrie, and we'll
improve your American and ruin your English," concluded Jerry.</p>

<p>"If you will pay special attention to Sergeant Rosetti's
conversation they will both be ruined," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Wot's wrong wit' my American, wise guy?" demanded Shrimp.</p>

<p>"I think Sergeant Shrimp is cute," said Corrie.</p>

<p>Rosetti flushed violently. "Take a bow, cutie," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Shrimp grinned. He was used to being ribbed, and he never got
mad, although sometimes he pretended to be. "I ain't heard no one
callin' you cute, you big cow," he said, and he felt that with that
come-back his honor had been satisfied.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE supper, Tarzan had cut two large slabs of
bark from a huge tree in the forest. The slabs were fully an inch
thick, tough and strong. From them he cut two disks, as nearly
sixteen and a half inches in diameter as he could calculate. In
about one half of the periphery of each disk he cut six deep
notches, leaving five protuberances between them.</p>

<p>After supper, Jerry and the others, sitting around the fire,
watched him. "Now what the heck are those for?" asked the pilot.
"They looked like round, flat feet with five toes."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tarzan. "I didn't realize that I was such a
good sculptor. These are to deceive the enemy. I have no doubt but
that that old villain will return with Japs just as quickly as he
can. Now those natives must be good trackers, and they must be very
familiar with our spoor, for they followed it here. Our homemade
sandals would identify our spoor to even the stupidest tracker. So
we must obliterate it.</p>

<p>"First we will go into the forest in a direction different from
the one we intend taking, and we will leave spoor that will
immediately identify our party. Then we will cut back to camp
through the undergrowth where we can walk without leaving
footprints, and start out on the trail we intend taking. Three of
us will walk in single file, each stepping exactly in the
footprints of the man ahead of him. I will carry Corrie. It would
tire her to take a man's stride. Bubonovitch will bring up the
rear, wearing one of these strapped to each foot. With one of them
he will step on each and every footprint that we have made. He will
have to do a considerable split to walk with these on, but he is a
big man with long legs. These will make the footprints of an
elephant and obliterate ours."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Rosetti. "A elephant's feet ain't that
big!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure myself about these Indian elephants," admitted
Tarzan. "But the circumference of an African elephant's front foot
is half the animal's height at the shoulder. So these will indicate
an elephant approximately nine feet in height. Unfortunately,
Bubonovitch doesn't weigh as much as an elephant; so the spoor
won't be as lifelike as I'd like. But I'm banking on the likelihood
that they won't pay much attention to elephant spoor while they are
looking for ours. If they do, they are going to be terribly
surprised to discover the trail of a two-legged elephant.</p>

<p>"Had we been in Africa the problem would have been complicated
by the fact that the African elephant has five toes in front and
three behind. That would have necessitated another set of these,
and Jerry would have had to be the hind legs."</p>

<p>"De sout' end of a elephant goin' nort', Cap," said Shrimp.</p>

<p>"I'm not selfish," said Jerry. "Bubonovitch can be the whole
elephant."</p>

<p>"You'd better put Shrimp at the head of the column," said
Bubonovitch, "I might step on him."</p>

<p>"I think we'd better turn in now," said Tarzan. "What time have
you, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"You have the first watch tonight&mdash;two and a half hours on.
That will bring it just right. Shrimp draws the last&mdash;3:30 to
6:00. Good night!"</p>

<p>They started early the following morning after a cold breakfast.
First they made the false trail. Then they started off in the
direction they intended taking, Bubonovitch bringing up the rear,
stamping down hard on the footprints of those who preceded him. At
the end of a mile, which was as far as Tarzan thought necessary to
camouflage their trail, he was a pretty tired elephant. He sat down
beside the trail and took off his cumbersome feet. "Migawd!" he
said. "I'm just about split to the chin. Whoever wants to play
elephas maximus of the order Proboscidea can have these goddam
things." He tossed them into the trail.</p>

<p>Tarzan picked them up and threw them out into the underbrush.
"It was a tough assignment, Sergeant; but you were the best man for
it."</p>

<p>"I could have carried Corrie."</p>

<p>"An' you wit' a wife an' kid!" chided Shrimp.</p>

<p>"I think the colonel pulled rank on you," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Tarzan; "it was just that I couldn't think of
throwing Corrie to the wolves."</p>

<p>"I guess dat will hold you," observed Shrimp.</p>

<p>Corrie was laughing, her eyes shining. She liked these Americans
with their strange humor, their disregard for conventions. And the
Englishman, though a little more restrained, was much like them.
Jerry had told her that he was a viscount, but his personality
impressed her more than his title.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tarzan raised his head and tested the air with his
nostrils. "Take to the trees," he said.</p>

<p>"Is something coming?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"Yes. One of the sergeant's relatives&mdash;with both ends. It
is a lone bull, and sometimes they are mean."</p>

<p>He swung Corrie to an overhanging branch, as the others
scrambled up the nearest trees. Tarzan smiled. They were becoming
proficient. He remained standing in the trail.</p>

<p>"You're not going to stay there?" demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>"For a while. I like elephants. They are my friends. Most of
them like me. I shall know in plenty of time if he is going to
charge."</p>

<p>"But this is not an African elephant," insisted Jerry.</p>

<p>"Maybe he never heard of Tarzan," suggested Shrimp.</p>

<p>"The Indian elephant is not so savage as the African, and I want
to try an experiment. I have a theory. If it proves incorrect, I
shall take to the trees. He will warn me, for if he is going to
charge, he will raise his ears, curl up his trunk, and trumpet.
Now, please don't talk or make any noise. He is getting close."</p>

<p>The four in the trees waited expectantly. Corrie was
frightened&mdash;frightened for Tarzan. Jerry thought it foolish
for the man to take such chances. Shrimp wished that he had a tommy
gun&mdash;just in case. Every eye was glued on the turn in the
trail, at the point where the elephant would first appear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great bulk of the beast came into view. It dwarfed
Tarzan. When the little eyes saw Tarzan, the animal stopped.
Instantly the ears were spread and the trunk curled up. "It is
going to charge," was the thought of those in the trees.</p>

<p>Corrie's lips moved. Silently they formed the plea, "Quick,
Tarzan! Quick!"</p>

<p>And then Tarzan spoke. He spoke to the elephant in the language
that he believed was common to most beasts&mdash;the mother tongue
of the great apes. Few could speak it, but he knew that many
understood it. "Yo, Tantor, yo!" he said.</p>

<p>The elephant was weaving from side to side. It did not trumpet.
Slowly the ears dropped and the trunk uncurled. "Yud!" said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>The great beast hesitated a moment, and then came slowly toward
the man. It stopped in front of him and the trunk reached out and
moved over his body. Corrie clutched the tree branch to keep from
falling. She could understand how, involuntarily, some women scream
or faint in moments of high excitement.</p>

<p>Tarzan stroked the trunk for a moment, whispering quietly to the
huge mass towering above him. "Abu tand-nala!" he said presently.
Slowly, the elephant knelt. Tarzan wrapped the trunk about his body
and said, "Nala b'yat!" and Tantor lifted him and placed him upon
his head.</p>

<p>"Unk!" commanded Tarzan. The elephant moved off down the trail,
passing beneath the trees where the astonished four sat, scarcely
breathing.</p>

<p>Shrimp was the first to break the long silence. "I've saw
everyt'ing now. Geeze! wot a guy!"</p>

<p>"Are you forgetting Goige de Toid?" demanded Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Shrimp muttered something under his breath that was not fit for
Corrie's ears.</p>

<p>Presently Tarzan returned on foot and alone. "We'd better be
moving along," he said, and the others dropped down from the
trees.</p>

<p>Jerry was not a little irritated by what he thought had been an
egotistical display of courage and prowess, and his voice revealed
his irritation when he asked, "What was the use of taking such a
risk, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"In the haunts of wild beasts one must know many things if one
is to survive," Tarzan explained. "This is strange country to me.
In my country the elephants are my friends. On more than one
occasion they have saved my life. I wanted to know the temper of
the elephants here and if I could impose my will on them as I do at
home. It is possible that some day you may be glad that I did so.
The chances are that I shall never see that bull again; but if we
should meet, he will know me and I shall know him. Tantor and I
have long memories both for friends and enemies."</p>

<p>"Sorry I spoke as I did," said Jerry; "but we were all
frightened to see you take such a risk."</p>

<p>"I took no risk," said Tarzan; "but don't you do it."</p>

<p>"What would he have done to one of us?" asked Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Gored you probably, knelt on you, and then tossed the pulp that
had been you high into the forest."</p>

<p>Corrie shuddered. Shrimp shook his head. "An' I uset to feed 'em
peanuts at de coicus."</p>

<p>"The wild beasts I've seen here in the open look larger and more
menacing than those I used to see in menageries and zoos," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Or in a museum, stuffed," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Mounted," corrected Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Purist," said Jerry.</p>

<p>Presently they entered a forest of enormous straight trunked
trees, enveloped by giant creepers, vines, and huge air plants that
formed a thick canopy overhead. The dim light, the cathedral
vistas, the sounds of unseen things depressed the spirits of all
but Tarzan. They plodded on in silence, longing for the light of
the sun. And then, at a turning in the trail, they came suddenly
into its full glare as the forest ended abruptly at the edge of a
gorge.</p>

<p>Below them lay a narrow valley cut through the ages into the
tuff and limestone formation of the terrain by the little river
that raced riotously along its bottom. It was a pleasant valley,
green and tree dotted.</p>

<p>Tarzan scrutinized its face carefully. There was no sign of
human life; but some deer fed there, and his keen eyes recognized a
black blob, almost indistinguishable in the dense shade of a tree.
He pointed it out to the others. "Beware of him," he cautioned. "He
is infinitely more dangerous than Tantor, and sometimes even than
Stripes."</p>

<p>"What is it, a water buffalo?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"No. It is Buto the rhinoceros. His sight is very poor, but his
hearing and scent are extremely acute. He has an ugly and
unpredictable disposition. Ordinarily, he will run away from you.
But you can never tell. Without any provocation he may come
thundering down on you as fast as a good horse; and if he gets you,
he'll gore and toss you."</p>

<p>"Not ours," said Corrie. "They have lower tusks, and they use
those instead of their horns."</p>

<p>"I remember now," said Tarzan, "hearing that. I was thinking of
the African rhino."</p>

<p>The trail turned abruptly to the right at the edge of the
escarpment and hurled itself over the rim, angling steeply
downward, narrow and precarious. They were all glad when they
reached the bottom.</p>

<p>"Stay here," said Tarzan, "and don't make any noise. I am going
to try to get one of those deer. Buto won't get your scent from
here; and if you don't make any noise, he won't hear you. I'll
circle around to the left. Those bushes there will hide me until I
get within range of the deer. If I get one, I'll go right on down
to the river where the trail crosses it. You can come on then and
meet me there. The trail passes Buto at about a hundred yards. If
he gets your scent, or hears you, and stands up, don't move unless
he starts toward you; then find a tree."</p>

<p>Tarzan crouched and moved silently among the tall grasses. The
wind, blowing from the direction of the deer toward the rhinoceros,
carried no scent of the intruders to either. It would to the latter
when Tarzan reached the deer and when the others crossed the wind
to reach the river.</p>

<p>Tarzan disappeared from the sight of those who waited at the
foot of the cliff. They wondered how he could find cover where
there seemed to be none. Everything seemed to be moving according
to plan when there was a sudden interruption. They saw a deer
suddenly raise its head and look back; then it and the little herd
of which it was a part were off like a flash, coming almost
directly toward them.</p>

<p>They saw Tarzan rise from the grasses and leap upon a young
buck. His knife flashed in the sun, and both fell, disappearing in
the grass. The four watchers were engrossed by this primitive
drama&mdash;the primordial hunter stalking and killing his quarry.
Thus it must have been ages and ages ago.</p>

<p>Finally Jerry said, "Well, let's get going."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" Shrimp exclaimed, pointing. "Lookit!"</p>

<p>They looked. Buto had arisen and was peering this way and that
with his dull little eyes. But he was listening and scenting the
wind, too.</p>

<p>"Don't move," whispered Jerry.</p>

<p>"An' they ain't no trees," breathed Shrimp. He was right. In
their immediate vicinity there were no trees.</p>

<p>"Don't move," cautioned Jerry again. "If he's going to charge,
he'll charge anything that moves."</p>

<p>"Here he comes," said Bubonovitch. The rhino was walking toward
them. He seemed more puzzled than angry. His dim vision had,
perhaps, discovered something foreign to the scene. Something he
could neither hear nor smell. And curiosity prompted him to
investigate.</p>

<p>The three men, by one accord, moved cautiously between Corrie
and the slowly oncoming beast. It was a tense moment. If Buto
charged, someone would be hurt, probably killed. They watched the
creature with straining eyes. They saw the little tail go up and
the head down as the rhino broke into a trot. He had seen them and
was coming straight for them. Suddenly he was galloping. "This is
it," said Jerry.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Shrimp leaped away from them and ran
diagonally across the path of the charging brute. And the rhino
swerved and went for him. Shrimp ran as he had never run before;
but he couldn't run as fast as a horse, and the rhino could.</p>

<p>Horror-stricken, the others watched. Horror-stricken and
helpless. Then they saw Tarzan. He was running to meet the man and
the beast, who were headed directly toward him. But what could he
do? the watchers asked themselves. What could two relatively puny
men do against those tons of savage flesh and bone?</p>

<p>The beast was close behind Shrimp now and Tarzan was only a few
yards away. Then Shrimp stumbled and fell. Corrie covered her eyes
with her hands. Jerry and Bubonovitch, released as though from a
momentary paralysis, started running toward the scene of certain
tragedy.</p>

<p>Corrie, impelled against her will, removed her hands from her
eyes. She saw the rhino's head go down as though to gore the
prostrate man now practically beneath its front feet.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan leaped, turning in air, and alighted astride the
beast's shoulders. The diversion was enough to distract the
animal's attention from Shrimp. It galloped over him, bucking to
dislodge the man-thing on its back.</p>

<p>Tarzan held his seat long enough to plunge his knife through the
thick hide directly behind the head and sever the brute's spinal
cord. Paralyzed, it stumbled to the ground. A moment later it was
dead.</p>

<p>Soon the entire party was gathered around the kill. A relieved
and, perhaps, a slightly trembling party. Tarzan turned to Shrimp.
"That was one of the bravest things I ever saw done, sergeant," he
said.</p>

<p>"Shrimp didn't rate medals for nothing, Colonel," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THEY were now well supplied with meat&mdash;too
well. A deer and a rhinoceros for five people seemed more than
ample. Tarzan had taken some choice cuts from the young buck and
cut the hump from the rhino. Now, beside the river, he had built a
fire in a hole that he had dug. Over another fire, the others were
grilling bits of venison.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to eat that are you?" asked Shrimp, pointing at
the big hunk of rhino meat with the skin still attached. "In a
couple of hours you'll eat it," said Tarzan. "You'll like it."</p>

<p>When he had a bed of hot coals in the bottom of the hole he had
dug, he laid the hump in with the skin side down, covered it with
leaves and then with the dirt he had excavated.</p>

<p>Taking a piece of venison, he withdrew a little from the others,
squatted down on his haunches and tore off pieces of the raw flesh
with his strong teeth. The others had long since ceased to pay
attention to this seeming idiosyncrasy. They had, on occasion,
eaten their meat raw; but they still preferred it
cooked&mdash;usually charred on the outside, raw on the inside, and
covered with dirt. They were no longer fastidious.</p>

<p>"What was on your mind, Shrimp, while you were legging it in
front of Rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis?" asked Bubonovitch.
"You sure hit nothing but the high spots. I'll bet you did the
hundred yards in under eight seconds."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you wot I was thinkin'. I'd started on Ave Maria w'en
I seen it was nothin' less 'n Whirlaway on my tail. I was thinkin'
if I could just finish that one Ave Maria before it caught up with
me, I might have a chance. Then I stumbled. But the Blessed Mary
heard me and saved me."</p>

<p>"I thought it was Tarzan," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Of course it was Tarzan; but whoinell do you suppose got him
there in time, you dope?"</p>

<p>"There are no atheists at the business end of a rhinoceros,"
said Jerry.</p>

<p>"I prayed, too," said Corrie. "I prayed that God would not let
anything happen to you who were risking you life to save ours. You
are a very brave man, sergeant, for you must have known that you
didn't have one chance in a million."</p>

<p>Rosetti was very unhappy. He wished that they would talk about
something else. "You got me all wrong," he said. "I just ain't got
no sense. If I had, I'd a run the other way; but I didn't think of
it in time. The guy who had the guts was the colonel. Think of
killin' a deer an' dat rhino wit' nothin' but a knife." This gave
him an idea for changing the subject. "An' think of all dat meat
lyin' out there an' the poor suckers back home got to have ration
coupons an' then they can't get enough."</p>

<p>"Think of the starving Armenians," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"All the Armenians I ever seen could starve as far as I'm
concerned," said Shrimp. He took another piece of venison and
lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Jerry had been watching Corrie when he could snatch a quick look
without actually staring at her. He saw her tearing at the meat
with her fine, white teeth. He recalled what she had said about
hating the Japs: "I want to hate them. I often reproach myself
because I think I am not hating bitterly enough." He thought, what
kind of a woman will she be after the war&mdash;after all that she
has gone through?</p>

<p>He looked at Tarzan tearing at raw meat. He looked at the
others, their hands and faces smeared with the juices of the
venison, dirty with the char of the burned portions.</p>

<p>"I wonder what sort of a world this will be after peace comes,"
he said. "What kind of people will we be? Most of us are so young
that we will be able to remember little else than
war&mdash;killing, hate, blood. I wonder if we can ever settle down
to the humdrum existence of civilian life."</p>

<p>"Say! If I ever get my feet under a desk again," said
Bubonovitch, "I hope God strikes me dead if I ever take them out
again."</p>

<p>"That's what you think now, Bum. And I hope you're right. For
myself, I don't know. Sometimes I hate flying, but it's in my blood
by now. Maybe it isn't just the flying&mdash;it's the thrill and
excitement, possibly. And if that is true, then it's the fighting
and the killing that I like. I don't know. I hope not. It will be a
hell of a world if a great many young fellows feel that way.</p>

<p>"And take Corrie. She has learned to hate. She was never made
for that. That is what war and the Japs have done to her. I wonder
if hate twists a person's soul out of shape, so that he's never the
same as he was before&mdash;if, like an incipient cancer, it eats
at the roots of character without one's being aware that one has a
cancer."</p>

<p>"I think you need not worry," said Tarzan. "Man readily adapts
himself to changed conditions. The young, especially, react quickly
to changes of environment and circumstance. You will take your
proper places in life when peace comes. Only the weak and the
warped will be changed for the worse."</p>

<p>"Wit' all de different ways of killin' and maimin' wot we've
learnt, like sneakin' up behind a guy an' cuttin' his throat or
garrotin' him an' a lot of worse t'ings than dat even, they's goin'
to be a lot of bozos startin' Murder Incorporateds all over de
U.S., take it from me," said Shrimp. "I knows dem guys. I didn't
live all my life in Chi fer nuttin'."</p>

<p>"I think it will change us very much," said Corrie. "We will not
be the same people we would have been had we not gone through this.
It has matured us rapidly, and that means that we have lost a great
deal of our youth. Jerry told me the other day that he is only
twenty-three. I thought that he was well along in his thirties. He
has lost ten years of his youth. Can he be the same man he would
have been had he lived those ten years in peace and security? No. I
believe he will be a better man.</p>

<p>"I believe that I shall be a better woman for the very emotion
which he and Tarzan deplore&mdash;hate. I do not mean petty
hatreds. I mean a just hate&mdash;a grand hate that exalts. And for
the compensations it entails, such as loyalty to one's country and
one's comrades, the strong friendships and affections which are
engendered by a common, holy hatred for a common enemy."</p>

<p>For a while no one spoke. They seemed to be considering this
unique eulogy of hate. It was Jerry who broke the silence. "That is
a new angle," he said. "I never thought of hate in that way before.
As a matter of fact, fighting men don't do a lot of hating. That
seems to be the prerogative of non-combatants."</p>

<p>"Bosh," said Corrie. "That is just a heroic pose on the part of
fighting men. When a Jap atrocity hits close to home, I'll bet they
hate&mdash;when a buddy is tortured, when they learn that Allied
prisoners of war have been beheaded. That has happened here, and
I'll warrant that our Dutch fighting men learned then to hate, if
they had not hated before. And furthermore," said Corrie acidly, "I
do not consider myself a noncombatant."</p>

<p>Jerry smiled. "Forgive me. I didn't mean that remark
derogatorily. And anyway it wasn't aimed at you. You are one of us,
and we are all combatants."</p>

<p>Corrie, mollified, smiled back at him. She may have been a good
two-fisted hater, but that was not hate that shone from her eyes at
the moment.</p>

<p>Shrimp interrupted the discussion. "Geeze!" he exclaimed. "Get a
load of dis. It smells like heaven."</p>

<p>They looked, to see Tarzan removing the roast from the
improvised oven. "Come an' get it!" called Shrimp.</p>

<p>To their surprise, they found the rhino hump juicy, tender, and
delicious. And as they ate, a pair of eyes watched them from the
concealment of bushes that grew at the edge of the cliff beyond the
river&mdash;watched them for a few minutes; then the owner of the
eyes turned back into the forest.</p>

<p>That night, the wild dogs fought over the carcasses of Tarzan's
kills until, near dawn, a tiger came and drove them from their
feast to stand in a dismal, growling circle until the lord of the
jungle should depart.</p>

<p>Wars make words. World War II is no exception. Probably the most
notorious word for which it is responsible is quisling. Wars also
unmake words. Collaborationist formerly had a fair and honorable
connotation, but I doubt that it ever will live down World War II.
No one will ever again wish to be known as a collaborationist.</p>

<p>They are to be found in every country where the enemy is to be
found. There are collaborationists in Sumatra. Such was Amat. He
was a miserable creature who bowed low to every Jap soldier and
sought to curry favor with them. He was a human jackal that fed off
the leavings of the arrogant invaders who slapped his face when he
got underfoot.</p>

<p>So, when he saw the five white people camped by the river in the
little valley, he licked his full lips as though in anticipation of
a feast, and hurried back along the trail toward the village of his
people where a detachment of Jap soldiers was temporarily
billeted.</p>

<p>He had two reasons for hurrying. He was anxious to impart his
information to the enemy. That was one reason. The other was
terror. He had not realized how late it was. Darkness would fall
before he could reach the village. It is then that my lord the
tiger walks abroad in the forest.</p>

<p>He was still a couple of kilometers from home, and dusk was
heralding the short equatorial twilight when Amat's worst fear was
realized. The hideous face of the lord of the jungle loomed
directly in his path. The terrifying eyes, the wrinkled, snarling
face of a tiger, between which and its intended victim there are no
iron bars and only a few yards of lonely jungle trail, are probably
as horrifying a sight as the eyes of man have ever envisaged.</p>

<p>The tiger did not for long leave Amat in any doubt as to its
intentions. It charged. Amat shrieked, and leaped for a tree. Still
shrieking, he clawed his way upward. The tiger sprang for him and,
unfortunately, missed. Amat scrambled higher, sweating and panting.
He clung there, trembling; and there we may leave him until
morning.</p>

</h2>

<p class="first">"GEEZE! Wot a country," growled Shrimp, as they
toiled up the steep trail out of the valley in the light of a new
day. "If you ain't crawlin' down into a hole, you're crawlin' up
outta one. God must a-been practicin' when He made this."</p>

<p>"And when he got through practicing, I suppose, He made
Chicago," suggested Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Now you're shoutin', wise guy. God sure made Chi. Wen He wasn't
lookin', somebody else made Brooklyn. Geeze! I wisht I was in dear
ol' Chi right now. Why, de steepest hill dere is de approach to de
Madison Street bridge."</p>

<p>"Look at the view, man. Have you no eye for beauty?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I got an eye for beauty; but my feet ain't. They joined
up for de air force, an' now they ain't nuttin' but goddam
doughboys."</p>

<p>But all things must end, and eventually they reached the top of
the escarpment. Tarzan examined the trail. "There was a native here
recently," he said. "Probably late yesterday afternoon. He may have
seen us. He stood right here for several minutes, where he could
look down on our camp."</p>

<p>As the little party continued along the trail into the forest,
Amat rushed breathlessly into his village, bursting with the
information that had been seething within him during a night of
terror. So excited was he that he failed to bow to a Jap private
and got slapped and almost bayoneted. But at last he stood before
Lt. Kumajiro Tada, this time not forgetting to bow very low.</p>

<p>Excitedly he rattled off an account of what he had seen. Tada,
not understanding a word of the native dialect and being
particularly godlike thus early in the morning, kicked Amat in the
groin. Amat screamed, grabbed his hurt, and sank to the ground.
Tada drew his sword. It had been a long time since he had lopped
off a head, and he felt like lopping off a head before
breakfast.</p>

<p>A sergeant who had overheard Amat's report and who understood
the dialect, saluted and bowed. Sucking wind through his teeth, he
informed the honorable lieutenant that Amat had seen a party of
whites and that that was what he had been trying to tell the
honorable lieutenant. Reluctantly, Tada scabbarded his sword and
listened as the sergeant interpreted.</p>

<p>A couple of miles from the point at which they had entered the
forest, Tarzan stopped and examined the trail minutely. "Here," he
said, "our native friend was treed by a tiger. He remained in this
tree all night, coming down only a short time ago, probably as soon
as it was light. You can see where the pugs of the beast
obliterated the spoor the fellow made last night. Here is where he
jumped down this morning and continued on his way."</p>

<p>They continued on and presently came to a fork in the trail.
Again Tarzan stopped. He showed them which way the native had gone.
In the other fork he pointed out evidence that a number of men had
gone that way perhaps several days before. "These were not
natives," he said, "nor do I think they were Japs. These are the
footprints of very large men. Jerry, suppose you folks follow along
the trail the native took, while I investigate the other one. These
chaps may be Dutch guerrillas. If they are, they might prove mighty
helpful to us. Don't travel too fast, and I may catch up with
you."</p>

<p>"We'll probably come to a native village," said Jerry. "If we
do, perhaps we'd better hole up in the jungle until you come along;
so that we can all approach it together. In the meantime, I'll look
the place over."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded assent and swung into the trees, following the
left hand fork of the trail. They watched him until he was out of
sight. "That guy likes to travel de hard way?" said Shrimp.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look so hard when you watch him," said Bubonovitch.
"It's only when you try to do it yourself."</p>

<p>"It's an ideal way to travel, under the circumstances," Jerry
said. "It leaves no trail, and it gives him every advantage over
any enemy he might meet."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," said Corrie. "He is so graceful, and he moves
so quietly." She sighed. "If we could all do it, how much safer we
should be!"</p>

<p>"I t'ink I'll practice up," said Shrimp. "An' w'en I gets home I
goes out to Garfield Park and swings t'rough de trees some Sunday
w'en dey's a gang dere."</p>

<p>"And get pinched," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Sure I'd get pinched, but I'd make de front pages wit'
pitchurs. Maybe I'd get a job wit' Sol Lesser out in
Hollywood."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get the reefers, Shrimp?" inquired Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Shrimp grinned. "Me? I don't use 'em. I don't work fer Petrillo.
I just get dat way from associatin' wit' you."</p>

<p>They were moving leisurely along the trail toward Amat's
village, Bubonovitch in the lead, Rosetti behind him. Jerry and
Corrie followed several yards in the rear. Then Corrie stopped to
re-tie the laces of one of her moccasins, and Jerry waited for her.
The others passed out of sight beyond a turn in the winding
trail.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel a little lost without Tarzan?" Corrie asked as
she straightened up. Then she voiced a little exclamation of
dismay. "Oh, I don't mean that I haven't every confidence in you
and Bubonovitch and Rosetti, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jerry smiled. "Don't apologize. I feel the same way you do.
We're all out of our natural environment. He's not. He's right at
home here. I don't know what we should have done without him."</p>

<p>"We should have been just a lot of babes in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" cautioned Jerry, suddenly alert. He heard voices
ahead. Hoarse shouts in a strange tongue. "Japs!" he exclaimed. He
started to run toward the sounds. Then he stopped and turned back.
His was a cruel decision any way he looked at it. He must desert
either his two sergeants or the girl. But he was accustomed to
making hair-trigger decisions.</p>

<p>He seized Corrie by an arm and dragged her into the tangle of
undergrowth beside the trail. They wormed their way in farther and
farther as long as the sound of the voices came no nearer. When
they did, indicating that the Japs were investigating the trail in
their direction, they lay flat on the ground beneath a riot of
equatorial verdure. A searcher might have passed within a foot of
them without seeing them.</p>

<p>A dozen soldiers surprised and captured Bubonovitch and Rosetti.
They didn't have a chance. The Japs slapped them around and
threatened them with bayonets until Lt. Tada called them off. Tada
spoke English. He had worked as a dishwasher in a hotel in Eugene
while attending the University of Oregon, and he had sized up the
prisoners immediately as Americans. He questioned them, and each
gave his name, rank, and serial number.</p>

<p>"You were from that bomber that was shot down?" demanded
Tada.</p>

<p>"We have given you all the information we are required or
permitted to give."</p>

<p>Tada spoke to a soldier in Japanese. The man advanced and pushed
the point of his bayonet against Bubonovitch's belly. "Now will you
answer my question?" growled Tada.</p>

<p>"You know the rules governing the treatment of prisoners of
war," said Bubonovitch, "but I don't suppose that makes any
difference to you. It does to me, though. I won't answer any more
questions."</p>

<p>"You are a damn fool," said Tada. He turned to Rosetti. "How
about you?" he demanded. "Will you answer?"</p>

<p>"Nuttin' doin'," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"There were five in your party&mdash;four men and a girl. Where
are the other three?&mdash;where is the girl?" the Jap
persisted.</p>

<p>"You seen how many was in our party. Do we look like five? Or
can't you count? Does eider of us look like a dame? Somebody's been
stringin' you, Tojo."</p>

<p>"O.K., wise guy," snapped Tada. "I'm goin' to give you until
tomorrow morning to think it over. You answer all my questions
tomorrow morning, or you both get beheaded." He tapped the long
officer's sword at his side.</p>

<p>"Anday I-ay essgay e-hay ain'tay oolin-fay," said Rosetti to
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"You bet your sweet life I ain't foolin', Yank," said Tada.</p>

<p>Shrimp was crestfallen. "Geeze! Who'd a-thought a Nip would
savvy hog Latin!" he moaned to Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Tada sent two of his men along the trail to search for the other
members of the party. He and the remainder turned back toward
Amat's village with the two prisoners.</p>

<p>Jerry and Corrie had overheard all that had been said. They
heard the main party move off in the direction from which they had
come, but they did not know of the two who had been sent in search
of them. Believing that they were now safe from detection, they
crawled from their concealment and returned to the trail.</p>

<p><br><br>Tarzan, swinging easily through the middle terrace of the
forest, had covered perhaps two miles when his attention was
arrested by a commotion ahead. He heard the familiar grunts and
growls and chattering of the great apes, and guessed that they were
attacking or being attacked by an enemy. As the sounds lay directly
in his path, he continued on.</p>

<p>Presently he came within sight of four adult orangutans swinging
excitedly among the branches of a great tree. They darted in and
out, striking and screaming. And then he saw the object of their
anger&mdash;a python holding in its coils a young orangutan.</p>

<p>Tarzan took in the whole scene at a glance. The python had not
as yet constricted. It merely held the struggling victim while it
sought to fight off the attacking apes. The screams of the young
one were definite proof that it was still very much alive.</p>

<p>Tarzan thrilled to the savage call to battle, to the challenge
of his ancient enemy, Histah the snake, to the peril of his
friends, the Mangani&mdash;the great apes. If he wondered if they
would recognize him as friend, or attack him as foe, the thought
did not deter him. He swung quickly into the tree in which the
tragedy was being enacted, but to a branch above the python and its
victim.</p>

<p>So intent were the actors in this primitive drama upon the main
issue that none were aware of his presence until he spoke,
wondering if, like Tantor, the great apes would understand him.</p>

<p>"Kreeg-ah!" he shouted. "Tarzan bundolo Histah!"</p>

<p>The apes froze and looked up. They saw an almost naked man-thing
poised above the python, in the man-thing's hand a gleaming
blade.</p>

<p>"Bundolo! Bundolo!" they shouted&mdash;Kill! Kill! And Tarzan
knew that they understood. Then he dropped full upon the python and
its victim. Steel thewed fingers gripped the snake behind its head,
as Tarzan clung to the coils and the young ape with powerful legs.
His keen blade cut deep into the writhing body just back of the
hand that held its neck in a viselike grasp. The whipping coils,
convulsed in agony, released the young orangutan and sought to
enmesh the body of the creature clinging to them. Its frantic
struggles released the python's hold upon the branches of the tree,
and it fell to earth, carrying Tarzan with it. Other branches broke
their fall, and the man was not injured. But the snake was far from
dead. Its maddened writhings had made it impossible for Tarzan to
wield his blade effectively. The snake was badly wounded, but still
a most formidable foe. Should it succeed in enmeshing Tarzan in its
mighty coils, his body would be crushed long before he could kill
it.</p>

<p>And now the apes dropped to the ground beside the contestants in
this grim battle of life and death. Growling, chattering,
screaming, the four mighty adults leaped upon the beating coils of
the python, tearing them from the body of the man-thing. And
Tarzan's knife found its mark again.</p>

<p>As the severed head rolled to the ground, Tarzan leaped aside.
So did the apes, for the death struggles of the giant snake might
prove as lethal as though guided by the tiny brain.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned and faced the apes; then he placed a foot on the
dead head and, raising his face to the heavens, voiced the victory
cry of the bull ape. It rang wild and weird and terrifying through
the primeval forest, and for a moment the voices of the jungle were
stilled.</p>

<p>The apes looked at the man-thing. All their lives his kind had
been their natural enemies. Was he friend or foe?</p>

<p>Tarzan struck his breast, and said, "Tarzan."</p>

<p>The apes nodded, and said, "Tarzan," for 'tar-zan' means
white-skin in the language of the great apes.</p>

<p>"Tarzan yo," said the man. "Mangani yo?"</p>

<p>"Mangani yo," said the oldest and largest of the
apes&mdash;great apes friend.</p>

<p>There was a noise in the trees, like the coming of a big
wind&mdash;the violent rustling and swishing of leaves and
branches. Apes and man looked expectantly in the direction from
which the sound came. All of them knew what created the sound. The
man alone did not know what it portended.</p>

<p>Presently he saw ten or twelve huge black forms swinging toward
them through the trees. The apes dropped to the ground around them.
They had heard Tarzan's piercing call, and had hastened to
investigate. It might be the victory cry of an enemy that had
overcome one of the tribe. It might have been a challenge to
battle.</p>

<p>They eyed Tarzan suspiciously, some of them with bared fangs. He
was a man-thing, a natural enemy. They looked from Tarzan to Uglo,
the oldest and largest of the apes. Uglo pointed at the man and
said, "Tarzan. Yo." Then, in the simple language of the first-men
and with signs and gestures, he told what Tarzan had done. The
newcomers nodded their understanding&mdash;all but one. Oju, a full
grown, powerful young orangutan, bared his fangs menacingly.</p>

<p>"Oju bundolo!" he growled&mdash;Oju kill!</p>

<p>Vanda, mother of the little ape rescued from the python, pressed
close to Tarzan, stroking him with a rough and horny palm. She
placed herself between Tarzan and Oju, but the former pushed her
gently aside.</p>

<p>Oju had issued a challenge which Tarzan could not ignore and
retain the respect of the tribe. This he knew, and though he did
not want to fight, he drew his knife and advanced toward the
growling Oju.</p>

<p>Standing nearly six feet in height and weighing fully three
hundred pounds, Oju was indeed a formidable opponent. His
enormously long arms, his Herculean muscles, his mighty fangs and
powerful jaws dwarfed the offensive equipment of even the mighty
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Oju lumbered forward, his calloused knuckles resting on the
ground. Uglo would have interfered. He made a halfhearted gesture
of stepping between them. But Uglo was really afraid. He was king,
but he was getting old. He knew that Oju was minded to challenge
his kingship. Should he antagonize him now, he might only hasten
the moment of his dethronement. He did not interfere. But Vanda
scolded, and so did the other apes which had witnessed Tarzan's
rescue of Vanda's balu.</p>

<p>Oju was not deterred. He waddled confidently to close quarters,
contemptuous of this puny man-thing. Could he lay one powerful hand
upon him, the fight would be as good as over. He extended a long
arm toward his intended victim. It was a tactical error.</p>

<p>Tarzan noted the slow, stupid advance, the outstretched hand;
and altered his own plan of battle. Carrying the knife to his mouth
and seizing the blade between his teeth, he freed both hands. Then
he sprang forward, grasped Oju's extended wrist with ten powerful
fingers, wheeled quickly, bent forward, and threw the ape over his
head&mdash;threw him so that he would fall heavily upon his
back.</p>

<p>Badly shaken, roaring with rage, Oju scrambled awkwardly to his
feet. Tarzan leaped quickly behind him while he was still off
balance, leaped upon his back, locked powerful legs about his
middle, and wrapped his left arm about his neck.</p>

<p>Then he pressed the point of his knife against the beast's
side&mdash;pressed it in until it brought a scream of pain from
Oju.</p>

<p>"Kagoda!" demanded Tarzan. That is ape for 'surrender.' It is
also ape for 'I surrender.' The difference is merely a matter of
inflection.</p>

<p>Oju reached a long arm back to seize his opponent. The knife dug
in again. This time deeper. Again Tarzan demanded, "Kagoda!" The
more Oju sought to dislodge the man-thing from his back, the deeper
the knife was pressed. Tarzan could have killed the ape, but he did
not wish to. Strong young bulls are the strength of a tribe, and
this tribe was mostly friendly to him.</p>

<p>Oju was standing still now. Blood was streaming down his side.
Tarzan moved the point of the knife to the base of Oju's brain and
jabbed it in just enough to draw blood and inflict pain.</p>

<p>"Kagoda!" screamed Oju.</p>

<p>Tarzan released his hold and stepped aside. Oju lumbered off and
squatted down to nurse his wounds. Tarzan knew that he had made an
enemy, but an enemy that would always be afraid of him. He also
knew that he had established himself as an equal in the tribe. He
would always have friends among them.</p>

<p>He called Uglo's attention to the spoor of men in the trail.
"Tarmangani?" he asked. Tar is white, mangani means great apes; so
tarmangani, white great apes, means white men.</p>

<p>"Sord tarmangani," said Uglo&mdash;bad white men.</p>

<p>Tarzan knew that to the great apes, all white men were bad. He
knew that he could not judge these men by the opinion of an ape. He
would have to investigate them himself. These men might prove
valuable allies.</p>

<p>He asked Uglo if the white men were traveling or camped. Uglo
said that they were camped. Tarzan asked how far away. Uglo
extended his arms at full length toward the sun and held his palms
facing one another and about a foot apart. That is as far as the
sun would appear to travel in an hour. That, Tarzan interpreted as
meaning that the camp of the white men was about three miles
distant&mdash;as far as the apes would ordinarily move through the
trees in an hour.</p>

<p>He swung into a tree and was gone in the direction of the camp
of the tarmangani. There are no "Goodbyes" nor "Au revoirs" in the
language of the apes. The members of the tribe had returned to
their normal activities. Oju nursed his wounds and his rage. He
bared his fangs at any who came near him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">JERRY was smarting under self-censure. "I feel
like a heel," he said, "letting those two fellows take it while I
hid. But I couldn't leave you here alone, Corrie, or risk your
capture."</p>

<p>"Even if I hadn't been here," said Corrie, "the thing for you to
do was just what you did. If you had been captured with them, you
could not have done anything more for them than they can do for
themselves. Now, perhaps, you and Tarzan and I can do something for
them."</p>

<p>"Thanks for putting it that way. Nevertheless, I&mdash;" He
stopped, listening. "Someone is coming," he said, and drew the girl
back into the concealment of the underbrush.</p>

<p>From where they were hidden, they had a clear view back along
the trail for a good fifty yards before it curved away from their
line of sight. Presently they heard voices more distinctly. "Japs,"
whispered Corrie. She took a handful of arrows from the quiver at
her back and fitted one to her bow. Jerry grinned and followed her
example.</p>

<p>A moment later, two Jap soldiers strolled carelessly into view.
Their rifles were slung across their backs. They had nothing to
fear in this direction&mdash;they thought. They had made a token
gesture of obeying their officer's instructions to search back
along the trail for the three missing whites, whom they had been
none too anxious to discover waiting in ambush for them. They would
loaf slowly back to camp and report that they had made a thorough
search.</p>

<p>Corrie leaned closer to Jerry and whispered, "You take the one
on the left. I'll take the other." Jerry nodded and raised his
bow.</p>

<p>"Let 'em come to within twenty feet," he said. "When I say now,
we'll fire together."</p>

<p>They waited. The Japs were approaching very slowly, jabbering as
though they had something worthwhile to say.</p>

<p>"Monkey talk," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"S-sh!" cautioned the girl. She stood with her bow drawn, the
feathers of the arrow at her right ear. Jerry glanced at her from
the corners of his eyes. Joan of Sumatra, he thought. The Japs were
approaching the dead line.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Jerry. Two bow strings twanged simultaneously.
Corrie's target pitched forward with an arrow through the heart.
Jerry's aim had not been so true. His victim clutched at the shaft
sunk deep in his throat.</p>

<p>Jerry jumped into the trail, and the wounded Jap tried to
unsling his rifle. He had almost succeeded when Jerry struck him a
terrific blow on the chin. He went down, and the pilot leaped upon
him with drawn knife. Twice he drove the blade into the man's
heart. The fellow twitched convulsively and lay still.</p>

<p>Jerry looked up to see Corrie disentangling the slung rifle from
the body of the other Jap. He saw her stand above her victim like
an avenging goddess. Three times she drove the bayonet into the
breast of the soldier. The American watched the girl's face. It was
not distorted by rage or hate or vengeance. It was illumined by a
divine light of exaltation.</p>

<p>She turned toward Jerry. "That is what I saw them do to my
father. I feel happier now. I only wish that he had been
alive."</p>

<p>"You are magnificent," said Jerry.</p>

<p>They took possession of the other rifle and the belts and
ammunition of the dead men. Then Jerry dragged the bodies into the
underbrush. Corrie helped him.</p>

<p>"You can cut a notch in your shootin' iron, woman," said Jerry,
grinning. "You have killed your man."</p>

<p>"I have not killed a man," contradicted the girl. "I have killed
a Jap."</p>

<p>"'Haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,'" quoted Jerry.</p>

<p>"You think a woman should not hate," said Corrie. "You could
never like a woman who hated."</p>

<p>"I like you," said Jerry gently, solemnly.</p>

<p>"And I like you, Jerry. You have been so very fine, all of you.
You haven't made me feel like a girl, but like a man among
men."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" exclaimed Jerry, and they both laughed.</p>

<p>"For you, Jerry, I shall stop hating&mdash;as soon as I have
killed all the Japs in the world."</p>

<p>Jerry smiled back at her. "A regular Avenging Angel," he said.
"Let's see&mdash;who were The Avenging Angels?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Corrie. "I've never met any angels."</p>

<p>"Now I remember," said Jerry. "A long while ago there was an
association of Mormons, the Danite Band. They were known as The
Avenging Angels."</p>

<p>"The Mormons are the people who have a lot of wives, aren't
they? Are you a Mormon?"</p>

<p>"Perish the thought. I'm not that courageous. Neither are the
present day Mormons. Just imagine being married to a WAC sergeant,
a welder, and a steamfitter!"</p>

<p>"And an Avenging Angel?" laughed Corrie.</p>

<p>He didn't answer. He just looked at her, and Corrie wished that
she had not said it. Or did she wish that she had not said it?</p>

<p><br><br>Tarzan, swinging through the trees overlooking the trail,
stopped suddenly and froze into immobility. Ahead of him he saw a
man squatting on a platform built in a tree that gave a view of the
trail for some distance in the direction from which Tarzan had
come. The man was heavily bearded and heavily armed. He was a white
man. Evidently he was a sentry watching a trail along which an
enemy might approach.</p>

<p>Tarzan moved cautiously away from the trail. Had he not been
fully aware of the insensibility of civilized man he would have
marvelled that the fellow had not noted his approach. The stupidest
of the beasts would have heard him or smelled him or seen him.</p>

<p>Making a detour, he circled the sentry; and a minute or two
later came to the edge of a small mountain meadow and looked down
upon a rude and untidy camp. A score or so of men were lying around
in the shade of trees. A bottle passed from hand to hand among
them, or from mouth to mouth. Drinking with them were a number of
women. Most of these appeared to be Eurasians. With a single
exception, the men were heavily bearded. This was a young man who
sat with them, taking an occasional pull at the bottle. The men
carried pistols and knives, and each had a rifle close at hand. It
was not a nice looking company.</p>

<p>Tarzan decided that the less he had to do with these people the
better. And then the branch on which he sat snapped suddenly, and
he fell to the ground within a hundred feet of them. His head
struck something hard, and he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When he came to he was lying beneath a tree, his wrists and
ankles bound. Men and women were squatting or standing around him.
When they saw that he had regained consciousness, one of the men
spoke to him in Dutch. Tarzan understood him, but he shook his head
as though he did not.</p>

<p>The fellow had asked him who he was and what he had been doing
spying on them. Another tried French, which was the first spoken
language of civilized man that he had learned; but he still shook
his head. The young man tried English. Tarzan pretended that he did
not understand; and addressed them in Swahili, the language of a
Mohammedan Bantu people of Zanzibar and the East coast of Africa,
knowing that they would not understand it.</p>

<p>"Sounds like Japanese," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"It ain't though," said one who understood that language.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Chinese," suggested another.</p>

<p>"He looks about as much like a Chink as you do," said the first
speaker.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's a wild man. No clothes, bow and arrows. Fell out of
a tree like a monkey."</p>

<p>"He's a damned spy."</p>

<p>"What good's a spy who can't talk any civilized language?"</p>

<p>They thought this over, and it seemed to remove their suspicion
that their prisoner might be a spy, at least for the moment. They
had more important business to attend to, as was soon
demonstrated.</p>

<p>"Oh, to hell with him," said a bleary-eyed giant. "I'm getting
dry."</p>

<p>He walked back in the direction of the trees beneath which they
had been lolling&mdash;in the direction of the trees and the
bottle&mdash;and the others followed. All but the young man with
the smooth face. He still squatted near Tarzan, his back toward his
retreating companions. When they were at a safer distance and their
attention held by the bottle, he spoke. He spoke in a low whisper
and in English.</p>

<p>"I am sure that you are either an American or an Englishman," he
said. "Possibly one of the Americans from the bomber that was shot
down some time ago. If you are, you can trust me. I am practically
a prisoner here myself. But don't let them see you talking to me.
If you decide that you can trust me, you can make some sign that
you understand me.</p>

<p>"You have fallen into the hands of a band of cutthroats. With
few exceptions they are criminals who were released from jail and
armed when the Japs invaded the island. Most of the women are also
criminals who were serving jail sentences. The others are also from
the bottom of the social barrel&mdash;the ultimate dregs.</p>

<p>"These people escaped to the hills as the Japs took over. They
made no attempt to aid our armed forces. They thought only of their
own skins. After my regiment surrendered, I managed to escape. I
ran across this outfit; and supposing it to be a loyal guerrilla
band, I joined it. Learning my background, they would have killed
me had it not been that a couple of them are men I had befriended
in times past. But they don't trust me.</p>

<p>"You see, there are loyal guerrillas hiding in the hills who
would kill these traitors as gladly as they'd kill Japs. And these
fellows are afraid I'd get in touch with them and reveal the
location of this camp.</p>

<p>"About the worst these people have done so far is to trade with
the enemy, but they are going to turn you over to the Japs. They
decided on that before you regained consciousness. They also
thought that you were one of the American fliers. The Japs would
pay a good price for you.</p>

<p>"These fellows distill a vile spirit which they call schnapps.
What they don't drink themselves they use to barter with the Japs
and natives. They get juniper berries, ammunition, and rice, among
other things, from the Japs. That the Japs let them have ammunition
indicates that they consider them friendly. However, it is little
more than an armed truce; as neither trusts the other to any great
extent. Natives are the go-betweens who deliver the schnapps and
bring the payment."</p>

<p>Tarzan, knowing now that his fate had already been decided,
realized that nothing would be gained by further attempts to
deceive the young man. Also, he had gained a good impression of the
man, and was inclined to believe that he was trustworthy. He
glanced in the direction of the others. They were all intent upon a
loudmouthed quarrel between two of their fellows, and were paying
no attention to him and his companion.</p>

<p>"I am English," he said.</p>

<p>The young man grinned.</p>

<p>"Thanks for trusting me," he said. "My name is Tak van der Bos.
I am a reserve officer."</p>

<p>"My name is Clayton. Would you like to get away from these
people?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But what good would it do? Where could I go? I'd certainly
fall into the hands of the Japs eventually, if a tiger didn't get
me instead. If I knew where one of our guerrilla outfits was
located, I'd sure take the chance. But I don't."</p>

<p>"There are five in my party," said Tarzan. "We are trying to
reach the southern end of the island. If we are lucky, we hope to
commandeer a boat and try to reach Australia."</p>

<p>"A rather ambitious plan," said van der Bos. "It's more than
twelve hundred miles to the nearest point on the Australian
continent. And it's five hundred miles to the southern end of this
island."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan. "We know, but we are going to take the
chance. We all feel that it would be better to die trying it than
to hide in the woods like a lot of hunted rabbits for the
duration."</p>

<p>Van der Bos was silent for a few moments, thinking. Presently he
looked up. "It is the right thing to do," he said. "I'd like to
come with you. I think I can help you. I can find a boat much
nearer than you plan on traveling. I know where there are friendly
natives who will help us. But first we've got to get away from
these fellows, and that will not be easy. There is only one trail
into this little valley, and that is guarded day and night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him. In fact I passed close to him. I can pass him
again as easily. But you are different. I do not think that you
could though. If you can get me a knife tonight, I will get you
past the sentry."</p>

<p>"I'll try. If they get drunk enough, it should be easy. Then
I'll cut your bonds, and we can have a go at it."</p>

<p>"I can break these bonds whenever I wish," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Van der Bos did not comment on this statement.</p>

<p>This fellow, he thought, is very sure of himself. Maybe a little
too sure. And the Dutchman began to wonder if he had been wise in
saying that he would go with him. He knew, of course, that no man
could break those bonds. Maybe the fellow couldn't make good on his
boast that he could pass the sentry, either.</p>

<p>"Do they watch you very carefully at night?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They don't watch me at all. This is tiger country. Had you
thought of that yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But we shall have to take that chance."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SLAPPED around, prodded in the backsides with
bayonets, spit on, Rosetti and Bubonovitch were two rage-filled and
unhappy men long before they reached the native village. Here they
were taken into a native house, trussed up, and thrown to the floor
in a corner of the room. There they were left to their own devices,
which consisted almost wholly of profanity. After describing the
progenitors of all Japs from Hirohito down, and especially those of
Lt. Kumajiro Tada, in the picturesque and unprintable patois of
Cicero, Brooklyn, and the Army, they worked back up to Hirohito
again.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" demanded Bubonovitch. "We're just working up
blood pressure."</p>

<p>"I'm workin' up my hate," said Rosetti. "I know just how dat
Corrie dame feels, now. I sure love to hate 'em."</p>

<p>"Make the most of it while you can," advised Bubonovitch. "That
ocher looie's going to lop your hater off in the morning."</p>

<p>"Geeze," said Rosetti. "I don't wanna die, Bum."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, Shrimp."</p>

<p>"Geeze! I'm scairt."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"Let's pray, Bum."</p>

<p>"Okay. The last time you prayed to Her, She sent Tarzan."</p>

<p>"I'm just leavin' it to Her. I don't care how She works it."</p>

<p>There was not much sleep for them that night. Their bonds cut
into wrists and ankles. Their throats were dry and parched. They
were given neither food nor water. The night was an eternity. But
at last it ended.</p>

<p>"Geeze! I wisht they'd come an' get it over wit'. Thinkin' about
it is the worst part."</p>

<p>"Thinking about my wife and baby is the hardest part for me. My
wife and I had such great plans. She'll never know what happened to
me, and I'm glad for that. All she'll ever know is that my plane
took off from somewhere for somewhere and never came back. Did you
pray a lot, Shrimp?"</p>

<p>"Most all night."</p>

<p>"So did I."</p>

<p>"Who did you pray to, Bum?"</p>

<p>"To God."</p>

<p>"One of 'em must have heard us."</p>

<p>The sound of scuffing feet ascending the ladder to the house
reached their ears.</p>

<p>"I guess this is it," said Bubonovitch. "Can you take it,
Shrimp?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Well, so long, fellow."</p>

<p>"So long, Bum."</p>

<p>A couple of soldiers entered the room. They cut away the bonds,
and dragged the two men to their feet. But they couldn't stand.
Both of them staggered and fell to the floor. The soldiers kicked
them in head and stomach, laughing and jabbering. Finally they
dragged them to the doorway and slid them down the ladder one by
one, letting them fall most of the way to the ground.</p>

<p>Tada came over and examined them. "Are you ready to answer my
questions?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Get up!" snapped the Jap.</p>

<p>Circulation was returning to their numbed feet. They tried to
rise, and finally succeeded. But they staggered like drunken men
when they walked. They were taken to the center of the village. The
soldiers and the natives formed a circle around them. Tada stood
beside them with drawn sword. He made them kneel and bend their
heads forward. Bubonovitch was to be first.</p>

<p>"I guess They didn't hear us, Shrimp," he said.</p>

<p>"Who didn't hear you?" demanded Tada.</p>

<p>"None of your goddam business, Jap," snapped Bubonovitch. Tada
swung his sword.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>When the camp quieted down and most of the men and women slept
in a drunken stupor, van der Bos crept to Tarzan's side. "I've got
a knife," he said. "I'll cut your bonds."</p>

<p>"They've been off a long while," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You broke them?" demanded the Dutchman in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes. Now come along and come quietly. Give me the knife."</p>

<p>A short distance inside the forest, Tarzan halted. "Wait here,"
he whispered. Then he was gone. He swung quietly into the trees,
advancing slowly, stopping often to listen and to search the air
with his nostrils. Finally he located the sentry and climbed into
the same tree in which had been built the platform on which the man
was squatting. He was poised directly over the fellow's head. His
eyes bored down through the darkness. They picked out the form and
position of the doomed man. Then Tarzan dove for him head-first,
the knife in his hand. The only sound was the thud of the two
bodies on the platform. The sentry died in silence, his throat cut
from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Tarzan pitched the body to the trail and followed it down with
the man's rifle. He walked back until he came to van der Bos. "Come
on," he said. "You can get past the sentry now."</p>

<p>When they came to the body, van der Bos stumbled over it. "You
certainly made a neat job of it," he said.</p>

<p>"Not so neat," said Tarzan. "He spurted blood all over me. I'll
be walking bait for stripes until we reach some water. Take his
pistol belt and ammunition. Here's his rifle. Now let's get
going."</p>

<p>They moved rapidly along the trail, Tarzan in the lead.
Presently they came to a small stream, and both washed the blood
from them, for the Dutchman had acquired some while removing the
belt from the corpse.</p>

<p>No tiger delayed them, and they soon came to the fork at which
Tarzan had last seen his companions. There was no scent of them,
and the two men followed along the trail the others were to have
taken. It was daylight when they heard a shot close and in front of
them.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Jerry and Corrie decided to remain where they were, waiting for
Tarzan. They thought that he would soon return. It was well for
their peace of mind that they did not know the misadventure that
had befallen him. For greater safety they had climbed into a tree
where they perched precariously and uncomfortably some twenty feet
above the ground. Jerry worried about the fate of Bubonovitch and
Rosetti, and finally decided to do something about it. The night
had dragged on interminably, and still Tarzan had not returned.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's coming," said Jerry. "Something must have
happened to him. Anyway, I'm not going to wait any longer. I'm
going on to see if I can locate Bubonovitch and Rosetti. Then if
Tarzan does come, we'll at least know where they are; and maybe
together we can work out a plan to free them. You stay here until I
come back. You're safer here than you would be down on the
ground."</p>

<p>"And suppose you don't come back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Corrie. This is the toughest decision I've ever
had to make&mdash;to decide between you and those two boys. But I
have made the decision, and I hope you'll understand. They are
prisoners of the Japs, and we all know how Japs treat their
prisoners. You are free and well armed."</p>

<p>"There was only one decision you could make. I knew that you
would go after them, and I am going with you."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," said Jerry. "You stay right where you are."</p>

<p>"Is that an order?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He heard a faint suggestion of a laugh. "When you give an order
on your ship, Captain, even a general would have to obey you. But
you are not captain of this tree. Here we go!" and Corrie slipped
from the branch on which she had been sitting and climbed to the
ground.</p>

<p>Jerry followed her. "You win," he said. "I might have known
better than to try to boss a woman."</p>

<p>"Two guns are better than one," said Corrie, "and I'm a good
shot. Anyway, I'd sat on that darned limb until I was about ready
to scream."</p>

<p>They trudged along the trail side by side. Often their arms
touched; and once Corrie slipped on a muddy stretch, and Jerry put
an arm around her to keep her from falling. He thought, I used to
paw that girl back in Oklahoma City, but it never gave me a thrill
like this. I think you have fallen for this little rascal, Jerry. I
think you have it bad.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and sometimes they bumped into trees where the
trail curved; so their progress was slow. They could only grope
their way along, praying that dawn would soon break.</p>

<p>"What a day we've had," said Jerry. "All we need now, to make it
perfect, is to run into a tiger."</p>

<p>"I don't think we need worry about that," said Corrie. "I've
never heard of a tiger attacking a white man with a rifle. They
seem to know. If we leave them alone, they'll leave us alone."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right. They probably know when a man is armed.
When I was riding after cattle back home, I'd see plenty of coyotes
when I didn't have a gun. But if I was packing a gun, I'd never see
one."</p>

<p>"'Back home,'" repeated Corrie. "You poor boys are so very, very
far from back home. It makes me very sad to think of it.
Bubonovitch with that pretty wife and baby way on the other side of
the world. Missing the best years of their life."</p>

<p>"War is rotten," said Jerry. "If we ever get home, I'll bet
we'll do something about the damned Nips and Krauts that'll keep
'em from starting wars for a heck of a long time. There'll be ten
or twelve millions of us who are good and fed up on war. We're
going to elect an artillery captain friend of mine governor of
Oklahoma and then send him to the senate. He hates war. I don't
know a soldier who doesn't, and if all America will send enough
soldiers to Congress we'll get some place."</p>

<p>"Is Oklahoma nice?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"It's the finest state in the Union," admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>The new day was kicking off the covers and crawling out of bed.
It would soon be wide awake, for close to the equator the
transition from night to day takes place quickly. There is no long
drawn out dawning.</p>

<p>"What a relief," said Corrie. "I was very tired of night."</p>

<p>"Cripes!" exclaimed Jerry. "Look!" He cocked his rifle and stood
still. Standing in the trail directly in front of them was a
tiger.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" warned Corrie.</p>

<p>"I don't intend to if he'll just mind his own business. This
dinky little .25 caliber Jap rifle wouldn't do anything more than
irritate him, and I never did like to irritate tigers so early in
the morning."</p>

<p>"I wish he'd go away," said Corrie. "He looks hungry."</p>

<p>"Maybe he hasn't heard of that theory of yours."</p>

<p>The tiger, a large male, stood perfectly still for several
seconds, watching them; then it turned and leaped into the
underbrush.</p>

<p>"Whee-oo!" exclaimed Jerry with a long sigh of relief. "My heart
and my stomach were both trying to get into my mouth at the same
time. Was I scared!"</p>

<p>"My knees feel weak," said Corrie. "I think I'll sit down."</p>

<p>"Wait!" cautioned Jerry. "Listen! Aren't those voices?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just a little way ahead."</p>

<p>They moved forward very cautiously. The forest ended at the edge
of a shallow valley, and the two looked down upon a little kampong
scarcely a hundred yards from them. They saw natives and Jap
soldiers.</p>

<p>"This must be where the boys are," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"There they are!" whispered Corrie. "Oh, God! He's going to kill
them!"</p>

<p>Tada swung his sword. Jerry's rifle spit, and Lt. Kumajiro Tada
lunged forward, sprawling in front of the men he had been about to
kill. Then Corrie fired, and a Jap soldier who was rushing toward
the two prisoners died. The two kept up a fusillade that knocked
over soldier after soldier and put the village into panic.</p>

<p>Tarzan, hurrying forward at the first shot, was soon at their
side; and van der Bos joined them a moment later, adding another
rifle and a pistol. Tarzan took the latter.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti, taking advantage of the confusion in
the kampong, seized rifles and ammunition from two of the dead
soldiers and backed toward the forest, firing as they went. Rosetti
had also acquired a couple of hand grenades, which he stuffed into
his pockets.</p>

<p>A Jap sergeant was trying to collect his men, forming them up
behind a house. Suddenly they charged, screaming. Rosetti threw his
grenades in quick succession among them; then he and Bubonovitch
turned and ran for the forest.</p>

<p>The firing had ceased before the two sergeants reached the
little group just within the forest. Rosetti's grenades had put an
end to this part of World War II, at least temporarily. The Japs
were definitely demoralized or dead.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" said Rosetti. "They did hear us."</p>

<p>"They sure did," agreed Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Who heard you?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"God and the Blessed Mary," explained Rosetti. The little party
had been so intent upon the battle that they had scarcely looked at
one another while it was progressing. Now they relaxed a little and
looked around. When Corrie and Tak van der Bos faced one another
they were speechless for a moment. Then they both exclaimed
simultaneously: "Corrie!" "Tak!"</p>

<p>"Darling!" cried Corrie, throwing her arms around the young
Dutchman. Jerry was not amused.</p>

<p>Then followed introductions and brief resumes of their various
adventures. While the others talked, Tarzan watched the kampong.
The Japs seemed utterly confused. They had lost their officer and
their ranking non-commissioned officers. Without them, the ordinary
private soldier was too stupid to think or plan for himself.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Jerry. "I think we can take that village and
wipe out the rest of the Japs if we rush them now while they are
demoralized and without a leader. We have five rifles, and there
aren't more than a dozen Japs left who are in any shape to
fight."</p>

<p>Jerry turned to the others. "How about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Bubonovitch. "What are we waiting for?"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE fight was short and sweet, and some of the
Japs were helpful&mdash;they blew themselves up with their own
grenades. Corrie had been left behind in the forest. But she hadn't
stayed there. Jerry had no more than reached the center of the
kampong when he saw her fighting at his side.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti went berserk, and their bayonets were
dripping Jap blood when the fight was over. They had learned to
hate.</p>

<p>The natives cowered in their houses. They had collaborated with
the Japs and they expected the worst, but they were not molested.
They were, however, required to furnish food and prepare it.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Jerry questioned several of them, Corrie and Tak
acting as interpreters. They learned that this had been an advance
post of a much larger force that was stationed about twenty-five
kilometers down in the direction of the southwest coast. It had
expected to be relieved in a day or two.</p>

<p>They also learned that there was a group of guerrillas farther
along in the mountains toward the southeast. But none of the
natives knew just where or how far. They seemed terribly afraid of
the guerrillas.</p>

<p>Amat tried to curry favor with the newcomers. He was a confirmed
opportunist, a natural born politician. He was wondering if it
would advantage him to hurry to the main camp of the Japs and
report the presence of these men and the havoc they had wreaked.
But he abandoned the idea, as he would have had to travel through
bad tiger country. It was well for Amat that neither Bubonovitch
nor Rosetti knew the part he had played leading up to their
capture.</p>

<p>But perhaps the two sergeants would have been inclined toward
leniency, for they were very happy. Their prayers had wrought a
miracle and they had been saved by the little margin of a split
second. That was something to be happy about. In addition to this,
they had indulged in a very successful orgy of revenge. In the
blood of their enemies they had washed away the blows and insults
and humiliation that had been heaped upon them.</p>

<p>"Geeze! Bum, we sure had a close shave."</p>

<p>"I couldn't see; because I was looking at the ground," said
Bubonovitch, "but Corrie said that Jap looie was swinging his sword
when Jerry nicked him. It was that close. But we sure evened things
up, eh, Shrimp?"</p>

<p>"How many did you get?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Maybe three or four. I was just shooting at
everything in sight. But you certainly hit the jackpot with those
two grenades. Boy! was that something?"</p>

<p>"Say, did you see dat dame get right into the fightin'? She's
keen."</p>

<p>"Migawd! Shrimp, are you falling for a skirt?"</p>

<p>"I ain't fallin' for no skoit, but she's all to the good. I
ain't never see a dame like her before. I didn't know they come
like dat. I'll go to bat for her any old time."</p>

<p>"The last of the misogynists," said Bubonovitch. "Jerry took the
count a long while ago, and has he fallen hard!"</p>

<p>"But did you see her fall on dat Dutchman's neck? You should
have saw Jerry's face. Dat's de trouble wit' dames&mdash;even dis
one. Dey just can't help causin' wot dem Hawaiians back on De Rock
calls pilikia. We was just one happy family until her old boy
friend blew into the pitcher."</p>

<p>"Maybe he is just an old friend," suggested Bubonovitch. "I
noticed that when the fight was on, she fought right at Jerry's
side."</p>

<p>Rosetti shook his head. He had already made a great concession,
but his prejudice was too deep-rooted to permit him to go all out
for the ladies. He was for Corrie, but with mental reservations.
"Do you throw your arms around an old friend's neck and yell,
'Darling!'? I ask."</p>

<p>"That all depends. You are an old friend of mine, Shrimp; but I
can't imagine throwing my arms around your neck and calling you
darling."</p>

<p>"You'd get a poke in de snoot."</p>

<p>"But if you were Ginger Rogers!"</p>

<p>"Geeze! What gams! I never seen gams before until I see Lady in
de Dark. Boy!"</p>

<p>Tarzan and Jerry were holding a consultation of war. Corrie and
Tak were recounting to each other their adventures of the past two
years.</p>

<p>"I'd like to do a little reconnoitering before we move on," said
Tarzan. "I'd like to do it alone, because I can move so much faster
than the rest of you. But if you remain here, that Jap relief may
show up before I come back. There will probably be about twenty of
them, as there were in this detail. That's pretty heavy odds
against you."</p>

<p>"I'll chance it," said Jerry, "if the others are willing. We're
five guns. We've got enough Jap ammunition to fight a
war&mdash;lots of grenades. We know the trail they'll come in on.
All we have to do is keep a sentry far enough out on it to give us
plenty of warning. Then we can plaster them with grenades from
ambush. Let's see what the others think." He called them over and
explained the situation.</p>

<p>"Geeze!" said Shrimp. "On'y four to one? It's a cinch. We done
it before. We can do it again!"</p>

<p>"Atta boy!" said Jerry.</p>

<p>"The main camp is fifteen or sixteen miles from here," said
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"They'll probably take most of the day to make the march, for
they won't be in any hurry. But we'd better start being on the
lookout for them this afternoon. They might come today."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Jerry. "Suppose you go on out along the
trail for about a mile. You'll hear them coming before they get in
sight of you; then you can beat it back here, and we'll be ready
for them."</p>

<p>"Here's an idea," said Corrie. "Suppose we load up with hand
grenades and all go out and take positions in trees along both
sides of the trail. If we're spread out enough, we can get the
whole detachment in range before we open up. We should be able to
get them all that way."</p>

<p>"Great!" said Jerry.</p>

<p>"What a bloodthirsty person you've become, Corrie!" exclaimed
Tak, grinning.</p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"It's a good idea," said Tarzan. "We know the enemy is coming.
We don't know just when; so we should always be prepared for him.
You can come in as soon as it is dark, as I'm sure they won't march
at night. There is no reason why they should. But I think you
should post a guard all night."</p>

<p>"Definitely," agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>Tarzan, the matter settled, walked away and disappeared into the
forest.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Hooft awoke bleary eyed and with a terrific headache. His mouth
tasted like the bottom of a mouse cage. He was never in a very good
humor at best. Now his disposition was vile to murderous. He
bellowed to awaken the others, and soon the camp was astir. The
slovenly, slatternly women began to prepare breakfast for the
men.</p>

<p>Hooft stood up and stretched. Then he looked over the camp.
"Where's the prisoner?" he shouted.</p>

<p>Everyone else looked around. There was no prisoner. "The other
one's gone, too," said a man.</p>

<p>Hooft roared out lurid profanities and horrid obscenities.
"Who's on guard?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Hugo was to wake me up at midnight to relieve him," said
another. "He didn't."</p>

<p>"Go out and see what's become of him," ordered Hooft. "I'll skin
him alive for this. I'll cut his heart out&mdash;falling asleep and
letting both those men escape!"</p>

<p>The man was gone but a few minutes. When he returned, he was
grinning. "Somebody beat you to it, Chief," he said to Hooft.
"Hugo's a mess. His throat's been cut from ear to ear."</p>

<p>"It must have been that wild man," said Sarina.</p>

<p>"Van der Bos must have cut his bonds," said Hooft. "Wait 'til I
get hold of him."</p>

<p>"If you ever do," said Sarina. "He'll go right to the nearest
guerrillas, and pretty soon we'll have them down on us."</p>

<p>One of the men had walked over to the spot where Tarzan had
lain. He returned with the bonds and handed them to Hooft. "These
weren't cut," he said. "They were broken."</p>

<p>"No man could have broken them," said Hooft.</p>

<p>"The wild man did," said Sarina.</p>

<p>"I'll wild man him," growled Hooft. "Let's eat and get going.
We're going after them. You women stay here." No one demurred. No
one ever argued with Hooft when he was in a bad humor, with the
exception of Sarina. She was the only one of the murderous crew
whom Hooft feared, but Sarina did not argue now. She had no desire
to go tramping through the forest.</p>

<p>The outlaws were good trackers, and Tarzan and van der Bos had
made no effort to obliterate their spoor. It was plain going for
Hooft and his gang of cutthroats.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Jerry and his little company gathered all the grenades they
could carry and went out into the forest in the direction from
which the Jap relief would have to come. Through van der Bos, Jerry
warned the natives not to remove any of the rifles and ammunition
which they left behind. "Tell 'em we'll burn the village if we find
anything gone when we return."</p>

<p>Van der Bos embellished this threat by assuring the chief that
in addition to burning the village they would cut off the heads of
all the villagers. The chief was impressed.</p>

<p>So was Amat. He had intended following the strangers out into
the forest to spy on them. When he discovered how bloodthirsty they
were, he changed his mind. They might catch him at his spying.
Instead, he went out on another trail to gather durian fruit.</p>

<p>And so it was that while he was thus engaged among the branches
of a durian tree, and negligent, Hooft discovered him. Hooft
ordered him down. Amat was terrified. Hooft and his party were as
villainous looking a gang as ever Amat had laid eyes on.</p>

<p>Hooft questioned him, asking if he had seen the two fugitives
and describing them. Amat was relieved. He could give these men a
great deal of information and thus win safety. They would reward
him at least with his life.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," he said. "They came to our village with two
others this morning. One was a woman. They rescued two men that the
Japanese had taken prisoners; then the six killed all the
Japanese."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"They went out into the forest on another trail. I do not know
why. But they are returning this evening. They said so. Now may I
go?"</p>

<p>"And warn those people? I'll say not."</p>

<p>"Better kill him," said one of the men. He spoke Amat's dialect,
and Amat trembled so that he nearly fell down. He did drop to his
knees and beg for his life.</p>

<p>"You do what we say, and we won't kill you," said Hooft.</p>

<p>"Amat will do anything you want," said the frightened man. "I
can tell you something more. The Japanese would pay well for the
girl that was in our village today. The Japanese who were stationed
there talked about her. The Japanese have been hunting for her for
two years. Maybe I can help you get her. I will do anything for
you."</p>

<p>Amat did not know how he could help them get Corrie, but he was
willing to promise anything. If he couldn't get her, maybe he could
run off into the forest until these terrible men had gone away.
They were more terrifying even than the Japanese who had cuffed and
kicked him.</p>

<p>Further discussion was interrupted by the sound of explosions
beyond the village, somewhere off in the forest, but not far. "Hand
grenades," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a regular battle," said Hooft.</p>

<p>The louder detonations were punctuated by the ping of rifle
shots. "Those are Jap .25's," said Grotius.</p>

<p>Rising above the detonations were the piercing screams of men in
agony. The whole thing lasted but a few minutes. There were a few
scattered rifle shots at the end, then silence. One could almost
reconstruct the scene from the sounds. There had been a sharp
engagement. Between whom? wondered the outlaws. One side had been
annihilated. Which one? The final rifle shots had liquidated the
wounded.</p>

<p>The victors would certainly come to the village. Hooft and his
followers approached the edge of the forest and lay in concealment.
The little valley and the kampong were in plain sight below
them.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. Four white men and a white girl
emerged from the forest trail. They were heavily laden with all the
weapons and ammunition they could carry. They were talking
excitedly. The men went to one of the native houses, the girl to
another.</p>

<p>Hooft thought quickly. He must find a way to get the girl
without risking a brush with her companions. Hooft, like all
bullies, was yellow. He could stab or shoot a man in the back, but
he couldn't face an armed opponent. He preferred to accomplish his
ends by intrigue and cunning.</p>

<p>He turned to Amat. "Take this message to the girl. Tell her an
old friend of hers is waiting at the edge of the forest. He doesn't
want to come into the village until he is sure her companions are
loyal to the Dutch. Tell her to come alone to the edge of the
forest and talk with him. He is an old friend of her father. And,
Amat, don't tell anyone else we are here. If anyone but the girl
comes, we won't be here; but we'll come back some day and kill you.
You can tell the girl, too, that if she does not come alone, I
won't be here. Repeat the message to me."</p>

<p>Amat repeated it, and Hooft motioned him on his way. Amat felt
like a condemned man who has just received a pardon, or at least a
reprieve. He slipped quietly into the village, and went to the foot
of the ladder leading to the door of the house where Corrie was
quartered. He called to her, and a native girl came to the doorway.
When she saw Amat, her lip curled in contempt. "Go away, pig!" she
said.</p>

<p>"I have a message for the white woman," said Amat.</p>

<p>Corrie overheard and came to the doorway. "What message have you
for me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is a very private message," said Amat. "I cannot shout
it."</p>

<p>"Come up here, then."</p>

<p>Lara, the native girl, turned up her nose as Amat passed into
the house. She knew him for a liar and a sneak, but she did not
warn Corrie. What business was it of hers?</p>

<p>Amat delivered his message. Corrie pondered. "What was the man
like?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He is a white man with a beard," said Amat. "That is all I
know."</p>

<p>"Is he alone?"</p>

<p>Amat thought quickly, if she knows there are twenty of them, she
will not go; then some day the man will come and kill me. "He is
alone," said Amat.</p>

<p>Corrie picked up her rifle and descended the ladder to the
ground. The men of her party were still in the house they had taken
over. They were cleaning and oiling the rifles they had acquired.
There were no natives about. Only Amat and Lara saw the white girl
leave the kampong and enter the forest.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN had not been able to gather much
information about the guerrillas from the natives. They had heard
it rumored that there was one band near a certain volcano about
sixty-five kilometers to the southeast. They were able to describe
the appearance of this volcano and various landmarks that might
help to guide Tarzan to it, and with this meager information he had
set out.</p>

<p>He traveled until night fell, and then lay up until morning in a
tree. His only weapons were his bow and arrows and his knife. He
had not wished to be burdened with the Jap rifle and ammunition. In
the morning he gathered some fruit and shot a hare for his
breakfast.</p>

<p>The country through which he passed was extremely wild and
destitute of any signs of man. Nothing could have suited Tarzan
better. He liked the companions whom he had left behind; but
notwithstanding all his contacts with men, he had never become
wholly gregarious. His people were the wild things of the forest
and jungle and plain. With them, he was always at home. He liked to
watch them and study them. He often knew them better than they knew
themselves.</p>

<p>He passed many monkeys. They scolded him until he spoke to them
in their own language. They knew their world, and through them he
kept upon the right route to the volcano. They told him in what
direction to go to reach the next landmark of which the natives had
spoken&mdash;a little lake, a mountain meadow, the crater of an
extinct volcano.</p>

<p>When he thought that he should be approaching his destination,
he asked some monkeys if there were white men near a volcano. He
called it 'argo ved'&mdash;fire mountain. They said there were, and
told him how to reach their camp. One old monkey said, "Kreeg-ah!
Tarmangani sord. Tarmangani bundolo," and he mimicked the aiming of
a rifle, and said, "Boo! Boo!" Beware! White men bad. White men
kill.</p>

<p>He found the camp in a little gorge, but before he came to it he
saw a sentry guarding the only approach. Tarzan came out into the
open and walked toward the man, a bearded Dutchman. The fellow
cocked his rifle and waited until Tarzan came to within twenty-five
or thirty yards of him; then he halted him.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman. I should like to talk with your chief."</p>

<p>The man had been appraising Tarzan with some show of
astonishment. "Stay where you are," he ordered. "Don't come any
closer;" then he called down into the gorge: "de Lettenhove!
There's a wild man up here wants to talk to you."</p>

<p>Tarzan repressed a smile. He had heard this description of
himself many times before, but never with quite such blatant
disregard of his feelings. Then he recalled that he had spoken to
the man in English and said that he was an Englishman, while the
fellow had called to de Lettenhove in Dutch, doubtless believing
that the "wild man" did not understand that language. He would
continue to let them believe so.</p>

<p>Presently, three men came up out of the valley. All were heavily
armed. They were bearded, tough looking men. They wore patched,
tattered, nondescript clothing, partly civilian, partly military,
partly crudely fashioned from the skins of animals. One of them
wore a disreputable tunic with the two stars of a first lieutenant
on the shoulder tabs. This was de Lettenhove. He spoke to the
sentry in Dutch.</p>

<p>"What was this man doing?"</p>

<p>"He just walked up to me. He made no effort to avoid me or hide
from me. He is probably a harmless half-wit, but what the devil
he's doing here gets me. He says he is English. He spoke to me in
that language."</p>

<p>De Lettenhove turned to Tarzan. "Who are you? What are you doing
here?" he asked in English.</p>

<p>"My name is Clayton. I am a colonel in the RAF. I understood
that a company of Dutch guerrillas was camped here. I wanted to
talk with their commanding officer. Are you he? I know that there
are also bands of outlaws in the mountains, but the only way I
could find out which you are was to come and talk with you. I had
to take that chance."</p>

<p>"I am not the commanding officer," said de Lettenhove. "Capt.
van Prins is in command, but he is not here today. We expect him
back tomorrow. Just what do you want to see him about? I can assure
you," he added with a smile, "that we are outlaws only in the eyes
of the Japs and the native collaborationists."</p>

<p>"I came because I wanted to make contact with people I could
trust, who could give me information as to the location of Jap
outposts and native villages whose people are friendly to the
Dutch. I wish to avoid the former and, perhaps, obtain help from
the latter. I am trying to reach the coast, where I shall try to
obtain a boat and escape from the island."</p>

<p>De Lettenhove turned to one of the men who had accompanied him
from the camp in the valley. "I was commencing to believe him," he
said in Dutch, "until he sprang that one about getting a boat and
escaping from the island. He must think we're damn fools to fall
for any such silly explanation of his presence here. He's probably
a damn German spy. We'll just hang onto him until van Prins gets
back." Then, to Tarzan, in English: "You say you are an English
officer. Of course you have some means of identification?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"May I ask why an English officer is running around in the
mountains of Sumatra naked and armed with bow and arrows and a
knife?" His tone was ironical. "My friend, you certainly can't
expect us to believe you. You will remain here until Capt. van
Prins returns."</p>

<p>"As a prisoner?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"As a prisoner. Come, we will take you down to camp."</p>

<p>The camp was neat and well policed. There were no women. There
was a row of thatched huts laid out with military precision. The
red, white, and blue flag of the Netherlands flew from a staff in
front of one of the huts. Twenty or thirty men were variously
occupied about the camp, most of them cleaning rifles or pistols.
Tattered and torn and shabby were their clothes, but their weapons
were immaculate. That this was a well disciplined military camp
Tarzan was now convinced. These were no outlaws. He knew that he
could trust these men.</p>

<p>His entrance into the camp caused a mild sensation. The men
stopped their work to stare at him. Some came and questioned those
who accompanied him.</p>

<p>"What you got there?" asked one. "The Wild Man of Borneo?"</p>

<p>"He says he's an RAF colonel, but I've got two guesses. He's
either a harmless half-wit or a German spy. I'm inclined to believe
the latter. He doesn't talk like a half-wit."</p>

<p>"Does he speak German?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"I'll try him." He spoke to Tarzan in German; and the latter,
impelled by the ridiculousness of the situation, rattled off a
reply in impeccable German.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said the two-guesser.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan turned to de Lettenhove. "I told you that I had no
means of identification," he said. "I haven't any with me, but I
have friends who can identify me&mdash;three Americans and two
Dutch. You may know the latter."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Corrie van der Meer and Tak van der Bos. Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"I knew them very well, but they have both been reported
dead."</p>

<p>"They were not dead yesterday," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said de Lettenhove. "How do you happen to be in
Sumatra anyway? How could an English colonel get to Sumatra in
wartime? And what are Americans doing here?"</p>

<p>"An American bomber was supposed to have crashed here some time
ago," one of the men reminded de Lettenhove in Dutch. "This fellow,
if he is working with the Japs, would have known this. He would
also have been able to get the names of Miss van der Meer and Tak.
Let the damn fool go on. He's digging his own grave."</p>

<p>"Ask him how he knew our camp was here," suggested another.</p>

<p>"How did you know where to find us?" demanded de Lettenhove.</p>

<p>"I'll answer all your questions," said Tarzan. "I was aboard the
bomber that was shot down. That's how I happen to be here. The
three Americans I have mentioned were also survivors from that
plane. I learned in a native village yesterday about the general
location of your camp. These villagers have been collaborating with
the Japs. There was a Jap outpost garrisoned there. We had an
engagement with them yesterday, and wiped out the entire
garrison."</p>

<p>"You speak excellent German," said one of the men
accusingly.</p>

<p>"I speak several languages," said Tarzan, "including Dutch." He
smiled.</p>

<p>De Lettenhove flushed. "Why didn't you tell me all these things
in the first place?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I wished first to assure myself that I was among potential
friends. You might have been collaborationists. I just had an
experience with a band of armed Dutchmen who work with the
Japs."</p>

<p>"What decided you that we were all right?"</p>

<p>"The appearance of this camp. It is not the camp of a band of
undisciplined outlaws. Then, too, I understood all that you said in
Dutch. You would not have feared that I might be a spy had you been
on friendly terms with the Japs. I am convinced that I can trust
you. I am sorry that you do not trust me. You probably could have
been of great assistance to me and my friends."</p>

<p>"I should like to believe you," said de Lettenhove. "We'll let
the matter rest until Capt. van Prins returns."</p>

<p>"If he can describe Corrie van der Meer and Tak van der Bos,
I'll believe him," said one of the men. "If they're dead, as we've
heard, he can't ever have seen them, for Corrie was killed with her
father and mother over two years ago way up in the mountains, and
Tak was captured and killed by the Japs after he escaped from the
concentration camp. They couldn't possibly have been seen by this
man unless they are still alive and together."</p>

<p>Tarzan described them both minutely, and told much of what had
befallen them during the past two years.</p>

<p>De Lettenhove offered Tarzan his hand. "I believe you now," he
said, "but you must understand that we have to be suspicious of
everyone."</p>

<p>"So am I," replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I appear to be rude," said the Dutchman, "but I'd
really like to know why you go about nearly naked like a regular
Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Because I am Tarzan." He saw incredulity and returning
suspicion in de Lettenhove's face. "Possibly some of you may recall
that Tarzan is an Englishman and that his name is Clayton. That is
the name I gave you, you will recall."</p>

<p>"That's right," exclaimed one of the men. "John Clayton, Lord
Greystoke."</p>

<p>"And there's the scar on his forehead that he got in his fight
with the gorilla when he was a boy," exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"I guess that settles it," said de Lettenhove.</p>

<p>The men crowded around, asking Tarzan innumerable questions.
They were more than friendly now, trying to make amends for their
former suspicions.</p>

<p>"Am I still a prisoner?" he asked de Lettenhove.</p>

<p>"No, but I wish you would remain until the captain gets back. I
know that he'll be more than anxious to be of assistance to
you."</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Corrie entered the forest she saw a man
standing in the trail about a hundred feet from her. It was Hooft.
He removed his hat and bowed, smiling. "Thank you for coming," he
said. "I was afraid to go down into the village until I was sure
the people there were friendly."</p>

<p>Corrie advanced toward him. She did not recognize him. Even
though smiling, his appearance was most unprepossessing; so she
kept her rifle at ready. "If you are a loyal Dutchman," she said,
"you will find the white men in this village friendly. What do you
want of them?"</p>

<p>She had advanced about fifty feet when suddenly men leaped from
the underbrush on both sides of the trail. The muzzle of her rifle
was struck up and the weapon seized and wrenched from her
grasp.</p>

<p>"Don't make no noise and you won't be hurt," said one of the
men.</p>

<p>Pistols were levelled at her as a warning of what would happen
to her if she cried out for help. She saw that the men surrounding
her were Dutchmen, and realized that they were probably of the same
band of outlaws from which Tak and Tarzan had escaped. She
reproached herself for having stupidly put herself in their
power.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"We ain't goin' to hurt you," said Hooft. "Just come along
quietly, and we won't keep you long." They were already moving
along the trail, men in front of her and behind her. She realized
that escape now was impossible.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do with me?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"You'll find that out in a couple of days."</p>

<p>"My friends will follow, and when they catch up with you you'll
wish that you never had seen me."</p>

<p>"They won't never catch up," said Hooft. "Even if they should,
there are only four of them. We'd wipe 'em out in no time."</p>

<p>"You don't know them," said Corrie. "They have killed forty Japs
today, and they'll find you no matter where you hide. You had
better let me go back; because you will certainly pay if you
don't."</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Hooft.</p>

<p>They hurried on. Night fell, but they did not stop. Corrie
thought of Jerry and the others. Most of all, she thought of Jerry.
She wondered if they had missed her yet. She didn't wonder what
they would do when they did miss her. She knew. She knew that the
search for her would start immediately. Probably it already had
started. She lagged, pretending to be tired. She wanted to delay
her captors; but they pushed her roughly on, swearing at her.</p>

<p>Back in the village, Jerry was the first to wonder why Corrie
hadn't joined them as the natives prepared their evening meal. He
saw Amat, and asked van der Bos to send him after Corrie. The
native went to the house Corrie had occupied and pretended to look
for her. Presently he returned to say that she was not there. "I
saw her go into the forest a little while ago," he said. "I
supposed that she had returned, but she is not in her house."</p>

<p>"Where into the forest?" asked van der Bos. Amat pointed to a
different trail from that which Corrie had taken.</p>

<p>When van der Bos had interpreted what Amat had said, Jerry
picked up his rifle and started for the forest. The others followed
him.</p>

<p>"What in the world could have possessed her to go wandering off
into the forest alone?" demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>"Maybe she didn't," said Rosetti. "Maybe dat little stinker was
lyin'. I don't like dat puss o' his. He looks like a rat."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the little so-and-so, either," said
Bubonovitch. "It just isn't like Corrie to do a thing like
that."</p>

<p>"I know," said Jerry, "but we'll have to make a search anyway.
We can't pass up any chance of finding her however slim."</p>

<p>"If that little yellow runt was lyin', if he knows wot become of
Corrie, I'm goin' to poke a bayonet clean through his gizzard,"
growled Rosetti.</p>

<p>They went into the forest, calling Corrie aloud by name.
Presently they realized the futility of it. In the pitch darkness
of the forest night they could have seen no spoor, had there been
one to see.</p>

<p>"If only Tarzan were here," said Jerry. "God! but I feel
helpless."</p>

<p>"Somethin' dirty's been pulled," said Rosetti. "I t'ink we
should orter go back an' give de whole village de toid degree."</p>

<p>"You're right, Shrimp," said Jerry. "Let's go back."</p>

<p>They routed the natives out and herded them into the center of
the village. Then van der Bos questioned them. Those first
questioned denied any knowledge even of Corrie's departure. They
disclaimed having any idea of where she might be. As Lara's turn
came, Amat started to sneak away. Shrimp saw him, for he had been
keeping an eye on him, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck,
wheeled him around, and pushed him into the center of the stage, at
the same time giving him a swift kick in the pants.</p>

<p>"This louse was tryin' to beat it," he announced. "I told you he
was a wrong guy." He held the business end of his bayonet in the
small of Amat's back.</p>

<p>Van der Bos questioned Lara at length and then interpreted her
replies to the others. "This girl says that Amat came and told
Corrie that a friend of her father was waiting at the edge of the
forest and wanted to see her, but for her to come alone, as he
didn't know whether or not the rest of us were friendly to the
Dutch. She went into the forest on that trail there." He pointed.
It was not the trail which Amat said she had taken.</p>

<p>"I told you so!" shouted Rosetti. "Tell this skunk to say his
prayers, for I'm goin' to kill him."</p>

<p>"No, Rosetti," said Jerry. "He's the only one who knows the
truth. We can't get it out of him if he's dead."</p>

<p>"I can wait," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>Tak van der Bos questioned Amat at length, while Rosetti kept
the point of a bayonet pressed against the frightened native's left
kidney.</p>

<p>"According to this man's story," said Tak, "he went into the
forest to gather durians. He was almost immediately captured by a
band of white men. He says there were about twenty of them. One of
them forced him to take that message to Corrie, threatening to come
back and kill him if Corrie didn't come out alone. He says he was
very much frightened. Also, he thought the man merely wished to
talk with Corrie. Says he didn't know that they would keep
her."</p>

<p>"Is dat all?" demanded Shrimp.</p>

<p>"That's his whole story."</p>

<p>"May I kill him now, Cap?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Aw, hell! Why not? You know de bum's lyin'."</p>

<p>"We're not Japs, Rosetti. And we've got other things to do right
now." He turned to van der Bos. "Isn't it likely that those fellows
were the same ones that you and Tarzan got away from?"</p>

<p>"I think there's no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"Then you can lead us to their camp?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"At night?"</p>

<p>"We can start now," said van der Bos.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Jerry. "Let's get going."</p>

<p>Rosetti gave Amat a quick poke with his bayonet that brought a
frightened scream from the Sumatran. Jerry wheeled toward the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"I didn't kill him, Cap. You didn't tell me not to jab him once
for luck."</p>

<p>"I'd like to kill him myself, Shrimp," said Jerry. "But we can't
do things that way."</p>

<p>"I can," said Rosetti, "if you'll just look de udder way a
second." But Jerry shook his head and started off toward the mouth
of the trail. The others followed, Shrimp shaking his head and
grumbling. "T'ink of dat poor kid out dere wit' dem bums!" he said.
"An' if dis little stinker had a-told us, we'd a-had her back
before now. Just for a couple seconds I wish we was Japs."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch made no wisecrack about misogynists. He was in no
wisecracking mood, but he couldn't but recall how violently upset
Shrimp had been when they had had to add a "dame" to their
company.</p>

<p><br><br>Finding that her delaying tactics won her nothing but abuse,
Corrie swung along at an easy stride with her captors. Presently,
she heard three sharp knocks ahead, as though some one had struck
the bole of a tree three times with a heavy implement. The men
halted, and Hooft struck the bole of a tree three times with the
butt of his rifle&mdash;two knocks close together and then a third
at a slightly longer interval.</p>

<p>A woman's voice demanded, "Who is it?" and the outlaw chief
replied, "Hooft."</p>

<p>"Come on in," said the woman. "I'd know that schnapps bass if I
heard it in Hell."</p>

<p>The party advanced, and presently the woman spoke again from
directly above them. "I'm coming down," she said. "Post one of your
men up here, Hooft. This is no job for a lady."</p>

<p>"What give you the idea you was a lady?" demanded Hooft, as the
woman descended from the platform from which she had been guarding
the trail to the camp. She was Hooft's woman, Sarina.</p>

<p>"Not you, sweetheart," said the woman.</p>

<p>"We won't need no guard here no more," said Hooft. "We're
pullin' out quick."</p>

<p>"Why? Some cripple with a slingshot chasin' you?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Hooft. "You're goin' to shoot off your gab
just once too often one of these days."</p>

<p>"Don't make me laugh," said Sarina.</p>

<p>"I'm gettin' damn sick of you," said Hooft.</p>

<p>"I've been damn sick of you for a long while, sweetheart. I'd
trade you for an orangutan any day."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," grumbled one of the men. "We're all gettin' good
an' goddam sick of hearin' you two bellyache."</p>

<p>"Who said that?" demanded Hooft. No one replied.</p>

<p>Presently they entered the camp and aroused the women, whereupon
considerable acrimonious haggling ensued when the women learned
that they were to break camp and take the trail this late at
night.</p>

<p>Some torches were lighted, and in their dim and flickering
illumination the band gathered up its meager belongings. The light
also served to reveal Corrie to the women.</p>

<p>"Who's the kid?" demanded one of them. "This ain't no place for
a nice boy."</p>

<p>"That ain't no boy," said a man. "She's a girl."</p>

<p>"What you want of her?" asked a woman suspiciously.</p>

<p>"The Japs want her," explained Grotius, the second in
command.</p>

<p>"Maybe they won't get her?" said Hooft.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Grotius.</p>

<p>"Because maybe I've taken a fancy to her myself. I'm goin' to
give Sarina to an ape." Everybody laughed, Sarina louder than the
others.</p>

<p>"You ain't much to look at, you ain't much to listen to, and you
ain't much to live with," she announced; "but until I find me
another man, you don't go foolin' around with any other woman. And
see that you don't forget it," she added. Sarina was a well built
woman of thirty-five, lithe and muscular. An automatic pistol
always swung at her hip and her carbine was always within reach.
Nor did she consider herself fully clothed if her parang were not
dangling in its sheath from her belt. But these were only outward
symbols of Sarina's formidableness. It was her innate ferocity when
aroused that made her feared by the cutthroats and degenerates of
Hooft's precious band. And she had come by this ferocity quite as a
matter of course. Her maternal grandfather had been a Borneo
headhunter and her maternal grandmother a Batak and a cannibal. Her
father was a Dutchman who had lived adventurously in and about the
South Seas, indulging in barratry and piracy, and dying at last on
the gibbet for murder. Sarina, herself, carrying on the traditions
of her family, though not expiating them so irrevocably as had her
sire, had been serving a life sentence for murder when released
from jail at the time of the Japanese invasion.</p>

<p>It is true that the man she had murdered should have been
murdered long before; so one should not judge Sarina too harshly.
It is also true that, as is often the case with characters like
Sarina, she possessed many commendable characteristics. She was
generous and loyal and honest. At the drop of a hat she would fight
for what she knew to be right. In fact, it was not necessary even
to drop a hat. Hooft feared her.</p>

<p>Corrie had listened with increasing perturbation to the exchange
of pleasantries between Hooft and Sarina. She did not know which to
fear more. She might be given over to the Japs, taken by Hooft, or
killed by Sarina. It was not a pleasant outlook. She could but pray
that Jerry and the others would come in time.</p>

<p>The outlaws had left the camp by a trail other than that along
which Corrie had been brought. Hooft had issued orders for the
march that would ensure that their spoor would completely deceive
anyone attempting to track them, and when Corrie heard them the
last ray of hope seemed to have been extinguished. Only prayer was
left.</p>

<p>On the march, Sarina walked always close to her. Corrie hoped
that this would keep Hooft away. Of the two, she feared him more
than she did the woman.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TAK VAN DER BOS led Jerry, Bubonovitch, and
Rosetti through the Cimmerian darkness of the equatorial forest
toward the camp of the outlaws. The night noises of the jungle were
all about them; but they saw nothing, not even one another. They
were guided solely by the slight sounds given off by the
accouterments of the man directly ahead. If van der Bos slowed down
or stopped as he felt for the trail they bumped into one another.
Often they collided with trees or stumbled over obstacles, cursing
softly. Otherwise they moved in silence. They did not talk.</p>

<p>Strange sounds came out of the jungle&mdash;unaccountable
crashings, occasionally a scream of terror or agony. Life and death
were all about them. And sometimes there were strange silences,
more ominous than the noises. Then, Bubonovitch would think: Death
is abroad. The jungle is waiting to see where he will strike, each
creature fearing to call attention to itself.</p>

<p>Rosetti felt as a man walking in a dream. He walked and walked
and walked, and never got anywhere. It was as though he had walked
forever and would keep on walking in darkness throughout
eternity.</p>

<p>Jerry thought only of what might be happening to Corrie, and
chafed at the slowness of their progress. He was wondering for the
thousandth time how much longer it would be before they would reach
the camp, when he bumped into van der Bos. Then Rosetti and
Bubonovitch bumped into him. Van der Bos got them into a huddle,
and whispered: "Get your guns ready. We are approaching their
sentry. We may be able to sneak by in the darkness. If he
challenges, Jerry and I will let him have it; then we'll charge the
camp, yelling like hell. But we can't shoot there until we have
located Corrie. When we do, we can commence shooting; then keep
right on through the camp. There is a trail on the other side. And
keep together."</p>

<p>"I think we should go in shooting, but in the air," suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p>"That's better," agreed van der Bos. "Come on!"</p>

<p>There was no sentry, and so they crept silently into the
deserted camp to reconnoiter. It was not so dark here in the open,
and they soon discovered that their quarry had flown. Their
reactions to this disappointment were expressed variously and
profanely.</p>

<p>"Where do we go from here?" demanded Rosetti.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait for daylight before we can pick up their
trail," said Jerry. "The rest of you get some sleep. I'll stand
guard for an hour. Then one of you can relieve me for an hour. By
that time it should be light."</p>

<p>"Lemme stand guard, Cap," said Rosetti. "I can take it better'n
you."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, you see you're pretty old. You'd orter get
your rest."</p>

<p>Jerry grinned. "Ever hear of a general named Stilwell?" he
asked. "Thanks just the same, Shrimp; but I'll take the first
trick, then I'll call you."</p>

<p>As soon as it was light, they searched for the tracks of the
outlaws; but they found none leading out of the camp. It seemed
baffling until Bubonovitch suggested that they had gone out by the
same trail along which they themselves had come in, and thus the
spoor of the outlaws had been obliterated by their own.</p>

<p>"They must have kept right ahead at the fork," said van der Bos.
"I guess we'll have to go back there and start all over again." But
when they reached the forks, there was no sign of fresh spoor
continuing on the main trail.</p>

<p>"Wotinell become of 'em?" demanded Rosetti. "They's somethin'
phoney about it&mdash;people vanishin' like dat."</p>

<p>"They probably used vanishing cream," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"We must have got some of it on our brains," said Jerry,
disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Or up our noses and in our eyes and ears," said Bubonovitch.
"Tarzan was right. Civilization has robbed us of most of our
physical sensibilities. I suppose that he would have found that
spoor just like that." He snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>"He's pretty slick," said Rosetti, "but even Tarzan can't find
no trail when they ain't none."</p>

<p>"About all we can do," said Jerry, "is go back to the village
and wait for him. A bunch of dummies like us couldn't ever find
her, and if we try it we might miss Tarzan entirely when he gets
back."</p>

<p>It was a dejected party that returned to the village. When Amat
saw Rosetti entering the village he disappeared into the forest and
climbed a tree. There he remained until after dark, a terrified and
unhappy collaborator.</p>

<p><br><br>Tarzan waited in the camp of the guerrillas until Capt. Kervyn
van Prins returned. Van Prins, de Lettenhove, and Tarzan conferred
at length. Tarzan told them of the destruction of the Jap
detachment in the village and of the extra rifles and ammunition,
which he thought the guerrillas might use to advantage.</p>

<p>"When I left yesterday," he said, "my friends were going out to
ambush the Jap relief party that was expected at almost any time.
If it has arrived I haven't much doubt as to the outcome of that
engagement; so there should be quite a little additional equipment
for you if you care to come and get it. I think that village needs
a lesson, too. Those people are undoubtedly working with the
Japs."</p>

<p>"You say you believe the Jap relief party would consist of some
twenty men," said van Prins, "and your party had only five people,
and one of them a girl. Aren't you rather overconfident in thinking
that an engagement would result in a victory for your people?"</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "You don't know my people," he said. "Too, they
had a tremendous advantage over the Japs. They knew that the Japs
were coming; but the Japs didn't know we were there and waiting for
them in trees on both sides of the trail, armed with rifles and
hand grenades. And don't discount the fighting ability of the girl,
Captain. She is a crack shot, and she already has several Japs to
her credit. She is imbued with a hatred of Japs that amounts almost
to religious exaltation."</p>

<p>"Little Corrie van der Meer!" exclaimed van Prins. "It is almost
unbelievable."</p>

<p>"And two of our Americans," continued Tarzan. "They were
captured and abused by the Japs, and were about to be beheaded when
the American captain and Corrie arrived in time to save them. I
think they are good for at least five Japs apiece, if not more.
They have become two-fisted haters. No, I don't think we need worry
about the outcome of the fight, if there was one. As the Americans
would say, 'we did it before; we can do it again.'"</p>

<p>"Very well," said van Prins; "we'll go with you. We can
certainly use more rifles and ammunition. Possibly we should join
forces. We can discuss that when we all get together. When do you
want to start back?"</p>

<p>"I am going now," replied Tarzan. "We'll wait in the village for
you."</p>

<p>"We can go along with you," said van Prins.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "Not the way I travel, I'm afraid. By
forced marches, you may make it by sometime tomorrow. I'll be back
there tonight."</p>

<p>The Dutchman gave a skeptical shrug; but he smiled and said,
"Very good. We'll see you some time tomorrow."</p>

<p><br><br>Day was breaking as the outlaws emerged from the forest into a
narrow valley. They had brought their supply of schnapps along with
them, and most of them were drunk. More than anything else, they
wanted to lie down and sleep. They made camp under some trees
beside the little river that wound down the valley toward the
sea.</p>

<p>Hooft said that the women could stand guard, as they had had
some sleep the night before. As Sarina was the only woman who had
not drunk during the night, she volunteered to stand the first
trick. Soon the others were sprawled out and snoring. But Corrie
could not sleep. Plans for escape raced through her mind, banishing
thoughts of slumber. She saw that all but Sarina were dead to the
world. Perhaps Sarina might succumb to fatigue, too. Then she could
get away. She knew exactly where she was and where to find the
trail, that led back to the village. Farther down the valley she
would probably find the bones of the rhinoceros and the deer that
Tarzan had killed. Just beyond, she would come to the trail that
led up out of the valley and into the forest.</p>

<p>She eyed the weapons of the sleeping men and women. If she could
but steal a parang without Sarina seeing her. She would only have
to get close to the woman then. In time, her attention would be
distracted. She would turn her head away. Then one terrific blow
with the heavy knife, and Corrie, armed with rifle, pistol, and
parang, would be far on her way to the village before these drunken
sots awakened.</p>

<p>Corrie did not even wonder that she entertained such thoughts.
Her once sheltered life had become a battle for mere existence. If
enemies could not be eluded, they must be destroyed. And this woman
was an enemy. Corrie feared her fully as much as she feared the
men. She thought of her as a terrible creature, steeped in
vice.</p>

<p>Sarina was still a comparatively young woman. She had the sultry
beauty that so many Eurasian women have and the erect, graceful
carriage that marks the women of Java and Sumatra, and the slimness
and physical perfection. But Corrie saw her through eyes of hate
and loathing.</p>

<p>Sarina was staring at Corrie, her brows puckered in
concentration. Would the woman never look away. "What is your
name?" asked Sarina.</p>

<p>"Van der Meer," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Corrie van der Meer?" Sarina smiled. "I thought so. You look
like your mother."</p>

<p>"You knew my mother?" demanded Corrie. "You couldn't have." Her
tone suggested that the woman had insulted her mother's memory just
by claiming to have known her.</p>

<p>"But I did," said Sarina. "I knew your father, too. I worked for
them while you were in school in Holland. They were very good to
me. I loved them both. When I got in trouble, your father hired a
fine attorney to defend me. But it did no good. Justice is not for
Eurasians, or perhaps I should say mercy is not for Eurasians. I
was guilty, but there were circumstances that would have counted in
my favor had I been white. That is all past. Because your father
and mother were kind to me and helped me, I shall help you."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"Sarina."</p>

<p>"I have heard both my father and mother speak of you. They were
very fond of you. But how can you help me?"</p>

<p>Sarina walked over to one of the sleeping men and took his rifle
and some ammunition from him. She brought them back to Corrie. "Do
you know how to get back to the village where they found you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then get started. These drunken beasts will sleep a long
time."</p>

<p>"How can I thank you, Sarina?" she said. She thought, and I was
going to kill her!</p>

<p>"Don't thank me. Thank your father and mother for being kind to
an Eurasian. Do you know how to use a rifle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, goodbye and good luck!"</p>

<p>Impulsively, Corrie threw her arms about the woman she would
have killed, and kissed her. "God bless you, Sarina," she said.
Then she swung on down the valley. Sarina watched her go, and there
were tears in her eyes. She touched the spot on her cheek where
Corrie had kissed her, touched it almost reverently.</p>

<p>Corrie took advantage of the cover afforded by the trees that
grew along the left bank of the river. It was much farther to the
trail leading up out of the valley than she had imagined, and it
was late afternoon before she saw it winding across the valley from
the opposite side. She saw something else, too. Something that made
her heart sink. Some natives were making camp for the night
directly in her path, and there were two Jap soldiers with them.
Now she would have to wait for darkness, and then try to sneak past
them.</p>

<p>She climbed into a tree, and tried to make herself comfortable.
She was very tired and very sleepy. But she did not dare sleep for
fear she would fall out of the tree. At last she found a
combination of branches into which she could wedge her body and
from which she could not fall. She was very uncomfortable; but
nevertheless she fell asleep, utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>When she awoke, she knew that she had slept for some time, as
the moon was high in the heavens. She could see the fire burning in
the camp of the natives. Now she could slip past them and reach the
trail to the village. She was preparing to descend when she heard
the coughing grunt of a tiger. It sounded very close. From a little
distance there arose the barking and growling of wild dogs. Corrie
decided to remain where she was.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was late when Tarzan reached the village.
Bubonovitch, who was on guard, challenged him.</p>

<p>"Colonel Clayton," responded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Advance to be recognized, Colonel; but I know your voice
anyway. And thank the Lord you're back."</p>

<p>Tarzan approached. "Something wrong, Sergeant?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll say there's something wrong. Corrie's been abducted," then
he told Tarzan all that he knew about the matter.</p>

<p>"And you couldn't find their trail?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any."</p>

<p>"There has to be," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I sure hope you're right, Sir."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything until morning. We'll start as soon as it's
light."</p>

<p>Jerry was on guard when Tarzan awoke at daylight. The American,
anxious to get the search under way, had already routed out the
others. They called Lara from her house. She was the only one of
the natives they felt they could trust. Van der Bos talked to her.
He told her that a band of guerrillas would arrive in the village
sometime during the day, and instructed her to tell them what had
happened and ask them to remain until the searchers returned.</p>

<p><br><br>When Corrie was safely out of sight of the camp of the outlaws,
Sarina awoke the woman whom she thought had been most overcome by
drink and told her to relieve her as guard. She said nothing about
the escape of the prisoner, assuming that the woman's brain would
be so befuddled that she would not notice. Sarina was right.</p>

<p>The guard was changed twice more before Hooft awoke. When he
discovered that Corrie was missing, he was furious. He questioned
all the women who had been on guard. Sarina insisted that Corrie
had been there when she relinquished the post to another. The
others insisted that the prisoner had not left while they were on
duty. Hooft got nowhere. He had slept all day. It was now getting
dark and too late to start a search. All he could do about it was
to curse the women roundly and try to find solace in a schnapps
bottle.</p>

<p><br><br>At about the same time that Tarzan and the others were starting
out from the village to search for her the following morning,
Corrie was impatiently watching the camp of the natives and the two
Japs. She dared not descend until they had left. She watched them
prepare and eat their breakfast leisurely, thinking that they would
never finish. But at long last they did.</p>

<p>They came in her direction, and Corrie hid in the tree where the
foliage was densest. At last they filed by, quite close; and Corrie
recognized Iskandar, the leader of the natives who had once
abducted her, and several of his band. When they were at a safe
distance, Corrie descended to the ground and followed the trail up
the cliff and into the forest. At last she was safe, for all her
known enemies were behind her and she was on a familiar trail that
led directly back to her friends.</p>

<p>Iskandar continued on with his party until they came within
sight of the outlaws; then the two Japs hid, and the natives
approached Hooft and his people. There was a brief parley between
Iskandar and Hooft; then the native sent one of his men back to
tell the Japs that the white men were friendly.</p>

<p>After the two Japs joined them, the schnapps bottles were passed
around as the men discussed plans. The Japs were non-commissioned
officers from the detachment of Capt. Tokujo Matsuo, and so were
naturally anxious to recapture Corrie. So were Iskandar and Hooft,
each of whom visualized some form of reward if they returned the
girl to the Japanese officer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for their plans they drank too much schnapps; and
though they started out in the right direction, they never picked
up Corrie's spoor. When they reached the trail leading up into the
forest, the trail that Corrie had taken, Sarina claimed to have
discovered the spoor and led them on down the valley. Thus again
the kindness of her dead father and mother intervened to save the
girl.</p>

<p>Tarzan, Jerry, and the others marched rapidly to the abandoned
camp of the outlaws. Tarzan examined the spoor that had confused
and deceived his companions; then he led them out along the trail
that the outlaws had taken. The others were dubious, but they
followed.</p>

<p>"Them tracks is all pointin' toward the camp," said Rosetti.
"We're goin' the wrong way, an' just wastin' time."</p>

<p>"They tell me you're a great ball turret gunner, Shrimp," said
Tarzan; "but you're a mighty poor tracker. The people we're after
passed along this trail last night in the same direction that we're
going."</p>

<p>"Then they must o' came back again, Colonel. All these
footprints is pointin' the other way."</p>

<p>"The majority of them went in advance," explained Tarzan; "then
three men and a woman walked backward behind them, obliterating the
spoor of those who had gone ahead. About every hundred yards, three
other men and a woman relieved the spoor-obliterators; because it
is tiresome walking backward."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you tell that," persisted Rosetti.</p>

<p>"When you walk forward your heels strike the ground first; then
you push yourself forward with the balls of your feet, at the same
time pushing the dirt back in the opposite direction. When you walk
backward, the balls of your feet strike the ground first and you
push yourself forward with your heels, still pushing the dirt in
the direction opposite from that in which you are going. Examine
the ground carefully, and you will see for yourself. If you follow
the trail long enough, and are sufficiently observing, you will see
that about every hundred yards there is a change in the sizes of
the footprints, showing that new people took up the job."</p>

<p>Not only Rosetti, but the others, fell to examining the spoor.
"Cripes, but we're dumb," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"I should have knowed enough to keep my fool trap shut," said
Rosetti. "The colonel ain't never wrong."</p>

<p>"Don't get that idea," said Tarzan. "I don't want to try to live
up to anything like that. But remember, about this tracking, that
I've been doing it all my life, ever since I was a child, and that
innumerable times my life has depended upon my knowing what I was
doing. Now I am going on ahead. We don't want to run into that
outfit without warning."</p>

<p>An hour later the rest of the party emerged from the forest into
the open valley and found Tarzan waiting for them. "Your outlaws
passed down the valley a short time ago," he told them. "I have
also found Corrie's trail. She was hours ahead of them and alone.
Evidently she managed to escape from them. I am pretty sure that
they did not discover her spoor, as theirs is often yards to the
right of hers and never touches it.</p>

<p>"There were a number of men and women in the party, several
natives, and two Jap soldiers. At least two of the men were short
legged and wore working tabi; so I assume they were Japs. I am
going on ahead, following Corrie's trail. If she took the trail
leading up into the forest, I'll cut a single blaze on a tree near
the trail. If she kept on down the valley, I'll cut two blazes. If
there are three, you will know that the outlaws took the same trail
that Corrie took; otherwise, they took a different trail." Tarzan
turned then, and was off at the even trot that he could maintain
for hours when he chose to keep to the ground, the gait for which
Apache Indians are famous.</p>

<p>"I don't know what good we are," said Bubonovitch. "That guy
doesn't need us."</p>

<p>"He lets us come along for the ride," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"I think we are just in his way," remarked van der Bos; "but
he's mighty patient about it."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to practice swingin' t'rough de trees," said
Shrimp.</p>

<p>"And jumping down on tigers?" asked Bubonovitch.</p>

<p><br><br>As Corrie followed what was to her now the homeward trail, she
was happy and lighthearted. She was returning to Tak and Jerry and
Tarzan and Bubonovitch and the little sergeant, of whom she had
finally become very fond. In fact, she was very fond of all of
them. Of course, she had known Tak all her life; but it was as
though she had known the others always, also. She decided that she
loved them all. She could scarcely wait to see them all again and
tell them of her adventures. She had a little score to settle,
too&mdash;a little score to settle with Amat. But she quickly put
that out of her mind. She wished to think only of pleasant
things.</p>

<p>So she was thinking of pleasant things, one of which was Jerry,
when she suddenly became conscious of something moving through the
underbrush parallel with the trail. It was something large. Corrie
had her rifle ready, her finger on the trigger, as she peered into
the tangle of foliage. What she saw drove every pleasant thought
from her mind&mdash;just a little glimpse of black and yellow
stripes. A tiger was stalking her. How utterly inadequate was the
.25 caliber Jap rifle she was carrying! When she stopped, the tiger
stopped. Now she could see his eyes&mdash;terrifying eyes&mdash;as
he stood with lowered head returning her gaze. Would he attack? Why
else would he be stalking her?</p>

<p>Corrie glanced about. Close beside her was a durian tree from
which a stout liana depended. If the tiger charged, he would reach
her before she could clamber out of danger. If she moved too
quickly, he would charge. Any sudden movement on her part would
doubtless mean a sudden death.</p>

<p>Very carefully, she leaned her rifle against the bole of the
tree; then she grasped the liana. She watched the tiger. He had not
moved. He still stood there watching her. Corrie drew herself up
very slowly. Always she watched the tiger. The beast seemed
fascinated. As she climbed, she saw his eyes following her.
Suddenly he moved forward toward her.</p>

<p>Then Corrie scrambled upward as fast as she could go, and the
tiger charged. But he was in an awkward position. He had to run
half way around the tree and out into the trail before he could
gather himself to spring up to seize her. He did spring, but he
missed. And Corrie clawed her way upward to safety.</p>

<p>She sat there astride a limb, trembling, her heart pounding. And
the tiger lay down in the trail at the foot of the tree. He was old
and mangy. Because he was old, he had probably been unable to
overhaul a meal for so long that he was reduced to hunting by day
for anything that he might find. And having found something, he had
evidently determined to wait right where he was until his prey
either came down or fell out of the tree. Every once in a while he
looked up at Corrie, bared his yellow fangs, and growled.</p>

<p>Corrie, though not given to any but the mildest of epithets,
nevertheless swore at him. The creature had shattered her dream of
getting back to her boys quickly. He just lay there, growling at
her occasionally. An hour passed. Corrie was becoming frantic.
Another hour, and still the stupid beast held tenaciously to his
post. Corrie wondered which one of them would starve to death
first.</p>

<p>Presently she was joined by some monkeys. They, too, scolded the
tiger and probably swore at him in monkey language. Then Corrie had
an idea. She knew that monkeys were imitative. She picked a durian
fruit and threw it at the tiger. It struck him, much to Corrie's
surprise, and elicited a savage growl. She threw another, and
missed. Then the monkeys got the idea. Here was sport. They and
Corrie bombarded the great cat with durian fruit. It rose,
growling, and tried to leap into the tree; but it only fell back,
lost its balance, and rolled over on its back. A durian struck it
full on the nose. Durians rained upon it. Finally it gave up and
went crashing off into the jungle. But for a long while Corrie did
not dare leave her sanctuary. And she was a wary and frightened
girl when she finally slipped down and retrieved her rifle.</p>

<p>Every little sound startled her now as she hurried along the
trail toward the village, but finally she became convinced that she
had seen the last of Stripes.</p>

<p>A huge creature bulked large and black in a tree beneath which
Corrie passed. She did not see it. It moved silently above and
behind her, watching her. It was Oju, the young orangutan which
Tarzan had fought. Corrie's rifle kept him at a distance. Oju was
afraid of the black sticks that made a loud noise. But he was
patient. He could wait.</p>

<p>Presently other monstrous shapes appeared in the trees and in
the trail in front of Corrie. She stopped. She had never seen so
many orangutans together before. Corrie did not believe that they
would harm her, but she was not certain. They grimaced at her, and
some of them made threatening gestures, stamping on the ground and
making little short rushes toward her. She kept her finger on the
trigger of her rifle and backed away. She backed directly beneath
Oju, who was now perched on a limb but a few feet above her
head.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the great apes avoid humans, going away when one
appears. Corrie wondered why these did not go away. She thought
that they would presently; so she waited, not daring to advance
along the trail which some of them occupied. She thought that
probably their numbers gave them courage to remain in the presence
of a human being. It was not that, however. It was curiosity. They
wanted to see what Oju was going to do. They did not have long to
wait.</p>

<p>Oju looked down with bloodshot eyes, weighing the situation. He
saw that this she tarmangani's whole attention was held by the
other apes. He dropped upon Corrie, hurling her to the ground; and
at the same time he wrenched the rifle from her grasp. The girl's
finger being on the trigger at the time, the weapon was discharged.
That terrified Oju, and he swung into a tree and off into the
forest. But, having a one-track mind, he neglected to loosen his
grasp about Corrie's body; so he took her with him.</p>

<p>The shot also frightened the other apes; and they, too, swung
off into the forest, but not in the same direction that Oju had
taken. Now, the trail was quiet and deserted; but Corrie was not
there to take advantage of it. She was beating futilely with
clenched fists on the monstrous, hairy body of her abductor.
Eventually, this annoyed Oju; and he cuffed her on the side of the
head. It was fortunate for Corrie that this was merely a gentle
reminder that Oju objected to being beaten, even though the beating
did not hurt him in the least; for it only rendered her
unconscious, whereas, had Oju really exerted himself she would
doubtless have been killed.</p>

<p>When Corrie regained consciousness, which she did very quickly,
she thought at first that she was experiencing a horrible
nightmare; but that was only for a moment before the complete
return of reason. Now she was indeed horrified. The great, hairy
beast was hurrying through the trees, constantly looking back over
its shoulder as though something were pursuing it.</p>

<p>Corrie was armed with both a pistol and a parang, but the
orangutan held her so that one of his great arms was clamped over
both of the weapons in such a way that she could withdraw neither
of them. And the creature was carrying her deeper and deeper into
the forest, and toward what horrible fate?</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">JERRY, Bubonovitch, Rosetti, and van der Bos
followed the river down the valley until they came to the trail
leading to the left out of the valley and into the forest at the
summit of the cliff. Here they found a single blaze upon the bole
of a tree and knew that Corrie had taken the trail back toward the
village and that her erstwhile captors had not followed her.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the cliff they heard, very faintly,
a shot far ahead of them. Tarzan had carried no firearm, and they
could not know that Corrie had been armed. The natural assumption
was that she had not. The outlaws had not come this way, so none of
them could have fired the shot. The natives had been warned not to
touch the Jap weapons that the whites had hidden in their village,
nor would they have dared so to arm themselves against the
proscription of the Japs, of whom they stood in mortal terror.</p>

<p>The four men discussed these various conclusions as they pushed
on along the trail. "A Jap must have fired that shot," said van der
Bos. "And where there is one Jap there are doubtless others."</p>

<p>"Bring 'em on," said Rosetti. "I ain't killed no Jap for two
days."</p>

<p>"We'll have to be careful," said Jerry. "I'll go on ahead about
a hundred yards. I'll fire at the first Jap I see, and then fall
back. You fellows get into the underbrush on one side of the trail
when you hear my shot and let 'em have it when you can't miss. Let
'em get close."</p>

<p>"Geeze, Cap, you hadn't orter do that. Lemme do it," said
Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Or me," said Bubonovitch. "That's not your job, Captain."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Jerry. "You go ahead, Shrimp, and keep your ears
unbuttoned."</p>

<p>"Why don't you swing through the trees?" inquired Bubonovitch.
Shrimp grinned and ran ahead.</p>

<p>Tarzan had followed Corrie's trail for no great distance when he
came to the spot at which she had been treed by the tiger. He read
the whole story as clearly as he might have from a printed page.
Even the scattered durians told him how the tiger had finally been
driven off. He smiled and followed the now fresh trail that
indicated that the girl had resumed her journey but a short time
before. Then he heard a shot ahead.</p>

<p>He took to the trees now, and moved swiftly above the trail.
Like the men following behind him, he thought that a Jap had fired
the shot. He also thought that Corrie had doubtless fallen into the
hands of a detail of Jap soldiers. And then he saw a rifle lying in
the trail.</p>

<p>Tarzan was puzzled. The Japs would not have gone away and left a
rifle behind them. Too, there was no odor of Japs; but the scent
spoor of great apes was strong. He dropped into the trail. He saw
that Corrie's spoor ended where the rifle lay. He saw what appeared
to indicate that the girl had fallen or been thrown to the ground.
He also saw the manlike imprints of the feet of a large orangutan
superimposed upon those made by Corrie, but these imprints were
only directly beneath the tree where Tarzan stood.</p>

<p>The implication was clear: An orangutan had dropped from the
tree, seized Corrie, and carried her off. Tarzan swung into the
tree and was off on the trail of Oju. The arboreal spoor was plain
to his trained senses. A crushed beetle or caterpillar, the bark on
a limb scuffed by a horny hand or foot, a bit of reddish brown hair
caught by a twig, the scent spoor of both the ape and the girl
which still hung, even though faintly, in the quiet air of the
forest.</p>

<p>In a little natural clearing in the forest Tarzan overtook his
quarry. Oju had been aware that he was being followed, and now he
elected to stand and fight, if fighting were to be necessary, in
this open space. He still clung to his prize, and it happened that
he was holding Corrie in such a position that she could not see
Tarzan.</p>

<p>She knew that Oju was facing an enemy, for he was growling
savagely. And she heard his opponent growl in reply, but this
sounded more like the growl of a lion. Of course there were no
lions in Sumatra, but the voice was not the voice of a tiger. She
wondered what manner of beast it might be.</p>

<p>The voice was coming closer. Suddenly the orangutan dropped her
and lumbered forward. Corrie raised herself on her hands and looked
back. And at that instant Tarzan closed with Oju. Corrie leaped to
her feet and drew her pistol. But she dared not fire for fear of
hitting Tarzan. The two were locked in an embrace of death. Oju was
attempting to close his powerful jaws on the man's throat, and the
man held the yellow fangs away with one mighty arm. Both were
growling, but lower now. Corrie was suddenly conscious of the
feeling that she was watching two beasts fighting to the
death&mdash;and for her.</p>

<p>Tarzan was holding Oju's jaws from his throat with his right
arm. His left was pinned to his side by one of the ape's. Tarzan
was straining to release himself from this hold. Inch by inch he
was dragging his left arm free. Inch by inch Oju was forcing his
fangs closer and closer to the man's throat.</p>

<p>Corrie was horrified. She circled the struggling combatants,
trying to get a shot at the orangutan; but they were moving too
rapidly. She might as easily have hit Tarzan as his opponent.</p>

<p>The two were still on their feet, pulling and straining.
Suddenly Tarzan locked one leg around those of the ape and surged
heavily against him. Oju fell backward, Tarzan on top of him. In
trying to save himself, the ape had released his hold on the man's
left arm. Then Corrie saw a knife flash, saw it driven into the
ape's breast, heard his screams of pain and rage. Again and again
the knife was driven home. The screaming waned, the great body
quivered and lay still. Oju was dead.</p>

<p>Tarzan rose and placed a foot upon the body of his foe. He
raised his face toward the heavens&mdash;and then, suddenly, he
smiled. The victory cry of the bull ape died in his throat. Why he
did not voice it, he himself did not know.</p>

<p>Corrie felt very limp. Her legs refused to hold her, and she sat
down. She just looked at Tarzan and shook her head. "All in?" he
asked. Corrie nodded. "Well, your troubles are over for today at
least, I hope. Jerry, van der Bos, and the sergeants are coming
along the trail. We'd better get over there and meet them." He
swung her across his shoulder and swung back along the leafy way
that the ape had brought her, but how different were her feelings
now!</p>

<p>When they reached the trail, Tarzan examined it and found that
the others had not yet passed; so they sat down beside it and
waited. They did not talk. The man realized that the girl had
undergone terrific shock, and so he left her alone and did not
question her. He wanted her to rest.</p>

<p>But finally Corrie broke the silence herself. "I am an awful
fool," she said. "I have had to exert all the will power I possess
to keep from crying. I thought death was so near, and then you
came. It was just as though you had materialized out of thin air. I
suppose that it was the reaction that nearly broke me down. But how
in the world did you know where I was? How could you have known
what had happened to me?"</p>

<p>"Stories are not written in books alone," he said. "It was not
difficult." Then he told her just how he had trailed her. "I had an
encounter with that same ape a few days ago. I got the better of
him then, but I refrained from killing him. I wish now that I had
not. His name was Oju."</p>

<p>"You never said anything about that," she said.</p>

<p>"It was of no importance."</p>

<p>"You are a very strange man."</p>

<p>"I am more beast than man, Corrie."</p>

<p>She knitted her brows and shook her head. "You are very far from
being a beast."</p>

<p>"You mean that for a compliment. That is because you don't know
the beasts very well. They have many fine qualities that men would
do well to emulate. They have no vices. It was left for man to have
those as well as many disagreeable and criminal characteristics
that the beasts do not have. When I said that I was more beast than
man, I didn't mean that I possessed all their noble qualities. I
simply meant that I thought and reacted more like a beast than a
man. I have the psychology of a wild beast."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be right; but if I were going out to dinner, I'd
rather go with a man than a tiger."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "That is one of the nice things about being a
beast. You don't have to go to dinners and listen to speeches and
be bored to death."</p>

<p>Corrie laughed. "But one of your fellow beasts may leap on you
and take you for his dinner."</p>

<p>"Or a nice man may come along and shoot you, just for fun."</p>

<p>"You win," said Corrie.</p>

<p>"The others are coming," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Usha tells me."</p>

<p>"Usha? Who is Usha?"</p>

<p>"The wind. It carries to both my ears and my nostrils evidence
that men are coming along the trail. Each race has its distinctive
body odor; so I know these are white men."</p>

<p>A moment later, Rosetti came into view around a curve in the
trail. When he saw Tarzan and Corrie he voiced a whoop of pleasure
and shouted the word back to those behind him. Soon the others
joined them. It was a happy reunion.</p>

<p>"Just like old home week," observed Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"It seems as though you had been gone for weeks, Corrie," said
Jerry.</p>

<p>"I went a long way into the Valley of the Shadow," said Corrie.
"I thought that I should never see any of you again in this world.
Then Tarzan came."</p>

<p>Tak van der Bos came and kissed her. "If my hair hasn't turned
white since you disappeared, then worry doesn't turn hair white.
Don't you ever get out of our sight again, darling."</p>

<p>Jerry wished that he didn't like van der Bos. He would greatly
have enjoyed hating him. Then he thought: You are an idiot, Lucas.
You haven't a ghost of a show anyway, and those two were made for
each other. They are both swell. So Jerry lagged along behind and
left them together as they resumed the march toward the
village.</p>

<p>Tarzan had gone ahead to act as point. The others listened as
Corrie recounted her adventures, telling of Amat's treachery, of
Sarina's unexpected help, of her horrifying experience with Oju,
and of her rescue by Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He is magnificent," she said. "In battle he is terrifying. He
seems to become a wild beast, with the strength and agility of a
tiger guided by the intelligence of a man. He growls like a beast.
I was almost afraid of him. But when the fight was over and he
smiled he was all human again."</p>

<p>"He has added one more debt which we owe him and can never
repay," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Dat guy's sure some guy," said Rosetti, "even if he is a
Britisher. I bet he didn't have nuttin' to do wit' dat Geo'ge
Toid."</p>

<p>"That's a safe bet, Shrimp," said Bubonovitch. "You can also lay
100 to 1 that he didn't run around with Caligula either."</p>

<p>Tak van der Bos found these Americans amusing. He liked them,
but often he could not make head nor tail of what they were talking
about.</p>

<p>"Who was Geo'ge Toid?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is dat king of England wot Mayor Thompson said he would poke
in de snoot if he ever came to Chicago," explained Rosetti.</p>

<p>"You mean George Third?"</p>

<p>"Dat's who I said&mdash;Geo'ge Toid."</p>

<p>"Oh," said van der Bos. Bubonovitch was watching him, and
noticed that he did not smile. He liked him for that. Bubonovitch
could rib Shrimp, but he wouldn't stand for any foreigner ribbing
him.</p>

<p>"This lame brain," he said, jerking a thumb in Rosetti's
direction, "doesn't know that the War of the Revolution is
over."</p>

<p>"You disliked Englishmen because of what George Third did?" Tak
asked Shrimp.</p>

<p>"You said it."</p>

<p>"Maybe you won't think so badly of Englishmen if you'll just
remember that George Third was not an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Wot?"</p>

<p>"He was a German."</p>

<p>"No kiddin'?"</p>

<p>"No kidding. Many of the Englishmen of his day didn't like him
any more than you do."</p>

<p>"So de guy was a Heinie! Dat explains everyt'ing." Shrimp was
satisfied now. He could like Tarzan and not be ashamed of it.</p>

<p>Presently they caught up with Tarzan. He was talking to two
bearded white men. They were sentries posted by the guerrillas who
had occupied the village. The two other trails were similarly
guarded.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the returning party had entered the
kampong; and as they did so, Amat departed into the forest on the
opposite side of the village. He had caught a glimpse of
Rosetti.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CAPT. VAN PRINS and Lieut. de Lettenhove, as well
as several others of the guerrilla force, knew both Corrie and Tak,
whom they had believed to be dead. They gathered around them,
laughing and talking, congratulating them and exchanging snatches
of their various experiences during the more than two years since
they had seen one another. Corrie and Tak asked of news of old
friends. Some were known to be dead, others had been prisoners of
the Japs when last heard of. They spoke in their own tongue.</p>

<p>Jerry, feeling very much an outsider, sought Bubonovitch and
Rosetti. They sat together beneath a tree and cleaned their rifles
and pistols, for since they had captured the equipment of the Japs
they had all that was necessary to keep their weapons cleaned and
oiled, an endless procedure in the humid equatorial atmosphere of
the Sumatran mountains.</p>

<p>Presently van Prins and de Lettenhove joined them to discuss
plans for the future. Corrie and Tak were sitting together in the
shade of another tree at a little distance. Corrie had noticed that
Jerry had been avoiding her of late; so she did not suggest joining
the conference. She wondered if she had done anything to offend
him, or if he were just tired of her company. She was piqued, and
so she redoubled her attentions to Tak van der Bos. Jerry was
keenly aware of this and was miserable. He took no part in the
discussion that was going on. Both Bubonovitch and Rosetti noticed
this and wondered at the change that had come over him.</p>

<p>The conference resulted in a decision that the two parties would
join forces for the time being at least, but it was not thought
wise to remain where they were. When the detail that was to have
been relieved did not return to the base, there would be an
investigation, unquestionably in force; and the Dutchmen did not
wish to risk a major engagement. They had other plans for harassing
the enemy.</p>

<p>It was therefore decided to move to an easily defended position
of which they knew. This would mean backtracking for Tarzan and the
Americans, but van Prins assured them that in the end it would
improve their chances of reaching the southwest coast.</p>

<p>"From where I plan on making camp," he explained, "there is a
comparatively easy route over the summit. You can then move down
the east side of the mountains where, I am informed, there are
comparatively few Japs in the higher reaches, while on this side
there are many. I will furnish you with a map and mark out a route
that will bring you back to the west side at a point where I think
you will find it much easier to reach the coast, if you decide to
persist in what I believe a very foolhardy venture."</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Jerry?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Jerry, awakened from a day dream, looked up blankly. "Think
about what?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at him in surprise. Then he repeated the plan.
"Whatever suits the rest of you suits me," said Jerry
indifferently.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti looked at one another. "Wot the hell's
happened to the 'old man'?" whispered the latter.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch shrugged and looked in the direction of Corrie and
van der Bos. "Cherchez la femme," he said.</p>

<p>"Talk American," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"I think the captain is going to be a misogynist again pretty
soon," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"I getcha. I guess maybe as how I'll be one of dem t'ings again
myself. Trouble is a dame's middle name&mdash;trouble, trouble,
nuttin' but trouble."</p>

<p>"When do you plan on leaving?" Tarzan asked van Prins.</p>

<p>"I think we can remain here safely today and tomorrow. The Japs
won't really commence to worry about that detail for several days,
and then it will take them another day to reach this village. We
can leave here day after tomorrow, early in the morning. That will
give my men time to fix up their foot gear. I can't call the things
we are wearing shoes. The chief here has plenty of material, and
some of the women are helping us make sandals. We were just about
barefoot when we got here. Even if the Japs do come, we shall be
ready for them. Some of my men are cutting a trail from the village
paralleling the main trail toward the Jap base. I'm having them run
it out about five hundred yards. If the Japs come, we'll have a
surprise for them."</p>

<p>The conference broke up. Van Prins went out into the forest to
see how his men were getting ahead with the trail. The other
Dutchmen went to work on their sandals or cleaned their weapons.
Corrie had been surreptitiously watching Jerry. She noticed how
glum he looked and that he only spoke when directly addressed, and
then curtly. Suddenly she thought that he might be ill. She had
been angry with him, but that thought destroyed her anger and
filled her with compassion. She walked over to where he was now
sitting alone, reassembling the Jap pistol that he had stripped and
cleaned. She sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jerry?" she asked. "You're not ill, are
you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. He had worked himself into such a state of utter
misery that he couldn't even be civil.</p>

<p>Corrie looked at him in surprise and hurt. He did not see the
expression on her face; because he pretended to be engrossed with
the pistol. He knew that he was being sophomoric and he hated
himself. What the hell is the matter with me? he thought. Corrie
arose slowly and walked away. Jerry thought about committing
suicide. He was being an ass, and he knew it. But Jerry was very
young and very much in love. He slammed the last piece of the
pistol into place viciously and stood up.</p>

<p>Corrie was walking toward the little house she occupied with the
native girl, Lara. Jerry walked quickly after her. He wanted to
tell her how sorry he was. As she reached the foot of the ladder
leading up into the house, he called to her: "Corrie!" She did not
pause nor look back. She climbed the ladder and disappeared through
the doorway.</p>

<p>He knew that she had heard him. He also knew that Tarzan and
Bubonovitch and Rosetti had witnessed the whole thing. But worst of
all, so had Tak van der Bos. Jerry could feel his face burning. He
stood there for a moment, not knowing what to do. The hell with all
women, he thought. He had faced death many times, but to face his
friends now was worse. It required all his will power to turn
around and walk back to them.</p>

<p>No one said anything as he sat down among them. They appeared
wholly occupied by whatever they were doing. Tarzan broke the
silence. "I am going out to see if I can bring in some fresh meat,"
he said. "Anyone want to come with me?" It was the first time he
had ever asked anyone to hunt with him. They all knew that he meant
Jerry; so no one spoke, waiting for Jerry.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like to, if no one else wants to," he said.</p>

<p>"Come along," said Tarzan. They picked up rifles and went out
into the forest.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti were sitting a little apart from the
Dutchmen. "That was swell of Tarzan," said the former. "I sure felt
sorry for Jerry. I wonder what's got into Corrie."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell; they're all alike," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch shook his head. "It wasn't like Corrie&mdash;she's
different. Jerry must have said something. He's been as grouchy as
a bear with a sore head."</p>

<p>"It's dat Dutchman," said Rosetti. "He and Corrie are just like
dat." He crossed a middle finger over an index finger. "An' I
t'ought all de time she was fallin' for de Cap'n. I told you w'en
we foist picked up dat dame dat it meant trouble."</p>

<p>"You sort of fell for her yourself, Shrimp."</p>

<p>"I liked her all right. Maybe she ain't done nuttin'. Maybe de
Cap'n's de wrong guy. Dey don't have to do nuttin'. Just bein' a
dame spells trouble. Geeze! I t'ink w'en I gets back to Chi I'll
join a convent."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch grinned. "That would be just the place for you,
Shrimp&mdash;a nice convent without any women. If you can't find
one in Chicago, you might try Hollywood. Anything that's screwy,
Hollywood's got."</p>

<p>Shrimp knew that Bubonovitch was ribbing him, but he didn't know
just how. "Yes, sir! I t'ink I'll be a monk."</p>

<p>"The correlative wisecrack is too obvious."</p>

<p>"Talk American, Perfessor."</p>

<p>Tarzan and Jerry were gone a little more than an hour. They
returned to the village with the carcass of a deer. Tarzan had shot
it. Jerry was glad that he had not had to. Of course it was all
right to kill for food, but still he didn't like to kill deer. He
didn't mind killing Japs. That was different. The way he felt this
afternoon, he would have enjoyed killing almost anything. But he
was still glad that he hadn't killed the deer.</p>

<p>That evening, Corrie ate apart with the Dutchmen. She shouldn't
have done it, and she knew that she shouldn't. She should have
carried on just as though nothing had happened. Afterward she
wished that she had, for she realized that now she had definitely
acknowledged the rift. It would be difficult to close it again. It
would probably widen. She was most unhappy; because she loved those
men with whom she had been through so much&mdash;to whom she owed
so much. She was sorry now that she hadn't waited when Jerry had
called to her.</p>

<p>She made up her mind to swallow her pride and go over to them;
but when she did so, Jerry got up and walked away. So she passed
them and went to her house. There she threw herself down on her
sleeping mats and cried. For the first time in years, she
cried.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to a close and Amat was very tired when he
reached the Jap base. He bowed low to the sentry who halted him,
and in the few Japanese words he had learned he tried to explain
that he had important news for the commanding officer.</p>

<p>The sentry called a non-commissioned officer of the guard who
happened to have learned a smattering of the native dialect; and to
him Amat repeated what he had told the sentry, almost forgetting to
bow. So he bowed twice.</p>

<p>The sergeant took him to the adjutant, to whom Amat bowed three
times. When the sergeant had reported, the adjutant questioned
Amat, and what Amat told him excited him greatly. He lost no time
in conducting Amat to the commanding officer, a Col. Kanji Tajiri,
to whom Amat bowed four times.</p>

<p>When the colonel learned that some forty of his men had been
killed, he was furious. Amat also told him just how many white men
there were in the party in his village. He told about the sentries
out on the trails. He told about the white girl. He told
everything.</p>

<p>Tajiri gave orders that Amat should be fed and given a place to
sleep. He also directed that two full companies should march at
dawn to attack the village and destroy the white men. He himself
would go in command, and they would take Amat along. If Amat had
known this, he would not have slept so easily as he did.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT breakfast the following morning, the cleavage
was again definitely apparent. The Dutch prepared and ate their
breakfast a little apart from the Americans and Tarzan. The
Englishman knew that it was all very wrong and very stupid and that
if the condition persisted it would affect the morale of the entire
company. At the same time, however, he could not but be amused; for
it was so obvious that the two principals who were responsible were
very much in love with each other. They were probably the only ones
who did not realize this. He knew that they must be in love;
because it is only people who are very much in love who treat each
other so damnably.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, Tarzan and the Americans went into the
forest to inspect the trail the Dutchmen had cut. They found that
it gave excellent concealment from the main trail, but Tarzan
thought that the sentry post was not far enough in advance of the
trail's outer end.</p>

<p>Capt. van Prins had posted four men on this post with orders to
hold up the Japs as long as possible should they come, falling back
slowly to give the main force of the guerrillas time to come from
the village and prepare the ambush.</p>

<p>"I think he should have had one man very much farther in
advance," Tarzan said to Jerry, "and at least half his force posted
constantly in this paralleling trail. He is not prepared for a
surprise, and he is not giving the Japs credit for the cunning they
possess."</p>

<p>"They'll have a man way out in front," said Jerry. "He'll be
well camouflaged, and he'll sneak through the jungle like a snake.
He'll see the guys on this post and then go back and report. Pretty
soon some more will sneak up and toss a few grenades. That'll be
the end of the sentries, and the Japs will rush the village before
van Prins can get his men out here to ambush them."</p>

<p>"Let's go back and talk with him," suggested Tarzan.</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast, Lara had sought out Corrie. "I have
just discovered," she said, "that Amat did not return to the
village last night. He left yesterday. I know him. He is a bad man.
I am sure that he went to the big Japanese camp and reported
everything that has happened here."</p>

<p>Corrie was repeating this to van Prins when Tarzan and Jerry
returned. The Dutchman called them over; and as they came, Corrie
walked away. Van Prins told them of Lara's warning, and Tarzan
suggested the plan that he and Jerry had discussed.</p>

<p>"I think I'll put most of my force out there," said van Prins.
"I'll just leave a welcoming committee here in case some of them
break through to the village."</p>

<p>"It might be a good idea to withdraw your sentries entirely,"
suggested Jerry. "Then the Japs will walk right into the ambush
without any warning."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said van Prins. "I'd like a little
advance information myself, or we might be the ones who would be
surprised."</p>

<p>Tarzan didn't agree with him, but he said, "I'll get advance
information to you much sooner than your sentries could. I'll go
out four or five miles, and when the Japs show up I'll be back with
the word long before they reach your ambush."</p>

<p>"But suppose they see you?"</p>

<p>"They won't."</p>

<p>"You seem pretty sure of yourself, Sir," said the Dutchman,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do," said van Prins. "Just to make
assurance doubly sure, I'll leave my sentries out. I'll tell them
that when you come back, you'll order them in. How's that?"</p>

<p>"Fine," said Tarzan. "I'll go along out now, and you can get
your men camouflaged and posted for the ambush. O.K.?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," said van Prins.</p>

<p>Tarzan swung into a tree and was gone. The Dutchman shook his
head. "If I had a battalion like him, I could pretty near chase the
Japs off this island."</p>

<p>Jerry, Bubonovitch, and Rosetti, loaded down with ammunition and
hand grenades, preceded the guerrillas into the ambush. They went
to the far end of the paralleling trail and prepared to make
themselves comfortable and also inconspicuous. With leaves and
vines they camouflaged their heads and shoulders until they became
a part of the surrounding jungle. Even had there not been several
feet of shrubbery intervening between them and the main trail, an
enemy would have had to be right on top of them before he could
have discovered them.</p>

<p>The guerrillas were soon stationed and busy camouflaging
themselves. Capt. van Prins walked back and forth along the main
trail checking on the effectiveness of each man's camouflage.
Finally he gave his orders.</p>

<p>"Don't fire until I fire, unless you are discovered; then start
firing. A couple of men at the head of the line can use grenades if
they can throw them far enough so as not to endanger our own
people. The same goes for a couple at the opposite end, in case
some of the Japs get past us. Try to get the Japs directly in front
of you. If everything works out as I hope, each one of you will
have Japs in front of him when I give the signal to commence
firing. Any questions?"</p>

<p>"If they retreat, shall we follow them?" asked one of the
men.</p>

<p>"No. We might run into an ambush ourselves. All I want to do is
give them a little punishment and put the fear of God in them for
Dutchmen." He came and took up a position about the center of the
line.</p>

<p>Jerry presently discovered that van der Bos was next to him in
line. Tak had had a little talk with Corrie shortly before. "What's
the matter between you and Jerry?" he had asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was anything the matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you do. What's wrong with him?"</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in what's wrong with him. I'm not interested
in him at all. He's a boor, and I'm not interested in boors."</p>

<p>But Tak knew that she was interested, and he suddenly conceived
an idea of what the trouble was. It came to him in a flash and made
him voice a little whistle of amazement.</p>

<p>"What are you whistling about?" Corrie had asked.</p>

<p>"I whistle in amazement that there are so many damn fools in the
world."</p>

<p>"Meaning me?"</p>

<p>"Meaning you and Jerry and myself."</p>

<p>"Whistle if you like, but mind your own business."</p>

<p>Tak chucked her under the chin and grinned; then he went out
with van Prins into the forest.</p>

<p>Jerry was not particularly pleased to have van der Bos next to
him. Of all the people he could think of van der Bos was the one he
was least desirous of being chummy with. He hoped the fellow
wouldn't try to start a conversation.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we're in for a long wait," said van der Bos.
Jerry grunted.</p>

<p>"And no smoking," added van der Bos. Jerry grunted again.</p>

<p>As Jerry was not looking at him, van der Bos allowed himself the
luxury of a grin. "Corrie wanted to come out and get into the
fight," he said; "but van Prins and I turned thumbs down on that
idea."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Corrie's a great little girl," continued van der Bos. "We've
known each other all our lives. She and my wife have been chums
ever since either of them can remember. Corrie's exactly like a
sister to us."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Van der Bos was enjoying himself greatly.
Jerry was not. Finally he said, "I didn't know you were
married."</p>

<p>"That only just occurred to me a few minutes ago," said van der
Bos.</p>

<p>Jerry held out his hand. "Thanks," he said. "I am a goddam
fool."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said van der Bos.</p>

<p>"Did your wife get away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We tried to get old van der Meer to send Corrie and her
mother out, too; but the stubborn old fool wouldn't. God! and what
a price he paid. That man's stubbornness was notorious all over the
island. He gloried in it. Aside from that, he was a very fine
person."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that Corrie has inherited any of her father's
stubbornness?" asked Jerry, fearfully.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised." Van der Bos was having the time of
his life. He liked this American, but he felt that he had a little
punishment coming to him.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti noticed with growing wonder the
cordiality that existed between Jerry and van der Bos. As the day
wore on, they also noticed that "the old man" was becoming more and
more like his former self.</p>

<p>They commented on this. "He's gettin' almost human again,"
whispered Rosetti. "Whatever was eatin' him must o' quit."</p>

<p>"Probably died of indigestion," said Bubonovitch. "We've known
'the old man' a long while, but we've never seen him like he's been
the last day or so."</p>

<p>"We never seen him wit' a dame around. I'm tellin'
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me. I know it all by heart. Dames are bad
medicine. They spell nothing but trouble. You give me a pain in the
neck. The trouble with you is that you never knew a decent girl. At
least not till you met Corrie. And you haven't met my wife. You'd
sing a different tune if you fell in love with some girl. And when
you do, I'll bet you fall heavy. Your kind always does."</p>

<p>"Not a chance. I wouldn't have Dorothy Lamour if she got down on
her knees and asked me."</p>

<p>"She won't," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>This edifying conversation was interrupted by the return of
Tarzan. He sought out van Prins. "Your little brown cousins are
coming," he said. "They are about two miles away. There are two
full companies, I should judge. They have light machine guns and
those dinky little mortars they use. A colonel is in command. They
have a point of three men out only about a hundred yards. Your
sentries are coming in."</p>

<p>"You have certainly done a swell job, Sir," said van Prins. "I
can't thank you enough." He turned to the men nearest him. "Pass
the word along that there is to be no more talking. The enemy will
be along in thirty-five or forty minutes."</p>

<p>He turned back to Tarzan. "Pardon me, Sir," he said; "but they
are not brown. The bastards are yellow."</p>

<p>Groen de Lettenhove had been left in command of the guerrillas
who had been ordered to remain in the village. He was trying to
persuade Corrie to find a place of safety against the possibility
that some of the enemy might break through into the village.</p>

<p>"You may need every rifle you can get," she countered; "and
furthermore, I haven't settled my account with the Japs."</p>

<p>"But you might get killed or wounded, Corrie."</p>

<p>"So might you and your men. Maybe we'd all better go and
hide."</p>

<p>"You're hopeless," he said. "I might have known better than to
argue with a woman."</p>

<p>"Don't think of me as a woman. I'm another rifle, and I'm a
veteran. I'm also a darned good shot."</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by a burst of rifle fire from
the forest.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">JERRY was the first to see the approaching Japs,
as he happened to be in a position that gave him a view of about a
hundred feet of the trail just where it curved to the right toward
the village directly in front of him. It was the three-man point.
They were advancing cautiously, watching the trail ahead of them.
They were evidently so sure that their attack would be a surprise
that they did not even consider the possibility of an ambush. They
paid no attention to the jungle on either side of the trail. They
passed the men lying in wait for the main body and stopped at the
edge of the forest. The village lay below them. It appeared
deserted. The guerrillas, concealed in and behind houses, saw them
and waited.</p>

<p>Presently, Jerry saw the main body approaching. The colonel
marched at the head of the column with drawn samurai sword. Behind
him slogged Amat, and behind Amat a soldier walked with the tip of
his bayonet aimed at a Sumatran kidney. Evidently, Amat had
attempted to desert somewhere along the route. He did not appear
happy. Shrimp saw him pass, and mentally cautioned his trigger
finger to behave.</p>

<p>The trail was crowded with the men of the first company. They
had closed up into a compact mass when the head of the column was
halted behind the point at the edge of the forest. Then van Prins
fired, and instantly a withering volley was poured into the ranks
of the surprised enemy. Jerry hurled three grenades in quick
succession down the back trail into the second company.</p>

<p>The Japs fired wildly into the jungle; then some who had not
been hit turned and broke in retreat. A few leaped into the
undergrowth with fixed bayonets in an effort to get into close
quarters with the white men. Shrimp was enjoying a field day. He
picked off Japs as fast as he could fire, until his rifle got so
hot that it jammed.</p>

<p>Among those in the mad rush to escape were the colonel and Amat.
Miraculously they had so far escaped unscathed. The colonel was
shrieking in Japanese, which Amat could not understand; but he had
glanced behind him, and was aware that the colonel had lethal
designs upon him. As he fled, Amat screamed. He would have been
deeply hurt had he known that the colonel was accusing him of
having traitorously led them into ambush, and that it was for this
reason that he wished to kill Amat.</p>

<p>Rosetti saw them just before they came abreast of him. "Nothing
doing, yellow belly," he yelled. "That guy is my meat. They don't
nobody else kill him if I can help it." Then he shot the colonel
with his pistol. He took another shot at Amat and missed.
"Doggone!" said Rosetti, as the terrified native dove into the
underbrush farther along the trail.</p>

<p>Wholly disorganized, the remainder of the Jap force fled back
into the forest, leaving their dead and wounded. Van Prins detailed
a number of men to act as rear guard, others to collect the enemy's
weapons and ammunition, and the remainder to carry the Jap wounded
and their own into the village.</p>

<p>A moment later, a wounded Jap shot the Dutchman who was trying
to help him. Shortly thereafter there were no wounded Japs.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti, who had jumped out into the trail to
fire on the fleeing enemy, were helping gather up the abandoned Jap
weapons and ammunition. Suddenly, Rosetti stopped and looked
around. "Where's the Cap'n?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jerry was nowhere in sight. The two men forced their way back
into the underbrush where they had last seen him. They found him
there, lying on his back, his shirt, over his left breast,
blood-soaked. Both men dropped to their knees beside him.</p>

<p>"He ain't dead," said Rosetti. "He's breathing."</p>

<p>"He mustn't die," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"You said a mouthful, soldier," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>Very tenderly, they picked him up and started back toward the
village. The Dutchmen were carrying in three of their own dead and
five wounded.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw the two sergeants carrying Jerry. He came and looked
at the unconscious man. "Bad?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, Sir," said Bubonovitch. They passed on, leaving
Tarzan behind.</p>

<p>As the men entered the village with their pathetic burdens,
those who had been left behind came to meet them. The dead were
laid in a row and covered with sleeping mats. The wounded were
placed in the shade of trees. Among the guerrillas was a doctor. He
had no medicines, no sulfanilamide, no anesthetics. He just did the
best he could, and Corrie helped him. At the edge of the jungle,
men were already digging the graves for the three dead. Native
women were boiling water in which to sterilize bandages.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti were sitting beside Jerry when the
doctor and Corrie finally reached him. When Corrie saw who it was,
she went white and caught her breath in a sudden gasp. Both
Bubonovitch and Rosetti were watching her. Her reaction told them
more than any words could have, because words are sometimes spoken
to deceive.</p>

<p>With the help of the two sergeants and Corrie, each trying to do
something for the man they all loved, the doctor removed Jerry's
shirt and examined the wound carefully.</p>

<p>"Is it very bad?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied the doctor. "It certainly missed his
heart, and I'm sure it missed his lungs, also. He hasn't brought up
any blood, has he, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"He's suffering mostly from shock and partly from loss of blood.
I think he's going to be all right. Help me turn him
over&mdash;very gently, now."</p>

<p>There was a small round hole in Jerry's back just to the right
of his left shoulder blade. It had not bled much.</p>

<p>"He must have been born under a lucky star," said the doctor.
"We won't have to probe, and that's a good thing; because I have no
instruments. The bullet bored straight through, clean as a
whistle." He washed the wounds with sterile water, and bandaged
them loosely. "That's all I can do," he said. "One of you stay with
him. When he comes to, keep him quiet."</p>

<p>"I'll stay," said Corrie.</p>

<p>"You men can help me over here, if you will," said the
doctor.</p>

<p>"If you need us, Miss, just holler," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>Corrie sat beside the wounded man and bathed his face with cool
water. She didn't know what else to do, but she knew she wanted to
do something for him. Whatever mild rancor she had thought that she
felt toward him had been expunged by the sight of his blood and his
helplessness.</p>

<p>Presently he sighed and opened his eyes. He blinked them a few
times, an expression of incredulity in them, as he saw the girl's
face close above his. Then he smiled; and reaching up, he pressed
her hand.</p>

<p>"You're going to be all right, Jerry," she said.</p>

<p>"I am all right&mdash;now," he said.</p>

<p>He had held her hand for but a second. Now she took his and
stroked it. They just smiled at each other. All was right with the
world.</p>

<p>Capt. van Prins was having litters built for the wounded. He
came over to see Jerry. "How you feeling?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"Good. I've decided to move out of here just as soon as
possible. The Japs are almost sure to sneak back on us tonight, and
this is no place to defend successfully. I know a place that is. We
can make it in two marches. As soon as the litters are finished and
our dead buried, we'll move out of here. I'm going to burn the
village as a lesson to the natives. These people have been
collaborating with the enemy. They must be punished."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Corrie. "That would be most unfair. You would be
punishing the innocent with the guilty. Take Lara, for instance.
She has helped us twice. She has told me that there are only two
people here who wanted to help the Japs&mdash;the chief and Amat.
It would be cruel to burn down the homes of those who are loyal.
Remember&mdash;if it had not been for Lara, the Japs might have
taken us by surprise."</p>

<p>"I guess that you are right, Corrie," said van Prins. "Anyway,
you've given me a better idea."</p>

<p>He walked away, and ten minutes later the chief was taken to one
side of the village and shot by a firing squad.</p>

<p>The guerrillas gathered around the graves of their dead. The
doctor said a short prayer, three volleys were fired, and the
graves were filled. The wounded were lifted onto the litters, the
rear guard marched into the village and the little company was
ready to move.</p>

<p>Jerry objected to being carried, insisting that he could walk.
Bubonovitch, Rosetti, and Corrie were trying to dissuade him when
the doctor walked up. "What's going on here?" he asked. They told
him. "You stay on that litter, young man," he said to Jerry, and to
Bubonovitch and Rosetti, "If he tries to get off of it, tie him
down."</p>

<p>Jerry grinned. "I'll be good, Doc," he said, "but I hate to have
four men carrying me when I can walk just as well as not."</p>

<p>Following the shooting of the chief, the natives were afraid.
They did not know how many more might be shot. Lara came to Corrie
just as van Prins came along. He recognized the girl.</p>

<p>"You can tell your people," he said, "that largely because of
you and the help you gave us we did not burn the village as we
intended. We punished only the chief. He had been helping our
enemies. When we come back, if Amat is here we will punish him
also. The rest of you need never fear us if you do not help the
enemy. We know that you have to treat them well, or be mistreated.
We understand that, but do not help them any more than is
absolutely necessary." He took a quick look around the kampong.
"Where is Tarzan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Bubonovitch. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Geeze," said Rosetti. "He never come back to the village after
the scrap. But he wasn't wounded. He was all right when we seen him
last, just before we brung the Cap'n out."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about him," said Bubonovitch. "He can take care of
himself and all the rest of us into the bargain."</p>

<p>"I can leave some men here to tell him where we are going to
camp," said van Prins.</p>

<p>"You don't even have to do that," said Bubonovitch. "He'll find
us. Lara can tell him which way we went out. He'll track us better
than a bloodhound."</p>

<p>"All right," said van Prins, "let's get going."</p>

<p><br><br>When Tarzan had looked at the wounded American, the latter had
seemed in a very bad way. Tarzan was sure the wound was fatal. His
anger against the Japs flared, for he liked this young flier.
Unnoticed by the others, he swung into the trees and was off on the
trail of the enemy.</p>

<p>He caught up with them at a point where a captain and two
lieutenants had rallied them&mdash;the only surviving officers of
the two companies. High in the trees above them, a grim figure
looked down upon them. It fitted an arrow to its bow. The twang of
the bow string was drowned by the jabbering of the monkey-men, the
shouted commands of their officers. The captain lurched forward
upon his face, a bamboo shaft through his heart. As he fell upon
it, the arrow was driven through his body, so that it protruded
from his back.</p>

<p>For a moment the Japs were stunned to silence; then the shouting
commenced again, as they fired into the jungle in all directions
with rifles and machine guns. Seventy-five feet above their
bullets, Tarzan watched them, another bolt ready to be shot.</p>

<p>This time he picked out one of the lieutenants. As he loosed the
missile, he moved quietly to another position several hundred feet
away. As their second officer fell, struck down mysteriously, the
Japs commenced to show signs of panic. Now they fired wildly into
the underbrush and into the trees.</p>

<p>When the last officer went down the Japs began to run along the
trail in the direction of their main camp. They had had enough. But
Tarzan had not. He followed them until all his arrows were gone,
each one embedded in the body of a Jap. The screaming wounded were
tearing arrows from backs and bellies. The silent dead were left
behind for the tigers and the wild dogs.</p>

<p>Tarzan unslung the rifle from across his back and emptied a clip
into the broken ranks of the fleeing enemy; then he turned and
swung back in the direction of the village. His American friend had
been avenged.</p>

<p>He did not follow the trail. He did not even travel in the
direction of the village for long. He ranged deep into the primeval
forest, viewing ancient things that perhaps no other human eye had
ever looked upon&mdash;patriarchs of the forest, moss covered and
hoary with age, clothed in giant creepers, vines, and huge air
plants, garlanded with orchids.</p>

<p>As the wind changed and a vagrant breeze blew into his face, he
caught the scent of man. And presently he saw a little trail, such
as men make. Dropping lower, he saw a snare, such as primitive
hunters set for small game. He had come into the forest to be alone
and get away from men. He was not antisocial; but occasionally he
longed for solitude, or the restful companionship of beasts. Even
the jabbering, scolding monkeys were often a welcome relief, for
they were amusing. Few men were.</p>

<p>There were many monkeys here. They ran away from him at first,
but when he spoke to them in their own language, they took courage
and came closer. He even coaxed one little fellow to come and perch
on his hand. It reminded him of little Nkima, boastful,
belligerent, diminutive, arrant little coward, which loved Tarzan
and which Tarzan loved. Africa! How far, far away it seemed.</p>

<p>He talked to the little monkey as he had talked to Nkima, and
presently the little fellow's courage increased, and he leaped to
Tarzan's shoulder. Like Nkima, he seemed to sense safety there; and
there he rode as Tarzan swung through the trees.</p>

<p>The man's curiosity had been aroused by the strange scent spoor,
and so he followed it. It led him to a small lake in the waters of
which, along the shore, were a number of rude shelters built of
branches and leaves upon platforms that were supported a few feet
above the water by crude pilings that had been driven into the mud
of the lake's bottom.</p>

<p>The shelters were open on all sides. Their occupants were a
people below average height, their skins a rich olive brown, their
hair jet black. They were naked savages whom civilization had never
touched. Fortunate people, thought Tarzan. Several men and women
were in the water fishing with nets. The men carried bows and
arrows.</p>

<p>The little monkey said that they were bad gomangani. "So manu,"
he said&mdash;eat monkey. Then he commenced to scream at them and
scold, feeling secure in doing so by virtue of distance and the
presence of his big new friend. Tarzan smiled; it reminded him so
much of Nkima.</p>

<p>The monkey made so much noise that some of the natives looked
up. Tarzan made the universal sign of peace that has been debauched
and befouled by a schizophrenic in a greasy raincoat, but the
natives threatened him with their arrows. They jabbered and
gesticulated at him, doubtless warning him away. The Lord of the
Jungle was in full sympathy with them and admired their good
judgment. Were they always successful in keeping white men at a
distance they would continue to enjoy the peace and security of
their idyllic existence.</p>

<p>He watched them for a few minutes, and then turned back into the
forest to wander aimlessly, enjoying this brief interlude in the
grim business of war. Keta, the little monkey, rode sometimes on
the man's shoulder. Sometimes he swung through the trees with him.
He seemed to have attached himself permanently to the big
tarmangani.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">S/SGT. Tony Rosetti squatted on the sentry
platform on the trail outside the former camp of the outlaws where
the guerrillas were now bivouacked for a day to let their wounded
rest.</p>

<p>His tour of duty was about completed, and he was waiting for his
relief when he saw a figure approaching him along the trail. It was
a slender, boyish figure; but even in the dim, cathedral light of
the forest afternoon the sergeant realized that, notwithstanding
the trousers, the rifle, the pistol, the parang, and the ammunition
belt, it was no boy. When the woman caught sight of Rosetti, she
stopped.</p>

<p>"Halt!" commanded Rosetti, bringing his rifle to the ready.</p>

<p>"I am already halted," said the woman in good English.</p>

<p>"Who are you and where do you think you're goin' wit' all dat
armor?"</p>

<p>"You must be the cute little sergeant Corrie van der Meer told
me about&mdash;the one who hates women and speaks funny
English."</p>

<p>"I don't speak English. I speak American. And wot's funny about
it? And who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Sarina. I am looking for Corrie van der Meer."</p>

<p>"Advance," said Rosetti. Then he dropped down off the platform
into the trail. He stood there with a finger on the trigger of his
rifle and the point of his bayonet belly high. The woman came and
stopped a few feet from him.</p>

<p>"I wish that you would aim that thing some other way," she
said.</p>

<p>"Nuttin' doin', sister. You belong to dat outlaw gang. How do I
know you ain't just a front an' de rest of dem is trailin' behind
you? If dey are, youse is goin' to get shot, sister."</p>

<p>"I'm alone," said Sarina.</p>

<p>"Maybe you are, an' maybe you ain't. Drop dat gun an' stick up
your mitts. I'm goin' to frisk you."</p>

<p>"Speak English, if you can," said Sarina. "I don't understand
American. What are mitts, and what is frisk?"</p>

<p>"Put up your hands, an' I'll show you what friskin' is. An' make
it snappy, sister." Sarina hesitated. "I ain't goin' to bite you,"
said Rosetti; "but I ain't goin' to take no chances, neither. Wen
you've sloughed dat arsenal, I'll take you into camp as soon as my
relief shows up."</p>

<p>Sarina laid her rifle down and raised her hands. Shrimp made her
face the other way; then, from behind, he took her pistol and
parang. "Okay," he said. "You can put 'em down now." He put her
weapons in a pile behind him. "Now you know wot frisk means," he
said.</p>

<p>Sarina sat down beside the trail. "You are a good soldier," she
said. "I like good soldiers. And you are cute."</p>

<p>Rosetti grinned. "You ain't so bad yourself, sister." Even a
misogynist may have an eye for beauty. "How come you're wanderin'
around in de woods alone?&mdash;if you are alone."</p>

<p>"I am alone. I quit those people. I want to be with Corrie van
der Meer. She should have a woman with her. A woman gets very tired
of seeing only men all the time. I shall look after her. She is
here, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yep, she's in camp; but she don't need no dame to look after
her. She's got four men dat have made a pretty good job of it so
far."</p>

<p>"I know," said Sarina. "She has told me, but she will be glad to
have a woman with her." After a silence, she said, "Do you suppose
that they will let me stay?"</p>

<p>"If Corrie says so, dey will. If you are really de dame dat
broke her outta dat camp, we'll all be strong for you."</p>

<p>"American is a strange language, but I think I know what you
were trying to say: If I am really the woman who helped Corrie
escape from Hooft, you will like me. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Ain't dat wot I said?"</p>

<p>A man coming along the trail from the direction of the camp
interrupted their conversation. He was a Dutchman coming to relieve
Rosetti. He did not speak English. His expression showed his
surprise when he saw Sarina, and he questioned Rosetti in
Dutch.</p>

<p>"No soap, Dutchie," said the American.</p>

<p>"He did not ask for soap," explained Sarina. "He asked about
me."</p>

<p>"You savvy his lingo?" asked Shrimp.</p>

<p>Sarina shook her head. "Please try to speak English," she said.
"I cannot understand you. What is 'savvy his lingo'?"</p>

<p>"Do you talk Dutch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Den wot did he say?"</p>

<p>"He asked about me."</p>

<p>"Well tell him, and also tell him to bring in your armor w'en he
comes off. I can't pack dat mess an' guard a prisoner all at de
same time."</p>

<p>Sarina smiled and translated. The man answered her in Dutch and
nodded to Rosetti. "Get goin'," said the sergeant to Sarina. He
followed her along the trail into camp, and took her to Jerry, who
was lying on a litter beneath a tree.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Rosetti reportin' wit' a prisoner, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Corrie, who was sitting beside Jerry, looked up; and when she
recognized Sarina, she sprang to her feet. "Sarina!" she cried.
"What in the world are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I came to be with you. Tell them to let me stay." She spoke in
Dutch, and Corrie translated to Jerry.</p>

<p>"As far as I am concerned she can stay if you want her to," said
Jerry; "but I suppose that Capt. van Prins will have to decide.
Take your prisoner and report to Capt. van Prins, sergeant."</p>

<p>Rosetti, who recognized no higher authority than that of Jerry,
showed his disgust; but he obeyed. "Come along, sister," he said to
Sarina.</p>

<p>"All right, brother," she replied; "but you don't have to keep
that bayonet in my back all the time. I know you are a good
soldier, but you don't have to overdo it." Corrie looked at her in
surprise. This was the first intimation she had had that Sarina
spoke English. And good English, too, she thought. She wondered
where Sarina had learned it.</p>

<p>"Okay, sweetheart," said Rosetti. "I guess you won't try to make
no break now."</p>

<p>"I'll come along," said Corrie. "If I vouch for you, I am sure
Capt. van Prins will let you remain with us."</p>

<p>They found the captain, and he listened intently to all that
Sarina and Corrie had to say. Then he asked, "Why did you choose to
join that outlaw band and stay with it?"</p>

<p>"It was either them or the Japs," said Sarina. "I have always
intended to leave them and join a guerrilla company when I could
find one. This is the first opportunity I have had."</p>

<p>"If Miss van der Meer vouches for you and Capt. Lucas has no
objection, you may remain."</p>

<p>"Then that settles it," said Corrie. "Thanks, Kervyn."</p>

<p>Rosetti no longer had a prisoner, but he walked back with Corrie
and Sarina to where Jerry lay. He pretended that he came to inquire
about Jerry's wound, but he sat down and remained after Jerry had
assured him that he was all right.</p>

<p>At a little distance from them, Bubonovitch was cleaning his
rifle. He thought that Rosetti would soon join him, and then he
could ask about the woman Shrimp had brought in. But Shrimp did not
join him. He remained with Jerry and the two women. It was most
unlike Shrimp, to choose the society of ladies when he could avoid
it. Bubonovitch was puzzled; so he went over and joined the
party.</p>

<p>Sarina was telling about her encounter with Rosetti. "He told me
to stick up my mitts, and said he was going to frisk me. American
is a very funny language."</p>

<p>Jerry was laughing. "Rosetti doesn't speak American&mdash;just
Chicagoese."</p>

<p>"Where in the world did you learn to speak English, Sarina?"
asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"In a Catholic missionary school in the Gilberts. My father
always took my mother and me on all his cruises. Except for the two
years I spent at the mission at Tarawa, I lived my entire life on
board his schooner until I was twenty-nine. My mother died when I
was still a little girl, but my father kept me with him. He was a
very wicked man, but he was always kind to us. We cruised all over
the South Seas, and about every two years we made the Gilberts,
trading at different islands along the way, with piracy and murder
as a side line.</p>

<p>"Father wanted me to have an education; so, when I was twelve,
he left me at that mission school until his next trip two years
later. I learned a great deal there. From my father, I learned
Dutch. I think he was a well educated man. He had a library of very
good books on his ship. He never told me anything about his
past&mdash;not even his true name. Everybody called him Big Jon. He
taught me navigation. From the time I was fourteen I was his first
mate. It was not a nice job for a girl, as father's crews were
usually made up of the lowest types of criminals. No one else would
sail with him. I got a smattering of Japanese and Chinese from
various crew members. We shipped all nationalities. Oftentimes
father shanghaied them. When father was drunk, I captained the
ship. It was a tough job, and I had to be tough. I carried on with
the help of a couple of pistols. I was never without them."</p>

<p>Rosetti never took his eyes from Sarina. He seemed hypnotized by
her. Bubonovitch watched him with something akin to amazement.
However, he had to admit that Sarina was not hard on the eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is your father now?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Probably in Hell. One of his murders finally caught up with
him, and he was hanged. It was after he was arrested that Mr. and
Mrs. van der Meer were so kind to me."</p>

<p>The gathering broke up a moment later, when the doctor came to
check on Jerry. Corrie and Sarina went to the shelter occupied by
the former, and Bubonovitch and Rosetti went and sat down in front
of theirs.</p>

<p>"Wot a dame!" exclaimed Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Who? Corrie?"</p>

<p>Shrimp shot a quick glance at Bubonovitch and caught the tail
end of a fleeting smile. He guessed he was being ribbed.</p>

<p>"No;" he said. "I was referrin' to Eleanor."</p>

<p>"Did you by any chance notice that pistol packin' mamma with
Corrie?" asked Bubonovitch. "Now there is a cute little piece of
femininity after my own heart. I sure fell for her."</p>

<p>"You got a wife an' a kid," Shrimp reminded him.</p>

<p>"My affection is merely platonic. I shouldn't care to have a
lady pirate take me too seriously. I suppose that if any of her
gentlemen friends annoyed her, she made them walk the plank."</p>

<p>"Just think of dat little kid alone on a ship wit' a lot of
pirates an' her ol' man drunk!"</p>

<p>"I sort of got the impression that the little lady can take care
of herself. Just take a slant at her background. You remember
Corrie told us one of her grandfathers was a head hunter and the
other was a cannibal, and now it develops that her father was a
pirate and a murderer. And just to make the whole picture perfect
Sarina was doing life in the clink for a little murder of her
own."</p>

<p>"Just the same she's awful pretty," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Migawd!" exclaimed Bubonovitch. "Et tu, Brute!"</p>

<p>"I don't know wot you're talkin' about; but if you're crackin'
wise about dat little dame&mdash;don't."</p>

<p>"I was not cracking wise. I wouldn't think of offending your
sensibilities for the world, Shrimp. I was merely recalling a
statement you made quite recently. Let's see&mdash;how did it go?
'I wouldn't have Dorothy Lamour if she got down on her knees and
asked me!'"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't. I wouldn't have none of 'em. But can't a guy
say a dame's pretty widout you soundin' off?"</p>

<p>"Shrimpy, I saw you looking at her&mdash;goggle-eyed. I know the
symptoms. You've gone plain ga-ga."</p>

<p>"You're nuts."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THEY broke camp the following morning and moved
slowly, the wounded men still litter-borne. Where the trail was
wide enough, Corrie walked beside Jerry's litter. Sarina was behind
her, and Rosetti walked with Sarina. Bubonovitch and several
Dutchmen formed a rear guard. As none of the latter spoke English
and Bubonovitch spoke no Dutch, the American had opportunity for
meditation. Among other things, he meditated on the remarkable
effect that some women had on some men. Reefers or snow made men
goofy. Corrie and Sarina seemed to have a similar effect on Jerry
and Rosetti. In Jerry's case it was not so remarkable. But Shrimp!
Shrimp was a confirmed woman hater, yet all of a sudden he had gone
overboard for a brown-skinned Eurasian murderess old enough to be
his mother.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch had to admit that Sarina was plenty good-looking.
That was the hell of it. He was mighty fond of Rosetti, and so he
hoped that the little sergeant didn't go too far. He didn't know
much about women, and Sarina didn't seem exactly the safe type to
learn from. Bubonovitch recalled a verse from Kipling;</p>

<p class="poem">She knifed me one night<br>
'cause I wished she was white,<br>
An' I learned about women from 'er.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch sighed. After all, he thought, maybe Shrimp wasn't
altogether wrong when he said, "Dey don't have to do nuttin'. Just
bein' a dame spells trouble."</p>

<p>He abandoned this line of thought as unprofitable, and commenced
to wonder about Tarzan. Jerry was wondering about him, too; and he
voiced his misgivings to Corrie. "I'm commencing to worry about
Tarzan," he said. "He's been gone two days now, and shortly after
he disappeared some of the men thought they heard firing far off in
the forest from the direction in which the Japs retreated."</p>

<p>"But what in he world would he be doing back there?" objected
Corrie.</p>

<p>"He is not like other men; so it would be useless for one of us
to try to imagine what might impel him to the commission of any
act. At times, as you well know, he acts like a wild beast. So
there must be stimuli which cause him to think and react like a
wild beast. You know how he feels about taking life, yet you heard
him say that it was his duty to kill Japs."</p>

<p>"And you think he may have followed them in order to kill some
more of them?" suggested Corrie.</p>

<p>"Yes, and maybe got killed himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! That is too terrible, even to think."</p>

<p>"I know, but it is possible. And if he doesn't show up, we'll
have to carry on without him. Cripes! I haven't half realized how
dependent we have been on him. We'd certainly have been on short
rations most of the time if he hadn't been along to hunt for
us."</p>

<p>"I should long since have quit needing rations but for him,"
said Corrie. "I still see that tiger sometimes in my dreams. And
Oju&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>They were silent for a while. Jerry lay with his eyes half
closed. He was rolling his head slightly from side to side.
"Feeling all right?" Corrie asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;fine. I wonder how much farther it is to camp."</p>

<p>"I think Kervyn plans on camping for the night about where the
outlaws were camping when I escaped," said Corrie. "That is not
far." She noticed that Jerry's face was very red, and placed a hand
on his forehead. She dropped back and whispered to Sarina, and word
was passed down the line for the doctor. Then she returned to the
side of Jerry's litter.</p>

<p>The American was muttering incoherently. She spoke to him, but
he did not reply. He was turning restlessly, and she had to
restrain him to prevent his rolling off the litter. She was
terribly frightened.</p>

<p>She did not speak when Dr. Reyd came up to the other side of the
litter. Jerry's condition was too obvious to require explanation.
Practically the only tool of his profession that Dr. Reyd had
salvaged was a clinical thermometer. When he read it two minutes
later, he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Bad?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"Not too good. But I don't understand it. I expected him to run
a little fever the night he was wounded, but he didn't. I thought
he was pretty safe by now."</p>

<p>"Will he&mdash;? Will he&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked across the litter at her and smiled. "Let's
not worry until we have to," he said. "Millions of people have
survived much worse wounds and higher temperatures."</p>

<p>"But can't you do something for him?"</p>

<p>Reyd shrugged. "I have nothing with which to do. Perhaps it is
just as well. He is young, strong, in good condition, and
physically as near perfect as a man can be. Nature is a damn good
doctor, Corrie."</p>

<p>"But you'll stay here with him, won't you, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And don't you worry."</p>

<p>Jerry mumbled, "Three Zeros at two o'clock," and sat up.</p>

<p>Corrie and the doctor forced him back gently. Jerry opened his
eyes and looked at Corrie. He smiled and said, "Mabel." After that
he lay quietly for a while. Rosetti had come up and was walking
beside the litter. He had seen that perhaps Corrie and the doctor
might need help. His eyes reflected worry and fear. Jerry said,
"Lucas to Melrose! Lucas to Melrose!"</p>

<p>Rosetti choked back a sob. Melrose had been the tail gunner who
had been killed&mdash;and Jerry was talking to him! The implication
terrified Rosetti, but he kept his head. "Melrose to Lucas," he
said. "All quiet on de western front, Cap'n."</p>

<p>Jerry relaxed, and said, "Roger."</p>

<p>Corrie patted Rosetti's shoulder. "You're sweet," she said.
Shrimp flushed. "Who is Melrose?" Corrie asked.</p>

<p>"Our tail gunner. He was killed before the Lovely Lady crashed.
An' he was talkin' to him! Geeze!"</p>

<p>Jerry turned and twisted. It was all that three of them could do
to keep him on the litter. "I guess we'll have to tie him down,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>Rosetti shook his head. "Get Bubonovitch up here, an' me and
him'll take care of him. The Cap'n wouldn't want to be tied
down."</p>

<p>Word was passed back down the column for Bubonovitch. Jerry was
trying to get off the litter when he arrived. It took the combined
strength of four to force him back. Bubonovitch was swearing softly
under his breath. "The goddam Japs. The yellow bastards." He turned
on Rosetti. "Why in hell didn't you send for me before?" he
demanded. "Why didn't somebody tell me he was like this?"</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on, Bum," said Rosetti. "I sends for you as
soon as he needs you."</p>

<p>"He hasn't been this way long," Corrie told Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the latter. "I was frightened when I saw him
this way. You see, we're sort of fond of the guy."</p>

<p>Tears almost came to Corrie's eyes. "I guess we all are," she
said.</p>

<p>"Is he very bad, Doctor?" asked Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"He is running quite a fever," replied Reyd; "but it isn't high
enough to be dangerous&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>They had come out of the forest into the valley where they were
to camp. Now, out of the narrow trail, Sarina had come up beside
the litter. When Jerry yelled, "Cripes! I can't get her nose up.
You fellows jump! Make it snappy!" and tried to jump off the
litter, she helped hold him down.</p>

<p>Corrie stroked his forehead and said, soothingly, "Everything's
all right, Jerry. Just lie still and try to rest."</p>

<p>He reached up and took her hand. "Mabel," he said and sighed.
Then he fell asleep. Rosetti and Bubonovitch tried not to look at
Corrie.</p>

<p>Reyd sighed, too. "That's the best medicine he could have," he
said.</p>

<p>A half hour later, van Prins called a halt; and they made camp
beneath some trees beside the little stream that ran through the
valley.</p>

<p>Jerry slept through the remainder of the afternoon and all the
following night. Corrie and Sarina slept on one side of the litter,
Bubonovitch and Rosetti on the other. They took turns remaining
awake to watch over their patient.</p>

<p>When it was Corrie's turn to remain awake, she kept thinking of
Mabel. She had never heard the name of that girl in Oklahoma City
who had married the 4-F, but she knew now that her name was Mabel.
So he still loved her! Corrie tried not to care. Wasn't Mabel lost
to him? She was married. Then she thought that maybe it was some
other girl named Mabel, and maybe this other girl wasn't married.
She wanted to ask Bubonovitch what the name of the girl in Oklahoma
City was, but her pride wouldn't let her.</p>

<p>When Jerry awoke he lay for several seconds looking up at the
leafy canopy above him, trying to coax his memory to reveal its
secrets. Slowly he recalled that the last thing he had been
conscious of was being very uncomfortable on a litter that was
being borne along a narrow forest trail. Now the litter had come to
rest and he was very comfortable. Quite near him he heard the
purling laughter of the little river rippling among the boulders as
it hurried gaily on to keep its assignation with the sea.</p>

<p>Jerry looked toward it and saw Bubonovitch and Rosetti kneeling
on its grassy bank washing their hands and faces. He smiled happily
as he thought how fortunate he had been in the comrades the war had
given him. He fought away the sadness for those he would never see
again. A fellow mustn't brood about things like that, those
inescapable concomitants of war.</p>

<p>Turning his head away from the river, he looked for Corrie. She
was sitting close beside his litter, cross-legged, elbows on knees,
her face buried in her opened palms. Her hair was gold again; but
she still wore it bobbed, being, as she was, a very practical
little person. That, too, was why she continued to wear pants.</p>

<p>Jerry looked at her fondly, thinking what a cute boy she looked.
And also thinking, thank God she's not. He knew she wasn't; because
he wouldn't have wanted to take a boy in his arms and kiss him. And
that was exactly what he wanted to do with Corrie that very moment,
but he didn't have the nerve. Coward! he thought.</p>

<p>"Corrie," he said, very softly. She opened her eyes and raised
her head. "Oh, Jerry!"</p>

<p>He reached over and took one of her hands. She placed her other
hand on his forehead. "Oh, Jerry! Jerry! Your fever is all gone.
How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"As though I could eat a cow, hoofs, horns, and hide."</p>

<p>Corrie choked back a sob. This sudden relief from fear and
strain broke down the barriers of emotional restraint that had been
her spiritual shield and buckler for so long. Corrie scrambled to
her feet and ran away. She took refuge behind a tree and leaned
against it and cried. She couldn't recall when she had been so
happy.</p>

<p>"Wot," Rosetti asked Bubonovitch, "was de name of dat dame in
Oklahoma City wot gave de Cap'n de brush-off?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"I wonder was it Mabel," wondered Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Could be."</p>

<p>Jerry looked after Corrie, with knitted brows. Now what the
hell? he thought. Sarina, having attached herself to Corrie and the
Americans, was preparing their breakfast nearby. Dr. Reyd, making
the round of his patients, came to Jerry. "How goes it this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Feeling great," Jerry told him. "Won't have to be carried any
longer."</p>

<p>"Maybe that's what you think," said Reyd, grinning. "But you're
wrong."</p>

<p>Captain van Prins and Tak van der Bos came over. "Think you can
stand another day of it?" the former asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Sure I can."</p>

<p>"Good! I want to start as soon as possible. This place is too
exposed."</p>

<p>"You had us worrying yesterday, Jerry," said van der Bos.</p>

<p>"I had a good doctor," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"If I'd had you back in civilian life," said Reyd, "I'd have
given you a pill yesterday; and this morning I'd have told you how
near death's door you were yesterday."</p>

<p>Corrie came out from behind her tree and joined them. Jerry saw
that her eyes were red, and knew why she had run away. "Just
getting up, lazy?" Tak asked her.</p>

<p>"I've been out looking for a cow," said Corrie.</p>

<p>"A cow! Why?"</p>

<p>"Jerry wanted one for breakfast."</p>

<p>"So he'll eat rice," said van Prins, grinning.</p>

<p>"When I get off your lovely island," said Jerry, "and anyone
says rice to me, he'd better smile."</p>

<p>The others went on about their duties, leaving Corrie alone with
Jerry. "I must have passed out cold yesterday," he said. "Can't
remember a thing after about a couple of hours on the trail."</p>

<p>"You were a very sick man&mdash;just burning up with fever. You
kept trying to jump off the litter. It took four of us to hold you
down. The doctor wanted to tie you to the litter, but that sweet
little sergeant wouldn't hear of it. He said, 'De Cap'n wouldn't
want to be tied down'; so he and Bubonovitch and the doctor and
Sarina and I walked beside the litter."</p>

<p>"Shrimp's a good little guy," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Those boys are very fond of you, Jerry."</p>

<p>"That works both ways," said Jerry. "Members of a combat crew
have to like one another. You don't trust a guy you don't like, and
we got enough worries when we're flying a mission without having to
worry about some fellow we can't trust. I'm sorry I was such a
nuisance yesterday."</p>

<p>"You weren't a nuisance. We were just frightened, because we
thought you were so terribly sick. And your being delirious made it
seem much worse than it really was." She paused a moment, and then
she said, "Who is Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Mabel? What do you know about Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. But you kept asking for her."</p>

<p>Jerry laughed. "That's what Dad called Mother. It isn't her
name, but he started calling her Mabel even before they were
married. He got the name from a series of 'Dear Mabel' letters that
were popular during World War I; and we kids thought it was funny
to call her Mabel, too."</p>

<p>"We were all wondering who Mabel was," said Corrie, lamely.</p>

<p>"I suppose it had Shrimp and Bubonovitch and Sarina and the
doctor terribly worried," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"That is not funny, and you are not nice," said Corrie.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT the head of the valley, where the stream was
born in a little spring that gurgled from beneath a limestone
cliff, there were many caves, easily defendable. Here van Prins
decided to make a more or less permanent camp and await the coming
of Allied forces under MacArthur, for since the Americans had come
he had learned for the first time that MacArthur was really drawing
nearer week by week. When the Allies established a beachhead, he
and other guerrilla leaders would come down out of the mountains
and harass the enemy's rear and communications. In the meantime
about all that they could accomplish was an occasional sally
against a Jap outpost.</p>

<p>From this camp the Americans planned to cross over to the other
side of the mountains, as soon as Jerry was fully recovered, and
follow a trail along the eastern side of the range to the point
where they would recross to the west and try to make their way to
the coast. Tak van der Bos was going with them, because it was
thought that his knowledge of Sumatra and the location of Jap
positions might prove of value to the Allied forces. "In the very
doubtful eventuality that you ever reach them," said van Prins.</p>

<p>He had little hope for the success of what he considered a mad
venture, and he tried to persuade Corrie not to take the risk. "We
can hide you here in the mountains indefinitely," he told her, "and
you will be safe among your own people."</p>

<p>Jerry wasn't so sure that she would be safe. If the Japs ever
made a serious effort to liquidate the guerrillas, using both
infantry and planes, Corrie would be anything but safe. Yet he did
not urge her to come with him. He would have felt much more assured
of the chances for the success of their venture if Tarzan had not
been lost to them.</p>

<p>Tak van der Bos agreed with van Prins. "I really think you'd be
safer here, Corrie," he told her. "And I think that we four men
would stand a better chance of getting away if&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you weren't burdened with a couple of women. Why don't you
say it, Tak?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know just how to say it inoffensively, Corrie; but
that's what I meant."</p>

<p>"Sarina and I will not be a burden. We'll be two more rifles. We
have proved that we can hold our own on the trail with any of you
men. I think you will admit that Sarina would prove an even more
ferocious fighter than any of you, and I have already shown that I
won't scream and faint when the shooting starts. Besides all that,
Sarina believes that she knows exactly where she can locate a boat
for us and get it provisioned by friendly natives. And another
thing to consider: Sarina has sailed these seas all her life. She
not only knows them, but she is an experienced navigator. I think
that we can be a lot of help to you. As far as the danger is
concerned, it's six of one and half a dozen of the other. The Japs
may get us if we try to get away, or they may get us if we stay.
Sarina and I want to go with you men; but if Jerry says no, that
will settle it."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti were interested listeners to the
discussion. Jerry turned to them. "What do you fellows think?" he
asked. "Would you want Corrie and Sarina to come with us, or would
you rather they didn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this," said Bubonovitch. "If we had two men who
were as good soldiers as they are, there wouldn't be any question.
It's just that a man hesitates to place a woman in danger if he can
avoid it."</p>

<p>"That's the hell of it," said Jerry. He looked at Rosetti,
questioningly, Rosetti the confirmed woman hater.</p>

<p>"I say let's all go, or all stay. Let's stick togedder."</p>

<p>"Corrie and Sarina know what dangers and hardships may be
involved," said Bubonovitch. "Let them decide. I can't see that any
of us has any right to do their thinking for them."</p>

<p>"Good for you, sergeant," said Corrie. "Sarina and I have
already decided."</p>

<p>Captain van Prins shrugged. "I think you are crazy," he said;
"but I admire your courage, and I wish you luck."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Rosetti, pointing. "Everyt'ing's goin' to be
hotsy-totsy now."</p>

<p>Everyone looked in the direction that Rosetti was pointing.
Coming toward them was the familiar, bronzed figure that the
Americans and Corrie had so grown to lean upon; and upon one of its
shoulders squatted a little monkey; across the other was the
carcass of a deer.</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped the deer at the edge of camp and walked toward
the group gathered around Jerry's litter. Keta encircled Tarzan's
neck with both arms, screaming at the strange tarmangani, hurling
jungle invective at them. Little Keta was terrified.</p>

<p>"They are friends, Keta," said Tarzan in their common language.
"Do not be afraid."</p>

<p>"Keta not afraid," shrilled the monkey. "Keta bite
tarmangani."</p>

<p>Tarzan was welcomed with enthusiasm. He went at once to Jerry
and stood looking down at him, smiling. "So they didn't get you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Just nicked me," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw you, I thought you were dead."</p>

<p>"We have been afraid that you were dead. Did you get into some
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tarzan, "but it wasn't my trouble; it was the
Japs'. I followed them. No matter what they may do to you in the
future, you are already avenged."</p>

<p>Jerry grinned. "I wish I had been there to see."</p>

<p>"It was not pretty," said Tarzan: "Soulless creatures in a panic
of terror&mdash;living robots helpless without their masters. I was
careful to pick those off first." He smiled at the
recollection.</p>

<p>"You must have followed them a long way," suggested van
Prins.</p>

<p>"No, but after I finished with them I wandered deep into the
forest. I am always curious about a country with which I am not
familiar. However, I did not learn much of value. Late yesterday
afternoon I located an enemy battery of big guns, and this morning,
another. If you have a map, I can mark their positions fairly
closely.</p>

<p>"The first day, I found an isolated village of natives. It was
built in the shallow waters near the shore of a lake in a great
primeval forest which appeared to me impenetrable. The people were
fishing with nets. They threatened me with bows and arrows after I
gave them the peace sign."</p>

<p>"I think I know the village," said van Prins. "Fliers have seen
it; but as far as is known, no other civilized men have seen it and
lived. One or two have tried to reach it. Maybe they did, but they
never came back. The inhabitants of that village are thought to be
the remnants of an aboriginal people from whom the Battaks
descended&mdash;true savages and cannibals. Until recently the
modern Battaks were cannibals&mdash;what one might call beneficent
cannibals. They ate their old people in the belief that thus they
would confer immortality upon them, for they would continue to live
in the persons of those who devoured them. Also, the devourer would
acquire the strengths and virtues of the devoured. For this latter
reason, they also ate their enemies&mdash;partly cooked and with a
dash of lemon."</p>

<p>"These lake dwellers," said van der Bos, "are also supposed to
have discovered the secret of perpetual youth."</p>

<p>"That, of course, is all tommy-rot," said Dr. Reyd.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>Reyd looked at him in surprise. "You don't mean to tell me that
you believe any such silly nonsense as that, do you?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled and nodded. "Naturally, I believe in those things
which I have myself seen or experienced; and I have twice seen
absolute proof that perpetual youth can be achieved. Also, I
learned long ago not to deny the possibility of anything emanating
from the superstitions of religions of primitive peoples. I have
seen strange things in the depths of Darkest Africa." He ceased
speaking, evidently having no intention to elaborate. His eyes,
wandering over the faces of his listeners, fixed on Sarina. "What
is that woman doing here?" he asked. "She belongs to Hooft and his
gang of outlaws."</p>

<p>Corrie and Rosetti both tried to explain simultaneously, the
latter fairly leaping to Sarina's defense. When he had heard the
story, Tarzan was satisfied. "If Sergeant Rosetti is satisfied to
have any woman around, she must be beyond criticism."</p>

<p>Rosetti flushed uncomfortably, but he said, "Sarina's okay,
Colonel."</p>

<p>Dr. Reyd cleared his throat. "What you said about the verity of
the superstitions and religions of primitive peoples and that
perpetual youth might be achieved, interests me. Would you mind
being more explicit?"</p>

<p>Tarzan sat down cross-legged beside Jerry. "On numerous
occasions, I have known witch doctors to kill people at great
distances from them, and some times after a lapse of years. I do
not know how they do it. I merely know that they do do it. Perhaps
they plant the idea in the mind of their victim and he induces
death by autosuggestion. Most of their mumbo-jumbo is pure
charlatanism. Occasionally it appears as an exact science."</p>

<p>"We are easily fooled, though," said Jerry. 'Take some of these
fellows who have made a hobby of so-called parlor magic. They admit
that they are tricking you; but if you were an ignorant savage and
they told you it was true magic, you'd believe them. I had a friend
in Honolulu when I was stationed at Hickam, who was as good as any
professional I have ever seen. Paint Colonel Kendall J. Fielder
black, dress him up in a breech-clout and a feather headdress, give
him some odds and ends of bones and pieces of wood and a zebra's
tail, and turn him loose in Africa; and he'd have all the other
witch doctors green with envy.</p>

<p>"And what he could do with cards! I used to play bridge against
him, and he always won. Of course his game was on the level, but he
had two strikes on you before you started&mdash;just like Tarzan's
witch doctors had on their victims. You just autosuggested yourself
to defeat. It was humiliating, too," added Jerry, "because I am a
very much better bridge player than he."</p>

<p>"Of course anyone can learn that kind of magic," said Reyd, "but
how about perpetual youth? You have really seen instances of this,
Colonel?"</p>

<p>"When I was a young man," said Tarzan, "I saved a black from a
man-eating lion. He was very grateful, and wished to repay me in
some way. He offered me perpetual youth. I told him that I didn't
think such a thing was possible. He asked me how old I thought he
was, and I said that he appeared to be in his twenties. He told me
that he was a witch doctor. All the witch doctors I had ever seen
were much older men than he; so I rather discounted that statement
as well as his claim to being able to confer perpetual youth on
me.</p>

<p>"He took me to his village, where I met his chief. He asked the
chief how long he had known him. 'All my life,' replied the chief,
who was a very old man. The chief told me that no one knew how old
the witch doctor was; but that he must be very old, as he had known
Tippoo Tib's grandfather. Tippoo Tib was born, probably, in the
1840's, or, possibly, the 1830's; so his grandfather may have been
born as long ago as the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>"I was quite young and, like most young men, adventurous. I
would try anything; so I let the witch doctor go to work on me.
Before he was through with me, I understood why he was not
conferring perpetual youth wholesale. It required a full month of
concocting vile brews, observing solemn rituals, and the
transfusion of a couple of quarts of the witch doctor's blood into
my veins. Long before it was over, I regretted that I had let
myself in for it; because I didn't take any stock in his claims."
Tarzan ceased speaking as though he had finished his story.</p>

<p>"And you were quite right," said Dr. Reyd.</p>

<p>"You think I will age, then?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"How old do you think I am now?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"In your twenties."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "That which I have told you of occurred many
years ago."</p>

<p>Dr. Reyd shook his head. "It is very strange," he said. It was
evident that he was not convinced.</p>

<p>"I never gave a thought to your age, Colonel," said Jerry; "but
I remember now that my father said that he read about you when he
was a boy. And I was brought up on you. You influenced my life more
than anyone else."</p>

<p>"I give up," said Dr. Reyd. "But you said that you had known of
two instances in which perpetual youth was achieved. What was the
other one. You've certainly aroused my interest."</p>

<p>"A tribe of white fanatics in a remote part of Africa compounded
a hellish thing that achieved perpetual youth. I mean the way that
they obtained one of the principal ingredients was hellish. They
kidnaped young girls, killed them, and removed certain glands.</p>

<p>"In the course of tracing a couple of girls they had stolen, I
found their village. To make a long story short, my companions and
I succeeded in rescuing the girls and obtaining a supply of their
compound.* Those who have taken it, including a little monkey, have
shown no signs of aging since."</p>

<p>[* See Tarzan's Quest]</p>

<p>"Amazing!" said Dr. Reyd. "Do you expect to live forever?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to expect."</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Bubonovitch, "you'll just fall to pieces all
at once, like the One Hoss Shay."</p>

<p>"Would you want to live forever?" asked van der Bos.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;if I never had to suffer the infirmities of old
age."</p>

<p>"But all your friends would be gone."</p>

<p>"One misses the old friends, but one constantly makes new ones.
But really my chances of living forever are very slight. Any day, I
may stop a bullet; or a tiger may get me, or a python. If I live to
get back to my Africa, I may find a lion waiting for me, or a
buffalo. Death has many tricks up his sleeve beside old age. One
may outplay him for a while, but he always wins in the end."</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE little band that was to make the attempt to
reach Australia, comprising, as it did, Americans, Dutch, an
Englishman, and an Eurasian, had been dubbed The Foreign Legion by
the guerrillas. Jerry amplified the basis for this designation by
calling attention to the fact that Bubonovitch was Russian, Rosetti
Italian, and he himself part Cherokee Indian.</p>

<p>"If poor old Sing Tai were with us," said Corrie, "the four
principal Allied Nations would be represented."</p>

<p>"If Italy hadn't surrendered," said Bubonovitch, "we'd have had
to liquidate Shrimp. He's the only Axis partner in our midst."</p>

<p>"I ain't a Eye-talian," said Rosetti, "but I'd rather be a
Eye-talian than a lousy Russian Communist." Bubonovitch grinned,
and winked at Corrie.</p>

<p>Captain van Prins, who was sitting a little apart with Tarzan,
said in a low tone, "It's too bad that there's hard feelings
between those two. It may cause a lot of trouble before you're
through."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at him in surprise. "I guess you don't know
Americans very well, Captain. Either one of those boys would
willingly risk his life for the other."</p>

<p>"Then why do they try to insult each other?" demanded van Prins.
"This is not the first time I have heard them."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "If I were an American, perhaps I could tell
you."</p>

<p>Where the guerrillas had made their camp, the valley narrowed
and ended in a box canyon the limestone walls of which were pitted
with several large caves on each side. Rifles and machine guns
firing from the mouths of these caves could develop a deadly
cross-fire that might render the position impregnable. Another
advantage lay in the ability to conceal all evidence of the
presence of men which the caves offered. Occasionally, a Jap plane
flew over. At the first sound of its motors, the company vanished
into the caves.</p>

<p>A sentry, posted on a cliff above the camp, had a full view down
the valley as far as binoculars would reach. Should he discover
even a single human being approaching, his signal would similarly
empty the floor of the canyon.</p>

<p>In this camp, for the first time, The Foreign Legion felt
reasonably secure. It was a relief from the constant nervous strain
they had been undergoing, and they relaxed and rested while waiting
for Jerry's wound to heal and for him to regain his strength.</p>

<p>Tarzan was often away on reconnaissance missions or hunting. It
was he who kept the camp supplied with fresh meat, as he could kill
quietly, which was most desirable. A rifle shot might attract the
attention of an enemy patrol.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Tarzan was away for several days at a time. On one
such mission he found the camp of the outlaws far down the valley.
It was located not far from the kampong where Captain Tokujo Matsuo
and Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe still held forth, and it was evident
that the outlaws were openly collaborating with the Japs.</p>

<p>The outlaws had set up a still and were making schnapps, with
which they carried on a brisk trade with the enemy. Tarzan saw much
drunkenness in both camps. One observable result of this was a
relaxation of discipline and alertness in the enemy camp. There
were no sentries out on the trails leading to the village. A single
soldier was on guard beside a small barbed wire enclosure. Inside
this, beneath a flimsy shelter, Tarzan could see two figures, but
he could not make out who nor what they were. They were evidently
prisoners, but whether natives or Japs he could not tell. They did
not interest him.</p>

<p>As Tarzan turned to leave the village and return to the camp of
the guerrillas, a radio blared from one of the houses. He paused a
moment to listen; but the voice spoke in Japanese, which he could
not understand, and he continued on his way.</p>

<p>However, Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe understood it, and he did not
like what he heard. Captain Tokujo Matsuo understood it and was
pleased. He was not a little drunk on schnapps, as was Sokabe also.
The schnapps heightened the acclaim with which Matsuo received the
broadcast from Tokyo. He was quite noisy about it.</p>

<p>"So your honorable uncle has been kicked out," he exulted. "You
may now write to your honorable uncle, General Hideki Tojo, every
day; but I shall remain a captain&mdash;until I am promoted. Now
the situation is reversed. The 'Singing Frog' is now Premier. He is
not my uncle, but he is my friend. I served under him in the
Kwantung army in Manchuria."</p>

<p>"So did a million other peasants," said Sokabe.</p>

<p>Thus was the bad blood between the two officers made worse,
which was not well for the morale and discipline of their
command.</p>

<p>Corrie had often expressed concern over the fate of Sing Tai
whom they had left in hiding in the village of Tiang Umar; so
Tarzan decided to visit this village before returning to the camp
of the guerrillas. This necessitated a considerable detour, but
only rarely did either time or distance cause the Lord of the
Jungle any concern. One of the features of civilization to which he
could never accustom himself was the slavish subservience of
civilized man to the demands of time. Sometimes his lack of
conformity with established custom proved embarrassing to others,
but never to Tarzan. He ate when he was hungry, slept when he was
sleepy. He started on journeys when the spirit or necessity moved
him, without concerning himself about the time which might be
involved.</p>

<p>He moved leisurely now. He made a kill, and after eating, laid
up for the night. It was midmorning when he approached the kampong
of Tiang Umar. Motivated by the inherent caution and suspicion of
the wild beast, Tarzan moved silently through the trees which
encircled the kampong, to assure himself that no enemy lurked
there. He saw the natives carrying on their normal, peaceful
activities. Presently he recognized Alam, and a moment later he
dropped to the ground and walked into the village.</p>

<p>As soon as the natives recognized him, they greeted him
cordially and gathered around him, asking questions in a language
he could not understand. He asked if anyone in the village spoke
Dutch; and an old man replied in that language, saying that he
did.</p>

<p>Through the interpreter Alam inquired about Corrie, and showed
his pleasure when told that she was safe. Then Tarzan asked what
had become of Sing Tai, and was told that he was still in the
village but never ventured out in the daytime, which was well, as
twice Jap scouting parties had come to the kampong without
warning.</p>

<p>Tarzan was taken to the Chinese. He found him entirely recovered
from his wound and in good physical condition. His first question
was of Corrie, and when he was assured that she was all right and
among friends he beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Do you want to stay here, Sing Tai," Tarzan asked, "or do you
want to come with us? We are going to try to escape from the
island."</p>

<p>"I come with you," replied Sing Tai.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tarzan. "We'll start now."</p>

<p><br><br>The Foreign Legion was becoming restless. Jerry had entirely
recovered, had regained his strength, and was anxious to move on.
He only awaited the return of Tarzan, who had been away for several
days.</p>

<p>"Wish he would show up," he said to Corrie. "I know he can take
care of himself, but something could happen to him." Several of the
party were gathered beneath the concealing branches of a tree. They
had been stripping, oiling, and reassembling their weapons. The
stripping and reassembling they did with their eyes closed. It was
a game that relieved the monotony of this ceaseless attention to
weapons in the humid atmosphere of these equatorial mountains.
Occasionally they timed one another; and, much to the chagrin of
the men, it was discovered that Corrie and Sarina were the most
adept.</p>

<p>Sarina replaced the bolt in her rifle, aimed at the sky, and
squeezed the trigger. She leaned the piece against the tree, and
looked long and searchingly down the valley. "Tony has been gone a
long time," she said. "If he does not come soon, I shall go and
look for him."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Hunting."</p>

<p>"The orders are no hunting," said Jerry. "Rosetti knows that. We
can't take the chance of attracting the attention of the Japs with
rifle fire."</p>

<p>"Tony took his bow and arrows for hunting," Sarina explained.
"He will not fire his rifle except in self-defence."</p>

<p>"He couldn't hit anything smaller than an elephant with that
archery set of his," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"How long has he been gone?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Too long," said Sarina; "three or four hours at least."</p>

<p>"I'll go look for him," said Bubonovitch. He picked up his rifle
and stood up.</p>

<p>Just then the sentry on the cliff called down: "A man coming.
Looks like Sergeant Rosetti. Yes, it is Sergeant Rosetti."</p>

<p>"Is he carrying an elephant?" Bubonovitch shouted.</p>

<p>The sentry laughed. "He is carrying something, but I do not
think it is an elephant."</p>

<p>They all looked down the valley, and presently they could see a
man approaching. He was still a long way off. Only the sentry with
binoculars could have recognized him. After a while Rosetti walked
into camp. He was carrying a hare.</p>

<p>"Here's your supper," he said, tossing the hare to the ground.
"I missed three deer, and then I gets this little squirt."</p>

<p>"Was he asleep at the time, or did somebody hold him for you?"
asked Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"He was runnin' like a bat outta hell," said Rosetti, grinning.
"He runs into a tree an' knocks hisself cold."</p>

<p>"Nice work, Hiawatha," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I tried," said Rosetti. "I didn't sit around on my big,
fat fanny waitin' for some udder guy to bring home de bacon."</p>

<p>"That is right, Sergeant Bum," said Sarina.</p>

<p>"Always the perfect little gentleman, I will not contradict a
lady," said Bubonovitch. "Now the question is, who is going to
prepare the feast? There are only fifty of us to eat it. What is
left, we can send to the starving Armenians."</p>

<p>"De starvin' Armenians don't get none of dis rabbit. Neither do
you. It's all for Sarina and Corrie."</p>

<p>"Two people coming up the valley!" called down the sentry.
"Can't make them out yet. Something peculiar about them." Every eye
was strained down the valley, every ear waiting to hear the next
report from the sentry. After a few moments it came: "Each of them
is carrying some sort of load. One of them is naked."</p>

<p>"Must be Tarzan," said Jerry.</p>

<p>It was Tarzan. With him was Sing Tai. When they reached camp,
each of them dropped the carcass of a deer to the ground. Corrie
was delighted to see Sing Tai and to learn that he had completely
recovered from his wound. And Jerry was relieved and delighted to
see Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I'm sure glad you're back," he said. "We're all ready to shove
off, and have only been waiting for you."</p>

<p>"I think we have another job to do before we can start," said
Tarzan. "I located Hooft's gang far down the valley, not far from
the village where we got Corrie away from the Japs. The Japs are
still there, and while I was scouting the place I saw two prisoners
behind barbed wire. I couldn't make out what they were, but on the
way back here from Tiang Umar's kampong Sing Tai told me that some
Japs had passed through the kampong a few days ago with two
American prisoners. The Japs told the natives that they were fliers
whose plane had been shot down some time ago."</p>

<p>"Douglas and Davis!" exclaimed Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Must be," agreed Jerry. "They are the only two unaccounted
for."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch buckled on his ammunition belt and picked up his
rifle. "Let's go, Captain," he said.</p>

<p>Tarzan glanced at the sun. "If we travel fast," he said, "we can
make it while it is still dark; but we should take only men who can
travel fast."</p>

<p>"How many?" asked van Prins.</p>

<p>"Twenty should be enough. If everything goes all right, I can do
it alone. If everything doesn't go all right, twenty men plus the
element of surprise should make everything all right."</p>

<p>"I'll come along with enough of my men to make the twenty," said
van Prins.</p>

<p>All the members of The Foreign Legion were preparing to go, but
Tarzan said no to Corrie and Sarina. They started to argue the
matter, but Tarzan was adamant. "You'd be an added responsibility
for us," he said. "We'd have to be thinking of your safety when our
minds should be on nothing but our mission."</p>

<p>"The Colonel is right," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"I suppose he is," admitted Corrie.</p>

<p>"That's the good soldier," said Tak.</p>

<p>"There is another who should not go," said Doctor Reyd.
Everybody looked at Jerry. "Captain Lucas has been a very ill man.
If he goes on a long forced march now, he'll be in no condition to
undertake the trying marches to the south which you are
contemplating."</p>

<p>Jerry glanced questioningly at Tarzan. "I wish you wouldn't
insist, Jerry," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>Jerry unbuckled his ammunition belt and laid it at the foot of
the tree. He grinned ruefully. "If Corrie and Sarina can be good
soldiers, I guess I can, too; but I sure hate to miss out on
this."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later twenty men started down the valley at a brisk
pace that was almost a dogtrot. Tarzan, at the head of the column
with van Prins, explained his plan to the Dutchman.</p>

<p><br><br>Captain Tokujo Matsuo and Lieutenant Hideo Sokabe had been
drinking all night&mdash;drinking and quarreling. There had been
much drinking among their men, too. The native men of the kampong
had taken their women into the forest to escape the brutal advances
of the drunken soldiers. But now, shortly before dawn, the camp had
quieted, except for the quarreling of the two officers; for the
others lay for the most part in a drunken stupor.</p>

<p>The single guard before the prison pen had just come on duty. He
had slept off some of the effects of the schnapps he had drunk, but
he was still far from sober. He resented having been awakened; so
he vented some of his anger on the two prisoners, awakening them to
revile and threaten them. Having been born and educated in
Honolulu, he spoke English. He was an adept in invective in two
languages. He loosed a flow of profanity and obscenity upon the two
men within the barbed wire enclosure.</p>

<p>Staff Sergeant Carter Douglas of Van Nuys, California, stirred
on his filthy sleeping mat, and raised himself on one elbow.
"Aloha, sweetheart!" he called to the guard. This plunged the Jap
into inarticulate rage.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' the guy?" demanded Staff Sergeant Bill Davis of
Waco, Texas.</p>

<p>"I think he doesn't like us," said Douglas. "Before you woke up
he said he would kill us right now except that his honorable
captain wanted to lop our beans off himself in the morning."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's just handin' us a line to scare us," suggested
Davis.</p>

<p>"Could be," said Douglas. "The guy's spifflicated. That stuff
they drink must be potent as hell. It sounded like everybody in
camp was drunk."</p>

<p>"Remember that butterfly brandy they tried to sell us in Noumea
at eighty-five smackers a bottle? Three drinks, and a private would
spit in a captain's face. Maybe that's what they're drinking."</p>

<p>"If this guy had got a little drunker," said Douglas, "we could
have made our get-away tonight."</p>

<p>"If we could get out of here, we could rush him."</p>

<p>"But we can't get out of here."</p>

<p>"Hell's bells! I don't want to have my head lopped off. What a
hell of a birthday present."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, birthday present?"</p>

<p>"If I haven't lost track, tomorrow should be my birthday," said
Davis. "I'll be twenty-five tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You didn't expect to live forever, did you? I don't know what
you old guys expect."</p>

<p>"How old are you, Doug?"</p>

<p>"Twenty."</p>

<p>"Gawd! They dragged you right out of the cradle. Oh, hell!" he
said after a moment's pause. "We're just tryin' to kid ourselves
that we ain't scared. I'm good and goddam scared."</p>

<p>"I'm scairt as hell," admitted Davis.</p>

<p>"What you talk about in there?" demanded the guard. "Shut
up!"</p>

<p>"Shut up yourself, Tojo," said Douglas; "you're drunk."</p>

<p>"Now, for that, I kill you," yelled the Jap. "I tell the captain
you try to escape." He raised his rifle and aimed into the darkness
of the shelter that housed the two prisoners.</p>

<p>Silently, in the shadows of the native houses, a figure moved
toward him. It approached from behind him.</p>

<p>Matsuo and Sokabe were screaming insults at one another in their
quarters at the far end of the kampong. Suddenly, the former drew
his pistol and fired at Sokabe. He missed, and the lieutenant
returned the fire. They were too drunk to hit one another except by
accident, but they kept blazing away.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with Matsuo's first shot, the guard fired
into the shelter that housed the two Americans. Before he could
fire a second shot, an arm encircled his head and drew it back, and
a knife almost severed it from his body.</p>

<p>"Were you hit, Bill?" ask Douglas.</p>

<p>"No. He missed us a mile. What's going on out there? Somebody
jumped him."</p>

<p>Aroused by the firing in their officers' quarters, dopey,
drunken soldiers were staggering toward the far end of the village,
thinking the camp had been attacked. Some of them ran so close past
Tarzan that he could almost have reached out and touched them. He
crouched beside the dead guard, waiting. He was as ignorant of the
cause of the fusillade as the Japs. Van Prins and his party were at
the opposite end of the kampong; so he knew that it could not be
them firing.</p>

<p>When he thought the last Jap had passed him, he called to the
prisoners in a low tone. "Are you Douglas and Davis?"</p>

<p>"We sure are."</p>

<p>"Where's the gate?"</p>

<p>"Right in front of you, but it's padlocked."<p>

<p>Van Prins, hearing the firing, thought that it was directed
at Tarzan; so he brought his men into the village at a run.
They spread out, dodging from house to house.</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped to the gate. Its posts were the trunks of small
saplings. Douglas and Davis had come from the shelter and were
standing close inside the gate.</p>

<p>Tarzan took hold of the posts, one with each hand. "Each of you
fellows push on a post," he said, "and I'll pull." As he spoke, he
surged back with all his weight and strength; and the posts snapped
off before the prisoners could lend a hand. The wire was pulled
down to the ground with the posts, and Douglas and Davis walked out
to freedom over it.</p>

<p>Tarzan had heard the men coming in from van Prins's position,
and guessed it was they. He called to van Prins, and the latter
answered. "The prisoners are with me," said Tarzan. "You'd better
assemble your men so that we can get out of here." Then he took the
rifle and ammunition from the dead Jap and handed them to
Davis.</p>

<p>As the party moved out of the village, they could hear the Japs
jabbering and shouting at the far end. They did not know the cause
of the diversion that had aided them so materially in the rescue of
the two men without having suffered any casualties, and many of
them regretted leaving without having fired a shot.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Rosetti fairly swarmed over their two buddies,
asking and answering innumerable questions. One of Davis's first
questions was about Tarzan. "Who was that naked guy that got us
out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the English dook that come aboard just
before we shoved off?" asked Rosetti. "Well, that's him; and he's
one swell guy. An' who do you t'ink he is?"</p>

<p>"You just told us&mdash;the RAF colonel."</p>

<p>"He's Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>"Who you think you're kiddin'?"</p>

<p>"On the level," said Bubonovitch. "He's Tarzan all right."</p>

<p>"The old man ain't here," said Douglas. "He wasn't&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No. He's O.K. He got wounded, and they wouldn't let him come
along; but he's all right."</p>

<p>The four talked almost constantly all the way back to the
guerrilla camp. They had fought together on many missions. They
were linked by ties more binding than blood. There existed between
them something that cannot be expressed in words, nor would they
have thought of trying to. Perhaps Rosetti came nearest it when he
slapped Davis on the back and said, "You old sonofabitch!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TWO days later, The Foreign Legion, now numbering
ten, said goodbye to the guerrillas and started on their long march
toward a hazy destination. Douglas and Davis took their places in
the little company with the easy adaptability of the American
soldier. Douglas called it the League of Nations.</p>

<p>At first the two newcomers had been skeptical of the ability of
the two women to endure the hardships and the dangers of the almost
trackless mountain wilderness that the necessity of avoiding
contact with the enemy forced them to traverse. But they soon
discovered that they were doing pretty well themselves if they kept
up with Corrie and Sarina. There were other surprises, too.</p>

<p>"What's happened to Shrimp?" Davis asked Bubonovitch. "I thought
he didn't have time for any fem, but he's always hangin' around
that brown gal. Not that I blame him any. She could park her shoes
in my locker any time."</p>

<p>"I fear," said Bubonovitch, "that Staff Sergeant Rosetti has
fallen with a dull and sickening thud. At first he was coy about
it, but now he is absolutely without shame. He drools."</p>

<p>"And the old man," said Davis. "He used to be what you called a
misnogomist."</p>

<p>"That isn't exactly what I called it," said Bubonovitch, "but
you have the general idea. Maybe he used to be, but he isn't any
more."</p>

<p>"Sort of silly," remarked Carter Douglas. "What do old men know
about love?"</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised, little one," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>The going was cruel. With parangs, they hacked their way through
virgin jungle. Deep gorges and mountain torrents blocked their
advance with discouraging frequency. Often, the walls of the former
dropped sheer for hundreds of feet, offering no hand nor toe hold,
necessitating long detours. Scarcely a day passed without
rain&mdash;blinding, torrential downpours. They marched and slept
in wet, soggy clothing. Their shoes and sandals rotted.</p>

<p>Tarzan hunted for them, and those who had not already done so
learned to eat their meat raw. He scouted ahead, picking the best
routes, alert for enemy outposts or patrols. By night, they slept
very close together, a guard constantly posted against the sudden,
stealthy attack of tigers. Sometimes muscles sagged, but morale
never.</p>

<p>Little Keta did all the scolding and complaining. When Tarzan
had gone to the rescue of Davis and Douglas, Keta had been left
behind tied to a tree. He had been very indignant about this and
had bitten three Dutchmen who had tried to make friends with him.
Since then he had usually been left severely alone, consorting only
with Tarzan. The only exception was Rosetti. He voluntarily made
friends with the little sergeant, often curling up in his arms when
the company was not on the march.</p>

<p>"He probably recognizes Shrimp as a kindred spirit," said
Bubonovitch, "if not a near relative."</p>

<p>"He t'inks you're one of dem big apes we seen dat he's a-scairt
of."</p>

<p>"You refer, I presume, to Pongo pygmaeus," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Shrimp registered disgust. "I wisht I was a poet. I'd write a
pome."</p>

<p>"About me, darling?"</p>

<p>"You said a mouthful. I got a word wot you rhyme with."</p>

<p>They had stopped for the night earlier than usual because Tarzan
had found a large dry cave that would accommodate them all. It had
probably been occupied many times before, as there were charred
pieces of wood near the entrance and a supply of dry wood stored
within it. They had a fire, and they were sitting close to it,
absorbing its welcome warmth and drying as much of their clothing
as the presence of mixed company permitted them to remove. Which
was considerable, as the silly interdictions of false modesty had
largely been scrapped long since. They were a company of "fighting
men."</p>

<p>Jerry, Bubonovitch, and Rosetti were looking at the rough map
that van Prins had drawn for them. "Here's where we crossed over to
the east side of the range," said Jerry, pointing, "&mdash;just
below Alahanpandjang."</p>

<p>"Geeze, wot a moniker fer a burg! Or is it a burg?"</p>

<p>"It's just a dot on a map to me," admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>"Lookit," continued Rosetti. "Here it says dat to where we cross
back again to de udder side it is 170 kilometers. Wot's dat in
United States?"</p>

<p>"Oh-h, about one hundred and five or six miles. That's in an air
line."</p>

<p>"What do you think we're averaging, Jerry?" asked
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"I doubt if we're making five miles a day in an air line."</p>

<p>"Today," said Bubonovitch, "I doubt that we made five miles on
any kind of a line&mdash;unless it was up and down."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" said Rosetti. "De Lovely Lady would have got us dere in
maybe twenty&mdash;twenty-five minutes. Sloggin' along like dog-faces it
probably take us a mont'."</p>

<p>"Maybe more," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Wotin'ell!" said Rosetti. "We're lucky to be alive."</p>

<p>"And the scenery is magnificent," said Bubonovitch. "When we can
see it through this soup, it looks mighty nice and peaceful down
there."</p>

<p>"It sure does," agreed Rosetti. "It doesn't seem like dere could
be a war in pretty country like dat. I don't suppose dey ever had
no wars here before."</p>

<p>"That's about all they ever did have until within the last
hundred years," said Tak van der Bos. "During all historic times,
and probably during all pre-historic times back to the days of
Pithecanthropus erectus and Homo modjokertensis, all the islands of
the East Indies have been almost constantly overrun by warring
men&mdash;the tribal chiefs, the petty princes, the little kings,
the sultans. The Hindus came from India, the Chinese came, the
Portuguese, the Spaniards from the Philippines, the English, the
Dutch, and now the Japs. They all brought fleets and soldiers and
war. In the thirteenth century, Kubla Khan sent a fleet of a
thousand ships bearing 200,000 soldiers to punish a king of Java
who had arrested the ambassadors of the Great Khan and sent them
back to China with mutilated faces.</p>

<p>"We Dutch were often guilty of perpetrating cruelties and
atrocities upon the Indonesians; but neither we, nor all the others
who came before us, devastated the land and enslaved and massacred
its people with the cruel ruthlessness of their own sultans. These
drunken, rapacious, licentious creatures massacred their own
subjects if it satisfied some capricious whim. They took to
themselves the loveliest women, the fairest virgins. One of them
had fourteen thousand women in his harem."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" exclaimed Rosetti.</p>

<p>Tak grinned and continued. "And if they were still in power,
they would still be doing the same things. Under us Dutch, the
Indonesians have known the first freedom from slavery, the first
peace, the first prosperity that they have ever known. Give them
independence after the Japs are thrown out and in another
generation they'll be back where we found them."</p>

<p>"Haven't all peoples a right to independence?" asked
Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Get a soap box, communist," jeered Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Only those people who have won the right to independence
deserve it," said van der Bos. "The first recorded contact with
Sumatra was during the reign of Wang Mang, a Chinese emperor of the
Han dynasty, just prior to A.D. 23. Indonesian civilization was
ancient then. If, with all that background of ancient culture plus
the nearly two thousand years before the Dutch completed the
conquest of the islands, the people were still held in slavery by
tyrant rulers; then they do not deserve what you call independence.
Under the Dutch they have every liberty. What more can they
ask?"</p>

<p>"Just to keep the record straight," said Bubonovitch, with a
grin, "I'd like to state that I am not a Communist. I am a good
anti-New Deal Republican. But here is my point: I thought that
freedom was one of the things we were fighting for."</p>

<p>"Hell," said Jerry. "I don't think any of us know what we are
fighting for except to kill Japs, get the war over, and get home.
After we have done that, the goddam politicians will mess things
all up again."</p>

<p>"And the saber rattlers will start preparing for World War III,"
said van der Bos.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will rattle their sabers very loudly for a
while," said Corrie.</p>

<p>"Just about in time to catch our children in the next war," said
Jerry.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence. Jerry suddenly realized the
interpretation that might be placed on his innocent remark, and
flushed. So did Corrie. Everybody was looking at them, which made
it worse.</p>

<p>Finally, van der Bos could no longer restrain his laughter; and
they all joined him&mdash;even Corrie and Jerry. Sing Tai, who had
been busy over a cooking fire, further relieved the tension by
repeating a time honored phrase that he had been taught by Rosetti:
"Come and get it!"</p>

<p>Wild pig, grouse, fruits, and nuts formed the menu for the
meal.</p>

<p>"We sure live high," said Davis.</p>

<p>"De Drake Hotel ain't got nuttin' on us," agreed Rosetti.</p>

<p>"We have the choice of an enormous market, and without ration
coupons," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And no coin on de line," said Rosetti. "Geeze! dis is de
life."</p>

<p>"You gone batty?" inquired Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Come back here after the war, sergeant," said van der Bos, "and
I'll show you a very different Sumatra."</p>

<p>Bubonovitch shook his head. "If I ever get back to Brooklyn," he
said, "I'm going to stay there."</p>

<p>"And me for Texas," said Davis.</p>

<p>"Is Texas a nice state?" asked Corrie.</p>

<p>"Finest state in the Union," Davis assured her.</p>

<p>"But Jerry told me that Oklahoma was the finest state."</p>

<p>"That little Indian reservation?" demanded Davis. "Say! Texas is
almost four times as big. She grows more cotton then any other
state in the Union. She's first in cattle, sheep, mules. She's got
the biggest ranch in the world."</p>

<p>"And the biggest liars," said Douglas. "Now if you really want
to know which is the finest state in the Union, I'll tell you. It's
California. You just come to the good old San Fernando Valley after
the war and you'll never want to live anywhere else."</p>

<p>"We haven't heard from New York State," said Jerry,
grinning.</p>

<p>"New Yorkers don't have to boast," said Bubonovitch. "They are
not plagued by any inferiority feeling."</p>

<p>"That's going to be a hard one to top," said van der Bos.</p>

<p>"How about your state, Tony?" asked Sarina.</p>

<p>Rosetti thought for a moment. "Well," he said, "Illinois had
Public Enemy Number One."</p>

<p>"Every American," said Tarzan, "lives in the finest town in the
finest county in the finest state in the finest country in the
world&mdash;and each one of them believes it. And that is what
makes America a great country and is going to keep her so."</p>

<p>"You can say that again," said Davis.</p>

<p>"I have noticed the same thing in your Army," continued the
Englishman. "Every soldier is serving in 'the best damned outfit in
this man's Army,' and he's willing to fight you about it. That
feeling makes for a great Army."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jerry, "we haven't done so bad for a nation of
jitterbugging playboys. I guess we surprised the world."</p>

<p>"You certainly have surprised Hitler and Tojo. If you hadn't
come in, first with materiel and then with men, the war would be
over by now, and Hitler and Tojo would have won it. The World owes
you an enormous debt."</p>

<p>"I wonder if it will pay it," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Probably not," said Tarzan.</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CORRIE was sitting with her back against the wall
of the cave. Jerry came and sat down beside her. Sarina and Rosetti
had wandered out of the cave together, arm in arm.</p>

<p>"Shrimp has become absolutely shameless," said Jerry. "Do you
know, he really hated women. I think you are the first one he ever
tolerated. He is very fond of you now."</p>

<p>"You weren't particularly keen about us yourself," Corrie
reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I'd never known a Dutch girl."</p>

<p>"That was nice. You're improving. But don't tell me that the
finest State in the Union hasn't the finest girls in the
world."</p>

<p>"There is only one 'finest girl in the world,' and she is not
from Oklahoma."</p>

<p>Corrie laughed. "I know what you're doing?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You're handing me a line. Isn't that what you Americans call
it?"</p>

<p>"I'm not handing you a line, Corrie. You know how I feel about
you."</p>

<p>"I'm not a mind reader."</p>

<p>"You're the most wonderful thing that has ever come into my
life."</p>

<p>"Now don't tell me that you're making love to me!"</p>

<p>"That is the general idea that I have in mind," said Jerry, "but
I guess I'm not so hot at it." He was looking into her eyes. Their
misty depths reflected the firelight, but deep below the surface
there burned another light, such a light as he had never seen in a
woman's eyes before.

<p>"God! but you're wonderful," he said.</p>

<p>Corrie smiled. "That's what you said before, but that time you
called me a thing. They tell me you're a great pilot, Captain."</p>

<p>He knew she was making fun of him; but he didn't care&mdash;he
could still see that light in her eyes.

<p>"I'm not a great pilot. I'm a great coward. I'm so scared of
you that I can't say three little words."

<p>Corrie laughed, and she didn't try to help him.

<p>"Listen!" he blurted. "How do you think you'll like living
in Oklahoma?"</p>

<p>"I shall like it very much," she said.</p>

<p>"Darling!" said Jerry. "I've got to kiss you. I've got to kiss
you right now&mdash;if it weren't for all these people in
here."</p>

<p>"We could go outside," said Corrie.</p>

<p>Sergeant Rosetti held Sarina in his arms. His mouth covered
hers. Her arms about his neck pressed him to her fiercely. Corrie
and Jerry, coming from the firelight into the night, nearly bumped
into them. Then they walked on to a distance.</p>

<p>"I suppose sergeants aren't supposed to be able to teach their
captains anything," said Corrie; "but then Sergeant Rosetti is a
most unusual sergeant." She was panting a little a moment later
when she gently pushed him away. "You misogynists!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bubonovitch was sitting by the fire just inside the
mouth of the cave. He had seen Shrimp and Sarina go out arm in arm;
then Corrie and Jerry had gone out into the darkness. "I gotta have
love," said Bubonovitch, trying to make friends with little Keta.
Little Keta bit him. "Nobody loves me," said the sergeant,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Day after day the Foreign Legion fought with nature for every
hard-won mile. Often some of them were so exhausted by the time
they made camp at the end of a day that they fell asleep without
eating. They were too tired even to talk much. But there was no
complaining. Corrie and Sarina held their own with the men, who
were very proud of them.</p>

<p>"They're lucky they haven't much to carry," remarked
Bubonovitch. "Add them together and they wouldn't weigh any more
than I do. Maybe they could throw in Shrimp, too. After the war I
think I'll hire the three of them and start a flea circus."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Wot you ought to have did," said Shrimp, "is went in de
Navy. Den you'd a had a battlewagon to haul you around, you big
cow."</p>

<p>"What you should have done; not 'Wot you ought to have did,'"
corrected Sarina, who had been laboring to bring Shrimp's English
more into line with that which the Catholic sisters had taught her,
to the secret amusement of the rest of the company.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch had once said to Jerry: "The granddaughter of a
Borneo head hunter teaching an American English! I have seen
everything now."</p>

<p>Sarina made no effort to spare Shrimp's feelings. She corrected
him in front of everybody, and often in the middle of a sentence.
And Shrimp never objected. He just grinned and started over. And he
was improving. He had almost stopped saying dis and dat, but did
and done still troubled him. Douglas said: "Ain't love
wonderful!"</p>

<p>They were nearing Mt. Masoerai, slightly short of which they
were to recross the range and start down toward the sea. It had
already been a month since they had left the camp of the
guerrillas, and they had had only hardships with which to contend.
Never had any of them been in great danger, nor had they seen a
human being other than themselves. And then, out of a clear sky,
disaster struck. Tarzan was captured by the Japs.</p>

<p>They were following a well marked game trail, Tarzan moving
through the trees a short distance ahead of them, as usual.
Suddenly he came upon a patrol of Japs. They had stopped in the
trail to rest. Tarzan moved closer to determine the strength of the
detachment. He still had ample time to return and warn his
companions and dispose them for whatever might eventuate. Little
Keta rode upon his shoulder. Tarzan cautioned him to silence.</p>

<p>The man's attention was riveted upon the Japs. He was unaware of
the menace hanging just above him. But Keta saw it and commenced to
scream. The Japs looked up. The coils of a huge python encircled
the body of the man, galvanizing him to action. His knife flashed.
The wounded snake writhed frantically in pain and rage, loosing its
hold upon the branch that had supported it, and the two fell into
the trail at the feet of the Japs. Keta fled.</p>

<p>The Japs fell upon the snake with bayonets and swords, killing
it quickly. And Tarzan was at their mercy. There were too many of
them. A dozen bayonets were hovering but inches above his body as
he lay in the trail upon his back, helpless.</p>

<p>They took his bow and arrows and knife from him. An officer
stepped close and kicked him in the side. "Get up!" he said, in
English. He had been a truck gardener in Culver City. He was short
and bandy-legged. He had buck teeth, and he wore horn-rimmed
glasses. He might have stepped out of a Lichty cartoon. His men had
nicknamed him "Whale" on account of his size. He stood a full five
feet six in his sandals.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"Col. John Clayton, Royal Air Force."</p>

<p>"You're an American," said the Jap. Tarzan did not reply. "What
are you doing here?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"I have told you all that I am required to tell you, and all
that I intend telling you."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that." He turned to a sergeant and gave
instructions in Japanese. The sergeant formed the detachment, half
in front of and half behind the prisoner, then they started along
the trail in the same direction that the Foreign Legion was
traveling. Tarzan saw from indications along the trail that they
were retracing their steps from the point at which they had halted.
He assumed that whatever their mission had been, they had completed
it and were returning to camp.</p>

<p>Little Keta fled through the trees until he sighted the Foreign
Legion; then he dropped down and leaped to Shrimp's shoulder. He
threw both arms about the man's neck and screamed and jabbered in
his ear.</p>

<p>"Something must have happened to Tarzan," said Jerry. "Keta is
trying to tell us. He wouldn't leave Tarzan if things were all
right with him."</p>

<p>"May I go along the trail and take a look, Cap?" asked Rosetti.
"I can travel faster'n the rest of you."</p>

<p>"Yes. Get going. We'll follow."</p>

<p>Shrimp moved at an easy trot. Keta seemed satisfied now; so the
man was sure that Jerry had been right. Tarzan was in trouble. Soon
Shrimp heard voices ahead and the clank of accouterments. The Japs,
apprehending no danger, marched carelessly. Shrimp came closer; and
presently, towering above the little pseudo men, he saw the head
and shoulders of Tarzan. Tarzan a prisoner of the Japs! It was
incredible. Shrimp's heart sank&mdash;the heart which, not so long
ago, had been filled with hatred of Englishmen.</p>

<p>The news that Rosetti brought back to the others appalled them
all. The loss of the Lord of the Jungle would be a sore blow to the
little company, but they thought first of Tarzan's safety rather
than their own. He had inspired within the breasts of all not only
respect and admiration, but real affection as well. That was
because, as Shrimp had once confided to Bubonovitch, "De guy's
regular."</p>

<p>"How many Japs were there, Rosetti?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"About twenty. They's nine of us, Cap'n, which is more than
enough."</p>

<p>"You can say that again," said Bubonovitch. "Let's go get
him."</p>

<p>"We can't attack them from the rear on this narrow trail without
endangering Tarzan. We'll have to trail them until we find a better
place to attack," said Jerry.</p>

<p>The trail broke from the forest at the rim of a narrow canyon.
Below him, Tarzan saw what was evidently a temporary camp. Half a
dozen Jap soldiers guarded some equipment and a few pack animals.
The equipment was scattered about in a disorderly manner. Some of
it, probably perishable provisions, was covered with tarpaulin.
There were no shelters. From the appearance of the camp, Tarzan
concluded that the officer was inefficient. The less efficient, the
easier he would be to escape from.</p>

<p>2nd Lieut. Kenzo Kaneko snapped instructions at a sergeant, and
the sergeant bound the prisoner's wrists behind his back. Though
the lieutenant may have been inefficient, the sergeant was not. He
bound Tarzan's wrists so securely and with so many strands that not
even the muscles of the Lord of the Jungle could have freed
him.</p>

<p>The sergeant similarly bound the captive's ankles. This done, he
pushed and tripped him; so that Tarzan fell to the ground heavily.
A horse was brought and the packsaddle adjusted. A line was made
fast to the saddle, the other end was then attached to Tarzan's
feet. Lieut. Kaneko came and stood over him. He smiled
benignly.</p>

<p>"I should hate to have the horse whipped into a run," he said.
"It would hurt me, but it would hurt you more."</p>

<p>The horse had been bridled, and a soldier carrying a whip had
mounted it. The other soldiers stood about, grinning. They were
about to witness an exhibition that would appeal to their sadistic
natures.</p>

<p>"If you will answer my questions," continued Kaneko, "the horse
will not be whipped, the line will be detached. How many are in
your party and where are they?"</p>

<p>Tarzan remained silent. Kaneko no longer smiled. His features
became convulsed with rage, or maybe he was only simulating rage in
order to frighten his victim. He stepped closer and kicked Tarzan
in the side.</p>

<p>"You refuse to answer?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan returned the Jap's stare. His face registered no emotion,
not even the contempt he felt for this grotesque caricature of man.
Kaneko's eyes fell beneath those of his prisoner. Something in
those eyes frightened him, and that really filled him with genuine
rage.</p>

<p>He snapped a command at the man on the horse. The fellow leaned
forward and raised his whip. A rifle cracked. The horse reared and
toppled backward. Another shot. 2nd Lieut. Kenzo Kaneko screamed
and sprawled upon his face. Then came a fusillade of shots.
Soldiers fell in rapid succession. Those who could, fled down the
valley in utter demoralization as nine riflemen leaped down the
steep trail into the camp.</p>

<p>A wounded Jap rose on an elbow and fired at them. Corrie shot
him. Then Rosetti and Sarina were among them with bayonet and
parang, and there were no more wounded Japs.</p>

<p>Jerry cut Tarzan's bonds. "You arrived just about in time," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Just like the cavalry in a horse opera," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"What do you think we'd better do now?" Jerry asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"We must try to finish off the rest of them. This is evidently
just a detachment from a larger force. If any of these fellows get
back to that force, we'll be hunted down."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how many there were?"</p>

<p>"About twenty-five or twenty-six. How many have we killed?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen," said Rosetti. "I just counted 'em."</p>

<p>Tarzan picked up a rifle and took a belt of ammunition from one
of the dead Japs. "We'll go back up to the rim of the valley. I'll
go ahead through the trees and try to head them off. The rest of
you work down along the rim until you can fire down on them."</p>

<p>A half-mile below the camp Tarzan overhauled the survivors.
There were ten of them. A sergeant had gathered them together, and
was evidently exhorting them to return to the fight. As they turned
back, none too enthusiastically, Tarzan fired and brought down the
sergeant. A private started to run down the valley. Tarzan fired
again, and the man dropped. Now, the others realized that the shots
had come from farther down the valley. They sought cover from that
direction. Tarzan held his fire so as not to reveal his
position.</p>

<p>The Foreign Legion, hearing the two shots, knew that Tarzan had
contacted the enemy. They pushed forward through the trees at the
rim of the valley. Jerry was in the lead. Presently he saw a Jap
who had taken cover behind a fallen tree. Then he saw another and
another. He pointed them out, and the firing commenced. Tarzan also
started firing again.</p>

<p>The Japs, cut off in both directions in the narrow valley,
without a leader, lacking sufficient intelligence or initiative to
act otherwise, blew themselves up with their own grenades.</p>

<p>"They're damned accommodating," said Douglas.</p>

<p>"Nice little guys," said Davis; "trying to save us
ammunition."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' down to help 'em out," said Rosetti, "if any of 'em
are left alive." He slid and rolled down the steep cliff-side, and
Sarina was right behind him.</p>

<p>"There," said Bubonovitch, "is the ideal helpmeet."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SIX weeks later the Foreign Legion came down to
the coast below Moekemoeko. It had been a strenuous six weeks beset
by many hazards. Jap positions in increasing numbers had
necessitated many long detours. Only the keen sensibility of the
Lord of the Jungle, ranging well ahead of the little company, had
saved them from disaster on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>There was a Jap anti-aircraft battery about a kilometer up the
coast from where they lay concealed. Between them and the battery
was a native village. It was in this village that Sarina expected
to find friends who could furnish them a boat and provisions.</p>

<p>"If I had a sarong," she said, "I could walk right into the
village in daytime, even if Japs were there; but this outfit might
arouse suspicion. I'll have to take a chance, and sneak in after
dark."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can get you a sarong," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You will go into the village?" asked Sarina.</p>

<p>"Tonight," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You will probably find sarongs that were washed today and hung
out to dry."</p>

<p>After dark Tarzan left them. He moved silently through the
stagnant air of the humid, equatorial night. In the camp that he
had left that was not a camp but a hiding place, the others spoke
in whispers. They were oppressed by the heat and the humidity and
the constant sense of lurking danger. When they had been in the
mountains they had thought their lot rather miserable. Now they
recalled with regret the relative coolness of the higher
altitudes.</p>

<p>"I have been in the hills for so long," said Corrie, "that I had
almost forgotten how frightful the coast climate can be."</p>

<p>"It is rather rotten," agreed van der Bos.</p>

<p>"Dutchmen must be gluttons for punishment," said Bubonovitch,
"to colonize a Turkish bath."</p>

<p>"No," said van der Bos; "we are gluttons for profit. This is a
very rich part of the world."</p>

<p>"You can have it," said Rosetti. "I don't want no part of
it."</p>

<p>"We wish that the rest of the world felt the same way," said van
der Bos.</p>

<p>Tarzan swung into a tree that overlooked the village. A full
moon lighted the open spaces. The ornate, native houses cast dense
shadows. Natives squatted in the moonlight, smoking and gossiping.
Three sarongs hung limp in the dead air from a pole across which
they had been thrown to dry. Tarzan settled himself to wait until
the people had gone into their houses for the night.</p>

<p>After a while a man entered the kampong from the west. In the
bright moonlight, Tarzan could see him plainly. He was a Jap
officer, the commanding officer of the anti-aircraft battery a
short distance away. When the natives saw him they arose and bowed.
He approached them with an arrogant swagger, speaking a few words
to a young woman. She arose meekly and followed him into the house
that he had commandeered for his own use.</p>

<p>When his back was turned the natives made faces at him, and
obscene gestures. Tarzan was content. What he had seen assured him
that the natives would be friendly to any enemy of the Japs. After
a while the natives went into their houses and silence descended
upon the kampong.</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped to the ground and moved into the shadow of a
building. He stole silently to a point as near to the sarongs as he
could get without coming out into the moonlight. He stood there for
a moment listening; then he stepped quickly across the
moon-drenched space and seized a sarong.</p>

<p>Returning, he had almost reached the shadow when a woman stepped
from behind the corner of a building. They met face to face in the
moonlight. The woman, startled, opened her mouth to scream. Tarzan
seized her and clapped a hand over her parted lips. Then he dragged
her into the shadow.</p>

<p>"Quiet!" he commanded in Dutch, "and I will not harm you." He
hoped that she understood Dutch. She did.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A friend," he replied.</p>

<p>"Friends do not steal from us," she said.</p>

<p>"I am only borrowing this sarong. It will be returned. You will
not tell the Jap about this? He is my enemy, too."</p>

<p>"I will not tell him. We tell them nothing."</p>

<p>"Good," said Tarzan. "The sarong will be returned tomorrow."</p>

<p>He wheeled and was lost in the shadows. The woman shook her
head, and climbed the ladder that gave entrance to her house. She
told her family of the adventure that had befallen her.</p>

<p>"You will never see the sarong again," said one.</p>

<p>"For the sarong, I do not care," she replied. "It did not belong
to me. But I should like to see the wild man again. He was very
beautiful."</p>

<p>The following morning, Sarina entered the village. The first
woman she met recognized her, and soon she was surrounded by old
friends. She warned them away for fear that there might be Japs in
the village who would recognize from their greetings that she must
be a newcomer and therefore some one to be investigated. Sarina did
not wish to be investigated by any Japs. The villagers understood,
and returned to their normal activities. Then Sarina sought out
Alauddin Shah, the village chief. He seemed glad to see her, and
asked her many questions, most of which she avoided answering until
she could determine what his relations were with the Japs.</p>

<p>She soon learned that he hated them. Alauddin Shah was a proud
old man, a hereditary chief. The Japs had slapped and kicked him
and forced him to bow low even to their enlisted men. Satisfied,
Sarina told her story, explained what she and her companions
needed, and solicited his aid.</p>

<p>"It will be a hazardous journey," he said. "There are many enemy
ships in these waters, and it is a long way to Australia. But if
you and your friends wish to risk it, I will help you. There is a
large proa hidden in the river a few kilometers down the coast from
the village. We will provision it for you, but it will take time.
We are not regularly watched, because we have given the Japs no
trouble, but they are in and out of the kampong almost every day.
One officer sleeps here every night. Everything that we do must be
done with the utmost caution."</p>

<p>"If you will leave provisions every day in a house near the edge
of the kampong, we will come at night and take them to the proa,"
Sarina told him. "Thus you can escape blame if we are discovered.
You can be very much surprised when you discover that some one has
come into the village at night and stolen food."</p>

<p>Alauddin Shah smiled. "You are a true daughter of Big Jon," he
said.</p>

<p>A month passed, a month of narrow escapes from detection, a
month of harrowed nerves; but at last the proa was provisioned. And
now they waited for a moonless night and a favorable wind. Barbed
wire and obstructions at the mouth of the stream had been left in
place until the proa was ready. Now they had to be removed&mdash;a
dangerous job in waters infested with crocodiles. But at last even
that was accomplished.</p>

<p>At last it came&mdash;N-Night they called it. The tide was
right. There was no moon. There was a brisk off-shore wind. Slowly
they poled the proa down to the sea. The great lateen sail was
hoisted. Close in the lee of the shore it caught little wind, but
farther out it bellied to a strong breeze, and the proa gained
speed.</p>

<p>While moonless, the night was clear. They set a course due
south, the Southern Cross their lodestar. They had fashioned a
crude log and log line, and while the knots were running they tried
to estimate their speed. Sarina guessed twelve knots. She was not
far off.</p>

<p>"If this wind holds," she said, "we'll be well off the southern
tip of Nassau Island before 2:00 o'clock tomorrow morning. Then
we'll take a southwesterly course. I want to get out of the coastal
waters of Sumatra and Java before we swing to the southeast toward
Australia. This way we'll give Engano a wide berth. Then there'll
be only the Cocos Islands to worry about, as far as land is
concerned. I don't know if the Japs have anything on Cocos."</p>

<p>"Are they the same as the Keeling Islands?" asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Yes, but my father always called them the Cocos Islands because
he said Keeling was 'a damned Englishman.'" She laughed, and so did
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Nobody loves an Englishman," he said. "But I'm not so sure that
Keeling was an Englishman."</p>

<p>"There's a light at 2:00 o'clock," said Davis.</p>

<p>"Probably on Nassau," said Sarina. "Let's hope so, for if it
isn't, it's a ship's light; and we don't want any business with
ships."</p>

<p>"I don't think their ships would be showing any lights," said
Jerry. "There are too many Allied subs in these waters."</p>

<p>Morning found them in an empty ocean&mdash;just a vast, round
cauldron of tumbling gray water. The wind had freshened, and great
seas were running. S/Sgt. Rosetti was sick. Between spasms he
remarked, "I got a half-wit cousin. He joined the Navy." After a
while he said, "It won't be long now. This crate won't stand much
more, and it can't come too soon to suit me. This is the first time
in my life I ever wanted to die." Then he leaned over the rail and
heaved again.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Shrimp," said Bubonovitch. "It won't be long now
before we go ashore on Australia&mdash;maybe only a month or
so."</p>

<p>"Geeze!" groaned Rosetti.</p>

<p>"You will get over being sick pretty soon, Tony," said
Sarina.</p>

<p>"Some admirals always get sick when they first go to sea after
shore duty," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be an admiral. I joins up for air, and what do
I get? For couple or three months I been a doughboy; now I'm a gob.
Geeze!" He leaned over the rail again.</p>

<p>"Poor Tony," said Sarina.</p>

<p>The long days passed. The wind veered into the southeast. The
southeast trade wind that would blow for ten months had started.
Sarina took long tacks, first to starboard and then to port. It was
slow going, but their luck had held. They were well past the
Keeling Islands now, and no sign of enemy shipping.</p>

<p>Douglas, who had been standing his trick as lookout, had come
aft. "It's an awful lot of water," he said. "Flying it, it seems
terrible big&mdash;the Pacific, I mean; but down here on the
surface it seems like there isn't anything in the world but water;
and this is only the Indian Ocean, which ain't a drop in the bucket
alongside the Pacific. It makes you feel pretty small and
insignificant."</p>

<p>"There's sure a lot of water in the world," agreed van der
Bos.</p>

<p>"Three quarters of the whole surface of the Earth is water,"
said Corrie.</p>

<p>"And the Pacific has a greater area than all the land surfaces
of the Earth combined," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"If I owned it," said Rosetti, "I'd trade the whole damn works
for any old street corner in Chi."</p>

<p>"What I don't like about it," said Douglas, "is the total
absence of scenery. Now, in California&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's off again," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"But he's got something just the same," said Davis. "Gawd! how
I'd like to see a cow&mdash;just one measly little cow deep in the
heart of Texas."</p>

<p>"I'll settle for land, any old land, right now," said Rosetti.
"Even Brooklyn would look good. I might even settle down there. I'm
fed up on travelin'."</p>

<p>"Travel is broadening, Shrimp," said Bubonovitch. "Just look
what it's done for you. You like a Britisher, you love a dame, and
you have learned to speak fairly intelligible English, thanks to
Sarina."</p>

<p>"I ain't getting broadened much lately," objected Rosetti. "We
ain't seen nothing but water for weeks. I'd like to see something
else."</p>

<p>"Smoke at eleven o'clock!" called Jerry, who had gone forward as
lookout. Sarina smiled. The airmen's method of indicating direction
always amused her, but she had to admit that it was practical.</p>

<p>Everybody looked in the direction indicated where a black smudge
was showing just above the horizon.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're going to see something beside water now, Shrimp,"
said Davis. "Your wish was granted in a hurry."</p>

<p>"That must be a ship," called Jerry, "and I think we'd better
hightail it out of here."</p>

<p>"Toward five o'clock?" asked Sarina.</p>

<p>"Keerect," said Jerry, "and pronto."</p>

<p>They came about and sailed before the wind in a northwesterly
direction, every eye on that ominous black smudge. "It might be
British," said Corrie, hopefully.</p>

<p>"It might be," agreed Tak, "but we can't take any chances. It
might just as well be Jap."</p>

<p>For what seemed a long time there was no noticeable change in
the appearance of the thing they watched so fearfully; then
Tarzan's keen eyes discerned the superstructure of a ship rising
above the horizon. He watched closely for a few minutes. "It is
going to cut right across our course," he said. "It will pass
astern, but they're bound to sight us."</p>

<p>"If it's Jap," said Sarina, "it's bound for Sumatra or Java. Our
only chance is to hold this course and pray&mdash;pray for wind and
more wind. If it's one of those little Jap merchant ships, we can
outrun it if the wind picks up. Or if we can just hold our lead
until after dark, we can get away."</p>

<p>The proa seemed never to have moved more slowly. Straining eyes
watched the menace grow larger, as the hull of a ship climbed over
the rim of the world. "It's like a bad dream," said Corrie, "where
something horrible is chasing you, and you can't move. And the wind
is dying."</p>

<p>"You guys ain't prayin' hard enough," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"All I can remember," said Davis, "is 'now I lay me down to
sleep,' and I can't remember all of that."</p>

<p>A sudden gust of wind bellied the great sail, and the speed of
the proa increased noticeably. "Somebody hit the jack pot," said
Douglas.</p>

<p>But the strange ship continued to gain on them. "She's changed
course," said Tarzan. "She's heading for us." A moment later he
said, "I can see her colors now. She's a Jap all right."</p>

<p>"I should have gone to church like Mom always wanted me to,"
said Davis. "I might have learned some good prayers. But if I can't
pray so good," he said a moment later, "I sure can shoot good." He
picked up his rifle and slipped a clip into the magazine.</p>

<p>"We can all shoot good," said Jerry, "but we can't sink a ship
with what we got to shoot with."</p>

<p>"That's a small, armed merchantman," said Tarzan. "She probably
carries 20-mm anti-aircraft guns and .30 caliber machine guns."</p>

<p>"I guess we're out-gunned," said Bubonovitch, with a wry
grin.</p>

<p>"The effective range of the 20s is only about 1200 yards," said
Jerry. "These pop guns will do better than that. We ought to be
able to get a few Nips before they finish us off&mdash;that is if
you folks want to fight." He looked around at them. "We can
surrender, or we can fight. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say fight," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Think it over carefully," admonished Jerry. "If we put up a
fight, we shall all be killed."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to let those yellow sonsabitches knock me around
again," said Bubonovitch. "If the rest of you don't want to fight,
I won't either; but I won't be taken alive."</p>

<p>"Neither shall I," said Corrie. "How do you feel about it,
Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Fight, of course."</p>

<p>He looked at Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And you, Colonel?"</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled at him.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Does anyone object to fighting rather than surrendering?" No
one did. "Then we'd better check our rifles and load 'em. And may I
say in conclusion, it's been nice knowing you."</p>

<p>"That sounds terribly final," said Corrie, "even if you did mean
it for a joke."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is&mdash;final and no joke."</p>

<p>The merchantman was closing up on them rapidly now, for after
that one fitful gust the wind had slackened to a breeze that didn't
even fill the great triangular sail of the proa.</p>

<p>"We've been mighty lucky for a long time," said Tak. "According
to the law of chance, it should be about time for our luck to run
out."</p>

<p>There was a red flash aboard the Jap, followed by a puff of
smoke. A moment later a shell burst far short of them.</p>

<p>"Lady Luck is getting ready to hit the breeze," said
Rosetti.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"BEAUTIFUL gunnery!" said Bubonovitch. "The poor
sap doesn't even know the range of his gun."</p>

<p>"Itchy fingers probably," said Douglas.</p>

<p>"I doubt that the little admirals put their top gunnery officers
aboard little merchantmen," said Jerry; "so maybe our luck is
holding."</p>

<p>The proa was barely making headway now, as it rose and fell on
long swells. The forefoot of the oncoming ship plowed through the
deep blue of the ocean, turning up white water, as the mold board
of a plow turns up the rich loam of a field.</p>

<p>Again the Jap fired. This shell fell wide, but not so short.
Jerry and Corrie were sitting close together, one of his hands
covering one of hers. "I guess van Prins was right," said Jerry.
"He said we were crazy. I shouldn't have brought you along,
darling."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have it otherwise," said Corrie. "We've had this
much time together, that we wouldn't have had if I hadn't come with
you. I've never had a chance to say 'for better or for worse,' but
it has been in my heart always."</p>

<p>He leaned closer to her. "Do you, Corrie, take this man to be
your wedded husband?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Corrie, very softly. "Do you, Jerry, take this
woman to be your wedded wife, to cherish and protect until death do
you part?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Jerry, a little huskily. He slipped the class ring
from his finger and on to Corrie's ring finger. "With this ring I
do thee wed, and with all my worldly goods endow." Then he kissed
her.</p>

<p>"I think," said Corrie, "that as far as the service is concerned
our memories were a little lame; but we had the general idea at
least. And I feel very much married, sweetheart."</p>

<p>A near miss deluged them with water. They did not seem to notice
it.</p>

<p>"My wife," said Jerry. "So young, so beautiful."</p>

<p>"'Wife!'," repeated Corrie.</p>

<p>"The guy's gettin' closer," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>The fin of a shark cut the water between the proa and the Jap.
Little Keta watched it, fortunately unaware of what it might
portend. Tarzan raised the sights on his rifle and fired at the
figures lining the rail of the Jap. The others followed his
example, and presently ten rifles were blazing away. If they
accomplished nothing else, they emptied the rail of sightseers and
caused much confusion aboard the merchantman. Yet, they
accomplished one more thing: they spurred the anti-aircraft gunners
into frenzied activity. Shell bursts dotted the ocean.</p>

<p>"If their ammo holds out," said Rosetti, "they got to hit us
just accidentally. Geeze! what lousy shootin'!"</p>

<p>At last it came, as they knew it must&mdash;a direct hit. Jerry
saw half of Sing Tai's body hurled fifty feet into the air. Tak van
der Bos's right leg was torn off. The entire company was thrown
into the ocean; then the Jap moved in and commenced to machine gun
them as they swam about or clung to pieces of the wreckage. The aim
of the gunners was execrable, but again they knew that this was the
end of the Foreign Legion&mdash;that eventually some of those
hundreds of whining bullets would find them all.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch and Douglas were holding up van der Bos, who had
fainted. Jerry was trying to keep between Corrie and the machine
guns. Suddenly something commenced to drag van der Bos down. One of
Bubonovitch's feet struck a solid body moving beneath. "Migawd!" he
yelled. "A shark's got Tak." Bullets were ricocheting off the water
all around them.</p>

<p>Tarzan, who had been thrown some distance by the shell burst,
was swimming toward Bubonovitch and Douglas when he heard the
former's warning. Diving quickly beneath the surface, he drew his
knife. A few swift, strong strokes brought him close to the shark.
A mighty surge of his knife arm ripped open the belly of the huge
fish, disemboweling it. It released its hold on van der Bos and
turned on Tarzan, but the man eluded its jaws and struck again and
again with his knife.</p>

<p>The water was red with blood as another shark darted in and
attacked its fellow. The first shark swam sluggishly away while the
other bit and tore at it. For the moment the survivors were freed
from one menace, but the bullets still pinged close.</p>

<p>With Tarzan's help, Bubonovitch and Douglas got van der Bos to a
large piece of wreckage&mdash;one of the outrigger floats. Tarzan
tore a strip from what remained of van der Bos's trousers, and
while he and Douglas held the man on the float, Bubonovitch applied
a tourniquet. Tak still breathed, but fortunately he was
unconscious.</p>

<p>Bubonovitch shook his head. "He ain't got a chance," he said.
"But then, neither have we."</p>

<p>"The sharks are going to have plenty good feeding today," said
Douglas. They were all looking at the Jap ship. Again the rail was
lined with bandy-legged little men. Some of them were firing
pistols at the people in the water. Keta, perched on a piece of
wreckage, scolded and threatened.</p>

<p>There was a terrific detonation. A great fan-shaped burst of
flame shot hundreds of feet into the air from amidships of the
merchantman, and a pillar of smoke rose hundreds of feet higher. A
second explosion followed and the ship broke in two, the bow hurled
almost clear of the water. The two halves sunk almost immediately,
leaving a few scorched and screaming creatures struggling in
burning oil.</p>

<p>For a few moments the survivors of the proa looked on in stunned
silence, which was broken by Rosetti. "I knew She'd hear me," he
said. "She ain't ever failed me yet."</p>

<p>"She'll have to pull a real miracle yet to get us out of the
middle of the Indian Ocean before we drown or the sharks get us,"
said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Pray like hell, Shrimp," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>"Don't think I ain't, brother," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" shouted Corrie, pointing.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards beyond the burning oil a submarine was
surfacing. The Union Jack was painted on the side of its conning
tower.</p>

<p>"There's your miracle, Cap'n," said Rosetti. "She ain't ever
failed me yet. I mean in a real pinch."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the British now, sergeant?" asked Tarzan,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I love 'em," said Rosetti.</p>

<p>The sub circled to windward of the burning oil and drew
alongside the wreckage of the proa. The hatch spewed men to haul
the castaways aboard. Tarzan and Bubonovitch passed van der Bos up
first. He died as they laid him gently on the deck.</p>

<p>Corrie and Sarina followed, and then the men. Lt. Cmdr. Bolton,
skipper of the sub, was full of amazement and questions. Corrie
knelt beside van der Bos's body, trying to hold back the tears.
Jerry joined her.</p>

<p>"Poor Tak," she said.</p>

<p>They did not take him below. He was buried at sea, Bolton
reading the burial service. Then they all went below for dry
clothing and hot coffee, and presently the sorrow and depression
seemed less, for they were all young and they had all seen much of
death.</p>

<p>When Bolton heard their story, he said, "Well, you have
certainly played in luck from the start; but my happening to be
right where I was when you needed me is little short of a
miracle."</p>

<p>"It hasn't been luck, sir," said Rosetti. "It's been Holy Mary,
Mother of Jesus from start to finish, including the miracle."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it," said Bolton, "for none of you has any
business being alive now, by all the laws of chance. Nothing but
divine intervention could have preserved you. It even arranged that
I saved my last two fish for that Jap. You really should all be
dead."</p>

<p>"Mary certainly helped in a pinch," said Jerry, "but if Tarzan
hadn't been on the job all the time, pinch hitting for her, we'd
have been sunk months ago."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bolton, "I think you won't have to call on either
Mary or Tarzan from now on. I'm ordered to Sydney, and it won't be
so long now before you can sit down in Ushers Hotel with a steak
and kidney pie in front of you."</p>

<p>"And drink warm beer," said Bubonovitch.</p>

<p>Later that evening Jerry and Rosetti approached Bolton.
"Captain," said the former, "are you authorized to perform marriage
ceremonies at sea?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am."</p>

<p>"Then you got two jobs right now, skipper," said Rosetti.</p>
