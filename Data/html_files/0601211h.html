  <p class="first">LUCKILY for "Ham" Hammond it was mid-winter when the
  mudspout came. Mid-winter, that is, in the Venusian sense, which is nothing
  at all like the conception of the season generally entertained on Earth,
  except possibly, by dwellers in the hotter regions of the Amazon basin, or
  the Congo.</p>

  <p>They, perhaps, might form a vague mental picture of winter on Venus by
  visualizing their hottest summer days, multiplying the heat, discomfort and
  unpleasant denizens of the jungle by ten or twelve.</p>

  <p>On Venus, as is now well known, the seasons occur alternately in opposite
  hemispheres, as on the Earth, but with a very important difference. Here,
  when North America and Europe swelter in summer, it is winter in Australia
  and Cape Colony and Argentina. It is the northern and southern hemispheres
  which alternate their seasons.</p>

  <p>But on Venus, very strangely, it is the eastern and western hemispheres,
  because the seasons of Venus depend, not on inclination to the plane of the
  ecliptic, but on libration. Venus does not rotate, but keeps the same face
  always toward the Sun, just as the Moon does toward the earth. One face is
  forever daylight, and the other forever night, and only along the twilight
  zone, a strip five hundred miles wide, is human habitation possible, a thin
  ring of territory circling the planet.</p>

  <p>Toward the sunlit side it verges into the blasting heat of a desert where
  only a few Venusian creatures live, and on the night edge the strip ends
  abruptly in the colossal ice barrier produced by the condensation of the
  upper winds that sweep endlessly from the rising air of the hot hemisphere to
  cool and sink and rush back again from the cold one.</p>

  <p>The chilling of warm air always produces rain, and at the edge of the
  darkness the rain freezes to form these great ramparts. What lies beyond,
  what fantastic forms of life may live in the starless darkness of the frozen
  face, or whether that region is as dead as the airless Moon&mdash;those are
  mysteries.</p>

  <p>But the slow libration, a ponderous wobbling of the planet from side to
  side, does produce the effect of seasons. On the lands of the twilight zone,
  first in one hemisphere and then the other, the cloud-hidden Sun seems to
  rise gradually for fifteen days, then sink for the same period. It never
  ascends far, and only near the ice barrier does it seem to touch the horizon;
  for the libration is only seven degrees, but it is sufficient to produce
  noticeable fifteen-day seasons.</p>

  <p>But such seasons! In the winter the temperature drops sometimes to a humid
  but bearable ninety, but, two weeks later, a hundred and forty is a cool day
  near the torrid edge of the zone. And always, winter and summer, the
  intermittent rains drip sullenly down to be absorbed by the spongy soil and
  given back again as sticky, unpleasant, unhealthy steam.</p>

  <p>And that, the vast amount of moisture on Venus, was the greatest surprise
  of the first human visitors; the clouds had been seen, of course, but the
  spectroscope denied the presence of water, naturally, since it was analyzing
  light reflected from the upper cloud surfaces, fifty miles above the planet's
  face.</p>

  <p>That abundance of water has strange consequences. There are no seas or
  oceans on Venus, if we except the probability of vast, silent, and eternally
  frozen oceans on the sunless side. On the hot hemisphere evaporation is too
  rapid, and the rivers that flow out of the ice mountains simply diminish and
  finally vanish, dried up.</p>

  <p>A further consequence is the curiously unstable nature of the land of the
  twilight zone. Enormous subterranean rivers course invisibly through it, some
  boiling, some cold as the ice from which they flow. These are the cause of
  the mud eruptions that make human habitation in the Hotlands such a gamble; a
  perfectly solid and apparently safe area of soil may be changed suddenly into
  a boiling sea of mud in which buildings sink and vanish, together,
  frequently, with their occupants.</p>

  <p>There is no way of predicting these catastrophes; only on the rare
  outcroppings of bed rock is a structure safe, and so all permanent human
  settlements cluster about the mountains.</p>

  <p>Sam Hammond was a trader. He was one of those adventurous individuals who
  always appear on the frontiers and fringes of habitable regions. Most of
  these fall into two classes; they are either reckless daredevils pursuing
  danger, or outcasts, criminal or otherwise, pursuing either solitude or
  forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>Ham Hammond was neither. He was pursuing no such abstractions, but the
  good, solid lure of wealth. He was, in fact, trading with the natives for the
  spore-pods of the Venusian plant xixtchil, from which terrestrial chemists
  would extract trihydroxyl-tertiary-tolunitrile-beta-anthraquinone, the
  xixtline or triple-T-B-A that was so effective in rejuvenation
  treatments.</p>

  <p>Ham was young and sometimes wondered why rich old men&mdash;and women
  &mdash;would pay such tremendous prices for a few more years of virility,
  especially as the treatments didn't actually increase the span of life, but
  just produced a sort of temporary and synthetic youth.</p>

  <p>Gray hair darkened, wrinkles filled out, bald heads grew fuzzy, and then,
  in a few years, the rejuvenated person was just as dead as he would have
  been, anyway. But as long as triple-T-B-A commanded a price about equal to
  its weight in radium, why, Ham was willing to take the gamble to obtain
  it.</p>

  <p>He had never really expected the mudspout. Of course it was an ever-
  present danger, but when, staring idly through the window of his shack over
  the writhing and steaming Venusian plain, he had seen the sudden boiling
  pools erupting all around, it had come as a shocking surprise.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was paralyzed; then he sprang into immediate and frantic
  action. He pulled on his enveloping suit of rubberlike transkin; he strapped
  the great bowls of mudshoes to his feet; he tied the precious bag of
  spore-pods to his shoulders, packed some food, and then burst into the
  open.</p>

  <p>The ground was still semisolid, but even as he watched, the black soil
  boiled out around the metal walls of the shack, the cube tilted a trifle, and
  then sank deliberately from sight, and the mud sucked and gurgled as it
  closed gently above the spot.</p>

  <p>Ham caught himself. One couldn't stand still in the midst of a mudspout,
  even with the bow-like mudshoes as support. Once let the viscous stuff flow
  over the rim and the luckless victim was trapped; he couldn't raise his foot
  against the suction, and first slowly, then more quickly, he'd follow the
  shack.</p>

  <p>So Ham started off over the boiling swamp, walking with the peculiar
  sliding motion he had learned by much practice, never raising the mudshoes
  above the surface, but sliding them along, careful that no mud topped the
  curving rim.</p>

  <p>It was a tiresome motion, but absolutely necessary. He slid along as if on
  snowshoes, bearing west because that was the direction of the dark side, and
  if he had to walk to safety, he might as well do it in coolness. The area of
  swamp was unusually large; he covered at least a mile before he attained a
  slight rise in the ground, and the mudshoes clumped on solid, or nearly
  solid, soil.</p>

  <p>He was bathed in perspiration; and his transkin suit was hot as a boiler
  room, but one grows accustomed to that on Venus. He'd have given half his
  supply of xixtchil pods for the opportunity to open the mask of the suit, to
  draw a breath of even the steamy and humid Venusian air, but that was
  impossible; impossible, at least, if he had any inclination to continue
  living.</p>

  <p>One breath of unfiltered air anywhere near the warm edge of the twilight
  zone was quick and very painful death; Ham would have drawn in uncounted
  millions of the spores of those fierce Venusian molds, and they'd have
  sprouted in furry and nauseating masses in his nostrils, his mouth, his
  lungs, and eventually in his ears and eyes.</p>

  <p>Breathing them wasn't even a necessary requirement; once he'd come upon a
  trader's body with the molds springing from his flesh. The poor fellow had
  somehow torn a rip in his transkin suit, and that was enough.</p>

  <p>The situation made eating and drinking in the open a problem on Venus; one
  had to wait until a rain had precipitated the spores, when it was safe for
  half an hour or so. Even then the water must have been recently boiled and
  the food just removed from its can; otherwise, as had happened to Ham more
  than once, the food was apt to turn abruptly into a fuzzy mass of molds that
  grew about as fast as the minute hand moved on a clock. A disgusting sight! A
  disgusting planet!</p>

  <p>That last reflection was induced by Ham's view of the quagmire that had
  engulfed his shack. The heavier vegetation had gone with it, but already avid
  and greedy life was emerging, wriggling mud grass and the bulbous fungi
  called "walking balls." And all around a million little slimy creatures
  slithered across the mud, eating each other rapaciously, being torn to bits,
  and each fragment re-forming to a complete creature.</p>

  <p>A thousand different species, but all the same in one respect; each of
  them was all appetite. In common with most Venusian beings, they had a
  multiplicity of both legs and mouths; in fact some of them were little more
  than blobs of skin split into dozens of hungry mouths, and crawling on a
  hundred spidery legs.</p>

  <p>All life on Venus is more or less parasitic. Even the plants that draw
  their nourishment directly from soil and air have also the ability to absorb
  and digest&mdash;and, often enough, to trap&mdash;animal food. So fierce is
  the competition on that humid strip of land between the fire and the ice that
  one who has never seen it must fail even to imagine it.</p>

  <p>The animal kingdom wars incessantly on itself and the plant world; the
  vegetable kingdom retaliates, and frequently outdoes the other in the
  production of monstrous predatory horrors that one would even hesitate to
  call plant life. A terrible world!</p>

  <p>In the few moments that Ham had paused to look back, ropy creepers had
  already entangled his legs; transkin was impervious, of course, but he had to
  cut the things away with his knife, and the black, nauseating juices that
  flowed out of them smeared on his suit and began instantly to grow furry as
  the molds sprouted. He shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a place!" Ham growled, stooping to remove his mudshoes, which he
  slung carefully over his back.</p>

  <p>He slogged away through the writhing vegetation, automatically dodging the
  awkward thrusts of the Jack Ketch trees as they cast their nooses hopefully
  toward his arms and head.</p>

  <p>Now and again he passed one that dangled some trapped creature, usually
  unrecognizable because the molds had enveloped it in a fuzzy shroud, while
  the tree itself was placidly absorbing victim and molds alike.</p>

  <p>"Horrible place!" Ham muttered, kicked a writhing mass of nameless little
  vermin from his path.</p>

  <p>He mused; his shack had been situated rather nearer the hot edge of the
  twilight zone; it was a trifle over two hundred and fifty miles to the shadow
  line, though of course that varied with the libration. But one couldn't
  approach the line too closely, anyway, because of the fierce, almost
  inconceivable, storms that raged where the hot upper winds encountered the
  icy blasts of the night side, giving rise to the birth throes of the ice
  barrier.</p>

  <p>So a hundred and fifty miles due west would be sufficient to bring
  coolness, to enter a region too temperate for the molds, where he could walk
  in comparative comfort. And then, not more than fifty miles north, lay the
  American settlement Erotia, named, obviously, after that troublesome mythical
  son of Venus, Cupid.</p>

  <p>Intervening, of course, were the ranges of the Mountains of Eternity, not
  those mighty twenty-mile-high peaks whose summits are occasionally glimpsed
  by Earthly telescopes, and that forever sunder British Venus from the
  American possessions, but, even at the point he planned to cross, very
  respectable mountains indeed. He was on the British side now; not that any
  one cared. Traders came and went as they pleased.</p>

  <p>Well, that meant about two hundred miles. No reason why he couldn't make
  it; he was armed with both automatic and flame-pistol, and water was no
  problem, if carefully boiled. Under pressure of necessity, one could even eat
  Venusian life&mdash;but it required hunger and thorough cooking and a sturdy
  stomach.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the taste so much as the appearance, or so he'd been told. He
  grimaced; beyond doubt he'd be driven to find out for himself, since his
  canned food couldn't possibly last out the trip. Nothing to worry about, Ham
  kept telling himself. In fact, plenty to be glad about; the xixtchil pods in
  his pack represented as much wealth as he could have accumulated by ten years
  of toil back on Earth.</p>

  <p>No danger&mdash;and yet, men had vanished on Venus, dozens of them. The
  molds had claimed them, or some fierce unearthly monster, or perhaps one of
  the many unknown living horrors, both plant and animal.</p>

  <p>Ham trudged along, keeping always to the clearings about the Jack Ketch
  trees, since these vegetable omnivores kept other life beyond the reach of
  their greedy nooses. Elsewhere progress was impossible, for the Venusian
  jungle presented such a terrific tangle of writhing and struggling forms that
  one could move only by cutting the way, step by step, with infinite
  labor.</p>

  <p>Even then there was the danger of Heaven only knew what fanged and
  venomous creatures whose teeth might pierce the protective membrane of
  transkin, and a crack in that meant death. Even the unpleasant Jack Ketch
  trees were preferable company, he reflected, as he slapped their questing
  lariats aside.</p>

  <p>Six hours after Ham had started his involuntary journey, it rained. He
  seized the opportunity, found a place where a recent mudspout had cleared the
  heavier vegetation away, and prepared to eat. First, however, he scooped up
  some scummy water, filtered it through the screen attached for that purpose
  to his canteen, and set about sterilizing it.</p>

  <p>Fire was difficult to manage, since dry fuel is rare indeed in the
  Hotlands of Venus, but Ham tossed a thermide tablet into the liquid, and the
  chemicals boiled the water instantly, escaping themselves as gases. If the
  water retained a slight ammoniacal taste&mdash;well, that was the least of
  his discomforts, he mused, as he covered it and set it by to cool.</p>

  <p>He uncapped a can of beans, watched a moment to see that no stray molds
  had remained in the air to infect the food, then opened the visor of his suit
  and swallowed hastily. Thereafter he drank the blood-warm water and poured
  carefully what remained into the water pouch within his transkin, where he
  could suck it through a tube to his mouth without the deadly exposure to the
  molds.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes after he had completed the meal, while he rested and longed
  for the impossible luxury of a cigarette, the fuzzy coat sprang suddenly to
  life on the remnants of food in the can.</p>

  <p>II</p>

  <p>An hour later, weary and thoroughly soaked in perspiration, Ham found a
  Friendly tree, so named by the explorer Burlingame because it is one of the
  few organisms on Venus sluggish enough to permit one to rest in its branches.
  So Ham climbed it, found the most comfortable position available, and slept
  as best he could.</p>

  <p>It was five hours by his wrist watch before he awoke, and the tendrils and
  little sucking cups of the Friendly tree were fastened all over his transkin.
  He tore them away very carefully, climbed down, and trudged westward.</p>

  <p>It was after the second rain that he met the doughpot, as the creature is
  called in British and American Venus. In the French strip, it's the pot
  &agrave; colle, the "paste pot;" in the Dutch&mdash;well, the Dutch are not
  prudish, and they call the horror just what they think it warrants.</p>

  <p>Actually, the doughpot is a nauseous creature. It's a mass of white,
  dough-like protoplasm, ranging in size from a single cell to perhaps twenty
  tons of mushy filth. It has no fixed form; in fact, it's merely a mass of de
  Proust cells&mdash;in effect, a disembodied, crawling, hungry cancer.</p>

  <p>It has no organization and no intelligence, nor even any instinct save
  hunger. It moves in whatever direction food touches its surfaces; when it
  touches two edible substances, it quietly divides, with the larger portion
  invariably attacking the greater supply.</p>

  <p>It's invulnerable to bullets; nothing less than the terrific blast of a
  flame-pistol will kill it, and then only if the blast destroys every
  individual cell. It travels over the ground absorbing everything, leaving
  bare black soil where the ubiquitous molds spring up at once&mdash;a noisome,
  nightmarish creature.</p>

  <p>Ham sprang aside as the doughpot erupted suddenly from the jungle to his
  right. It couldn't absorb the transkin, of course, but to be caught in that
  mess meant quick suffocation. He glared at it disgustedly and was sorely
  tempted to blast it with his flame-pistol as it slithered past at running
  speed. He would have, too, but the experienced Venusian frontiersman is very
  careful with the flame-pistol.</p>

  <p>It has to be charged with a diamond, a cheap black one, of course, but
  still an item to consider. The crystal, when fired, gives up all its energy
  in one terrific blast that roars out like a lightning stroke for a hundred
  yards, incinerating everything in its path.</p>

  <p>The thing rolled by with a sucking and gulping sound. Behind it opened the
  passage it had cleared; creepers, snake vines, Jack Ketch trees&mdash;
  everything had been swept away down to the humid earth itself, where already
  the molds were springing up on the slime of the doughpot's trail.</p>

  <p>The alley led nearly in the direction Ham wanted to travel; he seized the
  opportunity and strode briskly along, with a wary eye, nevertheless, on the
  ominous walls of jungle. In ten hours or so the opening would be filled once
  more with unpleasant life, but for the present it offered a much quicker
  progress than dodging from one clearing to the next.</p>

  <p>It was five miles up the trail, which was already beginning to sprout
  inconveniently, that he met the native galloping along on his four short
  legs, his pincerlike hands shearing a path for him. Ham stopped for a
  palaver.</p>

  <p>"Murra," he said.</p>

  <p>The language of the natives of the equatorial regions of the Hotlands is a
  queer one. It has, perhaps, two hundred words, but when a trader has learned
  those two hundred, his knowledge of the tongue is but little greater than the
  man who knows none at all.</p>

  <p>The words are generalized, and each sound has anywhere from a dozen to a
  hundred meanings. Murra, for instance, is a word of greeting; it may mean
  something much like "hello," or "good morning." It also may convey a
  challenge&mdash;"on guard!" It means besides, "Let's be friends," and also,
  strangely, "Let's fight this out."</p>

  <p>It has, moreover, certain noun senses; it means peace, it means war, it
  means courage, and, again, fear. A subtle language; it is only recently that
  studies of inflection have begun to reveal its nature to human philologists.
  Yet, after all, perhaps English, with its "to," "too," and "two," its "one,"
  "won," "wan," "wen," "win," "when," and a dozen other similarities, might
  seem just as strange to Venusian ears, untrained in vowel distinctions.</p>

  <p>Moreover, humans can't read the expressions of the broad, flat, three-
  eyed Venusian faces, which in the nature of things must convey a world of
  information among the natives themselves.</p>

  <p>But this one accepted the intended sense. "Murra," he responded, pausing.
  "Usk?" That was, among other things, "Who are you?" or "Where did you come
  from?" or "Where are you bound?"</p>

  <p>Ham chose the latter sense. He pointed off into the dim west, then raised
  his hand in an arc to indicate the mountains. "Erotia," he said. That had but
  one meaning, at least.</p>

  <p>The native considered this in silence. At last he grunted and volunteered
  some information. He swept his cutting claw in a gesture west along the
  trail. "Curky," he said, and then, "Murra." The last was farewell; Ham
  pressed against the wriggling jungle wall to permit him to pass.</p>

  <p>Curky meant, together with twenty other senses, trader. It was the word
  usually applied to humans, and Ham felt a pleasant anticipation in the
  prospect of human company. It had been six months since he had heard a human
  voice other than that on the tiny radio now sunk with his shack.</p>

  <p>True enough, five miles along the doughpot's trail Ham emerged suddenly in
  an area where there had been a recent mudspout. The vegetation was only
  waist-high, and across the quarter-mile clearing he saw a structure, a
  trading hut. But far more pretentious than his own iron-walled cubicle; this
  one boasted three rooms, an unheard-of luxury in the Hotlands, where every
  ounce had to be laboriously transported by rocket from one of the
  settlements. That was expensive, almost prohibitive. Traders took a real
  gamble, and Ham knew he was lucky to have come out so profitably.</p>

  <p>He strode over the still spongy ground. The windows were shaded against
  the eternal daylight, and the door&mdash;the door was locked. This was a
  violation of the frontier code. One always left doors unlocked; it might mean
  the salvation of some strayed trader, and not even the most dishonorable
  would steal from a hut left open for his safety.</p>

  <p>Nor would the natives; no creature is as honest as a Venusian native, who
  never lies and never steals, though he might, after due warning, kill a
  trader for his trade goods. But only after a fair warning.</p>

  <p>Ham stood puzzled. At last he kicked and tramped a clear space before the
  door, sat down against it, and fell to snapping away the numerous and
  loathsome little creatures that swarmed over his transkin. He waited.</p>

  <p>It wasn't half an hour before he saw the trader plowing through the
  clearing&mdash;a short, slim fellow; the transkin shaded his face, but Ham
  could make out large, shadowed eyes. He stood up.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said jovially. "Thought I'd drop in for a visit. My name's
  Hamilton Hammond&mdash;you guess the nickname!"</p>

  <p>The newcomer stopped short, then spoke in a curiously soft and husky
  voice, with a decidedly English accent. "My guess would be 'Boiled Pork,' I
  fancy." The tones were cold, unfriendly. "Suppose you step aside and let me
  in. Good day!"</p>

  <p>Ham felt anger and amazement. "The devil!" he snapped. "You're a
  hospitable sort, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not at all." The other paused at the door. "You're an American. What
  are you doing on British soil? Have you a passport?"</p>

  <p>"Since when do you need a passport in the Hotlands?"</p>

  <p>"Trading, aren't you?" the slim man said sharply. "In other words,
  poaching. You've no rights here. Get on."</p>

  <p>Ham's jaw set stubbornly behind his mask. "Rights or none," he said, "I'm
  entitled to the consideration of the frontier code. I want a breath of air
  and a chance to wipe my face, and also a chance to eat. If you open that door
  I'm coming in after you."</p>

  <p>An automatic flashed into view. "Do, and you'll feed the molds."</p>

  <p>Ham, like all Venusian traders, was of necessity bold, resourceful, and
  what is called in the States "hard-boiled." He didn't flinch, but said in
  apparent yielding:</p>

  <p>"All right; but listen, all I want is a chance to eat."</p>

  <p>"Wait for a rain," said the other coolly and half turned to unlock the
  door.</p>

  <p>As his eyes shifted, Ham kicked at the revolver; it went spinning against
  the wall and dropped into the weeds. His opponent snatched for the
  flame-pistol that still dangled on his hip; Ham caught his wrist in a mighty
  clutch.</p>

  <p>Instantly the other ceased to struggle, while Ham felt a momentary
  surprise at the skinny feel of the wrist through its transkin covering.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he growled. "I want a chance to eat, and I'm going to get it.
  Unlock that door!"</p>

  <p>He had both wrists now; the fellow seemed curiously delicate. After a
  moment he nodded, and Ham released one hand. The door opened, and he followed
  the other in.</p>

  <p>Again, unheard-of magnificence. Solid chairs, a sturdy table, even books,
  carefully preserved, no doubt, by lycopodium against the ravenous molds that
  sometimes entered Hotland shacks in spite of screen filters and automatic
  spray. An automatic spray was going now to destroy any spores that might have
  entered with the opening door.</p>

  <p>Ham sat down, keeping an eye on the other, whose flame-pistol he had
  permitted to remain in its holster. He was confident of his ability to
  outdraw the slim individual, and, besides, who'd risk firing a flame-pistol
  indoors? It would simply blow out one wall of the building.</p>

  <p>So he set about opening his mask, removing food from his pack, wiping his
  steaming face, while his companion&mdash;or opponent&mdash;looked on
  silently. Ham watched the canned meat for a moment; no molds appeared, and he
  ate.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil," he rasped, "don't you open your visor?" At the other's
  silence, he continued: "Afraid I'll see your face, eh? Well, I'm not
  interested; I'm no cop."</p>

  <p>No reply.</p>

  <p>He tried again. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>The cool voice sounded: "Burlingame. Pat Burlingame."</p>

  <p>Ham laughed. "Patrick Burlingame is dead, my friend. I knew him." No
  answer. "And if you don't want to tell your name, at least you needn't insult
  the memory of a brave man and a great explorer."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." The voice was sardonic. "He was my father."</p>

  <p>"Another lie. He had no son. He had only a&mdash;" Ham paused abruptly; a
  feeling of consternation swept over him. "Open your visor!" he yelled.</p>

  <p>He saw the lips of the other, dim through the transkin, twitch into a
  sarcastic smile.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said the soft voice, and the mask dropped.</p>

  <p>Ham gulped; behind the covering were the delicately modeled features of a
  girl, with cool gray eyes in a face lovely despite the glistening
  perspiration on cheeks and forehead.</p>

  <p>The man gulped again. After all, he was a gentleman despite his profession
  as one of the fierce, adventurous traders of Venus. He was
  university-educated&mdash;an engineer&mdash;and only the lure of quick wealth
  had brought him to the Hotlands.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"You brave American poachers!" she sneered. "Are all of you so valiant as
  to force yourselves on women?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how could I know? What are you doing in a place like this?"</p>

  <p>"There's no reason for me to answer your questions, but"&mdash;she
  gestured toward the room beyond&mdash;"I'm classifying Hotland flora and
  fauna. I'm Patricia Burlingame, biologist."</p>

  <p>He perceived now the jar-enclosed specimens of a laboratory in the next
  chamber. "But a girl alone in the Hotlands! It's&mdash;it's reckless!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect to meet any American poachers," she retorted.</p>

  <p>He flushed. "You needn't worry about me. I'm going." He raised his hands
  to his visor.</p>

  <p>Instantly Patricia snatched an automatic from the table drawer. "You're
  going, indeed, Mr. Hamilton Hammond," she said coolly. "But you're leaving
  your xixtchil with me. It's crown property; you've stolen it from British
  territory, and I'm confiscating it."</p>

  <p>He stared. "Look here!" he blazed suddenly. "I've risked all I have for
  that xixtchil. If I lose it I'm ruined&mdash;busted. I'm not giving it
  up!"</p>

  <p>"But you are."</p>

  <p>He dropped his mask and sat down. "Miss Burlingame," he said, "I don't
  think you've nerve enough to shoot me, but that's what you'll have to do to
  get it. Otherwise I'll sit here until you drop of exhaustion."</p>

  <p>Her gray eyes bored silently into his blue ones. The gun held steadily on
  his heart, but spat no bullet. It was a deadlock.</p>

  <p>At last the girl said, "You win, poacher." She slapped the gun into her
  empty holster. "Get out, then."</p>

  <p>"Gladly!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>He rose, fingered his visor, then dropped it again at a sudden startled
  scream from the girl. He whirled, suspecting a trick, but she was staring out
  of the window with wide, apprehensive eyes.</p>

  <p>Ham saw the writhing of vegetation and then a vast whitish mass. A
  doughpot&mdash;a monstrous one, bearing steadily toward their shelter. He
  heard the gentle clunk of impact, and then the window was blotted out by the
  pasty mess, as the creature, not quite large enough to engulf the building,
  split into two masses that flowed around and merged on the other side.
  Another cry from Patricia. "Your mask, fool!" she rasped. "Close it!"</p>

  <p>"Mask? Why?" Nevertheless, he obeyed automatically.</p>

  <p>"Why? That's why! The digestive acids&mdash;look!" She pointed at the
  walls; indeed, thousands of tiny pinholes of light were appearing. The
  digestive acids of the monstrosity, powerful enough to attack whatever food
  chance brought, had corroded the metal; it was porous; the shack was ruined.
  He gasped as fuzzy molds shot instantly from the remains of his meal, and a
  red-and-green fur sprouted from the wood of chairs and table.</p>

  <p>The two faced each other.</p>

  <p>Ham chuckled. "Well," he said, "you're homeless, too. Mine went down in a
  mudspout."</p>

  <p>"Yours would!" Patricia retorted acidly. "You Yankees couldn't think of
  finding shallow soil, I suppose. Bed rock is just six feet below here, and my
  place is on pylons."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're a cool devil! Anyway, your place might as well be sunk. What
  are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Do? Don't concern yourself. I'm quite able to manage."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"It's no affair of yours, but I have a rocket call each month."</p>

  <p>"You must be a millionaire, then," he commented. "The Royal Society," she
  said coldly, "is financing this expedition. The rocket is due&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused; Ham thought she paled a little behind her mask.</p>

  <p>"Due when?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;it just came two days ago. I'd forgotten."</p>

  <p>"I see. And you think you'll just stick around for a month waiting for it.
  Is that it?"</p>

  <p>Patricia stared at him defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he resumed, "what you'd be in a month? It's ten days to
  summer and look at your shack." He gestured at the walls, where brown and
  rusty patches were forming; at his motion a piece the size of a saucer
  tumbled in with a crackle. "In two days this thing will be a caved-in ruin.
  What'll you do during fifteen days of summer? What'll you do without shelter
  when the temperature reaches a hundred and fifty&mdash;a hundred and sixty?
  I'll tell you&mdash;you'll die." She said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You'll be a fuzzy mass of molds before the rocket returns," Ham said.
  "And then a pile of clean bones that will go down with the first
  mudspout."</p>

  <p>"Be still!" she blazed.</p>

  <p>"Silence won't help. Now I'll tell you what you can do. You can take your
  pack and your mudshoes and walk along with me. We may make the Cool Country
  before summer&mdash;if you can walk as well as you talk."</p>

  <p>"Go with a Yankee poacher? I fancy not!"</p>

  <p>"And then," he continued imperturbably, "we can cross comfortably to
  Erotia, a good American town."</p>

  <p>Patricia reached for her emergency pack, slung it over her shoulders. She
  retrieved a thick bundle of notes, written in aniline ink on transkin,
  brushed off a few vagrant molds, and slipped it into the pack. She picked up
  a pair of diminutive mudshoes and turned deliberately to the door.</p>

  <p>"So you're coming?" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I'm going," she retorted coldly, "to the good British town of Venoble.
  Alone!"</p>

  <p>"Venoble!" he gasped. "That's two hundred miles south! And across the
  Greater Eternities, too!"</p>

  <p>III.</p>

  <p>Patricia walked silently out of the door and turned west toward the Cool
  Country. Ham hesitated a moment, then followed. He couldn't permit the girl
  to attempt that journey alone; since she ignored his presence, he simply
  trailed a few steps behind her, plodding grimly and angrily along.</p>

  <p>For three hours or more they trudged through the endless daylight, dodging
  the thrusts of the Jack Ketch trees, but mostly following the still fairly
  open trail of the first doughpot.</p>

  <p>Ham was amazed at the agile and lithe grace of the girl, who slipped along
  the way with the sure skill of a native. Then a memory came to him; she was a
  native, in a sense. He recalled now that Patrick Burlingame's daughter was
  the first human child born on Venus, in the colony of Venoble, founded by her
  father.</p>

  <p>Ham remembered the newspaper articles when she had been sent to Earth to
  be educated, a child of eight; he had been thirteen then. He was twenty-seven
  now, which made Patricia Burlingame twenty-two.</p>

  <p>Not a word passed between them until at last the girl swung about in
  exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Go away," she blazed.</p>

  <p>Ham halted. "I'm not bothering you."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want a bodyguard. I'm a better Hotlander than you!"</p>

  <p>He didn't argue the point. He kept silent, and after a moment she
  flashed:</p>

  <p>"I hate you, Yankee! Lord, how I hate you!" She turned and trudged on.</p>

  <p>An hour later the mudspout caught them. Without warning, watery muck
  boiled up around their feet, and the vegetation swayed wildly. Hastily, they
  strapped on their mudshoes, while the heavier plants sank with sullen gurgles
  around them. Again Ham marveled at the girl's skill; Patricia slipped away
  across the unstable surface with a speed he could not match, and he shuffled
  far behind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he saw her stop. That was dangerous in a mudspout; only an
  emergency could explain it. He hurried; a hundred feet away he perceived the
  reason. A strap had broken on her right shoe, and she stood helpless,
  balancing on her left foot, while the remaining bowl was sinking slowly. Even
  now black mud slopped over the edge.</p>

  <p>She eyed him as he approached. He shuffled to her side; as she saw his
  intention, she spoke.</p>

  <p>"You can't," she said.</p>

  <p>Ham bent cautiously, slipping his arms about her knees and shoulders. Her
  mudshoes was already embedded, but he heaved mightily, driving the rims of
  his own dangerously close to the surface. With a great sucking gulp, she came
  free and lay very still in his arms, so as not to unbalance him as he slid
  again into careful motion over the treacherous surface. She was not heavy,
  but it was a hairbreadth chance, and the mud slipped and gurgled at the very
  edge of his shoe-bowls. Even though Venus has slightly less surface
  gravitation than Earth, a week or so gets one accustomed to it, and the
  twenty per cent advantage in weight seems to disappear.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards brought firm footing. He sat her down and unstrapped her
  mudshoes.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said coolly. "That was brave."</p>

  <p>"You're welcome," he returned dryly. "I suppose this will end any idea of
  your traveling alone. Without both mudshoes, the next spout will be the last
  for you. Do we walk together now?"</p>

  <p>Her voice chilled. "I can make a substitute shoe from tree skin."</p>

  <p>"Not even a native could walk on tree skin."</p>

  <p>"Then," she said, "I'll simply wait a day or two for the mud to dry and
  dig up my lost one."</p>

  <p>He laughed and gestured at the acres of mud. "Dig where?" he countered.
  "You'll be here till summer if you try that."</p>

  <p>She yielded. "You win again, Yankee. But only to the Cool Country; then
  you'll go north and I south."</p>

  <p>They trudged on. Patricia was as tireless as Ham himself and was vastly
  more adept in Hotland lore. Though they spoke but little, he never ceased to
  wonder at the skill she had in picking the quickest route, and she seemed to
  sense the thrusts of the Jack Ketch trees without looking. But it was when
  they halted at last, after a rain had given opportunity for a hasty meal,
  that he had real cause to thank her.</p>

  <p>"Sleep?" he suggested, and as she nodded: "There's a Friendly tree."</p>

  <p>He moved toward it, the girl behind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she seized his arm. "It's a Pharisee!" she cried, jerking him
  back.</p>

  <p>None too soon! The false Friendly tree had lashed down with a terrible
  stroke that missed his face by inches. It was no Friendly tree at all, but an
  imitator, luring prey within reach by its apparent harmlessness, then
  striking with knife-sharp spikes.</p>

  <p>Ham gasped. "What is it? I never saw one of those before."</p>

  <p>"A Pharisee! It just looks like a Friendly tree."</p>

  <p>She took out her automatic and sent a bullet into the black, pulsing
  trunk. A dark stream gushed, and the ubiquitous molds sprang into life about
  the hole. The tree was doomed.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Ham awkwardly. "I guess you saved my life."</p>

  <p>"We're quits now." She gazed levelly at him. "Understand? We're even."</p>

  <p>Later they found a true Friendly tree and slept. Awakening, they trudged
  on again, and slept again, and so on for three nightless days. No more
  mudspouts burst about them, but all the other horrors of the Hotlands were
  well in evidence. Doughpots crossed their path, snake vines hissed and
  struck, the Jack Ketch trees flung sinister nooses, and a million little
  crawling things writhed underfoot or dropped upon their suits.</p>

  <p>Once they encountered a uniped, that queer, kangaroolike creature that
  leaps, crashing through the jungle on a single mighty leg, and trusts to its
  ten-foot beak to spear its prey.</p>

  <p>When Ham missed his first shot, the girl brought it down in mid-leap to
  thresh into the avid clutches of the Jack Ketch trees and the merciless
  molds.</p>

  <p>On another occasion, Patricia had both feet caught in a Jack Ketch noose
  that lay for some unknown cause on the ground. As she stepped within it, the
  tree jerked her suddenly, to dangle head down a dozen feet in the air, and
  she hung helplessly until Ham managed to cut her free. Beyond doubt, either
  would have died alone on any of several occasions; together they pulled
  through.</p>

  <p>Yet neither relaxed the cool, unfriendly attitude that had become
  habitual. Ham never addressed the girl unless necessary, and she in the rare
  instances when they spoke, called him always by no other name than Yankee
  poacher. In spite of this, the man found himself sometimes remembering the
  piquant loveliness of her features, her brown hair and level gray eyes, as he
  had glimpsed them in the brief moments when rain made it safe to open their
  visors.</p>

  <p>At last one day a wind stirred out of the west, bringing with it a breath
  of coolness that was like the air of heaven to them. It was the underwind,
  the wind that blew from the frozen half of the planet, that breathed cold
  from beyond the ice barrier. When Ham experimentally shaved the skin from a
  writhing weed, the molds sprang out more slowly and with encouraging
  sparseness; they were approaching the Cool Country.</p>

  <p>They found a Friendly tree with lightened hearts; another day's trek might
  bring them to the uplands where one could walk unhooded, in safety from the
  molds, since these could not sprout in a temperature much below eighty.</p>

  <p>Ham woke first. For a while he gazed silently across at the girl, smiling
  at the way the branches of the tree had encircled her like affectionate arms.
  They were merely hungry, of course, but it looked like tenderness. His smile
  turned a little sad as he realized that the Cool Country meant parting,
  unless he could discourage that insane determination of hers to cross the
  Greater Eternities.</p>

  <p>He sighed, and reached for his pack slung on a branch between them, and
  suddenly a bellow of rage and astonishment broke from him.</p>

  <p>His xixtchil pods! The transkin pouch was slit; they were gone.</p>

  <p>Patricia woke startled at his cry. Then, behind her mask, he sensed an
  ironic, mocking smile.</p>

  <p>"My xixtchil!" he roared. "Where is it?"</p>

  <p>She pointed down. There among the lesser growths was a little mound of
  molds.</p>

  <p>"There," she said coolly. "Down there, poacher."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;" He choked with rage.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I slit the pouch while you slept. You'll smuggle no stolen wealth
  from British territory."</p>

  <p>Ham was white, speechless. "You damned devil!" he bellowed at last.
  "That's every cent I had!"</p>

  <p>"But stolen," she reminded him pleasantly, swinging her dainty feet.</p>

  <p>Rage actually made him tremble. He glared at her; the light struck through
  the translucent transkin, outlining her body and slim rounded legs in shadow.
  "I ought to kill you!" he muttered tensely.</p>

  <p>His hand twitched, and the girl laughed softly. With a groan of
  desperation, he slung his pack over his shoulders and dropped to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"I hope&mdash;I hope you die in the mountains," he said grimly, and
  stalked away toward the west.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards distant he heard her voice.</p>

  <p>"Yankee! Wait a moment!"</p>

  <p>He neither paused nor glanced back, but strode on.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, glancing back from the crest of a rise, Ham perceived
  that she was following him. He turned and hurried on. The way was upward now,
  and his strength began to outweigh her speed and skill.</p>

  <p>When next he glimpsed her, she was a plodding speck far behind, moving, he
  imagined, with a weary doggedness. He frowned back at her; it had occurred to
  him that a mudspout would find her completely helpless, lacking the vitally
  important mudshoes.</p>

  <p>Then he realized that they were beyond the region of mudspouts, here in
  the foothills of the Mountains of Eternity, and anyway, he decided grimly, he
  didn't care.</p>

  <p>For a while Ham paralleled a river, doubtless an unnamed tributary of the
  Phlegethon. So far there had been no necessity to cross watercourses, since
  naturally all streams on Venus flow from the ice barrier across the twilight
  zone to the hot side, and therefore, had coincided with their own
  direction.</p>

  <p>But now, once he attained the tablelands and turned north, he would
  encounter rivers. They had to be crossed either on logs or, if opportunity
  offered and the stream was narrow, through the branches of Friendly trees. To
  set foot in the water was death; fierce fanged creatures haunted the
  streams.</p>

  <p>He had one near catastrophe at the rim of the tableland. It was while he
  edged through a Jack Ketch clearing; suddenly there was a heave of white
  corruption, and tree and jungle wall disappeared in the mass of a gigantic
  doughpot.</p>

  <p>He was cornered between the monster and an impenetrable tangle of
  vegetation, so he did the only thing left to do. He snatched his flame-pistol
  and sent a terrific, roaring blast into the horror, a blast that incinerated
  tons of pasty filth and left a few small fragments crawling and feeding on
  the debris.</p>

  <p>The blast also, as it usually does, shattered the barrel of the weapon. He
  sighed as he set about the forty-minute job of replacing it&mdash;no true
  Hotlander ever delays that&mdash;for the blast had cost fifteen good American
  dollars, ten for the cheap diamond that had exploded, and five for the
  barrel. Nothing at all when he had had his xixtchil, but a real item now. He
  sighed again as he discovered that the remaining barrel was his last; he had
  been forced to economize on everything when he set out.</p>

  <p>Ham came at last to the table-land. The fierce and predatory vegetation of
  the Hotlands grew scarce; he began to encounter true plants, with no power of
  movement, and the underwind blew cool in his face.</p>

  <p>He was in a sort of high valley; to his right were the gray peaks of the
  Lesser Eternities, beyond which lay Erotia, and to his left, like a mighty,
  glittering rampart, lay the vast slopes of the Greater Range, whose peaks
  were lost in the clouds fifteen miles above.</p>

  <p>He looked at the opening of the rugged Madman's Pass where it separated
  two colossal peaks; the pass itself was twenty-five thousand feet in height,
  but the mountains out-topped it by fifty thousand more. One man had crossed
  that jagged crack on foot&mdash;Patrick Burlingame&mdash;and that was the way
  his daughter meant to follow.</p>

  <p>Ahead, visible as a curtain of shadow, lay the night edge of the twilight
  zone, and Ham could see the incessant lightnings that flashed forever in this
  region of endless storms. It was here that the ice barrier crossed the ranges
  of the Mountains of Eternity, and the cold underwind, thrust up by the mighty
  range, met the warm upper winds in a struggle that was one continuous storm,
  such a storm as only Venus could provide. The river Phlegethon had its source
  somewhere back in there.</p>

  <p>Ham surveyed the wildly magnificent panorama. Tomorrow, or rather, after
  resting, he would turn north. Patricia would turn south, and, beyond doubt,
  would die somewhere on Madman's Pass. For a moment he had a queerly painful
  sensation, then he frowned bitterly.</p>

  <p>Let her die, if she was fool enough to attempt the pass alone just because
  she was too proud to take a rocket from an American settlement. She deserved
  it. He didn't care; he was still assuring himself of that as he prepared to
  sleep, not in a Friendly tree, but in one of the far more friendly specimens
  of true vegetation and in the luxury of an open visor.</p>

  <p>The sound of his name awakened him. He gazed across the table-land to see
  Patricia just topping the divide, and he felt a moment's wonder at how she
  managed to trail him, a difficult feat indeed in a country where the living
  vegetation writhes instantly back across one's path. Then he recalled the
  blast of his flame-pistol; the flash and sound would carry for miles, and she
  must have heard or seen it.</p>

  <p>Ham saw her glancing anxiously around.</p>

  <p>"Ham!" she snouted again&mdash;not Yankee or poacher, but "Ham!"</p>

  <p>He kept a sullen silence; again she called. He could see her bronzed and
  piquant features now; she had dropped her transkin hood. She called again;
  with a despondent little shrug, she turned south along the divide, and he
  watched her go in grim silence. When the forest hid her from view, he
  descended and turned slowly north.</p>

  <p>Very slowly; his steps lagged; it was as if he tugged against some
  invisible elastic bond. He kept seeing her anxious face and hearing in memory
  the despondent call. She was going to her death, he believed, and, after all,
  despite what she had done to him, he didn't want that. She was too full of
  life, too confident, too young, and above all, too lovely to die.</p>

  <p>True, she was an arrogant, vicious, self-centered devil, cool as crystal,
  and as unfriendly, but&mdash;she had gray eyes and brown hair, and she was
  courageous. And at last, with a groan of exasperation, he halted his lagging
  steps, turned, and rushed with almost eager speed into the south.</p>

  <p>Trailing the girl was easy here for one trained in the Hotlands. The
  vegetation was slow to mend itself, here in the Cool Country, and now again
  he found imprints of her feet, or broken twigs to mark her path. He found the
  place where she had crossed the river through tree branches, and he found a
  place where she had paused to eat.</p>

  <p>But he saw that she was gaining on him; her skill and speed outmatched
  his, and the trail grew steadily older. At last he stopped to rest; the
  table-land was beginning to curve upward toward the vast Mountains of
  Eternity, and on rising ground he knew he could overtake her. So he slept for
  a while in the luxurious comfort of no transkin at all, just the shorts and
  shirt that one wore beneath. That was safe here; the eternal underwind,
  blowing always toward the Hotlands, kept drifting mold spores away, and any
  brought in on the fur of animals died quickly at the first cool breeze. Nor
  would the true plants of the Cool Country attack his flesh.</p>

  <p>He slept five hours. The next "day" of traveling brought another change in
  the country. The life of the foothills was sparse compared to the table-
  lands; the vegetation was no longer a jungle, but a forest, an unearthly
  forest, true, of treelike growths whose boles rose five hundred feet and then
  spread, not into foliage, but flowery appendages. Only an occasional Jack
  Ketch tree reminded him of the Hotlands.</p>

  <p>Farther on, the forest diminished. Great rock outcroppings appeared, and
  vast red cliffs with no growths of any kind. Now and then he encountered
  swarms of the planet's only aerial creatures, the gray, mothlike dusters,
  large as hawks, but so fragile that a blow shattered them. They darted about,
  alighting at times to seize small squirming things, and tinkling in their
  curiously bell-like voices. And apparently almost above him, though really
  thirty miles distant, loomed the Mountains of Eternity, their peaks lost in
  the clouds that swirled fifteen miles overhead.</p>

  <p>Here again it grew difficult to trail, since Patricia scrambled often over
  bare rock. But little by little the signs grew fresher; once again his
  greater strength began to tell. And then he glimpsed her, at the base of a
  colossal escarpment split by a narrow, tree-filled canyon.</p>

  <p>She was peering first at the mighty precipice, then at the cleft,
  obviously wondering whether it offered a means of scaling the barrier, or
  whether it was necessary to circle the obstacle. Like himself, she had
  discarded her transkin and wore the usual shirt and shorts of the Cool
  Country, which, after all, is not very cool by terrestrial standards. She
  looked, he thought, like some lovely forest nymph of the ancient slopes of
  Pelion.</p>

  <p>He hurried as she moved into the canyon. "Pat!" he shouted; it was the
  first time he had spoken her given name. A hundred feet within the passage he
  overtook her.</p>

  <p>"You!" she gasped. She looked tired; she had been hurrying for hours, but
  a light of eagerness flashed in her eyes. "I thought you had&mdash;I tried to
  find you."</p>

  <p>Ham's face held no responsive light. "Listen here, Pat Burlingame," he
  said coldly. "You don't deserve any consideration, but I can't see you
  walking into death. You're a stubborn devil but you're a woman. I'm taking
  you to Erotia."</p>

  <p>The eagerness vanished. "Indeed, poacher? My father crossed here. I can,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Your father crossed in midsummer, didn't he? And midsummer's to-day. You
  can't make Madman's Pass in less than five days, a hundred and twenty hours,
  and by then it will nearly winter, and this longitude will be close to the
  storm line. You're a fool."</p>

  <p>She flushed. "The pass is high enough to be in the upper winds. It will be
  warm."</p>

  <p>"Warm! Yes&mdash;warm with lightning." He paused; the faint rumble of
  thunder rolled through the canyon. "Listen to that. In five days that will be
  right over us." He gestured up at the utterly barren slopes. "Not even
  Venusian life can get a foothold up there&mdash;or do you think you've got
  brass enough to be a lightning rod? Maybe you're right."</p>

  <p>Anger flamed. "Rather the lightning than you!" Patricia snapped, and then
  as suddenly softened. "I tried to call you back," she said irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"To laugh at me," he retorted bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No. To tell you I was sorry, and that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want your apology."</p>

  <p>"But I wanted to tell you that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he said curtly. "I'm not interested in your repentance. The
  harm's done." He frowned coldly down on her.</p>

  <p>Patricia said meekly: "But I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A crashing and gurgling interrupted her, and she screamed as a gigantic
  doughpot burst into view, a colossus that filled the canyon from wall to wall
  to a six-foot height as it surged toward them. The horrors were rarer in the
  Cool Country, but larger, since the abundance of food in the Hotlands kept
  subdividing them. But this one was a giant, a behemoth, tons and tons of
  nauseous, ill-smelling corruption heaving up the narrow way. They were cut
  off.</p>

  <p>Ham snatched his flame-pistol, but the girl seized his arm.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" she cried. "Too close! It will spatter!"</p>

  <p>Patricia was right. Unprotected by transkin, the touch of a fragment of
  that monstrosity was deadly, and, beyond that, the blast of a flame-pistol
  would shower bits of it upon them. He grasped her wrist and they fled up the
  canyon, striving for vantage way enough to risk a shot. And a dozen feet
  behind surged the doughpot, traveling blindly in the only direction it could
  &mdash;the way of food.</p>

  <p>They gained. Then, abruptly, the canyon, which had been angling southwest,
  turned sharply south. The light of the eternally eastward Sun was hidden;
  they were in a pit of perpetual shadow, and the ground was bare and lifeless
  rock. And as it reached that point, the doughpot halted; lacking any
  organization, any will, it could not move when no food gave it direction. It
  was such a monster as only the life-swarming climate of Venus could harbor;
  it lived only by endless eating.</p>

  <p>The two paused in the shadow.</p>

  <p>"Now what?" muttered Ham.</p>

  <p>A fair shot at the mass was impossible because of the angle; a blast would
  destroy only the portion it could reach.</p>

  <p>Patricia leaped upward, catching a snaky shrub on the wall, so placed that
  it received a faint ray of light. She tossed it against the pulsing mass; the
  whole doughpot lunged forward a foot or two.</p>

  <p>"Lure it in," she suggested.</p>

  <p>They tried. It was impossible; vegetation was too sparse.</p>

  <p>"What will happen to the thing?" asked Ham.</p>

  <p>"I saw one stranded on the desert edge of the Hotlands," replied the girl.
  "It quivered around for a long time, and then the cells attacked each other.
  It ate itself." She shuddered. "It was&mdash;horrible!"</p>

  <p>"How long?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, forty to fifty hours."</p>

  <p>"I won't wait that long," growled Ham. He fumbled in his pack, pulling out
  his transkin.</p>

  <p>"What will you do?"</p>

  <p>"Put this on and try to blast that mass out of here at close range." He
  fingered his flame-pistol. "This is my last barrel," he said gloomily, then
  more hopefully: "But we have yours."</p>

  <p>"The chamber of mine cracked last time I used it, ten or twelve hours ago.
  But I have plenty of barrels."</p>

  <p>"Good enough!" said Ham.</p>

  <p>He crept cautiously toward the horrible, pulsating wall of white. He
  thrust his arm so as to cover the greatest angle, pulled the trigger, and the
  roar and blazing fire of the blast bellowed echoing through the canyon. Bits
  of the monster spattered around him, and the thickness of the remainder,
  lessened by the incineration of tons of filth, was now only three feet.</p>

  <p>"The barrel held!" he called triumphantly. It saved much time in
  recharging.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the weapon crashed again. When the mass of the
  monstrosity stopped heaving, only a foot and a half of depth remained, but
  the barrel had been blown to atoms.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to use yours," he said.</p>

  <p>Patricia produced one, he took it, and then stared at it in dismay. The
  barrels of her Enfield-made weapon were far too small for his American pistol
  stock!</p>

  <p>He groaned. "Of all the idiots!" he burst out.</p>

  <p>"Idiots!" she flared. "Because you Yankees use trench mortars for your
  barrels?"</p>

  <p>"I meant myself. I should have guessed this." He shrugged. "Well, we have
  our choice now of waiting here for the doughpot to eat himself, or trying to
  find some other way out of this trap. And my hunch is that this canyon's
  blind."</p>

  <p>It was probable, Patricia admitted. The narrow cleft was the product of
  some vast, ancient upheaval that had split the mountain in halves. Since it
  was not the result of water erosion, it was likely enough that the cleft
  ended abruptly in an unscalable precipice, but it was possible, too, that
  somewhere those sheer walls might be surmountable.</p>

  <p>"We've time to waste, anyway," she concluded. "We might as well try it.
  Besides&mdash;" She wrinkled her dainty nose distastefully at the doughpot's
  odor.</p>

  <p>Still in his transkin, Ham followed her through the shadowy half dusk. The
  passage narrowed, then veered west again, but now so high and sheer were the
  walls that the Sun, slightly south of east, cast no light into it. It was a
  place of shades like the region of the storm line that divides the twilight
  zone from the dark hemisphere, not true night, nor yet honest day, but a dim
  middle state.</p>

  <p>Ahead of him Patricia's bronzed limbs showed pale instead of tan, and when
  she spoke her voice went echoing queerly between the opposing cliffs. A weird
  place, this chasm, a dusky, unpleasant place.</p>

  <p>"I don't like this," said Ham. "The pass is cutting closer and closer to
  the dark. Do you realize no one knows what's in the dark parts of the
  Mountains of Eternity?"</p>

  <p>Patricia laughed; the sound was ghostly. "What danger could there be?
  Anyway, we still have our automatics."</p>

  <p>"There's no way up here," Ham grumbled. "Let's turn back."</p>

  <p>Patricia faced him. "Frightened, Yankee?" Her voice dropped. "The natives
  say these mountains are haunted," she went on mockingly. "My father told me
  he saw queer things in Madman's Pass. Do you know that if there is life on
  the night side, here is the one place it would impinge on the twilight zone?
  Here in the Mountains of Eternity?"</p>

  <p>She was taunting him; she laughed again. And suddenly her laughter was
  repeated in a hideous cacophony that hooted out from the sides of the cliffs
  above them in a horrid medley.</p>

  <p>She paled; it was Patricia who was frightened now. They stared
  apprehensively up at the rock walls where strange shadows flickered and
  shifted.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what was it?" she whispered. And then: "Ham! Did you see
  that?"</p>

  <p>Ham had seen it. A wild shape had flung itself across the strip of sky,
  leaping from cliff to cliff far above them. And again came a peal of hooting
  that sounded like laughter, while shadowy forms moved, flylike, on the sheer
  walls.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back!" she gasped. "Quickly!"</p>

  <p>As she turned, a small black object fell and broke with a sullen pop
  before them. Ham stared at it. A pod, a spore-sac, of some unknown variety. A
  lazy, dusky cloud drifted over it, and suddenly both of them were choking
  violently. Ham felt his head spinning in dizziness, and Patricia reeled
  against him.</p>

  <p>"It's narcotic!" she gasped. "Back!"</p>

  <p>But a dozen more plopped around them. The dusty spores whirled in dark
  eddies, and breathing was a torment. They were being drugged and suffocated
  at the same time.</p>

  <p>Ham had a sudden inspiration. "Mask!" he choked, and pulled his transkin
  over his face.</p>

  <p>The filter that kept out the molds of the Hotlands cleaned the air of
  these spores as well; his head cleared. But the girl's covering was somewhere
  in her pack; she was fumbling for it. Abruptly she sat down, swaying.</p>

  <p>"My pack," she murmured. "Take it out with you. Your&mdash;your&mdash;"
  She broke into a fit of coughing.</p>

  <p>He dragged her under a shallow overhang and ripped her transkin from the
  pack. "Put it on!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>A score of pods were popping.</p>

  <p>A figure flitted silently far up on the wall of rock. Ham watched its
  progress, then aimed his automatic and fired. There was a shrill, rasping
  scream, answered by a chorus of dissonant ululations, and something as large
  as a man whirled down to crash not ten feet from him.</p>

  <p>The thing was hideous. Ham stared appalled at a creature not unlike a
  native, three-eyed, two-handed, four-legged, but the hands, though
  two-fingered like the Hotlanders', were not pincerlike, but white and
  clawed.</p>

  <p>And the face! Not the broad, expressionless face of the others, but a
  slanting, malevolent, dusky visage with each eye double the size of the
  natives'. It wasn't dead; it glared hatred and seized a stone, flinging it at
  him with weak viciousness. Then it died.</p>

  <p>Ham didn't know what it was, of course. Actually it was a triops
  noctivivans&mdash;the "three-eyed dweller in the dark," the strange, semi-
  intelligent being that is as yet the only known creature of the night side,
  and a member of that fierce remnant still occasionally found in the sunless
  parts of the Mountains of Eternity. It is perhaps the most vicious creature
  in the known planets, absolutely unapproachable, and delighting in
  slaughter.</p>

  <p>At the crash of the shot, the shower of pods had ceased, and a chorus of
  laughing hoots ensued. Ham seized the respite to pull the girl's transkin
  over her face; she had collapsed with it only half on.</p>

  <p>Then a sharp crack sounded, and a stone rebounded to strike his arm.
  Others pattered around him, whining past, swift as bullets. Black figures
  flickered in great leaps against the sky, and their fierce laughter sounded
  mockingly. He fired at one in mid-air; the cry of pain rasped again, but the
  creature did not fall.</p>

  <p>Stones pelted him. They were all small ones, pebble-sized, but they were
  flung so fiercely that they hummed in passage, and they tore his flesh
  through his transkin. He turned Patricia on her face, but she moaned faintly
  as a missile struck her back. He shielded her with his own body.</p>

  <p>The position was intolerable. He must risk a dash back, even though the
  doughpot blocked the opening. Perhaps, he thought, armored in transkin he
  could wade through the creature. He knew that was an insane idea; the gluey
  mass would roll him into itself to suffocate&mdash;but it had to be faced. He
  gathered the girl in his arms and rushed suddenly down the canyon.</p>

  <p>Hoots and shrieks and a chorus of mocking laughter echoed around him.
  Stones struck him everywhere. One glanced from his head, sending him
  stumbling and staggering against the cliff. But he ran doggedly on; he knew
  now what drove him. It was the girl he carried; he had to save Patricia
  Burlingame.</p>

  <p>Ham reached the bend. Far up on the west wall glowed cloudy sunlight, and
  his weird pursuers flung themselves to the dark side. They couldn't stand
  daylight, and that gave him some assistance; by creeping very close to the
  eastern wall he was partially shielded.</p>

  <p>Ahead was the other bend, blocked by the doughpot. As he neared it, he
  turned suddenly sick. Three of the creatures were grouped against the mass of
  white, eating&mdash;actually eating!&mdash;the corruption. They whirled,
  hooting, as he came, he shot two of them, and as the third leaped for the
  wall, he dropped that one as well, and it fell with a dull gulping sound into
  the doughpot.</p>

  <p>Again he sickened; the doughpot drew away from it, leaving the thing lying
  in a hollow like the hole of a giant doughnut. Not even that monstrosity
  would eat these creatures.[1]</p>

  <p>[Footnote 1: It was not known then that while the night-side life of Venus
  can eat and digest that of the day side, the reverse is not true. No day-
  side creature can absorb the dark life because of the presence of various
  metabolic alcohols, all poisonous.]</p>

  <p>But the thing's leap had drawn Ham's attention to a twelve-inch ledge. It
  might be&mdash;yes, it was possible that he could traverse that rugged trail
  and so circle the doughpot. Nearly hopeless, no doubt, to attempt it under
  the volley of stones, but he must. There was no alternative.</p>

  <p>He shifted the girl to free his right arm. He slipped a second clip in his
  automatic and then fired at random into the flitting shadows above. For a
  moment the hail of pebbles ceased, and with a convulsive, painful struggle,
  Ham dragged himself and Patricia to the ledge.</p>

  <p>Stones cracked about him once more. Step by step he edged along the way,
  poised just over the doomed doughpot. Death below and death above! And little
  by little he rounded the bend; above him both walls glowed in sunlight, and
  they were safe.</p>

  <p>At least, he was safe. The girl might be already dead, he thought
  frantically, as he slipped and slid through the slime of the doughpot's
  passage. Out on the daylit slope he tore the mask from her face and gazed on
  white, marble-cold features.</p>

  <p>It was not death, however, but only drugged torpor. An hour later she was
  conscious, though weak and very badly frightened. Yet almost her first
  question was for her pack.</p>

  <p>"It's here," Ham said. "What's so precious about that pack? Your
  notes?"</p>

  <p>"My notes? Oh, no!" A faint flush covered her features. "It's&mdash;I kept
  trying to tell you&mdash;it's your xixtchil."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I&mdash;of course I didn't throw it to the molds. It's yours by
  rights, Ham. Lots of British traders go into the American Hotlands. I just
  slit the pouch and hid it here in my pack. The molds on the ground were only
  some twigs I threw there to&mdash;to make it look real."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>The flush deepened. "I wanted to punish you," Patricia whispered, "for
  being so&mdash;so cold and distant."</p>

  <p>"I?" Ham was amazed. "It was you!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was, at first. You forced your way into my house, you know.
  But&mdash;after you carried me across the mudspout, Ham&mdash;it was
  different."</p>

  <p>Ham gulped. Suddenly he pulled her into his arms. "I'm not going to
  quarrel about whose fault it was," he said. "But we'll settle one thing
  immediately. We're going to Erotia, and that's where we'll be married, in a
  good American church if they've put one up yet, or by a good American justice
  if they haven't. There's no more talk of Madman's Pass and crossing the
  Mountains of Eternity. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at the vast, looming peaks and shuddered. "Quite clear!" she
  replied meekly.</p>
