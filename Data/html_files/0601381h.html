<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">"YOU'LL do what I tell you&mdash;or else!" Duke
Tremayne smiled cruelly as he delivered his ultimatum. Across the
table from him Arline Ellis clenched her white hands in helpless
rage. Duke Tremayne, world adventurer, was tall, slim, darkly
mustached, handsome in a ruthless way; and many women looked on him
with favor. But Arline hated him, with as good reason as she feared
him.</p>

<p>But she ventured a flare of rebellion.</p>

<p>"I won't do it! It's too risky!"</p>

<p>"Not half as risky as defying me!" he reminded her. "I've got
you by the seat of your pretty pants, my dear. How would you like
to have me tell the police why you left Canton in such a hurry? Or
tell them <i>my</i> version of that night in Baron Takayami's
apartment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she begged. She was trembling as she glanced fearfully
about the little curtained alcove in which they sat. It was well
off the main floor of the Bordeaux Cabaret; even the music from the
native orchestra came only faintly to their ears. They were alone,
but the words he had just spoken were dynamite, not even safe for
empty walls to hear.</p>

<p>"You know I didn't kill him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you say. But who'd believe you if I swore I saw you do
it?"</p>

<p>She bent her head in defeat. This was the price she must pay for
an hour of folly. In Canton she had been indiscreet enough to visit
the apartments of a certain important Japanese official. It had
been only the harmless escapade of a thrill-hunting girl.</p>

<p>She had found more thrills than she wanted, when the official
had been murdered, almost before her eyes, by his servant, who she
was sure was a Russian spy. The murderer had fled, and so had she,
but not before she had been seen leaving the house by Duke
Tremayne, a friend of the slain official. He had kept silent. But
the murderer had taken important documents with him in his flight,
and there was hell to pay in diplomatic circles.</p>

<p>It had been an international episode, that almost set the big
guns of war roaring in the East. The murder and theft remained an
unsolved mystery to the world at large, a wound that still rankled
in the capitals of the Orient.</p>

<p>Arline had fled the city in a panic, realizing she could never
prove her innocence, if connected with the affair. Tremayne had
followed her to Shanghai and laid his cards on the table. If she
did not comply with his wishes, he'd go to the police and swear he
saw her murder the Jap. And she knew his testimony would send her
to a firing squad, for various governments were eager for a
scape-goat with which to conciliate the wrathful Nipponese.</p>

<p>Terrified, Arline submitted to the blackmail. And now Tremayne
had told her the price of his silence. It was not what she had
expected, though, from the look in his eyes as he devoured her trim
figure from blonde hair to French heels, she felt it would come to
that eventually. But here in the Bordeaux, a shady rendezvous in
the shadowy borderland between the European and the native
quarters, he had set her a task that made her flesh crawl.</p>

<p>He had commanded her to steal the famous Heart of Erlik, the
purple ruby belonging to Woon Yuen, a Chinese merchant of powerful
and sinister connections.</p>

<p>"So many men have tried," she argued. "How can I hope to
succeed? I'll be found floating in the Yangtze with my throat cut,
just as they were."</p>

<p>"You'll succeed," he retorted. "They tried force or craft; we'll
use a woman's strategy. I've learned where he keeps it&mdash;had a
spy working in his employ and he learned that much. He keeps it in
a wall safe that looks like a dragon's head, in the inner chamber
of his antique shop, where he keeps his rarest goods, and where he
never admits anybody but wealthy women collectors. He entertains
them there alone, which makes it easy."</p>

<p>"But how am I going to steal it, with him in there with me?"</p>

<p>"Easy!" he snapped. "He always serves his guests tea. You watch
your chance and drop this knock-out pill in his tea."</p>

<p>He pressed a tiny, faintly odorous sphere into her hand.</p>

<p>"He'll go out like a candle. Then you open the safe, take the
ruby and skip. It's like taking candy from a baby. One reason I
picked you for this job, you have a natural gift for unraveling
Chinese puzzles. The safe doesn't have a dial. You press the
dragon's teeth. In what combination, I don't know. That's for you
to find out."</p>

<p>"But how am I going to get into the inner chamber?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"That's the cream of the scheme," he assured her. "Did you ever
hear of Lady Elizabeth Willoughby? Well, every antique dealer in
the Orient knows her by sight or reputation. She's never been to
Shanghai, though, and I don't believe Woon Yuen ever saw her.
That'll make it easy to fool him. She's a young English woman with
exotic ideas and she spends her time wandering around the world
collecting rare Oriental art treasures. She's worth millions, and
she's a free spender.</p>

<p>"Well, you look enough like her in a general way to fit in with
any description Woon Yuen's likely to have heard. You're about the
same height, same color of hair and eyes, same kind of
figure&mdash;" his eyes lit with admiration as they dwelt on the
trim curves of bosom and hips. "And you can act, too. You can put
on an English accent that would fool the Prince of Wales, and act
the high-born lady to a queen's taste.</p>

<p>"I've seen Lady Elizabeth's cards, and before I left Canton I
had one made, to match. You see I had this in mind, even then." He
passed her a curious slip of paper-thin jade, carved with scrawling
Chinese characters.</p>

<p>"Her name, of course, in Chinese. She spends a small fortune on
cards like that, alone. Now go back to your apartment and change
into the duds I had sent up there&mdash;scarlet silk dress,
jade-green hat, slippers with ivory heels, and a jade brooch.
That's the way Lady Elizabeth always dresses. Eccentric? You said
it! Go to Woon Yuen's shop and tell him you want to see the ivory
Bon. He keeps it in the inner chamber. When you get in there, do
your stuff, but be careful! They say Woon Yuen worships that ruby,
and burns incense to it. But you'll pull the wool over his eyes,
all right. Be careful he doesn't fall for you! Couldn't blame him
if he did."</p>

<p>He was leaning toward her, and his hand was on her knee. She
flinched at the feel of his questing fingers. She loathed his
caresses, but she dared not repulse him. He was arrogantly
possessive, and she did not doubt that when&mdash;and if&mdash;she
returned with the coveted gem, he would demand the ultimate
surrender. And she knew she would not dare refuse him. Tears of
helpless misery welled to her eyes, but he ignored them. Grudgingly
he withdrew his hand and rose.</p>

<p>"Go out by the back way. When you get the ruby, meet me at room
Number 7, in the Alley of Rats&mdash;you know the place. Shanghai
will be too hot for you, and we'll have to get you out of town in a
hurry. And remember, sweetheart," his voice grew hard as his
predatory eyes, and his arm about her waist was more a threat than
a caress, "if you double-cross me, or if you flop on this job, I'll
see you stood before a Jap firing squad if it's the last thing I
do. I won't accept any excuses, either. Get me?"</p>

<p>His fingers brushed her chin, trailed over the soft white curve
of her throat, to her shoulder; and as he voiced his threat, he dug
them in like talons, emphasizing his command with a brutality that
made Arline bite her lip to keep from crying out with pain.</p>

<p>"Yes, I get you."</p>

<p>"All right. Get going." He spanked her lightly and pushed her
toward a door opposite the curtained entrance beyond which the
music blared.</p>

<p>The door opened into a long narrow alley that eventually reached
the street. As Arline went down this alley, seething with rebellion
and dismay for the task ahead of her, a man stepped from a doorway
and stopped her. She eyed him suspiciously, though concealing a
secret throb of admiration for a fine masculine figure.</p>

<p>He was big, broad-shouldered, heavy-fisted, with smoldering blue
eyes and a mop of unruly black hair under a side-tilted seaman's
cap. And he was Wild Bill Clanton, sailor, gun-runner, blackbirder,
pearl-poacher, and fighting man de luxe.</p>

<p>"Will you get out of my way?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, kid!" He barred her way with a heavy arm, and
his eyes blazed as they ran over the smooth bland curves of her
blond loveliness. "Why do you always give me the shoulder? I've
made it a point to run into you in a dozen ports, and you always
act like I had the plague."</p>

<p>"You have, as far as I'm concerned," she retorted.</p>

<p>"You seem to think Duke Tremayne's healthy," he growled
resentfully.</p>

<p>She flinched at the name of her master, but answered spiritedly:
"What I see in Duke Tremayne's none of your business. Now let me
pass!"</p>

<p>But instead he caught her arm in a grip that hurt.</p>

<p>"Damn your saucy little soul!" he ripped out, anger fighting
with fierce desire in his eyes. "If I didn't want you so bad, I'd
smack your ears back! What the hell! I'm as good a man as Duke
Tremayne. I'm tired of your superior airs. I came to Shanghai just
because I heard you were here. Now are you going to be nice, or do
I have to get rough?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare!" she exclaimed. "I'll scream&mdash;"</p>

<p>A big hand clapped over her mouth put a stop to that.</p>

<p>"Nobody interferes with anything that goes on in alleys behind
dumps like the Bordeaux," he growled, imprisoning her arms and
lifting her off her feet, kicking and struggling. "Any woman caught
here's fair prey."</p>

<p>He kicked open the door through which he had reached the alley,
and carried Arline into a dim hallway. Traversing this with his
writhing captive, he shoved open a door that opened on it. Arline,
crushed against his broad breast, felt the tumultuous pounding of
his heart, and experienced a momentary thrill of vanity that she
should rouse such stormy emotion in Wild Bill Clanton, whose
exploits with the women of a hundred ports were as widely
celebrated as his myriad bloody battles with men.</p>

<p>He entered a bare, cobwebby room, and set her on her feet,
placing his back against the door.</p>

<p>"Let me out of here, you beast!" She kicked his shins
vigorously.</p>

<p>He ignored her attack.</p>

<p>"Why don't you be nice?" he begged. "I don't want to be rough
with you. Honest, kid, I'd be good to you&mdash;better than
Tremayne probably is&mdash;"</p>

<p>For answer she bent her blonde head and bit his wrist viciously,
even though discretion warned her it was probably the worst thing
she could do.</p>

<p>"You little devil!" he swore, grabbing her. "That settles
it!"</p>

<p>Scornful of her resistance he crushed her writhing figure
against his chest, and kissed her red lips, her furious eyes, her
flaming cheeks and white throat, until she lay panting and
breathless, unable to repel the possessive arms that drew her
closer and closer.</p>

<p>She squirmed and moaned with mingled emotions as he sank his
head, eagerly as a thirsty man bending to drink, and pressed his
burning lips to the tender hollow of her throat. One hand wandered
lower, to her waist, locked her against him despite her
struggles.</p>

<p>In a sort of daze she found herself on the dingy cot, with her
skirt bunched about her hips. The gleam of her own white flesh, so
generously exposed, brought her to her senses, out of the maze of
surrender into which his strength was forcing her. Her agile mind
worked swiftly. As she sank back, suddenly she shrieked
convulsively.</p>

<p>"My back! Something's stabbed me! A knife in the
mattress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the hell?" He snatched her up instantly and whirled her
about, but she had her hands pressed over the small of her back,
and was writhing and moaning in well-simulated pain.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, kid&mdash;" he began tearing the mattress to pieces,
trying to find what had hurt her, and as he turned his back, she
snatched a heavy pitcher from the wash-stand and smashed it over
his head.</p>

<p>Not even Wild Bill Clanton could stand up under a clout like
that. He went down like a pole-axed ox&mdash;or bull,
rather&mdash;and she darted through the door and down the hall.
Behind her she heard a furious roar that lent wings to her small
high heels. She sprang into the alley and ran up it, not stopping
to arrange her garments.</p>

<p>As she emerged into the street, a backward glance showed her
Clanton reeling out into the alley, streaming blood, a raging and
formidable figure. But she was on a semi-respectable street, with
people strolling past and Sikh policemen within call. He wouldn't
dare come out of the alley after her. She walked sedately away,
arranging her dress as she went. A few loungers had seen her run
from the alley, but they merely smiled in quiet amusement and made
no comment. It was no novelty in that quarter to see a girl run
from a back alley with her breasts exposed and her skirt pulled
awry.</p>

<p>But a few deft touches smoothed out her appearance, and a moment
later, looking cool, unruffled and demure as though she had just
stepped out of a beauty shop, she was headed for her apartment,
where waited the garments she must don for her dangerous
masquerade.</p>

<p><br>
An hour later she entered the famous antique shop of Woon Yuen,
which rose in the midst of a squalid native quarter like a cluster
of jewels in a litter of garbage. Outside it was unpretentious, but
inside, even in the main chamber with its display intended to catch
the fancy of tourists and casual collectors, the shop was a
colorful riot of rich artistry.</p>

<p>A treasure trove in jade, gold, and ivory was openly exhibited,
apparently unguarded. But the inhabitants of the quarter were not
fooled by appearances. Not one would dare to try to rob Woon Yuen.
Arline fought down a chill of fear.</p>

<p>A cat-footed Chinese bowed before her, hands concealed in his
wide silken sleeves. She eyed him with the languid indifference of
an aristocrat, and said, with an accent any Briton would have sworn
she was born with: "Tell Woon Yuen that Lady Elizabeth Willoughby
wishes to see the ivory Bon." The slant eyes of the impassive
Chinese widened just a trifle at the name. With an even lower bow,
he took the fragment of jade with the Chinese characters, and
kowtowed her into an ebony chair with dragon-claw feet, before he
disappeared through the folds of a great dark velvet tapestry which
curtained the back of the shop.</p>

<p>She sat there, glancing indifferently about her, according to
her role. Lady Elizabeth would not be expected to show any interest
in the trifles displayed for the general public. She believed she
was being spied on through some peephole. Woon Yuen was a
mysterious figure, suspected of strange activities, but so far
untouchable, either by his many enemies or by the authorities. When
he came, it was so silently that he was standing before her before
she was aware of his entrance. She glanced at him, masking her
curiosity with the bored air of an English noblewoman.</p>

<p>Woon Yuen was a big man, for a Chinese, squattily built, yet
above medium height. His square, lemon-tinted face was adorned with
a thin wisp of drooping mustachios, and his bull-like shoulders
seemed ready to split the seams of the embroidered black silk robe
he wore. He had come to Shanghai from the North, and there was more
Mongol than Chinese in him, as emphasized by his massive forearms,
impressive even beneath his wide sleeves. He bowed, politely but
not obsequiously. He seemed impressed, but not awed by the presence
of the noted collector in his shop.</p>

<p>"Lady Elizabeth Willoughby does my humble establishment much
honor," said he, in perfect English, sweeping his eyes over her
without any attempt to conceal his avid interest in her ripe
curves. There was a natural arrogance about him, an assurance of
power. He had dealt with wealthy white women before, and strange
tales were whispered of his dealings with some of them. The air of
mystery and power about him made him seem a romantic figure to some
European women.</p>

<p>"The Bon is in the inner chamber," he said. "There, too, are my
real treasures. These," he gestured contemptuously about him, "are
only a show for tourists'. If milady would honor me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose and moved across the room, with the assured bearing of
a woman of quality, certain of deference at all time. He drew back
a satin curtain on which gilt dragons writhed, and following her
through, drew it together behind them. They went along a narrow
corridor, where the walls were hung with black velvet and the floor
was carpeted with thick Bokhara rugs in which her feet sank
deep.</p>

<p>A soft golden glow emanated from bronze lanterns, suspended from
the gilt-inlaid ceiling. She felt her pulse quicken. She was on her
way to the famous, yet mysterious, inner chamber of Woon Yuen,
inaccessible to all but wealthy and beautiful women, and in which,
rumor whispered, Woon Yuen had struck strange bargains. He did not
always sell his antiques for money, and there were feminine
collectors who would barter their virtue for a coveted relic.</p>

<p>Woon Yuen opened a bronze door, worked in gold and ebon inlay,
and Arline entered a broad chamber, over a silvery plate of glass
set in the threshold. She saw Woon Yuen glance down as she walked
over it, and knew he was getting an eyeful. That mirror placed
where a woman must walk over it to enter the chamber was a typical
Chinese trick to allow the master of the establishment to get a
more intimate glimpse of the charms of his fair customers, as
reflected in the mirror. She didn't care, but was merely amused at
his ingenuity. Even Woon Yuen would hardly dare to make a pass at
Lady Elizabeth Willoughby.</p>

<p>He closed the door and bowed her to an ornate mahogany
chair.</p>

<p>"Please excuse me for a moment, milady. I will return
instantly."</p>

<p>He went out by another door, and she looked about her at a
display whose richness might have shamed a shah's treasure-house.
Here indeed were the real treasures of Woon Yuen&mdash;what looked
like the plunder of a thousand sultans' palaces and heathen
temples. Idols in jade, gold, and ivory grinned at her, and a less
sophisticated woman would have blushed at some of the figures,
depicting Oriental gods and goddesses in amorous poses of an
astonishing variety. She could imagine the effect these things
would have on some of his feminine visitors.</p>

<p>Even her eyes dilated a trifle at the sight of the smirking,
pot-bellied monstrosity that was the ivory Bon, looted from God
only knew what nameless monastery high in the forbidden Himalayas.
Then every nerve tingled as she saw a gold-worked dragon head
jutting from the wall beyond the figure. Quickly she turned her
gaze back to the god, just as her host returned on silent,
velvet-shod feet.</p>

<p>He smiled to see her staring at the idol and the female figure
in its arms.</p>

<p>"That is only one of the conceptions of the god&mdash;the
Tibetan. It is worth, to any collector&mdash;but let us delay
business talk until after tea. If you will honor me&mdash;"</p>

<p>With his guest seated at a small ebon table, the Mongol struck a
bronze gong, and tea was served by a slim, silent-footed Chinese
girl, clad only in a filmy jacket which came a little below her
budding hips, and which concealed none of her smooth-skinned,
lemon-tinted charms.</p>

<p>This display, Arline knew, was in accord with the peculiar
Chinese belief that a woman is put in a properly receptive mood for
amorous advances by the sight of another woman's exposed charms.
She wondered, if, after all, Woon Yuen had designs&mdash;but he
showed no signs of it.</p>

<p>The slave girl bowed herself humbly out with a last salaam that
displayed her full breasts beneath the low-necked jacket, and
Arline's nerves tightened. Now was the time. She interrupted Woon
Yuen's polite trivialities.</p>

<p>"That little jade figure, over there on the ivory shelf," she
said, pointing. "Isn't that a piece of Jum Shan's work?"</p>

<p>"I will get it!"</p>

<p>As he rose and stepped to the shelf, she dropped the knock-out
pellet into his tea-cup. It dissolved instantly, without
discoloring the liquid. She was idly sipping her own tea when the
Mongol returned and placed the tiny figure of a jade warrior before
her.</p>

<p>"Genuine Jum Shan," said he. "It dates from the tenth century!"
He lifted his cup and emptied it at a draught, while she watched
him with a tenseness which she could not wholly conceal. He sat the
cup down empty, frowning slightly and twitching his lips at the
taste.</p>

<p>"I would like to call your attention, milady&mdash;" he leaned
forward, reaching toward the jade figure&mdash;then slumped down
across the table, out cold. In an instant she was across the room,
and her white, tapering fingers were at work on the teeth of the
carved dragon's head. There was an instinct in those fingers, a
super-sensitiveness such as skilled cracksmen sometimes have.</p>

<p>In a few moments the jaws gaped suddenly, revealing a
velvet-lined nest in the midst of which, like an egg of some fabled
bird of paradise, burned and smoldered a great, smooth, round
jewel.</p>

<p>She caught her breath as awedly she cupped it in her hands. It
was a ruby, of such deep crimson that it looked darkly purple, the
hue of old wine, and the blood that flows near the heart. It looked
like the materialization of a purple nightmare. She could believe
now the wild tales she had heard&mdash;that Woon Yuen worshiped it
as a god, sucking madness from its sinister depths, that he
performed terrible sacrifices to it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lovely, is it not?"</p>

<p>The low voice cracked the tense stillness like the
heart-stopping blast of an explosion. She whirled, gasping, then
stood transfixed. Woon Yuen stood before her, smiling dangerously,
his eyes slits of black fire. A frantic glance sped to the
tea-table. There still sprawled a limp, bulky figure, idential to
Woon Yuen in every detail.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;?" she gasped weakly.</p>

<p>"My shadow," he smiled. "I must be cautious. Long ago I hit upon
the expedient of having a servant made up to resemble me, to fool
my enemies. When I left the chamber a little while ago, he took my
place, and I watched through the peep-hole. I supposed you were
after the Heart."</p>

<p>"How did you guess?" She sensed the uselessness of denial.</p>

<p>"Why not? Has not every thief in China tried to steal it?" He
spoke softly, but his eyes shone reddishly, and the veins swelled
on his neck. "As soon as I learned you were not what you pretended,
I knew you had come to steal something. Why not the ruby? I set my
trap and let you walk into it. But I must congratulate you on your
cleverness. Not one in a thousand could have discovered the way to
open the dragon's jaws."</p>

<p>"How did you know I wasn't Lady Elizabeth?" she whispered,
dry-lipped; the great ruby seemed to burn her palms.</p>

<p>"I knew it when you walked across the mirror and I saw your
lower extremities reflected there, I have never seen Lady
Elizabeth, but all dealers in jade know her peculiarities by
reputation. One of them is such a passion for jade that she always
wears jade-green step-ins. Yours are lavender."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she panted, as he moved toward
her.</p>

<p>A light akin to madness burned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You have defamed the Heart by your touch! It must drink of all
who touch it save me, its high priest! If a man, his blood! If a
woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>No need for him to complete his abominable decree. The ruby fell
to the thick carpet, rolled along it like a revolving, demoniac
eyeball. She sprang back, shrieking, as Woon Yuen, no longer
placid, but with his convulsed face a beast's mask, caught her by
the wrist. Against his thickly muscled arms her struggles were
vain. As in a nightmare, she felt herself lifted and carried
kicking and scratching, through heavily brocaded drapes into a
curtained alcove. Her eyes swept the room helplessly; she saw the
ivory Bon leering at her as through a mist. It seemed to mock
her.</p>

<p>The alcove was walled with mirrors. Only Chinese cruelty could
have devised such an arrangement, where, whichever way she twisted
her head she was confronted by the spectacle of her own
humiliation, reflected from every angle. She was at once actor and
spectator in a beastly drama. She could not escape the shameful
sight of her own writhings and the eager brutish hands of Woon Yuen
remorselessly subduing her hopeless, desperate struggles.</p>

<p>As she felt the greedy yellow fingers on her cringing flesh, she
saw in the mirrors, her quivering white breasts, her dress
torn&mdash;dishevelled, the scarlet skirt in startling contrast to
the white thighs, with only a wisp of silk protecting them as they
frantically flexed, twisted and writhed&mdash;then with a sucking
gasp of breath between his grinding teeth, Woon Yuen tore the filmy
underthings to rags on her body...</p>

<p>At the tea-table the senseless Chinese still sprawled, deaf to
the frantic, agonized shrieks that rang again and again through the
inner chamber of Woon Yuen.</p>

<p><br>
An hour later a door opened into a narrow alley in the rear of Woon
Yuen's antique shop, and Arline was thrust roughly out, her breasts
almost bare, her dress ripped to shreds. She fell sprawling from
the force of the shove, and the door was slammed, with a brutal
laugh. Dazedly she rose, shook down the remains of her skirt, drew
her dress together, and tottered down the alley, sobbing
hysterically.</p>

<p>Inside the room from which she had just been ejected, Woon Yuen
turned to a lean, saturnine individual, whose pigtail was wound
tightly about his head, and from whose wide silk girdle jutted the
handle of a light hatchet.</p>

<p>"Yao Chin, take Yun Kang and follow her. There is always some
man behind the scenes, when a woman steals. I let her go because I
wished her to lead us to that man, send Yun Kang back to me. On no
account kill him yourself. I, and only I, must feed the Heart with
their vile blood&mdash;hers and his."</p>

<p>The hatchetman bowed and left the room, his face showing nothing
of his secret belief that Woon Yuen was crazy, not because he
believed the Heart drank human blood, but because he, a rich
merchant, insisted on doing murder which others of his class always
left to hired slayers.</p>

<p><br>
In the mouth of a little twisting alley that ran out upon a rotting
abandoned wharf, Arline paused. Her face was haggard and desperate.
She had reached the end of her trail. She had failed, and Tremayne
would not accept any excuse. Ahead of her she saw only the black
muzzles of a firing squad to which he would deliver her&mdash;but
first there would be torture, inhuman torture, to wring from her
secrets her captors would think she possessed. The world at large
never knows the full story of the treatment of suspected spies.</p>

<p>With a low moan she covered her eyes with her arm and stumbled
blindly toward the edge of the wharf&mdash;then a strong arm caught
her waist and she looked up into the startled face of Wild Bill
Clanton.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you fixin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Let go!" she whimpered. "It's my life! I can end it if I want
to!"</p>

<p>"Not with me around," he grunted, picking her up and carrying
her back away from the wharf-lip. He sat down on a pile and took
her on his lap, like a child. "Good thing I found you," he grunted.
"I had a hell of a time tracin' you after you slugged me and ran up
that alley, but I finally saw you duckin' down this one. You pick
the damndest places to stroll in. Now you tell me what the trouble
is. A classy dame like you don't need to go jumpin' off of
docks."</p>

<p>He seemed to hold no grudge for that clout with the pitcher.
There was possessiveness in the clasp of his arms about her supple
body, but she found a comforting solidity in the breast muscles
against which her flaxen head rested. There was a promise of
security in his masculine strength. Suddenly she no longer resented
his persistent pursuit of her. She needed his strength&mdash;needed
a man who would fight for her.</p>

<p>In a few words she told him everything&mdash;the hold Tremayne
had on her, the task he had set for her, and what had happened in
Woon Yuen's inner room.</p>

<p>He swore at the narrative.</p>

<p>"I'll get that yellow-belly for that! But first we'll go to the
Alley of Rats. Try to stall Tremayne along to give you another
chance. In the meantime I'll work on a Eurasian wench I know who
could tell me plenty about him&mdash;and she will, too, or I'll
skin her alive. He's been mixed up in plenty of crooked rackets. If
we get somethin' hot on him, we can shut his mouth, all right. And
we'll get somethin', you can bet."</p>

<p>When they entered the Alley of Rats, in a half-abandoned
warehouse district in the native quarter, they did not see two
furtive figures slinking after them, nor hear the taller whisper:
"Yun Kang, go back and tell our master she had led us to a man! I
will watch the alley till he comes."</p>

<p>Clanton and Arline turned into a dingy doorway, and went down a
corridor that seemed wholly deserted. Groping along it, in the
dusk, she found the room she sought and led Clanton into it. She
lit a candle stub stuck on a shelf, and turned to Clanton: "He'll
be here soon."</p>

<p>"I'll wait in the next room," he said, reluctantly taking his
arm from about her waist. "If he gets rough, I'll come in."</p>

<p>Alone in the candle-lighted room she tried to compose herself;
her heart was beating a wild tattoo, loud in the stillness.
Somewhere rats scampered noisily. Time dragged insufferably. Then
quick, light steps sounded in the hall, and Duke Tremayne burst
through the door, his eyes blazing with greed. They turned red as
he read defeat in her eyes; his face contorted.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" His fingers were like talons as he gripped her
shoulders. "You failed!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it!" she pleaded. "He knew I was a fake. Please
don't hurt me, Duke. I'll try again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Try again? You little fool! Do you think that Chinese devil
will give you another chance?" Tremayne's suavity was gone; he was
like a madman. "You failed, after all my planning! All right! I'll
have a little profit out of you! Take off that dress&mdash;"
Already in shreds, the garment ripped easily in his grasp, baring a
white breast which quivered under his gaze.</p>

<p>The inner door swung open. Tremayne wheeled, drawing a pistol,
but before he could fire, Clanton's fist crashed against his jaw
and stretched him senseless. Clanton bent and picked up the gun,
then whirled as the hall door opened behind him. He stiffened as a
tranquil voice spoke: "Do not move, my friend!"</p>

<p>He looked into the muzzle of a gun in Woon Yuen's hand.</p>

<p>"So you are the man?" muttered the Mongol. "Good! The Heart
drinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could fire before Clanton could lift the pistol he held. But
behind the American Arline laughed suddenly, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"It worked, Bill!" she exclaimed. "Our man will get the ruby
while we hold Woon Yuen here! The fool! He hasn't yet guessed that
we tricked him to draw him away from his shop after I'd found where
he hid the gem."</p>

<p>Woon Yuen's face went ashen. With a choking cry he fired, not at
Clanton but at the girl. But his hand was shaking like a leaf. He
missed, and like an echo of his shot came the crack of Clanton's
pistol. Woon Yuen dropped, drilled through the head.</p>

<p>"Good work, kid!" Clanton cried exultantly. "He fell for
it&mdash;hard!"</p>

<p>"But they'll hang us for this!" whimpered the girl. "Listen!
Someone's running up the hall! They've heard the shots!"</p>

<p>Stooping swiftly Clanton folded Duke Tremayne's fingers about
the butt of the smoking pistol, and then kicked the man heavily in
the shins. Tremayne grunted and showed signs of returning
consciousness. Clanton drew Arline into the other room and they
watched through the crack of the door.</p>

<p>The hall door opened and Yao Chin came in like a panther,
hatchet in hand. His eyes blazed at the sight of Woon Yuen on the
floor, Tremayne staggering to his feet, a pistol in his hand. With
one stride the hatchetman reached the reeling blackmailer. There
was a flash of steel, an ugly butcher-shop <i>crunch</i>, and
Tremayne slumped, his skull split. Yao Chin tossed the reeking
hatchet to the floor beside his victim and turned away.</p>

<p>"Out of here, quick!" muttered Clanton, shaking Arline who
seemed threatened with hysteria. "Up the alley&mdash;in the other
direction."</p>

<p>She regained her poise in their groping flight up the darkened
alley, as Clanton muttered: "We're in the clear now. Tremayne can't
talk, with his head split, and that hatchetman'll tell his pals
Tremayne shot their boss."</p>

<p>"We'd better get out of town!" They had emerged into a narrow,
lamp-lit street.</p>

<p>"Why? We're safe from suspicion now." A little tingle of
pleasure ran through her as Clanton turned into a doorway and spoke
to a grinning old Chinaman who bowed them into a small neat room,
with curtained windows and a couch.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the old Chinese, Clanton caught her
hungrily to him, finding her red lips, now unresisting. Her arms
went about his thick neck as he lifted her bodily from the floor.
Willingly she yielded, responded to his eager caresses.</p>

<p>She had only exchanged masters, it was true, but this was
different. There was a delicious sense of comfort and security in a
strong man who could fight for her and protect her. There was
pleasure in the dominance of his strong hands. With a blissful sigh
she settled herself luxuriously in his powerful arms.</p>
