  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:28%">
  They say foul things of Old Times still lurk<br>
  In dark forgotten corners of the world,<br>
  And Gates still gape to loose, on certain nights,<br>
  Shapes pent in Hell.<br>
  &mdash;Justin</p>
  <br>

<p class="first"">I READ of it first in the strange book of Von
Junzt, the German eccentric who lived so curiously and died in
such grisly and mysterious fashion. It was my fortune to have
access to his <i>Nameless Cults</i> in the original edition, the
so-called Black Book, published in Dusseldorf in 1839, shortly
before a hounding doom overtook the author. Collectors of rare
literature were familiar with <i>Nameless Cults</i> mainly
through the cheap and faulty translation which was pirated in
London by Bridewall in 1845, and the carefully expurgated edition
put out by the Golden Goblin Press of New York, 1909. But the
volume I stumbled upon was one of the unexpurgated German copies,
with heavy black leather covers and rusty iron hasps. I doubt if
there are more than half a dozen such volumes in the entire world
today, for the quantity issued was not great, and when the manner
of the author's demise was bruited about, many possessors of the
book burned their volumes in panic.</p>

<p>Von Junzt spent his entire life (1795-1840) delving into
forbidden subjects; he traveled in all parts of the world, gained
entrance into innumerable secret societies, and read countless
little-known and esoteric books and manuscripts in the original;
and in the chapters of the Black Book, which range from startling
clarity of exposition to murky ambiguity, there are statements
and hints to freeze the blood of a thinking man. Reading what Von
Junzt <i>dared</i> put in print arouses uneasy speculations as to
what it was that he dared <i>not</i> tell. What dark matters, for
instance, were contained in those closely written pages that
formed the unpublished manuscript on which he worked unceasingly
for months before his death, and which lay torn and scattered all
over the floor of the locked and bolted chamber in which Von
Junzt was found dead with the marks of taloned fingers on his
throat? It will never be known, for the author's closest friend,
the Frenchman Alexis Ladeau, after having spent a whole night
piecing the fragments together and reading what was written,
burnt them to ashes and cut his own throat with a razor.</p>

<p>But the contents of the published matter are shuddersome
enough, even if one accepts the general view that they but
represent the ravings of a madman. There among many strange
things I found mention of the Black Stone, that curious, sinister
monolith that broods among the mountains of Hungary, and about
which so many dark legends cluster. Von Junzt did not devote much
space to it&mdash;the bulk of his grim work concerns cults and
objects of dark worship which he maintained existed in his day,
and it would seem that the Black Stone represents some order or
being lost and forgotten centuries ago. But he spoke of it as one
of the <i>keys</i>&mdash;a phrase used many times by him, in
various relations, and constituting one of the obscurities of his
work. And he hinted briefly at curious sights to be seen about
the monolith on Midsummer's Night. He mentioned Otto Dostmann's
theory that this monolith was a remnant of the Hunnish invasion
and had been erected to commemorate a victory of Attila over the
Goths. Von Junzt contradicted this assertion without giving any
refutory facts, merely remarking that to attribute the origin of
the Black Stone to the Huns was as logical as assuming that
William the Conqueror reared Stonehenge.</p>

<p>This implication of enormous antiquity piqued my interest
immensely and after some difficulty I succeeded in locating a
rat-eaten and moldering copy of Dostmann's <i>Remnants of Lost
Empires</i> (Berlin, 1809, "Das Drachenhaus" Press). I was
disappointed to find that Dostmann referred to the Black Stone
even more briefly than had Von Junzt, dismissing it with a few
lines as an artifact comparatively modern in contrast with the
Greco-Roman ruins of Asia Minor which were his pet theme. He
admitted his inability to make out the defaced characters on the
monolith but pronounced them unmistakably Mongoloid. However,
little as I learned from Dostmann, he did mention the name of the
village adjacent to the Black Stone&mdash;Stregoicavar&mdash;an
ominous name, meaning something like Witch-Town.</p>

<p>A close scrutiny of guidebooks and travel articles gave me no
further information&mdash;Stregoicavar, not on any map that I
could find, lay in a wild, little-frequented region, out of the
path of casual tourists. But I did find subject for thought in
Dornly's <i>Magyar Folklore</i>. In his chapter on <i>Dream
Myths</i> he mentions the Black Stone and tells of some curious
superstitions regarding it&mdash;especially the belief that if
anyone sleeps in the vicinity of the monolith, that person will
be haunted by monstrous nightmares forever after; and he cited
tales of the peasants regarding too-curious people who ventured
to visit the Stone on Midsummer Night and who died raving mad
because of <i>something</i> they saw there.</p>

<p>That was all I could gleam from Dornly, but my interest was
even more intensely roused as I sensed a distinctly sinister aura
about the Stone. The suggestion of dark antiquity, the recurrent
hint of unnatural events on Midsummer Night, touched some
slumbering instinct in my being, as one senses, rather than
hears, the flowing of some dark subterraneous river in the
night.</p>

<p>And I suddenly saw a connection between this Stone and a
certain weird and fantastic poem written by the mad poet, Justin
Geoffrey: <i>The People of the Monolith</i>. Inquiries led to the
information that Geoffrey had indeed written that poem while
traveling in Hungary, and I could not doubt that the Black Stone
was the very monolith to which he referred in his strange verse.
Reading his stanzas again, I felt once more the strange dim
stirrings of subconscious promptings that I had noticed when
first reading of the Stone.</p>

<p>I had been casting about for a place to spend a short vacation
and I made up my mind. I went to Stregoicavar. A train of
obsolete style carried me from Temesvar to within striking
distance, at least, of my objective, and a three days' ride in a
jouncing coach brought me to the little village which lay in a
fertile valley high up in the fir-clad mountains. The journey
itself was uneventful, but during the first day we passed the old
battlefield of Schomvaal where the brave Polish-Hungarian knight,
Count Boris Vladinoff, made his gallant and futile stand against
the victorious hosts of Suleiman the Magnificent, when the Grand
Turk swept over eastern Europe in 1526.</p>

<p>The driver of the coach pointed out to me a great heap of
crumbling stones on a hill nearby, under which, he said, the
bones of the brave Count lay. I remembered a passage from
Larson's <i>Turkish Wars</i>. "After the skirmish" (in which the
Count with his small army had beaten back the Turkish advance-
guard) "the Count was standing beneath the half-ruined walls of
the old castle on the hill, giving orders as to the disposition
of his forces, when an aide brought to him a small lacquered case
which had been taken from the body of the famous Turkish scribe
and historian, Selim Bahadur, who had fallen in the fight. The
Count took therefrom a roll of parchment and began to read, but
he had not read far before he turned very pale and, without
saying a word, replaced the parchment in the case and thrust the
case into his cloak. At that very instant a hidden Turkish
battery suddenly opened fire, and the balls striking the old
castle, the Hungarians were horrified to see the walls crash down
in ruin, completely covering the brave Count. Without a leader
the gallant little army was cut to pieces, and in the war-swept
years which followed, the bones of the noblemen were never
recovered. Today the natives point out a huge and moldering pile
of ruins near Schomvaal beneath which, they say, still rests all
that the centuries have left of Count Boris Vladinoff."</p>

<p>I found the village of Stregoicavar a dreamy, drowsy little
village that apparently belied its sinister cognomen&mdash;a
forgotten back-eddy that Progress had passed by. The quaint
houses and the quainter dress and manners of the people were
those of an earlier century. They were friendly, mildly curious
but not inquisitive, though visitors from the outside world were
extremely rare.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago another American came here and stayed a few
days in the village," said the owner of the tavern where I had
put up, "a young fellow and queer-acting&mdash;mumbled to
himself&mdash;a poet, I think."</p>

<p>I knew he must mean Justin Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was a poet," I answered, "and he wrote a poem about a
bit of scenery near this very village."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Mine host's interest was aroused. "Then, since all
great poets are strange in their speech and actions, he must have
achieved great fame, for his actions and conversations were the
strangest of any man I ever I knew."</p>

<p>"As is usual with artists," I answered, "most of his
recognition has come since his death."</p>

<p>"He is dead, then?"</p>

<p>"He died screaming in a madhouse five years ago."</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad," sighed mine host sympathetically. "Poor
lad&mdash;he looked too long at the Black Stone."</p>

<p>My heart gave a leap, but I masked my keen interest and said
casually. "I have heard something of this Black Stone; somewhere
near this village, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Nearer than Christian folk wish," he responded. "Look!" He
drew me to a latticed window and pointed up at the fir-clad
slopes of the brooding blue mountains. "There beyond where you
see the bare face of that jutting cliff stands that accursed
Stone. Would that it were ground to powder and the powder flung
into the Danube to be carried to the deepest ocean! Once men
tried to destroy the thing, but each man who laid hammer or maul
against it came to an evil end. So now the people shun it."</p>

<p>"What is there so evil about it?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"It is a demon-haunted thing," he answered uneasily and with
the suggestion of a shudder. "In my childhood I knew a young man
who came up from below and laughed at our traditions&mdash;in his
foolhardiness he went to the Stone one Midsummer Night and at
dawn stumbled into the village again, stricken dumb and mad.
Something had shattered his brain and sealed his lips, for until
the day of his death, which came soon after, he spoke only to
utter terrible blasphemies or to slaver gibberish.</p>

<p>"My own nephew when very small was lost in the mountains and
slept in the woods near the Stone, and now in his manhood he is
tortured by foul dreams, so that at times he makes the night
hideous with his screams and wakes with cold sweat upon him.</p>

<p>"But let us talk of something else, <i>Herr</i>; it is not
good to dwell upon such things."</p>

<p>I remarked on the evident age of the tavern and he answered
with pride. "The foundations are more than four hundred years
old; the original house was the only one in the village which was
not burned to the ground when Suleiman's devils swept through the
mountains. Here, in the house that then stood on these same
foundations, it is said, the scribe Selim Bahadur had his
headquarters while ravaging the country hereabouts."</p>

<p>I learned then that the present inhabitants of Stregoicavar
are not descendants of the people who dwelt there before the
Turkish raid of 1526. The victorious Moslems left no living human
in the village or the vicinity thereabouts when they passed over.
Men, women and children they wiped out in one red holocaust of
murder, leaving a vast stretch of country silent and utterly
deserted. The present people of Stregoicavar are descended from
hardy settlers from the lower valleys who came into the ruined
village after the Turk was thrust back.</p>

<p>Mine host did not speak of the extermination of the original
inhabitants with any great resentment and I learned that his
ancestors in the lower levels had looked on the mountaineers with
even more hatred and aversion than they regarded the Turks. He
was rather vague regarding the causes of this feud, but said that
the original inhabitants of Stregoicavar had been in the habit of
making stealthy raids on the lowlands and stealing girls and
children. Moreover, he said that they were not exactly of the
same blood as his own people; the sturdy, original Magyar-Slavic
stock had mixed and intermarried with a degraded aboriginal race
until the breeds had blended, producing an unsavory amalgamation.
Who these aborigines were, he had not the slightest idea, but
maintained that they were "pagans" and had dwelt in the mountains
since time immemorial, before the coming of the conquering
peoples.</p>

<p>I attached little importance to this tale; seeing in it merely
a parallel to the amalgamation of Celtic tribes with
Mediterranean aborigines in the Galloway hills, with the
resultant mixed race which, as Picts, has such an extensive part
in Scotch legendary. Time has a curious foreshortening effect on
folklore, and just as tales of the Picts became intertwined with
legends of an older Mongoloid race, so that eventually the Picts
were ascribed the repulsive appearance of the squat primitives,
whose individuality merged, in the telling, into Pictish tales,
and was forgotten; so, I felt, the supposed inhuman attributes of
the first villagers of Stregoicavar could be traced to older,
outworn myths with invading Huns and Mongols.</p>

<p>The morning after my arrival I received directions from mine
host, who gave them worriedly, and set out to find the Black
Stone. A few hours' tramp up the fir-covered slopes brought me to
the face of the rugged, solid stone cliff which jutted boldly
from the mountainside. A narrow trail wound up it, and mounting
this, I looked out over the peaceful valley of Stregoicavar,
which seemed to drowse, guarded on either hand by the great blue
mountains. No huts or any sign of human tenancy showed between
the cliff whereon I stood and the village. I saw numbers of
scattering farms in the valley but all lay on the other side of
Stregoicavar, which itself seemed to shrink from the brooding
slopes which masked the Black Stone.</p>

<p>The summit of the cliffs proved to be a sort of thickly wooded
plateau. I made my way through the dense growth for a short
distance and came into a wide glade; and in the center of the
glade reared a gaunt figure of black stone.</p>

<p>It was octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and
about a foot and a half thick. It had once evidently been highly
polished, but now the surface was thickly dinted as if savage
efforts had been made to demolish it; but the hammers had done
little more than to flake off small bits of stone and mutilate
the characters which once had evidently marched up in a spiraling
line round and round the shaft to the top. Up to ten feet from
the base these characters were almost completely blotted out, so
that it was very difficult to trace their direction. Higher up
they were plainer, and I managed to squirm part of the way up the
shaft and scan them at close range. All were more or less
defaced, but I was positive that they symbolized no language now
remembered on the face of the earth. I am fairly familiar with
all hieroglyphics known to researchers and philologists and I can
say, with certainty that those characters were like nothing of
which I have ever read or heard. The nearest approach to them
that I ever saw were some crude scratches on a gigantic and
strangely symmetrical rock in a lost valley of Yucatan. I
remember that when I pointed out these marks to the archeologist
who was my companion, he maintained that they either represented
natural weathering or the idle scratching of some Indian. To my
theory that the rock was really the base of a long-vanished
column, he merely laughed, calling my attention to the dimensions
of it, which suggested, if it were built with any natural rules
of architectural symmetry, a column a thousand feet high. But I
was not convinced.</p>

<p>I will not say that the characters on the Black Stone were
similar to those on that colossal rock in Yucatan; but one
suggested the other. As to the substance of the monolith, again I
was baffled. The stone of which it was composed was a dully
gleaming black, whose surface, where it was not dinted and
roughened, created a curious illusion of semi-transparency.</p>

<p>I spent most of the morning there and came away baffled. No
connection of the Stone with any other artifact in the world
suggested itself to me. It was as if the monolith had been reared
by alien hands, in an age distant and apart from human ken.</p>

<p>I returned to the village with my interest in no way abated.
Now that I had seen the curious thing, my desire was still more
keenly whetted to investigate the matter further and seek to
learn by what strange hands and for what strange purpose the
Black Stone had been reared in the long ago.</p>

<p>I sought out the tavern-keeper's nephew and questioned him in
regard to his dreams, but he was vague, though willing to oblige.
He did not mind discussing them, but was unable to describe them
with any clarity. Though he dreamed the same dreams repeatedly,
and though they were hideously vivid at the time, they left no
distinct impression on his waking mind. He remembered them only
as chaotic nightmares through which huge whirling fires shot
lurid tongues of flame and a black drum bellowed incessantly. One
thing only he remembered clearly&mdash;in one dream he had seen
the Black Stone, not on a mountain slope but set like a spire on
a colossal black castle.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the villagers I found them not inclined to
talk about the Stone, with the exception of the schoolmaster, a
man of surprizing education, who spent much more of his time out
in the world than any of the rest.</p>

<p>He was much interested in what I told him of Von Junzt's
remarks about the Stone, and warmly agreed with the German author
in the alleged age of the monolith. He believed that a coven had
once existed in the vicinity and that possibly all of the
original villagers had been members of that fertility cult which
once threatened to undermine European civilization and gave rise
to the tales of witchcraft. He cited the very name of the village
to prove his point; it had not been originally named
Stregoicavar, he said; according to legends the builders had
called it Xuthltan, which was the aboriginal name of the site on
which the village had been built many centuries ago.</p>

<p>This fact roused again an indescribable feeling of uneasiness.
The barbarous name did not suggest connection with any Scythic,
Slavic or Mongolian race to which an aboriginal people of these
mountains would, under natural circumstances, have belonged.</p>

<p>That the Magyars and Slavs of the lower valleys believed the
original inhabitants of the village to be members of the
witchcraft cult was evident, the schoolmaster said, by the name
they gave it, which name continued to be used even after the
older settlers had been massacred by the Turks, and the village
rebuilt by a cleaner and more wholesome breed.</p>

<p>He did not believe that the members of the cult erected the
monolith but he did believe that they used it as a center of
their activities, and repeating vague legends which had been
handed down since before the Turkish invasion, he advanced the
theory that the degenerate villagers had used it as a sort of
altar on which they offered human sacrifices, using as victims
the girls and babies stolen from his own ancestors in the lower
valleys.</p>

<p>He discounted the myths of weird events on Midsummer Night, as
well as a curious legend of a strange deity which the witch-
people of Xuthltan were said to have invoked with chants and wild
rituals of flagellation and slaughter.</p>

<p>He had never visited the Stone on Midsummer Night, he said,
but he would not fear to do so; whatever <i>had</i> existed or
taken place there in the past, had been long engulfed in the
mists of time and oblivion. The Black Stone had lost its meaning
save as a link to a dead and dusty past.</p>

<p>It was while returning from a visit with this schoolmaster one
night about a week after my arrival at Stregoicavar that a sudden
recollection struck me&mdash;it was Midsummer Night! The very
time that the legends linked with grisly implications to the
Black Stone. I turned away from the tavern and strode swiftly
through the village. Stregoicavar lay silent; the villagers
retired early. I saw no one as I passed rapidly out of the
village and up into the firs which masked the mountain's slopes
with whispering darkness. A broad silver moon hung above the
valley, flooding the crags and slopes in a weird light and
etching the shadows blackly. No wind blew through the firs, but a
mysterious, intangible rustling and whispering was abroad. Surely
on such nights in past centuries, my whimsical imagination told
me, naked witches astride magic broomsticks had flown across the
valley, pursued by jeering demoniac familiars.</p>

<p>I came to the cliffs and was somewhat disquieted to note that
the illusive moonlight lent them a subtle appearance I had not
noticed before&mdash;in the weird light they appeared less like
natural cliffs and more like the ruins of cyclopean and Titan-
reared battlements jutting from the mountain-slope.</p>

<p>Shaking off this hallucination with difficulty I came upon the
plateau and hesitated a moment before I plunged into the brooding
darkness of the woods. A sort of breathless tenseness hung over
the shadows, like an unseen monster holding its breath lest it
scare away its prey.</p>

<p>I shook off the sensation&mdash;a natural one, considering the
eeriness of the place and its evil reputation&mdash;and made my
way through the wood, experiencing a most unpleasant sensation
that I was being followed, and halting once, sure that something
clammy and unstable had brushed against my face in the
darkness.</p>

<p>I came out into the glade and saw the tall monolith rearing
its gaunt height above the sward. At the edge of the woods on the
side toward the cliffs was a stone which formed a sort of natural
seat. I sat down, reflecting that it was probably while there
that the mad poet, Justin Geoffrey, had written his fantastic
<i>People of the Monolith</i>. Mine host thought that it was the
Stone which had caused Geoffrey's insanity, but the seeds of
madness had been sown in the poet's brain long before he ever
came to Stregoicavar.</p>

<p>A glance at my watch showed that the hour of midnight was
close at hand. I leaned back, waiting whatever ghostly
demonstration might appear. A thin night wind started up among
the branches of the firs, with an uncanny suggestion of faint,
unseen pipes whispering an eerie and evil tune. The monotony of
the sound and my steady gazing at the monolith produced a sort of
self-hypnosis upon me; I grew drowsy. I fought this feeling, but
sleep stole on me in spite of myself; the monolith seemed to sway
and dance, strangely distorted to my gaze, and then I slept.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and sought to rise, but lay still, as if an
icy hand gripped me helpless. Cold terror stole over me. The
glade was no longer deserted. It was thronged by a silent crowd
of strange people, and my distended eyes took in strange barbaric
details of costume which my reason told me were archaic and
forgotten even in this backward land. Surely, I thought, these
are villagers who have come here to hold some fantastic
conclave&mdash;but another glance told me that these people were
not the folk of Stregoicavar. They were a shorter, more squat
race, whose brows were lower, whose faces were broader and
duller. Some had Slavic and Magyar features, but those features
were degraded as from a mixture of some baser, alien strain I
could not classify. Many wore the hides of wild beasts, and their
whole appearance, both men and women, was one of sensual
brutishness. They terrified and repelled me, but they gave me no
heed. They formed in a vast half-circle in front of the monolith
and began a sort of chant, flinging their arms in unison and
weaving their bodies rhythmically from the waist upward. All eyes
were fixed on the top of the Stone which they seemed to be
invoking. But the strangest of all was the dimness of their
voices; not fifty yards from me hundreds of men and women were
unmistakably lifting their voices in a wild chant, yet those
voices came to me as a faint indistinguishable murmur as if from
across vast leagues of Space&mdash;or <i>time</i>.</p>

<p>Before the monolith stood a sort of brazier from which a vile,
nauseous yellow smoke billowed upward, curling curiously in a
swaying spiral around the black shaft, like a vast unstable
snake.</p>

<p>On one side of this brazier lay two figures&mdash;a young
girl, stark naked and bound hand and foot, and an infant,
apparently only a few months old. On the other side of the
brazier squatted a hideous old hag with a queer sort of black
drum on her lap; this drum she beat with slow light blows of her
open palms, but I could not hear the sound.</p>

<p>The rhythm of the swaying bodies grew faster and into the
space between the people and the monolith sprang a naked young
woman, her eyes blazing, her long black hair flying loose.
Spinning dizzily on her toes, she whirled across the open space
and fell prostrate before the Stone, where she lay motionless.
The next instant a fantastic figure followed her&mdash;a man from
whose waist hung a goatskin, and whose features were entirely
hidden by a sort of mask made from a huge wolf's head, so that he
looked like a monstrous, nightmare being, horribly compounded of
elements both human and bestial. In his hand he held a bunch of
long fir switches bound together at the larger ends, and the
moonlight glinted on a chain of heavy gold looped about his neck.
A smaller chain depending from it suggested a pendant of some
sort, but this was missing.</p>

<p>The people tossed their arms violently and seemed to redouble
their shouts as this grotesque creature loped across the open
space with many a fantastic leap and caper. Coming to the woman
who lay before the monolith, he began to lash her with the
switches he bore, and she leaped up and spun into the wild mazes
of the most incredible dance I have ever seen. And her tormentor
danced with her, keeping the wild rhythm, matching her every
whirl and bound, while incessantly raining cruel blows on her
naked body. And at every blow he shouted a single word, over and
over, and all the people shouted it back. I could see the working
of their lips, and now the faint far-off murmur of their voices
merged and blended into one distant shout, repeated over and over
with slobbering ecstasy. But what the one word was, I could not
make out.</p>

<p>In dizzy whirls spun the wild dancers, while the lookers-on,
standing still in their tracks, followed the rhythm of their
dance with swaying bodies and weaving arms. Madness grew in the
eyes of the capering votaress and was reflected in the eyes of
the watchers. Wilder and more extravagant grew the whirling
frenzy of that mad dance&mdash;it became a bestial and obscene
thing, while the old hag howled and battered the drum like a
crazy woman, and the switches cracked out a devil's tune.</p>

<p>Blood trickled down the dancer's limbs but she seemed not to
feel the lashing save as a stimulus for further enormities of
outrageous motion; bounding into the midst of the yellow smoke
which now spread out tenuous tentacles to embrace both flying
figures, she seemed to merge with that foul fog and veil herself
with it. Then emerging into plain view, closely followed by the
beast-thing that flogged her, she shot into an indescribable,
explosive burst of dynamic mad motion, and on the very crest of
that mad wave, she dropped suddenly to the sward, quivering and
panting as if completely overcome by her frenzied exertions. The
lashing continued with unabated violence and intensity and she
began to wriggle toward the monolith on her belly. The
priest&mdash;or such I will call him&mdash;followed, lashing her
unprotected body with all the power of his arm as she writhed
along, leaving a heavy track of blood on the trampled earth. She
reached the monolith, and gasping and panting, flung both arms
about it and covered the cold stone with fierce hot kisses, as in
frenzied and unholy adoration.</p>

<p>The fantastic priest bounded high in the air, flinging away
the red-dabbled switches, and the worshippers, howling and
foaming at the mouths, turned on each other with tooth and nail,
rending one another's garments and flesh in a blind passion of
bestiality. The priest swept up the infant with a long arm, and
shouting again that Name, whirled the wailing babe high in the
air and dashed its brains out against the monolith, leaving a
ghastly stain on the black surface. Cold with horror I saw him
rip the tiny body open with his bare brutish fingers and fling
handfuls of blood on the shaft, then toss the red and torn shape
into the brazier, extinguishing flame and smoke in a crimson
rain, while the maddened brutes behind him howled over and over
the Name. Then suddenly they all fell prostrate, writhing like
snakes, while the priest flung wide his gory hands as in triumph.
I opened my mouth to scream my horror and loathing, but only a
dry rattle sounded; a huge monstrous toad-like <i>thing</i>
squatted on the top of the monolith!</p>

<p>I saw its bloated, repulsive and unstable outline against the
moonlight and set in what would have been the face of a natural
creature, its huge, blinking eyes which reflected all the lust,
abysmal greed, obscene cruelty and monstrous evil that has
stalked the sons of men since their ancestors moved blind and
hairless in the treetops. In those grisly eyes were mirrored all
the unholy things and vile secrets that sleep in the cities under
the sea, and that skulk from the light of day in the blackness of
primordial caverns. And so that ghastly thing that the unhallowed
ritual of cruelty and sadism and blood had evoked from the
silence of the hills, leered and blinked down on its bestial
worshippers, who groveled in abhorrent abasement before it.</p>

<p>Now the beast-masked priest lifted the bound and weakly
writhing girl in his brutish hands and held her up toward that
horror on the monolith. And as that monstrosity sucked in its
breath, lustfully and slobberingly, something snapped in my brain
and I fell into a merciful faint.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes on a still white dawn. All the events of the
night rushed back on me and I sprang up, then stared about me in
amazement. The monolith brooded gaunt and silent above the sward
which waved, green and untrampled, in the morning breeze. A few
quick strides took me across the glade; here had the dancers
leaped and bounded until the ground should have been trampled
bare, and here had the votaress wriggled her painful way to the
Stone, streaming blood on the earth. But no drop of crimson
showed on the uncrushed sward. I looked, shudderingly, at the
side of the monolith against which the bestial priest had brained
the stolen baby&mdash;but no dark stain nor grisly clot showed
there.</p>

<p>A dream! It had been a wild nightmare&mdash;or else&mdash;I
shrugged my shoulders. What vivid clarity for a dream!</p>

<p>I returned quietly to the village and entered the inn without
being seen. And there I sat meditating over the strange events of
the night. More and more was I prone to discard the dream-theory.
That what I had seen was illusion and without material substance,
was evident. But I believed that I had looked on the mirrored
shadow of a deed perpetrated in ghastly actuality in bygone days.
But how was I to know? What proof to show that my vision had been
a gathering of foul specters rather than a nightmare originating
in my brain?</p>

<p>As if for answer a name flashed into my mind&mdash;Selim
Bahadur! According to legend this man, who had been a soldier as
well as a scribe, had commanded that part of Suleiman's army
which had devastated Stregoicavar; it seemed logical enough; and
if so, he had gone straight from the blotted-out countryside to
the bloody field of Schomvaal, and his doom. I sprang up with a
sudden shout&mdash;that manuscript which was taken from the
Turk's body, and which Count Boris shuddered over&mdash;might it
not contain some narration of what the conquering Turks found in
Stregoicavar? What else could have shaken the iron nerves of the
Polish adventurer? And since the bones of the Count had never
been recovered, what more certain than that the lacquered case,
with its mysterious contents, still lay hidden beneath the ruins
that covered Boris Vladinoff? I began packing my bag with fierce
haste.</p>

<p>Three days later found me ensconced in a little village a few
miles from the old battlefield, and when the moon rose I was
working with savage intensity on the great pile of crumbling
stone that crowned the hill. It was back-breaking
toil&mdash;looking back now I can not see how I accomplished it,
though I labored without a pause from moonrise to dawn. Just as
the sun was coming up I tore aside the last tangle of stones and
looked on all that was mortal of Count Boris Vladinoff&mdash;only
a few pitiful fragments of crumbling bone&mdash;and among them,
crushed out of all original shape, lay a case whose lacquered
surface had kept it from complete decay through the
centuries.</p>

<p>I seized it with frenzied eagerness, and piling back some of
the stones on the bones I hurried away; for I did not care to be
discovered by the suspicious peasants in an act of apparent
desecration.</p>

<p>Back in my tavern chamber I opened the case and found the
parchment comparatively intact; and there was something else in
the case&mdash;a small squat object wrapped in silk. I was wild
to plumb the secrets of those yellowed pages, but weariness
forbade me. Since leaving Stregoicavar I had hardly slept at all,
and the terrific exertions of the previous night combined to
overcome me. In spite of myself I was forced to stretch myself on
my bed, nor did I awake until sundown.</p>

<p>I snatched a hasty supper, and then in the light of a
flickering candle, I set myself to read the neat Turkish
characters that covered the parchment. It was difficult work, for
I am not deeply versed in the language and the archaic style of
the narrative baffled me. But as I toiled through it a word or a
phrase here and there leaped at me and a dimly growing horror
shook me in its grip. I bent my energies fiercely to the task,
and as the tale grew clearer and took more tangible form my blood
chilled in my veins, my hair stood up and my tongue clove to my
mouth. All external things partook of the grisly madness of that
infernal manuscript until the night sounds of insects and
creatures in the woods took the form of ghastly murmurings and
stealthy treadings of ghoulish horrors and the sighing of the
night wind changed to tittering obscene gloating of evil over the
souls of men.</p>

<p>At last when gray dawn was stealing through the latticed
window, I laid down the manuscript and took up and unwrapped the
thing in the bit of silk. Staring at it with haggard eyes I knew
the truth of the matter was clinched, even had it been possible
to doubt the veracity of that terrible manuscript.</p>

<p>And I replaced both obscene things in the case, nor did I rest
nor sleep nor eat until that case containing them had been
weighted with stones and flung into the deepest current of the
Danube which, God grant, carried them back into the Hell from
which they came.</p>

<p>It was no dream I dreamed on Midsummer Midnight in the hills
above Stregoicavar. Well for Justin Geoffrey that he tarried
there only in the sunlight and went his way, for had he gazed
upon that ghastly conclave, his mad brain would have snapped
before it did. How my own reason held, I do not know.</p>

<p>No&mdash;it was no dream&mdash;I gazed upon a foul rout of
votaries long dead, come up from Hell to worship as of old;
ghosts that bowed before a ghost. For Hell has long claimed their
hideous god. Long, long he dwelt among the hills, a brain-
shattering vestige of an outworn age, but no longer his obscene
talons clutch for the souls of living men, and his kingdom is a
dead kingdom, peopled only by the ghosts of those who served him
in his lifetime and theirs.</p>

<p>By what foul alchemy or godless sorcery the Gates of Hell are
opened on that one eerie night I do not know, but mine own eyes
have seen. And I know I looked on no living thing that night, for
the manuscript written in the careful hand of Selim Bahadur
narrated at length what he and his raiders found in the valley of
Stregoicavar; and I read, set down in detail, the blasphemous
obscenities that torture wrung from the lips of screaming
worshippers; and I read, too, of the lost, grim black cavern high
in the hills where the horrified Turks hemmed a monstrous,
bloated, wallowing toad-like being and slew it with flame and
ancient steel blessed in old times by Muhammad, and with
incantations that were old when Arabia was young. And even
staunch old Selim's hand shook as he recorded the cataclysmic,
earth-shaking death-howls of the monstrosity, which died not
alone; for half-score of his slayers perished with him, in ways
that Selim would not or could not describe.</p>

<p>And that squat idol carved of gold and wrapped in silk was an
image of <i>himself</i>, and Selim tore it from the golden chain
that looped the neck of the slain high priest of the mask.</p>

<p>Well that the Turks swept out that foul valley with torch and
cleanly steel! Such sights as those brooding mountains have
looked on belong to the darkness and abysses of lost eons.
No&mdash;it is not fear of the toad-thing that makes me shudder
in the night. He is made fast in Hell with his nauseous horde,
freed only for an hour on the most weird night of the year, as I
have seen. And of his worshippers, none remains.</p>

<p>But it is the realization that such things once crouched
beast-like above the souls of men which brings cold sweat to my
brow; and I fear to peer again into the leaves of Von Junzt's
abomination. For now I understand his repeated phrase of
<i>keys</i>!&mdash;aye! Keys to Outer Doors&mdash;links with an
abhorrent past and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;of abhorrent spheres of
the <i>present</i>. And I understand why the cliffs look like
battlements in the moonlight and why the tavern-keeper's
nightmare-haunted nephew saw in his dream, the Black Stone like a
spire on a cyclopean black castle. If men ever excavate among
those mountains they may find incredible things below those
masking slopes. For the cave wherein the Turks trapped
the&mdash;<i>thing</i>&mdash;was not truly a cavern, and I
shudder to contemplate the gigantic gulf of eons which must
stretch between this age and the time when the earth shook
herself and reared up, like a wave, those blue mountains that,
rising, enveloped unthinkable things. May no man ever seek to
uproot that ghastly spire men call the Black Stone!</p>

<p>A Key! Aye, it is a Key, symbol of a forgotten horror. That
horror has faded into the limbo from which it crawled,
loathsomely, in the black dawn of the earth. But what of the
other fiendish possibilities hinted at by Von Junzt&mdash;what of
the monstrous hand which strangled out his life? Since reading
what Selim Bahadur wrote, I can no longer doubt anything in the
Black Book. Man was not always master of the earth&mdash;<i>and
is he now?</i></p>

<p>And the thought recurs to me&mdash;if such a monstrous entity
as the Master of the Monolith somehow survived its own
unspeakably distant epoch so long&mdash;<i>what nameless shapes
may even now lurk in the dark places of the world?</i></p>
