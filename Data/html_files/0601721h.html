  <p class="quote">AND the next instant this great red loon was shaking me like
  a dog shaking a rat. "Where is Meve MacDonnal?" he was screaming. By the
  saints, it's a grisly thing to hear a madman in a lonely place at midnight
  screaming the name of a woman dead three hundred years.&mdash;<i>The
  Longshoreman's Tale.</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>


  <p class="first">"THIS is the cairn you seek," I said, laying my hand
gingerly on one of
  the rough stones which composed the strangely symmetrical heap.</p>

  <p>An avid interest burned in Ortali's dark eyes. His gaze swept the
  landscape and came back to rest on the great pile of massive weather-worn
  boulders.</p>

  <p>"What a wild, weird, desolate place!" he said. "Who would have thought to
  find such a spot in this vicinity? Except for the smoke rising yonder, one
  would scarcely dream that beyond that headland lies a great city! Here there
  is scarcely even a fisherman's hut within sight."</p>

  <p>"The people shun the cairn as they have shunned it for centuries," I
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You've asked me that before," I replied impatiently. "I can only answer
  that they now avoid by habit what their ancestors avoided through
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"Knowledge!" he laughed derisively. "Superstition!"</p>

  <p>I looked at him sombrely with unveiled hate. Two men could scarcely have
  been of more opposite types. He was slender, self-possessed, unmistakably
  Latin with his dark eyes and sophisticated air. I am massive, clumsy and
  bearlike, with cold blue eyes and tousled red hair. We were countrymen in
  that we were born in the same land; but the homelands of our ancestors were
  as far apart as South from North.</p>

  <p>"Nordic superstition," he repeated. "It cannot imagine a Latin people
  allowing such a mystery as this to go unexplored all these years. The Latins
  are too practical&mdash;too prosaic, if you will. Are you sure of the date of this
  pile?"</p>

  <p>"I find no mention of it in any manuscript prior to 1014 A.D.," I growled,
  "and I've read all such manuscripts extant, in the original. MacLiag, King
  Brian Boru's poet, speaks of the rearing of the cairn immediately after the
  battle, and there can be little doubt that this is the pile referred to. It
  is mentioned briefly in the later chronicles of the Four Masters, also in the
  Book of Leinster, compiled in the late 1150's, and again in the Book of
  Lecan, compiled by the MacFirbis about 1416. All connect it with the battle
  of Clontarf, without mentioning why it was built."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is the mystery about it?" he queried. "What more natural than
  that the defeated Norsemen should rear a cairn above the body of some great
  chief who had fallen in the battle?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place," I answered, "there is a mystery concerning the
  existence of it. The building of cairns above the dead was a Norse, not an
  Irish, custom. Yet according to the chroniclers, it was not Norsemen who
  reared this heap. How could they have built it immediately after the battle,
  in which they had been cut to pieces and driven in headlong flight through
  the gates of Dublin? Their chieftains lay where they had fallen and the
  ravens picked their bones. It was Irish hands that heaped these stones."</p>

  <p>"Well, was that so strange?" persisted Ortali. "In old times the Irish
  heaped up stones before they went into battle, each man putting a stone in
  place; after the battle the living removed their stones, leaving in that
  manner a simple tally of the slain for any who wished to count the remaining
  stones."</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"That was in more ancient times; not in the battle of Clontarf. In the
  first place, there were more than twenty thousand warriors, and four thousand
  fell here; this cairn is not large enough to have served as a tally of the
  men killed in battle. And it is too symmetrically built. Hardly a stone has
  fallen away in all these centuries. No, it was reared to cover
  something."</p>

  <p>"Nordic superstitions!" the man sneered again.</p>

  <p>"Aye, superstitions if you will!" Fired by his scorn, I exclaimed so
  savagely that he involuntarily stepped back; his hand slipping inside his
  coat. "We of North Europe had gods and demons before which the pallid
  mythologies of the South fade to childishness. At a time when your ancestors
  were lolling on silken cushions among the crumbling marble pillars of a
  decaying civilization, my ancestors were building their own civilization in
  hardships and gigantic battles against foes human and inhuman.</p>

  <p>"Here on this very plain the Dark Ages came to an end and the light of a
  new era dawned on the world of hate and anarchy. Here, as even you know, in
  the year 1014, Brian Boru and his Dalcassian ax wielders broke the power of
  the heathen Norsemen forever&mdash;those grim anarchistic plunderers who had
  held back the progress of civilization for centuries."</p>

  <p>"It was more than a struggle between Gael and Dane for the crown of
  Ireland. It was a war between the White Christ and Odin, between
  Christian and pagan. It was the last stand of the heathen&mdash;of the people
  of the old, grim ways. For three hundred years the world had writhed beneath
  the heel of the Viking, and here on Clontarf that scourge was lifted
  forever.</p>

  <p>"Then, as now, the importance of that battle was underestimated by polite
  Latin and Latinized writers and historians. The polished sophisticates of the
  civilized cities of the South were not interested in the battles of
  barbarians in the remote northwestern corner of the world&mdash;a place and
  peoples of whose very names they were only vaguely aware. They only knew that
  suddenly the terrible raids of the sea kings ceased to sweep along their
  coasts, and in another century the wild age of plunder and slaughter had
  almost been forgotten&mdash;all because a rude, half-civilized people who
  scantily covered their nakedness with wolf hides rose up against the
  conquerors."</p>

  <p>"Here was Ragnarok, the fall of the Gods! Here in very truth Odin fell,
  for his religion was given its death blow. He was last of all the heathen
  gods to stand before Christianity, and it looked for a time as if his
  children might prevail and plunge the world back into darkness and savagery.
  Before Clontarf, legends say, he often appeared on earth to his worshippers,
  dimly seen in the smoke of the sacrifices where human victims died screaming,
  or riding the wind-torn clouds, his wild locks flying in the gale, or,
  appareled like a Norse warrior, dealing thunderous blows in the forefront of
  nameless battles. But after Clontarf he was seen no more; his worshippers
  called on him in vain with wild chants and grim sacrifices. They lost faith
  in him, who had failed them in their wildest hour; his altars crumbled, his
  priests turned grey and died, and men turned to his conqueror, the
  White Christ. The reign of blood and iron was forgotten; the age of the
  red-handed sea kings passed. The rising sun, slowly, dimly, lighted the night
  of the Dark Ages, and men forgot Odin, who came no more on earth."</p>

  <p>"Aye, laugh if you will! But who knows what shapes of horror have had
  birth in the darkness, the cold gloom; and the whistling black gulfs of the
  North? In the southern lands the sun shines and flowers bloom; under the soft
  skies men laugh at demons. But in the North, who can say what elemental
  spirits of evil dwell in the fierce storms and the darkness? Well may it be
  that from such fiends of the night men evolved the worship of the grim ones,
  Odin and Thor, and their terrible kin."</p>

  <p>Ortali was silent for an instant, as if taken aback by my vehemence; then
  he laughed. "Well said, my northern philosopher! We will, argue these
  questions another time. I could hardly expect a descendant of Nordic
  barbarians to escape some trace of the dreams and mysticism of his race. But
  you cannot expect me to be moved by your imaginings, either. I still
  believe that this cairn covers no grimmer secret than a Norse chief who fell
  in the battle&mdash;and really your ravings concerning Nordic devils have no
  bearing on the matter. Will you help me tear into this cairn?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered shortly.</p>

  <p>"A few hours' work will suffice to lay bare whatever it may hide," he
  continued as if he had not heard. "By the way, speaking of superstitions, is
  there not some wild tale concerning holly connected with this heap?"</p>

  <p>"An old legend says that all trees bearing holly were cut down for a
  league in all directions, for some mysterious reason," I answered sullenly.
  "That's another mystery. Holly was an important part of Norse magic-making.
  The Four Masters tell of a Norseman&mdash;a white bearded ancient of wild
  aspect, and apparently a priest of Odin&mdash;who was slain by the natives
  while attempting to lay a branch of holly on the cairn, a year after the
  battle."</p>

  <p>"Well," he laughed, "I have procured a sprig of holly&mdash;see?&mdash;and
  shall wear it in my lapel; perhaps it will protect me against your
  Nordic devils. I feel more certain than ever that the cairn covers a sea king&mdash;and
  they were always laid to rest with all their riches; golden cups
  and jewel-set sword hilts and silver corselets. I feel that this cairn holds
  wealth, wealth over which clumsy-footed Irish peasants have been stumbling
  for centuries, living in want and dying in hunger. Bah! We shall return here
  at midnight, when we may be fairly certain that we will not be
  interrupted&mdash;and you will aid me at the excavations."</p>

  <p>The last sentence was rapped out in a tone that sent a red surge of
  blood-lust through my brain. Ortali turned and began examining the cairn as he
  spoke, and almost involuntarily my hand reached out stealthily and closed on
  a wicked bit of jagged stone that had become detached from one of the
  boulders. In that instant I was a potential murderer if ever one walked the
  earth. One blow, quick, silent and savage, and I would be free forever from a
  slavery bitter as my Celtic ancestors knew beneath the heels of the
  Vikings.</p>

  <p>As if sensing my thoughts, Ortali wheeled to face me. I quickly slipped
  the stone into my pocket, not knowing whether he noted the action. But he
  must have seen the red killing instinct burning in my eyes, for again he
  recoiled and again his hand sought the hidden revolver.</p>

  <p>But he only said: "I've changed my mind. We will not uncover the cairn
  tonight. Tomorrow night, perhaps. We may be spied upon. Just now I am going
  back to the hotel."</p>

  <p>I made no reply, but turned my back upon him and stalked moodily away in
  the direction of the shore. He started up the slope of the headland beyond
  which lay the city, and when I turned to look at him, he was just crossing
  the ridge, etched, clearly against the hazy sky. If hate could kill, he would
  have dropped dead. I saw him in a red-tinged haze, and the pulses in my
  temples throbbed like hammers.</p>

  <p>I turned back toward the shore, and stopped suddenly. Engrossed with my
  own dark thoughts, I had approached within a few feet of a woman before seeing
  her. She was tall and strongly made, with a strong stern face, deeply lined
  and weather-worn as the hills. She was dressed in a manner strange to me, but
  I thought little of it, knowing the curious styles of clothing worn by
  certain backward types of our people.</p>

  <p>"What would you be doing at the cairn?" she asked in a deep, powerful
  voice. I looked at her in surprise; she spoke in Gaelic, which was not
  strange of itself, but the Gaelic she used I had supposed was extinct as a
  spoken language: it was the Gaelic of scholars, pure, and with a distinctly
  archaic flavour. A woman from some secluded hill country, I thought, where
  the people still spoke the unadulterated tongue of their ancestors.</p>

  <p>"We were speculating on its mystery," I answered in the same tongue,
  hesitantly, however, for though skilled in the more modern form taught in the
  schools, to match her use of the language was a strain on my knowledge of it.
  She shook her head slowly. "I like not the dark man who was with you," she
  said sombrely. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm an American, though born and raised here," I answered. "My name is
  James O'Brien."</p>

  <p>A strange light gleamed in her cold eyes.</p>

  <p>"O'Brien&mdash;You are of my clan. I was born an O'Brien. I married a man
  of the MacDonnals, but my heart was ever with the folk of my blood."</p>

  <p>"You live hereabouts?" I queried, my mind on her unusual accent.</p>

  <p>"Aye, I lived here upon a time," she answered, "but I have been far away
  for a long time. All is changed&mdash;changed. I would not have returned, but
  I was drawn back by a call you would not understand. Tell me, would you open
  the cairn?"</p>

  <p>I started and gazed at her closely, deciding that she had somehow
  overheard our conversation.</p>

  <p>"It is not mine to say," I answered bitterly. "Ortali, my companion&mdash;he
  will doubtless open it and I am constrained to aid him. Of my own will I
  would not molest it."</p>

  <p>Her cold eyes bored into my soul.</p>

  <p>"Fools rush blind to their doom," she said sombrely. "What does this man
  know of the mysteries of this ancient land? Deeds have been done here whereof
  the world re-echoed. Yonder, in the long ago, when Tomar's Wood rose dark and
  rustling against the plain of Contarf, and the Danish walls of Dublin loomed
  south of the river Liffey, the ravens fed on the slain and the setting sun
  lighted lakes of crimson. There King Brian, your ancestor and mine, broke the
  spears of the North. From all lands they came, and from the isles of the sea;
  they came in gleaming mail and their horned helmets cast long shadows across
  the land. Their dragon-prows thronged the waves and the sound of their oars
  was as the beat of a storm.</p>

  <p>"On yonder plain the heroes fell like ripe wheat before the reaper. There
  fell Jarl Sigurd of the Orkneys, and Brodir of Man, last of the sea kings,
  and all their chiefs. There fell, too, Prince Murrough and his son, Turlogh,
  and many chieftains of the Gael, and King Brian Boru himself, Erin's
  mightiest monarch."</p>

  <p>"True!" My imagination was always fired by the epic tales of the land of
  my birth. "Blood of mine was spilled here, and, though I have passed the best
  part of my life in a far land, there are ties of blood to bind my soul to
  this shore."</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly, and from beneath her robes drew forth something that
  sparkled dully in the setting sun.</p>

  <p>"Take this," she said. "As a token of blood tie, I give it to you. I feel
  strange and monstrous happenings&mdash;but this will keep you safe
  from evil and the people of the night. Beyond reckoning of man, it is
  holy."</p>

  <p>I took it, wonderingly. It was a crucifix of curiously, worked gold, set
  with tiny jewels. The workmanship was extremely achaic and unmistakably
  Celtic. And vaguely within me stirred a memory of a long-lost relic described
  by forgotten monks in dim manuscripts.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" I exclaimed. "This is&mdash;this must be&mdash;this can
  be nothing less than the lost crucifix of Saint Brandon the Blessed!"</p>

  <p>"Aye." She inclined her grim head. "Saint Brandon's cross, fashioned by
  the hands of the holy man in long ago, before the Norse barbarians made Erin
  a red hell&mdash;in the days when a golden peace and holiness ruled the
  land."</p>

  <p>"But, woman!" I exclaimed wildly. "I cannot accept this as a gift from
  you! You cannot know its value! Its intrinsic worth alone is equal to a
  fortune; as a relic it is priceless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Her deep voice struck me suddenly silent. "Have done with such
  talk, which is sacrilege. The cross of Saint Brandon is beyond price. It was
  never stained with gold; only as a free gift has it ever changed hands. I
  give it to you to shield you against the powers of evil. Say no more."</p>

  <p>"But it has been lost for three hundred years!" I exclaimed.
  "How&mdash;where...?"</p>

  <p>"A holy man gave it to me long ago," she answered. "I hid it in my bosom&mdash;long
  it lay in my bosom. But now I give it to you; I have come from a
  far country to give it to you, for there are monstrous happening's in the
  wind, and it is sword and shield against the people of the night. An ancient
  evil stirs in its prison, which blind hands of folly may break open; but
  stronger than any evil is the cross of Saint Brandon, which has gathered power
  and strength through the long, long ages since that forgotten evil fell to the
  earth."</p>

  <p>"But who are you?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am Meve MacDonnal," she answered.</p>

  <p>Then, turning without a word, she strode away in the deepening twilight
  while I stood bewildered and watched her cross the headland and pass from
  sight, turning inland as she topped the ridge. Then I, too, shaking myself
  like a man waking from a dream, went slowly up the slope and across the
  headland. When I crossed the ridge it was as if I had passed out of one world
  into another: behind me lay the wilderness and desolation of a weird medieval
  age; before me pulsed the lights and the roar of modern Dublin. Only one
  archaic touch was lent to the scene before me: some distance inland loomed
  the straggling and broken lines of an ancient graveyard, long deserted and
  grown up in weeds, barely discernible in the dusk. As I looked I saw a tall
  figure moving ghostily among the crumbling tombs, and I shook my head
  bewilderedly. Surely Meve MacDonnal was touched with madness, living in the
  past, like one seeking to stir to flame the ashes of dead yesterday. I set
  out toward where, in the near distance, began the straggling
  window&mdash;gleams that grew into the swarming ocean of lights that was
  Dublin.</p>

  <p>Back at the suburban hotel where Ortali and I had our rooms, I did not
  speak to him of the cross the woman had given me. In that, at least, he
  should not share: I intended keeping it until she requested its return, which
  I felt sure she, would do. Now as I recalled her appearance, the strangeness
  of her costume returned to me, with one item which had impressed itself on my
  subconscious mind at the time, but which I had not consciously realized. Meve
  MacDonnal had been wearing sandals of a type not worn in Ireland for
  centuries. Well, it was perhaps natural that with her retrospective nature
  she should imitate the apparel of the past ages which seemed to claim all her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>I turned the cross reverently in my hands. There was no doubt that it was
  the very cross for which antiquarians had searched so long in vain, and at
  last in despair had denied the existence of. The priestly scholar, Michael
  O'Rourke, in a treatise written about 1690, described the relic at length,
  chronicled its history exhaustively, and maintained that it was last heard of
  in the possession of Bishop Liam O'Brien, who, dying in 1595, gave it into
  the keeping of a kinswoman; but who this woman was, it was never known, and
  O'Rourke maintained that she kept her possession of the cross a secret, and
  that it was laid away with her in her tomb.</p>

  <p>At another time my elation at discovering the relic would have been
  extreme, but, at the time, my mind was too filled with hate and smouldering
  fury. Replacing the cross in my pocket, I fell moodily to reviewing my
  connections with Ortali, connections which puzzled my friends, but which were
  simple enough.</p>

  <p>Some years before I had been connected with a certain large university in
  a humble way. One of the professors with whom I worked&mdash;a man named
  Reynolds&mdash;was of intolerably overbearing disposition toward those whom
  he considered his inferiors. I was a poverty-ridden student striving for life
  in a system which makes the very existence of a scholar precarious. I bore
  Professor Reynolds' abuse as long as I could, but one day we clashed.</p>

  <p>The reason does not matter; it was trivial enough in itself. Because I
  dared reply to his insults, Reynolds struck me and I knocked him
  senseless.</p>

  <p>That very day he caused my dismissal from the university. Facing not only
  an abrupt termination of my work and studies, but actual starvation, I was
  reduced to desperation, and I went to Reynolds' study late that night
  intending to thrash him within an inch of his life. I found him alone in his
  study, but the moment I entered, he sprang up and rushed at me like a wild
  beast, with a dagger he used for a paperweight. I did not strike him; I did
  not even touch him. As I stepped aside to avoid his rush; a small rug slipped
  beneath his charging feet. He fell headlong, and, to my horror, in his fall
  the dagger in his hand was driven into his heart. He died instantly. I was at
  once aware of my position, I was known to have quarreled; and even exchanged
  blows with the man. I had every reason to hate him. If I were found in the
  study with the dead man, no jury in the world would believe that I had not
  murdered him. I hurriedly left by the way I had come, thinking that I had
  been unobserved. But Ortali, the dead man's secretary, had seen me. Returning
  from a dance, he had observed me entering the premises, and, following me,
  had seen the whole affair through the window. But this I did not know until
  later.</p>

  <p>The body was found by the professor's housekeeper, and naturally there was
  a great stir. Suspicion pointed to me, but lack of evidence kept me from
  being indicted, and this same lack of evidence brought about a verdict of
  suicide. All this time Ortali had kept quiet. Now he came to me and disclosed
  what he knew. He knew, of course, that I had not killed Reynolds, but he
  could prove that I was in the study when the professor met his death, and I
  knew Ortali was capable of carrying out his threat of swearing that he had
  seen me murder Reynolds in cold blood. And thus began a systematic
  blackmail.</p>

  <p>I venture to say that a stranger blackmail was never levied. I had no
  money then; Ortali was gambling on my future, for he was assured of my
  abilities. He advanced me money, and, by clever wire-pulling, got me an
  appointment in a large college. Then he sat back to reap the benefits of his
  scheming, and he reaped full fold of the seed he sowed. In my line I became
  eminently successful. I soon commanded an enormous salary in my regular work,
  and I received rich prizes and awards for researches of various difficult
  natures, and of these Ortali took the lion's share&mdash;in money at least. I
  seemed to have the Midas touch. Yet of the wine of my success I tasted only
  the dregs.</p>

  <p>I scarcely had a cent to my name. The money that had flowed through my
  hands had gone to enrich my slaver, unknown to the world. A man of remarkable
  gifts, he could have gone to the heights in any line, but for a queer streak
  in him, which, coupled with an inordinately avaricious nature, made him a
  parasite, a blood-sucking leech.</p>

  <p>This trip to Dublin had been in the nature of a vacation for me. I was
  worn out with study and labor. But he had somehow heard of Grimmin's Cairn,
  as it was called, and, like a vulture that scents dead flesh, he conceived
  himself on the track of hidden gold. A golden wine cup would have been, to
  him, sufficient reward for the labour of tearing into the pile, and reason
  enough for desecrating or even destroying the ancient landmark. He was a
  swine whose only god was gold.</p>

  <p>Well, I thought grimly, as I disrobed for bed, all things end, both good
  and bad. Such a life as I had lived was unbearable. Ortali had dangled the
  gallows before my eyes until it had lost its terrors. I had staggered beneath
  the load I carried because of my love for my work. But all human endurance
  has its limits. My hands turned to iron as I thought of Ortali, working
  beside me at midnight at the lonely cairn. One stroke, with such a stone as I
  had caught up that day, and my agony would be ended. That life and hopes and
  career and ambition would be ended as well, could not be helped. Ah, what a
  sorry, sorry end to all my high dreams! When a rope and the long drop through
  the black trap should cut short an honorable career and a useful life! And
  all because of a human vampire who feasted his rotten lust on my soul, and
  drove me to murder and ruin.</p>

  <p>But I knew my fate was written in the iron books of doom. Sooner or later
  I would turn on Ortali and kill him, be the consequences what they might. And
  I had reached the end of my road. Continual torture had rendered me, I believe,
  partly insane. I knew that at Grimmin's Cairn, when we toiled at midnight,
  Ortali's life would end beneath my hands, and my own life be cast away.</p>

  <p>Something fell out of my pocket and I picked it up. It was the piece of
  sharp stone I had caught up off the cairn. Looking at it moodily, I wondered
  what strange hands had touched it in old times, and what grim secret it
  helped to hide on the bare headland of Grimmin. I switched out the light and
  lay in the darkness, the stone still in my hand, forgotten, occupied with my
  own dark broodings. And I glided gradually into deep slumber.</p>

  <p>At first I was aware that I was dreaming, as people often are. All was dim
  and vague, and connected in some strange way, I realized, with the bit of
  stone still grasped in my sleeping hand. Gigantic, chaotic scenes and
  landscapes and events shifted before me, like clouds that rolled and tumbled
  before a gale. Slowly these settled and crystallized into one distinct
  landscape, familiar and yet wildly strange. I saw a broad bare plain, fringed
  by the grey sea on one side, and a dark, rustling forest on the other; this
  plain was cut by a winding river, and beyond this river I saw a
  city&mdash;such a city as my waking eyes had never seen: bare, stark,
  massive, with the grim architecture of an earlier, wilder age. On the plain I
  saw, as in a mist, a mighty battle. Serried ranks rolled backward and
  forward, steel flashed like a sunlit sea, and men fell like ripe wheat
  beneath the blades. I saw men in wolfskins, wild and shock-headed, wielding
  dripping axes, and tall men in horned helmets, and glittering mail, whose
  eyes were cold and blue as the sea. And I saw myself.</p>

  <p>Yes, in my dream I saw and recognized, in a semi-detached way, myself. I
  was tall and rangily powerful; I was shock-headed and naked but for a
  wolf-hide girt about my loins. I ran among the ranks yelling and smiting with
  a red ax, and blood ran down my flanks from wounds I scarcely felt. My eyes
  were cold blue and my shaggy hair and beard were red.</p>

  <p>Now for an instant I was cognizant of my dual personality, aware that I
  was at once the wild man who ran and smote with the gory ax, and the man who
  slumbered and dreamed across the centuries. But this sensation quickly faded.
  I was no longer aware of any personality other than that of the barbarian who
  ran and smote. James O'Brien had no existence; I was Red Cumal, kern of Brian
  Boru, and my ax was dripping with the blood of my foes.</p>

  <p>The roar of conflict was dying away, though here and there struggling
  clumps of warriors still dotted the plain. Down along the river, half-naked
  tribesmen, waist-deep in reddening water, tore and slashed with helmeted
  warriors whose mail could not save them from the stroke of the Dalcassian ax.
  Across the river a bloody, disorderly horde was staggering through the gates
  of Dublin.</p>

  <p>The sun was sinking low toward the horizon. All day I had fought beside
  the chiefs. I had seen Jarl Sigurd fall beneath Prince Murrough's sword. I
  had seen Murrough himself die in the moment of victory, by the hand of a grim
  mailed giant whose name none knew. I had seen, in the flight of the enemy,
  Brodir and King Brian fall together at the door of the great king's tent.</p>

  <p>Aye, it had been a feasting of ravens, a red flood of slaughter, and I
  knew that no more would the dragon-prowed fleets sweep from the blue North
  with torch and destruction. Far and wide the Vikings lay in their glittering
  mail, as the ripe wheat lies after the reaping. Among them lay thousands of
  bodies clad in the wolf hides of the tribes, but the dead of the Northern
  people far outnumbered the dead of Erin. I was weary and sick of the stench
  of raw blood. I had glutted my soul with slaughter; now I sought plunder. And
  I found it&mdash;on the corpse of a richly-clad Norse chief which lay close
  to the seashore. I tore off the silver-scaled corselet, the horned helmet.
  They fitted as if made for me, and I swaggered among the dead, calling on my
  wild comrades to admire my appearance, though the harness felt strange to me,
  for the Gaels scorned armour and fought half-naked.</p>

  <p>In my search for loot I had wandered far out on the plain, away from the
  river, but still the mail-clad bodies lay thickly strewn, for the bursting of
  the ranks had scattered fugitives and pursuers all over the countryside, from
  the dark waving Wood of Tomar, to the river and the seashore. And on the
  seaward slope of Drumna's headland, out of sight of the city and the plain of
  Clontarf, I came suddenly upon a dying warrior. He was tall and massive, clad
  in grey mail. He lay partly in the folds of a great dark cloak, and his sword
  lay broken near his mighty right hand. His horned helmet had fallen from his
  head and his elf-locks blew in the wind that swept out of the west.</p>

  <p>Where one eye should have been was an empty socket, and the other eye
  glittered cold and grim as the North Sea, though it was glazing with approach
  of death. Blood oozed from a rent in his corselet. I approached him warily, a
  strange cold fear, that I could not understand, gripping me. Ax ready to dash
  out his brains, I bent over him, and recognized him as the chief who had
  slain Prince Murrough, and who had mown down the warriors of the Gael like a
  harvest. Wherever he had fought, the Norsemen had prevailed, but in all
  other parts of the field, the Gaels had been irresistible.</p>

  <p>And now he spoke to me in Norse and I understood, for had I not toiled as
  slave among the sea people for long bitter years?</p>

  <p>"The Christians have overcome," he gasped in a voice whose timbre, though
  low-pitched, sent a curious shiver of fear through me; there was in it an
  undertone as of icy waves sweeping along a Northern shore, as of freezing
  winds whispering among the pine trees. "Doom and shadows stalk on Asgaard and
  here has fallen Ragnarok. I could not be in all parts of the field at once,
  and now I am wounded unto death. A spear&mdash;a spear with a cross carved in
  the blade; no other weapon could wound me."</p>

  <p>I realized that the chief, seeing mistily my red beard and the Norse
  armour I wore, supposed me to be one of his own race. But crawling horror
  surged darkly in the depths of my soul.</p>

  <p>"White Christ, thou hast not yet conquered," he muttered deliriously.
  "Lift me up, man, and let me speak to you."</p>

  <p>Now for some reason I complied, and, as I lifted him to a sitting posture,
  I shuddered and my flesh crawled at the feel of him, for his flesh was like
  ivory&mdash;smoother and harder than is natural for human flesh, and colder
  than even a dying man should be.</p>

  <p>"I die as men die," he muttered. "Fool, to assume the attributes of
  mankind, even though it was to aid the people who deify me. The gods are
  immortal, but flesh can perish, even when it clothes a god. Haste and bring a
  sprig of the magic plant&mdash;even holly&mdash;and lay it on my bosom. Aye,
  though it be no larger than a dagger point, it will free me from this fleshy
  prison I put on when I came to war with men with their own weapons. And I
  will shake off this flesh and stalk once more among the thundering clouds.
  Woe, then, to all men who bend not the knee to me! Haste; I will await your
  coming."</p>

  <p>His lion-like head fell back, and feeling shudderingly under his corselet,
  I could distinguish no heartbeat. He was dead, as men die, but I knew that
  locked in that semblance of a human body, there but slumbered the spirit of a
  fiend of the frost and darkness.</p>

  <p>Aye, I knew him: Odin, the Grey Man, the One-eyed, the god of the North
  who had taken the form of a warrior to fight for his people. Assuming the
  form of a human, he was subject to many of the limitations of humanity. All
  men knew this of the gods, who often walked the earth in the guise of men.
  Odin, clothed in human semblance, could be wounded by certain weapons, and
  even slain, but a touch of the mysterious holly, would rouse him in grisly
  resurrection. This task he had set me, not knowing me for an enemy; in human
  form he could only use human faculties, and these had been impaired by
  onstriding death.</p>

  <p>My hair stood up and my flesh crawled. I tore from my body the Norse
  armour, and fought a wild panic that prompted me to run blind and screaming
  with terror across the plain. Nauseated with fear, I gathered boulders and
  heaped them for a rude couch, and on it, shaking with horror, I lifted the
  body of the Norse god. And as the sun set and the stars came silently out, I
  was working with fierce energy, piling huge rocks above the corpse. Other
  tribesmen came up and I told them of what I was sealing up&mdash;I hoped
  forever. And they, shivering with horror, fell to aiding me. No sprig of
  magic holly should be laid on Odin's terrible bosom. Beneath these rude
  stones the Northern demon should slumber until the thunder of Judgment Day,
  forgotten by the world which had once cried out beneath his iron heel. Yet
  not wholly forgotten, for, as we laboured, one of my comrades said: "This
  shall be no longer Drumna's Headland, but the Headland of the Grey Man."</p>

  <p>That phrase established a connection between my dream-self and my
  sleeping-self. I started up from sleep exclaiming: "Grey Man's Headland!"</p>

  <p>I looked about dazedly, the furnishings of the room, faintly lighted by
  the starlight in the windows, seeming strange and unfamiliar until I slowly
  oriented myself with time and space.</p>

  <p>"Grey Man's Headland," I repeated, "Grey
  Man&mdash;Greymin&mdash;Grimmin&mdash;<i>Grimmin's Headland!</i> Great God, the
  thing under the cairn!"</p>

  <p>Shaken, I sprang up, and realized that I still gripped the piece of stone
  from the cairn. It is well known that inanimate objects retain psychic
  associations. A round stone from the plain of Jericho has been placed in the
  hand of a hypnotized medium, and she has at once reconstructed in her mind
  the battle and siege of the city, and the shattering fall of the walls. I did
  not doubt that this bit of stone had acted as a magnet to drag my modern mind
  through the mists of the centuries into a life I had known before.</p>

  <p>I was more shaken than I can describe, for the whole fantastic affair
  fitted in too well with certain formless vague sensations concerning the
  cairn which had already lingered at the back of my mind, to be dismissed as
  an unusually vivid dream. I felt the need of a glass of wine, and remembered
  that Ortali always had wine in his room. I hurriedly donned my clothes,
  opened my door, crossed the corridor and was about to, knock at Ortali's
  door, when I noticed that it was partly open, as if someone had neglected to
  close it carefully. I entered, switching on a light. The room was empty.</p>

  <p>I realized what had occurred. Ortali mistrusted me; he feared to risk
  himself alone with me in a lonely spot at midnight. He had postponed the
  visit to the cairn merely to trick me, to give himself a chance to slip away
  alone.</p>

  <p>My hatred for Ortali was for the moment completely submerged by a wild
  panic of horror at the thought of what the opening of the cairn might result
  in. For I did not doubt the authenticity of my dream. It was no dream; it was
  a fragmentary bit of memory, in which I had relived that other life of mine.
  Grey Man's Headland&mdash;Grimmin's Headland, and under those rough stones
  that grisly corpse in its semblance of humanity. I could not hope that,
  imbued with the imperishable essence of an elemental spirit, that corpse had
  crumbled to dust in the ages.</p>

  <p>Of my race out of the city and across those semi-desolate reaches, I
  remember little. The night was a cloak of horror through which peered red
  stars like the gloating eyes of uncanny beasts, and my footfalls echoed
  hollowly so that repeatedly I thought some monster loped at my heels.</p>

  <p>The straggling lights fell away behind me and I entered the region of
  mystery and horror. No wonder that progress had passed to the right and to
  the left of this spot, leaving it untouched, a blind back-eddy given over to
  goblin-dreams and nightmare memories. Well that so few suspected its very
  existence.</p>

  <p>Dimly I saw the headland, but fear gripped me and held me aloof. I had a
  vague, incoherent idea of finding the ancient woman; Meve MacDonnal. She was
  grown old in the mysteries and traditions of the mysterious land. She could
  aid me, if indeed the blind fool Ortali loosed on the world the forgotten
  demon men once worshipped in the North.</p>

  <p>A figure loomed suddenly in the starlight and I caromed against him,
  almost upsetting him. A stammering voice in a thick brogue protested with the
  petulance of intoxication. It was a burly longshoreman returning to his
  cottage, no doubt, from some late revel in a tavern. I seized him and shook
  him, my eyes glaring wildly in the starlight.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for Meve MacDonnal! Do you know her? Tell me, you fool! Do
  you know old Meve MacDonnal?"</p>

  <p>It was as if my words sobered him as suddenly as a dash of icy water in
  his face. In the starlight I saw his face glimmer whitely and a catch of fear
  was at his throat. He sought to cross himself with an uncertain hand.</p>

  <p>"Meve MacDonnal! Are ye mad? What would ye be doin' with <i>her?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" I shrieked, shaking him savagely. "Where is Meve
  MacDonnal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There!" he gasped, pointing with a shaking hand, where dimly in the night
  something loomed against the shadows. "In the name of the holy saints,
  begone, be ye madman or devil, and I am an honest man alone! There, there
  ye'll find Meve MacDonnal&mdash;where they laid her, full three hundred years
  ago!"</p>

  <p>Half heeding his words, I flung him aside with a fierce exclamation, and,
  as I raced across the weed-grown plain, I heard the sound of his lumbering
  flight. Half blind with panic, I came to the low structure the man had
  pointed out. And floundering deep in weeds, my feet sinking into the musty
  mould, I realized with a shock that I was in the ancient graveyard on the
  inland side of Grimmin's Headland, into which I had seen Meve MacDonnal
  disappear the evening before. I was close by the door of the largest tomb,
  and with an eerie premonition I leaned close, seeking to make out the deeply
  carven inscription. And partly by the dim light of the stars and partly by
  the touch of my tracing fingers, I made out the words and figures, in the
  half-forgotten Gaelic of three centuries ago: Meve
  MacDonnal&mdash;1565-1640.</p>

  <p>With a cry of horror, I recoiled and, snatching out the crucifix she had
  given me, made to hurl it into the darkness&mdash;but it was as if an
  invisible hand caught my wrist. Madness and insanity&mdash;but I could not
  doubt: Meve MacDonnal had come to me from the tomb wherein she had rested for
  three hundred years to give me, the ancient, ancient relic entrusted to her
  so long ago by her priestly kin. The memory of her words came to me, and the
  memory of Ortali and the Grey Man. From a lesser horror I turned squarely to
  a greater, and ran swiftly toward the headland which loomed dimly against the
  stars toward the sea.</p>

  <p>As I crossed the ridge I saw, in the starlight, the cairn, and the figure
  that toiled gnome-like above it. Ortali, with his accustomed, almost
  superhuman energy, had dislodged many of the boulders; and as I approached,
  shaking with horrified anticipation, I saw him tear aside the last layer, and
  I heard his savage cry of triumph that froze me in my tracks some yards behind
  him, looking down from the slope. An unholy radiance rose from the cairn, and
  I saw, in the north, the aurora came up suddenly with terrible beauty, paling
  the starlight. All about the cairn pulsed a weird light, turning the rough
  stones to a cold shimmering silver, and in this glow I saw Ortali, all
  heedless, cast aside his pick and lean gloatingly over the aperture he had
  made&mdash;and I saw there the helmeted head, reposing on the couch of stones
  where I, Red Cumal, had placed it so long ago. I saw the inhuman terror and
  beauty of that awesome carven face, in which was neither human weakness, pity
  nor mercy. I saw the soul-freezing glitter of the one eye, which stared wide
  open in a fearful semblance of life. All up and down the tall mailed figure
  shimmered and sparkled cold darts and gleams of icy light; like the northern
  lights that blazed in the shuddering skies. Aye, the Grey Man lay as I had
  left him more than nine hundred years before, without trace of rust or rot or
  decay.</p>

  <p>And now as Ortali leaned forward to examine his find, a gasping cry broke
  from his lips&mdash;for the sprig of holly, worn in his lapel in defiance of
  "Nordic superstition," slipped from its place, and in the weird glow I
  plainly saw it fall upon the mighty mailed breast of the figure, where it
  blazed suddenly with a brightness too dazzling for human eyes. My cry was
  echoed by Ortali. The figure moved; the mighty limbs flexed, tumbling the
  shining stones aside. A new gleam lighted the terrible eye, and a tide of
  life flooded and animated the carven features.</p>

  <p>Out of the cairn he rose, and the northern lights played terribly about
  him. And the Grey Man changed and altered in horrific transmutation. The human
  features faded like a fading mask; the armour fell from his body and crumbled
  to dust as it fell; and the fiendish spirit of ice and frost and darkness
  that the sons of the North deified as Odin, stood nakedly and terribly in
  the stars. About his grisly head played lightnings and the shuddering gleams
  of the aurora. His towering anthropomorphic form was dark as shadow and
  gleaming as ice; his horrible crest reared colossally against the vaulting
  arch of the sky.</p>

  <p>Ortali cowered, screaming wordlessly, as the taloned, malformed hands
  reached for him. In the shadowy, indescribable features of the Thing, there
  was no tinge of gratitude toward the man who had released it&mdash;only a
  demoniac gloating and a demoniac hate for all the sons of men. I saw the
  shadowy arms shoot out and strike. I heard Ortali scream once&mdash;a single,
  unbearable screech that broke short at the shrillest pitch. A single instant
  a blinding blue glare burst about him, lighting his convulsed features and
  his upward-rolling eyes; then his body was dashed earthward as by an electric
  shock, so savagely that I distinctly heard the splintering of his bones. But
  Ortali was dead before he touched the ground&mdash;dead, shrivelled and
  blackened, exactly like a man blasted by a thunderbolt, to which cause,
  indeed, men later ascribed his death.</p>

  <p>The slavering monster that had slain him lumbered now toward me, shadowy,
  tentacle-like arms outspread, the pale starlight making a luminous pool of
  his great inhuman eye, his frightful talons dripping with I know not what
  elemental forces to blast the bodies and souls of men.</p>

  <p>But I flinched not, and in that instant I feared him not, neither the
  horror of his countenance nor the threat of his thunderbolt dooms. For in a
  blinding white flame had come to me the realization of why Meve MacDonnal had
  come from her tomb to bring me the ancient cross which had lain in her bosom
  for three hundred years, gathering unto itself unseen forces of good and
  light, which war forever against the shapes of lunacy and shadow.</p>

  <p>As I plucked from my garments the ancient cross, I felt the play of
  gigantic unseen forces in the air about me. I was but a pawn in the game&mdash;merely
  the hand that held the relic of holiness, that was the symbol
  of the powers opposed forever against the fiends of darkness. As I held it
  high, from it shot a single shaft of white light, unbearably pure, unbearably
  white, as if all the awesome forces of Light were combined in the symbol and
  loosed in one concentrated arrow of wrath against the monster of darkness.
  And with a hideous shriek the demon reeled back, shrivelling before my eyes.
  Then, with a great rush of vulture-like wings, he soared into the stars,
  dwindling dwindling among the play of the flaming fires and the lights of the
  haunted skies, fleeing back into the dark limbo which gave him birth, God
  only knows how many grisly eons ago.</p>
