<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">WHEN James Willoughby, millionaire philanthropist,
realized that the dark, lightless car was deliberately crowding him
into the curb, he acted with desperate decision. Snapping off his
own lights, he threw open the door on the opposite side from the
onrushing stranger, and leaped out, without stopping his own car.
He landed sprawling on all fours, shredding the knees of his
trousers and tearing the skin on his hands. An instant later his
auto crashed cataclysmically into the curb, and the crunch of
crumpled fenders and the tinkle of breaking glass mingled with the
deafening reverberation of a sawed-off shotgun as the occupants of
the mysterious car, not yet realizing that their intended victim
had deserted his automobile, blasted the machine he had just
left.</p>

<p>Before the echoes died away, Willoughby was up and running
through the darkness with an energy remarkable for his years. He
knew that his ruse was already discovered, but it takes longer to
swing a big car around than for a desperately frightened man to
burst through a hedge, and a flitting figure in the darkness is a
poor target. So James Willoughby lived where others had died, and
presently came on foot and in disheveled condition to his home,
which adjoined the park beside which the murderous attempt had been
made. The police, hastening to his call, found him in a condition
of mingled fear and bewilderment. He had seen none of his
attackers; he could give no reason for the attack. All that he
seemed to know was that death had struck at him from the dark,
suddenly, terribly and mysteriously.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was only reasonable to suppose that death would strike again
at its chosen victim, and that was why Brock Rollins, detective,
kept a rendezvous the next evening with one Joey Glick, a
nondescript character of the underworld who served his purpose in
the tangled scheme of things.</p>

<p>Rollins bulked big in the dingy back-room appointed for the
meeting. His massive shoulders and thick body dwarfed his height.
His cold blue eyes contrasted with the thick black hair that
crowned his low broad forehead, and his civilized garments could
not conceal the almost savage muscularity of his hard frame.</p>

<p>Opposite him Joey Glick, never an impressive figure, looked even
more insignificant than usual. And Joey's skin was a pasty grey,
and Joey's fingers shook as he fumbled with a bit of paper on which
was drawn a peculiar design.</p>

<p>"Somebody planted it on me," he chattered. "Right after I phoned
you. In the jamb on the uptown train. Me, Joey Glick! They plant it
on me and I don't even know it. Only one man in this burg handles
dips that slick&mdash;even if I didn't know already.</p>

<p>"Look! It's the death-blossom! The symbol of the Sons of Erlik!
They're after me! They've been shadowing me&mdash;tapping wires.
They know I know too much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come to the point, will you?" grunted Rollins "You said you had
a tip about the gorillas who tried to put the finger on Jim
Willoughby. Quit shaking and spill it. And tell me, cold
turkey&mdash;who was it?"</p>

<p>"The man behind it is Yarghouz Barolass."</p>

<p>Rollins grunted in some surprise.</p>

<p>"I didn't know murder was his racket."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Joey babbled, so scared he was scarcely coherent. His
brain was addled, his speech disjointed. "He's head of the American
branch of the Sons of Erlik&mdash;I know he is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chinese?"</p>

<p>"He's a Mongol. His racket is blackmailing nutty old dames who
fall for his black magic. You know that. But this is bigger.
Listen, you know about Richard Lynch?"</p>

<p>"Sure; got smashed up in an auto wreck by a hit-and-run speed
maniac a week ago. Lay unidentified in a morgue all night before
they discovered who he was. Some crazy loon tried to steal the
corpse off the slab. What's that got to do with Willoughby?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't an accident." Joey was fumbling for a cigarette.
"They meant to get him&mdash;Yarghouz's mob. It was them after the
body that night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you been hitting the pipe?" demanded Rollins harshly.</p>

<p>"No, damn it!" shrilled Joey. "I tell you, Yarghouz was after
Richard Lynch's corpse, just like he's sending his mob after Job
Hopkins' body tomorrow night&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i> Rollins came erect, glaring incredulously.</p>

<p>"Don't rush me," begged Joey, striking a match. "Gimme time.
That death- blossom has got me jumping sideways. I'm
jittery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll say you are," grunted Rollins. "You've been babbling a lot
of stuff that don't mean anything, except it's Yarghouz Barolass
who had Lynch bumped off, and now is after Willoughby. Why? That's
what I want to know. Straighten it out and give me the
low-down."</p>

<p>"Alright," promised Joey, sucking avidly at his cigarette.
"Lemme have a drag. I been so upset I haven't even smoked since I
reached into my pocket for a fag and found that damned
death-flower. This is straight goods. I know why they want the
bodies of Richard Lynch, Job Hopkins and James
Willoughby&mdash;"</p>

<p>With appalling suddenness his hands shot to his throat, crushing
the smoldering cigarette in his fingers. His eyes distended, his
face purpled. Without a word he swayed upright, reeled and crashed
to the floor. With a curse Rollins sprang up, bent over him, ran
skilled hands over his body.</p>

<p>"Dead as Judas Iscariot," swore the detective. "What an infernal
break! I knew his heart would get him some day, if he kept hitting
the pipe&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted suddenly. On the floor where it had fallen beside the
dead man lay the bit of ornamented paper Joey had called the
blossom of death, and beside it lay a crumpled package of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"When did he change his brand?" muttered Rollins. "He never
smoked any kind but a special Egyptian make before; never saw him
use this brand." He lifted the package, drew out a cigarette and
broke it into his hand, smelling the contents gingerly. There was a
faint but definite odor which was not part of the smell of the
cheap tobacco.</p>

<p>"The fellow who slipped that death-blossom into his pocket could
have shifted fags on him just as easy," muttered the detective.
"They must have known he was coming here to talk to me. But the
question is, how much do they know now? They can't know how much or
how little he told me. They evidently didn't figure on him reaching
me at all&mdash;thought he'd take a draw before he got here.
Ordinarily he would have; but this time he was too scared even to
remember to smoke. He needed dope, not tobacco, to steady his
nerve."</p>

<p>Going to the door, he called softly. A stocky bald-headed man
answered his call, wiping his hands on a dirty apron. At the sight
of the crumpled body he recoiled, paling.</p>

<p>"Heart attack, Spike," grunted Rollins. "See that he gets what's
needed." And the big dick thrust a handful of crumpled bills into
Spike's fingers as he strode forth. A hard man, Rollins, but one
mindful of his debts to the dead as well as the living.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was crouched over a telephone.</p>

<p>"This you, Hoolihan?"</p>

<p>A voice booming back over the wires assured him that the chief
of police was indeed at the other end.</p>

<p>"What killed Job Hopkins?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why, heart attack, I understand." There was some surprise in
the chief's voice. "Passed out suddenly, day before yesterday,
while smoking his after-dinner cigar, according to the papers.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Who's guarding Willoughby?" demanded Rollins without
answering.</p>

<p>"Laveaux, Hanson, McFarlane and Harper. But I don't
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not enough," snapped Rollins. "Beat it over there yourself with
three or four more men."</p>

<p>"Say, listen here, Rollins!" came back the irate bellow. "Are
you telling <i>me</i> how to run my business?"</p>

<p>"Right now I am." Rollins' cold hard grin was almost tangible in
his voice. "This happens to be in my particular domain. We're not
fighting white men; it's a gang of River Street yellow-bellies
who've put Willoughby on the spot. I won't say any more right now.
There's been too damned much wire-tapping in this burg. But you
beat it over to Willoughby's as fast as you can get there. Don't
let him out of your sight. Don't let him smoke, eat or drink
anything till I get there. I'll be right on over."</p>

<p>"Okay," came the answer over the wires. "You've been working the
River Street quarter long enough to know what you're doing."</p>

<p>Rollins snapped the receiver back on its hook and strode out
into the misty dimness of River Street, with its furtive hurrying
forms&mdash;stooped alien figures which would have fitted less
incongruously into the scheme of Canton, Bombay or Stamboul.</p>

<p>The big dick walked with a stride even springier than usual, a
more aggressive lurch of his massive shoulders. That betokened
unusual wariness, a tension of nerves. He knew that he was a marked
man, since his talk with Joey Glick. He did not try to fool
himself; it was certain that the spies of the man he was fighting
knew that Joey had reached him before he died. The fact that they
could not know just how much the fellow had told before he died,
would make them all the more dangerous. He did not underestimate
his own position. He knew that if there was one man in the city
capable of dealing with Yarghouz Barolass, it was himself, with his
experience gained from years of puzzling through the devious and
often grisly mysteries of River Street, with its swarms of brown
and yellow inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Taxi?" A cab drew purring up beside the curb, anticipating his
summoning gesture. The driver did not lean out into the light of
the street. His cap seemed to be drawn low, not unnaturally so,
but, standing on the sidewalk, it was impossible for the detective
to tell whether or not he was a white man.</p>

<p>"Sure," grunted Rollins, swinging open the door and climbing in.
"540 Park Place, and step on it."</p>

<p>The taxi roared through the crawling traffic, down shadowy River
Street, wheeled off onto 35th Avenue, crossed over, and sped down a
narrow side street.</p>

<p>"Taking a short cut?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The driver did not look back. His voice ended in a
sudden hissing intake of breath. There was no partition between the
front and back seats. Rollins was leaning forward, his gun jammed
between the shoulders of the driver.</p>

<p>"Take the next right-hand turn and drive to the address I gave
you," he said softly. "Think I can't tell the back of a yellow neck
by the street lamp? You drive, but you drive careful. If you try to
wreck us, I'll fill you full of lead before you can twist that
wheel. No monkey business now; you wouldn't be the first man I've
plugged in the course of duty."</p>

<p>The driver twisted his head about to stare briefly into the grim
face of his captor; his wide thin mouth gaped, his coppery features
were ashy. Not for nothing had Rollins established his reputation
as a man-hunter among the sinister denizens of the Oriental
quarter.</p>

<p>"Joey was right," muttered Rollins between his teeth. "I don't
know your name, but I've seen you hanging around Yarghouz
Barolass's joint when he had it over on Levant Street. You won't
take me for a ride, not tonight. I know that trick, old
copper-face. You'd have a flat, or run out of gas at some
convenient spot. Any excuse for you to get out of the car and out
of range while a hatchet-man hidden somewhere mows me down with a
sawed-off. You better hope none of your friends see us and try
anything, because this gat has a hair-trigger, and it's cocked. I
couldn't die quick enough not to pull the trigger."</p>

<p>The rest of that grim ride was made in silence, until the
reaches of South Park rose to view&mdash;darkened, except for a
fringe of lights around the boundaries, because of municipal
economy which sought to reduce the light bill.</p>

<p>"Swing into the park," ordered Rollins, as they drove along the
street which passed the park, and, further on, James Willoughby's
house. "Cut off your lights, and drive as I tell you. You can feel
your way between the trees."</p>

<p>The darkened car glided into a dense grove and came to a halt.
Rollins fumbled in his pockets with his left hand and drew out a
small flashlight, and a pair of handcuffs. In climbing out, he was
forced to remove his muzzle from close contact with his prisoner's
back, but the gun menaced the Mongol in the small ring of light
emanating from the flash.</p>

<p>"Climb out," ordered the detective. "That's right&mdash;slow and
easy. You're going to have to stay here awhile. I didn't want to
take you to the station right now, for several reasons. One of them
is I didn't want your pals to know I turned the tables on you. I'm
hoping they'll still be patiently waiting for you to bring me into
range of their sawed-offs&mdash;ha, would you?"</p>

<p>The Mongol, with a desperate wrench, struck the flashlight from
the detective's hand, plunging them into darkness.</p>

<p>Rollins' clutching fingers locked like a vise on his adversary's
coat sleeve, and at the same instant he instinctively threw out his
.45 before his belly, to parry the stroke he knew would instantly
come. A knife clashed venomously against the blue steel cylinder,
and Rollins hooked his foot about an ankle and jerked powerfully.
The fighters went down together, and the knife sliced the
detective's coat as they fell. Then his blindingly driven gun
barrel crunched glancingly against a shaven skull, and the
straining form went limp.</p>

<p>Panting and swearing beneath his breath, Rollins retrieved the
flashlight and cuffs, and set to work securing his prisoner. The
Mongol was completely out; it was no light matter to stop a
full-arm swing from Brock Rollins. Had the blow landed solidly it
would have caved in the skull like an egg-shell.</p>

<p>Handcuffed, gagged with strips torn from his coat, and his feet
bound with the same material, the Mongol was placed in the car, and
Rollins turned and strode through the shadows of the park, toward
the eastern hedge beyond which lay James Willoughby's estate. He
hoped that this affair would give him some slight advantage in this
blind battle. While the Mongols waited for him to ride into the
trap they had undoubtedly laid for him somewhere in the city,
perhaps he could do a little scouting unmolested.</p>

<p>James Willoughby's estate adjoined South Park on the east. Only
a high hedge separated the park from his grounds. The big
three-storied house&mdash;disproportionately huge for a
bachelor&mdash;towered among carefully trimmed trees and shrubbery,
amidst a level, shaven lawn. There were lights in the two lower
floors, none in the third. Rollins knew that Willoughby's study was
a big room on the second floor, on the west side of the house. From
that room no light issued between the heavy shutters. Evidently
curtains and shades were drawn inside. The big dick grunted in
approval as he stood looking through the hedge.</p>

<p>He knew that a plainclothes man was watching the house from each
side, and he marked the bunch of shrubbery amidst which would be
crouching the man detailed to guard the west side. Craning his
neck, he saw a car in front of the house, which faced south, and he
knew it to be that of Chief Hoolihan.</p>

<p>With the intention of taking a short cut across the lawn he
wormed through the hedge, and, not wishing to be shot by mistake,
he called softly: "Hey, Harper!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Rollins strode toward the shrubbery.</p>

<p>"Asleep at the post?" he muttered angrily. "Eh, what's
this?"</p>

<p>He had stumbled over something in the shadows of the shrubs. His
hurriedly directed beam shone on the white, upturned face of a man.
Blood dabbled the features, and a crumpled hat lay near by, an
unfired pistol near the limp hand.</p>

<p>"Knocked stiff from behind!" muttered Rollins. "What&mdash;"</p>

<p>Parting the shrub he gazed toward the house. On that side an
ornamental chimney rose tier by tier, until it towered above the
roof. And his eyes became slits as they centered on a window on the
third floor within easy reach of that chimney. On all other windows
the shutters were closed; but these stood open.</p>

<p>With frantic haste he tore through the shrubbery and ran across
the lawn, stooping like a bulky bear, amazingly fleet for one of
his weight. As he rounded the corner of the house and rushed toward
the steps, a man rose swiftly from among the hedges lining the
walk, and covered him, only to lower his gun with an exclamation of
recognition.</p>

<p>"Where's Hoolihan?" snapped the detective.</p>

<p>"Upstairs with old man Willoughby. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Harper's been slugged," snarled Rollins. "Beat it out there;
you know where he was posted. Wait there until I call you. If you
see anything you don't recognize trying to leave the house, plug
it! I'll send out a man to take your place here."</p>

<p>He entered the front door and saw four men in plain clothes
lounging about in the main hall.</p>

<p>"Jackson," he snapped, "take Hanson's place out in front. I sent
him around to the west side. The rest of you stand by for
anything."</p>

<p>Mounting the stair in haste, he entered the study on the second
floor, breathing a sigh of relief as he found the occupants
apparently undisturbed.</p>

<p>The curtains were closely drawn over the windows, and only the
door letting into the hall was open. Willoughby was there, a tall
spare man, with a scimitar sweep of nose and a bony aggressive
chin. Chief Hoolihan, big, bear-like, rubicund, boomed a
greeting.</p>

<p>"All your men downstairs?" asked Rollins.</p>

<p>"Sure; nothin' can get past 'em and I'm stayin' here with Mr.
Willoughby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And in a few minutes more you'd both have been scratching
gravel in Hell," snapped Rollins. "Didn't I tell you we were
dealing with Orientals? You concentrated all your force below,
never thinking that death might slip in on you from above. But I
haven't time to turn out that light. Mr. Willoughby, get over there
in that alcove. Chief, stand in front of him, and watch that door
that leads into the hall. I'm going to leave it open. Locking it
would be useless, against what we're fighting. If anything you
don't recognize comes through it, shoot to kill."</p>

<p>"What the devil are you driving at, Rollins?" demanded
Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"I mean one of Yarghouz Barolass's killers is in this house!"
snapped Rollins. "There may be more than one; anyway, he's
somewhere upstairs. Is this the only stair, Mr. Willoughby? No
back-stair?"</p>

<p>"This is the only one in the house," answered the millionaire.
"There are only bedrooms on the third floor."</p>

<p>"Where's the light button for the hall on that floor?"</p>

<p>"At the head of the stairs, on the left; but you
aren't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take your places and do as I say," grunted Rollins, gliding out
into the hallway.</p>

<p>He stood glaring at the stair which wound up above him, its
upper part masked in shadow. Somewhere up there lurked a soulless
slayer&mdash;a Mongol killer, trained in the art of murder, who
lived only to perform his master's will. Rollins started to call
the men below, then changed his mind. To raise his voice would be
to warn the lurking murderer above. Setting his teeth, he glided up
the stair. Aware that he was limned in the light below, he realized
the desperate recklessness of his action; but he had long ago
learned that he could not match subtlety against the Orient. Direct
action, however desperate, was always his best bet. He did not fear
a bullet as he charged up; the Mongols preferred to slay in
silence; but a thrown knife could kill as promptly as tearing lead.
His one chance lay in the winding of the stair.</p>

<p>He took the last steps with a thundering rush, not daring to use
his flash, plunged into the gloom of the upper hallway, frantically
sweeping the wall for the light button. Even as he felt life and
movement in the darkness beside him, his groping fingers found it.
The scrape of a foot on the floor beside him galvanized him, and as
he instinctively flinched back, something whined past his breast
and thudded deep into the wall. Then under his frenzied fingers,
light flooded the hall.</p>

<p>Almost touching him, half crouching, a copper-skinned giant with
a shaven head wrenched at a curved knife which was sunk deep in the
woodwork. He threw up his head, dazzled by the light, baring yellow
fangs in a bestial snarl.</p>

<p>Rollins had just left a lighted area. His eyes accustomed
themselves more swiftly to the sudden radiance. He threw his left
like a hammer at the Mongol's jaw. The killer swayed and fell out
cold.</p>

<p>Hoolihan was bellowing from below.</p>

<p>"Hold everything," answered Rollins. "Send one of the boys up
here with the cuffs. I'm going through these bedrooms."</p>

<p>Which he did, switching on the lights, gun ready, but finding no
other lurking slayer. Evidently Yarghouz Barolass considered one
would be enough. And so it might have been, but for the big
detective.</p>

<p>Having latched all the shutters and fastened the windows
securely, he returned to the study, whither the prisoner had been
taken. The man had recovered his senses and sat, handcuffed, on a
divan. Only the eyes, black and snaky, seemed alive in the
copperish face.</p>

<p>"Mongol alright," muttered Rollins. "No Chinaman."</p>

<p>"What is all this?" complained Hoolihan, still upset by the
realization that an invader had slipped through his cordon.</p>

<p>"Easy enough. This fellow sneaked up on Harper and laid him
cold. Some of these fellows could steal the teeth right out of your
mouth. With all those shrubs and trees it was a cinch. Say, send
out a couple of the boys to bring in Harper, will you? Then he
climbed that fancy chimney. That was a cinch, too. I could do it
myself. Nobody had thought to fasten the shutters on that floor,
because nobody expected an attack from that direction.</p>

<p>"Mr. Willoughby, do you know anything about Yarghouz
Barolass?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of him," declared the philanthropist, and though
Rollins scanned him narrowly, he was impressed by the ring of
sincerity in Willoughby's voice.</p>

<p>"Well, he's a mystic fakir," said Rollins. "Hangs around Levant
Street and preys on old ladies with more money than
sense&mdash;faddists. Gets them interested in Taoism and Lamaism
and then plays on their superstitions and blackmails them. I know
his racket, but I've never been able to put the finger on him,
because his victims won't squeal. But he's behind these attacks on
you."</p>

<p>"Then why don't we go grab him?" demanded Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"Because we don't know where he is. He knows that I know he's
mixed up in this. Joey Glick spilled it to me, just before he
croaked. Yes, Joey's dead&mdash;poison; more of Yarghouz's work. By
this time Yarghouz will have deserted his usual hang-outs, and be
hiding somewhere&mdash;probably in some secret underground dive
that we couldn't find in a hundred years, now that Joey is
dead."</p>

<p>"Let's sweat it out of this yellow-belly," suggested
Hoolihan.</p>

<p>Rollins grinned coldly. "You'd sweat to death yourself before
he'd talk. There's another tied up in a car out in the park. Send a
couple of boys after him, and you can try your hand on both of
them. But you'll get damned little out of them. Come here,
Hoolihan."</p>

<p>Drawing him aside, he said: "I'm sure that Job Hopkins was
poisoned in the same manner they got Joey Glick. Do you remember
anything unusual about the death of Richard Lynch?"</p>

<p>"Well, not about his death; but that night somebody apparently
tried to steal and mutilate his corpse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, mutilate?" demanded Rollins.</p>

<p>"Well, a watchman heard a noise and went into the room and found
Lynch's body on the floor, as if somebody had tried to carry it
off, and then maybe got scared off. And a lot of the <i>teeth</i>
had been pulled or knocked out!"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't explain the teeth," grunted Rollins. "Maybe they
were knocked out in the wreck that killed Lynch. But this is my
hunch: Yarghouz Barolass is stealing the bodies of wealthy men,
figuring on screwing a big price out of their families. When they
don't die quick enough, he bumps them off."</p>

<p>Hoolihan cursed in shocked horror.</p>

<p>"But Willoughby hasn't any family."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon they figure the executors of his estate will
kick in. Now listen: I'm borrowing your car for a visit to Job
Hopkins' vault. I got a tip that they're going to lift his corpse
tomorrow night. I believe they'll spring it tonight, on the chance
that I might have gotten the tip. I believe they'll try to get
ahead of me. They may have already, what with all this delay. I
figured on being out there long before now.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want any help. Your flat-feet are more of a
hindrance than a help in a job like this. You stay here with
Willoughby. Keep men upstairs as well as down. Don't let Willoughby
open any packages that might come, don't even let him answer a
phone call. I'm going to Hopkins' vault, and I don't know when I'll
be back; may roost out there all night. It just depends on
when&mdash;or if&mdash;they come for the corpse."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was speeding down the road on his grim
errand. The graveyard which contained the tomb of Job Hopkins was
small, exclusive, where only the bones of rich men were laid to
rest. The wind moaned through the cypress trees which bent
shadow-arms above the gleaming marble.</p>

<p>Rollins approached from the back side, up a narrow, tree-lined
side street. He left the car, climbed the wall, and stole through
the gloom, beneath the pallid shafts, under the cypress shadows.
Ahead of him Job Hopkins' tomb glimmered whitely. And he stopped
short, crouching low in the shadows. He saw a glow&mdash;a spark of
light&mdash;it was extinguished, and through the open door of the
tomb trooped half a dozen shadowy forms. His hunch had been right,
but they had gotten there ahead of him. Fierce anger sweeping him
at the ghoulish crime, he leaped forward, shouting a savage
command.</p>

<p>They scattered like rats, and his crashing volley re-echoed
futilely among the sepulchers. Rushing forward recklessly, swearing
savagely, he came into the tomb, and turning his light into the
interior, winced at what he saw. The coffin had been burst open,
but the tomb itself was not empty. In a careless heap on the floor
lay the embalmed corpse of Job Hopkins&mdash;<i>and the lower
jawbone had been sawed away.</i></p>

<p>"What the Hell!" Rollins stopped short, bewildered at the sudden
disruption of his theory. "They didn't want the body. What did they
want? His teeth? And they got Richard Lynch's teeth&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lifting the body back into its resting place, he hurried forth,
shutting the door of the tomb behind him. The wind whined through
the cypress, and mingled with it was a low moaning sound. Thinking
that one of his shots had gone home, after all, he followed the
noise, warily, pistol and flash ready.</p>

<p>The sound seemed to emanate from a bunch of low cedars near the
wall, and among them he found a man lying. The beam revealed the
stocky figure, the square, now convulsed face of a Mongol. The
slant eyes were glazed, the back of the coat soaked with blood. The
man was gasping his last, but Rollins found no trace of a bullet
wound on him. In his back, between his shoulders, stood up the hilt
of a curious skewer-like knife. The fingers of his right hand had
been horribly gashed, as if he had sought to retain his grasp on
something which his slayers desired.</p>

<p>"Running from me he bumped into somebody hiding among these
cedars," muttered Rollins. "But who? And why? By God, Willoughby
hasn't told me everything."</p>

<p>He stared uneasily at the crowding shadows. No stealthy
shuffling footfall disturbed the sepulchral quiet. Only the wind
whimpered through the cypress and the cedars. The detective was
alone with the dead&mdash;with the corpses of rich men in their
ornate tombs, and with the staring yellow man whose flesh was not
yet rigid.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"You're back in a hurry," said Hoolihan, as Rollins entered the
Willoughby study. "Do any good?"</p>

<p>"Did the yellow boys talk?" countered Rollins.</p>

<p>"They did not," growled the chief. "They sat like pot-bellied
idols. I sent 'em to the station, along with Harper. He was still
in a daze."</p>

<p>"Mr. Willoughby," Rollins sank down rather wearily into an
arm-chair and fixed his cold gaze on the philanthropist, "am I
right in believing that you and Richard Lynch and Job Hopkins were
at one time connected with each other in some way?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" parried Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Because somehow the three of you are connected in this matter.
Lynch's death was not accidental, and I'm pretty sure that Job
Hopkins was poisoned. Now the same gang is after you. I thought it
was a body-snatching racket, but an apparent attempt to steal
Richard Lynch's corpse out of the morgue, now seems to resolve
itself into what was in reality a successful attempt to get his
teeth. Tonight a gang of Mongols entered the tomb of Job Hopkins,
obviously for the same purpose&mdash;"</p>

<p>A choking cry interrupted him. Willoughby sank back, his face
livid.</p>

<p>"My God, after all these years!"</p>

<p>Rollins stiffened.</p>

<p>"Then you do know Yarghouz Barolass? You know why he's after
you?"</p>

<p>Willoughby shook his head. "I never heard of Yarghouz Barolass
before. But I know why they killed Lynch and Hopkins."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better spill the works," advised Rollins. "We're
working in the dark as it is."</p>

<p>"I will!" The philanthropist was visibly shaken. He mopped his
brow with a shaking hand, and reposed himself with an effort.</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago," he said, "Lynch, Hopkins and myself, young
men just out of college, were in China, in the employ of the
war-lord Yuen Chin. We were chemical engineers. Yuen Chin was a
far-sighted man&mdash;ahead of his time, scientifically speaking.
He visioned the day when men would war with gases and deadly
chemicals. He supplied us with a splendid laboratory, in which to
discover or invent some such element of destruction for his
use.</p>

<p>"He paid us well; the foundations of all of our fortunes were
laid there. We were young, poor, unscrupulous.</p>

<p>"More by chance than skill we stumbled onto a deadly
secret&mdash;the formula for a poisonous gas, a thousand times more
deadly than anything yet dreamed of. That was what he was paying us
to invent or discover for him, but the discovery sobered us. We
realized that the man who possessed the secret of that gas, could
easily conquer the world. We were willing to aid Yuen Chin against
his Mongolian enemies; we were not willing to elevate a yellow
mandarin to world empire, to see our hellish discovery directed
against the lives of our own people.</p>

<p>"Yet we were not willing to destroy the formula, because we
foresaw a time when America, with her back to the wall, might have
a desperate need for such a weapon. So we wrote out the formula in
code, but left out three symbols, without any of which the formula
is meaningless and undecipherable. Each of us then, had a lower jaw
tooth pulled out, and on the gold tooth put in its place, was
carved one of the three symbols. Thus we took precautions against
our own greed, as well as against the avarice of outsiders. One of
us might conceivably fall so low as to sell the secret, but it
would be useless without the other two symbols.</p>

<p>"Yuen Chin fell and was beheaded on the great execution ground
at Peking. We escaped, Lynch, Hopkins and I, not only with our
lives but with most of the money which had been paid us. But the
formula, scrawled on parchment, we were obliged to leave, secreted
among musty archives in an ancient temple.</p>

<p>"Only one man knew our secret: an old Chinese tooth-puller, who
aided us in the matter of the teeth. He owed his life to Richard
Lynch, and when he swore the oath of eternal silence, we knew we
could trust him."</p>

<p>"Yet you think somebody is after the secret symbols?"</p>

<p>"What else could it be? I cannot understand it. The old
tooth-puller must have died long ago. Who could have learned of it?
Torture would not have dragged the secret from him. Yet it can be
for no other reason that this fellow you call Yarghouz Barolass
murdered and mutilated the bodies of my former companions, and now
is after me.</p>

<p>"Why, I love life as well as any man, but my own peril shrinks
into insignificance compared to the world-wide menace contained in
those little carven symbols&mdash;two of which are now, according
to what you say, in the hands of some ruthless foe of the western
world.</p>

<p>"Somebody has found the formula we left hidden in the temple,
and has learned somehow of its secret. Anything can come out of
China. Just now the bandit war-lord Yah Lai is threatening to
overthrow the National government&mdash;who knows what devilish
concoction that Chinese caldron is brewing?</p>

<p>"The thought of the secret of that gas in the hands of some
Oriental conqueror is appalling. My God, gentlemen, I fear you do
not realize the full significance of the matter!"</p>

<p>"I've got a faint idea," grunted Rollins. "Ever see a dagger
like this?" He presented the weapon that had killed the Mongol.</p>

<p>"Many of them, in China," answered Willoughby promptly.</p>

<p>"Then it isn't a Mongol weapon?"</p>

<p>"No; it's distinctly Chinese; there is a conventional Manchu
inscription on the hilt."</p>

<p>"Ummmmmm!" Rollins sat scowling, chin on fist, idly tapping the
blade against his shoe, lost in meditation. Admittedly, he was all
at sea, lost in a bewildering tangle. To his companions he looked
like a grim figure of retribution, brooding over the fate of the
wicked. In reality he was cursing his luck.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" demanded Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"Only one thing to do," responded Rollins. "I'm going to try to
run down Yarghouz Barolass. I'm going to start with River
Street&mdash;God knows, it'll be like looking for a rat in a swamp.
I want you to contrive to let one of those Mongols escape,
Hoolihan. I'll try to trail him back to Yarghouz's
hangout&mdash;"</p>

<p>The phone tingled loudly.</p>

<p>Rollins reached it with a long stride.</p>

<p>"Who speaks, please?" Over the wire came a voice with a subtle
but definite accent.</p>

<p>"Brock Rollins," grunted the big dick.</p>

<p>"A friend speaks, Detective," came the bland voice. "Before we
progress further, let me warn you that it will be impossible to
trace this call, and would do you no good to do so."</p>

<p>"Well?" Rollins was bristling like a big truculent dog.</p>

<p>"Mr. Willoughby," the suave voice continued, "is a doomed man.
He is as good as dead already. Guards and guns will not save him,
when the Sons of Erlik are ready to strike. But <i>you</i> can save
him, without firing a shot!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" It was a scarcely articulate snarl humming
bloodthirstily from Rollins' bull-throat.</p>

<p>"If you were to come alone to the House of Dreams on Levant
street, Yarghouz Barolass would speak to you, and a compromise
might be arranged whereby Mr. Willoughby's life would be
spared."</p>

<p>"Compromise, Hell!" roared the big dick, the skin over his
knuckles showing white. "Who do you think you're talking to? Think
I'd fall into a trap like that?"</p>

<p>"You have a hostage," came back the voice. "One of the men you
hold is Yarghouz Barolass's brother. Let him suffer if there is
treachery. I swear by the bones of my ancestors, no harm shall come
to you!"</p>

<p>The voice ceased with a click at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>Rollins wheeled.</p>

<p>"Yarghouz Barolass must be getting desperate to try such a
child's trick as that!" he swore. Then he considered, and muttered,
half to himself: "By the bones of his ancestors! Never heard of a
Mongolian breaking <i>that</i> oath. All that stuff about
Yarghouz's brother may be the bunk. Yet&mdash;well, maybe he's
trying to outsmart me&mdash;draw me away from Willoughby&mdash;on
the other hand, maybe he thinks that I'd never fall for a trick
like that&mdash;aw, to Hell with thinking! I'm going to start
acting!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"I mean I'm going to the House of Dreams, alone."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" exclaimed Hoolihan. "Take a squad, surround the
house, and raid it!"</p>

<p>"And find an empty rat-den," grunted Rollins, his peculiar
obsession for working alone again asserting itself.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Dawn was not far away when Rollins entered the smoky den near
the waterfront which was known to the Chinese as the House of
Dreams, and whose dingy exterior masked a subterranean opium joint.
Only a pudgy Chinaboy nodded behind the counter; he looked up with
no apparent surprise. Without a word he led Rollins to a curtain in
the back of the shop, pulled it aside, and revealed a door. The
detective gripped his gun under his coat, nerves taut with
excitement that must come to any man who has deliberately walked
into what might prove to be a death-trap. The boy knocked, lifting
a sing-song monotone, and a voice answered from within. Rollins
started. He recognized that voice. The boy opened the door, bobbed
his head and was gone. Rollins entered, pulling the door to behind
him.</p>

<p>He was in a room heaped and strewn with divans and silk
cushions. If there were other doors, they were masked by the black
velvet hangings, which, worked with gilt dragons, covered the
walls. On a divan near the further wall squatted a stocky,
pot-bellied shape, in black silk, a close-fitting velvet cap on his
shaven head.</p>

<p>"So you came, after all!" breathed the detective. "Don't move,
Yarghouz Barolass. I've got you covered through my coat. Your gang
can't get me quick enough to keep me from getting you first."</p>

<p>"Why do you threaten me, Detective?" Yarghouz Barolass's face
was expressionless, the square, parchment-skinned face of a Mongol
from the Gobi, with wide thin lips and glittering black eyes. His
English was perfect.</p>

<p>"See, I trust you. I am here, alone. The boy who let you in said
that you are alone. Good. You kept your word, I keep my promise.
For the time there is truce between us, and I am ready to bargain,
as you suggested."</p>

<p>"As <i>I</i> suggested?" demanded Rollins.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to harm Mr. Willoughby, any more than I wished
to harm either of the other gentlemen," said Yarghouz Barolass.
"But knowing them all as I did&mdash;from report and discreet
observation&mdash;it never occurred to me that I could obtain what
I wished while they lived. So I did not enter into negotiations
with them."</p>

<p>"So you want Willoughby's tooth, too?"</p>

<p>"Not I," disclaimed Yarghouz Barolass. "It is an honorable
person in China, the grandson of an old man who babbled in his
dotage, as old men often do, drooling secrets torture could not
have wrung from him in his soundness of mind. The grandson, Yah
Lai, has risen from a mean position to that of war-lord. He
listened to the mumblings of his grandfather, a tooth-puller. He
found a formula, written in code, and learned of symbols on the
teeth of old men. He sent a request to me, with promise of much
reward. I have one tooth, procured from the unfortunate person,
Richard Lynch. Now if you will hand over the other&mdash;that of
Job Hopkins&mdash;as you promised, perhaps we may reach a
compromise by which Mr. Willoughby will be allowed to keep his
life, in return for a tooth, as you hinted."</p>

<p>"As <i>I</i> hinted?" exclaimed Rollins. "What are you driving
at? I made no promise; and I certainly haven't Job Hopkins' tooth.
You've got it, yourself."</p>

<p>"All this is unnecessary," objected Yarghouz, an edge to his
tone. "You have a reputation for veracity, in spite of your violent
nature. I was relying upon your reputation for honesty when I
accepted this appointment. Of course, I already knew that you had
Hopkins' tooth. When my blundering servants, having been frightened
by you as they left the vaults, gathered at the appointed
rendezvous, they discovered that he to whom was entrusted the
jaw-bone containing the precious tooth, was not among them. They
returned to the graveyard and found his body, but not the tooth. It
was obvious that you had killed him and taken it from him."</p>

<p>Rollins was so thunderstruck by this new twist, that he remained
speechless, his mind a tangled whirl of bewilderment.</p>

<p>Yarghouz Barolass continued tranquilly: "I was about to send my
servants out in another attempt to secure you, when your agent
phoned me&mdash;though how he located me on the telephone is still
a mystery into which I must inquire&mdash;and announced that you
were ready to meet me at the House of Dreams, and give me Job
Hopkins' tooth, in return for an opportunity to bargain personally
for Mr. Willoughby's life. Knowing you to be a man of honor, I
agreed, trusting you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is madness!" exclaimed Rollins "I didn't call you, or have
anybody call you. <i>You,</i> or rather, one of your men, called
<i>me."</i></p>

<p>"I did not!" Yarghouz was on his feet, his stocky body under the
rippling black silk quivering with rage and suspicion. His eyes
narrowed to slits, his wide mouth knotted viciously.</p>

<p>"You deny that you promised to give me Job Hopkins' tooth?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do!" snapped Rollins. "I haven't got it, and what's
more, I'm not 'compromising' as you call it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Liar!" Yarghouz spat the epithet like a snake hissing. "You
have tricked&mdash;betrayed me&mdash;used my trust in your
blackened honor to dupe me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep cool," advised Rollins. "Remember, I've got a Colt .45
trained on you."</p>

<p>"Shoot and die!" retorted Yarghouz. "I do not know what your
game is, but I know that if you shoot me, we will fall together.
Fool, do you think I would keep my promise to a barbarian dog?
Behind this hanging is the entrance to a tunnel through which I can
escape before any of your stupid police, if you have brought any
with you, can enter this room. You have been covered since you came
through that door, by a man hiding behind the tapestry. Try to stop
me, and you die!"</p>

<p>"I believe you're telling the truth about not calling me," said
Rollins slowly. "I believe somebody tricked us both, for some
reason. You were called, in my name, and I was called, in
yours."</p>

<p>Yarghouz halted short in some hissing tirade. His eyes were like
black evil jewels in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"More lies?" he demanded uncertainly.</p>

<p>"No; I think somebody in your gang is double-crossing you. Now
easy, I'm not pulling a gun. I'm just going to show you the knife
that I found sticking in the back of the fellow you seem to think I
killed."</p>

<p>He drew it from his coat-pocket with his left hand&mdash;his
right still gripped his gun beneath the garment&mdash;and tossed it
on the divan.</p>

<p>Yarghouz pounced on it. His slit eyes flared wide with a
terrible light; his yellow skin went ashen. He cried out something
in his own tongue, which Rollins did not understand.</p>

<p>In a torrent of hissing sibilances, he lapsed briefly into
English: "I see it all now! This was too subtle for a barbarian!
Death to them all!" Wheeling toward the tapestry behind the divan
he shrieked: "Gutchluk!"</p>

<p>There was no answer, but Rollins thought he saw the black
velvety expanse billow slightly. With his skin the color of old
ashes, Yarghouz Barolass ran at the hanging, ignoring Rollins'
order to halt, seized the tapestries, tore them
aside&mdash;something flashed between them like a beam of white hot
light. Yarghouz's scream broke in a ghastly gurgle. His head
pitched forward, then his whole body swayed backward, and he fell
heavily among the cushions, clutching at the hilt of a skewer-like
dagger that quivered upright in his breast. The Mongol's yellow
claw-like hands fell away from the crimsoned hilt, spread wide,
clutching at the thick carpet; a convulsive spasm ran through his
frame, and those taloned yellow fingers went limp.</p>

<p>Gun in hand, Rollins took a single stride toward the
tapestries&mdash;then halted short, staring at the figure which
moved imperturbably through them: a tall yellow man in the robes of
a mandarin, who smiled and bowed, his hands hidden in his wide
sleeves.</p>

<p>"You killed Yarghous Barolass!" accused the detective.</p>

<p>"The evil one indeed has been dispatched to join his ancestors
by my hand," agreed the mandarin. "Be not afraid. The Mongol who
covered you through a peep-hole with an abbreviated shotgun has
likewise departed this uncertain life, suddenly and silently. My
own people hold supreme in the House of Dreams this night. All that
we ask is that you make no attempt to stay our departure."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Rollins.</p>

<p>"But a humble servant of Fang Yin, lord of Peking. When it was
learned that these unworthy ones sought a formula in America that
might enable the upstart Yah Lai to overthrow the government of
China, word was sent in haste to me. It was almost too late. Two
men had already died. The third was menaced."</p>

<p>"I sent my servants instantly to intercept the evil Sons of
Erlik at the vaults they desecrated. But for your appearance,
frightening the Mongols to scattering in flight, before the trap
could be sprang, my servants would have caught them all in ambush.
As it was, they did manage to slay he who carried the relic
Yarghouz sought, and this they brought to me."</p>

<p>"I took the liberty of impersonating a servant of the Mongol in
my speech with you, and of pretending to be a Chinese agent of
yours, while speaking with Yarghouz. All worked out as I wished.
Lured by the thought of the tooth, at the loss of which he was
maddened, Yarghouz came from his secret, well-guarded lair, and
fell into my hands. I brought you here to witness his execution, so
that you might realize that Mr. Willoughby is no longer in danger.
Fang Yin has no ambitions for world empire; he wishes but to hold
what is his. That he is well able to do, now that the threat of the
devil-gas is lifted. And now I must be gone. Yarghouz had laid
careful plans for his flight out of the country. I will take
advantage of his preparations."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" exclaimed Rollins. "I've got to arrest you for
the murder of this rat."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," murmured the mandarin. "I am in much haste. No
need to lift your revolver. I swore that you would not be injured
and I keep my word."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the light went suddenly out. Rollins sprang
forward, cursing, fumbling at the tapestries which had swished in
the darkness as if from the passing of a large body between them.
His fingers met only solid walls, and when at last the light came
on again, he was alone in the room, and behind the hangings a heavy
door had been slid shut. On the divan lay something that glinted in
the lamplight, and Rollins looked down on a curiously carven gold
tooth.</p>
