<h2>The Great Brown-Pericord Motor</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>It was a cold, foggy, dreary evening in May. Along the Strand
blurred patches of light marked the position of the lamps. The flaring
shop windows flickered vaguely with steamy brightness through the thick
and heavy atmosphere.</p>

<p>The high lines of houses which lead down to the Embankment were all
dark and deserted, or illuminated only by the glimmering lamp of the
caretaker. At one point, however, there shone out from three windows
upon the second floor a rich flood of light, which broke the sombre
monotony of the terrace. Passers-by glanced up curiously, and drew each
other's attention to the ruddy glare, for it marked the chambers of
Francis Pericord, the inventor and electrical engineer. Long into the
watches of the night the gleam of his lamps bore witness to the
untiring energy and restless industry which was rapidly carrying him to
the first rank in his profession.</p>

<p>Within the chamber sat two men. The one was Pericord
himself--hawk-faced and angular, with the black hair and brisk bearing
which spoke of his Celtic origin. The other--thick, sturdy, and
blue-eyed--was Jeremy Brown, the well-known mechanician. They had been
partners in many an invention, in which the creative genius of the one
had been aided by the practical abilities of the other. It was a
question among their friends as to which was the better man.</p>

<p>It was no chance visit which had brought Brown into Pericord's
workshop at so late an hour. Business was to be done--business which
was to decide the failure or success of months of work, and which might
affect their whole careers. Between them lay a long brown table,
stained and corroded by strong acids, and littered with giant carboys,
Faure's accumulators, voltaic piles, coils of wire, and great blocks of
non-conducting porcelain. In the midst of all this lumber there stood a
singular whizzing, whirring machine, upon which the eyes of both
partners were riveted.</p>

<p>A small square metal receptacle was connected by numerous wires to a
broad steel girdle, furnished on either side with two powerful
projecting joints. The girdle was motionless, but the joints with the
short arms attached to them flashed round every few seconds, with a
pause between each rhythmic turn. The power which moved them came
evidently from the metal box. A subtle odour of ozone was in the
air.</p>

<p>"How about the flanges, Brown?" asked the inventor.</p>

<p>"They were too large to bring. They are seven foot by three. There
is power enough there to work them, however. I will answer for
that."</p>

<p>"Aluminium with an alloy of copper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"See how beautifully it works." Pericord stretched out a thin,
nervous hand, and pressed a button upon the machine. The joints
revolved more slowly, and came presently to a dead stop. Again he
touched a spring and the arms shivered and woke up again into their
crisp metallic life. "The experimenter need not exert his muscular
powers," he remarked. "He has only to be passive, and use his
intelligence."</p>

<p>"Thanks to my motor," said Brown.</p>

<p>"_Our_ motor," the other broke in sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said his colleague impatiently.</p>

<p>"The motor which you thought of, and which I reduced to
practice--call it what you like."</p>

<p>"I call it the Brown-Pericord Motor," cried the inventor with an
angry flash of his dark eyes. "You worked out the details, but the
abstract thought is mine, and mine alone."</p>

<p>"An abstract thought won't turn an engine," said Brown,
doggedly.</p>

<p>"That was why I took you into partnership," the other retorted,
drumming nervously with his fingers upon the table. "I invent, you
build. It is a fair division of labour."</p>

<p>Brown pursed up his lips, as though by no means satisfied upon the
point. Seeing, however, that further argument was useless, he turned
his attention to the machine, which was shivering and rocking with each
swing of its arms, as though a very little more would send it skimming
from the table.</p>

<p>"Is it not splendid?" cried Pericord.</p>

<p>"It is satisfactory," said the more phlegmatic Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>"There's immortality in it!"</p>

<p>"There's money in it!"</p>

<p>"Our names will go down with Montgolfier's."</p>

<p>"With Rothschild's, I hope."</p>

<p>"No, no, Brown; you take too material a view," cried the inventor,
raising his gleaming eyes from the machine to his companion. "Our
fortunes are a mere detail. Money is a thing which every heavy-witted
plutocrat in the country shares with us. My hopes rise to something
higher than that. Our true reward will come in the gratitude and
goodwill of the human race."</p>

<p>Brown shrugged his shoulders. "You may have my share of that," he
said. "I am a practical man. We must test our invention."</p>

<p>"Where can we do it?"</p>

<p>"That is what I wanted to speak about. It must be absolutely secret.
If we had private grounds of our own it would be an easy matter, but
there is no privacy in London."</p>

<p>"We must take it into the country."</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion to offer," said Brown. "My brother has a place
in Sussex on the high land near Beachy Head. There is, I remember, a
large and lofty barn near the house. Will is in Scotland, but the key
is always at my disposal. Why not take the machine down tomorrow and
test it in the barn?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could be better."</p>

<p>"There is a train to Eastbourne at one."</p>

<p>"I shall be at the station."</p>

<p>"Bring the gear with you, and I will bring the flanges," said the
mechanician, rising. "Tomorrow will prove whether we have been
following a shadow, or whether fortune is at our feet. One o'clock at
Victoria." He walked swiftly down the stair and was quickly reabsorbed
into the flood of comfortless clammy humanity which ebbed and flowed
along the Strand.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and spring-like. A pale blue sky arched over
London, with a few gauzy white clouds drifting lazily across it. At
eleven o'clock Brown might have been seen entering the Patent Office
with a great roll of parchment, diagrams, and plans under his arm. At
twelve he emerged again smiling, and, opening his pocket-book, he
packed away very carefully a small slip of official blue paper. At five
minutes to one his cab rolled into Victoria Station. Two giant
canvas-covered parcels, like enormous kites, were handed down by the
cabman from the top, and consigned to the care of a guard. On the
platform Pericord was pacing up and down, with long eager step and
swinging arms, a tinge of pink upon his sunken and sallow cheeks.</p>

<p>"All right?" he asked.</p>

<p>Brown pointed in answer to his baggage.</p>

<p>"I have the motor and the girdle already packed away in the guard's
van. Be careful, guard, for it is delicate machinery of great value.
So! Now we can start with an easy conscience."</p>

<p>At Eastbourne the precious motor was carried to a four-wheeler, and
the great flanges hoisted on the top. A long drive took them to the
house where the keys were kept, whence they set off across the barren
Downs. The building which was their destination was a commonplace
white-washed structure, with straggling stables and out-houses,
standing in a grassy hollow which sloped down from the edge of the
chalk cliffs. It was a cheerless house even when in use, but now with
its smokeless chimneys and shuttered windows it looked doubly dreary.
The owner had planted a grove of young larches and firs around it, but
the sweeping spray had blighted them, and they hung their withered
heads in melancholy groups. It was a gloomy and forbidding spot.</p>

<p>But the inventors were in no mood to be moved by such trifles. The
lonelier the place, the more fitted for their purpose. With the help of
the cabman they carried their packages down the footpath, and laid them
in the darkened dining-room. The sun was setting as the distant murmur
of wheels told them that they were finally alone.</p>

<p>Pericord had thrown open the shutters and the mellow evening light
streamed in through the discoloured windows. Brown drew a knife from
his pocket and cut the pack-thread with which the canvas was secured.
As the brown covering fell away it disclosed two great yellow metal
fans. These he leaned carefully against the wall. The girdle, the
connecting-bands, and the motor were then in turn unpacked. It was dark
before all was set out in order. A lamp was lit, and by its light the
two men continued to tighten screws, clinch rivets, and make the last
preparations for their experiment.</p>

<p>"That finishes it," said Brown at last, stepping back and surveying
the machine.</p>

<p>Pericord said nothing, but his face glowed with pride and
expectation.</p>

<p>"We must have something to eat," Brown remarked, laying out some
provisions which he had brought with him.</p>

<p>"Afterwards."</p>

<p>"No, now," said the stolid mechanician. "I am half starved." He
pulled up to the table and made a hearty meal, while his Celtic
companion strode impatiently up and down, with twitching fingers and
restless eyes.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Brown, facing round, and brushing the crumbs from
his lap, "who is to put it on?"</p>

<p>"I shall," cried his companion eagerly. "What we do to-night is
likely to be historic."</p>

<p>"But there is some danger," suggested Brown. "We cannot quite tell
how it may act."</p>

<p>"That is nothing," said Pericord, with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"But there is no use our going out of our way to incur danger."</p>

<p>"What then? One of us must do it."</p>

<p>"Not at all. The motor would act equally well if attached to any
inanimate object."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Pericord, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There are bricks by the barn. I have a sack here. Why should not a
bagful of them take your place?"</p>

<p>"It is a good idea. I see no objection."</p>

<p>"Come on then," and the two sallied out, bearing with them the
various sections of their machine. The moon was shining cold and clear
though an occasional ragged cloud drifted across her face. All was
still and silent upon the Downs. They stood and listened before they
entered the barn, but not a sound came to their ears, save the dull
murmur of the sea and the distant barking of a dog. Pericord journeyed
backwards and forwards with all that they might need, while Brown
filled a long narrow sack with bricks.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the door of the barn was closed, and the lamp
balanced upon an empty packing-case. The bag of bricks was laid upon
two trestles, and the broad steel girdle was buckled round it. Then the
great flanges, the wires, and the metal box containing the motor were
in turn attached to the girdle. Last of all a flat steel rudder, shaped
like a fish's tail, was secured to the bottom of the sack.</p>

<p>"We must make it travel in a small circle," said Pericord, glancing
round at the bare high walls.</p>

<p>"Tie the rudder down at one side," suggested Brown. "Now it is
ready. Press the connection and off she goes!"</p>

<p>Pericord leaned forward, his long sallow face quivering with
excitement. His white nervous hands darted here and there among the
wires. Brown stood impassive with critical eyes. There was a sharp burr
from the machine. The huge yellow wings gave a convulsive flap. Then
another. Then a third, slower and stronger, with a fuller sweep. Then a
fourth which filled the barn with a blast of driven air. At the fifth
the bag of bricks began to dance upon the trestles. At the sixth it
sprang into the air, and would have fallen to the ground, but the
seventh came to save it, and fluttered it forward through the air.
Slowly rising, it flapped heavily round in a circle, like some great
clumsy bird, filling the barn with its buzzing and whirring. In the
uncertain yellow light of the single lamp it was strange to see the
loom of the ungainly thing, flapping off into the shadows, and then
circling back into the narrow zone of light.</p>

<p>The two men stood for a while in silence. Then Pericord threw his
long arms up into the air.</p>

<p>"It acts!" he cried. "The Brown-Pericord Motor acts!" He danced
about like a madman in his delight. Brown's eyes twinkled, and he began
to whistle.</p>

<p>"See how smoothly it goes, Brown!" cried the inventor. "And the
rudder--how well it acts! We must register it tomorrow."</p>

<p>His comrade's face darkened and set. "It _is_ registered," he said,
with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"Registered?" said Pericord. "Registered?" He repeated the word
first in a whisper, and then in a kind of scream. "Who has dared to
register my invention?"</p>

<p>"I did it this morning. There is nothing to be excited about. It is
all right."</p>

<p>"You registered the motor! Under whose name?"</p>

<p>"Under my own," said Brown, sullenly. "I consider that I have the
best right to it."</p>

<p>"And my name does not appear?"</p>

<p>"No, but--"</p>

<p>"You villain!" screamed Pericord. "You thief and villain! You would
steal my work! You would filch my credit! I will have that patent back
if I have to tear your throat out!" A sombre fire burned in his black
eyes, and his hands writhed themselves together with passion. Brown was
no coward, but he shrank back as the other advanced upon him.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands off!" he said, drawing a knife from his pocket. "I
will defend myself if you attack me."</p>

<p>"You threaten me?" cried Pericord, whose face was livid with anger.
"You are a bully as well as a cheat. Will you give up the patent?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not."</p>

<p>"Brown, I say, give it up!"</p>

<p>"I will not. I did the work."</p>

<p>Pericord sprang madly forward with blazing eyes and clutching
fingers. His companion writhed out of his grasp, but was dashed against
the packing-case, over which he fell. The lamp was extinguished, and
the whole barn plunged into darkness. A single ray of moonlight shining
through a narrow chink flickered over the great waving fans as they
came and went.</p>

<p>"Will you give up the patent, Brown?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Will you give it up?"</p>

<p>Again no answer. Not a sound save the humming and creaking overhead.
A cold pang of fear and doubt struck through Pericord's heart. He felt
aimlessly about in the dark and his fingers closed upon a hand. It was
cold and unresponsive. With all his anger turned to icy horror he
struck a match, set the lamp up, and lit it.</p>

<p>Brown lay huddled up on the other side of the packing-case. Pericord
seized him in his arms, and with convulsive strength lifted him across.
Then the mystery of his silence was explained. He had fallen with his
right arms doubled up under him, and his own weight had driven the
knife deeply into his body. He had died without a groan. The tragedy
had been sudden, horrible, and complete.</p>

<p>Pericord sat silently on the edge of the case, staring blankly down,
and shivering like one with the ague, while the great Brown-Pericord
Motor boomed and hurtled above him. How long he sat there can never be
known. It might have been minutes or it might have been hours. A
thousand mad schemes flashed through his dazed brain. It was true that
he had been only the indirect cause. But who would believe that? He
glanced down at his blood-spattered clothing. Everything was against
him. It would be better to fly than to give himself up, relying upon
his innocence. No one in London knew where they were. If he could
dispose of the body he might have a few days clear before any suspicion
would be aroused.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud crash recalled him to himself. The flying sack had
gradually risen with each successive circle until it had struck against
the rafters. The blow displaced the connecting-gear, and the machine
fell heavily to the ground. Pericord undid the girdle. The motor was
uninjured. A sudden strange thought flashed upon him as he looked at
it. The machine had become hateful to him. He might dispose both of it
and the body in a way that would baffle all human search.</p>

<p>He threw open the barn door, and carried his companion out into the
moonlight. There was a hillock outside, and on the summit of this he
laid him reverently down. Then he brought from the barn the motor, the
girdle and the flanges. With trembling fingers he fastened the broad
steel belt round the dead man's waist. Then he screwed the wings into
the sockets. Beneath he slung the motor-box, fastened the wires, and
switched on the connection. For a minute or two the huge yellow fans
flapped and flickered. Then the body began to move in little jumps down
the side of the hillock, gathering a gradual momentum, until at last it
heaved up into the air and soared off in the moonlight. He had not used
the rudder, but had turned the head for the south. Gradually the weird
thing rose higher, and sped faster, until it had passed over the line
of cliff, and was sweeping over the silent sea. Pericord watched it
with a white drawn face, until it looked like a black bird with golden
wings half shrouded in the mist which lay over the waters.</p>

<p>In the New York State Lunatic Asylum there is a wild-eyed man whose
name and birth-place are alike unknown. His reason has been unseated by
some sudden shock, the doctors say, though of what nature they are
unable to determine. "It is the most delicate machine which is most
readily put out of gear," they remark, and point, in proof of their
axiom, to the complicated electric engines, and remarkable aeronautic
machines which the patient is fond of devising in his more lucid
moments.</p>
