  <h3>First published in <i>American Weekly</i>, September 23, 1923</h3><br>

  <p class="intro">This is Professor James Marston's story. A score of learned
  bodies have courteously heard him tell it, and then among themselves have
  lamented that so brilliant a man should have such an obsession. Professor
  Marston told it to me in San Francisco, just before he started to find the
  island that holds his pool of the stone god and&mdash;the wings that guard
  it. He seemed to me very sane. It is true that the equipment of his
  expedition was unusual, and not the least curious part of it are the suits of
  fine chain mail and masks and gauntlets with which each man of the party is
  provided.</p><br>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE FIVE OF US, said Professor Marston, sat side by side on
  the beach. There was Wilkinson the first officer, Bates and Cassidy the two
  seamen, Waters the pearler and myself. We had all been on our way to New
  Guinea, I to study the fossils for the Smithsonian. The <i>Moranus</i> had
  struck the hidden reef the night before and had sunk swiftly. We were then,
  roughly, about five hundred miles northeast of the Guinea coast. The five of
  us had managed to drop a lifeboat and get away. The boat was well stocked
  with water and provisions. Whether the rest of the crew had escaped we did
  not know. We had sighted the island at dawn and had made for her. The
  lifeboat was drawn safely up on the sands.</p>

  <p>"We'd better explore a bit, anyway," said Waters. "This may be a perfect
  place for us to wait rescue. At least until the typhoon season is over. We've
  our pistols. Let's start by following this brook to its source, look over the
  place and then decide what we'll do."</p>

  <p>The trees began to thin out. We saw ahead an open space. We reached it and
  stopped in sheer amazement. The clearing was perfectly square and about five
  hundred feet wide. The trees stopped abruptly at its edges as though held
  back by something unseen.</p>

  <p>But it was not this singular impression that held us. At the far end of
  the square were a dozen stone huts clustered about one slightly larger. They
  reminded me powerfully of those prehistoric structures you see in parts of
  England and France. I approach now the most singular thing about this whole
  singular and sinister place. In the center of the space was a pool walled
  about with huge blocks of cut stone. At the side of the pool rose a great
  stone figure, carved in the semblance of a man with outstretched hands. It
  was at least twenty feet high and was extremely well executed. At the
  distance the statue seemed nude and yet it had a peculiar effect of drapery
  about it. As we drew nearer we saw that it was covered from ankles to neck
  with the most extraordinary carved wings. They looked exactly like bat wings
  when they were folded.</p>

  <p>There was something extremely disquieting about this figure. The face was
  inexpressibly ugly and malignant. The eyes, Mongol-shaped, slanted evil. It
  was not from the face, though, that this feeling seemed to emanate. It was
  from the body covered with wings&mdash;and especially from the wings. They
  were part of the idol and yet they gave one the idea that they were clinging
  to it.</p>

  <p>Cassidy, a big brute of a man, swaggered up to the idol and laid his hand
  on it. He drew it away quickly, his face white, his mouth twitching. I
  followed him and conquering my unscientific repugnance, examined the stone.
  It, like the huts and in fact the whole place, was clearly the work of that
  forgotten race whose monuments are scattered over the Southern Pacific. The
  carving of the wings was wonderful. They were batlike, as I have said, folded
  and each ended in a little ring of conventionalized feathers. They ranged in
  size from four to ten inches. I ran my fingers over one. Never have I felt
  the equal of the nausea that sent me to my knees before the idol. The wing
  had felt like smooth, cold stone, but I had the sensation of having touched
  back of the stone some monstrous obscene creature of a lower world. The
  sensation came of course, I reasoned, only from the temperature and texture
  of the stone&mdash;and yet this did not really satisfy me.</p>

  <p>Dusk was soon due. We decided to return to the beach and examine the
  clearing further on the morrow. I desired greatly to explore the stone
  huts.</p>

  <p>We started back through the forest. We walked some distance and then night
  fell. We lost the brook. After a half hour's wandering we heard it again. We
  started for it. The trees began to thin out and we thought we were
  approaching the beach. Then Waters clutched my arm. I stopped. Directly in
  front of us was the open space with the stone god leering under the moon and
  the green water shining at his feet!</p>

  <p>We had made a circle. Bates and Wilkinson were exhausted. Cassidy swore
  that devils or no devils he was going to camp that night beside the pool!</p>

  <p>The moon was very bright. And it was so very quiet. My scientific
  curiosity got the better of me and I thought I would examine the huts. I left
  Bates on guard and walked over to the largest. There was only one room and
  the moonlight shining through the chinks in the wall illuminated it clearly.
  At the back were two small basins set in the stone. I looked in one and saw a
  faint reddish gleam reflected from a number of globular objects. I drew a
  half dozen of them out. They were pearls, very wonderful pearls of a
  peculiarly rosy hue. I ran toward the door to call Bates&mdash;and
  stopped!</p>

  <p>My eyes had been drawn to the stone idol. Was it an effect of the
  moonlight or did it move? No, it was the wings! They stood out from the stone
  and waved&mdash;they waved, I say, from the ankles to the neck of that
  monstrous statue.</p>

  <p>Bates had seen them, too. He was standing with his pistol raised. Then
  there was a shot. And after that the air was filled with a rushing sound like
  that of a thousand fans. I saw the wings loose themselves from the stone god
  and sweep down in a cloud upon the four men. Another cloud raced up from the
  pool and joined them. I could not move. The wings circled swiftly around and
  about the four. All were now on their feet and I never saw such horror as was
  in their faces.</p>

  <p>Then the wings closed in. They clung to my companions as they had clung to
  the stone.</p>

  <p>I fell back into the hut. I lay there through the night insane with
  terror. Many times I heard the fan-like rushing about the enclosure, but
  nothing entered my hut. Dawn came, and silence, and I dragged myself to the
  door. There stood the stone god with the wings carved upon him as we had seen
  him ten hours before!</p>

  <p>I ran over to the four lying on the grass. I thought that perhaps I had
  had a nightmare. But they were dead. That was not the worst of it. Each man
  was shrunken to his bones! They looked like collapsed white balloons. There
  was not a drop of blood in them. They were nothing but bones wrapped around
  in thin skin!</p>

  <p>Mastering myself, I went close to the idol. There was something different
  about it. It seemed larger&mdash;as though, the thought went through my mind,
  as though it had eaten. Then I saw that it was covered with tiny drops of
  blood that had dropped from the ends of the wings that clothed it!</p>

  <p>I do not remember what happened afterward. I awoke on the pearling
  schooner <i>Luana</i> which had picked me up, crazed with thirst as they
  supposed in the boat of the <i>Moranus</i>.</p><br>
