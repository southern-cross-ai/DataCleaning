<h1>The Demon Spell</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Hume Nisbet</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It was about the time when spiritualism was all the craze in
England, and no party was reckoned complete without a spirit-rapping
seance being included amongst the other entertainments.</p>

<p>One night I had been invited to the house of a friend, who was a
great believer in the manifestations from the unseen world, and who
had asked for my special edification a well--known trance medium. 'A
pretty as well as heaven-gifted girl, whom you will be sure to like,
I know' he said as he asked me.</p>

<p>I did not believe in the return of spirits, yet, thinking to be
amused, consented to attend at the hour appointed. At that time I had
just returned from a long sojourn abroad, and was in a very delicate
state of health, easily impressed by outward influences, and nervous
to a most extraordinary extent.</p>

<p>To the hour appointed I found myself at my friend's house, and was
then introduced to the sitters who had assembled to witness the
phenomena. Some were strangers like myself to the rules of the table,
others who were adepts took their places at once in the order to
which they had in former meetings attended. The trance medium had not
yet arrived, and while waiting upon her coming we sat down and opened
the seance with a hymn.</p>

<p>We had just furnished(sic) the second verse when the door opened
and the medium glided in, and took her place on a vacant set by my
side, joining in with the others in the last verse, after which we
all sat motionless with our hands resting upon the table, waiting
upon the first manifestation from the unseen world.</p>

<p>Now, although I thought all this performance very ridiculous,
there was something in the silence and the dim light, for the gas had
been turned low down, and the room seemed filled with shadows;
something about the fragile figure at my side, with her drooping
head, which thrilled me with a curious sense of fear and icy horror
such as I had never felt before.</p>

<p>I am not by nature imaginative or inclined to superstition, but,
from the moment that young girl had entered the room, I felt as if a
hand had been laid upon my heart, a cold iron hand, that was
compressing it, and causing it to stop throbbing. My sense of hearing
also had grown more acute and sensitive, so that the beating of the
watch in my vest pocket sounded like the thumping of a
quartz-crushing machine, and the measured breathing of those about me
as loud and nerve-disturbing as the snorting of a steam engine.</p>

<p>Only when I turned to look upon the trance medium did I become
soothed; then it seemed as if a cold-air wave had passed through my
brain, subduing, for the time-being, those awful sounds.</p>

<p>'She is possessed,' whispered my host on the other side of me.
'Wait, and she will speak presently, and tell us whom we have got
beside us.'</p>

<p>As we sat and waited the table moved several times under our
hands, while knockings at intervals took place in the table and all
round the room, a most weird and blood-curdling, yet ridiculous
performance, which made me feel half inclined to run out with fear,
and half inclined to sit still and laugh; on the whole, I think,
however, that horror had the more complete possession of me.</p>

<p>Presently she raised her head and laid her hand upon mine,
beginning to speak in a strange monotonous, far away voice, 'This is
my first visit since I passed from earth-life, and you have called me
here.'</p>

<p>I shivered as her hand touched mine, but had not strength to
withdraw it from her light, soft grasp.</p>

<p>'I am what you would call a lost soul; that is, I am in the lowest
sphere. Last week I was in the body, but met my death down
Whitechapel way. I was what you call an unfortunate, aye, unfortunate
enough. Shall I tell you how it happened?'</p>

<p>The medium's eyes were closed, and whether it was my distorted
imagination or not, she appeared to have grown older and decidedly
debauched-looking since she sat down, or rather as if a light, filmy
mask of degrading and soddened vice had replaced the former delicate
features.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and the trance medium continued: 'I had been out all
that day and without any luck or food, so that I was dragging my
wearied body along through the slush and mud for it had been wet all
day, and I was drenched to the skin, and miserable, ah, ten thousand
times more wretched than I am now, for the earth is a far worse hell
for such as I than our hell here.</p>

<p>'I had importuned several passers by as I went along that night,
but none of them spoke to me, for work had been scarce all this
winter, and I suppose I did not look so tempting as I have been; only
once a man answered me, a dark-faced, middle-sized man, with a soft
voice, and much better dressed than my usual companions.</p>

<p>'He asked me where I was going, and then left me, putting a coin
into my hand, for which I thanked him. Being just in time for the
last public-house, I hurried up, but on going to the bar and looking
at my hand, I found it to be a curious foreign coin, with outlandish
figures on it, which the landlord would not take, so I went out again
to the dark fog and rain without my drink after all.</p>

<p>'There was no use going any further that night. I turned up the
court where my lodgings were, intending to go home and get a sleep,
since I could get no food, when I felt something touch me softly from
behind like as if someone had caught hold of my shawl; then I stopped
and turned about to see who it was.</p>

<p>'I was alone, and with no one near me, nothing but fog and the
half light from the court lamp. Yet I felt as if something had got
hold of me, though I could not see what it was, and that it was
gathering about me.</p>

<p>'I tried to scream out, but could not, as this unseen grasp closed
upon my throat and choked me, and then I fell down and for a moment
forgot everything.</p>

<p>'Next moment I woke up, outside my own poor mutilated body, and
stood watching the fell work going on--as you see it now.'</p>

<p>Yes I saw it all as the medium ceased speaking, a mangled corpse
lying on a muddy pavement, and a demoniac, dark, pock-marked face
bending over it, with the lean claws outspread, and the dense fog
instead of a body, like the half formed incarnation of muscles.</p>

<p>'That is what did it, and you will know it again.' she said, 'I
have come for you to find it.'</p>

<p>'Is he an Englishman?' I gasped, as the vision faded away and the
room once more became definite.</p>

<p>'It is neither man nor woman, but it lives as I do, it is with me
now and may be with you to-night, still if you will have me instead
of it, I can keep it back, only you must wish for me with all your
might.'</p>

<p>The seance was now becoming too horrible, and by general consent
our host turned up the gas, and then I saw for the first time the
medium, now relieved from her evil possession, a beautiful girl of
about nineteen, with I think the most glorious brown eyes I had ever
before looked into.</p>

<p>'Do you believe what you have been speaking about?' I asked her as
we were sitting talking together.</p>

<p>'What was that?'</p>

<p>'About the murdered woman.'</p>

<p>'I don't know anything at all. Only that I have been sitting at
the table. I never know what my trances are.' Was she speaking the
truth? Her dark eyes looked truth, so that I could not doubt her.
That night when I went to my lodgings I must confess that it was some
time before I could make up my mind to go to bed. I was decidedly
upset and nervous, and wished that I had never, gone to this spirit
meeting, making a mental vow, as I threw off my clothes and hastily
got into bed, that it was the last unholy gathering I would ever
attend.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I could not put out the gas, I felt
as if the room was filled with ghosts, as if this pair of ghastly
spectres, the murderer and his victim, had accompanied me home, and
were at that moment disputing the possession of me, so instead, I
pulled the bedclothes over my head, it being a cold night, and went
that fashion off to sleep.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock! and the anniversary of the day that Christ was
born. Yes, I heard it striking from the street spire and counted the
strokes, slowly tolled out, listening to the echoes from other
steeples, after this one had ceased, as I lay awake in that gas-lit
room, feeling as if I was not alone this Christmas morn.</p>

<p>Thus, while I was trying to think what had made me wake so
suddenly, I seemed to hear a far off echo cry 'Come to me.' At the
same time the bedclothes were slowly pulled from the bed, and left in
a confused mass on the floor.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Polly?' I cried, remembering the spirit seance, and
the name by which the spirit had announced herself when she took
possession.</p>

<p>Three distinct knocks resounded on the bedpost at my ear, the
signal for 'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Can you speak to me?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' an echo rather than a voice replied, while I felt my flesh
creeping, yet strove to be brave.</p>

<p>'Can I see you?'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'Feel you?'</p>

<p>Instantly the feeling of a light cold hand touched my brow and
passed over my face.</p>

<p>'In God's name what do you want?'</p>

<p>'To save the girl I was in tonight. It is after her and will kill
her if you do not come quickly.'</p>

<p>In an instant I was out of the bed, and tumbling my clothes on any
way, horrified through it all, yet feeling as if Polly were helping
me to dress. There was a Kandian dagger on my table which I had
brought from Ceylon, an old dagger which I had bought for its
antiquity and design, and this I snatched up as I left the room, with
that light unseen hand leading me out of the house and along the
deserted snow-covered streets.</p>

<p>I did not know where the trance medium lived, but I followed where
that light grasp led me through the wild, blinding snow-drift, round
corners and through short cuts, with my head down and the flakes
falling thickly about me, until at last I arrived at a silent square
and in front of a house which by some instinct, I knew that I must
enter.</p>

<p>Over by the other side of the street I saw a man standing looking
up to a dimly-lighted window, but I could not see him very distinctly
and I did not pay much attention to him at the time, but rushed
instead up the front steps and into the house, that unseen hand still
pulling me forward.</p>

<p>How that door opened, or if it did open I could not say, I only
know that I got in, as we get into places in a dream, and up the
inner stairs, I passed into a bedroom where the light was burning
dimly.</p>

<p>It was her bedroom, and she was struggling in the thug-like grasp
of those same demon claws, and the rest of it drifting away to
nothingness.</p>

<p>I saw it all at a glance, her half-naked form, with the
disarranged bedclothes, as the unformed demon of muscles clutched
that delicate throat, and then I was at it like a fury with my
Kandian dagger, slashing crossways at those cruel claws and that evil
face, while blood streaks followed the course of my knife, making
ugly stains, until at last it ceased struggling and disappeared like
a horrid nightmare, as the half-strangled girl, now released from
that fell grip, woke up the house with her screams, while from her
releasing hand dropped a strange coin, which I took possession
of.</p>

<p>Thus I left her, feeling that my work was done, going downstairs
as I had come up, without impediment or even seemingly, in the
slightest degree, attracting the attention of the other inmates of
the house, who rushed in their nightdresses towards the bedroom from
whence the screams were issuing.</p>

<p>Into the street again, with that coin in one hand and my dagger in
the other I rushed, and then I remembered the man whom I had seen
looking up at the window. Was he there still? Yes, but on the ground
in a confused black mass amongst the white snow as if he had been
struck down.</p>

<p>I went over to where he lay and looked at him. Was he dead? Yes. I
turned him round and saw that his throat was gashed from ear to ear,
and all over his face--the same dark, pallid, pock-marked evil face,
and claw-like hands, I saw the dark slashes of my Kandian dagger,
while the soft white snow around him was stained with crimson life
pools, and as I looked I heard the clock strike one, while from the
distance sounded the chant of the coming waits, then I turned and
fled blindly into the darkness.</p>
