<h1>BOOK ONE<br>THE GOLD MINE OF THE VASSE.</h1>

<h2>THE LAND OF THE RED LINE</h2>

<p>WESTERN AUSTRALIA is a vast and unknown country, almost mysterious
in its solitude and unlikeness to any other part of the earth. It is
the greatest of the Australias in extent, and in many features the
richest and loveliest.</p>

<p>But the sister colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, and
Queensland are famous for their treasure of gold. Men from all lands
have flocked thither to gather riches. They care not for the slow
labour of the farmer or grazier. Let the weak and the old, the coward
and the dreamer, prune the vine and dry the figs, and wait for the
wheat to ripen. Strong men must go to the trial--must set muscle
against muscle, and brain against brain, in the mine and the
market.</p>

<p>Men's lives are short; and unless they gather gold in the mass,
how shall they wipe out the primal curse of poverty before the hand
loses its skill and the heart its strong desire?</p>

<p>Western Australia is the Cinderella of the South. She has no gold
like her sisters. To her was given the servile and unhappy portion.
The dregs of British society were poured upon her soil. The robber
and the manslayer were sent thither. Her territory was marked off
with a Red Line. She has no markets for honest men, and no ports for
honest ships. Her laws are not the laws of other countries, but the
terrible rules of the menagerie. Her citizens have no rights: they
toil their lives out at heavy tasks, but earn no wages, nor own a
vestige of right in the soil they till. It is a land of slaves and
bondmen--the great penal colony of Great Britain.</p>

<p>"There is no gold in the western colony," said the miners
contemptuously; "let the convicts keep the land--but let them observe
our red line."</p>

<p>So the convicts took the defamed country, and lived and died
there, and others were transported there from England to replace
those who died, and every year the seething ships gave up their
addition to the terrible population.</p>

<p>In time, the western colony came to be regarded as a plague-spot,
where no man thought of going and no man did go unless sent in
irons.</p>

<p>If the miners from Victoria and New South Wales, however, had
visited the penal land some years after its establishment, they would
have heard whispers of strange import--rumours and questions of a
great golden secret possessed by the western colony. No one could
tell where the rumour began or on what it was based, except perhaps
the certainty that gold was not uncommon among the natives of the
colony, who had little or no intercourse with the aborigines of the
gold-yielding countries of the south and east.</p>

<p>The belief seemed to hover in the air; and it settled with
dazzling conviction on the crude and abnormal minds of the criminal
population. At their daily toil in the quarries or on the road
parties, no rock was blasted nor tree uprooted that eager eyes did
not hungrily scan the upturned earth. At night, when the tired
wretches gathered round the camp-fire outside their prison hut, the
dense mahogany forest closing weirdly round the white-clad group,
still the undiscovered gold was the topic earnestly discussed. And
even the government officers and the few free settlers became after a
time filled with the prevailing expectancy and disquiet.</p>

<p>But years passed, and not an ounce of gold was discovered in the
colony. The Government had offered reward to settlers or
ticket-of-leave men who would find the first nugget or gold-bearing
rock; but no claimant came forward.</p>

<p>Still, there remained the tantalizing fact--for, in the course of
years, fact it had grown to be--that gold was to be found in the
colony, and in abundance. The native bushmen were masters of the
secret, but neither bribe nor torture could wring it from them.
Terrible stories were whispered among the convicts of attempts that
had been made to force the natives to give up the precious secret.
Gold was common amongst these bushmen. Armlets and anklets had been
seen on men and women; and some of their chief men, it was said, wore
breast-plates and enormous chains of hammered gold.</p>

<p>At last the feeling in the west grew to fever heat; and, in 1848,
the Governor of the penal colony issued a proclamation, copies of
which were sent by native runners to every settler and
ticket-of-leave man, and were even surreptitiously distributed
amongst the miners on the other side of the red line.</p>

<p>This proclamation intensified the excitement. It seemed to bring
the mine nearer to every man in the colony. It was a formal admission
that there really was a mine; it dispelled the vague uncertainty, and
left an immediate hunger or greed in the minds of the population.</p>

<p>The proclamation read as follows:</p>

<p>L5.000 REWARD!</p>

<p>The above Reward will be paid for the discovery of the Mine from
which the Natives of the Vasse obtain their Gold.</p>

<p>A Free Pardon will be granted to the Discoverer, should he be of
the Bond Class.</p>

<p>No Reward will be given nor terms made with Absconders from the
Prisons or Road Parties.</p>

<p>By order, F. R. HAMPTON, Governor. Official Residence, Perth, 28th
June, 1848.</p>

<p>But nothing came of it. Not an ounce of gold was ever taken from
the earth. At last men began to avoid the subject. They could not
bear to be tantalized nor tortured by the splendid delusion. Some
said there was no mine in the Vasse, and others that, if there were a
mine, it was known only to a few of the native chiefs, who dealt out
the raw gold to their people.</p>

<p>For eight years this magnificent reward had remained unclaimed,
and now its terms were only recalled at the fires, of the road-making
convicts, or in the lonely slab huts of the mahogany sawyers, who
were all ticket-of-leave men.</p>

<h2>THE CONVICT ROAD PARTY.</h2>

<p>IT was a scorching day in midsummer--a few days before
Christmas.</p>

<p>Had there been any moisture in the bush it would have steamed in
the heavy heat. During the midday hours not a bird stirred among the
mahogany and gum trees. On the flat tops of the low banksia the round
heads of the white cockatoos could be seen in thousands, motionless
as the trees themselves. Not a parrot had the vim to scream. The
chirping insects were silent. Not a snake had courage to rustle his
hard skin against the hot and dead bush-grass. The bright-eyed
iguanas wee in their holes. The mahogany sawyers had left their logs
and were sleeping in the cool sand of their pits. Even the travelling
ants had halted on their wonderful roads, and sought the shade of a
bramble.</p>

<p>All free things were at rest; but the penetrating click of the
axe, heard far through the bush, and now and again a harsh word of
command, told that it was a land of bondmen.</p>

<p>From daylight to dark, through the hot noon as steadily as in the
cool evening, the convicts were at work on the roads--the weary work
that has no wages, no promotion, no incitement, no variation for good
or bad, except stripes for the laggard.</p>

<p>Along the verge of the Koagulup Swamp--one of the greatest and
dismallest of the wooded lakes of the country, its black water deep
enough to float a man-of-war--a party of convicts were making a
government road. They were cutting their patient way into a forest
only traversed before by the aborigine and the absconder.</p>

<p>Before them in the bush, as in their lives, all was dark and
unknown-tangled underbrush, gloomy shadows, and noxious things.
Behind them, clear and open, lay the straight road they had
made--leading to and from the prison.</p>

<p>Their camp, composed of rough slab huts, was some two hundred
miles from the main prison of the colony, on the Swan River, at
Fremantle, from which radiate all the roads made by the bondmen.</p>

<p>The primitive history of the colony is written for ever in its
roads. There is, in this penal labour, a secret of value to be
utilized more fully by a wiser civilization. England sends her
criminals to take the brunt of the new land's hardship and danger-to
prepare the way for honest life and labour. In every community there
is either dangerous or degrading work to be done: and who so fit to
do it as those who have forfeited their liberty by breaking the
law?</p>

<p>The convicts were dressed in white trousers, blue woollen shirt,
and white hat; every article stamped with England's private mark--the
broad arrow. They were young men, healthy and strong, their faces and
bare arms burnt to the colour of mahogany. Burglars, murderers,
garotters, thieves--double-dyed law-breakers every one; but, for all
that, kind hearted and manly fellows enough were among them.</p>

<p>"I tell you, mates," said one, resting on his spade, "this is
going to be the end of Moondyne Joe. That firing in the swamp last
night was his last fight."</p>

<p>"I don't think it was Moondyne," said another; "he's at work in
the chain-gang at Fremantle; and there's no chance of escape
there--"</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" interrupted the first speaker, a powerful, low-browed
fellow, named Dave Terrell, who acted as a sort of foreman to the
gang. The warder in charge of the party was slowly walking past. When
he was out of hearing, Dave continued, in a low but deeply earnest
voice: "I know it was Moondyne, mates. I saw him last night when I
went to get the turtle's eggs. I met him face to face in the
moonlight, beside the swamp."</p>

<p>Every man held his hand and breath with intense interest in the
story. Some looked incredulous--heads were shaken in doubt.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to him?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Terrell, turning on him; "why shouldn't I? Moondyne
knew he had nothing to fear from me, and I had nothing to fear from
him."</p>

<p>"What did you say to him?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Say?--I stood and looked at him for a minute, for his face had a
white look in the moonlight, and then I walked up close to him, and I
says--'Be you Moondyne Joe, or his ghost?'</p>

<p>"Ay?" said the gang with one breath.</p>

<p>"Ay, I said that, never fearing, for Moondyne Joe, dead or alive,
would never harm a prisoner."</p>

<p>"But what did he answer?" asked the eager crowd.</p>

<p>"He never said a word; but he laid his finger on his lips, like
this, and waved his hand as if he warned me to go back to the camp. I
turned to go; then I looked back once, and he was standing just as I
left him, but he was looking up at the sky, as if there was some'at
in the moon that pleased him."</p>

<p>The convicts worked silently, each thinking on what he had
heard.</p>

<p>"He mightn't ha' been afraid, though," said low-browed Dave; "I'd
let them cut my tongue out before I'd sell the Moondyne."</p>

<p>"That's true," said several of the gang, and many kind looks were
given to Terrell. A strong bond of sympathy, it was evident, existed
between these men and the person of whom they spoke.</p>

<p>A sound from the thick bush interrupted the conversation. The
convicts looked up from their work, and beheld a strange procession
approaching from, the direction of the swamp. It consisted of about a
dozen or fifteen persons, most of whom were savages. In front rode
two officers of the Convict Service, a sergeant, and a private
trooper, side by side, with drawn swords; and between their horses,
manacled by the wrists to their stirrup-irons, walked a white
man.</p>

<p>"Here they come," hissed Terrell, with a bitter malediction, his
low brow wholly disappearing into a terrible ridge above his eyes.
"They haven't killed him, after all. O, mates, what a pity it is to
see a man, like Moondyne in that plight."</p>

<p>"He's done for two or three of 'em," muttered another, in a tone
of grim gratification. "Look at the loads behind. I knew he wouldn't
be taken this time like a cornered cur."</p>

<p>Following the prisoner came a troop of "natives," as the
aboriginal bushmen are called, bearing three spearwood litters with
the bodies of wounded men. A villainous-looking savage, mounted on a
troop-horse, brought up the rear. His dress was like that of his
pedestrian fellows, upon whom, however, he looked in disdain--a short
boka, or cloak of kangaroo skin, and a belt of twisted fur cords
round his, naked body. In addition, he had a police-trooper's old
cap, and a heavy "regulation" revolver stuck in his belt.</p>

<p>This was the tracker, the human bloodhound, used by the troopers
to follow the trail of absconding prisoners.</p>

<p>When the troopers neared the convict party, the sergeant, a man
whose natural expression, whatever it might have been, was wholly
obliterated by a frightful sear across his face, asked for water. The
natives halted, and squatted silently in a group. The wounded men
moaned as the litters were lowered.</p>

<p>Dave Terrell brought the water. He handed a pannikin to the
sergeant, and another to the private trooper, and filled a third.</p>

<p>"Who's that for?" harshly demanded the sergeant.</p>

<p>"For Moondyne," said the convict, approaching the chained man,
whose neck was stretched toward the brimming cup.</p>

<p>"Stand back, curse you!" said the sergeant, bringing his sword
flat on the convict's back. "That scoundrel needs no water. He drinks
blood."</p>

<p>There was a taunt in the tone, even beneath the brutality of the
words.</p>

<p>"Carry your pail to those litters," growled the sinister looking
sergeant, "and keep your mouth closed, if you value your hide.
There!" he said in a suppressed voice, flinging the few drops he had
left in the face of the manacled man, "that's water enough for you,
till you reach Bunbury prison tomorrow."</p>

<p>The face of the prisoner hardly changed. He gave one straight look
into the sergeant's eyes, then turned away, and seemed to look far
away through the bush. He was a remarkable being, as he stood there.
In strength and proportion of body, the man was magnificent--a model
for a gladiator. He was of middle height, young, but so stem and
massively featured, and so browned and beaten by exposure, it was
hard to determine his age. His clothing was only a few torn and
bloody rags; but he looked as if his natural garb were utter
nakedness or the bushman's cloak, so loosely and carelessly hung the
shreds of cloth on his bronzed body. A large, finely-shaped head,
with crisp, black hair and beard, a broad, square forehead, and an
air of power and self-command--this was the prisoner, this was
Moondyne Joe.</p>

<p>Who or what was the man? An escaped convict. What had he been?
Perhaps a robber or a mutineer--or, maybe, he ad killed a man in the
white heat of passion. No one knew--no one cared to know.</p>

<p>That question is never asked in the penal colony. No caste there.
They have found bottom, where all stand equal. No envy there, no
rivalry, no greed nor ambition, and no escape from companionship.
They constitute the purest democracy on earth. The only distinction
to be won--that of being trustworthy, or selfish and false. The good
man is he who is kind and true; the bad man is he who is capable of
betraying a confederate.</p>

<p>It may be the absence of the competitive elements of social life
that accounts for the number of manly characters to be met among
these outcasts.</p>

<p>It is by no means in the superior strata of society that abound
the strong, true natures, the men that may be depended upon, the
primitive rocks of humanity. The complexities of social life beget
cunning and artificiality. Among penal convicts there is no ground
for envy, ambition, or emulation; nothing to be gained by falsehood
in any shape.</p>

<p>But all this time the prisoner stands looking away into the bush,
with the drops of insult trickling from his strong face. His
self-command evidently irritated the brutal officer, who, perhaps,
expected to hear him whine for better treatment.</p>

<p>The sergeant dismounted to examine the handcuffs, and, while doing
so, looked into the man's face with a leer of cruel exultation. He
drew no expression from the steady eyes of the prisoner.</p>

<p>There was an old score to be settled between those men, and it was
plain that each knew the metal of the other.</p>

<p>"I'll break that look," said the sergeant between his teeth, but
loud enough for the prisoner's ear. "Curse you, I'll break it before
we reach Fremantle." Soon after he turned away, to look to the
wounded men.</p>

<p>While so engaged, the private trooper made a furtive sign to the
convict with the pail; and he, keeping in shade of the horses, crept
up and gave Moondyne a deep drink of the precious water.</p>

<p>The stern lines withdrew from the prisoner's mouth and forehead;
and as he gave the kindly trooper a glance of gratitude, there was
something strangely gentle and winning in the face.</p>

<p>The sergeant returned and mounted. The litters were raised by the
natives, and the party resumed their march, striking in on the new
road that led to the prison.</p>

<p>"May the lightning split him," hissed black-browed Dave, after the
sergeant. "There's not an officer in the colony will strike a
prisoner without cause, except that coward, and he was a convict
himself."</p>

<p>"May the Lord help Moondyne Joe this day," said another, "for he's
chained to the stirrup of the only man living that hates him."</p>

<p>The sympathizing gang looked after the party till they were hidden
by a bend of the road; but they were silent under the eye of their
warder.</p>

<h2>NUMBER 406.</h2>

<p>SOME years before, the prisoner, now called Moondyne Joe, had
arrived in the colony. He was a youth--little more than a boy in
years. From the first day of his imprisonment he had followed one
course: he was quiet, silent, patient, obedient. He broke no rules of
the prison. He asked no favours. He performed all his own work, and
often helped another who grumbled at his heavy task.</p>

<p>He was simply known to his fellow-convicts as Joe; his other name
was unknown or forgotten. When the prison roll was called, he
answered to No. 406.</p>

<p>In the first few years he had made many friends in the colony--but
he had also made one enemy, and a deadly one. In the gang to which he
belonged was a man named Isaac Bowman, one of those natures seemingly
all evil, envious, and cruel; detested by the basest, yet
self-contained, full of jibe and derision, satisfied with his own
depravity, and convinced that everyone was secretly just as vile as
he.</p>

<p>From the first, this fellow had disliked and sneered at Joe; and
Joe, having long observed the man's cur-like character, had at last
adopted a system of conduct toward him that saved himself annoyance,
but secretly intensified the malevolence of the other. He did not
avoid the fellow; but he never looked at him, saw him, spoke to
him--not even answering him when he spoke, as if he had not heard
him.</p>

<p>This treatment was observed and enjoyed by the other prisoners,
and sometimes even adopted by themselves toward Bowman. At last its
effect on, the evil nature was too powerful to be concealed. With the
others he could return oath for oath, or jibe for jibe, and always
came off pleased with himself but Joe's silent contumely stung him
like a scorpion.</p>

<p>The convicts at length saw that Bowman, who was a man capable of
any crime, held a deep hatred for Joe, and they warned him to beware.
But he smiled, and went on just as before.</p>

<p>One morning a poor settler rode into the camp with a cry for
justice and vengeance. His hut was only a few miles distant, and in
his absence last night a deed of rapine and robbery had been
perpetrated there--and the robber was a convict.</p>

<p>A search was made in the prisoner's hut, and in one of the
hammocks was found some of the stolen property. The man who owned the
hammock was seized and ironed, protesting his innocence. Further
evidence was found against him--he had been seen returning to the
camp that morning--Isaac Bowman had seen him.</p>

<p>Swift and summary is the dread punishment of the penal code. As
the helpless wretch was dragged away, a word of mock pity followed
him from Bowman. During the scene, Joe had stood in silence; but at
the brutal jibe he started as if struck by a whip. He sprang on Isaac
Bowman suddenly, dashed him to the ground, and, holding him there
like a worm, shook from his clothing all the stolen property, except
what the caitiff had concealed in his fellow's bed to insure his
conviction.</p>

<p>Then and there the sentence was given. The villain was hauled to
the triangles and flogged with embittered violence. He uttered no
cry; but, as the hissing lashes swept his back, he settled a look of
ghastly and mortal hatred on Joe, who stood by and counted the
stripes.</p>

<p>But this was years ago; and Bowman had long been a free man and a
settler, having served out his sentence.</p>

<p>At that time the laws of the Penal Colony were exceedingly cruel
and unjust to the bondmen. There was in the colony a number of "free
settlers" and ex-convicts who had obtained land, and these, as a
class, were men who lived half by farming and half by rascality. They
sold brandy to the convicts and ticket-of-leave men, and robbed them
when the drugged liquor had done its work. They feared no law, for
the word of a prisoner was dead in the courts.</p>

<p>The crying evil of the code was the power it gave these settlers
to take from the prisons as many men as they chose, and work them as
slaves on their clearings. While so employed, the very lives of these
convicts were at the mercy of their taskmasters, who possessed over
them all the power of prison officers.</p>

<p>A report made by an employer against a convict insured a flogging,
or a number of years in the terrible chain-gang at Fremantle. The
system reeked with cruelty and the blood of men. It would startle our
commonplace serenity to see the record of the lives that were
sacrificed to have it repealed.</p>

<p>Under this law, it came to Joe's turn to be sent out on probation.
Application had been made for him by a farmer, whose "range" was in a
remote district. Joe was a strong and willing worker, and he was glad
of the change; but when he was taken to the lonely place, he could
not help a shudder when he came face to face--with his new employer
and master--Isaac Bowman.</p>

<p>There was no doubting the purpose of the villain who had now
complete possession of him. He meant to drive him into rebellion--to
torture him till his hate was gratified, and then to have him flogged
and sent to the chain-gang; and from the first minute of his control
he began to carry out his purpose.</p>

<p>For two years the strong man toiled like a brute at the word of
his driver, returning neither scoff nor scourge.</p>

<p>Joe had years to serve; and he had made up his mind to serve them,
and be free. He knew there was no escape--that one report from Bowman
would wipe out all record of previous good conduct. He knew, too,
that Bowman meant to destroy him, and he resolved to bear toil and
abuse as long as he was able.</p>

<p>He was able longer than most men; but the cup was filled at last.
The clay came when the worm turned--when the quiet, patient man
blazed into dreadful passion, and, tearing the goad from the tyrant's
hand, he dashed him, maimed and senseless, to the earth.</p>

<p>The blow given, Joe's passion calmed, and the ruin of the deed
stared him in the face. There was no court of justice in which he
might plead. He had neither word nor oath nor witnesses. The man
might be dead; and even if he recovered, the punishment was the lash
and the chain-gang, or the gallows.</p>

<p>Then and there, Joe struck into the bush with a resolute face, and
next day the infuriate and baffled rascal, rendered ten-fold more
malignant by a dreadful disfigurement, reported him to the prison as
an absconder, a robber, and an attempted murderer.</p>

<h2>BOND AND FREE.</h2>

<p>THREE years passed. It was believed that Joe had perished in the
bush. Bowman had entered the convict service as a trooper, but even
his vigilance brought no discovery. Absconders are generally found
after a few months, prowling around the settlements for food, and are
glad to be retaken.</p>

<p>But Joe was no common criminal nor common man. When he set his
face toward the bush, he meant to take no half measures. The bush was
to be his home. He knew of nothing to draw him back, and he cared not
if he never saw the face of a white man again. He was sick of
injustice and hardship sick of all the ways of the men he had
known.</p>

<p>Prison life had developed a strong nature in Joe. Naturally
powerful in mind, body, and passions, he had turned the Power in on
himself, and had obtained a rare mastery over his being. He was a
thoughtful man, a peacemaker, and a lover of justice. He had obtained
an extraordinary hold on the affection of the convicts. They all knew
him. He was true as steel to everything he undertook; and they knew
that, too; He was enormously strong. One day he was working in the
quarries of Fremantle with twenty others in a deep and narrow, ledge.
Sixteen men were at work below, and four were preparing a blast at
the head of the ledge, which ran down at an eagle of fifty degrees,
like a channel cut in the solid rock. The men below were at the
bottom of the channel. A pebble dropped by the four men above would
have dashed into their Midst.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry above, sharp, short, terrible--</p>

<p>"Look out down there!"</p>

<p>One of the half-filled charges had exploded with a sullen,
mischievous puff, and the rocks at the head of the ledge were lifted
and loosened. One immense block barred the tumbling mass from the men
below. But the increasing weight above grew irresistible--the great
stone was yielding--it had moved several inches, pressed on from
behind. The men who had been working at the place fled for their
lives, only sending out the terrible cry to their fellows below--</p>

<p>"Look out down there!"</p>

<p>But those below could only look out--they could not get out. There
was no way out but by the rising channel of the ledge. And down that
channel would thunder in a quarter of a minute the murderous rocks
that were pushing the saving stone before them.</p>

<p>Three of the men above escaped in time. They dared not look
behind--as they dung to the quarry-side, out of danger, they closed
their eyes, waiting for the horrible crash.</p>

<p>But it did not come. They waited ten seconds, then looked around.
A man stood at the head of the ledge, right before the moving mass--a
convict--Moondyne Joe. He had a massive crowbar in his hands, and was
strongly working to get a purchase on the great stone that blocked
the way, but which actually swayed on the verge of the steep decline.
At last the bar caught--the purchase was good--the stone moved
another inch, and the body of the man bent like a strong tree under
the awful strain. But he held back the stone.</p>

<p>He did not say a word--he did not look below--he knew they would
see the precious moment and escape. They saw it, and, with chilled
hearts at the terrible danger, they fled up the ledge and darted past
the man who had risked his own life to save theirs.</p>

<p>Another instant and the roar went down the ledge, as if the hungry
rocks knew they had been baffled.</p>

<p>Moondyne Joe escaped--the bar saved him. When the crash came, the
bar was driven across an angle in the ledge, and held there, and he
was within the angle. He was mangled and bruised--but life and limb
were safe.</p>

<p>This was one of several instances that proved his character, and
made him trusted and loved of his fellow-convicts.</p>

<p>Whatever was his offence against the law, he had received its
bitter lesson. The worst of the convicts grew better when associated
with him. Common sense, truth, and kindness were Joe's principles. He
was a strong man, and he pitied and helped those weaker than himself.
He was a bold man, and he understood the timid. He was a brave man,
and he grieved for a coward or a liar. He never preached; but his
healthy, straightforward life did more good to his fellows than all
the hired bible-readers in the colony.</p>

<p>No wonder the natives to whom he fled soon began to look upon him
with a strange feeling. Far into the mountains of the Vasse he had
journeyed before he fell in with them.</p>

<p>They were distrustful of all white men, but they soon trusted him.
There was something in the simple savage mind not far removed from
that of the men in prison, who had grown to respect, even to
reverence, his character. The natives saw him stronger and braver
than anyone they had ever known. He was more silent than their oldest
chief; and so wise, he settled disputes so that both sides were
satisfied. They looked on him with distrust at first; then with
wonder; then with respect and confidence; and before two years were
over, with something like awe and veneration, as for a superior
being.</p>

<p>They gave him the name Of "MOONDYNE," which had some meaning more
than either manhood or kingship.</p>

<p>His fame and name spread through the native tribes all over the
country. When they came to the white settlements, the expression
oftenest heard was "Moondyne." The convicts and settlers constantly
heard the word, but dreamt not then of its significance. Afterwards,
when they knew to whom the name had been given, it became a current
word throughout the colony.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the third year of his freedom, when Moondyne
and a party of natives were far from the mountains, they were
surprised by a Government surveying party, who made him prisoner,
knowing, of course, that he must be an absconder. He was taken to the
main prison at Fremantle, and sentenced to the chain-gang for life;
but before he had reached the Swan River every native in the colony
knew that "The Moondyne" was a prisoner.</p>

<p>The chain-gang of Fremantle is the depth of penal degradation. The
convicts wear from thirty to fifty pounds of iron, according to their
offence. It is riveted on their bodies in the prison forge, and when
they have served their time the great rings have to be chiselled off
their calloused limbs.</p>

<p>The chain-gang works outside the prison walls of Fremantle, in the
granite quarries. The neighbourhood, being thickly settled with
pardoned men and ticket-of-leave men, had I been deserted by the
aborigines; but from the day of Moondyne's sentence the bushmen began
to build their myers and hold their corroborees near the quarries.
For two years the chain-gang toiled among the stones, and the black
men sat on the great unhewn rocks, and never seemed to tire of the
scene.</p>

<p>The warders took no notice of their silent presence. The natives
never spoke to a prisoner, but sat there in dumb interest, every day
in the year, from sunrise to evening.</p>

<p>One day they disappeared from the quarries, and an officer who
passed through their village of myers, found them deserted. It was
quite a subject of interesting conversation among the warders. Where
had they gone to? Why had they departed in the night?</p>

<p>The day following an answer came to these queries. When the
chain-gang was formed, to return to the prison, one link was
gone--Moondyne was missing.</p>

<p>His irons were found, filed through, behind the rock at which he
worked; and from that day the black face of a bushman was never seen
in Fremantle.</p>

<h2>THE KOAGULUP SWAMP.</h2>

<p>WE arrive now at the opening scene of this story. Eight days after
his escape from Fremantle, Moondyne was seen by the convict Dave
Terrell, on the shores of the Koagulup Swamp. In those eight days he
had travelled two hundred miles, suffering that which is only known
to the hunted convict. When he met the prisoner in the moonlight and
made the motion to silence, Dave Terrell saw the long barrel of a
pistol in his belt. He meant to sell his life this time, for there
was no hope if retaken.</p>

<p>His intention was to hide in the swamp till he found an
opportunity of striking into the Vasse Mountains, a spur of which was
not more than sixty miles distant.</p>

<p>But the way of the absconder is perilous; and swift as had been
Moondyne's flight, the shadow of the pursuer was close behind. No
tardy step was that of him who led the pursuit of a man with a
terribly maimed face--a new officer of the penal system, but whose
motive in the pursuit was deadlier and dearer than the love of public
duty.</p>

<p>On the very day that Moondyne Joe reached the great swamp, the
mounted pursuit tracked the fugitive to the water's edge. A few hours
later, while he lay exhausted on an island in the densely-wooded
morass, the long sedge was cautiously divided a few yards from his
face, and the glittering eyes of a native tracker met his for an
instant. Before he could spring to his feet the supple savage was
upon him, sending out his bush cry as he sprang! A short struggle,
with the black hands on the white throat; then the great white arms
closed around the black body, and with a gasping sob it lost its
nerve and lay still, while Moondyne half rose to listen.</p>

<p>From every point he heard the trackers closing on him. He sank
back with a moan of despair; but the next instant the blood rushed
from his heart with a new vigour for every muscle.</p>

<p>It was the last breath of his freedom, and he would fight for it
as for his life. He sprang to his feet and met his first brutal
assailant, a native dog--half-wolf, half-greyhound--which sprang at
his throat, but sank its fangs in his shoulder.</p>

<p>A bullet through the animal's brain left him free again, with
steadied nerves. Even in the excitement of the moment a thrill of
gratitude that it was not a man that lay there passed through him; He
flung his pistol into the swamp, and dashed towards the log on which
he had gained the island. Beside it stood two men, armed. Barehanded,
the fugitive flung himself upon them, and closed in desperate
struggle. It was vain, however; others came and struck him down and
overpowered him.</p>

<p>He was put in irons, and found himself in charge of the most
brutal officer in the penal service--his old fellow-convict and
employer, Isaac Bowman.</p>

<h2>THE BRIBE.</h2>

<p>WHEN the party had travelled a dozen miles from the convict camp,
the evening closed, and the sergeant called a halt. A chain was
passed round a tree; and locked; and to this the manacles of the
prisoner were made fast, leaving him barely the power of lying down.
With a common prisoner this would have been security enough; but the
sergeant meant to leave no loophole open. He and the private trooper
would keep guard all night; and according to this order, after
supper, the trooper entered on the first four hours' watch.</p>

<p>The natives and wounded men took their meal and were stretched on
the soft sand beside another fire, about a hundred paces from the
guard and prisoner.</p>

<p>The tired men soon slept, all but the sentry and the captive. The
sergeant lay within arm's length of the prisoner; and even from deep
sleep awoke at the least movement of the chain.</p>

<p>Towards midnight, the chained man turned his face toward the
sentry, and motioned him to draw near. The rough, but kind-hearted,
fellow thought he asked for water and softly brought him a pannikin,
which he held to his lips. At the slight motion, the light motion,
the sergeant awoke, and harshly reprimanded the trooper, posting him
at a distance from the fire, with orders not to move till his watch
had expired. The sergeant returned to his sleep, and again all was
still.</p>

<p>After a time the face of the prisoner was once more raised, and
with silent lip, but earnest expression, he begged the sentry to come
to him. But the man would not move. He grew angry at the persistence
of the prisoner, who ceased not to look towards him, and who at last
even ventured to speak in a low voice. At this the fearful trooper
grew alarmed, and sternly ordered him to rest. The sergeant awoke at
the word, and shortly after relieved the trooper, seating himself
beside the fire to watch the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>When the prisoner saw this, with a look of utter weariness, though
not of resignation, he at last closed his eyes and sank to rest. Once
having yielded to the fatigue which his strong will had hitherto
mastered, he was unconscious. A deep and dreamless sleep fell on him.
The sand was soft round his tired limbs, and for two or three hours
the bitterness of his captivity was forgotten.</p>

<p>He awoke suddenly, and, as if he had not slept, felt the iron on
his wrists, and knew that he was chained to a tree like a wild
beast.</p>

<p>The sleep had given him new strength. He raised his head, and met
the eyes of the sergeant watching him. The look between them was long
and steady.</p>

<p>"Come here," said the prisoner, in a low tone; "I want to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Had the gaunt dog beside him spoken, the sergeant could not have
been more amazed.</p>

<p>"Come here," repeated Moondyne. "I have something important to say
to you."</p>

<p>The sergeant drew his revolver, examined the caps, and then moved
towards his prisoner.</p>

<p>"I heard you say you had spent twenty-five years in this colony,"
said Moondyne, "and that you might as well have remained a convict.
Would you go away to another country, and live the rest of your life
in wealth and power?"</p>

<p>The sergeant stared at him as if he thought he had gone mad. The
prisoner understood the look.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said impressively; "I am not mad. You know there is a
reward offered for the discovery of the Vasse Gold Mine. I can lead
you to the spot!"</p>

<p>There was that in his voice and look that thrilled the sergeant to
the marrow. He glanced at the sleeping trooper, and drew closer to
the chained man.</p>

<p>"I know where that gold mine lies," said Moondyne, reading the
greedy face, "where tons and shiploads of solid gold are waiting to
be carried away. If you help me to be free, I will lead you to the
mine."</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at him in silence. He arose and walked
stealthily towards the natives, who were soundly sleeping. To and fro
in the firelight, for nearly an hour, he paced, revolving the
startling proposition. At last he approached the chained man.</p>

<p>"I have treated you badly, and you hate me," he said. "How can I
trust you? How can you prove to me that this is true?"</p>

<p>Moondyne met the suspicious eye steadily. "I have no proof," he
said; "you must take my word. I tell you the truth. If I do not lead
you straight to the mine, I will go back to Fremantle as your
prisoner."</p>

<p>Still the sergeant pondered and paced. He was in doubt, and the
consequences might be terrible.</p>

<p>"Have you ever known me to lie?" said Moondyne.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at him, but did not answer.</p>

<p>At length he abruptly asked: "Is it far away?" He was advancing
towards a decision.</p>

<p>"We can reach the place in two days, if you give me a horse," said
Moondyne.</p>

<p>"You might escape," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"I will not; but if you doubt me, keep the chain on my wrist till
I show you the gold."</p>

<p>"And then?" said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Then we shall be equals. I will lead you to the mine. You must
return and escape from the country as best you can. Do you
agree?"</p>

<p>The sergeant's face was white, as he glanced at the sleeping
trooper and then at the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I agree," he said; "lie down and pretend to sleep."</p>

<p>The sergeant had thought out his plan. He would insure his own
safety, no matter how the affair turned. Helping a convict to escape
was punished with death by the penal law; but he would put another
look on the matter. He cautiously waked the private trooper.</p>

<p>"Take those natives," he said, "all but the mounted tracker, and
go on to Bunbury before me. The wounded men must be doctored at
once."</p>

<p>Without a word the disciplined trooper shook the drowsiness from
him, saddled his horse, and mounted. In half an hour they were gone.
Moondyne Joe and the sergeant listened till the last sound died away.
The tracker was curled up again beside the fire.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bowman then unlocked the chain, and the powerful prisoner
rose to his feet. In a whisper the sergeant told him he must secure
the native before he attempted to take the horse.</p>

<p>Moondyne went softly to the side of the sleeping savage. There was
a smile on his face as he knelt down and laid one strong hand on the
man's throat, and another on his pistol.</p>

<p>In a few moments it was over. The bushman never even writhed when
he saw the stem face above him, and felt that his weapon was gone.
Moondyne left him tied hand and foot, and returned to the sergeant,
who had the horses ready.</p>

<p>When the convict stood beside the trooper he raised his hand
suddenly, and held something toward him--the tracker's pistol, loaded
and capped! He had played and won. His enemy stood defenceless before
him--and the terror of death, as he saw the position, was in the
blanched face of the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Take this pistol," said Moondyne, quietly. "You may give it to
me, if you will, when I have kept my word."</p>

<p>The sergeant took the weapon with a trembling hand, and his evil
face had an awed look as he mounted.</p>

<p>"Call the dogs," said Moondyne; "we shall need them tomorrow." In
answer to a low whistle the wolf-like things bounded through the
bush. The men struck off at a gallop, in the direction of the
convicts' camp, the sergeant a little behind, with his pistol ready
in the holster.</p>

<h2>THE IRON-STONE MOUNTAINS.</h2>

<p>MOONDYNE took a straight line from the Koagulup Swamp, which they
"struck" after a couple hours' ride. They dismounted near the scene
of the capture, and Moondyne pulled from some bushes near the edge of
a short raft of logs bound together with withes of bark. The sergeant
hesitated, and looked on suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You must trust me," said Moondyne quietly; "unless we break the
track we shall have the sleuth-dog tracker after us when he gets
loose."</p>

<p>The sergeant got on the raft, holding the bridles of the horses.
Moondyne, with a pole, pushed from the bank, and entered the gloomy
arches of the wooded swamp.</p>

<p>It was a weird scene. At noonday the flood was black as ink, and
the arches were filled with gloomy shadows. Overhead the foliage of
trees and creepers was matted into a dense roof, now pierced by a few
thin pencils of moonlight.</p>

<p>Straight toward the centre Moondyne steered from several hundred
yards, the horses swimming behind. Then he turned at right angles,
and pushed along from tree to tree in a line with the shore they had
left. After a while the horses found bottom, and waded.</p>

<p>"No more trouble now," said Moondyne. "They're on the sand. We
must keep along till morning, and then strike toward the hills."</p>

<p>They went ahead rapidly, thanks to Moondyne's amazing strength;
and by daylight were a long distance from the point at which they
entered. A wide but shallow river with a bright sand bottom emptied
into the swamp before them, and into this Moondyne poled the raft and
tied it securely to a fallen tree, hidden in sedge grass.</p>

<p>They mounted their horses, and rode up the bed of the river, which
they did not leave till near noontime. At last, when Moondyne deemed
the track thoroughly broken, he turned toward the higher bank, and
struck into the bush, the land beginning to rise toward the mountains
when they had travelled a few miles.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they halted for the day's first
meal. Moondyne climbed a mahogany tree, which he had selected from
certain fresh marks on its bark, and from a hole in the trunk pulled
out two silver-tailed 'possums, as large as rabbits. The sergeant
lighted a fire on the loose sand, and piled it high with dry wood.
When the 'possums were ready for cooking, the sand beneath the fire
was heated a foot deep, and making a hole in this, the game was
buried, and the flies continued above. After a time the embers were
thrown off and the meat dug out. It looked burnt and black; but when
the crust was broken the flesh within was tender and juicy. This,
with clear water from the iron-stone hills, made a rare meal for
hungry men; after which they continued their travel.</p>

<p>Before nightfall they had entered the first circle of hills at the
foot of the mountains. With a springing hope in his heart, Moondyne
led the way into the tortuous passes of the hills; and in a valley as
silent as the grave, and as lonely, they made their camp for the
night.</p>

<p>They were in the saddle before sunrise, and travelling in a
strange and wild country, which no white man, except Moondyne, had
ever before entered. The scene was amazing to the sergeant, who was
used to the endless sameness of the gum forests on the plains of the
convict settlement. Here, masses of dark metallic stone were heaped
in savage confusion, and around these, like great pale serpents or
cables, were twisted the white roots of tuad trees. So wild was the
scene with rock and torrent, underbrush and forest, that the
sergeant, old bushman as he was, began to feel that it would be
dangerous for a man who had not studied the lay of the land, to
travel here without a guide. However, he had a deep game to play, for
a great stake. He said nothing, but watched Moondyne closely, and
observed everything around that might assist his memory
by-and-by.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they rode through winding passes in the hills,
and towards sunset came on the border of a lake in the basin of the
mountains.</p>

<p>"Now," said Moondyne, dismounting by the lake-side, and turning
loose his horse to crop the rich grass, "now we may rest. We are
inside the guard of the hills."</p>

<p>The sergeant's manner had strangely altered during the long ride.
He was trembling on the verge of a great discovery; but he was, to a
certain extent, in the power of Moondyne. He could not help feeling
that the man was acting truly to his word; but his own purpose was so
dark and deceitful, it was impossible for him to trust another.</p>

<p>The punishment of falsehood is to suspect all truth. The mean of
soul cannot conceive nobility. The vicious cannot believe in virtue.
The artificial dignity imparted by the sergeant's office had
disappeared, in spite of himself; and in its place returned the
caitiff aspect that had marked him when he was a convict and a
settler. Standing on an equality with Moondyne, their places had
changed, and the prisoner was the master.</p>

<p>On the sandy shore of the beautiful lake they found turtles' eggs,
and these, with baked bandicoot, made supper and breakfast.</p>

<p>On resuming their ride, next morning, Moondyne said: "To-night we
shall reach the gold mine."</p>

<p>The way was no longer broken; they rode in the beds of grassy
valleys, walled by precipitous mountains. Palms, bearing large
scarlet nuts, brilliant flowers and birds, and trees and shrubs of
unnamed species-all these, with delicious streams from the mountains,
made a scene of wonderful beauty. The face of Moondyne was lighted up
with appreciation; and even the sergeant, coarse, cunning, and
brutish, felt its purifying influence.</p>

<p>It was a long day's ride, broken only by a brief halt at noon,
when they ate a hearty meal beside a deep river that wound its
mysterious way among the hills. Hour after hour passed, and the jaded
horses lagged on the way; but still the valleys opened before the
riders, and Moondyne advanced as confidently as if the road were
familiar.</p>

<p>Towards sunset he rode slowly, and with an air of expectancy. The
sun had gone down behind the mountains, and the narrow valley was
deep in shadow. Before them, standing in the centre of the valley,
rose a tall white tuad tree, within fifty paces of the underwood of
the mountain on either side.</p>

<p>When Moondyne, who led the way, had come within a horse's length
of the tree, a spear whirred from the dark wood on the right, across
his path, and struck deep into the tuad tree. There was not a sound
in the bush to indicate the presence of an enemy. The gloom of
evening had silenced even the insect life and the silence of the
valley was profound. Yet there was startling evidence of life and
hostility in the whirr of the spear that had sunk into the tree
before their eyes with such terrific force that it quivered like a
living thing as it stood out from the tuad.</p>

<p>Moondyne sprang from his horse, and, running to the tree, laid his
hand on the shivered spear, and shouted a few words in the language
of the aborigines. A cry from the bush answered, and the next moment
a tall savage sprang from the cover and threw himself with joyful
acclamations at the feet of Moondyne.</p>

<p>Tall, lithe, and powerful was the young bushman. He arose and
leant on his handful of slender spears, speaking rapidly to Moondyne.
Once he glanced at the sergeant, and, smiling, pointed to the still
quivering spear in the tuad. Then he turned and led them up the
valley, which soon narrowed to the dimensions of a ravine, like the
bed of a torrent, running its perplexed way between overhanging walls
of iron-stone.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down, and the gloom of the passage became dark as
midnight. The horses advanced slowly over the rugged way. A dozen
determined men could hold such a pass against an army. Above their
heads the travellers saw a narrow slit of sky, sprinkled with stars.
The air was damp and chill between the precipitous walls. The dismal
pass was many miles in length; but at last the glare of a fire lit up
the rocks ahead.</p>

<p>The young bushman went forward alone, returning in a few minutes.
Then Moondyne and the sergeant, proceeding with him to the end of the
pass, found themselves in the opening of a small valley or basin,
over which the sky, like a splendid domed roof, was clearly rounded
by the tops of the mountains.</p>

<p>A few paces from the entrance stood a group of natives, who had
started from their rest at the approach of the party.</p>

<h2>THE KING OF THE VASSE</h2>

<p>BESIDE the bright fire of mahogany wood, and slowly advancing to
meet the strangers, was a venerable man-an aborigine, tall,
white-haired, and of great dignity. It was Te-mana-roa (the
long-lived), the King of the Vasse.</p>

<p>Graver than the sedateness of civilization was the dignified
bearing of this powerful and famous barbarian. His erect stature was
touched by his great age, which outran, it was said, all the
generations then living. His fame as a ruler was known throughout the
whole Western country; and among the aborigines even of the far
Eastern slope, two thousand miles away, his existence was vaguely
rumoured, as in former times the European people heard reports of a
mysterious oriental potentate called Prester John.</p>

<p>Behind the aged king, in the full light of the fire, stood two
young girls, dark and skin-clad like their elder, but of surpassing
symmetry of body and beauty of feature. They were Koro and Tapairu,
the grandchildren of Te-mana-roa. Startled, timid, wondering, they
stood together in the intense light, their soft fur-bokas thrown
back, showing to rare effect their rounded limbs and exquisitely
curved bodies.</p>

<p>The old chief welcomed Moondyne with few words, but with many
signs of pleasure and deep respect; but he looked with severe
displeasure at his companion.</p>

<p>A long and earnest conversation followed; while the cunning eyes
of the sergeant, and the inquiring ones of the young bushman and his
sisters, followed every expression of the old chief and Moondyne.</p>

<p>It was evident that Moondyne was telling the reason of the
stranger's presence--telling the story just as it had happened--that
there was no other hope for life--and he had promised to show this
man the gold mine.</p>

<p>Te-mana-roa heard the story with a troubled brow, and when it had
come to an end, he bowed his white head in deep thought. After some
moments, he raised his face and looked long and severely at the
sergeant, who grew restless under the piercing scrutiny.</p>

<p>Still keeping his eyes on the trooper's face, he said in his own
tongue, half in soliloquy and half in query--</p>

<p>"This man cannot be trusted."</p>

<p>Every eye in the group was now centred on the sergeant's face.</p>

<p>After a pause, Moondyne simply repeated the words of the
chief--</p>

<p>"He cannot be trusted."</p>

<p>"Had he come blindfolded from the Koagulup," continued the chief,
"we might lead him through the passes in the night, and set him free.
He has seen the hills and noted the sun and stars as he came: he must
not leave this valley."</p>

<p>The old chief uttered the last sentence as one giving
judgment.</p>

<p>"Ngaru," he said, still gazing intently on the trooper's face. The
young bushman arose from the fire.</p>

<p>"He must not leave the pass, Ngaru."</p>

<p>Without a word the young and powerful bushman took his spears and
womerah, and disappeared in the mouth of the gloomy pass.</p>

<p>Te-mana-roa then arose slowly, and, lighting a resinous torch,
motioned the sergeant to follow him toward a dark entrance in the
iron-stone cliff that loomed above them. The sergeant obeyed,
followed by Moondyne. The men stooped to enter the face of the cliff,
but once inside, the roof rose high, and the way grew spacious.</p>

<p>The walls were black as coal, and dripping with dampness. Not cut
by the hands of man, but worn perhaps in ages past by a stream that
worked its way, as patient as Fate, through the weaker parts of the
rock. The roof soon rose so high that the torchlight was lost in the
overhanging gloom. The passage grew wide and wider, until it seemed
as if the whole interior of the mountain were hollow. There were no
visible walls; but at intervals there came from the darkness above a
ghostly white stalactite pillar of vast dimensions, down which in
utter silence streamed water that glistened in the torchlight.</p>

<p>A terror crept through the sergeant's heart, that was only strong
with evil intent. He glanced suspiciously at Moondyne. But he could
not read the faces of the two men beside him. They symbolized
something unknown to such as he. On them at that moment lay the great
but acceptable burden of manhood--the overmastering but sweet
allegiance that a true man owes to the truth.</p>

<p>It does not need culture and fine association to develop in some
men this highest quality. Those who live by externals, though steeped
in their parrot learning, are not men, but shells of men. When one
turns within his own heart, and finds there the motive and the
master, he approaches nobility. There is nothing of a man but the
word, that is kept or broken--sacred as life, or unstable as water.
By this we judge each other, in philosophy and practice; and by this
test shall be ruled the ultimate judgment.</p>

<p>Moondyne had solemnly promised to lead to the mine a man he knew
to be a villain. The old chief examined the bond of his friend, and
acknowledged its force.</p>

<p>The word of the Moondyne must be kept to-night. Tomorrow the fate
of the stranger would be decided.</p>

<p>They proceeded far into the interior of the mountain, until they
seemed to stand in the midst of a great plain, with open sky
overhead, though in truth above them rose a mountain. The light was
reflected from myriad points of spar or crystal, that shone above
like stars in the blackness. The air of the place was tremulous with
a deep, rushing sound, like the sweep of a river; but the flood was
invisible.</p>

<p>At last the old chief who led the way, stood beside a stone trough
or basin, filled with long pieces of wood standing on end. To these
he applied the torch, and a flame of resinous brightness swept
instantly over the pile and licked at the darkness above in long,
fiery tongues.</p>

<p>The gloom seemed to struggle with the light, like opposing
spirits, and a minute passed before the eye took in the surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>"Now," said Moondyne to the sergeant, raising his hand sweeping it
around--"now, you are within the GOLD MINE OF THE VASSE."</p>

<p>The stupendous dimensions of the vault or chamber in which they
stood oppressed and terrified the sergeant. Hundreds of feet above
his head spread the shadow of the tremendous roof. Hundreds of feet
from where he stood loomed the awful blackness of the cyclopean
walls. From these he scarce could turn his eyes. Their immensity
fascinated and stupefied him. Nor was it strange that such a scene
should inspire awe. The vastest work of humanity dwindled into
insignificance beside the immeasurable dimensions of this mysterious
cavern.</p>

<p>It was long before consciousness of his purpose returned to the
sergeant; but at length, withdrawing his eyes from the gloomy sketch
of gloomy stretch of iron-stone that roofed the mine his glance fell
upon the wide floor, and there, on every side, from wall to wall,
were heaps and masses of yellow metal--of dust and bars, and solid
rocks of gold.</p>

<h2>A DARK NIGHT AND DAY.</h2>

<p>THE old chief led the way from the gold mine; and the strangely
assorted group of five persons sat by the fire while meat was cooked
for the travellers.</p>

<p>The youth who had escorted the white men from the outer valley was
the grandson of the chief, and brother of the beautiful girls.
Savages they were, elder and girls, in the eyes of the sergeant; but
there was a thoughtfulness in Te-mana-roa, bred by the trust of
treasure and the supreme confidence of his race, that elevated him to
an exalted plane of manhood; and the young people had much of the
same quiet and dignified bearing.</p>

<p>The revelations of the day had been too powerful for the small
brain of the cunning trooper. They came before his memory piecemeal.
He longed for an opportunity to think them over, to get them into
grasp, and to plan his course of action.</p>

<p>The splendid secret must be his own, and he must overreach all who
would to-morrow put conditions on his escape. While meditating this,
the lovely form of one of the girls, observed by his evil eye as she
bent over the fire, suggested a scheme, and before the meal was
finished, the sergeant had worked far on the road of success.</p>

<p>The chief and Moondyne talked long in the native language. The
sisters, wrapped in soft furs, sat and listened, their large eyes
fixed on the face of the Moondyne, their keen senses enjoying a novel
pleasure as they heard their familiar words strangely sounded on his
lips.</p>

<p>To their simple minds the strongly marked white face must have
appeared almost superhuman, known as it had long been to them by
hearsay and the unqualified affection of their people.</p>

<p>Their girlhood was on the verge of something fuller; they felt a
new and delicious joy in listening to the deep, musical tones of the
Moondyne. They had long heard how strong and brave he was; they saw
that he was gentle when he spoke to them and the old chief. When he
addressed them, it seemed that the same thrill of pleasure touched
the hearts and lighted the faces of both sisters.</p>

<p>"One outside, and two here," was the dread burden of the
sergeant's thought. "Two days' ride--but, can I be sure of the
way?"</p>

<p>Again and again his furtive eyes turned on the ardent faces of the
girls.</p>

<p>"Ay, that will do," he thought; "these can be used to help me
out."</p>

<p>The sisters retired to a tent of skins, and, lighting a fire at
the opening to drive off the evil spirit, lay down to rest. Sleep
came slowly to every member of the party.</p>

<p>The old chief pondered on the presence of the stranger, who now
held the primal secret of the native race.</p>

<p>The sergeant revolved his plans, going carefully over every detail
of the next day's work, foreseeing and providing for every difficulty
with devilish ingenuity.</p>

<p>The sisters lay in dreamy wakefulness, hearing again the deep
musical voice, and seeing in the darkness the strange white face of
the Moondyne.</p>

<p>Before sleeping, Moondyne walked into the valley, and lifting his
face to heaven, in simple and manful directness, thanked God for his
deliverance; then, stretching himself beside the fire, he fell into a
profound sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, Moondyne spoke to Koro and Tapairu in their own
tongue, which was not guttural on their lips. They told him, with
much earnest gesture and flashing of eyes, about the emu's nest in
the valley beyond the lake, and other such things as made up their
daily life. Their steps were light about the camp that morning.</p>

<p>At an early hour the old man entered the gold mine, and did not
return. To look after the horses, Moondyne, with the girls, crossed
the valley, and then went up the mountain towards the emu's nest.</p>

<p>The sergeant, with bloodshot eyes from a sleepless night, had hung
around the camp all the morning, feeling that, though his presence
seemed unheeded, he was in the deepest thought of all.</p>

<p>Whatever his purpose, it was settled now. There was dark meaning
in the look that followed Moondyne and the girls till they
disappeared on the wooded mountain. When at last they were out of
sight and hearing, he arose suddenly and moved towards the mouth of
the mine. At that moment, the young bushman from the outpost emerged
from the pass, and walked rapidly to the fire, looking around
inquiringly for Moondyne and the girls.</p>

<p>As the sergeant explained in dumb show that they had gone up the
mountain yonder, there rose a gleam of hideous satisfaction in his
eyes. The danger he had dreaded most had come to his hand to be
destroyed. All through the night he had heard the whirr of a spear
from an unseen hand, and he shuddered at the danger of riding through
the pass to escape. But there was no other course open. Were he to
cross the mountains, he knew that without a guide he never could
reach the penal colony.</p>

<p>Had the sage Te-mana-roa been present, he would at once have sent
the bushman back to his duty. But the youth had drawn his spear from
the tuad tree at the outpost, and he proceeded to harden again its
injured point in the embers of the fire.</p>

<p>The sergeant, who had carelessly sauntered around the fire till he
stood behind the bushman, now took a stride towards him, then
suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>Had the native looked around at the moment, he would have sent his
spear through the stranger's heart as swiftly as he drove it into the
tuad yesterday. There was murder in the sergeant's face as he took
the silent stride, and paused, his hand on his pistol.</p>

<p>"Not with this," he muttered; "no noise with him. But this will
do."</p>

<p>He stooped for a heavy club, and with a few quick and stealthy
paces stood over the bushman. Another instant, and the club descended
with crushing violence. Without a sound but the deadly blow, the
quivering body fell backward on the assassin's feet.</p>

<p>Rapidly he moved in his terrible work. He crept to the entrance of
the mine, and far within saw the old man moving before the flame.
Pistol in hand he entered the cavern, from which, before many minutes
had passed, he came forth white faced. As he stepped from the cave,
he turned a backward glance of fearful import. He saw that he had
left the light burning behind him.</p>

<p>Warily scanning the mountain side, he dragged the body of the
youth inside the mouth of the cavern; then, seating himself by the
fire, he examined his pistols, and awaited the return of Moondyne and
the girls.</p>

<p>In the sweet peace of the valley, the livid and anxious wretch
seemed the impersonation of crime. He had meditated the whole night
on his purpose. All he feared was partial failure. But he had
provided for every chance; he had more than half succeeded already.
Another hour, and he would be sole master of the treasure--and, with
the sisters in his power, there was no fear of failure.</p>

<p>It was a terrible hour to wait; but at last he saw them coming,
the lithe figures of the girls winding among the trees as they
crossed the valley.</p>

<p>But they were alone: Moondyne was not with them!</p>

<p>They came with bent faces, as if thinking of pleasant things; but
they started with affright, and drew close together, when they saw
the stranger, alone, rise from the fire and come towards them.</p>

<p>With signs, he asked for Moondyne, and they answered that he had
gone across the mountain, and would return when the sun had gone
down. This was an ominous disappointment; but the sergeant knew that
his life would not be worth one day's purchase with such an enemy
behind him. He must wait.</p>

<p>He returned to the fire, the girls keeping distrustfully distant.
He feared they might enter the mine, and too soon discover the
dreadful secret; so, getting between them and the rock, he lay down
at the entrance.</p>

<p>Like startled deer, they looked around, instinctively feeling that
danger was near. The evil eyes of the sergeant never left them. He
had not foreseen this chance and for the moment knew not how to
proceed.</p>

<p>The sisters stood near the fire, alarmed, alert, the left hand of
one in the right of the other. At length their quick eyes fell upon
blood on the sand, and followed the track till they met again the
terrible face at the mouth of the mine.</p>

<p>And, as they looked, a sight beyond the prostrate man, coming from
the dark entrance, froze their hearts with terror.</p>

<p>The face of the aged chief, his white hair discoloured with blood,
appeared above the dreadful watcher, and looked out towards the
girls. The old man, who had dragged his wounded body from the cave,
rose to his feet when he saw the sisters, tottered forward with a cry
of warning, and fell across the murderer.</p>

<p>Paralyzed with horror, the sergeant could not move for some
moments. But soon feeling that he was not attacked, he pushed aside
the senseless body, and sprang to his feet with a terrible
malediction. In that moment of his blind terror the girls had
disappeared.</p>

<p>He ran hither and thither searching for them, but found no trace
of their hiding place or path of escape. At length he gave up the
search, a shivering dread growing upon him every instant, and
hastened to catch the horses. He began to realize that his well-laid
plan was a failure.</p>

<p>There was now only one course open. He must take his chance alone,
and ride for his life, neither resting nor sleeping. The girls would
run straight to Moondyne; and he must act speedily to get beyond his
reach.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the horses were ready, standing at the entrance
of the mine. The sergeant entered, and, passing the flaming basin,
loaded himself with bars and plates of gold. Again and again he
returned, till the horses were laden with treasure. Then, mounting,
he called the dogs; but they had gone with Moondyne.</p>

<p>Once more the chill of fear struck like an icicle through his
heart at his utter loneliness. Leading the spare horse by the bridle,
he rode headlong into the ravine and disappeared.</p>

<h2>ON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p>IT was evening and the twilight was grey in the little valley,
when Moondyne reached the camp. He was surprised to find the place
deserted. He had expected a welcome--had been thinking, perhaps, of
the glad faces that would greet him as he approached the fire. But
the fire was black, the embers were cold. He looked and saw that
there was no light in the gold mine.</p>

<p>A dreadful presentiment grew upon him. A glance for the saddles,
and another across the valley, and he knew that the horses were gone.
Following the strange action of the dogs, he strode towards the cave,
and there, at the entrance, read the terrible story.</p>

<p>The sight struck this strange convict like a physical blow. His
limbs failed him, and his body sank till he knelt on the sand at the
mouth of the mine. He felt no wrath, but only crushing
self-accusation.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!" was the intense cry of heart and brain: "God
forgive me for this crime!"</p>

<p>The consequence of his fatal selfishness crushed him; and the
outstretched arms of the old chief, whose unconsciousness--for he was
not dead--was fearfully like death, seemed to call down curses on the
destroyer of his people.</p>

<p>The years of his life went miserably down before Moondyne till he
grovelled in the desolation of his dismal abasement. A ban had
followed him, and blighted all he had touched.</p>

<p>Years were pressed into minutes as he crouched beside the maimed
bodies of his friends. The living man lay as motionless as the dead.
The strong mind brought up the whole scene for judgment. His inward
eye saw the fleeing murderer; but he felt more of pity for the wretch
than of vengeance. The entire sensibility of Moondyne was
concentrated in the line of his own conscience. Himself accused
himself--and should the criminal condemn another?</p>

<p>When at last he raised his face, with a new thought of duty, the
trace of the unutterable hour was graven upon him in deep lines.</p>

<p>Where were the sisters? Had they been sacrificed too? By the
moonlight he searched the valley; he entered the cave, and called
through all its passages. It was past midnight when he gave up the
search and stood alone in the desolate place. In the loose sand of
the valley he scooped a grave, to which he carried the body of the
young bushman, and buried it. When this was done he proceeded to
perform a like office for Te-mana-roa, but looking toward the cave he
was startled at the sight of the sisters, one of whom, Koro, stood as
if watching him, while the other, aided by an extremely old woman,
was tending on the almost dying chief, whose consciousness was slowly
returning.</p>

<p>Benumbed and silent, Moondyne approached the cave. The girl who
had watched him shrank back to the others. Tapairu, the younger
sister, rose and faced the white man with a threatening aspect. She
pointed her finger towards the pass.</p>

<p>"Go!" she said, sternly, in her own tongue.</p>

<p>Moondyne paused and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Begone!" she cried, still pointing; and once again came the
words, "begone, accursed!"</p>

<p>Remorse had strangled grief in Moondyne's breast, or the agony of
the girl, uttered in this terrible reproach, would have almost killed
him. Accursed she said, and he knew that the word was true.</p>

<p>He turned from the place, not towards the pass, but towards the
mountains, and walked from the valley with an aimless purpose, and a
heart filled with ashes.</p>

<p>For hours he held steadily on, heedless of direction. He marked no
places--had no thoughts--only the one gnawing and consuming presence
of the ruin he had wrought.</p>

<p>The dogs followed him, tired and spiritless. The moon sank, and
the sun rose, and still the lonely man held his straight and aimless
road--across mountains and through ravines, until at last his
consciousness was recalled as he recognized the valley in which he
stood as one he had travelled two days before, on the way to the gold
mine.</p>

<p>Stretching his exhausted body on a sheltered bank beside stream,
he fell into a deep sleep that lasted many hours.</p>

<p>He awoke with a start, as if a voice had called him. In an instant
his brow was set and his mind determined. He glanced at the sun to
settle his direction, and then walked slowly across the valley,
intently observing the ground. Before he'd had taken a hundred paces
he stopped suddenly, turned at right angles down the valley, and
strode on with a purpose, that though rapidly, almost instantaneously
formed, had evidently taken full possession of his will.</p>

<p>Sometimes persons of keen sensibility lie down to sleep with a
trouble on the mind, and an unsettled purpose, and wake in the night
to find the brain clear and the problem solved. From this process of
unconscious cerebration Moondyne awoke with a complete and settled
resolution.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of the determination in his mind. He had
struck the trail of the murderer.</p>

<p>There was no more indirection or hesitation in his manner. He
settled down to the pursuit with a grim and terrible earnestness. His
purpose was clear before him--to stop the devil he had let loose--to
prevent the escape of the assassin--to save the people who had
trusted and saved him.</p>

<p>He would not turn from this intent though the track led him to the
prison gate of Fremantle; and even there, in the face of the guards,
he would slay the wretch before he had betrayed the secret. Death is
on the trail of every man; but we have grown used to him, and heed
him not. Crime and Sin are following us--will surely find us out, and
some day will open the cowl and show us the death's-head. But more
terrible than these Fates, because more physically real, is the
knowledge, ever present, that a relentless human enemy is on our
track.</p>

<p>Through the silent passes of the hills, his heart a storm of fears
and hopes, the sergeant fled toward security. Every mile added to the
light ahead. He rode wildly and without rest--rode all day and into
the night, and would still have hurried on, but the horses failed and
must have rest.</p>

<p>He fed and watered them, watching with feverish eyes the renewal
of their strength; and as he watched them eat, the wretched man fell
into a sleep, from which he started in terror, fearful that the
pursuer was upon him.</p>

<p>Through the day and night, depending on his great strength,
Moondyne followed. While the fugitive rested, he strode on; and he
knew by instinct and observation that he was gaining in the race.</p>

<p>Every hour the tracks were fresher. On the morning of the second
day, he had found the sand still moist where the horses had drunk
from a stream. On the evening of that day he passed the burning
embers of a fire. The murderer was gaining confidence, and taking
longer rest.</p>

<p>The third day came with a revelation to Moondyne. The sergeant had
lost the way--had turned from the valley that led towards the
settlement, and had sealed his doom by choosing one that reached
towards the immeasurable deserts of the interior.</p>

<p>The pursuer was not stayed by the discovery. To the prison or the
wilderness, should the track lead, he would follow.</p>

<p>At first the new direction was pleasant. Dim woods on either side
of a stream, the banks fringed with verdure and flanked with bright
flowers. But like the pleasant ways of life, the tempting valley led
to the desolate plains; before night had closed, pursuer and pursued
were far from the hills and streams, in the midst of a treeless sea
of sand.</p>

<p>Nothing but fear of death could drive the sergeant forward. He was
bushman enough to know the danger of being lost on the plains. But he
dare not return to meet him whom he knew was hunting him down.</p>

<p>There was but one chance before him, and this was to tire out the
pursuer--if, as his heart suggested, there was only one in
pursuit--to lead him farther and farther into the desert, till he
fell on the barren track and died.</p>

<p>It was sore travelling for horse and man under the blazing sun,
with no food or water save what he pressed from the pith of the
palms, and even these were growing scarce. The only life on the
plains was the hard and dusty scrub. Every hour brought a more
hopeless and grislier desolation.</p>

<p>How was it with Moondyne? The strong will still upheld him. He
knew he had gained till they took to the plains; but he also knew
that here the mounted man had the advantage. Every day the track was
less distinct, and he suffered more and more from thirst. The palms
he passed had been opened by the sergeant; and he had to leave the
trail to find one untouched. The sun flamed in the bare sky, and the
sand was so hot that the air hung above it in a tremulous haze. In
the woods the dogs had brought him food; but no living thing was to
be hunted on the plains. He had lived two days on the pith of the
palms.</p>

<p>On the third day Moondyne with difficulty found the sand trail,
which had been blown over by the night breeze. He had slept on the
shelterless desert and had dreamt of sweet wells of water as the
light dew fell on his parched body.</p>

<p>This day he was quite alone. The dogs, suffering from thirst, had
deserted him in the night.</p>

<p>He began the day with a firm heart but an unsteady step. There was
not a palm in sight. It was hot noon before he found a small scrub to
moisten his throat and lips.</p>

<p>But to-day, he thought, he must come face to face with the
villain, and would kill him like a wild beast on the desert; and the
thought upheld him.</p>

<p>His head was bare and his body nearly naked. Another man would
have fallen senseless under the cruel sun; but Moondyne did not even
rest--as the day passed he did not seem to need rest.</p>

<p>It was strange how pleasant, how like a dream, part of that day
appeared. Sometimes he seemed to be awake, and to know that he was
moving over the sand, and with a dread purpose; but at these times he
knew that the trail had disappeared--that he was blindly going
forward, lost on the wilderness. Toward evening the cool breeze
creeping over the sand dispelled the dreams and made him mercilessly
conscious.</p>

<p>The large red sun was standing on the horizon of sand, and an
awful shadow seemed waiting to fall upon the desert.</p>

<p>When the sun had gone down, and the wanderer looked at the stars,
there came to him a new Thought, like a friend, with a grave but not
unkind face--a vast and solemn Thought, that held him for a long time
with upraised face and hands, as if it had been whispered from the
deep quiet sky. Slowly he walked with his new communion, and when he
saw before him in the moonlight two palms, he did not rush to cut
them open, but stood beside them smiling. Opening one, at length, he
took the morsel of pith, and ate, and slept.</p>

<p>How sweet it was to wake up and see the wide sky studded with
golden stars--to feel that there were no bonds any more, nor hopes,
nor heart-burnings.</p>

<p>The Divine Thought that had come to him the day before was with
him still--grave and kindly, and now they two were so utterly alone,
it seemed almost to smile. He raised his body and knelt upon the
sand, looking upward, and all things seemed closing quietly in upon
him, as if coming to a great rest, and he would have lain down on the
sand at peace; but a cry, a human-like cry, startled him into
wakefulness--surely it was a cry!</p>

<p>It was clear, and near, and full of suffering. Surely he had
heard--he had not dreamt of such a cry. Again--God! how near and how
keen it was--from the darkness--a cry of mortal agony!</p>

<p>With a tottering step Moondyne ran towards the woeful sound. He
saw by the moonlight a dark object on the sand. The long, weak cry
hurried him on, till he stood beside the poor throat whence it came,
and was smote with pity at the dismal sight.</p>

<p>On the sand lay two horses chained at the neck--one dead, the
other dying in an agony of thirst and imprisonment. Beside the dead
horse almost buried in the sand, as he had fallen from the saddle,
lay a man, seemingly dead, but whose glazing eyes turned with hideous
suffering as Moondyne approached. The wretched being was powerless to
free himself from the fallen horse; and upon his body, and all around
him, were scattered heavy bars and plates of gold.</p>

<p>Moondyne loosed the chain from the suffering horse, that struggled
to its feet, ran forward a few yards, and fell dead on the sand.</p>

<p>The men's eyes met, and the blistered lips of the sergeant for it
was he--moved in piteous appeal. Moondyne paused one stern moment,
then turned and ran from the place--ran towards the palm near which
he bad slept. With hasty hand he tore it open and cut out the pith,
and sped back to the sufferer. He knelt down, and squeezed the
precious moisture into the mouth of the dying man--the man whom he
had followed into the desert to kill like a wild beast.</p>

<p>Till the last drop was gone he pressed the young wood. Then the
guilty wretch raised his eyes and looked at Moondyne--the glazed eyes
grew bright, and brighter, till a tear rose within them, and rolled
down the stained and sinlined face. The baked lips moved, and the
weak hands were raised imploringly. The sergeant back dead.</p>

<p>Moondyne knew that his last breath was contrition, and his last
dumb cry, "Pardon."</p>

<p>Then, too, the strength went from the limbs and the light from the
eyes of Moondyne--and as he sank to the earth, the great Thought that
had come to him filled his heart with peace--and he lay unconscious
beside the dead.</p>

<p>The sun rose on the desert, but the sleeper did not move. Before
the day was an hour old, other forms rapidly crossed the plain--not
wanderers, but fierce, skin-clad men, in search of vengeance.</p>

<p>They flung themselves from their horses when they reached the
scene; and one, throwing himself upon the body of the sergeant,
sprang back with a guttural cry of wrath and disappointment, which
was echoed by the savage party.</p>

<p>Next moment, one of the natives, stooping to lay his hand on the
heart of the Moondyne, uttered an excited call. The spearmen crowded
around, and one poured water from a skin on the face and body of the
senseless man.</p>

<p>They raised him to the arms of a strong rider, while another took
the reins, and the wild party struck off at a fall gallop towards the
mountains.</p>

<p>When Moondyne returned to consciousness, many days after his
rescue, he was free from pursuit, he had cut for ever the bond of the
Penal Colony; above him bent the deep eyes and kind faces of the old
chief and the sisters, Koro and Tapairu, and around him were the
hills that shut in the Valley of the Vasse Gold Mine.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes again and seemed to sleep for a little while.
Then he looked up and met the face of Te-mana-roa kindly watching
him.</p>

<p>"I am free!" he only said. Then turning to the sisters: "I am not
accursed;" and Koro and Tapairu. answered with kind smiles.</p>

<h1>BOOK TWO<br>THE SANDALWOOD TRADE.</h1>

<h2>THE MATE OF THE CANTON.</h2>

<p>IT is midwinter, in a little Lancashire village on the coast, not
far from Liverpool. One quiet main street, crossed by three or four
short side streets, that lead in the summer days into the sweet
meadows and orchards. One of these side streets has only three houses
on one side, separated by goodly gardens. The house in the centre is
the smallest, but it is extremely neat, and the garden fairly glows
with colour.</p>

<p>This is the home of Mrs. Walmsley, a Widow; and the garden is
looked after by herself and her daughter Alice, about sixteen years
old. The house on the right of Mrs. Walmsley's belongs to Mr. Draper,
the richest man in the village, a retired shopkeeper. The house on
the left belongs to Captain Sheridan, a bluff old Irishman retired
from the navy, and now Inspector of Coast Guards, whose family
consists of his son and daughter--Will Sheridan, the son, being just
twenty years old.</p>

<p>At the gate of Draper's garden, opening on the streets, stands a
handsome young man in the uniform of the merchant marine. He is Sam
Draper, first officer of the Canton, arrived a few weeks before from
China.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Alice," he says in a cheerful but not a pleasant
voice, as Alice Walmsley passes down the road.</p>

<p>Alice stopped and chatted lightly for a minute with her old
schoolmate. Draper evidently paid her a compliment, for her cheeks
were flushed as she entered her mother's gate standing near which was
young Sheridan, whom she slightly saluted and hurriedly passed, much
to his surprise, for their relations were, at least, of the oldest
and closest friendship.</p>

<p>"Alice," said Will, in a wondering tone as the girl passed with
her flushed face.</p>

<p>"Well--did you speak?" And she paused and turned her head.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan loved Alice, and she knew it, though no word had
been spoken. He had loved her for years in a boy's way, cherishing
her memory on his long voyages, for Will, too, was a sailor, as were
almost all the young men of the village; but he was soon to leave
home for a two years' service on Sam Draper's vessel, and of late his
heart had been urging him to speak to Alice.</p>

<p>He was a quiet, thoughtful, manly young fellow, with nothing
particular about him, except this strong secret love for the
prettiest girl in the village.</p>

<p>"Yes, I spoke," he answered hesitatingly, as if wounded; but
perhaps you haven't time to listen."</p>

<p>"What is it, Will?" she said in a kindlier tone, and smiling,
though before she spoke she saw with a side glance that Sam Draper
had gone away from the gate.</p>

<p>"O, it isn't anything particular," said Will; "only there's rare
skating on the mill-pond, and I was going there this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And--?" queried Alice, archly.</p>

<p>"Yes--I wish you would," said Will, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I will," she replied, laughingly, "though you
haven't told me yet what I am to do."</p>

<p>"Why, go skating with me," said Will, highly pleased; "Sam Draper
and his sisters are going, and there will be a crowd from the
village. Shall I come for you at three?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "I'll be ready--" and as she turned towards
her mother's house the flush was in her face again.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan walked lightly on, thinking happy thoughts. Passing
Draper's gate, Sam Draper stepped from the shrubbery, whence he had
observed the interview. He was a tall, handsome fellow, with fair
hair and blue eyes; not the soft blue which usually denotes
good-nature, but a pale, slaty blue that has a hard and shallow look.
He had a free and easy way with him, that made people who met him for
the first time think he was cheerful and amiable. But if you observed
him closely you would see, in the midst of a boisterous laugh, that
the cold, blue eyes were keenly watching you, without a particle of
mirth.</p>

<p>There was something never to be forgotten by those who discovered
this double expression in Draper's face. He had a habit of waving his
arms in a boisterous way, and bending his body, as if to emphasize
the heartiness of his laugh or the warmth of his greeting. But while
these visible expressions of jollity were in full play, if you caught
the cold and calculating look from the blue eyes that were weighing
you up while off your guard, you would shudder as if you had looked
suddenly into the eyes of a snake.</p>

<p>Draper knew, too, that his face could be read by keen eyes; and he
tried to mask even the habit of concealment, until, at last, his
duplicity had become extremely artful and hard to be discovered. But
he always knew the people who bad caught his eye and read his soul.
He never tried his boisterous manner on them again, but treated them
gravely and quietly. But these were the people be bated.</p>

<p>Seven years before, when he and Will Sheridan were schoolboys,
Sheridan not only saw through the falsehood of Draper's manner, but
exposed it before the whole school. Nearly every boy in the school
had had some reason to dislike Draper, but his loud, good-natured way
had kept them from speaking. But when Will Sheridan publicly pointed
out the warm laugh and the cold eye, the friendly word and the cruel
act, everyone saw it at a glance, and a public opinion against Draper
was instantly made among his schoolfellows, which no after effort of
his could quite remove.</p>

<p>From that day be nourished in his soul a secret desire to do
Sheridan some injury that would cut him to the quick.</p>

<p>Not that Draper had no friends--indeed, he was always making new
friends--and his new friends were always loud in his praise; but when
they ceased to be new, somehow they ceased to admire Sam Draper, and
either said they were mistaken in their first impression, or said
nothing.</p>

<p>Both young men were sailors. Some years ago the English merchant
service was almost as well ordered and as precise in discipline and
promotion as the Royal Navy, and young men of good position entered
it as a profession. On his last voyage Draper had become first mate;
and Will Sheridan had lately engaged to take his old place on the
Canton as second mate.</p>

<p>As Draper stepped from the shrubbery and hailed Will with a cheery
word, his hand was outstretched in a most cordial way, and his lips
smiled; but his eye was keen and smileless, and as cold as ice. He
had known for years of Will's affection for Alice Walmsley; and it
was commonly said in the village that Alice returned his love.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Alice to go skating this afternoon?" said
Draper.</p>

<p>"I Have just asked her," said Will, "and she is going."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said Draper, in a hearty tone, so far as the sound went;
"I thought she would like to be asked, when I told her, half an hour
ago, we were going."</p>

<p>Will Sheridan had some light word on his lip, but he did not speak
it; and his smile faded, though without apparent cause, while he
looked at Draper's pleasant face.</p>

<p>"She didn't say he had told her," he thought, and somehow the
thought troubled him. But he put it away and forgot all about it
before the afternoon.</p>

<p>The mill-pond was covered with skaters when Will and Alice
arrived. They had often skated together before, and because Alice was
timid on the ice, she used to hold Will's hand or take his arm; and
now and then, and as often as he could, Will's arm was around her, as
he struck out strongly and rapidly.</p>

<p>Unconsciously they had assumed settled relations towards each
other--she resting on him with confidence, and he quite assured of
her trust.</p>

<p>To-day there was a disturbing element somewhere. Before they had
been ten minutes on the ice, Will noticed that Alice was, for the
first time in her life, listening inattentively to his words. And
more than once he saw her looking over his shoulder, as if seeking
someone in the crowd of skaters. After a while she evidently found
whom she had sought, and her face brightened. Will, at the moment,
asked her some question, and she did not hear him at first, but made
him repeat the word.</p>

<p>With a strange sinking of the heart, he followed the direction of
the girl's eyes, and was just in time to see Sam Draper kiss his hand
to her--and Alice smiled.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan was a sensitive and proud young fellow, and his
quick feelings of honour were wounded by what he perhaps too hastily
deemed the deceit of Alice Walmsley. A change had certainly come in
her relation to him, but what right had he to charge her with deceit?
He had no claim on her--had never spoken a word of love to her in his
life.</p>

<p>The evening had closed when he left her at her mother's gate. They
said "Good-night" in a new fashion--the words were as cold as the
wind, and the touch of the hands was brief and formal.</p>

<p>After that Will did not ask Alice to walk or skate with him. He
called no more at her mother's house as he used to do. He went to
none of the usual places of meeting with her. If he had gone, he
should have been all the more lonely; for he could not pretend to be
pleasantly engaged with others while his heart was full of pain and
unrest. But he could not help watching for her from his room window;
and surely it were better for his happiness had he overcome this
too.</p>

<p>He saw that where he used to be, there every day was his rival. He
heard Draper's loud and happy voice and laughter--and he noticed that
Alice was happier and far more boisterous than ever he had known
her--and that her happiness and gaiety became even louder when she
knew he was observing.</p>

<p>But at last came the time of the Canton's sailing. On the evening
before leaving, Will Sheridan went to Mrs. Walmsley's to say
good-bye, and, as Alice was not there, he remained talking with her
mother, with whom he had always been a favourite. After a while he
heard the gate swing, and saw Alice approaching the house, and Draper
looking after her from the gate.</p>

<p>When Alice entered, he was standing and bidding farewell to her
mother, who was weeping quietly.</p>

<p>Alice understood all, and the flush faded from her cheek.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Alice," he said, holding out his hand. "You know I am
going away in the morning." He had walked towards the door as he
spoke, keeping her hand, and now they stood in the porch.</p>

<p>He saw the tears in her eyes, and his courage gave way, for he had
only a boy's heart to bear a man's grief; and he covered his face
with his hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was calm, and he bent over the weeping girl.
"Alice," he whispered, tenderly, and she raised her tear-stained face
to his breast. Poor Will, yearning to take her in his arms,
remembering what he had seen, only pressed her hands in his, and,
stooping, kissed her on the forehead again and again Then he walked,
tear-blinded, down the straight path to the gate.</p>

<p>A moment after, he felt a man's hand on his collar, and, turning,
met the hard eyes of Draper. Sheridan's face was still quivering with
the powerful emotion.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Draper?" he demanded angrily, dashing the hand
aside.</p>

<p>"I mean to let you know," said Draper, contemptuously, weighing
the words, "that I saw all your snivelling scene, and that I have
seen all your impertinent attentions to that girl."</p>

<p>Will Sheridan controlled himself by a violent effort, because the
name of Alice Walmsley was in question.</p>

<p>"That girl, as you impertinently call her," he said, calmly, "is
one of my oldest friends. My attentions have never been impertinent
to her."</p>

<p>"You lie, you cur!" brutally answered Draper.</p>

<p>Though few words had been spoken, here was the culmination of an
enmity that was old and rankling. On both sides there had been
repression of feeling; but now the match had touched the powder, and
the wrath flamed.</p>

<p>The word had barely passed the insulter's lips, when he reeled and
tumbled headlong from Sheridan's terrible blow. As soon as the blow
was delivered, Will turned, and walked towards his own home, never
even looking behind.</p>

<p>It was half a minute before Draper picked himself from the frozen
earth, still dazed with the shock. He showed no desire to follow, or
continue the quarrel. With teeth set like a vice, and a livid face,
he looked after the strong figure of Will, till he turned into his
father's house.</p>

<p>Next day the young men left the village, and entered on their duty
as officers of the Canton, which lay in a Liverpool dock. No one knew
of their quarrel, as neither had spoken of it, and there had been no
witnesses.</p>

<p>The preparations for sea kept them apart for several days the
vessel sailed from Liverpool, and soon cleared the Channel. Two weeks
later, when the ship passed, on a beautiful night, within right of
the Western Islands, the young men came face to face on the poop.
Will Sheridan had come on deck to enjoy the delightful scene, not
thinking that the first mate was officer of the watch.</p>

<p>"Draper," said Will, in a friendly tone, holding out his hand when
they met, "I did not know you were engaged to Miss Walmsley. We
should both be sorry for what happened that night."</p>

<p>The eyes of Draper glittered like steel as he answered in a
sneering tone--</p>

<p>"And who told you, Sir, that I was engaged?"</p>

<p>"I judge so from your conduct," said Will.</p>

<p>"You are not a good judge, then," answered Draper.</p>

<p>"Then there's all the less reason for us to quarrel, man. Take
back your insulting words, and let me apologize for my violence."</p>

<p>"My insulting words--let me see, what were they? Ah, yes,"--he
spoke slowly, as if he meant to wound with the repetition--"I think I
said that I had been a witness to your snivelling scene of
farewell--and that I was acquainted with your unsought and
impertinent attentions to that girl. By the way, I may tell you that
she herself made me acquainted with the offensive persistence of her
obtuse admirer."</p>

<p>"She told you?" said Will, staggered by the word. "She said my
love was offensive to her?"</p>

<p>"Ha! No--not love exactly," said the other, with the same biting
sneer; "I believe you never gave her a chance to fling that in your
teeth."</p>

<p>"Take care, Draper!" said Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Well, let us go on with the insulting words, as you choose to
call them. I also said you were a liar, if I remember well and a
cur--did I not?"</p>

<p>"Why do you repeat the foul words, man?" asked Sheridan,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Why, because I used them after careful choosing and because they
are true! Stay!--" he added, raising his voice, and backing to the
rail, as he saw Sheridan approaching. "I am the first officer of this
ship, and if you dare to raise your hand against me, I will shoot you
like a dog. We'll have no mutiny here."</p>

<p>"Mutiny!" cried Sheridan, more astounded and puzzled than angry.
"What in heaven's name are you talking about? I want to be calm,
Draper, for old times' sake. You call me vile names, and threaten my
life, and yet I have given you no earthly cause. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, that he who pretends to be my friend, while he ruins my
character, is a liar; and that he who tells a slander in secret is a
coward."</p>

<p>"Slander your character?" said Sheridan, "I never said an ill word
of you--though I have unwillingly become acquainted with some things
that I wish I had never known."</p>

<p>The latter part of the sentence was slowly added. Draper winced as
if cut with a whip.</p>

<p>"You have made a charge" continued Sheridan, sternly, "and you
must explain it. How have I slandered you?"</p>

<p>Draper hesitated. He hated the man before him, like a fiend; but
he hated still more the subject he had now to touch.</p>

<p>"You knew about that girl in Calcutta," he said, now fairly livid
with passion; "no one in England knew it but you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sheridan, slowly, "I learned something about it,
against my will."</p>

<p>"Against your will," sneered the other, "was it against your will
you told the story to--her?"</p>

<p>Draper never repeated Alice's name, as if it were unpleasant to
his tongue.</p>

<p>"I never mentioned your shameful affairs," answered Sheridan, with
scorn and indignation; "but you are justly punished to have thought
so."</p>

<p>"You did tell her!" cried Draper, terribly excited; "you told her
about my marriage in Calcutta."</p>

<p>"Your marriage!" and Sheridan stepped back, as recoiling from a
reptile. Then, after a pause, as if speaking to a condemned
culprit--</p>

<p>"Your infamy is deeper than I thought. I did not know till now
that your victim in Calcutta was also your wife."</p>

<p>With lightning rapidity Draper saw the dreadful confession his
error had led him into. He knew that Sheridan spoke the truth, and he
hurriedly attempted to close the grave he had exposed.</p>

<p>"She is dead," he said, searching Sheridan's face; "you should
have known that, too."</p>

<p>"Dead or alive, God have pity on her!" answered Sheridan whose
face and voice were filled with revulsion and contempt. "For her
sake, I pray that she may be dead; but I do not believe you. I shall
see that those be warned in time who are still in danger."</p>

<p>Sheridan deliberately turned on his heel and entered the cabin,
while Draper, confounded and dismayed at his self conviction, leant
on the rail looking out at sea, cursing his own stupidity that had
betrayed him.</p>

<p>"Who else could have known?" he muttered; "and who else could have
told her? But she doesn't wholly believe it and, when I swore it was
false that last evening, I think she believed me. I'll take care, at
all events, that he shall have no chance to unsay my word."</p>

<p>For hours the brooding rascal walked the poop deck, till the watch
was changed, when he went below, and tried to sleep.</p>

<h2>COUNTERMINING THE MINER.</h2>

<p>WILL SHERIDAN'S life on the Canton was a restless and unhappy one
from the night of his altercation with Draper. He was daily
associated with a man who had exposed his own villainy; a caitiff so
vile, that he had sought, and probably still intended, to blight the
life of a girl he had known from childhood.</p>

<p>The discipline of the ship required a certain courtesy and respect
towards the first officer. This formal recognition Will paid, but
nothing more.</p>

<p>A few days after this meeting Draper made an advance towards
intimacy; but this was repelled with such cold severity as showed him
that he had nothing to expect in future from Sheridan's
forbearance.</p>

<p>"Do not dare to address me as a friend again," Will said, sternly;
"I shall write to England from the first port, and expose you as the
scoundrel you are."</p>

<p>Draper's dry lips--his lips were always dry--moved as if he were
speaking, but no words came. His shallow eyes became wells of hate.
He passed by Sheridan without reply, and went to his room.</p>

<p>There are a hundred ways in which the chief officer of a large
ship can grind his inferiors; and Sheridan every day felt the subtle
malevolence of his enemy. But these persecutions he did not heed. He
knew that underneath these symptoms lay a more dangerous rancour
that, sooner or later, would try to do him a deadly injury.</p>

<p>What the form of the attack might be, he knew not. But he prepared
himself for emergencies. Will Sheridan was not only a brave and
straightforward young fellow, but he had a clever head on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why should I let this cunning scoundrel injure me?" he asked
himself. "His villainy is easily seen through--and I'm going to watch
him closely."</p>

<p>He did watch him, and it served him well. Every secret and
dangerous move he saw and disarranged. A trumped-up plan of mutiny
among the men--which would have excused bloodshed, and the shooting
of an officer, perhaps, by accident--he nipped in the bud, and almost
exposed the machinations of him who hatched it.</p>

<p>Draper soon understood that he was playing with his master, and
changed his method. He began to wait for an opportunity instead of
making one.</p>

<p>This will be the case almost invariably; when honest men axe
fighting cowards and slanderers, the surest way to defeat them is by
constant watchfulness. Evil-minded people are generally shallow, and
easily countermined. Only, when they axe countermined, they should be
blown up, and never spared.</p>

<p>The Canton touched at Singapore for orders, and was detained a
week. Will Sheridan resolved that on the night before she sailed he
would leave the ship. Draper seemed to divine his purpose, and
watched him like a tiger. But Will's constant attention to duty, and
his equable temper, deceived the watcher.</p>

<p>The night before the Canton was to sail, Will dropt a bundle into
a dinghy under the bow, swung himself after it, and went ashore. A
close search was made for him next day by the police, headed by
Draper, the law in those ports being rigid against deserters. But he
could not be found, and the Canton sailed without her second
officer.</p>

<p>The first thing Will Sheridan did when he knew he was out of
danger was to write to Mrs. Walmsley, warning her of Draper's
marriage in India. This done, he set about getting some sort of
employment.</p>

<p>He was in a strange place, and he knew no business except that of
the sea. In a few days he shipped as mate on a barque bound found for
West Australia, in the sandalwood trade.</p>

<p>A large and lucrative trade in sandalwood is carried on between
China, India, and the penal colony. Vast districts in West Australia
are covered with this precious wood, which is cut by ticket-of-leave
men, and shipped to China and India, where it is used in the burning
of incense in the Josshouses or temples, and in the delicate cabinet
and marquetry work which is so plentiful in oriental countries.</p>

<p>This was a life that suited Sheridan's vigorous temperament. He
found his occupation pleasant, and would have quite forgotten the
enmity of Draper; but he still feared that his influence over Alice
Walmsley had not been broken.</p>

<p>He spent a year in the sandalwood trade, and was thinking of
taking a trip to England, when he received a package through the
post-office at Shanghai, containing all his letters, and a brief
unfriendly message in Alice Walmsley's handwriting, informing him
that she was Captain Draper's Wife, and that she scorned the cowardly
nature that sought to destroy an honourable man's good name by
malicious falsehood.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan was dumbfounded and grieved to the heart. In all he
had previously borne, in his efforts to crush out of his heart a
hopeless passion almost as strong as his life, he had, he thought,
sounded the depths of his love for Alice Walmsley. But now, when he
knew her utterly beyond his reach, and saw opening before her a
desert life of misery and despair, the pity in his heart almost
killed him. He would have given his life then that his enemy might be
an honourable man. Her letter did not wound him, because he knew she
had been deceived.</p>

<p>At first, he knew not what to do. He feared he had been hasty--he
did not actually know that Draper was a villain his own accusing word
was not enough, perhaps, or it might bear an explanation. Should he
write to Alice and take back his cruel charges? Or should he remain
silent, and let time unravel the trouble?</p>

<p>To do the first would be wrong--to do the second might be woefully
unjust. The true course was to find out the truth; to go to Calcutta
and learn for himself; and if he were wrong, to publicly make
acknowledgment. If he were right, he could remain silent if it were
for the best.</p>

<p>Two months afterwards, Will Sheridan returned from Calcutta to
Shanghai. He had found out the truth. He proceeded at once to West
Australia to join his ship, and from that time he wrote no more to
England. One part of his life, the sweet and tender part, without
fault of his, had suffered woefully, and had died before his eyes. It
was shrouded in his memory, and buried in his heart. Like a brave
man, he would not sit and mourn over the loss. He set his face to his
duty, hoping and praying that time would take the gnawing pain from
his heart.</p>

<h2>THE SANDALWOOD AGENCY.</h2>

<p>ABOUT a year after his trip to Calcutta, while his ship lay in
Shanghai, Sheridan received an invitation to dinner from the chief
owner, a wealthy and acute old Scotchman, whose palatial residence
and beautiful grounds overlooked the town. He was surprised at the
courtesy, and showed the invitation to the captain, a kind old
sailor, who had formed an affection for Will from the first.</p>

<p>"Go, go, my lad," said Captain Mathews. "It's a piece of luck, no
doubt. I've heard that the old man has a daughter, or a niece, though
I believe she's rather tough; but what's that, when she has a
shipload of money? You're in luck, youngster; of course you'll go,
and in your best rig, too. I'll lend you my old claw-hammer
coat."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain," said Will, smiling inwardly, as his eye took
in the short but portly dimensions of his old friend; "but I think
I'll go as a plain sailor, without any pretence at society
dress."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but you're right, Sheridan," responded the
captain;" a sailor's jacket is fit for any man or any place, lad,
when he who wears it loves his profession, and is worthy of it."</p>

<p>That evening saw Will Sheridan enter Mr. MacKay's drawing-room, as
handsome and gentlemanly a fellow as ever gave an order through a
trumpet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," said the kind old merchant, coming forward to meet
him, "you are welcome, for your own sake, and for that of a dear old
friend. You are not aware, I think, that your father and I were
midshipmen together forty years ago."</p>

<p>Will was surprised, but gratified. He had half expected to be
patronized, and indeed was more than half prepared to resent such
treatment. Mr. MacKay presented Will to his family--Mrs. MacKay, an
invalid, and his step-daughter, Miss Gifford, a handsome, buxom,
good-natured maiden lady of a certain age.</p>

<p>They were all very kind, and they treated Will as an old and
privileged friend. He forgot all about the patronage, and enjoyed
himself immensely. Such an evening of home life, after years of
rugged seafaring, was delightfully restful.</p>

<p>At dinner, Mr. MacKay recalled story after story of the time when
he and Will's father were careless youngsters on His Majesty's ship
Cumberland. Will was still more surprised to find that Mr. MacKay had
recently been in communication with his father.</p>

<p>"I saw your papers, Mr. Sheridan," explained Mr. MacKay; "and
knowing that my old friend was in the Coastguard Service in England,
I wrote to him. I found I was right in my conclusion; but I thought I
would say nothing about the matter for some time. You will pardon me
when I tell you that I have been observing you closely since you
entered the service of our Company."</p>

<p>This was the first reference to their relative positions which had
been made. Will did not know what to answer.</p>

<p>"You have seen a good deal of our sandalwood trade," said Mr.
MacKay, changing the subject; "what do you think of its prospects,
Mr. Sheridan?"</p>

<p>This was too extensive a question for Will, and he faltered in his
reply. He had, he said, only considered his own duties in the trade,
and they offered a limited scope for observation.</p>

<p>The old merchant, however, returned to the point.</p>

<p>"Captain Mathews tells me that you have expressed to him your
dissatisfaction at the management of our affairs in West
Australia."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," answered Will, with a smile, "not with the management,
but with the mismanagement."</p>

<p>"Ah, just so," said Mr. MacKay, "we will talk more about this
by-and-by."</p>

<p>When the ladies had retired, Mr. MacKay again took up the
subject.</p>

<p>"You think our affairs in Australia are mismanaged, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, it appears to me there is no system whatever on the
other side, so far as the Company's interests are concerned."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked the keen business man opening his eyes. "Does
not our agent purchase and ship the sandalwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he certainly does, and that's all be does--and that's
nothing," said blunt Will, "at least for the Company's benefit."</p>

<p>"Please explain," said Mr. MacKay, nervously.</p>

<p>"Well," said Will, in his earliest way when interested, "as you
know, the sandalwood is cut away in the bush, from sixty to a hundred
miles from the shipping station at Bunbury. It is cut by
ticket-of-leave men. From them it is bought by speculators, who team
it to Bunbury; and from these fellows, who manage to control the
wood, your agent buys it at the wharf, paying whatever price is
asked."</p>

<p>"You would have him do more?" asked Mr. MacKay.</p>

<p>"I would change the whole plan, sir, if it were my concern. First,
I would lease all or as much as I could, of the sandalwood land
direct from the Government, then I would set my hired cutters to work
and then carry the wood in my own teams to the wharf. The original
cost can be decreased by at least fifty per cent. And, besides this,
there are other valuable substances, such as gum, tan-bark, and
skins, that could be carried and shipped at the same time."</p>

<p>The merchant listened attentively to the broad outline of Will's
plans, which he spoke about quite freely, as one outside the matter,
but familiar with it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," said Mr. MacKay at length "our Company has decided
to change our agent in West Australia, and it gives me great pleasure
to offer you the position. I will see," he added, interrupting Will's
surprised exclamation, "that you shall have sufficient power at your
disposal to carry out your ideas with regard to the extension of the
trade."</p>

<p>Will hardly heard another word for the rest of the evening. His
mind scarcely took in the change--from the poor and unknown sailor,
at one step, to a man of large influence and position, for such would
be the Australian agent of so wealthy a Company.</p>

<p>When he returned to the ship his face flamed with excitement, as
he related the wonderful story to his old friend Captain Mathews, who
became even more excited than Will and declared many times over his
glass of "Old Tom," "that they were beginning to see things right at
last," and that "no man could do land business so well as him who was
trained at sea," and divers other sentences filled with wisdom drawn
from personal pride and marine philosophy.</p>

<h2>THE TEAMSTERS' TAVERN.</h2>

<p>"CURSE that fellow!" hissed Lame Scotty through his clenched
teeth; "I hate him." The word was emphasized by a blow on the rickety
table that made the glasses jump.</p>

<p>The scene was a public-house in the little mahogany town of
Bunbury, West Australia; the time, six months after Will Sheridan had
assumed the sandalwood agency. The speaker was a ticket-of-leave man,
a wiry, red-eyed fellow of middle age, whose face had the cunning
ferocity of a ferret. His auditors were a shaggy crowd of woodcutters
and ex-convict teamsters, the latter group sitting, with him at a
long table.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud, Scotty," said a rough-looking man of immense
stature, with an axe strapped on his back, who leant smoking against
the fireplace; "don't shout so, my friend, or Agent Sheridan will
hear it, and kick you out of the team he gave you for charity."</p>

<p>"Kick me out!" retorted Scotty, with an oath; "he daren't touch
me. Curse his charity; he gave me a team for his own interest."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said the big woodcutter, without moving, "you were always a
brag. He gave work and wages to you and a lot of your ugly gang
there, for downright charity; and, like the hounds you always were,
you have no thanks in you."</p>

<p>Though the gang so broadly referred to were at the table with
Scotty, no one resented the woodcutter's epithet, though dark looks
were flung at him.</p>

<p>"This agent has ruined the sandalwood trade," said Scotty,
addressing himself to the aroused woodcutters. "Before he came here,
a poor man could earn a few pounds; but now we ain't any better than
chain-gang men."</p>

<p>A murmur of approval from the teamsters followed the remark, and
Scotty felt that he had struck a popular note. Even one or two of the
woodcutters at another table struck the board in approval.</p>

<p>"No, you ain't any better than chain-gang men, that's true," said
the brawny bearer of the axe, still quietly smoking; "it nor you
never were. There's where the whole boiling lot of you ought to be
still. You talk of ruining poor men," he continued, slightly shifting
his position, so as to face Scotty, "you darned fox! I know you-and
these men know you," pointing to the group of woodcutters. "Before
this new system came with this new agent, you and your rats there had
the whole trade in your hands. You bought from the cutters at your
own price, and you paid them in rum. You cheated the woodcutters and
swindled the dealers, till the wonder was that some day you weren't
found chopped to pieces for our villainy."</p>

<p>"That's true as Gospel," said one of the woodcutters who had
lately applauded Scotty. "You're an infernal set of vampires, you
are."</p>

<p>Scotty and his ill-looking crew realized that the woodcutter had
got the drop on them, dead sure."</p>

<p>A stamping and tramping in the outer room or store suggested new
arrivals, as the place was a kind of inn. All eyes were turned on the
door, where entered, one after another, about a dozen powerful
fellows, in the picturesque garb of stockriders, who noisily but
good-humouredly sat them down to the large central table, and called
for something to eat and drink.</p>

<p>The interrupted discussion was not resumed but a whispered and
earnest comment on the new-comers began among Scotty's gang.</p>

<p>"Where do you fellows hail from?" asked the big woodcutter, after
waiting a while, and in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>"From Dardanup," said one of the stockriders. The whispering
between Scotty and his friends ceased, the last word passed round
being strongly emphasized, "Dardanup Irish."</p>

<p>There was a colony of Irish settlers at Dardanup, free men, who
had emigrated there forty years before, when the Western colony was
free from the criminal taint. The families were all related to each
other by intermarriage; and the men of the whole settlement, who had
been born and reared in the bush, were famous throughout the colony
for strength, horsemanship, good-fellowship, and hard fighting
qualities.</p>

<p>"From Dardanup-eh?" said the big woodcutter, with a mischievous
smile at Scotty's group. Then you be Agent Sheridan's new teamsters,
maybe?"</p>

<p>"Ay, we're going to take those teams up to-morrow," said a strong
fellow; and then, to call the waiter, he hammered the table with his
enormous fist.</p>

<p>"Why," said the woodcutter, in his bland way, "it might be as
you're the Maguire boys from Dardanup?"</p>

<p>"Only eight Maguires in this crowd," said the table-hammerer, with
a pleasant look round the circle.</p>

<p>Scotty and one or two of his friends here gently left their seats,
and sauntered towards the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go," said the woodcutter pressingly; "don't be in a hurry,
Scotty, man; why, it isn't ten minutes ago since you wanted to chaw
up that d--d Sheridan and his teamsters."</p>

<p>Scotty scowled at the woodcutter. "A man can come and go as he
pleases, can't he?" he growled.</p>

<p>"O, ay; but don't leave the friends as you wanted to meet, just
now. Here, you Dardanup fellows, this is your ganger in the teams;
this is your 'boss,' as Yankee Sullivan says. This is the fellow that
says Agent Sheridan darsn't order him, and that the agent went down
on his knees and begged him to drive his black ox team."</p>

<p>"He'll never drive it again," said one of the Dardanup men.</p>

<p>"Why won't he?" demanded one of Scotty's friends.</p>

<p>"Because I'm going to drive that team," said the six-foot
Australian, wheeling his seat with an ominous velocity.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! ha, ha!" roared the big woodcutter, enjoying the fallen
crest of the braggart; "but you can't have that team Maguire; Scotty
will make ribbons of you."</p>

<p>And the man with the axe heavily stamped on the floor in his
boisterous enjoyment of Scotty's discomfiture.</p>

<p>The Dardanup man rose and walked toward Scotty, who sank back with
so sudden a dismay that he stumbled and fell headlong, while a
waiter, entering with a tray of plates and glasses, tumbled across
the prostrate bully.</p>

<p>At this there was a loud laugh, and the six-footer from Dardanup
sat down again. Scotty, too, was wise enough to profit by the
hilarity. He picked himself up, laughing with the rest.</p>

<p>"Come," he cried in a jolly tone, but with a humiliated aspect, as
if he feared his offer would be refused, "let us have a drink and
shake hands, no matter who has the teams."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the Dardanup men, who were just as ready to drink
as to fight.</p>

<p>The bottle was passed round, and every man drank with Scotty,
except the big woodcutter.</p>

<p>Scotty handed him the bottle and a glass, noticing that he had not
tasted.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the big man, with a shake of the head, "none
of that for me."</p>

<p>A few moments afterwards one of the Dardanup men held up his glass
to the big man of the axe. "Drink with me," he said.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad," said the woodcutter, "pass your bottle. I'll drink with
you all night."</p>

<p>Scotty pretended not to have noted nor heard; but as soon as he
could he escaped from the room with his associates. The Dardanup men
ate a mighty supper, and afterwards had a wild time, in which the
woodcutter was a partaker.</p>

<p>Powerful and hearty fellows, full of good-nature, but dangerous
men to rouse, these young Australians, and their strong blood was
excited by the new enterprise they had undertaken.</p>

<p>A combination had been made among the ticket-of-leave teamsters
and buyers against the new agent of the sandalwood trade, who had
revolutionized the old system. It had come to a serious pass with the
business, and Agent Sheridan, knowing that a weak front would invite
ruin, had resolved to test the opposition at once rather than wait
for its bursting.</p>

<p>He rode to Dardanup, and called a meeting of the stockriders, who,
though every one born in Australia and bred to the bush from infancy,
had a warm feeling for Sheridan, perhaps because of his Irish name.
He laid the case before them without hiding the danger.</p>

<p>The ticket-of-leave teamsters were resolved to destroy the
Sandalwood teams of the Company by rolling great rocks on them as
they passed through the Blackwood Gorge.</p>

<p>The Blackwood Gorge was the narrow bed of a stream that wound
among the Iron-stone Hills. In the rainy season it was filled with a
violent flood; but for six months of the year its bed was quite dry,
and was used as a road to reach the sandalwood districts. For more
than thirty miles the patient oxen followed this rugged bridle path;
and for the whole distance the way zigzagged between the feet of
precipices and steep mountains.</p>

<p>It would be an easy matter to block up or destroy a slow moving
train in such a gully. And that the discharged ticket-of-leave
teamsters had determined on this desperate revenge, the fullest proof
was in the hands of Agent Sheridan.</p>

<p>He had considered the matter well, and he was resolved on a plan
of action. He told the Dardanup bushmen that he wanted twenty-four
men, twelve to act as teamsters and twelve as a reserve. In a few
minutes he had booked the names and settled the conditions with two
dozen of the strongest and boldest men in West Australia.</p>

<p>The meeting in the tavern was the first intimation the
ticket-of-leave men had that their plan had been discovered.</p>

<p>Next morning the teams passed peacefully through the little town,
while the discomfited Scotty and his friends looked on from their
skulking-places, and never stirred a finger.</p>

<p>That evening, in the tavern, Scotty and his men were moodily
drinking, and at another table sat half-a-dozen Dardanup stockriders.
The woodcutter with the axe was smoking, as he lounged against the
fireplace.</p>

<p>Why didn't you Dardanup boys go alone, with the others? he asked
the stockriders.</p>

<p>Scotty and his ill-looking group turned their heads to hear the
reply.</p>

<p>"We staid behind to watch the wind!" answered one, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"To watch the wind?" queried the big woodcutter.</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Dardanup man, very slowly, and looking squarely at
the ticket-of-leave teamsters; "if the wind blows a stone as big as a
turtle's egg down the Blackwood Gorge to-morrow, we'll put a swinging
ornament on every one of those twenty gum trees on the square. The
rope is ready, and someone ought to pray for fine weather. Just one
stone," continued the giant, who had risen to light his pipe; and as
he passed he laid a heavy hand on Scotty's shoulder, as if by chance;
"just one stone, as big as a turtle's egg, and we begin to reeve that
rope."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! ho, ho!" roared the woodcutter, and the shanty shook with
his tremendous merriment. When his derision had exhausted itself, he
sat with the Dardanup men, and drank and sang in great hilarity over
the routing of Scotty's gang.</p>

<p>From that day, the new agent of the sandalwood trade was treated
with marked respect by all classes in West Australia.</p>

<h2>IN SEARCH OF HIS SORROW.</h2>

<p>NINE years crowded with successful enterprise had made Will
Sheridan a strong man in worldly wisdom and wealth. His healthy
influence had been felt and acknowledged all over the West Australian
colony. His direct attack on all obstacles never failed, whether the
barriers were mountains or men.</p>

<p>He had raised the sandalwood trade into cosmopolitan commerce. In
nine years he had made a national industry for the country in which
he lived; had grown rich himself, without selfishly seeking it; and,
in proportion, had made millionaires of the company that employed
him.</p>

<p>When men of large intelligence, foresight, and boldness break into
new fields, they may gather gold by the handful. So it was with this
energetic worker. His practical mind turned everything into account,
He inquired from the natives how they cured the beautiful soft
kangaroo skins they wore as bokas, and learned that the red gum, tons
of which could be gathered in a day, was the most powerful tan in the
world.</p>

<p>He at once shipped twenty tons of it to Liverpool as an
experiment. The next year he transported two hundred thousand pounds'
worth; and, five years from that time, Australian red gum was an
article of universal trade.</p>

<p>He saw a felled boolah-tree change in the rainy season into a
transparent substance like gum arabic; and, three years afterwards,
West Australia supplied nearly all the white gum in the markets of
civilization.</p>

<p>One might conclude that the man who could set his mind so
persistently at work in this energetic fashion must be thoroughly
engaged, and that his rapid success must have brought with it a rare
and solid satisfaction. Was it so with Agent Sheridan?</p>

<p>Darkest of all mysteries, O secret heart of man, that even to its
owner is unfathomed and occult! Here worked a brave man from year to
year, smiled on by men and women, transmuting all things to gold;
vigorous, keen, worldly, and gradually, becoming philosophic through
large estimation of values in men and things; yet beneath this
toiling and practical mind of the present was a heart that never for
one day, through all these years, ceased bleeding and grieving for a
dead joy of the past.</p>

<p>This was the bitter truth. When riding through the lonely and
beautiful bush, where everything was rich in colour, and all nature
was supremely peaceful, the sleepless underlying grief would seize on
this strong man's heart and gnaw it till he moaned aloud and waved
his arms, as if to put physically sway--from him the felon thought
that gripped so cruelly.</p>

<p>While working, there was no time to heed the pain--no opening for
the bitter thought to take shape. But it was there: always--it was
alive under the ice--moving in restless throbs and memories. It
stirred at strange faces, and sometimes it beat wofully at a familiar
sound.</p>

<p>No wonder that the man who carried such a heart should, sooner or
later, show sign of the hidden sorrow in his face. It was so with
Will Sheridan. His worldly work and fortune belonged only to the nine
years of his Australian life; but he knew that the life lying beyond
was that which gave him happiness or misery.</p>

<p>He became a grave man before his time; and one deep line in his
face, that to most people would have denoted his energy and intensity
of will, was truly graven by the unceasing presence of his
sorrow.</p>

<p>He had loved Alice Walmsley with that one love which thorough
natures only know. It had grown into his young life as firmly as an
organic part of his being. When it was torn from him, there was left
a gaping and bleeding wound. And time bad brought him no cure.</p>

<p>In the early days of his Australian career he had received the
news of his father's death. His mother and sister had been well provided
for. They implored him to come home but he could not bear to hear of the
one being whose memory filled his existence; and so he never wrote to
his people. Their letters ceased; and in nearly nine years he had
never heard a word from home.</p>

<p>But now, when his present life was to outward appearance all
sunshine, and when his future path lay through pleasant ways, the
bitter thought in his heart rankled with unutterable suffering.
Neither work nor excitement allayed the pang. He shrank from
solitude, and he was solitary in crowds. He feared to give rein to
grief; yet alone, in the moonlit bush, he often raised his face and
hands to heaven, and cried aloud in his grievous pain.</p>

<p>At last the thought came that he must look his misery in the
face--that he must put an end to all uncertainty. Answering the
unceasing yearning in his breast, he came to a decision.</p>

<p>"I must go home," he said aloud one day, when riding alone in the
forest, "I must go home--if only for one day."</p>

<h2>THE DOOR OF THE CELL.</h2>

<p>IT was winter again. A sunburnt, foreign-looking man stood on the
poop deck of a steamer ploughing with decreased speed past the docks
in the long line of Liverpool shipping. The man was young, but, with
deep marks of care and experience on his face, looked nearly ten
years older than he really was. From the face, it was hard to know
what was passing in the heart; but that no common emotion was there
might be guessed by the rapid stride and the impatient glance from
the steamer's progress to the shore.</p>

<p>It was Will Sheridan; but not the determined, thoughtful Agent
Sheridan of the Australian sandalwood trade. There was no quietness
in his soul now; there was no power of thought in his brain; there
was nothing there but a burning fever of longing to put his foot on
shore, and then to turn his face to the one spot that had such power
to draw him from the other side of the world.</p>

<p>As soon as the steamer was moored, heedless of the Babel of voices
around him, the stranger passed through the crowd, and entered the
streets of Liverpool. But he did not know the joy of an exile
returning after a weary absence. He did not feel that he was once
more near to those who loved him. It was rather to him as if he
neared their graves.</p>

<p>The great city in which be walked was as empty to him as the great
ocean he had just left. Unobservant and unsympathetic, looking
straight before him, and seeing with the soul's vision the little
coast village of his boyhood, he made his way to the railway station,
bought a ticket for home, and took his place in the car.</p>

<p>At first, the noise and rush of the train through the cold evening
of a winter day, was a relief to the restless traveller. The activity
fell upon his morbid heart like a cold hand on a feverish forehead.
But, as the sun sank, and the cheerless grey twilight crept round
him, the people who had travelled from the city were dropped at the
quiet country stations, and sped away to their happy homes.</p>

<p>A man came and lighted a lamp in the carriage, and all the outer
world grew suddenly dark. The traveller was alone now; and, as the
names of the wayside stations grew more familiar, a stillness fell
upon him, against which he made no struggle.</p>

<p>At last, as once more the train moved to a station, he arose,
walked slowly to the door, and stepped on the platform. He was at the
end of his journey--he was at home.</p>

<p>At home! He passed through the little station-house, where the old
porter stared at his strange face and strange clothes, and wondered
why he did not ask the way to the village. On he strode in the
moonlight, glancing at familiar things with every step; for ten years
had brought little change to the quiet place. There were the lone
trees by the roadside, and the turnpike, and down in the hollow he
saw the moon's face reflected through the ice in the mill-pond; and
seeing this, he stopped and looked, but not with the outward eye, and
he saw the merry skaters, and Alice's head was on his shoulder, and
her dear voice in his ear, and all the happy love of his boyhood
flooded his heart, as he bowed his face in his hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>Down the main street of the village he walked, glancing at the
bright windows of the cottage homes, that looked like smiles on
well-known faces. He passed the post office, the church, and the inn;
and a few steps more brought him to the corner of his own little
street.</p>

<p>The windows of the Draper's house were lighted, as if for a feast
or merry-making within; but he passed on rapidly, and stopped before
the garden gate of the widow's cottage. There, all was dark and
silent. He glanced through the trees at his own old home, which lay
beyond, and saw a light from the kitchen, and the moonlight shining
on the window of his own room.</p>

<p>But here, where he longed for a light, there was no light. He laid
his hand on the gate, and it swung open before him, for the latch was
gone. He passed through, and saw that the garden path was rank with
frozen weeds, and the garden was itself a wilderness. He walked on
and stood in the porch, and found a bank of snow against the bottom
of the cottage door, which the wind had whirled in there, perhaps a
week before.</p>

<p>He stood in the cheerless place for a moment, looking into his
heart, that was as empty as the cottage porch, and as cold; and then
he turned and walked down the straight path, with almost the same
feeling that had crushed him so cruelly eleven years before.</p>

<p>He passed on to his own home, which had been shut out from his
heart by the cloud that covered his way; and a feeling of reproach
came upon him, for his long neglect of those who loved him. Those who
loved him! There was something warming in his heart, and rising
against the numbness that had stilled it in the cottage porch. He
stood before the door of his old home, and raised his hand and
knocked twice.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a strange face to William Sheridan met his
look. Choking back a something in his throat, he said, with an
effort--</p>

<p>"Is this Mrs. Sheridan's house?"</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Sheridan's house? Sir!" answered the man; "but it is
my house now. Mrs. Sheridan is dead."</p>

<p>Another cord snapped, and the stranger in his own place turned
from the door with a moan in his heart.</p>

<p>As he turned, a young woman came from within to the porch; and the
man, with a sudden exclamation, stepped after him, and placing his
hand on his shoulder, said earnestly,</p>

<p>"Be this William Sheridan that we thought were dead?" and, looking
in his face and recognizing him, he muttered "Poor lad! poor lad!
dont'ee know thy old schoolmate, Tom Bates, and thy own sister
Mary?"</p>

<p>Taking him by the arm, the kind fellow led Sheridan to the door,
and said--</p>

<p>"Wife, here be thy brother Will, safe and sound, and not drowned,
as Sam Draper told us he were--and d--n that same Draper for all his
evil doin's!"</p>

<p>Then William Sheridan felt his kind sister's arms on his neck, and
the associations of his youth thronged up like old friends to meet
him, and with them came the sweet spirit of his boy's love for Alice.
They came to his heart like stormers, to a city's gate, and, seeing
the breach, they entered in, and took possession. For the second time
that night, the strong man bowed his head and sobbed--not for a
moment as before, but long and bitterly, for the suppressed feelings
were finding a vent at last; the bitterness of his sorrow, so long
and closely shut in, was flowing freely.</p>

<p>Brother and sister were alone during this scene; but after a
while, Mary's kind-hearted husband entered, a rugged but
tender-hearted Lancashire farmer; and knowing that much was to be
said to Will, and that this was the best time to say it, he began at
once; but he knew, and Will Sheridan knew, that he began at the
farthest point he could from what he would have to say before the
end. Will Sheridan's face was turned in the shadow, where neither his
sister nor her husband could see it,--and so he listened to the
story.</p>

<p>"Will," said his brother-in-law, "tha knows 'tis moren ten years
since thou went to sea, and that great changes have come to thee
since then; and tha knows, lad, thou must expect that changes as
great have come to this village. Thy father took sick about a year
after thou went, and grieved that he died, hear from thee. Samuel
Draper wrote to his people that thou'd turned out a bad lad in
foreign countries, and had to ran away from the ship; and when that
news came, it made th' old people sorrowful. Thy father took to his
bed in first o' th' winter, and was dead in a few months. Thy mother
followed soon, and her last words were a blessing for thee if thou
were living. Then Samuel Draper came back from sea, looking fine in
his blue uniform; and he said he'd heard thou'd been drowned on a
voyage from China. He went to sea again, six months after, and he's
never been here since; and 'tis unlikely," Mary's husband said very
slowly, "that he ever will come to this village any more."</p>

<p>Tom Bates ceased speaking, as if all were told, and stared
straight at the fire; his wife, Mary, who was sitting on a low seat
near him, drew closer, and laid her cheek against his side, weeping
silently; and he put his big hand around her head and caressed
it.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan sat motionless for about a minute, and then said, in
a hard monotone--</p>

<p>"What became of Alice Walmsley? Did she--Is she dead also?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not dead," said his brother-in-law, "but worse than that.
Alice Walmsley is in prison."</p>

<p>Will Sheridan raised his head at the word, repeating it to himself
in blank amazement and dread. Then he stood up, and faced round to
the two people who sat before him, his sister hiding her weeping face
against her husband's side, the husband patting her head in a
bewildered way, and both looking as if they were the guilty parties
who should be in prison instead of Alice.</p>

<p>Had they said that she was dead, or even that she was married, he
could have faced the news manfully, for he had prepared his heart for
it; but now, when he had come home and thought he could bear all, he
found that his years of struggle to forget had been in vain, and that
a gulf yawned at his feet deeper and wider than that he had striven
so long to fill up.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, man, tell me what you mean! Why is Alice
Walmsley in prison?"</p>

<p>Poor Tom Bates still stared at the fire, and patted his wife's
head; but a moment after Sheridan asked the question, he let his hand
close quietly round the brown hair, and raising his eyes to Will's
face, said, "yes" in a low voice--</p>

<p>"For murder. For killing her child!"</p>

<p>Will Sheridan looked at him with a pitiful face, and uttered a
sound like the baffled cry of a suffering animal that finds the last
door of escape shut against it.</p>

<p>His brother-in-law knew that now was the time to tell Will all,
while his very soul was numbed by the strength of the first blow.</p>

<p>"They were married in the church, as you know," said Mary's
husband, "and they lived together for some time, seeming very
happy--though Mary and I said, when it was all over, that from the
very clay of the wedding there was a shadow on Alice's face, and that
she was never seen to smile. Draper was a captain, and his ship was
going to India, and Alice wanted very bad to go with him. But he
refused her at last so roughly, before her mother, that poor little
Alice said no more. Five months after his going, her child was born,
and for six months the poor ailing thing looked like her old self,
all smiles, and kindness, and love for the little one. Then, one day,
there walked into her house a strange woman, who said that she was
Samuel Draper's wife. No one knows what passed between them--they two
were alone; but the woman showed the papers that proved what she
said. She was a desperate woman, and, with no one else in the house,
she was like to kill poor Alice with her dreadful words. Alice's
heart was changed to stone from that minute. The woman left the
village that day, and never was seen here again. But that night the
little child was found dead beside the mother, with marks of violence
on it. Poor lass! she was charged wi' killing it--she made no
defence; she never raised her head nor said a word. She might have
told how the thing happened, for we knew--Mary and I knew--that Alice
never did that. But she couldn't speak in her own defence--all she
wanted was to get out of sight and hide her poor head. Poor little
Allie--poor little Allie! She never raised her hand to hurt her
child. It was accident, or it was someone else; but she couldn't or
wouldn't speak. She was sent to prison, and her mother died from the
blow. God help the poor lass to-night! God help poor little Allie!"
And the warm heart overflowed, and husband and wife mingled their
tears for the lost one.</p>

<p>"And this was Samuel Draper's work?" asked Sheridan, slowly.</p>

<p>"Ay, damn him for a scoundrel!" said the strong yeoman, starting
to his feet, and clenching his fist, the tears on his cheeks, and his
voice all broken with emotion. "He may keep away from this village,
where the people know him; but there's no rest for him on this
earth--no rest for such as he. Mother and child curse him--one from
the grave, the other from the prison; and sea or land cannot shut
them out from his black heart. Her father was a seaman, too, and
he'll sail wi' him until the villain pays the debt to the last
farthing. And Allie's white face will haunt him, even in sleep, with
her dead child in her arms. Oh, God help poor Alice to-night. God
comfort the poor little lassie!"</p>

<p>William Sheridan said no more that night. His sister prepared his
own old room for him, and he went to it; but not to sleep. Up and
down he walked like a caged animal, moaning now and again, without
following the meaning of the words--</p>

<p>"Why did I come here? O, why did I come here?"</p>

<p>He felt that he could not bear this agony much longer that he must
think, and that he must pray. But he could do neither. There was one
picture in his mind, in his eye, in his heart--a crouching figure in
a dock, with a brown head sunk on her white hands--and were he to try
to get one more thought into his brain, it would burst and drive him
mad.</p>

<p>And how could he pray--how could he kneel, while the miscreant
walked the earth who had done all this? But from this hateful thought
he reverted with fresh agony to her blighted heart. Where was she
that night? How could he find her and help her? If he could only pray
for her, it would keep him from delirium until he saw her.</p>

<p>And he sank on his knees by the bed where he had knelt by his
mother's side and learned to pray; and again the old associations
came thronging to his heart, and softened it. The sweet face of his
boy's love drew to him slowly from the mist of years; and gradually
forgetting self, and remembering only her great sorrow, he raised up
his face in piteous supplication, acknowledging his utter dependence
on divine strength, and prayed as he had never prayed before. Such
prayers are never offered in vain. A wondrous quiet came to the
troubled heart, and remained with it.</p>

<p>When he arose from his knees, he looked upon every familiar object
around him with awakened interest, and many things that he had
forgotten came back to his memory and affection when he saw them
there. Before he lay down to rest, for he felt that he must sleep, he
looked through the window at the deserted cottage, and had strength
to think of its former inmates.</p>

<p>"God give her peace, and in some way enable me to bring comfort to
her," he said. And when he arose in the morning this thought was
uppermost in his mind--that he must search for means to bear comfort
to the afflicted heart of Alice Walmsley.</p>

<p>From his sister and her husband he learned that Alice was confined
in Millbank Prison in London, and he made up his mind to go to London
that day. They, seeing that he was determined on his course, made no
effort to oppose him. He asked them not to mention his visit to
anyone in the village for he did not wish to be recognized; and so he
turned from the kind-hearted couple, and walked towards the railway
station.</p>

<p>Sheridan now remembered that he had brought from West Australia
some letters of introduction, and also some official dispatches; and
he thought it might be a fortunate circumstance that most of the
official letters were addressed to the Colonial Office and the Board
of Directors of Convict Prisons.</p>

<p>In the penal colony of West Australia, where there are few free
settlers, and an enormous criminal population, a man of Sheridan's
standing and influence was rarely found--and the Government of the
colony was desirous of introducing him to the Home Government,
knowing that his opinions would be treated with great consideration.
He began to think that these letters might be the means he sought
for, and he made up his mind to deliver them at once.</p>

<h2>MILLBANK.</h2>

<p>ARRIVED in London, he proceeded at once to the Colonial Office,
and left his letters for the Secretary, and with them his address in
the metropolis. He went through the same routine with the dispatches
for the Prison Directors. Then, though his heart craved instant
action, he was forced to exercise his patience, to wait until these
high and perhaps heedless officials were pleased to recognize his
presence.</p>

<p>The great city was a wonder to him; but, in his intense
preoccupation, he passed through it as if it had been familiar from
childhood. On the day after his arrival, not expecting an answer from
the officials, one of whom--the Colonial Secretary--was a cabinet
minister, he tried to interest himself in the myriad strangeness of
London. He visited Westminster Abbey and the British Museum. But,
everywhere, his heart beat the same dolorous key; he saw the white
face, the slight, crouching figure in the dock, the brown hair bowed
in agony and disgrace. On the walls of the great picture gallery the
gilded frames held only this pitiful scene. Among the tombs of the
kings in Westminster, he thought of her ruined life and shattered
hopes, and envied, for her sake, the peace of the sleeping marble
knights and ladies.</p>

<p>All day, without rest or food, he wandered aimlessly and
wretchedly through the sculptured magnificence of the galleries. When
the night closed, he found himself--almost unconscious of how he had
come to the place, or who had directed him thither--walking with
bared and feverish brow beneath a high and gloomy wall--the massive
outer guard of Millbank Prison. Hour sped after hour, yet round and
round the shadowy, silent precipice of wall the afflicted heart
wandered with tireless feet. It was woeful to think how near she was,
and to touch the sullen granite--yet it was a thousand times more
endurable than the torture and fear that were born of absence.</p>

<p>Surely, if there be any remote truth in the theory of psychic
magnetism, the afflicted soul within those walls must have felt the
presence of the loving and suffering heart without, which sent forth
unceasingly silent cries of sympathy and comfort. Surely, if
communion of living spirits be possible, the dream of the lonely
prisoner within must have thrilled with tenderness when his fevered
lips were pressed as lovingly to the icy stone of the prison wall as
once they were pressed to her forehead in affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>Back to his hotel, when morning was beginning to break, the lonely
watcher went, spiritless and almost despairing. The reaction had
begun of his extreme excitement for the past four days. He passed
along the lonesome river, that hurried through the city like a thief
in the night, flashing under the yellow quay-lights, then diving
suddenly beneath dark arches or among slimy keels, like a hunted
murderer escaping to the sea. Wild and incoherent fancies flashed
through Will's feverish mind. Again and again he was forced to steady
himself by placing his hand on the parapet, or he should have fallen
in the street, like a drunken man.</p>

<p>At last he reached his hotel, and flung himself on his bed,
prayerless, friendless, and only saved from despair by the thought of
an affliction that was deeper than his, which he, as a man and a
faithful friend, should be strong to relieve and comfort.</p>

<p>It was past noon when he awoke. The fever had passed and much of
the dejection. While dressing, he was surprised to find his mind
actively at work forming plans and surmises: for the day's
enterprise.</p>

<p>At breakfast, a large official letter was brought him. It was; a
brief but unofficially-cordial message from the Colonial Secretary,
Lord George Somers, appointing an hour--two o'clock on that day--when
he should be happy to receive Mr. Sheridan at the Colonial
Office.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances, such an appointment would have thrown
off his balance a man so unused to social or formal, ways as this
stranger from Australia, whose only previous training had been on a
merchant ship. But now, Will Sheridan prepared for the visit, without
thinking of its details. His mind was fastened on a point beyond this
meeting.</p>

<p>Even the formal solemnity of the powdered servant who received him
had no disturbing effect. Will Sheridan quite forgot the
surroundings, and at length, when ushered into the presence of the
Colonial Secretary, his native dignity and intelligence were in full
sway, and the impression he made on the observant nobleman was
instantaneous and deep.</p>

<p>He was received with more than courtesy. Those letters, Lord
Somers said, from Australia, had filled him with interest and desire
to see a man who bad achieved so much and who had so rapidly and
solidly enriched and benefited the colony.</p>

<p>The Colonial Secretary was a young man for his high
position--certainly not over forty, while he might be still younger.
He had a keen eye, a mobile face, that could turn to stony rigidity,
but withal a genial and even frank countenance when conversing
cordially with this stranger, whom he knew to be influential, and who
certainly was highly entertaining.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan was soon talking fluently and well. He knew all
about the penal colony, the working of the old penal system and the
need of a new one, the value of land, the resources of the country,
the capabilities for commerce and all this the Secretary was most
anxious to learn.</p>

<p>After a long interview, Sheridan rose to take leave, and the
Secretary said he hoped to see a great deal of him before his return
to Australia, and told him plainly that the opinions of a settler of
wealth and intelligence on colonial matters in West Australia were
just then of special importance to the Government. He also wished it
were in his power to give Mr. Sheridan pleasure while he remained in
England.</p>

<p>There was only one thought in Sheridan's mind all this time, and
now was the moment to let it work. He said he desired very much to
visit the convict prisons in England, and compare the home system
with that of the penal colony.</p>

<p>The minister was gratified by the request, and, smiling, asked
which prison he would visit first. Will mentioned Millbank; and the
minister With his own hand wrote a few lines to the governor, and
handed the paper to his visitor.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan took his departure, with a tremulous hope at his
heart, and drove straight to Millbank Prison.</p>

<p>There is something strange, almost unaccountable, and yet
terrible, in the change that appears, in half a century, in the
building of prisons. Few people have thought of this perhaps; but it
contains a suggestion of a hardening of hearts and a lessening of
sentiment. The old prisons were dark and horrible, even in aspect;
while the new ones are light and airy. In the latter, the bar takes
the place of a wall--and the box is often ornamented with cast-iron
flowers and other slightly but sardonic mockery. Better the old
dungeon, with its gloom; better for the sake of humanity. The new
prison is a cage--a hideous hive of order and commonplace severity,
where the flooding sunlight is a derision, and the barred door only a
securer means of confinement. For the sake of sentiment, at least,
let us have the dismal old keep, that proclaims its mission on its
dreadful brow, rather than the grinning bar-gate that covers its
teeth-like mils with vulgar metal efflorescence.</p>

<p>The great penitentiary of Millbank, is, or rather was, an old
fashioned prison, its vast arched gateway sombre and awful as a tomb.
It has disappeared now, having been pulled down in 1875; but those
who visited it once, or who even passed it will never forget the
oppression caused by its grated and frowning portal. In the early
part of this century, the Government of Great Britain determined to
build an immense penitentiary, on the plan laid down by Jeremy
Bentham in his celebrated "Panopticon, or the Inspection House."</p>

<p>Bentham's scheme proposed colossal prison, which should contain
all England's convicts, and dispense entirely with transportation.
The Government, acting on his plan, purchased a large and unhealthy
tract of flat land, lying beside the Thames, and on this the unique
structure was raised. The workmen were ten years in completing it;
but, when it was finished, Englishmen said that it was the model
prison of the world.</p>

<p>And it certainly was a great improvement on the older prisons,
where those confined were often herded, many in a room, like
cattle--the innocent with the guilty, the young and pure with the
aged and the foul. In Millbank every prisoner had his or her own
cell--a room of stone (walls, ceiling, and floor), with a large and
heavily-barred window. Each cell was eight feet square. The prison
was built in six vast pentagons, radiating from a central hexagon,
from which every cell was visible.</p>

<p>The entrance to the prison, from the street, was a wonder of
architectural gloom. First there was a dark archway of solid masonry,
from the roof of which, about six feet from the portal, sprang a
heavy grate or portcullis, with spear-points apparently--ready to
fall and cut the unfortunate off for ever from the world. Far within
the arch appeared a mighty iron gate, ponderously barred, with an
iron wicket, through which an armed warder could be seen on sentry
within the yard.</p>

<p>These details were not noticed by Will Sheridan as he entered the
echoing archway; but he was chilled. Nevertheless, by the cold shadow
of the surroundings. The warder within came to the wicket, and took
the letter, leaving Will outside. In a few minutes he found that his
introduction was an "open sesame." The governor of Millbank himself,
an important gentleman in a black uniform with heavy gold facings,
came speedily to the wicket, the ponderous bars were flung back, the
awful door rolled aside, and Will Sheridan entered.</p>

<p>The governor was very gracious to his distinguished visitor. On
learning of his desire to see the arrangements of the prison, he
himself became the guide.</p>

<p>An hour was spent in the male side of the establishment, which was
an age to Will Sheridan. While the governor thought his attention was
engaged in observing the features or motions of some caged
malefactor, the mind and fancy of the visitor were far or otherwise
engaged. He did not see the wretched, crime-stained countenances in
the cells he passed; but in every one he saw the white face, the
brown hair, and the crouching figure that filled his mind.</p>

<p>At last the governor asked him to visit the female prison, in
which the discipline was necessarily different. They passed through a
long passage built in the wall, and entered the corridors of the
female prison.</p>

<p>Sheridan's heart beat, and the blood fled from his face, leaving
him ghastly pale, as he passed the first iron door. He feared that
the governor might notice his agitation; and he wondered how he
should learn whether Alice were there or not.</p>

<p>As he walked down the corridor he noticed that on every door was
hung a white card, and, approaching, he read the name, crime, and
sentence of the prisoner printed thereon. This was a relief to him.
As he walked he read the name on every card, and on and on they went,
up stairs and down, and round and round the pentagons, until he
thought she surely was not in the prison, and the governor concluded
that his visitor evidently meant to see all that was to be seen.</p>

<p>When the last corridor on the ground floor was entered, Will read
every name on the doors with a despairing persistence, and his heart
sank within him as he came to the last.</p>

<p>The governor opened the door at the end of the passage, and they
entered a light, short corridor, with large and pleasantly lighted
cells. Here, the governor said, were confined those prisoners who, by
extreme good conduct, had merited less severe treatment than the
others.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan's heart leaped within him, for he knew that this was
the place where he should see her.</p>

<p>On the doors were simply printed the names and sentences of the
occupants; and at the fourth door Will stopped and read the
card.--ALICE WALMSLEY.</p>

<h2>LIFE.</h2>

<p>Seeing him pause and intently examine the card, the governor
beckoned to the female warder, who was in the passage, to come and
open the door.</p>

<p>The woman approached, the key in her hand, and stood aside until
the gentlemen withdrew from the door. Will turned and read her
intention, and with a shudder he put her back with his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no--not her," he said hurriedly. Then recollecting himself
"No, no; the prisoners do not like to be stared at."</p>

<p>Next moment, before he could think of the consequences, he turned
again, and, speaking rapidly, said--</p>

<p>"I am wrong. I should like to see the interior of this cell."</p>

<p>The lock clicked back, the heavy iron door swung open, and William
Sheridan saw Alice Walmsley before him.</p>

<p>She had been sewing on something coarse and white, and a heap of
the articles lay at her feet. As the door opened, she stood up from
the low seat on which she had sat in the centre of the stone-floored
cell, and, with her eyes on the ground, awaited the scrutiny of the
visitors, according to prison discipline.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan took in the whole cell at once, although his eyes
only rested on her face. She never looked on him, but stood in
perfect calmness, with her eyes cast down.</p>

<p>She was greatly changed, but so differently changed to Will's
expectations, that he stood amazed, stunned. He had pictured her
fragile, broken, spiritless, wretched. There she stood before him,
grown stronger than when he had known her, quiet as a statue, with a
face--not of happiness, but of intensified peace, and with all that
was beautiful in her as a girl increased a thousand fold, but subdued
by suffering. Her rich brown hair had formerly been cut close, but
now it had grown so long that it fell to her shoulders. Her face was
colourless, for want of open air and sunshine. A casual observer
would have said she was happy.</p>

<p>Something of her peace fell upon William Sheridan as he looked
upon her. Suddenly he was recalled to consciousness by a simple
movement of hers, as if averse to inspection. His heart quickened
with fear and: sorrow for his impulsive action in entering the cell,
for now he would give all he possessed that she should not look upon
his face. He turned from her quickly and walked out of the cell, and
he did not look round until he heard the heavy door swing into its
place.</p>

<p>When he had walked so far from the cell that she could not hear
his voice, he asked the governor what work these privileged prisoners
were engaged in, and was almost startled into an exclamation of
astonishment when the governor answered:</p>

<p>"They are just now engaged on a pleasant task for themselves. They
are making their outfit for the penal colony."</p>

<p>"Is she--is that prisoner going to the penal colony?" asked Will
Sheridan, scarcely able to control his emotion.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she and all those in this pentagon will sail for West
Australia in the next convict ship," said the governor.</p>

<p>"We shall send three hundred men and fifty Women in this lot."</p>

<p>"When does the ship sail?" asked the visitor, still apparently
examining the door-cards.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of April--just three months hence," answered the
governor.</p>

<p>With his eyes fixed on a ponderous door, which he did not see,
Will Sheridan made a sudden and imperative resolution.</p>

<p>"I shall return to Australia on that convict ship," were the words
that no one heard but his own soul.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Sir, for your courtesy and attention," he said, next
moment, to the governor; "and as I wish to examine more closely the
working of your system, I shall probably trouble you again."</p>

<p>The governor assured him that his visits to the prison would be at
all times considered as complimentary; and Will Sheridan walked from
Millbank with a firmer step and a more restful spirit than he had
known for ten years.</p>

<h2>SIR JOSHUA HOBB'S CONVICT MILL</h2>

<p>LORD SOMERS, the Colonial Secretary, had evidently conceived a
high opinion of Mr. Sheridan from his first brief visit. He soon
renewed the acquaintance by requesting another interview. In the
course of a few weeks their relations had become almost friendly.</p>

<p>Their conversation was usually about the Australian colonies, on
which subject the Secretary found Sheridan to be a perfect
encyclopedia. It seemed that every possibility of their condition,
latent as well as operative, had come into his practical mind, and
had been keenly considered and laid aside.</p>

<p>But Sheridan was a child in London. He was supremely ignorant of
everything that this nobleman considered necessary to existence. He
knew nothing of British or European politics--did not even know who
was Prime Minister. It gratified the genial and intelligent
Englishman, on their frequent rides through the city, to impart
information and pleasure to his Australian friend.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Sheridan received another large official letter this
time from the Chief Director of Convict Prisons, Sir Joshua Hobb,
who, without apologizing for the delayed acknowledgment of Mr.
Sheridan's letter, asked him to meet the Board of Directors on the
next day at noon, at the Department in Parliament-street.</p>

<p>Sheridan kept the appointment, and became acquainted with the
half-dozen men to whose hands Great Britain had intrusted the vast
burden of punishing and reforming the criminal class.</p>

<p>Half an hour's conversation, though of a general nature,
astonished Will Sheridan, by convincing him of the stupendous conceit
and incompetence of these men. They talked glibly about the weight of
a prisoner's loaf, and the best hour to light the cells in the
morning; they had statistics at their finger-ends to show how much
work a convict could perform on a given number of ounces of meat; but
they knew nothing whatever of the large philosophy of penal
government.</p>

<p>The Chief Director, Sir Joshua Hobb, however, was an exception, in
so far as he had ideas. He was a tall, gaunt man, of fifty, with an
offensive hauteur, which was obviously from habit rather than from
nature. His face said plainly: "I know all--these gentlemen know
nothing--it is not necessary that they should--I am the Convict
System." He reminded Sheridan of a country pedagogue promoted to high
position for some narrow piece of special knowledge. He looked
superciliously at Sheridan, as if to ask--"Do you mean to pretend,
before me, that you know anything about prisons?"</p>

<p>"Confound this fellow!" said Sheridan to himself, five minutes
after meeting him; "he deliberately delayed acknowledging my letters,
to show his importance."</p>

<p>But Sir Joshua Hobb was an "expert" in penal systems. He had
graduated from a police court, where he had begun as an attorney; and
he was intimately acquainted with the criminal life of England in its
details. But he had no soul for the awful thought of whence the dark
stream came, nor whither it was going. He was merely a dried mudbank
to keep it within bounds for a little way.</p>

<p>The admiration of his colleagues was almost reverential. Mr.
Sheridan was informed by several of the Board--in subdued voice, of
course, so that the great reformer should not be put to the blush--of
his wonderful successes in the treatment of criminals.</p>

<p>"They all hate him," said Mr. Pettegrew, one of the Board.</p>

<p>"I give you my word, Sir, that every criminal in England hates the
name of Sir Joshua Hobb. He has made them feel his power, Sir, and
they know him."</p>

<p>"He was knighted by the Queen for his Separate System," said
another Director.</p>

<p>"Is that your present system?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"No," said the Director. "At present we are on the other
tack."</p>

<p>"The Separate System was a failure, then I presume?" inquired Mr.
Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Not a failure, Sir, but it was abandoned out of regard to the
sentimental reformers. It increased insanity from 12 to 31 per 1,000.
Sir Joshua himself was the first to find it out."</p>

<p>"And then you adopted the Public Works System, did you not?" asked
Sheridan.</p>

<p>"No, not so soon. When his Separate System failed, Sir Joshua
introduced the mask--a cloth skull-cap coming down over the face,
with eyelet holes--to promote a salutary shame in the prisoners. He
was made a Knight Commander of the Bath for that wonderful
invention."</p>

<p>"Then that system gave beneficial results?" inquired Mr.
Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Well, there was no doubt of its moral excellence; but it
increased the insanity from 31 to 391 per 1,000. Sir Joshua himself
was the first to discover this also."</p>

<p>"He certainly deserves the name of a discoverer," thought
Sheridan. Then, aloud--</p>

<p>"And your present system is his invention, also?"</p>

<p>"Yes, our present system is wholly his. We are just now examining
results. We discover one peculiarity, which Sir Joshua hardly knows
how to class; but he says it certainly is a proof of progress."</p>

<p>"May I ask what is this peculiarity?" inquired Mr. Sheridan.</p>

<p>"That within three years insanity has decreased 2 per cent,"
answered the Director, "while suicide has increased 17 per 1000."</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua inclines to the opinion," said another Director, who
was listening, "that this fact proves that we are at last getting to
bear closely on the criminal principle. The law is touching it--there
is no escape--and in despair the baffled criminals give up the fight,
and kill themselves."</p>

<p>There was something fearfully repugnant to Sheridan's broad and
humane view in all this, and he would gladly have escaped from the
place. But the Directors meant to impress him with their ability to
manage the entire Penal System, both in Australia and England. To
secure this general management, Sir Joshua Hobb had recently
introduced a bill to Parliament.</p>

<p>"Have you heard, Sir," said Sir Joshua, addressing Sheridan with a
patronizing kindness, "of the proposals made to the Government as to
penal reform, by Mr. Wyville, of West Australia?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Sheridan, smiling at his own ignorance. "I have
never even heard of Mr. Wyville."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Sir Joshua, with a stare of rude surprise.</p>

<p>He is the most influential man in the West Australian penal
colony."</p>

<p>"I never heard his name before," simply answered Will.</p>

<p>"He, perhaps, resides in a district far from yours, Mr. Sheridan,"
said one of the Directors. Mr. Wyville is a wealthy settler from the
Vasse District."</p>

<p>"From the Vasse!" repeated Sheridan, quite surprised; "I thought I
knew every man, rich and poor, bond and free, in that district. I
have lived there many years."</p>

<p>Sheridan saw that his importance was lessened to the Board, but,
strange to say, increased to the Chief Director, by his confession of
ignorance of Mr. Wyville. However, Sir Joshua continued to speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville wants to introduce the sentimental idea into our
penal system--an absurdity that has never been attempted. There is
only one-way to blend: punishment with reform, sir--by rigid rules,
constant work, low diet, impersonal treatment; and all this kept up
with unflagging regularity for all the years of a prisoner's
sentence."</p>

<p>"With educational and religious influences added, of course,"
suggested Mr. Sheridan.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, not of course," said Sir Joshua, in a tone of severe
correction; "a chapter of the Bible read by a warder every morning,
in a regular way, may do some good; but these influences have been
overrated--they, are of the sentimental School. The quality that is
absent in the criminal class is order, Sir, order; and this can best
be supplied by persistent and impersonal regularity of work, meals,
exercise, and sleep."</p>

<p>"You subject all prisoners to the same course of treatment?" asked
Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Precisely," answered Sir Joshua. "Our system is the measure of
normality, Sir. We make the entire criminal or, abnormal class pass
through the same process of elevation, and try to reach one
standard."</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan would have asked what the standard was, and how many
had reached it, and what had become of those who had failed to reach
it, who had sunk under the Draconian yoke; but he thought it prudent
to keep the questions back.</p>

<p>"Suppose a youth commit a first offence," he said, "or an hitherto
respectable and industrious commit a crime in a moment of
passion--will you treat him as if he were a professional
criminal?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," repeated the eminent reformer; "our system regards
criminality as a mass, and ignores its grades. This is our leading
idea, sir--uniformity and justice. The criminal body is diseased--our
system is the cure, sir; physician and cure in one."</p>

<p>Accustomed to say the word he meant, Will Sheridan could hardly
restrain an indignant comment. "Confound the man," he thought, "he
would take a hundred men, with as many diseases, and treat them all
for the cholera." He concluded that Sir Joshua would have earned
distinction as a torturer as well as a reformer, but he did not say
so. As soon as possible he ended the conversation, and withdrew from
the presence of the Directors of Prisons.</p>

<p>"Lord help the convicts!" he thought, on his way to the hotel. "No
wonder they are eager to be sent to the penal colony."</p>

<h2>MR. WYVILLE</h2>

<p>AT the hotel, Sheridan found a note from Lord Somers requesting
him, if disengaged, to call upon him that afternoon. Half an hour
later, he and the Colonial Secretary were riding together towards the
West End.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Sheridan," said Lord Somers, "there is a
gentleman in London I want you to meet, who knows a great deal about
the Australian colonies, and especially about the West. He is our
chief adviser on the proposed reform of the Penal System."</p>

<p>Indeed said Sheridan, interested at once. This is the second time
to-day, I surmise, that I have heard of him. Is his name
Wyville?"</p>

<p>"Yes; do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Sheridan; "I have never heard of him. Sir Joshua
Hobb does not like his reformatory ideas--which inclines me to think
Mr. Wyville must be a superior man."</p>

<p>Lord Somers laughed. "Sir Joshua Hobb is, indeed, a strong
counterblast," he said; "by nature, two such men are compelled to be
antagonistic to each other."</p>

<p>"You admire Mr. Wyville, my Lord?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Thoroughly," answered Lord Somers. "He is a most remarkable
man--a man of exalted principles and extraordinary power. His
information is astonishing--and what he speaks about, he knows
absolutely. I fancy he has lived a long time in the colonies, for he
is enormously wealthy."</p>

<p>"Is he an old man?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think he can be forty--certainly not more but a
person of so much force, and with a manner so impressive, that really
one forgets to think of his age. He is altogether a notable man--and
I may say, in confidence, that even the Prime Minister has more than
once consulted him with advantage on Colonial affairs."</p>

<p>"You interest me exceedingly," said Sheridan. "Such men are not
common in Australia."</p>

<p>"We are beginning to think otherwise," laughed the Secretary. "And
yet you Australians seem to learn everything without newspapers. I
remember, when Mr. Wyville first appeared here, some years ago, he
might have dropped from the moon, so oblivious was he of the doings
of the European world."</p>

<p>"He must have lived in the bush," said Sheridan, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, he had never heard of the Crimean War," said the Secretary;
"and when I mentioned the Indian Mutiny to him, one day, he gravely
stared, and asked 'What mutiny?' Are you so utterly removed from
civilization--from news, in your bush?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Wyville must certainly have had the minimum of
society," responded Will; "we usually get a report, however vague, of
what your civilization is doing."</p>

<p>"Shall we call on Mr. Wyville?" asked Lord Somers; "he lives in
Grosvenor Street."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to meet him," said Sheridan; and a few
minutes afterwards they stopped before a large and handsome
mansion.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was at home. A coloured servant showed the gentlemen
into a rich reception-room, in which Sheridan's quick eye noted many
Australian features of decoration.</p>

<p>The coloured servant seemed a negro, of the common African type to
the superficial eye of Lord Somers. But there was an air of freedom
about him, an uprightness in the setting of his head on the neck and
shoulders, the effect being heightened by blue-black hair, that stood
straight out like a handsome and very soft brush, which at once
attracted the attention of Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Australian!" he thought, half aloud; "is it possible that a
bushman may be trained in this way?"</p>

<p>He smiled at the absurdity of the thought, but was struck once
more by the man's air as he turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Mir-ga-na nago mial Vasse!" said Sheridan, in a low voice,
--("Mir-ga-na," a common name among bushmen, "you have known," or
"you belong to the Vasse.")</p>

<p>The black man turned as if a shot had struck him, and stared at
the gentlemen, not knowing which had spoken.</p>

<p>"Nago mial wan-gur Vasse?" repeated Mr. Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Tdal-Jung nago Vasse! Guab-ha-leetch!" answered the man, the look
of amazement slowly changing to one of deep pleasure and curiosity.
"My mouth knows the Vasse! That is good!"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said a pleasant voice from a window recess in the room;
"please ask what was the prince's name in his own country."</p>

<p>There came from the recess a handsome, well-set man, who greeted
Lord Somers in a familiar manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Hamerton," said the Secretary, "I have great pleasure
in making you acquainted with another Australian gentleman, whom you
will find as interesting as Mr. Wyville."</p>

<p>The gentleman bowed. Sheridan liked him from the first look. An
aristocrat, stamped; with a broad, open forehead, clear, honest eyes,
a firm mouth and jaw, and a manner above trifles, and careless of
form.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hamerton is a priest of the new order," said Lord Somers to
Sheridan in mock-earnest; "he is a journalist and book maker--hungry
for novelty as an epicure."</p>

<p>The black man had remained in the room, statuesque, his eyes fixed
on Sheridan's face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan, will you please ask his royal name?" said
Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Wan-gon-di?" said Sheridan to the man. "Ngarra-jil," he
answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan motioned him to go.</p>

<p>"He is Ngarra-jil, a native of the Vasse country," said
Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Is this really a language, with even an approach to regular
formation, or the local gibberish of incoherent tribes?" asked Lord
Somers.</p>

<p>"I have not studied its form," answered Mr. Sheridan, "but it
certainly is not a mere local dialect. The same things have the same
names all over the continent, with only a slight difference between
the Swan River and Sydney--two thousand miles apart."</p>

<p>"How did you guess this man's particular nativity?" asked
Hamerton.</p>

<p>"I have lived at the Vasse many years," said Sheridan, "and have
grown familiar with the people. I believe the Vasse natives are the
most superior tribe in Australia."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," said a deep voice behind them; "the Vasse
people are the parent stock of Australia."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville!" said both Lord Somers and Hamerton, with sudden
gravity and respect.</p>

<p>Sheridan turned, and met the eyes of him who had spoken--deep,
searching eyes, that held him strongly for a moment, then passed
quietly to another direction.</p>

<p>Never, among all the men he had known, had Sheridan seen such a
man as this. The head, with all its features, the eye, the voice, the
whole body, were cast in one mould of superb massiveness and beauty.
There was no point of difference or weakness. Among a million, this
man would not have merely claimed superiority, but would have
unconsciously walked through the opening crowd to the front place,
and have taken it without a word. Before him now stood three men
least likely of any in London to be easily impressed--a young and
brilliant statesman, a cynical and able novelist, and a bold and
independent worker; and each of these felt the same strange presence
of a power and a principle to be respected.</p>

<p>Nature, circumstances, and cultivation bad evidently united to
create in this man a majestic individuality. He did not pose or
pretend, but spoke straight the thing he meant to say; yet every
movement and word suggested a reserve of strength that had almost a
mysterious calmness and beauty.</p>

<p>He was dressed in such a way that one would say he never could be
dressed otherwise. Dress was forgotten in the man. But he wore a
short walking or shooting coat, of strong dark cloth. The strength
and roughness of the cloth were seen, rather than the style, for it
seemed appropriate that so strangely powerful a figure should be
strongly clad.</p>

<p>His face was bronzed to the darkness of a Greek's. His voice, as
he spoke on entering the room, came easily from his lips, yet with a
deep resonance that was pleasant to hear, suggesting a possible
tenderness or terror that would shake the soul. It was a voice in
absolutely perfect accord with the striking face and physique.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," he said, holding out his hand, which the other
took with a feeling of rare pleasure, "we should not need a formal
introduction. We are both from a far country, where formality is
unknown; and I have been quite intimate with your plans and progress
there for several years."</p>

<p>Sheridan could hardly stammer a reply, he was so profoundly
astonished. He could only recall the wild nature of West Australian
life, and wonder how it could have contained or developed this
important man.</p>

<p>"You have studied with some effect," continued Mr. Wyville with a
smile, "to have learned the language and discovered the superiority
of the Vasse tribe."</p>

<p>"My life for nine years has been passed among them," answered
Sheridan; "but the possibility of training them to European manners I
should not have thought possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, civilization is only skin deep," said Mr. Wyville,
pleasantly. "The gamut of social law is not very extensive; and a
little skill, practised with kindness and attention, will soon enable
one to run over all the keys."</p>

<p>"You really think it possible, Mr. Wyville," asked Lord Somers,
"to transform the average savage into an obedient footman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, I know it is possible--and I have seen stranger
things accomplished with little difficulty. Refinement and gracious
intercourse, even according to civilized rule, are quite in keeping
with the natural character. We assume that to be savage which is
contrary to our habit; but this is no proof of inferiority. Degraded
civilization is brutal, indeed; but the natural or savage life is
not."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Hamerton, "why can't we put all our savages in
Australia through your civilizing process, and do away with savagery
at one stroke?"</p>

<p>"Why not begin at home?" quietly asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Ah, just so; I hadn't thought of that!" and Hamerton lapsed into
listening, with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Have you actually civilized your savage servant?" asked Lord
Somers.</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite know your meaning, my lord," answered Mr.
Wyville. "All my people are Australians taken from the bush. I am
well served, and honestly; and I have no gossips in my household, for
no one in Europe can speak to my people--except Mr. Sheridan here,"
he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"But how have you changed the nature of the bushmen?" asked Lord
Somers, very much interested.</p>

<p>"I haven't changed it; my men are bushmen still. I have attempted
no change whatever--and that is the secret of my success. It is true,
I have asked Ngarra-jil and the others to wrap some warm cloth round
their bodies while we live in this cold climate; to open the door
when the bell rings; and to drive slowly and carefully in the
streets. This was learned easily in a week or two. The bushmen are
natural horsemen, trained to riding through close woods. We have no
collisions with other carriages, I assure you. Then, again, my men,
being savages, never lie, and never steal."</p>

<p>"But is not this actual civilization?" asked Lord Somers.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" chuckled Hamerton. "I really think it is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you may laugh, Hamerton; but this is very interesting," said
Lord Somers. "Have your men retained any of their savage ways, Mr.
Wyville?"</p>

<p>"I think they have kept all their natural customs, which people in
England call savage ways. They eat and sleep in their own fashion--I
do not see any reason for imposing my way upon them, if they prefer
theirs. Mine is in itself no better, except as it pleases me. They
even keep their familiar implements, if they please."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" asked Lord Somers.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville touched a bell. Ngarra-jil appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Yanga dan-na womerah," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>The Australian disappeared, and in a few moments returned to the
door, holding three or four long and slender spears in one hand, and
the womerah or throwing stick in the other.</p>

<p>Lord Somerton and Mr. Hamerton examined the weapons with great
interest, vainly trying to draw a word from the observant Australian;
while Mr. Wyville took Mr. Sheridan aside, and conversed with him for
several minutes.</p>

<p>On taking their leave, Mr. Wyville gave Sheridan a cordial
invitation to come and see him soon, as he had much to say to
him.</p>

<p>"You will find me at home almost always," he said.</p>

<p>"And if Mr. Wyville is absent, you will certainly find Mr.
Hamerton," said Lord Somers, jestingly.</p>

<p>Before they parted, Lord Somers informed Mr. Sheridan that
Hamerton was a wealthy gentleman, who had refused to adopt his
hereditary title, and who had also decided to earn his own
livelihood, making a yearly division of the profits of his estate
among his farmers and tenants. This had earned him quite another kind
of title amongst the upper classes; but he had gone on working in his
own way, and had already won for himself an honourable name as an
author.</p>

<p>"Hamerton is a Republican now," said Lord Somers, after a pause;
"he was a Socialist in the University."</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan remarked that he seemed quite to agree with Mr.
Wyville's opinions.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Secretary said, "he has been much attracted to this
remarkable man--more so than to any one he has ever known." Lord
Somers also mentioned that the Government was about to introduce a
sweeping reform of the entire penal system, at home and abroad, and
that the assistance of Mr. Wyville bad been deemed of the utmost
importance.</p>

<p>"He has already reformed our system at the Andaman Islands, the
penal colony for India," said the Secretary; "but the Australian
colonies offer a profound problem. If possible, we are bound, he
says, to use the convicts not merely as slaves, preparing the way for
civilized life, but to transform them gradually into a healthy basis
of population."</p>

<p>"It certainly is a wide field, and a grand undertaking," responded
Sheridan, "and it is terribly needed. But Mr. Wyville is an uncommon
mind. I trust his views will be largely heeded by the
Government."</p>

<p>"He has the matter in his own hands," said the Secretary,
confidentially and earnestly; "the Prime Minister has asked him to
draft the entire bill."</p>

<h2>THE UPAS TREE</h2>

<p>IN a few days, as soon as he could do so without apparent haste,
Will Sheridan visited Millbank again, and was escorted by a warder to
the governor's office, where he was graciously received by that
dignitary. Very soon, Sheridan adroitly turned the conversation on
the transport service, and the class of prisoners to be transported
in the next ship. The governor, who was a portly old army major, was
willing enough to talk on this subject.</p>

<p>"The Government has no special ships for transport," said the
governor; "we charter a large reliant vessel, and fit her up for the
voyage. The Houguemont, which will sail in April, is now lying at
Portland under preparation."</p>

<p>"The convicts to be transported you select from those who are best
conducted, do you not?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"No," said the governor, "only the women. These are the healthiest
and best among their class; because they are soon released in
Australia, and get married to liberated men, or go to service in
settlers' houses. But the men who go to Australia are the
opposite--they are the worst criminals in Great Britain. They are
first selected for their sentence; men imprisoned for life, or for
twenty years, are sure to go. Next we take them for re-conviction; we
want to send away as many professional criminals as possible. Then we
make up the number with strong young fellows, who have never been in
prison before, but who are able to do a good deal of hard work."</p>

<p>"I presume the Australian authorities soon give this last class
their liberty, and encourage them to become settlers?" said Sheridan,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary," answered the governor, very gravely, as if
he, subordinate though he was, could see the wrong of the system.
"These men, who should be punished lightest, have the heaviest burden
in Australia. The professionals escape hard tasks, by knowing how;
but these poor fellows, being strong, and ignorant of the rules, are
pushed into the quarry gangs. The chain-gang of Fremantle, of which
you have heard, is filled with these men. Very rarely, indeed, does a
really dangerous criminal get heavy punishment in prison. As a rule,
the worst characters outside are the best in prison."</p>

<p>"It is a bad system," said Sheridan. "Does Mr. Wyville's plan
propose a reform?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville," said the old governor, walking towards the door,
which he closed; then, sinking his voice almost to a whisper, "Mr.
Wyville is a man and a Christian, sir. I have heard him say that the
true penal law should be filled with the spirit of Christ, and that
our present code had none of it. He is going to change the whole
machinery. He knows more about humanity and reform than a regiment of
your K.C.B.'s."</p>

<p>The bluff old Major mopped his face with his large handkerchief.
He was excited.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Sheridan," he continued. "I speak too quickly
against my superiors, perhaps. But I don't do it often; and I think
you Australian gentlemen may have a good deal of influence in making
the new law."</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Wyville intimately, Major?" asked Sheridan. "I have
known him for five years, sir," answered the governor; "since first
he visited this prison with an order from Lord Palmerston. He has
done more good to convicts in that time than all the men in
Britain--I'm free to say that," added the Major, emphatically. "Four
years ago I called his attention to an extraordinary case among our
female convicts--the very prisoner you saw the other day. She had
never prayed, and had hardly spoken a word for five years after she
came here. Mr. Wyville took an interest in her, and he has changed
the whole manner of her life."</p>

<p>"By what means?" asked Sheridan, profoundly interested.</p>

<p>"Means?" repeated the governor, again resorting to his sail-like
handkerchief; "it was done in his own way--unlike any other man's
way. That poor girl's life was saved from insanity and despair, by
what do you think? By a poor little flower--a little common flower he
went and pulled in my garden down there."</p>

<p>Sheridan was about to hear the story of this strange event, when a
low knock came to the door. The governor opened it, and there entered
and stood near the threshold two ladies dressed in black, with snowy
head-dresses. They were Sisters of Mercy, who attended the female
school and hospital. They had come for their ward keys, without which
it was impossible to pass through the pentagons, each ward or passage
ending with a door.</p>

<p>The governor treated the ladies with respect and courtesy. He
handed them their keys with a knightly bow, and, as they retired, he
bowed again, and waited until they bad, reached the end of the
passage before he closed the door. Sheridan who was a Catholic, was
gratified and much surprised at seeing all this.</p>

<p>The governor turned to him with a radiant face. "God bless them!"
he said, earnestly. "They may believe in the Pope of Rome, but it
doesn't prevent them spending their lives for the love of God."</p>

<p>"Are they constant attendants in the prison?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Yes, they might as well be penal convicts, for all they see of
the outside world. It was through these ladies, and the little flower
I spoke of, that Mr. Wyville did so much for the poor girl. I'll tell
you that story some day, Mr. Sheridan, if you care to hear it. Just
now I have to make my rounds of inspection. Will you join me?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said Sheridan; and they passed into one of the
male pentagons.</p>

<p>It was a monotonous and unpleasant routine, this visiting of the
wards. Will Sheridan was glad when they entered the female pentagon,
after half an hour's rapid walking. When at last they came to the
short ward in which Alice was confined, Sheridan's heart was beating
rapidly.</p>

<p>The door of Number Four was open, and one of the nuns was standing
in the cell beside Alice, who sat with her work in her lap. Will
Sheridan heard the low sound of her voice, as she spoke to her
visitor, and it thrilled him like a strain of exquisite music. In
after years, he never forgot the subtle pleasure and pain he
experienced at the sound of her soft voice in that brief
sentence.</p>

<p>The governor stood at the doorway, and greeted Sister Cecilia,
respectfully, then passed on. Will Sheridan had only for one instant
rested his eyes on Alice; but he went away happy, his heart filled
with gratitude. The old governor wondered at the earnest warmth of
his manner as he thanked him and took his leave.</p>

<p>When Will Sheridan emerged from Millbank Prison, he seemed
impatient, and yet pleased. He hailed a cab, and drove straight to
Mr. Wyville's. He was drawn there by a deep, pleasurable feeling of
mingled respect, gratitude, and expectation. He felt unaccountably
light-hearted and joyous. He had no actual thoughts, but only happy
perceptions. The world was changed. He did not know in what the
change consisted; but he certainly was a different man from the
unhappy stranger who had wandered round Millbank a few weeks
before.</p>

<p>He sprang from the cab in Grosvenor square, thinking he would
quiet his excitement by walking the remainder of the way. As he
turned into Grosvenor-street, his eye was attracted by a low and
elegant brougham, driven by a coloured coachman who wore a peculiar
oriental dress. This driver had caught Sheridan's eye at first, and
he was rather surprised when he recognized Mr. Wyville's Australian
servant, Ngarra-jil.</p>

<p>In the carriages, sat two young girls of extraordinary beauty and
similarity of face and age. They were dark-skinned rather than
"coloured," with intensely black hair and flashing eyes. Their faces
were of a splendid, rich bronze, warmer than the Moorish brown of
Spain, and darker than the red bronze of Syria. They were wrapped in
soft furs, their faces only visible. They might have been twins; they
were certainly sisters. They were talking and smiling as they spoke,
as the brougham slowly passed Sheridan, and drew up at Mr. Wyville's
door.</p>

<p>The ladies sprang lightly to the sidewalk, having thrown off their
heavier wraps in the carriage. Their dress beneath was still of rich
furs, of two or three colours. They walked lightly to the door, which
was held open by a black servant, and entered the house.</p>

<p>The incident surprised Sheridan; but he was little given to
curiosity. "Those ladies," he thought, "are certainly Australian
natives, and yet it seems absurd to believe it. But, then, it is no
stranger than everything, connected with this remarkable man."</p>

<p>At Mr. Wyville's he found Lord Somers, who had brought a copy of
Sir Joshua Hobb's new Prison Bill, and Mr. Hamerton. The greeting of
all was pleasant, but Sheridan was especially pleased with the almost
silent cordiality of Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>They had been conversing on criminal matters; and the conversation
was renewed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville," said the Secretary, "I wish to ask you a question I
have put to many philanthropists, with varying results: Have you ever
sought, or, rather, have you ever found the roots of the criminal
upas tree?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville stood facing the window; he turned towards the
Secretary, and his impressive face was in shade, as he answered, in a
low tone--</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, I have sought for it, and I have found it."</p>

<p>"Then, why not announce the discovery? Why not lay the axe to the
root of this tree of evil, and let the world, or at least England, be
freed from the criminal incubus?"</p>

<p>The question was earnestly put, and Hamerton and Sheridan, he with
deep interest, watched the face of Mr. Wyville till the answer
came.</p>

<p>Because, my lord, the tree of evil is a banian--its roots drop
from above; its blood is not drawn directly from the soil, but pours
from the heart of the main stem, which you think healthy. Its
diseased branches ramify through admirable limbs, and cannot be
separated with a knife."</p>

<p>"You are allegorical, Mr. Wyville, but I presume that you
mean--</p>

<p>"That the criminal principle is rooted in the heart of society,
underlies the throne--or let me say, that the throne cannot escape
injury if the axe be laid to its base," said Mr. Wyville, speaking
slowly. The nobleman glanced nervously at Hamerton, who was smiling
broadly, as if intensely pleased.</p>

<p>The Secretary could not give up the point just then, having
reached dangerous ground. And as Wyville remained silent, he was
forced to continue.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Wyville," he said jocosely, "you speak today almost
like a French Republican, and I fear Mr. Sheridan will conceive a
violent prejudice against you. You mean, of course, that the law dare
not attempt to suddenly suppress all crime for fear of exciting
revolution?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, that was not my meaning," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I give it up," said the pleasant nobleman, laughing,
and turning to Hamerton to change the conversation.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Mr. Hamerton, that with all the public and
private money spent in charity and religious work in England, the
existence of a great criminal class is a vastly difficult problem,
and a monstrous popular ingratitude?"</p>

<p>"I agree as to the problem," answered Hamerton, becoming grave;
"but I do not quite see the ingratitude. But may I ask Mr. Wyville to
read us the riddle of his allegory, or to continue it further?"</p>

<p>"Pray do, sir," said the Secretary, seeing no escape.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Mr. Wyville, slightly smiling, but yet very
earnest in look, "my views are personal, as my researches have been.
I have drawn no political dissatisfaction from foreign schools. I
have merely sought among the poor and the tempted for the dangerous
and the lawless; and I have found them, and lived among them, and
have investigated the causes of their state. I have followed the main
root of the criminal plant till I found it disappear beneath the
throne; and its lateral issues run through and under the titled and
heredity circles that ring the monarch."</p>

<p>Hamerton opened his eyes and locked his hands tightly, as he
looked at the speaker; Lord Somers seemed puzzled, and rather
dismayed; while Sheridan enjoyed the conversation keenly.</p>

<p>"Do the roots spring from the throne and the aristocracy, or enter
their crevices from the outside?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"They are boon of aristocracy," answered Wyville, impressively.
"They spring from the rotting luxuries that fall from the tables of
kings and earls and hereditary gentry. They creep from the palaces,
where custom and care are too strong for them, and they crawl to the
cabins and seize on the hearts of the poor for their prey. The seed
of crime is in the flower of aristocracy."</p>

<p>"You speak in paradoxes now, sir," said Lord Somers, interested in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>"I take aristocracy as the efflorescence of the social and
political evil," said Mr. Wyville, now deeply moved by his theme. "It
presupposes the morality of hereditary classes. Men would not, in a
justly ordered state, be born either to luxury, poverty, disease, or
crime. I do not know where or how mankind began to do the social sum
wrong; but I do know, for I see, that the result is appalling--that
millions have evil for a heritage, as truly as you, my lord, have
your entailed estate."</p>

<p>"But how can this be changed or bettered, my dear Mr. Wyville,
except--by the spread of charity and religion among the wealthy?"
asked the peer.</p>

<p>"Ah, pardon me; I consider these things from another standpoint.
Charity among the rich simply means the propriety of the poor being
miserable--that poverty is unfortunate, but not wrong. But God never
meant to send the majority of mankind into existence to exercise the
charity and religion of the minority. He sent them all into the world
to be happy and virtuous, if not equal; and men have generated their
evils by their own blind and selfish rules."</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Wyville," interrupted Mr. Hamerton, "you do not
believe in the American absurdity that men are born equal?"</p>

<p>"I do not think the Americans mean that in your sense, answered
Wyville. "I do believe that every generation men should have a fair
start, and let the best lives win."</p>

<p>"But it never can be done," said Lord Somers.</p>

<p>"It has never been tried, I think, except by fanatics or
philanthropic charity-mongers, who have done more harm than good. The
good shall not come from the stooping of the rich, but from the
raising of the poor; and the poor had better remain poor for another
cycle than be raised by charity, and so pauperized and degraded."</p>

<p>"How would you begin the improvement, had you absolute power?"
asked Mr. Hamerton.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville checked himself with an effort, as he was about to
speak.</p>

<p>"You have led me to utter latent thoughts rather than opinions,"
he said, smiling, and looking towards the nobleman. I fear my upas
roots have led me out of bounds."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamerton seemed annoyed at the check, and strode across the
room impatiently.</p>

<p>"Confound it, Somers," he cried, "throw off your official airs,
and take an interest in principles, as you used to do. Mr. Wyville, I
beg of you to continue; you should not only talk freely here, but I
wish to Heaven you could preach these things in Westminster
Abbey--"</p>

<p>"Let me recall the question of this excitable person, Mr.
Wyville," said his lordship; "he asked how you would begin the reform
of society, had you absolute power?"</p>

<p>"By burning the law-books."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried Hamerton.</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Lord Somers.</p>

<p>"By burning the title-deeds."</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" ejaculated Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Could society exist without the law?" asked the nobleman.</p>

<p>"Not just yet; but it could have a better existence with better
laws. At present the laws of civilization, especially in England, are
based on and framed by property--a depraved and unjust foundation.
Human law should be founded on God's law and human right, and not on
the narrow interests of land and gold."</p>

<p>"What do you propose to effect by such law?" asked Lord
Somers.</p>

<p>"To raise all men above insecurity, which is the hot-bed of
lawlessness," answered Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"But by what means can law make poor men rich?" asked the
nobleman.</p>

<p>"By allowing no one to hold unproductive land while a single man
is hungry. By encouraging small farmers, till every acre of land in
England is teeming with food."</p>

<p>"But men do not live by bread alone. Englishmen cannot all be
farmers. What then?"</p>

<p>"By developing a system of technical education, that would enable
the town and city populations to manufacture to advantage the produce
of the fields and mines."</p>

<p>"Admirable!" cried Hamerton.</p>

<p>"But this is revolution," said the nobleman.</p>

<p>"I know not what it may be called, my lord," responded Mr.
Wyville, impressively; "but it is lawful and right. This can all be
achieved by legal reform, even under present laws."</p>

<p>"Let me not misunderstand you, Mr. Wyville," said the nobleman,
seriously. "Would you propose that the estates of wealthy men be
wrested from them by law?"</p>

<p>"Not without compensation, my lord; and not at all unless they
refused to cultivate the soil or to pay the heavy tax necessary to
insure cultivation. I would do no wrong to make a right. No inherited
nor purchased land should be taken for the benefit of the people
without giving a fair recompense to the aristocrat."</p>

<p>"Well, and having done all this, where should we be?" asked Lord
Somers.</p>

<p>"At the starting-point," answered Mr. Wyville, with a sad smile;
"only at the starting-point. At present, the level of society is
insecurity, poverty, misery; from which spring fear, ignorance,
disease, and crime. Under a better system, the lowest point would be
at least sufficiency, enough for all the human beings in the country;
and this, in time, would eradicate much of the evil, perhaps most of
it."</p>

<p>"Do you think, if there were enough for all, there would not still
be some who would steal?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"For a time there would be," answered Wyville, gravely; "perhaps
for a thousand years or more we should have remnants of common crime.
Men have been thousands of years learning to steal, and cringe, and
lie; at least give them one thousand to unlearn."</p>

<p>"But if it take so long," said Lord Somers, laughing, "we may as
well go on as we are."</p>

<p>"Not so, my lord," answered Wyville, and as he spoke, his face was
lighted with an exaltation of spirit that made it marvellously
beautiful and powerful; "no man who sees the truth, however distant,
can conscientiously go on as if it were not there. Thousands of years
are vast periods; but the love of human liberty and happiness shall
reach out and cling to the eternal. Let every man who believes,
faithfully do his share, sow the seed that he has received, and in
God's time the glorious harvest will come of a pure and truthful
people, whose aristocrats shall be elevated by intelligence and
virtue, and the love of humanity, and not by accident of birth and
superiority in vice and pride."</p>

<p>The three who heard were deeply moved by the earnestness of the
speaker, whose whole being seemed filled with the splendid prophecy.
Lord Somers was the first to speak, returning to the subject of the
Penal Reform Bill.</p>

<p>"And yet, Mr. Wyville, with all your enthusiasm for social reform,
you have given us a bill which is filled with practical attention to
existing institutions."</p>

<p>"Ah, it is too soon to begin; and the beginning will not be at
that point," said Mr. Wyville. "The real evil is outside the prison,
and at present our legal morality calls it good. Until society is
changed by the new common sense of abstract justice, we must
temporize with our criminal codes."</p>

<p>There was a pause: no one seemed willing to break the floating
possibilities of the future.</p>

<p>"You are going to Australia with the next convict ship, are you
not?" Mr. Hamerton at length asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Yes; I wish to see the machinery of the new system put in motion.
Besides, I have personal matters to attend to in the colony."</p>

<p>Sheridan had started so sudden at the question, that now all three
turned their eyes on him.</p>

<p>"I have thought," he said, looking at Lord Somers, "that I also
should like to return to Australia on that ship."</p>

<p>"Would you not prefer to go in my yacht, Mr. Sheridan?" asked Mr.
Wyville. "She will sail for Australia about the same time, and you
shall command her for the voyage."</p>

<p>"I should prefer the ship," said Sheridan. Then, thinking he had
rudely refused, he added: "I desire very keenly to have this
experience."</p>

<p>"You shall have your wish, Sir," said the Secretary; "and I envy
you the companionship of your voyage."</p>

<h1>BOOK THREE<br>ALICE WALMSLEY.</h1>

<h2>MISERERE!</h2>

<p>O, SPIRITS of Unrest and Pain! that grieve for the sorrow dealt
out to weak humanity, sweep from my heart the dull veil of
individuality, and let my being vibrate with the profound pulsation
of those who mourn in the depths. Spirits of Sorrow and Sympathy,
twin sisters of the twilight, touch the trembling chords that sound
the symphony of wrong, and desolation, and despair. Almighty, God, in
Thy wisdom, and surely also in Thy love Thou layest Thine awful
finger on a poor human soul, and it is withered in Thy sight even to
agony and death as far-seeing, our eyes may not discover. In those
supreme moments of trial, when that which we see is black as night,
teach us to trust in Thy guidance, give us light to deny the fearful
temptation of Chance, and faith to believe that all who labour and
are heavy laden may bring their heavy burden trustingly to Thee!</p>

<p>With a prayer, we enter the cell of Alice Walmsley--a cell where
no prayer had been uttered, woful to say, for the first five years of
her life therein. We look upon the calm, white face and the downcast
eyes that, during the hopeless period, had never been raised to
Heaven--except once, and then only in defiance and imprecation.</p>

<p>God's hand had caught her up from the happy plain, to fling her
into the darkest furrows of affliction; and from these depths the
stricken soul had upbraided the judge and rebelled against the
sentence.</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley had been born with a heart all kindness and
sympathy. From her very infancy she had loved intensely the kindly,
the unselfish, and the beautiful. She had lived through her girlhood
as happy, healthy, and pure as the primroses beneath her mother's
hedgerows. She had approached womanhood as a silver stream ripples to
the sea, yearning for its greatness and its troubles and its
joys--hurrying from the calm delights of the meadow banks to the
mighty main of strength, and saltness, and sweetness.</p>

<p>The moment of communion was reached at last, when her girlish life
plunged with delicious expectation into the deep and in one hideous
instant she knew that for ever she had parted from the pure and
beautiful, and was buried in an ocean of corruption and
disappointment, rolled over by waves of unimaginable and inevitable
suffering, and wrong.</p>

<p>From the first deep plunge, stifled, agonized, appalled, she rose
to the surface, only to behold the land receding from her view--the
sweet fields of her innocent and joyous girlhood fading in the
distance.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, and saw the heaven calm and beautiful above
her, sprinkled with gem-like stars--and she cried, she screamed to
God for help in her helplessness. The answer did not come--the lips
of God were dumb--it seemed as if He did not heed nor see the ruin of
one puny human life. The sky was as beautiful and serene as before,
and the stars were as bright.</p>

<p>Then, from the crest of the wave, as she felt herself slipping
back into the dreadful depths again, and for ever, she raised her
face to heaven, and shrieked reproach and disbelief and
execration!</p>

<p>On the very day of her marriage, before the solemn words of the
ceremony had left her memory, she had looked for one dread moment
beneath the mask of him who had won her love and trust--some old
letters of her husband relating to Will Sheridan had fallen into her
hands--and she shrank within herself, affrighted at the knowledge of
deceit and habitual falsehood that the glimpse had brought her. It
was her first grief and secret, and she hid it in her soul for months
before she dared look upon it again.</p>

<p>But a single grief, even though a heavy one, could not crush the
light out of so joyous and faithful a heart, She still possessed the
woman's angelic gifts of hope and faith. She had, too, the woman's
blessed quality of mercy. She forgave, trusting that her forgiveness
would bring a change. She prayed, and waited, and hoped--in secret
confidence with her own heart. Another influence would be added to
hers ere long. When she gave his child into his arms, and joined its
supplication to hers, she believed, nay, she knew, that her happiness
would be returned to her.</p>

<p>But before that day came, she was left alone. Her husband from the
hour she had given herself into his power, bad followed one careless,
selfish, and cynical course. She would not, could not believe that
this was his natural life, but only a temporary mood.</p>

<p>When first he spoke of going to sea again, on a long voyage, she
was pleased, and thought gladly of the change for her, who had never
seen the great world. When he coldly said that she was to remain, she
became alarmed--she could not be left alone--she implored, she prayed
to go with him.</p>

<p>Then came the sneer, the brutal refusal, the master's command, the
indelible insult of expressed weariness and dislike. She held her
peace.</p>

<p>When the day came, he would have left her, for years of absence,
without a kiss; but the poor soul, hungering and waiting for a loving
word or look, unable to believe her great affection powerless to win
a return, could not bear this blighting memory. She clung to him,
sobbing her full heart on his breast; she kissed him and prayed for
him, with her hands on his shoulders, and her streaming eyes on his;
she--blamed herself, and told him she would be happy till
he--returned--the thought of her coming joy would bless her life, and
bless and preserve him on the sea. With such words she let him
go.</p>

<p>Firmly and faithfully the loving heart kept this last promise.
Months passed, and her lonely home grew very dear to her. Her young
heart refused to remember the pain of the past, and would recall, day
after day, untiringly, the few poor pleasures of her wedded life. She
would not allow herself to think how much even of these pleasures was
due to others than her husband--to her mother and her old
friends.</p>

<p>But all her sorrow died, and her doubt and fear fled away, on the
day when she took to her yearning breast the sweet baby that was hers
and his. God's eye seemed too full of love that day. The harvest of
her young life was the bursting of a flower of exquisite joy. Her
baby was a prayer--God had come near to her, and had sent her an
angelic present. Her life for many days was a ceaseless crooning
melody of soft happiness, mingled with prayers for her husband absent
on the sea.</p>

<p>Then came the lightning, and blasted her fabric of joy, and
shrivelled her future life into hopelessness before her face. One
moment it rose fair and sightly and splendid; the next, it was
scattered at her scorched feet, a pile of blackened and pitiful ruin.
O, day of sorrow, would it had been of death!</p>

<p>It was a bright and happy morning, and she sat in her pleasant
little room, with the baby in her arms. She had been dreaming awake.
She was full of peace and thankfulness for her exceeding joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a shadow fell upon her--someone had entered the room.
She looked up, and met a terrible face--a woman's face, glaring at
her and her child. She could not scream--she was paralyzed with
terror. The face was crowded with passion--every dreadful line seemed
to possess a voice of wrath and hatred.</p>

<p>Alice had no power to defend herself; but she folded her baby
closer to her breast, and looked straight at the dreadful face.</p>

<p>"You think you are his wife!" cried the woman, with a laugh of
hideous derision. "You think he loves you! You lie! You lie! He is my
husband! He never was yours! He is mine, mine! And he lied to
you!"</p>

<p>More was said by the woman--much more; but it all resolved itself
into this in Alice's confused memory. Papers the stranger produced,
and held before Alice's eyes. She read the written words--they were
transferred to her brain in letters of fire. Nearer and nearer came
the dreadful woman, and more threatening the insults she hissed into
Alice's face. She laid her hand on the baby's shoulder, and crushed
it, cursing it.</p>

<p>Still Alice could not scream. Her heart gave irregular throbs--her
brain was beginning to reel. Nearer, still nearer, the hateful
face--the words struck her in the eyes like missiles--they sprang
like knives at her heart--her body grew weak, the baby fell from her
breast and lay upon her knees --O God! the silent agony--the terrible
stranger had seized the child--the mother's senses failed--the
sunlight grew dark--the sufferer fell unconscious at her enemy's
feet.</p>

<p>When she raised her head, after hours of a merciful blank, she was
alone--her baby lay dead before her--and the love and trust of her
life lay stark and strangled by its side.</p>

<p>What more? Nay, there was no more to be borne. The worst had come.
The flaming rocket had spent its last spark in the dark sky--the
useless stick was falling to the earth, to be forgotten forever.</p>

<p>Friends! What had they to say? Kindness was dead. Shame had no
existence. Sorrow, disgrace, infamy, what had she to do with these?
But they had taken her, had seized her as their prey, and she would
make no resistance.</p>

<p>With bonds of faith and love and trust and hope, Alice Walmsley's
life had been firmly bound to all that was good and happy. The
destroyer's knife had severed all these at one merciless sweep; and
the separated and desolated heart sank like lead into the abyss of
despair.</p>

<p>Then followed a blank--intermixed with turmoil of formal evidence
and legal speeches, and voices of clinging friends, who implored her
to speak and clear herself of the dreadful charge. At this word, her
mind cleared--she looked at and understood her position--and she
refused to speak--she would not plead "not guilty" when charged with
killing her own child. Her mother, broken with years and with this
affliction, tottered from the rails of the dock, against which she
had leant, and sank heart-broken on the floor of the court. She was
carried to the open air by weeping strangers--carried past Alice, who
never looked upon her dear face again.</p>

<p>Still she stood silent, tearless, but conscious of every act and
relation. Anguish had changed her in one day from a girl into a
strong self-reliant woman. To her own soul she said: "My life is in
ruin--nothing can now increase the burden. If I speak, another will
stand here--another who has been wronged as I have been. She was
wretched before she became guilty. Let me undergo--let me never see
the face of one who knew me, to remind me of the past. Between
freedom and memory, and imprisonment and forgetfulness--I choose the
latter."</p>

<p>These thoughts never became words in Alice's mind; but this was
the mental process which resulted in her silence in the dock. The
trial was short--she was found guilty. Then came the solitude and
silence of the great prison.</p>

<p>Four white walls, a stone floor, a black iron door, a heavily
barred window, through which she looked up at the moon and stars at
night--and, enclosed within these walls, a young and beautiful girl,
a tender heart that had never throbbed with a lawless desire, a
conscience so sensitive, and a mind so pure, that angels might have
communed with her.</p>

<p>Shall not this prisoner find peace in solitude, and golden sermons
in the waves of pain?</p>

<p>She had been one day and night in Millbank. The severe matron or
warder of the Pentagon opened her cell door in the morning, and
handed her two books, a Bible and prayer-book.</p>

<p>The window of the cell, outside the bars, was open. Without a word
to the warder, the prisoner threw the books out of the open
window.</p>

<p>"They are not true; I shall pray no more," she said, not fiercely,
but firmly, as they fell into the yard within the Pentagon.</p>

<p>She was reported to the authorities. They sent the Bible reader to
pray with her, in the cell, according to the rule laid down in
convict prisons; but she remained silent. They punished her--for the
dreadful word "Murder" was printed on her door-card; they shut her up
in a dark cell for days and weeks, till her eyes dilated and her body
shrank under the meagre food. Remember, a few weeks before, she was a
simple, God-fearing country girl. Neither prayer nor punishment could
bring her into relenting, but only deepened the earnestness of her
daily answer--</p>

<p>"I shall pray no more."</p>

<p>Her case was brought before the Chief Director, Sir Joshua Hobb.
This disciplinarian visited her dark cell, and, with a harsh "Ho,
there!" flashed a brilliant lamp on the entombed wretch. She sat on a
low seat in the centre of the dark cell, her face bowed into her
hands, perhaps to shut out the painfully sudden glare.</p>

<p>"She won't pray, eh?" said the great reformer, looking at the
slight figure that did not move. "We'll see." He evidently took a
special interest in this case.</p>

<p>An hour later, the prisoner was taken from her cell, and dragged
or pushed by two strong female warders till she stood.</p>

<p>In an arched passage beneath the prison. Her clothing was rudely
torn from her shoulders to the waist; her wrists were strapped to
staples in the wall; and, before her weakened and benumbed brain had
realized the unspeakable outrage, the lash had swept her delicate
flesh into livid stripes.</p>

<p>Then, for one weak moment, her womanhood conquered, and she
shrieked, as if in supplication, the name of Him she had so bitterly
refused to worship.</p>

<p>But the scream of her affliction was not a prayer--it was the
awful utterance of a parting spirit, the cry of a wrecked and
tortured soul, an imprecation born of such agony as was only
utterable in a curse. May God pity and blot out the sin!</p>

<p>They carried her senseless body to the hospital, where
unconsciousness befriended her for many weeks. A brain fever racked
her; she lived the terrors of the past every hour; a weaker body
would have sunk under the strain; but her time had not yet come.</p>

<p>The fever left her at last--her consciousness returned; the
austere, philanthropic women and hackneyed preachers laboured by her
bedside in rigid charity and sonorous prayer, during which her eyes
remained closed and her lips motionless.</p>

<p>As her strength returned, she moved about the ward, feeling a
pleasant relief when she could do a kindness to another inmate weaker
than herself. She would warm the drinks, smooth the pillows, or
carefully give the medicines as prescribed, to her unfortunate
sisters. And all this she performed silently. She never smiled, and
no one but her own heart knew that her labour for others gave her
comfort.</p>

<p>When her health was quite restored, she had become valuable to the
physicians and warders. She was asked to remain in the hospital
rather than to go back and work in the cells.</p>

<p>She chose the hospital, and entered at once on her regular duties
as a nurse.</p>

<p>Why did she choose the busy hospital, instead of the solitary
cell? Because she was still a woman. Trust in God had been taken from
her; but she remained unselfish, or, rather, her life had assumed an
exalted selfishness, possible only to highly organized natures.
Though God was deaf, she could not believe that good was dead, for
she still felt sympathy for her fellow sufferers. God had made the
world, but had forgotten it, and the spirit of evil had taken His
place.</p>

<p>"They say you don't believe in religion?" said a dying woman to
her one day; "then maybe you don't believe that God has punished me
like this for my evil ways?"</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley looked at the unfortunate--then searched her own
heart before answering. Her affliction was her own; God had deserted
her--had He also deserted this poor wretch?</p>

<p>"God has not punished you," she answered; "you have brought on
your own punishment."</p>

<p>"Then God will give me my child in the other world?" cried the
woman, with pitiful earnestness. "Oh, say He, will, and I shall die
happy!"</p>

<p>Alice did not answer, but the iron of the question pierced her
soul. There lived beneath all the burden of her suffering a love that
thrilled her day and night, a yearning that never slept, a memory and
pity of unspeakable tenderness for her dead child. It was grief in
love and love in grief. She had tried to reason it away, but in vain.
God, who had tortured her, or allowed her torture, had seized her
babe for ransom. While she was wronged before Him, He held a hostage
for her silence.</p>

<p>How should she answer this dying woman's question?</p>

<p>She walked from the ward straight to the matron's office, and
asked to be sent to the cells--she could work no more in the
hospital.</p>

<p>Expostulation, argument, threats, had no effect on her
determination. Her resolution troubled every one in the hospital, for
her services were highly prized. But she had settled the question.
The mind may delay in solving a problem, but the soul's solution is
instantaneous and unalterable. She was sent to the cell.</p>

<p>A FLOWER IN THE CELL.</p>

<p>Five years of silent imprisonment had passed over Alice
Walmsley--years of daily and hourly change and excitement for the
outer world. Five years in solitary confinement are only one day, one
day of dreary monotony repeated one thousand eight hundred and
twenty-five times.</p>

<p>Take a starving beggar from the street, and seat him at your
table, and tell him that he shall have food and money if he will turn
his plate face downward, and return it face upward, one thousand
eight hundred and twenty-five times--and the hungry wretch will drop
from exhaustion before half the turnings are done, and will run from
your house with curses. The solitary prisoner turns the same number
of days with harrowing weariness a thousand times multiplied in five
years. The days and nights of those years had passed like a black and
white vibration over Alice Walmsley's life. They had brought little
change to the outward eye; and the inward change was only a
settlement of the elements of doubt and disbelief and despair into a
solid deposit in her heart.</p>

<p>No friends had visited her. When her mother died, there was left
no living relative. She had no love nor attraction beyond her
cell--beyond her own soul. Every tie worth keeping had then been torn
asunder. Some lesser bonds she since had unloosed herself. Why should
any happy thing be united to one so forlorn and wretched?</p>

<p>For God's pleasure she was undergoing this torture--so they told
her. She had neither sinned nor rebelled. She had been given life,
and she had grown to love it--but when the summer of her life had
come, she was drenched with affliction and wrong, which she had not
earned, of the cause of which she was as innocent as her babe,
murdered before her eyes. Her heart, hope, love, trust, had been
flung down and trampled in the dust.</p>

<p>The alms of prayer that were doled out by the nasal
Scripture-readers had long since been carried past her door. They
regarded her as hopelessly lost. She never spoke her dissent; but
they could see that she did not hear them, that she did not believe
them. So they left her to herself.</p>

<p>One day, a man sat in the governor's office with a large book
before him, in which he had been carefully reading a page on which
the governor, standing beside him, had placed his index finger.</p>

<p>"It is a remarkable case," said the governor; "and she certainly
is not insane."</p>

<p>"She was not a criminal by association?" asked the visitor,
closing the book. He was a powerfully built, dark-faced man, with a
foreign air and a deep voice. The studied respect of the governor
proved him to be a person of importance. It, was Mr. Wyville, who had
recently arrived in London, and who was visiting the prisons, with
authority from the Ministry itself.</p>

<p>"No," said the governor; "she was a village girl, wife of a sea
captain. Here, at page 42, we find the police reports-see, only one
short entry. The police didn't know her."</p>

<p>"She has never defended herself, nor reproached others?" asked Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>"Never," answered the governor. "She has never spoken about
herself."</p>

<p>"It is very strange, and very sad," said Mr. Wyville to the
governor. And to himself he murmured, "She must have suffered fearful
wrong."</p>

<p>Soon after, in company with the governor, he passed along the
corridor, and stopped at Alice Walmsley's cell. The warder opened the
door. Mr. Wyville did not look at the prisoner, but walked across the
cell, as if observing the window bars, upon which he laid his
hand.</p>

<p>"The iron is covered with rust," Wyville said to the governor.
"The windows of this range certainly need repainting."</p>

<p>Then, apparently looking round in the same practical way, Mr.
Wyville remained, perhaps, a minute in the cell. He had scarcely
turned his eyes on the prisoner; yet the mute intensity of her face
had sunk into his heart.</p>

<p>"She has been terribly wronged," he repeated to himself, as he
left the prison. "God help her! she is very young to be so calm."</p>

<p>When Mr. Wyville emerged from the prison arch, he walked rapidly
along the river towards Westminster. He was in deep thought. He
proceeded a little distance, then stopped, and looked down on the
turbid stream, as if undecided. This was unlike the usual calm
deliberateness of his conduct. He was evidently perplexed and
troubled. After pausing a while, he looked at his watch, and then
retraced his steps, passed Millbank, and walked on in the direction
of Chelsea.</p>

<p>It was an old habit of his to solve difficult questions as he
walked; and he selected a quiet suburb, with streets leading into the
country roads.</p>

<p>In the streets, there was nothing very noticeable about the man,
except his athletic stride and deeply bronzed face. He might be
classed by the passing observer as a naval officer who had served
many years in southern latitudes, or as a foreign captain. His dress
had something of the sailor about its style and cloth. But it is the
inner man who interests us: let us follow the burden of his
thought.</p>

<p>Remorse does not end in this calmness, unless the prisoner be
insane. Her mind is clear; she is not melancholy; she is
self-possessed and firm. Her health has not suffered. Yet, she has
abandoned belief in man's truth and God's mercy. She does not claim
that she is innocent; she makes no defense and no charge; she accepts
her punishment without a complaint. These are not the symptoms of
remorse or guilt. She has abandoned prayer; she deliberately shuts
out the past and the future. Yet she is in all other respects
obedient, industrious, and kind. There is only one explanation of
these contradictions--she is innocent, and she has suffered terrible
wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville did not return to his house till late in the evening.
He had walked for hours; and, as he went, he had unravelled, with
infinite patience, the psychological net-work that had troubled him.
He had come to a decision.</p>

<p>Two days after his visit to the prison, Alice Walmsley sat in her
cell, sewing tirelessly. The morning had opened like all the other
mornings of her imprisonment; there was nothing new, nothing to
suggest a new train of thought.</p>

<p>Someone who walked along the corridor about ten o'clock had seemed
to hesitate a moment at her cell, and then had passed on. The
governor, she thought, who had glanced through the watch-grate.</p>

<p>In the wall of every cell there was a minute hole, about two
inches square on the exterior, cut in the solid stone. The opening,
which grew wide towards the interior of the cell, was in the shape of
a wedge. A warder outside could see a large part of the cell, while
the prisoner could only see the eye of the warder. As the officers
wore woollen slippers, they could observe the prisoners without being
heard or seen.</p>

<p>At this opening, Alice Walmsley thought, the governor had stopped
as he passed, and had looked into her cell. It was not unusual.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she paused in her work, almost impatiently,
and tried to put away from her an unwelcome thought.</p>

<p>After a short pause she renewed her sewing, working rapidly for a
few minutes; and then she laid the coarse cloth aside, and buried her
face in her hands.</p>

<p>She was thinking of her old life, of her old self; she had tried
to escape from it, but could not. For years she had separated the
past and the present, until she had actually come to think of herself
as two beings--one, who had been happy, and who was dead; the other,
living but separated from all the world--alone, with neither memories
nor hopes, neither past nor future.</p>

<p>Yet to-day, without apparent cause, the two selves had drawn
together--the happy Alice had come beseechingly to the unhappy
one.</p>

<p>For an hour she remained motionless, her face bowed in her hands.
Then she raised her head, but she did not renew her work. She stood
up, and walked across the cell, and re-crossed it, in the rapid way
of restless prisoners; but on the second passage she stood still,
with a bewildered air. Her eye had caught a gleam of bright colour in
the opening of the watch-grate. There was a flower in her cell!</p>

<p>She trembled as she reached her hand to take it. She did not try
to recover her dispassionate calmness. She took it in her hand, and
raised it to her lips slowly, and kissed it. It was a sweet rosebud,
with two young leaves. She had not seen a flower nor heard a bird
sing since she left her own little garden.</p>

<p>This tender thing had stolen inside her guard. Its sweet
fragrance, before she knew of its presence, had carried her mind back
to the happy days of her girlhood. She kept the flower to her lips,
kissing it. She fed her wistful eyes on its beauty. She had been so
long without emotion, she had so carefully repressed the first
promptings of imagination, that her heart had become thirsty unto
death for some lovely or lovable thing. This sweet young flower took
for her all forms of beauty. As she gazed on it, her soul drank in
its delicious breath, like a soft and sensuous music; its perfect
colouring filled her--with still another delight; its youth, its
form, its promise, the rich green of the two leaves, its exquisite
completeness, made a very symphony for the desolate heart.</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and still she fondled the precious gift. She had
not once thought of how the flower had come into her cell.</p>

<p>"You are pleased at last, Number Four," said a female warder, who
had been looking into Alice's cell.</p>

<p>Number Four raised her eyes from the flower, and looked silently
her answer. For the first time in five years the warder saw that her
eyes were flooded with tears.</p>

<p>She did not sew any more that day--and, strange to say, the
officers took no heed of her idleness. There was a change in her
face, a look of unrest, of strangeness, of timidity.</p>

<p>When first she looked upon the flower, a well had burst up in her
heart, and she could not stop its flood. In one hour it had swept
away all her barriers, had swamped her repression, had driven out the
hopeless and defiant second self, and had carried into her cell the
wronged, unhappy, but human and loving heart of the true Alice
Walmsley.</p>

<p>She was herself. She feared to think it, but she knew it must be
so. When the warder spoke to her now, she shrank from the tone.
Yesterday, it would have passed her like the harsh wind,
unheeded.</p>

<p>That night, unlike all the nights of her imprisonment, she did not
lie down and sleep as soon as the lights were extinguished. With the
little flower in her hand, she sat on her low bedside in the still
darkness, feeling through all her nature the returning rush of her
young life's sympathy with the world.</p>

<p>The touch of the rosebud in her hand thrilled her with tenderness.
She made no attempt to shut out the crowding memories. They flooded
her heart, and she drank them in as a parched field drinks the
drenching rain.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the moon rose above the city, silver-white in a
black-blue sky, lovelier than ever she had seen it, Alice thought, as
she looked through the bars of her window. She stood upon her low
bed, opened the window, and looked up. At that moment her heart was
touched with a loving thought of her dead mother. Her arms rested on
the window ledge, and her hands were raised before her, holding
between them the little flower, as she might have held a
peace-offering to a king.</p>

<p>Softly as the manna falls upon the desert, or the dew upon the
wild flower, descended on the afflicted heart the grace of God's love
and mercy. The Eye that looked from above on that white face upturned
amid the gloom of the prison, beheld the eyes brimmed with tears, the
lips quivering with profound emotion, and the whole face radiant with
faith and sorrow and prayer.</p>

<p>"O, thank God!" she whispered, her weeping eyes resting on the
beautiful deep sky, Thank God for this little flower. O, mother, hear
me in heaven, and pray for me, that God may forgive me for doubting
and denying His love!"</p>

<p>With streaming eyes--she sank upon her knees by the bedside, and
poured her full heart in passionate prayer. And, as she prayed,
kneeling on the stones of her cell, with bowed head, the beautiful
moon had risen high in the vault of night, and its radiance flooded
the cell, as if God's blessing were made manifest in the lovely
light, that was only broken by the dark reflection of the window
bars, falling upon the mourner in the form of a cross. It was long
past midnight when she lay down to rest.</p>

<p>But next day Alice began her monotonous toil as on all previous,
days. She was restless, unhappy; her face was stained with weeping in
the lone, vigil of the night. But her heart had changed with the
brief rest she had taken. She began her day without prayer. Her mind
had moved too long in one deep groove to allow its direction to be
changed without laborious effort.</p>

<p>The little flower that had touched her heart so deeply the day
before, lay upon the low shelf of her cell. Alice took it up with a
movement of the lips that would have been a sad smile but for the
emptiness of her poor heart. "It grew in its garden, and loved its
sweet life," she thought; "and when the sun was brightest, the
selfish Hand approached and tore it from its stem, to throw it next
day into the street, perhaps."</p>

<p>Then flashed, for the first time, into her mind the question--Who
had placed the flower in her cell? Had she been unjust--and had the
Hand that pulled this flower been moved by kindness, and kindness to
her?</p>

<p>The thought troubled her, and she became timid and impressionable
again. Who had brought her this flower? Whoever had done so was a
friend, and pitied her. Else why--but perhaps every prisoner in the
ward had also received a flower. Her heart closed, and her lips
became firm at the thought.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, she pulled the signal wire of her cell, which
moved a red board outside the door, so that it stood at right angles
from the wall. This brought the warder, to know what was wanted. The
door was opened, and the warder, a woman with a severe face but a
kind eye, stood in the entrance. Alice had the flower in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Have all the prisoners received flowers like this?" she inquired,
with a steady voice.</p>

<p>"No," said the warder.</p>

<p>In five years, this was the first question Number Four had ever
asked.</p>

<p>"Why was this given to me?" she asked, her voice losing its
firmness, and her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the warder.</p>

<p>This was true: the hand that had dropped the flower into the
watch-grate had done so unseen. The warder only knew that orders had
been received from the governor that Number Four was not to be
disturbed, nor the flower taken away.</p>

<p>The door closed again, and Alice raised the flower to her lips and
kissed it. Someone had pitied her--had thought of her. She was not
alone in the world. This reflection she could not drive away. She sat
down to her work; but she could not see the cloth--her eyes were
blurred with tears, her hands trembled. At last she rose and pressed
her open hands to her streaming eyes, and then sank on her knees
beside her bed, and sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>How long she remained so she did not know, but she felt a band
laid softly oil her head, and heard her name called in a low
voice--</p>

<p>"Alice!"</p>

<p>A woman had entered the cell, and was kneeling beside her.</p>

<p>Alice raised her head, and let her eyes rest on a face as
beautiful as an angel's, a face as white as if it were a prisoner's,
but calm and sweet and sympathetic in every feature; and round the
lovely face Alice saw a strange, white band, that made it look like a
face in a picture.</p>

<p>It was a Sister of Mercy she had seen before when she worked in
the hospital; she remembered she bad seen her once sit up all night
bathing the brow of a sick girl, dying of fever. This thought came
clearly to her mind as she looked at Sister Cecilia's face, and saw
the unselfishness and devotion of her life in her pure look.</p>

<p>"Alice," said Sister Cecilia, "why do you grieve so deeply? Tell
me why you are so unhappy--tell me, dear, and I will try to make you
happier, or I will grieve with you."</p>

<p>Alice felt her whole self-command deserting her, and her heart
melting at the kindness of the voice and words.</p>

<p>"Turn to me, and trust me--, dear," said Sister Cecilia. "Tell me
why you weep so bitterly. I know you are innocent of crime, Alice; I
never believed you guilty. And now I have come to bring you
comfort."</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia had put one arm around Alice, and, as she spoke,
with the other hand she raised the tearful face and kissed it. Then
the flood-gates of Alice's affliction burst, and she wept as if her
heart were breaking.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia waited till the storm of sorrow had exhausted
itself, only murmuring little soothing words all the time, and
patting the sufferer's hand and cheek softly.</p>

<p>"Now, dear," she said at length, "as we are kneeling, let us pray
for a little strength and grace, and then you shall tell me why you
grieve."</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia, taking Alice's hands between her own, raised them
a little, and then she raised her eyes, with a sweet smile on her
face, as if she were carrying a lost soul to the angels, and in a
voice as simple as a child's, and as trustful, said the Lord's Prayer,
Alice repeating the words after her.</p>

<p>Never before had the meaning of the wonderful prayer of prayers
entered Alice's soul. Every sentence was full of warmth and comfort
and strength. The words that sank deepest were these--she repeated
them afterwards with the same mysterious effect--"Thy will be done on
earth, as it is in heaven." She did not know why these words were the
best, but they were.</p>

<p>"Now, Alice," said Sister Cecilia, rising cheerfully when the
prayer was done, "we are going to bathe our faces and go on with our
sewing, and have a long talk."</p>

<p>Alice obeyed, or, rather, she followed the example. Sister
Cecilia's unaffected manner had won her so completely that she felt a
return of her girlish companionship. All other teachers of religion
whom Alice had seen in the prison had come to her with unsympathetic
formality and professional airs of sanctity, which repelled her.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Alice was quietly sewing, while Sister
Cecilia sat on the pallet and talked, and drew Alice into a chat.
She made no reference to the grief of the morning. The cases in the
hospital, the penitence of poor sick prisoners, the impenitence of
others, the gratitude and the selfishness and the many other phases
of character that came under her daily observation--these were the
topics of the little Sister's conversation.</p>

<p>"Why, I might as well be a prisoner, too," she said, smiling, and
making Alice smile; "I have been in the hospital seven years. I was
there two years before you came. You see, I am as white as a
prisoner."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, looking sadly at her; "it is not right. Why do
you not grieve as they do?"</p>

<p>"Why?" answered Sister Cecilia, gaily, "because I am not a
criminal, perhaps. I am like you, Alice; I have less reason to grieve
than the other poor things."</p>

<p>Alice had never seen it in this light before, and she could not
help smiling at the philosophy of the little Sister. But she was
affected by it very deeply.</p>

<p>"If you had remained in the hospital, Alice," said the nun, "you
would have been as much a Sister of Mercy as I am. Do you know, I was
very sorry when you left the hospital."</p>

<p>Every word she said, somehow, touched Alice in a tender place. Was
the wise little nun choosing her words? At any rate, it was well and
kindly done.</p>

<p>When she kissed Alice, and pulled the signal wire to go out, her
smile filled the cell and Alice's heart with brightness. She promised
to come and see her every day till the ship sailed; and then they
would be together all the day.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Australia?" asked Alice, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Sister Cecilia, with a smile of mock surprise.
"Why, those poor children couldn't get along without me--fifty of
them. Now, I'm very glad I shall have you to help me, Alice. We'll
have plenty to do, never fear."</p>

<p>She was leaving the cell--the warder had opened the door when
Alice timidly touched her dress and drew her aside out of the
warder's sight.</p>

<p>"I am not a Catholic," said Alice, in a tremulous whisper.</p>

<p>"No matter, child" said the little nun, taking her face between
her hands and kissing her eyes; "you are a woman. Good-bye till
to-morrow; and say your prayers, like my own good girl."</p>

<p>Alice stood gazing at the spot where she had stood long after the
door had closed. Then she turned and looked through the window at the
bright sky, with her hands clasped at full length before her. As she
looked, a sparrow perched on her windowsill, and she smiled--almost
laughed--at the little cautious fellow. She took some crumbs from her
shelf and threw them to him; and as she did so, she thought that she
might have done it every day for five years, had she been as happy as
she was then.</p>

<h2>FOLLOWING A DARK SPIRIT.</h2>

<p>ABOUT a week after the incident of the flower, Mr. Wyville,
accompanied by his black servant, Ngarra-jil, left London on the
Northern train. The black man was clad from throat to feet in a wrap
or mantle of thick cloth, though the summer day was bland and warm.
He settled silently into a corner of the railway carriage, watching
his master with a keen and constant look. Mr. Wyville, sitting beside
the window, seemed to observe the richly cultivated fields and
picturesque villages through which the mail train flew without
pausing; but, in truth, he neither saw nor thought of outward
things.</p>

<p>There is a power in some minds of utterly shutting out
externals--of withdrawing, the common functions from the organs of
sense to assist the concentration of the introverted mind. At such a
time the open eye is blind--it has become a mere lens, reflecting but
not perceiving; the tympanum of the ear vibrates to the outward wave,
but has ceased to translate its message to the brain. The soul within
has separated itself from the moving world, and has retired to its
cell like an anchorite, taking with it some high subject for
contemplation or some profound problem for solution.</p>

<p>From this closet of the soul emerge the lightning thoughts that
startle, elevate, and deify mankind, sweeping away old systems like
an overflow of the ocean. Within this cell the Christ-mind reflected
for thirty-three years, before the Word was uttered. Within this cell
the soul of Dante penetrated the horrescent gloom of the infernal
spheres, and beheld the radiant form of Beatrice. Within this cell
the spirit that was Shakespeare bisected the human heart, and read
every impulse of its mysterious network. Here the blind Milton forgot
the earth, and lived an awful aeon beyond the worlds, amid the
warring thoughts of God.</p>

<p>Great and sombre was the Thought which lay within the cell of this
traveller's soul to be investigated and solved. Villages, and fields,
and streams passed the outward eye, that was, for the time, the
window of a closed and darkened room.</p>

<p>As the pale corpse lies upon the dissecting table, before the
solitary midnight student, so lay upon the table, within this man's
soul, a living body for dissection--the hideous body of Crime. For
years it had lain there, and the brooding soul had often withdrawn
from the outer world to contemplate its repulsive and mysterious
aspect. The knife was in the hand of the student, but he knew not
where to begin the incision. The hideous thing to be examined was
inorganic as a whole, and yet every atom of its intertexture was a
perfect organ.</p>

<p>To his unceasing vision, the miscreated form became luminous and
transparent; and he saw that, throughout its entire being, beat one
maleficent pulsation, accordant with the rhythm of some unseen and
intermittent sea. He saw that the parts and the whole were one, yet
many--that every atom had within itself the seminal part and the
latent pulse of the ocean of Sin.</p>

<p>For years he had looked upon this fearful body, wonderful,
observant, speculative. For years, when the contemplation had ceased,
he had knelt beside the evil thing and prayed for light and
knowledge.</p>

<p>Day and night were as an outward breath to the soul of the
thinker. The light faded and the darkness fell, but he knew it not.
His whole being was turned within, and he would have groaned with
sorrow at what he saw, were it not for an adamantine faith in God,
love, and justice, that bridged the gulf of doubt with a splendid
arch.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the train arrived in Liverpool. The black
man, Ngarra-jil, who had watched so long and tirelessly the
marvellous face of his master, rose from his corner, purposely
arousing Mr. Wyville's attention. He smiled kindly at Ngarra-jil, and
spoke to him in his own language, continuing to do so as they were
driven through the streets to a hotel.</p>

<p>Something of unusual importance had brought Mr. Wyville from
London. That night, though the fatigue of the journey would have
overpowered an ordinary man, he did not retire to rest till early
morning, and then he slept scarcely three hours. In the forenoon of
that day, leaving Ngarra-jil at the hotel, he took a further journey,
to the little village of Walton-le-Dale--the native village of Alice
Walmsley.</p>

<p>It was clear that Mr. Wyville had come to Lancashire on some
purpose connected with this unhappy girl, for his first visit, having
inquired at the inn, was to the quiet street where stood her old
home. He walked up the weed-grown pathway to the deserted house, and
finding the outer door of the porch unlocked, as it had been left
five years before, he entered, and sat there on the decaying bench
for a short time. Then he retraced his steps, and inquired his way to
the police station.</p>

<p>The solitary policeman of Walton-le-Dale was just at that time
occupied in painting a water barrel, which stood on its donkey-cart
in the street.</p>

<p>There was only one well of sweet water in Walton, the village
lying on very low land; and the villagers paid each week a half-penny
a family to their policeman, in return for which he left in their
houses every day two large pails of water.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge, they called him; and though he was a modest and
unassuming fellow, he made a point of being deaf to any remark or
request that was not prefaced by this title. He resented even "Mr."
Lodge; but he was excited to an indignant glance at the offensive
familiarity of plain "Lodge."</p>

<p>He was a small old man, of a gentle and feminine disposition; but
he had "served his time" on a man-of-war, and had been pensioned for
some active service in certain vague Chinese bombardments. It was
queerly inconsistent to hear the old fellow relate wild stories of
carnage, with a woman's voice and a timid maiden air.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wyville approached Officer Lodge, that guardian of the
peace was laboriously trying to turn the barrel in its bed, so that
he might paint the under side. The weight was too great for the old
man, and he was puzzled. He stood looking at the ponderous cask with
a divided mind.</p>

<p>"Raise it on its end," said Mr. Wyville, who had reached the spot
unseen by the aquarian policeman.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge looked at him in distrust, fearing sarcasm in the
remark; but he met the grave impressive look, and was mollified.
Besides, the advice struck him as being practical. Without a word, he
easily heaved the cask into an upright position, and found that he
could paint its whole circumference. This put him in good humour.</p>

<p>"If that were my barrel, I should paint the hoops red instead of
green," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Officer Lodge, dipping his brush in the green
paint.</p>

<p>"Because red lead preserves iron, while the verdigris used to
colour green paint corrodes it."</p>

<p>Officer Lodge wiped his brush on the rim of the paint-pot, and
looked at Mr. Wyville timidly, but pleasantly.</p>

<p>"You know things, you do," he said. "But suppose you hadn't no red
paint?"</p>

<p>"I should paint the whole barrel white--white lead preserves
iron--and then give the hoops a smart coat of black. That would make
a handsome barrel."</p>

<p>"I should think so! By jewkins! wouldn't it so?" said Officer
Lodge.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville stood on the road talking with the old man, until that
personage had quite decided to paint the barrel white.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend," said Mr. Wyville, "could you direct me to the
office of the police inspector of this village?"</p>

<p>Officer Lodge was rather taken aback. He was in his shirtsleeves,
like a common labourer, and here was a gentleman, evidently a
foreigner, in search of the police inspector; he was gratified at the
important title. He took his coat from the cart, and slipped it on,
obtruding its brass buttons on the stranger.</p>

<p>"There ain't exac'ly a hinspector in Walton," he said, with an air
of careless pomp; "but I'm the police, at your service, sir."</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said Mr. Wyville, gravely; "I wish to make some
inquiries about a case of murder that occurred in this village some
years ago. Can you assist me?"</p>

<p>"There was only one such a case, sir," said Officer Lodge, the
kindliness of his feminine heart speaking in his saddened tone, "I
know all about it. It was me as arrested her; and it was unwilling
work on my side. But a hofficer must do his duty, sir."</p>

<p>"Can we not sit down somewhere, and talk it over?" asked Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>"At the inn, sir, certingly," replied Officer Lodge, "and a good
glass a' hale you can 'ave, too, sir."</p>

<p>They were soon seated in a quiet little room, and each had his
"glass a' hale" before him.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge told the story like a man who had often told it
before: all the angles were rounded, and the dramatic points brought
out with melodramatic emphasis. Mr. Wyville let him run on till he
had no more to say.</p>

<p>"And this strange woman, who came to the village on the morning of
the murder," he said, when he had heard all; "this woman who was
Draper's first wife--has she ever been heard of since?"</p>

<p>"O, Harriet Draper, bless you, yessir." said Officer Lodge she
comes back periodical, and gets into quod--parding me, sir, I mean
into jail."</p>

<p>"What does she do?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a bad 'un. We don't know where she comes from, nor
where she goes to. She drinks 'cavy, and then she goes down there
near Draper's 'ouse, and the other 'ouse, an' she kicks up a muss of
crying and shouting. She does it periodical; and we has to lock her
up."</p>

<p>"When was she here last?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge pulled out a leather-covered pass-book, and examined
it.</p>

<p>"She's out of her reg'lar border, this time," he said; "she
'aven't been 'ere for a year. But I heerd of her later than that in
the penitentiary at Liverpool."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville asked no more questions. He wrote an address on a
card, and handed it to Officer Lodge.</p>

<p>"If this woman return here," he said, "or if you find out where
she is, write to that address, and you shall be well rewarded."</p>

<p>"Head Office of Police, Scotland Yard, London," read Officer Lodge
from the card. "Yessir, I'll do it. Oh no, none of that," he said,
firmly, putting back some offering in Mr. Wyville's hand; "I'm in
your debt, sir; I was a'most going to make a fool of myself with that
bar'l. I'm obliged to you, sir, and I'll do this all the better for
remembering of your kindness."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville took a friendly leave of good-natured Officer Lodge,
and returned to Liverpool by the next train. Arrived there, he did
not proceed straight to his hotel, but drove to the city
penitentiary, where he repeated his inquiries about Harriet Draper;
but he only learned that she had been discharged eight months
before.</p>

<p>Neither police nor prison books could give him further
information. Disappointed and saddened, next day he returned to
London.</p>

<h2>MR. HAGGETT.</h2>

<p>SISTER CECILIA visited Alice Walmsley every day for several weeks,
until the happy change in the latter's life had grown out of its
strangeness. Their intercourse had become a close and silent
communion.</p>

<p>For the first month or so the kind and wise little nun had
conversed on anything that chanced for a topic; but afterwards they
developed the silent system--and it was the better of the two.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia used to enter with a cheery smile, which Alice
returned. Then Sister Cecilia would throw crumbs on the sill for the
sparrows, Alice watching her, still smiling. Then the little Sister
would seat herself on the pallet and take out her rosary, and
smilingly shake her finger at Alice, as if to say--</p>

<p>"Now, Alice, be a good girl, and don't disturb me."</p>

<p>And Alice, made happy by the sweet companionship, would settle to
her sewing, hearing the birds twitter and chirp, and seeing the
golden sunlight pour through the bars into her cell.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia had a great many prayers to say every day, and she
made a rule of saying the whole of them in Alice's cell.</p>

<p>The change in Alice's life became known to all the officials in
the prison, and a general interest was awakened in the visits of the
good Sister, to her cell. From the governor down to the lowest female
warder, the incident was a source of pleasure, and a subject of
everyday comment.</p>

<p>But there was one official who beheld all this with displeasure
and daily increasing distrust. This was Mr. Haggett, the
Scripture-reader of the prison.</p>

<p>Into the hands of Mr. Haggett had been given the spiritual welfare
of all the convicts in Millbank of every creed Christian, Turk, and
Jew.</p>

<p>It was a heavy responsibility; but Mr. Haggett felt himself equal
to the task. It would be wrong to lay blame for the choice of such a
teacher on any particular creed. He had been selected and appointed
by Sir Joshua Hobb, whose special views of religious influence he was
to carry out. Mr. Haggett was a tall man, with a highly respectable
air. He had whiskers brushed outward till they stood from his lank
cheeks like paint-brushes; and he wore a long square-cut brown coat.
He had an air of formal superiority. His voice was cavernous and
sonorous. If he only said "Good-morning" he said it with a
patronizing smile, as if conscious of a superior moral nature; and
his voice sounded solemnly deep.</p>

<p>One would have known him in the street as a man of immense
religious weight and godly assumption, by the very compression of his
lips. These were his strong features, even more forcible than the
rigid respectability of his whiskers, or the grave sanctity of his
voice. His lips were not exactly coarse or thick; they were large,
even to bagginess. His mouth was wide, and his teeth were long; but
there was enough lip to cover up the whole, and still more enough
left to fold afterwards into consciously pious lines around the
mouth.</p>

<p>When Mr. Haggett was praying, he closed his eyes, and in a
solemnly sonorous key began a personal interview with the Almighty.
While he was informing God, with many deep "Thou knowests," his lips
were in full play; every reef was shaken out, so to speak. But when
Mr. Haggett was instructing a prisoner, he moved only the smallest
portion of labial tissue that could serve to impress the unfortunate
with his own unworthiness and Mr. Haggett's exalted virtue and
importance.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett visited the cells for four hours every day, taking
regular rounds, and prayed with and instructed the prisoners. He
never sympathized with them nor pretended to, and, of course, he
never had their confidence--except the sham confidence and contrition
of sortie second-timers, who wanted a recommendation for a
pardon.</p>

<p>There was another official who made regular rounds, with about the
same intervals of time as Mr. Haggett. This was [...] the searcher
and fumigator--a warder who searched the cells for concealed
implements, and fumigated with some chemical the crevices and joints
to keep them wholesomely clean. When a prisoner had a visit from the
searcher and fumigator, he knew that Mr. Haggett would be around
soon.</p>

<p>The sense of duty in the two officials was very much alike under
the surface; and it would have saved expense and time had Mr. Haggett
carried, besides his Bible, the little bellows and probe of the
fumigator--if he had been, in fact, the searcher and fumigator of
both cells and souls.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett had observed, with horror, the visits of the Popish
nun to the cell of a prisoner whom he knew to be a Protestant. Though
he never had had anything to say to Number Four, and never had prayed
with her for five years, he now deemed her one of those specially
confided to his care. He was shocked to the centre when first he saw
the white-capped nun sitting in the cell, with a rosary in her
hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett would have complained at once, but he did not like the
governor. He had been insulted--he felt he had--by the governor, who
never met him but be asked the same impertinent question: "Well, Mr.
Haggett, got your regular commission in the ministry yet?"</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett was in hopes of becoming, some day, a regular minister
of the Established Church. He was "studying for it," he said; and his
long experience in the prison would tell in his favour. But the years
had flown, and he had not secured the reverend title he so ardently
coveted. The Lords Bishops were not favourably impressed by Mr.
Haggett's acquirements or qualities.</p>

<p>The daily presence of the nun in one of his cells goaded him to
desperation. He stopped one day at the door of Number Four, and, in
his deepest chest-tones, with a smile that drew heavily on the labial
reefs, addressed the Sister--</p>

<p>"Is this prisoner a Rom--ah--one of your persuasion, madam?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the little Sister, with a kind smile at Alice; "I
wish she were."</p>

<p>"Hah !--Why, madam, do you visit a prisoner who is not of your
persuasion?"</p>

<p>"Because no one else visited her," said Sister Cecilia, looking at
Mr. Haggett with rather a startled air, "and she needed someone."</p>

<p>"Madam, I wish to pray with this prisoner this morning, and
ah-ah-I will thank you to leave this cell."</p>

<p>The work dropped from Alice's hands, and a wild look came into her
eyes. First, she stared at Mr. Haggett, as if she did not understand.
From his uninviting face, now flushed somewhat, and working as if the
godly man were in a passion, she turned, with a mute appeal, to
Sister Cecilia.</p>

<p>The nun had risen, startled, but not confused, at the unexpected
harshness of the tone, rather than the words. She realized at once
that Mr. Haggett, who had never before addressed her, nor noticed her
presence, had power to expel her from Alice's cell, and forbid her
entrance in future.</p>

<p>She determined on the moment to make an effort for Alice's
sake.</p>

<p>"This prisoner is to be my hospital assistant on the convict
ship," said Sister Cecilia to Mr. Haggett.</p>

<p>"Madam!" said Mr. Haggett, harshly, and there was a movement of
his foot as if he would have stamped his order; "I wish to pray with
this prisoner!"</p>

<p>He motioned commandingly with his hand, ordering the nun from the
cell.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia took a step towards the door, rather alarmed at the
man's violence, but filled with keen sorrow for poor Alice.</p>

<p>The rude finger of the angry Scripture-reader still pointed from
the cell. Sister Cecilia had taken one step outward, when Alice
Walmsley darted past her, and stood facing Mr. Haggett, her left hand
reached behind her with spread fingers, as if forbidding the nun, to
depart.</p>

<p>"Begone!" she cried to Haggett, "How dare you come here? I do not
want your prayers."</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett grew livid with passion at this insult from a
prisoner. He had, perhaps, cherished a secret dislike of Alice for
her old rebellion against his influence. He glared at her a moment in
silent fury, while his great lips curved into their tightest reefs,
showing the full line of his long teeth.</p>

<p>But he did not answer her. He looked over her, into the cell,
where Sister Cecilia stood affrighted. He reached his long arm
towards her, and still commanded her from the cell, with a hand
trembling with wrath. He would settle with the recalcitrant convict
when this strange ally and witness had departed.</p>

<p>"Come out!" motioned the lips of the wrathful Scripture reader,
while his long finger crooked, as if it were a hook to draw her
forth.</p>

<p>At this moment, a key rattled in the door at the end of the
corridor, and there entered the passage Sir Joshua Hobb, Mr. Wyville,
and the governor, followed by the two warders of the pentagon. The
gentlemen were evidently on a tour of inspection. When they had come
to the cell of Number Four, they stood in astonishment at the
scene.</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley, hitherto so submissive and silent, was aroused
into feverish excitement. She stood facing Mr. Haggett, and, as the
others approached, she turned to them wildly.</p>

<p>"How dare this man interfere with me?" she cried. "I will not
allow him to come near me. I will not have his prayers. I--"</p>

<p>"Be calm, child!" said Mr. Wyville, whom she had never before
seen. His impressive and kind face and tone instantly affected the
prisoner. Her hands fell to her sides.</p>

<p>"Lock that cell." said Sir Joshua Hobb, in a hard, quick voice.
"This prisoner must be brought to her senses."</p>

<p>Alice was again defiant in an instant.</p>

<p>"Tell this man to begone!" she excitedly demanded.</p>

<p>"Come out!" hissed Mr. Haggett, grimly stretching his neck towards
Sister Cecilia, and still bending his lean finger like a hook.</p>

<p>"She shall not go out!" cried Alice, in a frenzy.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if they were tearing something dearer than
life from her. She dashed the hooked hand of the Biblereader aside,
bruising it against the iron door.</p>

<p>"Warders!" shouted Sir Joshua Hobb, "take this woman to the
refractory cells. She shall remain in the dark till she obeys the
rules. Take her away!"</p>

<p>The warders approached Alice, who now stood in the doorway. She
had turned her agonized face as she felt Sister Cecilia's hand laid
upon her shoulder, and her breast heaved convulsively.</p>

<p>As the warders seized her arms, she started with pitiful alarm,
and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried a deep voice, resonant with command. Mr. Wyville had
spoken.</p>

<p>"Release the prisoner!"</p>

<p>Every eye was turned on him. Even Alice's excitement was subdued
by the power of the strange interruption. The Scripture-reader was
the first to come to words. He addressed the governor.</p>

<p>"Who is this, who countermands the order of the Chief
Director?"</p>

<p>Before the governor could answer, Sir Joshua Hobb spoke.</p>

<p>"This is insolence, sir! My order shall be obeyed."</p>

<p>"It shall not," said Mr. Wyville, calmly, and walking to the cell
door.</p>

<p>"By what authority do you dare interfere?" demanded Sir Joshua
Hobb.</p>

<p>"By this!" said Mr. Wyville, handing him a paper.</p>

<p>The enraged Chief Director took the document, and glanced at the
signature.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he shouted. "This Ministry is dead. This is waste paper.
Out of the way, sir!"</p>

<p>"Stay!" said Mr. Wyville, taking from his breast a small case,
from which he drew a folded paper, like a piece of vellum, which he
handed to the governor of the prison.</p>

<p>"This, then, is my authority."</p>

<p>The prompt old major took the paper, read it, and then, still
holding it before him, raised his hat as if in military salute.</p>

<p>"Your authority is the first, sir," he said, decisively and
respectfully, to Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"I demand to see that paper!" cried the Chief Director.</p>

<p>The governor handed it to him, and he read it through, his rage
rapidly changing into a stare of blank amazement and dismay.</p>

<p>"I beg, you to forgive me, sir," he said at length in a low tone.
"It would have been for the benefit of discipline, however, had I
known of this before."</p>

<p>"That is true, sir," answered Mr. Wyville, "and had there been
time for explanation, you should have known my right before I had
used it."</p>

<p>"You have shaken my official authority, sir," said Sir Joshua,
still expostulatory.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," answered Mr. Wyville; "but another moment's
delay and this prisoner might have been driven to madness. Authority
must not forget humanity."</p>

<p>"Authority is paramount, sir," humbly responded Sir Joshua,
handing the potent paper to Mr. Wyville; "allow me to take my
leave."</p>

<p>The humiliated Chief Director walked quickly from the
corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville turned to the cell, and met the brimming eyes of the
prisoner, the eloquent gratitude of the look touching him to the
heart. He smiled with ineffable kindness, and with an almost
imperceptible motion of the hand requested Sister Cecilia to remain
and give comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett still remained in the entry, hungrily watching the
cell. Mr. Wyville passed in front of the door, and turning, looked
straight in his face. The discomfited Scripture reader started as if
he had received an electric shock. He was dismayed at the power of
this strange man.</p>

<p>"You have passed this door with your prayers for five years, sir,"
said Mr. Wyville; "you will please to continue your inattention."</p>

<p>"The prisoner is not a Roman--" Haggett began, with shaken
tones.</p>

<p>The hand of the soldierly old governor fell sharply, twice, on his
shoulder. He looked round. The governor's finger was pointed straight
down the passage, and his eye sternly ordered Mr. Haggett in the same
direction. He hitched the sacred volume under his arm, and without a
sound followed the footsteps of Sir Joshua.</p>

<p>His eager eyes had been denied a sight of the mysterious document;
but his heart, or other organs, infallibly told him that he and his
chief were routed beyond hope of recovery.</p>

<h2>TWO HEADS AGAINST ONE.</h2>

<p>SIR JOSHUA HOBB sat in his Department Office in Parliament street,
with every sign of perplexity and rage in his face and attitude. His
contest of authority with the unknown and mysterious man had fairly
crushed him. In the face of the officials whom he had trained to
regard his word as the utterance of Power itself, never to be
questioned nor disobeyed, he had been challenged, commanded,
degraded. It was a bitter draught; and what if he had only taken the
first sickening mouthful?</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his morose reflections by the entrance of
Mr. Haggett, whose air was almost as dejected as his superior's.</p>

<p>Haggett stood silently at the door, looking at the great man,
somewhat as a spaniel might look at its master. The spare curtain of
his lip was folded into leathery wrinkles round his capacious
mouth.</p>

<p>"Haggett," said Sir Joshua, turning wearily to the fire, "who the
devil is this man?"</p>

<p>"He's a rich Australian--" began Haggett, in a confidential
voice.</p>

<p>"Ass!" said the Chief Director, without looking at him.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett, returning not even a glance of resentment, accepted
the correction, and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Haggett," said Sir Joshua, after a pause, during which he had
stared into the fire, when does the convict ship sail?"</p>

<p>"In two weeks, sir."</p>

<p>"I want you to go to West Australia on that ship, Haggett."</p>

<p>"I, Sir Joshua? Leave London? I shall be ordained this year. I
shall--"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I want you, man. No one else will do. You can attend to
private matters on your return. I shall personally assist you with my
influence."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Joshua?"</p>

<p>"No one else can do it, Haggett."</p>

<p>"What is to be done, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want to know all that is to be known in West Australia about
this Wyville."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect anything, sir?" asked Mr. Haggett.</p>

<p>"No; I have no reason either for suspicion or belief. I know
absolutely nothing about the man, nor can I find any one who
does."</p>

<p>"And yet that commission--"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was a disappointment. In one or two cases I have heard
of the same high influence, given in the same secret manner."</p>

<p>"Were the other holders mysterious, too?" asked Haggett,
reflectively, folding and unfolding his facial hangings.</p>

<p>"They were all cases in which philanthropists might meet with
opposition from officials; and this strange but unquestionable power
was given as a kind of private commission."</p>

<p>"It strikes down all the rules--"</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes," interrupted Sir Joshua, striking the coal with the
tongs; "but there it is. It must be acknowledged without
question."</p>

<p>"Have you no clue to the reason for which this special authority
was given to him?" asked Haggett.</p>

<p>"I have not thought of it; but I am not surprised. This man, as
you know, has reformed the Indian Penal System at the Andaman
Islands, expending immense sums of his own money to carry out the
change. Afterwards, he was received by the French Emperor as an
authority on the treatment of crime, and had much to do with their
new transportation scheme. A man with this record, accepted by the
Prime Minister, was just the person to be specially commissioned by
the Queen."</p>

<p>"He is young to be so very wealthy," mused Haggett.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is mysterious; no one knows the source of his wealth.
This is your mission: find out all about him, and report to me by
mail within six months."</p>

<p>"Then I am really to go to Australia?" said Haggett, with a
doleful aspect.</p>

<p>"Yes, Haggett; there's no other way. Inquiry into mysterious men's
lives is always worth the trouble. You may learn nothing, but--it had
better be done."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Joshua, I want a favour from you in return."</p>

<p>"What is it? You shall have it, if it he in my power."</p>

<p>"Send that prisoner, Number Four, on the ship; but countermand the
order for the Papist nun."</p>

<p>"You want the nun to remain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; they ought to be separated. This Wyville takes a great
interest in Number Four. It was he that sent the nun to her."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Haggett; it shall be done. Stay, let me write the
order now."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir Joshua," said Haggett, rubbing his hands. "There,
take that to the Governor of Millbank. Number Four shall be sent with
the first batch to the ship. The nun is to remain."</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett departed, and as he walked down Parliament street,
glancing furtively around to see that he was unobserved, he smiled to
the uttermost reef.</p>

<h2>FEMALE TRANSPORTS.</h2>

<p>THE morning arrived for the convict ship to sail, and the last
chains of male prisoners were mustered in the prison yard of
Millbank, ready to be marched to the train, for embarkation on the
convict ship at Portland.</p>

<p>In one of the Pentagonal yards stood the female prisoners, fifty
in number. They whispered covertly to each other, enjoying for the
first time for years the words that were not orders, and the faces
that were not cold.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"How long have you served?"</p>

<p>"What nice hair you have!"</p>

<p>"Will they cut off our hair again in Australia?"</p>

<p>"Were you lagged before?"</p>

<p>"That one there, with the red mark on her cheek, was sentenced to
be hung."</p>

<p>"This is my second time."</p>

<p>These were the words that might be heard in the ranks--short
sentences, full of direct meaning, such as are always spoken when
formality is absent, and curiosity is excited.</p>

<p>The male chains having been inspected by the governor, who was
accompanied by Mr. Wyville, had marched from the prison to the
railway station.</p>

<p>Four great waggons or tumbrils rolled into the yard, to carry away
the female convicts. Before they entered the waggons, the governor
addressed the women, telling them that their good conduct in prison
had earned this change; that their life in the new country to which
they were going would be one of opportunity; that their past was all
behind them, and a fair field before them to work out honest and
happy lives.</p>

<p>Many of the prisoners sobbed bitterly as the kind governor spoke.
Hope, indeed, was bright before them; but they were parting from all
that they had ever loved; they would never more see the face of
father or mother, brother or sister; they would never more see an
English field or an English flower. Their lives had been shattered
and shameful; but the moment of parting from every association of
youth was the more embittered, perhaps, by the thought of their
unworthiness.</p>

<p>When the governor had spoken, they entered the tumbrils, and the
guards fell in. The old governor raised his hat. He was deeply
affected at the scene, common though it must have been to him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and God bless you all in your new life!" he said.</p>

<p>The driver of the front tumbril looked round, to see that all was
ready before starting his horses.</p>

<p>"Wait," said a tall man, who was rapidly and eagerly scanning the
faces of the women, as he passed from waggon to waggon; "there's a
mistake here."</p>

<p>"What is the matter there?" shouted the governor.</p>

<p>"There is one prisoner absent, Sir," said the tall man, who was
Mr. Haggett; "one prisoner absent who was ordered for this ship."</p>

<p>"What prisoner?" asked the governor.</p>

<p>"Number Four."</p>

<p>"Start up your horses," shouted the governor; and the first
tumbril lumbered out of the yard.</p>

<p>The governor was looking at Mr. Haggett, who stood beside the last
waggon, his face a study of rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>"That prisoner was specially ordered for this ship," he repeated.
"Sir Joshua Hobb wrote the order with his own hand."</p>

<p>"He has countermanded it," said the governor, curtly.</p>

<p>"When?" asked Haggett.</p>

<p>"Two hours ago," said the governor. "The prisoner will remain in
Millbank."</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett looked his baffled malevolence at the governor, who
paid no heed to the glance. Mr. Wyville stood close to him; but
Haggett never met his eye during the scene. As he departed, however,
in passing him, he raised his eyes for an instant to Mr. Wyville's
face and said--</p>

<p>"I am going to West Australia. I shall soon return."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville's face might have been of marble, so absolutely
unconscious did he seem of the presence or words of Haggett.</p>

<p>The tumbrils rolled from the yard with their strange freight, and
Mr. Haggett strode from the prison. He stood on the poop of the
transport as she sailed from Portland that afternoon.</p>

<p>More than once that day did Haggett's words repeat themselves like
a threat in Mr. Wyville's mind; and when all was silent in sleeping
London that night, he arose from the study table at which he wrote,
and paced the room in sombre thought. His mind was reasoning with
itself and at last the happier side conquered. He stopped his
tireless walk, and smiled; but it was a sad smile.</p>

<p>"Poor children!" he murmured; "what would become of them here? I
must instruct Tapairu, and--and then," he said, looking reverently
upward through the night, "Thy will be done."</p>

<h2>AFTER NINE YEARS.</h2>

<p>So the state of Alice Walmsley was not changed by the zeal of Mr.
Haggett, indeed, no change had resulted from it except the increased
hatred of the Chief Director for Mr. Wyville, and the sleuth-dog
errand on which Haggett had sailed for Australia.</p>

<p>Alice did not know nor think of the causes that had kept her from
transportation. One day she was quietly informed by the warder that
the ship had sailed. She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry, for
her own sake; but of late she had not been quite alone in the world.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she clasped her hands before her.</p>

<p>"You are sorry, Number Four," said the warder.</p>

<p>"She was so good--she made me so happy," answered Alice, with
streaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Sister Cecilia."</p>

<p>"She has not gone," said the warder, smiling; "see, she is coming
here. Good day, Sister; somebody was crying for you."</p>

<p>The joy of Alice was unbounded, as she held the serge dress of
Sister Cecilia, and looked in her kind and pleasant face. The change
in Alice's character was more marked in this scene than in any
circumstance since the gleam of the flower had caught her eye in the
cell. The strong will seemed to have departed; the self-reliance,
born of wrong and anguish, had disappeared; she was a simple and
impulsive girl again.</p>

<p>Between the innocent happiness of her young life and the fresh
tenderness now springing in her heart, there lay an awful gulf of
sorrow and despair. But she was on the high bank--she looked across
the gloom and saw the sunny fields beyond, and, as she looked, the
far shore drew nearer to her, and the dismal strait between grew
narrower.</p>

<p>"Alice," said Sister Cecilia, gravely, when the happy greeting was
over, "it is now time that something were done for your release."</p>

<p>The light faded from Alice's face, and after a long look, full of
sadness, at the Sister, she bent her face into her hands, remaining
silent.</p>

<p>"Would you not like to be free, Alice?"</p>

<p>"I am happy here--I do not think of it--why do you ask me?" she
said, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Because it is not right that an innocent person should remain
here. Tell me the whole sad story, child, and let me see what can be
done."</p>

<p>"O, Sister Cecilia, I cannot--I cannot!" sobbed Alice.</p>

<p>"O, do not ask me--do not make me think of my sweet little baby--I
cannot think of it dead--indeed, I cannot speak of that!"</p>

<p>"Alice," said the nun, "your baby is with God, saved from the
stains and sorrows of life. This woman," and the voice of Sister
Cecilia grew almost severe, "this terrible woman--I have heard that
she is a bad and wretched woman, Alice--deserves nothing from you but
justice. God demands justice to ourselves as well as to others."</p>

<p>"I cannot accuse her," answered Alice, in a low voice, gradually
returning to its old firmness. "She has suffered more than I--God
pardon her! And I know that she suffered first."</p>

<p>"Well, poor child," said the nun, deeply affected, "we must ask
for a pardon, then, for you."</p>

<p>Alice arose from her low seat, and stood before the window,
looking upward, with her hands clasped before her--an attitude grown
familiar to her of late.</p>

<p>"My dead mother knows I am innocent of crime," she said slowly, as
if speaking to her own heart; "no one else knows it, though some may
believe it. I cannot be pardoned for a crime I have not committed.
That were to accept the crime. I shall not accuse her, though my own
word should set me free. Do not ask me to speak of it any more,
Sister Cecilia. I shall remain here--and I shall be happier
here."</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia dropped the subject, and never returned to it
again. From that day she treated Alice Walmsley in another manner
than of old. She spoke with her of all the crosses that came in her
path, either to herself or others. By this means the latent
sympathies of Alice were touched and exercised. She entered with
interest into every story of the sorrow or suffering of the
unfortunate, related to her by the kind little Sister.</p>

<p>In this communion, which, if not happy, was at least peaceful, the
months grew into years, and the years followed each other, until four
summers more had passed through Alice's cell.</p>

<p>During those years she had developed her true nature, saddened
though it was by her surroundings. It seemed that her youth had been
too thoughtless, too unstable, too happy, even to indicate her
future. That bright girlhood was the rich fallow ground. The five
dark years of her agony and unbelief were the season of ploughing and
harrowing the fertile soil and sowing the fruitful seed. The four
years of succeeding peace were the springtime and the early summer of
her full life, during which the strong shoots grew forward towards
the harvest of ripe womanhood.</p>

<p>Towards the end of these four years a word of change came to her
cell--she was once more selected among the fifty female prisoners to
be sent on the annual convict ship to west Australia.</p>

<p>It was during the preparation for this voyage that Will Sheridan
returned, a rich man, to find the shattered pieces of his love and
happiness. It was during one of these quiet days within Alice's cell
that he without had wandered through London, a heart-stricken man,
vainly seeking for interest in the picture galleries and churches. It
was during one of these peaceful nights within the cell that he,
without, led by the magnetism of strong love, found himself beneath
the gloomy walls of Millbank, round which he wandered through the
night, and which he could not leave until he had pressed his feverish
lips against the icy stone of the prison.</p>

<p>On the day when William Sheridan at last stood before the door of
Alice Walmsley's cell, and read her beloved name on the card, she sat
within, patiently sewing the coarse cloth of her transport dress.
When the door opened, and his yearning sight was blessed with that
which it had longed for, she stood before him, calm and white and
beautiful, with downcast eyes, according to her own modesty and the
prison discipline.</p>

<p>When he passed her door a few weeks later, and saw within the
sweet-faced Sister Cecilia, and heard, after so many years, the voice
of her he loved, in one short sentence, which sent him away very
happy, she dreamt not that a loving heart had drunk up her words as a
parched field drinks the refreshing rain.</p>

<p>So strong and so futile are the outreachings of the soul. They
must be mutual, or they are impotent and vain. Reciprocal, they draw
together through the density of a planet. Single, the one reaches for
the other weakly, as a shadow touches the precipice, hopelessly as
death.</p>

<p>That which we desire, we may feel; but that which we neither know
nor think, might just as well be non-existent.</p>

<h1>BOOK FOUR<br>THE CONVICT SHIP.</h1>

<h2>THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.</h2>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan is to go before the Committee to-day, is he not?"
asked Lord Somers, the Colonial Secretary, as he sat writing in Mr.
Wyville's study, with Sheridan reading the Times by the window, and
Hamerton lounging in an easy-chair.</p>

<p>"What Committee?" asked Hamerton, heedlessly.</p>

<p>"The Committee appointed to hear Sir Joshua Hobb's argument
against our Penal Bill," said the Secretary, as he continued to
write.</p>

<p>"Does Sheridan know anything about prisons?" drawled Hamerton.</p>

<p>"He knows something about Australia and the men we send there,"
said the Secretary.</p>

<p>"Well--Hobb doesn't. Hobb is a humbug. What does he want?"</p>

<p>"To control the Australian Penal System from Parliament Street,
and, instead of Mr. Wyville's humane bill, to apply his own system to
the penal colony."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Mr. Sheridan?" asked Hamerton, without
raising his head from the cushion.</p>

<p>That it would be folly before Mr. Wyville's bill was drawn--and
criminal afterwards."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said Hamerton, sitting straight; "bravo, Australia! Go
before the Committee, by all means, and talk just in that tone. When
do they sit?"</p>

<p>"In an hour," said Lord Somers. "We are only waiting for Mr.
Wyville, and then we go to the House."</p>

<p>"May I go?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Secretary. "You may get a chapter for a
novel, or a leader for the Telegraph."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville soon after entered, and the merits of the opposing
bills were freely discussed for a quarter of an hour. At length Lord
Somers said it was time to start, and they proceeded on foot towards
the Parliament House, Lord Somers and Hamerton leading, and Mr.
Wyville and Sheridan following.</p>

<p>On the way Mr. Wyville led his companion to speak of the
sandalwood trade, and seemed to be much interested in its details. At
one point he interrupted Sheridan, who was describing the precipitous
outer ridge of the Iron-stone Hills.</p>

<p>"Your teams have to follow the winding foot of this precipice for
many miles, have they not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For thirty-two miles," answered Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Which, of course, adds much to the expense of shipping the
sandalwood?"</p>

<p>"Adds very seriously, indeed, for the best sandalwood lies back
within the bend; so that our teams, having turned the farther flank
of the hills, must return and proceed nearly thirty miles back
towards the shore."</p>

<p>"Suppose it were possible to throw a chain slide from the brow of
the Blackwood Head, near Bunbury, to a point on the plain--what would
that save?"</p>

<p>"Just fifty miles of teaming," answered Sheridan, looking at
Wyville in surprise. "But such a chain--could never be forged."</p>

<p>"The Americans have made slides for wood nearly as long," said Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>Five ships could not carry enough chain from England for such a
slide."</p>

<p>"Forge it on the spot," said Mr. Wyville. "The very hills can be
smelted into metal. I have had this in mind for some years, Mr.
Sheridan, and I mean to attempt the work when we return. It will
employ all the idle men in the colony."</p>

<p>Sheridan was surprised beyond words to find Mr. Wyville so
familiar with the very scenes of his own labour. He hardly knew what
to say about Wyville's personal interest in a district which the
Sandalwood Company had marked off and claimed as their property by
right of possession, though they had neglected Sheridan's advice to
buy or lease the land from the Government.</p>

<p>The conversation ceased as they entered the House of Commons, and
proceeded to the committee room, where sat Sir Joshua Hobb at a
table, turning over a pile of documents, and beside him, pen in hand,
Mr. Haggett, who took in a reef of lip as Mr. Wyville and Sheridan
entered.</p>

<p>Since Haggett's return from Australia, three years before, he had
adopted a peculiar manner towards Mr. Wyville. He treated him with
respect, perhaps because he feared him; but when he could observe him
without himself being seen, be never tired of looking at him, as if
he were intently solving a problem, and hoped to read its deepest
meaning in some possible expression of Mr. Wyville's face.</p>

<p>On the large table lay a map of the penal colony of West
Australia.</p>

<p>The Committee consisted of five average M.P.'s, three country
gentlemen, who had not the remotest knowledge of penal systems, nor
of any other than systems of drainage; and two lawyers, who asked all
the questions, and pretended to understand the whole subject.</p>

<p>The Committee treated Sir Joshua Hobb, K.C.B., as a most
distinguished personage, whose every word possessed particular
gravity and value. He delivered a set speech against lenience to
prisoners, and made a deep impression on the Committee. He was about
to sit down, when Mr. Haggett laid a folded paper beside his hand.
Sir Joshua glanced at the document, and resumed, in a convincing
tone--</p>

<p>"Here, gentlemen," he said, touching the paper repeatedly with his
finger, "here is an instance of the sentimental method, and its
effect on a desperate criminal--and all those who are sent to
Australia are desperate. Twenty years ago, a young man was convicted
at York Assizes, for poaching. It was during a time of business
depression; the capitalists and employers had closed their works, and
locked out their hands. Nothing else could be done--men cannot risk
their money when markets are falling. During this time, the deer in
Lord Scarborough's park had been killed by the score, and a close
watch was set. This man was caught in the night, carrying a deer on
his shoulders from the park. He made a violent resistance, striking
one of the keepers a terrible blow that felled him to the earth,
senseless. The poacher was overpowered, however, and sent to prison
until the Assizes. At his trial he pleaded defiantly that he had a
right to the deer; that thousands were starving to death--men, women,
and children--in the streets of the town; and that God had given no
man the right to herd hundreds of useless deer while human beings
were dying of hunger. The ignorant and dangerous people who heard him
cheered wildly in the court at this lawless speech. Gentlemen, this
poacher was a desperate radical--a Chartist, no doubt--who ought to
have been severely treated. But the judge looked leniently on the
case, because it was proved that the poacher's own mother and sisters
were starving. The prisoner got off with one month's imprisonment.
What was the result of this mildness? At the very next Assizes the
same judge tried the same prisoner for a similar crime, and the
audacious villain made the same defence.</p>

<p>"If it were a light crime six months ago," he said to the mistaken
judge, "it is no heavier now, for the cause remains."</p>

<p>Well, he was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude, and was
transported to West Australia. After serving some years there, the
lenient system again came in, and he was hired out to a settler, a
respectable man, though an ex-convict. Some time afterwards, the
violent Chartist attempted to murder his employer, and then escaped
into the bush. He was captured, but escaped again, and was again
re-captured by the very man he had tried to murder. Mark the dreadful
ending, gentlemen, to this series of mistaken lenities to a criminal.
On their way to the prison, the absconder broke his manacles, seized
a pistol from a native policeman, murdered his brave captor, and
escaped again to the bush."</p>

<p>"God bless me! what a shocking story!" said one of the
Committee.</p>

<p>"Was the fellow captured again?" asked one of the lawyers.</p>

<p>"No," said Sir Joshua; "he escaped to the swamps. But there is a
rumour among the convicts that he is still alive. Is there not, Mr.
Haggett?"</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett bent his head in assent. Then he rubbed his forehead
and eyes, as if relieved of a strain. He had been watching the face
of Mr. Wyville with painful eagerness as Sir Joshua spoke; but in
that impassive visage no line of meaning to Haggett's eyes could be
traced.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua sat down, confident that he could depend on the
Committee for a report in his favour.</p>

<p>"Is there actual evidence that this convict of whom you spoke
murdered his captor?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville addressed Sir Joshua Hobb, standing at the end of the
long green table. There was nothing in the words, but every one in
the room felt a thrill at the deep sound of the resonant voice.</p>

<p>The Committee, who had not looked at Mr. Wyville before, stared at
him now in undisguised surprise. He was strangely powerful as he
stood there alone, looking calmly at Sir Joshua for an answer.</p>

<p>"Evidence? Certainly, there is evidence. The brave settler who
captured the malefactor disappeared; and the bushman from whom the
convict seized the pistol saw him point it at the head of his captor.
Is not that evidence enough?"</p>

<p>"Not for a court of justice," quietly answered Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Sir Joshua Hobb, superciliously, "it may not appeal to
sentimental judgments; but it carries conviction to reasonable
minds."</p>

<p>"It should not--for it is not true!" said Mr. Wyville, his tone
somewhat deepened with earnestness.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Hobb started angrily to his feet. He glared at Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>"Do you know it to be false?" he sternly asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I, myself, saw the death of this man that you say was
murdered."</p>

<p>"You saw his death!" said in one breath Sir Joshua and the
Committee.</p>

<p>"Yes. He accepted a bribe from the man he had captured, and
released him. I saw this settler afterwards die of thirst on the
plains--I came upon him by accident--he died before my eyes,
alone--and he was not murdered."</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Hobb sat down, and twisted nervously on his seat. Mr.
Haggett looked frightened, as if he had introduced an unfortunate
subject for his master's use. He wrote on a slip of paper, and handed
it to Sir Joshua, who read, and then turned to Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"What was the name of the man you saw die?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Isaac Bowman," answered Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Both Sir Joshua and Mr. Haggett settled down in their seats,
having no more to say or suggest.</p>

<p>"You have lived a long time in West Australia, Mr. Wyville?" asked
one of the lawyers of the Committee, after a surprised pause.</p>

<p>"Many years."</p>

<p>"You are the owner of property in the colony?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Hobb pricked up his ears, and turned sharply on his
chair, with an insolent stare.</p>

<p>"Where does your property lie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the Vasse district," answered Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Here is a map of West Australia," said Sir Joshua Hobb, with an
overbearing air; "will you be kind enough to point out to the
Committee the location of your possessions?"</p>

<p>There was obviously so malevolent a meaning in Sir Joshua Hobb's
request, that the whole Committee and the gentlemen present stood up
to watch the map, expecting Mr. Wyville to approach. But he did not
move.</p>

<p>"My boundaries are easily traced," he said, from his place at the
end of the table; "the northern and southern limits are the 33rd and
the 34th parallels of latitude, and the eastern and western
boundaries are the 115th and 116th of longitude."</p>

<p>One of the Committee followed with his finger the amazing outline,
after Mr. Wyville had spoken. There was deep silence for a time,
followed by long breaths of surprise.</p>

<p>"All the land within those lines is your--estate?" diffidently
asked one of the country gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville gravely bowed.</p>

<p>"Estate!" said one of the lawyers in a low tone, when he had
summed up the extent in square miles; "it is a Principality!"</p>

<p>"From whom did you purchase this land?" asked Sir Joshua, but in
an altered tone.</p>

<p>"From the Queen!" said Mr. Wyville, without moving a muscle of his
impressive face.</p>

<p>"Directly from Her Majesty?"</p>

<p>"I received my deeds through the Colonial Office," answered Mr.
Wyville, with a quiet motion of the hand towards Lord Somers.</p>

<p>The Colonial Secretary, seeing the eyes of all present turned upon
him, bowed to the Committee in corroboration.</p>

<p>"The deeds of Mr. Wyville's estate, outlined as he has: stated,
passed through the Colonial Office, directly from Her Majesty the
Queen," said Lord Somers, in a formal manner.</p>

<p>The Committee sat silent for several moments, evidently dazed at
the unexpected issue of their investigations. Mr. Wyville was the
first to speak.</p>

<p>"I ask to have those prison records corrected, and at once, Sir
Joshua Hobb," he said slowly. "It must not stand that the convict of
whom you spoke was a murderer."</p>

<p>"By all means. Have the records corrected immediately," said the
Committee, who began to look askance at Sir Joshua Hobb.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville then addressed the Committee, in favour of the new and
humane penal bill. Whether it was his arguments, or the remembrance
of his princely estate, that worked in his favour, certain it was
that when he had concluded the Committee was unanimously in his
favour.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville," said the chairman, before they adjourned, "we are
of one mind-that the Bill reported by the Government should be
adopted by the House; and we shall so report. Good-day,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Hobb rapidly withdrew, coldly bowing. He was closely
followed by Haggett.</p>

<p>Lord Somers, Hamerton, and Mr. Wyville were speaking together,
while Sheridan, who was attentively studying the map, suddenly
startled the others by an excited exclamation.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Hamerton, "has Sir Joshua dropped a hornet for you,
too?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville, this is terrible," cried Sheridan, strangely moved.
"Those lines of your property cover every acre of our sandalwood
land!"</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" ejaculated Hamerton.</p>

<p>"I thought this land was ours," continued Sheridan, in great
distress of mind. "How long has it been yours?"</p>

<p>"Ten years," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Sheridan sank nerveless into a seat. The strong frame that could
brave and bear the severest strains of labour and care, was subdued
in one instant by this overwhelming discovery.</p>

<p>He had been cutting sandalwood for nine years on this man's land.
Every farthing he had made for his company and himself belonged in
common honesty to another!</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, who was not surprised, but had evidently expected
this moment, walked over to Sheridan, and laid a strong hand on his
shoulder, expressing more kindness and affection in the manly force
and silence of the act than could possibly have been spoken in words.
Sheridan felt the impulse precisely as it was meant.</p>

<p>"The land was yours," Mr. Wyville said, after a pause; "for I had
made no claim. I knew of your work, and I gave you no warning.
According to the law of the colony, and of acted right."</p>

<p>Sheridan's face brightened. To him personally his success had
brought little to covet; but he was sensitive to the core at the
thought of trouble and great loss to the Company, caused under his
supervision.</p>

<p>"We return to Australia together, Mr. Sheridan," said Wyville,
holding out his hand; "and I think, somehow, we shall neither of us
leave it again. The vigour of your past life shall be as nothing to
that which the future shall evoke. Shall we not work together?"</p>

<p>Swift tears of pleasure rushed to Sheridan's eyes at the earnest
and unexpected words; and the look that passed between the two men as
they clasped hands was of brief but beautiful intensity.</p>

<p>"Well, Hamerton?" asked Lord Somers, smiling, as if astonished
beyond further speech.</p>

<p>"Well? What of it? I suppose you call this strange," said
Hamerton.</p>

<p>"You don't?" asked the Secretary.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Hamerton, rising from his chair. "I call it
utter commonplace--for these Australians; the most prosaic set of
events I have yet seen them indulge in. I begin to realize the
meaning of the Antipodes: their common ways are our extraordinary
ones--and they don't seem to have any uncommon ones."</p>

<h2>HARRIET DRAPER.</h2>

<p>FOUR years had passed since Mr. Wyville's visit to Walton-le-Dale;
and he had heard no word of the woman he had then sought.</p>

<p>During this time the case of Alice Walmsley had grown to be a
subject of rare interest to this student of humanity. Scarcely a day
had passed in all that time that he had not devoted some moments to
thinking, on the innocent prisoner, and devising some allowable means
of affording her comfort and pleasure.</p>

<p>Perhaps the secret of his special observance of this case arose
from the fact that beneath the self-imposed suffering he beheld the
golden idea. To him this peaceful and silent adherence to a principle
was a source of constant interest.</p>

<p>In all those years, Alice Walmsley had never heard his name, and
had only once seen his interference. The memory of the strong dark
face that had then interposed to save her, and the look of kind
compassion, were treasured in her heart; but she knew no more than
this. Sister Cecilia, perhaps, would have told her who this powerful
man was; but she shrank from asking, and she never asked.</p>

<p>About a week after the event in the Committee Room, Mr. Wyville,
sitting with Sheridan and Hamerton in his study, received a letter,
brought from Scotland Yard by a policeman.</p>

<p>As usual with the group, when not conversing, Sheridan read, and
Hamerton lounged.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville started from his seat with an exclamation, when he had
read the letter. He rarely betrayed even the slightest excitement;
and Mr. Hamerton would not have been more surprised had a bomb
exploded under the table than he was to see Mr. Wyville thrown off
his balance so unexpectedly and completely. Hamerton, however, had
too profound a respect for his friend to speak his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Thanks, kind and simple heart!" exclaimed Mr. Wyville, holding
the letter before him. "You have been faithful to your word for four
years; and you shall rejoice for it all your life!"</p>

<p>Then, recollecting himself, he smiled in his grave way and
said--</p>

<p>"I have received long-expected news. I have found something I
sought. To-night, I must leave London for a few days; so I must say
good-bye now."</p>

<p>"Are you leaving England, too?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"No; I go only to Lancashire--to a little village called
Walton-le-Dale." He turned to his desk, and was busily arranging his
papers.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Sheridan? You are growing nervous of
late."</p>

<p>"The name of the village took me by surprise, that is all," said
Will. He was going on to say that Walton was his native village; but
the entrance of Lord Somers temporarily changed the subject. Before
it could be resumed, Mr. Wyville had said "Good-bye," and the
gentlemen took their leave.</p>

<p>The letter which Mr. Wyville had received ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Sir,--The woman Harriet Draper, as was Samuel Draper's wife
before he married Alice Walmsley, has been arrested, for a dedly
assawlt on Draper's sister, and is at this present riteing in the
lock-up of Walton-le-Dale.--Your umbel servant,</p>

<p>"Benjamin Lodge, Police Officer."</p>

<p>Accompanied by his black servant, Mr. Wyville left London that
evening; and on the forenoon of the next day he stepped from the
train at Walton-le-Dale, and walked towards the police-station or
lock-up.</p>

<p>It was a small stone building, containing, four rooms, two of
which were Officer Lodge's quarters; the third a court-room, with a
dock or bar, and a raised magistrate desk; and behind this, an
opening room, with barred windows, used as the lock-up.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville pushed the outer door, and stepped at once into the
court-room, which was empty. He was about to withdraw, when a door on
the left opened, and Officer Lodge, quite unchanged in four years,
greeted Mr. Wyville, as if he had seen him only yesterday.</p>

<p>"She was out of horder bad, this time, sir; but I knew she'd turn
up some time."</p>

<p>"Many thanks, my friend," said Mr. Wyville; "I had almost
concluded you had forgotten."</p>

<p>Officer Lodge was a little hurt at this expression of doubt; but
he was quite too mild of temper for resentment.</p>

<p>"Where is the woman?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge pointed to the heavy door of the lock-up, with a
grim shake of the head. He sank his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"She's a bad 'un, she is--worse and worse hevery time. But now
she's done for."</p>

<p>"Done for?"</p>

<p>"Ay, she'll go this time, sir. Seven year at the least. She nearly
killed a woman, and she would have killed her altogether if she'd had
her way a minute longer."</p>

<p>"Tell me the facts," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, she were down near Draper's 'ouse all one day last
week, and she hacted queer. They came for me and told me, and I
looked after her all the hafternoon. But she were doing no harm to
nobody. She only sat on the roadside, looking at Draper's 'ouse.
Towards evening she went into Mrs. Walmsley's old 'ouse, wich is
hopen, and she stayed there an hour. Draper's sister, who was too
curious, maybe, went up to the 'ouse, to see what she were doing; and
then it began. I heerd two voices, one a' screaming and the tother
swearing and when I ran to the spot, I sees Harriet assaulting the
woman, choking her and beating her head against the stones. If I had
been half a minute later, there would have been murder."</p>

<p>"Does the prisoner speak to anyone?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"No; there's no one to speak to her but me; and she never hopens
her lips to me."</p>

<p>"Can I see her, and speak with her?"</p>

<p>"Yessir," said Officer Lodge "but be careful-she's not safe."</p>

<p>Officer Lodge carefully locked the outer door, and then approached
the lock-up. He knocked on the door heavily with the key, as if to
rouse the prisoner. No sound came from within. He turned the key in
the lock, and opened the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville entered the lock-up, which was a room about twelve
feet square, with one window. A wooden bench ran round three sides of
the room, and in the farther comer, upon the bench, was something
like a heap of clothes.</p>

<p>It was the prisoner, who sat upon the bench, her back to the wall,
her knees drawn up, and her face sunk upon them. A tattered shawl
covered her, so that she presented the appearance of a heap of
wretched clothes.</p>

<p>She did not move as the door opened, nor for a minute afterwards.
But as someone had entered, and the door had not been closed, she
became aware of the intrusion. She raised her head, and looked around
on the floor, slowly, till her glance fell on Mr. Wyville's feet.
Then she raised her eyes, till they rested on his face.</p>

<p>She seemed to have been in a sort of daze or waking dream. She did
not take her eyes away, but looked at the strange face before her as
if she were not yet awake.</p>

<p>She was a woeful wreck of womanhood. Her eyes had cavernous
circles around them, and her cheeks were sunken, as if with consuming
disease. Her hair, unkempt, was covered with the old shawl, but its
straggling locks fell across her forehead. As she looked at Mr.
Wyville, some remnant of womanly feeling stirred within her, and she
raised a wasted hand and pressed backward the tangled hair from each
side of her face.</p>

<p>Wretched as she was, and lost, there was something beneath all the
stains that spoke of a face once comely and soft and loveable.</p>

<p>"Harriet Draper!" said Mr. Wyville, with unusual emotion in his
deep voice, and speaking in a subdued tone.</p>

<p>She moved uneasily at the name, and her large eyes grew fearfully
bright.</p>

<p>"Harriet Draper, I have been searching for you many years. May God
pardon the man whose crime sent you here!"</p>

<p>"Ach!" gasped the woman, suddenly burying her face again, as if
she had been stabbed in the breast. Then she started, and sprang to
the floor, and put her hands on her eyes.</p>

<p>"O God! what did he say?" she hoarsely whispered, as if speaking
to herself; "O God! God! to pardon him, and not me!"</p>

<p>She took away her hands, and looked severely for a moment at Mr.
Wyville. He met her gaze with a severity greater than her own.</p>

<p>"Yes; God pardon him, for through him you have been made guilty,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she cried, becoming excited. "Who are you that
pretend to know me? No man made me commit crime. You lie! you lie!
you don't know me--you don't know him!"</p>

<p>Her voice became high with excitement, and her eyes blazed, as
with frenzy.</p>

<p>"Harriet Draper, I know you and I know him--your guilty husband. I
have searched for you for years, to ask you to lighten your soul of
one grievous crime. Before long, you will need repentance; for your
health is broken, and you cannot die with this terrible burden on
your conscience.</p>

<p>"What--what are you talking about?" she cried, still fiercely, but
in a lower tone. "What have I done?"</p>

<p>"You have committed murder."</p>

<p>She looked at him without a word, and increased the pitiful fixity
of her gaze by raising her hands to press her temples, as if to keep
down pain.</p>

<p>"You murdered Alice Walmsley's child!"</p>

<p>Her eyes closed, and she grasped at her breast with both hands,
and tottered backwards, sinking on the bench with a long moan.</p>

<p>"You killed the child, and you saw the innocent mother dragged to
prison for your crime. You have remained silent for nine years, and
destroyed your own life, while she has borne your punishment. You
shall now confess, and save her who has suffered so much to save
you."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha!" screamed the woman, in a laugh so sudden and
hellish, that Mr. Wyville stepped back appalled. He had expected a
different result. Again and again the horrid laugh rang through the
place, till it bad exhausted the strength of the ferocious and most
miserable being who uttered it, and she sank heavily on the
bench.</p>

<p>"Save her!" she cried at length, clenching her hands, and shaking
them over her head. "Ha! ha! save her! Save the false woman that sent
me here! Never! I hate her! She brought her suffering, on herself by
stealing my husband--he was only a fool in her hands!"</p>

<p>She rocked herself to and fro for a time, and then cried
wildly--</p>

<p>"Why should I forgive her? Why should I save her? Am I to bear all
the misery she made? He was my husband, and he loved me, till she
made him false!"</p>

<p>Here she became wildly excited, almost screaming her words.</p>

<p>"If she were free to-day, she would seek him out, and go back to
him. Why should I save her to do that? Begone! I will not! I know
nothing about her. I would rather die than speak a word to save
her!"</p>

<p>A fit of coughing, that almost convulsed the miserable frame, now
seized the woman; and when it had passed she sank back against the
wall, exhausted.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville remained silent; he feared that more excitement might
affect her reason, or her life. He looked down upon the unfortunate
being with profound pity. He had expected a depraved and selfish
nature, shrinking from confession through selfish fear. He saw,
instead, a woman's heart criminal through its own love and truth, and
cruelly unjust through jealousy of its rival.</p>

<p>Darkest and saddest of human sights--the good tortured from its
straight course until it actually had become evil; the angelic
quality in a heart warped by deceit and wrong until it had become the
fiendish part.</p>

<p>"O, man, man!" murmured Mr. Wyville, as he looked upon the wreck,
but only saw the evil-doer beyond her, "your sin is deeper than the
sea. Not here, not here must I seek to right the wrong."</p>

<p>He walked from the place with bowed head. Officer Lodge, without
speaking, locked the door, and followed him. Mr. Wyville sat down in
the court-room, and, after a long pause, said to Officer Lodge--</p>

<p>"Has this man, Draper, ever been here--since the crime was
committed?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he hasn't never been seen; but they say as he has been
here; that he came in the night to his own folks once. He can't never
live in Walton, sir."</p>

<p>"Has he been outlawed?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, there was no one to go again' him. The law let him pass;
but the people couldn't stomach him, though they never thought he was
as bad as this."</p>

<p>"You have heard, then, what I have said to this woman? It will do
no good to speak about it. She has made no confession, nor will she
confess till the hand of death is upon her. When is she to be tried
for this last offence?"</p>

<p>"In two weeks, sir; and she'll get at least seven years."</p>

<p>"Well, my kind friend, remember she has been cruelly wronged; and,
so long as she is in your charge, treat her with mercy. She is not
the author of her crime and wretchedness."</p>

<p>Officer Lodge promised to be kind, though his heart overflowed
when he thought of poor Alice Walmsley and her great wrong. He also
promised to send by mail to Mr. Wyville a report of Harriet Draper's
sentence.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville thanked him, but offered no reward.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again before long," he said, as he left the
little court-room. His journey to London that night was mainly
consumed in reflection on the tangled web of crime and injustice in
which he had become so deeply interested.</p>

<p>Two days later Mr. Wyville sat in the office of the governor of
Millbank, relating to him the story of Harriet Draper and Alice
Walmsley.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried the kind old governor; "the case must be
brought at once before the Directors."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Wyville, "not yet; and not at any time before them.
Release cannot right the wrong of this injured woman. She must be
cleared by the confession of the criminal, and then we shall send her
case to the Queen."</p>

<p>"Well," said the governor, "but how are you to get the
confession?"</p>

<p>"This woman, Harriet Draper, will come to Millbank within two
weeks. If she does not confess before the convict ship sails, she
must be sent to West Australia next month."</p>

<p>"We never send convicts in their first year," said the
governor.</p>

<p>"She must go," said Mr. Wyville, warmly; "break your rule for the
sake of justice."</p>

<p>"I'll break it for your sake, Mr. Wyville," said the governor.</p>

<p>"I shall put her name on the roll."</p>

<p>And she must be kept aloof from the others. Can this be done?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we can enter her on the hospital list, and send her before
the others to the ship. She will be confined on board in the
hospital."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville held out his hand to the governor.</p>

<p>"I thank you sincerely," he said; "I am deeply interested in this
case."</p>

<p>When he had gone, the bluff old major walked up and down his
office, and mopped his head with his big handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It's like good health and a good conscience to come near that
man," he said to himself. "How strange it is that he should have such
deadly enemies!"</p>

<h2>A CAPTAIN FOR THE HOUGUEMONT.</h2>

<p>IN Mr. Wyville's house, in the library or study, sat Mr. Hamerton.
He had been writing for hours. On the table beside him lay a heap of
documents, with large red seals, like title-deeds; and in another
heap lay a number of letters, addressed and stamped.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville entered, and they talked for some minutes in a serious
vein. It was evident that Mr. Hamerton was engaged in some more
important business than usual, and that he had advised with Mr.
Wyville during its progress.</p>

<p>Lord Somers called, as usual, on his way to the Department; and
shortly afterwards Sheridan arrived. Mr. Hamerton continued to write,
and a cursory conversation began, the gentlemen glancing at the
morning papers.</p>

<p>An exclamation from Lord Somers broke the commonplace.</p>

<p>"Hello! What the deuce! Why, Hamerton, this must be your place.
Are you going to sell Broadwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hamerton, and he went on with his writing.</p>

<p>"The whole estate and manor house?" asked the peer, in plain
astonishment.</p>

<p>"The whole thing," said Hamerton, in the same prosaic tone. Will
Sheridan took the paper and read the advertisement: Magnificent and
historic demesne and manor house of Broadwood--400 acres of rich
land--entire village of Broadwood--valuable church living--antique
furniture, pictures, armour, etc.--in a word, the entire surroundings
of an English aristocrat of the first standing, advertised in the
daily papers to be sold by auction, not as a whole, but in lots.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Lord Somers. "Why not sell the
right to one purchaser?"</p>

<p>"Because he couldn't buy it," answered the stolid Hamerton, who
was in a mood for apophthegms.</p>

<p>"What! You want too much money for it?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Hamerton, this is unkind. Your place is close to
mine, and I am naturally interested, independent of my sincere
interest in your affairs."</p>

<p>"Well, you spoke of buying the right. Now, Somers, no one man
could buy or hold the right to so much land as Broadwood in this
populous and poverty-stricken country--yes, poverty stricken: there
are only a few rich people. Eighty out of every hundred are miserably
poor. The best a rich man could do would be to buy the title-deeds;
but the abstract right of ownership would remain with the farmers who
tilled the land."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Lord Somers.</p>

<p>"I propose to sell the deeds to the men who already hold the land
by right."</p>

<p>"You will break up Broadwood and sell it to your farmers?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Lord Somers was seriously affected by this extraordinary
announcement; but he knew Hamerton too well to remonstrate or
argue.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, looking across his paper, observed both speakers, and
listened to the conversation, evidently pleased.</p>

<p>"You will be no nearer to your republican idea when this is done,"
said Lord Somers, at length; "you will have sold the land, but the
money it brings has not been earned by you."</p>

<p>"Quite true," answered Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Why keep it, then?"</p>

<p>"I shall not keep it."</p>

<p>"Why, Hamerton--what do you mean? What will you do with it?"</p>

<p>"I shall invest it in schools and a library for the people of that
section 'for ever' as the lawyers say. Mr. Wyville and I have been
looking at the matter, and we think this money will establish a
school with three technical branches--chemistry, engineering, and
agriculture."</p>

<p>"And you--will you teach in the schools for a living?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I am going to Australia."</p>

<p>"To Australia!" said Lord Somers and Sheridan in a breath. Then
Sheridan asked--</p>

<p>"Are you going to settle there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am tired of Europe. I shall never return here."</p>

<p>"I am glad," cried Sheridan, starting up and seizing Hamerton's
hand. "Australia is going to send out the largest-hearted men that
ever owned the earth. You will be at home there. You will breathe
freely in its splendid air. Oh, I am proud to see such men turn by
nature to the magnificent South!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had approached the table with a look of intense
pleasure. He laid his hand almost caressingly on Will Sheridan's
shoulder. As they were placed, these three men Wyville, Sheridan, and
Hamerton--they formed a remarkable group.</p>

<p>"You are dangerous company," said Lord Somers, looking at them
with admiration. "You almost tempt me to follow you, or go with you,
to Australia. When do you sail?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan and I will sail on the convict ship in three weeks,"
said Mr. Wyville. "Mr. Hamerton will take my steam yacht, and follow
when he has settled his plans--perhaps a week later."</p>

<p>"I am dumbfounded," said Lord Somers. "I cannot speak on this new
thing. I only foresee that I shall be very lonely, indeed, in London
when you have gone."</p>

<p>After some further conversation on this point, Mr. Wyville changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"You have engaged a captain for the convict ship?" he said to Lord
Somers.</p>

<p>"Yes; Captain Rogers, late of the P. and O. Company's
service."</p>

<p>"You were not aware that I wished to engage him for my yacht?"
said Wyville.</p>

<p>"No; I should be sorry to take him from you. But his articles are
signed now, and good commanders for such a service are not easily
found."</p>

<p>"If I find you a suitable captain, and guarantee his command, will
you oblige me by cancelling Captain Rogers's commission?</p>

<p>"Certainly--if you give him, instead, the command of your
steamer."</p>

<p>"Thank you; that is my intention."</p>

<p>"But have you found another captain for the convict ship?" asked
Lord Somers.</p>

<p>"Yes--I have been looking into the matter with the view of saving
you further trouble. I have settled on a man who is classed as a
first-rate master mariner and commander, and who is now in London,
disengaged."</p>

<p>"I shall make a note of it," said Lord Somers, taking out his
pocket-book. "What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Draper," said Mr. Wyville; "Captain Samuel Draper."</p>

<p>"That will do," said the Secretary. "I shall have new articles
made out. Will you see to it that he is engaged at once, and sent to
the ship at Portland?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shall attend to it to-day."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamerton and Sheridan, who had been talking together at the
other end of the room, now approached, and the conversation became
general. Soon after, Lord Somers said "Good-morning," and proceeded
to his Department.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN SAMUEL DRAPER.</h2>

<p>IN the inner office of Lloyd's great shipping agency, in London,
on the day following Mr. Wyville's conversation with Lord Somers, the
former gentleman sat, while one of the clerks in the office brought
him books and documents.</p>

<p>"This completes Captain Draper's record," said the clerk, handing
a paper to Mr. Wyville. "It is from his last ship."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Now, can you give me his address in London?"</p>

<p>"Yes; No. 37 Horton-street East."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville left the office, and the clerk collected his papers,
from which the visitor had taken notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville hailed a cab, and said to the driver, "Horton street."
It was a long way off, and during the slow progress through the
crowded streets, Mr. Wyville examined his notes and arranged them
carefully in a certain order. At last the cab stopped.</p>

<p>"What number?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"I shall get out here," said Mr. Wyville. "But you may wait for
me--say half an hour."</p>

<p>He walked down the quiet little street, with its uniform brick
houses, green blinds, and white curtains. It was a street of
comfortable residences of small business men and well-to-do
mechanics. Number 37 was in no way different from the neighbouring
houses.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville rang the bell, and an old lady, with glasses pushed up
to her forehead, and a piece of sewing in her hand, opened the door,
and looked inquiringly at the caller.</p>

<p>"Does Captain Draper live here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but he is out at present," said the intelligent old
lady.</p>

<p>"I am sorry; I will call again," said Mr. Wyville turning to
go.</p>

<p>"He will be in soon," said the old lady; "he comes in to dinner
always."</p>

<p>"Then I shall wait, if you please," said Mr. Wyville; and he
entered the house, and sat down in a comfortable little parlour,
while the old woman, drawing down her glasses, went on with her
sewing.</p>

<p>"Captain Draper is my grand-nephew," said she, after a silent
interval:</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Wyville. "Then you will be pleased to know that
I am come to offer him a good command."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am delighted!" said the old lady; "he is so good, so
conscientious. I always said as Samuel would come to something 'igh.
He has been waiting for a ship for nearly a year. I know he doesn't
please his owners, because he is too conscientious."</p>

<p>"You will also be pleased to hear, madam, that his owners this
time will be quite conscientious, too."</p>

<p>"I am so delighted!" said Captain Draper's grand-aunt.</p>

<p>At this moment the outer door opened, and immediately after
Captain Draper entered the room. It was rather a chilly day, and he
had buttoned his coat close up to his throat. He was not a robust
figure--rather slim, and bent forward. The past ten years bad laid a
strong hand on him. The charm of his younger manhood, the boisterous
laugh and hearty manner of waving his hand, was much lessened; but
the cold watchfulness of his prominent blue eyes was proportionately
increased.</p>

<p>He had a long and narrow face, thin jaws, covered with faded
whiskers, worn rather long. His upper lip and chin were shaven,
showing his wide mouth. His lips were dry, as of old, but now they
were bluer, and more offensively cracked. On the whole, he was a
decent-looking man in outward appearance; as he walked rapidly
through the streets, with shoulders bent forward, one would say he
was a consumptive hurrying home. But there was a compression of the
mouth, accompanied with a quick watchfulness of eye, and an ugly
sneer in the muscles of the nose, that would make his face detestable
to anyone who had the power of rapidly perceiving character.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville read the face as easily as if it were a printed
page.</p>

<p>"Captain Draper, I presume?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," said the other, with a wide and unmeaning smile
of the cracked lips, in which the rest of the face took no part.</p>

<p>"I have come from the Treasury, to offer you command of a vessel
in the service of the Government."</p>

<p>"Ah--that's good. In what branch of the service, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Transport," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Troops, I suppose?" said Draper, still smiling.</p>

<p>"No; convicts."</p>

<p>Captain Draper placed a chair so as to see Mr. Wyville's face in
the light. As he took his seat he had ceased to smile.</p>

<p>"Ah!--convicts. Where are they going?"</p>

<p>"West Australia."</p>

<p>Captain Draper remained silent so long that Mr. Wyville spoke
again.</p>

<p>"You are willing to take such a vessel, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want a ship--but these convict ships I don't like; I
don't want to--Are they male convicts?" he asked, interrupting
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, mainly; there will be three hundred men, and only fifty
female convicts on board."</p>

<p>"Fifty." Draper stood up and walked across the room to the
mantelpiece. He leant his elbow on it for a time, then he took up a
little glass ornament in an absent-minded and nervous way.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville sat silently watching him. As Draper raised the piece
of glass, his hand trembled and his face worked. He dropped the glass
to the floor, and it was shattered to pieces. This recalled him. He
smiled at first, then he laughed aloud, his eyes watching Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>"Well--I don't want that ship," he said; "I don't like
convicts."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Mr. Wyville, rising; "you were highly
recommended, Captain Draper; and as the duty is considered onerous,
the voyage will be quite remunerative for the commander."</p>

<p>Draper's cupidity was excited, and he seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about these convicts?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; what do you wish to know?"</p>

<p>"How long have they been in prison?"</p>

<p>"On an average, about three years."</p>

<p>"Three years; did you ever know any to be sent after nine or ten
years?"</p>

<p>"No; not one such case has occurred for the past twenty years. It
would be very unusual."</p>

<p>"Yes; well, you know, I don't care about them--but I have a
curiosity. I suppose they're all right--all about three years,
eh?"</p>

<p>"That will be the average, certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I'll take the ship. Where does she lie, and when is
she to sail?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville gave him all the particulars; and when his questions
ceased, Mr. Wyville drew out a set of articles to be signed.</p>

<p>"You came prepared, eh?" said Draper.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Wyville, gravely reading over the form.</p>

<p>"We were anxious to secure your services, and I thought it just as
well to save time. Please sign your name here--and here--and here.
Thank you. Now I shall say good-day, Captain Draper."</p>

<p>"The ship is ready, you say?" said Draper, following him to the
door; "then I am expected to take command at once, I suppose ?"</p>

<p>"No; not until the day of sailing. Your officers will see to the
preparations for sailing. At two o'clock p.m., on the 10th, you will
take command, and sail."</p>

<p>"Well," said Draper; and as he looked after the strong figure of
Wyville, he muttered to himself--"Well--just as well; they only
average three years. But I'd rather go on board at once, and see them
before we sail."</p>

<h2>KORO AND TAPAIRU.</h2>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Wyville, communing with himself, as he walked from
Draper's house, and entered his cab at the end of Horton-street, "the
elements are moving. May good influences direct them."</p>

<p>At his own house, he dismissed the cab, and, entering, with
unusual gravity greeted Mr. Hamerton, who was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"You said in your note that you had an important business
communication to make to me," said Hamerton, without appearing to
notice Wyville's mental disturbance.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville did not answer, but paced the room to and fro slowly,
sunk in deep thought, his arms crossed on his breast.</p>

<p>"These results may follow," he said at length, evidently thinking
aloud; "but there is need of an intelligence to make them inevitable.
Mr. Hamerton," he said, stopping before his friend, and fixing his
eyes upon him, "I have a trust to offer you that involves a heavy
responsibility. Will you undertake it, for my sake, and, in case of
what may come, carry out my desire to the letter?"</p>

<p>"If it he in my power, I will. If it he beyond me, I will do my
best to the end," answered Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure of it. I am very grateful." Mr. Wyville took his
hand, and pressed it warmly, with still the same grave look. He then
went to a small but massive iron safe in the room, opened it, and
from a drawer took two large sealed packets.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "are two envelopes that contain all my wishes and
all my power. They are mine, so long as I am alive, with freedom to
control my actions. Please remember well my words. In case of my
death or disappearance, or another event to impede my action for
those who depend on me, these packets belong to you, to open, and
read."</p>

<p>"Have you written full instructions therein, which I am to
follow?" I asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"No, I will not instruct you, because I trust you as I would my
own soul. You will understand, when you have read and you will act
for the best. Do you promise me this?"</p>

<p>"I do, most solemnly; but, Mr. Wyville, suppose I should be
unable--suppose I should die before your trust were carried out--is
there anyone else to whom I may transfer the duty?"</p>

<p>"Yes; to Sheridan."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville locked the safe, and handed the key to Hamerton.</p>

<p>"I shall send the safe to the yacht before we sail," he said.</p>

<p>"Now let us inform the children."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville struck a bell, and Ngarra-jil silently entered.</p>

<p>A word in his own language from his master sent him out as
quickly. In a few minutes, Mr. Wyville and Mr. Hamerton went up
stairs and entered a large and richly draped room, in which the
entire furniture consisted of low and soft divans, lounges, cushions,
and furs, the effect of which was very extraordinary, but very
beautiful. The room seemed to have no occupant, as the gentlemen
walked its length towards a deep bay window.</p>

<p>"We--are--here!" said a low voice, in distinctly measured
syllables, as a diffident child might slowly strike three notes of an
air, and then there were two laughs, as clear and joyous as the sound
of silver bells, and the light sound of hand-clapping.</p>

<p>The gentlemen, smiling, turned to the draped recess, and there,
half shaded by the curtains, peeped the dark, laughing faces of the
Australian sisters, Koro and Tapairu, the grandchildren of
Te-mana-roa, the King of the Vasse.</p>

<p>That Mr. Hamerton had become familiar to the girls was evident
from their natural and unrestrained conduct.</p>

<p>A residence of several years in a northern climate had arrested in
the sisters the immature development so common in warm countries.
They had matured slowly; and while preserving all that was charming
and natural of their woodland graces, the restraint of another and a
gentler mode of life covered them like a delicate robe. They were so
outlandish and beautiful, in their strange and beautiful room, that
they might be mistaken for rare bronzes, were it not for their
flashing eyes and curving lips.</p>

<p>As they sat in the curtained recess, greeting the gentlemen with a
joyous laugh, there entered the room a very old Australian woman,
followed by two young men, bearing trays with several dishes. These
were set down on a low square divan. The old woman removed the
covers, and with quick, short words directed the black men to place
cushions around the divan.</p>

<p>The sisters, Koro and Tapairu, came from their seclusion, speaking
in their own rapid tongue both to the old woman and to Mr. Wyville.
They took each a corner of the divan, seating themselves on the
cushions placed on the floor, Mr. Wyville and Hamerton taking the
opposite corners.</p>

<p>The food, to which each helped himself, was a savory meal of
boiled rice, yams, and rich stews, of which the Australians are very
fond; and, following these dishes, a varied supply of delicious
fruit, among which were mangoes, guavas, and the ambrosial mungyte or
honey-stalk of West Australia.</p>

<p>The conversation during the meal was wholly in the language of the
sisters, so that Mr. Hamerton remained silent. Koro and Tapairu had
evidently been studying English; but they could by no means converse
in the strange tongue.</p>

<p>As if instinctively aware that something unforeseen was about to
happen, Tapairu, the younger but braver of the sisters, had asked Mr.
Wyville to speak.</p>

<p>"You are soon to leave this cold country," he said, in their
tongue, looking from sister to sister; "and return to your own
beautiful Vasse."</p>

<p>The girls answered, as if they were a single thing of nature, by a
silent and inquiring look. It was hard to read either pleasure or
pain in their faces, or anything but surprise; yet a close observer
would have discerned a subtending line akin to doubt or fear.</p>

<p>"Are you not glad?" asked Mr. Wyville, with a smile of
astonishment at their silence.</p>

<p>"Yes," they softly answered, in one breath, after a pause, but not
joyously. "Yes; we shall see the good Te-mana-roa, and we shall find
the emus' nests on the mountain. We are very glad."</p>

<p>The old woman, who had remained in the room, chuckled audibly,
and, when the others looked round at her, laughed outright in
uncontrollable joy at the thought of returning to her beloved life of
freedom in the forest. More rapidly than a skilled musician could
evoke notes, she ran from treble to bass in voluble gratitude and
benediction. Then she slid off to carry the joyous word to the other
dusky members of this extraordinary household.</p>

<p>"You will be happy in your old home in the yacht," continued Mr.
Wyville; "and this friend, my brother and yours, will take you in his
care till we see Te-mana-roa, and the Vasse."</p>

<p>As Mr. Wyville spoke, the hidden fear became plain in Tapairu's
face. She looked only at Mr. Wyville, her large deer-like eyes slowly
filling with tears. Her sister, too, was distressed, but in a lesser
degree; and her eyes, instead of being fixed on Mr. Wyville, passed
on to Hamerton, and rested.</p>

<p>"You are not coming with us to the Vasse!" at length said Tapairu,
in a slow, monotonous voice. "You will remain here."</p>

<p>"No, I, too, shall go, and even before you. But we voyage on
different ships."</p>

<p>"Why does not your brother and ours go on the other ship, and let
you come with us?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville looked troubled at the reception of his news by the
sisters. As Tapairu spoke, in the last question, his face became
exceedingly grave, as if he could never again smile. The sisters saw
the shadow, and were troubled also. Mr. Wyville, without looking at
them, spoke--</p>

<p>"Children, you should trust that I will do what is best; and I
know the world better than you. Tapairu, I am acting wisely. Koro I
am sure of your confidence at least."</p>

<p>Before the words had died, Koro, with swimming eyes, had risen and
taken Mr. Wyville's hand, which she kissed and placed upon her head.
The act was full of affection and faith.</p>

<p>Tapairu, on whom the reproof had fallen like a blow, sat just as
before, only the light had faded from her eyes, and her bosom heaved
visibly. Her sister went and sat beside her, throwing her arms round
her, as to give comfort. Tapairu allowed the embrace, but did not
move a muscle of face or body.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville rose and walked to the window, glanced out for a
moment, then, turning, looked at the sisters. He approached and laid
his band with inexpressible gentleness on Tapairu's head, as he had
done on Koro's. The proud but sensitive nature yielded at the touch,
and with one quick look of sorrow and appeal, she buried her face in
her sister's bosom, and sobbed unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>The old woman, who had re-entered, began an excited and guttural
remonstrance against this unreasoning grief. Mr. Wyville chose this
moment to depart. He knew that the brief season of cloud would soon
pass, and let the sun shine again; that the reflection following
petulance is often the purer for the previous error.</p>

<h2>THE CHILD'S GRAVE.</h2>

<p>THE Houguemont, chartered by the Government to carry the convicts
to West Australia, lay in Portland Roads. She rode within the dark
shadow of the gloomy cliff, upon which is built one of the greatest
of the English imperial prisons. She was a large, old-fashioned
merchant ship, of two thousand tons burden; a slow sailor, but a
strong and roomy vessel.</p>

<p>She was fitted in the usual way of convict ships. Her main deck
and her lower deck were divided into separate compartments, the
dividing walls below being heavy and strong bulkheads, while those on
deck were wooden barriers about nine feet high, with side doors, for
the passage of the sailors while working the ship. At each of these
doors, during the entire voyage, stood two soldiers, with fixed
bayonets on their loaded rifles.</p>

<p>The hatch coverings opening to the lower deck, where the convicts
were confined, were removed, and around each hatchway, reaching from
the upper deck, or roof of the convict's room, to the lower deck or
floor, was one immense grating, formed of strong iron bars. This
arrangement gave plenty of air and a good deal of light, the only
obstruction being the bars.</p>

<p>Seen from below, on the convicts' deck, every hatchway stood in
the centre of the ship like a great iron cage, with a door by which
the warders entered, and a ladder to reach the upper deck.</p>

<p>The convicts below never tired of looking upwards through the
bars, though they could see nothing above but the swaying ropes and
sails, and at night the beautiful sky and the stars.</p>

<p>In the forward and smallest compartment of the ship between decks
lived the crew, who went up and down by their own hatchway. In the
next, and largest compartment, lived the male convicts, three hundred
in number. The central compartment was the hospital; and next to this
the compartment for the female convicts. The after compartment
between decks was occupied by the sixty soldiers who kept guard on
the ship.</p>

<p>The main, or upper deck, was divided as follows: the after part,
under the poop deck, was occupied by the staterooms for officers and
passengers, and the richly-furnished cabin dining room. Forward of
this, beginning at the front of the poop, was a division of the deck
to which the female convicts were allowed at certain hours of the
day. The next section was the deck where the male convicts were
allowed to exercise, one hundred at a time, throughout the day.</p>

<p>The fore part of the main deck, running out to the bowsprit like a
^ was roofed in, the angular section taking in the bowsprit. The
front of this section, running across the deck, was composed of
enormous bars, thicker than a man's arm, like those around the
hatches, and within these bars, in sight of the male convicts on
deck, were confined the malefactors, or rule-breakers.</p>

<p>This triangular section was the punishment cell of the ship. It
was entered by a ponderous door, composed of bars also. Its two rear
walls were the acute angle of the ship's bulwarks; its front was the
row of bars running from side to side of the vessel, and facing aft
on the main deck.</p>

<p>The evil-doers confined here for punishment had neither bed nor
seat; they sat upon the deck, and worked at heavy tasks of oakum
picking. They could not shirk, for a warder kept sentry outside the
cage.</p>

<p>As these refractory ones looked through their bars at the deck,
they saw, strapped to the foremast, a black gaff or spar with iron
rings, which, when the spar was lowered horizontally, corresponded to
rings screwed into the deck.</p>

<p>This was the triangle, where the unruly convicts were triced up
and flogged every morning.</p>

<p>Above this triangle, tied around the foremast, was a new and very
fine hempen rope, leading away to the end of the foreyard. This was
the ultimate appeal--the law's last terrible engine--the halter which
swung mutineers and murderers out over the hissing sea to
eternity.</p>

<p>The Houguemont had taken on board her terrible cargo. From early
dawn the chains had been marching down the steep hill from Portland
Prison, and passing on tugs to her deck where the convict officers
unlocked their chains, called their rolls, and sent them below to
their berths.</p>

<p>Last of all, the female convicts bad come, fifty in number, in
five chains.</p>

<p>As they stood huddled on the deck of the transport, answering to
their numbers, there were hysterical sounds and wild eyes among them.
At last their chains were unlocked, and the female warders handed to
each the number of her berth, and sent her below.</p>

<p>Towards the end of one of the chains stood a prisoner with a white
face and a strangely calm air. She did not stare around in the dazed
way of her unfortunate sisters; but remained on the spot where they
bade her stand, motionless. She only turned her head once, with a
smile of silent comfort to some unhappy one near her who had made the
hysterical sound.</p>

<p>When the key came to her link of the chain and unlocked it, and
she stood unshackled, another warder thrust into her band a card, and
pushed her towards the hatch. She tottered beneath the rough and
needless force, and would have fallen down the open hatchway, had she
not caught at a swinging rope, and saved herself. As she recovered,
she gave a kind of pitiful short cry or moan, and looked round
bewildered, the tears springing to her eyes. The rough and busy
warder again approached her, and she shrank aside in terror.</p>

<p>At this moment she felt a soft hand take her own, and hold it
tightly. The touch restored her confidence. She turned and met the
sweet face and kindly smile of Sister Cecilia. The warder at the same
moment respectfully saluted the nun.</p>

<p>"This is my hospital assistant, warder," said Sister Cecilia still
holding Alice's hand. "She is to be allowed to go to my room."</p>

<p>"All right, ma'am," said the warder, who, in reality, was not
harsh, but only rude and hurried in manner; "pass on, Number Four.
Here," she shouted to the next on the chain, "take this card--and
down you go, quick!"</p>

<p>And as Alice stood aside with a great sense of relief and
thankfulness, and with swimming eyes, the warder whispered to Sister
Cecilia: "I'm glad she's not going among 'em--we're all glad on
it."</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia, holding Alice's hand, led her along a narrow
boarded way, at the end of which was a door opening, into a pleasant
room, one side of which was covered with a large medicine case, and
off which lay two bright little sleeping rooms. When the door was
closed, Sister Cecilia took Alice's white face between her hands with
hearty force, and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Thank God, my child!" she cried, "you are safe at last!"</p>

<p>Alice could not speak; but she controlled herself, and kept from
sobbing. She looked around wonderingly.</p>

<p>"This is my room, Alice," said Sister Cecilia; "my room and yours.
This narrow passage is for us alone. It leads straight to the female
compartment and the hospital; and no one can come here but you and
I--not a soul, for the next four months. Just think of that, child!
Look out of that pretty little window, and say 'good-bye' to gloomy
old England and her prisons. We'll be all alone till we arrive in
Australia--except when we are attending the sick."</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley did not answer in words--her heart overflowed; and
the kind little nun led her into the pleasanter sleeping room of the
two, and left her, saying that this was her own room for the
voyage.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Alice sank on her knees with such a flood of
feeling as seemed to melt her very heart. With eyes drowned in tears
she raised her hands towards the frowning cliffs of Portland, while
her quivering lips moved in yearning words.</p>

<p>She was saying farewell, not to England, but to that which was
greater to her than England--to the little spot of earth where lay
the body of her dead child. O true heart of motherhood, that never
changes, never forgets, never loses the sound of the maternal music,
once the immortal key has been struck.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my darling! O, if I had only one single withered blade
of grass to cherish" cried the poor mother; and as she spoke she saw
clearly in her mind's eye the little neglected and forgotten grave.
"Good-bye, my darling--for ever--for ever!"</p>

<p>She buried her face in the bed, and wept bitterly and long. Sister
Cecilia came twice to the room softly, and looked in at the mourner,
but did not disturb her. The second time she came, Alice was weeping
with bowed head.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia leant over her, and placed beside her hand a little
box, covered with white paper, on which lay a sealed letter. Having
done so, the Sister laid her hand caressingly on Alice's head, and
withdrew quietly.</p>

<p>It was many minutes before Alice raised her tear-stained face. As
she did so, she laid her hand on the little box, and, saw the letter.
She did not heed it at first, thinking it was Sister Cecilia's. But
another instant, and she had read her own name--"Alice
Walmsley"--written on the letter, and in a hand that was strangely
familiar. The written name itself was not more familiar than the
handwriting.</p>

<p>Something thrilled her as she took the little box in her hand, and
opened it. She found within a piece of soft mould, in which some
sweet young grass was growing, and on one side a fresh wild flower,
that must have been pulled that day.</p>

<p>As she looked, with blurred sight, the meaning of the blessed gift
poured into her heart like balm, and her thought rose up to heaven in
an ecstasy of gratitude.</p>

<p>She did not need to look at the letter; she divined its contents.
But at length she took it, and broke the seal, and read the few words
it contained:--</p>

<p>"Dear Alice,--The grass and flowers were growing this morning on
your baby's grave. The wild flowers have covered it for years. I hope
it shall never be neglected nor disturbed."</p>

<p>Yours faithfully WILLIAM SHERIDAN</p>

<p>An hour later, Sister Cecilia entered the outer room, purposely
making a noise to distract Alice's reverie. But she had to come at
last and touch her arm, and take the box and the letter from her
hands, before Alice realized the revelation that had come to her. She
did not see it even then as a whole; but piece by piece in her mind
the incredible happiness dawned upon her, that she actually had with
her the precious grass, with young life in it, fresh from her
darling's grave.</p>

<p>And later on, slowly, but by sure degrees, entered another
thought, that rested like a holy thing beside this pure
affection.</p>

<p>The last words of the letter repeated themselves like a strain of
distant music in her ears: "Yours faithfully--yours faithfully"--and
though the sense that was touched had in it a tone of pain and
reproach that smote her, it roused her from further dwelling on her
own unhappiness.</p>

<h2>THE SAILING OF THE HOUGUEMONT.</h2>

<p>THE last convict had been sent below. The barred doors in the
railed hatchways were locked. The hundreds of cooped criminals
mingled with each other freely for the first time in many years. The
sentries had been posted at the hatches and passages on deck. The
sailors had shaken out the sails. The capstan had been worked until
every spare link of cable was up.</p>

<p>The Houguemont was ready for sea. She only awaited the coming of
her commander.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville walked to and fro on the poop deck, casting now and
again a searching glance at the pier and the steep cliff road. At
length his pace became less regular, and his usually imperturbable
face betrayed impatience. It was two hours past the time when the
captain had engaged to be on board.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wyville stood looking landward, with a darkened brow, the
chief warder in command of the prison officers, rapidly approached
him, with an excited air, and saluted in military fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Gray," said Mr. Wyville, turning, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"One man missing, sir! not on board--he must have slipped
overboard from the soldiers, and attempted to swim ashore."</p>

<p>"When did he come on board?"</p>

<p>"With the last chain, sir."</p>

<p>"Then he must be in the water still. He would strike for the
mainland, not for the island."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a soldier, who had run up the rigging, shouted that
there was a hamper or basket floating a short distance astern of the
ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville asked one of the ship's officers for a glass, which he
levelled at the floating basket. He saw that it moved obliquely
towards the shore of the mainland, though a strong tide was setting
in the contrary direction, towards the island. He lowered the glass
with a saddened air.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" he murmured, shutting the glass, irresolutely. He
knew that the absconder, finding the floating hamper, had placed it
over his head in order to escape the eyes of the guards. As he laid
down the telescope, a rifle shot rang from the maintop, and the water
leaped in a jet of spray within a foot of the basket. Next instant,
came two reports, the basket was knocked on its side, and all on the
deck of the convict ship plainly saw a man swimming in the sea. One
of the bullets had struck him, evidently, for he shouted and dashed
about wildly.</p>

<p>All this had happened in a few seconds. The shots had followed
each other as rapidly as file-firing. At the second shot, Mr. Wyville
looked at the soldiers with a face aflame with indignation. As the
third shot rang out, he shouted to the soldiers; but his voice was
drowned in the report.</p>

<p>Next moment, he saw the levelled rifle of another soldier, and
heard the officer directing his aim. Without a word, Mr. Wyville
seized the long and heavy marine telescope, which he had laid on the
rack, and, balancing himself on the poop for an instant, he hurled
the glass like a missile from a catapult right into the group of
soldiers on the top.</p>

<p>The missile struck lengthwise against the rifleman, and knocked
him towards the mast, his weapon going off harmlessly in the air.
Consternation seized the others, and the young officer began an
indignant and loud demand as to who had dared assault his men.</p>

<p>"Come down, Sir," said Mr. Wyville, sternly, "and receive your
orders before you act."</p>

<p>The subaltern came down, and joined Mr. Wyville on the poop,
saluting him as he approached.</p>

<p>"I was not aware, sir," he said, "that I was to wait for orders in
cases of mutiny or escape."</p>

<p>"This man could be overtaken," said Mr. Wyville. "Your guards
allowed him to escape; and you have no right to kill him for
escaping, if the law had no right to kill him for his crime."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he brought the glass to bear on the unfortunate
wretch in the water, to whom a boat was now sweeping with swift
stroke.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said, putting down the glass, and turning from the
officer; "the man is drowned!"</p>

<p>The struggling swimmer, spent with previous exertions, had been
struck by a bullet in the shoulder; and though the wound was not
mortal, it rapidly spent his remaining strength. Before the boat had
reached him, the poor fellow had thrown up his arms and sunk. His
body was found and taken to the ship.</p>

<p>During this scene, Captain Draper had come on deck, unobserved. He
had passed quite close to Mr. Wyville as he spoke severely to the
military officer. A few minutes later, when Mr. Wyville stood alone,
the captain approached him.</p>

<p>"Am I supposed to command this ship, or to take orders also?" he
asked, not offensively, but with his usual hybrid smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville remained silent a moment, as if undecided. The recent
shocking event had somewhat changed his plans.</p>

<p>"You command the ship, Sir," he said, slowly, and fixing his eyes
on Captain Draper's face, "under me. So long as your duty is done, no
interference will be possible. It may be well to understand now,
however, that there is a higher authority than yours on board."</p>

<p>Captain Draper bowed; then turning to his chief officer who had
heard the conversation, he gave orders for sailing.</p>

<h2>FACE TO FACE.</h2>

<p>THE convict ship, with all sail set, before a strong
quarterbreeze, ploughed heavily round the South of England, and then
spread her arms like a sea spirit as she swept majestically towards
the deep southern seas.</p>

<p>No need to moralize afresh on the weird contrast between the tall
ship, nobly and beautifully breasting the waves, and the hideous
secret she bears within--</p>

<pre>
Who, as she smiles in the silvery light,
Spreading her wings on the bosom of night,
Alone on the deep, as the moon in the sky,
A phantom, of beauty, could deem with a sigh,

That so lovely a thing is the mansion of sin,
And that souls that are smitten be bursting within?
Who, as he watches her silently gliding,
Remembers that wave after wave is dividing

Bosoms that sorrow and guilt could not sever,
Hearts that are broken and parted for ever?
Or deems that he watches, afloat on the wave,
The death-bed of hope, or the young spirit's grave.
</pre>

<p>The first few days of the voyage are inexpressibly horrible. The
hundreds of pent-up wretches are unused to the darkness of the ship,
strange to their crowded quarters and to each other, depressed in
spirits at their endless separation from home, sickened to death with
the merciless pitch and roll of the vessel, alarmed at the dreadful
thunder of the waves against their prison walls, and fearful of
sudden engulfment, with the hatches barred. The scene is too hideous
for a picture--too dreadful to be described in words.</p>

<p>Only those who have stood within the bars, and heard the din of
devils and the appalling sounds of despair, blended in a diapason
that made every hatch-mouth a vent of hell, can imagine the horrors
of the hold of a convict ship.</p>

<p>About a week out from England, the Houguemont went bowling down
the Atlantic, and across the Bay of Biscay. The night was cold and
dark, and the strong breeze held the ship steady, with every sail
drawing.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville and Sheridan, the latter of whom had come on deck for
the first time since the vessel sailed, in warm greatcoats, walked
the lee side of the poop; while the captain, also heavily wrapped,
paced the weather side, glancing now and again at the sails, and
taking an occasional look at the course.</p>

<p>"You have got over your sea-sickness?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Sheridan laughed.</p>

<p>"You forget that I am a sailor, Mr. Wyville," he said. "I had
another reason for keeping my room."</p>

<p>Will Sheridan, for months past, had often been on the point of
telling Mr. Wyville the whole story of his life, his love for Alice
Walmsley, and her terrible suffering for another's crime; but the
moment still had gone by, and he had never broached the subject. He
longed to speak his warm gratitude to the wise friend who had
preserved Alice's reason and life in Millbank.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville never dreamt that Sheridan and Alice Walmsley had
known each other. He did not know that on the deck at that moment
stood Sheridan's deadliest enemy, within five yards of the man he
hated, and who mortally hated him.</p>

<p>"I will tell him all now," were the words in Sheridan's mind; and
he turned to Mr. Wyville, and took hold of his arm. They paused in
their walk, and stood at the foot of the mizzen mast.</p>

<p>At that moment the captain went towards the wheel, and bent his
head to look at the compass. The strong binnacle-light fell full upon
his face, just as Will Sheridan stopped and laid his hand on Mr.
Wyville's arm.</p>

<p>The face in the binnacle glare was straight before Sheridan. His
eyes were arrested by it as by a spectre; his land closed like a vice
on the arm of his friend.</p>

<p>"God Almighty!" The words rushed from his heart in a hissing
whisper.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was astounded, but he could not even surmise the cause
of Sheridan's tremendous excitement. He had seen the face of the
captain as it remained for a moment in the strong light; but he did
not connect this with his friend's emotion. He waited for Sheridan to
speak.</p>

<p>Instead of speaking, Sheridan watched the dark figure of the
captain as he passed from the wheel to the weather side of the poop,
and paced slowly up and down. Then he drew a deep breath, tremulous
with aroused passion.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" he asked in a low voice, after a long look.</p>

<p>"That is the captain," answered Mr. Wyville. "Let me introduce
you. Captain Draper!"</p>

<p>The captain walked towards them. Sheridan remained just as he had
been standing.</p>

<p>"Captain Draper, let me introduce--"</p>

<p>"Stay" said Sheridan, laying his hand on Mr. Wyville's breast,
"one moment."</p>

<p>He strode to the binnacle, seized the lamp, and returned with it
in his hand. When he was within two feet of Draper, he threw the
light full on his own face, sternly turned towards his enemy.</p>

<p>"Now!" he said "now, introduce me!"</p>

<p>The sight of the terrible face struck Draper like a physical blow.
His breath came in a short gasp, and be staggered back till he leaned
against the mast. He never said a word.</p>

<p>Sheridan turned the glare of the lamp upon him for an instant,
then snatched it rapidly away from the repulsive sight. At that
moment, with the veil of darkness suddenly torn back, Draper's face
was ghastly, and his attitude full of terror.</p>

<p>Will Sheridan replaced the lamp in the binnacle, and walked
straight to his own room.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was profoundly astonished and puzzled at this scene.
He remained on deck for an hour or more after Sheridan's abrupt
departure; but he did not speak to Captain Draper, who paced his side
of the poop in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>It was an hour of fearful torture to Draper, for, like most
scoundrels who are cowards, he suffered over and over again the
agonies of shame and exposure which he knew he had earned. But, like
this class, too, he always planned his conduct, even his words,
beforehand. As soon as the appalling interview had passed, and he
found himself personally unmolested, his adroit and subtle mind began
weaving the warp and woof of a devil's plot that should make him the
winner in this contest now begun.</p>

<p>He looked at Wyville, who stood grazing out on the sea, and asked
himself, "Does he know?" And he speedily ran over the signs, and
concluded that Mr. Wyville knew nothing of his relations to Sheridan.
He remembered that Wyville had called him to be introduced to
Sheridan, and he had noticed the surprised exclamation with which
Wyville had observed Sheridan's extraordinary conduct.</p>

<p>The midnight eight bells sounded, and the mate came to relieve the
captain from his watch; but Draper said he could not sleep, and would
remain on deck an hour longer.</p>

<p>In that hour, he was alone on the poop; Mr. Wyville had gone
below. Draper, looking down through the glass roof of the
dining-room, saw that a bright light was burning in Sheridan's room.
As he looked at the light, secretly and alone, a desperate hatred
burned in his heart like poison. The years of his guilt were melted
down into that one hour, and they took the form of a blighting curse.
Could malediction have murdered Sheridan, he would have been withered
to death by the baneful light of Draper's eyes.</p>

<p>But the hatred of a man so naturally evil as Draper is apt to turn
into practical injury. The coward who hates is never at rest; he will
either malign his enemy with foul words in secret, or he will dig a
pit for his feet. It is only manly men who can hate and hold their
tongues.</p>

<p>As Draper paced the deck, towards the end of the hour, his tread
actually became stealthy and fearful, as if he dreaded lest the
nature of his thoughts might be read in the sound of his steps.
Slowly and carefully he turned the circumstances over in his mind.
Wyville certainly did not know of his relations with Sheridan.
Sheridan himself had evidently been surprised at the meeting. Only
one knew: none else had any interest in knowing. That one must be
silenced, or--he, Draper, must face disgrace. Once before, Sheridan
had eluded his design; but this time--and, as he concluded his walk
and plot together, he glared at the light in Will Sheridan's room,
like a serpent in the outer darkness--this time there would be no
mistake or hesitation on his part.</p>

<h2>HOW A PRISONER MIGHT BREAK A BAR.</h2>

<p>THE days slipped into weeks as the Houguemont sailed southward
down the great commercial highway of the Atlantic. The mild airs of
the warmer latitudes surprised and delighted those who had only known
the moist climate of Britain. As the vessel sailed close to the
island of Pico, one of the Azores, the deck was crowded with gazers
on the unknown land.</p>

<p>It was the forenoon of a lovely day. The sun shone with radiant
splendour on the soaring peak and purple cliffs of Pico. The island
seemed to most of those on the ship like some legendary land of fairy
lore. They bad never seen any country but England, and they had never
before heard even the name of this important-looking place.</p>

<p>On the bow of the convict ship, standing on the raised deck, which
was the roof of the punishment cell or compartment, stood three men,
looking up at Pico. These three, from the day of the ship's sailing,
had been drawn together by inherent attraction; and now, among all
the queer new friendships of the voyage, there was none stronger than
theirs. And yet they were very dissimilar, inwardly and
outwardly.</p>

<p>One was a tall man, solemn-faced and severe, dressed in sombre
garments; the next was a small man, mild of face and manner, clad in
old-fashioned sailor's blue; the third was a very black man, whose
hair stood upright on his head when he removed his immense fur cap,
and--whose body from throat to feet was clothed in furs.</p>

<p>Strange it was, that this seemingly discordant trio, Mr. Haggett,
Officer Lodge and Ngarra-jil, had developed a mutual attraction, each
for the other; and, after a few weeks at sea, had spent almost their
whole waking time in each other's company.</p>

<p>They did not converse much, if any. Ben Lodge did not quite
understand Mr. Haggett's solemn scriptural illustrations and heavy
comments; Mr. Haggett did not pay much heed to Ben Lodge's dreadful
tale of carnage in the Chinese bombardment; and neither of them
understood Ngarra-jil, nor did he comprehend a word they said.</p>

<p>Yet they passed day after day in each other's company, leaning
over the vessel's side or sitting on the sunny forecastle.</p>

<p>The presence of Officer Lodge on board needs explanation. Two days
before the convict ship sailed, Mr. Wyville walked into the lock-up
at Walton-le-Dale, followed by Ngarra-jil.</p>

<p>Officer Lodge met him with a mild, every-day air, and, pointing
with a backward motion of the hand towards the cell, informed him
that it was "hempty."</p>

<p>"Have you any relatives or others depending on you?" asked Mr.
Wyville, falling into the matter-of-fact simplicity of the
policeman.</p>

<p>"No, sir; no none as can't get along without me. I 'ave lived here
alone for fifteen year. I don't know a man, though, in Walton to take
my place. There's a deal of trust in this hoffice, sir; a deal of
trust."</p>

<p>"What property do you own here?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"The donkey and water-cart is mine, though the village gave 'em to
me. That's all the property."</p>

<p>"I need a careful man to oversee a settlement," said Mr. Wyville.
"But he will have to go to Australia. He will be comfortably placed,
much more so than you are here; and his engagement will be permanent.
I came to offer the place to you--can you come?"</p>

<p>"Yessir," said Officer Lodge, as quietly as if he were asked to
walk down the street. "Do you want me to start now?"</p>

<p>"It is now noon; I will return to London on the two o'clock train.
Meanwhile, I will walk through the village." Turning to Ngarra-jil,
Mr. Wyville said in his own language, "You can remain here."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville walked straight to the old home of Alice Walmsley, and
lingered a long time in and around the deserted and decaying cottage.
There was a warm feeling in his heart, a new and happy growth, which
was thrilled and strengthened as his eye fell on objects that might
once have been familiar to Alice Walmsley.</p>

<p>As he left the place, to return for Officer Lodge, it seemed as
dear to him as if he had known and loved it all his life. He turned
towards it, as he walked down the road, and there was a quiet
gladness in his face.</p>

<p>"She will leave it all behind," he murmured. "There shall be no
picture of its wretchedness in her memory."</p>

<p>He passed to the court-house. Officer Lodge and Ngarra-jil were
sitting in the office, silently looking at each other. At first,
Officer Lodge had spoken to his companion; but Ngarra-jil had
answered only by a gruff and unintelligible monosyllable. Then they
had subsided into perfect silence.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>"Come."</p>

<p>They went to the rail-way station, and took their seats for
London. Officer Lodge and Ngarra-jil sat opposite each other, and
continued their acquaintance in the same silent fashion which had
marked its beginning in the stationhouse.</p>

<p>On board the convict ship, they had attracted the lonely Mr.
Haggett, who, in a patronizing manner at first, joined their
company.</p>

<p>As these three stood near the bow of the Houguemont, looking up at
the purple cliffs of lofty Pico, there rose an extraordinary
commotion on the deck among the convicts.</p>

<p>That morning, two men, the worst and most disorderly characters in
the ship, had been locked up in the punishment crib. They had first
been sentenced to work at oakum picking; but they sat within the bars
idle, staring out at the crowd of convicts on deck, and singing and
shouting. For this they had been again reported, and the officers had
now come to take them out for further punishment.</p>

<p>The officers stood waiting, for him who had the key of the barred
door; and he was searching vainly in his pockets. After a while, it
was evident that the key had been mislaid or lost. The officers could
not open the barred door.</p>

<p>The two culprits within were the first to understand this, and
they set up a howl of derision. They danced about in their den,
cursing the officers and snapping their fingers at them through the
bars.</p>

<p>At length a dreadful idea struck one of the desperate wretches.
His eye had fallen on the heap of loosely-picked oakum inside the
bars. With a yell he seized an armful of the inflammable material and
threw it far within the cage, against a heap of tarred rope ready for
picking.</p>

<p>The officers stood outside, watching the fellow's action with
alarm. When he had gathered all the oakum into a pile, he drew from
his pocket, a lucifer match, and flourished it before the officers'
eyes with a grin of triumph and devilish meaning. His brutal
associate within the bars, upon whom the meaning of the preparations
broke suddenly at sight of the match, gave a wild shout of delight
and defiance.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he cried, shaking his fist at the powerless warders,
"you can't help yourselves. We'll set fire to the ship before your
eyes!"</p>

<p>The dreadful threat struck terror into the convicts on deck, who
began to huddle together like sheep.</p>

<p>The officers looked into each other's pale faces, dumb and
helpless. One of them caught hold of the massive bars of the door,
and shook them with all his force. He might as well have tried to
shake down the mast.</p>

<p>Yelling with delight at their power, the two miscreants within
piled up the pyre. Then, he who held the match selected a dry place
on deck to strike it. He bent down on his knees, and covered his
action from the eyes of the officers.</p>

<p>In another instant he sprang to his feet, holding a blazing rope
of loosely-twisted oakum. With a laugh that rang through the ship, be
applied the torch to the pile of oakum, and the yellow flame licked
up the ready material with fearful rapidity.</p>

<p>At sight of the flame, a cry of alarm rose from the huddled
convicts, drowning the reports of the officers' pistols, who were
shooting down the incendiaries.</p>

<p>It was too late. Had they used their pistols before the match was
struck, they would have acted in time. To slaughter the wretches now
was to insure the continuation of the fire. Were the prisoners let
alone, they might have become terrified at their own danger, and have
quenched the blaze before it had seized the ship.</p>

<p>One of the officers placed the muzzle of his pistol to the
ponderous lock of the cage, and fired. The bullet destroyed the lock,
but did not force it. At that moment, with a cry of success, an
officer dashed through the crowd, and seized the lock. He had found
the key! But it would not turn in the shattered wards. The bullet had
wedged everything together, and the bolt had become a rivet.</p>

<p>By this time the flames had spread over the pile of tarred rope,
and had fastened on the beams overhead. The pitch bubbled up between
the seams of the deck, and dense volumes of smoke poured through the
bars.</p>

<p>The alarm had spread to the convicts below, and an awful sound of
affright arose from the hundreds of horrified hearts.</p>

<p>The officers dashed wildly to and fro. Some of the ship's crew had
begun to work with axes on the roof of the cage, which was a
heavily-timbered deck. The fire began to roar with the dreadful sound
that denotes the untamable power of approaching conflagration.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Wyville came forward, and with one glance took
in the whole scene. Everyone made way for him as he strode to the
cage. The convicts prayed him, "save us!" the ultimate appeal of
terror-stricken men.</p>

<p>He stood an instant looking at the fire--saw the mortal danger. In
ten minutes more no earthly power could subdue the flames.</p>

<p>"Shall we open the hatches, and let the convicts come on deck?"
asked the pallid chief warder, the key in his hand.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Wyville, with such sudden force, that the man
staggered back in dismay.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville looked at the lock, and saw its condition. He shook
the bars with amazing force.</p>

<p>A gust of flame and smoke now rushed through the bars and drove
everyone back, even Mr. Wyville. He rushed forward again; then turned
to the officers, who had retreated to the foremast, and called them
to him. No one moved--they were cowed.</p>

<p>Another instant, and a tall man pushed through the crowd, and
stood beside Wyville. It was Mr. Haggett. Their eyes met for one
instant. They understood one another.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Haggett, in a low, steady voice.</p>

<p>"The silk curtains from the dining-room--quick" answered Mr.
Wyville in the same tone.</p>

<p>Next moment Haggett was clearing a lane for himself through and
over the crowd. He disappeared towards the cabin. They knew he would
return, and they kept the way open for him. In half a minute he flew
back, in each hand a long red silken curtain, torn from the cabin
windows.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville stood waiting for him, holding in his hand a heavy
iron belaying pin, which he had taken from the rail. He took one of
the curtains, twisted it into a rope, and pushed one end through the
bars. This end he brought out four bars off, and around these four
bars he wound both curtains, one after the other.</p>

<p>When the curtains were entirely wound in this way, he inserted the
heavy iron rod between the folds, at the two central bars, and began
to turn it end over end like a lever. The first turn made the silken
rope rigid; the second strained it; the third called out all the
muscular power of the man. But there was nothing gained.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville turned, and looked towards Haggett, who approached.
Both men seized the iron lever, and pulled it down with all their
force.</p>

<p>"This is a convict's trick," said Haggett, as they paused for
breath.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville made no reply, but continued the tremendous leverage.
There was a cry from the convicts: they saw the massive bars
yielding--the two outer bars bending towards the centre under the
terrific strain.</p>

<p>Once again the upper end of the lever was seized by both men, and
with a united effort of strength pulled and pressed down. The next
turn was easily made; the mighty bars had bent like lead in the
centre and then broken, leaving two gaps wide enough to allow the
entrance of a man.</p>

<p>When this was done, Mr. Wyville and Mr. Haggett fell back, while
the officers and sailors dashed into the burning cage, smothering the
flames with wet sails, beneath which they trampled out the fire.</p>

<p>The vessel was saved, and not one minute could have been spared.
In the wild uproar that followed, each one giving vent to the pent up
excitement of the moment, Mr. Wyville, turning in the crowd, met the
eyes of Haggett earnestly fixed on his face. He had often observed
his watchfulness before; but there was another meaning in his eyes
to-day.</p>

<p>Without a word Mr. Wyville put out his hand which Haggett grimly
seized.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"That's not right," said Haggett; "you have saved all our
lives."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville negatively shook his head, with his usual grave smile,
and was about to pass on. Mr. Haggett slowly let go his hand, still
looking at him with the same strange expression. They had parted a
few paces, when Haggett strode after Mr. Wyville with a new impulse,
seized his hand once more in a grip of iron, and met his eye with a
face working in strong emotion, every possible reef in his immense
lips quivering with suppressed feeling.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" he said; and without another word he dropped Mr.
Wyville's hand, turned, and strode off to his room by the other side
of the ship.</p>

<p>That night, when the excitement had died, and the usual quiet had
been restored, Mr. Wyville and Sheridan walked the poop for hours.
Mr. Wyville made no mention of Haggett's strange conduct.</p>

<p>Towards midnight they went to their rooms. The extra-ordinary
events of the day bad kept them from talking about Captain Draper,
though the subject had been for days uppermost in both minds.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wyville entered his room, his eyes fell on a letter,
fixed endwise on his table to attract his attention. It was addressed
to him. He opened it, and took out a photograph--the portrait of a
convict in chains. There was no other enclosure.</p>

<p>On the back of it were written these words, in Mr. Haggett's dated
four years back:--</p>

<p>"This is the only photograph of the man known as MOONDYNE. It was
taken in West Australia, just before his latest escape from Fremantle
Prison. All other photographs of this prisoner have unaccountably
disappeared from the prison books."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville gazed a long time at the strange present. Then he laid
it on the table, locked his door, and walked meditatively to and fro
his narrow room. At times he would stop and take the picture from the
table, look at it with deep attention, while his lips moved as if he
were addressing it.</p>

<p>At last he took the portrait, tore it to pieces, and, opening the
window of his room, threw the pieces into the sea.</p>

<h2>DEAD SEA FRUIT.</h2>

<p>FROM the moment that Will Sheridan had recognized Draper in the
captain of the Houguemont, his mind was filled with an acute fear
that Alice Walmsley might suddenly come face to face with the wretch
who had blighted her existence. Such a meeting might be fatal--it
certainly would be grievous.</p>

<p>It was the sudden touch of this fear that made Sheridan walk so
quickly to his room on the night of the recognition. It came like a
flash; and he deemed it best to consider his course of action
calmly.</p>

<p>Sailor as he was, he knew that the commander of a ship, usually
had absolute power over all on board. He had observed, however, that
Mr. Wyville, on one or two occasions, had assumed an authority in
certain matters relating to the prisoners. This gave him comfort. In
case Draper recognized Alice Walmsley on the ship, that instant,
Sheridan resolved, he would make known the whole terrible story to
Mr. Wyville, and avert intended evil, if possible by fear, if
necessary by force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sheridan saw Sister Cecilia, who knew that he was an
old friend of the innocent and much-wronged girl, and requested her
to keep Alice at all times off the main deck. He gave no reason for
the request.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Sheridan," said the nun, thinking of Alice's health,
"she must come into the open air some time."</p>

<p>"It were better not--better not," answered Sheridan, in a troubled
mind; "it were better that she should remain all day in the
hospital."</p>

<p>"In the hospital," repeated the wise little nun, with a pitying
smile. She evidently saw, more clearly than anyone on board, the
strange complications around her. The hearts of at least four of the
principal actors in the sorrowful drama were open to her eyes; she
saw the relations of Sheridan, Alice, the miserable Harriet Draper,
and her guilty husband.</p>

<p>But even Sister Cecilia, wise as she was, did not know that there
was a fifth heart deeply concerned in the play. As she repeated
Sheridan's words, her pitying smile died away into lines of sorrow,
seeing how blindly he would turn Alice's steps from one danger to a
deeper one. She recalled, too, at the word, the supreme desolation
and misery of that one who now spent her days in the hospital.</p>

<p>"Do not fear, Mr. Sheridan," she said, as she went on her way of
mercy, "Alice will be safe. She will remain in my hospital."</p>

<p>Taking this as an agreement with his request, Mr. Sheridan
resolved that his conduct towards the captain should be absolutely
reserved, until the vessel reached port. Then, what to do was beset
with difficulties. That dire punishment should overtake the villain
was clear; but what if his public arraignment would disturb the peace
of Alice, whose slowly healing wounds would thus be torn open?</p>

<p>Instead of coming to a decision, Sheridan resolved that on the
first opportunity he would lay the whole matter before Mr. Wyville,
and follow his advice.</p>

<p>Soon after entering the tropics, the Houguemont had caught the
trade winds, and sailed swiftly down the level seas. Her tall masts
dwindled pigmy-like as she passed beneath the awful shadow of
Teneriffe. Her sky-sails cut a line on the cliff a finger's breadth
from the sea; while above her towered into the air the twelve
thousand feet of tremendous pinnacle. She coasted the great
North-western bulge of Africa; and here, for the first time since
leaving England, her speed was checked, the trade winds faded and
died, the sea lost its ripples, but kept its waves, that rose and
fell slowly, with long monotonous rolls, like an ocean of molten
glass. The sails of the Houguemont slapped backwards and forwards,
the ropes hung useless, the pennant clung down the mast. The convict
ship was becalmed, off the coast of Africa, seven degrees above the
Line.</p>

<p>The faces of the ship's officers grew serious when the wind died.
They did not welcome a calm in such a latitude, and at that season.
The heat was intense and continuous, scarcely lowering by ten degrees
at night.</p>

<p>"I wish we were five degrees to the westward," said Sheridan to
Mr. Wyville, his old marine lore recurring to him; "I hate this Gulf
of Guinea."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mr. Wyville, standing in the shade of a sail, while
the young military officer sat beside Sheridan on the rail.</p>

<p>"I hate it first for its sharks--you can't dip your hand in this
water, for a thousand miles south and east, without having it snapped
off. I hate it for its low coast, where so many splendid ships have
sailed straight to destruction. I hate it for its siroccos,
whirlwinds, and, above all, I hate it for its fevers. I don't think
there's anything good about the coast of Guinea."</p>

<p>"That is a bad showing, certainly," said the military officer.</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's quite true," continued Sheridan. "No one can say a
good word about this coast."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, not so fast," said Mr. Wyville, smiling at
Sheridan's earnestness. "On this very coast, within two hundred miles
of us, is being solved one of the most interesting political problems
in human history. Yonder lies a settlement with a national story
unequalled for dignity and pathos."</p>

<p>Sheridan and the young soldier looked up, astonished.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>"The Republic of Liberia," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Sheridan looked at the soldier, who, at the same moment, looked at
him. They both smiled broadly, confessing their ignorance.</p>

<p>"I was too busy with sandalwood--" began Sheridan.</p>

<p>"And I with tactics," said the soldier, "But what is this
Republic, sir?"</p>

<p>"A new country, honestly acquired," said Mr. Wyville; the only
country on earth not torn by force from its rightful owners. A
country where slaves have peacefully founded a nation of elevated
freedom; where black men have faced God in manly dignity, and
declared their right to wipe out the scriptural curse; whose
citizenship is an honour to the holder, and whose citizens are an
honour to mankind."</p>

<p>"Who are the citizens?" asked the surprised officer.</p>

<p>"Slaves from America!" said Wyville, with an earnestness that made
them forget the heat; "men who bear on their bodies the marks of the
lash, and on their minds the rust of accursed laws; men who might be
pardoned for hating their kind. God bless them and," as he spoke, he
looked away in the direction of the land; "the kindest and most
amiable race on earth. They have carried with them from the great
Republic of the West only that which was good--its first principles.
Its unrepublican practices they have left behind."</p>

<p>"Will they not become corrupt?" asked Sheridan. "When?" "When they
become rich," said the officer innocently. "It is to be feared,"
answered Mr. Wyville. "But they have one safeguard." "What is that?"
"Their climate is deadly to white men," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>The appearance of Captain Draper, coming from his stateroom,
interrupted the conversation. The young officer stopped to chat with
him, while Mr. Wyville and Sheridan walked to the other side of the
poop.</p>

<p>"There are two powers of government represented on this ship,"
said Sheridan, determined to bring the conversation to the point he
wished to speak about: "which is in command--the civil or military?
The captain of the vessel, or the military officer?"</p>

<p>"Neither."</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"When convicts sail from England, they are assumed to be at once
in the penal colony. As soon as the convict ship leaves land, she
becomes subject to the penal law of West Australia."</p>

<p>"Who administers the law on board?"</p>

<p>"The representative of the Comptroller-General of Convicts, the
actual authority over the criminals in West Australia."</p>

<p>"Then we have a representative of the Comptroller-General on
board?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Wyville; you speak riddles to-day. You said a
moment ago that every convict ship had such a representative."</p>

<p>"Yes; unless it have the Comptroller himself."</p>

<p>"Then we have--Are you the Comptroller-General?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The office was vacant, and, at the request of the Prime
Minister, I accepted a temporary appointment. I am glad it was
offered; for it will enable me to see our new law fairly
started."</p>

<p>The evening had closed in as they convened, and now the shade
became somewhat tolerable. Mr. Wyville and Sheridan had drawn their
deck chairs towards the wheel-house."</p>

<p>"I am glad there is a power on board above that of the scoundrel
who commands the ship," said Sheridan, sternly, after a long pause.
Then he continued rapidly: "Mr. Wyville, I have feared every day that
I should have to strangle the wretch; I should have told you before,
but something always prevented. By some strange fatality there is on
board this ship a woman whom I have loved all my life, and who has
been mortally wronged by this man. I have come on this ship only to
protect her."</p>

<p>Sheridan's lowered voice was husky with deep emotion. Having said
so much, he remained silent.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had been looking out on the glassy and slow roll of
the waves. As Sheridan spoke, his lips and mouth closed with a
gradual compression, and a light almost of alarm came into his eyes.
He was thinking of Alice Walmsley.</p>

<p>"You have loved her all your life," he repeated slowly, still
looking, at the sea.</p>

<p>"Since I was a boy--and she loved me once."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was about to speak; but it seemed as if he changed his
mind. Still his lips moved, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Who is she, and where?" he said, after a pause, and in his usual
calm voice.</p>

<p>"She is a prisoner," answered Sheridan; "and she is confined in
the hospital."</p>

<p>"In the hospital!" cried Wyville, starting to his feet, with
almost a cry of joy then, seeing Sheridan's face, he controlled
himself.</p>

<p>"That unhappy one?</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sheridan, sadly, thinking, that so he described Alice
Walmsley.</p>

<p>"God help you, my friend! yours is a terrible grief."</p>

<p>"I have feared that he would see her, or that she might see
him."</p>

<p>"Fear no more," said Wyville, tenderly; "I have taken measures to
prevent such a meeting."</p>

<p>"You knew, then?" asked Sheridan, surprised.</p>

<p>"I knew his guilt--but not your sorrow. I knew that he and she
were on this ship. It was I who brought him here; and I had
beforehand secured her confinement during the voyage in the
hospital."</p>

<p>Sheridan was surprised at this, having so lately spoken to Sister
Cecilia on the subject. But he set it down to the customary
thoughtfulness of Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak my gratitude to you," continued Sheridan; "your
visit to her prison awakened in her the life that wrong and grief had
crushed. I know the whole story, and I have longed to speak my
gratitude."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville deemed that Sheridan referred to his visit to Harriet
Draper in Walton-le-Dale. But how could Sheridan have discovered it?
He had certainly never communicated with Harriet Draper.</p>

<p>"How did you learn of my visit to her?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"From the governor of Millbank."</p>

<p>"Ah-yes; I told him."</p>

<p>Sheridan felt a great relief from this confidence. He asked Mr.
Wyville's advice as to his conduct towards Draper during the voyage,
and was glad to find that it coincided with his own view; to treat
him with cold neutrality until the Houguemont had landed her
passengers and had ceased to be a government ship.</p>

<p>When Sheridan had gone to his room, Mr. Wyville remained on deck
alone. His heart was strangely happy that night, though he was
oppressed by the grief of his friend. For one moment he had feared
that the next would crush to death something that had grown within
him like a new and sweeter life. As he recalled the scene, his heart
stood still with the fear, even in fantasy.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he murmured, as he watched the moon rise, red and
large, on the sultry horizon. "One blow has been spared!"</p>

<h2>THE FEVER.</h2>

<p>MR. HAGGETT at first had found himself a lonely man on the convict
ship. His position was anomalous. He was neither a minister nor a
prison officer. Had he been the former, the ship's officers and the
military officers would have taken him into their mess; had he been
the latter, the convict officials would have been his companions. But
he was only a hired drudge, a non-professional. He was called simply
"the Scripture-reader."</p>

<p>So he was thrown for companionship on the two other lonely
passengers, Ben Lodge and Ngarra-jil, who were glad of his company,
and entirely ignorant of his position.</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett's nature was by no means a bad one; indeed, in other
circumstances it would have been an admirable one. He was simply one
of those persons who make up the million, who are common vessels to
hold that which is put into them. He was a queer mixture of zeal and
conceit. His mind had two keys, as a sparrow has only two notes, and
these were earnestness and vanity.</p>

<p>Had he been trained as a mechanic, he would have patiently
mastered his trade, never improving on what he bad been taught; and
he would have been vain of his skill, and faithful to it.</p>

<p>To give such a man a field of metaphysical labour, to put into his
callow bands the absolute spiritual control of hundreds of lives in
need of wise spiritual guidance, was an experiment far more injurious
to poor Haggett than to the convicts. It is so always. A priest's
vestments are too great for small natures, which they injure, if they
do not destroy.</p>

<p>He became puffed up with an absurd wind of conceit, that almost
amounted to real character; while the convicts, heedless before, only
confirmed their opinion that Christianity was a wordy and stiff
profession rather than a true saving principle.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wyville humiliated Haggett in Millbank, the blow appeared
terrible; but in truth it only struck Haggett where he was puffed. As
a man might cut a balloon with a sharp sword, Mr. Wyville's
interference and authority had gashed the swelling vanity of the
Scripture-reader.</p>

<p>From that day, though he afterwards set out to do Sir Joshua
Hobb's dirty work, Mr. Haggett had changed--he was gradually
returning to his real nature, which was, as it ought to be,
humble.</p>

<p>"This is a good man," something within him kept saying of Mr.
Wyville; "why are you his enemy?" And the answer came, and repeated
itself: "Because you are Sir Joshua Hobb's tool."</p>

<p>These thoughts floated through Haggett's mind on his first visit
to Australia; and that they had an effect on his conduct was certain.
Vague hints and doubts and clews, which Sir Joshua would have been
eager to seize, Haggett indeed had found, but had kept to
himself.</p>

<p>Since the Houguemont sailed he had been especially disturbed in
mind. When the incident of the fire came, and he spoke his mind to
Mr. Wyville in the hurried words, "Forgive me!" it was not a sudden
thought. But it was overwhelming. As a dam may tremble for years,
especially in time of storm, and go down at last with a rush, so the
last barrier of Haggett's vanity broke that day, and left the
reservoir of his conceit dry and unsightly to himself.</p>

<p>A man suffers deeply who has to turn an inward eye on such a
scene. But an honest man, helped by humility, will do it, and
survive; and at bottom Haggett was honest and humble.</p>

<p>He did not appear on deck for days after the fire; and when he did
come out, he spent his time in strange fashion. He would hang around
the passage to Sister Cecilia's quarters for hours; and when the
little nun was on her way to the female convicts, the ungainly
Scripture-reader would start from some unexpected angle, and watch
for an opportunity to offer some service.</p>

<p>This continued for weeks, until at last Sister Cecilia noticed the
attention. She quietly bowed her head one day in thanks for some
slight favour; and for the rest of the day Mr. Haggett's face was
lined with good humour and gratification. .</p>

<p>When the ship was becalmed in the tropics, the suffering of the
imprisoned wretches in the steaming and crowded hold was piteous to
see. They were so packed that free movement was impossible. The best
thing to do was to sit each on his or her berth, and suffer in
patience.</p>

<p>The air was stifling and oppressive. There was no draught through
the barred hatches. The deck above them was blazing hot. The pitch
dropped from the seams, and burned their flesh as it fell.</p>

<p>There was only one word spoken or thought-one yearning idea
present in every mind-water, cool water to slake the parching
thirst.</p>

<p>Two pints of water a day were served out to each convict--a quart
of half-putrid and blood-warm liquid. It was a woeful sight to see
the thirsty souls devour this allowance as soon as their hot hands
seized the vessel.</p>

<p>Day in and day out, the terrible calm held the ship, and the
consuming heat sapped the lives of the pent-up convicts. They
suffered in strange patience. The hold was silent all day. They made
no complaints. When the officers passed among them, and spoke to
them, they smiled and sat still on their berths.</p>

<p>Only once, there was a sound of discontent; when the order was
given that the daily allowance of water be reduced to one pint.</p>

<p>Among the officers of the ship, there was silence also. They knew
they were in a latitude where calms lasted for long periods. They
flushed the decks with water constantly, to try and keep them cool,
for the sake of the prisoners below.</p>

<p>"We shall need fresh water in a week," said Captain Draper to Mr.
Wyville one day; "the tanks are low already, and evaporation rapidly
increases."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville did not answer, except with an inclination of the
head. Words were useless.</p>

<p>"Where is the nearest land?" he asked Sheridan that afternoon, as
they paced the poop.</p>

<p>"The island of Principe is about 200 miles to the south," said
Sheridan. "There is good water there."</p>

<p>The thought in Mr. Wyville's mind never came to words. As Sheridan
spoke, he stopped suddenly, looking away to the north, and pointing
his hand with an eager face. A dark line, very faint, was moving on
the face of the glassy ocean.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" he said, "yonder comes the breeze."</p>

<p>In half an hour it fanned their faces, but so gently that still
the sails hung useless, and the pennant only stirred an inch from the
mast. But it was a breath--it was a drink. When the night fell, the
breeze strengthened, and the ship moved.</p>

<p>There was no sleep on board that night. The hearts of all were
filled with deep relief and gratitude. The breeze held for four days,
growing steadier as they sailed. On the evening of the fourth day, a
man aloft cried out, "Land ho!"</p>

<p>They had sighted Principe. From deck, the land was not seen for an
hour later; and the Houguemont stood off and on till morning, when
boats would be sent ashore for water.</p>

<p>At the first flush of dawn the ship was steered towards the
island. A fog lay close to the water, and the eager eyes of the
voyagers only saw a line of wooded mountain, the base and summit of
which were rolled in mist.</p>

<p>The Houguemont sailed into the fog-bank; and before those on board
had time to realize the change, her foresails caught the sunshine,
and she swung to within a land-locked harbour as beautiful as a dream
of Paradise.</p>

<p>The water broke against the wooded shores all round the lovely
haven. The hills were covered with trees to the top, and the cocoa
palms crowded their lower slopes to the very shore. At the end of the
harbour stood the little town of St. Antonio.</p>

<p>The Houguemont came to anchor, and boats were sent ashore to fill
the water-casks. The Swift, clear streams were seen running into the
beautiful basin of the port.</p>

<p>While this work was going on, a sail-boat put off from the town,
and held towards the vessel. There were three men in it, and as they
came within hail of ship, keeping to leeward, they ran up a yellow
flag.</p>

<p>"My God!" said Sheridan, who had been watching the boat; "they
have the fever!"</p>

<p>"Get out as fast as you can," cried a man in the boat. "And be
sure you allow no one from shore near the ship. We have the plague in
St. Antonio."</p>

<p>Without another Word, the boat's course was changed, and she
returned to the town. The crew of the Houguemont needed no incentive
to work. By ten o'clock that night the casks were filled and the ship
was under sail.</p>

<p>"A fortunate escape!" said the medical officer to Sheridan, who
did not answer, but looked at the pennant. The wind had changed, and
was blowing directly from St. Antonio.</p>

<p>Next morning, the beautiful island was out of sight. The convicts
got plenty of water that day, and their hearts were glad. Towards
evening, one of the warders went to the doctor's room, and said there
was a prisoner very ill, who complained of nausea and pains in the
head and shoulders. The doctor's face grew pale at the word; but he
turned away from the warder.</p>

<p>"Take that man on deck at once," he said, quietly, "and place him
in the punishment division forward."</p>

<p>The warder went to carry out the order. The doctor hurriedly
consulted a book, then left his room and walked forward.</p>

<p>The sick prisoner was there before him. The doctor examined him,
quietly ordered his treatment, and retired. He joined Mr. Wyville on
the poop.</p>

<p>"We have the fever on board," he said in a low voice. "A man has
been attacked by the worst symptoms."</p>

<p>An hour later two more convicts complained of sickness.</p>

<p>They were taken from the hold and placed in the cell forward.</p>

<p>Next day it was known throughout the ship that the fever which the
sailors and convicts called "the black vomit," was on board; and
before nightfall thirty prisoners were seized.</p>

<p>The sick were taken away from the hold at first; but this
separation had soon to be abandoned. There was no room for them
apart. The hospital was full. Those who took the fever had to be side
by side with their terror-stricken fellows.</p>

<p>Like an angel of comfort, Sister Cecilia tended on the sufferers.
Following her steps, and quietly obeying her word, went Mr. Haggett.
In the female compartment, where twelve prisoners lay with the fever,
Alice Walmsley moved ceaselessly in the work of mercy.</p>

<p>On the third day, the chief officer of the ship said to Mr.
Wyville--</p>

<p>"Captain Draper has the fever."</p>

<p>The doctor, shortly after, came from the captain's room, and
reported that Draper had, indeed, been seized, but with symptoms of
less virulence than the others.</p>

<p>"Who will attend on Captain Draper?" asked the doctor. "He will be
unconscious in another hour, and will need care."</p>

<p>"I will attend him," said Mr. Wyville, after a pause; "write your
directions, doctor, and I will stay beside him to-night."</p>

<h2>HUSBAND AND WIFE.</h2>

<p>HIDEOUS incidents filled the days and nights as the convict ship
sailed southward with her burden of disease and death. The mortality
among the convicts was frightful. Weakened and depressed by the long
drought, the continuous heat, and the poisonous atmosphere, they
succumbed to the fever in its first stages.</p>

<p>The dead were laid in a row on the port side, as they were carried
from the hold. Relays of sailors worked at the shrouding and burial.
The bodies were wrapped in sail-cloth with a cannon ball tied at the
feet. As each corpse was hastily shrouded, it was passed forward, and
the ghastly roll was committed to the deep.</p>

<p>There was no time for ceremony; but Mr. Haggett, as often as he
could be spared from the hold, stood beside the opening in the rail,
where the bodies were launched, and followed each dull plunge with a
word of prayer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," said Mr. Wyville, as he came from Captain Draper's
room on the first night of his illness, "will you take command of the
ship until the captain's recovery?"</p>

<p>Sheridan assented; and Mr. Wyville, calling the ship's officers to
the poop, instructed them to obey Captain Sheridan as the commander
of the vessel.</p>

<p>As soon as Sheridan took command, he spread every inch of canvas
the ship could carry, and held her before the wind.</p>

<p>"We shall shake off this fever when we clear the Southern
tropics," he said to Mr. Wyville. "The cold wind round the Cape will
kill it in an hour."</p>

<p>Captain Draper lay in his stateroom, half comatose, muttering
incoherent words in the low delirium of the fever. By his side sat
Mr. Wyville, giving him now and again the medicines prescribed.</p>

<p>The sick man's face was a ghastly sight. The offensiveness of the
protruding, eyes and cracked lips was hideously exaggerated. And as
he lay smouldering in the slow fire of the sickness, he muttered
things even more repulsive than his physical appearance.</p>

<p>The female hospital of the ship was filled with sufferers, indeed,
the entire hold of the vessel was at once an hospital and
charnel-house. There were no regular attendants among the male
convicts, those who had not been attacked waited on those who had,
till their own turn came.</p>

<p>In the female compartment, which was separated from the regular
hospital, Alice Walmsley had entire charge. Her healthy life enabled
her to bear an extraordinary strain; day and night she was
ministering to the stricken, and they blessed her with words and
looks as she passed from sufferer to sufferer.</p>

<p>The door leading thence to the hospital Sister Cecilia kept
locked, and she herself carried the key.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia stood one day within the hospital, at the door of a
small room. Kneeling before her, on the floor, with streaming eyes
and upraised hands, as if praying for a life, was a woman, in the
grey dress of a convict.</p>

<p>"O, for God's sake let me tend them! O, don't deny me--let me go
and wait on the poor sufferers. My heart is breaking when I think
that I might be doing some good. Don't refuse--O, don't refuse me. I
feel that God would pardon me if I could work out my life caring for
others."</p>

<p>It was Harriet Draper who supplicated the nun, and who had
besought her for days with the same ceaseless cry. Sister Cecilia
would gladly have allowed her to work for the sick, but she feared
that Alice would see her. She had been compelled for days to refuse
the heartrending petition.</p>

<p>"You shall have your wish," said the nun, this day, with a kind
look at Harriet, "but not in the hospital."</p>

<p>"Anywhere, anywhere!" cried Harriet, rising with a wistful face;
"only let me tend someone who is sick. I want to do some good."</p>

<p>"Harriet," said Sister Cecilia, "you have told me your unhappy
story, and I am sure you wish to be a good woman!"</p>

<p>"I do--God knows I do!" interrupted the unfortunate one.</p>

<p>"As you hope to be forgiven, you must forgive--you must forgive
even your husband."</p>

<p>Poor Harriet covered her face in her hands, and made no answer,
only moved her head from side to side, as if in pain.</p>

<p>"Harriet, if your husband were on board this ship, sick and dying
of the fever, would you not tend him and forgive him before he
died?"</p>

<p>Wild-eyed, the woman stared at Sister Cecilia, as if she had not
understood the question.</p>

<p>"He is on board--he is dying of the fever--will you not take care
of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh--oh!" wailed Harriet, in a long cry, sinking on her knees and
clasping Sister Cecilia's dress. "He would drive me away--he would
not let me stay there--he does not love me!"</p>

<p>"But you love him--you will tend him, and you will forgive him.
Will you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will--I will wait on him day and night, and he shall
recover with my nursing."</p>

<p>She dried her weeping eyes, to show the Sister her immediate
readiness and calmness.</p>

<p>"Take me to him," she said, with only quivering lips; "let me
begin now."</p>

<p>"Come, then" said Sister Cecilia; and she led Harriet Draper to
the hatch, and aft to the captain's quarters.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville rose as Sister Cecilia entered, followed by Harriet.
As he did so, the sick man moved, and muttered something, with
upraised feeble arm.</p>

<p>With a low sob or cry, Harriet darted past Sister Cecilia, and
sank beside the bed. She took the upraised arm and drew it to her
breast, and covered the feverish hand with tearful kisses. At the
touch, the sick man ceased to wander, and turning his head, seemed to
fall at once into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>Harriet, seeing this, after her first emotion, turned to Mr.
Wyville and Sister Cecilia with a smile of Joy, and, still holding,
her husband's arm to her breast, pointed to his restful sleep. They
smiled at her in return, though their eyes were brimming with
tears.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia instructed her as to the attendance, and then
withdrew, leaving the guilty and unconscious husband in his wife's
care. There was joy at least in one heart on board that night. From
her low seat beside the bed, Harriet Draper watched his face,
murmuring soft and endearing words, and obeying the doctor's
instructions to the letter and second.</p>

<p>"He will recover, and he will know me," she whispered to her
heart; "I shall win back his love by--being faithful and
forgiving."</p>

<p>The climax of the fever would not come till the sixth day and
during these days Harriet watched her husband with scarcely an hour's
rest. Every hour that passed added to his chance of recovery, as the
ship was sailing swiftly towards the cooler latitudes.</p>

<p>One day, while Harriet sat beside the bed, holding the feeble
hand, as she loved to do, there came a lucid interval to her husband.
She had been murmuring soft words as she kissed his hand, when,
looking at his face, she met his eyes fixed upon her. For a moment
there came a light of recognition and dismay in his look; but before
she could speak his name, or recall his memory the light faded, and
he reverted to a state of sluggish delirium.</p>

<p>For the first time since she came to his side, a chill of fear
pierced Harriet's heart. For one instant she knew he had seen her.
But there was no love in the look of recognition. What if the same
cold stare should return on his recovery, and continue?</p>

<p>"God will not let it be" whispered her heart. "When he recovers,
he will surely love me as of old!"</p>

<h2>WOMAN'S LOVE AND HATRED.</h2>

<p>ON the later days of Captain Draper's illness he moaned and
tumbled restlessly. One of the worst symptoms of the fever was its
persistent hold on the brain. The sick man raved constantly, carried
on excited conversations, gave orders to the sailors, and, in the
midst of these wanderings, again and again reverted to one dark
subject that seemed to haunt his inflamed mind.</p>

<p>He lived over and over again, day after day, terrible scenes, that
had surely been rehearsed in his mind before the sickness. In his
fantasy he was standing by the rail of the ship, while a boat was
slowly lowered, in which sat Sheridan. As the boat swung over the
raging sea, suspended by a rope at bow and stern, the bow rope
parted, the boat fell perpendicularly, and Sheridan was flung into
the ocean, and drowned.</p>

<p>During this series of mental pictures, the action of the raving
man plainly showed that his hand had cut the rope; and his exultation
at the completion of the murder was horrible to see. He would turn
his face to the partition, away from the light, and chuckle with a
vile sound, rubbing his hands in devilish delight.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Wyville sat beside the bed, intending to relieve the
tireless Harriet for a few hours. But Harriet still lingered in the
room.</p>

<p>Draper had gone once more through the hideous pantomime,
accompanying every act with words expressing the baleful intention.
Mr. Wyville sat regarding him with compressed lips. When the horrible
culmination had come, and the wretch chuckled over his success, Mr.
Wyville looked up and met Harriet's fearful gaze.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" whispered Draper, "he was always in my way. I meant
it always--but this was the best plan. Ha! ha! better than pistol or
poison--accident--ha! ha! drowned by accident!"</p>

<p>"Do you know of whom be speaks?" asked Mr. Wyville of Harriet.</p>

<p>"A man named Sheridan," she answered; he talks of him a great
deal."</p>

<p>"A man named Sheridan!" repeated Mr. Wyville to himself. "She
speaks as if she did not know him."</p>

<p>He sat silent for a time, his eyes fixed on the guilty man before
him, who was unconsciously laying bare the foul secrets of his heart.
At last he turned to Harriet and said--</p>

<p>"Do you not know this man named Sheridan?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The answer surprised him, and he became silent again. Presently he
sent Harriet to her rest.</p>

<p>"I do not see the end," he wearily murmured, when he was alone
with the sick man; "but I forebode darkly. Providence has kept this
miscreant from a deeper crime than he has yet committed. Heaven grant
that he has also been preserved for repentance and atonement!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had resolved to be at Draper's side when the hour of
sanity returned, and to keep his unfortunate wife out of sight until
he had prepared him for her presence.</p>

<p>It was midnight when that moment arrived. Draper had slept soundly
for several hours. Mr. Wyville first knew that he had returned to
consciousness by the movement of his hands. Presently he spoke, in a
feeble voice.</p>

<p>"I have been sick, haven't I? How many days?"</p>

<p>"Six days."</p>

<p>"Are we still becalmed?</p>

<p>"No; we are in the Southern trades."</p>

<p>Draper said no more. He moved his head from side to side, trying
to look around the room. Mr. Wyville remained still and silent.</p>

<p>"Have you been here with me?" he asked, at length. "You couldn't
have been here all the time."</p>

<p>"Not all the time."</p>

<p>"I suppose I spoke aloud, and--and--raved about people?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville looked suddenly at him, and caught the reptilian eye
that watched the effect of the question. He was impelled to speak
sooner than he had intended, by the cunning of the fellow.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, keeping his powerful look on Draper's face, as if
he addressed his inner soul as well as outward sense; "you have told
the whole villainous purpose of your heart. If you recover, you may
thank God for striking you with sickness to keep you from murder and
the murderer's doom. Had you carried out your design, nothing could
have saved you; for there are others here who knew your history and
your motive."</p>

<p>Draper did not answer, but lay like a scotched snake, perfectly
still, hardly breathing, but watching Mr. Wyville with a cold
eye.</p>

<p>"Do you know who has nursed you through your sickness?"</p>

<p>Draper moved his head negatively.</p>

<p>"Would you like to know?"</p>

<p>He only looked more keenly at Mr. Wyville, but there was a light
of alarm in the look.</p>

<p>"You have been cared for by one whom you have blighted who owed
you nothing but curses. Day and night she has been with you, and she
has saved your life."</p>

<p>Still Draper did not move or speak, but only looked.</p>

<p>"You know of whom I speak," said Mr. Wyville; "are you ready now
to meet your unhappy wife, and to ask her forgiveness?"</p>

<p>He had risen as he spoke--Draper's eyes followed his face. The
strength of manhood, even of facial deceit, having been drained by
the fever, there was nothing left of Draper's real self but his wily
nature.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wyville rose, the door opened slowly, and Harriet entered,
advanced a few steps, and stood still in fear. She looked at her
husband's face; for one instant his cold eye from Mr. Wyville and
took her in, then returned to its former direction.</p>

<p>Harriet's heart seemed to stop beating. A cold and despairing
numbness began to creep over her. She foresaw the nature of the
meeting--she knew now what would be her reception. Her limbs slowly
failed her, and she sank on the floor, not heavily, but hopelessly
and dumb. Mr. Wyville, hearing the slight sound, turned, and read the
story of despair like an open page. With a rush of indignation in his
blood, almost a mounting to wrath, he regarded Draper.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, sternly, "your guilt is known. You still have
one chance to escape the punishment you deserve. It lies in her
hands."</p>

<p>He turned from the bed, and left the room. Draper lay motionless
for several minutes, knowing that his victim and wife was grovelling
in the room, waiting for his word.</p>

<p>"Come here," he said at length, in a voice all the colder for its
weakness.</p>

<p>Harriet crept to the bed, and laid her head near his hand. But he
did not touch her.</p>

<p>"I want to see you," he said.</p>

<p>The poor woman raised her miserable face until their eyes met.
Hers were streaming with bitter tears. His were as cold and dry as a
snake's. She would have cried out his name but the freezing glitter
of his eyes shivered her impulse, and fixed her in terrified
fascination.</p>

<p>"You and he!" he said slowly, as if thinking aloud, "And after
all, you would have been left. And so, I'm in your power at
last?"</p>

<p>It was appalling to see the lips, the wasted lower face of
the man twist into a smile, while the serpent glance above was
intensified.</p>

<p>Poor Harriet sank down slowly, the slow shudder creeping over her
once more. Her blood had ceased to course in her veins at the cruel
reception. She had no thoughts: she only felt there was no hope for
her.</p>

<p>The first love of some women is mysteriously tenacious. It ceases
to be a passion, and becomes a principle of life. It is never
destroyed until life ceases. It may change into a torture--it may
become excited like a white-hot iron, burning the heart it binds; or
it may take on a lesser fire, and change into red hatred; but it
never grows cold--it never loses its power to command at a thrill the
deepest motives of her nature.</p>

<p>Through all phases but one had passed the love of Harriet Draper.
She knew that her husband was a villain, that her hideous degradation
had come from his hand; that he hated her now and would be rid of
her; and the knowledge had only changed her love to a torture without
killing it.</p>

<p>But the change from white heat to fierce red is not infinite. It
is a transition rapidly made. At the white heat, the woman's love
burns herself; at the red, it burns the man she loves. A woman's
hatred is only her love on fire.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was you," said Draper, making no pretence to
deceive her; "I thought you were dead years ago."</p>

<p>Something stirred in Harriet's heart at the emphasis--something
like a grain of resentment. She had forgotten self; she now thought
of herself, and of what she had gone through for this man's sake.</p>

<p>"How did you come here?" he asked. "Did--he bring you here? Oh,
curse you, you've got me in the trap. Well, we'll see."</p>

<p>"I have made no trap," said Harriet; "no one brought me here but
myself and--you. I am a prisoner."</p>

<p>Draper was evidently surprised at this news; but it only
momentarily checked his rancour.</p>

<p>"I suppose you robbed someone, or mur--?" As he spoke, Harriet
struggled to her knees with a pitiful gulping sound, and clutched at
the bedclothes, trying to gain her feet. Draper looked at her a
moment and then continued slowly--</p>

<p>"I suppose you robbed someone, or murdered--" With a spring like a
tiger, and a terrible low cry, Harriet was on her feet, the coverlet
in her clenched hands, her flaming eyes on her husband's face.</p>

<p>"Dare!" she hissed, "and I will tear the tongue from your cruel
mouth!"</p>

<p>For half a minute the two regarded each other. In that half
minute, the white heat of Harriet's love became red. Hitherto, she
had hated the one for whom Draper had deserted her, and had hated
herself. Now, for the first time, she hated him.</p>

<p>"Villain! monster!" she cried, throwing the coverlet from her with
fierce revulsion; "you speak of murder to the murderess you made? Oh,
God, God! is there no lightning to strike this man dead! Murder I
have done in madness"--she paused with upraised hands, as if she saw
a vision--"Oh, merciful God! that innocent one!"</p>

<p>Harriet staggered across the room at the first dreadful thought of
the bitter suffering endured by another for her crime. She had
partially repented, it is true; but, secretly, she knew that she had
never pitied her rival. Now, she could have suddenly died with grief
for her wrong.</p>

<p>Harriet did not know that a strong hand upheld her as she fell,
and supported her from the room. She recovered in the open air, and
looked about her as if awakening from a terrible dream. Sister
Cecilia came and led her back to her old solitary quarters in the
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville and the doctor stood beside Draper's bed. He had
swooned.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor; "he has come out of the fever quite strong.
He will recover, unless something unforeseen interfere. He is out of
danger."</p>

<h2>THE DARKNESS OF DESOLATION</h2>

<p>THE recovery of Captain Draper was regarded as a good omen by the
sailors and convicts; and with a return of confidence to them the
fever daily declined.</p>

<p>The average of recoveries grew larger, and there were few new
seizures.</p>

<p>From the day of his interview with Harriet, Draper saw her no
more. Neither did he see Mr. Wyville. The steward alone attended him.
He was forced to ponder on the future, and every new possibility was
harder to accept than the last. During those days of convalescence,
his coward soul preyed upon by his villainous imagination, Draper
suffered almost the torments of the damned.</p>

<p>When the heartbroken Harriet recovered from the excitement of the
dreadful interview, her soul had only one feeling--remorse. As one
dying of thirst might sit down on the burning sand, and commune with
the devouring fire in the body, so this unhappy one sat upon her
pallet in the hospital room, and communed for hours with the
newly-lighted consuming fire in her soul.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Wyville entered the hospital, with the physician. He
approached Harriet, and spoke in a low tone, such as he had used when
addressing her once before.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, at first; but, as she continued to
gaze, there rose in her mind a recollection that brought the blood
strongly from her heart. She clasped her hands beseechingly.</p>

<p>"I thought I had dreamt it in the cell--I did not know that it was
real. Oh, sir, did you not come to me and speak blessed words of
comfort? Did you not say that he was guilty of part of my crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was I who visited you in Walton-le-Dale. I come now to
say the same words--to ask you to save the innocent one who has borne
your penalty."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, it is not too late! This moment let me do what is
to be done. Oh, Sir, I know now the whole of my crime--I never saw it
till this day. I never pitied her nor thought of her; but now, when I
could ask for even God's pardon, I dare not ask for hers."</p>

<p>Seeing Harriet in this repentant mind, Mr. Wyville lost no time in
having her confession formally taken down and witnessed. This done,
he spoke comforting words to Harriet, who, indeed, was relieved by
the confession, and felt happier than she had been for years.
Assembling the officers of the convict service in the cabin,
immediately afterwards, Mr. Wyville took his first step as
Comptroller-General, by announcing that Alice Walmsley was no longer
a prisoner, that her innocence had been fully established by the
confession of the real criminal, and that henceforth she was to be
treated respectfully as a passenger.</p>

<p>When this news was given to Sister Cecilia, she almost lost her
placid self-control in an outburst of happiness. But she controlled
herself, and only wept for very gladness. Then she started up, and
almost ran towards her secluded room, to break the tidings to
Alice.</p>

<p>Alice was sewing when Sister Cecilia entered. She had acquired a
habit of sewing during her long solitary confinement, and now she was
happiest while working at a long seam. She smiled pleasantly as
Sister Cecilia entered.</p>

<p>The kind little nun almost regretted that she bore news that would
break the calm stream of Alice's life. She was happy as she was;
would she be happier under better circumstances? Would the awakened
memories counterbalance or sink the benefit?</p>

<p>"Good news, Alice!"</p>

<p>Alice looked up from her sewing inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Is the fever over at last?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Better than that, my child," said Sister Cecilia, sitting clown
beside her, and putting an arm around her with tender affection. "I
have special good news, that will gladden every kind heart on the
ship. One of our prisoners, who has been in prison a long time, has
been proved innocent, and has been made free by order of the
Comptroller-General!"</p>

<p>As Sister Cecilia spoke, she still embraced Alice, and looked down
at her face. But there was no perceptible change, except a slight
contraction of the brow-muscles denoting awakened interest.</p>

<p>"And she, who was a poor prisoner an hour ago, is now a respected
passenger on the Queen's ship!" continued Sister Cecilia, lightly;
but in truth she was alarmed at Alice's calmness.</p>

<p>"It is a woman, then?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; a woman who has been nine years in prison, suffering
for another's crime. And that other has confessed--Alice! Alice!"
cried Sister Cecilia, dismayed at the effect of her words. But Alice
did not hear; she had slipped from her seat, pale as marble,
fainting; and were it not for the supporting arms of the nun she
would have fallen headlong to the floor.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia did not alarm anyone; she was experienced in
emotional climaxes. She did the few things proper for the moment,
then quietly awaited Alice's recovery.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the pale face was raised, and the mild eyes
sought Sister Cecilia as if they asked a heartrending question. The
little Sister did not understand the appeal; so she only encouraged
Alice by a kind word to regain strength.</p>

<p>"And she!" whispered Alice, with quivering lips, now speaking what
she had looked; "where is she--the forsaken one?"</p>

<p>"She is on board, my child; she is a prisoner, and a most unhappy
one. She has no hope but the peace of atonement. God send her
comfort!</p>

<p>"Amen! Amen!" cried Alice, laying her head on the Sister's arm,
and sobbing without restraint.</p>

<h2>THE NEW PENAL LAW</h2>

<p>THERE being no female passengers in the cabin of the Houguemont,
it was decided that Alice Walmsley should remain in her room with
Sister Cecilia till the end of the voyage. The only change made was
in her dress, and this, by some strange foresight on the part of the
little Sister, as it seemed, was quite extensively and fittingly
provided for.</p>

<p>Alice selected the quietest possible dress, and when she stood
arrayed in it, after so many weary years in prison gray, she could
not help glancing at her face in the glass, and blushing as she
looked; and at this very pretty and womanly moment, Sister Cecilia
came upon her and gave a pleasant little laugh. Upon this, Alice
blushed deeper, and turned her confused face away, while Sister
Cecilia reached after it, and drawing it to the light kissed her
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Why, Alice," she said, with a provoking smile, "you are quite a
beauty."</p>

<p>Unquestionably, even a few days without the burden of bondage had
worked wonders in Alice's life. She was no longer moody; she
instantly and naturally began to take fresh interest in everything
she saw and heard around her.</p>

<p>The ship cleared the Tropics and raced down towards the Cape in
the vigorous Southern trades. The blustering winds and the rough sea
brought refreshment even to the feeble, and to Alice renewed
strength. Her face lost the pallor of confinement, and her step
became elastic. The years of her imprisonment had kept dormant the
energies that waste with exertion. She began to feel as youthful and
as cheerful as when she was a girl.</p>

<p>One day she was standing beside her open window, looking out on
the sea, when she plainly heard above her, on the poop deck, a voice
that held her rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>"I cannot forsee the result"--she heard these words--"but I shall
go on to the end. I have loved her clearly always; and I shall, at
least, prove it to her before the dream is dispelled."</p>

<p>Alice held herself to the window, not meaning to listen to the
words so much as to obey the strong prompting of her heart to hear
the honest ring of the voice.</p>

<p>It was Will Sheridan who spoke--he stood on the poop with Mr.
Wyville--and Alice knew the voice. After so many years, it came to
her like a message from her girlhood, and bridged over the chasm in
her life.</p>

<p>No other words reached her; but the conversation continued for a
long time; and still she stood beside the window, her cheek laid on
her hands, while she allowed the familiar tones to transport her back
to happy scenes.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia found her so, and playfully coaxed her to tell her
thoughts; but Alice's diffidence was so evident that the little nun
sat down and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>The voyage round the Cape had no special interest; and a few weeks
later the officers began their preparations for disembarkation. The
air grew balmy once more, and the sky cloudless.</p>

<p>"We are just three hundred miles from the mouth of the Swan
River," said Sheridan one day to Mr. Wyville, when he had taken his
observations. "Have you ever landed at Fremantle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once--many years ago," said Mr. Wyville, and he crossed the
deck to observe something in the sea.</p>

<p>Throughout the voyage, neither Sheridan nor Wyville had seen Alice
Walmsley. Each in his own mind deemed it best to leave her
undisturbed with Sister Cecilia. Mr. Wyville was still impressed with
the conviction of Sheridan's unhappy and hopeless affection for
Harriet; but he was much perplexed by her forgetfulness of his name.
However, when they reached Australia, one day ashore would clear up
matters without the pain of preliminary explanation.</p>

<p>Day after day, in the mild southern air, the ship glided slowly
on, and still the watchers on the crowded deck saw no Sign of land.
From morning light they leant on the rail, looking away over the
smooth sea to where the air was yellow with heat above the unseen
continent. There was a warmth and pleasure in the promise it
gave.</p>

<p>The straining eyes were saved the long pain of watching the
indistinct line. The shore of West Australia is quite low, and the
first sign of land are tall mahogany trees in the bush. The ship
passed this first sight-line early in the night; and next morning,
when the convicts were allowed on deck, they saw, only a few miles
distant, the white sand and dark woods of their land of bondage and
promise.</p>

<p>The sea was as smooth as a lake, and the light air impelled the
ship slowly. At noon they passed within a stone's throw of the island
of Rottenest, and every eye witnessed the strange sight of gangs of
naked black men working like beavers in the sand, the island being
used as a place of punishment for refractory natives.</p>

<p>An hour later, the ship had approached within a mile of the pier
at Fremantle. The surrounding sea and land were very strange and
beautiful. The green shoal-water, the soft air, with a yellowish
warmth, the pure white sand of the beach, and the dark green of the
unbroken forest beyond, made a scene almost like fairyland.</p>

<p>But there was a stern reminder of reality in the little town of
Fremantle that lay between the forest and the sea. It was built of
wooden houses, running down a gentle hill; and in the centre of the
houses, spread out like a gigantic star-fish, was a vast stone
prison.</p>

<p>There was a moment of bustle and noise on the deck, through which
rang the clear commanding voice of Sheridan, and next moment the
anchor plunged into the sea and the cable roared through the
hawse-hole. Every soul on board took a long breath of relief at the
end of the voyage.</p>

<p>A tug was seen coming from the wharf, the deck of which was
crowded. At its mast-head floated the Governor's flag. On the deck
was the Governor of the colony with his staff, and a host of convict
officers from the prison.</p>

<p>The tug steamed alongside, and the Governor came on board the
convict ship. He wore a blue tunic, with epaulettes like a naval
officer, white trousers, and a cocked hat. He greeted Mr. Wyville
with official welcome on account of his position, and warmly
expressed his admiration of his philanthropy.</p>

<p>"I understand you bring us a new penal system," said the Governor.
"I hope it is a stronger one than that we have."</p>

<p>"It certainly is stronger," said Mr. Wyville, "for it is milder
and juster."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the Governor, who was a testy old general, "I
hope you won't spoil them. They need a stiff hand. Now, I suppose you
want those warders from the prison to get your crowd into order for
landing. Shall I order them on board?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had been looking down on the tug, observing the
officers, who were a rough crew, each one carrying, a heavy cane or
whip, as well as a pistol in the belt, and a sword. He turned with a
grave face to the Governor.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, I am sure, will see the wisdom of beginning with
our new code at once. We have here the best opportunity to emphasize
its first principles. Shall I proceed?"</p>

<p>"By all means, Sir; you have absolute control of your department.
I shall watch your method with interest."</p>

<p>At his order, the warders boarded the ship, formed in line, and
saluted. Mr. Wyville descended from the poop, and carefully inspected
them as they stood in rank.</p>

<p>"Go to the steward," he said to the chief warder, as he came to
the end of the line, "and get from him a large basket."</p>

<p>The man was astonished, but he promptly obeyed. In a minute he
returned with a capacious hamper.</p>

<p>"Begin on the right," said Mr. Wyville, in curt tones, "and place
in that hamper your pistols, swords, canes, and whips."</p>

<p>The warders scarcely believed their ears; but they obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now listen!" said Mr. Wyville, and his voice thrilled the warders
with its depth and earnestness. "I am going to read for you the new
law of this colony, of which you are the officers. Its first word is,
that if any of you strike or maltreat a prisoner, you shall be
arrested, discharged, and imprisoned."</p>

<p>The warders fairly gasped with astonishment. The old Governor, who
had listened attentively at first, opened his eyes wide, then nodded
his head in decided approval.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville read the heads of the new law, emphasizing the mild
points. As he proceeded, the faces of the warders lost all expression
but one of blank amazement. The entire meaning of the law was that
convicts were expected to rise from bad to good, rather than descend
from bad to worse. In other words, it was a law meant for
reformation, not for vengeance.</p>

<p>In passing along the line, Mr. Wyville's eye rested on a silver
medal worn by one of the warders. He looked at it keenly.</p>

<p>"What is that medal for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For the mutiny of two years ago," said the chief warder; "this
officer killed three mutineers."</p>

<p>"Take that medal off," said Mr. Wyville to the warder, "and never
put it on again. We are to have no more mutiny."</p>

<p>The warders were then dismissed from the rank, and instructed to
go below and get the convicts in order for disembarkation. As they
departed, Mr. Wyville gave them one word more.</p>

<p>"Remember, you are dealing with men, not with brutes--with men who
have rights and the protection of law."</p>

<p>When they had disappeared into the bold, the old Governor shook
Mr. Wyville warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>"By the lord Harry, sir, this is excellent," he said,
heartily.</p>

<p>"This d--d colony has been a menagerie long enough. If you succeed
with your system, we'll make it a civilized country at last."</p>

<h2>A PRISONER AT LARGE</h2>

<p>THE disembarkation of the convicts was a novel scene to them, and
to the officers directing their movements. The absence of shouting
and violence made it quite unprecedented to the warders. The convicts
reached the wharf on barges, and marched in single file up the little
street leading to the great gate of the prison of Fremantle.</p>

<p>Inside the gate, in the centre of an immense yard or walled sand
plain, the Governor and Comptroller-General stood; and as the long
line of convicts filed by, each saluted in military fashion, and
passed on to the prison.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the last convict passed. The
Governor was about to leave the ground, when his attention was called
to one more stranger from the ship, who approached. It was Captain
Draper. He walked slowly, as if still feeble from his illness; but he
was carefully dressed, and was really much more vigorous than he
pretended. He raised his hat to the Governor as he approached, and
received a curt return of the salute, followed by a cold stare. The
Governor had looked into Captain Draper's case that forenoon.</p>

<p>"Shall I retain the crew, your Excellency?" said Draper, with an
obsequious smile, "or is the ship to go out of commission for the
present?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sir," said the stiff old Governor, not hiding his
dislike and contempt; "and I don't care, Sir. The ship belongs to the
convict department." He turned on his heel as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Captain Draper," said Mr. Wyville, in an official tone, "you are
relieved of your command. The ship goes out of commission."</p>

<p>Draper's face was a study of disappointment at the news.</p>

<p>"The crew will remain--" he began.</p>

<p>"The crew will be taken to Adelaide on my yacht, which will arrive
this week."</p>

<p>"Shall I have quarters on board?" asked Draper, with an alarmed
look.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said Mr. Wyville, shortly. "You must seek some other
means of transport."</p>

<p>"But," said Draper, imploringly, "there are no ships in the
colony, nor are any expected. I shall have to remain here."</p>

<p>"True," said the Governor, who enjoyed the scene. "There will be
no visitors here for twelve months to come, nor any means of
leaving."</p>

<p>Draper looked from one to the other of the men before him; but he
drew no gleam of satisfaction from their faces. He began to feel a
sinking of the heart, such as all cowards feel in the presence of
danger. He instinctively knew that his cunning had been overreached,
and was useless. He knew not where to look for the hand that had
played against him; but through every nerve the knowledge rushed on
him that he had been overmastered by a superior intelligence--that he
was beaten, discovered, and impotent.</p>

<p>This knowledge came suddenly, but it came overwhelmingly. At one
glance he saw that he had been led into a trap, and that the door had
just closed. He turned to Mr. Wyville, crestfallen.</p>

<p>"If you refuse to let me go on the steamer, I might as well be a
prisoner here."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Except that you will be a prisoner at large," said the Governor.
"There is a saying in this colony," he added laughingly to Mr.
Wyville, "that there are only two classes here--the people who are in
prison, and the people who ought to be. Come, now, the horses are
waiting; we have a ride of ten miles to Perth before we get
dinner."</p>

<p>The Governor, Mr. Wyville, and the gentlemen of the staff moved
off, leaving Captain Draper alone in the centre of the prison yard.
He regarded them with baleful eyes till they went through the gate
and disappeared. Then he followed, emerged from the gate, and was
directed by one of the prison guards to an inn or public-house for
the ticket-of-leave men, where he took up his residence.</p>

<h1>BOOK FIVE<br>THE VALLEY OF THE VASSE</h1>

<h2>ALICE WALMSLEY'S NEW HOME</h2>

<p>THE little town of Fremantle, with its imposing centre, the great
stone prison, is built on the shore, within the angle formed by the
broad Swan River as it flows calmly into the calm sea. At its mouth,
the Swan is about two miles wide. The water is shallow, and as clear
as crystal, showing, from the high banks, the brown stones and the
patches of white sand on the bottom. The only ripple ever seen on its
face, except in the rainy season, is the graceful curve that follows
the stately motion of the black swans, which have made the beautiful
river their home, and have given it its name.</p>

<p>One mile above the mouth of the river, where the gloomy cliff
hangs over the stream, are situated the terrible stone-quarries of
Fremantle, where the chain-gang works. Many a time, from the edge of
the overhanging cliff, a dark mass had been seen to plunge into the
river, which is very deep at this point. After this, there was one
link missing in the chains at night, and there was little stir made
and few questions asked. Not one swimmer in a thousand could cross a
mile of water with fifty pounds of iron chained to his ankles.</p>

<p>For ten miles above Fremantle, the Swan winds in and out among the
low hills and the wooded valleys. Its course is like a dream of
peace. There is never a stone in its bed great enough to break the
surface into a whirl or ripple. Its water turns no busy wheels. Along
its banks are seen no thriving homesteads. Here and there, in the
shallows, a black man, with upraised spear, stands still as an ebony
statue, while his wives and children sit upon the shaded rocks on the
shore, and silently watch his skilful fishing. Presently, without a
quiver of warning, the statue moves its arm, the long spear is driven
under water like a flash, and is raised to bear ashore its prize of a
wide-backed plaice. Along the wooded banks, the kangaroo nibbles the
fresh grass, and the bright-skinned carpet snake dives into the
pleasant water, that has become almost his second home.</p>

<p>On a lovely bend of the river, ten miles from its mouth, stands
the little city of Perth, the capital of the penal colony, and the
residence of the Governor. It is a petty town to-day, of four or five
thousand people; it was much smaller at the date of our story. The
main building, as in all West Australia towns, is the prison; the
second is the official residence, a very spacious and sightly
mansion.</p>

<p>Just outside the town, on a slope of exquisite lawn, running past the
great stone prison, running down to the river, stood a long, low building,
within a high enclosure. This was the Convent of the Sisters of
Mercy, where the children of the colony were educated.</p>

<p>In the porch of the convent one evening, some two weeks after the
arrival of the Houguemont, sat Alice Walmsley, Sister Cecilia, and
two growing girls from the convent school.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, in answer to some remark of the nun, "this is,
indeed, a scene of utter rest. But," she added, sadly, "it is not so
for most of those who see what we see. There is no rest for--"</p>

<p>"The wicked, Alice," said one of the schoolgirls, the daughter of
a free settler. "Neither should there be. Why do you always pity the
convicts so? One would think you ought to hate them."</p>

<p>The other girl stood beside Alice's chair, touching her soft hair
with her hand in a caressing manner.</p>

<p>"Alice couldn't hate even the convicts," she said, bending to
smile in Alice's face.</p>

<p>It was evident that the loving nature was fully alive, sending out
already its tendrils to draw towards it everything within its reach.
Sister Cecilia smiled kindly as she heard the girls, and saw their
expressions of love for Alice. She, however, changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville's yacht, with Mr. Hamerton and Mr. Sheridan, will
return from Adelaide next week," she said to Alice. "Here is the
report in the Fremantle Herald."</p>

<p>Alice turned her head as if interested in the news. Sister Cecilia
continued reading.</p>

<p>"And then they will start for Mr. Wyville's home in the
Vasse."</p>

<p>Alice silently sank back in her chair. Her eyes slowly withdrew
from the newspaper in her friend's hand, and settled far away on the
other side of the Swan, in a waking dream and a dream that was not
content. A few moments later she rose, and said she would walk home
early that evening.</p>

<p>"You like your new home and friends?" said Sister Cecilia, not
trying to detain her, though the girls did. "I thought it would be
pleasanter and more natural to you than our monotonous convent
life."</p>

<p>"They are very kind," said Alice; "and I love to work in the dairy
and among the children. It reminds me of my own dear old home in
England."</p>

<p>She said the words without pain, though her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"My good Alice!" said Sister Cecilia, taking her face between her
hands in the old way; "I am so happy to hear you say that. Come,
girls, let us walk to Mr. Little's farm with Alice."</p>

<p>With characteristic wisdom and kindness, Sister Cecilia had
obtained for Alice, shortly after their arrival, a home in a rich
settler's family. Her mind, so recently freed from the enforced
vacancy, became instantly filled with new interests, and her life at
once took root in the new country.</p>

<p>When she had been settled so for about a fortnight, and was
becoming accustomed to the new routine, she received a letter from
Will Sheridan. She knew it was from him; but she did not open it
among the children. When her duties for the day were done, she walked
down towards the convent, which was only half a mile away; but when
she came to the tall rocks beside the river, where she was utterly
alone, she opened and read her letter.</p>

<p>It was a simple and direct note, saying "Good-bye for a time,"
that he was going to Adelaide to leave the crew of the convict ship
there; but he should call on her, "for the old time's sake," when he
returned.</p>

<p>Alice read the letter many times, and between each reading her
eyes rested on the placid river. Once before, she had been haunted
with the last words of his letter, "Yours faithfully;" and now she
repeated and repeated the one sentence that was not prosaic--"I will
come for the old time's sake."</p>

<p>A few weeks later she received a letter from him, written in
Adelaide, telling her of the voyage, and stating the time of their
probable return to Fremantle. Alice could not help the recurring
thought that he was thinking of her.</p>

<p>One day, at dinner, Mr. Little spoke to her about the voyage.</p>

<p>"You brought us back a man we wanted in this colony, Miss
Walmsley," he said; "the man who has made the country worth living
in."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville--yes," said Alice confidently; "he could ill be
spared from any country."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean Wyville; I mean Mr. Sheridan--Agent Sheridan, we
call him,"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Alice, her eyes lowered to the table.</p>

<p>"He's the cleverest man that ever came to this colony," said the
well-meaning farmer; "I hope he'll get married and settle down here
for life."</p>

<p>"O, Sam, who could he marry in the West? There is no one here,"
said the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mr. Little; "there's the Governor's daughter for
one, and there are plenty more. And don't you know, the Governor is
going to give Mr. Sheridan a grand dinner, in the name of the colony,
when he comes back from Adelaide?"</p>

<p>Throughout the dinner Alice was particularly attentive to the
children, and did not eat much herself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville is coming here to-morrow," said Mr. Little,
presently. "He wants to buy that meadow below the convent, to put up
another school. He's a good man that, too, Miss Walmsley; but the
other man knows the needs of this colony, and has taught them to
us."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville is a man whose whole life seems given to benefit
others," said Alice, quite heartily; and she joined the conversation
in his praise, telling many incidents of his care for the prisoners
on the journey.</p>

<p>But, though Farmer Little again and again returned to the praise
of Sheridan, who was his man of men, Alice sat silent at these times,
and earnestly attended to the wants of the children.</p>

<h2>SOONER OR LATER, A MAN MUST FACE HIS SINS.</h2>

<p>THE inn where Draper had taken up his residence, known as "The Red
Hand," was one of the common taverns of the country, the customers of
which were almost entirely of the bond class, ticket-of-leave men,
working as teamsters or woodcutters, with a slight sprinkling of the
lowest type of free settlers. The main purpose of every man who
frequented the place was to drink strong liquor, mostly gin and
brandy. The house existed only for this, though its sign ran "Good
Victuals and Drink for Man and Beast." But whatever food was eaten or
sleep taken there was simply a means towards longer and deeper
drinking.</p>

<p>Champagne, too, was by no means unknown. Indeed, it was known to
have been swilled from stable buckets, free to all comers to the
house. This was when a crowd of sandalwood-cutters or mahogany
sawyers had come in from the bush to draw their money for a year, or
perhaps two or three years' work. These rough fellows, released from
the loneliness of the forest, their pockets crammed with money, ran
riot in their rude but generous prodigality.</p>

<p>There was no other way to have a wild time. In a free country, men
who have honest money and want to spend it may do as they please.
But, in West Australia, the freehanded, and, for the time, wealthy
ticket-of-leave man, can only drink and treat with drink, taking care
that neither he nor his companions are noisy or violent or otherwise
ostentatious. The first sign of disturbance is terribly checked by
the police.</p>

<p>Draper's introduction to this strange company was most favourable
to him. He was known to be the captain of the convict ship; and every
frequenter of "The Red Hand" was ready to treat him with respect.
This is one of the unexpected purities of convict life; it never
loses its respect for honour and honesty.</p>

<p>But Draper had no power to keep this respect. In the first place,
he did not believe in its existence; he was too shallow and mean of
nature to think that these rugged fellows were other than vicious
rascals all through, who sneered at morality. He felt a sense of
relief as soon as he found himself among them, as if he had at last
escaped from the necessity of keeping up a pretence of honesty or any
other virtue.</p>

<p>Acting under this conviction, Draper let loose his real nature in
the convicts' tavern. He did not drink very deeply, because he was
not able; but he talked endlessly. He joined group after group of
carousing wood-cutters, keeping up a stream of ribaldry and
depravity, until, after a few days' experience, the roughest convicts
in the place looked at him with disappointment and aversion.</p>

<p>Then a rumour crept to the inn, a story that was left behind by
the sailors of the Houguemont, of Harriet's confession on board ship,
exposing the heartless villainy of Draper. When this news became
current at the inn, the ticket-of-leave men regarded Draper with
stern faces, and no man spoke to him or drank with him.</p>

<p>One evening he approached a group of familiar loungers, making
some ingratiatory remark. No one answered, but all conversation
ceased, the men sitting in grim silence over their glasses.</p>

<p>"Why, mates, you're Quakers," said Draper, rallying them.</p>

<p>"We're no mates of yours," growled a big fellow, with a mahogany
face.</p>

<p>"And we don't want to be," said a slighter and younger man, with
pronounced emphasis.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" asked Draper, in a surprised and injured
tone. "Have I done anything to offend you fellows? Have I
unconsciously said something, to hurt your feelings by alluding to
your--"</p>

<p>"Shut up, you miserable rat," cried one of the convicts, starting
to his feet indignantly; "you couldn't hurt our feelings by any of
your sneaking allusions. We're not afraid to hear nor say what we
are; but we have just found out what you are, and we want you never
to speak to us again. Do you understand? We are men, though we are
convicts, and we only want to talk to men; but you are a cowardly
hound."</p>

<p>Draper's jaw had fallen as he listened; but he backed from the
table, and gained confidence as he remembered that these men were
wholly at the mercy of the police, and would not dare go any
further.</p>

<p>"You are an insolent jail-bird," he said to the speaker; "I'll see
to you within an hour."</p>

<p>At this, one of the men who sat at the end of the table nearest
Draper, leant towards him, and, taking his glass from the table, cast
its contents into his face.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he said; and, without noticing him further, the
ticket-of-leave men resumed their conviviality.</p>

<p>Burning with wrath, Draper left the tavern, and walked rapidly
down the street towards the police station. As he left the inn, a
tall man, who had sat at a side table unnoticed, rose and followed
him. Half way down the street he overtook him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Preacher!" said Draper, giving a side glance of dislike at
the man, and increasing his speed to pass him. But Mr. Haggett, for
it was he, easily kept by his shoulder, and evidently meant to stay
there.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pilferer!" retorted Haggett, with a movement of the lip
that was expressive and astonishing.</p>

<p>Draper slackened his pace at once, but he did not stop. He glanced
furtively at Haggett, wondering what he meant. Haggett ploughed along
but said no more.</p>

<p>"What title was that you gave me?" asked Draper, plucking up
courage as he thought of the friendlessness of the timid
Scripture-reader.</p>

<p>"You addressed me by my past profession," answered Haggett,
looking straight ahead, "and I called you by your present one."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you miserable--"</p>

<p>Mr. Haggett's bony band on Draper's collar closed the query with a
grip of prodigious power and suggestiveness. Haggett then let him go,
making no further reference to the interrupted offence.</p>

<p>"You're going to report those men at the tavern, are you?" asked
Haggett.</p>

<p>"I am--the scoundrels. I'll teach them to respect a free man."</p>

<p>"Why are they not free men?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because they're convicted robbers and murderers, and--"</p>

<p>"Yes; because they were found out. Well, I'll go with you to the
station, and have another thief discovered."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Draper, standing on the road; "is that a
threat?"</p>

<p>"I mean that those men in the tavern are drinking wine stolen from
the Houguemont, and sold to the innkeeper by--the person who had
charge of it."</p>

<p>Draper's dry lips came together and opened again several times,
but he did not speak. He was suffering agonies in this series of
defeats and exposures. He shuddered again at the terrible thought
that some unseen and powerful hand was playing against him.</p>

<p>"Mr.--Reader," he said at last, holding out his hand with a smile,
"have I offended you or injured you?"</p>

<p>Haggett looked at the proffered hand until it fell back to
Draper's side.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "a person like you offends and injures all
decent people."</p>

<p>Without a pretence of resentment, the crestfallen Draper retraced
his steps towards the tavern. Mr. Haggett stood and watched him. On
his way, Draper resolved to leave Fremantle that evening, and ride to
Perth, where he would live much more quietly than he had done here.
He saw the mistake he had made, and he would not repeat it.</p>

<p>He quietly asked the landlord for his bill, and gave directions
for his trunks to be forwarded next day. He asked if he could have a
horse that night.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the landlord, an ex-convict himself; "but you
must show me your pass."</p>

<p>"What pass? I'm a free man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not supposed to know what you are," said the landlord;
"only I'm not allowed to let horses to strangers without seeing their
passes."</p>

<p>"Who grants these passes?"</p>

<p>"The Comptroller-General, and he is at Perth. But he'll be here in
a day or two."</p>

<p>Draper cursed between his teeth as he turned away.</p>

<p>A short man, in a blue coat with brass buttons, who had heard this
conversation, addressed him as he passed the bar.</p>

<p>"There ain't no fear of your getting lost, Captain Draper. They
take better care of a man here than we used to in
Walton-le-Dale."</p>

<p>Draper stared at the speaker as if he saw an apparition. There,
before him, with a smile that had no kindness for him, was Officer
Lodge, who had known him since boyhood. His amazement was complete;
he had not seen Ben Lodge on the voyage, the latter having quietly
avoided his eye.</p>

<p>"Why, old friend," he said, holding out his hand with a joyful
lower face, "what brings you here?"</p>

<p>Instead of taking his hand, Ben Lodge took his "glass a' hale"
from the counter, and looked steadily at Draper.</p>

<p>"That's the foulest hand that ever belonged to Walton," said the
old man.</p>

<p>Draper was about to pass on, with a "pshaw," when Ben Lodge
stopped him with a word.</p>

<p>"Maybe you wouldn't want to go to Perth if you knew who was
there."</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Alice Walmsley--free and happy, thank Heaven! Do you want to see
her?"</p>

<p>Draper stepped close to the old man with a deadly scowl.</p>

<p>"Be careful," he hissed, stealing his hand toward Ben's throat,
"or--"</p>

<p>A long black hand seized Draper's fingers as they moved in their
stealthy threat, and twisted them almost from the sockets; and,
standing at his shoulder, Draper found a naked bushman, holding a
spear. It was Ngarra-jil, whom he did not recognize in his native
costume, which, by the way, at first, too, had greatly shocked and
disappointed Officer Lodge and Mr. Haggett.</p>

<p>"There's someone else from Walton will be in Perth by-and-by,"
continued Ben Lodge, with a smile at Draper's discomfiture; "and, let
me tell you beforehand, Samuel Draper, if he lays eyes on you in that
'ere town, you'll be sorry you didn't die of the black womit."</p>

<p>Without a look to either side Draper strode from the tavern, and
walked towards a hill within the town, which he climbed.</p>

<p>He sat down on the summit, amid the rough and dry salt-grass. He
was shaken to the place where his soul might have been. He felt that
he could not move tongue nor hand without discovery. The cunning that
had become almost intellectual from long use was worthless as chaff.
His life recoiled on him like a hissing snake, and bit him horribly.
Before his death, he was being judged and put in hell.</p>

<p>He sat hidden in the salt-grass among the vermin of the hill,
until the night had long fallen. The stars had come out in beautiful
clearness; but he did not see them. He only saw the flame of the sins
that had found him out, as they burned in their places along his
baleful career. When the sea-wind came in, damp and heavy, and made
him cough, for his chest was weak, he rose and crept down towards the
tavern, to spend the remaining hours of the night on his bed of
torture.</p>

<h2>WALKING IN THE SHADOW.</h2>

<p>THERE was nothing apparent in the possibilities of Alice
Walmsley's new life to disturb the calm flow of her returning
happiness. Even her wise and watchful friend, Sister Cecilia, smiled
hopefully as she ventured to glance into the future.</p>

<p>But when the sky was clearest, the cloud came up on the horizon,
though at first it was "no larger than a man's hand."</p>

<p>The visits of Mr. Wyville to Farmer Little's pleasant house were
frequent and continuous. Mr. Little's colonial title was Farmer; but
he was a gentleman of taste, and had a demesne and residence as
extensive as an English duke. He was hospitable, as all rich
Australians are; and he was proud to entertain so distinguished a man
as Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>Gravely and quietly, from his first visit, Mr. Wyville had devoted
his attention to Alice Walmsley, and in such a manner that his
purpose should not be misunderstood by Mr. Little or his wife.
Indeed, it was quite plain to them long before it was dreamt of by
Alice herself. From the first, she had been treated as a friend by
these estimable people; but after a while she began to observe
something in their manner that puzzled her. They were no less kind
than formerly; but they grew a little strange, as if they had not
quite understood her position at first.</p>

<p>Alice could discover no reason for any change; so she went on
quietly from day to day. Mr. Wyville always drew her into
conversation when he came there; and with him she found herself as
invariably talking on subjects which no one else touched, and which
she understood perfectly. It seemed as if he held a key to her mind,
and instinctively knew the lines of reflection she had followed
during her years of intense solitude. Alice herself would have
forgotten these reflections had they not been brought to her
recollection. Now, they recurred to her pleasantly, there are so few
persons who have any stock of individual thought to draw upon.</p>

<p>She took a ready and deep interest in every plan of Mr. Wyville
for the benefit of the convicts; and he, seeing this, made his
purposes, even for many years ahead, known to her, and advised with
her often on changes that might here and there be made.</p>

<p>One evening, just at twilight, when the ladies of the family were
sitting, under the wide verandah, looking down on the darkened river,
Mrs. Little pleasantly but slyly said something that made Alice's
cheek flame. Alice raised her face with a pained and reproachful
look.</p>

<p>"There now, Alice," said the lady, coming to her with a kind
caress; "you musn't think it strange. We can't help seeing it, you
know."</p>

<p>"What do you see?" asked Alice in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville's devotion, dear. We are all delighted to think of
your marriage with so good and eminent a man."</p>

<p>Alice sank back in her chair, utterly nerveless. It was so dark
they did not see her sudden paleness. She held the arms of her chair
with each hand, and was silent for so long a time that Mrs. Little
feared she had wounded her.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I have pained you, Alice," she said kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" said Alice, with quivering lips; "I thank you with
all my heart. I did not know--I did not think--"</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence. Mrs. Little, seeing that her
rallying had bad quite another effect from that intended, came to
Alice's aid by a sudden exclamation about the beauty of the rising
moon. This was successful; for ten minutes every eye was turned on
the lovely crescent that rose, as bright as burnished silver, above
the dark line of forest. In the midst of this admiration, Alice
slipped away from the happy group, and spent the evening alone in her
own room.</p>

<p>A few days later, she sat in the arbour of the convent garden,
while Sister Cecilia watered her flower beds. Sitting so, her mind
went reaching back after one memorable incident in her life. And by
some chance, the already-vibrating chord was touched at that moment
by the little nun.</p>

<p>"Here is my first rose-bud, Alice," she said, coming into the
arbour; "see how pretty those two young leaves are."</p>

<p>Alice's eyes were suffused with tears as she bent her head over
the lovely bud. It appealed to her now, in the midst of her
happiness, with unspeakable tenderness of recollection. She held it
to her lips, almost prayerful, so moved that she could not speak.</p>

<p>"Only think," continued Sister Cecilia, "for nine months to come
we shall never want for roses and buds. Ah me! I think we value them
less for their plenty. It's a good thing to visit the prison now and
again, isn't it, Alice? We love rosebuds all the better for
remembering the weeds."</p>

<p>Alice raised her head, and looked her eloquent assent at Sister
Cecilia.</p>

<p>"I love all the world better for the sweet rose-bud you gave me in
prison," she said.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia seemed puzzled for a moment, and then she smiled as
if she recalled something.</p>

<p>"It was not I who gave you that rose-bud, Alice."</p>

<p>Alice's face became blank with disappointment; her hands sank on
her knees.</p>

<p>"O, do not say that it was left there by accident or by careless
hands. I cannot think of that. I have drawn so much comfort from the
belief that your kind heart had read my unhappiness, and had
discovered such a sweet means of sending comfort. Do not break down
my fancies now. If you did not give it me, you prompted the act? You
knew of it, Sister, surely you did?"</p>

<p>"No. I did not know of it until it was done. I should never have
thought of it. It was thought of by one whose whole life seems
devoted to others and to the Divine Master. Do not fear that careless
hands put the flower in your cell, Alice. It was placed there by Mr.
Wyville."</p>

<p>"By Mr. Wyville!"</p>

<p>"Yes dear; it was Mr. Wyville's own plan to win you back to the
beautiful world. I thought you knew it all the time."</p>

<p>"It was nearly five years ago; how could Mr. Wyville have known?"
There was a new earnestness in Alice's face as she spoke.</p>

<p>"He had learned your history in Millbank from the governor and the
books; and he became deeply interested. It was he who first said you
were innocent, long before he proved it; and it was he who first
asked me to visit you in your cell."</p>

<p>Alice did not speak; but she listened with a look almost of
sadness, yet with close interest.</p>

<p>"He was your friend, Alice, when you had no other friend in the
world," continued Sister Cecilia, not looking at Alice's face, or she
would have hesitated; "for four years he watched your case, until at
last he found her whose punishment you had borne so long."</p>

<p>"Where did he find her?" Alice asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"He found her in the jail of your native village,
Walton-le-Dale."</p>

<p>"Walton-le-Dale!" repeated Alice in surprise; "he took much
trouble, then, to prove that I was innocent."</p>

<p>"Yes; and he did it all alone."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan, perhaps, could have assisted him. He was born in
Walton," said Alice in a very low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Sheridan told me so when he gave me the package for you
at Portland; but he was here in Australia all the years Mr. Wyville
was searching for poor wretched Harriet. But come now, Alice, we will
leave that gloomy old time behind us in England. Let us always keep
it there, as our Australian day looks backward and sees the English
night."</p>

<p>Soon after, Alice started to return to her home. She lingered a
long time by the placid river, the particulars she had beard
recurring to her and much disturbing her peace. In the midst of her
reflections she heard her name called, and looking towards the road,
saw Mr. Wyville. She did move, and he approached.</p>

<p>"I have come to seek you," he said, "and to prepare you to meet an
old friend."</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, without speaking.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan has just returned from Adelaide," he said; "and you
were the first person he asked for. I was not aware that you knew
him."</p>

<p>There was no tone in his voice that betrayed disquiet or anxiety.
He was even more cheerful than usual.</p>

<p>"I am glad you know Mr. Sheridan," he continued; "he is a fine
fellow; and I fear he has been very unhappy."</p>

<p>"He has been very busy," she said, looking down at the river; "men
have a great deal to distract them from unhappiness."</p>

<p>"See that jagged rock beneath the water," he said, pointing to a
stone, the raised point of which broke the calm surface of the river.
"Some poet likens a man's sorrow to such a stone. When the flood
comes, the sweeping rush of enterprise or duty, it is buried; but in
the calm season it will rise again to cut the surface, like an
ancient pain."</p>

<p>Alice followed the simile with eye and mind.</p>

<p>"I did not think you read poetry," she said, with a smile, as she
rose from her seat on the rocks.</p>

<p>"I have not read much," he said--and his face was flushed in the
setting sun--"until very recently."</p>

<p>As they walked together towards the house, Alice returned to the
subject first in her mind. With a gravely quiet voice she said--</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan's unhappiness is old, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it began years ago, when he was little more than a boy."</p>

<p>Alice was silent. She walked slowly beside Mr. Wyville for a dozen
steps. Then she stopped, as if unable to proceed, and, laying her
hand on a low branch beside the path, turned to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville," she said, "has Mr. Sheridan told you the cause of
his unhappiness?"</p>

<p>"He has," he replied, astonished at the abrupt question; "it is
most unfortunate and utterly hopeless. Time alone can heal the deep
wound. He has told me that you knew him years ago: you probably know
the sad story."</p>

<p>"I do not know it," she said, supporting herself by the
branch.</p>

<p>"He loved a woman with a man's love while yet a boy," he said;
"and he saw her lured from him by a villain, who blighted her life
into hopeless ruin."</p>

<p>"Does he love her still?" asked Alice, her face turned to the
darkened bush.</p>

<p>"He pities her; for she is wretched and--guilty."</p>

<p>At the word, Alice let go the branch, and stood straight in the
road.</p>

<p>"Guilty?" she said; in a strange voice.</p>

<p>"Miss Walmsley, I am deeply grieved at having introduced this
subject. But I thought you knew--Mr. Sheridan, I thought, intimated
as much. The woman he loved is the unhappy one for whom you suffered.
Her husband is still alive, and in this country. I brought him here,
to give him, when she is released, a chance of atonement."</p>

<p>A light burst on Alice's mind as Mr. Wyville spoke, and she with
difficulty kept from sinking. She reached for the low branch again,
but she did not find it in the dark. To preserve her control she
walked on towards the house, though her steps were hurried and
irregular.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, thinking that her emotion was caused by painful
recollections, accompanied her without a word. He was profoundly
sorry that he had given her pain. Alice knew, as well as if he had
spoken his thought, what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>As one travelling in the dark will see a whole valley in one flash
of lightning, Alice had seen the error under which Mr. Wyville
laboured, and all its causes, in that one moment of illumination.
Then, too, she read his heart, filled with deep feeling, and
unconscious of the gulf before it; and the knowledge flooded her with
sorrow.</p>

<p>At the door of the house, Mrs. Little met them with an air of
bustle.</p>

<p>"Why, Alice!" she exclaimed, "two gentlemen coming to dinner, and
one of them an old friend, and you loitering by the river like a
school-girl. Mr. Wyville, I believe you kept Alice till she has
barely time to put a ribbon in her hair."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, with some easy turn of the subject, covered Alice's
disquiet, and then took his leave, going to Perth, to return later
with Sheridan and Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Little," said Alice, when his horse's hoofs sounded on
the road, "you must not ask me to dine with you to-night. Let me go
to the children."</p>

<p>There was something in her voice and face that touched the kind
matron, and she at once assented, only saying she was sorry for
Alice's sake.</p>

<p>"But you will see Mr. Sheridan?" she said. "Mr. Little says he was
very particular in asking for you."</p>

<p>"I will see him to-morrow," said Alice; "indeed, I am not able to
see anyone to-night."</p>

<p>An hour later, when the guests arrived, Alice sat in her unlighted
room, and heard their voices; and one voice, that she remembered as
from yesterday, mentioned her name, and then remained silent.</p>

<h2>THE MEETING</h2>

<p>WITH the first warm flush of morning Alice was away on her
favourite lonely walk by the river. The day opened, like almost all
days in West Australia, with a glorious richness of light, colour,
and life. The grand shadowy stretches in the bush were neither silent
nor humid, as in tropical countries. Every inch of ground sent up its
jet of colour, exquisite though scentless; and all the earth hummed
with insect life, while the trees flashed with the splendid colours
of countless bright-necked birds.</p>

<p>Alice breathed in the wondrous beauty of her surroundings. Her
heart, so long unresponsive, had burst into full harmony with the
generous nature of the Australian bush.</p>

<p>Down by the river, where the spreading mahogany trees reached far
over the water, she loved to walk in the early morning and at the
close of the day. Thither she went this morning; and an hour later
someone followed her steps, directed where to find her by Mrs.
Little.</p>

<p>That morning, as she left the house, Mrs. Little had told her that
Mr. Sheridan was to call early, and had asked to see her.</p>

<p>"I shall be home very soon," Alice said, as she went out.</p>

<p>But she did not return soon; and when Mr. Sheridan called, much
earlier than he was expected, Mrs. Little told him where Miss
Walmsley usually spent her mornings, and he, leaving his horse in the
stable, walked down through the bush towards the river.</p>

<p>The shadows and the flowers and the bright-winged birds were as
beautiful as an hour before, but Will Sheridan, though he loved
nature, saw none of them. He walked rapidly at first, then he
slackened his pace, and broke off a branch here and there as he
passed, and threw it away again. When he came to the river, and stood
and looked this way and that for Alice, all the determination with
which he had set out had disappeared.</p>

<p>But Alice was not in sight. He walked along by the river bank, and
in a few minutes he saw her coming towards him beneath the trees.</p>

<p>He stood still and waited for her. She walked rapidly. When within
ten yards of where he stood she turned from the river, to cross the
bush towards the house. She had not seen him, and in a minute she
would be out of sight. Sheridan took a few paces towards her and
stopped.</p>

<p>"Alice," he said aloud.</p>

<p>She turned and saw him standing with an eager face, his hands
reached out to-wards her. Every premeditated word was forgotten. She
gave one look at the face, so little changed; she felt the deep
emotion in voice, and act, and feature, and her heart responded
impulsively and imperatively. She only spoke one word.</p>

<p>"Will!"</p>

<p>He came forward, his eyes on hers, and the eyes of both were
brimming. Without a word they met. Alice put out both her hands, and
he took them and held them, and after a while he raised them, one
after the other, to his lips, and kissed them. Then they turned
towards the house and walked on together in silence. Their hearts
were too full for words. They understood without speech. Their
sympathy was so deep and unutterable that it verged on the bounds of
pain.</p>

<p>On the verandah, Alice turned to him with the same full look she
had given him at first, only it was clear as a morning sky, and with
it she gave him her hand. Sheridan looked into the cloudless depths
of her eyes, as if searching for the word that only reached his
senses through the warm pressure of her hand.</p>

<p>It was a silent meeting and parting, but it was completely
eloquent and decisive. They had said all that each longed for in the
exquisite language of the soul. As Sheridan was departing, he turned
once more to Alice.</p>

<p>"I shall come here this evening."</p>

<p>She only smiled, and he went away with a satisfied heart.</p>

<p>On that morning Mr. Wyville had started early for Fremantle, his
mind revolving two important steps which he meant to take that day.
Since the arrival of the ship he had been disquieted by the presence
of Draper in the colony. He questioned his own wisdom in bringing him
there, or in keeping him there when he might have let him go.</p>

<p>But, in his wide experience of men and of criminals, Mr. Wyville
had never met one who was wholly bad; he had discovered, under the
most unsightly and inharmonious natures, some secret chord that, when
once struck, brought the heart up to the full tone of human kindness.
This chord he had sought for in Draper. He had hoped that, in the day
of humiliation, his heart would return to her he had so cruelly
wronged.</p>

<p>There was only one step more to be taken--to release Harriet, and,
if she would, let her seek her husband, and appeal once more to his
humanity.</p>

<p>On this day Mr. Wyville intended to issue a pardon to Harriet
Draper. The Government had awarded to Alice Walmsley, as some form of
recompense for her unjust suffering, a considerable sum of money; and
this money Mr. Wyville held, at Alice's request, for the benefit of
Harriet.</p>

<p>Arrived at Fremantle, he proceeded to the prison, and signed the
official papers necessary for the release. The money was made payable
to Harriet at the Bank of Fremantle. He did not see her himself, but
he took means of letting her know the residence of her husband; and
he also provided that Draper should be informed of her release.</p>

<p>He watched her from his office window as she was led to the prison
gate; and as she took the pardon in her hand and turned towards the
outer world in a bewildered way, the utter misery and loneliness of
the woman smote Mr. Wyville's heart.</p>

<p>"God help her!" he murmured; "she has no place to go but to
Him."</p>

<p>This done, Mr. Wyville set his mind towards Perth, where, on his
return that day, he was to enter on another act of even deeper
personal importance. Somehow, his heart was heavy as he walked from
the prison, thinking of the next few hours. He had been more deeply
impressed than be thought, perhaps, by the wretched fate of the poor
woman he had just released.</p>

<p>At the stable where his horses were put up, he found Officer
Lodge, who, with Ngarra-jil, he sent on to Perth in a light carriage
before him. He followed on horseback. As he rode through the town, he
passed the bank. In the portico sat a woman on a bench, with her head
bent low on her hands. He was startled by the attitude; it recalled
to his mind the figure of the unhappy Harriet, as he had seen her in
the lock-up of Walton-le-Dale.</p>

<p>Something induced him to look at the woman a second time. As he
did so, she raised her face, and smiled at a man who came quickly out
of the bank, pressing something like a heavy pocket-book into his
breast. The woman was Harriet; and the man was Draper, who had just
drawn her money from the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was in no mood to ride swiftly, so he let his horse
choose its own pace. When about half way to Perth, however, he broke
into a canter, and arrived shortly after the trap containing Ben
Lodge and his native servant.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had not occupied the official residence of the
Comptroller-General, but had kept his quarters at the hotel, a very
comfortable establishment. As he dismounted in the yard, Ben Lodge
held his horse, and seemed in garrulous humour.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan were here, sir," said Ben, "and he asked after you.
He said he were going to Mr. Little's to-night, and he hoped to see
you there."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville nodded to Ben, and was going towards the house; but
Officer Lodge looked at him with a knowing look in his simple face,
as if enjoying some secret pleasure.</p>

<p>"He's found her at last, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville could only smile at the remark, which he did not at
all comprehend.</p>

<p>"He were always fond of her. I've known him since he were a
boy."</p>

<p>Still Mr. Wyville did not speak; but he seemed interested, and he
ceased to smile. Old Ben saw that he might continue.</p>

<p>"I thought at one time that they'd be married. It's years ago; but
I see them as plain as if it were yesterday. He were a handsome
fellow when he came home from sea--just like his father, old Captain
Sheridan--I knew him well, too--and just to think!"</p>

<p>Here Old Ben stopped, and led the horse towards the stable,
satisfied with his own eloquence. Mr. Wyville stood just where he had
dismounted. He looked after Ben Lodge, then walked towards the hotel;
but he changed his mind, and returned and entered the stable, where
Ben was unsaddling the horse.</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Sheridan alone when he started for Mr. Little's?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yessir, he were alone." Then Ben added with a repetition of the
knowing look: "Happen, he don't want no company, sir; he never did
when he were a boy, when she was 'round."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville looked at Ben Lodge in such a way that the old man
would have been frightened had he raised his head. There was a
sternness of brow rarely seen on the calm, strong face; and there was
a light almost of terror in the eye.</p>

<p>"He were very fond of Alice, surely," said the old fellow, as he
went on with his work; "and I do believe he's just as fond of her
to-day."</p>

<p>"Do you tell me," said Mr. Wyville, slowly, "that Mr. Sheridan
knew Miss Walmsley, very intimately, in Walton-le-Dale, years
ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yessir; they was very hintimate, no doubt; and they were
going to be married, folk said, when that precious rascal, Draper,
interfered. They say in Walton to this day that he turned her head by
lies against the man she loved."</p>

<p>Ben Lodge carried the saddle to another part of the yard. Had he
looked round he would have seen Mr. Wyville leaning against the
stall, his face changed by mental suffering almost past recognition.
In a minute, when the old man returned, Mr. Wyville passed him in
silence, and entered the hotel.</p>

<p>The door of his room was locked for hours that day, and he sat
beside his desk, sometimes with his head erect, and a blank suffering
look in his eyes, and sometimes with his face buried in his hands.
The agony through which his soul was passing was almost mortal. The
powerful nature was ploughed to its depths. He saw the truth before
him, as hard and palpable as a granite rock. He saw his own blind
error. His heart, breaking from his will, tried to travel again the
paths of sweet delusion which had brought so great and new a joy to
his soul. But the strong will resisted, wrestled, refused to listen
to the heart's cry of pain--and, in the end, conquered.</p>

<p>But the man had suffered woefully in the struggle. The lines on
his bronzed face were manifestly deeper, and the lips were firmer
set, as, towards evening he rose from his seat and looked outwards
and upwards at the beautiful deep sky. His lips moved as he looked,
repeating the bitter words that were becoming sweet to his
heart--'Thy will be done!'</p>

<p>Two hours later, when the glory of the sunset had departed, and
the white moon was reflected in the mirror-like Swan, Will Sheridan
and Alice stood beside the river. With one hand he held one of hers,
and the other arm was around her. He was looking down into her eyes,
that were as deep and calm as the river.</p>

<p>"It has been so always, dear," he said tenderly; "I have never
lost my love for one day."</p>

<p>She only pressed closer to him, still looking up, but the tears
filled her eyes.</p>

<p>"My sorrow, then, was not equal to yours," she said.</p>

<p>"Darling, speak no more of sorrow," he answered: "it shall be the
background of our happiness, making every line the clearer. I only
wish to know that you love me as I love you."</p>

<p>Their lips met in a kiss of inexpressible sweetness and unity--in
a joy so perfect that the past trembled out of sight and disappeared
for ever.</p>

<p>While yet they stood beside the river, they heard a footstep near
them. Alice started with alarm, and drew closer to her protector.
Next moment, Mr. Wyville stood beside them, his face strangely
lighted up by the moonlight. He was silent a moment. Then Sheridan,
in his happiness, stretched out his hand as to a close friend, and
the other took it. A moment after, he took Alice's hand, and stood
holding both.</p>

<p>"God send happiness to you!" he said, his voice very low and
deeply earnest. "Your past sorrow will bring a golden harvest.
Believe me, I am very happy in your happiness."</p>

<p>They did not answer in words; but the truth of his friendship was
clearer to their hearts than the bright moon to their eyes. He joined
the hands he held, and without speaking further, left them together
by the river.</p>

<h2>MR. WYVILLE FACES A STORM</h2>

<p>IN the peaceful water of Fremantle harbour, Mr. Wyville's yacht
had lain at anchor for several months. On her return from Adelaide
with Mr. Sheridan, she had taken on board a cargo, contained in large
cases and swathings, which had arrived from Europe some time before.
She also took on board many persons of both sexes, mostly mechanics
and labourers, with their families; and among the crowd, but with
airs of trust and supervision, as caretakers or stewards, were Mr.
Haggett and Officer Lodge. Their friend Ngarra-jil had come on board
to bid them good-by, and as he strode about the deck, naked, except
his fur boka hanging from the shoulder, and carrying two long spears
in his hand, he seemed a strange acquaintance for two persons so
prosaic as Mr. Haggett and Ben Lodge.</p>

<p>This thought, indeed, occurred to both of them with renewed
strength that day; and it was emphasized by the remark of one of the
mechanics--</p>

<p>"That black fellow seems to know you pretty well;" addressed to
Ben Lodge.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ben, with hesitation, and a glance of doubt at
Ngarra-jil, "we knew him in England. He was dressed fine there."</p>

<p>"Well," said the good-natured mechanic, "he's the same man still
as he war theer. 'Tisn't clothes as we ought to vally in our
friends."</p>

<p>This remark brightened Officer Lodge's face, and his hesitating
manner towards his wild friend vanished. When the anchor was weighed,
and the last visitor had jumped on the barges to go ashore, there
were no warmer farewells spoken than those of Mr. Haggett and Ben
Lodge to Ngarra-jil.</p>

<p>That evening, at Mr. Little's pleasant dinner-table, Mrs. Little
spoke to Mr. Wyville about the destination of the passengers.</p>

<p>"They are going to settle in the Vasse district," he said; "they
have purchased homesteads there."</p>

<p>"You have built extensively on your own land there, I believe,"
said Mr. Little.</p>

<p>A shadow, scarcely perceptible, flitted over Mr. Wyville's face;
but his voice had its accustomed tone as he answered--</p>

<p>"Yes; I have worked out an old fancy as to the site and plan of a
dwelling-house. But the building was not for myself. Mr. Sheridan has
bought the place from me."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Mrs. Little, in a disappointed tone; "after
sending scores of workmen and gardeners from Europe, and spending
four years and heaps of money to make a lovely place, to go and sell
it all, just when it was finished! I'm sure Mr. Sheridan might go and
make some other place beautiful. It really is too provoking."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Little," said Hamerton, adroitly taking the good lady's
attention from a subject which she was in danger of pursuing, "will
you not direct me to some rare spot that is capable of beauty and
hungry for improvement? I, too, am hunting for a home."</p>

<p>The lure was quite successful. Mrs. Little ran over in her mind
all the pretty places she knew in the colony, and instructed Mr.
Hamerton with much particularity and patience.</p>

<p>The further conversation of the evening touched no matter of
importance to the persons present.</p>

<p>After some weeks the steamer returned to Fremantle, and lay at
anchor for several months, except some pleasure-trips round the
adjacent coast, arranged by Mrs. Little, and taking in many of the
ladies of the colony.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville was engaged every day in directing the operation of
the new and humane law he had brought to the colony. At first, it
seemed as if it must end in failure. Its worst enemies were those it
proposed to serve. The convicts, as soon as they found the old rigour
relaxed, and a word take the place of a blow; when they saw offences
that used to earn five years in chains, punished by five minutes of
reproach from a superintendent, or at worst, by a red stripe on the
sleeve--when first they saw this, they took advantage of it, and
shamefully abused their new privileges.</p>

<p>Among the officials of the convict service were many who watched
this result with satisfied eyes--croakers, who always predict defeat,
and a few envious and disappointed ones, who had lost some selfish
chance by the change.</p>

<p>At last, it came to such a condition--the reports from the
outlying districts were so alarming, and the croakers and
mischief-makers became so bold in their criticism--that even the
warmest friends of the new system held their breath in fear of
something disastrous.</p>

<p>But through the gloom, there was one steadfast and reliant heart
and hand. He who had planned the system had faith in it. He knew what
its foundations were. When even the brave quailed, he still smiled;
and though his face grew thin with anxious application, there was
never a quiver of weakness, or hesitation in it.</p>

<p>His near friends watched him with tender, sometimes with terrified
interest. But, as the storm thickened, they spoke to him less and
less of the danger, until at last they ceased to speak at all. They
only looked on him with respect and love, and, did his few behests
without a word.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville knew that he was trying no experiment, though he was
doing what had never been done before. It was not experimental,
because it was demonstrable. He had not based his system on theory or
whim, but on the radical principles of humanity; and he was sure of
the result. All he wanted was time, to let the seething settle. Those
who doubted, were doubting something as inexorably true as a
mathematical axiom. His ship was in the midst of a cyclone; but the
hand on the tiller was as true as the very compass itself, for it
obeyed as rigidly a natural law.</p>

<p>One flash of passion only did the tempest strike from him. On the
great parade-ground of the prison at Fremantle, one day, a thousand
convicts stood in line, charged with grossly breaking the new law. On
their flank was unlimbered a battery of artillery; and in their rear
was a line of soldiers with fixed bayonets and loaded rifles.
Scattered in front were the convict officers, and in the centre of
the line, within hearing of the convicts, the malcontents had
gathered, and were openly denouncing the law as a failure, and
declaring that the colony was in danger. Among them, loud in his
dissent, stood an officer with a broad gold band on his cap--the
deputy superintendent of the prison.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville had ridden hard from Perth, whence he had been
summoned by a courier with a highly-coloured report. His face was
deeply-lined and careworn, for he had scarcely slept an hour a day
for weeks. But he knew that the turning-point had come. Six months of
the new system had passed. During that time there had only been a
moral restraint on the convicts--henceforth, there would be a
personal and selfish one.</p>

<p>From this day the convicts would begin to receive reward for good
conduct, as well as reproach for bad.</p>

<p>A hundred yards behind Mr. Wyville, rode silently the two men who
loved him best--Hamerton and Sheridan. They had seen him start, had
questioned the courier, and discovered the cause. Thrusting, their
revolvers into their holsters, they had followed him in silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville checked his steaming horse as he drew near the prison.
He rode up to the gate, and entered the yard calmly, but with such a
bearing, even imparted to the horse, as made every man feel that he
was full of power.</p>

<p>As he approached, there was deep silence for half a minute. Then
his ear caught the sound of a murmur in the central group of
officers. He reined his horse stiffly, and regarded them with flaming
eyes.</p>

<p>There was no sound for a moment; then there was a whisper; and
then the deputy with the gold band walked to the front, and, without
salute or preface, spoke:--</p>

<p>"The warders cannot control the men by your new rules. The colony
is in a state of mutiny."</p>

<p>There ran a sound, like a terrible growl, along the line of a
thousand convicts.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville dismounted. His horse stood unattended. Sheridan and
Hamerton closed up, their hands quietly on their holster-pipes.</p>

<p>It was a moment of awful responsibility; the lives of thousands
were in the balance. One weak or false step, and the yell of blind
revolt would split the air, to be followed by the crash of artillery,
and the shrieks of a wild tumult.</p>

<p>Two revolts stood in Mr. Wyville's presence--the warders', and the
convicts'. Towards which side lay the dangerous step?</p>

<p>There was no indecision--not a moment of delay in his action. With
a few rapid strides he was close to the mutinous deputy, had plucked
the conspicuous cap from his head, rent off its broad gold band,
flung it on the earth, and put his foot on it. The next instant his
hand had torn the insignia of rank from his collar, unbuckled his
belt, and thrown his sword on the ground. Then, with a voice that
rang like a trumpet through the prison yard, he called to the
military officer for a file of men, with irons.</p>

<p>The leader of the warders had never moved--but he had grown pale.
He had expected a parley, at least, perhaps, a surrender of the
Comptroller's plan. But he was dealing with one who was more than a
man, who was at that moment an embodied principle.</p>

<p>In a few moments the degraded and dumbfounded deputy was in irons,
with a soldier at each shoulder.</p>

<p>"Take him to the cells!" said Mr. Wyville. His stern order reached
every ear in the yard. Then he addressed the military commander.</p>

<p>"Limber up those guns, and march your riflemen to their
quarters!"</p>

<p>In two minutes there was not a soldier nor a gun in sight.</p>

<p>"The warders will bring their prisoners into square, to listen to
the first half-yearly report of the Penal Law."</p>

<p>Rapidly and silently, with faces of uncertainty, the movement was
performed, and the thousand convicts stood in solid mass before the
austere Comptroller-General, who bad mounted his horse, and looked
down on them, holding in his hand the report. There was a profound
silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville read from the paper, in a rapid but clear voice, the
names of twelve men, and ordered them to step to the front, if
present. Seven men walked from the convict square, and stood before
him; the other five were on the road-parties throughout the colony.
Mr. Wyville addressed the seven.</p>

<p>"Men, by your good conduct as recorded under the old law and your
attention to the rules of the present penal code, you have become
entitled to a remission of the unexpired term of your sentences.
To-day's misconduct shall not stop your reward. You are free. Guard,
allow those men to pass through the gate!"</p>

<p>The seven men, wide-eyed, unable to realize the news, almost
tottered towards the barrier. The eyes of their fellows in the square
followed them in a daze till they disappeared through the outer
gate.</p>

<p>There was a sound from the square, like a deep breath, followed by
a slight shuffling of feet. Then again there was absolute stillness,
every eye intently fixed on the face of the Comptroller-General.</p>

<p>Again he read a list of names, and a number of men came quickly to
the front, and stood in line. The new law had awarded to these a
certain considerable remission, which sounded to their ears like the
very promise of freedom.</p>

<p>Still the lists were read, and still the remissions were
conferred. When the report was ended, seven men had been released,
and sixty-seven out of the thousand present, all of whom had that
morning threatened mutiny, had received rewards striking away years
of their punishment.</p>

<p>"Men! we have heard the last sound of mutiny in the colony."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville's voice thrilled the convicts like deep-sounded music:
they looked at him with awe-struck faces. Every heart was filled with
the conviction that he was their friend that it was well to listen to
him and obey him.</p>

<p>"From this day every man is earning his freedom, and an interest
in this colony. Your rights are written down, and you shall know
them. You must regard the rights of others as yours shall be
regarded. This law trusts to your manhood, and offers you a reward
for your labour; let every man be heedful that is not disgraced nor
weakened by unmanly conduct. See to it, each for himself, that you
return as speedily as you may to the freedom and independence which
this colony offers you."</p>

<p>Turning to the warders, he gave a brief order to march the men to
their work; and, turning his horse, rode slowly from the prison.</p>

<p>From that hour, as sometimes a tempest dies after one tremendous
blast, the uproar against the new law was silent. As swiftly as
couriers could carry the news, the scene in the prison yard was
described to every road party in the colony.</p>

<p>Among the warders opposition disappeared the moment the gold band
of the deputy's cap was seen under the Comptroller's foot. Among the
convicts, disorder hid its wild head as soon as they realized that
the blind system of work without reward had been replaced by one that
made every day count for a hope not only of liberty, but
independence.</p>

<p>In a word, from that day the colony ceased to be stagnant, and
began to progress.</p>

<h2>THE VALLEY OF THE VASSE.</h2>

<p>THERE was a large and pleasant party on the deck of Mr. Wyville's
steamer as she slowly swung from her moorings and headed seaward
through the islands of Fremantle harbour. It was evidently more than
a coast excursion, for the vessel had been weeks in preparation, and
the passengers had made arrangements for a long absence.</p>

<p>Beneath the poop awning, waving, their handkerchiefs to friends on
shore, stood Mrs. Little and several other ladies. Standing with
them, but waving no adieu, was Alice Walmsley; and, quietly sitting
near her, enjoying the excitement and pleasure of the others, was
Sister Cecilia.</p>

<p>There were many gentlemen on board, too, including the stiff old
Governor of the colony, and several of his staff. Mr. Wyville stood
with the Governor, pointing out, as they passed, something of
interest on the native prison-isle of Rottenest; Mr. Hamerton lounged
on the forecastle, smoking and with him the artillery officer of
Fremantle; while Mr. Sheridan leant over the rail, watching the sea,
but often raising his head and looking sternwards, seeking the eyes
that invariably turned, as if by instinct, to meet his glance.</p>

<p>It was a party of pleasure and inspection, going to the Vasse, to
visit the new settlement purchased from Mr. Wyville by Mr. Sheridan.
They proposed to steam slowly along the coast, and reach their
destination in two days.</p>

<p>The excursion was a relief to Mr. Wyville, after the severe strain
he had borne for months. From the day of the threatened mutiny, which
he had quelled by the report, the new law had become an assured
success, and the congratulations and thanks of the whole colony had
poured in on the Comptroller-General.</p>

<p>It appeared to those who knew him best, that, during the period of
trial, he had withdrawn more and more from social life, and had
increased his silence and reserve. This change was ascribed to the
anxiety he felt for the reform of the penal law. In his conversation,
too, even Hamerton admitted that he had become almost irritable on
personal or local topics, and was only willing to converse on
abstract or speculative ideas.</p>

<p>'The individual withers, and the world is more and more,' quoted
Hamerton one day, as the subject of Mr. Wyville's reserve was quietly
discussed on the poop. "I don't know what he will do for a cause, now
that his penal law has succeeded."</p>

<p>"He will turn his attention to politics, I think," said one of the
gentlemen of the staff; "every patriotic man has a field there."</p>

<p>There was a pause, as if all were considering the proposition. At
length Hamerton spoke.</p>

<p>"Can you call Mr. Wyville a patriot?"</p>

<p>"Every Englishman is a patriot," answered the first speaker; "of
course he is one."</p>

<p>Again there was a lapse; and again Hamerton was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>"I don't like the word--applied to him. I don't think it fits,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Surely, it is a noble word, only to be given to a noble
character," said one of the ladies.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Hamerton, assenting, but still dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyville has the two highest characteristics of an
Englishman," said the old Governor, sententiously.</p>

<p>"Which are?" queried Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Patriotism, and love of Law."</p>

<p>There was an expression of approval from almost every one but
Hamerton, who still grumbled. The Governor was highly pleased with
himself for his prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Are these not the noblest principles for an Englishman, or any
man?" he asked exultingly.</p>

<p>"Let us leave it to Mr. Wyville himself," said Hamerton; "here he
comes."</p>

<p>"We have been discussing public virtues," said the Governor to Mr.
Wyville, who now joined the group; "and we appeal to you for a
decision. Are not Patriotism and love of Law two great English
virtues?"</p>

<p>"English virtues--yes, I think so;" and Mr. Wyville smiled as he
gave the answer.</p>

<p>"But are they virtues in the abstract?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"No; I think not--I am sure they are not."</p>

<p>There was a movement of surprise in the company. The answer, given
in a grave voice, was utterly unexpected. The old Governor coughed
once or twice, as if preparing to make a reply; but he did not.</p>

<p>Patriotism not a virtue at length exclaimed one of the ladies.
"Pray, Mr. Wyville, what is it, then?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville paused a moment, then told a story.</p>

<p>"There were ten families living on a beautiful island, and owning
the whole of it. They might have lived together in fraternal peace
and love; but each family preferred to keep to themselves, neither
feeling pride nor pleasure in the good of their neighbours, nor
caring about the general welfare of the whole number. They watched
their own interests with greedy care; and when they were strong
enough they robbed their fellows, and boasted of the deed. Every
person of each family was proud of its doings, though many of these
were disgraceful. The spirit which filled these people was, I think,
patriotism--on a small scale."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Hamerton, looking, at the Governor; "I thought that
word didn't fit, somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, if patriotism is to be condemned, shall we not still
reverence Law?" asked someone. "Have you another allegory, Mr.
Wyville?"</p>

<p>Again he thought a moment, before his reply came.</p>

<p>"There was a lake, from which two streams flowed to the sea. One
river wound itself around the feet of the hills, taking a long
course, but watering the fields as it ran, and smiling back at the
sun. Its flood was filled with darting fish, and its banks fringed
with rich grass and bright flowers. The other stream ran into a great
earthen pipe, and rolled along in the dark. It reached the sea first,
but it had no fish in its water, except blind ones, and no flowers on
its banks. This stream had run so long in the tunnel without its own
will that it preferred this way to the winding course of its natural
bed; and at last it boasted of its reverence for the earthen pipe
that held it together and guided its blind way."</p>

<p>"The earthen pipe is Law, I suppose," said Mr. Little, "that men
come in time to love."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, who had smiled at the ladies all through his
allegory, did not answer.</p>

<p>"But do you apply the allegory to all law?" asked a gentleman of
the staff.</p>

<p>"To all law not founded on God's abstract justice, which provides
for man's right to the planet. Sooner or later, human laws, from the
least act to the greatest, shall be brought into harmony with
this."</p>

<p>"Will you give us substitutes for those poor virtues that you have
pushed out? What shall we have instead?"</p>

<p>"Mankind and Liberty--instead of Patriotism and Law. Surely, the
exchange is generously in our favour."</p>

<p>Then followed a general discussion, in which everyone had a hasty
word. Mr. Wyville said no more; but drew off the Governor and
Hamerton to his cabin to settle some geographical inaccuracy in a
chart of the coast.</p>

<p>So the hours passed on the steamer, as she slowly rounded
headlands and cut across bays. The air was laden with the breath of
the interminable forest. On shore, when the great fires swept over
miles of sandalwood and jamwood bush, the heavy perfume from the
burning timber lingered on the calm air, and extended far over land
and sea.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day, they saw before them the
mountains of the Vasse, running sheer down to the sea, in two
parallel ridges about six miles apart.</p>

<p>The land between these high ridges was cut off, some four or five
miles back, by a line, of mountain which joined the ridges, thus
forming the valley which Mr. Sheridan had bought from Mr.
Wyville.</p>

<p>As the steamer drew close to the land, the valley assumed the
perfect shape of a horse-shoe. From the sea, at a distance, it seemed
a retreat of delicious coolness and verdure. The mountains were
wooded high up their sides, and the tops were so steep they seemed to
overhang the valley. Two broad and bright shallow streams, which
tumbled from the hills at the head of the valley, wound through the
rich plain, and calmly merged in the ocean.</p>

<p>Exclamations of wonder and delight were on every lip as the
surpassing beauties of the scene came one after another into
view.</p>

<p>The end of the ridge on the southern side ran far into the sea;
and here, under Mr. Wyville's directions, years before, a strong
mahogany pier had been erected, which made a safe landing-place for
even great ships. A railed platform ran round the foot of the hills,
and brought the passengers to a road shaded by majestic trees that
swept towards the farther end of the valley.</p>

<p>Awaiting their arrival were easy, open carriages, evidently of
European build, in which the astonished party seated themselves. The
drivers were some black, some white, but they were all at home in
their places.</p>

<p>The scene was like a field from fairy-land. No eye accustomed only
to northern vegetation and climate, can conceive unaided the glory of
a well-watered Australian vale. The carriages rolled under trees of
splendid fern from fifteen to twenty feet in height; the earth was
variegated with rich colour in flower and herbage; spreading palms of
every variety filled the eye with beauty of form; the green and
crimson and yellow parrots and paroquets rose in flocks as the
carriages passed; and, high over all the beauteous life of the
underwood, rose the grand mahogany and tuad and gum trees of the
forest.</p>

<p>They passed cottages bowered in flowers, and ringed by tall
hedgerows composed wholly of gorgeous geraniums. The strangers who
looked on these changing revelations of loveliness sat silent, and
almost tearful. Even those long accustomed to Australian scenery were
amazed at the beauty of the valley.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville and Mr. Sheridan had ridden rapidly on before the
others, and stood uncovered and host-like on the verandah of the
house where the drive ended.</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley sat in the foremost carriage, and was the first to
alight, with Sheridan's hand holding hers. Their eyes met as she
stepped to his side. His lips formed one short word, of which only
her eye and ear were conscious--</p>

<p>"Home!"</p>

<p>Exclamations of wonder came from all the party at the peerless
beauty of their surroundings. The house was wholly built of bright
red mahogany beams, perfectly fitted, with rich wood-carving of
sandalwood and jamwood on angle, cornice, and capital. It was very
low, only one story high for the most part, though there were a
number of sleeping rooms raised to a second story. From the verandah,
looking seaward, every part of the wooded valley was visible, and the
winding silver of the rivers glanced deliciously through the trees.
Beyond, lay the level blue water of the Indian Ocean, stretching away
to the cream-coloured horizon.</p>

<p>The house within doors was a wonder of richness, taste, and
comfort. Everything was of wood, highly finished with polish and
carving, and the colours were combined of various woods. Soft rugs
from India and Persia lay on halls and rooms. Books, pictures,
statuary, rare bric-a-brac, everything that vast wealth and
cultivated taste could command or desire, was to be found in this
splendid residence.</p>

<p>Almost in silence, the strangers passed through the countless
rooms, each differing from the others, and each complete. Mr. Wyville
led the larger party of guests through the place. He had not before
seen it himself; but he was wholly familiar with the plans, which,
indeed, were largely his own.</p>

<p>"But it will have an owner now," he said, "who will better enjoy
its restfulness, and take closer interest in its people."</p>

<p>"But you should rest, too, Mr. Wyville," said Mrs. Little; "the
colony is now settled with your excellent law."</p>

<p>"There is much to be done yet," he said, shaking his head, with
the old grave smile. "I have not even time to wait one day."</p>

<p>There was a general look of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Wyville, surely you will not leave this lovely
place--"</p>

<p>"I must leave to-night," he said; "I am very sorry, but it is
imperative."</p>

<p>Then, not waiting for further comment, he took them out to the
stables and village-like out-houses. There was no regular garden; the
valley itself was garden and farm and forest in one.</p>

<p>Alice Walmsley had lingered behind the others, in a quiet and dim
little room, looking away out to sea. Contentment filled her soul
like low music. She wished to be alone. She had sat only a few
minutes when she heard a step beside her. She did not look up; she
knew whose hand was round her cheek, and standing over her. They did
not say a word; but remained still for a long, long time, Then he
bent over her, turning her face to his. She raised her arms, and he
took her to his breast and lips in the fullness of happiness and
love.</p>

<p>When they left the dim little room, which was ever after to be the
dearest to them in their rich home, they saw the sombre robes of
Sister Cecilia as she sat alone on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Where shall the school be, Sister?" asked Sheridan; "have you
selected your site?"</p>

<p>"She shall build it on the choicest spot that can be found," said
Alice, seating herself beside Sister Cecilia.</p>

<p>"Dictation already!" laughed Sheridan, at which Alice blushed, and
sent him away.</p>

<p>Towards evening there stood on the verandah, having quietly
withdrawn from the guests, Mr. Wyville, Sheridan, and Hamerton. Mr.
Wyville meant quietly to leave, without disturbing the party.</p>

<p>"I am sorry beyond expression," said Sheridan, holding his hand;
"your presence was our chief pleasure. Can you not even stay with us
to-night?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" answered Mr. Wyville, with a look of
affectionate response; "the work yet before me will not bear delay.
Good-bye. God bless you--and yours!"</p>

<p>He walked rapidly away, his horse having been led by Ben Lodge
before him to the entrance.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Sheridan," said Hamerton, suddenly seizing his friend's
hand, "I'm going, too."</p>

<p>"What? You--"</p>

<p>"Stop! Don't try to prevent me. I can't let him go alone. Go in to
your people, and say nothing till to-morrow. Goodbye, my dear
fellow."</p>

<p>That night the steamer returned to Fremantle, having on board Mr.
Wyville and Hamerton.

<h2>THE CONVICT'S PASS.</h2>

<p>ON Mr. Wyville's return from the Vasse, he set himself with
tireless will to the complete organization of the Penal Law. Not
content with writing copious rules for the guidance of warders, he
proposed to visit all the districts in the colony, and personally
instruct the chief officers of depots, from whom the system would
pass directly to their subordinates.</p>

<p>For many days Mr. Hamerton saw little of him, and the time was
heavy on his hands. He intended to purchase land in the colony, and
bring some of his old farmers from England to settle on it.</p>

<p>One day, he went to the prison at Fremantle, and waited for Mr.
Wyville in his office. As he sat there, by a window that looked over
a wide stretch of sandy scrub, he noticed that though the sky was
clear and the heat intense, a heavy cloud like dense vapour hung over
all the lowland. He remembered that for a few days past he had
observed the smoky sultriness of the atmosphere, but had concluded
that it was the natural oppression of the season.</p>

<p>"That vapour looks like smoke," he said to the convict clerk in
the office; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is smoke, sir," said the man. "This is the year for the bush
fires."</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Wyville entered, and their meeting was cordial. Mr.
Wyville, who looked tired, said he had only an hour's writing to do,
after which he would ride to Perth. He asked Hamerton to wait, and
handed him some late English papers to pass the time.</p>

<p>Hamerton soon tired of his reading, and having laid aside the
paper, his eyes rested on Mr. Wyville, who was intently occupied,
bending over his desk. Hamerton almost started with surprise at the
change he observed in his appearance--a change that was not easily
apparent when the face was animated in conversation. When they sailed
from England, Mr. Wyville's hair was as black as a raven; but now,
even across the room, Hamerton could see that it was streaked with
white. The features, too, had grown thin, like those of a person who
had suffered in sickness.</p>

<p>But, when the hour had passed, and he raised his head and looked
smilingly at Hamerton, it was the same striking face, and the same
grand presence as of old. Still, Hamerton could not forget the change
he had observed.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, unable to conceal an unusual affectionate
earnestness, "let us ride to Perth, and rest there--you need
rest."</p>

<p>"Why, I never felt better," answered Mr. Wyville, lightly; "and
rest is rust to me. I never rest unless I am ill."</p>

<p>"You will soon be ill if this continue."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" and as he asked the question, Hamerton saw a
strange light in his eye.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you have overtaxed yourself lately. You are in
danger of breaking down--so you ought to rest."</p>

<p>Hamerton was puzzled to see him shake his head sadly.</p>

<p>"No, no, I am too strong to break down. Death passes some people,
you know; and I am one of the--fortunate."</p>

<p>Hamerton did not like the tone nor the mood. He had never seen him
so before. He determined to hurry their departure. He walked out of
the office and waited in the prison yard. Mr. Wyville joined him in a
few moments.</p>

<p>"I thought this smoke was only a sultry air," Hamerton said;
"where does it come from?"</p>

<p>"I think it comes from Bunbury district; a native runner from
there says the bush is burning for a hundred miles in that
direction."</p>

<p>"Are lives lost in these fires? A hundred miles of flame is hard
to picture in the mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, some unlucky travellers and wood-cutters are surrounded at
times; and the destruction of lower life, birds, animals, and
reptiles, is beyond computation."</p>

<p>"Does not the fire leave a desert behind?"</p>

<p>"For a season only; but it also leaves the earth clear for a new
growth. The roots are not destroyed; and when the rain comes they
burst forth with increased beauty for the fertilizing passage of the
flame."</p>

<p>By this time they were riding slowly towards Perth. The road was
shaded with tall mahoganies, and the coolness was refreshing.
Hamerton seized the opportunity of bringing up a subject that lay
upon his mind.</p>

<p>"You gave me, sir," he said, "some documents in London which you
wished me to keep until our arrival here. Shall I not return them
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville rode on without answering. He had heard; but the
question had come unexpectedly. Hamerton remained silent until he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Do not return them yet," he said at length; "when we get back
from our ride to the Vasse, then give them to me."</p>

<p>"When shall we start?"</p>

<p>"In ten days. By that time my work will be fairly done; and the
rest you spoke of may not come amiss."</p>

<p>"Shall we ride to Sheridan's settlement?"</p>

<p>"O no; we go inland, to the head of the mountain range. Those
papers, by the way, in case anything should happen to me--the
sickness you fear, for instance--belong to one whom we may see before
our return. In such a case, on breaking the outer envelope, you will
find his name. But I may say now, else you might be surprised
hereafter, that he is a native bushman."</p>

<p>"A native! Would he understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he would understand perfectly. He is my heir--heirs
generally understand."</p>

<p>He was smiling as he spoke, evidently enjoying Hamerton's
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Seriously, the package you hold contains my will. It is
registered in London, and it bequeaths a certain section of land in
the Vasse Mountains to the native chief Te-mana-roa, and his heirs
for ever, as the lawyers say. We may see the chief on our ride."</p>

<p>"Then why not give him the package?"</p>

<p>"Because he is a bushman, and might be wronged. With two
influential persons, like you and Sheridan, to support his title,
there would be no question raised. You see I compel you to be my
executor."</p>

<p>"Is he not the grandfather of Koro, of whom she often spoke to
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Wyville, smiling, "and also of Tapairu. This
property will descend to them."</p>

<p>"Are they with the chief now?"</p>

<p>"No; by this time they have reached Mr. Sheridan's happy valley,
where it is probable they will remain. You see, it is possible to
step from the bush into civilization; but it is not quite so pleasant
to step back into the bush--especially for girls. Ngarra-jil, you
observed, had no second thought on the subject; he was a spearman
again the moment he landed."</p>

<p>The ride to Perth was pleasantly passed in conversation; and, on
their arrival, they ordered dinner to be served on the cool
verandah.</p>

<p>While waiting there, a rough-looking man approached and touched
his hat to Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"Be you the Comptroller-General?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, here, you see my ticket, and here's my full discharge.
I want to leave the colony; and I want a pass to King George's Sound,
where I can find a ship going to Melbourne."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville examined the papers; they were all right. The man had
a right to the pass. He rose to enter the hotel to write it, holding
the documents in his hand.</p>

<p>"You're not going to keep them papers, sir, be you?" asked the
man, in evident alarm.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Wyville, looking closely at him; "but if I give you
a pass, you do not need them."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather keep them, sir; I'd rather keep them, even if I
don't get the pass."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have them," said Mr. Wyville, rather surprised at
the fellow's manner. He entered the hotel and wrote the pass.</p>

<p>But, as the hand wrote, the mind turned over the man's words,
dwelling on his last expression, that he would rather have his
ticket-of-leave than take a pass from the colony yet, in any other
country, it was a proof of shame, not a safeguard. The man did not
look stupid, though his words were so. As Mr. Wyville finished
writing, he raised his head and saw Ngarra-jil watching him as usual.
He raised his finger slightly--Ngarra-jil was beside him.</p>

<p>A few words in the native tongue, spoken in a low tone, sent
Ngarra-jil back to his bench, where he sat like an ebony figure till
he saw Mr. Wyville return to the verandah. He then rose and went out
by another door.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville called the ex-convict towards him till he stood in the
strong lamplight. He spoke a few words to him, and gave him his
papers and the pass. The man clumsily thanked him and went off.</p>

<p>"That's an ugly custom," said Hamerton. "I suppose you know it
from his papers. He was strangely restless while you were writing his
pass."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville did not answer, but he took hold of Hamerton's arm,
and pointed to a corner of the street where at the moment the man was
passing under a lamp, walking hurriedly. Following him closely and
silently strode a tall native with a spear.</p>

<p>"Ngarra-jil?" said Hamerton.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought it just as well to know where the man passed the
night," he said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Ngarra-jil came to the verandah, and spoke in
his own language to Mr. Wyville, who was much disturbed by the
message. He wrote a letter, and sent it instantly to the
post-office.</p>

<p>"The callous wretch!" he said, unusually moved. He had gone
straight to Draper, by whom he had been hired to get the pass.
Draper's purpose was plain. He intended to leave the colony, and
desert again his most unfortunate wife, with whose money he could
return comfortably to England.</p>

<p>"What will you do with the miscreant?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Nothing, but take the pass from him."</p>

<p>"But he is a free man. Can you interfere with his movements?"</p>

<p>"No man is allowed to desert his wife, stealing her property. He
can have a pass by asking; but he dare not come here for it. And yet,
I fear to keep him; he may do worse yet. If no change for the better
appear, I shall hasten his departure, and alone, on our return from
the Vasse."</p>

<h2>THE BUSH FIRE</h2>

<p>IT was the afternoon of a day of oppressive heat on which Mr.
Wyville and Hamerton started from Perth to ride to the mountains of
the Vasse. They were lightly equipped, carrying with them the few
necessaries for the primitive life of the bush.</p>

<p>For weeks before, the air had been filled with an irritating
smoke, that clung to the earth all day, and was blown far inland by
the sea-breeze at night.</p>

<p>As the horsemen were leaving Perth, they met a travel-stained
police trooper, carrying the mail from the southern districts. He
recognized the Comptroller General, and saluted respectfully as he
passed.</p>

<p>"Where is the fire, trooper?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"In the Bunbury district, sir, and moving towards the Vasse Road.
It has burnt on the plains inside the sea-hills for three weeks, and
in a day or two will reach the heavy bush on the uplands."</p>

<p>They rode at a steady and rapid pace, conversing little, like men
bent on a long and tedious journey. The evening closed on them when
they were crossing the Darling Range. From the desolate
mountain-road, as they descended, they saw the sun standing large and
red, on the horizon. Before them, at the foot of the range, stretched
a waste of white sand, far as the eye could reach, over which their
road lay.</p>

<p>The setting of the sun on such a scene has an awfulness hard to be
described. The whiteness of the sand seems to increase until it
becomes ghastly, while every low ridge casts a black shadow. During
this time of twilight the sand-plain has a weirdly sombre aspect.
When the night comes in its black shroud or silvery moonlight, the
supernatural effect is dispelled.</p>

<p>As the travellers rode down towards the plain, impressed by this
ghostly hour, Mr. Wyville called Hamerton's attention to two dark
objects moving on the sand at a distance.</p>

<p>Hamerton unslung his field-glass, and looked at the objects.</p>

<p>"A man and a woman," he said, "they are going ahead, and the woman
carries a load like the natives."</p>

<p>Soon after, the sun went down beyond the desert, and the plain was
dark. The horsemen spurred on, oppressed by the level monotony before
them. They had forgotten the travellers who were crossing, the weary
waste on foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hamerton's horse swerved, and a voice in the darkness
ahead shouted something. It was a command from the man on foot,
addressed to the woman, who, in her weariness and with her burden,
had not been able to keep pace with him, and had fallen behind.</p>

<p>"Come along, curse you! or I'll be all night on this plain."</p>

<p>The speaker had not seen nor heard the horsemen, whose advance was
hidden by the night and the soft sand. They rode close behind the
woman, and heard her laboured breathing as she increased her
speed.</p>

<p>A sense of acute sorrow struck at once the hearts of the riders.
They had recognized the voice as that of Draper--they knew that the
miserable being who followed him and received his curses was his
wife.</p>

<p>They rode silently behind her, and halted noiselessly as she came
up with her husband. He growled at her again as she approached.</p>

<p>"I am very tired, Samuel," they heard her say in a low,
uncomplaining voice; "and I fear I'm not as strong as I thought I
was."</p>

<p>She stood a moment as she spoke, as if relieved by the moment's
breathing-space.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said in a hard voice, meant to convey the brutal
threat to her soul; "if you can't keep up, you can stay behind. I'll
stop no more for you; so you can come or stay. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"O, Samuel, you wouldn't leave me in this terrible place alone!
Have pity on me, and speak kindly to me, and I will keep up--indeed,
I'll not delay you any more to-night."</p>

<p>"Have pity on you?" he hissed between his teeth, "you brought me
to this, and I am to have pity on you!"</p>

<p>He turned and strode on in the dark. She had heard, but made no
reply. She struggled forward, though her steps even now were
unsteady.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville, having first attracted her attention by a slight
sound, so that she should not be frightened, rode up to her, and
spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I am the Comptroller-General--do not speak. Give me your burden.
You will find it when you arrive at the inn at Pinjarra."</p>

<p>She looked up and recognized Mr. Wyville; and without a word she
slipped her arms from the straps of the heavy load, and let him lift
it from her.</p>

<p>"God bless you, sir!" she whispered tremulously; "I can walk
easily now."</p>

<p>"Here," said Hamerton, handing her his wine-flask, keep this for
yourself, and use it if you feel your strength failing."</p>

<p>"Where is your husband going?" asked Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>"He is going to the Vasse, sir. A whale ship has come in there,
and he thinks she will take us off."</p>

<p>They rode on, and soon overtook Draper. Mr. Wyville addressed him
in a stern voice.</p>

<p>"If your wife does not reach Pinjarra to-night in safety, I shall
hold you accountable. I overheard your late speech to her."</p>

<p>The surprised caitiff made no reply, and the horsemen passed on.
They arrived at the little town of Pinjarra two hours later.</p>

<p>Next morning, they found that Draper had arrived. Mr. Wyville
arranged with the innkeeper and his wife for Harriet's good
treatment, and also that a stockman's team, which was going to
Bunbury, should offer to take them so far on their way.</p>

<p>It was a long and fatiguing ride for the horsemen that day, but as
the night fell they saw before them, across an arm of the sea, the
lights of a town.</p>

<p>"That is Bunbury," said Mr. Wyville, "the scene of our friend
Sheridan's sandalwood enterprise."</p>

<p>They stopped in Bunbury two days. Mr. Wyville spending his time in
the prison depot, instructing the chief warder in the new system.
They found Ngarra-jil there, with fresh horses. He was to ride with
them next day towards the Vasse.</p>

<p>As they were leaving the town, on the afternoon of the third day,
they met a gang of wood-cutters, carrying bundles on their backs,
coming in from the bush.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the Vasse?" asked one of the wood-cutters, who
was resting by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, keep to the eastward of the Koagulup Swamp and salt
marshes. The fire is all along the other side. We've been burnt out
up that way."</p>

<p>They thanked him, and rode on. Presently, another man shouted
after them--</p>

<p>"There's a man and woman gone on before you, and if they take the
road to the right of the swamp, they'll be in danger."</p>

<p>They rode rapidly, striking in on a broad, straight road, which
had been cleared by the convicts many years before. Mr. Wyville was
silent and preoccupied. Once or twice Hamerton made some passing
remark, but he did not hear.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was dense with the low-lying smoke, and the heat
was almost intolerable.</p>

<p>A few miles south of Bunbury, the road cut clear across a hill.
From the summit, they caught their first sight of the fire. Mr.
Wyville reined his horse, and Hamerton and the bushman followed his
example.</p>

<p>Before them stretched a vast sea of smoke, level, dense, and
grayish white, unbroken, save here and there by the topmost branches
of tall trees, that rose clear above the rolling cloud that covered
all below.</p>

<p>"This is Bunbury racecourse," said Mr. Wyville; "the light
sea-breeze keeps the smoke down, and rolls it away to the eastward.
This fire is extensive."</p>

<p>"Where is our road now?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>"Through the smoke; the fire had not yet reached the plain. See:
it is just seizing the trees yonder as it comes from the valley."</p>

<p>Hamerton looked far to the westward, and saw the sheeted flame,
fierce red with ghastly streaks of yellow, hungrily leaping among the
trees in waves of terrific length. For the first time in his life he
realized the power of the element. It appalled him, as if he were
looking on a living and sentient destroyer.</p>

<p>"We must ride swiftly here," said Mr. Wyville, beginning the
descent; "but the plain is only three miles wide."</p>

<p>In a minute they had plunged into the murky air, and, with heads
bent, drove their horses into a hard gallop. But the animals
understood, and needed a little pressing. With ears laid back, as if
stricken with terror, they flew, swift-footed.</p>

<p>The air was not so deadly as the first breath suggested. The dense
smoke was thickest overhead; beneath was a stratum of semi-pure air.
The heat was far more dangerous than the fumes.</p>

<p>At last they reached the rising ground again, and filled their
lungs with a sense of profound relief. The prospect was now changed,
and for the better.</p>

<p>The fire in their front appeared only on the right of the road. It
stretched in a straight line as far as they could see, burning the
tall forest with a dreadful noise, like the sea on a rocky shore, or
like the combined roar of wild beasts. The wall of flame ran parallel
with the road, about a mile distant.</p>

<p>"It is stopped there by a salt marsh," said Mr. Wyville; "but that
ends some miles in our front."</p>

<p>"Koagulup there," said Ngarra-jil, meaning that where the marsh
ended the great swamp began. The wood-cutters had warned them to keep
to the left of the swamp.</p>

<p>"We must surely overtake those travellers," said Mr. Wyville to
Hamerton, "and before they reach the swamp. They might take the road
to the right, and be lost."</p>

<p>They galloped forward again, and as they rode, in the falling dusk
of night, the fire on the right increased to a glare of terrific
intensity. They felt its hot breath on their faces as if it panted a
few yards away.</p>

<p>Suddenly when they had ridden about two miles, Mr. Wyville drew
rein, looked fixedly into the bush, and then dismounted. He walked
straight to a tall tuad-tree by the roadside, and stooped at its
base, as if searching for something.</p>

<p>When he rose and came back, he had in his hand a long rusty chain,
with a lock on one end.</p>

<p>"You have keen sight, sir," said Hamerton, astonished.</p>

<p>"I did not see it," he answered quietly; "I knew that it was
there. I once knew a man to be chained to that tree."</p>

<p>He tied the chain on his horse's neck, and mounted with more
words. From that moment he seemed to have only one thought--to
overtake and warn those in front.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, they drew rein where the roads divided, one
going to the right, the other to the left of the swamp. The
travellers were not yet in sight.</p>

<p>"Which road have they taken?" asked Hamerton.</p>

<p>Ngarra-jil had leaped from his horse, and was running along the
road to the left. He came back with a disappointed air, and struck in
on the other road. In half a minute he stopped, and cried out some
guttural word.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyville looked at Hamerton, and there were tears in his eyes.
He rode to him, and caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Take the other road with Ngarra-jil, and I will meet you at the
farther end of the swamp. It is only twelve miles, and I know this
bush thoroughly."</p>

<p>Hamerton answered only with an indignant glance.</p>

<p>"Do not delay, dear friend," and Wyville's voice was broken as he
spoke; "for my sake, and for those whose rights are in your hands, do
as I say. Take that road, and ride on till we meet."</p>

<p>"I shall not do it," said Hamerton, firmly, and striking his
horse. "Come on! if there is danger, I must face it with you."</p>

<p>His horse flew wildly forward, terrified by the tremendous light
of the conflagration. Wyville soon overtook him, and they rode
abreast, the faithful bushman a horse's length behind.</p>

<p>On their left, a quarter of a mile distant, stretched the gloomy
swamp, at this season a deadly slough of black mud, with shallow
pools of water. On their right, a mile off, the conflagration leaped
and howled and crashed its falling trees, as if furious at the
barrier of marsh that baulked it of its prey. The bush between the
swamp and the fire was brighter than day, and the horsemen drove
ahead in the white glare.</p>

<p>They saw the road for miles before them. There was no one in
sight.</p>

<p>Five, seven, nine of the twelve miles of swamp were passed. Still
the road ahead was clear for miles, and still no travellers.</p>

<p>As they neared the end of the ride, a portentous change came over
the aspect of the fire. Heretofore it had burned high among the
gum-trees, its red tongues licking the upper air. There was literally
a wall of fire along the farther side of the salt marsh. Now, the
tree-tops grew dark, while the flame leaped along the ground, and
raced like a wild thing straight towards the swamp.</p>

<p>"The fire has leaped the marsh!" said Mr. Wyville.</p>

<p>The whole air and earth seemed instantly to swarm with fear and
horror. Flocks of parrots and smaller birds whirled screaming,
striking blindly against the horsemen as they flew. With thunderous
leaps, herds of kangaroo plunged across the road, and dashed into the
deadly alternative of the swamp. The earth was alive with insect and
reptile life, fleeing instinctively from the fiery death. Great
snakes, with upraised heads, held their way, hissing in terror,
towards the water, while timid bandicoot and wallaby leaped over
their mortal enemies in the horrid panic.</p>

<p>The horses quivered with terror, and tried to dash wildly in the
direction of the swamp.</p>

<p>"Hold on, for your life!" shouted Wyville to Hamerton. "Do not
leave the road."</p>

<p>As they spurred onward, their eyes on the advancing fire, their
hearts stood still one moment at a piercing sound from their rear. It
was a woman's shriek: the agonized cry reached them above all the
horror of the fire.</p>

<p>Hamerton did not know what to do, but he saw Mr. Wyville rein up,
and he did so also. They looked back, and a mile behind saw the two
unfortunates they had come to warn. They had strayed from the road,
and the riders had passed them. The fire had now closed in behind
them, and was driving, them forward with appalling fury.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, ride on!" shouted Mr. Wyville to Hamerton, his
voice barely heard in the savage roar of the conflagration.</p>

<p>"And you?" cried the other, with a knitted brow.</p>

<p>"I am going back for these--I must go back. God bless you!"</p>

<p>He struck his spurs, into his horse, and the animal sprang to the
front. But next instant he was flung back on his haunches by
Ngarra-jil, dismounted, who had seized the bridle. The bushman's eyes
blazed, and his face was set in determination.</p>

<p>"No! no!" he cried in his own language; "you shall no you shall
not! It is death, MOONDYNE! It is death."</p>

<p>Wyville bent forward, broke the man's grasp, speaking rapidly to
him. His words moved the faithful heart deeply, and he stood aside,
with raised hands of affliction, and let him ride forward.</p>

<p>Hamerton did not follow; but he would not try to escape. He sat in
his saddle, with streaming eyes following the splendid heroism of the
man he loved dearest of all the world.</p>

<p>It was a ride that could only be faced by audacious bravery. The
hot breath of the leaping fire was moving the whole bush through
which Wyville rode. The leaves on the trees overhead shrivelled and
smoked. The cinders and burning brambles floated and fell on man and
horse.</p>

<p>But the rider only saw before him the human beings he meant to
save. Nearer and nearer he drew; and he shouted, as best he could, to
cheer them; but they did not hear him.</p>

<p>He saw with straining eyes the man throw up his hands and sink to
the earth; and he saw the woman, faithful to the last, bending over
him, holding the wine flask to his parched lips. He saw her, too,
reach out her arms, as if to shield the fallen one from the cruel
flame that had seized them. Then she breathed the air of fire, and
sank down. Next moment, Wyville leaped from his horse beside
them.</p>

<p>It was too late. The woman had fallen in front of the flame, as if
to keep it from the face of the man who had deserved so little of her
devotion; and still the hand of the faithful dead held to his lips
the draught that might have saved her own life.</p>

<p>One moment, with quivering face, the strong man bent above her,
while his lips moved. Then he raised his head, and faced his own
danger.</p>

<p>Already the fire had cut him off; but it was only the advanced
line of the conflagration that bad reached the water. It was possible
to dash back, by the edge of the swamp.</p>

<p>The awful peril of the moment flashed on him as he rode. The horse
bounded wildly ahead; and the skilled hand guided him for the best.
But, as he flew, other scenes rose before the rider even brighter
than that before him. The present was filled with horror; but the
past overtook him and swept over his heart like a great wave of
peace.</p>

<p>A tree crashed to the earth across his path. He was forced to
drive his horse into the fire to get round the obstacle. The poor
animal reared and screamed, but dashed through the fire, with eyes
scorched and blinded by the flame, now solely dependent on the hand
of its guide. The rider felt the suffering animal's pain, and
recorded it in his heart with sympathy.</p>

<p>It was that heart's last record, and it was worthy of the broad
manhood that had graved it there. He had given his life for men--he
could pity a dumb animal.</p>

<p>By the side of the swamp he was stricken from the saddle by the
branch of a falling tree. His body fell in the water, his head
resting on the tangled rushes of the swamp.</p>

<p>Once, before he died, his opened eyes were raised, and he looked
above him into the sea and forest of fire. But he would not accept
that; but upwards, with the splendid faith of his old manhood, went
the glazing eyes till they rested firmly on the eternal calmness of
the sky. As he looked, there came to him, like a vision he had once
before dimly seen, a great Thought from the deep sky, and held his
soul in rapt communion. But the former dimness was gone; he saw it
clearly now for one instant, while all things were closing peacefully
in upon him.</p>

<p>Then the man's head sank peacefully to its couch, the limbs
stretched out for their lone, rest, the strong heart stopped its
labours.</p>

<p>He was dead.</p>

<p>They found his body next day, unscathed by the fire, preserved by
the water in which he had fallen. Reverent hands lifted the burden
and bore it into the dim recesses of the bush, followed by numerous
dusky mourners.</p>

<p>One white man stood among the children of the forest; but he had
no claim higher than theirs. Above the dead stood the white-haired
chief, Te-mana-roa, bowed in silent grief. A spearwood litter was
made, and the body placed on it. It was raised by the bushmen, who
stood awaiting the old chief's orders.</p>

<p>Te-mana-roa turned to Hamerton, who alone of all the assembly
belonged to the dead man's race. The old chief read profound grief in
his face, and drew closer to him.</p>

<p>"This man belonged to us," he said, laying his dark finger on the
wide brow of the dead; "he was true to my people, and they understood
and loved him better than his own. We shall bury him in the
Vasse."</p>

<p>The litter-bearers moved slowly forward, the old chief took his
place behind the dead, and the bushmen with trailed spears followed
in sad procession.</p>

<p>Hamerton's heart went strongly with the mourners; but he could not
question their right. Two strange spearmen stood near him, to guide
him safely through the bush. The faithful Ngarra-jil was gone, to
mourn by the lonely grave of the MOONDYNE.</p>
