<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>On the spot where the Hotel Moderne now rears its more ambitous
head, there stood at that time a cottage with sloping red-tiled
roof and white-washed walls. It was owned by one Baptiste Portal,
an old peasant of the Dauphiné, who dispensed refreshments to
travellers and passers-by, as his father and grandfather had done
before him, in the shape of somewhat thin <i>vin du pays</i> and an
occasional glass of <i>eau-de-vie</i>, while he spent his slack
time chiefly in grumbling at the fact that the new posting-inn on
the high road had taken all his trade away. He did not see the
necessity of the posting-inn, did not old Baptiste, nor for that
matter that of the high-road or the post-chaise. Before all these
new notions had come into the heads of the government people up in
Paris, travellers had been content to come squelching through the
mud on the back of a good horse, or come ploughing through inches
of dust in the old <i>coche</i>. So why not now? And was not the
old wine of Les Amandiers as good and better than the vinegar
dispensed at the more pretentious posting-inn? The place was called
Les Amandiers because at the back of the house there were two
anaemic almond-trees with gaunt, twisted arms which covered
themselves in the spring with sickly blooms, and in the summer with
dust. In the front of the house, up against the white-washed wall,
there was a wooden bench on which Baptiste's privileged customers
were wont to sit on fine evenings, to drink their <i>vin du
pays</i> and join the old man in his wholesale condemnation of the
government "up in Paris" and its new-fangled ways. From this
vantage-point a glorious view was obtained over the valley of the
Buëche, and beyond Laragne as far as the peaks of Pelvoux: whilest
to the right towered in the distance the grand old citadel of
Sisteron with its turrets and fortifications dating from the
fourteenth century, and the stately church of Notre Dame. But views
and winding rivers, snowy peaks, and mediaeval fortresses did not
interest Baptiste Portal's customers nearly as much as the price of
almonds or the alarming increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>Now, on this particular afternoon in May the mistral was blowing
mercilessly across the valley from over the snows of Pelvoux, and
the cold and the dust had driven all of good Portal's customers
indoors. The low-raftered room, decorated with strings of onions
which hung from the ceiling together with a bunch or two of garlic,
of basil and other pot-herbs, and perfumed also with the aroma of
the <i>pot-au-feu</i> simmering in the kitchen, had acquired just
that right atmosphere, cosy, warm, and odorous, beloved of every
true man born in the Dauphiné. It was a memorable afternoon,
remembered long afterwards and retold by the gossips of Sisteron
and Laragne in all its dramatic details. But at this hour, nothing
more dramatic had occurred than the arrival of a detachment of
soldiers, under the command of an under-officer, who had come up
from Orange, so they said, in order to fetch away the young men who
were wanted for the army. They had demanded supper and shelter for
the night.</p>

<p>Of course soldiers, as soldiers, were very much disapproved of
by those worthies of Sisteron who frequented Les Amandiers, more
especially now when what they did was to fetch away the young men
for cannon-fodder, to fight the English and prolong this awful war
which caused food to be so dear and hands for harvesting so scarce.
But, on the other hand, soldiers, as company, were welcome. They
brought news of the outside world, most of it bad, it is
true&mdash;nothing good did happen anywhere these days&mdash;but
news nevertheless. And though at the recital of what went on in
Paris, in Lyons, or even as near as Orange, the guillotine, the
tumbrils, the wholesale slaughter of tyrants and aristos, one
shuddered with horror and apprehension, there were always the
lively tales of barrack-life to follow, the laughter, the ribald
song, and something of life seemed to infiltrate into this sleepy
half-dead corner of the old Dauphiné.</p>

<p>The soldiers&mdash;there were a score of them&mdash;occupied the
best place in the room, as was only fitting; they sat squeezed
tightly against one another like dried figs in a box, on the two
benches on either side of the centre trestle table. Old Baptiste
Portal sat with them, beside the officer. Some kind of lieutenant
this man appeared to be, or other subaltern: but, oh dear me! these
days one could hardly tell an officer from the rag-tab and bob-tail
of the army, save for the fact that he wore epaulettes. Now this
man&mdash;but there! What was the use of comparing these ruffians
with the splendid officers of the King's armies in the past?</p>

<p>This one certainly was not proud. He sat with his men, joked,
drank with them, and presently he convened friend Portal to a glass
of wine: "<i>A la santé!</i>" he added, "<i>de la République</i>,
and of Citizen Robespierre, the great and incorruptible master of
France!"</p>

<p>Baptiste, wagging his old head, had not liked to refuse, because
soldiers were soldiers and these had been at great pains to explain
to him that the reason why the guillotine was kept so busy was
because Frenchmen had not yet learned to be good Republicans.</p>

<p>"We've cut off the head of Louis Capet and of the widow Capet,
too," the officer had added with grim significance, "but there are
still Frenchmen who are bad patriots and hanker after the return of
the tyrants."</p>

<p>Now Baptiste, like all his like in the Dauphiné, had learned in
childhood to worship God and honour the King. The crime of regicide
appeared to him unforgiveable, like that mysterious sin against the
Holy Ghost which M. le Curé used vaguely to hint at, and which no
one understood. In addition to that, Baptiste greatly resented His
late Majesty King Louis XVI and his august Queen being irreverently
referred to as Louis Capet and the widow Capet. But he kept his own
counsel and silently drank his wine. What his thoughts were at the
moment was nobody's business.</p>

<p>After that, talk drifted to the neighbourhood: the aristos who
still clung to the land which by right belonged to the people.
Neither Baptiste nor his customers&mdash;old peasants from the
district&mdash;were a match for the lieutenant and his corporals in
such discussions. They did not dare argue, only shook their heads
and sighed at the coarse jests which the soldiers uttered against
people and families whom everyone in the Dauphiné knew and
esteemed.</p>

<p>The Frontenacs, for instance.</p>

<p>The talk and the jests had turned on the Frontenacs: people who
had owned the land for as long as the oldest inhabitant could
remember and God only knows how long before that. Well! it appeared
that in the eyes of the Republic the Frontenaces were bad patriots,
tyrants and traitors. Didn't Citizen Portal know that?</p>

<p>No! Portal did not&mdash;he had never been called "citizen"
before, and didn't like it: he was just Baptiste to those who knew
him, quoi?&mdash;nor would he admit that the Frontenacs were
traitors. There was Monsieur, who knew more about cattle and
almonds than any man for leagues around. How could he be a bad
patriot? And Madame, who was very good and pious, and Mademoiselle
who was so ill and delicate. But on this there followed an
altercation&mdash;stern rebuke of Baptiste from the officer for
talking of "Monsieur", of "Madame" and "Mademoiselle". Bah! there
were no aristos left in these days. "Aren't we all citizens of
France?" the lieutenant concluded grandiloquently.</p>

<p>Silence and submission on the part of all the groundlings which
followed the lieutenant's rebuke, somewhat mollified the latter's
aggressive patriotism. He condescended to relate how he had been
deputed to make a perquisition in the house of the Frontenacs, and
if anything was found in the least compromising, then the devil
help the whole brood: their lives would not be worth an hour's
purchase. In fact, in the lieutenant's opinion&mdash;and who better
qualified to hold one?&mdash;the Frontenacs were already judged,
condemned, and as good as guillotined. He held with the "law of the
suspect" lately enacted by the National Assembly, did Lieutenant
Godet.</p>

<p>Again much wagging of heads! "The Committees in all Sections,"
Godet now goes on airily, and proceeds to pick his teeth after that
excellently stewed scrag-end of mutton, "the Committees in all
Sections are ordered in future to arrest all persons who are
suspect."</p>

<p>No one knows what is a Committee, nor yet a Section: but they
are evidently fearsome things. But no matter about them: the thing
is, who are the "suspect" who are thus arrestable?</p>

<p>"The Frontenacs are suspect," the lieutenant explains whilest
sucking his tooth-pick, "and so are all persons who by their
actions&mdash;or&mdash;their writings&mdash;have
become&mdash;er&mdash;suspect."</p>

<p>Not very illuminating, perhaps, but distinctly productive of
awe. The worthies of Sisteron, those who are privileged to sit
close to the centre table and actually to put in a word with the
soldiers, sip their wine in silence. Just below the tiny window at
the end of the room, two charcoal-burners, or wood-cutters&mdash;I
know not what they are&mdash;are lending an attentive ear. They
dare not join in the conversation because they are comparative
strangers, vagabonds really, come to pick up a few sous by doing
menial work too lowering for a local peasant to do. One of them is
small and slender, but looks vigorous; the other, much older, with
stooping shoulders, and grey, lank hair that falls over a wrinkled
forehead. He is harassed by a constant, tearing cough which he
strives in vain to suppress out of respect for the company.</p>

<p>"But," the worthy Portal puts in tentatively, "how does one know
Monsieur le&mdash;I mean, citizen officer, that a person is in
verity suspect?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant explains with a sweeping gesture of the
tooth-pick: "If you are a good patriot, Citizen Portal, you are
able to recognize a Suspect in the street, you can seize him by the
collar then and there, and you may drag him off before the
Committee, who will promptly clap him in prison. And remember," he
added significantly, "that there are forty-four thousand Committees
in France to-day."</p>

<p>"Forty-four thousand?" somebody exclaims.</p>

<p>"And twenty three," Godet replies, gloating over his knowledge
of this trifling detail.</p>

<p>"Forty-four thousand and twenty three," he reiterates, and claps
the table with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"One in Sisteron?" someone murmurs.</p>

<p>"Three!" the lieutenant replies.</p>

<p>"And the Frontenacs are suspect, you say?"</p>

<p>"I shall know that tomorrow," rejoins the other, "and so will
you."</p>

<p>The way he said those last three words caused everyone to
shudder. Over at the far end of the room, the charcoal burner, or
whatever he was, had a tearing fit of coughing.</p>

<p>"'Tis little Fluerette who will weep her eyes out," good old
Baptiste said with a doleful shake of the head, "if anything
happens to Mad&mdash;to the citizens up at the château."</p>

<p>"Fluerette?" the lieutenant asked.</p>

<p>"She is Armand's daughter&mdash;Citizen Armand you
know&mdash;why&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He might well stare, for the officer, for some unaccountable
reason, had burst into a loud guffaw.</p>

<p>"Citizen Armand's daughter, did you say?" he queried at last,
his eyes still streaming with the effort of laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. As pretty a wench as you can see in Dauphiné.
Why shouldn't Armand have a daughter, I'd like to know."</p>

<p>"Do tigers have daughters?" the lieutenant retorted
significantly.</p>

<p>Somehow the conversation languished after that. The fate which
so obviously awaited the Frontenacs, who were known and loved, cast
a gloom over the most buoyant spirits. Not even the salacious
stories of barrack-life, on which the men now embarked with much
gusto, found responsive laughter.</p>

<p>It was getting late, too. Past eight o'clock, and tallow was
dear these days. There was a cart-shed at the back of the house,
with plenty of clean straw: some of the soldiers declared
themselves ready for a stretch there: even the voluble officer was
yawning. The regular customers of Les Amandiers took the hint. They
emptied their mugs, paid over their sous, and trooped out one by
one.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down. There was not a cloud in the sky, which
was a deep, and intense sapphire blue, studded with stars. The
waning moon was not yet up, and the atmosphere was redolent of the
perfume of almond blossoms. Altogether a lovely night, Nature in
her kindest, most gentle mood. Spring in the air and life stirring
in the entrails of the earth in travail. Some of the soldiers made
their way to the shed, whilest others stretched out on the floor,
or the benches of the room, there to dream perhaps of the
perquisition to be made tomorrow and of the tragedy which would
enter like a sudden devastating gust of wind into the peaceful home
of the Frontenacs.</p>

<p>Nature was kind and gentle: and men were cruel and evil and
vengeful. The Law of the Suspect! No more cruel, more tyrannical
law was ever enacted within the memory of civilization. Forty-four
thousand and twenty-three Committees to mow down the flower of the
children of France. A harvest of innocents! And lest the harvesters
prove slack, the National Convention has just decreed that a
perambulating army shall march up and down the country, to ferret
out the Suspect and feed the guillotine. Lest the harvesters prove
slack, men like Lieutenant Godet with a score of out-at-elbows,
down-at-heels brigands, are ordered to scour the country, to seize
and strike. To feed the guillotine, in fact, and to purge the Soil
of Liberty.</p>

<p>Is this not the most glorious revolution the world has ever
known? Is it not the era of Liberty and of the Brotherhood of
Man?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The perambulating army had now gone to rest: some in the
cart-shed, some along the benches and tables or floor of the inn.
The lieutenant in a bed. Is he not the officer commanding this
score of ardent patriots? Therefore he must lie in a bed&mdash;old
Portal's bed&mdash;whilst old Portal himself and his wife, older
and more decrepit than he, can lie on the floor, or in the dog's
kennel for aught Lieutenant Godet cares.</p>

<p>The two wood-cutters&mdash;or shall we call them
charcoal-burners?&mdash;were among the last to leave. They had
petitioned for work among the worthies here present: but money was
very scarce these days, and each man did what work he could for
himself, and did not pay another to do it for him. But Papa
Tronchet, who was a carpenter by trade and owned a little bit of
woodland just by the bridge, close to Armand's cottage, he promised
one of the men&mdash;not both&mdash;a couple of hours' work
tomorrow: wood-cutting at the rate of two sous an hour, and then he
thought it dear.</p>

<p>And so the company had dispersed: each man to his home. The two
vagabonds&mdash;wood-cutters or charcoal-burners, they were anyhow
vagabonds&mdash;found their way into the town. Wearily they
trudged, for one of them was very old and the other lame, till they
reached a narrow lane at right angles to the riverbank. The lane
was made up of stone houses that had overhanging eaves, between
which the sun couldn't ever penetrate. It was invariably either as
damp as the bottom of a well, or as dry and wind-swept as an iron
stove-pipe. Tonight it was dry and hot: broken-down shutters,
innocent of paint, creaked upon rusty hinges. A smell of boiled
cabbage, of stale water and garlic hung beneath the eaves; it came
in great gusts down pitch-dark stairways, under narrow doors,
oozing with sticky moisture.</p>

<p>The two vagabonds turned into one of these doors and by instinct
seemingly, for it was pitch dark, they mounted the stone stairs
that squelched with grease and dirt underneath their feet. They did
not speak a word until they came to the top of the house, when one
of them with a kick of his boot threw open a door; it groaned and
creaked under the blow. It gave on an attic-room with sloping
ceiling, black with the dirt of ages, and with dormer window masked
by a tattered rag that had once been a curtain. There was a wooden
table in the centre of the room, and three chairs, with broken
backs and ragged rush-seats, dotted about. On the table a couple
of tallow candles guttered in pewter sconces.</p>

<p>One of the chairs was drawn close up to the table and on it sat
a young man dressed in a well-worn travelling-coat with heavy boots
on his feet, and a shabby tricorne hat on the top of his head. His
arms were stretched out over the table and his face was buried in
them. He had obviously been asleep when the door was so
unceremoniously thrown open. At the sound he raised his head and
blinked drowsily in the dim light at the newcomers.</p>

<p>Then he stretched out his arms, yawned, and gave himself a shake
like a sleepy dog, and finally exclaimed in English! "Ah! At
last!"</p>

<p>One of the vagabonds&mdash;the one namely who at Les Amandiers
had appeared with bent shoulders and a hacking cough, now
straightened out what proved to be a magnificent athletic figure,
and gave a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"Tony, you lazy dog!" he said, "I've a mind to throw you
downstairs. What say you, Ffoulkes? While you and I have been
breaking our backs and poisoning our lungs with the scent of
garlic, I verily believe that this villain Tony has been fast
asleep."</p>

<p>"By all means, let's throw him downstairs," assented the second
vagabond, now no longer lame, whom his friend had addressed as
Ffoulkes.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do but sleep?" Tony broke in with a
laugh. "I was told to wait, and so I waited. I'd far rather have
been with you."</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't," Ffoulkes demurred, "for then you would have
been dirtier than I, and almost as filthy as Blakeney. Look at him;
did you ever see such a disgusting object?"</p>

<p>"By Gad!" rejoined Blakeney, surveying his own slender hands
coated with coal-dust, grease and grime. "I don't know when I have
been quite so dirty. Soap and water!" he commanded with a lofty
gesture, "or I perish."</p>

<p>But Tony gave a rueful shrug.</p>

<p>"I have a bit of soap in my pocket," he said, and diving into
the capacious pocket of his coat he produced an infinitesimal
remnant of soap which he threw upon the table. "As for water, I
can't offer you any. The only tap in the house is in the back
kitchen which Madame, our worthy landlady, has locked up for the
night. She won't have anything wasted, she tells me, not even
water."</p>

<p>"Fine, thrifty people, your Dauphinois," commented Blakeney,
wisely shaking his head. "But did you try bribery?"</p>

<p>"Yes! But Madame&mdash;I beg your pardon, Citizeness
Martot&mdash;immediately called me a cursed aristo, and threatened
me with some committee or other. I couldn't argue with her, she
reeked of garlic."</p>

<p>"And you, Tony, are an arrant coward," Blakeney rejoined, "where
garlic is concerned."</p>

<p>"I am," Tony was willing to admit. "That's why I am so terrified
of you both at this moment."</p>

<p>They all laughed, and since water was not obtainable, Sir Percy
Blakeney, one of the most exquisite dandies of his time, and his
friend Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, sat down on rickety chairs, in clothes
sticky with dirt, their faces and hands masked by a thick coating
of grime. Down the four walls of the small attic-room fillets of
greasy moistures trickled and mingled with the filth that lay in
cakes upon the floor.</p>

<p>"I can't bear to look at Tony," Blakeney said with a mock sigh,
"he is too demned clean."</p>

<p>"We'll soon remedy that," was Ffoulkes' dry comment.</p>

<p>And behold Sir Andrew Ffoulkes at close grips with Lord Antony
Dewhurst, and this in silence for fear of disturbing the rest of
the house, and bringing attention on themselves. It was a sparring
match in the best style, Blakeney acting as referee, its
object&mdash;to transfer some of the grime that coated the clothes
and hands of Sir Andrew on to the immaculate Lord Tony. They were
only boys after all, these men, who even now were risking their
lives in order to rescue the innocent from the clutches of a bloody
tyranny. They were boys in their love of adventure, and in their
hero worship, and men in the light-hearted way in which they were
prepared for the supreme sacrifice, should luck turn against
them.</p>

<p>The sparring match ended in a call for mercy on the part of Lord
Tony. His face was plastered with grime, his hands as dirty as
those of his friends.</p>

<p>"Tony," Blakeney said finally, when he called a halt, "if her
ladyship were to see you now, she would divorce you."</p>

<p>Vent having been given to unconquerable animal spirits, there
was a quick return to the serious business of the day.</p>

<p>"What is the latest?" Lord Tony asked.</p>

<p>"Just this," Sir Percy replied: "That these hell-hounds have
sent out detachments of soldiers all over the country to ferret out
what they are pleased to call treason. We all know what that means.
Since their iniquitous "Law of the Suspect", no man, woman, or
child is safe from denunciation: now with this perambulating army,
summary arrests occur by the thousand. It seems that at any moment
any of those brigands can seize you by the coat-collar and drag
you before one of their precious committees, who promptly sends
you to the nearest guillotine."</p>

<p>"And you came from a detachment of those brigands, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"We have; Ffoulkes and I spent a couple of hours in their
company, in the midst of fumes of garlic that would have reduced
you, Tony, to a drivelling coward. I vow the smell of it has even
infested my hair."</p>

<p>"Anything to be done?" Tony asked simply. He knew his chief well
enough to perceive the vein of grim earnestness through all this
flippancy.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Blakeney replied. "The squad of brigands who are scouring
this part of France are principally after a family named Frontenac,
which consists of father, mother and an invalid daughter. I had
already found out something about them in the course of the day,
whilst I carted some manure for a farmer close by. Beastly stuff,
manure, by the way! I tried to get into touch with Monsieur, who is
a stubborn optimist, and does not believe that any man could mean
harm to him or to his family. I went to him in the guise of a
royalist agent, supposed to have inside information of impending
arrests. He simply refused to believe me. Well! we've met that type
of man before. He will have a terrible awakening tomorrow."</p>

<p>Sir Percy paused for a moment or two, a deep frown between his
brows. His keen intellect, alive to all those swift tragedies which
he had devoted his life to countermine, was already at work
envisaging the immediate future, the personages of the coming
drama, husband, wife, invalid daughter; then the perquisition, the
arrest, summary condemnation and slaughter of three helpless
innocents.</p>

<p>"I can't help being sorry for the man," he said after awhile,
"though he is an obstinate fool! but it is the wife and daughter
whom we cannot allow those savage beasts to capture and to kill. I
caught sight of them. The girl is pathetic, frail and crippled. I
couldn't bear&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly. No need to say more, of course; they
understood one another, these men who had braved death so often
together for love of humanity and for love of sport. Blakeney
silent, one firm, slender hand clutched upon the table, was working
out a problem of how to rescue three helpless people from that
certain death-trap which was already laid for them. The other two
waited in equal silence for orders. The League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel! pledged to help the innocent and to save the helpless!
One to command, nineteen to obey: the two who were here, in this
filthy, dark attic-room, were the chief's most trusted officers;
but the others were not far away!</p>

<p>Seventeen others! scattered about the countryside, disguised,
doing menial work in order to keep in touch with the population,
spying, hiding in woods or huts: all of them under orders from
their chief, and prepared for the call from him.</p>

<p>"Tony," Blakeney said at last, "you'd better find Hastings and
Stowmaries at once and they must pass the word round to others. I
want three of them&mdash;they can draw lots for that&mdash;to go to
the Four Oaks and there to remain until I can send Ffoulkes to them
with full instructions. When you've done that, I want you and
Ffoulkes to spend the night in and about Les Amandiers, and gather
what you can of the projects of these brigands by keeping your ears
open. I'll keep in touch with you from time to time."</p>

<p>"You think," Ffoulkes put in, "that we'll have trouble with the
Frontenacs?"</p>

<p>"Not with the ladies, of course," Blakeney replied. "We'll get
them safely out of the way before the perambulating army of jackals
arrives. With God's help we ought to have enough time to gather a
few valuables together. The problem will be with that obstinate,
tiresome man. I feel sure he won't move until the soldiers are
hammering at his door. Anyway I shall know my way in and about the
château by tomorrow morning, and will then get into touch with you
both at Les Amandiers."</p>

<p>He rose: a tall, straight figure on whom the filthy clothes of a
vagabond sat with strange incongruity. But even in this strange
garb which was grotesque as well as degrading, there was an
extraordinary dignity in the carriage of the head, the broad
shoulders, the firm, long Anglo-Saxon limbs, but above all in the
flash of the eyes beneath their heavy lids and in the quiet,
low-toned voice so obviously accustomed to be heard and obeyed. The
two others were ready on the instant to act according to
instructions: to act without argument or question. The fire of
excitement was in their eyes: the spirit of adventure, of sport for
sport's sake, had them in its grip.</p>

<p>"Do I go with you now, Blakeney?" Ffoulkes asked, as his chief
had remained for a moment standing, as if following a train of
thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," Blakeney replied. "And by the way, Ffoulkes, and you too,
Tony, while you are at Les Amandiers try and find out about this
girl Fleurette the old innkeeper spoke about. He said that the girl
would cry her eyes out if anything happen to the Frontenacs. You
remember?"</p>

<p>"I do. He also said that she was as pretty a wench as could be
found in the Dauphiné," Ffoulkes put in with a smile.</p>

<p>"Her father is named Armand," Blakeney rejoined.</p>

<p>"And the lieutenant called him a tiger, rather enigmatically I
thought."</p>

<p>"This Fleurette sounds like an engaging young person," Lord Tony
commented with a smile.</p>

<p>"And should be useful in our adventure," Blakeney concluded.
"Find out what you can about her."</p>

<p>He was the last to leave the room. Ffoulkes and Lord Tony had
already gone down the stone staircase, feeling their way through
the darkness. But Sir Percy Blakeney stood a minute or two longer,
erect, silent, motionless. Not Sir Percy Blakeney, that is, the
elegant courtier, the fastidious fop, the spoilt child of London
society, but the daring adventurer, ready now as so often before,
to throw his life into the balance to save three innocent people
from death. Would he succeed? Nay! that he did not for a moment
doubt. Not for a moment. He would save the Frontenacs as he had
saved scores of helpless men, women and children before, or leave
his bones to moulder in this fair land where his name had become
anathema to the tigers that fed on the blood of their kindred. The
true adventurer! Reckless of risks and dangers, with only the one
goal in view: Success.</p>

<p>Sport? Of course it was sport! grand, glorious, maddening sport!
Sport that made him forget every other joy in life, every comfort,
every beatitude. Everything except the exquisite wife who in
far-off England waited patiently, with deadly anxiety gnawing at
her heart, for news of the man she worshipped. She, perhaps, the
greatest heroine of them all.</p>

<p>With a quick sigh, half of impatience, half of longing, Sir
Percy Blakeney finally blew out the tallow-lights and made his way
out into the open.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>The house where Fleurette was born and where she spent the first
eighteen years of her life, still stands about halfway down the
road between Sisteron and Serres and close to Laragne, which was
then only a village nestling in the valley of the Buëche. To get to
it you must first go cautiously down the slope at the head of the
old stone bridge, and then climb up another slope to the front door
beside the turbulent little mill stream, the soft gurgle of which
had lulled Fluerette to sleep ever since her tiny ears had wakened
to earthly sounds.</p>

<p>The house is a tumble-down ruin now, only partly roofed in:
doors and shutters are half off their hinges: the outside staircase
is worm-eaten and unsafe, the white-washed walls are cracked and
denuded of plaster; the little shrine above the door has long been
bereft of its quaint, rudely painted statue of St. Anthony of Padua
with the Divine Child in his arms. But the wild vine still clings
to the old walls, and in the gnarled branches of the old walnut
tree, a venturesome pair of blackbirds will sometimes build their
nest.</p>

<p>A certain atmosphere of mystery and romance still lingers in the
tiny dell, and when we fly along the road in our twentieth-century
motor-car, we are conscious of this romantic feeling, and we
exclaim: "Oh! how picturesque!" and ask the chauffeur to halt upon
the bridge, and then get our Kodaks to work.</p>

<p>Perhaps when the plate is developed and we look upon the print,
we fail to recapture that sense of a picturesque by-gone age, and
wonder why we wasted a precious film on what is nothing but a
tumble-down old cottage, and why so many tumble-down old cottages
are left to crumble away and disfigure the lovely face of France.
But a century and a half ago, when Fluerette was born, there was an
almond tree beside the front door, which in the early spring looked
as if covered with pink snow. In those days the shutters and the
doors and the outside staircase were painted a beautiful green, the
walls were resplendent with fresh white-wash every year. In those
days too the wild vine turned to a brilliant crimson in the autumn,
and in June the climbing rose was just a mass of bloom. Then in May
the nightingale often sang in the old walnut-tree, and later on,
when Fluerette was tall enough, she always kept a bunch of
forget-me-nots in a glass, in the recess above the front door, at
the foot of St. Antoine de Padoue, because, as is well known, he is
the saint to appeal to in case one has lost anything one values.
One just made the sign of the cross and said fervently "<i>St.
Antoine de Padoue priez pour nous!</i>" and lo! the kindly saint
would aid in the search, and more often than not the lost treasure
would be found.</p>

<p>All this was, of course, anterior to the horrible events which
in a few days transformed the genial, kindly people of France into
a herd of wild beasts thirsting for each other's blood, and before
legalized cruelty, murder and regicide had arraigned that fair land
at the bar of history, and tarnished her fair fame forever.
Fluerette was just eighteen when the terrible events came to pass
that threatened to wreck her young life, and through which she
learned not only how cruel and evil man could be, but also to what
height of self-abnegation and heroism they could at times
ascend.</p>

<p>Fluerette's birthday was in May, and that day was always for her
the gladdest day of the year. For one thing she could reckon on
Bibi being home&mdash;Bibi being the name by which she had called
her father ever since she had learned to babble. Fleurette had no
mother, and she and Bibi just worshipped each other. And of course
Bibi had come home for her eighteenth birthday, and had stayed
three whole days, and he had brought her a lovely shawl, one that
was so soft and fleecy that when you rubbed your cheek against it,
it felt just like a caress from a butterfly's wing.</p>

<p>Old Louise&mdash;who had looked after the house and watched over
Fluerette ever since Fluerette's mother had gone up to heaven to be
with the <i>bon Dieu</i> and all the Saints&mdash;old Louise had
cooked a delicious dinner, which was a very difficult thing to do
these days when food was scarce and dear, and eggs, butter and
sugar only for the very rich who could bribe M'sieu' Colombe, the
<i>épicier</i> of the Rue Haute, to let them have what they wanted.
But no matter! Old Louise was a veritable genius where a dinner was
concerned, and M'sieu' Colombe, the grocer, and M'sieu' Duflos the
butcher, had allowed her to have all she asked for: a luscious
piece of meat, three eggs, a piece of butter, and this without any
extra bribe. Then there were still half a dozen bottles of that
excellent red wine which Bibi had bought in the happy olden days;
and he had opened one of the bottles, and Fluerette had drunk some
wine and felt very elated and altogether happy&mdash;but for this
there was another reason of which more anon.</p>

<p>Of course the latter part of the day had been tinged with
sadness, again for that one reason which will appear presently: but
not only because of that, but because of Bibi's departure, which it
seems, could not be postponed, although Fluerette begged and begged
that he should remain at least until tomorrow so as not to spoil
this most perfect day. <i>Le bon Dieu</i> alone knew when Fluerette
would see Bibi again, his absences from home had of late become
more frequent and more prolonged.</p>

<p><i>Mais voilà!</i> on one's eighteenth birthday one is not going
to think of troubles until the very last minute when it is actually
on the doorstep. And the day had been entirely glorious. Not a
cloud: the sky of such a vivid blue that the forget-me-nots that
grew in such profusion beside the stream looked pale and colourless
beneath it. The crimson peonies behind the house were in full
bloom, and the buds of the climbing rose on the point of
bursting.</p>

<p>And now dinner was over. Louise was busy in the kitchen washing
up the plates and dishes, and Fluerette was carefully putting away
the beautiful silver forks and spoons which had been brought out
for the occasion. She was putting them away in the fine leather
case with the molleton lining, which set off the glistening silver
to perfection, and little Fluerette felt happy and very contented.
She worked away in silence because Bibi had leaned his darling old
head against the back of his chair, and closed his eyes. Fluerette
thought he had dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>He looked thin and pale, the poor dear, and there were lines of
anxiety and discontent around his thin lips: his hair too had of
late been plentifully sprinkled with gray. Oh! how Fluerette longed
to have him here at Lou Mas. Always and always. It was the only
home she had ever known; dear, beautiful, fragrant Lou Mas. Here
she would tend him and care for him until all those lines of care
upon his face had vanished. And what more likely to bring a smile
to his lips than dear old Lou Mas with its white-washed walls and
red-tiled roofs, with its green shutters and little mill streams
beside which, for nine months of the year, flowers grew in such
profusion; violets, forget-me-nots, and lilies of the valley in the
spring, and meadowsweet throughout the summer until an early frost
cut them down?</p>

<p>As for this room, Fluerette knew that there could not be in the
whole of France, anything more beautiful or more cosy. There was
the beautiful walnut side-board, polished until it shone like a
mirror, there were the chairs covered in crimson rap, rather faded
it is true, but none the worse for that, and there was Bibi's
special armchair adorned with that strip of tapestry which
Fluerette had worked in cross-stitch, expressly for his birthday
the year of her first communion. Never had there been such chairs
anywhere. And that beautiful paper on the walls, the red and yellow
roses that looked as if you could pick them off their lovely
chocolate-coloured ground, and the chandelier with the crystal
drops, and the blue vases with the gold handles that adorned the
mantelpiece, not to mention the print curtains and the pink and
blue check cloth upon the table. Oh, Fluerette loved all these
things, they had been the playthings of her childhood and now they
were her pride. If only Bibi would smile again, she felt that the
whole world would be like heaven.</p>

<p>And then all at once everything went wrong. Fluerette had got
her beautiful new shawl out of its wrappings and draped it round
her shoulders and rubbed her cheek against it. Then she had said
quite innocently: "It is so lovely, Bibi, and the wool is so soft
and fine. I am sure that it came from England."</p>

<p>And it was from that moment that everything went wrong. To begin
with, and quite by accident, of course, Bibi broke the stem of the
glass out of which he had been drinking, and a quantity of very
precious wine was spilt over the beautiful tablecloth.</p>

<p>Whereupon, unaccountably, because of course the table cloth
could be washed, Bibi pushed his plate aside quite roughly and
suddenly looked ten years older; so wan and pale and shrivelled and
old. Fluerette longed to put her arms round him&mdash;as she used
to do in the happy olden days&mdash;and ask him to tell her what
was amiss. She was grown up now&mdash;eighteen years old
today&mdash;quite old enough to understand. And if Bibi loved her
as she thought he did, he would be comforted.</p>

<p>But there it was! There was something in the expression on
Bibi's face that checked Fluerette's impulse. She went on
quietly&mdash;very quietly, like a little mouse&mdash;with her
work, and for a while there was silence in the cosy room with the
beautiful roses on the wall that looked as if you could pick them
off their chocolate ground: a silence that was unaccountably full
of sadness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Bibi was the first to hear the sound of footsteps coming up to
the door. He gave a start, just as if he were waking from a
dream.</p>

<p>"It's M'sieu' Colombe," Fluerette said.</p>

<p>At once Bibi reproved her, a thing he hardly ever did: "Citizen
Colombe," he said sternly.</p>

<p>Fluerette shrugged her plump shoulders: "Ah well&mdash;!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You must learn, Fluerette," Bibi insisted, still with unwonted
severity. "You are old enough to learn."</p>

<p>She said nothing more; only kissed the top of his head, the
smooth brown hair, of late so plentifully tinged with grey, and
promised that she would learn. She stood by the sideboard intent on
putting the silver away, with her back turned to Bibi so that he
could not see the soft tone of pink that had crept into her cheeks,
as soon as she perceived that two pairs of feet were treading the
path outside the door.</p>

<p>Now there was a vigorous knock against the door, and a cheery,
raucous voice called out loudly: "May one enter?"</p>

<p>Fluerette ran to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"But certainly, certainly," she said, and then added, seemingly
very astonished: "Ah! and M'sieu' Amédé, too?" From which the
casual observer would perhaps infer that the pink colour in her
cheeks had been due to the arrival of M'sieu' Colombe, the
<i>épicier</i> of the Rue Haute, rather than to that of his son
Amédé. It was no doubt also that worthy <i>épicier</i> with his
round, florid face, dark, twinkling eyes, and general air of
ferocious kindliness that caused the pink colour to spread from
Fluerette's cheeks down to her neck and the little bit of throat
that peeped out above her kerchief.</p>

<p>The good Colombe had already stalked into the room and with a
familiar "Eh bien! Eh bien! We did contrive to come and drink
Fluerette's health after all?" had slapped Bibi vigorously over the
lean shoulders. But Amédé had come to a halt on the mat in which he
was mechanically wiping his boots as if his very life depended on
their cleanliness. Between his fingers he was twirling an immense
posy of bright pink peonies, but his eyes were fixed on Fluerette,
and on his broad, plain face, which shone with perspiration and
good temper, there was a half-shy, wholly adoring look.</p>

<p>He gulped hard once or twice before he murmured, hoarse with
emotion:</p>

<p>"Mam'zelle Fluerette!"</p>

<p>And Fluerette wiped her hot little hand against her apron before
she whispered in shy response:</p>

<p>"M'sieu' Amédé!"</p>

<p>Not for these two the new fangled "citoyen" and "citoyenne"
decreed in far-off Paris. To their unsophisticated ears the clamour
of a trumpet-tongued revolution only came as an unreal and distant
echo.</p>

<p>Amédé appeared to have finished cleaning his boots, and
Fluerette was able to close the door behind him before she held out
her hand for the flowers which he was too bewildered to offer.</p>

<p>"Are those beautiful flowers for me, M'sieu' Amédé?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"If you will deign to accept them, Mam'zelle Fluerette?" he
replied.</p>

<p>She was eighteen and he was just twenty. Neither of them had
ever been away more than a few hours from their remote little
village of Dauphiné where they were born&mdash;she in the little
house with the green shutters, and he in the Rue Haute above the
shop where his father, Hector Colombe, had sold tallow-candles and
sugar, flour and salt, and lard and eggs to the neighbours, ever
since he had been old enough to help his father in the business.
And when Amédé was four, and Fluerette two, they had made mud pies
together in the village street with water from the fountain, and
Amédé had warded Fluerette against the many powerful enemies that
sometimes threatened her and caused her to scream with terror, such
as M'sieu' Duflos, the butcher's dog, or Achille the
garde-champetre with his ferocious scowl, or Ma'ame Amelie's
geese.</p>

<p>They had sat together&mdash;not side by side, you understand,
but the boys on the right side of the room and the girls on the
left&mdash;in the little class-room where M. le Curé taught them
their alphabet and subsequently the catechism; and also that two
and two make four. They had knelt side by side in the little
primitive church at Laragne, their little souls overburdened with
emotion and religious fervour, when they made their first communion:
Fluerette in a beautiful white dress, with a wealth of white roses
on her fair hair, and a long tulle veil that descended right down
to her feet; and Amédé in an exquisite cloth coat with brass
buttons, a silk waistcoat, buckled shoes and a white ribbon sash on
his left arm.</p>

<p>And when Amédé had been old enough to be entrusted with his
father's errands over at Serres, a couple of leagues away,
Fluerette had climbed behind him on the saddle, and with her arms
round his waist, so as to keep herself steady, they had ridden
together along the winding road white with dust, Ginette, the good
old mare, ambling very leisurely as if she knew that her riders
were in no hurry to get anywhere that day.</p>

<p>And now Fluerette was eighteen and Amédé twenty, and her hair
was like ripe corn, and her eyes as blue as the sky on a midsummer
morn, whilst her mouth was dewy and fragrant as a rose in June. No
wonder that poor Amédé felt as if his feet were of lead and his
neck too big for his cravat, and when presently she asked him to
fill a vase with water out of the carafe so that she could place
the beautiful flowers in it, is it a wonder that he spilt the water
all over the floor, seeing that his clumsy hands met her dainty
fingers around the neck of the carafe?</p>

<p>The good Hector pretended to be very angry with his son for his
clumsiness.</p>

<p>"Voyez-moi cet imbécile!" he said in that gruff voice of his
which had become a habit with him, because he had to use it all day
in order to ward off the naughty village urchins who tried to steal
the apples out of his shop.</p>

<p>"Mam'zelle Fluerette, why don't you box his ears?"</p>

<p>Which, of course, was a very funny proposition that caused
Fleurette and Amédé to laugh immoderately first and then to whisper
and to chaff whilst they mopped the water off the tiled floor. And
the good Hector turned once more to Bibi, and shaking his powerful
fist at nothing in particular, he brought it down with a crash
upon the table.</p>

<p>"And now those gredins, those limbs of Satan are taking him away
for cannon-fodder! Ah! the devils! the pigs! the pig-devils!"</p>

<p>Bibi looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Taking him away, are they?" he asked dryly. Then he added with
an indifferent shrug of the shoulders: "Amédé is twenty, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"What's that to do with their dragging him away from me, when I
want him to help in the shop?" Hector retorted with what he felt
was unanswerable logic.</p>

<p>"What would be the good of keeping shop, my good Hector," Bibi
rejoined simply, "if France was invaded by foreigners as she is
already ruined by traitors?"</p>

<p>"Well! And isn't she ruined now by all those devils up in Paris
who can think of nothing better than war or murder?" growled Hector
Colombe, heedless of the quick gesture of warning which Bibi had
given him.</p>

<p>Adèle, the girl from the village who gave old Louise a hand
about the house when Bibi was at home, had just come in from the
kitchen with a pile of plates and dishes which she proceeded to
range upon the dresser. Hector shrugged his big shoulders. Whoever
would think of taking notice of Adèle? A wench who got five souls a
day for scrubbing floors! An undersized, plain-faced creature with
flat feet and red elbows. Bah!</p>

<p>But Bibi still put up a warning finger:</p>

<p>"Little pitchers have long ears," he said in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh! I know, I know," Hector rejoined gruffly. "It is the
fashion these days for us all to spy upon one another. A pretty
pass they have brought us to," he added, "your friends in
Paris."</p>

<p>To this Bibi made no reply. No doubt he knew that it was
impossible to argue with Hector, once the worthy <i>épicier</i> was
in one of his moods. Adèle had finished her task and glided out of
the room, silent, noiseless, furtive as a little rat, which she
vaguely resembled with small, keen eyes, and pointed nose and chin.
In a corner of the room, by the window, still busy with those
flowers which seemingly would not set primly in the vase, Fluerette
and Amédé were talking under their breath.</p>

<p>"I'm going away, Mam'zelle Fluerette," said he.</p>

<p>"Going away, M'sieu' Amédé? Whither? When?"</p>

<p>"They want me in the army."</p>

<p>"What for?" she asked naïvely.</p>

<p>"To fight against the English."</p>

<p>"But you won't go, will you, M'sieu' Amédé?"</p>

<p>"I must, Mam'zelle Fluerette."</p>

<p>"Oh, but what shall I&mdash;I mean, what will M'sieu' Colombe
do? You must remain here, to help him in the shop." And fight
against it as she would, there was an uncomfortable little lump in
her throat when she pictured how terribly lost M'sieu' Colombe
would be without his son.</p>

<p>"Father is very angry," Amédé said rather hoarsely, because he
too had an uncomfortable lump in his throat now. "But it seems
there's nothing to be done. I have to go."</p>

<p>"When?" Fluerette murmured, so softly, so softly, that only a
lover's ears could possibly have caught the whisper.</p>

<p>"I have to present myself tomorrow," Amédé replied, "before
M'sieu' le Commissaire de Police at Serres."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow? And I have been so happy today!"</p>

<p>The cry came from an overburdened little heart, brought face to
face with its first sorrow. Fluerette no longer attempted to keep
back her tears, and Amédé, not quite sure whether he should cry
because he was going away or dance with joy because it was his
going away that was making Fluerette cry, but in time by wiping his
face which was streaming with perspiration and tears.</p>

<p>"I wish I could at least have seen those children wedded," the
worthy <i>épicier</i> muttered in the interval of blowing his nose
with a noise like a cloudburst. "At least," he added with the good
round oath which he reserved for occasions such as these, "before
they take my Amédé away."</p>

<p>Bibi on the other hand appeared to be more philosophical.</p>

<p>"We must wait for better times," he said, "and anyhow Fluerette
is too young to marry."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Parting is not such sweet sorrow as the greatest of all poets
would have us believe. At any rate Fleurette did not find it at all
sweet, on this her eighteenth birthday, which should have been a
very happy one.</p>

<p>It was bad enough saying "adieu" to Bibi. But Fleurette was
accustomed to that. Of late Bibi had been so often and so long
absent from home: sometimes weeks&mdash;nay! months&mdash;would
elapse, and there would be no Bibi to fondle Fleurette and bring
life and animation within those white-washed walls that held all
that was dearest to her in the world. It was undoubtedly
heart-rending to bid Bibi adieu: but in a way, one knew that the
darling would come back to Lou Mas as soon as he was able, come for
one of those surprise visits that made Fleurette as gay as a linnet
all the while they lasted. But to say goodbye to Amédé was a
different matter. He was going into the army. He was going to fight
the English. <i>Le Bon Dieu</i> alone knew if Amédé would ever come
back. Perhaps he would be killed. Perhaps&mdash;oh!
perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Never in her life had Fleurette been so sad.</p>

<p>And now the last of the goodbyes had been said. Bibi,
accompanied by M'sieu' Colombe and Amédé, had walked away in the
direction of the village, where he would pick up his horse, and
start along the main road that led to Serres and thence to
Paris.</p>

<p>Fleurette remained on the bridge for some time, shading her eyes
against the sun, because they ached so from all the tears which she
had shed. The three men had become mere specks, 'way down the road:
old Louise had gone back to her kitchen with Adèle, only Fleurette
remained standing on the bridge alone. Tears were still running
down her cheeks, whilst with aching eyes she strove to catch a last
sight of Bibi as he and his two companions disappeared round the
bend of the road. Or was it Amédé she was trying to see?</p>

<p>The afternoon sun had spread a mantle of gold over the snowy
crests of Pelvoux: on the sapphire sky myriads of tiny clouds
seemed to hold hearts of living flame in their fleecy bosoms. The
wavy ribbon of the Buëche was like a giant mirror that reflected a
whole gamut of glowing tints, blue and gold, and purple, whilst on
the winding road, the infinitesimal atoms of dust seemed like
low-lying clouds of powdered topaz. Suddenly in the direction of
Sisteron those clouds rose, more dense: something more solid than
powdered topaz, animated the distance: grew gradually more tangible
and then became definite. Fleurette now could easily distinguish
ten or a dozen men coming this way. They all wore red caps on their
heads. Ahead of them came a man on horseback. He wore a tricorne
hat, adorned with a tricolour cockade, and the sun drew sparks of
flame from the steel bit in his horse's mouth and from the brass
bosses and buckles on the harness.</p>

<p>Now Fleurette could hear the dull stamping of hoofs on the dusty
road, and the tramping of heavy, weary footsteps: and she watched,
fascinated, these men coming along.</p>

<p>All at once the rider put his horse to a trot, and the next
moment he reined in on the bridge. He put out his hand and cried a
sharp: "Halte!" whereupon the other men all came to a halt.
Fleurette stood there wondering what all this meant. Vaguely she
guessed that these men must be soldiers, though, of a truth, with
the exception of the one on horseback and who appeared to be their
officer, there was very little that was soldierly about them. Their
red caps were of worsted, and adorned with what had once been a
tricolour cockade, but was now so covered with dust that the
colours were well-nigh indistinguishable. The men's coats, too,
once blue in colour and fitted with brass buttons, were torn and
faded, with several buttons missing: their breeches were stained
with mud, they had no stocking inside their shoes, and it would
have been impossible to say definitely whether their shirts had
been of a drabby grey when they were new, or whether they had
become so under stress of wear and dirt. Fleurette's recollection
flew back to the smart soldiers she used to see when she was a tiny
tot and Bibi took her to Serres or Sisteron on fête days when the
military band would march past in their beautiful clothes all
glittering with brass buttons, and their boots polished up so that
you could almost see yourself in them.</p>

<p>But there! every one knew that these were terribly hard times
and that new clothes were very, very dear: So Fleurette supposed
that the poor soldiers had to wear out their old ones just like
everybody else. And her sensitive little heart gave an extra throb
or two, for she had suddenly remembered that M'sieu' Amédé would
also be a soldier very soon, wearing a shabby coat, and perhaps no
stockings inside his shoes. Still thinking of M'sieu' Amédé, she
was very polite to the man on horseback, although he was
unnecessarily abrupt with her, asking her gruffly whether Citizen
Armand was within.</p>

<p>Fleurette said "No!" quite gently, and then, choosing to ignore
the coarse manner in which the man uttered a very ugly oath, she
went on: "Father has been gone a quarter of an hour and more, and
if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Citizen Armand, I asked for," the officer broke in roughly,
"not our father."</p>

<p>"Father's name is Armand," Fleurette said, still speaking very
politely. "I thought you were asking for him."</p>

<p>The horseman, she thought, realizing his mistake, should have
excused himself for speaking so rudely: but he did nothing of the
sort. He just shrugged his shoulders and said in a very curious way,
which sounded almost like a sneer:</p>

<p>"Oh! is that how it is? You are Citizen Armand's daughter, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes! M'sieu' l'officier."</p>

<p>"Call me citizen lieutenant," the man retorted roughly. "Hasn't
your father taught you to speak like a good patriot?"</p>

<p>Fleurette would not have admitted for the world that she was
half-afraid of this unkempt, unshaved officer with the gruff voice,
but she felt intimidated, shy, ill at ease. She would have given
worlds to have some one friendly beside her, old Louise, or even
Adèle.</p>

<p>"Shall I call Ma'ame Louise," she suggested, "to speak with
her?"</p>

<p>"No," the man replied curtly, "what's the use if your father
isn't there? Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"To the village first, M'sieu'&mdash;I mean citizen, to pick up
his horse which he always leaves at M'sieu' Colombe's stables. He
is going to Paris afterwards."</p>

<p>"How far is it to the village?"</p>

<p>"Less than a quarter of a league&mdash;er&mdash;citizen."</p>

<p>"And the house," the officer asked again, "where the
<i>ci-devant</i> Frontenacs live, is that far?"</p>

<p>"About half a league by the road from here," Fleurette replied,
"the other side of the village. There is a short cut behind this
house, past the mill, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man, however, was no longer listening to what she said. He
muttered something that sounded very like an oath, and then turned
to the soldiers: "Allons! Marche!" he commanded sharply. The men
appeared terribly dusty and tired and hardly made a movement to
obey: at the first call of "Halte", some of them had thrown
themselves down by the edge of the road and stretched out full
length on the heaps of hard stones pile up there; others had
wandered down the slope by the bridge, and lying flat on the ground
were slaking their thirst in the cool, clear water of the stream.
Fleurette was very sorry for them.</p>

<p>"May they wait a moment, M'sieu' le&mdash;I mean, citizen
lieutenant," she pleaded. "I'll get them something to drink. We
haven't much, but I know Louise won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the officer took no further notice either of her or of the
men. Having given his order to march, he had readjusted the reins
in his hands, and struck his spurs somewhat viciously into his
horse's flanks. The horse reared and plunged for a moment, then
started off at a sharp trot, clouds of dust flying out from under
its hoofs.</p>

<p>The men made an effort to rise. Fleurette put up a finger and
smiled at them all.</p>

<p>"Wait one minute," she said, and ran quickly back into the
house.</p>

<p>There was the best part of a bottle left of that good red wine:
Bibi had not touched it again after he broke the stem of his glass.
Fleurette had picked up the bottle and taken a tin mug from the
dresser and was about to start out again before Louise thought of
asking her what she was up to.</p>

<p>"There are some poor, tired soldiers outside on the bridge,"
Fleurette replied, "I want to take them something to drink. There's
not much of it, and twelve of them to share it, but it will be
better than nothing, and perhaps <i>le bon Dieu</i> will make a
miracle and make it be enough. They seemed so thirsty, poor
dears."</p>

<p>"Let Adèle go," Louise said curtly. "I don't like you speaking
with those vagabonds."</p>

<p>And while Adèle ran out, as she was bid, with mug and bottle,
Louise continued to mutter half under her breath:</p>

<p>"I can't abide these sans-culottes. Brigands the lot of them.
What are they doing in the neighbourhood, I'd like to know. Up to
no good you may depend. Let Adèle talk to them. It is not fit for a
well-brought-up wench like you to be seen in such company."</p>

<p>Fleurette did not pay much attention to old Louise's mutterings.
There was plenty to do in the house with washing up and tidying
things away. And it was Louise's habit to grumble at anything that
was in any way unusual: a wet day in August, or a mild one in
December, a <i>calèche</i> on the road, a horseman, a soldier, or a
letter for Bibi. She was always called "old Louise" although, in
truth, she had scarce reached middle age; but her skin was dry and
rough like the soil of her native Dauphiné, her face and hands were
prematurely wrinkled, and her voice had become harsh of late,
probably for want of use, like a piece of mechanism that has stood
still and begun to grind for want of a lubricant. In Armand's
house, when he was absent, she ruled supreme. Fleurette never
dreamed of disobeying, and Armand's only peremptory orders to
Louise were never to mention politics or current events to the
child.</p>

<p>Louise had nursed Fleurette at her breast when Fleurette's
mother died in child-bed, and she had left her own baby in the care
of her sister, already a widow and childless. Considerations of
money had prompted her at the time, for Monsieur Armand, as he was
then, had made her liberal offers: afterwards, it was too late to
regret. Her own daughter, Adèle, born of an unknown father who
loved and rode away, had been brought up to a life of drudgery by
her aunt, who sent the girl out to earn her own living as soon as
she could toddle, whilst Fleurette was brought up to have
everything she wanted; petted and idolized by a father plentifully
supplied with money. Fleurette and Adèle were foster-sisters, but
with destinies as wide apart as the peaks of Pelvoux.</p>

<p>But Louise never spoke one bitter word when she saw Adèle with
toil-worn hands scrubbing the kitchen floor on which Fleurette
trod with dainty, high-heeled shoes. Perhaps she loved her
foster-child more than she did her own; perhaps it was only the
same considerations of money that had already guided her conduct
before, that prompted her later to indulgence towards the rich
mans' daughter, whilst reserving her pent-up acrimony for the
household drudge. No one knew what Louise's feelings were toward
Adèle&mdash;Adèle herself least of all. The girl was silent,
reserved, self-contained, very conscientious in her work, but not
very responsive to the many kindnesses shown her by M'sieu' Armand
or Mam'zelle Fleurette. She still lived with her aunt who had
brought her up, and she appeared to lay no claim to her mother's
affection: she had earned her own living ever since she was ten
years of age, and now, at eighteen, she looked more like a woman
than a girl: her little face was all pinched up, the lips thin, the
eyes either sharp as needles or expressionless like those of a
rodent. She hardly ever spoke and no one had ever seen her
smile.</p>

<p>Old Louise's mutterings presently turned toward Adèle's
prolonged absence:</p>

<p>"What is the girl about now, I should like to know? She is not a
gossip as a rule."</p>

<p>She went on with her washing up for a moment or two longer, and
then said sharply:</p>

<p>"Run along, Fleurette, and see what the wench is doing. Lazy
baggage, with all the work there's still to do."</p>

<p>Fleurette ran out at once. She too wondered why Adèle was such a
long time. And there, sure enough, standing on the bridge, was
Adèle talking to the soldiers. The officer was already out of
sight. Adèle talking! and Fleurette even thought that she heard her
giggle. Incredible! The soldiers were all laughing, and one of them
was in the act of drinking the last drop out of the tin mug.</p>

<p>Fleurette stood for a moment on the doorstep, vaguely wondering
what in the world had come over Adèle, when a rather curious
incident occurred: the soldiers were all laughing, jesting
apparently with the girl, and one of them, with head tilted back,
was draining the last drop out of the tin mug. Fleurette was on the
point of calling to Adèle when her attention was arrested by the
appearance of an old man carrying what looked like a load of
faggots tied up in coarse sacking. He seemed to have climbed the
slopes on the opposite side of the road; at any rate there he was,
all of a sudden, immediately behind the group of soldiers.</p>

<p>He appeared to be drunk, for he staggered as he walked and
leaned heavily on a stout gnarled stick. Fleurette could not have
told you exactly how it all happened, but all of a sudden Adèle's
giggling and the soldiers' jests were interrupted by the old
faggot-carrier tumbling down clumsily, right between them all.</p>

<p>Adèle screamed. The soldiers swore, and one of them went to the
length of giving the old man a savage kick, whilst two others
incontinently picked him up between them and flung him over the
parapet of the bridge. Fleurette gave a cry of dismay and ran to
the poor man's assistance. She felt hot with indignation at such
wanton brutality. How right, she thought as she ran, had old
Louise's estimate been of these soldiers&mdash;little better than
brigands they were, and cruel to boot. The poor faggot-carrier, for
such he seemed to be, was lying half in and half out of the stream:
the grass and sloping ground had somewhat broken his fall, but
nevertheless there he lay, motionless and groaning piteously.
Fleurette called peremptorily to Adèle to come and help her hoist
up the poor man on his legs again. He was very dirty, dressed in
nothing but rags, his feet swathed in coarse bass matting; he was
stockingless, shirtless and hatless; but he appeared to be
powerfully built and Fleurette marvelled how he could have allowed
himself to be thus maltreated without a struggle. No doubt he was
drunk or crippled with rheumatism.</p>

<p>Up on the bridge the soldiers were preparing to start once more
on their way. They took no more notice of their unfortunate victim
nor of Adèle; but Fleurette looking up felt that their last glance
was for her; some of them were regarding her with a leer, others
with more pronounced malevolence. She distinctly saw one man nudge
his neighbour and point a finger at her: whereat both of them gave
a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>She felt hurt and indignant: in her sheltered life she had never
met with malevolence before. However, for the moment, her first
care was for the poor faggot-carrier. Adèle had come to her
assistance, and together the two girls succeeded in getting the old
man on his legs again. He appeared more scared than hurt, and with
his big, toil-stained hands, he felt himself all over to see,
perhaps, if any bones were broken; and all the while he kept on
murmuring rather pathetically: "<i>Nom de nom, de nom de Dieu!</i>"
as if surprised that such a tragic adventure should have happened
to him.</p>

<p>Fleurette asked him if he were hurt, and he replied: "No,
Mam'zelle...that is citizeness," and he added: "Ah, I shall never
get used to these new ways. I am too old."</p>

<p>"Can you get on your way now?" Fleurette asked.</p>

<p>"Yes! yes, Mam'zelle, that is citizeness. But," he went on
piteously, "I am so hungry. I come from over Mison way and I have
not had a bite since seven o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>This naturally stirred Fleurette's kind, compassionate heart.
She told Adèle to run into the house and ask Louise for a hunk of
bread. Adèle, silent and self-contained once more, obeyed without
comment. The incident was closed as far as Fleurette was concerned.
Her thoughts flew back to Amédé and to his last day and evening
which he would be spending in his cozy home. She wished she had
been bold enough to ask him to come and bid her a last adieu
tomorrow morning before he went away to fight the English.</p>

<p>And while she stood there gazing out over the valley where the
metal cross on the church steeple of Laragne glistened like gold in
the sunlight, a strange voice&mdash;soft yet firm&mdash;suddenly
struck her ear from somewhere close behind her.</p>

<p>"Papers and valuables are behind the panel in Madame's
room."</p>

<p>She swung round terrified, so terrified that the cry she was
about to utter died away in her throat. She looked about her,
scared, shivering with that nameless dread which assails every
mortal in face of the supernatural. And yet everything seemed as
peaceful as before: the little mill stream splashed and gurgled
with its soft, persistent sound; in the old walnut tree a thrush
was calling to its mate and the old faggot-carrier was busy tying
up his faggots into the sacking again. Fleurette's eyes rested for
an instant anxiously upon him. She expected to see him raise his
head, to look about him, to appear scared as she was herself; but
he gave no sign of having heard anything of that mysterious voice,
fresh and compelling like a command from heaven. Oh no! Fleurette
could not have screamed. She was too panic-stricken just at first
to utter a sound. And yet nothing had really happened to alarm the
most timorous. Only those few words spoken by an unseen tongue.
What did they mean? What could they mean? They were simple and
commonplace enough: Fleurette repeated them to herself
mechanically:</p>

<p>"Papers and valuables are behind the panel in Madame's
room."</p>

<p>What did it mean? What papers? what valuables? and why should
the mysterious speaker have wished her to know that they were
behind the panel in Madame's room? Madame was, of course, Madame de
Frontenacs over at the château, and all of a sudden Fleurette
remembered that the mounted soldier had asked her the way to the
château. Gradually she was feeling less scared. Less scared but
more excited. She looked round at the statue of St. Antoine, at
whose feet she had this morning placed a fresh bunch of
forget-me-nots. Somehow she associated the mysterious voice with
St. Antoine. Perhaps Madame had lost some valuable papers, and the
kind saint had chosen this means of letting her know where her
treasure was. Fleurette made the sign of the cross on her bosom;
she remembered the story of Jeanne d'Arc which M. le Curé had used
to tell her, of how the humble shepherdess of Domrémy had been
compelled by heavenly voices to go forth and deliver France from
her enemies and never rest until she had seen the King crowned in
his cathedral of Rheims.</p>

<p>Fleurette felt something of that same fervour which had animated
Jeanne d'Arc. She felt that she must go forth and tell Madame about
the valuables and the papers. The evening was warm and she would
not need her shawl. She could go just as she was as far as the
château and be back before the twilight had faded into night. Adèle
in the meanwhile appeared at the front door, she had her shawl over
her head, and a hunk of bread in her hand. Then only did Fleurette
remember the old faggot-carrier. She turned in order to bid him
"Godspeed." He stood there quite motionless, leaning upon his
stick, bending under the weight of his load of faggots which he had
hoisted upon his back. His lank hair hung over his wrinkled
forehead and half concealed his eyes. But suddenly through the veil
of lank grey hair Fleurette met the mans' glance fixed upon her;
and her heart gave a queer jump. Those were not the eyes of a
decrepit old man; they were young and clear and bright: of a
luminous grey-blue, with heavy lids that could not wholly conceal
the humorous twinkle in the eyes, nor yet the kindly, searching
glance which was fixed on Fleurette.</p>

<p>This was the moment when she really would have screamed. The
sense of something ununderstandable and unreal was more than she
could bear, she would have screamed, but those twinkly, searching
eyes held her, and at the same time seemed to reassure her, to tell
her not to be afraid. She felt as if she were in a dream: unable to
do anything, only to stare and stare at the old faggot-carrier,
while gradually all her terrors seemed to fall away from her, and
she was filled with a sense of courage and of determination. The
whole incident, the voice, the glance, her terror and reassurance
had lasted less than five seconds. Already Adèle was close by. She
was bringing the bread for the poor, half-starved man, and
Fleurette now watched him, fascinated, as he took the bread with a
humble: "Merci, Mam'zelle," and started at once on it, like a man
who has not tasted food all day. He was just a decrepit old man,
bent with rheumatism, dirty, unkempt, insecure on his tottering
limbs. He even raised his eyes once, and once more looked at her;
but the glance was dim like that of an old man; there was no
twinkle in the eyes, only the weariness of poverty and old age.</p>

<p>And Fleurette felt that she had dreamed it all: the voice, the
glance, the message from St. Antoine, just as her terrors had faded
from her, so now her excitement vanished too. It must all have been
a dream. It <i>was</i> a dream! Perhaps old Louise, who was versed
in all kinds of dreamlore, would know of an explanation for the
whole mysterious occurrence. Feeling very tired all of a
sudden&mdash;for she felt the reaction after the tenseness of the
last few moments, she went back into the house. In the doorway she
turned to have a last look at the old faggot-carrier; leaning
heavily on his stick, he was making his way along the bank of the
stream. The last she saw of him was his big bundle done up in
sacking and his legs bending beneath the weight.</p>

<p>Adèle wrapped in her shawl had gone the other way. She was
already up on the bridge. With a little sigh of disappointment
Fleurette went into the house. It had been such an exciting
dream!</p>

<p>But she did not speak about it to old Louise; she just went
quietly about the house, doing one or two little bits of work that
Adèle had left undone.</p>

<p>The slowly sinking sun had turned the gold on Pelvoux's snowy
crest to a brilliant rose, when Fleurette suddenly announced to
Louise that she was going over to the château. She often went
there, and at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>"So long as you are home before dark," was Louise's only remark.
"I don't like those down-at-heel soldiers being about."</p>

<p>Fleurette promised that she would not be late. She picked up her
beautiful new shawl and wrapped it around her shoulders. The
château was not far; over by the mountain track, it was not more
than a quarter of a league at most. Swiftly Fleurette ran out of
the house and then along the edge of the stream&mdash;the same way
that the old faggot-carrier had gone an hour so ago.</p>

<p>And now the mantle of twilight was falling over the valley; the
jade-coloured sky held myriads of tiny, fleecy clouds of a
brilliant, glowing crimson, which one by one faded into grey along
the snow of Pelvoux reflected the glory of the sinking sun, and in
the old walnut-tree the thrush's song was stilled.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>The place was always called le château for want of a more
appropriate name. As a matter of fact it was just a large, rumbling
roomy farmhouse with stables and stable-yards and sheds and
outbuildings, all built in a mass and at different times as
necessity demanded, in the midst of a really fine park, shady with
century old trees and fragrant with accacias and roses. Here for
many generations the de Frontenacs, father and son, had lived,
toiled, and died, farming their land, honouring their King and
otherwise not troubling their heads over much with politics or with
art or literature. They were good, kindly, honest folk, all of
them, and if the light of their intellect burned somewhat dim, that
of their charity was always kept fed and bright.</p>

<p>They belonged to that sturdy stock which had given France one of
her most valiant sons in Louis de Frontenac, the man who had made
Eastern Canada a jewel worthy of the crown of France. The jewel had
been lost since then, irretrievably lost to the English, and the
crown of France been dragged in the mire of a bloody revolution,
its glory forever overshadowed by the unforgivable crime of a
purposeless regicide: but the present holder of the ancient name
and owner of the lands had kept himself aloof from the awful
dissension that raged in the big cities; he had remained in his
heart loyal to his martyred King, and though shorn of most of his
wealth, deprived of a great deal of his inheritance, perpetually
threatened with confiscation or attainder, he continued to lead the
simple life, hoping for better things, detached as far as he was
able from the turmoil that was ruining his country and shaming her
in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>At all seasons of the year, and in all weathers, he could be
seen out on his farm, directing the work in fields or stables, clad
in rough boots and breeches, abrupt of speech, but kindly in deeds,
beloved by some, envied by others, hated only by those few who see
in every noble life a reproach to their own.</p>

<p>His wife was the daughter of an Admirable in the late King's
navy, who had thought it prudent to serve the Republic, as he had
served his King, with commendable detachment from his country's
politics. Though brought up in the midst of the gaieties and
luxuries of Paris, Anne de Grandville had been quite content to
follow the husband of her choice to the lonely house in the
Dauphiné, and to fall in with his bucolic ways: she donned a cotton
kirtle and linen apron as readily as she had donned silken panniers
in the past, and took as much pride in her cooking now as she had
done once in her proficiency in the dance.</p>

<p>At one time Charles de Frontenac had sorely grieved because he
had no son to whom he could bequeath his glorious name and fine
inheritance, but now he was glad. With France handed over to the
control of assassins, bandits, and regicides, the name of Frontenac
might, he opined, just as well die out. What was the use of toiling
to improve land which tomorrow might be wrested from its rightful
owners: what was the use of saving money which would probably on
the morrow fall into the hands of brigands? "Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on this earth where rust and moth doth corrupt
and where thieves break through and steal!" had never been so wise
an admonition as it was today. All that Charles de Frontenac hoped
to do was to put by a sufficient competence to keep his wife and
invalid daughter in comfort once he was under the ground. That
daughter was the apple of his eye. Bereft of position and most of
his wealth, all his thoughts and hopes were centered on this
delicate being who seemed like the one ray of sunshine amidst
thunder-clouds of disappointment and treachery.</p>

<p>Rose de Frontenac had been a cripple from birth, and it was her
delicacy and her helplessness that had so endeared her to her
father. He was a man resplendent with vigor and of herculean
strength: one of those bull-necked men who could have taken his
place in an ox-team and not proved a weakling. His hands were
rough, his fist as hard as a hammer. His clothes smelt of damp
earth and of manure; the descendent of a long line of aristocrats,
Charles de Frontenac, was above all a son of the soil. To him his
pale-faced, fragile daughter seemed like a being from another
world; he hardly dared touch her cheek with his thick, clumsy
fingers, nor dared he approach her save after copious ablutions and
sprays of scent. His heart was as big as his body. He adored his
daughter, he loved his wife, he beamed with fondness for Fleurette:
Fleurette who was as gay as a linnet, who could always bring a
smile to the pale lips of his wan, white Rose: Fleurette, who could
sing like a lark, prattle like a young sparrow and whose corn-
coloured hair smelt of wild thyme and of youth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Fleurette had walked very fast. She was still tremendously
excited and would have ran all the way, only that the road for the
most part led sharply uphill and that her heart was beating and
pumping wildly with agitation.</p>

<p>Strangely enough the gates of the park were wide open, which was
very unusual, as they were always kept closed for fear of the
foot-pads and vagabonds. Old Pierre, who was in charge of the gate,
was nowhere to be seen. Fleurette ran along the sanded avenue
which, bordered by bosquets of acacia and elder, led in sharp
curves up to the house. Twilight was slowly fading into evening,
but even through the gathering darkness Fleurette noticed that the
avenue, usually so beautifully raked and tidy, was all trampled and
knocked about as if by the weight of many heavy feet. A minute
later the main block of the château stood out before her, like a
solid mass silhouetted against a jade-coloured sky. Just above the
pointed roof of the turret at the furthest angle above the façade,
a star shone with a cold, silvery radiance.</p>

<p>The entrance into the main building was under a broad archway
which intersected the façade and led into the great farmyard and to
the sheds and farm buildings. Fleurette felt vaguely conscious that
something unusual had occurred at the château; though the place
looked peaceful enough, it appeared strangely deserted at this
hour, when usually men and maids were still about their work. She
slipped quickly under the archway, and turning sharply to the left,
she came to the great paved hall where servants and farm hands sat
at meals.</p>

<p>She found the place in a strange state of confusion: the
men&mdash;they were all old men these days, as all the young ones
had had to go and join the army and fight the English&mdash;the men
were standing about in groups, talking and gesticulating with their
arms, after the manner of the people of Dauphiné, who are glib of
speech and free with their gestures; the maids were gathered
together in the dark corner of the room, holding their aprons to
their eyes. The oil lamp which hung from the whitewashed ceiling
had not yet been lit: only one or two tallow-candles on the table
guttered in their pewter scones.</p>

<p>Old Mathieu, who was the acknowledged father of the staff and
who was affectionately called Papa by the maids, was the first to
spy Fleurette, who stood disconcerted in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mam'zelle Fleurette! Mam'zelle Fleurette!" he exclaimed and
lifted his hands and cast up his eyes with an expression of woe:
"Quel malheur! Mon Dieu, quel malheur!"</p>

<p>He had on his bottle-green coat, his buckled shoes, and the
white cotton gloves which he wore when he served the family at
meals upstairs. They had just finished dinner, it seems, when the
awful calamity occurred.</p>

<p>"But what is it, papa?" Fleurette asked, feeling quite ready to
cry in sympathy. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"The soldiers, Mam'zelle!" Papa replied, and a fresh groan went
the round of men and women alike, and one or two of the girls
sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>Now as far as Fleurette was concerned, as recently as this very
morning, the inner meaning of these words "the soldiers!" would not
perhaps have had much significance. In her own little home, by
Bibi's strict orders, politics and social questions were never
discussed. Fleurette was not supposed to know anything of the
conflicts that were raging in the great cities, in the name of
liberty and of fraternity. The horrors of summary arrests, of
perquisitions, of sentences without trial, of wholesale executions,
of hatred and revenge and lust were supposed to be beyond her ken;
and knowing Bibi's abhorrence of those subjects being broached, she
kept her counsels and her knowledge to herself. But Fleurette was
not brainless, and she had a large heart. With her brain she had
noted many things which were willfully kept away from her, and her
kind heart had often been filled with pity at many of the tales
which she had heard in the village, tales of suffering under this
new kind of tyranny wielded, it seems, in the name of liberty and
of the brotherhood of man. She had heard many things and had
forgotten nothing; but somehow until this morning these things had
seemed remote, like the tales of ogres and demons which are told to
frighten children. She had not disbelieved them, but vaguely she
felt that nothing of the sort could possibly happen to people whom
she knew and loved.</p>

<p>But since this morning many things had occurred which had
widened her range of vision. Amédé, who did not want to go away,
was being dragged from his home in order to be made into a soldier
and to fight the English. She had actually seen some of those
soldiers, ragged, uncouth and unkempt, with their officer, like a
great bully, speaking to her, as if she were a mere slut out of the
streets. He had jeered when she told him that she was Citizen
Armand's daughter, and the soldiers had nudged one another and
seemed to mock her when she met their glance. Then again she had
heard the mysterious voice and seen something in the person of a
decrepit old faggot-carrier that had thrilled and puzzled her. All
these things had worked a subtle change in Fleurette. The tales of
ogres and demons no longer appeared quite so remote. The fact that
there were evil and sorrow in the world had in a vague kind of way
been brought home to her, and also that the spectre of death and
misery of which she had only heard was actually lurking in this
peaceful corner of Dauphiné and had already knocked at this very
door.</p>

<p>"The soldiers!" meant something to her now.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she asked, and a dozen tongues were ready to
embark on the telling of the tragic event. It was just after
dinner. Madame and Mademoiselle had retired to the boudoir, as
usual, and monsieur was sipping his wine in the dining room, when
the great bell at the gate clanged loudly. Pierre, who was still at
work in the stables, ran to open the gate: he was almost knocked
down by two men on horseback who, without a word or question, rode
past him along the avenue up to the house followed by a dozen men
or more in tattered uniforms and wearing dirty red caps on their
heads. The sound of horses and of men stamping the ground brought
some of the maids and farmhands out into the yard. The soldiers had
come to a halt under the archway, the two riders then dismounted
and ordered André to take their horses round to the stables. André,
of course, did not dare disobey. Then, as the entrance door was
closed, one of the soldiers knocked loudly against it with the
butt-end of his musket, whilst one of those who had been on
horseback and who appeared to be in authority called out
summarily:</p>

<p>"Open in the name of the Republic!"</p>

<p>Old Mathieu, who was upstairs clearing away the dinner things,
terribly scared, ran down to open the door. Again without a word or
question, the soldiers pushed past him until they came to the
vestibule where they demanded to know where were the
<i>ci-devant</i> Frontenacs. Old Mathieu here paused in his
narrative and once more threw up his hands and cast up his eyes in
horror.</p>

<p>"Ci-devant, mam'zelle!" he exclaimed. "I ask you! Just as
those devils up in Paris talked of our poor martyred King and
Queen!"</p>

<p>Of course he tried to stop the brigands from going up to see
Madame like that, in their dusty shoes and dirty clothes. But what
could he do alone among so many? Ah! if only Baptiste and Jean,
Achille and Henri had been there, as in the good old days, fine
sturdy fellows of the Dauphiné: they would soon have got the better
of these down-at-heel bandits, and if it was a case of protecting
Madame and Mademoiselle, why! there would have been some broken
heads, and the soldiers of the Republic would have sung another
song than they were singing now, the muckworms! But there! Henri
and André and the lot of the young ones had all been taken for
cannon-fodder, to fight against the English, and there were only a
few fogies left now like he&mdash;Mathieu&mdash;and the women.</p>

<p>Anyway, poor old papa was helpless. All he could do was to
precede those hell-hounds upstairs, so that he might at least warn
Monsieur of what was coming. But even this they would not let him
do; as soon as he had reached the upstairs landing, the same man
who had ordered him to open the front door in the name of the
Republic, and who wore a tricolour sash around his middle, this
same man grabbed him by the shoulder and thrust him aside as if he
were a bundle of faggots. And without more ado, he just walked into
the dining room where Monsieur was still quietly sipping his last
glass of wine.</p>

<p>From seeing Monsieur sitting there, the beautiful long-stemmed
wine glass in his hand, his face quite serene, you would have
thought that he had heard nothing of the turmoil on the stairs. But
he had heard everything, the tramping of feet, the rough voices,
the curt command to open in the name of the Republic. He knew what
was coming. Perhaps he had expected it long ago. It was well to be
prepared for anything these days. Anyway, there he sat, glass in
hand, his elbow resting on the table, where Mathieu had but a few
minutes ago been engaged in clearing away the dessert. At the rude
entry made by all those ragamuffins into his beautifully ordered
dining room, he just turned his head and looked at the men.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Republic," the man with the sash said
curtly.</p>

<p>Monsieur put his glass down and rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"The rest of the family, first of all," the man with the sash
replied. "I want you all here together."</p>

<p>"Madame de Frontenac and my daughter Rose are not at home," said
Monsieur, still speaking very quietly.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," the other retorted. "They were at meal here with
you."</p>

<p>And with careless finger he pointed to the serviettes and plates
which still littered the table. Monsieur did not wince under the
insult; nor was the saying of such a brigand an insult to so
high-minded a gentleman as Monsieur. All he said was:</p>

<p>"That is so. Madame and Mlle. de Frontenac were at dinner with
me, until half an hour ago when they left the house together."</p>

<p>"Whither did they go?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know."</p>

<p>"Which is another lie."</p>

<p>"If I did know," Monsieur rejoined imperturbably, "I would not
tell you."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see about that," the man with the sash said grimly.
He then turned to the soldier who appeared to be in command over
the others: "Allons! citizen lieutenant," he said curtly, "the rest
is your business. The two women have got to be found. That's the
first thing, after that we shall see."</p>

<p>The officer then ordered two of his men to stand on guard over
Monsieur, and since then the tramp, tramp of the soldiers' feet had
resounded throughout the château. Upstairs they went, and
downstairs; in Madame's room and in Mademoiselle's, in the kitchen,
the stables, the offices. They interrogated the men, they bullied
the women; they turned everything topsy-turvy; they raked about in
the hay and the straw of the stables, they scoured the park, they
glued their ugly, dirty noses to the sanded paths, trying to find
the imprint of footsteps. But neither of Madame or Mademoiselle had
they yet found a trace. They were still at it, raking and scouring
and searching. In the intervals they tried to browbeat Monsieur,
threatening him with summary shooting one moment, which only made
him laugh and shrug his shoulders, and promising immunity for his
women-folk if he would say where they could be found. But these
promises only made Monsieur laugh and again shrug his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Immunity?" he said. "They have that already, thank God! for
they are beyond your reach now. If they were not, do you think I
would trust to your promises?"</p>

<p>Old Mathieu paused. The story had neared its end:&mdash;this
tale of woe and anxiety and horror, such as the worthy old man had
never thought to see. The others had not much to say; the maids
were still crying, with excitement rather than grief, and the old
men stared open-mouthed, or sagely nodded their heads. "Then,"
Fleurette put in at last, "Madame and Mademoiselle have gone.
Really&mdash;really gone?"</p>

<p>Mathieu nodded with another sigh, half of perplexity, half of
woe.</p>

<p>"But whither?" Fleurette insisted. "How? Why?"</p>

<p>"God alone knows, Mam'zelle," papa averred. "He has spirited
Madame and Mademoiselle away to save them from these brigands."</p>

<p>"Did anybody see them go?"</p>

<p>Men and maids shook their heads. No one had seen Madame or
Mademoiselle go. Old Mathieu was the last to have seen the ladies.
He had just begun to clear the table, when they rose, and, as was
their custom, went through to the boudoir. Mathieu had opened the
door for them. And now he came to think of it, the ladies had each
kissed Monsieur very tenderly before they went out of the room.
Yes! the kiss had seemed like a farewell. Mathieu shook his head
dolefully: he remembered it now, but hadn't thought anything about
it at the moment. Monsieur certainly appeared more thoughtful.
Usually, while he drank his last glass of wine and Mathieu was
engaged in washing the silver in the large copper bowl which he
always brought into the room for that purpose, Monsieur would chat
with him, talk over the gossip of the day. But tonight he had been
unusually silent. Yes! Mathieu now remembered quite distinctly
about the kiss, and about Monsieur being so silent. But he
certainly had noticed nothing else unusual, until the moment when
those brigands banged at the door and demanded admittance in the
name of their godless Republic.</p>

<p>Mathieu was on the stairs at that moment, so he did not know how
Monsieur had looked when he heard all the tramping and the noise.
But Madame and Mademoiselle were gone, of that there could be no
doubt. The brigands had searched for them, like so many dogs
digging for a bone, and not a trace was there of the two ladies,
for the <i>bon Dieu</i>, no doubt, had made them invisible.</p>

<p>Of old Mathieu and the staff, the officer in command took no
notice, after he had summarily ordered them to muster up in the
hall; he had counted up the indoor servants and the farmhands;
those who had their homes outside the precincts of the château, he
ordered roughly out of the place.</p>

<p>"Get back to your homes!" he had said to them, after he had
inspected and questioned them; "and stay there quietly, if you
value your lives."</p>

<p>So there were only half a dozen old men, the four girls and the
staff's cook left in the château. All of them were scared, and as
Mam'zelle Fleurette could see, they just stood about and talked and
talked while the girls did nothing but cry.
He&mdash;Mathieu&mdash;could do nothing with any of them. The work
of the house ought to be carried on; none of them had had any
supper yet. But there! young and old, they were, all of them, too
much upset to work or to eat; and the tramp-tramp, upstairs and
downstairs was nerve-shattering to everybody.</p>

<p>Fleurette listened to the amazing story until the end. As
Mathieu said, there was the ceaseless tramping of feet still going
on. They&mdash;those horrible soldiers of the Republic, unworthy to
be called Frenchmen&mdash;were still searching for Madame and
Mademoiselle in order to drag them to Orange where the awful
guillotine had been at work these months past; or perhaps even to
Paris&mdash;that den of horrors beside which the stories of demons
and ogres were but trivial tales.</p>

<p>Madame and Mademoiselle! who never in their lives had done harm
to anyone: but rather spent every hour of the day planning and
executing kind deeds! And Mademoiselle! so delicate and frail that
even her father, who idolized her, hardly dared touch her. And now
these men, these rough and uncouth soldiers, with their harsh
voices and bullying ways, to think of their approaching
Mademoiselle, pushing her, dragging her, it made Fleurette's blood
boil even to think of such a possibility. No wonder that the <i>bon
Dieu</i> made them invisible to the eyes of all those bandits.</p>

<p>Tramp! tramp! tramp! and now a loud banging as if pieces of
furniture, chairs, tables were being overturned, and then a crash,
as of broken china!</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" Papa Mathieu exclaimed with a loud groan; "to
think of Madame's beautiful things! Those brigands are furious at
not finding Madame and Mademoiselle, and are venting their wrath on
inanimate things."</p>

<p>It was these words of old Mathieu that sent Fleurette's thoughts
flying in another direction&mdash;back to the early afternoon of
this memorable day&mdash;back to the first visit of these awful
soldiers, and to the faggot-carrier with his bundle tied up in
sacking. From thence to the voice! The mysterious voice that had
told her where valuables and papers were to be found. It was such a
flash of recollection that her whole face became transfigured;
anxiety and superstitious awe gave place to that same fervour which
had animated her when she met the eyes of the faggot-carrier: eyes
that conveyed a message, which at last she was beginning to
understand.</p>

<p>"Papa!" she cried impulsively.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mam'zelle?" Mathieu asked with another sigh.</p>

<p>"Did anything else happen&mdash;I mean anything
unusual?&mdash;did Madame&mdash;or Monsieur&mdash;receive a letter?
a message? or&mdash;or did any other stranger come to the château
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, think, Papa Mathieu, think," she implored with tears of
agitation choking her voice. "I cannot tell you how important it
is. Try to remember&mdash;was there
anything?&mdash;anybody?&mdash;"</p>

<p>Papa persistently shook his head, until Pierre, who was the gate
keeper, reminded him that Monsieur had gone down the avenue as far
as the gate, just ten minutes before dinner was served.</p>

<p>"There's nothing very unusual in that," Mathieu retorted.
"Monsieur is often out just before dinner is served."</p>

<p>"Yes!" Pierre insisted. "But what did he do this evening? He
walked straight to the gate, which I had closed half an hour
before. I saw him. He walked straight to the gate, he did, and you
know the old acacia tree just the other side? Well! Monsieur put
his foot on a bar of the gate and reached over to the forked branch
of the old tree. I saw him quite plainly, I tell you. And when he
walked back to the house he had a piece of paper in his hand with
some writing on it, which he was reading. And I think, papa,"
Pierre concluded triumphantly, "you'll have to admit that there was
something unusual in that."</p>

<p>But Mathieu, with the obstinacy of old age and long service,
would not admit it, even now.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said, "met the mail-carrier at the gate, he often
comes at this hour. He gave Monsieur a letter. Monsieur often gets
letters&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here André interposed. Old André&mdash;they were all of them
old&mdash;worked in the stables, and it was he who had taken the
two horses from the soldiers when ordered to do so, and walked them
around to the stables. It was then that he noticed two beggars
hanging about in the yard: a man and a woman. He had peremptorily
ordered them off the premises.</p>

<p>"Beggars!" Fleurette exclaimed eagerly. "What were they
like?"</p>

<p>André said that as the sun was in his eyes he couldn't see them
very well. There was a man and a woman. He was busy with the horses
and upset by the arrival of all these brigands. The woman he
couldn't see at all because of the shawl which covered her head,
but he recollected that the man was a big fellow, bent nearly
double under a huge bundle tied up in sacking.</p>

<p>"When I spoke to him," André went on, "he mumbled something or
other, but I just told him to clear out, he and his woman; we'd
enough of vagabonds, I said, in the place with all these
soldiers."</p>

<p>"And did he go?" Fleurette asked.</p>

<p>"Yes! I must admit he went off quite quietly after that. I did
not think he meant any evil, because when he first caught sight of
me he did not attempt to hide or to run away."</p>

<p>"If he had," André went on after a moment or two, "I would have
been after him pretty quickly, and wanted to know what was in that
big bundle."</p>

<p>He paused, a look of perplexity and of shamefacedness came over
his wrinkled old face while he thoughtfully scratched his head:
"Now I think of it," he said, "I ought to have inspected that
bundle. It looked mighty heavy for faggots or for rags. Perhaps he
had been up to no good after all&mdash;and directly after I lost
sight of him and his woman I saw a whole lot of faggots lying in a
heap close by the stable door."</p>

<p>The other old men and the maids had gathered closer round André
and Fleurette. His was the first they had heard of the old vagabond
and his woman, and the bundle which appeared so heavy.</p>

<p>"You certainly ought to have inspected that bundle, André,"
Mathieu said sententiously. He felt that there was a chance of
recapturing his dignity which seemed to have been slightly impaired
through his argument with Pierre. He could reassert his authority
at any rate by rebuking André. "It looks," he went on, "as if the
old vagabond had brought a lot of faggots with him, then turned
them out of the sacking and replaced them by God knows what
valuables he may have stolen."</p>

<p>"I was so upset, you understand, papa!" André murmured
ruefully.</p>

<p>"We were all of us upset, as you call it, André," papa rebuked
sternly, "but that is no excuse for neglect of duty."</p>

<p>"Don't scold André, papa," Fleurette broke in excitedly. "My
belief is that the old vagabond, as you call him, was a messenger
from the Holy Virgin, sent on purpose to get Madame and
Mademoiselle safely out of the way."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mam'zelle!"</p>

<p>"From the Holy Virgin!"</p>

<p>"Sainte Marie, mère de Dieu, priez pour nous!" came in chorus
from the maids. Even the cook, an elderly woman, jealous of her own
dignity, was unable to conceal her excitement. The old men shook
their heads, looked wise and skeptical.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that, Mam'zelle Fleurette?" Mathieu asked in
an awed whisper.</p>

<p>But Fleurette was silent now. Already she had repented of having
said so much. Discretion would have been so much wiser. That was
the worst of her: she always allowed her tongue to run away with
her. She looked eagerly from one anxious face to the other: well
she knew that the little she had said would be talked over and
commented on and be made the subject of gossip until it reached the
village and possibly even Serres and Sisteron; and God only knew
what harm this might do to Madame and Mademoiselle. She bit the tip
of her tongue hard just to punish it for having wagged too freely,
and seized with a sudden impulse, which she found irresistible, she
snatched up a candle from the table and incontinently turned and
fled out of the hall, leaving the others to gape and stare after
her, to scratch their heads, and to conjecture.</p>

<p>Aye! and to gossip, too.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Perquisitions in those days of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality
were perhaps among the minor horrors that befell innocent and
guilty alike, at the behest of tyrants more implacable than the
Inquisitors of Mediaeval Spain, more cruel than the Borgias: but
they were terrible nonetheless. A perquisition meant, in most
cases, the destruction of every household treasure, every family
relic cherished through the generations, it meant the wanton
smashing of furniture and mirrors, the ripping up of valuable
tapestries and of mattresses, the defacement of priceless pictures,
it meant prying, hostile eyes thrust into receptacles, however
secret, into private papers and even letters. Nothing was sacred to
men deputed to insult and to offend, just as much as to search.</p>

<p>When Fleurette reached that part of the house which was occupied
by the family, she was confronted by the wildest, the most
heart-stirring confusion. The carpets had been torn off the floors,
the furniture for the most part lay in broken heaps about the room,
mirrors and pictures had been dragged off the walls, broken
crockery and glass were scattered everywhere, intermingled with
horsehair and other stuffing out of chairs and mattresses, whilst
all the walls, the doors, the window-frames bore traces of rude
handling with bayonet or the heel of a boot. Fleurette, wide-eyed
and appalled, ran from room to room; the fluttering tallow-candle
which she held threw flickering lights and grotesque shadows on the
scattered objects about her, made them seem more weird, like the
appurtenances of an abode of ghosts. Here in the pretty boudoir
Mademoiselle's embroidery frame lay smashed to tinder wood with
threads of the work still hanging to it, bits of rags, pathetic in
their look of abandonment and desolation. There in the withdrawing
room, the beautiful satin-wood spinet with its painted panels and
exquisite marqueterie was lying on its side, its body gaping like a
gigantic wound, the strings emitting a final vibration like the
last song of a dying swan.</p>

<p>From the direction of the dining room came the incessant murmur
of voices, but throughout the rest of the apartments, in the midst
of all the wreckage, a silence reigned as of the grave. The place
now was completely deserted. It seemed almost as if some terrible
tornado had swept through these living-rooms; some implacable
forces of nature rather than the hatred and cupidity of men. An
earthquake could not have been more devastating, a fire more
destructive.</p>

<p>And now in the midst of it all Fleurette came to a standstill,
candle in hand: her breath came and went in quick short gasps, and
her heart was beating furiously. The silence in this semi-darkness
with those long, ghost-like shadows seemed to oppress her; the
broken bits of beautiful things which she had known and loved ever
since she remembered anything, gave her an awful feeling of
desolation and a kind of foreboding of things, still worse, to
come. It was instinct which had brought her to a halt here in this
one room amongst the others. It was always known as Madame's room,
for here Madame would always sit when she gave her orders to
various members of the household, here that she would look through
the household accounts whilst Fleurette and Rose, when they were
still children, would sit in a corner of the sofa by the huge
hearth, hand in hand, with a picture book on their knees, silent
like a pair of tiny white mice, waiting until Madame had finished
her business, because then they would all go into the garden to gather
flowers for the rooms, and fruit for desert, or perhaps go down
into the kitchen and learn how to dress a chicken for the table, or
how best to mix a salad.</p>

<p>And Fleurette stood for a moment or two quite still, holding the
candle high above her head, contemplating this wreckage. Then,
having found a safe place in which to deposit the candle, she
carefully closed the door which gave, like several others, on a
long corridor that led to the main staircase at one end and to the
service stairs at the other. The time had come to cease
contemplation, to drive away superstitious fears and to act.
Closing her eyes, Fleurette strove first of all to recapture
pictures of long ago, to recreate the scenes enacted in this room,
before this awful calamity had fallen on these people whom she
loved so dearly. Memory was not rebellious. She could see the whole
picture just as it had impressed itself on the tablets of her mind
when she used to sit here as a child. There by the window Madame's
desk used to stand. It was lying on its side now, the drawers
wrenched open, the handles broken, papers, pen and sand scattered
about; the ink had run out and stained the beautiful old Aubusson
carpet. But there Madame used to sit. Fleurette could almost see
her now, at the desk. Her big household books were open before her.
Writing, calculating, and putting her money by in a leather bag.
And presently she would rise, pick up her bag and books and carry
them across the room to a spot close to the wall, the other side of
the hearth. Here she would come to a standstill, and putting her
beautiful hand somewhere against the wall, she would turn to the
girls&mdash;they were mere children then&mdash;and smile at them in
a mysterious way; and they would say solemnly "Open Sesame!" just
as they had heard in the tale of Ali Baba and the forty robbers,
which Monsieur de Frontenac had often told them. As soon as they
had said the magic words the wall would open like the entrance of
the robbers' cave in the tale of Ali Baba, disclosing a recess into
which Madame would put her books and her bag of money. Then she
would once more turn and give a sign to the children and they would
say: "Close Sesame!" and the mysterious door would swing to again
and no trace be left of the recess which lay hidden somewhere
behind the panelled wall.</p>

<p>The whole picture stood out before Fleurette's mental vision in
every detail; the exact spot where Madame used to stand, the way
she put out her hand and touched the panelled wall. Carefully
picking her way through the maze of broken furniture, Fleurette
came to a halt on the very spot where she had so often seen Madame
standing, with her books and money-bag in her arms. She put out her
hand and touched the panel as Madame had done: all over the carved
panels she put her hand, touching and pressing each bit of carving
in its turn. Her heart was still beating wildly, but not in any way
with fear. In fact she was surprised at herself for not being
afraid. It was just the excitement of this wonderful adventure!
She, Fleurette, who had seen nothing of the world beyond her own
village of Laragne and an occasional glimpse at Sisteron, suddenly
found herself guiding the destinies of people whom she
loved&mdash;the messenger sent by the <i>bon Dieu</i> to help them
in their need. There is no young human creature living who would
not respond, heart and soul, to such a call, and Fleurette was of
the South, a child of that romantic land of Dauphiné which had
given so many of her heroic sons to strive and work for France.</p>

<p>And suddenly, as Fleurette pressed her finger on every piece of
carved relief, one by one, she felt the centre of a dog-rose yield
to the pressure. Softly, noiselessly, the panel swung outwards, and
there in the recess were the familiar household books and the
money-bag. Beside them lay a leather wallet and a small casket
fitted with a brass lock. Without any hesitation Fleurette took the
bag, the wallet and the casket, leaving the books where they were.
Never for a moment did the thought occur to her that she might be
discovered in what would be a highly compromising position. She was
too simple-minded, too innately honest to think that she might be
suspected of theft.</p>

<p>Having stowed the wallet and the bag in the wide pockets of her
kirtle and hidden the casket beneath her shawl, Fleurette picked
her way back across the room. She left the mysterious recess open
because she did not know how to close it, and did not want to waste
any time trying to find out. She found her way to the door and
opened it, then she blew out the candle and finally peeped out into
the corridor.</p>

<p>It was deserted. The lingering evening light, pale and
ghostlike, came creeping in through the row of tall arched windows
facing her. As everywhere else in the château, the corridor bore
the melancholy traces of the soldiers' passage. It was the same
devastation. The same wanton destruction was only too apparent in
the torn carpet and the fragments of glass and broken sconces that
littered the floor. Fleurette, turning her back on the direction of
the main staircase, made her way to the back stairs which wound in
a close spiral down to the service door.</p>

<p>Fleurette descended with quick, furtive steps, until, past the
first curve of the spiral, the stairs were in total darkness. But
she would have found her way all about the château blindfold, so
well did she know its every nook and cranny. She came to the door
and fumbled for the bolts. She had drawn one and taken off the
chain, when she heard a measured tramp on the other side of the
door. Steps were coming this way along the flagged path; a moment
or two later they came to a halt close to the door. Fleurette
hardly daring to breathe, listened. A voice said: "Did you go in
there?"</p>

<p>"No, citizen," replied another, "not by this door. The bolts are
fastened on the inside."</p>

<p>Something else was said which Fleurette did not catch, and the
steps receded in the direction of the front of the house. She
waited a minute or two longer, breathless and motionless, until she
heard what she thought was the tramp of feet in the corridor above
her. The soldiers had apparently been ordered to come round again,
perhaps they would be coming down those stairs. To hesitate now
might prove fatal. Fumbling once more in the gloom, Fleurette found
the last bolt and drew it, and the next moment was out in the open.
The back door gave on the yard. On the right were the stables, and
facing the door, the riding school and one or two sheds; on the
left the kitchens and the servants' quarters. In this direction too
was the great archway and the main entrance into the house. Past
the archway was the park and the avenue leading to the big
gates.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection Fleurette decided to avoid these
main approaches: there was another way across the park, past the
stable gate. Hugging the casket closely under her shawl, Fleurette
set out in the direction of the stables. There was no one about and
she felt comparatively safe. Night was now rapidly drawing in, and
she fortunately had on a dark kirtle and dark worsted stockings.
The air was very still and the waning moon not yet risen in the
east. From far away came the sound of the bell of Laragne church.
It struck eight. Fleurette felt a pang of anxiety. She had promised
to be home before dark and Louise would be anxious and cross: and
there was still something she wanted to do before she went home.
Now she was past the stable door where, in a heap, just as old
André had said, there lay a pile of faggots. The sight of them gave
Fleurette a happy thrill. Was she not obeying the dictates of the
mysterious voice which had spoken to her through the medium of the
old faggot-carrier?</p>

<p>The next moment, a firm step resounded on the flagstones of the
stables, and a second later a man appeared under the lintel of the
door.</p>

<p>"Fleurette! what in God's name are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Smothering a startled cry, Fleurette turned and found herself
face to face with her father. He was standing at the stable door;
his hands were clasped behind his back, and he had a tricolour sash
round his waist. Now women, young girls, especially, those born and
bred in outlying country districts, are credited with being stupid,
silly in their fears, timorous like hens; and so no doubt would
Fleurette have been in ordinary circumstances. She may not have
been either clever or brave originally; she would perhaps have
behaved in a silly, timorous fashion but for this one fact, that
she knew something terrible was happening to the Frontenacs whom
she loved, and that she had been deputed by the <i>bon Dieu</i>, or
merely by a human friend, to do something important for them. In
order to do this she must keep her head; and trust any woman to
keep her head if one she loves is in peril.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Fleurette?" Bibi reiterated rather
sternly.</p>

<p>And Fleurette, with a well-simulated nervous little laugh,
retorted lightly:</p>

<p>"Why, Bibi chéri, I might retaliate! What are <i>you</i> doing
here? I thought you were on your way to Paris."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Fleurette?" Bibi said once more, and
Fleurette thought that his voice had never sounded so harsh
before.</p>

<p>"But, Bibi," Fleurette said simply, "I often come to see Madame
and Mademoiselle. And after you left this afternoon I felt so
lonely and sad, I thought I might seek Mademoiselle Rose for
company."</p>

<p>"And have you seen her?"</p>

<p>"No. They told me Madame and Mademoiselle had gone."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Papa Mathieu."</p>

<p>"What else did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"Only that there were soldiers come to the château, and that I'd
better go home again&mdash;and so I'm going."</p>

<p>"He didn't tell you anything else?"</p>

<p>"No," Fleurette replied innocently. "Was there anything else to
say?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;er&mdash;no," Bibi rejoined. "Of course not. But
Fleurette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bibi darling?"</p>

<p>"How often must I tell you that you must not talk of "Madame"
and "Mademoiselle"? There are no Madames and Mademoiselles now; we
are, all of us equally, citizens of France."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bibi," Fleurette rejoined demurely. "And I really, really
am very careful when strangers are about. It doesn't matter what I
say before you, does it, chéri Bibi?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Bibi muttered, seemingly without much conviction, and
Fleurette then went on quickly:</p>

<p>"I must run home now, chéri Bibi, or Louise will be getting
anxious. You are coming too, aren't you? Louise will get you such a
lovely supper and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my little one," Bibi said. "I can't. Not tonight. I must be
in Orange tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But Bibi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run along, child," Bibi broke in almost fiercely. "It's a dark
night, and there are always vagabonds about."</p>

<p>"Ah well then, good night, Bibi," Fleurette murmured meekly.</p>

<p>And suddenly Bibi put out his hand and grasped Fleurette by the
wrist.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to kiss me, Fleurette?" he asked with oh!
such a tone of sadness now in his voice.</p>

<p>It was a terrible moment. What a mercy that the darling had
seized her left wrist, rather than her right, because with her
right hand Fleurette was hugging the small casket under her shawl.
There were also the wallet and the moneybag in the pocket of her
kirtle: oh! if Bibi should knock against them! Fortunately it was
dark, and he could not see the bulge under her shawl. But, of
course, she could not part from Bibi chéri without giving him a
farewell kiss. He seemed sad and unhappy, and there was something
about his whole manner that Fleurette did not understand.</p>

<p>At first, when he startled her by suddenly appearing at the
stable door, she had not even tried to conjecture what he was doing
here; she was too deeply absorbed in her own adventure for the
moment to do more than vaguely wonder what part Bibi was playing in
the tragic events that had wrought such desolation at the château.
Bibi chéri, who worshipped his little Fleurette, who was always so
kind, so gentle, a slave to everyone of her whims; he must have
been dragged into this horrible affair, was perhaps an innocent
tool of those cruel people in Paris, who monopolized his time and
kept him away from his home.</p>

<p>Indeed she had no mistrust in him whatever; but her trust in him
did not go to the length of telling him about the casket, or the
mysterious voice of the faggot-carrier; those were her own secrets,
secrets too which concerned the Frontenacs for whom Bibi had never
evinced a very great affection, and had even tried to dissuade
Fleurette from having too much intercourse with them. It was in
fact her love for Madame and Monsieur, and for Mademoiselle Rose,
and Bibi's strange dislike of them, which had brought the only
clouds in the sunshine of their affection.</p>

<p>But of this Fleurette was not thinking at the moment, her one
thought was of her secret and how best to guard it. All the same
she would not have denied Bibi chéri the kiss he asked for. She
must take the risk, that was all, and once again trust to her wits.
She allowed him to put his arms round her neck and held up her
fresh young face for his kiss: she held the casket so carefully
that he did not feel its sharp angles. All was well, for now she
was free from his embrace, but still he had hold of her left hand,
and drew her close to him.</p>

<p>"Fleurette, my little one," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bibi."</p>

<p>"Do you know where the two Frontenac women have gone to?"</p>

<p>"No, Bibi, I do not," Fleurette was able to reply in all
truthfulness, and looked her father straight in the eyes. "They
were gone before I came."</p>

<p>"It is for their good that I ask you."</p>

<p>"I am sure it is, Bibi, but really, really I do not know."</p>

<p>Bibi gave a quick, impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"Ah, well! goodbye, my Fleurette."</p>

<p>"Good night, Bibi."</p>

<p>At last she was free. With her left hand she blew a last kiss to
Bibi, and then quickly sped across the yard. Her heart felt heavy
and there was an uncomfortable lump in her throat. For the first
time she had been brought face to face with the realities of life.
Hitherto she had lived in a kind of fairyland in which she was the
carefully tended and guarded queen, and Bibi the acknowledged king
as well as slave.</p>

<p>Everything in the world was perfect, and lovely, and wonderful;
the men and women in it&mdash;not only Bibi, but Louise, and M.
Duflos the butcher, and M. Colombe the grocer, and&mdash;and M.
Amédé&mdash;they were all kind and generous and gentle. But now
cruelty and spite had come within her ken. An ugly ghoul called
"hatred" had passed by hand in hand with his ugly brother
"mistrust" and the latter had whispered something in her ear just
now, which had caused her to shrink within herself when Bibi had
kissed her, and to turn from him and to run away with a strange
sense of relief.</p>

<p>She did not look back as she sped across the yard, and when she
came to the small postern gate she was thankful to find it on the
latch, so that she could slip out unseen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>Fleurette was too young, too ignorant for self-analysis. She
could not have told you what had made her act in the way she did,
nor what had caused her so to mistrust Bibi as not to share her
precious secret with him. All she knew was that she had had a wild
desire to get away from him.</p>

<p>A cart-track led from the postern gate across a couple of fields
where it joined the main road; one or two isolated farm buildings
belonging to M. de Frontenac, and the open fields on both sides,
made the track fairly safe from foot-pads. The main road too which
led through the village would be safer after dark, than the short
cut over the mountains. Fleurette hastened along, hugging her
treasures, hoping that she would not fall in with the soldiers on
their return from the château.</p>

<p>The weather had not fulfilled the promise made by the beauty of
the sunset: heavy clouds hung over the sky; only one or two streaks
of pale lemon-coloured light, like great gashes through the leaden
clouds, still lingered in the West. Through the gloom farm-sheds
and isolated trees loomed out like great immobile giants, and, on
the right, the dense mass of the avenue of acacias and elder and
the great gates of the château.</p>

<p>Fleurette was already well on her way along the high-road and in
sight of the first house of the village, the cottage where Adèle
lived with her aunt, the widow Tronchet, when she heard the all too
familiar sound behind her of the heavy tramping of feet and of
horses' hoofs raising the dust of the road. The night was so still
that the sounds reached her ears distinctly. She heard the
lieutenant's harsh voice giving a brief word of command: the
creaking of the château gates, as they swung upon their hinges.
Just then Roy, Monsieur's dog, set up a dismal howl, and from one
of the tall poplar-trees that bordered the road an owl gave a hoot
and fluttered out into the night.</p>

<p>Fleurette broke out into a run. She knew that she could ask for
shelter in the widow Tronchet's cottage and wait there until the
soldiers had gone by. Perhaps Adèle would walk home with her after
that. Fortunately she could already perceive the light glimmering
in one of the tiny windows, and just at the moment Adèle came out
of the front door, probably to see for herself what the unusual
sounds were about.</p>

<p>She was mightily surprised to see Fleurette come running
along.</p>

<p>"They are the same soldiers, Adèle," Fleurette explained
breathlessly, as she followed her foster-sister into the cottage,
"who were at Lou Mas this afternoon. Close the door, do, and I'll
tell you all about them."</p>

<p>The widow Tronchet came out of her kitchen, and looked
disapprovingly at Fleurette. She did not like the girl, and
discouraged all intercourse between her and Adèle. She was a
thrifty, hard-featured, hard-hearted peasant&mdash;older than her
sister Louise by a couple of years&mdash;who had exacted every
ounce of work and obedience from Adèle in payment for the shelter
of her roof and for her daily bread. She had never forgiven her
sister for leaving Adèle on her hands, though the girl had always
worked her fingers to the bone, grudgingly no doubt, but
diligently, in order to bring additional comfort into the cottage.
But it was a poor, ill-furnished cottage, wherein food was none too
plentiful, and beds hard, whereas Louise at Lou Mas lived in the
lap of luxury; and envy had fostered dislike until it had almost
become hatred.</p>

<p>She listened, with a frown on her hard wrinkled face, to
Fleurette's breathless tale of what had happened at the château. It
would be the gossip of the village by to-morrow, that the soldiers
of the Republic had arrested Monsieur, and that Madame and
Mademoiselle had fled no one knew whither.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ma'ame Tronchet," Fleurette concluded, her fresh voice
hoarse with sobs, "dear Ma'ame Tronchet, you don't think they're
really going to harm Monsieur, do you?"</p>

<p>The widow Tronchet shrugged her shoulders and gave a short,
harsh laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking about it at all one way or the other," she
said drily. "What difference does it make to us poor people," she
went on, grumbling, while she busied herself about the room, "what
happens to all those aristos? They never cared what happened to
us."</p>

<p>For the moment Fleurette could do no more than stare at the
widow Tronchet, in horror. Never had she heard anyone say anything
so wicked. She was quite ready to defend Monsieur and Madame
against any accusation of hard-heartedness, and would have done so
at risk of offending the disagreeable, ill-natured old woman, but
for the moment her attention, as well as that of Adèle's, was
riveted on the sounds outside. The soldiers had just come round the
bend of the road; they were quite close to the cottage already,
with the two horsemen walking their mounts in the van.</p>

<p>"They are going on to Serres," Fleurette whispered. In her heart
she was wondering what Bibi was going to do. He was evidently not
going to Orange, as he had said he would. Would he spend the night
at Lou Mas after all? If he did, was there any danger of
Fleurette's secret leaking out? Of Bibi chéri finding out something
about the casket and the precious wallet? Fleurette was still
hugging the casket, she could see the widow Tronchet's hard, steely
eyes, gazing curiously at the bulge underneath her shawl, and then
at the fullness in her kirtle where the wallet and the money-bag
lay hidden in the pockets: Fleurette felt the blood rush up to her
cheeks, and then had the mortification of seeing Adèle's pinched-up
little face break into a smile. Of what were those two women
thinking? Surely not that she, Fleurette, had been stealing. Their
faces were so inscrutable: the older woman's hard and set, and
Adèle's rat-like and furtive, as if determined to conceal her
thoughts.</p>

<p>The next moment they all heard the horsemen go by. Adèle ran to
the door and peered out into the night. Over her shoulder she said
to Fleurette:</p>

<p>"There's your father riding with the soldiers. Shall I shout to
him and tell him you are here?"</p>

<p>Instinctively Fleurette shook her head, and with that same
inscrutable smile still on her face, Adèle deliberately closed the
door again.</p>

<p>"They've got Monsieur walking between them," she commented
drily.</p>

<p>"It would have been better," the widow said acidly to Fleurette,
"for Citizen Armand to know that you are here. It won't be safe for
women to be alone on the high-road this night, I am thinking."</p>

<p>Then, as Fleurette remained silent, debating within herself what
she had best do, the old woman went on curtly: "The sooner you get
home now, my girl, the better. Adèle has got to put in an hour's
work at Citizen Colombe's up at the village: it is miserable pay
enough," she continued muttering to herself, "and a shame that one
girl should have to work so hard, whilst another lives a pampered
life of luxury. But anyway," she concluded abruptly, "I can't be
wasting any lamp-oil on you."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;of course not, Ma'ame Tronchet," Fleurette
stammered. But the widow, still muttering under her breath, was
paying no more attention to her. She had climbed on to a chair, and
reaching up to the lamp that hung from the ceiling, she turned out
the light. The room was now in darkness except for the light that
came in through the open kitchen door. The widow with a curt:
"Don't be late, Adèle," went off into the kitchen, and a moment or
two later could be heard busy with her pots and pans.</p>

<p>Adèle had picked up her shawl, and equally unceremoniously gone
as far as the door, when Fleurette called her shyly back.</p>

<p>"Adèle!"</p>

<p>The girl turned without speaking, her hand on the door which she
was holding open.</p>

<p>"If you are going to M'sieur Colombe, could you&mdash;"
Fleurette stammered, "I mean, would you tell Monsieur Amédé,
that&mdash;that I am here, and perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you come along with me?" Adèle retorted drily, "and
tell him what you want."</p>

<p>Of course Fleurette could not tell her that she did not want
Monsieur and Madame Colombe to know that she had something
important to say to M'sieu' Amédé. So all she said was: "Oh! Adèle,
please!"</p>

<p>Adèle retorted with a shrug of the shoulders and an ugly little
sneer:</p>

<p>"You don't want his papa and mama to know, I suppose."</p>

<p>Fleurette whispered: "No!"</p>

<p>"Very well!" was all that Adèle said in reply. "I'll tell
him."</p>

<p>And in her usual, furtive, noiseless way she went out of the
house, closing the door behind her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>Fleurette remained in darkness, silent, motionless as a little
mouse, listening for the well-known footstep which in a few
minutes, she knew, would be at the door. It had perhaps been a rash
thing thus to give herself away to Adèle, but the girl was
uncommunicative and had never been known to gossip. Between two
risks Fleurette had chosen the lesser one. If Bibi&mdash;as she
feared&mdash;was going back to Lou Mas, there would be no chance
whatever of keeping the secret of Madame's casket and valuables
from him, and what Bibi's attitude would be towards them, Fleurette
could not guess. It was the great Unknown. For Madame's sake and
Mademoiselle's she would not risk it.</p>

<p>Like an inspiration the thought of M'sieur Amédé had occurred to
her; of Amédé who, when she was a little girl and he a growing lad,
would always take the blame on himself and know how to shield her
when they had got into mischief together. She felt now, especially
since this afternoon, that she could trust Amédé in a way that she
had never trusted anyone else. Not even Bibi. Unfortunately Adèle
had to be made a part confidant of the purpose: but after all what
did Adèle know? She couldn't know anything about the casket and
Madame's valuables: and if she did sneer, or even talk to her aunt
about this message sent to M'sieu' Amédé through her, well!
Fleurette was prepared to face the gossip&mdash;as long as her
secret was safe.</p>

<p>She was counting the minutes&mdash;the seconds&mdash;Five
minutes for Adèle to go to the Rue Haute: three and a half for
Amédé to run along here&mdash;she did not doubt that he would run.
Then there would be the intervening time whilst Adèle sought for an
opportunity to speak to him alone. But oh! how Time dragged on
leaden-footed! Nearly fifteen minutes must have gone by since Adèle
went away. The widow Tronchet was still busy in the kitchen,
rattling her pots and pans: but any moment she might finish and
perhaps come in here and find Fleurette still waiting. Then there
would be more acrimonious remarks, questions, arguments&mdash;Had
Fleurette known anything about nerves, she would have said that
hers were irritated to snapping-point; but there was little talk of
nerves in that year, 1794, and none in this remote corner of
Dauphiné.</p>

<p>Fleurette found it very difficult even to sit still. Would Amédé
never come! All sorts of possibilities occurred to her, bringing
her to the point of screaming with impatience. Perhaps he was from
home, or working in the shop under his father's eye. Perhaps the
soldiers had called at the épicerie and taken him away, and
Fleurette would never see him again&mdash;Oh! if only time would
stand still until Amédé came!</p>

<p>Then at last, when she was on the point of bursting into tears
with disappointment, she heard the quick, familiar step. Amédé!!!
As noiselessly as possible she opened the door and slipped out.
There, sure enough, was Amédé coming along. Though it was very dark
now, Fleurette knew it was he because of the sound of his
footsteps. Hearing hers, he came to a halt, and she ran up to him,
breathless with excitement. All at once the enormity of what she
had done struck terror in her heart. She, Fleurette, whose
reputation had stood hitherto above all gossip, who for three years
in succession had been crowned Queen of the month of May, an honour
only accorded to girls of spotless character, she had actually
given an assignation to a young man&mdash;at night&mdash;far from
her home and his!</p>

<p>And with the horror of what she had done came an intense
shyness. What would M'seur Amédé himself think of her? Indeed, she
had to evoke all her fondness for Madame and all her fears for
Mademoiselle before she could summon enough courage to approach
him, and to place a timid little hand upon his arm. She felt it
trembling at her touch, and through the silence of the night came
an answering timid sigh and whisper:</p>

<p>"Mam'zelle Fleurette! What can I do in your service?"</p>

<p>His timidity gave her courage. Gently she led him to the edge of
the road where the tall poplar-trees cast long, impenetrable
shadows.</p>

<p>"M'sieur Amédé," Fleurette began, whispering low so that chance
eavesdroppers might not hear: "I don't know what you'll think of
me. I know I have done something which every one in the village
would call reprehensible. I sent for you in secret
because&mdash;because, M'sieur Amédé, there is no one in the world
I can trust, as I do trust you."</p>

<p>This time there came no sigh on the part of the young peasant,
only a quick intaking of the breath, as if he had suddenly been
dazzled by a wonderful light. His hard, rough hand crept up shyly
and fastened over the soft, quivering one that lay upon his sleeve
just like a frightened bird. But he was a man of few words, and
therefore said nothing: and Fleurette, encouraged by the pressure
of that rough hand, went on more glibly.</p>

<p>"It is about Monsieur, Madame and Mademoiselle," she said, "up
at the château. Soldiers have visited the place and they have
broken the furniture and torn the beautiful carpets and the
curtains: why, I know not. They have also called Monsieur, Madame
and Mademoiselle traitors and aristos, and they have seized
Monsieur and dragged him away from him home. By a miracle, M'sieur
Amédé, a miracle wrought by the <i>bon Dieu</i> himself, Madame and
Mademoiselle were able to escape out of the château before those
awful soldiers came. I know that they are safe, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Mam'zelle Fleurette?" Amédé asked also in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Because, M'sieur Amédé," she replied, "there is a mysterious
personage working for the safety of Madame and Mademoiselle, under
the direct guidance of the good God. I feel quite sure that
Monsieur will also presently be saved through him."</p>

<p>"A mysterious personage, Mam'zelle Fleurette?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a direct messenger from Heaven. He has come down to earth
in the guise of an old faggot-carrier. He looks old and decrepit
and toil-worn, but when he speaks his voice is like that of an
archangel, and if he looks at you his eyes give you the strength of
giants and celestial joy."</p>

<p>"But, Mam'zelle Fleurette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His voice spoke to me this afternoon, M'sieu' Amédé. All it
said to me was that papers and valuables were behind the panel in
Madame's room. At that time I knew nothing about the soldiers. I
had seen them but did not know that they were going to the château
to arrest Monsieur and Madame and Mademoiselle Rose. Nevertheless
when that voice spoke to me, I felt I must go over to the château
as quickly as may be."</p>

<p>"Why did you not send for me then, Mam'zelle Fleurette?"</p>

<p>"I seemed to be in a hurry, impelled to run along as fast as I
could. So I went by the mountain track. When I arrived at the
château, the soldiers had been there some time. They had turned the
place topsy-turvy, scared the servants and smashed and torn up
everything, leaving nothing but the walls intact. It seemed as if a
great tempest had swept by and wrecked everything. Monsieur was
under arrest and Madame and Mademoiselle had gone. No one knew
whither. Then suddenly I remembered that mysterious voice: I found
my way to Madame's room, and I found the panel, behind which Madame
used to hide her household books and her money. I had often watched
her doing this when I was a child. I tried to remember how to make
the panel work and the good God helped me. And behind the panel I
found Madame's papers and her money, and a small box which, I am
sure, has precious things in it, or it would not have been
there."</p>

<p>"Then what did you do, Mam'zelle Fleurette?" Amédé gasped under
his breath, his none too sharp wits slowly taking in the details of
the amazing adventure.</p>

<p>"I just took the wallet, M'sieu' Amédé," she replied simply,
"and the money-bag, and the box. And here they are."</p>

<p>She tapped the pockets of her kirtle and made him feel the bulge
underneath her shawl.</p>

<p>"Oh, mon Dieu!" he exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p>And then she told him about Bibi, and how frightened she was
lest when she returned to Lou Mas she should find him there. Bibi's
sympathies seemed to be all with the soldiers, she explained, and
he would for certain make her give up Madame's papers and valuables
to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"That is why," she concluded with a return to her first
timidity, "I wished to speak with you, dear M'sieu' Amédé."</p>

<p>"The Eternal Eve!" It was the first time Fleurette had used an
endearing word when speaking to Amédé. Born and bred in this remote
corner of Dauphiné, unsophisticated, untutored in the ways of
coquetry and cajolery, she knew nevertheless, true daughter of the
first mother that she was, that after this he would be mere wax in
her hands.</p>

<p>He was!</p>

<p>All that he wanted to know was what he could do for her. Had she
asked him to throw himself into the Buëche, he would have done it:
but all that she wanted was for him to put her treasures in a safe
place, until such time as Madame required them.</p>

<p>"If Bibi knew what I was doing, M'sieu' Amédé," she pleaded, "he
would order me to give up Madame's property. But I know that the
<i>bon Dieu</i> meant me to take charge of it, or why," she argued
naïvely, "should He have sent His messenger to me?"</p>

<p>Of course Amédé was only too ready to share the burden of this
wonderful secret with Fleurette.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to share anything with this loveliest being in
all the world; and the thought that she trusted him more even than
her father, was sending him wellnigh crazy with joy.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, Mam'zelle Fleurette," he said:
"There's an old tool-shed at the back of our house where all sorts
of rubbish are kept. It is an absolute litter now, and the back of
it has not been cleared or interfered with for years. But I know of
a convenient hole in the flooring, hidden well away in a corner.
I'll put these things there. They'll be quite safe&mdash;Mam'zelle
Fleurette, you'll know where to find them after I've gone away, if
you want them."</p>

<p>"After you've gone away?"</p>

<p>For the moment she had forgotten. Of course he was going! How
could she forget? He was going to join the army&mdash;to fight the
English&mdash;! Perhaps he was never coming back&mdash;oh! How
could she&mdash;how could she forget?</p>

<p>Amédé after the long speech which he had delivered in a
whisper&mdash;his longest speech on record&mdash;had remained
silent. The tone of anguish in Fleurette's voice, just now when he
recalled the fact that he was going away, had given him an immense
thrill of joy. Altogether poor Amédé felt so happy that he was
almost ashamed. The night was so beautifully still: the wind had
gone down, and slowly the great clouds that had obscured the sky
since sunset were rolling away over the valley. Already overhead a
patch of translucent indigo appeared, ever-widening, and revealing
one by one the scintillating worlds that are beyond man's ken.
Amédé did not want to speak; he wanted it less than he had ever
done before. He just wanted to stand there beside this exquisite
creature, wrapped in the silence of the night, feeling her
nearness, hearing the gentle murmur of her breath come and go
through her perfect mouth. She had extracted the casket from under
her shawl and given it to him to hold, and she also gave him the
wallet and the money-bag; and as she did this, her little hand, so
soft and so warm, came in contact with his now and then&mdash;quite
often&mdash;and poor Amédé was on the point of swooning with
delight.</p>

<p>"I do trust you, M'sieu' Amédé," she whispered in the end: "and
you'll do this for Madame's sake, will you not? and also for
Mademoiselle's. And also," she added softly, "for mine."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mam'zelle Fleurette," Amédé sighed. What he had wished to
say was: "I would die for you, beloved of my heart: at a word from
you I would lay down my life, or barter my soul." But Amédé had no
command of words, and was now cursing himself for being a clumsy
fool. He stowed away the wallet and the bag into the pockets of his
breeches, and tucked the casket underneath his blouse.</p>

<p>"And now I must go home, dear Monsieur Amédé," Fleurette said.
"As it is, I am afraid Bibi will be anxious."</p>

<p>Her hand was on his arm: and with a sudden impulse he stooped
and pressed his lips against that exquisite little hand.
Fortunately they were still standing in the shadows cast by the
poplar-trees, or Amédé must have seen the blush that rose to
Fleurette's cheeks when she felt the delicious thrill of that timid
kiss. A soft breeze stirred the branches above their heads, and
through the quivering leaves there came a sigh that was like an
echo of their own. And above the crests of Pelvoux the waning moon
suddenly rent the last clouds that veiled her mystery, and flooded
the snowy immensitites with a shower of gold. Slowly the shades of
night yielded to the magic, and the high-road glistened like a
silvery ribbon winding, snake-like, toward Laragne.</p>

<p>Fleurette gave a sudden start of alarm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mam'zelle Fleurette," Amédé asked.</p>

<p>"Some one," she said. "I saw some one move
there&mdash;furtively&mdash;among the shadows."</p>

<p>He turned to look. A small figure wrapped in a shawl had just
gone past on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>"It is only Adèle," he said carelessly. "She is going home."</p>

<p>Not altogether reassured, Fleurette peered into the shadows. She
did not think that it was Adèle whom she had seen, or, if it was
Adèle, there was some one else lurking in the shadows, she felt
sure: and though she was not altogether frightened, she felt
herself trembling, and her knees giving way under her. No doubt it
was in order to save herself from falling that she had leaned more
heavily against Amédé's arm. Certain it is that he put that arm
round her, only in order to support her; but the contact of that
warm, quivering young body against his breast sent the last shred
of his self-control flying away on the evening breeze.</p>

<p>The high-road was bathed in honey-coloured light, but these two
were standing in the deep shadow cast by the poplar-trees; and the
darkness wrapped them round as in a velvety, downy blanket. His arm
tightened round her shoulders, pressed her closer and closer to his
breast, held her there so closely that she could scarcely
breathe.</p>

<p>It was only in order to get her breath that she raised her face
to his; far be it from me to suggest that it was for any other
motive; but this proved the final undoing of poor M'sieu' Amédé;
for the next moment his lips were fastened hungrily on hers, and
her sweet young soul went out to him, in a first, a most delicious
kiss.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>It all seemed like a lovely dream after that: this walking
together arm in arm down the high-road with the waning moon
throwing great patches of silvery light to guide them on their
way.</p>

<p>They went through the village, not caring whom they met. They
belonged to each other now; that wonderful kiss was a bond between
them that only death could sever. That was how they felt;
supremely, marvellously happy, thrilled with his new delight, this
undreamed joy: and with it all a cloud of measureless sorrow at the
impending farewell. The magic words had been spoken: "You love me,
Fleurette?" The eternal question to which the only answer is a
sigh. No, they did not care whom they met. They could laugh at
gossip now: from this night they were tokened to one another, and
only M. le Curé's blessing could make their happiness more
complete.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact they met no one, for they avoided the main
street of the village and made their way to Lou Mas along narrow
by-paths that meandered through orchards of almond-trees heavy with
blossom. For the most part they were silent. Fleurette's little
hand rested on Amédé's arm. Now and then he gave that hand a quick,
excited squeeze and this relieved his feelings for the time being.
Under his other arm he hugged the casket, the precious treasure
that had been the mute but main spring of his happiness. It
represented Fleurette's trust in him: that priceless guerdon he
would not have bartered for a kingdom.</p>

<p>"You will not part with Madame's valuables, will you, Amédé?"
she had enjoined him most solemnly. "Not to anyone?"</p>

<p>"Never, Fleurette," he had replied solemnly. "On my soul!"</p>

<p>When they were within sight of Lou Mas, they decided that it
would be best for him to turn back. She, Fleurette, was quite safe
now, and of course old Louise would be waiting for her&mdash;and
perhaps Bibi. She was not going to make a secret of her walk home
with Amédé. Indeed she wished it proclaimed from the house-tops
that they were tokened to one another, and that they would be
married as soon as this horrible war was over. There was to be no
secret about it, and Fleurette knew well enough that neither Bibi
nor M'sieu' Colombe would object; but because of Madame's
valuables, she did not want Amédé to come to Lou Mas until
to-morrow. And so that first wonderful kiss found its successor in
another&mdash;one that was perhaps even more delicious, because it
was more poignant&mdash;the precursor of the last farewell.</p>

<p>Fleurette found Louise anxiously waiting for her. Bibi had not
returned and the old woman knew nothing, of course, of the tragic
events that had occurred at the château. Fleurette told her what
had happened, and while she was speaking Bibi came in. He looked
tired and anxious, but Fleurette thought it prudent not to appear
to notice anything unusual about him. He made no reference to the
events at Frontenac, and when nine o'clock came he kissed Fleurette
as tenderly, as unconcernedly as usual. Nine o'clock! What a
lifetime, as far as Fleurette was concerned, had been crowded into
this past hour!</p>

<p>She went to bed as in a dream, partly made up of sorrow and
partly of great joy: even the excitement of her adventure at the
château was lost in the immensity of that joy. Fleurette fell
asleep with her cheek against the hand on which Amédé had planted
that first timid kiss.</p>

<p>When she came down in the early morning Bibi had already
gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>The soldiers of the Republic together with their officer had
spent half the night at Laragne in the tavern kept by the Père
Gramme, drinking and jesting with the drabs of the village. Each
man had a tale to tell of his own prowess at the château, and how
but for him, the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac would have slipped
through the fingers of justice as readily as the two women had
gone.</p>

<p>They were very proud of their prisoner, who sat lonely and
silent in a corner of the low-raftered room, foul with the odour of
sour wine and perspiring humanity. Monsieur de Frontenac&mdash;the
<i>ci-devant</i> as he was curtly termed&mdash;was apparently
taking his misfortune calmly; neither threats nor vain promises
caused him to depart from his attitude of quiet philosophy. The
soldiers had, of course, made up their minds that he knew well
enough where his wife and daughter were in hiding, but they had
also realized by now that it was not in their power to force him to
divulge what he knew.</p>

<p>The lieutenant&mdash;a man who had begun life as a notary's
clerk, and therefore had some education&mdash;was content to shrug
his shoulders and to declare that the citizens of the nearest
Committee of Public Safety had plenty of means at their disposal
for making an obdurate prisoner speak. He recalled that at the
trial of the Widow Capet she had been forced into admissions which,
before that, she would sooner have died than make. Mocking glances,
jeers and insults were thereupon cast on the prisoner who remained
as unconcerned, as serene as before.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had commandeered billets for his men in the
better houses of the village, and just before midnight the party
broke up. The prisoner was then conducted to the small, local
<i>poste de gendarmerie</i> and there incarcerated in the cell
usually occupied by vagabonds and cattle-thieves. Two or three of
the soldiers remained at the <i>poste</i> to reinforce the local
<i>gendarmes</i>, in case some hot-heads in the village meditated a
coup to wrest the traitor Frontenac from the clutches of justice.
The lieutenant himself had selected the house of Citizen Colombe
the grocer of the Rue Haute for his night-quarters. To say that the
worthy <i>épicier</i> did not accord this representative of his
country's army a warm welcome, would be to put it mildly. He was
furious, and showed it as plainly as he dared; but there is in
every French peasant a sound vein of common sense, and he
knows&mdash;none better&mdash;when submission to the ruling powers
is not only the best policy, but at the same time the most
conducive to the preservation of his own dignity.</p>

<p>Ma'ame Colombe&mdash;or rather the citizeness&mdash;made the
lieutenant comfortable and that was all; but at the bottom of her
heart she felt that she must do unto him as she would wish her own
son to be done by presently, when he too was a soldier in that army
which she detested. She fell asleep thinking of Amédé tramping the
high-road as these men had done, stockingless, hatless, with
unwashed shirt and a dirty worsted cap on his head; and she dreamed
all night of him, deprived even of his weekly bath in the big tub,
over in the wash-house. That is what she objected to mostly in
these men: the dirt. It was wonderful, of course, their fighting
for their country, now that all the other countries in the world
were attacking France, but Ma'ame Colombe argued to herself that
patriotism might just as well be allied to cleanliness. Even the
lieutenant, who was after all an officer, and should be setting a
good example to his men, would have looked much more imposing if he
had washed his face and taken the dust of the road out of his
hair.</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was Ma'ame Colombe's astonishment the next
morning when she, along with several of her friends, being at the
market, saw another detachment of soldiers marching into Larange
from the direction of Sisteron. Only eight of them there were, with
one officer and a wagon drawn by two splendid horses; but <i>nom du
ciel</i>! what a different set of men and horses these were. The
men clean as new pins, magnificently dressed in blue coats with
white facings and belts, white breeches&mdash;all
spotless&mdash;and black gaiters that reached midway up their
thighs. Beneath their elegant <i>chapeau-bras</i>, each adorned
with a silk tricolour cockade, they wore their own hair, down to
their shoulders, unfettered by the old, ridiculous <i>queue</i>,
and each man had successfully cultivated a fierce and magnificent
moustache. Everything about them glistened with cleanliness, their
boots, their buckles, their muskets; as for the officer, never in
all their lives had the good ladies of Larange seen anyone so
magnificent: tall, blond, with a moustache that he could easily
have tucked behind his ears, and a little tuft of blond beard at
the tip of his chin, he walked with drawn sword at the head of his
squad, a superb tricolour sash further enhancing the glory of his
attire.</p>

<p>Potatoes and eggs and butter were forgotten, while market-women
and customers stood gaping, open mouthed. Never had such beautiful
specimens of manhood been seen in Larange. By the time they reached
the Rue Haute all the village had turned out to have a look at
them, and heads appeared at every cottage window. The village
urchins followed the little squad, intoning the "Marseillaise" and
giving vent to their excitement by performing miracles of acrobatic
evolutions. Even Ma'ame Colombe, who was at the moment selecting a
piece of meat for Sunday's dinner, could not help but say to
herself that she would not mind Amédé being in the army if he was
going to look like that!</p>

<p>At that very moment one of the urchins paused in the midst of a
magnificently sketched somersault in order to run down the street
and back to the market-place, shouting excitedly:</p>

<p>"Ma'ame Colombe! Ma'ame Colombe! the soldiers are at the
épicerie."</p>

<p>And so they were! Ma'ame Colombe hastily straightened her cap
and snatching up her market basket, ran to the corner of the Rue
Haute just in time to see the soldiers with their officer and wagon
come to a halt outside her front door. The worthy Hector with his
son Amédé, and the old man who helped in the shop, were busy taking
down the shutters and displaying the sacks of various kinds of
haricots and lentils in tempting array all along the shop front.
Ma'ame Colombe heard the magnificent officer give a quick order:
"Halte!" and "Attention!" and the next moment she saw him enter the
shop followed by his men, the wagon remaining drawn up a little
further down the street. The urchins and gaffers crowded round the
doorstep open-mouthed, and Ma'ame Colombe had some difficulty in
pushing her way through into her own house.</p>

<p>The officer began by asking Hector Colombe how many soldiers of
the Republic were still sleeping under his roof.</p>

<p>"Only the lieutenant and two men, M'sieu' l'officier," Hector
replied. Whereupon the officer broke in curtly:</p>

<p>"Call me citizen captain. This is the army of the Revolution and
its soldiers are not aristos meseems."</p>

<p>Which remark boded no good to Ma'ame Colombe's ears. Clean or
dirty they all appeared to be the same type of brigands;
overbearing, exacting and merciless! Ah that poor dear Amédé!</p>

<p>The officer then demanded to see the lieutenant and the two
soldiers. Amédé offered to call them, but was stopped by a brief
command from the captain:</p>

<p>"No, not you," he said curtly, "I want you here, the citizeness
can go."</p>

<p>Ma'ame Colombe, obedient and vaguely frightened, put down her
basket and went upstairs to fetch the lieutenant and the two men,
who were still in bed. But although she had only been gone a couple
of minutes, her sense of fear took on a more tangible form when she
came down again, for she found all the drawers of the counter open,
and much of their contents scattered about the floor. Some of the
soldiers were busy ferreting about, behind and under the counter.
The officer stood in the middle of the shop talking with Hector,
who looked both choleric and sullen; in the doorway, the crowd of
gaffers were being kept back by two of the soldiers, who were using
the butts of their muskets when some venturesome urchin tried to
cross the threshold. But what filled poor Ma'ame Colombe's heart
with dismay was the sight of Amédé sitting in the parlour behind
the shop, with two other soldiers obviously on guard over him.</p>

<p>Her instinct prompted her to run first of all to her husband
with a quick whispered: "Hector, what does this mean?"</p>

<p>But the magnificent officer brusquely thrust himself between her
and Hector and said gruffly: "It means, citizeness, that not only
treason, but also theft has been traced to this house, and that it
is lucky for you that news of it reached the Committee of Sisteron
in time, else," he added grimly, "it had been worse for you and
your family."</p>

<p>"Treason and theft?" Ma'ame Colombe exclaimed in hot
indignation. "You must take it from me, young man, citizen,
captain, or whatever you may be, that I'll allow no one
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, woman," the officer broke in curtly; "you do
yourself no good by these protests. Obedience is your wisest
course."</p>

<p>"Good or no good," Ma'ame Colombe persisted heatedly, "I won't
have the word theft used in connection with this house, and
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make your wife hold her tongue, citizen," the officer, now
addressing Hector once more, broke in curtly, "or I shall have to
send her to the <i>poste</i> for interfering with a soldier of the
Republic in the execution of his duty."</p>

<p>Poor Hector Colombe, whose choler was shrinking in inverse ratio
to that of his wife, did his best to pacify the worthy dame.</p>

<p>"It is all a mistake, Angélique," he said gently. "M'sieu' le
Capitaine&mdash;pardon! the citizen captain thinks that Amédé has
some papers and valuables belong to Madame&mdash;I mean, to the
Citizeness Frotenac&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are they calling my Amédé a thief, then?" Ma'ame Colombe
demanded hotly.</p>

<p>"No! No!" Hector replied, trying to be patient and conciliatory.
"Have I not told you that it is all a mistake? Every one knows
there are no thieves in this house; but it seems the authorities
think that Amédé may have hidden those valuables pour le bon
motif."</p>

<p>"If he had," the mother retorted obstinately, "he would say so.
Let me just ask him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hector had hold of her hand, but she wrenched it free, and
before any of the soldiers could bar the way, she had run into the
back parlour, shouting:</p>

<p>"Amédé, my little one, have you told those soldiers that you
know nothing of Madame's valuables? Why, nom de Dieu!" she went on,
hands on hips, defiant and aggressive like the true female
defending its young, "look at the innocent. Is that the face of a
thief?"</p>

<p>She pointed at Amédé, who, however, remained strangely
silent.</p>

<p>"Voyons, mon petit, tell them!" Angélique Colombe went on with
perhaps a shade less assurance than she had displayed at first. The
next moment, however, the captain had seized her unceremoniously by
the arm, and dragged her back into the front shop. Here he gave her
arm a good shake.</p>

<p>"Did I not order you to hold your tongue?" he demanded
roughly.</p>

<p>Cowed, in spite of herself, not so much by the officer's tone of
command as by Amédé's silence, Ma'ame Colombe did, in effect, hold
her tongue. A sense of disaster as well as of shame had suddenly
descended upon her. Her ample bosom heaving, she sank into a chair,
and threw her apron over her head. She was not crying, but she felt
the need of shutting out from her vision the picture of Amédé
looking so confused and sullen, of Hector looking as perplexed as
she was herself, as well as of that magnificent officer with his
fine clothes and his tricolour sash. But chiefly she wanted for the
moment to lose sight of that crowd of gaffers and urchins and
neighbours, all staring at her, with that unexplainable feeling,
not exactly of contentment for her misfortune, but which can only
be expressed by that untranslatable word <i>Schadenfreude</i>. Thus
shut out from the rest of her little world, the poor woman slowly
rocked herself backwards and forwards, murmuring inaudible words
under cover of her apron, until she heard the captain's voice
saying abruptly:</p>

<p>"Were you the officer in charge of detachment number
ninety-seven?"</p>

<p>Curiosity got the better of sorrow, and Ma'ame Colombe peeped
round the edge of her apron. The picture which she saw made her
drop her apron altogether. The lieutenant who, the night before,
had been so overbearing and so hilarious, stood before his superior
officer now, a humble, dejected figure, dreading reprimand, like a
schoolboy fearing the cane.</p>

<p>"I am in charge of the detachment ninety-seven&mdash;yes,
citizen captain," he replied haltingly.</p>

<p>What a contrast these two! Ma'ame Colombe, in spite of her
anxiety, her indignation and what not, could not help but compare.
Woman-like, she had an eye for the handsome male, and what more
gorgeous than this captain of the Republican, or revolutionary
army, as he apparently liked to style his men, with his braided
jacket and superb tricolour sash, with his blond hair and fierce
moustachios? He poked his tufted chin out at the bedraggled-looking
lieutenant before him, looked down with obvious contempt at the
latter's ragged coat and mud-stained breeches. But he made no
remark on the want of cleanliness and decency, as Ma'ame Colombe
expected him to do.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"From Orange, citizen captain."</p>

<p>"What is your objective?"</p>

<p>"After this, Serres, citizen captain, and then Valence."</p>

<p>"And your orders are to arrest on the way every person suspected
of treason against the Republic?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

<p>"And how have you obeyed these orders, citizen lieutenant?" the
captain demanded sternly.</p>

<p>"I have done my best, citizen captain," the other replied with
an attempt at bluster; "at Vaison&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not talking of Vaison, which you know quite well, citizen
lieutenant. I wish to know how you obeyed the orders given to you
to arrest the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac, his wife and
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Citizen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you done it, citizen lieutenant?" the officer thundered,
and all of the bluster went out of the subaltern as he stammered
meekly:</p>

<p>"When we reached the house of the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac,
the two women had gone."</p>

<p>"Gone?" and the captain's voice boomed through the low-raftered
room like a distant roll of cannon. "Gone? Whither?"</p>

<p>"Gone, citizen captain," the lieutenant murmured under his
breath: "spirited away. The devil alone knows how."</p>

<p>"Which means that there is a traitor among you."</p>

<p>"Citizen captain&mdash;" the other protested.</p>

<p>"A traitor I say. You had secret orders, and yet the women were
warned!" And once more the officer's glance flashed down with scorn
on his unfortunate subordinate. His blond hair seemed to bristle
with wrath; his moustachios stood out like spikes: he looked a
veritable god of vengeance and of wrath.</p>

<p>"Whence," he thundered, "is the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac?"</p>

<p>"At the commissariat, citizen captain, guarded by our men," the
lieutenant replied.</p>

<p>"And the rest of your detachment?"</p>

<p>"In billets in the village."</p>

<p>"And did you search this house when you entered it?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is&mdash;no&mdash;I did not&mdash;that is&mdash;"
stammered the wretched man.</p>

<p>"Or the other houses where you billeted your men?"</p>

<p>But this time the lieutenant only shook his head in dejected
silence.</p>

<p>"Which means that you allowed soldiers of the Republic to sleep
under strange roofs without ascertaining whether they were safe.
Why, citizen lieutenant, this place might have been swarming with
traitors."</p>

<p>"The people here, citizen, are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough. You are relieved of your command, and you will proceed
now with us to Sisteron where you will render an account of your
conduct before the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>Ma'ame Colombe, who had watched the two men closely during this
exciting colloquy, saw an ashen hue spread over the lieutenant's
face, beneath the thick coating of grime. Though they did not know
much in this tucked-away corner of Dauphiné, of what went on in the
great cities, they had vaguely heard how great officers of the army
had been deprived of their rank and sent to the guillotine for not
doing their duty by the army of the Republic. The crowd at the door
had also listened in silence; many a cheek turned pale at sound of
that thundering voice which held in its arrogant tone a menace of
death.</p>

<p>And now the captain turned to the other two down-at-heels
soldiers who stood skulking behind their lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Go," he commanded, "round the billets where your comrades are.
Bring them hither. And one of you to the commissariat, and bring
the ci-devant here too. And no delay, remember. No gossip on the
way as you value your lives. I give you five minutes to have all
the men and the prisoner here."</p>

<p>The men went immediately to execute the peremptory order, while
the lieutenant remained in the shop looking the picture of humility
and dejection. Ma'ame Colombe who had a kindly heart inside her
ample bosom, felt almost sorry for the man, so miserable did he
look. Indeed, it seemed as if this squad of elegantly clad soldiers
sowed anguish and terror in their path.</p>

<p>But the worst was yet to come. Ma'ame Colombe thought that she
had probed the last depths of humiliation when she heard that
gorgeous officer call her Amédé a thief. To such a pass had this
so-called revolution brought the respectable children of France,
that they saw themselves bullied and insulted, and held up to shame
before their neighbours. What was all that in comparison with the
shame of seeing Amédé confronted with the proof that in very truth
he was in possession of papers and valuables which were the
property of Madame de Frontenac?</p>

<p>It all happened so quickly. Poor Ma'ame Colombe could scarce
believe her eyes. All that she saw was two soldiers guided by their
sumptuous captain go straight through the back parlour and out by
the back door into the yard. What happened out there she did not
know, but a minute or two later the three men were standing once
more in the parlour, and the captain had in his hand a small box, a
thick leather wallet and a bag which obviously contained money.</p>

<p>At sight of these Amédé&mdash;her Amédé&mdash;had jumped to his
feet as if he had been stung; all the blood rushed to his face, and
made it crimson with choler, and it looked for the moment as if he
would hurl himself on the officer of the Republican
army&mdash;which would have meant instant death for him, as the
soldiers had already shouldered their muskets. Ma'ame Colombe gave
a terrified shriek, whereat Amédé suddenly seemed to realize his
position, the flush died out of his poor face, and with eyes
downcast he resumed his former silent, constrained attitude.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders and with a note of dry
sarcasm in his voice he said:</p>

<p>"I see you make no attempt at denial. You are wise, citizen. Try
and induce your mother not to shriek and you'll find that
everything will turn out for the best."</p>

<p>He did not say this unkindly, and poor Ma'ame Colombe even
thought that she detected an indulgent tone in his voice. She rose
to her feet and put her podgy hands together, and when the captain
re-entered the shop she looked up at him with tearful, entreating
eyes.</p>

<p>"He did it with a good motive, M'sieu' le&mdash;I mean citizen
captain. Look at the innocent. He is no thief. I swear he is no
thief. I'd like," she went on, turning fiercely round and darting
defiant glances on the crowd of gaffers on the doorstep, "I'd like
to see the man who dared to say that my Amédé is a thief."</p>

<p>The officer had handed the <i>pièces de conviction</i> to one of
his men, with orders to put them in the wagon. Then he commanded
Amédé to stand up before him.</p>

<p>"Thief or no thief," he said drily, "you are guilty of having
acted contrary to the interests of the Republic. You know what that
means?"</p>

<p>Amédé made no reply, only hung his head, and twiddled his hot
fingers together.</p>

<p>"It means," the officer continued, "that but for one thing, your
life would have had to answer for this act of treason."</p>

<p>A groan went round the crowd on whose ears those words had
fallen like the toll of a passing bell. But Ma'ame Colombe did not
utter a sound. She clung to her Hector and the two old people stood
there hand in hand, striving by this loving contact to conquer the
icy fear that had gripped their hearts.</p>

<p>"The one thing that will probably save you," the officer resumed
after a dramatic pause, "is that the Republic has need of you in
her revolutionary army. The enemy is at the gates of France, you
are young, healthy, vigorous; it is for you to show your mettle by
defending your country. Thus you will redeem the past. For the
moment it is my duty to take you before the Committee of Public
Safety, whose final word will dispose of your fate."</p>

<p>He spoke loudly so that all the listeners might hear. Gaffers
and urchins and market-women hardly dared to breathe. They felt
awed, and could only gaze at one another, as if trying to read each
other's thoughts. And while awed whispers still went the round, the
down-at-heels soldiers, who had spent the night in the village,
came skulking back in groups of two or threes. They pushed their
way through the crowd into the shop. One of the last to arrive was
M. de Frontenac, closely guarded by two of the men.</p>

<p>And there they all stood now in the shop, a dozen or so of them,
beside the sacks of haricots and button-onions and split peas; all
of them with the exception of the prisoner, looking dirty and
bedraggled, with their worsted caps covered in dust, bits of hay
and straw clinging to their coats and to their hair, bare-legged
and grimy-faced, the steel of their bayonets dull with sludge,
their breeches mud-stained. Such a contrast to the superb officer
and his splendidly attired squad. And they could hear the women
drawing humiliating comparisons, tittering and pointing fingers of
scorn at them, whilst even the drabs, with whom they had drunk and
jested the night before, turned contemptuous shoulders upon them
now.</p>

<p>And thus they were mustered before the magnificent captain; all
soldiers together, shoulder to shoulder, the down-at-heel and the
grandees&mdash;aristos one would have called them, only that they
were of the revolutionary army, which set out to exterminate the
very last of the aristocracy, the hated tyrants and dissolute
brood. And while they stood there, under the eye of the officer,
the crowd outside watched them, and instinctively something of the
spirit that animated the rest of France, swept like a poisonous
sirocco over these worthy villagers of Laragne; the same spirit
that in the great cities sent old women knitting and gossiping at
the foot of the guillotine and that prompted young girls to dip
their kerchiefs in the blood of its victims. A poisonous wind like
the breath of demons! Some of the men and women had been to
Sisteron and heard the hymn of hate, the <i>Carmagnole!</i></p>

<p class="poem">"Çaira! Çaira! Les aristos à la lanterne!"</p>

<p>One or two of them began to hum it, stamping their feet to its
rhythm.</p>

<p>Gradually the song swelled, one after another they took up the
tune, these village men and maids who, unbeknown even to themselves
had absorbed some of the insidious poison of hatred and black
envy.</p>

<p>"Right! Turn!" the captain commanded, and marking time with
their feet, the little squad now over twenty strong, started on its
way. Ma'ame Colombe, now loudly moaning, still clung to her boy. He
was very brave and tried to reassure and to comfort her. Anyway, he
would have had to go to-day, he argued, his orders were to report
himself at Serres, to be drafted into the army. From the officer's
attitude it certainly seemed as if nothing more terrifying was to
happen to him. The boy was brave enough too not to let his mother
know how doubly his heart ached, because he was saying good-bye to
his home, and could not say good-bye to Fleurette. His heart was
filled with the image of Fleurette, but he would not add to his
mother's sorrow by speaking to her of his own. He was just an
unsophisticated village lad, knowing little, understanding less.
His own life and comfort were nothing to him, beside the sorrow
which his mother felt and which, he knew, would bring such
countless tears in Fleurette's lovely blue eyes. The father too
tried to be brave; the effort to keep back his tears brought the
perspiration streaming down his round, kindly face. When the
crowd&mdash;his friends and neighbours some of them&mdash;intoned
the revolutionary song, his powerful fist was clenched, but he did
not shake it at the singers. His sound common sense had come again
to his rescue, and whispered to him that for Amédé's sake, quiet
submission was the soundest policy.</p>

<p>While mother and son clung to one another in a last farewell,
Hector contrived to approach M. de Frontenac who, alone in the
midst of such excitement and such conflicting emotions, had
remained perfectly calm. The casual observer, not knowing him,
might have thought that the fate of his wife and daughter, his
separation from them, and the blow that destiny had dealt to these
worthy folk here, whom he had known all his life, had left him
completely indifferent. He had spent the night in a prison cell,
under the eye of men&mdash;the local <i>gendarmes</i>&mdash;whose
welfare and whose families had been his care for years; but
seemingly he had slept peacefully. At any rate his face showed no
sign of fatigue, or his eyes of sleeplessness. He had dressed with
scrupulous care; his well-worn clothes, the ones he was wearing at
dinner when the soldiers made irruption into the château, were
clean and tidily put on; his cravat neatly tied, his hair smooth.
When Hector Colombe approached him, he gripped the worthy
<i>épicier</i> warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>And now the crowd parted to allow the soldiers to pass. Some of
the girls tried to ogle the handsome ones and to leer at the
others, but no one attempted to do more than stare in awe and
admiration at the magnificent officer. The two prisoners were
ordered to mount into the wagon; one of the soldiers took the reins
and the next moment the order, "Quick March!" was given.</p>

<p>The crowd broke into an excited "Hurrah!" and the little squad
slowly moved off, officer <i>en tête</i>, and the wagon in the
rear, in the direction of Sisteron. Then one of the villagers once
more struck up the <i>Carmagnole</i>, and the crowd took it up. "Ca
ira! Çaira!" they sang gaily, and the men took the girls by the
waist and twirled them round in a gay rigadoon. Old men and young
girls; for there were no young men in the villages of France these
days, when the army claimed them all, they danced and twirled in
the wake of the retreating squad, and around them bare-footed
urchins somersaulted along in the cloud of dust raised by the
horses and wagon.</p>

<p>And that was the picture that Amédé Colombe and Charles de
Frontenac, sitting side by side in the wagon, saw gradually
receding before their eyes as they were driven away, prisoners from
their homes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>But in Lou Mas nothing was known of the tragic events that were
occurring at Laragne. Old Louise and Fleurette were busy with
housework, and if Fleurette went about the house, silent and
wistful, it was because presently she would have to say the
inevitable farewell to Amédé.</p>

<p>It was Adèle who brought the news. Young Colombe had been
arrested by soldiers of the revolutionary army, she said, and he
and M'sieu' de Frontenac had been taken to Sisteron. A superior
officer of the army had come in this morning and relieved the
lieutenant of his command. There had been great excitement in
Laragne owing to the arrival of this new detachment of soldiers who
were as splendid as those of last night had been travel-stained and
bedraggled. The whole of the squad, headed by that magnificent
officer, had marched away in the direction of Sisteron, the two
prisoners sitting in the wagon in the rear.</p>

<p>It was only bit by bit that old Louise succeeded in dragging all
this news out of Adèle. The girl's habitual reticence was put to a
severe test by all the questions and cross-questions, whilst
Fleurette stood by wide-eyed, distraught with the idea of these
horrible complications in which her poor Amédé was being involved.
But she would not show any emotion before Adèle, she felt vaguely
that her foster-sister, never very expansive towards her, had
suddenly become almost inimical. So she waited until Louise had
extracted all the news she could out of the taciturn girl, and
curtly ordered her back into the kitchen; then as the old woman was
about to follow, Fleurette caught her by the hand.</p>

<p>"Louise," she said in a tone of almost desperate entreaty,
"dear, kind Louise, I must go to Sisteron&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"To Sisteron?" old Louise exclaimed, frowning. "Heavens alive,
what is the child thinking of now?"</p>

<p>"Of M'sieu' Amédé, dear Louise," Fleurette replied. "You heard
what Adèle said. They have taken him to Sisteron."</p>

<p>"And what of it?" Louise asked&mdash;but she asked for form's
sake only, she knew quite well what was going on in Fleurette's
head.</p>

<p>"Only this, dear Louise," the girl said with a little note of
defiance piercing through her shyness. "We&mdash;that is Amédé and
I&mdash;are tokened to one another."</p>

<p>"Tokened?" the old woman exclaimed with a gasp. "Since
when?"</p>

<p>"Since last night."</p>

<p>"And without your father's consent? Well! of all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chéri Bibi would approve," Fleurette asserted, "if he
knew."</p>

<p>Old Louise shrugged her shoulders. She would not trust herself
to speak because the child looked so sweet and so innocent, and her
pretty blue eyes were so full of tears, that Louise felt an almost
unconquerable desire to take hold of her and hug her to her breast.
Which act of weakness would have seriously impaired her authority
at this critical juncture. She was wondering what to say
next&mdash;for in truth she more than suspected that the child was
right, and that Citizen Armand would not object to those two young
things being tokened to one another, when Fleurette broke in
gently:</p>

<p>"So you see, dear, kind Louise, that I must go to
Sisteron&mdash;now&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"But Holy Virgin, what to do?"</p>

<p>"To see Amédé and comfort him."</p>

<p>"They won't let you see him, child."</p>

<p>"Then I will find chéri Bibi," Fleurette retorted calmly. "He
has a great deal more authority than you and I credit him with,
Louise. He can order whom he likes not only to let me see Amédé,
but even to set him free."</p>

<p>"He would be very angry," Louise argued, "to see you wandering
about the high-roads alone, while all those soldiers and riff-raff
are about."</p>

<p>Fleurette gave a quaint little smile.</p>

<p>"Bibi's anger against me never lasts very long," she said.
"Anyway, I will risk it. Louise dear, will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you said that Bibi would be angry if I roamed about
the high-roads alone."</p>

<p>Louise stood squarely in front of Fleurette, looked straight
into those blue eyes, which never before had held such a determined
glance. Fleurette could not help smiling at the old woman's look of
perplexity; she was the typical hen seeing her brood of ducklings
take their first plunge in the pond.</p>

<p>"If you won't come with me, Louise dear," the girl said simply,
"I shall have to go alone."</p>

<p>"Get along with ye, for an obstinate wench," Louise retorted
gruffly. But the next moment she had already changed her tone. "Get
on your thick woollen stockings, child," she said, "and your
buckled shoes, and your brown cloak, while I put a few things in a
basket for our dinner. If we don't hurry, we shan't be in Sisteron
before nightfall."</p>

<p>"M'sieu' Duflos will lend us his cart or a horse," Fleurette
rejoined gleefully, "but I won't be long, dear, kind Louise."</p>

<p>And swift as a young hare she ran out and then up the outside
staircase to her room under the overhanging climbing rose.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two women started on their way.
Fleurette had on her dark kirtle, her thick stockings and buckled
shoes; her fair hair was tucked away underneath her frilled
mob-cap. She carried her own cloak and Louise's on her arm, whilst
Louise tramped beside her, carrying a basket in which she had
hastily packed a piece of bread, some cheese, and two hard-boiled
eggs. If M'sieu' Duflos, the butcher, would lend them his cart,
they would be in Sisteron by mid-day; but in any case they would be
there before dark.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>But M'sieu Duflos had no cart to lend them&mdash;that is he had
no horse. Didn't Mam'zelle Fleurette and Ma'ame Louise remember?
Some of those brigands had been round the week before and
requisitioned every horse they could lay their hands on all over
the country-side; old nags, mares with foals, butchers' cobs,
nothing came amiss to them, nothing was sacred. Oh those soldiers!
Were they not the curse of the country? And what difference there
was between the so-called revolutionary army and a pillaging band
of pirates, M'sieu' Duflos, the butcher, really couldn't say.</p>

<p>All this he told the two women, to the accompaniment of wide
gestures of his powerful arms and much shrugging of his broad
shoulders. It was Fleurette who had put the question breathlessly
to him, as soon as she had caught sight of him standing on the door
of his shop, blocking it with his massive bulk.</p>

<p>"A horse? A cart? Alas! it was impossible! Ah! those brigands!
those brigands!"</p>

<p>Fleurette could not conceal her disappointment at first; but she
was so brave, so resolute; she was for making an immediate start so
as to get to Sisteron before dark. Perhaps they would meet horse
and cart belonging to some neighbour luckier than poor M'sieu'
Duflos. But Louise, more prudent, saw an opportunity for putting
the mad adventure off until the next day. A start in the early
morning could then be made, she argued, and horse or no horse,
Sisteron might be reached before the sun was low. A good project
forsooth. Let Fleurette return with her quietly now to Lou Mas and
sleep on it. That was it! sleep on it! If only Fleurette would do
that she, Louise, felt quite sure that counsels of prudence would
prevail.</p>

<p>M. Duflos sagely nodded his head. Sisteron? He could not
conjecture why Mam'zelle Fleurette should wish to go to Sisteron.
Without an escort! And on foot! What would Citizen Armand say to
it, if he knew?</p>

<p>Up to this point, you perceive, not a word about the exciting
events that had convulsed Laragne a little over two hours ago.
M'sieu' Duflos, watching Fleurette, marvelled how much the girl
knew. She on the other hand was longing to ask questions, whilst
dreading to lose time in unnecessary gossip. She looked about her
at the familiar objects: the pump, the shop fronts, the <i>poste de
gendarmerie</i>, on the other side of the square, and in the corner
of this Rue Haute where the soldiers must have stood this morning
with Amédé, a prisoner amongst them.</p>

<p>Everything for the moment in Laragne appeared calm, not to say
commonplace. The women had all gone home to cook the midday dinner;
the men were at their work. Every moment she thought that she must
see Amédé coming round the corner with his slow swinging steps,
looking for her! M'sieu' Duflos and Louise were talking together,
not exactly in whispers, but under their breath; the way people
talk when the subject is exciting and perhaps awe-inspiring. And
suddenly M. Duflos exclaimed with a great, big sigh of
compassion:</p>

<p>"If it is not a misery! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! those poor
Colombes!"</p>

<p>His kindly glance turned to Fleurette, and he saw her big blue
eyes fixed on him. And as he was a very worthy fellow this M.
Duflos, with a daughter of his own, he could not somehow return
that glance; there was something in it that reminded him of a young
animal in pain. He guessed that she had heard the news about young
Colombe, and he knew, as every one did in Laragne, that Fleurette,
over at Lou Mas, and Amédé Colombe were fond of one another, and
that they would be tokened as soon as the girl had turned eighteen.
This love-romance had been part of the village life ever since the
two children had made mud pies together in the market square with
the dust of the road and the water from the fountain, and though
Armand, over at Lou Mas had become very queer of late, and no one
knew anything about the mysterious business which, of recent years,
kept him away from home for months on end, every one remembered the
pretty Marseillaise whom nineteen years ago he had brought to Lou
Mas as a blushing bride, and no one had forgotten the terrible
tragedy of her death when she gave birth to Fleurette. With the
kindliness, one might say the indifference, peculiar to the
peasant, the neighbours put down Armand's growing moroseness after
that terrible event, and his secretive ways, to grief over the
death of his young wife; and then after a while, they ceased to
trouble about him at all, and almost forgot him as it were. But
Fleurette had grown up among them all, a true child of sunny
Dauphiné, in spite of her fair hair and blue eyes. They all loved
her because she was so pretty, and though M'sieu' Colombe, the
prosperous grocer of the Rue Haute, might at one time have had more
ambitious views for his son, he and Ma'ame Colombe soon fell
victims to Fleurette's charm, her dainty ways, her quaint little
airs, as if she were a lady strayed into this remote village from
some great city, and, above all, being natives of the South, and
children of France, they succumbed to the fascination of her
wealth; for there was no doubt that Armand was rich, and no doubt
that he had made a declaration both privately to his friend Colombe
and officially before the notary at Sisteron, that he would give
his only child a dowry of ten thousand livres tournois, the day she
married with his consent.</p>

<p>And here was this child now, whom every one knew and whom every
one loved, turning great, pleading eyes on M'sieu' Duflos until the
worthy fellow felt so uncomfortable that he had to clear his throat
very noisily and to expectorate on the sanded floor of his shop
with a sound like the falling of a shower of hailstones on a tiled
roof. He thought that Fleurette knew all the details of this
morning's dramatic story.</p>

<p>"Voyons, Mam'zelle Fleurette," he said with a rough attempt at
consolation. "They won't do anything to Amédé. Really. The boy
meant no harm."</p>

<p>All then would have been well if that fool Aristide Sicard, who
was M'sieu' Duflos' errand-man, had not put in a word.</p>

<p>"No one," he said, "is going to believe that Amédé Colombe is a
thief."</p>

<p>"A thief?" and Fleurette gave a funny little gasp. "Why should
they think that Amédé is a thief?"</p>

<p>M'sieu Duflos, the butcher, had given his errand-man a vigorous
kick, but the correction came too late. And now Fleurette wanted to
know more.</p>

<p>"What is your meaning, M'sieu' Aristide?" she insisted with that
funny little air of determination of hers, whilst a frown appeared
between her brows.</p>

<p>As M'sieu' Duflos explained to the neighbours afterwards,
Fleurette looked as if she might be capable of anything at the
moment. He was quite frightened at the expression in her blue eyes.
It was too late to undo the mischief that that fool Aristide had
done, so the butcher took the matter into his own hands. He had a
sound knowledge of human nature, had M'sieu' Duflos, and he prided
himself on his tact.</p>

<p>"You see, Mam'zelle Fleurette," he began, "it's this way. Those
scurvy knaves&mdash;I mean the soldiers of the Republic&mdash;were
full of choler because they had not found enough to steal at the
château when they arrested poor M'sieu' de Frontenac. At first, it
seems, they thought that Madame and Mademoiselle had taken their
valuables away with them when they ran away; but later on something
must have aroused their suspicions, or else the same kind of fool
as Aristide here must have got talking. Anyway, they seem to have
got the idea that Amédé Colombe had hidden Madame's valuables away
somewhere and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madame's valuables!" Fleurette exclaimed, trying to hide
something of the excitement which was causing her heart to thump
furiously. "They thought that Amédé&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" M'sieu' Duflos replied to her half-formulated query.
"And unfortunately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well! They found Madame's valuables&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the worthy butcher got no further with his story. Without
another word and swift as lightning, Fleurette had turned on her
heel, and the next moment she was speeding across the market-place
in the direction of the Rue Haute, whilst M'sieu' Duflos was left
gazing in ludicrous perplexity at old Louise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the child?" he queried, and thoughtfully
passed his hand through his harsh, bristly hair. "I thought she
knew."</p>

<p>Old Louise shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"She only knew that the lad had been arrested," she said, "but
she had not heard about Madame's valuables being found in the
Colombes' cart-shed. I was just able to stop Adèle telling her.
She is so fond of M'sieu' Amédé." Louise added with a sigh: "Oh!
how I wish her father were here."</p>

<p>M'sieu' Duflos was watching Fleurette's trim little figure
speeding across the square and then disappearing round the corner
of the Rue Haute.</p>

<p>"She's run over to the épicerie," he commented drily. "The
Colombes are fond of her. They'll be able to comfort one another.
Come in and have a petit verre, Louise. The child will be back
soon."</p>

<p>But Louise would not come in, she did not want to lose sight of
Fleurette, so after thanking the kind butcher for his hospitality,
she too turned to go in the direction of the Rue Haute. But at the
last M'sieu' Duflos had one more word to say to her.</p>

<p>"There's one thing more, Ma'ame Louise," he said, with unwonted
earnestness in his round, prominent eyes. "If I were you I would
look after that wench of yours, Adèle, a bit sharper. No offence,
you know, but people have been talking in the village. She was
rather too familiar with all those draggled-tailed soldiers last
night."</p>

<p>Old Louise, with all a peasant's philosophy, shrugged her fat
shoulders.</p>

<p>"You may be right, M'sieu' Duflos," she said drily, "but the
girl, you know, is no care of mine. My sister Amèlie looks after
her."</p>

<p>After which she gave a friendly nod to the amiable butcher and
made her way up to the Rue Haute as fast as she could, though this
was not really so fast as Fleurette's nimble little feet had
carried her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>There had been no need for words. As soon as Fleurette had
entered the shop Ma'ame Colombe had stretched out her arms, and
Fleurette ran to her at once to be enfolded in a great maternal
embrace. With her fair hair resting on Ma'ame Colombe's ample
bosom, the child began by having a good cry. She had had none since
she heard the fatal news, for excitement had kept every other
emotion in check. But now with those motherly arms round her, she
felt free to let her sorrow and anxiety have free rein. Ma'ame
Colombe's ample bosom heaving against hers, and the older woman's
tears wetting the top of her fair head, Fleurette looked up,
swiftly drying her eyes, and put on a reassuring smile.</p>

<p>It was difficult to speak at first with all those sobs choking
one's voice; nevertheless, whilst mopping her eyes with her
pocket-handkerchief, Fleurette contrived to say:</p>

<p>"You know, Ma'ame Colombe, that it is all right, don't you?
About Amédé, I mean."</p>

<p>"All right, my dear? All right?" the poor woman reiterated, and
shook her head with pathetic dubiousness. "How can it be all right,
when my Amédé is accused of being a thief? And before the
neighbours too!" she added, whilst a deeper tone of crimson than
her kitchen-fire had lent to her kind old face, spread over her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"That's just it, Ma'ame Colombe," Fleurette continued eagerly.
"Presently&mdash;to-night I hope&mdash;every one will know that it
was not Amédé who took those things."</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't take them. But you know what village gossip
is. If Amédé did not take Madame's valuables, they keep on saying,
how came they to be in our cart-shed? Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!" she
moaned, "to think that my Hector and I should live to see such
disgrace."</p>

<p>"But, Ma'ame Colombe," Fleurette put in, somewhat impatient with
the older woman's lamentations, "I am going to Sisteron to-night to
tell the <i>gendarme</i> how Madame's valuables came to be in your
cart-shed, and who it was that stole them."</p>

<p>"You, child? How should you know?"</p>

<p>"Because it was I who took the valuables out of the secret place
in Madame's room," Fleurette said glibly, "and I gave them to Amédé
to take care of, and because it was I who gave them to him he hid
them in a corner of the cart-shed."</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" was all that Ma'ame Colombe was able to say in
response to this amazing story, "the child has taken leave of her
senses."</p>

<p>"No, no, Ma'ame Colombe," Fleurette insisted earnestly; "it is
just as I have told you. I took the valuables out of Madame's room
while the soldiers were at the château, and I gave them to Amédé to
take care of."</p>

<p>"But why?" the poor mother exclaimed, in an agony of
bewilderment. "In Heaven's name why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>And suddenly Fleurette hesitated. A hot flush rose to her cheeks
and tears gathered in her eyes. She had felt Ma'ame Colombe's
perplexed glance on her, and for the time a stinging doubt gripped
her heart and made her physically almost sick. What views would
other people&mdash;strangers or even friends&mdash;take of her
amazing story? of the heavenly voice and the mysterious
faggot-carrier with the wonderful twinkling eyes? Would they
believe her? or would they deride the whole tale? or again, like
dear, kind Ma'ame Colombe, would they just feel anxious, perplexed,
not wishing to condemn, and yet vaguely wondering what could have
induced a girl like Fleurette to go rummaging about among Madame's
things, and inducing young Amédé to help her to conceal them.</p>

<p>An overpowering impulse prompted her to keep her beloved secret
to herself. The sight of Ma'ame Colombe's grief-stricken face
almost shook her resolution, but in the end it was that first
impulse which conquered. After all it was only a matter of a few
days, hours perhaps, and everything would become crystal-clear.
Fleurette's little handkerchief was now like a wet ball in her hot
hands; she breathed on it and dabbed her eyes; she straightened her
cap and smoothed down her kirtle.</p>

<p>"And so, dear Ma'ame Colombe," she said calmly, "I am just going
to Sisteron. Probably I shall find Bibi there; but even if I don't,
I shall go up to the Committee of Public Safety, and I shall tell
them the whole truth, so that there'll be no question of Amédé
going to fight the English with the stain of theft upon his
name."</p>

<p>It was impossible to say anything more just then, because Louise
had arrived at the épicerie, breathless, but happy to catch sight
of Fleurette looking quite calm and reasonable.</p>

<p>"I hope you gave the child a good scolding, Ma'ame Colombe," she
said. "The idea of her wanting to trapeze the high-road to-day when
all these ruffianly soldiers are still about."</p>

<p>But Fleurette only smiled. "Neither Ma'ame Colombe, nor anyone
else," she said, "could dissuade me from going to see Bibi
now."</p>

<p>"Why!" Louise exclaimed pettishly, "this morning it was M'sieu'
Amédé you wanted to see."</p>

<p>"I do want to see Amédé," Fleurette rejoined simply, "but I must
see Bibi first."</p>

<p>And Louise saw her exchange an understanding glance with Ma'ame
Colombe. It was all very bewildering and very terrible. Of course
she was terribly sorry for the Colombes, but, just for the moment,
she wished them all at the bottom of the sea. A little feeling of
jealousy had crept into her heart when she saw Fleurette clinging
to Ma'ame Colombe and whispering words into her ears which she,
Louise, could not hear, and this uncomfortable feeling added to her
discomfort. What could Ma'ame Colombe be thinking about to
encourage Fleurette in her obstinacy? Louise could only suppose
that all common sense had been drowned in an ocean of grief for the
beloved only son.</p>

<p>Ah! if only Monsieur Armand were here!</p>

<p>And with a last sigh and a none too cordial farewell to Ma'ame
Colombe, Louise, dolefully shaking her head, followed Fleurette out
of the shop.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>It was long past sunset by the time the two women reached
Sisteron. Louise was dog-tired, for the day had been hot and the
roads heavy with dust. They had started from Lou Mas one hour
before noon, and as they left the first outlying houses of the city
behind them, the clock of the tower of Notre Dame was striking
eight.</p>

<p>The road between Laragne and Sisteron goes uphill most of the
way, but withal, it is a beautiful road, winding through the wide
valley of the Buëche, past orchards of grey-green olives and
almond-trees laden with blossoms. Once past the confluence of the
Méouge with the Buëche, it rises in a gentle gradient and gradually
reveals to the eye with magnificent panorama of the Basses Alpes
with their rocky crests and wide flanks draped in the sombre cloaks
of pinewoods: Mont de la Baume, St. Géniez, Signal de Lure; as
beautiful a picture as Nature has to offer for the delectation of
travellers, but possessing no powers of fascination over the two
women, who tramped along in weariness and with anxious hearts.</p>

<p>The road was lonely. Scarce anyone did they meet on the way; no
one, at any rate, to inspire old Louise with alarm. Now and then,
perhaps, a group of labourers toiling homewards would cast a bold
glance on the pretty wench stepping it resolutely beside her old
duenna. But after a ribald word or two, or at worst a coarse jest,
they would pass on and the two women continued their way
unmolested.</p>

<p>But the events of the day, subsequently those of the evening,
were but one long string of disappointments. As soon as the first
outlying houses of the city came in sight, Fleurette began
inquiring pluckily and determinedly.</p>

<p>"Citizen Armand," she would ask, "from Lou Mas, over beyond
Laragne?"</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"He is an important personage in Sisteron, how could I find
him?"</p>

<p>And because she was gentle and had pretty blue eyes, and because
she looked weary and anxious, people would do their best to help
her. Some suggested one place, some another; the
posting-inn&mdash;he might be known there, if he sometimes posted
to Paris&mdash;or else the commissariat. This latter place proved a
danger spot. A ferocious-looking commissaire very nearly detained
the two women on a charge of vagabondage. His ugly leers and
unveiled threats nearly sent Louise off her head with terror;
Fleurette, however, kept up her courage nobly. The thought of Amédé
drove every other terror out of her heart. She had vaguely heard
that her father had something to do with a certain Committee of
Public Safety. When she told this to the commissaire his manner
immediately underwent a complete change; he became almost
obsequious, placed himself entirely at the disposal of the
citizeness for any inquiries she might wish to make about her
illustrious father. Unfortunately, he said, the hour was late; the
officers of the Committee of Public Safety situated in the Town
Hall were now closed for the night. Citizen Armand had probably
found shelter under the roof of a friend. Until to-morrow morning
nothing could be done.</p>

<p>One thing, however, appeared clear; the soldier who had created
so much stir in Laragne this morning had not come to Sisteron nor
was anything known of them. There was, the now servile commissary
explained, a detachment of the 87th regiment of the line in
garrison in the city and two days ago a squad of the revolutionary
army lately formed for the purpose of scouring the country for
traitors and aristos had passed through Sisteron and gone on in the
direction of Laragne. The commissary had heard something about a
family named Frontenac against whom there was a black mark for
treason against the Republic, but he did not know anything about
the arrest of Monsieur or the escape of Madame and
Mademoiselle&mdash;whom he persistently referred to as the
<i>ci-devants</i>&mdash;nor did he know anything about the arrest
of Amédé Colombe, citizen of Laragne.</p>

<p>It was all very disappointing. Fleurette, trying to be brave,
nevertheless felt at times an overwhelming inclination to cry. For
one thing she was very tired, and being young and healthy she was
also hungry. She and Louise had consumed the contents of their
provision basket when the day was still young. Now it was getting
near bed-time and the goal of her efforts not even within sight.
The sullenness and mistrust that seemed to hang over the whole city
had the effect of further damping her spirits. The echo of the
terrible doings in Orange, in Toulon, and Lyons had penetrated as
far as this hitherto peaceful little town. Tales of summary
arrests, of death-sentences without trial, of wholesale massacres
were on everybody's lips. Accusations of treason, it seems, were
more frequent than daily bread. The women looked harassed, hugged
their children to their sides, as they slunk down the ill-lit
streets, whilst throwing furtive glances over their shoulders. The
men stood about in groups of three or four in the dark angles of
the streets of beneath the ill-lit doorways until roughly ordered
to go their way by men dressed in nothing but rags, who wore a
tricolour sash round their waist and a cockade on their worsted
cap.</p>

<p>And so ultimately to Les Amandiers, a quiet little inn off the
main streets of the town, that Louise knew of through the drovers
from Laragne who frequented the place when they were in Sisteron on
market-day. Baptiste Portal, the landlord, suspicious at first,
not liking the look of the two unprotected women seeking for
lodgings at this hour of the night, was mollified by seeing the
colour of Louise's money and the blue of Fleurette's eyes. His
temper, it seems, had not yet recovered from the assaults made upon
it a couple of days ago by a set of ragamuffins who called
themselves soldiers of the Republic, and by their loud-spoken and
arrogant lieutenant; but he was willing enough to make the two
women welcome, and to give them supper and a bed. Then only did
they tell him who they were and what the purpose of their journey:
to seek Citizen Armand of Lou Mas, whose daughter Fleurette had
matters of the utmost importance to communicate to him.</p>

<p>"Qu'à ça ne tienne!" Baptiste Portal exclaimed. "Armand was here
but a couple of hours after noon. He was on his way to Orange."</p>

<p>"To Orange!" A cry of terror from Louise; one of excitement from
Fleurette. Orange, the tiger's den! How could two unprotected women
hope to enter it without being devoured? Orange where the
guillotine was at work night and day! where men and women and even
children were massacred in droves, where innocent people hardly
dared to speak or smile or pray, lest they be seized and thrown
into prison, only to be dragged out again to a horrible death.</p>

<p>Orange!</p>

<p>But Fleurette only smiled. What had they to fear seeing Bibi
chéri would be there? Was not Bibi far, far more powerful than the
whole of the revolutionary army? Fleurette had seen him at the
château, with a great tricolour sash round his waist, giving
orders, that the officer in command of the soldiers dared not
disobey.</p>

<p>Orange! She was not afraid of Orange! Even if the great
Robespierre was in Oragne she would not be afraid to go.</p>

<p>After all, what did it mean? Two or three days' journey in the
old <i>coche</i> which, it seems, left the Place d'Armes two days
of the week, at nine o'clock in the morning, and lumbering along
through Peipin, and Saint Etienne-les-Orgues, gave one the chance
of getting a good bed for the night at Sault, and again at
Carpentras, if one was too tired to continue one's journey
then.</p>

<p>Orange indeed? Why should one fear Orange, when chance was all
in one's favour. As luck would have it, it was the very next day
that the <i>coche</i> would be starting from the Place d'Armes. All
one needed was a few things, a clean pair of stockings, a
handkerchief or two, a bit of soap and a towel, which dear, kind
Ma'ame Portal was only too ready to lend; these were tied in a
bundle and formed the only indispensable luggage which Fleurette
and Louise would take with them. Fortunately Louise had plenty of
money in her pocket, being always well supplied by Bibi, and then,
of course, in Orange, Bibi would be there and he would provide
further as necessity arose.</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that among the passengers who took their
places in the lumbering old vehicle that morning were two females,
one of whom had corn-coloured hair and eyes bluer than
forget-me-nots.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville at Orange still stands, as it did then, in
the newly-named Place de la République; and if the tourist of
to-day mounts its steps, enters the building through its central
portal, crosses the wide vestibule and finally turns down a long
corridor on his right, he will, almost at the end of this, come to
a door which bears the legend: "Travaux Publics."</p>

<p>Should he be bold enough to push open the door, he will find
himself in a perfectly banal room, with white-washed walls covered
with maps and plans that are of no interest to him, a large desk at
one end, and a few wooden chairs. There is a thin carpet in the
middle of the red-tiled floor and faded green rep curtains temper
the glaring light of the afternoon sun. But on this day of May,
1794, there were no curtains to the window, and not even a strip of
carpet on the floor. There was no desk either, only a long trestle
table covered with a tattered green cloth, behind which, on wooden
chairs, sat three men, dressed alike in dark blue coats tightly
buttoned across the chest, drab breeches and high topped boots, and
wearing tricolour sashes around their waist.</p>

<p>The one who sat in the centre and who appeared to be in supreme
authority rested his elbow on the table, and his chin was supported
in his hand. He was gazing intently on a man who stood before him,
in the centre of the room, the other side of the table; a man who
looked foot-sore and weary and who wore a military uniform all
tattered and covered with slime and dust.</p>

<p>The two others also kept their eyes fixed on this man. They were
listening with rapt interest to the story which he was relating.
Early this morning he and a dozen others also attired in tattered
uniforms had come into Orange in a state bordering on collapse.
They had made their way to the barracks where the officer in
command had mercifully given them food and drink. As soon as they
had eaten and drunk, they tried to tell their story; but this was
so amazing, not to say incredible, that the officer in command had
thought it prudent to send for the superintendent of
<i>gendarmerie</i>, who in turn had the men conveyed to the Hôtel
de Ville, there to be brought before the Representative of the
Convention on special mission who sat with the Committee of Public
Safety. And now Lieutenant Godet stood alone to face the Committee;
the others had been handed back to the <i>gendarmerie</i> to be
dealt with later on. The representative on special mission who sat
with the two other Members of the Committee at the table covered
with the tattered green cloth, had questioned Godet, and he
thereupon embarked upon the story of this amazing adventure. He
began by relating the events which three days ago had set the quiet
little commune of Laragne seething with excitement. He told of the
arrival of the squad of soldiers in magnificent uniforms, under the
command of an officer more superb than anything that had ever been
seen in the countryside before. He told of the perquisition in the
house of Citizen Colombe the grocer, by those magnificent soldiers,
of the finding there by them of certain valuables belonging to the
<i>ci-devant</i> Frontenacs, valuables which he himself had vainly
searched for in the château, the evening before. He told of the
arrest of young Colombe: of the high-handed manner in which the
superb officer had relieved him, Godet, of his command, and ordered
him and his men, together with the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac, to
join his squad, and to march with him out of Laragne. He had told
it all with a wealth of detail, and the members of the Committee
had listened in silence and with rapt interest.</p>

<p>But now the man at the table who was the representative on
special mission, and who appeared chief in authority, broke in with
an exclamation that was almost one of rage.</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me, citizen lieutenant," he said in a
harsh, rasping voice, "that you could mistake a lot of English
spies&mdash;for that is what they were, you may take it from
me&mdash;that you could mistake them, I say, for soldiers of our
army. Where were your eyes?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Godet gave a shrug which he hoped would pass for
unconcern. In reality he felt physically sick; a prey to
overwhelming terror. At first, when he and his men had come in sight
of the city, they had felt nothing but relief to see the end of
what had been almost martyrdom. It was only afterwards, when he
found himself in this narrow room, with its white-washed walls and
its silence, and face to face with those three men, that fear had
entered his heart. He felt like an animal in a cage&mdash;a mouse
looking into the pale, piercing eyes of a cat. He passed his tongue
once or twice over his parched lips before he gave reply.</p>

<p>"I was not the only one, citizen," he said sullenly, "who was
deceived. The whole commune of Laragne was at the heels of those
soldiers. My own men were mustered before the pseudo-captain and
heard him give words of command."</p>

<p>"But Englishmen, citizen lieutenant," the man at the table
argued; "Englishmen! Their appearance! Their speech!"</p>

<p>"They spoke as you and I would, Citizen Chauvelin," Godet
retorted, still sullenly. "As for appearance, one man is like
another. I could not be expected to know every officer of our army
by sight!"</p>

<p>"But you said they were splendidly dressed!"</p>

<p>"They were. I knew the uniform well enough. Had there been a
doubtful button or a galloon wanting I should have spotted it."</p>

<p>"But so clean!" one of the others at the table remarked with a
sigh, that might have been of envy, "so magnificent!"</p>

<p>"I knew that there were some compagnies d'élite," the lieutenant
rejoined, "attached to certain regiments. How could I guess?"</p>

<p>"It might have been better for you if you had," the man in the
centre remarked drily.</p>

<p>Godet's wan face took on a more ashen hue; again he passed his
tongue over his parched lips.</p>

<p>"Haven't we had enough of this?" one of the others at the table
now put in impatiently. "We are satisfied that those English spies,
or whatever they were, acted with amazing effrontery, which makes
me think that perhaps they are a part of that gang that we all know
of, and of which Citizen Chauvelin spoke just now. We are also
satisfied that Citizen Lieutenant Godet did not show that acumen
which an officer in his responsible position should have done. What
we want to know now is, what happened after the pseudo-captain of
the so-called 33rd division had arrested that young Colombe and
marched out of Laragne?"</p>

<p>"And in your interest, citizen lieutenant," the man in the
centre rejoined sternly, "I advise you to make a statement that is
truthful in every detail."</p>

<p>"Had I wished to tell lies," the soldier retorted sullenly, "I
shouldn't be here now. I should have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter," the other broke in curtly, "what you would have
done. The State desires to know what you did."</p>

<p>"Well!" Lieutenant Godet began after a moment or two during
which he appeared to collect his thoughts. "We marched out of
Laragne in the direction of Serres. The captain&mdash;I still, of
course, looked upon his as a captain&mdash;had so disposed us that
I and my own men were between two squads of his. We were footsore,
all of us, because we had had three days' tramping in the dust, one
day battling against hard wind, another with long hours spent in
scouring the château of those traitors Frontenacs; we were also
very hungry. Remember that we had been dragged out of our beds in
the early morning, and not given a chance of getting a bite or
drink before starting on the march. But they, the others, were
fresh as if they had just come out of barracks with their bellies
full...They marched along at a swinging pace, and it was as much as
we could do to keep step with them."</p>

<p>The man's voice became somewhat more steady as he talked. The
note of terror which had been so conspicuous in it at first had
given place to one of dull resentment. Encouraged by the obvious
interest which his story had evoked in his hearers, he resumed more
glibly:</p>

<p>"About half a league north of Laragne, a bridle-path branches
off the high-road; into this the captain ordered his company to
turn, and we continued to plod along through the dust and in the
midday heat, till we came to a tumble-down cottage by the roadside;
a cottage flanked by a dilapidated shed, and a bit of garden all
overgrown with weeds. Here a halt was called, and the prisoners
were ordered out of the wagon. A moment or two later a woman
appeared at the cottage door, some words were exchanged between her
and the captain, and subsequently, when order to march was given,
the prisoners marched along with us; the wagon and horses having
been left behind at the cottage."</p>

<p>"Didn't you think this very strange, citizen lieutenant?" one of
the men at the table asked; "a wagon and horses which you would
naturally presume belonged to the State, being thus left at a
tumble-down roadside cottage?"</p>

<p>"Whatever I may have thought," the lieutenant replied, "it was
not my place to make observations to my superior officer."</p>

<p>"Superior officer!" the man in the centre remarked, with a
gesture of contemptuous wrath.</p>

<p>"I think, Citizen Chauvelin," the accused now put in a little
more firmly, "that you are unnecessarily hard on me. There was
really nothing to indicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the other broke in with a vicious snarl:</p>

<p>"Nothing to indicate&mdash;? Nothing? The eyes of a patriot
should be sharp enough to detect a spy or a traitor through any
disguise&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, and cast a quick, inquisitorial glance at
his two colleagues first, then at the soldier before him. Had he
detected a trace, a sign, a flicker of the eyelid that betrayed
knowledge of his own past? of the times&mdash;numberless
now&mdash;that he too had been hoodwinked by those bold adventurers
who called themselves the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and by
their chief whose prowess in the art of disguise had marked some of
the most humiliating hours in Chauvelin's career? Calais, Boulogne,
Nantes, Paris; each of those great cities had a record of the
Terrorist's discomfiture when brought face to face with that
mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. Even now, crushed in the
hot palm of his hand, he held a scrap of paper which had revealed
the author of the plot to which that fool Lieutenant Godet had
fallen a victim&mdash;just as he, himself, Chauvelin, had
done&mdash;just like that&mdash;and so many times&mdash;The penalty
for him had always been more humiliation, a further fall from the
original high place which he had once occupied in Paris: and with
it the knowledge that one day the masters of France would tire of
his failures. Ah! he knew that well enough, he knew that they would
tire, and then they would crush him as they had crushed others,
whose only crime, like his, had been failure.</p>

<p>His only claim to immunity, so far, had been the fact that he
alone, of all the members of the National Assembly, of all the
members of the Committees, or of the Executive, knew who the
Scarlet Pimpernel really was; he had seen him without disguise; he
knew him by name, not only him but some of his more important
followers; and when some of the ferocious tyrants, who for the time
being were the masters of France, did at times loudly demand the
suppression of Citizen Chauvelin, for incompetence that amounted to
treason, there were always others who pleaded for him because of
that knowledge. Many felt that with the death of Chauvelin, the
last hope of capturing that band of English spies would have to be
abandoned; and so they pleaded for his retention and their
fellow-tyrants allowed him another few months' grace so that he
might accomplish that which they knew was the great purpose of his
life. And whenever in the opinion of those bloodthirsty tigers, who
held France under their domination, some outlying provincial
districts had need of what they called "purging from the pestilence
of traitors," whenever wholesale arrests, perquisitions, wholesale
death-sentences or brutal massacres were the order of the day,
Citizen Chauvelin was sent down with special powers, always in the
vain hope that the Scarlet Pimpernel, emboldened by success, would
fall into the trap perpetually set for him. The English spy's
predilection for aristos, his sympathies so quickly aroused when
traitors happened to be women or young children, was sure to draw
his activities to any region where prisons were full and the
guillotine kept busy.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Citizen Chauvelin had been sent to Orange. The
Southern provinces of France had been left far too long to welter
in a morass of treason; there were veritable nests of traitors in
the châteaux and farms of Provence and Dauphiné. The country had to
be purged: the traitors extirpated; the magnificent Law of the
Suspect be set in motion to do this cleansing process. Any man who
ventured to criticize the government, who complained of taxation or
restrictions was a traitor; any man or woman who owned more than
they needed for bare subsistence, who refused to pour of their
surplus into the lap of patriots, was a traitor, and the country
must be purged of them, until the dictatorship of the proletariat
was firmly established, until every man, woman and child in the
whole of France had been dragged down to the same level of mental
and physical wreckage.</p>

<p>There had been a dramatic pause after Chauvelin's outburst of
contemptuous wrath; for a minute or two, while the old clock up on
the wall ticked away with slow monotony, a strange silence remained
hanging over the scene. Whatever the other three men may have known
or remembered of the noted Terrorist's past history, they thought
it wiser to say nothing. In these days of universal brotherhood and
Liberty, every man in France was frightened of his neighbour. The
time had come when the lustful tigers, satiated with the blood of
those whom they deemed their enemies, had turned, thirsting, for
that of their whilom friends. The makers of the Terror had started
digging their fangs into each other's throats. The victory now was
to the most ferocious. After the Girondins, Danton, he, who had
ordered the September massacres, two and a half years ago, had had
to yeild to a more vengeful, more merciless power than his own.</p>

<p>Chauvelin knew that. The victory to-day was to the most
ferocious. He who would sacrifice friends, brother, sister, child,
was the true patriot; the man who stayed his hand in face of a
revolting crime that would put a wild beast to the blush, was
unworthy the name of citizen of France. Therefore death to him.
Death to the weakling. To the Moderate. This was the era of the
Universal Brotherhood of Death.</p>

<p>What chance then had this unfortunate Lieutenant Godet now?
brought to justice&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;before a man who knew
that to show weakness was to court death. No wonder that all the
swagger and the arrogance which made him but a day or two ago the
terror of a lot of peasants at Sisteron or Laragne, was knocked out
of him, by a mere glance from those pale, piercing eyes. And
he&mdash;a mere notary's clerk born and bred in the depth of
Dauphiné, and thrust into the army, as a mule is thrust into
harness&mdash;knew nothing of Paris save from hearsay, and nothing
of the men whose word had even sent a king and queen to the
scaffold. He knew nothing of Citizen Chauvelin, save that he was a
man of power, before whose piercing glance and tricolour sash every
man instinctively cringed and trembled. He knew nothing of
Chauvelin's tussles with those same English spies who had so
effectually led him, Godet, by the nose; nothing of Citizen
Chauvelin's past life, very little of the present. He was just a
mouse in the power of a cat; allowed a little freedom just now,
while he told his tale of failure.</p>

<p>"Continue, citizen lieutenant," Chauvelin now said more calmly.
"We are listening."</p>

<p>"Let me see," Godet rejoined vaguely, "where was I?"</p>

<p>"On the bridle-path off the main road," Chauvelin responded with
a sneer; "half a league north of Laragne. The wagon and horses
presumably belonging to the State left in a tumble-down cottage by
the roadside. A thrilling situation forsooth. An ordinary situation
you would have us believe. Pray continue. What happened after
that?"</p>

<p>"We marched and we marched and we marched," the lieutenant
resumed sullenly. "We marched until we were ready to drop. We had
had three days of marching and had started in the morning without a
bite, hungry! Nom d'un nome! how hungry we were! and weak and
faint! The hours sped on; we could see the sun mounting the heavens
and then start on its descent. The heat was intense, the dust
terrible. It filled our eyes, our nostrils, our mouths. The soles
of our feet were bleeding, sweat poured down our faces and obscured
our vision. We marched and we marched, through two villages, the
names of which I do not know; then over mountain passes, across
rocky gorges, stepping over streams, climbing the sides of hills,
the banks of rivers. I am a stranger in these parts. And I was
tired. Tired! I knew not where we were, whither we were going.
March! March! March! Ceaselessly. Even had I dared, I would no
longer have had the strength to ask questions or to beg for
mercy."</p>

<p>And at the recollection of those hours of agony, Lieutenant
Godet wiped the perspiration from his streaming brow.</p>

<p>"Well?" Chauvelin queried drily, "and the others, the
Englishmen?"</p>

<p>"They marched along at a swinging pace," Godet replied,
smothering a savage oath. "Without turning a hair. They kicked up
no dust. They did not sweat. They just marched. No doubt their
bellies were well filled."</p>

<p>"And the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"They set to with a will. And I make no doubt but they had fed
and drunk while they sat in the wagon. At any rate they showed no
fatigue."</p>

<p>"How long did you continue on the march?"</p>

<p>"Till one by one we&mdash;my comrades and I&mdash;fell out by
the roadside."</p>

<p>"And those who fell out were left, while the others went
on?"</p>

<p>"Yes! We had gone through the second village, and were marching
along the edge of a stream, when the first lot of us dropped out.
Three of my men. They just rolled down the bank of the stream; and
there lay on their stomachs trying to drink. The captain&mdash;or
whatever he was, curse him!&mdash;called 'Halt!' and one of his men
ran down the bank and had a look at those three poor fellows who
lay there striving to slake their hunger as well as their thirst in
the cool mountain stream. But, <i>nom de nom</i>! They&mdash;the
miscreants!&mdash;had no bowels of compassion. I believe&mdash;for
in truth I was too tired to see anything clearly&mdash;that one of
them did leave a hunk of bread by the side of the stream: perhaps
he was afraid that those poor fellows would die of inanition and
then their death would be upon his conscience."</p>

<p>"Well! And did all the men fall out that way?"</p>

<p>"Yes! We were marching three abreast: and three by three we all
fell out. Always beside the stream, for we suffered from thirst as
much as from hunger. The stream seemed to draw us, and three of us,
as if by common understanding, would just roll down the bank and
lie on our stomachs and try to drink. The captain no longer called
a halt when that happened. One of his own men would just throw
pieces of bread down to the edge of the stream, just as they would
to a dog."</p>

<p>"And you were the last to fall out?"</p>

<p>"The very last. I verily believe, when I rolled down the bank
and felt the cool stream against my face, that I had died and
reached the Elsyian fields. A piece of bread was thrown to me, and
I fell on it like a starved beast."</p>

<p>"And then what happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing as far as we were concerned. The bank of the stream,
for a length of two kilometres or more, was strewn with our
dead&mdash;that is not dead, you understand, but fatigued, and only
half-conscious with hunger: while those miscreants, those limbs of
Satan, marched off without as much as a last look at us! Gaily they
marched away singing. Yes, singing, some awful gibberish, in a
tongue I did not understand. That is," poor Godet went on ruefully,
"when first I had an inkling of the awful truth. That strange
tongue gave it away. You understand?"</p>

<p>The others nodded.</p>

<p>"And then, by chance, I put my hand in the back pocket of my
tunic, and felt that piece of paper."</p>

<p>With finger that quivered slightly, he pointed to Chauvelin's
hand; between the clenched claw-like fingers there protruded the
corner of a scrap of paper. Chauvelin failed to suppress the
exclamation of rage which rose to his lips.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de nom</i>!" he muttered savagely through his teeth, and
with his handkerchief he wiped the beads of moisture that had risen
to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>"And so they marched away," one of the others remarked drily.
"In which direction?"</p>

<p>"Straight on," the soldier replied laconically.</p>

<p>"On the way to Nyons, I suppose, and Walreas?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I don't know the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"You do not seem to have known much, Lieutenant Godet,"
Chauvelin put in with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I come from the other side of the Drac," Godet retorted. "I
could not&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Chauvelin broke in with an oath:</p>

<p>"Wherever you come from, citizen," he said sternly, "it was your
duty to become acquainted with the country through which you were
ordered to march your men."</p>

<p>"I had no orders to take them through mountain passes," Godet
remarked sullenly. "We came through here a month ago and have kept
to the high-road. At Sisteron I had my orders to arrest the
<i>ci-devant</i> Frontenacs. You, Citizen Chauvelin, must know how
conscientiously I did my duty. All the orders you gave me I
fulfilled. After Sisteron you ordered me to go to Laragne, and
thence to Serres. It was you ordered me to a halt at Laragne for
the night."</p>

<p>"All this is beside the point," one of the others broke in
roughly. "All we can gather from this confused tale is that all
traces of the English spies have completely vanished."</p>

<p>"For the moment," Chauvelin assented drily. "It is for
Lieutenant Godet to find those traces again."</p>

<p>He spoke now with extreme bitterness, and the glances which he
levelled at Godet were both hostile and threatening. It would be
curious to try and follow the mental processes which had given rise
to this hostility. Godet, after all said and done, had only failed
in the same manner as he himself, Chauvelin, had so often done. He
had been hoodwinked by a particularly astute and daring adventurer
who was an avowed enemy of France: and if being thus hoodwinked was
a crime against the State, then the powerful member of the
Committee of Public Safety and the humble lieutenant of infantry
were fellow-criminals. This, of course, Godet did not know. Not
yet: or he would not have been in such dread of this man with the
pale eyes and the talon-like hands. The others he did not fear
nearly so much. No doubt they too were cruel and vengeful these
days. Strike or the blow will fall on you, was the rule of every
man's conduct. Pochart and Danou took their cue from Chauvelin; his
was the master-mind, his the more ruthless nature, all they did was
to try and show their zeal by saying Amen to every suggestion,
every sarcasm, every accusation put forth by their colleague.</p>

<p>In fact the proceedings by now had developed into a kind of duel
between the accused and the principal judge; it was a duel made up
of acrimonious accusations on the one hand, and of defence that
weakened perceptibly as the accused became more and more confused
through ever-increasing terror. The other two only put in a word
here and there. They wished to know how the adventure had finally
come to an end.</p>

<p>"In a long, weary tramp to Orange," Godet replied; "weary beyond
what words can describe, footsore, hungry and thirsty we
tramped."</p>

<p>They had to cover three leagues. How they lived through it, they
none of them knew. At one or two villages which they encountered,
they obtained a little food, and some drink. For the space of a
league and a half, he, Godet, and two others got a lift in a
farmer's wagon. On the way they asked news of the English spies.
They had been seen marching merrily; but soon all traces of them
had vanished.</p>

<p>"Had I been the traitor you say I am, Citizen Chauvelin," Godet
said in the end, "would I have come into Orange with my tale? I
would have tried to run away and to hide. Made my way to Toulons,
what? and joined the army there. You would not have found me then;
months would have gone by before you heard of my adventure."</p>

<p>"You underestimate the power which is in my hands, citizen
lieutenant," was Chauvelin's curt comment. "Only one thing could
save you from the consequences of your treachery, and that was to
speak the truth and to redeem your crime."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then addressing his two colleagues, he
said with slow deliberation:</p>

<p>"We all agree, I think, that Citizen Lieutenant Godet has been
guilty of gross negligence, which to-day, when France is threatened
by traitors within as well as by her enemies on her frontier,
amounts to treason against the State. Silence!" he went on,
throwing a stern glance on Godet who had uttered a violent word of
protest. "Listen to what hope of indulgence it is in my power to
give you. The State against whom you have sinned will grant you the
chance of retrieving your crime. We will grant you full powers
under the new Law of the Suspect. You shall go into the highways
and the byways with full power to seize any man, woman or child,
whom you as much as vaguely suspect of complicity in this affair.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," Godet replied dully.</p>

<p>"The State," Pochart put in sagely, "would rather have the
English spies than your head, citizen lieutenant."</p>

<p>"The State will have Citizen Godet's head," Chauvelin rejoined
drily, "or the English spies. The choice rests with Citizen Godet
himself."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. The eyes of the soldier were fixed
upon the pale, determined face of his ruthless judge. He knew that
his life hung upon the decision uttered by those thin, bloodless
lips. He was in the grip of a white terror; his teeth were clenched
and his tongue clove, hard and dry, against the roof of his mouth.
He was terrified, and in his wildly beating heart there was an
immense hatred for the man who thus terrorized him. He longed to
get at him, to grip him by the throat, to scream out insults into
that pale, stern, colourless face. He longed to see that same fear
of death which was paralysing him, dim the light of those pale
eyes. His own impotence made that hatred more intense. It shone out
of his eyes, and Chauvelin meeting them caught the glance like that
of an enraged cur, ready to spring. Indifferent, he shrugged his
shoulders and the ghost of a sneer curled round his thin lips. He
was accustomed to hatred and desire for revenge.</p>

<p>"Citizen lieutenant," he said at last, "you have heard the
decision of the committee. It has been found expedient to withhold
punishment from you, because it is in your power to serve the State
in a way that no other man could do at this moment. You have seen
the English spies face to face; you know something of their
appearance, something of their mode of speech. Go then into the
highways and byways, the men who with you were guilty of negligence
shall go with you. It is for you to use the full powers which the
Law of the Suspect has placed in your hands. Go scour the country.
Yours is the power to seize any man, woman or child whom you
suspect of treason to the State, make use of that power in order to
track down to their lair the English foxes who have outwitted you.
Only let me add a word of warning in your ear. Do not be led by the
nose a second time. If you are, no power on earth will save you.
The State may forgive incompetence once: the second time it will
bear the ugly name of treason."</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet, and just for a moment the muscles of
his hand relaxed, and the scrap of paper which he had crushed into
a ball rolled upon the table.</p>

<p>His colleague Pochart picked it up and idly opened and smoothed
it out: he studied for a moment or two the close writing upon it,
then looking inquiringly up at Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us what is written on this paper, citizen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>And while he spoke he tossed the paper across to his colleague
Danou.</p>

<p>"Is it English?" Danou asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes," Chauvelin replied curtly.</p>

<p>"It looks like poetry," Pochart remarked.</p>

<p>"Doggerel verses," commented Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"And you can't read it?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"I thought you knew English."</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Strange why a bit of doggerel verse should have been slipped
into the pocket of Citizen Godet's tunic," Pochart remarked drily.
"And there's your name, Citizen Chauvelin," he added, pointing to
the words "à mon ami Chauvelin," which preceded the four lines of
poetry written in English, a language which, apparently, no one
here understood.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin was at the end of his patience. He seized the
scrap of paper and tore it savagely into innumberable little
pieces.</p>

<p>"Enough of this futility," he said, and brought his clenched
fist down with a crash on the table. "The English spies have been
facetious, that is all. We do them too much honour by attaching
importance to this senseless, childish verse. Lieutenant Godet," he
went on, once more addressing the accused, "you are dismissed,
under the conditions I told you of just now. When next we meet face
to face, you will either be the lucky man who has helped to lay
these impudent English adventurers by the heel, or you will stand
before me arraigned for treason and preparing for death. Now you
can go."</p>

<p>Without another word Godet turned on his heel and went out of
the room. Past the guard at the door, he went with head erect, and
with a firm step he walked the whole length of the corridor. But
there was one moment when in the vestibule he found himself alone.
Unwatched. At any rate he thought so. So he paused and looked over
his shoulder in the direction of the room where he had just spent
an uncomfortable two hours. He paused and raising his fist, he
shook it at the unseen presence of the man who had so terrorized
him, and whom he hated because of the terror which he inspired.</p>

<p>"With a bit of luck," he muttered through his teeth, "we shall
be even yet, you and I, mon ami Chauvelin."</p>

<p>Then once more with a firm step he walked out of the Town
Hall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>It was on the following day that the <i>coche</i> from Sisteron
was due to arrive at Orange, and Lieutenant Godet, his mind set on
the one purpose, to find a clue to his mysterious adventure with
the English spies, hied him to the posting-inn which is situated in
the Rue de la République.</p>

<p>At noon the <i>coche</i>, covered with dust, unloaded its
wearied passengers; a farmer and his son come to negotiate a sale
of stock; the wife of Citizen Henriot, the lawyer, home from her
annual visit to her mother; two or three skilled artisans from the
country, come to seek their fortune in town, and so on; and finally
there descended from the <i>coche</i> two women, one of whom
carried a small bundle, while the other&mdash;well! at sight of the
other Citizen Lieutenant Godet uttered such a cry of surprise and
of excitement that the crowd around him thought that here was a
poor soldier who had taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>The woman who had caused Lieutenant Godet thus to lose his
self-control, was a perfectly self-possessed young woman wrapped in
a cloak and hood from beneath which peeped strands of golden curls
that vied in colour with the ripe corn of the Dauphiné, and eyes
bluer than the sky that spread over Orange on this exquisite midday
in May. The older woman who accompanied her appeared
travel-stained, weary and cross; not so this beautiful girl, who
tripped lightly from the <i>coche</i> towards the parlour of the
posting-inn and with a little air of triumph and encouragement
called gaily to her companion:</p>

<p>"The end of our journey, my Louise! And now to find Bibi!"</p>

<p>Even in these days of advanced democracy which in Orange had of
late reached its apogee, the shattering of ancient manners and
customs had not got to the stage where a beautiful woman would not
command the attention and services of impressionable males, to the
exclusion of others less favoured. And thus it came to pass that
while the other weary and travel-stained passengers were left to
look after themselves and their bits of luggage, and to wait their
turn until such time as the servants of the inn were pleased to get
them refreshments, the landlord himself, a florid man in shirt
sleeves and baize apron, bustled obsequiously around Fleurette and
Louise, offering wine bread and advice, polishing the chairs on
which they were invited to sit, and generally placing himself and
his house at the disposal of this attractive customer.</p>

<p>Fleurette took all these attentions as a matter of course. She
was accustomed to being the centre of attraction at Lou Mas or in
the house of M'sieu' and Ma'ame Colombe, and although her trust in
the good-will of men had received one or two somewhat rude shocks
of late, she still retained that self-possession and gentle air of
mingled modesty and graciousness which is the attribute of every
pretty, unspoilt woman. She asked for a room where she and her
companion might tidy their kerchiefs and caps, and use their
precious piece of scented soap, and she felt so triumphant and so
elated that when she found herself in the privacy of that room she
took poor old Louise by the waist and twirled her round and around
in a mad dance.</p>

<p>"We are in Orange, Louise darling!" she cried. "We are here!
here! here! and in less than an hour we shall have found Bibi will
have commanded Amédé to be set free! Just think of it, Louise," she
went on more seriously, "four whole days since he was arrested!
Poor, poor Amédé, under a horrible accusation of a sin which he
never committed! What he must have suffered! What he must have
thought of me who knew the truth and did not at once set to work to
obtain his freedom..."</p>

<p>Gradually her tone became more and more dull, all the excitement
died out of it. She saw Amédé in prison, with irons round his
wrists and ankles, or else standing before stern judges who
condemned him to a terrible punishment, because he held his tongue,
and would not accuse the real delinquent, who was none other than
she, Fleurette. She sighed, and her eyes now were full of tears,
while old Louise, stolidly, and with much grumbling, got some water
and proceeded to wash her face and hands and to tidy her dress.</p>

<p>"Come, child," she said drily after a while, "we'll go down now
and get something to eat."</p>

<p>She had never ceased to protest against the madness of this
adventure, prophesying every kind of calamity for them both: but
Fleurette with the quiet obstinacy of the habitually meek had
persisted. She had begun by wheedling the money out of Louise, then
obtained the passes for places in the <i>coche</i>. Once on the
way, it would of course have been ridiculous to turn tail and go
back, and Louise, led unconsciously by a force of will stronger
than her own, had found herself meekly acquiescing in all the
arrangements which Fleurette made on the way. As a matter of fact
she had not ceased to marvel at the child. Here was this young
thing, who had never travelled in a <i>coche</i> before, who had
never in her life been further than Serres and Sisteron, calmly
undertaking a three days' journey, sleeping and eating in strange
inns, and arriving at her destination unscathed. There certainly
was a miracle in all this good luck, for old Louise had heard many
a tale of what terrible adventures usually befell unprotected
females upon the high-roads. What she did not realize was that the
miracle merely consisted in the fact that in these outlying corners
of beautiful France, in Dauphiné and in Provence, there was still
plenty of the good old kindly stock left, some of the chivalry, the
warmth of heart, the bonhomie, which all the tyranny and the
cruelty perpetrated in the great cities had not contrived to kill;
and that there was something in Fleurette's beauty, her simplicity
as well as her determination, which brought forth that chivalry and
bonhomie and helped her to win through.</p>

<p>When the two women returned to the parlour, where hot milk and
country bread awaited them, they were met by a young soldier, who
very politely and deferentially claimed acquaintance with them.</p>

<p>"You would not remember me, citizeness," he said, more
particularly addressing Fleurette, "but I and some very weary
soldiers under my command are deeply indebted to you for your
kindness to us, when, like a good Samaritan, you gave us food and
drink, on the bridge near your home. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>He looked very bedraggled and out-at-elbows, but frank and kind.
Fleurette raised shy, blue eyes up at his, and gave a little gasp
of recognition. She well remembered the soldier. She remembered how
sorry she had been for them all, in their shabby clothes and
stockingless feet, weary and thirsty, and how she had sent Adèle
out to them with food and drink. She also remembered, though she
would not remind him of that, that he had been very curt and
uncivil with her, had made a sneering remark when she told him that
she was Citizen Armand's daughter, and also that the men under his
command had been positively cruel to a poor inoffensive old man
whom she afterwards befriended.</p>

<p>However, for the moment, she was perhaps conscious of a slight
feeling of relief at sight of a familiar face; she had seen nothing
but strangers ever since she left Laragne four days ago. So when
the soldier, still speaking quite deferentially, reiterated his:
"Do you remember?" she replied simply: "Of course I do, citizen
lieutenant." Which goes to prove that Fleurette had learned a great
deal in the past three days, and the word "citizen" now came quite
glibly to her tongue.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Godet had told her his name, told her that he was a
native of Orange and was home on leave for a few days.</p>

<p>"A real piece of luck," he went on lightly, "seeing that perhaps
I might be of service to you."</p>

<p>The two women sat down at the table and he helped to wait on
them, brought them bread and cheese and a jug of hot milk, and
bustled the maid of the inn if the latter appeared to Louise,
talked of his own journey, and inquired after her adventures.
Louise, despite her innate suspicion of soldiers, gradually unbent
to him. The warm food further put her into a good temper, and
presently the three of them were conversing in the most amicable
manner.</p>

<p>When the meal had been duly paid for, the soldier once more
offered his services. Could he pilot the citizenesses through the
town?</p>

<p>"Well yes, you can," Louise said resolutely, "we want to find
M'sieu' Armand."</p>

<p>"Citizen Armand," Fleurette broke in, "my father. I think you
know him, citizen lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Know him?" he exclaimed, "of course I know Armand. Who does not
know Citizen Armand in Orange?"</p>

<p>"Then he is here now?" Fleurette cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of a surety he is."</p>

<p>"You know where he lodges?"</p>

<p>"Every one in Orange knows where Citizen Armand lodges."</p>

<p>"Then you can take me to him?"</p>

<p>"At your service, citizeness."</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"When you wish."</p>

<p>With a little cry of delight Fleurette gathered up her
cloak.</p>

<p>"Let us go," she said simply.</p>

<p>Louise sighing, but stolid, followed meekly. The thought that
she would soon relinquish her wayward charge into the keeping of
M'sieu' Armand was a comforting one; Fleurette was tripping it
gaily beside the soldier, but the latter's dirty clothes and
bedraggled appearance still filled old Louise with mistrust.</p>

<p>They crossed the river by the old bridge and then trudged along
the dusty streets to a great open place, now called Place de la
République. The soldier led the way across the square to a tall
stone building, flanked by a square tower, to which a flight of
steps gave access. He seemed to know his way about. At the top of
the steps a couple of soldiers in somewhat tidier uniforms than his
own, were on guard. They stood in what Louise, who had
old-fashioned notions as to the behaviour of soldiers on duty, put
down as a slouchy and disrespectful attitude. When Lieutenant Godet
walked past them they did not salute. This want of respect of the
soldier for his officer was another manifestation, it seems, of
Equality and Fraternity. Louise, with her nose in the air, sailed
past in the wake of Godet and Fleurette.</p>

<p>After crossing a wide vestibule and turning on the right into a
long paved corridor, Lieutenant Godet came to a halt before a door
which bore the legend: "Committee of Public Safety, Section III."
Beside the door another soldier, also in very shabby uniform, stood
leaning upon his bayonet. Fleurette, overawed by the vastness and
silence of the place, gazed with vague terror at this man who
without uttering a word had put his bayonet athwart the door and
held it there, barring the way, motionless as a statue. Lieutenant
Godet then spoke to him:</p>

<p>"The citizeness," he said, "is the daughter of Citizen
Chauvelin. She desires to speak with him!"</p>

<p>The daughter of Citizen Chauvelin? What did the man mean?
Fleurette, puzzled and frowning, pulled him by the sleeve. She was
the daughter of Citizen Armand: she'd never heard the name of
Chauvelin before. Nevertheless the soldier on guard lowered his
bayonet. Godet pushed open the door and the next moment Fleurette
found herself facing a large desk which was covered with papers,
and behind which Bibi was sitting, writing. A voice said
loudly:</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin, here's your daughter come to see you."</p>

<p>Whereupon Bibi raised his head and looked at her, staring as if
he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>Forgetting everything save the joy of seeing chéri Bibi at last,
Fleurette gave a glad little cry, ran round the table, and came to
halt on her knees beside Bibi's chair, with her arms round his
neck.</p>

<p>She felt so glad, so glad that she was ready to cry.</p>

<p>"Bibi," she said softly, whispering in his ear, "chéri Bibi, are
you not glad to see me?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>At sight of Fleurette, Chauvelin had stared as if he had seen a
ghost. He did not trust his eyes: they were obviously playing him a
trick. It was only a second or two later that he realized it was
indeed the child, come, Heaven only knew why or how, but here in
this awful city where treachery, hatred and cruelty were holding
sway under his own command.</p>

<p>Half-dazed, he yielded to the caresses of this one being the
whole wide world whom his tigerish heart had ever loved. His arms
closed round her beloved form, whose sweet breath as of thyme and
violets filled his soul with joy. Then, looking up, he saw Louise
standing there: silent, stolid, mutely accusing, and he asked
roughly:</p>

<p>"How the hell did you both get here?"</p>

<p>Louise shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"By the <i>coche</i>," she said, "from Sisteron."</p>

<p>"I know," he rejoined. "But why did you come?"</p>

<p>"Ask her," Louise replied curtly. "She would come. I could not
let her travel alone."</p>

<p>Bibi's two hands were clasped round Fleurette's head, his
fingers were buried in her hair: he pressed that dearly-beloved
head closer and closer to his breast; joy at sight of her had
already given place to terror. What was the child doing here? How
and why had she come? He had kept her so completely aloof from real
life, that it seemed to him that some awful cataclysm must have
occurred over in that peaceful home in Dauphiné, else she were not
here.</p>

<p>His pale, restless eyes searched Louise's impassive face:</p>

<p>"Who brought you here?" he reiterated roughly.</p>

<p>"An officer in a draggle-tailed uniform," Louise replied, still
speaking curtly, whilst with a glance that was distinctly hostile
her eyes swept round the room. "I thought," she added, "that he
followed us into the room."</p>

<p>"What was he like?"</p>

<p>She described him as closely as she could, and then added: "I
don't remember his name."</p>

<p>She too had heard the name "Chauvelin" spoken by the soldier and
for a moment had pondered. Marvelled. In her downright peasant mind
vague doubts, doubts that were eighteen years old now, turned to
more definite suspicions. She knew well enough that some kind of
mystery hung around the personality of Fleurette's father; she knew
for instance that he was really a wealthy and high-born gentleman;
but eighteen years ago, in the days of the old régime, the fact
that a high-born gentleman chose to hide a love-romance from the
eyes of his equally high-born friends was not an infrequent
occurrence. If at any time during the past eighteen years she had
learned that M'sieu' Armand was really a great Duke or Prince or
Ambassador, she would have been neither surprised nor suspicious.
But Chauvelin!!! For the past three years whenever rumours of
cruelty or ruthless persecution of innocent men and women had
penetrated to these distant corners of Dauphiné or Provence, the
name of Armand Chauvelin had stood out as the protagonist of these
terrible tragedies; people spoke of Danton the lion of the
revolution, and also of Marat its tiger, of Robespierre and of
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>Chauvelin!!!</p>

<p>And he, meeting her glance, understood what went on in her mind.
As to this he was indifferent. What Louise thought of him was less
than nothing. It was the child that mattered now: the child who
clung to him quivering with excitement. The terror in his heart
grew in intensity: it gripped him till he felt physically sick. The
mad dogs of hatred and cruelty, which he himself had helped to
unchain, seemed to be snarling at him and threatening his
Fleurette. With a hand that trembled visibly, he stroked the pretty
golden hair.</p>

<p>"Now, little one," he said, steadying his voice as much as he
could, "are you going to tell me why you've come?"</p>

<p>Fleurette struggled to her feet. Self-possessed she stood before
her father and said firmly:</p>

<p>"Chéri Bibi, I came in order to right a great wrong. I believe
that you are strong and powerful and that you will help me to see
justice done. That is why I came to you."</p>

<p>He frowned, more puzzled than before, angered with himself for
being so dull-witted, for not making a guess at what had brought
the child along. His mind just before she came had been so
completely absorbed in the latest adventure of his arch-enemy the
Scarlet Pimpernel, that the presence of Fleurette, here and now,
had been for him like a sudden stunning blow on the head. He felt
dazed and stupid: unable to turn his thoughts into this fresh
channel.</p>

<p>"Fleurette, my darling," he pleaded, "try and tell me more
clearly. I don't understand. What do you mean by righting a wrong?
What wrong?"</p>

<p>"Why," she replied simply, "the arrest of M'sieu' Amédé for a
crime which he did not commit.</p>

<p>"You knew M'sieu' Amédé had been arrested?" she insisted.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew that. The mock arrest of young Colombe was one of
the tricks played on that fool Godet by those impudent English
spies. But what had Fleurette's presence here to do with that?</p>

<p>She was trying to explain.</p>

<p>"Then you know, chéri Bibi," she was saying in that sweet, eager
way of hers, "that some valuables belonging to Madame over at the
château were found in the shed behind M'sieu' Colombe's shop?"</p>

<p>Yes, he knew that too. But what had she...?</p>

<p>"And that the soldiers accused M'sieu' Amédé of having stolen
them?"</p>

<p>A sigh of relief escaped him. He was beginning to understand.
Nothing to worry about apparently. Indeed he might have guessed.
The child had come to plead for that young fool Amédé,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what I had come to tell you, chéri Bibi," she went on
glibly, "is that it is not Amédé who stole the things belonging to
Madame."</p>

<p>She paused for a second or two. What she was about to say
required courage: and how Bibi would take it she did not know. But
Fleurette had come all the way from Lou Mas, had journeyed three
days, so that Bibi might right a great wrong, as only he could do,
and, once more sinking on her knees beside her father's chair, she
added in a clear voice, rendered somewhat shrill with
excitement:</p>

<p>"I stole the valuables out of Madame's room, chéri Bibi."</p>

<p>With a hoarse cry he clapped his hand against her mouth. My God,
if some one had heard! The guard outside, or one of these
innumerable spies whom he himself had set in motion, and whose ears
were trained to penetrate through the most solid walls.</p>

<p>His pale eyes in which now lurked a kind of vague terror,
wandered furtively round the room, whilst Louise, equally horrified
and frightened, exclaimed almost involuntarily:</p>

<p>"The child is mad, M'sieu', do not listen to her."</p>

<p>Fleurette alone remained self-possessed: she was still on her
knees, but at Bibi's rough gesture she had fallen back, steadying
herself with one hand against the floor. Slowly, noiselessly,
Chauvelin had risen and tiptoed across the room, Louise, wide-eyed
and scared, following his every movement. They were furtive like
those of a cat on the prowl, and his face was the colour of ashes.
He went to the door and abruptly pulled it open. Outside the
soldier on guard was quietly chatting with Lieutenant Godet; at
sight of Citizen Chauvelin they stood at attention and saluted.</p>

<p>"Go and tell Captain Moisson over at the barracks," Chauvelin
said curtly, addressing Godet, "that I shall want to see him here
at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Very good, citizen."</p>

<p>Godet saluted again and turned on his heel. Chauvelin looked at
him closely, but his face was expressionless. He watched him for a
moment or two, as he, Godet, strode along the corridor. Then he
closed the door and went back to his seat behind the table.</p>

<p>He had made an almost superhuman effort to regain his composure.
He wanted to hear more, and did not want to scare the child. The
sight of Godet standing outside the door talking to the man on
guard, had made him physically sick, raised that same terror in his
heart which his presence and his glance were wont to raise in
others. The expression of his face must at one moment have been
absolutely terrifying for Fleurette could hardly bear to look at
him; but when he sat down again his face was just like a mask,
waxen and grey. He turned to her, and rested his elbow on the
table, shading his eyes with his long, thin hand. And Fleurette
felt how dreadful it must be for him to think that his daughter was
a thief.</p>

<p>So before he had time to ask her any questions she embarked on
glib explanations.</p>

<p>"You must not think, chéri Bibi," she said, "that I stole those
things for a bad motive. I did it because&mdash;"</p>

<p>She checked herself, and went on after a second or two:</p>

<p>"You remember, chéri Bibi, that evening at the château when we
met, you and I, by the stable door?"</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered. "But speak softly, child! these walls have
ears!"</p>

<p>"I had taken the things out of Madame's room then," Fleurette
continued, speaking in an agitated whisper, "and hidden them under
my shawl." She gave a nervous little laugh: "Oh! I was terrified, I
can tell you," she said, "that you would notice."</p>

<p>He had his nerves under control by now. His mind, keen, active,
was concentrated on her story, his indomitable will was slowly
mastering his terror. What had he to fear? Godet was out of the
way, and the child's whispers could not be heard outside these four
walls. If only that fool Louise did not look so scared: the sight
of her face, open-mouthed and with big, round eyes, got on his
nerves. He tried not to look her way. While his glance was fixed on
Fleurette he felt that he could think of her, scheme for her and
above all protect her&mdash;he, so important in the councils of
State. So powerful. He could shield her even against the
consequences of her own folly.</p>

<p>Of course, he must make light of the whole affair. Oh! above all
make light of it. The child was silly, wilful and ignorant, but he
would know how to protect her, and how to make her hold her tongue.
Louise was a fool, but she was safe and these walls were solid,
there was really no cause for this insane terror which had turned
him giddy and faint, and at first paralysed his brain.</p>

<p>So he forced his quaking voice into tones of gentle banter,
forced himself to smile, to tweak her cheek and to look gaily,
almost incredulously into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Allons, allons," he said lightly, "what story is this? My
little Fleurette taking things that belong to others? I won't
believe it."</p>

<p>"Only pour le bon motif, chéri Bibi," she insisted; "because you
see the soldiers were at the château, and they were ruining and
stealing everything they could lay their hands on...And also
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more she checked herself, loath to give away that one
cherished little secret: The mysterious voice at which perhaps Bibi
would scoff. But she did tell Bibi how with the precious burden
under her shawl she had hurried homewards until, fearing that she
would be overtaken by the soldiers on the road, she had sought
refuge in the widow Tronchet's cottage. She told him how she had
watched him riding past, heading towards Lou Mas, and how she had
become scared lest, if he spent the night at home, he would find
out what it was that she was keeping so carefully hidden underneath
her shawl.</p>

<p>And then she told him how she had thought of M'sieu' Amédé and
has asked Adèle to tell him to meet her outside the widow's
cottage, and how she had entrusted him with the precious treasure
and he had undertaken to hide it in the shed outside his father's
shop. But how it came to pass that those other soldiers, who were
as magnificently dressed as anything Fleurette had seen in all her
life, how they had come to suspect M'sieu' Amédé of the theft, she
could not conjecture. All she knew was that M'sieu' Amédé was
innocent and that he must be proclaimed innocent at once. At
once.</p>

<p>"I stole the things, Bibi," she concluded, "not for a bad
motive, I swear, but I did steal them and gave them to M'sieu'
Amédé to keep. If anyone is to be punished, then it must be I, not
he."</p>

<p>She was sitting on her heels, and looking up boldly, and with a
little wilful air at her father. Her dear little hands were resting
on her knees. She looked adorable. Chauvelin mutely put out his
arms and she snuggled into them, pressing her cheek against his
breast with a nervous little gesture, twiddling one of the buttons
of his coat.</p>

<p>Old Louise, sitting at the far end of the room, had listened,
open-mouthed, wide-eyed, to the tale. Her furrowed face was a
mirror of all the different expressions with which Chauvelin
regarded her from time to time. Terror and slow reassurance. "If
that is all, then I can deal with it!" he seemed to be telling her
now, when it was all over, and he knew the worst. He held the child
very close to him, and there was a certain nervous terror still
lurking in his eyes as he buried his face in the soft waves of her
hair.</p>

<p>"Bibi chéri," Fleurette insisted, "I must find those who are
going to sit in judgement on M'sieu' Amédé. And you will help me
find them, won't you? I must tell them the truth. Mustn't I?"</p>

<p>"You shall, child, you shall," he babbled incoherently. He was
trying to steady his voice, so as not to let her know how scared he
had been.</p>

<p>"When Adèle told us the next morning about the soldiers having
found Madame's valuables and arrested M'sieu' Amédé, I knew at once
that you would help me to put everything right. So Louise and I
just started then and there, as I thought we would find you in
Sisteron."</p>

<p>"The child told me nothing," Louise protested in answer to a
mute challenge from Chauvelin. "I only thought she wanted to see
you in order to plead for young Colombe."</p>

<p>"There is no need," he said steadily, "for me or anyone to plead
for him. Amédé Colombe is a free man at this hour."</p>

<p>Fleurette's little cry of rapture gave him a short, sharp pang
of jealousy.</p>

<p>"Do you love him so much as all that, little one?" he asked
almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>She blushed, and without replying hung her head. For a second or
two he debated within himself whether he would tell her the whole
truth, then came to the conclusion that on the whole it would be
best that she should know. Doubtless she would hear the story,
anyhow, from others and so he told it her just as he had had it the
day before from Lieutenant Godet. The magnificent soldiers who had
come that morning into Larange were not real soldiers of the
revolutionary army, they were a band of English spies whose chief
was known throughout France as the Scarlet Pimpernel: a cynical,
impudent adventurer whose business it was to incite French men and
women to desert their country in the hour of her greatest need, and
who doubtless would incite Amédé Colombe to treachery and
desertion. It was that chief, no doubt, who had spied on Fleurette
and seen her that night hand over Madame's valuables to Amédé
Colombe. He had taken this means of obtaining possession of the
valuables, as well as of the persons of the <i>ci-devant</i>
Frontenac and Amédé. Both men and money he would use against
France, for the English were great enemies of this glorious
revolution, the friends of all the aristos and tyrants whom the
people were determined to wipe off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Wide-eyed and dumb, Fleurette listened to him. After the first
moment of intense joy, when she heard that Amédé was safe, there
had come a sense of exultation that the mysterious voice which had
urged her to find Madame's valuables had spoken with a purpose and
that that purpose was now accomplished. Monsieur, Madame and
Mademoiselle had all been saved by what she believed was a
supernatural agency&mdash;whatever Bibi might say. No man who was
a mere spy and an enemy of France could have accomplished all that
this mysterious being had done, from the moment when disguised as a
faggot-carrier he had commanded her to look after Madame's
valuables, until the hour when clad in a magnificent uniform,
daring and fearless, he had found such glorious means of saving
Amédé and M'sieu de Frontenac too, from prison and perhaps
death.</p>

<p>And after the joy and the exultation there had crept into
Fleurette's heart a feeling of awe and dread for the father who
apparently she had never really known until this hour. She had only
known him as kind, indulgent, loving&mdash;loving in a kind of
fierce way at times, snarling like a wild cat if she thwarted
him&mdash;but always indulgent and always secretive. Now he seemed
to lay his soul bare before her. His love of France, of that
revolution which apparently he had helped to make. His hatred of
those whom he called traitors and enemies of France, the
aristocrats, the men who owned land and property, who had ancestors
and family pride, and then the English who were the real enemies,
who worked against the people, against democracy, and against
liberty, who had harboured every traitor that plotted against
France. Bibi hated them all and Fleurette felt awed and chilled
thus to hear him speak. He, who was so gentle with her always, now
spoke as if he approved of all the cruelty perpetrated against
those who did not think as he did, and whom he hated with such
passionate intensity.</p>

<p>Instinctively, and she hoped imperceptibly, she recoiled from
him when he once more tried to clasp her in his arms. This man with
the pale eyes and the cruel sneer was not the Bibi she loved. He
was just a man whom she feared. All she wanted now was to get away,
to get back to Lou Mas. Since Amédé was safe, why should she stay
any more in this awful place where even Bibi seemed like a
stranger?</p>

<p>Louise now was standing near her, and Bibi was giving Louise
some peremptory orders:</p>

<p>"You will go back now to the <i>Chat Noir</i>," he said, "the
inn where you were this morning. There you will wait quietly until
I come to fetch you. We will get on the way as early as we can, so
as to get to Vaison before dark."</p>

<p>"Vaison?" Louise asked, perplexed. "But the <i>coche</i>..."</p>

<p>"We are not travelling by the public <i>coche</i>," Bibi broke
in impatiently. "My private <i>calèche</i> will take us as far as
Lou Mas, and I'll not leave you till I've seen you safely
home."</p>

<p>"A <i>calèche</i>!" Louise exclaimed. "Holy Virgin!"</p>

<p>"Silence, woman," Bibi cried with an oath. "There is no Holy
Virgin now."</p>

<p>Well! of course, Bibi had said that sort of thing before now,
but never in such a rough, almost savage tone. Slowly Fleurette
struggled to her feet. All of a sudden she was feeling very, very
tired. For four whole days excitement and anxiety had kept her up;
but now excitement had died down and dull reaction had set in. A
sense of unreality came over her: the voice of Bibi giving all
sorts of instructions to Louise came to her muffled as if through a
thick veil. All that she knew&mdash;and this was
comforting&mdash;was that soon they would all be starting for home:
not in a crowded, jostling old <i>coche</i>, but in a
<i>calèche</i>. What a wonderful man Bibi was: so grand and
powerful and rich, that he had a <i>calèche</i> of his own and
could come and go as he pleased. She remembered how deferential the
soldiers had been to him that night at the château, and even now
her eyes fastened on the beautiful tricolour sash which he wore,
the visible sign of his influence and power.</p>

<p>When Bibi finally took her in his arms and kissed her as
affectionately, as tenderly as was his wont, she swayed a little
when he released her and the things in the room started to go round
and round before her eyes. Louise put her strong arm round her and
Fleurette heard her say: "Leave her to me, she'll be all right!"
She felt herself being led out of the room, past the sentry at the
door, and then along a corridor.</p>

<p>When she felt the soft, spring air strike her in the face she
felt revived, and walked steadily beside Louise as far as the
inn.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>Bibi's orders to Louise had been to go back to the inn and there
to wait until he came in his <i>calèche</i> to take them home to
Lous Mas. And the two women, ready for the journey home, so tired
that only excitement kept them from breaking down, waited for him
patiently in the parlour downstairs.</p>

<p>The travellers who had arrived in the early morning by the old
<i>coche</i>, had all disappeared by now, some had found
accommodation at the <i>Chat Noir</i>, others had gone to their
homes or to friends in the city; the hour for dinner was not yet,
and the personnel of the inn was busy in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The place was deserted and silent; the room itself hot and stuffy.
The air was heavy with the mingled odour of dust, stale grease and
boiled food. Up on the wall a large white-faced clock tricked with
noisy monotony, and against the small window-pane a lazy fly kept
up an intermittent buzz. Now and again from a remote part of the
house came the sound of a human voice or the barking of a dog, or
the rattling of pots and pans.</p>

<p>Louise, sitting in a large, old-fashioned armchair by the side
of the great hearth, had closed her eyes. The monotonous ticking of
the clock, the buzzing of the fly, the heat and the silence lulled
her to sleep. Fleurette, on a straight-backed chair, sat wide
awake, unable to keep her eyes closed even for a few minutes,
although they ached terribly and she was very, very tired. But
there was so much to keep her brain busy. In the past four days
more exiting events had been crowded into her life than in all the
eighteen years that lay behind her. And round and round they
went&mdash;these events&mdash;beginning with the first sight of the
squad of soldiers marching down the high road and coming to a halt
on the bridge, until the happy moment when Bibi had assured her
that M'sieu Amédé was safe and free, under the protection of that
mysterious personage whom Bibi called an impudent spy and enemy of
France but whom she, Fleurette, believed to be an agent of the
<i>bon Dieu</i> Himself.</p>

<p>It seemed a part of her confused thoughts, presently, when she
saw the door of the parlour slowly open and the kind soldier who
had conducted her to Bibi standing in the doorway. He cast a quick
glance all over the room, and as Fleurette was obviously on the
point of uttering a cry of surprise, he put up a warning finger to
his lips and then beckoned her to come. She rose, eager as well as
mystified, and once more he made a gesture of warning, pointing to
Louise and then raising a finger to his lips. A warning it was to
make no noise, and not to waken Louise. Fleurette tiptoed across
the room to him.</p>

<p>"Your father sent me round," he said in a whisper. He beckoned
her to come outside. She cast a last look at Louise who was
obviously peacefully asleep, and then slipped out past him into the
street.</p>

<p>"There is something your father forgot to say to you," the
soldier said as soon as he had closed the door behind Fleurette.
"But he told me not to bring the old woman along, and so as she was
asleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if she wakes and finds me gone&mdash;?" Fleurette rejoined,
and turned to go back to the inn. "I must just tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Immediately he seized hold of her hand.</p>

<p>"Your father," he said, "told me to bring you along as quickly
as I could. You know how impatient he is. It is but a step to the
Hôtel de Ville. We'll be there and back before the old woman
wakes."</p>

<p>No one knew better than Fleurette how impatient Bibi could be.
If he said anything, it had to be done at once. At once. So,
without further protest, she followed the kind soldier down the
narrow street. A few minutes later she was back in the Hôtel de
Ville, outside the door which bore the legend: "Committee of Public
Safety, Section III." The same soldier in the shabby uniform was
lounging, bayonet in hand, outside the door, but at sight of
Lieutenant Godet he stood up at attention and made no attempt this
time to bar the way. Godet pushed the door open and at a sign from
him Fleurette stepped into the room. Of course she expected to see
Bibi sitting as before behind the table, alone, busy writing.</p>

<p>Bibi certainly was there, she saw that at a glance, also that at
sight of her he jumped to his feet with an expression on his face,
far, far more terrible than when she had told him that it was she
who had stolen Madame's valuables. But Bibi was not alone. To right
and left of him two men were sitting dressed very much like he was
himself and wearing the same kind of tricolour sash round their
waist. There was a moment of tense silence while Fleurette, a
little scared, but not really frightened, stepped further into the
room. She could not take her eyes off Bibi, whose dear face had
become the colour of lead. He raised his hand and passed it across
his forehead. He seemed as if he wanted to speak, yet could not
articulate a sound. After a second or two he looked down first at
the man on his right, and then at the one on his left, then back
again at her, and over her head at Lieutenant Godet.</p>

<p>It was Fleurette who first broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" she said. "You sent for me?"</p>

<p>She did not call him Bibi just then; he seemed so very, very
unlike Bibi.</p>

<p>But all he said was:</p>

<p>"What&mdash;is the meaning of&mdash;of this?" and the words
seemed to come through his lips with a terrible effort.</p>

<p>"It means, Citizen Chauvelin, that I am trying to do my duty,
and redeeming my faults of negligence and incompetence, for which
you passed such severe strictures on me yesterday."</p>

<p>The voice was that of Lieutenant Godet. Fleurette could not see
him because he stood immediately behind her, but she recognized the
voice, even though it was no longer amiable and almost servile as
it had been earlier in the day. It had, in fact, the same tone in
it which Fleurette had so deeply resented that day upon the bridge
when first she had told him that she was Citizen Armand's
daughter.</p>

<p>"You ordered me," Godet went on deliberately, "to go into the
highways and the by-ways, and you gave me full power to arrest any
man, woman or child whom I suspected of connivance with the enemies
of France. This I have done. I have cause to suspect this woman of
such connivance, and in accordance with your instructions I have
brought her before you on a charge of treason."</p>

<p>Whereupon the man sitting on the right of Bibi nodded
approvingly and said:</p>

<p>"If indeed you have cause to suspect this woman, citizen
lieutenant, you did well to arrest her."</p>

<p>And the man on Bibi's left asked: "Who is this woman, citizen
lieutenant?"</p>

<p>Then only did Bibi appear to find his voice, and it came through
his lips just as if someone held him by the throat and were trying
to choke him before he had time to speak.</p>

<p>"My daughter," was all he said.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Fleurette did not understand that something
terrible had occurred, she could see well enough, but for the
moment the fact that she was in any way involved had not reached
her inner consciousness. She did not realize that when Lieutenant
Godet spoke of having arrested a woman, he was referring to her.
Thinking that she was probably in the way amongst these seriously
and busy men, she asked timidly:</p>

<p>"Shall I go, father?" whereat the man on the left gave a short,
dry laugh.</p>

<p>"Not just yet, citizeness," he said, "we shall have to ask you
one or two questions before we let you go."</p>

<p>"Citizen Pochart," Bibi now rejoined somewhat more steadily,
"there is obviously some grave error here on the part of the
citizen lieutenant and..."</p>

<p>"Grave error," Pochart broke in with a sneer. "We have heard
nothing in the way of witnesses or details of the accusation so
far, so why should you think there is an error, Citizen
Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>Fleurette could see the struggle on Bibi's face; she could see
the great drops of moisture on his face, the swollen veins upon his
temples; she saw his hands clenched one against the other, and how
he passed his tongue once or twice over his lips. "The citizen
lieutenant," he said with a marvellous assumption of calm, "has
shown too much zeal. My daughter is as good a patriot as I am
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Citizen Chauvelin?" the other man asked,
the one on the right of Bibi.</p>

<p>"Because she has led a modest and a sheltered life, Citizen
Danou," Bibi replied firmly. "Knowing nothing of town life, nothing
of intrigues or plots against the State."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," Pochart put in sententiously, "for any man
to know what goes on in a woman's head. The soundest patriot may
have a traitor for a wife&mdash;or else a daughter."</p>

<p>Bibi was obviously making a superhuman effort to control
himself. No one knew better than Fleurette how violent could be his
temper when he was thwarted, and here were these two men, not to
mention Lieutenant Godet, taunting and contradicting him, and she
could see the veins swelling upon his temples and his hands
clenched until the knuckles shone like polished ivory under the
skin.</p>

<p>"My daughter is not a traitor, Citizen Pochart," he said loudly
and firmly.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Godet says she is," Pochart retorted dryly.</p>

<p>"I challenge him to prove it."</p>

<p>"You forget, Citizen Chauvelin," Danou put in suavely, "that it
is not for the citizen lieutenant to prove this woman guilty;
rather it is for her to prove her innocence."</p>

<p>"The Law of the Suspect," Pochart added, "has been framed
expressly to meet such cases as these."</p>

<p>The Law of the Suspect! Ye gods! He himself, Chauvelin, had in
the National Assembly voted for its adoption.</p>

<p>"Are we not ordered instantly to arrest all persons who by their
actions, their speaking, their writing or their connections have
become suspect?" This from Danou who spoke slowly, unctuously,
without a trace of spite or anger in his voice. And Pochart, more
rough of tone, but equally conciliatory added:</p>

<p>"The Law tells us that if suspect of nothing else, a man, or a
woman, or even a child, may be 'suspect of being suspect'. Is that
not so, Citizen Chauvelin? Methinks you yourself had something to
do with the framing of that law."</p>

<p>"It was aimed at traitors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No! at the suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, ça, Citizen Chauvelin," here interposed Pochart with an
expressive oath, "are you by any chance on the side of the
traitors? What has the State to do with the fact that this woman is
your daughter? A patriot has no relatives these days. He is a son
of the State, a child of France, what? Her enemies are his enemies,
his hatred of traitors should override every other sentiment."</p>

<p>"A patriot has no sentiment," Danou echoed suavely.</p>

<p>Chauvelin now looked like an animal at bay. Caught in a net
turning round and round, wildly, impotently; seeking an egress and
only succeeding in getting more and more firmly enmeshed. But he
kept himself under control nevertheless. He felt the eyes of those
three men probing his soul. Exulting over his misery. Hatred all
around him. Cruelty. Godet openly hostile, vengeful, with a
grievance for his own humiliation; ready to hit back, to demand
humiliation for humiliation, and terror for terror. Revenge! My
God! who but a fiend could dream of such revenge. And the other
two; that fool Danou and that brute Pochart! No actual hostility
about them. Only envy: a mad desire to save their own skins, to
purchase notoriety, advancement at any price&mdash;even at the
price of innocent blood.</p>

<p>And as a wild beast turning and turning in the trap will pause
from time to time and glare out into the open, which means all its
life has stood for until now, so did Chauvelin, with soul enmeshed
in vengeance and envy, pause a moment in his mad struggle for
freedom. He paused and with wildly dilated eyes gazed upon a swift,
accusing vision of all the innocent blood he himself had helped to
shed. Those clenched hands of his, on which his gaze for one
instant rested, fascinated, how many times had they signed the
decree which had deprived a father of his son, a wife of her
husband, a lover of his mistress. And through the meshes that
tightened round him now, Chauvelin gazing into space saw before his
eyes the awful word "<i>Retribution</i>" written in letters of fire
and blood.</p>

<p>And seeing the writing on the wall, he felt an immense rage
against these men who dared to taunt him, who dared to hit at him,
through the one vulnerable spot in his armour of callousness and
cruelty. How dared they stand up to him, these miserable creatures
whose existence was of less account than that of a buzzing fly? And
throwing back his head he gazed upon them all, one after the other,
meeting their sneering glance with a bold challenge. How dared they
defy him? Him, Chauvelin? The trusted friend of Robespierre, one of
the makers of this glorious revolution; one of its most firm props?
Now a representative of the National Convention on special mission?
There stood the child, his daughter, his little Fleurette, silent,
wide-eyed, obviously not fully aware of the terrible position in
which she stood: and they dared to hit at her, to accuse her,
without rhyme or reason, just in order to hit at him through her.
It was Godet, of course, that vile, incompetent brute: savage and
cruel like the fool he was: vengeful for the bad half-hour he had
been made to spend in this very room. He must have heard something
of what the child had said. At one moment her sweet voice had risen
to shrill tones. Oh! what a senseless, mad confession! and he had
seized upon it so that he might hit back: have his revenge. But he
could prove nothing. It would be one man's word against another,
and he, Chauvelin, representative on special mission, with the ear
of all the great men up in Paris, would see to it, that his word
carried all the weight. He would deny everything, swear that Godet
lied. His was the power, he was more influential, more unscrupulous
than most.</p>

<p>If only the child held her tongue! She would if she was assured
that her Amédé was in no danger. How thankful he, Chauvelin, was
that he had told her the truth this morning. He couldn't bear to
look at her just at this moment, she looking so innocent, so
unconscious of danger, but nevertheless he tried to convey to her
with eyes and lips the warning to hold her tongue. Chauvelin had
been silent for quite a little while; the others thought they had
cowed him. In their hearts Pochart and Danou were not a little
afraid of him. A representative on special mission had unlimited
power and this Chauvelin was always a crouching beast, ready to
snarl and to spring, and they knew well enough how influential he
was. But here was a double chance to show their zeal, and to get
even with the man whom they had always feared. As for Godet, he had
obviously staked everything on this throw. His life was anyhow
forfeit; Chauvelin's threats yesterday had left him no loophole for
hope. But here was revenge to his hand, and at worst a powerful
lever wherewith to force his enemy's hand.</p>

<p>Chauvelin's mind had been so busily at work that for a while he
lost consciousness of these men. After his rage against them he
forgot their very presence. Nothing mattered&mdash;no
one&mdash;except the child, and his own power to save her. Through
that semi&mdash;consciousness he heard only vague words. Snatches
of phrases that passed rapidly between those two men and Godet.
"Proofs&mdash;" "Witnesses&mdash;" And then Danou's voice, soft and
unctuous as usual:</p>

<p>"Of course the more solid your proofs&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Pochart's, rough and determined:</p>

<p>"Why should we not hear that witness now?"</p>

<p>Godet replied lightly: "I have her here. Perhaps it would be
best."</p>

<p>It seemed as if they were determined to ignore him, Chauvelin;
to shut him out of their counsels. He was so silent, so
self-absorbed; they thought that he was cowed, and dared not raise
his voice in defence of his daughter. They were all alike these
men&mdash;these masters of France as they liked to be
called&mdash;overbearing, arrogant, always menacing, until you hit
back, when all the starch would go out of them, and they would
cringe, or else become surly and defiant like any aristo.</p>

<p>"Go and fetch your witness, citizen lieutenant," Pochart said in
the end.</p>

<p>Then Chauvelin woke, like a tiger out of his sleep.</p>

<p>"What?" he queried abruptly, "what is this?"</p>

<p>"A witness, citizen representative," came in unctuous tones from
Danou. "It will be more satisfactory in this case&mdash;the Law
does not demand witnesses&mdash;suspicion is
enough&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out of deference to your position, citizen," Pochart broke in
with a short laugh. "Go and fetch your witness, Citizen Godet," he
added dryly. Chauvelin brought his clenched fist down with a crash
on the table. "I'll not allow you&mdash;" he began in thundering
accents, and met Danou's sneering, inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>"Allow what, citizen representative?" Pochart asked roughly.</p>

<p>"Refuse to hear witnesses? On what grounds?" Danou put in, in
smooth, velvety accents.</p>

<p>Godet said nothing. It was not for him to speak; but he met
Chauvelin's' glance just then, and almost drained his cup of
revenge to its dreg.</p>

<p>"No one," now put in Pochart significantly, "has more respect
for family ties than I have. But I am first of all a patriot, and
then only a family man. I happen to be a single man, but if I were
married and discovered my wife to be a traitor to the State, and an
enemy of the people, I would with my own hand adjust the guillotine
which would end such a worthless and miserable life."</p>

<p>"Now you, Citizen Chauvelin," Danou said, taking up his
colleague's point, "are doing your daughter no good by trying to
shield her from punishment if she be guilty."</p>

<p>"You would not dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dare what, Citizen Chauvelin? Act up to the principles which
you yourself have helped to promulgate in France? Indeed we dare!
We dare strike at the enemies of the State whoever they may be.
That woman," he added, indicating Fleurette, "is suspect; the Law
of the Suspect gives our Committee power to arrest her. If she be
proved innocent, she shall go free. If she be guilty, you, by
defending her, cannot save her and do but condemn yourself."</p>

<p>And that was true! No one knew it better than Chauvelin, who but
a few weeks ago in Paris had helped Merlin and Douai to frame that
abominable Law. The heavy hand of Retribution was indeed upon him.
The voice of the innocent had cried out for Vengeance before the
Lord and Nemesis, hourglass in hand, had stalked him now at last.
All that was left him at this moment, out of all that arrogance
which had imposed his personality upon the masters of France, made
them forget his failures and fear him even in the hour of
humiliation, was just a shred of pride, which enabled him to hide
his misery and his despair behind a mask of impassiveness. He even
succeeded in hiding his hatred and contempt of these three curs who
were yapping at his heels. And when Pochart for the third time
reiterated his order to Godet to go and fetch his witness,
Chauvelin made no further protest. He rose from the table and went
round to where Fleurette was standing, silent, bewildered, with
great tears, like those of a frightened child, running down her
cheeks. He held his hands tightly clenched behind his back, to
prevent himself from seizing her in his arms and raining kisses
upon her golden hair, letting those sneering men see how terribly
he had been hit and how he suffered. Godet had gone out of the room
to fetch the witness&mdash;what witness? and the other two were
sitting at the table, whispering together. Chauvelin through
compressed lips murmured in Fleurette's ears:</p>

<p>"Try not to be frightened, little one! Don't let them see you
are frightened. They dare not do anything to you."</p>

<p>"I am not frightened, chéri Bibi," she replied, smiling at him
through her tears.</p>

<p>"And you will hold your tongue, Fleurette," he urged under his
breath, "about what you told me this morning. Swear to me that you
will."</p>

<p>"If M'sieu Amédé is safe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I swear to you on my soul, that we do not even know where he
is."</p>

<p>"In that case, Bibi chéri..."</p>

<p>Quick footsteps outside the door. A challenge from the man on
guard. The opening of the door. Then Godet's voice saying
loudly:</p>

<p>"The witness, citizens."</p>

<p>Chauvelin looked up and saw beside Godet a woman with a shawl
wrapped round her head; she came forward boldly, then threw back
her shawl. Chauvelin uttered a savage oath, whilst Fleurette gasped
in amazement:</p>

<p>"Adèle!" she cried.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>It seemed almost the worst moment of this awful day to see
Adèle&mdash;Adèle!&mdash;standing there, like some sly and furtive
rodent, snapping at the hand that had fed and tended it. The
lessons taught by all these makers of a revolution which was going
to be a millennium for the people, and inaugurate an era of
brotherly love, had been well learnt by all those who had nothing
to lose and everything to gain by venality, by treachery and the
blackest of ingratitude. And Chauvelin himself had been head master
in that school, where this wretched little bastard had learned how
to hate; she was the personification of that proletariat which he
had striven to exalt, of the low, mean mind that never tries to
rise and only strives to drag down others to the level of its own
crass ignorance. Adèle was only a product of that levelling process
which was going to make of mankind one great family, full of love
for one another, of pity for the weak and contempt of the strong,
and which had only succeeded in arousing a universal hatred in
every breast and envy of everything that was lofty and pure. The
levelling process according to its early
protagonists&mdash;idealists for the most part&mdash;was destined
to eliminate all tyranny and to protect those who were too weak to
protect themselves; but all it had succeeded in doing was to
substitute one tyranny for another; it had not levelled the
classes, made one man as good as another; what it had done was to
hurl down from his self-imposed altitude of nobility or of virtue
every man who was unwilling to step down of his own accord. It had
set every beggar on horseback who was a beggar by nature, and kept
him there by virtue of ruthlessness and of cruelty. None but a
fellow-beggar, more ruthless perhaps, and more cruel, could unseat
him. Death was the only real leveller, and this glorious revolution
had become a fraternity of death. The Republic of France must march
to Liberty over corpses, one of its makers had said, and another
added sententiously that no traitor failed to return; except the
dead. Terror reigned now everywhere, marching hand in hand with its
hand-maiden the guillotine.</p>

<p>The time was no longer far distant when this titanic battle
between all these beggars on horseback would reach its fiercest
struggle ere it ended in a gigantic cataclysm, and when the gorge
of all these tigers would rise at last in face of the daily
hecatombs which had made a graveyard of the fair lands of France.
But that time was not yet. Men like Chauvelin had seen visions of
Retribution like fiery Fata Morgana pointing to the inevitable
hour, but the Godets, the Danous, the Pocharts and the Adèles knew
not the signs of the times. They had learnt their lesson and were
applying it for their own advancement and above all for their own
safety, destroying all that was destructible, taking Earth and
Heaven to witness that they whose lives had been nought but misery
and hunger would henceforth sweep off the face of the earth all
those who had only known ease and comfort, who had practised
virtue, and never known despair.</p>

<p>And Adèle whose hatred of Fleurette had thriven all these years
as in a forcing-house, had learnt her lesson well. Fleurette to her
meant tyranny, the tyranny of riches over her poverty, of good food
over her empty stomach, of neat kirtle over her rags. Poverty and
Hunger had enchained her to Fleurette's wheel, had forced her to
wash dishes, to scrub floors, to sleep on a straw pallet. But now
her turn had come. Her very misery had put it in her power to drag
Fleurette down to her own level. She had imbibed the principles of
this glorious revolution until she felt herself to be one of its
prophets. She had spied on Fleurette and denounced her because she
had seen at last a way to satisfy her hatred and to lull her envy
to rest.</p>

<p>She had plenty to say when questioned by Pochart and Danou;
proud of the fact that for over two years now she had supplied the
Sisteron section of the Committee of Public Safety with information
about the district. She had known the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenacs
and it was&mdash;she was proud to state&mdash;chiefly owing to her
that they came to be suspected of treason. They used to turn one of
their rooms into a chapel on Sundays and a <i>ci-devant</i> priest,
who was not Constitutional, performed there rites and ceremonies
with wafer and cup which had long since been decreed treasonable
against the State. Adèle had been forced by the <i>ci-devant</i>
Frontenac women to be present at these treasonable practices; she
had even been made to scrub the floor of that temple of
superstition and to remove the dust from the so-called altar. Her
patriotic soul had risen in revolt and she had journeyed to
Sisteron one day when she was free and placed the matter before the
Committee of Public Safety who had commended her for her zeal.</p>

<p>"Adèle!" Fleurette exclaimed involuntarily. "How could you?
Indeed <i>le bon Dieu</i> will punish you for this."</p>

<p>At which remark everybody laughed&mdash;except Chauvelin, who
smothered a groan. Oh! the child! the senseless, foolish, adorable
child! She seemed wilfully to run her darling head into the noose.
Adèle turned a sneering glance on Fleurette.</p>

<p>"I'll chance a punishment from your <i>bon Dieu</i>," she said
flippantly, "for the joy of seeing you punished by the
Revolutionary Tribunal."</p>

<p>And strange to say Chauvelin did not strike her, though she
stood quite near him, with only the width of the table between her
and his avenging hand. But he did not strike her, even though his
muscles ached with the desire to strike her on the mouth. It was
pride that held him back. How those men would have laughed to see
him lose his self-control with this wench who was only emitting
principles that he indirectly had taught her. Retribution! Nemesis
at every turn.</p>

<p>And now Adèle embarked upon her main story. Her spying on
Fleurette. Long, long had she suspected her, with her airs of
virtue and bunches of forget-me-nots in front of a statue
representing a <i>ci-devant</i> saint. "Saint Antoine de Padoue
priez pour nous!" every time she placed a fresh bunch of flowers
before that statue. Bah! such superstition made a patriot's gorge
rise with disgust. But Adèle had said nothing. Not for a long time.
She knew that citizen Chauvelin&mdash;he was known as Armand over
at Laragne&mdash;was a great patriot and an intimate friend of
Citizen Robespierre over in Paris. So Adèle decided to bide her
time, and she did. Until that evening when at last the Frontenacs
were arrested and the château ransacked. That night Adèle had had
her suspicions aroused by Fleurette's strange airs of mystery, her
desire to meet Citizen Colombe alone on a dark night. Fleurette had
always been such a <i>Sainte Nitouche</i> that Adèle guessed that
something serious was in the wind.</p>

<p>Like a zealous patriot she had watched, and she had seen
Fleurette hand over a casket and a wallet to the young Colombe. She
had heard the two talk over the question of hiding these things in
a shed behind Citizen Colombe's shop, and finally seen them locked
in each other's arms, which confirmed her in the idea that
Fleurette, with all her appearances of virtue, was a woman guilty
of moral turpitude.</p>

<p>And still Chauvelin did not strike her on the mouth. He fell to
wondering what crime he had committed that was heinous enough to
deserve this punishment of impotence.</p>

<p>The others listened for the most part in silence. Only
occasionally did one or the other break into a chuckle. <i>Nom de
nom</i>, what an event! Representative Chauvelin! the man of almost
arrogant integrity, sent to Orange to spy and report on the
workings of the Committee of Public Safety, one of the makers of
the Terror, a man whose every glance was a menace, and every word a
threat of death! When Adèle had finished speaking, Pochart winked
across at Danou. Here was a find that would exalt them both, bring
their names to the notice of the great men over in Paris. All sorts
of possibilities of reward and advancement loomed largely before
them. And Pochart rubbed his large, coarse hands contentedly
together and Danou poured himself out a glass of water and drank it
down. All these possibilities had made him thirsty.</p>

<p>Fleurette too was silent. For the first time in her life she had
come in contact with human passions of which hitherto she had not
even dreamed. Adèle, the little maid of all work, with the coarse
hands, the red elbows and narrow rat-like face, who wore
Fleurette's cast-off clothes and worn-out shoes, had suddenly
become an un-understandable and terrifying enigma. Fleurette felt
as if she could not utter a sound, that any word of protest which
she might raise would choke her. The girl's words, her bitter
accusations, spoken in an even monotone, gave her a feeling as of
an icy-cold grip upon her heart. Surrounded from her cradle onwards
with love and care, this first glimpse of spite and hatred
paralysed her. Only when Adèle spoke of M'sieur Amédé and of that
kiss which had tokened him to Fleurette, that delicious kiss under
the almond-trees, only then did a hot blush rise to her cheeks, and
tears of shame gather in her eyes.</p>

<p>Beyond that she felt like an automaton, while these four
creatures who hated her and who hated Bibi were discussing her
fate. Bibi was strangely silent and motionless although from time
to time the others referred a question or two to him in which case
he replied in monosyllables. There was much talk of "detention" and
of "revolutionary tribunal." Of course Fleurette did not understand
what these meant. Since Bibi appeared so indifferent, she supposed
that nothing very serious was going to happen to her.</p>

<p>Presently Adèle and Godet were dismissed. Adèle swept past her
with her shawl once more over her head hiding the expression of her
face. Her eyes did not meet Fleurette's as she glided past like a
little rat seeking its burrow. Perhaps she was ashamed. Godet was
ordered to send two men along&mdash;they would be wanted to take
the citoyenne to the house of detention. Godet gave the salute and
followed Adèle out of the room.</p>

<p>Fleurette's feet were aching. She had been standing quite still
for over half an hour, and was longing to sit down. Bibi's eyes
were upon her now, and his long thin hands were fidgeting nervously
with a paper-knife. At one time he clutched it so tightly, and half
raised it, as if he meant to strike one or the other of his
colleagues. Fleurette tired and a little dizzy, only caught
snatches of their conversation. At one time Bibi said very
quietly:</p>

<p>"You are very bold, Citizen Danou, to measure your influence
against mine."</p>

<p>And the man on Bibi's left retorted very suavely:</p>

<p>"If I have transgressed, citizen representative, I'll answer for
it."</p>

<p>"You will," Bibi rejoined, and his words came through his thin,
compressed lips, harsh and dry like blows from a wooden mallet
against a metal plate. "And with your head, probably."</p>

<p>"Is that a threat, Citizen Chauvelin?" the other asked with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"You may take it so if you wish."</p>

<p>The man on Chauvelin's right, Citizen Pochart, had in the
meanwhile been writing assiduously on a large piece of paper. Now
he pushed the paper in front of Chauvelin and said curtly:</p>

<p>"Will you sign this, citizen representative"</p>

<p>"What is it?" Chauvelin asked.</p>

<p>"Order for the provisional arrest of one Fleur Chauvelin,
suspect of treasonable connections with the enemies of France,
pending her appearance before the Revolutionary Tribunal."</p>

<p>Chauvelin raised the paper and read it through carefully. His
hand that held the paper was perfectly steady.</p>

<p>"Your signature," Pochart went on, and held out the quill pen
invitingly toward Chauvelin, "as Representative of the National
Convention on special mission is necessary on this order."</p>

<p>"You may take that as a threat too, Citizen Chauvelin," Danou
added with a sly wink directed at his colleague Pochart, "for if
you do not sign, there's others that will, and sign one too that
will be even more unpleasant for you."</p>

<p>Chauvelin took the pen, and the two men, Pochart and Danou,
sprawling over the table, had the satisfaction of seeing him sign
the order for the arrest of his own child&mdash;her death probably.
Not the first time either that something of the sort had occurred,
that a man put his seal on the death-warrant of his kith or kin.
Had not Philippe d'Orléans voted for the death of his cousin the
King? Chauvelin signed with a steady hand, his lips tightly pressed
one against the other. They should not see, these fiends, what
torture he was enduring; they should not see that at this moment he
felt just like a brute beast writhing in agony. Not that he had
abandoned hope with regard to Fleurette. He felt confident that he
could turn the order into a mere scrap of paper presently, and see
those two snarling dogs fawning at his feet once more, kicked with
the toe of his boot and howling in vain for mercy.</p>

<p>It was only from humiliation that, conscious of his power, he
had decided that silence and outward acquiescence were his best
policy. He had certain cards up his sleeve which the others were not
aware of, but he could only play them if he succeeded in lulling them
into a sense of security by his obvious indifference. Fortunately
his reputation stood him in good stead. He was known by his enemies
to be so ruthless and so unscrupulous&mdash;such an ardent patriot,
declared his friends&mdash;that his indifference now where his own
daughter was concerned, did not even astonish Pochart and Danou. It
was just like Citizen Chauvelin to send his own daughter to the
guillotine. And this estimate of his character helped him to play
the rôle that would mean life to Fleurette.</p>

<p>So there he sat for a few minutes, perfectly impassive, his face
a mask, his hand perfectly steady, perusing the paper, and then
deliberately drawing his pen through one of the words and
substituting another.</p>

<p>"We'll say the house of Caristie," he said drily, "the other is
already full."</p>

<p>Pochart shrugged his shoulders. Why not concede this point? It
was so fine to have the citizen representative under one's thumb.
What matter if his daughter was thrust into one prison rather than
another?</p>

<p>"Is the guard there?" Danou asked. "We have plenty of business
to see to. This one has lasted quite long enough."</p>

<p>"There is still that report from Avignon to look through,"
Pochart added. "It will need your attention, citizen
representative."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in one moment," Chauvelin replied calmly.</p>

<p>He rose and went to the door. Opened it. Yes! there was the
guard sent hither by Godet, two men to escort his Fleurette to the
house of Caristie the architect, now transformed into a house of
detention. Chauvelin did not even wince at sight of them. He closed
the door quietly and then approached Fleurette. He took hold of her
hand and drew her to the furthest corner of the room, out of
earshot.</p>

<p>"You are not frightened, little one?" he whispered to her.</p>

<p>"No, Bibi chéri," she replied simply. "If you tell me not to
be."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be frightened at, Fleurette. These brutes
wish you ill; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why should they?"</p>

<p>"But I can protect you."</p>

<p>"I know you can, chéri Bibi."</p>

<p>"And you won't see that wretch Adèle again."</p>

<p>"I wonder why she hates me! I thought we were friends."</p>

<p>"There are no friends these days, little one," he said almost
involuntarily. "Only enemies or the indifferent&mdash;They are the
least dangerous."</p>

<p>"There are those whom we love."</p>

<p>"You are thinking of Amédé?"</p>

<p>"And of you, chéri Bibi."</p>

<p>"You believed me, didn't you, little one when I told you that
young Colombe is safely out of harm's way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I believed you."</p>

<p>"Then you will hold your tongue about&mdash;about what you
know?"</p>

<p>"I promise you, chéri Bibi. But I won't allow Amédé to suffer
for what I did," she added with that determined little air of hers,
which Chauvelin had learned to dread.</p>

<p>"He won't. He can't," he declared whilst an exclamation of
impatience at her obstinacy almost escaped him. "Have I not told
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are waiting, Citizen Chauvelin," Danou's unctuous voice
broke in at this point. "As you are near the door, perhaps you will
call the guard."</p>

<p>He did. And stood silently by, while Fleurette was ordered to
follow the men. She obeyed, after a last, smiling glance at Bibi.
No! she was not frightened; she felt sure that he could protect
her, and so long as M'sieur Amédé was safe&mdash;</p>

<p>The last words she said before she finally passed through the
door were:</p>

<p>"Poor old Louise! You'll tell her, won't you, Bibi, not to fret
for me? and tell her to send me my crochet work if she can. I shall
have plenty of time on my hands to get on with it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>At four o'clock that afternoon the President of the
Revolutionary Tribunal sitting at Orange received a summons to
accompany Citizen Chauvelin, Representative of the National
Convention on special mission, to Paris, there to present his last
reports of the cases tried by him since the beginning of the
year.</p>

<p>Public Prosecutor Isnard received the same summons; he hastened
all in a flurry to the Hôtel de Ville to find Citizen
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean, citizen?" he asked.</p>

<p>Chauvelin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know not," he replied. "The summons came by courier an hour
ago. I have my <i>calèche</i> here. We could start at daybreak
to-morrow and be in Valence before dark. The next day should see us
in Lyons, and the middle of next week in Paris."</p>

<p>"Can you not conjecture&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Once more Chauvelin shrugged.</p>

<p>"One never knows," he said. "There must have come some
denunciation. You and the President have your enemies, no doubt, as
every one else."</p>

<p>Public Prosecutor Isnard's flabby cheeks were the colour of
lead.</p>

<p>"I have always done my duty," he stammered.</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," Chauvelin responded lightly.</p>

<p>"You'll be able to justify yourself, I feel sure, citizen. But
you know what these summons are. Impossible to argue&mdash;or to
disobey."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. But the business here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"Our prisons are full. A batch of twenty at least should be
tried every day. I have forty or fifty indictments ready now and we
can keep the guillotine busy for at least a week. All that business
will be at a standstill."</p>

<p>"You will have to work twice as hard on your return, citizen,"
Chauvelin retorted drily.</p>

<p>The arrival of the President of the Tribunal put a temporary
stop to the colloquy. He too was flurried and not a little scared.
He knew about these summonses that would come from time to time
from Paris without any warning. They meant reprimands of a
certainty. Perhaps worse. One never knows with leaders of the
Government over there. One moment they would shout: "Strike!
Strike!" at the top of their voices, "let not the guillotine be
idle!" They would frame laws to expedite the extermination of all
the traitors and suspected traitors. The next, they would draw
back, accuse you of over-zeal, over-cruelty, what not? See how
Carrier had suffered! He had been sent to Nantes to purge the city
of aristos and bourgeois and calotins; he had done his best;
invented a new way of disposing of ninety priests all at once by
the mere unmooring of a flat-bottomed craft, laden with those
traitors, and on a given signal opening all the hatches and sinking
the whole craft with her cargo.</p>

<p>Well! Carrier had done that. He had effectually purged Nantes of
traitors. Nevertheless he was summoned to Paris, and his head
rolled into the basket on the Place de la République, just as if he
had been an aristo. Look at Danton, and at&mdash;but why recall it
all? Anyhow, what a week of desperate anxiety this would be until
Paris was reached. President Legrange had thoughts of flight, of
taking refuge in the mountains as others had done. But Public
Prosecutor Isnard dissuaded him. What was the good of running away?
One always got caught, and then it would of a certainty be the
guillotine. Chauvelin too was for immediate obedience.</p>

<p>"I too am summoned," he said. "We are all in the same boat. As
for the business here, it will have to wait until our return."</p>

<p>Public Prosecutor Isnard could not suppress a taunt.</p>

<p>"There's your daughter, Citizen Chauvelin," he said. "We were
going to make quick work of her. I had her indictment all ready. In
fact the chief witness&mdash;a wench who looks like an anaemic
rat&mdash;was in my study when your summons came."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Chauvelin said with perfect indifference.
"Well! all that can wait till our return."</p>

<p>After which he added lightly: "At daybreak, citizens, my
<i>calèche</i> will be ready outside the <i>Chat Noir</i>. I await
you then and advise you to eat a good breakfast. Our first stop
will be at Montélimar, where we can get relays. In the meanwhile I
bid you adieu. I still have much work to see to before the close of
day."</p>

<p>For the first time this day Chauvelin heaved a genuine sigh of
satisfaction when the two men had departed. His first manoeuvre had
succeeded admirably. With the President of the Tribunal and the
Public Prosecutor out of the way, the business of the State would
be at a standstill in Orange and he would have at least three weeks
of freedom before him in which to act. He had planned this summons,
and intended to accompany the two men as far as Lyons. There he
would find some pretext for sending them on their way without him,
whilst he returned in secret to Orange. That was his plan, a risky
one at best; but in less than three weeks he would either have
found a way of getting Fleurette out of the clutches of these
fiends, or he and she would both be dead. Strangely enough at this
moment he fell to wondering what his arch-enemy, the Scarlet
Pimpernel, would do under the circumstances and he longed for the
possession of that same imaginative brain, that marvellous resource
and unbounded pluck which had foiled him, Chauvelin, at every
turn.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel! If that bold adventurer were to know that
his bitterest foe was now probing the lowest depths of sorrow, that
this cruel Nemesis had overtaken him at last, how he would exult,
how jeer at his enemy. And of the many pin-pricks which Chauvelin
had had to endure to-day, he felt that none could hurt him so
deeply as the thought that the Scarlet Pimpernel might hear of his
trouble and hold jubilee over his soul agony.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>That first night the party slept at Valence in the Maison de
Têtes, the quaint old house with its unique façade which stands to
this day in the Grand' Rue, and which in that year of grace 1794
had been requisitioned by the Drôme section of the Committee of
Public Safety for its offices. A concierge with wife and family
were in charge of the house and there were two or three additional
rooms in it which were often placed at the disposal of any official
personage who happened to be passing through Valence. Chauvelin had
often stayed there on his way through to Paris and was a familiar
figure to the concierge and his family; there was no difficulty
whatever in finding accommodation for himself and his two friends
in the Maison des Têtes for the night. <i>Calèche</i> and horses,
together with driver and postilion, were put up in the stables at
the back of the house.</p>

<p>Night had overtaken the party when some five kilometres outside
Valence, and this last part of the way had to be done at walking
pace. Thus it was nearly ten o'clock before the <i>calèche</i> drew
up in the Grand' Rue outside the Maison des Têtes, and the
concierge, hurrying to greet the unexpected and important guest,
had regretfully to inform him that neither the President nor any of
the officials were here to welcome him as they had already gone to
their respective homes. But the rooms were there, quite ready, at
the disposal of Citizen Chauvelin and his friends, and supper would
be got immediately for them. The three travellers stepping out of
the <i>calèche</i> were more than thankful to find shelter and food
at this hour. Already at sunset the sky had been threatening; great
banks of cloud came rolling up from the south-west, driven by
tearing gusts of wind; by night-time a few heavy drops were
falling, presaging the coming storm. No sooner were the travellers
installed in the dining-hall in front of an excellent supper, than
the storm broke in all its fury. It was accompanied by torrential
rain and a tearing wind. Such wild weather during the month of May
was almost unparalleled in the valley of the Rhône, so the
concierge hastened to explain to the two strangers who accompanied
Chauvelin. The night was very dark too, the very weather in fact
for foot-pads and malefactors who, alas! infested the countryside
more than ever now.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" the man added with a shrug, "so many are
starving these days; they get their existence as best they can.
Honesty is no longer the best policy."</p>

<p>And then he caught Citizen Chauvelin's eye, and nervously
clearing his throat, began to talk of something else. It was not
prudent to grumble at anything, to make any remark that might be
constructed into criticism of the present tyrants of France.</p>

<p>Supper drew to an end, mostly in silence. Chauvelin was never of
a loquacious turn of mind, and neither of the other two were in a
mood to talk. After a curt good night the latter returned to the
room which had been assigned to them. Chauvelin before doing the
same gave orders to his driver and postilion to have the
<i>calèche</i> at the door by seven o'clock on the following
morning. Then he too went to bed, there to toss ceaselessly through
the endless hours of wakefulness, his mind tortured with thoughts
of his darling Fleurette, wondering how she would bear this first
night in prison, the propinquity, the want of privacy, the lewd
talk, perhaps, or coarse jests of some of her room-mates. It was
only in the early dawn that, wearied at last in body and mind, he
was able to close his eyes and snatch an hour or two's sleep.</p>

<p>When the concierge brought him a steaming mug of wine in the
early morning, his first inquiry was after the <i>calèche</i>. Was
it being got ready?</p>

<p>Yes! the concierge had seen the driver and postilion at work
this hour past. Everything would doubtless be ready for a start by
seven o'clock. It was now half-past six. Chauvelin drank the hot
wine eagerly; his sleepless night and all his anxiety had produced
a racking headache and a state of mental inertia difficult to
combat. Slightly refreshed by the drink, he proceeded to dress.
While he did so he heard a great clatter of horses' hoofs striking
the cobblestones, a good deal of shouting and rattling of wheels.
His windows gave on the Grand' Rue, and looking out he expected
presently to see the <i>calèche</i> being driven round from the
stable-yard at the back. But nothing came. He felt nervy and
impatient, hoping that nothing would go wrong. Angered too with
himself for feeling so flat on this very morning when he would need
all his brain-power to carry his scheme successfully to the
end.</p>

<p>He intended journeying with the two men as far as Lyons, and
there to invent a pretext for separating from them, sending them on
to Paris by the stagecoach, and then returning quietly and secretly
to Orange alone. Already he was fully dressed and ready to go
downstairs. He heard the clock in the tower of St. Apollinaire,
striking seven. A minute or two later the concierge, wide-eyed and
babbling incoherently, came bursting into the room.</p>

<p>"Citizen! Citizen! <i>Nom de nom, quel malheur!</i>" These
ejaculations were followed by a string of lamentations, and a
confused narrative of some untoward event out of which the only
intelligible words that struck clearly on Chauvelin's ears were:
"<i>Calèche</i>," and "cursed malefactors!" His questions remained
unanswered; the man continuing to lament and to curse
alternately.</p>

<p>Finally bereft of all patience, Chauvelin seized him by the
shoulder and shook him vigorously.</p>

<p>"If you don't speak clearly, man," he said roughly, "I'll lay my
stick across your shoulders."</p>

<p>The man fell on his knees and swore it was not his fault.</p>

<p>"I could not be in two places at once, citizen," he lamented. "I
was looking after your two friends and my wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chauvelin raised his stick. "What is it that was not your
fault?" he shouted at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"That your <i>calèche</i> has been stolen, citizen!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It is those cursed brigands! They have infested the town these
past&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died in his throat in a loud cry of pain. Chauvelin
had brought his stick crashing upon his back.</p>

<p>"It was not my fault, citizen," he reiterated protesting. "I
could not be in two places at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Chauvelin no longer stayed to listen. Picking up his hat and
coat, he hastened downstairs, to be met in the corridor by the
concierge's wife and two sons all incoherent and lamenting. The
whole house by now was astir. Public Prosecutor Isnard came
clattering down the stairs followed by President Legrange, both in
more or less hastily completed toilette. And thus the whole party
with Chauvelin <i>en tête</i> proceeded at full speed to the stable
yard, where the yawning coach-house and empty stalls told their
mute tale. Of <i>calèche</i>, horses, driver or postilion not a
sign. The stable-man, an old fellow, and his aid, a very young lad,
were busy at the moment telling the amazing story to a small crowd
of gaffers and market-women who had pushed their way into the yard
from the back and were listening, open-mouthed, to a tale of
turpitude and effrontery, unparalleled in the annals of
Valence.</p>

<p>At sight of Chauvelin and his tricolour sash, the crowd of
gaffers and women respectfully made way for him, and he, seizing
the old stable-man by the shoulder, commanded him to tell him
clearly and briefly just what had happened. Thus it was that at
last he was put in possession of the facts that touched him so
nearly. It seems that his own driver and postilion, up betimes, had
got the <i>calèche</i> and horses quite ready and standing in the
middle of the yard. They had in fact just put the horses to, and
the postilion and driver were standing by the <i>calèche</i> door
drinking a last mug of wine when,  from the narrow lane which
connects the yard with the rue Latour at the back, a band composed
of four ruffians came rushing in. Before he, the stable-man, could
as much as wink an eyelid, three of these ruffians had seized the
driver and postilion round their middle and thrust them into the
<i>calèche</i>, followed them in, banged the coach door to, whilst
the fourth climbed up to the box with the rapidity of a monkey,
gathered up the reins and drove away.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the lad who had been at work in the stables and
heard the clatter came running out. Stable-man and lad then ran to
the lane and out into the rue Latour, only to see the
<i>calèche</i> rattling away at breakneck speed. They shouted and
strained their lungs to attract the notice of passers-by, and they
did attract their attention, but before they could explain what had
happened, the <i>calèche</i> was well out of sight. The lad ran as
fast as he could to the nearest <i>poste de gendarmerie</i>, but
before the <i>gendarmes</i> could get to horse, no doubt those
ruffians would have got well away with their booty.</p>

<p>That was in substance the story to which Chauvelin had to
listen, and through which he was forced to keep his temper in
check. As soon as the stable-man had finished speaking, the lad had
put in his own comments, whilst the gaffers and gossips started
arguing, talking, conjecturing, giving advice, suggesting,
lamenting. Oh! above all lamenting! That the high roads were not
safe, every one knew that to his cost. Masked highway robbers held
up coaches, attacked pedestrians, robbed and pillaged the
countryside. That the streets of Valence were not safe, was alas!
only too true. The <i>gendarmerie</i> was either incompetent or
venal, and lucky the man who possessed nothing that could be taken
from him. But this outrage to-day in broad daylight surpassed
anything that had been seen or heard before. A <i>calèche</i> and
pair, <i>pardieu</i>! was not like a purse that could be hidden in
one's waistcoat pocket. And so on, and so on, while Chauvelin,
still silent and curbing his impatience, went back into the house,
followed by his crestfallen friends and by the staff of the Maison
de Têtes still lamenting and protesting their innocence and withal
beginning to feel doubtful as to what the consequences might be to
themselves of this untoward adventure.</p>

<p>The stable-lad was then sent back to the <i>poste de
gendarmerie</i>, with orders from Citizen Representative Chauvelin
that the chief officer in charge present himself immediately at the
Maison des Têtes. Whilst waiting for this officer, Chauvelin,
sitting in the small parlour, had a few moments' peace in which to
co-ordinate his thoughts. The inertia which had weighed upon his
spirits the first thing in the morning had been suddenly
dissipated. Already his keen, imaginative brain had seized upon
this catastrophe, and planned how to turn it to the furtherance of
his scheme. And while his friends, no whit less voluble or more
coherent than the concierge or his kind, were loudly lamenting:
"What a misfortune, citizens! What bad luck!" and throwing up their
arms in utter helplessness, Chauvelin broke in impatiently upon
their wailings:</p>

<p>"We must make the best of it, citizens," he said, "I shall
certainly be held up here a day or two, on this stupid business,
but it certainly need not detain you. The stage-coach leaves for
Lyons at half-past eight if I mistake not. As soon as my
<i>calèche</i> is recovered, which I doubt not it will be in a
couple of days, I'll follow you on. You in the meanwhile can
proceed to Paris all the way by stage-coach. It will be perhaps not
quite as comfortable as my <i>calèche</i>, but it will serve."</p>

<p>They demurred a little. The stagecoach would certainly not be as
comfortable as Citizen Chauvelin's luxurious <i>calèche</i>, and
perhaps a day or two's delay would not be very serious.</p>

<p>"It would be fatal," Chauvelin said emphatically. Orders from
Paris such as they had received must be obeyed in the least
possible delay, a couple of days idling in Valence, when a
stage-coach was available, would certainly be put down to
pusillanimity and want of zeal.</p>

<p>He could be eloquent when he liked, could Citizen Chauvelin, and
on this occasion he was determined to gain his point&mdash;to send
these two packing, post-haste, off to Paris, and leave himself free
to return to Orange immediately. As to what would happen presently,
when those two arrived in Paris and found that they had been
hoaxed, that they had not been sent for, and would have to return
biting the dust and chewing the cud of their wrath, as to that in
truth, Chauvelin had not given a thought. To save his Fleurette, to
get her away out of the country at the cost of his own life it need
be, was all he thought about, and while the business of trying and
condemning prisoners was at a standstill through the absence of
these two men, there was a hundred to one chance that he could
accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>Therefore he put forth all his powers of persuasion&mdash;and
they were great. He drew lurid pictures of what happened to those
who were thought to be guilty of dilatoriness or want of zeal. So
much so that he reduced President Legrange and Public Prosecutor
Isnard&mdash;at no time very valiant heroes&mdash;to a state of
abject fear, and half an hour later had the satisfaction of bidding
them <i>au revoir</i>, in the yard of the posting-inn, they having
found seats in the stage-coach to Lyons.</p>

<p>As soon as he had seen the last of them, he made haste to
requisition a chaise and the only horses to be had in Valence, to
take him forthwith to Orange.</p>

<p>As for his own <i>calèche</i>, he wished the foot-pads joy in
its possession and cared less than nothing what became of his
driver or his postilion.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>Could Citizen Chauvelin have seen his <i>calèche</i> and horses
a couple of hours later on the road, he would perhaps not have been
quite so complacent as to its fate. After rattling over the
cobble-stones of Valence and tearing down the high road at
maddening speed, it slackened a little for the hill, and worked its
way slowly up through the small township of Livron. A quarter of a
league or so further, it turned off at the cross-roads in the
direction of Cest and after another half-hour came to a halt at
that small cottage which still nestles to this day, with its
tumble-down roof and vine-covered arbour, beside the celebrated
Roman ruins at the foot of the hill, not far from the banks of the
Drôme.</p>

<p>Three ruffians, grimy from the roots of their hair to their
down-at-heel shoes, jumped out of the <i>calèche</i>, dragging
after them in the open the driver and postilion lately in the
employ of Citizen Chauvelin, Representative of the National
Convention on special mission. Whilst thus journeying between
Valence and Livron these two poor wretches had been securely
pinioned with ropes, but they were not gagged, and they used the
freedom left to their tongues, by uttering oaths and protests which
appeared vastly to amuse their captors.</p>

<p>The fourth ruffian&mdash;for ruffian he was&mdash;despite the
fact that he had donned a bourgeois' dress, the better to carry out
his coup and pass unnoticed on the road, had in the meanwhile
scrambled down from the box.</p>

<p>"Quite successful so far," he remarked lightly, speaking in
English, and rubbing his hands, which were slender and long and
firm, contentedly together.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with these?" one of his companions asked,
laughing and pointing to the two woebegone prisoners, who had
ceased to curse and to protest, chiefly owing to want of breath,
but also through astonishment at finding themselves the victims of
some kind of foreign brigands whose language they did not
understand.</p>

<p>"Poor beggars!" the other said lightly. "We'll place them in
front of an excellent breakfast and I'll warrant we need not as
much as tie their legs to their chairs. Get them inside, Ffoulkes,
will you, and I'll talk to them as soon as Tony and I have seen to
the horses."</p>

<p>"You don't think the <i>gendarmerie</i> from Valence will be
after us, Blakeney, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not they," Sir Percy replied. "They are very short of horses in
these parts, and the best will, I doubt not, be requisitioned by my
friend M. Chambertin for his own use. I wonder now," he added
musing, "what he is after, taking those two ruffians with him to
Paris; and whether his errand is sufficiently urgent to cause him
to travel in the stage-coach, now that we have borrowed his
<i>calèche</i>..."</p>

<p>He paused, slightly frowning, evidently a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he added, "if our friend in there can throw some
light upon the matter."</p>

<p>After which Sir Percy Blakeney and Lord Anthony Dewhurst took
the steaming horses out of the shafts, relieved them of their
harness and gave them a good rub down, a drink and a feed, while
Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Hastings went into the cottage and
busied themselves with their prisoners.</p>

<p>My Lord Stowmaries was for the moment in charge of this
untenanted cottage, which was a stronghold as well as a rallying
place of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, as it lay perdu, off
both the main and the secondary roads. He it was who had prepared
food for his chief and his comrades with the assistance of one
Amédé Colombe. The cottage consisted of four rooms; unsecurely
sheltered against the weather by a cracked roof, and against damp
by broken floors. There were a few very rare pieces of furniture in
the place, abandoned there by the late owner and his family, worthy
farmers whom the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had conveyed
safely out of France when their loyal adherence to their exiled
seigneurs had brought them under the ban of the Revolutionary
Government.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms the two prisoners were busy for the moment
pinching one another to see if they were really awake. After
thinking that they were within sight of death at the hands of a
band of malefactors, they found themselves sitting at a table in
front of an excellent plate of soup, some bread and cheese and a
very large mug of excellent wine, while the cords round their
bodies had been removed. Anyway, a very pleasant dream. Leaving
conjecture to take care of itself, they fell to on this welcome
repast with a healthy appetite. The door which gave on the larger
room had been left open, and through it the two men could see the
band of malefactors falling to, just like themselves, in front of
an excellent meal, laughing and talking in that same gibberish
language which they did not understand.</p>

<p>"They don't look to me much like brigands," the driver remarked
presently, speaking with his mouth full, "in spite of their dirty
clothes."</p>

<p>"And that tall one," the postilion added thoughtfully, "he seems
to be their captain. If you ask me I think he is an aristo."</p>

<p>"Or an English spy."</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not he. English spies would have murdered us."</p>

<p>"Then what in the name of hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no further, the postilion had gripped him by the arm.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de nom!</i>" the postilion exclaimed; and expressed
further amazement by a prolonged whistle. "If that is not Amédé
Colombe."</p>

<p>"Qui çà Amédé Colombe?" the other asked.</p>

<p>"The son of the grocer over at Laragne. I know, I come from
those parts. But what the hell is he doing here?"</p>

<p>Amédé Colombe sitting at the table with his wonderful new
friends, caught the sound of his name, and gave an anxious
start.</p>

<p>"Do not worry about them, my young friend," Sir Percy Blakeney
said reassuringly. "Before they could do you any harm we shall be
many leagues out of the way."</p>

<p>At which postilion and driver gazed at one another, more puzzled
than ever before. Were they really dreaming, or had they actually
heard that foreigner speaking their own language?&mdash;and
perfectly. The driver was inclined to think that the wine which
they had been drinking was potent enough to be the cause of the
hallucination. Not that this deterred him from pouring himself out
another mugful, and drinking it down with much smacking of the lips
and sighs of contentment. It was such very excellent wine. Didn't
his friend the postilion agree with him? Why of course, and the
filing and refilling of the two mugs continued apace and at a great
rate.</p>

<p>"They'll be blind in a few moments," Lord Anthony Dewhurst
remarked, glancing over his shoulder at the two men.</p>

<p>And he was right in this surmise. In less than a quarter of an
hour driver and postilion were blind to the world with arms
stretched out across the table, their heads buried in the bend of
their elbows, breathing stertorously.</p>

<p>"You are not eating my friend," my Lord Stowmaries remarked to
Amédé Colombe, who in truth had been sitting, silent,
self-absorbed, neither eating nor drinking.</p>

<p>"Friend, Amédé does not appreciate your cooking, old man,"
Blakeney put in lightly. "It is fairly bad, I confess. Is it not
Monsieur Amédé?"</p>

<p>"It is excellent, milor'," the young man sighed, "but I ask you,
how can I eat or drink when I am in such terrible anxiety?"</p>

<p>"We were just going to discuss the best way&mdash;and the
quickest&mdash;of alleviating your anxiety, mon ami," Sir Percy
rejoined, "all we were waiting for was for these two amiable
gentlemen over there to become deaf temporarily as well as
blind."</p>

<p>"It is not for myself that I am anxious, milor'," the young man
said timidly. He was over shy of these wonderful men, who had led
him from adventure to adventure, in a manner that had almost addled
his poor brain. His unsophisticated mind was still vibrating with
the excitement of the unforgettable hour, when throwing disguise
aside these strangers had revealed themselves not as revolutionary
soldiers at all, but as mysterious beings, whose actions had
appeared to him to savour of the supernatural. It took him a long
time to understand the situation. It seems that his being in
possession of Madame de Frontenac's valuables was known to the girl
Adèle who was nothing but a spy in the pay of the Committee of
Public Safety. She had that night spied upon him and the girl he
loved, seen the girl hand over the valuables to him, and revealed
the fact to the Committee. Had these mysterious strangers not
played the part of revolutionary soldiers and got him, Amédé,
safely out of the way, before the real soldiers appeared upon the
scene, he would at this moment be languishing in a prison at
Sisteron or Orange preparatory to being sent either to the
guillotine or for cannon-fodder on the frontier.</p>

<p>All this Amédé understood well enough, he cursed Adèle a
thousand times in his heart for being such a snake in the grass.
What he could not understand was why these strangers should take an
interest in him and in his fate. When to his timid query on that
subject their leader laughingly replied: "Sport! mon ami, the fun,
the excitement nothing more philanthropic, I assure you, just
sport!" he understood still less.</p>

<p>No wonder that to him, Amédé Colombe, the whole adventure had
come as a manifestation of something supernatural. As for M. de
Frontenac, his fellow-sufferer, on the other hand, he had
apparently been prepared for that manifestation. It appeared that
Madame and Mademoiselle had already been rescued from peril and
taken to a place of safety, where presently M. de Frontenac would
be able to join them, always through the instrumentality of these
wonder-working strangers. The last thing M. de Frontenac had said
to him, Amédé, when he took leave of him a couple of days ago,
somewhere in the lonely mountain paths where the party had called a
halt, was: "Trust these Englishmen Amédé, trust them with
everything you hold dear. Look at me, had I not trusted them with
my wife and daughter, I should have seen my dear ones first, and
myself afterwards, facing the guillotine at this very hour!"</p>

<p>It was with these words ringing in his ears, that Amédé, sitting
now amongst these men to whom he owed his life, had mustered up
sufficient courage to reiterate more firmly: "It is not for myself
I am anxious, milor'."</p>

<p>"I know that, mon ami," Sir Percy replied, "you are thinking of
that brave little girl&mdash;Fleurette. Isn't that her name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, milor'," Amédé whispered timidly.</p>

<p>"Some of my friends and I are going straightway back to look
after her now."</p>

<p>"And you will hurry, milor', you will hurry, will you not? Every
day may be fatal for her."</p>

<p>"I think not," Blakeney said in that decisive way of his, which
carried so much conviction. "You told me she was the daughter of a
man high up in the councils of the revolutionary government."</p>

<p>"One Armand, milor'," Amédé continued. "Little is known of him
in the neighbourhood, save that he is a widower and apparently has
influence with the government."</p>

<p>"Fleurette is an only child?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has lived at Lou Mas all her life."</p>

<p>"If her father has influence he can protect her for a time."</p>

<p>"For a time&mdash;yes! But&mdash;oh milor'!" the poor young man
suddenly burst out with passionate vehemence, "if anything were to
happen to Fleurette, I would curse you for having saved my
life."</p>

<p>Blakeney smiled at the young man's eagerness.</p>

<p>"Listen, friend Amédé," he said lightly, "are you going to trust
me and my friends?"</p>

<p>And Amédé, who remembered those last solemn words spoken by M.
de Frontenac, looked into those lazy grey eyes, meeting that half
earnest, half-humorous glance beneath the heavy lids, replied
simply: "Yes, milor'!"</p>

<p>"And you will accord me what my friends accord so ungrudgingly,
bless them, implicit obedience?"</p>

<p>Again Amédé replied simply: "Yes milor'!" And then he added!
"What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"For the moment nothing," Sir Percy replied, "but remain here
quietly and alone until you hear from me again. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"If you command."</p>

<p>"You won't mind the loneliness?"</p>

<p>"I shall be thinking of Fleurette and trusting you."</p>

<p>"Come, that's brave!" Sir Percy concluded lightly. "You will
find some provisions in the armoire in this room: but apart from
that you will find your way every day down to the river, and
turning to your right, you will walk along its bank till you come
to a derelict shed hidden from view by two old walnut-trees. In a
corner of the shed, beneath a pile of leaves, you will find
something to comfort you, either a loaf of bread, or a piece of
cheese, sometimes a jug of milk or a bottle of wine. Scanty fare
probably, but it will suffice to keep the wolf from the door. Those
who supply it are poor and risk much to do it. They owe my friends
and me a debt which they pay in this fashion. Now are you prepared
to live this life of a lonely anchorite while my friends and I
return to Laragne and gather news of your Fleurette?"</p>

<p>"If I could only come with you, milor'!" Amédé sighed.</p>

<p>"Tush, man, what were the good of that?" Sir Percy retorted with
a slight note of impatience in his pleasant voice. "You would only
lead us all&mdash;and your Fleurette into trouble."</p>

<p>"But you will bring me news of her soon?" Amédé entreated with
tears in his kind, innocent looking eyes.</p>

<p>"Either news of her&mdash;or Fleurette herself."</p>

<p>Amédé shook his head. "She would not leave her father," he said
dolefully.</p>

<p>"Then she will be safe with him, until better times come along,
which will be very soon, friend Amédé, you may take that from me.
Another few months&mdash;very few&mdash;and the dragon's own teeth
will be turned against itself. This anarchy cannot endure for ever,
because all evil, friend Amédé, is by the grace of God
Infinite."</p>

<p>He spoke these last words with unwonted earnestness, and simple
Amédé Colombe looked up to him with awe as to a prophet standing
there, magnificent in energy and strength, head thrown back, the
lazy eyes beneath their heavy lids flashing with unquenchable inner
fire. And suddenly he checked himself, laughter chased away
earnestness, the eyes twinkled with merriment like those of a
care-free schoolboy, rather than a seer.</p>

<p>"La!" he said lightly, "I verily believe we were waxing serious.
No cause for that, eh, friend Amédé? My friends and I are off on a
gay adventure. To take a message of love from you to a brave little
girl who loves you, a shade better methinks, than she loves that
mysterious father of hers. Write your love letter, my friend, but
be sure and make it brief, and I'll deliver it myself in her own
little hands. I saw her, that sweet wench of yours, no woman ever
showed more pluck than she did when she went to seek Madame de
Frontenac's valuables."</p>

<p>"You saw her, milor'!" Amédé exclaimed wide-eyed. "Mon Dieu! is
there anything that you do not see?"</p>

<p>"There is, mon ami," Sir Percy replied gaily. "I have never seen
your pretty Fleurette's mysterious father. He must be a fine man to
keep the love of so sweet a daughter. So write your letter, my
friend," he went on, and pointing to an oaken desk at the further
end of the room on which were quill-pen, inkpot and sand, "and I
promise you that I will deliver it, if only for the pleasure of
having a squint at the mysterious owner of Lou Mas. Heigh-ho!" he
added with a contented sigh, "but this promises to be fine sport.
What say you, Ffoulkes, or you, Tony? We are going to put our heads
into the wolf's jaws again, eh? Stowmaries, you, too, and Hastings.
But we'll do it, and I promise you that the sight of pretty
Fleurette will be a fitting compensation for some very unpleasant
half hours we may have to go through. Now then, friend Amédé! your
love missive, and two of you put the horses to, we'll have to make
Montélimar by nightfall! there we'll either abandon the
<i>calèche</i>, steal a couple of horses and cut across the hills
to Sisteron, or keep to the <i>calèche</i> and the road as far as
the neighbourhood of Orange, where much information can always be
gleaned about the district. We'll make no plans now and trust to
luck and chance. What?"</p>

<p>Lord Tony then pointed, smiling, to the driver and postilion
still fast asleep in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"What is to happen to those mudlarks?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We'll take them along, of course," Blakeney replied. "So thrust
them into the bottom of the <i>calèche</i>, under the seat for
choice, and those who sit inside can use them as footstools. Where
we leave the <i>calèche</i>, there we leave them too, to find their
way back to the bosom of their families in due course."</p>

<p>He looked so gay and so full of life and strength, so sure of
himself, such pure joy in this new adventure radiated from his
entire person, that some of that divine spark in him set Amédé
Colombe's blood tingling through his veins. Anxiety, melancholy,
doubt fell away from him at a glance from those lazy eyes now
twinkling with joy, at sight of that firm mouth, ever softened by a
smile; of those long, slender hands, delicate as a woman's, firm as
those of a leader of men. Poor Amédé was almost happy at this
moment, feeling that he was one with this band of heroes, that just
by obedience and self-effacement, he could feel that he was one of
them.</p>

<p>In cramped schoolboy hand, he wrote a brief, very brief little
line to Fleurette, and told her how he adored her and longed for
her nearness. He also told her that whatever else happened he
implored her to trust the bearer of this note, who would be the
means of bringing her back one day to the shelter of her Amédé's
arms.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later he was all alone in the tumble-down
cottage that nestled against the ruins of a former, long-since-dead
civilisation. The late afternoon was soothing and balmy, the sky of
a pale turquoise, clear and translucent, and as Amédé, standing
somewhat forlorn at the cottage door, watching the narrow road over
which the <i>calèche</i> had lumbered awhile ago, bearing away his
mysterious new friends, the pale crescent of the moon appeared
above the snow-capped crest of La Lance, and Amédé, remembering the
old superstition, bowed solemnly nine times to the moon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>What irked Fleurette most in her prison life was the monotony of
it: the want of something to do. After she had cleaned out the room
which she shared with ten others, and put herself and everything
tidy, the day appeared interminably long. She did her crochet work
while her supply of thread lasted; old Louise had been allowed to
make up a bundle of some clothes for her, and in it she had also
put the crochet work and a few hanks of thread, but a few days saw
the end of this supply, after which there was nothing with which
Fleurette could occupy her fingers. Some of her fellow prisoners
had needles, cotton and thimbles, and presently Fleurette, always
willing and always smiling, was asked to darn and mend their
clothes. She was glad enough to do it, as a means of killing
time.</p>

<p>They were a heterogeneous crowd these fellow-prisoners of hers,
culled from every social grade from the great lady to the troll out
of the street. Misfortune and the precariousness of existence had
brought these usually warring elements closely together:
friendships sprang up where in the past even a nod of recognition
would have been grudged. The Comtesse de Mornas, who belonged to
the highest aristocracy of Provence, would take her morning
exercise with her arm round the waist of Eugénie Blanc, daughter of
a second-hand clothes dealer of Orange. Hélène de Mornas's husband
had been guillotined three months ago on some trumped-up charge or
other, and Eugénie Blanc's father, accused of traffic with the
enemy&mdash;whoever that enemy might be no one knew&mdash;had
perished in that awful wholesale massacre perpetrated in Orange
last month. Sorrow brought these two women together, as it did many
others, and when Claire de Châtelard, obviously a woman of evil
reputation, sought Fleurette's compassion with a tale of hunger,
misery and arrest, that compassion was freely given, and the girl
who had led such a sheltered life at Lou Mas, knowing nothing of
temptation or of evil, had for daily companion after that, one
Claire de Châtelard, the most notorious jade of Orange.</p>

<p>Thus the first few days went by. In the prison&mdash;it is
architect Caristie's house with all the furniture turned out of it
and the rooms left bare of everything save a few benches, a few
paillasses, a table, a wash-hand basin or two&mdash;in the prison
great puzzlement prevails. Hither-to every day, just before sunset,
a captain of the guard with half a dozen men would enter the
courtyard and standing there, would in a loud voice read out a list
of names. That list was the Roll-call, the decrees of the
Revolutionary Tribunal condemning so many to the guillotine on the
morrow. And at all the windows of the house around the courtyard,
heads would appear: men and women&mdash;yes! and children
too&mdash;clutching their prison bars, and listening. Listening if
their name be upon that list. And then a sigh of relief if that
name was not called: another day's respite! another day in which to
drag this miserable, precarious existence. As for the others, the
ones whose names were read out in a loud voice by the captain of
the guard, there was nothing for it but to clasp their loved ones,
or mayhap only the newly-found friend, in their arms&mdash;for the
last time. That same night they were transferred to the prison of
the Hôtel de Ville, and in the morning the guillotine. Sometimes
not that. Just driven like a herd to the slaughter: on the bridge
or the Place de la République. And there the guns. And death
pell-mell. Like cattle, with ne'er a grave nor a prayer.</p>

<p>That was how it had been before Fleurette's arrival. That
cinder-wench Claire de Châtelard told her how it used to be. But
Fleurette never saw anything of that. The very day after her
arrival was marked by the non-appearance of the captain of the
guard with his list. They all wondered, put their heads together,
and for an hour or two after the usual time there was whispering,
conjecturing going on. Respite for everybody: that was of course
what it meant. But why? Had that awful Revolution really come to an
end, as everybody had prophesied it would? Had all those tigers up
in Paris really devoured one another, and was there no one left to
carry on the infamy? Well! that was perhaps how it was. But no one
knew anything. Not the warders. Not the prisoners. Not anybody.
Inside these walls wherein news was wont to penetrate with
extraordinary precision and rapidity, nothing was known. Nothing.
Except that there was no list and that on the morrow the guillotine
was idle.</p>

<p>This new departure from regular routine was accepted with the
same stoicism as everything else. It was the stoicism of supreme
helplessness, or rather of despair, and it had engendered in all
these people, men and women, herded here together on the eve of
death, a kind of levity which it is difficult for modern thought to
understand. Death was so familiar to them, such a daily companion,
that they had ceased to think of him with awe. Familiarity had bred
contempt. And deriding Death, they turned him into ridicule. Made
game of him, defied him to break their spirit. It was a species of
madness born of intense horror and absolute despair. Fleurette at
first felt sick and wretched at sight of these people&mdash;proud
countesses and high-born seigneurs, as well as muckworms and
jades&mdash;acting the guillotine, as they called it, in the great
hall of Architect Caristie's house, which was assigned to them for
recreation. She, poor little soul, had never learned to envisage
death as anything but awesome for which the Holy Church was at
pains to prepare doomed mankind with sacraments and prayers.</p>

<p>The first time she saw them all in their gruesome mummery, she
fled affrighted back to the dark, noisome room where she slept, and
throwing herself on her miserable paillasse, she sobbed her little
heart out with horror and grief, stuffed her fingers into her ears
so as not to hear the voices and the laughter that came from the
great hall. Here Claire de Châtelard found her an hour later, and I
think this was the beginning of their friendship, for the wench
found just the right words wherewith to console this ignorant
little country mouse.</p>

<p>"Their one recreation," she urged. "They mean no irreverence.
Just think of them face to face with death. Always. Deprived of
every consolation: mocked, jeered at. This play-acting is only a
blind to hide their own misery, the despair which they are too
proud to display."</p>

<p>After a while Fleurette dried her tears. But she slept ill that
night. Nightmares pursued her. Visions of that mock tribunal, with
the mock prosecutor, and the mock culprit. And then the setting up
of two chairs, and draping them with bits of crimson rags to
represent the guillotine. Once or twice she sat up on her hard
paillasse, hardly able to smother a scream which would have aroused
her room-mates from their sleep. She had seen in retrospect one of
the warders, who had helped in the acting of the gruesome play,
dressed as Satan with horns and tail and entering the hall with a
bound and a whoop. His rôle was to snatch the President of the
Tribunal and the Prosecutor from their seats and to drag them away
with him into everlasting fire, while a weird voice boomed the
query: "What hour is it?" and another replied: "Eternity."</p>

<p>Poor little Fleurette! It was her first experience of life. And
what an experience! Yet, it had only been one step from Lou Mas
with its almond-trees and rippling mill-streams, with Bibi and old
Louise, one step from there to this barrack of a house converted
into a prison, with all its humiliating propinquities, and all its
horrors. Her companions in misfortune were very kind to her. All of
them. The men as well as the women. Claire de Châtelard and the
Comtesse de Mornas. They all seemed to understand her position, her
helplessness, her ignorance. They were so kind! so kind! They
admired her crochet-work, and talked to her of Laragne, or the
snows of Pelvoux, or the almond-trees of the Dauphiné. They
thanked her and kissed her when she offered to ply her needle for
them: to mend their clothes or darn their stockings. Within a few
days she became one of themselves. A younger sister in this family
of the despairing. Within a week, or mayhap ten days, she had lost
her sense of horror at their mummeries, could laugh at the antics
of the mock Satan come to carry the mock judges off to hell. The
only thing to which she could not get accustomed was the
representation of the guillotine, the inverted chairs and the bits
of red rags, the cords, the victim, the basket and the executioner.
Oh! that executioner! He was terrible! Especially of late. The
rôle, like that of Satan, had always been undertaken by one of the
warders; rough fellows these, culled from the lowest scum of the
city; men who delighted in all the physical and moral torture
inflicted on the aristos under their charge, who would gloat over
the sight of a father torn away from his children and led to the
guillotine, who would regale the unfortunate prisoners with tales
culled from the <i>Moniteur</i> of wholesale executions or brutal
massacres. The idea of acting the part of executioner to the mock
representations of the guillotine delighted a certain grim sense of
humour which most Southerners possess. There was one man in
particular, lately come to replace another who was sick, who threw
himself into the gruesome rôle with zest. He would strip almost
naked for the part, and then cover his face and his large body with
a mixture of soot and charcoal and oil so that he looked like a
huge negro, with gleaming teeth and long, lank hair, of a pale
blond colour speckled with dirt.</p>

<p>Poor Fleurette could not bear to look at him, nor at the mock
execution when one or other of her fellow-prisoners would allow
himself to be tied to the mock guillotine, amidst the well-acted
laughter and jeers of men and women who impersonated the awful
rabble that was always to be found around the real guillotine. It
was horrible, and Fleurette would run out into the corridor, or
back to her miserable paillasse, anywhere where she could shut her
ears to that gruesome mockery.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there came a day when the warder declared that an
order had come through, that prisoners must remain together in the
hall during the hour of recreation. He said it was so, and there
was no one to contradict him. Of all the tyrants that had been set
over their fellow-men, these days, none were more dreaded because
more autocratic, than prison-warders. As far as prisoners knew,
these tyrants' power over them was absolute. In any case they
could, if contradicted or thwarted, make it ten thousand times
worse than before for those who did not cringe. This order then had
to be obeyed and Fleurette, cowering alone in a corner of the hall,
kept her eyes tightly shut while the impish scene was being
enacted.</p>

<p>Madame de Mornas, aristocrat, dignified, with her arm round
Eugénie Blanc's waist, spoke to her very kindly.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said in her gentle, well-bred voice, "if we did
not make a mockery of all these horrors we should brood over them,
and some of us would go mad."</p>

<p>And Eugénie Blanc, the "old clo" dealer's daughter, added with a
shrug: "You dear innocent! You have seen nothing of life as it is.
You don't know what it is when memory sets to work and you see
things&mdash;you see&mdash;" She gave a shudder and then a harsh
laugh. "This at any rate takes one's mind off memory for a
time."</p>

<p>Claire de Châtelard's sympathy was too sincere, though rather
more grim: "We've all got to go through the real thing presently;
the mockery of it now will make the reality to-morrow more
endurable."</p>

<p>"We must practice to-day," M. de St. Luce, the great scientist
said lightly, "our attitude of to-morrow."</p>

<p>That was the general tenor of every one's feelings upon the
subject. Fleurette, touched by so much sympathy, tried to smile
through her tears, and promised to school herself to the same
philosophy. But as soon as all these kindly creatures had left her,
in order to join, laughing, in the grim spectacle, she once more
closed her eyes and sat in the dark corner, quite still, hoping
that no one would notice her. But the laughter at one time was so
loud, every one's mood so hilarious, that involuntary she opened
her eyes and looked. The mock executioner had just completed his
task. It seems he was complaining that Madame la Guillotine was
still unsatisfied: she was putting out her arms, ready to embrace
another lover. M. de Bollène&mdash;a minor poet well known in
Provence&mdash;was declaiming some verses of his own composition,
in praise of that promised embrace. The executioner's coal-black
face shone like polished ebony in the flickering light of the
tallow candles that guttered in their sconces. Madame de Mornas,
almost unrecognizable in ragged kirtle and with a crimson scarf
tied round her head, was flourishing her knitting and humming the
tune of the <i>Carmagnole</i> as an accompaniment to M. de
Bollène's verses, whilst Claire de Châtelard sprawled at the foot
of the mock guillotine with a red streak across her throat.</p>

<p>And suddenly, to her horror, Fleurette saw the executioner
stride towards her corner.</p>

<p>"What?" he cried aloud, "tears? Tears are for aristos. To the
guillotine with her!" or words to that effect. Fleurette did not
rightly understand what he did say, all she knew was that this
hideous, horrible man came striding towards her with hands
outstretched, and that every one was laughing or singing or
clapping their hands. The next moment she felt that horrible hand
upon her shoulder, on her kerchief, her breast. She gave a loud
scream and cowered further into the corner thinking the she would
faint with terror, until she heard a peremptory voice calling out
loudly; "Leave the child alone, man, can't you see she is
frightened?"</p>

<p>"Frightened? Of course she is frightened," the loathsome
creature retorted with a laugh. "Did I not say that she was an
aristo? Let me just call the warder and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A woman's voice was raised in protest:</p>

<p>"No, no, don't call the warder. She's done nothing
wrong&mdash;and he might&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Madame de Mornas it was who added:</p>

<p>"You coveted this ring this morning, man, it is yours if you
leave the child alone and say nothing to the warder."</p>

<p>How kind people were! How kind! As nothing further seemed to
happen, Fleurette ventured to open her eyes: Claire de Châtelard
was sitting beside her, trying to comfort her. The gruesome play
had apparently come to an end; the prisoners in groups of three or
more stood about talking and laughing, preparatory to be driven
back to the sleeping-rooms for the night. The black executioner
was no longer there.</p>

<p>"He is not a bad man really," Claire de Châtelard said to
Fleurette, fondling her hand and smoothing the golden curls that
clung to her moist forehead! "only very rough and coarse. Bah!
these men!" she went on with a shudder. "The warder is a veritable
fiend: a genius in inventing means to punish you if you do not
bribe him or give in to him. All my little treasures which I was
able to bring here with me, have gone into his rapacious hands.
This man is not so bad, he is new to his work, he came a day or two
ago to replace one who was ill. But he is only a scavenger. When
the warder is dead drunk he takes his place, the rest of the time
he does all the dirtiest work in the house. A loathsome creature,
what? If he were not so big, we should not be so frightened of him.
But he is better than the warder."</p>

<p>Fleurette only listened with half an ear. She still felt bruised
and ill after the fright she had had. That horrible black hand
touching her breast. It was worse than any nightmare.</p>

<p>She was glad when the bell clanged and the warder accompanied by
his new aide&mdash;only partially relieved of the soot and the
grime of his rôle&mdash;drove the prisoners like a herd of cattle
back into their pens. So many women in one room, so many men in
another. He had his list, and with a stout stick in his hand which
he flourished as he read out the names, he drove them all in, into
their respective night quarters and locked the doors upon them.</p>

<p>Fleurette shared her wretched paillasse with Claire de
Châtelard. There was no dressing or undressing in this overcrowded
room. No privacy. One just lay down in one's clothes and snatched
what rest one could. Oh! the horror of it all to these women, most
of them accustomed to dainty homes. Fleurette never knew which
moment she dreaded most, that of opening her eyes to another awful
day, or trying to close them in intermittent sleep.</p>

<p>Claire de Châtelard, less impressionable, was already asleep.
Fleurette slipped out of her kirtle which she laid tidily across
the foot of the paillasse; then she took off her muslin kerchief.
As she did so something fluttered to the ground. A piece of paper
neatly folded. Smothering an involuntary cry of surprise, she
stooped to pick it up. Yet she hardly dared to touch the thing at
first. How had it got between the folds of her kerchief? Who could
possibly have put it there unbeknown to her? This was the second
time with in a very little while that Fleurette had come in contact
with something that savoured of the supernatural. Still timorous,
and with a trembling hand, she picked the paper up. Claire was
asleep and most of the others had already stretched out their limbs
upon their hard paillasses. No one paid any heed to Fleurette.</p>

<p>There was no direct light in the room itself, but an oil lamp
which hung from the ceiling in the corridor threw a feeble ray of
light through the fan-light over the door. Fleurette unfolded the
paper and smoothed out its creases against her knee. She made her
way to the centre of the room where she could just contrive, by
that dim light from above, to decipher the handwriting upon the
paper. But the first word that caught her eye, nearly caused her to
utter a cry of joy; it was the signature: <i>Amédé</i>.</p>

<p>Amédé! At once her eyes grew dim with tears. Amédé! Those five
letters in the clumsy, schoolboyish handwriting meant happiness and
home. Amédé! Before trying to read further she pressed the paper
against her cheek, fondled it; laid it against her lips.</p>

<p>Amédé! He had written to her. Where from? How? She did not care
to think. What did it matter after all? He was thinking of her. Had
written to her. And some divine messenger had conveyed his missive
to Fleurette. Though he was safe and well&mdash;Bibi had assured
her that he was&mdash;he had thought of her and sent her this
letter through one of God's own angels.</p>

<p>And then Fleurette dried her eyes, for she remembered that
presently the bell would clang again, when all the lights would be
put out and she might have to wait until to-morrow to read Amédé's
letter.</p>

<p>It was short, very, very short. Amédé had never been a scholar,
but in it he told her how he adored his Fleurette and longed for
her nearness. He also told her that whatever else happened, he
implored her to trust the bearer of this note who would be the
means of bringing her back one day to the shelter of his arms.</p>

<p>The bearer of this note? Who was he? Surely, surely, one of
God's angels! and so of course she trusted him. And it was only
<i>le bon Dieu</i> who would so guide Bibi that all this trouble
would come to an end and she, Fleurette, would of a certainty find
a shelter once more in her Amédé's arms.</p>

<p>She read and re-read the few brief lines over and over again,
and presently when the bell clanged, and she was forced to make her
way hurriedly to her paillasse before the room was plunged into
utter darkness, she laid down on the hard straw with a little sigh
of contentment and of peace. Her evening prayer was one entirely of
gratitude to <i>le bon Dieu</i> for His gift of Amédé's love and
Bibi's protection. And that night Fleurette slept quite soundly,
with her cheek resting against the letter from Amédé.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>For two whole days Citizens Pochart and Danou of the 137th
Section of the committee of Public Safety had been sorely puzzled.
They had received a curt note from Representative Chauvelin telling
them that he would be absent from Orange for a brief while, and
bidding them suspend all business until his return. Suspend all
business? In very truth all business was perforce at a standstill,
not because of the absence of the representative on special
mission, but because of that of two high officers of State; the
President of the Tribunal and Public Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Representative Chauvelin in his note had also alluded to this
absence, stating that by direct orders from the Central Committee
of Public Safety, President Legrange and Prosecutor Isnard had been
obliged to proceed to Paris.</p>

<p>It was all very puzzling, not to say suspicious. Pochart and
Danou put their heads together and came to the conclusion that here
undoubtedly were some machinations at work on the part of
Representative Chauvelin with a view to getting his daughter out of
harm's way. The question was how to make use of these machinations.
Of their knowledge that they were machinations. How in fact to turn
them against the man who hitherto had carried himself with such
consummate arrogance, lording it over every officer of State in
Orange, with thinly veiled threats that had roused ire, malice and
hatred in these men, whose rule of life was "strike ere you
yourself be struck."</p>

<p>One thing, however, was crystal-clear. Representative Chauvelin
was hard hit. He put on an air of lofty indifference; he continued
to bluster and to threaten but he was hard hit by the arrest of his
daughter, as indeed any family man would be. Pochart and Danou did
not care one worthless assignat what became of the daughter, but
they did feel that the pleasure of threatening and terrorising the
representative on special mission, perhaps even of dragging him
down from his exalted position and sending him in his turn to the
guillotine, was not one to be missed. Up to the hour when
Lieutenant Godet had arrested the wench Fleurette on suspicion,
Representative Chauvelin had been a living threat to every patriot
in Orange. He seemed, as it were, to be always walking hand in hand
with the guillotine, or else in its shadow; sheltered himself, yet
a menace to others. But now the tables were reversed, and Pochart
and Danou had in one hour learned to substitute threats for soft
words, arrogance for servility. And they vastly enjoyed the
substitution.</p>

<p>But the trouble was that they were void of imagination.
Representative Chauvelin could be brought down, they knew that. But
how? Judging other men by themselves, they quite envisaged the
possibility of a father sacrificing his own daughter in order to
save himself. And there was also the possibility that a
representative on special mission was powerful enough to save both
his daughter and himself. Strong forces would have to be marshalled
against him. Pochart and Danou with heads together passed these
forces in review.</p>

<p>There was Lieutenant Godet who hated Representative Chauvelin
with a hatred born of fear&mdash;the deadliest hatred of all. There
was that rat-faced little spy, Adèle, a mixture of petty spite and
malice. She would be useful. Others might be found, for
Representative Chauvelin had many enemies who had not until this
hour dared to come out into the open, but who would readily show
themselves once the powerful representative was attacked.</p>

<p>And in the meanwhile the business of purging the countryside of
aristos, suspects and traitors was at a standstill. With no Public
Prosecutor to frame indictments and no President to try the
accused, the order: "Que la Terreur soit à l'ordre du jour": "Let
Terror be the order of the day," had become a dead letter. This
could not go on, of course. Pochart and Danou, quite apart from
their schemes against Representative Chauvelin, felt that a
solution must be found&mdash;and that quickly&mdash;for this
impossible situation. If allowed to continue they stood in very
great risk of a reprimand from Paris for allowing the business of
the State to be at a stand-still. They might be accused of want of
zeal. Those great patriots up in Paris were so unreasonable, one
never knew what they might do. Having sent for President Legrange
and Public Prosecutor Isnard, they probably expected "the order of
the day" to go on just the same. But how, nom de nom? How?</p>

<p>They were still seeking a solution, these two, Pochart and
Danou, on the third morning, when to their surprise Representative
Chauvelin walked in, as calm and indifferent as you please.</p>

<p>He had completed his business, he explained to them, sooner than
he had anticipated. President Legrange and Public Prosecutor Isnard
on the other hand had continued their journey to Paris.</p>

<p>Danou, suave as ever, expressed satisfaction in the return of
the citizen representative. It was indeed a matter of
congratulation, he added, for them all, seeing that the business of
the State was so completely at a standstill.</p>

<p>Pochart was somewhat more emphatic.</p>

<p>"There are at least one hundred and sixty traitors," he said,
"who should have been dealt with days ago. Your absence, citizen,
and that of two other public servants should not have occurred at
this critical hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was inevitable, Citizen Pochart," Chauvelin broke in drily.
"Orders from Paris, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was just proposing to Citizen Pochart," Danou put in mildly,
"that we send a message to Paris by this new aerial telegraph to
ask for further orders. There is one installed at Avignon, and a
courier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The aerial telegraph is required for more important business
than yours, Citizen Danou," Chauvelin once more broke in, and this
time with some impatience.</p>

<p>"What can be more important than the suppression of traitors?"
Pochart argued with an obvious sneer. "I marvel at you, citizen
representative, that you should think otherwise."</p>

<p>"The very latest decree of the National Convention," Danou
added, "was that Terror be the order of the day. I too marvel at
you, Citizen Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"There is no cause for marvel," Chauvelin rejoined with well
assumed indifference. "I have not been in Orange more than a few
hours. I have not had time to devise for this new situation."</p>

<p>"Well, then, to-morrow, citizen," Danou suggested, "will you be
ready to consult with us on the best means of meeting this
impossible situation? Otherwise, I am still of the opinion that the
aerial telegraph, or perhaps a courier to Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went on mumbling for a few seconds. His tone had been quite
suave, not to say deferential; but Chauvelin's keen ear had not
failed to detect the threat that lurked behind those smooth,
velvety tones.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, as you say," he concluded dryly.</p>

<p>All through the wearisome journey back from Valence he had been
busy scheming and planning; alternately adopting and rejecting one
plan after another. He knew well enough that Pochart and Danou were
stalking him like wild beasts, ready to pounce on him, come to
grips with him in a life and death struggle in which his darling
Fleurette would also be involved.</p>

<p>Now after his interview with the two men, he knew that already
they scented victory, that they too were scheming and planning,
planning his overthrow, and using Fleurette as the deadliest weapon
against him. These last three years of titanic struggle of man
against man, of the strong against the weak, of the weak against
the strong, had taught him that he could expect nothing, neither
mercy nor consideration, from enemies whom he himself would never
have hesitated to sacrifice to his own whim or his own tyranny. His
only hope lay in his avowedly superior brain power. He no longer
could dominate these snarling wild beasts, now that they were
showing their fangs, but he could outwit them, before they sprang
and devoured him. Brain-power as against blind lust. And Chauvelin
thought that he could win.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>Representative Chauvelin was quite calm, business-like, armed
with sheaves of papers and documents, when he met his colleagues
the following morning in the bureau of the Committee.</p>

<p>"I have found," he announced as soon as they were seated, "a
solution to our difficulty."</p>

<p>"Ah?" Danou ejaculated simply. And Pochart also said "Ah," but
in a different tone.</p>

<p>"I have here," Chauvelin continued, and selected an official
document from the pile which he had deposited upon the table. "I
have here a decree which exactly meets our case. It was promulgated
by the National Convention on the motion of Citizen Cabot on the
6th of Brumaire last."</p>

<p>Leaning back in his chair, he began to read from the official
document in his hand. The others, elbows on the table, chin cupped
in hand, listened with what we might call mixed feelings.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Should it occur that through any cause
whatsoever, one of the chief officers of State be absent from duty
for a period exceeding seven days, the Representative on special
mission shall then assume his functions and continue to discharge
them for as long as seems expedient. And in the event of more than
one important officer of State being so absent, the Representative
on special mission shall himself appoint a substitute who will also
discharge such duties as the Representative on special mission
shall have assigned to him for the time being."</p>

<p>Having finished reading, Chauvelin put the document down, and
with a gesture of finality let his thin, claw-like hand rest upon
it.</p>

<p>"The decree is clear enough, methinks," he said coldly.</p>

<p>There was a pause. A silence lasting perhaps thirty seconds;
then Danou said mildly:</p>

<p>"I have never heard of this decree."</p>

<p>"Nor I," Pochart echoed.</p>

<p>"The Central Committee in Paris," Chauvelin put in drily, "has
often remarked on the strange ignorance displayed by avowed
patriots, of the decrees promulgated for the welfare of the State.
The Committee deems that such ignorance amounts to treason."</p>

<p>"May I look at the document?" Danou rejoined simply, choosing to
ignore the reprimand&mdash;and the thin veiled threat.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Chauvelin replied, and handed the document over to
his colleague.</p>

<p>"Is it a copy?" Pochart asked, looking over his friend's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"An attested copy, as you can see," Chauvelin replied. "It is
countersigned by Citizens Robespierre, Billaud, Couthon and Saint
Just. You are not thinking of disputing the order, Citizen
Danou?"</p>

<p>Once more and still that arrogance, those veiled threats. The
situation being entirely different from what it was yesterday,
Danou and Pochart dared not persist in their mood of defiance. Not
before they had consulted one another, marshalled those
forces&mdash;Godet, Adèle, the proofs against the wench
Fleurette&mdash;and decided on the mode of attack. Representative
Chauvelin must have something up his sleeve, some hidden power, or
he would not be so arrogant, so threatening.</p>

<p>Danou wiped the sweat from his bald cranium and handed the
document back to Chauvelin. Pochart shaking himself like a wet dog,
returned to his seat.</p>

<p>"I'll take over the office of President Legrange." Chauvelin
said calmly, "and preside over the Tribunal until his return."</p>

<p>"Then I," Danou put in boldly, "had best take over the work of
the Public Prosecutor."</p>

<p>"Impossible, citizen," Chauvelin rejoined firmly; "I must have a
lawyer for that office."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do not seem to have listened very carefully, Citizen
Danou," Chauvelin broke in quietly, "to my reading of the decree,
or you would remember that it is for the representative on special
mission to appoint a substitute, in case of absence on the part of
a second important officer of State."</p>

<p>"And whom do you propose to appoint, citizen representative?"
Pochart inquired with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I will let you know my decision as to that to-morrow."</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, citizen representative," Danou concluded
unctuously. "Remember that it is my colleague and I of the 137th
section of the Committee of Public Safety who will have to collect
the evidence against the accused and place it before the Public
Prosecutor whom you will appoint. That is a duty from which only
the Central Committee can relieve us. There are one hundred and
sixty prisoners, arrested under the Law of the Suspect. Some of
them gravely accused, and by witnesses to."</p>

<p>"I am well aware of that, Citizen Danou," Chauvelin replied
calmly. Not by the quiver of an eyelid did he betray the fact that
the shaft had gone home. With a perfectly steady hand he collected
his papers and placed a weight upon them. After which he dismissed
the others with a curt nod.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, citizens," he said, "I have still work to do. You
too doubtless. I shall require your attendance here to-morrow at
this same hour."</p>

<p>When the door had finally closed behind the two men, the mask
fell from Chauvelin's face. Leaning his elbows on the table, he
buried his burning head in his hands; a heart-rending groan broke
from his parched lips, his eyes felt as if seared with glowing
charcoal. Ah! if he had not only forgotten these years past how to
pray, what fervent orisons would he not have sent heavenwards at
this hour. Help! where could he find help out of this web which his
enemies had woven round him? How he hated them! longed to smite
them before they had time to accomplish their fell purpose. They
had determined on striking at Fleurette. Out of revenge or hatred,
or was it fear? they had determined on striking at him, Chauvelin,
through this being whom he loved beyond everything in the world.
And he who had been one of the first protagonists of hatred and
revenge and mutual distrust, he who had the will and the power,
seemed so inextricably enmeshed that he could do nothing to save
her. Fight? he would fight, inch by inch, step by step. Fight to
save his Fleurette. Fight while he had breath in his body; fight
until he fell vanquished by her side. For if he failed he would not
let her die alone. He could not think of her being dragged through
the streets in that awful tumbril which he himself had so often
helped to fill; could not&mdash;heavens above no&mdash;could not
think of her mounting the steps of the guillotine, which so many
innocent feet had mounted at his bidding. Retribution! It had come
nearer, more inexorable now! Death by his Fleurette's side seemed
the only possible issue.</p>

<p>And even as he sat there alone, in that room wherein the hatred
of his fellow-men seemed still to linger like noisome ghosts, a
pale ray of sunlight found its way through the closed window and
played upon the myriads and myriads of dust atoms that hovered in
the air. Chauvelin's hands dropped down upon the table. His weary
eyes rested vacantly upon that shaft of dust-laden light. And
inside its very heart he saw a face, smiling and debonair, with
lazy eyes and smiling lips mocking him in his grief. It was a
vision, gone as soon as seen, but vivid enough during that one
brief second to bring a savage curse upon the lonely man's lips.
His claw-like hand clenched so tightly that the knuckles showed like
polished ivory.</p>

<p>"My evil genius!" he muttered through his teeth. "Had I
succeeded in bringing you down, had I seen that mocking head fall
under the guillotine, this devastating misery would never have come
upon me. If only I could be even with you, I would die
happier&mdash;even now."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>Ever afterwards to Chauvelin, it seemed as if the Scarlet
Pimpernel had heard his challenge, and come in response to his
thoughts: for hardly had a couple of days gone before the first
rumour reached him of the nearness of his arch-enemy. Twenty-four
hours later the hue and cry was all over Orange after a gang of
English spies who, it was averred, made it their business to cheat
Madame la Guillotine out of her dues.</p>

<p>Citizen Pochart brought Representative Chauvelin the news which
already was over the town, namely that Architect Caristie and his
family, consisting of his wife and the small son now aged ten, who
was destined one day to become one of Orange's most distinguished
citizens, had unaccountably disappeared from their tumble-down
lodgings in the Rue de la République, where they had taken refuge
after their house had been requisitioned by the State and turned
into a prison-house.</p>

<p>For some time the sectional Members of the Committee of Public
Safety, Citizens Pochart and Danou, ardent patriots, had had their
eyes on the Caristie family. Aristos, what? Architect Caristie had
designed and built houses in the past for tyrants and
<i>ci-devants</i>. The arrest of the entire family had been decided
on. It was to have taken place that very evening. Orders to that
effect were out, their place of incarceration fixed in the very
house where they had once sat in luxury, whilst patriots had
starved outside their gates.</p>

<p>And suddenly the news had spread like wildfire through the town
that Architect Caristie, his wife and son had disappeared.
Disappeared? Where? asked every patriot. But no one knew. One
evening they had still been seen, as usual, taking walking exercise
on the river-bank, and the next day when the soldiers of the
revolutionary army presented themselves at the door of their
lodgings in the Rue de la République and demanded admittance, lo!
they received no answer: the lodgings were deserted, the birds had
flown from their nests. Nor could the guard at any of the gates of
the city throw light upon this mysterious occurrence. No one had
passed the gates without duly authenticated passes. Pochart was at
his wits end and asked counsel of Representative Chauvelin. What
was to be done in face of this mystery? Exercise strict supervision
at the gates, Chauvelin advised. All passes in future to be signed
by himself as well as by the Sectional Members of the Committee of
Public Safety.</p>

<p>The news of the presence of the Scarlet Pimpernel in Orange had
acted upon his nerves like a whiplash. Fate, it seemed, was hitting
at him from every side: and he felt like a fighter who has been
downed once, twice, and then suddenly felt the strength of giants
in his blood; the agility of a cat spurring him on to a new and
stupendous effort. In a vague, fatalistic kind of way the safety of
Fleurette and the destruction of the Scarlet Pimpernel appeared to
him as inextricably involved. If he allowed his arch-enemy to
baffle him now and here, in this city, then Fleurette was doomed
and he himself must perish.</p>

<p>This was the immediate state of mind into which the news of the
Scarlet Pimpernel had thrown him. A wild desire to link the
destruction of his enemy with the safety of his child, to deserve
so well of the State, in fact, that the life of Fleurette would be
ceded to him as a reward. A drowning man will catch at a straw, and
so did Chauvelin catch at this hope, cling to it, turn the thought
over and over in his mind. With feverish activity then he spurred
those about him into additional vigilance, combated that
superstitious terror with which every official these days regarded
the gang of English spies and their mysterious chief. He brought to
every man notice that the handsome reward offered by the
Revolutionary government for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel,
described the Englishman's appearance, his methods, his motives,
worked up every man in Orange, aye, and every woman too, into a
state of enthusiasm for the possible capture of this inveterate and
daring enemy of France.</p>

<p>But this particular frame of mind was not destined to endure.
Soon memory got to work, recalled unpleasant moments in Calais,
Boulogne, in Paris, in Nantes. What if here too, in Orange, the
Scarlet Pimpernel should triumph and he Chauvelin once more be
forced to eat the bread of humiliation? What if baffled once more,
he should lose, at one terrible swoop, both his revenge and his
last hope of saving Fleurette? And then it was that first the
insidious, the stupendous thought penetrated his brain. Was it
Satan himself who had whispered it into his ear? or some army of
mocking imps intent upon torturing him to madness? But heavens
above, what a thought! The Scarlet Pimpernel and Fleurette! Was
that going to be the solution of this terrible impasse? The thought
feverishly driven back at first, returned more insistent. Why not?
And then again, why not? A young girl, sweet, pretty, innocent, was
she not one to arouse those instincts of chivalry which Chauvelin
had hitherto affected to despise?</p>

<p>What a possibility! Heavens above, what a possibility! His very
senses reeled now at the thought. But he allowed his mind to dwell
upon it, to weigh his possibilities: to familiarise itself more and
more with it. At first it had seemed like madness, but no longer
now! His Fleurette! Already Amédé Colombe was far away, under the
protection of the Scarlet Pimpernel, what more likely than
that&mdash;No! no! it could not be! His daughter! His, Chauvelin's!
And in a swift vision he saw himself luring Marguerite Blakeney,
the beloved and beautiful wife of the Scarlet Pimpernel to her
death, holding her as a hostage, threatening her, torturing her.
His enemy's wife! What agonies she had endured at his hands! And
now Fleurette! Would not the Scarlet Pimpernel, triumphant and
revengeful, gloat over her death, rather than raise a finger to
save her life? Would he not gaze with joy on the misery endured by
his bitterest foe?</p>

<p>And then once more torturing thoughts would assail him:
torturing fears and torturing hopes, hopes? Yes, hopes! "Why should
you not hope, man?" Whispered an insidious demon in his ear: "the
Scarlet Pimpernel does not know, cannot know that Fleurette is your
daughter; the daughter of his enemy Armand Chauvelin. To him she is
just the sweet, pretty, innocent victim of a system of government
which he hates and which he combats. Then why not hope?" And the
floating, racking visions of Juliette Marny, and Yvonne de
Kernogan, of the Abbé Foquet and Madeleine Lanoy, would once more
haunt the day-dreams of this man already steeped in misery, and
hope insidious, ever-living hope, would whisper in its turn: "To
that long list of innocents snatched from prison and from death by
the insolent adventurer whom you hate, why should not the name of
Fleurette by added? Fleurette of unknown parentage, just a sweet
girl dwelling at Lou Mas, with old Louise and a father known as
Armand? Why not?"</p>

<p>And day after day, whilst presiding, self-appointed over a
tribunal of infamy, Chauvelin's mind became more and more
familiarised with the vision of his Fleurette snatched out of the
jaws of death by the man with the lazy eyes and the mocking lips,
the demmed, elusive Pimpernel of his day-dreams and his sleepless
nights.</p>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>Meanwhile in Architect Caristie's house, transformed for the
necessities of the State into a prison, the old routine is now
restored. Daily, once more, an hour before sunset, the captain of
the guard with his half-dozen men, enters the courtyard, and in a
loud voice reads the names that appear upon his roll-call. They are
the names of those who on the morrow are summoned before the
Revolutionary Tribunal, there to answer the charges that are
trumped up against them by the venal spies, who make their living
out of the blood of innocent men and women and children.</p>

<p>Impossible to refute those charges, since the law has decreed
that it is a crime to be merely suspected of treason against the
State. Foucquier-Tinville, the great Public Prosecutor in Paris, no
longer troubles, it seems, to prepare fresh indictments against
every accused in turn. He has a printed formula of accusation, with
just the name left in blank, presently to be filled in as
convenience arises. Therefore in other greater and lesser cities of
France, patriots desirous of showing their zeal, can do no better
than emulate the example set by so great a man. Local sections of
the Committee of Public Safety prepare the indictments&mdash;set
formulae with the names left in blank. These they pass on to the
Public Prosecutor who mumbles as he reads them before the Tribunal
with the President sitting up on the dais, and the
accused&mdash;names left in blank&mdash;brought up to the bar, not
allowed to say a word in their own justification, nor to question
the witnesses brought up to testify against them.</p>

<p>Abandon all hope then, ye whose names are upon that Roll-call!
to-morrow the Tribunal, the next day the guillotine! And once again
now, day after day, the captain of the guard comes to the house,
late of Architect Caristie, and reads; and at all the windows that
overlook the courtyard heads appear, men, women and little
children&mdash;clutching the bars and listening. Listening for
their own name or that of one who is dear. Sighing with relief if
neither has been called, or with resignation if to-morrow is
destined to bring this miserable existence to an end.</p>

<p>And day after day Chauvelin presides over this tribunal of
infamy. Self-appointed he sits upon the dais and sees before him
pass a daily file of doomed and dying. Sometimes ten, sometimes as
many as twenty in a day, and still the prisons are full&mdash;fresh
arrests make up for those whom the guillotine has claimed.
Acquittals are rare, for moderation now has become a crime.
Danton&mdash;aye! even Danton, the lion, has perished, he who
ordered the September massacres, he who thundered forth from the
tribune, "Liberty! Fraternity! Equality! or Death!" he has perished
because he became guilty of the crime of moderation. The glorious
revolution has no use for such of its products as Danton and
Robespierre&mdash;for the reality of the one and the canting
hypocrisy of the other: so Danton it was who perished. "It is
right," he had dared to say once, "to repress Royalists: but we
should not confound the innocent with the guilty!"</p>

<p>"And who told thee," Robespierre retorted, sea-green with
hatred, "that one single innocent has perished by our hand?"</p>

<p>And because Danton had dared to raise his voice in the cause of
the innocent, Danton had perished.</p>

<p>What chance then has Chauvelin to defend his Fleurette? His
power is great. He can make your Pocharts and your Danous, our
President Legrange or Public Prosecutor Isnard, but he cannot
accord special privileges in prison for his own daughter. He cannot
see her in private, comfort her, warn her if need be, tell her not
to be afraid for Bibi chéri is there, on the watch, ready to
protect her with his body, to stand by her in the last hour. He
cannot. Pochart and Danou are on the watch. "We must not confound
the innocent with the guilty:" Danton had dared to say. And for
this he had perished: and though he perished, could not save one
single innocent.</p>

<p>And all evening, after the sittings of the Tribunal are over,
and ten&mdash;or mayhap fifteen or twenty&mdash;condemned to the
guillotine, Chauvelin like a pale, thin ghost haunts the purlieus
of Architect Caristie's house. On pretext of his office he enters
the courtyard with the captain of the guard and looks up at the
windows to see if <i>she</i> is there. Once he saw her. Just her
little face peeping behind the opulent shoulders of one Claire de
Châtelard, the best noted strumpet in Orange. The woman had one arm
round Fleurette's waist and when the captain of the guard read out
the name of Claire known as Châtelard upon his list, Fleurette threw
her arms round her and laid her head upon the trollop's breast.</p>

<p>Chauvelin turned away from the spectacle with a groan, and all
night he lay awake thinking of his sweet flower laying her head
upon the breast of a Claire de Châtelard.</p>

<p>Yet Claire de Châtelard bore herself bravely before him the next
day, and when, on the day after that, he watched her from the
window of the Hôtel de Ville mounting the steps of the guillotine,
saw her standing there, superb and defiant with a coarse jest upon
her sensual lips, he gloated over the thought that his Fleurette
would no longer pillow her innocent head upon that breast. He tried
to picture her, grieving for this friend, the propinquity, the
squalor of that house of detention, from which there was but one
egress, that egress the gate of Death. Claire de Châtelard
to-day&mdash;Fleurette when? Every day the indictments are sent up
to him for examination, the printed forms of accusation with the
names left in blank, to be filled in as convenience demands: and
every day a list of ten, perhaps fifteen names are sent along with
these printed forms, and it is his business to direct the Public
Prosecutor, a man of his own choosing, which of these names are to
be inserted in the blank spaces, on the forms of accusation. Up to
now he has been able to keep Fleurette's name out, but it has been
sent up to him on two consecutive days. The fight then was getting
at close quarters, Pochart and Danou were pressing him, showing
their teeth like snarling dogs ready to spring. And time was
hurrying on. Time would presently bring back President Legrange and
Prosecutor Isnard from Paris, time would inevitably bring to light
his machinations for keeping those two men out of the way. Aye!
time was hurrying on, and Fleurette's name had twice appeared upon
the list.</p>

<p>And for the past three days not a word in the town about the
English spies. After Architect Caristie and his family, it had been
the widow Colmars and her daughter, and then General Paulieu and
his family. Disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them up.
Always traitors and aristos whose arrest was imminent, whose
subsequent condemnation certain. But after that, three days'
respite: the Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang seemed to have
disappeared in their turn.</p>

<p>The hopes which insidious demons had whispered in Chauvelin's
ears were once more merged in a sea of despair. He derided himself
for these hopes, lashed himself into a state of fury against
himself for having allowed his mind to dwell upon them.</p>

<p>One scheme after another now did he devise and then reject. He
would defy his enemies, the jury, the populace: loudly denounce the
witnesses against Fleurette as liars and perjurers, pronounce her
acquittal in the face of all opposition. Had he not made a point
day after day of pronouncing acquittal on one or the other of the
accused? just to test his power&mdash;to see how his enemies would
behave? And he saw them lying low. Sneering. Whispering. Ogling him
and laughing. They knew! They saw behind his schemes and his hopes.
They reserved their counter-attack. They could afford to wait,
whilst he could not.</p>

<p>If only Fleurette bore herself well: did not allow herself to be
carried away with admissions or inconsidered words, out of
sentiment for that fool Amédé Colombe. Chauvelin longed to see her,
if only to impress this one thing upon her; to say nothing. To
admit nothing. To hold her tongue and to trust chére Bibi. If only
she did that, he felt that he might save her yet. And obsessed by
the idea, devoured with the desire to convey this message to her,
without compromising her or giving yet another advantage to his
enemies, Chauvelin at evening would wander like a restless ghost
through the city.</p>

<p>That afternoon after he watched Claire de Châtelard mount the
steps upon the guillotine, a joke upon her lips, this restlessness
became exquisite torture, and racked with tumultuous thoughts,
wrapped in a black mantle, he sallied forth into the streets. It
was now early in June: nearly three weeks since that last care-free
day, Fleurette's eighteenth birthday, spent with her over at Lou
Mas, when the scent of almond blossom had been in the air and the
nightingale had sung in the old walnut-tree. The day had been
sunless and chilly, after sunset the rain began to fall. But rain
and weather held no terrors for Chauvelin in his present mood.
Holding his mantle tightly round his shoulders and pulling his hat
down over his eyes, he wandered aimlessly through the streets, over
the river and back again, down unpaved streets and lonely lanes,
now and then sitting down to rest in some obscure little outlying
café, where no one knew or heeded him, and then starting off again
on his restless course. But always drifting back instinctively to
the purlieus of architect Caristie's house.</p>

<p>Almost opposite to it there was a small café: no one sitting
outside because of the rain, but the interior lighted up, and
sounds of merriment proceeding from within. Chauvelin thought of
going inside, feeling that if he sat down there close to the
window, he could watch the walls behind which lived and suffered
his little Fleurette. He did not dare to go in for fear of being
recognised. He was just debating within himself whether he would go
or stay, when he saw a man come out of the house of architect
Caristie, cross over to the café, then disappear behind its
creaking door. A scavenger, no doubt, ragged and dirty&mdash;not a
warder, he was too ill-clad for that&mdash;just a scavenger&mdash;but perhaps he had seen Fleurette. The thought fascinated
Chauvelin. His mind clung to it: turned it over and over. The
thought that here was a man who perhaps had seen Fleurette within
the last few minutes, had swept corridor or staircase when she was
passing by. And with that thought there was still the burning
desire to send her a message, to tell her to be brave and trust in
Bibi, but above all, oh! above all, not to be led into making any
admission about those valuables belonging to Madame de Frontenac,
or about her association with Amédé Colombe.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, leaning against the wall which faced the little café,
dwelt on his thoughts and his desire. He allowed the rain to drip
upon his hat and upon his shoulders from the roof above him. He no
longer felt restless. He just wanted to stand there and watch for
the return of the man, who perhaps would be seeing Fleurette again
within the next few minutes. He wondered if he dare approach him,
always with the idea of possibly conveying a message to Fleurette.
But the fear that the man might know who he was, deterred him from
entering the café himself. He had been a fairly conspicuous figure
in the courtyard of Caristie's house, standing by the side of the
captain of the guard: if that scavenger was at work in the
corridor, he might have looked out of the window and seen him,
learned who he was. All through he had been at pains to show an
indifferent attitude before his enemies: if this man happened to be
a spy, would the knowledge that he, Chauvelin, was trying to
establish communication with Fleurette compromise him hopelessly
and do no good to her?</p>

<p>As he stood there pondering and debating what he had better do,
he saw the scavenger come out of the café. For a minute or two the
man stood at the door, his hands buried in the pockets of his
ragged breeches, contemplating the rain. The next moment another,
equally dirty and bedraggled ruffian came down the street, paused
at the entrance of the café and passed the time of day with the
scavenger. The two mudlarks remained talking for a few moments,
after which they parted, each going his own way. The scavenger
recrossed the road and entered the Caristie House. The other passed
on in the opposite direction and Chauvelin, after an instant's
hesitation, followed him. He came up with the man at the angle of
the rue Longue: and putting out his arm, touched him on the
shoulder. With a cry of terror the man fell on his knees.</p>

<p>"Mercy! I've done nothing!" he babbled almost incoherently.</p>

<p>"I dare say not," Chauvelin said drily "but it will be to thine
advantage if thou'lt come along quietly with me."</p>

<p>He seized the man by the arm and dragged him up from his knees.
The poor wretch tried to wriggle himself free, but Chauvelin held
him tightly, and without another word drew him within the shelter
of the nearest doorway. Fortunately, though the man kept up a
ceaseless litany of lamentations and cries for mercy, he did so
under his breath, thus creating no disturbance nor exciting the
attention of the few passers-by who were hurrying homewards through
the rain-swept streets.</p>

<p>"Are you willing, citizen," Chauvelin began abruptly, as soon as
he had assured himself that the doorway was deserted and no
eavesdropper nigh, "are you willing to earn fifty livres
tournoi?"</p>

<p>The man gave no immediate reply, it seemed as if he was shaking
himself free from his first terror and pondering over this
extraordinary proposal, so different to what he had anticipated.
Then he cleared his throat, expectorated, slowly repeated the magic
words: "Fifty livres tournoi!" and finally added in an awed
whisper:</p>

<p>"I have not seen five livres tournoi for months."</p>

<p>"Fifty are yours, citizen, if you'll render me a service."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That friend of yours, to whom you spoke just now&mdash;outside
the <i>Café de la Lune</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Citizen Rémi?"</p>

<p>"He works in the Caristie House?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In what capacity?"</p>

<p>"Cleaner," the man replied laconically. "Rémi hung about for
days trying to earn a bit of money. He hasn't a sou, you
understand? Same as me. A few days ago one of the inside men fell
sick. Rémi presented himself and got the work. I know him
well."</p>

<p>"He has access to the prisoners?" Chauvelin asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Then tell him that there will be fifty livres for him too if he
will convey a written message to number 142 in room 12."</p>

<p>Again the man seemed to ponder: weighing the risks probably, and
also the gain. Fifty livres tournoi! Immense! He had forgotten that
there was such a sum of money left in the world: and then for him
to have the handling of it! This led him once more to expectorate,
which action apparently had the effect of stimulating his
brain-power.</p>

<p>"It could be done," he murmured at last.</p>

<p>"It can be done," Chauvelin asserted emphatically, "but must be
done quickly, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rémi will be back at the <i>Café de la Lune</i> soon after
eight o'clock. He always goes there for a sip of something after
supper."</p>

<p>"Good! Then you can meet him at that hour and tell him to wait
for you, then come at once and find me here, under this doorway.
I'll have the letter ready&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The whole thing is very risky, citizen," the man demurred.</p>

<p>"If it were not," Chauvelin rejoined drily, "I would not spend
one hundred livres tournoi in the attempt."</p>

<p>"Fifty livres is not over much, when one risks one's neck."</p>

<p>"You are not risking your neck," Chauvelin retorted, "as you
well know. And you'll not get more from me than fifty livres each.
Take it or leave it."</p>

<p>He knew how to deal with these mudlarks, apparently, for the man
after he had spat once more once or twice, seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"I'll be back here," he said laconically, "after I have seen
Rémi again."</p>

<p>Then Chauvelin let him go. The darkness and the rain soon
swallowed him up: but Chauvelin himself remained for quite a while
standing motionless under the doorway. He had not yet burnt his
boats, was still free, if he thought the risk too great, to fail in
his appointment. The man did not know who he was, had not seen him
in the darkness and under the wide brim of his hat: but there was
the risk that this Rémi might be a spy, who would take the letter
intended for Fleurette straightway to Pochart or Danou. The letter
might thus betray him and so minimise his power of saving
Fleurette. He had to safeguard himself against the merest breath of
suspicion in order to keep his power. The more irreproachable,
detached, incorruptible he appeared before the populace, the more
Spartan in his attitude towards his own child until the day of her
trial, the greater his chance of saving her at the last. But his
desire to warn her against unconsidered words or any kind of
admissions outweighed for the moment every other consideration. He
hurried back to his lodgings through the rain, and at once sat down
to pen his letter to the child.</p>

<p>"My beloved one," he began, "at last I am able to send a word to
you, which I hope and trust will reach your darling little hands.
Child of my heart, this is to entreat you to continue in your trust
of me, for I swear to you by the memory of your dead mother, that
while you trust me I can save you. I can save the man you love.
Moreover, I entreat you, beloved child of my soul, do not make any
admission when brought before the tribunal, as you must be shortly,
alas! If witnesses testify against you, just hold your peace; if
others question you, deny everything. This I entreat you to do for
the sake of the love I bear you, for the sake of the tears I have
shed these past weeks, ever since your folly hath brought you to
this pass."</p>

<p>He signed the letter "Bibi." Thus he had mentioned no names and
in addition taken the precaution of disguising his writing as far
as he was able. After which he sealed the letter and slipped it in
the inner pocket of his coat. Time was now hanging heavily. Like a
beast in its cage, Chauvelin paced up and down the narrow room, his
hands clenched behind his back, a world of soul agony expressed
upon his wax-like face.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard the tower-clock of Notre-Dame strike eight,
he picked up his hat and cloak and once more sallied forth into the
streets.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>A quarter of an hour later two out-at-elbows ragamuffins met
inside the <i>Café de la Lune</i>. Outside the rain had not abated,
both the men, who were clad in what were little more than rags,
appeared soaked through to the skin. At this hour the little café
was almost deserted. Citizen Sabot, the proprietor, was sitting at
one table with a couple of friends; at another a couple of
road-menders were sipping their absinthe, when the scavenger from
the prison house came slouching in. He sat down on the bench
against the wall in the darkest corner of the room and ordered a
bottle of wine for himself and a friend. Presently the latter came
and joined him and for a while the two men sat drinking in silence.
Soon an animated discussion arose between the proprietor and his
friends on the respective merits of Vouvray and Beaujolais as a
table wine.</p>

<p>This entailed much shouting and copious gesticulations. Sabot
had a deep-booming voice which reverberated from end to end of the
room and caused the window-panes to rattle in their frames.</p>

<p>The scavenger from the prison house had apparently drunk more
during the day than was good for him. His head leaned heavily on
his hand, his elbow resting upon the table, his eyes had become
bleary, his speech uncertain. His friend sat opposite to him, with
his back to the rest of the company, and when Sabot's voice roused
the echoes in the small stuffy room, he leaned forward and
whispered in the other's ear:</p>

<p>"I had an adventure after I left you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Eh?" the scavenger murmured incoherently. "Where?"</p>

<p>"At the angle of the Rue Longue I was pounced upon in the
darkness and dragged under the shelter of a door-way. A man had me
by the shoulder. He had seen me talking with you. He offered me
fifty livres and the same for you, if you will give a letter to a
certain prisoner in there."</p>

<p>And he nodded in the direction of the high walls of the Caristie
house. His friend's reply to this preliminary statement was a
prolonged snore.</p>

<p>"The prisoner to whom you are to give the letter is number 142
in room 12," the other went on, still speaking below his breath.
"Who is that? Do you know?"</p>

<p>The scavenger from the prison house waited for a moment or two
until the discussion at the next table was specially loud-tongued,
then he murmured:</p>

<p>"Yes! It is the girl Fleurette."</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked his friend.</p>

<p>"Who was the man who spoke to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was pitch-dark. He wore a broad-brimmed hat
and spoke in a hoarse whisper."</p>

<p>"Her father, probably. The man Armand, I have marvelled why we
did not hear from him before. What have you arranged?"</p>

<p>"That I meet him under the same doorway, after I've seen you. He
will then give me the letter."</p>

<p>"We'll keep to that then. But try and see the man. I might
recognise him by your description."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment or two, yawned, stretched, emptied his
mug of wine and then went on. "If I went myself I might scare him
off. So it is best you should go. But try and see his face. I'll
wait here till you come."</p>

<p>After which he ordered another bottle of wine. Sabot broke away
from his friends in order to serve his customer.</p>

<p>"You've had about as much as you ought to have, citizen Rémi,"
he said drily, as he uncorked the bottle and set it on the
table.</p>

<p>"That is none of your business, citizen," Rémi retorted with a
bibulous laugh, "so long as I pay for what I drink."</p>

<p>He threw some coins on the table. Sabot picked them up with a
shrug and then rejoined his friends, and resumed the discussion
with them on the merits or demerits of Vouvray and Beaujolais. The
other ruffian took the opportunity of shuffling out of the café,
and the scavenger, sprawling over the table, composed himself to
sleep.</p>

<p>Hugging the walls, the other slunk through the street till he
came to the doorway, where effectively he had appointed to meet
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"Well!" the latter queried impatiently as soon as the other came
in sight. "Have you seen your friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does he agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Chauvelin drew the sealed letter from his
breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Fifty livres, remember," he said slowly, "for each of you, when
you bring me back the answer."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the man exclaimed, visibly disappointed. "There's an
answer then?"</p>

<p>"Yes! An answer. Your friend will see to it that you bring me
back either an answer or some token which will satisfy me that the
letter is in the right hands."</p>

<p>The man gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"You do not trust me, citizen," he said.</p>

<p>"No," Chauvelin replied laconically. "I do not."</p>

<p>"I do not blame you," the other retorted. "I do not trust you
altogether either. How do I know, when Rémi and I have risked our
lives in your service, that the money will be forthcoming?"</p>

<p>"You do know that, citizen," Chauvelin rejoined drily, "and
anyway you are bound to take that risk."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" the man retorted.</p>

<p>"Because you are more sorely in need of money than I of your
services."</p>

<p>This argument appeared unanswerable. At any rate the ruffian now
said with a light laugh:</p>

<p>"Have it your own way. Give me the letter. Number 142 in room 12
shall have it, you can wager your shirt on that."</p>

<p>Without another word Chauvelin handed him the letter. It was so
dark under the doorway that it was only by groping that the other
was able to get hold of it. He drew so near to Chauvelin that the
latter, fearing that the man was trying to have a close look at
him, pulled his hat lower down over his eyes. The other resorted to
his habitual expression of indifference by spitting upon the floor;
then he slipped the letter underneath his ragged blouse.</p>

<p>"Where do I find you," he asked, "after Rémi has done your
errand?"</p>

<p>"You will go into the Rue Longue," Chauvelin replied, "To the
house of citizen Amouret, the chandler. Up the first flight of
stairs, on the right-hand side, you will come to a door which is
painted a slate-grey. Knock at that door and you will find me
within."</p>

<p>"At what hour?"</p>

<p>"At any time to-morrow after the executions in the Place de la
République," Chauvelin replied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>To say that Fleurette had in the past few days become
familiarised with the grim mummeries that went on in the common
room, would be putting it rather strongly. But she certainly had no
longer the same horror of them as she had had at first. The
presentment of the mock guillotine still harrowed her, it is true,
but she could not help laughing when the antics of the mock Satan
and his satellites when they seized the President of the Tribunal
and the Public Prosecutor and dragged them off to an imaginary
hell. There was that one man in particular whom she had sometimes
noticed before and who was aide to one of the warders, and was very
diverting. She used to watch him turning and wriggling his huge
body, which he had painted all over with soot and draped in bits of
red rags. He made an ideal Satan with tail and horns complete, and
sometimes it seemed to Fleurette as if he went through all his
antics for the sole purpose of bringing a smile upon her lips.
Moreover, in a vague kind of way, she associated him with that
lovely letter from Amédé, which she had found inside the folds of
her kerchief one evening.</p>

<p>The death of so many who had been her prison-companions at
first, especially that of Claire de Châtelard had deeply affected
her. The want of fresh air, of exercise, and above all of love and
joy, had begun to affect her health: her cheeks had lost their
freshness, her eyes their lustre, her lips their smile.</p>

<p>It was only in the recreation hour that she would smile
sometimes. Always when that big, clumsy, hideous-looking fellow who
was some kind of aide to one of the warders, set himself the task
of fooling for her benefit. She came to look upon him as a friend,
and remembering how mysteriously that letter from Amédé had come
inside her kerchief, she would look up whenever he came near her,
wondering if he had another such welcome message for her. And one
evening&mdash;she really had not the least idea how it
happened&mdash;she found a sealed letter inside her work-basket.
And the letter was from chéri Bibi. Oh! the joy of it! She read,
and re-read it, and kissed the paper whereon his dear hand had
rested. How she had missed Bibi all these days! How she longed to
reassure him that she was well and that she trusted and believed in
him! As to obeying him in all things, of course she would do it. To
begin with, she was not afraid, not the least bit in the world. He
was watching over her, and he was so great and powerful that no
danger could possibly assail her while he cared for her. She would
indeed obey him in all things, hold her peace while that wicked
Adèle tried to do her harm; she would hold her peace before the
Tribunal just as le bon Jésus had done when he was questioned by
his judges.</p>

<p>Oh! it was a dear, a comforting, an infinitely precious letter.
And beside it Fleurette had found a tiny little slip of paper on
which were scribbled the words: "Let me have something to take back
to the writer, to let him know that you are well. Leave it in your
work basket, and I will see to it that he gets it." And so
Fleurette had written a few lines to chéri Bibi; told him that she
was well, and assured him that she was not afraid and would obey
his commands in all things. She would hold her peace and trust in
him. This little note she had hidden that evening in her work
basket and by noon on the following day it had gone.</p>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>"But me no butts, my dear Tony, I am sick of all these filthy
rags. And if I am to see pretty Fleurette's papa then must I see
him decently clad and in my right mind."</p>

<p>So spake Sir Percy Blakeney to his friend, late the following
evening, it was in an attic under the roof of a half-derelict house
in the Rue du Pont close to the river-bank. The owners of the house
had long since disappeared, fled into the mountains or perished on
the guillotine; no one knew or cared. Blakeney, and those members
of his league who were with him, had hit upon it on their arrival
in Orange, had made the attic their head-quarters, whilst most of
the vagabonds of the city used the rest of the house as their lair.
They too were outwardly vagabonds, dressed in rags, appeared
unkempt, unshaven, and unwashed, when they sallied forth in the
early mornings each on an errand of mercy to succour those in need
of help or those who were in danger or distress.</p>

<p>It was only o' nights, sometimes, that an overwhelming desire
for cleanliness and nice clothes caused these English gentlemen to
cast aside their rags and to venture out into the open dressed in
clothes that would have caused the ragamuffins of Orange go snarl
at their heels like so many hungry curs.</p>

<p>They had been eight days in Orange now, and already architect
Caristie, with his wife and small son, the widow Colmars and her
daughter, and poor old General Paulieu with his family owed their
safety to this gallant League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. But there
was still more to do.</p>

<p>"We must get that child Fleurette out of that hell," the chief
had said, and since then brain and heart had been at work to find
the means to that end.</p>

<p>Later on Lord Tony had remarked: "I wish we could find out about
that father of hers; this man Armand. He seems to hold some kind of
position under this government of assassins, but I for one have
tried in vain to learn something more definite about him."</p>

<p>"I think," Sir Andrew Ffoulkes added, "that his position must be
a high one, or the girl would have been brought to trial before
now."</p>

<p>"Unless our amiable friend, M. Chauvelin, has got this Armand
under lock and key somewhere else," was my Lord Stowmaries' comment
upon the situation.</p>

<p>Sir Percy was silent. Frankly the position puzzled him. He would
have liked to get into touch with the man Armand, but for once he
and his friends were baffled by this anonymity which appeared so
closely guarded. Great then had been the rejoicing in the attic of
the derelict house in the Rue du Pont, when Lord Anthony
Dewhurst&mdash;a most perfect type of ruffian in rags and a thick
coating of grime&mdash;related his adventure with the mysterious
individual who, under cover of darkness and rain, had offered him
and his friend Rémi, fifty livres each for delivering a message to
a prisoner, who was none other than little Fleurette.</p>

<p>"At last we'll get in touch with the mysterious Armand," they
all declared eagerly. It was arranged that the chief would himself
take Fleurette's reply to the house in the Rue Longue. But go on
this errand in the filthy rags of a scavenger he would not.</p>

<p>"The night is pretty dark," he declared, "and I would rather the
mysterious Armand saw me as I am. I may also have a chance," he
added with his merriest laugh, "of coming across my good friend M.
Chambertin. It is some weeks since last we met, and not to have had
a pleasant chat with him all these days, while we were within a
stone's throw of one another, has been a sore trial to me. I caught
a glimpse of him a day or two ago, in the courtyard of the Caristie
House. He looked to be sick and out of sorts. A sight of me might
cheer him up."</p>

<p>"You won't take any risks, Blakeney," Sir Andrew Ffoulkes
remarked.</p>

<p>"Any number, my dear fellow," Sir Percy replied laughing. "And
you know you envy me, you dog. But I feel thoroughly selfish
to-night. I mean to take the note to Armand myself, and I mean to
take the privilege of having a little chat with my friend
Chambertin. And both these things I am going to do as an English
gentleman and not as a mudlark in stinking, filthy rags."</p>

<p>He had completed his toilet now, looked magnificent in clothes
cut by the leading London tailor, which set off his splendid figure
to perfection, with snow-white stock and speckless boots.</p>

<p>"If a single pair of eyes should see you," Sir Andrew insisted,
with an anxious sigh.</p>

<p>"I should have a whole pack of wolves at my heels," Blakeney
admitted. "But that wouldn't be the first time any of us have had
to run for our lives, eh? nor the first time we gave an entire pack
of them the slip."</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and took a last look at Fleurette's little
note which he had to deliver at the house in the Rue Longue.</p>

<p>"This man Armand must be a very decent fellow," he mused, "his
letter to the child was really fine in spirit as well as in
affection. Yes! he must be a decent fellow and we must get the girl
for his sake as much as for that of our friend Colombe. What?"</p>

<p>On that, of course, they were all agreed. The activities of the
League, since the rescue of General Paulieu and his family, were
centered now on Fleurette. There were still one or two minor points
to discuss, arrangements of detail to complete, but the main
project for the girl's rescue could not be determined until it was
definitely known whether her father, Armand, was going to be a help
or an hindrance.</p>

<p>"Anyway I shall know more," Blakeney said finally, as he made
for the door, "when I have sampled this man."</p>

<p>It was then nine o'clock in the evening. The night was dark and
stormy. Gusts of wind alternated with sharp showers of
rain&mdash;an altogether unusual state of weather for the time of
year in these parts. The few passers-by of respectable appearance
on their way home from business or work did no more than throw a
cursory glance on the tall figure that passed hurriedly by. A few
vagabonds clinging to their rags which the wind threatened to tear
off their meagre bodies, did perhaps pause, cowering against a dark
wall, murmuring a threat or a curse against the aristo, but an
unexpected coin slipped into their grimy hands, quickly silenced
both curse and threat.</p>

<p>Blakeney knew his way well through the streets of Orange. Having
kept along the river bank till he came to the bridge, he turned up
the Rue de la République. Glancing up at a house on his right, a
smile of pure joy lit up his anxious face. Three nights ago on this
spot, he had carried architect Caristie's small son in his arms,
while Caristie and his wife followed him down the street to the
market cart which awaited them at the top of the bridge. Three
hours later an officer of the revolutionary army was hammering at
the door of Caristie's lodgings, only to find that the birds had
flown. It had been a merry night, and merrier morning, while he,
Blakeney, drove the market cart out of the city with Caristie and
his wife concealed amidst the sacks of haricots and peas, and the
boy thrust into an empty oil-jar.</p>

<p>Well! something equally daring would have to be devised for the
girl Fleurette, and perhaps for her father, the mysterious Armand.
Blakeney, throwing back his head in the teeth of rain and wind,
drew a deep breath of delight. This was life in very truth. To
plan, to scheme, to accomplish. Alternately hare and hound, to
revel in this case with human lives as the goal. And if at times
the thought of beautiful Marguerite, lonely and anxious in far-off
England, caused a pang like a knife-thrust to his heart, her
soothing voice, her reassuring smile came to him as a swift vision
from the spirit-land to encourage and console. In suffering and
anxiety, as well as in the joy of reunion, Marguerite always
understood.</p>

<p>Now he turned from the Place de la République into the Rue
Longue, and the next couple of hundred yards brought him to the
house of Lucien Amouret, corn-chandler. The outside door was on the
latch. Pushing it open he found himself in a narrow hall, with an
inner door leading into the shop on his left and a staircase in
front of him. A lamp hung from the ceiling and shed a dim light on
stair and hall. From the shop came the sound of voices in
conversation, but though the stairs creaked under his tread, no one
came out to see whose the step might be.</p>

<p>Sir Percy ran lightly up the stairs, and on the first landing
came to the door, painted a slate grey. This part of the house
appeared silent and deserted; the upper floors wrapped in dead
gloom. A rusty bell-pull hung beside the door. Sir Percy gave it a
pull, and a discordant clang roused the sleeping echoes of the
chandler's house. A moment or two later he caught the sound of
shuffling footsteps, the door was opened, an old woman in cap and
shawl mutely inquired what the visitor desired.</p>

<p>"Is citizen Armand within?" Blakeney asked.</p>

<p>The woman, he thought, looked at him rather curiously for a
second or two, then shrugged her shoulders. Without wasting words
she shuffled off down a dimly lighted passage, leaving him to enter
or not, as he pleased. The next moment he heard a woman's
voice&mdash;the same woman probably&mdash;say: "An aristo is asking
to see Citizen Armand." Again a moment's silence, then the woman
came shuffling back, signed to him to enter and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"In there," she said laconically, and nodded towards the end of
the passage where a half open door revealed a shaft of more
brilliant light. Then she shuffled off again, presumably to her
kitchen, leaving the visitor to his own devices.</p>

<p>Sir Percy took off his hat and coat and laid them down on a
chair close by; he then walked the length of the passage to the
half-open door, pushed it open and found himself in a small room,
comfortably furnished, lighted by a lamp which stood upon a centre
table. The table was littered with papers. Behind it sat a man
writing. At sound of Sir Percy's footsteps he looked up. The eyes
of the two men met, and it almost seemed to one of them at least
that time for a few seconds stood still.</p>

<p>And then a pleasant laugh broke the silence, and a gentle lazy
voice said slowly:</p>

<p>"Egad! if it is not my engaging friend M. Chambertin! The gods
do indeed favour me, sir, for there's no man in the world I would
sooner have seen at this hour than your amiable self."</p>

<p>After the first paralysing second, Chauvelin had jumped to his
feet. He had thought that once again his feverish fancy was playing
his senses a mocking trick, that the face which ever haunted his
day-dreams and his sleepless nights had only come to him on the
wings of imagination. But the merry laugh, the lazy voice were all
too real. His enemy was truly there, not a vision, but a cruel,
mocking reality. Swiftly his claw-like hand shot out, fastened on an
object that lay amidst a litter of papers, and would have lifted
it, had not another slender and firm hand shot out likewise and
fastened itself upon his wrist with a grasp like a vice of
steel.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had the greatest difficulty in the world to smother a
cry of pain. His fingers opened, spread out fan-wise, the pistol
which he had seized fell back upon the litter of papers. With a
soft laugh Sir Percy sat down on the edge of the table, picked up
the pistol, withdrew the charge and swept it into the sand-box
close to his hand, the while Chauvelin watched him greedily,
hungrily, as a caged feline might watch a prey that was beyond its
reach.</p>

<p>A white-faced clock on the wall struck the half-hour. Sir Percy
laid the pistol down upon the table, and flicked his fine,
well-shaped hands one against the other.</p>

<p>"There now, my dear M. Chambertin," he said gaily, "we can
converse more comfortably together. Do you think it would have been
wise to put a charge of powder through your humble servant? We
should both of us have missed much of the zest of life."</p>

<p>"It is always your pleasure to mock, Sir Percy," Chauvelin said
with an effort. "There are various popular sayings which I might
recall to your mind, such as that the pitcher went once too often
to the well."</p>

<p>"And Sir Percy once too often to visit his friend M. Chambertin,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I think you will find that this is so," Chauvelin rejoined
trying, none too successfully, to ape his enemy's easy familiarity.
"Orange is not a healthy place for English spies these days."</p>

<p>"Possibly not," Blakeney retorted lightly. "Nor for some
unfortunate children of France, I am thinking."</p>

<p>"Traitors and spies, you are right there, Sir Percy. We have no
use for them in Orange&mdash;or elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Or for honest men, eh, my friend? for chaste women and innocent
children. That is why your humble servant and the league of which
methinks you know a thing or two, propose to remove these from this
polluted soil."</p>

<p>Chauvelin had rested his elbow on the table. His hand shading
his face against the glare of the lamp, effectually concealed its
varying expressions from the keen eyes of his enemy.</p>

<p>"You have not told me yet, Sir Percy," he said after a few
second's silence, "what procures me the honour of your visit at
this hour."</p>

<p>"Pure chance, my dear sir," Blakeney replied, "though the honour
is entirely mine. As a matter of fact I came to find one
Armand."</p>

<p>Twice did the pendulum of the white-faced clock tick the seconds
before Chauvelin said quietly:</p>

<p>"My colleague? Have you business with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Blakeney replied slowly. "I have a message for him."</p>

<p>"I can deliver it."</p>

<p>"Why not I? since I came on purpose."</p>

<p>"My colleague is absent."</p>

<p>"I can wait."</p>

<p>"From whom then is the message?"</p>

<p>"From his daughter."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>Once more there was a pause. The white-faced clock ticked on but
the two men were silent. Chauvelin's face was shaded by his hand,
and it needed all the energy, all the strength of his will to keep
that hand absolutely steady, not to allow a finger to tremble. In
the other hand he held a long quill pen and with it he traced a
geometrical pattern upon a blank sheet of paper. Sir Percy
Blakeney, still sitting on the edge of the table watched him,
motionless.</p>

<p>"Pretty drawing that," he said abruptly. And with a slender
finger pointed to the design that grew in intricate lines under
Chauvelin's aimless pen.</p>

<p>The other gave a start, the pen spluttered, scattering the ink
in spots all over the paper.</p>

<p>"There now, you have spoilt it," Sir Percy continued lightly. "I
had no idea you were such a master draughts-man."</p>

<p>Chauvelin threw down his pen. He had his nerves under control at
last, was able to drop his hand, to lean back in his chair, and
with both hands buried in the pockets of his breeches, to throw
back his head and look his enemy squarely in the face.</p>

<p>"About that message, Sir Percy," he said with well-feigned
indifference.</p>

<p>"What about it, my dear M. Chambertin?" Blakeney rejoined
lightly.</p>

<p>"My colleague, Citizen Armand, has been called away&mdash;to
Lyons on State business."</p>

<p>"But how unfortunate!" Sir Percy exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am sending a courier to Lyons this very night."</p>

<p>"Too late, my dear M. Chambertin! Too late, I fear!"</p>

<p>Chauvelin frowned. "What mean you by too late, Sir Percy?" he
asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Armand's daughter is sick, my dear M. Chambertin," Blakeney
rejoined, speaking very slowly, as if to weigh his every word.
"Before your courier can possibly reach Lyons, she will be
dead."</p>

<p>"My God!&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was the most heart-rending cry that had ever come from a
man's throat. Chauvelin had jumped to his feet; his two hands,
claw-like, as if carved in marble, gripped the arms of his chair;
his knees were shaking, his pale eyes stared like those of a
maniac, his cheeks were the colour of lead.</p>

<p>For the space of ten seconds he stood thus, with his whole body
quivering, his senses reeling, his eyes fixed on those finely
moulded lips that had dealt this appalling blow. Then slowly
consciousness returned, a veil seemed to be lifted from before his
eyes, knowledge had entered his brain. He knew that he had fallen
into the trap set for him by this astute adventurer. He realised
that he had betrayed the secret which he would have guarded with
his life.</p>

<p>"So," Sir Percy said at last very slowly, "'tis you are Citizen
Armand, and the sweetest flower that ever bloomed in this putrid
atmosphere has its roots in polluted soil?"</p>

<p>Still quite slowly and deliberately he drew Fleurette's note out
of the breast-pocket of his coat; for a second or two he held it
lightly between slender finger and thumb, then laid it on the table
in front of Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"She is not sick," he said quietly, "nor yet dying. If you have
not forgotten how to pray, man, pray to God now, pray with all your
might, that the same power which enabled you to torture my wife and
wellnigh to break her brave spirit, will aid you to save your
daughter from those tigers whom you have called your friends."</p>

<p>Chauvelin had sunk back in the chair. His head was buried in his
hands. Tumultuous thoughts rushed through his brain until he felt
that his reason must be tottering. A haze was before his eyes.
Perhaps it was caused by tears. Who knows? Only the recording angel
mayhap. Even wild beasts cry in agony when deprived of their
young.</p>

<p>Only after a few minutes did he become aware of the note penned
by his little Fleurette and laid in front of him by his bitterest
foe. The Scarlet Pimpernel! The only man in all the world who might
perhaps have saved Fleurette, who would have saved Fleurette, if
he, Chauvelin, had not betrayed the secret of his heart.</p>

<p>Like one waking from a dream, Chauvelin picked up the note, and
looked fearfully about him, dreading to meet those mocking lazy
eyes, which, no doubt, at this hour gleamed with malicious
triumph.</p>

<p>But Sir Percy Blakeney was no longer there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>The stage was now set for the last act of the tragedy, which the
chief actor himself knew could only end one way. He had schemed and
planned until he felt that his reason would give way, until he
feared that he would lose the nerve and the power of which he had
such sore need. He had thought of everything, weighed every
possibility from the bribing of prison warders, to the
suppression&mdash;by murder if need be&mdash;of the two witnesses
Godet and Adèle. He had thought of turning the tables on Pochart
and Danou, by launching accusations against them. But all these
plans had to be rejected one by one. Fleurette liberated to-day
through the success of one or the other of these schemes would only
be re-arrested on the morrow. The suppression of the witnesses, the
arrest of his more powerful enemies, would only rouse more bitter
antagonism against himself and failing in the end to save his
Fleurette, would end in precipitating her doom.</p>

<p>Driven by despair, he had at one time pinned his hopes of
salvation for the child on the possible interference of the Scarlet
Pimpernel, but even that fond and foolish hope had been shattered
by his betrayal of his jealously guarded secret. What was there
left to hope for? That his power was great enough at the Tribunal
to force an acquittal in spite of the witnesses, in spite of
Pochart and Danou and all the mob whom they had already gathered
round them. The Public Prosecutor, a man of his own making, would
not dare to side against him. But there was the populace, the
rabble, the swinish multitude, who, now that even the worst type of
venal and corrupt jury had been abolished, were judges and jury,
advocate and prosecutor all in one. The last word always rested
with them, and Pochart and Danou, egged on by envy and revenge,
would know how to sway the rabble.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was not the man to indulge in illusions. He knew well
enough&mdash;none better&mdash;that the passions of hatred and of
spite which he himself had engendered and fostered in the hearts of
his fellowmen, were turned against him, as they had been turned on
all the makers of this bloody revolution, on your Brissots and your
Carriers, your Philippe d'Orléans, and your great Danton. They
would destroy his exquisite Fleurette as effectually as they had
destroyed thousands of others, equally innocent.</p>

<p>And now the end had come. No longer could the day be put off.
President Legrange and Public Prosecutor Isnard might be arriving
in Paris any hour when the new aerial telegraph might be set in
motion, or a courier sent down to Orange poste-haste and burst the
bubble of Chauvelin's machinations.</p>

<p>And then on that afternoon of the 15th of June two things
occurred. To begin with when the Public Prosecutor placed before
him the printed forms of accusation with the names left in blank,
and with them a list of the names of those awaiting trial,
Chauvelin with a hand that appeared quite steady, wrote in one
blank spaces the name of Fleur Chauvelin, <i>nommée</i> Armand.
Secondly when, an hour later, the captain of the guard stood in the
courtyard of the Caristie house reading out the names of those who
were to stand their trial on the morrow, Fleurette heard the sound
of her own name.</p>

<p>She was not frightened, nor did she weep. Tears were a thing of
the past for her. Twenty days had gone by since she had been happy,
more than a fortnight since she had been brought into this house
and deprived of air and sunlight and joy. One by one those who had
been kind to her in this prison house had gone: Claire de
Châtelard, Madame de Mornas, poor Eugénie Blanc, and kind M. de
Bollène. Their names had been on the roll-call. The next day they
were gone, and Fleurette never saw them again. Lately she had been
lonely too. No one had taken the place in her unsophisticated heart
of Claire de Châtelard. The only friend she had left was the
warder's aide, the rough scavenger who had brought her the two
welcome letters. Amédé's and Bibi's. He still continued his antics,
joined in the gruesome mummeries which still went on in the common
room, and Fleurette somehow had a sense of re-assurance when he was
nigh. But this night of all nights, after she had heard the captain
of the guard read her name upon the roll-call, her grimy friend was
not there. Fleurette missed him, and disappointment over his
absence was the only sorrowful feeling of which she felt conscious,
when she realised that her fate would be decided on the morrow.</p>

<p>She was not afraid. Had not Bibi enjoined her, begged her to
trust him and not to be afraid? She wondered when she would be
allowed to see Bibi, whether he would be there to-morrow, at her
trial, encouraging her with his presence and with his glance when
she was made to stand before the judge. She knew that in a sense
she had done wrong. She had taken Madame's valuables and handed
them over to Amédé. This she had no right to do, and since Adèle
had seen her with M'sieur Amédé that evening, and spoken ill of her
because of that, she supposed that she would be punished. It was
only vaguely that she marvelled what the punishment would be. But
she was not afraid because she trusted Bibi. Nor did she regret her
actions. If it had all to be done over again, she would act in
precisely the same way. The mysterious voice often rang in her ear
even now. She had obeyed the commands of <i>le bon Dieu</i>, and it
was <i>le bon Dieu</i> who had chosen a still more mysterious way
for saving M'sieur Amédé from the consequences of her actions.</p>

<p>Thus did Fleurette envisage the day that was to come, with love
and trust in her heart for Bibi, and the certainty after all these
trials and tribulations of a happy reunion with him and old Louise
at Lou Mas.</p>

<p>Not to mention the reunion with M'sieur Amédé.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>The first thing that struck Fleurette's perceptions when she
entered that huge room, was that up at the further end of
it&mdash;upon a raised platform and behind a tall desk, sat Bibi
chéri himself. Two other men sat there with him, but Fleurette
hardly saw them. It was on Bibi that she looked. She had slept very
little during the night. Excitement had kept her awake, as well as
the tears and lamentation of two of her room-mates who were to
appear with her this day before the tribunal.</p>

<p>And it was Bibi who was to be her judge. Well then obviously she
had nothing to fear. One of some fifteen of her fellow-prisoners,
she was bustled with them across the room to a wooden bench where
they were roughly ordered to sit down. As they crossed the room
boos and hisses, and one or two louder cries of execration, greeted
them. A few remarks, all of them malevolent, rose above the
murmurs.</p>

<p>"That old man there, I knew him once. Old tyrant. He's getting
his deserts at last."</p>

<p>"Do you see the woman next to him? Five free-born Frenchwomen
she had at a time once, to wait on her and do her hair. Aristo, va!
It won't take long to do thy hair to-morrow. One snick with the
scissors, what?"</p>

<p>"That young wench too. Not much more than eighteen, I
warrant."</p>

<p>"I hear she is a thief as well as a traitor."</p>

<p>"Pity they should have abolished the whipping-post. That would
have done the young traitors a world of good."</p>

<p>"Me, I prefer the guillotine; quickest work, eh?"</p>

<p>Fleurette had blushed with shame to the roots of her hair. She
tried not to look in the direction whence these voices, harsh and
coarse had come. She tried to think of M'sieur Amédé and of the joy
she would have when she saw him again. But she could not shut the
gates of her consciousness against all these people who had
gathered here for the sole purpose of seeing their fellow-creatures
suffer. Men and women and even little children. The women for the
most part had brought their knitting, for every one was knitting
socks these days for the brave soldiers who were fighting against
the enemies of France, and through the murmur of voices, the
monotonous click-click of the needles acted as an irritant upon the
nerves.</p>

<p>All around there appeared to be a sea of faces. And eyes.
Innumerable eyes that glared, and mouths that grinned and decided.
And above the faces, a sea of red caps with tricolour cockades.
Fleurette tried hard not to look. She closed her eyes and tried to
murmur the prayers she and M'sieur Amédé used to say together when
M. le Curé prepared them for their first communion.</p>

<p>Bibi wore a hat with feathers. He had a bell in front of him,
and this he often tinkled, when the noise from the crowd all around
became too great. Once or twice he was addressed as "Citizen
President." Fleurette had never seen him look so stern. The words
which he spoke to the accused were not only bitter but terribly
cruel. He seemed so unlike her real chéri Bibi, that she caught
herself marvelling whether her fancy was not playing her aching
eyes some strange and horrible trick.</p>

<p>One after the other the names of her fellow-prisoners were
called, and one by one they were made to stand up and then walk to
the centre of the room and up a couple of shallow steps to a small
raised platform round which there was a wooden railing. In every
instance as soon as the prisoner mounted this platform, and became
as it were the centre of attraction for all these innumerable eyes,
he or she would be greeted with groans and hisses and cat's calls,
until Bibi tinkled his bell and loudly demanded silence.</p>

<p>A man in a red cap who sat just below Bibi's desk then stood up
and read something out aloud, which Fleurette never understood, but
which the crowd apparently did, for the reader was frequently
interrupted by more boos and hisses and often cries of execration.
After this reading Bibi, or one of the two men who sat beside him,
asked the prisoner questions. These were sometimes replied to, but
not always. The crowd invariably threw in loud comments on both
questions and answers, and Bibi was then forced to tinkle his bell
in order to demand silence. And through the noise, the sound that
was never drowned, and never was still, was the click-click of
hundreds of knitting needles.</p>

<p>The first batch of prisoners to face the Tribunal, were men and
women almost unknown to Fleurette. They had not long been brought
into the Caristie House, had replaced others who had been
Fleurette's early companions in prison. She had seen them in the
common room, acting in the grim farces that were the fashion there,
but she had not made friends with them as she had done with Claire
de Châtelard or Madame de Mornas. But when came the turn of a woman
who had actually been her room-mate, who had sat next to her on the
bench of the accused, and squeezed her hand ere she was led up to
the raised platform with the wooden railing, then, Fleurette felt
all her resolution of bravery and trust in Bibi, giving way.</p>

<p>The heat in the room had become unbearable. The stench of dank
and grimy clothes, of perspiring humanity, of hot breaths charged
with hate, acted as a pungent soporific. Fleurette's head fell
forward once or twice, her eyes involuntarily closed. For a time
she lost consciousness. It was her own name spoken in a stentorian
voice that brought her back to reality.</p>

<p>"Fleur Chauvelin, nommée Armand."</p>

<p>Some one nudged her elbow. An impatient voice rasped out a
sharp: "Allons! allons!" and she found herself dragged to her feet
and led by the arm to the raised platform, amidst a din which
fortunately was too great to allow her ears to catch individual
sounds.</p>

<p>She looked straight across to Bibi, who was as pale as a waxen
image.</p>

<p>"Fleur Chauvelin, nommée Armand."</p>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>There is no doubt that everything would have gone well, had it
not been for Fleurette herself. Perhaps "well" is the wrong word:
"differently" would be better. Nothing could have gone "well,"
because even though Chauvelin had succeeded in obtaining an
acquittal, his enemies would have returned immediately to the
charge, and forced on the girl's re-arrest even before she had left
the Tribunal. There had been cases during the past few weeks, in
Paris, in Lyons and so on, when prisoners were acquitted and
re-arrested, re-tried, acquitted again, and again re-arrested. A
regular cat-and-mouse game, at which Chauvelin himself was an
adept. Nevertheless with a first acquittal there might have been
some hope. And he practically had obtained that acquittal, when
Fleurette herself ruined her chance and caused her own
condemnation. Chauvelin could have struck her for her folly. His
love for her always pertained to that of a wild beast for its
young; the instinct to devour in moments of peril. If she was
destined to perish, then it should be by his own hand, not as a
spectacle for the rabble to gloat on.</p>

<p>The <i>Moniteur</i> of the 22nd Messidor gives one or two
interesting details concerning the trial of a country girl named
Fleur Chauvelin, daughter of a Citizen Armand Chauvelin of the
Central Committee of Public Safety, and member of the National
Convention, and relates at full length the extraordinary incidents
which marked its close. Looking back upon that memorable day, and
on the solemn hour which saw the girl Fleur Chauvelin, nommée
Armand called to the bar of the accused, we visualise Chauvelin the
father, presiding over that Tribunal of infamy, and having sent
within the last half-hour half a dozen fellow-creatures callously
to death, now seeing his own daughter, the only being in all the
world whom he had ever loved, standing there before him, accused,
condemned already in the eyes of the canaille.</p>

<p>There was no time wasted during the proceedings, wherein the
accused was allowed neither jury nor advocate. The State as
represented by its three nominees who sat as judges, was judge and
jury and prosecutor all in one. It was men like Chauvelin who had
invented this travesty of justice and eliminated all procedure
devised by civilisation for the protection of the accused.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor opened the proceedings by reading the
indictment in mechanical monotone; it was identically the same as
that framed against hundreds of others&mdash;guilty or innocent
alike&mdash;the printed formula invented by the odious
Foucquier-Tinville in which the words "Traitor" and "Enemy of the
Republic" were alone intelligible. All else was a jumble of words.
The crowd was not listening. Their attention was fixed on the
accused whose modest bearing and spotless attire seemed to arouse
their spite and their derision, more than the rags and filth
displayed by a previous prisoner had done.</p>

<p>When the reading of the indictment came to an end, Pochart
sitting beside the Presiding Judge asked the usual question:</p>

<p>"Is the prisoner accused publicly or in secret?"</p>

<p>And the Public Prosecutor replied: "Publicly."</p>

<p>Danou, the third judge then asked: "By whom?"</p>

<p>And again the Public Prosecutor gave reply:</p>

<p>"By one Adèle," he said, "of unknown parentage, and Citizen
Lieutenant Godet of the revolutionary army."</p>

<p>"And to what will these persons testify?"</p>

<p>"To the treason committed against the State by the accused and
to her connection with the enemies of the Republic."</p>

<p>After which Adèle was called. Her small rat-like face looked wan
and pinched; her hands trembled visibly, and she wiped them
continually against the ragged apron which she wore. She was
obviously very nervous and never looked once in the direction of
the accused, but she spoke clearly enough in a shrill, high-pitched
voice. Questioned at first by the Public Prosecutor, she presently
embarked more glibly upon her story, relating the events which were
intended to condemn Fleurette. Chauvelin already knew the tale by
heart. The soldiers on the ridge. The raid on the château.
Fleurette's halt that evening in the cottage of the widow Tronchet.
Her assignation, through Adèle, with Amédé Colombe. The casket and
wallet underneath her shawl, then transferred into young Colombe's
keeping.</p>

<p>Ofttimes Chauvelin tried to break into the girl's narrative; he
put stern questions to her, tried to intimidate her, to trip her
into misstatements or obvious contradictions. But Adèle held her
ground. Informer, ingrate, wanton though she was, she was speaking
the truth and was not to be shaken. Hisses and boos from the crowd
oft greeted the President's cross-questionings, cries of
approbation greeted Adèle's spirited rejoinders. In the wordy
warfare between herself and Chauvelin, she scored nearly every
time. Encouraged by the sympathy of the rabble, she lost her
nervousness, whilst he gradually lost his self-control. He had so
much at stake, and she nothing but the satisfaction of vanity and
of spite.</p>

<p>"Be not intimidated, citizeness," Pochart put in forcefully at
one moment, "let not powerful influences sway you from your
duty."</p>

<p>"Vas-y, Adèle of unknown parentage!" one of the women shouted
from above. "'Twas some aristo doubtless who betrayed thy mother.
Let this aristo at least pay for her kind."</p>

<p>Amidst thunderous applause Adèle stepped down from the bar.
Chauvelin tried in vain to command silence, he was shouted down by
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Thou'rt a true patriot, Citizen Chauvelin," one woman called
out lustily. "To have a traitor for a daughter is a curse. Her
death will not be for thee a sacrifice."</p>

<p>He waited in seeming patience, white to the lips, until the
tumult had subsided, then calling all his reserves of strength,
moral and mental, to his aid, he said in a calm firm voice:</p>

<p>"The witness has lied. The events which she has described could
not have taken place in her presence seeing that on that day and at
that hour she was in my house, at Lou Mas, half a league away."</p>

<p>This pronouncement was greeted with mighty uproar. Derisive
laughter, cat's calls, whistling, strident shouts made riotous
confusion. Only two persons in the room appeared serene. One was
the accused, the other her judge. The <i>Moniteur</i> says that
throughout the whole proceedings the attitude of the accused was
astonishingly calm: "d'une sérénité êtonnante." She looked straight
before her, sometimes at the President, but more often her eyes
appeared to be fixed on the tricolour flag draped over the wall
above his head, and ornamented with a red cap and the words writ
largely: "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ou la Mort."</p>

<p>And so too was the President equally serene. Outwardly. He stood
upright whilst the turmoil continued, with head erect and hands
held behind his back. Insults and jeers flew at him from every
side. But he never winced. The rabble called him, "Traitor, Liar,
Tyrant!" and various other names impossible to record. But he
waited in seeming patience, until the crowd, eager to hear more,
fell to comparative stillness once more. Then Pochart's rasping
voice cut through the silence, like the sound of a file against
metal.</p>

<p>"You'll have to substantiate that statement Citizen President,"
he said.</p>

<p>"My statements need no substantiation," Chauvelin retorted
coolly. "The word of a representative of the people is sufficient
against any witness."</p>

<p>And while Pochart was considering a suitable repartee, Danou put
in smoothly:</p>

<p>"Should we not hear the next witness, citizen Lieutenant Godet,
before we discuss the matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" the crowd yelled in response.</p>

<p>Scenting the unusual, the crowd was more excited than was its
wont. Of late these hasty trials, six to the hour, with
condemnation as a foregone conclusion, had become monotonous. One
condemnation had been very much like another. But here was
something novel. The rumour had already spread like wildfire that
the accused was no less than the daughter of the President, Citizen
Chauvelin, who was well-known in the councils of State, a prominent
member of many committees, and, some said, a personal friend of the
great Robespierre. Here in truth was a test of supreme patriotism;
a judge called upon to condemn his own daughter if she be guilty.
And of course she was guilty, or she would not be here. There was
no sympathy for either of them, only interest in the issue of this
amazing trial. The crowd did not like the prisoner's attitude, what
they called her aristocratic airs and disdainful ways; even the
children pointed grimy little fingers at her and hurled the
poisonous darts of loathsome epithets at the aristo.</p>

<p>Thus was the scene prepared for the entrance of Lieutenant
Godet, who stepped up to the witness' platform with a display of
self-assurance and a swagger that charmed the women. He was a man
after their own heart, a real sans culotte in grimy rags, unkempt,
un-shaved, unwashed, the type of which the martyr Jean Paul Marat
had been the most perfect exponent.</p>

<p>Conversations, objurgations, murmurs even were stilled; the
click-click of knitting needles alone made a soft accompaniment to
Citizen Godet's replies to the Public Prosecutor's preliminary
questions. It was indeed a remarkable, an amazing, an almost
unbelievable tale, which he had to tell. And gradually as he
unfolded the various details of this extraordinary adventure a hush
fell over the crowded room, very like the calm which nature assumes
ere she sends forth the thunders of her wrath.</p>

<p>Godet, still with this air of self-assurance, related how he and
the soldiers under his command, as well as the whole commune of
Laragne had been tricked by a band of English spies whose actions
proved them to have been in league with Amédé Colombe and with the
accused. He told of the magnificently dressed soldiers. Their raid
on the premises of Colombe the grocer of the Rue Haute. Their march
through the village. Their captain's swagger. His orders to
himself, Godet, and to the real soldiers of the revolutionary
army.</p>

<p>Still the crowd gave no sign of approbation, or disapprobation.
Only that ominous, expectant hush which presaged a storm. The
accused always serene, smiled&mdash;so the <i>Moniteur</i>
avers&mdash;as she encountered the President's glance. Smiled
cheerfully and trustfully. But the President's face was
inscrutable, and the colour of wax.</p>

<p>And then Godet went on to relate the long, weary tramp along the
mountain roads. The dust. The fatigue. The want of food. He told
how the <i>ci-devant</i> Frontenac and Amédé Colombe wrested from
the hands of justice, were presently taken to some unknown place of
safety, while the soldiers of the Republic were left by the wayside
to perish of fatigue or inanition.</p>

<p>He had finished speaking, and still the click-click of the
knitting needles was the only sound that broke the silence. The
witness, sensing this silence, feeling its menace, had lost
something of his arrogance; the hand with which he stroked his
shaggy moustache trembled perceptibly. The accused, overcome by the
heat, wiped her forehead with the corner of her apron, then she
smiled once more across at her father.</p>

<p>And suddenly through the solemn stillness a woman's shrill voice
was raised:</p>

<p>"Those English spies did make a fool of thee, I am thinking,
Citizen Godet!"</p>

<p>This suddenly relieved the tension. It was like a dam let loose.
In a moment every kind of call and of cry of laughter and of groan
rang from end to end of the room.</p>

<p>"The English have made a fool of thee!"</p>

<p>Within a minute or two this became a general cry, accompanied by
the stamping of feet, and loud and prolonged laughter, both
malevolent and derisive. Godet, ludicrous in his bewilderment,
rolled terror-filled eyes, whilst vainly trying to raise his voice
above the din. The <i>Moniteur</i> says definitely that the accused
put her hands to her ears. The uproar was in truth deafening.</p>

<p>A few moments of this confusion, and the next, Chauvelin was on
his feet clanging his bell. His stentorian voice rose above the
tumult, demanded silence, and in the lull that presently ensued,
that same voice now subdued to a lower, though no less impressive
key, rang clear and calm.</p>

<p>"Is it not an insult, citizen patriots to ask you to listen to
the words of a fool, when the life of a French girl is at
stake?"</p>

<p>The passionate earnestness with which he spoke, the burning
indignation expressed in that calm, subdued voice, had the effect
of awing the screaming rabble. They turned to gaze on him, as he
stood there, facing them all, calm, proud, almost majestic, despite
his small stature. Seizing this sudden advantage he began to speak.
Without a gesture, hardly raising his voice, he began quietly, not
choosing his words, or striving after eloquence, but only as a man
speaking to his friends. And by one of those inexplicable reactions
which will so often change the temper of a crowd, men, women and
children ceased to curse and to deride. The innumerable eyes were
fixed with more curiosity than malevolence upon him, the mouths,
agape, uttered no further groan, and once more the click-click of
knitting needles was momentarily stilled.</p>

<p>"Citizens," he said, "you have heard two witnesses against the
accused. One of these, the wench Adèle I myself, representative of
the people, have convicted of deliberate falsehood, spoken to the
prejudice of a French patriot. The other your own words have
condemned for a fool, and an easy tool in the hands of English
spies. You called him a fool, citizens, but I call him a traitor.
Lieutenant Godet was not a tool in the hands of the English spies,
he was their confederate, their help. Can you bring yourselves to
believe, citizens, that a loyal soldier of the Republic could be
deceived by false uniforms, by French words spoken by alien lips?
Can you believe this story of a forced march, of starvation by the
wayside in the company of English spies whose every action, every
word, every gesture almost, must have betrayed them as the
foreigners they actually were. Citizens, I appeal to that
reputation for clear thinking and for logic, for which French men
and women are famous throughout the world. At this hour when our
beloved country is threatened on every side, is this the time, I
say, for allowing yourselves to be duped by traitors who would sell
you and your land, your dues and your liberty for English
gold&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No! no!" came a lusty shout in response. And the crowd took up
the cry. "No! We'll not sell our liberties for English gold."</p>

<p>"Say on, citizen representative."</p>

<p>Pochart had jumped to his feet; once or twice he had tried to
break in on Chauvelin's peroration, with cries of: "Thou'rt
slandering a soldier of the Republic!" or: "Traitor! thou'rt in
league with thy daughter!"</p>

<p>But he was not listened to. There was something about Chauvelin
which fascinated the mob. His white, calm face, his pale, piercing
eyes, his voice, dull, even monotonous, but penetrating to the most
distant corners of the room. And there was also that welcome
element of novelty. This pleased the women. Trials and
condemnations in incessant routine had begun to pall. Here was
something new. Witnesses summoned, then discredited, and finally
accused. Such a thing had never been witnessed before in
Orange.</p>

<p>And so the crowd would not listen to Pochart or Danou, they
wanted to hear Chauvelin; they did not particularly wish to see
Fleurette <i>nommée</i> Armand acquitted, but they did relish the
prospect of the two witnesses being sent to the bench of the
accused. That was novelty for them, and it was what they wanted for
the moment. Moreover they did think that the citizen lieutenant
with all his swagger had been such a consummate fool, if no worse,
that it would be distinctly amusing to see that stupid head of his
roll down into the basket of the guillotine.</p>

<p>Neither Pochart nor Danou, however, were men to give up the
struggle quite so easily. In the fight against the representative
on special mission, who had threatened them and lorded it over them
for so long, they only contemplated one issue: victory. Victory!
which would mean satisfaction of pride and of revenge. They had set
out to win and did not consider themselves beaten. Not yet. Already
Pochart was on his feet, and his rasping voice rose booming above
the tumult. As soon as a slight lull gave him an opportunity he
seized it, and cried in thunderous accents:</p>

<p>"Citizens! Frenchmen! French women! All of you!" And then again:
"Citizens all! Let me put the same question to you, that the
President asked you just now: will you allow yourselves to be
duped? Will you go like sheep whithersoever traitors may lead
you?"</p>

<p>The crowd murmured and shrugged shoulders, would have shouted
Pochart down only that the rasping voice of his rose above the cry
of: "A la lanterne, all traitors and fools!"</p>

<p>Pointing an accusing finger at Chauvelin, Pochart took up the
cry.</p>

<p>"So say I," he roared in a terrific straining of his powerful
lungs: "A la lanterne all the traitors who try to throw dust in
your eyes. Have you forgotten that the citizen President is the
father of the accused? And that he knows well enough that if the
child be guilty, then is the parent guilty too? To save himself he
is trying to shield a traitor. Do not allow yourselves to be duped
by him. Look on the citizen President, my friends, and ask him how
it comes about that he lavished all the treasures of his eloquence
upon this one traitor, when yesterday and the day before that, he
sent to the guillotine every man, woman and child who came before
the Tribunal, and on a mere suspicion of treason."</p>

<p>A dull murmur greeted this peroration. There had been something
in Pochart's eloquence which caused the crowd not to veer round
just yet, but at any rate to look on the President of the Tribunal
with rather less awe, and something approaching suspicion.</p>

<p>"That is true," a woman said loudly. "The President showed no
mercy to traitors yesterday. And it is treason now to be as much as
suspected of treason, we've been told."</p>

<p>"It is my duty to protect the innocent," Chauvelin retorted
firmly, "as well as to punish the guilty."</p>

<p>"Methinks," Danou now broke in, and his slow, and suave tones
came in strange contrast to the clamorous eloquence of his
colleagues: "methinks that the traitor Danton made some such remark
too, ere justice put her hand on him."</p>

<p>"Danton was a traitor, and thou too, Citizen Danou, art a
traitor for speaking his name in this hall of justice."</p>

<p>"Justice!" Pochart cried, pallid with rage, for he had felt that
the word "traitor" hurled at Danou was meant to strike him also.
"Justice! hark at the traitor, who should be standing in the dock
beside his brood."</p>

<p>"Vas-y, Citizen President," the woman cried excitedly. "It is
thy turn now."</p>

<p>They had cast aside their knitting, so palpitating had this duel
become between these three men. Insensate, doltish as they were,
they scented the tragedy that underlay this wordy warfare; they
guessed that the man who presided over this infamous tribunal and
who with a casual stroke of the pen had sent hundreds
indiscriminately to death, had one soft corner in his callous
heart, and that his colleagues, consumed with envy and hatred were
hitting at that vulnerable spot and had already succeeded in making
him writhe in agony.</p>

<p>At the same time, such is the psychology of a multitude as
against that of individuals, there was still a wave of sympathy
tending in the direction of this father fighting so desperately for
the life of his child. Strictly speaking it was not sympathy,
rather was it mere instinctive understanding of family ties. Five
years of this awful revolution, during which every cruel lust in
man or woman had been sedulously fostered, every softer mood
repressed, had not yet succeeded in crushing altogether that
feeling for family solidarity which is the most distinctive
characteristic of the French nation. And this spectacle of a father
sitting in judgment over his own child, actually expressed to
pronounce the death-sentence over her, did undoubtedly for the time
being sway the crowd in his favour. He was given a more respectful
hearing than either of his colleagues or either of the witnesses,
and when Godet's name recurred on the tapis, it was greeted with
derisive cries of "Cet imbécile!" and when Adèle was mentioned,
most of the women shouted spitefully: "Liar!"</p>

<p>Chauvelin, sensitive of course to the slightest wavering in the
temper of the populace, felt his advantage and strained every nerve
to press it home. The whole situation was of course terribly
precarious. At any moment a look, a word, a false move on his part,
might cause the crowd to veer right over against him. Even after an
acquittal sometimes, the populace would suddenly demand that the
accused be re-arrested: a second trial, more of a mockery and a
travesty of justice than the first, would be insisted on, after
which condemnation was a foregone conclusion. All this Chauvelin
knew, none better, and there were moments when he felt as if
madness or death were preferable to this terrible fight that in the
end could have but one issue. And yet fight he must, fight for
every inch of ground, fight with the last breath in his body, and
with it silence the vituperations of those fiends who had raised
their noisome voices against his Fleurette.</p>

<p>Even now Pochart was on his feet again, shouting, gesticulating,
banging his fist upon the table.</p>

<p>"Citizens," he reiterated for the third time, "do not let
yourselves be duped by men who are ruining your country by
pandering to traitors. Look at the accused! I say she is nothing
but a wanton, who should be tied to the whipping-post ere she be
sent to the guillotine. Look at the aristocrat, I say, with the
demure airs and the folded kerchief; she, forsooth, goes forth o'
nights to meet her lover under the almond-trees, there to concoct
treason with her lover against the Republic. She was seen,
remember, seen, I say, in spite of what interested parties may
aver. You have heard the witness, a humble, simple girl, the victim
of aristocratic lust and of tyranny. That witness spoke the truth.
She saw the accused and her lover at dead of night whispering and
embracing. I ask you, does a clean-minded, respectable woman,
citizen of our glorious Republic, spend her nights in the company
of her lover? Rather is it not the wanton, the traitor, who shuns
the light of day and seeks the darkness, for the hatching of
treasonable plots against the State? Look at the witness, citizens.
Humbly and simply did she speak the truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She lied as well you know it, Citizen Pochart," Chauvelin broke
in forcefully. "Liar, forger and thief, I decree her accused and
command that she stand her trial for these offences against the
Republic. Look at her, my friends, citizens all," he went on, and
pointed an accusing finger at Adèle whose pinched little face had
become the colour of lead, and who sat in a corner of the witness'
bench, cowering within herself, her trembling hands, now and then,
lifting a handkerchief to wipe the sweat of terror that had risen
to her brow. "Look at her," Chauvelin continued, appealing to the
sea of faces before him: "And now look at the accused. She is
serene, because she is innocent; whilst the guilty trembles because
she knows her treachery has come to light at last. Look at those
two women, citizens, and yourselves pronounce which is the traitor
and which is the stainless."</p>

<p>Of a truth all would have been well after that. Chauvelin passed
a quivering hand across his brow. It was streaming with moisture.
The strain had been immense. Mentally he felt broken by the effort.
But he also felt that for the moment at least he had won the day.
The <i>Moniteur</i> states definitely that: "il y eût tout lieu de
croire qu'un acquittement eût été applaudi." At any rate the
applause at the moment was deafening, and if Chauvelin could have
obtained a hearing for another sixty seconds he would have put the
acquittal to the populace vote, and, as the <i>Moniteur</i> says,
it would have been carried.</p>

<p>What would have happened afterwards nobody can say. The most
fickle entity in the world is a multitude, and of all the
multitudes, an audience watching the suffering of a fellow-creature
is the most fickle and the most callous. For the next two or three
minutes at any rate, Chauvelin held the sympathy of the crowd.
Fleurette did not count either way. For the spectators of this
heart-rending pageant she was just a thing, an insentient object
placed there for their entertainment, the pivot round which circled
their excitement. But Chauvelin, the father pleading for his
daughter's life had won their sympathy&mdash;the sympathy of
tiger-cats, satiated for the moment and licking their chops in the
intervals of snarling.</p>

<p>All then would have been well but for the action of one of the
sympathisers who stood leaning up against the wall in the crowd; a
giant he was, coated with grime&mdash;coal heaver or scavenger
probably, only half clad in ragged shirt and torn breeches, with
dirty feet thrust stockingless into sabots, a red worsted cap over
his unkempt hair, his face streaked with sweat and coal-dust. In
one hand he held a large raw carrot which he was munching with loud
snapping of the jaws and smacking of the lips. He was one of the
noisiest in his approval of the President's peroration.</p>

<p>"Vas-y, Précident," he shouted. "A la lanterne, the fools and
traitors. Where is that trollop? Let her stand up. We want to look
at her, eh, citizens?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! we want to see her! Stand up, Adèle of unknown
parentage! Let's look at you."</p>

<p>The women, or course, were the loudest in their demand for the
unfortunate Adèle. Bred by misery, often out of degradation,
trained by five years of an execrable revolution, the women of
France were not féministes these days. The spectacle of one of
their own sex on the guillotine gave them more satisfaction than
that of a man. Now they wanted to see Adèle of the pinched,
rat-like face, Adèle with the trembling hands and the shrinking
shoulders, they wanted to see her squirm before their wrath, they
wanted to see her wriggle like a worm prodded with a pin.
Incidentally they had almost for gotten Fleurette.</p>

<p>Louder and even louder they clamoured for Adèle, and at an order
from the President, two soldiers of the National guard did
presently drag Adèle from the corner of the witness' bench where
she was cowering like a frightened rodent, and dragged her&mdash;or
rather carried her&mdash;to the bar of the accused. The crowd
seeing that its dictates were being obeyed, restrained its frenzy
for an instant and, through the comparative stillness that ensued,
a piercing shriek rang out from the unfortunate Adèle.</p>

<p>"Mercy! Mercy!" she cried, and struggled fiercely to free
herself from the men's grasp. "I am innocent! I spoke the
truth."</p>

<p>A thunderous shout of derisive laughter greeted her cry. The
women, with their hands on their knees, were literally rocking with
laughter. They thought that Adèle with a face like a rat, wisps of
lank hair poking out from underneath her cap which sat all awry,
with mouth wide open uttering shrieks which no one could hear
through the deafening tumult, was supremely funny.</p>

<p>The President made no attempt to quell the disturbance. It was
all to the good. The greater the hatred against Adèle, the greater
his chance, not only of forcing wave of sympathy for himself at
full-tide, until he had the opportunity of getting Fleurette out of
Orange. He was striving with all his might to catch his darling's
eye. But Fleurette's glance was fixed on Adèle. She seemed to him
to be fascinated with horror, mute and paralysed. She was looking
on Adèle, and her dear little hand was fidgeting the corner of her
kerchief.</p>

<p>Through the ear-splitting uproar led by the women, Pochart and
Danou, their sympathisers, men of their own choosing, vainly tried
to get a hearing. As well try to shout down a tempestuous sea as
these hundreds of women gloating over the spectacle of one of their
own sex writhing in an agony of terror.</p>

<p>"Hein!" came in a stentorian shout from the grimy giant in the
rear of the crowd; "thou wouldst slander the innocent girl with
lies. Take that for thy pains."</p>

<p>And he hurled the remnant of his raw carrot over the head of the
intervening crowd at the unfortunate Adèle.</p>

<p>It missed her by a hairbreadth, but the action delighted the
crowd. They took up the cry: "Take that for thy pains!" and sent
various missiles flying at the girl, who, crouching down on her
knees, lay there like a bundle of goods just below the bar of the
accused where Fleurette stood, gazing down at her, fascinated with
horror.</p>

<p>Looking back later on that terrible moment, Chauvelin felt that
it was the action of the grimy coal-heaver&mdash;or scavenger,
whatever he was&mdash;that precipitated the catastrophe. He it was
who egged on the rabble to virulent hatred against Adèle. It was he
who by hurling that first missile at the girl brought in a further,
more immense element of cruelty and horror into the situation.
Certain it is that up to that moment Fleurette had appeared more
dazed than horrified. She must even in her own gentle heart have
felt a burning indignation against Adèle for the treacherous part
which she had played, and if the girl's arrest had been effected
outside the Tribunal, she would perhaps never have actually
realised what had brought it about. But with that shout of "Thou
wouldst slander the innocent girl with thy lies," full
consciousness returned to her, and with it the recollection of
everything that had gone before. Chauvelin, who watched her with
the devouring gaze of his love, saw as in a flash, through the
quick glance which swept from Adèle to himself and thence over the
sea of perspiring faces, the full workings of her mind.</p>

<p>He tried to keep the tumult going; he hoped that Fleurette would
faint, so that she might be carried out of court. He prayed that
the roof of the gigantic building would come crashing down and bury
him and Fleurette and all that swinish multitude in its ruins ere
she spoke the words which he saw hovering on her lips.</p>

<p>But none of these things happened. Rather by that perversity
which is peculiar to Chance, a sudden lull broke in on the mighty
uproar, a lull through which Fleurette's calm voice rang clear as
water poured into a crystal glass.</p>

<p>"Adèle was not lying, nor did she slander me, I did give some
valuable articles into the keeping of my beloved M'sieur Amédé
Colombe, at the hour spoken of by her, and I have no doubt that she
did see me, as she says."</p>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>One must of necessity turn once more to the <i>Moniteur</i> of
the 22nd Messidor year II of the Republic One and Indivisible.
There in the <i>Choix des Rapports XXV</i>. 516-17, despite its
sobriety of language and paucity of detail, there is ample proof
that throughout the proceedings it was the action of one unknown
that precipitated the final catastrophe. "Un géant," we are told,
"fût le premier à lancer l'accusation fausse contre le Président du
Tribunal, et on tumulte irrépressible s'ensuivit."</p>

<p>"False," you observe. But on that 16th day of June, 1794,
Chauvelin of the National Convention, member of committees and
confidant of Robespierre, did, we know, stand in danger of being
dragged out into the open and hung on the nearest lamp post. The
crowd was in no mood even to wait for the paraphernalia of the
guillotine. They wanted to see the arch-traitor, the perjurer, who
had sworn false oaths and lied in order to save himself and his
brood, hang then and there. The giant spoken of in the <i>Choix des
Rapports</i> had, it seems, hardly waited till the words were out
of Fleurette's mouth, before he pushed his way to the forefront of
the crowd, with vigorous play of his powerful elbows. Down he was
now, in the body of the court. In the struggle, his ragged shirt
had been half torn off his shoulders, and his broad chest and
sinewy arms could be seen, nude and immense, and coated with grime.
Out of one of the pockets of his tattered breeches he produced
another uncooked carrot, and into this he bit lustily, then with a
wide sweep of the arm he launched one by one against the President
of the Tribunal the damning invectives which the <i>Moniteur</i>
has characterised as false. "Traitor!" he cried. "Liar and
perjurer! Citizens all, have you in all your lives ever witnessed
such infamy?"</p>

<p>The <i>Choix des Rapports</i> describes the tumult as
irrepressible. Indeed at that moment it would have been easier to
dam a raging torrent with one pair of hands, than to suppress the
riotous confusion that ensued. Fleurette of a truth stood there
forgotten, so did Adèle and Godet. All eyes were fixed on the
President, every menacing gesture tended in his direction, all the
strident cries, the insults, the varied and foul epithets were
hurled against him. There were but few sober tempers in that
crowded room at the moment. A dozen perhaps; no more. Older men,
one or two women who watched rather than yelled. And what they saw
interested and puzzled them, so much that, when the time came, when
everybody else was shouting themselves hoarse to the verge of
mania, they still kept cool and silent.</p>

<p>Like everybody else these few were gazing on the President. They
saw him standing there on the bench like a figure carved in stone,
and, like a stone, his face was of a grey, ashen colour. His eyes
looked dim and colourless as if a hand had drawn a film over them;
his lips were parted, his nostrils distended. The breath seemed to
come with difficulty out of his lungs. A figure, in truth of terror
and despair. But calm and still. Motionless as a stone. The giant
munching his carrot had waved his huge arms about and yelled
himself hoarse until he had lashed all the spectators into a state
of frenzy. Finally he strode across the room, and came to a halt
close to the judges' bench, facing the President.</p>

<p>The three judges had been watching him all along: Pochart and
Danou with undisguised glee, and President Chauvelin with that
stony stare out of his colourless eyes. But even as the giant
approached, Chauvelin though apparently motionless, seemed inwardly
to sink within himself, to crouch as a hunted beast in face of the
menacing enemy. And suddenly like that of an automaton, up went his
arm. With finger outstretched he pointed at the giant and one word
escaped his trembling, rigid lips.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>Those who were watching him could not understand the word, for
it was spoken in an alien tongue. Nor could they understand what
happened afterwards. But what actually did happen was that the
grimy giant threw back his head and gave a quaint and altogether
pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"Why yes!" he said in the same alien tongue, which no one
present understood. "At your service, my dear M. Chambertin."</p>

<p>And Chauvelin murmured almost under his breath:</p>

<p>"You have your revenge at last, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Hitting back as you see, my friend."</p>

<p>It all passed unperceived in the midst of the irrepressible
tumult, save by those few who sober-tempered chose to watch rather
than to yell. It is doubtful whether even Pochart and Danou, who
sat close by, saw anything of this brief, this mysterious
scene.</p>

<p>The very next moment the grimy giant, this time with a hoarse
and not at all a pleasant laugh, had hurled his half-munched carrot
straight into the President's face. Then facing the crowd once more
he threw up his great arms high above his head.</p>

<p>"Why should we wait, citizens?" he shouted louder than the rest
of the yelling crowd. "A la lanterne, I say, the traitor and his
brood. The guillotine is ready outside the Place. The executioner
is to hand. Why wait?"</p>

<p>Nothing could have pleased the crowd better. They were all like
tigers scenting blood, demanding it, licking their jaws in
anticipation.</p>

<p>"Who is for a front place for the spectacle?" a man shouted from
the rear of the crowd.</p>

<p>"A moi! the front place," a woman cried in response.</p>

<p>"A moi! A moi!" came from every side.</p>

<p>Then the general scramble began. A stampede down the gradients.
The clatter of wooden sabots against the floor. The screams of
women and children pushed and squeezed by the crowd. The grounding
of arms, the click of bayonets, the words of command from the
officer in charge of the guard, who were here to maintain order and
who were quite powerless. The did of a truth try to stem the mob,
to prevent the mad rush, the trampling, the stampede. But there
were in reality too few of them for the task. All available
fighting men being required for the army abroad, these were for the
most part too inexperienced and too incompetent; raw recruits,
half-trained for a wholly inadequate corps of <i>gendarmerie</i>.
The officers did what they could, but the men themselves were soon
caught in the vortex. Having no idea of discipline or duty, they
soon became just a part of the mob, allowed themselves to be
carried along by the crowd. They were just as excited, just as
eager to see the President of a revolutionary tribunal sent
summarily to the guillotine, as anyone else. Their lust for the
spectacle was as keen as that of any ragamuffin in the place. They
were but half-trained ragamuffins themselves, and as every man
these days was at least as good as his officer and owed him neither
obedience nor respect, it was small wonder that in emergencies like
these, the soldiers got out of hand, whilst the officers, shrugging
their shoulders, viewed the scene with indifference.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the grimy giant had effectually fought his way
along the floor of the house as far as the bar of the accused,
where Fleurette, wide-eyed, deathly pale, half-crazy now with
terror, had just fallen forward unconscious across the railing,
drooping like a lily that is battered by the storm.</p>

<p>"And à moi the traitors," the giant shouted, and it was
marvellous how his booming voice rang above the uproar and the
confusion.</p>

<p>He dragged Fleurette's inanimate body from the bar and flung it
over his shoulder, as if it were a bundle of goods. Then with two
huge strides he was right in front of the judges' bench, and there
turned back to face the crowd again.</p>

<p>"Take your places for the spectacle," the Titan shouted, "and
I'll bring along the actors for you."</p>

<p>And so they rushed out in a compact, struggling mass, hurrying,
scurrying, fighting and pushing and struggling. Out in the open, in
the Place de la République, into the sunshine and under the blue
vault of heaven they rushed. The guillotine was set up there ready
for its afternoon work, but, as the grimy giant had said, "Why
wait?" Why indeed. No one was in a mood for waiting. The blackest
traitor this town had ever seen had tried to save himself and his
brood by slandering worthy citizens of the République. By the by,
where were they? Adèle of unknown parentage and the swaggering
Lieutenant Godet? Ah bah! they were forgotten. Lost in the crowd.
Who cared? Time enough to cheer them when the traitors and
slanderers were punished. Who cared indeed? For the moment the most
important thing in the world was to secure a place of vantage for
witnessing the wonderful spectacle. The President of a
revolutionary tribunal, a representative of the people in the
National Convention, was not often to be seen in Orange mounting
the steps of the guillotine. That spectacle was reserved for the
Parisians&mdash;lucky people!&mdash;who saw the heads of
<i>ci-devant</i> kings and queens, of generals and dukes and
duchesses and of countless other aristos roll into the basket.
Therefore every one scrambled for a good seat. The houses all round
the Place were invaded by the mob; windows and balconies were soon
filled with eager faces; boys and men swarmed on the roofs, clung
to the rain-pipes, the gargoyles on the Hôtel de Ville, the
guillotine reared its gaunt arms, painted a vivid red. The officers
of the <i>gendarmerie</i> had succeeded by dint of threats, in
restoring some semblance of order in the tenue of their men. They
now stood at attention round the guillotine on the platform of
which the executioner was busy with his grim task.</p>

<p>The crowd around was very still. Something oppressive,
unconnected with the heat of midday sun, seemed to hang in the air.
People were still pouring out of the Hôtel de Ville, though not in
such compact numbers. Gradually these numbers too were thinned.
Those that came out last appeared more sober, less excited than the
mob that had spread itself all over the Place shrieking and
gesticulating in the manner habitual to these natives of the South.
Some of the last to come out were a group of men well known in
Orange, one was the butcher from the rue Longue, another the
innkeeper of <i>Les Trois Abeilles</i>, a third kept the
haberdashery shop over the bridge. Citizens Pochart and Danou were
with them. They were all talking eagerly together as they came down
the steps. A group of women were standing close by.</p>

<p>"Are they bringing the traitors?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Yes Citizen Tartine," the butcher replied, "that fine patriot
Rémi, one of the scavengers at the Caristie house is close behind
us, with some of his mates. They've got the traitors between them.
We are to give the sign by firing this pistol when the executioner
is ready."</p>

<p>He showed the women the pistol which he said Rémi himself had
given him.</p>

<p>"The executioner is ready now," the women said, three of them
speaking at once.</p>

<p>Citizens Pochart and Danou and the others then walked across the
Place to the foot of the guillotine, one of them spoke a few words
with the executioner. The crowd of spectators watched with feverish
excitement. And presently Citizen Tartine, the butcher, raised his
arm and fired a pistol in the air. A number of women shrieked. The
excitement was so tense that the loud report sent the others into
hysterics. Soon, however, the rumour went round that the
pistol-shot was the signal that everything was ready for the
spectacle and for the entrance of the chief actors in the play.
After which every noise subsided. The multitude held its breath; a
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed on the wide-open portals of the
Hôtel de Ville waiting for the grandiose appearance of Rémi the
scavenger and his mates bearing the traitors upon their
shoulders.</p>

<p>Up, on the platform of the guillotine, the executioner was
giving a last look to the pulleys. The soldiers stood at
attention.</p>

<p>The huge crowd waited.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>The <i>Moniteur</i> does not say much about what happened
afterwards. "La foule attendit avec assez de patience," is all it
says, "mais personne ne vint."</p>

<p>The portals of the Hôtel de Ville which should have been a frame
for the entrance of the principal actors in the last act of the
drama, showed nothing but the yawning black emptiness beyond. The
crowd waited, says the <i>Moniteur</i>, with sufficient patience.
They did wait quite happily for ten minutes, agitatedly for twenty.
But nobody came. Citizens Pochart and Danou, also Citizen Tartine,
the butcher, and three or four others, were seen to make their way
back across the Place, to run quickly up the steps of the Hôtel de
Ville and subsequently disappear inside its portals. Still the
crowd waited, very much as a crowd will wait in a theatre when the
entr'acte is too long; some of them hilariously, others with
impatient yawns, others again with tapping of feet and presently
with murmurs of: "La Lan-terne! La Lan-terne!"</p>

<p>The next thing that happened was the reverberating clang of the
portals of the Hôtel de Ville being suddenly closed. Then only did
the crowd realise that they were being cheated of the spectacle.
Murmurs were loud, and there were some hisses and boos and cat's
calls. But on the whole they took the event with extraordinary
calm. There was no rioting as indeed might have been expected. A
few hot-heads tried to create a disturbance demanding that the
executioner be given something to do. Madame la Guillotine should
not be cheated of her dinner.</p>

<p>"She's hungry, give her something to eat," was the catchword
these hot-heads used in order to excite the rest of the crowd.
Somehow it did not work. There certainly were a few bouts of
fisticuffs, one or two broken heads, the soldiers round the
guillotine and those on guard at the street corners did use their
bayonets with some effect, but on the whole the crowd was strangely
subdued, more inclined to whisper than to shout.</p>

<p>For quite a little while after the portals of the Hôtel de Ville
had been closed, they still waited, thinking that perhaps something
more was being devised for their entertainment. But as time went on
and nothing happened, they thought they might as well get home. It
was dinner time. The children were hungry, and though there was
little enough in the larders these days, one had to get home and
give them what there was. The whole thing had been strange. Very
strange. As men and women wended their way homeward, their thoughts
reverted to that titanic figure with the grimy face and the huge
bare chest, one sinewy arm encircling the body of the wench
Fleurette nommée Armand, which hung limp across his massive
shoulder. He was no mere mortal, that was certain. And though the
Government up in Paris had abolished <i>le bon Dieu</i>, and
declared that it was Citizen Robespierre who was the "être
Suprême," something of the old superstitions imbibed at their
mothers' knees, still lingered in these untutored, undisciplined
minds. That the Titan with the flashing eyes and grimy face should
have vanished with the traitors whom he and his satellites had
seized, was but the fitting ending to his meteoric appearance. The
Government might forbid belief in God and the Devil, in heaven and
in hell, but here was proof positive that the Devil did exist. He
was black and he was of abnormal stature, he had a great bare chest
and strong muscular arms, and&mdash;clearest proof of all&mdash;he
had before the very eyes of the citizens of Orange seized upon two
traitors and carried them away with him to limbo.</p>

<p>Nothing would take that idea out of the people's mind, and long
after these horrible days of the revolution had passed away and men
and women had returned to sanity, those who were present on that
day in June at the trial of one Fleur Chauvelin nommée Armand,
would recount the marvellous story of how the devil had entered the
court-house and spirited the accused away. Only a few knew the true
facts of the case, and even so a great deal was left to surmise.
Among those who knew was Citizen Tartine, the butcher. And this is
what he told his friends when they pressed him with questions. It
seems that when the crowd stampeded out of the Hôtel de Ville, he,
Tartine, together with Citizens Pochart and Danou who had stepped
down from the judges' bench, and three or four other notabilities
of the city among whom was Motus, the chief warder of the Caristie
House, put their heads together for a moment or two, wondering if
something could not be done towards sending the wench Fleurette and
her father by a back way to one or other of the prison houses, with
a view to bringing them up for formal trial on the morrow. They did
feel, however, that given the present temper of the populace, such
a move might prove dangerous to themselves. "The people will demand
a victim, two victims, perhaps more," Danou said with a doubtful
nod of the head. "They might vent their wrath on us."</p>

<p>That was sound logic, and the project was abandoned almost as
soon as it was formulated.</p>

<p>Motus, it seems, then turned familiarly to the giant and
said:</p>

<p>"Tiens, Rémi, is it thou?"</p>

<p>"Myself, citizen," the giant replied.</p>

<p>In response to inquiries from the others, Chief Warder Motus
then explained that Rémi was a scavenger whom he himself had taken
on in the Caristie House for extra work when the regular man fell
sick. A splendid patriot, Motus averred. There was, therefore, not
the faintest cause for suspicion.</p>

<p>"Come along, all of you," Pochart now said addressing Rémi and
his mates. "Bring along the prisoners. The people are waiting."</p>

<p>"Give them time to settle down," Rémi replied with a shrug and
laugh. "We are the chief comedians in this play. Do you all go and
prepare everything for our entrance."</p>

<p>"You won't tarry?" Danou admonished.</p>

<p>"Not we," Rémi replied. "We're as eager as you for the
spectacle, eh, citizens?" he added, turning to his mates who had
the President of the Tribunal still between them.</p>

<p>Rémi then took a pistol out of his ragged breeches and handed it
to Citizen Tartine.</p>

<p>"When the executioner is ready," he said, "and everything
prepared for our entrance, just give us the signal by firing the
pistol. We'll be with you a few minutes after that. We've yet
another surprise for the spectators," he added with another laugh,
"which will delight them and you."</p>

<p>Tartine vowed that not the slightest suspicion entered his head
or that of his companions. How could one suspect a patriot vouched
for by no less a person than Motus the chief warder? In the end,
however, Pochart decided that two men of the <i>gendarmerie</i>,
one of whom was a sergeant, who were still standing at attention
below the judges' bench, should remain with Rémi and his mates and
escort them when the time came, on to the Place.</p>

<p>After which the group of notabilities followed the rest of the
crowd out into the open. When looking back upon what followed, they
all agreed that some fifteen minutes must have gone from the time
when they finally left the court-house and took their last look at
Rémi and his mates, to that when they returned and found the place
empty. They all said that even then, at first glance, no suspicion
entered their minds and they stood about for a few minutes talking
together, thinking that Rémi was preparing the surprise spectacle
which he had promised them. Thinking too that every moment would
bring the scavenger back with his mates and the prisoners. Tartine,
the butcher, was the first to suspect that there might be something
wrong. He crossed the floor of the room, and made his way to the
private door which was at the back of the judges' bench and led to
some corridors and private rooms, and also to the back of the
premises of the Hôtel de Ville, and to a back door which gave on a
narrow street that ran parallel with the façade.</p>

<p>The private door was locked, with no key to be seen. But even
then, so remote was suspicion from their minds that Tartine and the
others hammered away on the door and called loudly to Rémi. The
door was made of solid oak, but Pochart and Tartine were both of
them powerful men. Receiving no answer to their call, they searched
amidst the litter left pell-mell by the crowd upon the gradients,
and found an axe and a leaded stick. Thus armed they attacked the
panels of the door, whilst Danou and one of the others wisely
thought of closing the portals of the Hôtel de Ville. The oak
panels yielded after awhile. The door battered in, fell under the
heavy blows dealt by Tartine the butcher with the axe. He and
Pochart and two or three of the others striding over the debris,
found themselves in a dark corridor.</p>

<p>Some twenty paces down the corridor on the right, they came to
another door. It was locked, but behind it came a vigorous sound of
banging and the door shook now and again as if under heavy blows.
Once more the axe was brought into play, the door was smashed in
and as it fell in with a crash, it revealed the two men of the
<i>gendarmerie</i>, with arms and legs securely pinioned, and their
crimson caps stuffed into their mouths. One of them had succeeded
in rolling along the floor, near enough to the door to kick against
it with his otherwise helpless feet.</p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt. The public had been hoaxed
either by an impudent imposter, or by a traitor, bribed to aid the
prisoners to escape. The words: "English spies," soon cropped up as
did those of Amédé Colombe and architect Caristie and a host of
others. This too, no doubt, was their work. At least this was the
opinion of some, whilst others, headed by Danou, shook their heads
dubiously. Citizen Chauvelin was known to be the sworn enemy of
those English spies&mdash;weren't they called the League of the
Scarlet Pimpernel?&mdash;and it was Citizen Chauvelin and his
daughter Fleur who had been so insolently spirited away.</p>

<p>Having hastily released the men of the <i>gendarmerie</i>, they
all ran down the length of the corridor as swiftly as they could,
chiefly because one of the soldiers said that this corridor led
ultimately to a back entrance of the Hôtel de Ville. But the
building itself was something of a maze, the passages were dark and
narrow, it took them all some time to find that back door, and when
at last they came upon it, they found it locked.</p>

<p>Once more the axe had to come into play, and time had in the
meanwhile slipped by to the tune of some twenty minutes. Nor did
the narrow back street reveal any of the secrets of this amazing
adventure. Impostors, traitors or English spies, Rémi the scavenger
and his mates had disappeared with the two prisoners and taken
their secret with them. On the other side of the road there was a
row of one-storied, tumble down houses, inhabited by some of the
poorest families in the city. Inquiries at each house in succession
revealed but little. Nearly all the inmates had spent their morning
as usual watching the trials in the Hôtel de Ville and were not yet
home; but in one of the houses a sick woman had, it seems, been
standing at the window when she saw four or five men come out of
the building opposite. One of them, she said, was very tall and was
carrying what she thought was a large bundle on his shoulder. The
others were hustling a short, thin man who wore a blue coat and had
on a tricolour sash round his waist. They turned sharply to their
right and she soon lost sight of them. She thought nothing about
the incident, one saw so many strange things these days.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the crowd on the Place had begun to disperse,
the first stragglers were wending their way to their homes. Pochart
and Danou holding high functions in the administration of justice,
did not feel that it was incumbent upon them to go hunting for
spies. That was the business of the <i>gendarmerie</i>, and they
parted presently from their friends, declaring their intention of
sending immediately for the Chief Commissary of Police. The others,
feeling that it was not part of their duty either to run after
escaped prisoners, found that they had pressing business to see to
at home.</p>

<p>As far as Citizen Tartine, the butcher, was concerned, the
incident had no further interest for him save for the pleasure of
recounting his share of the adventure to his numerous friends. A
couple more traitors escaped from the clutches of justice, a few
more English spies when already the country swarmed with them, was
nothing to worry one's head about.</p>

<p>Pochart and Danou did, on the other hand, worry their heads
considerably about it all. They had a burning desire to know just
what the English spies did ultimately do with their colleague
Chauvelin. They hoped&mdash;oh! very ardently&mdash;that as soon as
the much-vaunted Scarlet Pimpernel discovered that it was his
inveterate enemy whom he had rescued from the guillotine, he would
either hand him back straightway to the tender mercies of justice,
or simply murder him in some convenient and out-of-the-way corner
of the district. Pochart and Danou would have preferred the former
alternative as being more satisfactory to their wounded vanity and
their baffled spite.</p>

<p>Unlike Tartine, they seldom spoke of their experiences in
connection with the affair. But their hopes did rise to their
zenith when a week or so later President Legrange and Public
Prosecutor Isnard returned from their fool's errand to Paris; there
could be no doubt that even Robespierre, friend of Chauvelin though
he be, would order the punishment of such a consummate liar and
traitor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>An immense lassitude had held Fleurette in a kind of
semi-consciousness, a dreamless sleep from which she woke at
intervals, only to open her eyes for a moment, and immediately let
the lids, heavy with sleep, fall over them again. It was the
reaction insisted on by health and youth against the terrible
nerve-strain of that awful day.</p>

<p>During the brief intervals while she had a certain consciousness
of things about her, she found herself nestling against chéri
Bibi's shoulder! And when, with half-dimmed eyes she looked up at
him, and tried to smile between two yawns, she always saw his pale,
grave face turned away in profile, gazing straight out before him
into the dark recess of the post-chaise, in which apparently they
were travelling. She called softly to him once or twice, but he
never turned to look at her, only his hand, which felt cold and
clammy, would gently stroke her hair.</p>

<p>How long all this lasted, what happened to her in the intervals
of sleep, Fleurette never knew, but there came a time when the
chaise rattled unpleasantly over the cobble-stones of a city, and
lights darted to and fro through the darkness as the vehicle
lumbered along through fitfully lighted streets. Fleurette sat up
straight; all the sleep suddenly gone out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Where are we going, chéri Bibi?" she asked. "Do you know?"</p>

<p>"No! I do not," Bibi replied, and his voice sounded hoarse and
hollow. "Would to God I did."</p>

<p>Fleurette had never heard him invoke <i>le bon Dieu</i> before,
and she tried through the gloom to peer into his face.</p>

<p>"But we are out of danger now, chéri?" she asked wide-eyed, the
old terror which had caused her to lose consciousness in that awful
court-house, once more clutching at her heart.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he murmured mechanically; "would to God I
did."</p>

<p>And then as if recalled to himself by the half-drawn sigh of
terror from Fleurette, he seized hold of her, and pressed her head
against his breast.</p>

<p>"No! No!" he said hastily, "they cannot harm you whilst I'm here
to guard you."</p>

<p>Just then the coach came to a halt, and a moment later the door
was thrown open and a gruff voice said:</p>

<p>"Will you descend, citizeness?"</p>

<p>Fleurette, frightened, clung to Bibi. She made no attempt to
move. Whereupon the gruff voice resumed:</p>

<p>"If you don't come willingly, I shall have to send some one to
fetch you."</p>

<p>Fleurette buried her face against Bibi's coat. His arms held her
tightly. A minute, perhaps less, went by, and
then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;she heard a voice&mdash;a very gentle,
very timid voice this time, saying:</p>

<p>"Mam'zelle Fleurette! Oh, Mam'zelle Fleurette, I pray you to
turn to me. It is I&mdash;Amédé."</p>

<p>What had happened? Was she dreaming? Or had she died of fright
and gone straight up to heaven? Certain it is that she felt a timid
hand upon her shoulder, whilst Bibi's hold upon her relaxed.</p>

<p>"Hold up the lantern, man," the gruff voice now broke in upon
the delicious silence that ensued, "and let her see that she is not
dreaming."</p>

<p>The light of a lantern flashed across Fleurette's eyes, she
opened them and turned her head, and found herself gazing on
M'sieur Amédé's pink and moist face, into his kind eyes full of
anxiety and of tenderness, upon his mouth which had taught her how
to kiss. Gently, slowly, she extricated herself from Bibi's
embrace. Gently, slowly she seemed to glide into Amédé's arms.</p>

<p>He carried her whither she knew not. All she knew was that
presently she found herself snuggling in a deep, cosy arm-chair,
and that Amédé was kneeling beside her, with his eyes fixed
ecstatically upon her as if she were <i>la sainte Vierge</i>
herself.</p>

<p>"Where am I, dear M'sieur Amédé?" she asked.</p>

<p>"At Ste. Césaire, Mam'zelle Fleurette," he replied.</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"Just outside Nimes. Your chaise passed through the streets of
Nimes."</p>

<p>"I daresay," she said with a tired little sigh. "I was so
sleepy; I didn't know where we were."</p>

<p>"We are under the protection of the bravest men that ever
lived," Amédé said slowly. "They saved me from death. They have
saved you, Mam'zelle Fleurette."</p>

<p>A shudder went through her. She closed her eyes as if to try and
shut away the awful visions which his words had conjured up. But
his kind, strong arms encircled her closer, and she nestled against
him and once again felt comforted and safe. He told her the entire
odyssey of his rescue, from the hour when the mock soldiers entered
his father's shop at Laragne, until when his brave rescuers took
leave of him outside the derelict cottage by the banks of the
Drôme, and he, seeing the pale crescent of the moon rise above the
snow-capped crest of La Lance, had solemnly bowed nine times,
praying for that joy which to-day was his at last.</p>

<p>He had spent a few very lonely days in the cottage after that,
devoured with anxiety as to the fate of his beloved. He could not
eat, he could not sleep. For hours he would watch the filmy
crescent of the moon, whose pale light mayhap illumined the window
behind which his own Fleurette would also be watching and praying.
And three days ago he received the message which he was waiting
for. It appeared mysteriously early one morning outside the cottage
door. A missive, with a stone put upon it to prevent its being
blown away by the wind. How it got there Amédé never knew. It came
from the leader of that gallant little league of Englishmen who
devoted their lives to helping those in distress. In it he, Amédé,
was ordered to walk as far as Crest, to the house of Citizen Marcor
the farrier, where he could hire a horse. And then to hie him
straightway hither to Ste. Césaire, not sleeping in any wayside
inn, but rather in the fields, under shelter of hedges of forest
trees, getting food for himself and his horse as best he could. The
missive further directed him, on arriving at Ste. Césaire, to seek
out an empty house situated in the Rue Basse, and there to wait,
for of a surety within two days he would hold his beloved Fleurette
in his arms. Amédé had obeyed these commands to the letter. This
very morning he had arrived at Ste. Césaire and found the house in
the Rue Basse. It was neither empty nor uninhabited. There was
furniture in the house, and what's more there were two friends, two
fine English heroes, who had been expecting Amédé and who made him
welcome when he arrived. Oh! and didn't Mam'zelle Fleurette think
that these Englishmen were the finest and bravest men that ever
lived? As for their chief who was known amongst them as the Scarlet
Pimpernel (<i>le mouron rouge</i>, M'sieur Amédé called it), he
surely was more like one of the mythological gods rather than a
mere mortal.</p>

<p>M'sieur Amédé seemed very anxious to know what Mam'zelle
Fleurette thought about all these marvellous adventures, but how
could she tell him, how could she talk at all when every time she
raised her blue eyes to him, he broke off in the midst of a most
exciting narrative in order to ask her in a voice vibrating with
passion: "Tu m'aimes Fleurette?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>Chauvelin, after he had seen Fleurette safely carried away in
her lover's arms, sat for awhile in the dark interior of the coach,
staring into the gloom, his folded hands clasped between his
knees. His thoughts were in such a whirl that it almost seemed as
if he were unconscious. He certainly was insentient; he neither
saw, nor heard, nor felt anything save the joy of knowing that his
Fleurette was safe. It was only a few minutes&mdash;fifteen
perhaps&mdash;later that a pleasant laugh broke in on his riotous
thoughts, and that he became aware of a tall figure sitting beside
him in the coach.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear M. Chambertin," the voice which he dreaded
most in all the world said suddenly in his ear, "I would not forgo
the pleasure of bidding you <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>Chauvelin half turned to his enemy, the man whom he had so
persistently wronged, so persistently pursued with hatred and with
spite. Through the gloom he could just see the outline of the
massive figure, wrapped in a dark, caped coat, and of the proud
head so nobly held above the firm, somewhat stiff neck.</p>

<p>Did all that this man stood for in the way of heroism and
selflessness, strike a chord of shame in the heart of this callous,
revolutionary tyrant? Who shall say? Certain it is that for the
moment Chauvelin felt awed, and sat there in the gloom, silent,
motionless, staring into the black vacancy. But after a second or
two his lips uttered mechanically the name that was uppermost in
his mind:</p>

<p>"Fleurette?"</p>

<p>"She is under my care," Blakeney said slowly. "To-morrow at
break of day she and her sweetheart will set sail for England with
some of my friends. There she will be under the care of the noblest
woman in the world, Lady Blakeney, who will take her revenge on you
for all the wrong you did her, by lavishing the treasures of her
sympathy upon your child."</p>

<p>"Then Fleurette will be happy?" Chauvelin murmured
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Happy, yes! she will soon forget."</p>

<p>"Then I am ready, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Ready? For what?"</p>

<p>"My life is at your service. My enemies are waiting for me over
in Orange. You have but to send me back thither and your own
vengeance will be complete."</p>

<p>For a second or two after that there was silence in the old
post-chaise; only Chauvelin's laboured breathing broke the utter
stillness of the gloom. Until suddenly a pleasant, mocking laugh
struck upon his ear.</p>

<p>"Egad man, you are priceless," quoth Sir Percy gaily. "You must
indeed credit me with a total lack of the saving grace, if you
think it would amuse me to hand you over to your genial friends
over in Orange."</p>

<p>"But I am at your mercy, sir."</p>

<p>"As I and my beloved wife have been once or twice, eh? Well! I
am hitting back now. That's all."</p>

<p>"Hitting back?" Chauvelin exclaimed. "You have the power now. I
admit it. I am in your hands. My life is at your command."</p>

<p>"La man!" Sir Percy retorted lightly, "what should I do with
your worthless life? For the moment all I want is to make that
sweet child up there completely happy by telling her that you are
safe and well. After that you may go to the devil for aught I care.
You probably will."</p>

<p>"Then," Chauvelin murmured aghast, "you grant me my life,
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sending you back safely as far as Nimes. What happens to
you after that I neither know nor care. You have tried to do me
such an infinity of wrong at different times, you still hate me so
cordially, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment with firm lips tightly pressed together
and slender hand clutched upon his knee.</p>

<p>"You are right there, Sir Percy," Chauvelin murmured between his
teeth. "God knows how I still hate you, even after this. You have
the power to hit back. Why the devil don't you do it?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Sir Percy threw back his head and his merry,
infectious laugh woke the slumbering echoes of the sleepy little
town.</p>

<p>"La, man," he said, "you're astonishing. Can't you see that this
is my way of hitting back?"</p>
