Seeking a Vactation, Interplanetary Guard Jack Sanders Runs into
Romance and a Space War!</b></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>Off to Mars</h3>

<p>THE message that was to change the whole course of my life came
through on the General Communicator about 10 P.M., Earth Time, while we
were still within the planet's atmospheric envelope. The interstellar
liner <i>Cosmos</i>, bound from New York (Earth) to Tlanan (Mars) had lifted
from the Madison Landing scarcely an hour before and we were still
making altitude when the call came through from Harran.</p>

<p>This was to have been my first interplanetary trip as a private
passenger, my first carefree holiday in years. Not that the journey
itself held any attraction for me or that I was new to the outer
reaches of space. On the contrary.</p>

<p>As an official of the Interplanetary Guard, which is responsible for
the smooth running of traffic and the maintenance of law and order in
the void between the inner planets, I had seen rather too much of them.
Nevertheless I was looking forward to a holiday free from emergency
calls, the long restful voyage to the Red Planet and the hope, if time
allowed, of a stopover on Venus on the way home.</p>

<p>Captain Hume--a man of Earth parentage, though he had first seen the
light on Mars--and I were old friends and I expected a heartier welcome
than usual, since on this particular trip I had no official status. As
a rule the captains of the interplanetary liners look askance at
us.</p>

<p>We mean trouble for them, the endless scrutinizing of passengers and
documents and often as not the complete suspension, where the need
justifies it, of the skipper's own functions.</p>

<p>I boarded the <i>Cosmos</i> early in the evening while the liner was
still tilting in the slips. Captain Hume was then in his cabin. His own
particular duties would not begin until after the takeoff and in the
meanwhile the running was in the hands of the first and second
officers.</p>

<p>The first, a man named Gond with whom I had some slight
acquaintance, came up to me as I crossed the gangway and told me the
skipper would be glad to see me as soon as I could make time,
presumably after I got settled in my cabin.</p>

<p>That did not take long. To one used to the stark simplicity of the
Guard-ship accommodation, the passenger cabins spelled luxury. But I
did not linger as my training had taught me how to dispose of my few
belongings in the minimum of time with the minimum of effort. Then I
made my way in what I judged to be the direction of Hume's cabin.</p>

<p>The <i>Cosmos</i> was a new type of craft to me. She was the first to be
commissioned of the new giant liners that were meant ultimately to ply
to the outer planets, though until the entire fleet was ready she was
being tried out on the home run between Earth, Mars and Venus.</p>

<p>She embodied features with which I was not familiar, and in many
ways her designers had departed from the standardized plan laid down by
the Board of Control in the year 2001, when the first regular space
service was begun following on that disastrous business of the War of
the Planets.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty in finding my way and once I was stopped by an
officer I did not know with the intimation that this part of the ship
was not free to passengers. I flashed my badge at him however, that
silver model of a Guard-ship with the letters I. P. G. stamped across
it, asked to be directed to the captain's quarters. Rather surlily he
conducted me through a maze of cross-passages to a stairway and told me
that I would find what I sought at the head.</p>

<p>I came out on the observation deck and here I was more at home, for
in this part of the ship the original design had not been departed
from, I pressed the button on the door that would show my face in the
vision-plate on the captain's table and waited. Almost immediately the
door swung open and Hume's hearty voice cried, "Come in!"</p>

<p>IT was like coming into another world after the bare bleak passage
outside--a warm cozy room lit by suffused daylight from the
store-tanks, a room picked out in restful white that some how lulled
the senses and soothed the eyes.</p>

<p>In most respects it was like any other skipper's cabin, with the
televox, the ground screens of the television, the dial charts and the
thousand and one compact gadgets necessary to an interplanetary
captain's hand at any hour of the day or night. One new feature however
caught my eye, the bookmatchines racked up on the shelves.</p>

<p>"So you've come along at last, Sanders, and for once other than as a
trouble-maker," Hume boomed at me, "Make yourself comfortable. I've
nothing to do for thirty clicks or so."</p>

<p>He nodded at the clock above his table. I had been subconsciously
aware of the humming buzz of the seconds passing but almost on the
heels of his words came the click-click-click of three minutes past the
hour. This, too, was a new feature. We in the Guard-ships have another
type of clock, one that neasures in half-seconds, for when we travel it
is at a tremendous speed and our chronometers need to be accurate to
the last least degree.</p>

<p>In answer to a question of Hume's I told him something of my plans,
My knowledge of the surface of the planets was rudimentary, I had been
a dozen times in Tlanan and once to Shangun, the capital of Venus, but
these had all been flying trips--literally--and I knew nothing of
either land in the way I had come to know my own world.</p>

<p>Hume chuckled. "Mars you'll like," he said. "Next to Tellus"--he
meant Earth--"it's the sweetest little planet I know and I've seen some
and mean to see more. But Venus--" He gave a mock shudder. "It's
certainly beautiful, though I can't abide the perpetual cloud-drift. I
like empty skies with the hot sun pouring down."</p>

<p>"I don't," I said. "Perhaps too much work in the absolute zero of
space has tempered my regard for the sun."</p>

<p>"You chill being! But all you Guards are the same. Have something as
a warmer for a change."</p>

<p>He did not wait for my nod but pressed a button in the wall behind
him. A panel slid away and a tray shot out with two glasses on it
filled with--pure water!</p>

<p>He chuckled again at my look, then took a small metal box from a
drawer of his table. The box held a hundred or more tiny brown pellets,
of which he selected two, dropped one in each glass and watched the
water discolor as the pair dissolved. When a stream of hissing bubbles
rose to the surface he handed me my glass.</p>

<p>"Martian Oxcta," he explained, though it was a thing I had never
heard of. "It has all the virtues of Earth whiskey without its
drawbacks. Drink up."</p>

<p>I tasted it, just the merest sip. Liking it, I swallowed the rest at
a gulp. There was exhilaration in the draught and something more. In
all my interplanetary experience I had never tasted the like and I said
so.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't. Earthmen don't as a rule. Mars still keeps some of
its own secrets, But I happened to have been born there. As you know my
wife's a Tlananian, and that counts too."</p>

<p>He slipped the box back in the drawer and I heard a click as the
automatic lock engaged. The care he took of it made me wonder about
some of those other secrets at which he had hinted and what, if
anything, would happen to anyone who betrayed them.</p>

<p>It came to me suddenly, sitting there, that the situation had its
illegal side. "Hume," I said. "I'm a friend of yours, you're a friend
of mine. Put it that way. This stuff of yours we've just drunk?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" He cocked one eye at me.</p>

<p>"Only this. I'm a Guard. They pick us for integrity, moral, physical
and every other way. Should I, knowing what you have, say nothing?
There's an Earth-law banning alcohol even on spaceships in the
void."</p>

<p>He laughed heartily. "There's not a taste or trace of alcohol in it.
Giving it to you transgresses no law in the Universe. Can you take my
word for that?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "I know you, Hume."</p>

<p>"Good." And there the matter dropped.</p>

<p>QUITE a little thing, it seemed--then. Looking back I'm not so sure.
That odd Martian Oxcta, it appears to me, had something to do with the
events that were to come.</p>

<p>We never felt the lift, the <i>Cosmos</i> rose so lightly from the slips.
Insulated from all sound as we were in the cabin, we heard none of the
blare of departure either. Only, the warning glow of the red bulb above
the dial chart on the opposite wall told us that New York, the whole
American continent indeed, was sliding away beneath us.</p>

<p>In the old days there was none of this gentleness in the take-off.
We had not as yet learnt to control gravity with our screens. We could
only nullify it, a practice that sometimes had dire results.</p>

<p>We sat and talked and time went on. Soon the call would come for
Hume to take over and sling the ship out of the Earth's envelope of
air, always a ticklish business. Already he had his eyes on the ship's
communicators, awaiting reports from the various control
departments.</p>

<p>A shutter dropped in the wall, and a call came through from the
communications room. Hume touched a button. The face of the operator
glowed in the screen and his voice came.</p>

<p>"Call through for Mr. Sanders," he said. "Televox."</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and Hume caught my eye.</p>

<p>"I'd better leave you to it," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"No need," I said. I knew it didn't matter. He couldn't hear what
was said if I didn't wish.</p>

<p>I stood before the screen, my fingers on the buttons that made
contact. The surface of the screen flashed the room first of all, that
room in Headquarters Building I knew so well. Then the view narrowed,
centering on Harran's chair until Harran's face itself, lean, tanned
and immobile, completely filled the picture.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jack," his voice came. "Release."</p>

<p>The command might have been Greek to Hume but it carried a definite
meaning to me. I released one button, that which intensifies the voice,
and clapped my free hand over my ear. Hume could not have seen, even
had he been looking, the flat black disk no larger than a penny that I
held against my ear.</p>

<p>The moment I put it into position the disk functioned. Harran's
voice, which before had filled the room, faded away entirely. The
screen itself grew dark. But I could still hear him talking, a tiny
voice in my ear, clear and marvellously distinct, though a man standing
at my elbow could not hear a sound.</p>

<p>What Harran had to say was startling enough. Two spaceships had come
in that night with all communications paralyzed. In each case the
trouble had occurred in open space and was preceded by a feeling of
intense cold, though the heating apparatus in each ship was working
perfectly. Some passengers, indeed, had succumbed to the cold. Whether
they could be revived had not yet been ascertained.</p>

<p>"Where do I come in?" I asked. Harran told me. It might be some as
yet undiscovered property of space that had caused the trouble. It
might--he thought it quite likely--be the work of some alien forces.
But whatever it was I was to keep an eye lifted.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he cut in on his own orders. "There's something else."
"Quickly," I warned him. "We're near the edge of the atmosphere now."
Once we were away from the Earth's atmosphere, of course, the televox
would not function.</p>

<p>Why is beyond me.</p>

<p>"Reports through from entry ports of Venus and Mars," Harran took up
again, "state number of craft overdue and failing to answer calls. The
Guards are being notified at their stations but to be on the safe side
we're tuning in on all, who like yourself, are space-traveling. Use
your own discretion but solve your end of the mystery if you can."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" I asked.</p>

<p>The screen flashed up again and I saw him nod. "That's all," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Good..."</p>

<p>He meant 'Good-bye', but the last word came to me only as the thin
ghost of a whisper. We had passed beyond the atmosphere and were now
out in free space.</p>

<p>I slipped the disk back into my pocket, and looked around.</p>

<p>The cabin was empty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>Sanders Acts</h3>

<p>FEELING free of the cabin I sat down to think the matter out. Some
space-ships overdue--two others reporting excessive cold though the
heaters were working all right--that was all. Yet it was enough to
galvanize Harran to activity, enough in his opinion to justify him
calling me on duty.</p>

<p>What did it mean? What was that odd hint of alien forces? One felt
disposed to say nonsense.</p>

<p>Nothing is nonsense nowadays. Less than a century ago mankind sighed
because there was nothing left to explore. Today we have reached beyond
the world. We have discovered other worlds or had them discover us--not
quite the same as I may some day relate. At least we know that we have
much to learn.</p>

<p>We have set foot on four of the nine planets, the other five are in
the process of being explored and we are not without hopes that soon
the Galaxy may be penetrated by our space liners. Not much when one
comes to think of it.</p>

<p>Idle speculation, of course, which took me nowhere. Hume, I must see
and talk to. It was clearly a matter of which he should be
informed.</p>

<p>I got up in search of him but the moment I sealed the door behind me
I turned the other way and went instead down to my own cabin.</p>

<p>Everything was as I had left it. My baggage was still packed. My
steward would have opened it and stowed my things away in the ordinary
course had I not warned him to leave it alone. There were things in it
I had no wish for anyone to see.</p>

<p>I opened one grip, delved down t the bottom and sighed with relief
as I felt my hand touch the cold metal of the box I had hidden there.
It was sealed and locked but I broke the one and undid the other and
drew out the ray tube from its nest of cottonwool.</p>

<p>It was a queer little weapon, six inches long and no thicker than a
lead pencil, but it could do deadly work up to fifty yards. I slipped
the full magazine of twelve charges, no bigger than match heads, into
the hollow butt and slid the catch over. A spare tube and the two
thousand extra charges that were still in the box made me hesitate.</p>

<p>There was a little ledge over my bed, One of the supporting girders
of the deck above rested on the partition separating my cabin from its
neighbor, formed an angle and a dark shelf where the light did not
penetrate. I slipped my little box in there, pushed it far back so that
no abrupt motion of the ship would dislodge it.</p>

<p>Then I went in search of Captain Hume. On the way up to the
control-room I slipped my silver badge out of my pocket and fastened it
in my coat. A warning would not hurt him. He would guess the moment he
saw it and not be altogether taken by surprise.</p>

<p>A light metal ladder--had it been detached I could have carried it
easily in one hand--led from the promenade deck to the control deck
above. The upper end of it was closed by a bar upped into place,
charged, as I knew too well from experience, with a current that would
give a nasty shock to any unauthorized person who attempted to force a
passage.</p>

<p>One of the crew stood guard beside it, a ray tube in hand. It was
all more or less show for not once in a hundred trips does the need
arise to use it. But routine is routine. The man flung the tube forward
dramatically as my head appeared above the level of the deck
flooring.</p>

<p>"I want to see Captain Hume," I said. "It's important. The name is
Sanders. "</p>

<p>As I spoke I kept my hand clutched over the left lapel of my coat.
It looked like a purely nervous gesture such as any man might make but
it was not. I did it of design, to hide the blaze of the badge pinned
to my coat. I had no mind to broadcast my service before the
appropriate moment.</p>

<p>THE fellow stared doubtfully at me. "Stay there," he said harshly. I
could see him plainer now, as he could see me. A touch of the Martian
in him, I thought, though I could not be sure.</p>

<p>The scrutiny no doubt satisfied him of my lack of evil intent for he
touched a button on the rail beside him and the bar lifted, giving me
passage. The pressure of the button, too, must have set a signal for
Hume, for even as I reached the deck level a door opened and a face
looked out.</p>

<p>It was Hume himself. He looked by no means pleased to see me.
Perhaps from what had gone before he already guessed at the
possibilities of disturbance behind me.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me?" he said. "What is the trouble now,
Jack?"</p>

<p>I slanted an eye toward the control room. "You're not alone?" I
said.</p>

<p>"Something for my private ear?" he said with a frown. "Well, you can
say it just as well out here. There are four pairs of ears in there,
you know."</p>

<p>I dropped my hand from my lapel, and the flash of the badge caught
his eye. His face went nearly purple at the sight.</p>

<p>"By the Planets!" he exploded. "This is intolerable! No man's
command is his own these days."</p>

<p>"Steady," I hushed him. "It's not as bad as that. I've no wish to
supersede you. What I want is cooperation. I'll tell you why."</p>

<p>He cooled down at that and I gave him the gist of my communicator
message. "I don't like it," he said at the end. "There may be nothing
in it--on the other hand there may be a lot. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"What I'd like you to do, if you don't mind;" I said mildly, "is
this. Call me the moment you sight or find your instruments recording
anything out of the ordinary. I'd like a chat with any other space-ship
we pass. And, of course, if we meet a Guards Patrol..."</p>

<p>"May the Guards fuse!" he snapped. "No, I didn't mean that, Jack.
But no skipper likes to think that at any click of the clock he may
cease to be master in his own ship. You know that."</p>

<p>"I know. I'd prefer not to take command. I've never done it yet
where I could find a skipper willing to work in conjunction with
me."</p>

<p>I held out my hand. For a moment he hesitated, then gripped it.</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble between us, that I'll warrant you," he
assured. "I'll see you're kept posted and whoever is on watch will have
instructions to call you at any hour of the twenty-four if anything
appears."</p>

<p>He stopped. His eyes lingered on my badge. I slipped the badge into
my pocket. "There's no need," I said, "to advertise trouble before it
comes."</p>

<p>He looked relieved. "I'm having you put at my table," he remarked.
"I'll see you there the first meal I'm free. By the way, do you want to
scan--"</p>

<p>"The ship's papers?" I said and hesitated.</p>

<p>He met me halfway. "Perhaps it would be better if you did. I'll have
the purser warned. He's a discreet soul. You'd better confide in
him."</p>

<p>He walked back with me to the bar at the head of the stairs and
spoke to the man on guard. "Mr. Sanders is to be admitted whenever he
wishes," he said and the man saluted. I fancied he looked at me more
curiously than ever and I wondered if he suspected my official
status.</p>

<p>Parey, the purser, was still in the throes of documentation when I
appeared but he took my intrusion in good part. "I've seen you before,"
he said. "What's it now? Something broken loose?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," I returned. "I'm coming to you in confidence though."
I told him much of what I had told Hume.</p>

<p>I THOUGHT he was a little shaken by the revelation but he tried to
make light of it.</p>

<p>"You fellows are always alarmists," he said, "particularly the
shore-end." It was odd how the old sea-jargon still lingered in
speech.</p>

<p>"The shore-end, AS you call it," I reminded him, "is staffed with
men who have all graduated in space."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," he grinned "They don't realize that conditions
have changed since they came back to the atmosphere. However, here's
the passenger list, shore-compiled, so any errors aren't mine. You'll
mark that."</p>

<p>I took it--the crew list too. Nothing startling in either--an
average ship': company, an average passenger list Earthmen
preponderantly, the minority of Martians and Venusians about equally
balanced. One name caught my eye as I ran down the list.</p>

<p>"Nomo Kell?" I said puzzled. "Queer name, that. It isn't of Earth
origin."</p>

<p>Parey smiled. "Nor Mars nor Venus either, I'll be bound. Like to see
his prints?"</p>

<p>He meant the duplicate identification papers and photographs that
are always handed in for checking at the office when an interplanetary
passage is booked. Strictly speaking Parey had no right to offer me the
documents. They are supposed to be confidential and ever had I demanded
sight of them he should have surrendered them only under protest. But I
think he realized that in my case the more I knew the less harm was
likely to come to anyone.</p>

<p>The details were not illuminating They ran to the effect that Nomo
Kell was a Martian citizen, qualification the statutory one of twenty
years residence. The spaces that should have contained his birthplace,
parentage and so on were bracketed by the one word <i>Unknown</i>.</p>

<p>"Queer," I commented.</p>

<p>"Queerer still," said Parey as he handed me the photo. "Look at this
and see why."</p>

<p>I held the thing up to the light and looked it over. The colors came
out exceptionally well and threw the man's, features into vivid relief.
The scale at the side of the picture showed that he stood between seven
and eight feet in height, a giant of his kind.</p>

<p>His eyes were an odd kind of purple. Even in that color print they
seemed extraordinarily alive. His skin, face ears and hands, was an odd
red that gave the suggestion of having been boiled.</p>

<p>But the queerest thing of all about him was the shape of his head, I
had never seen anything like it before. It was crested. A ridge of
something that looked like horn started a little above his forehead and
ran back, as I found from the note, to his occiput.</p>

<p>"Where in the Universe does such a one come from?" I asked. "Is he a
freak?"</p>

<p>Parey frowned. "Anything but that," he said. "He came across on our
last drift. In talk with some other passengers certain questions about
Mercury came up. He flatly contradicted the others' views, told them
quite definitely they were wrong, let it appear that in some way he
knew what he was talking about. See the suggestion?"</p>

<p>"That he is a Mercurian. But that's nonsense."</p>

<p>PAREY looked at me owlishly. "Because we haven't made that planet
yet eh? Too close to the Sun our scientists say, too risky. Perhaps so.
Nonetheless it would be easier for Mercurians, granted there are any
such, to come to us than-it would be for us to go to them."</p>

<p>"We don't even know it is inhabited," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"We don't even know that it isn't," he countered.</p>

<p>He was right there. I drew up a report that night before I went to
bed, condensed it as much as possible and took it to the signals room
for transmission to Harran. The operator looked it over in a puzzled
fashion.</p>

<p>"What the blazes is this?" he asked. "Don't you know all messages
must be written in a recognizable tongue?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't apply where I'm concerned," I said. "Send it as it
stands."</p>

<p>"Why?" he said, a trifle defiantly.</p>

<p>I showed him why, He stared at my badge with a droop to his lip, It
was marvellous the effect that little silver shape could have on the
recalcitrant.</p>

<p>I could see, however, that he was still curious as to the language
in which the message was written. I did not tell him it was a tongue
that had ceased to be a living language on Earth nearly fifteen hundred
years ago. He was too young to know that it was only three-quarters of
a century since it had ceased to be taught in the schools as a
so-called classical language.</p>

<p>I waited until the fading of the helio glow showed the message had
gone through and the flash-back brought an acknowledgment of its
receipt. Then I went off with the intention of turning in.</p>

<p>I had been but a few hours on the <i>Cosmos</i> but in that short space
of time my plans had been materially altered. What else might happen
before we entered the Martian atmosphere was purely a matter of
conjecture. I preferred not to speculate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>The Lunar Call</h3>

<p>I AWOKE to the sound of buzzing in my ears. It came to me that I had
overslept, that this was the warning note of the breakfast call. How
many, I wondered, would face the tables this morning.</p>

<p>Not many, I fancied. Even in these enlightened days a goodly
proportion of folk still suffer from a kind of space-sickness akin, no
doubt, to the <i>mal-de-mer</i> that once used to attack travellers on
Earth's oceans.</p>

<p>However the tables were fairly crowded when I reached the saloon.
Either our doctor was not a popular man--there was a fair sprinkling of
ladies present--or else he knew his work so well that he preferred
prevention to cure.</p>

<p>Hume, heavy-eyed and with his face lined was halfway through his
meal when I appeared. He caught my glance as I entered and beckoned me
to a vacant space beside him. I noted as I took my seat that my name
had already been affixed to the chair-back.</p>

<p>A Martian woman was my opposite, quite the loveliest creature I had
ever seen. She could not have been more than twenty-five and the full
glow of health made her fine eyes sparkle and her dark cheeks glow with
a greater vitality than we Earth people are used to seeing on our own
planet. Strange how, despite their height, these Martian girls seem so
wonderful. Her name, I learnt as introductions went around, was Jansca
Dirka.</p>

<p>The man who sat a plate away was a Dirka too but it did not
transpire whether he was her father or her brother and there was
nothing outwardly to show which he was. The way that they wear their
age is, to an Earthman, another puzzling feature of the Martians. I
have heard it said that they retain their bloom right to the very last,
then fade and die almost in a night.</p>

<p>Knowing Hume's leaning towards his wife's folk I was not surprised
to find I was the only Tellurian at the table. I had expected more
Martians if anything. Instead the remaining four were Venusians, those
quaint, not unlovable people, who somehow remind one almost equally of
a bird and a butterfly.</p>

<p>Father, mother and two daughters they were, the latter three very
interested in everything strange and new, yet with an interest that one
felt was purely evanescent. That, I am told, is the impression one
always receives on first making contact with Venusians. How far from
true of the race as a whole it is may be judged from the fact that it
was the Venusians who first discovered for us the practically
inexhaustible deposits of rolgar on our moon.</p>

<p>Rolgar, as everyone knows nowadays, is the substance--one can hardly
call it a mineral--without which space-flying could not have attained
its present ease and safety. The Venusian himself was an official of
the Rolgar Company, he told me, and was bound for the Archimedes
Landing on the Moon with a party of Earth miners. His wife and daughter
were stopping over with him. "No place for women," I hazarded.</p>

<p>"Not such a wilderness as used to be imagined," he answered me.
"Little troubles to be faced-due to variations of pressure and extremes
of temperature but on the whole quite a change for short period."</p>

<p>His wife and daughters seemed anxious to sample the new experience
as all women, no matter what their planet, welcome a novel sensation.
Mir Ong himself--such was his name--had paid more than one visit to our
satellite, so counted himself something of an authority on it.</p>

<p>HUME rose from his seat in the midst of our talk, gave me a careless
nod, then as he came round the back of my chair dropped a whispered
word in my ear. "Control room as soon you're ready," he said.</p>

<p>I could have lingered there at the table merely for the sake of
stealing glances at Jansca Dirka but something in Hume's look more than
his speech made me imagine an urgency behind h parting words. Also,
oddly now I come to think of it, I had a wish to see what Nomo Kell
looked like in the flesh.</p>

<p>As I came out onto the promenade deck I glanced through the
quartzite windows. We were veering in now towards the Moon and its disk
was beginning to fill the void ahead of us. The Earth behind was
dwindling, though its size was still considerable. I judged we had not
yet reached the midpoint gravity, for an odd quiver of the hull showed
the propulsive power of the rolgar engines was still on. In a little
they would be cut off and we could use the moon's attraction to draw us
onward until it became necessary to counteract the pull and
decelerate.</p>

<p>"A light-message for you," said Hume as I entered. He took an
envelope from the drawer and handed it to me. "I thought it better not
to mention the matter at table. One never knows."</p>

<p>Cautious, extra cautious man. Well, better that than a loose-lipped
babbler. I spread the flimsy out in front of me and translated as I
read. Though it came over Harran's signature it was merely an
acknowledgement of my overnight report, with the added note that if in
the event of a Guard's ship being handy when anything untoward occurred
I need not interrupt my holiday but could hand over investigation to
the patrol.</p>

<p>"Formal acknowledgment of my last night's report merely," I said
off-handedly to Hume.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," was his comment. "Though if more of these
messages keep coming and going our operators will be getting headches.
It's a code none of them has handled before."</p>

<p>"If they'd lived a century ago," I said a mite incautiously, "it
would have been child's play for them to read it."</p>

<p>He flashed a glance at me. "A dead language," he remarked and said
no more about it.</p>

<p>"By the way," I asked, not that it mattered much, but it gave him
something new to think about, "these Dirkas--who are they?"</p>

<p>"They're friends of my wife and myself. Dirka himself--her
father--is a Dirrector of the Martian Canal Company. The girl is
nothing. Being a Martian woman she need not work for a living."</p>

<p>That, from an Earth-man, was a subtle jibe at conditions on his own
planet or rather the planet of his race. I passed it by, however. There
was nothing to be gained by retorting that on Earth many women
preferred to work.</p>

<p>He eyed me curiously. "Sanders, how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-three," I said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"And unmarried as yet," he went on. "Well, there's time and, friend
of mine, by the comet's tail, the best I wish you is no worse luck than
I had myself."</p>

<p>I grinned. Thoughts of love had never come to me. Even now they
seemed as remote in thought as Alpha Centauri was in fact.</p>

<p>He ran on. "I suppose you have the whole ship's company more or less
neatly taped by now."</p>

<p>"No need of that," I returned.</p>

<p>"There's only one person aboard this ship that I'm interested in and
that only as a matter of curiosity."</p>

<p>"Who?" he said with a lift of the eyebrows. "I had no idea we were
harbouring any interesting personages--from your point of view--this
trip."</p>

<p>"Nomo Kell," I said.</p>

<p>He drew his eyebrows together at that, as though the name seemed
familiar, yet he could not quite place it. Briefly I described the
fellow to him.</p>

<p>"Queer," he remarked. "It strikes something in my memory, something
I wish I could recall clearly," he explained. "I can't, though. Some
legend of my wife's people."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the other Martians on board?" I hazarded.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "They would not know," he said quite definitely
but did not explain why.</p>

<p>AS I passed back along the promenade deck I met Nomo Kell himself
for the first time in the flesh. It was well that I had been warned of
his appearance. Had I come upon him without foreknowledge of what I
would see I don't quite know how it would have affected me. Yet he was
not fearsome. It was the utter unexpectedness of him that
astounded.</p>

<p>Nomo Kell's print had flattered him. Leave out the flaring purple of
his magnetic eyes, the crested abnormality of his head--size of his
body apart--and there was little to differentiate him from the ordinary
planetarian.</p>

<p>But seen now, walking within a few paces of me, I sensed something
else. A force, perhaps--a radiation. I could not tell.</p>

<p>He gave me a fleeting incurious glance and passed by. I might have
stood there staring after him but for a voice in my ear and the touch
of a hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"You find him interesting, Mr. Sanders?"</p>

<p>It was Jansca Dirka at my elbow. I reddened. I had been caught in an
act of rudeness, no light matter when one is likely to trench on touchy
interplanetary conventions.</p>

<p>"And a little more, Miss Dirka," I said, using the Earth style of
address. I have never quite accustomed myself to the long string of
phrases, flowery and complimentary, which these Martians employ.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," she said gravely. "You have noticed his
steps?"</p>

<p>I had not. I hardly gave them a glance until she drew my attention
to them. Now I saw that he walked with a peculiar mincing gait, a sort
of gingerliness, as though each movement was carefully timed and
measured.</p>

<p>"He seems," I said slowly as it dawned on me, "to be deliberately
shorten his steps, walking with extra care as we would on the Moon's
surface."</p>

<p>"Exactly. The <i>Cosmos</i> is adjusted Earth gravity. We travelled
Martians and Venusians have become so accustomed to its variations from
our planets that our reaction is automatic, But he..." She flung out
her hands with a curiously expressive gesture.</p>

<p>I caught the flash of the idea in mind. "It looks almost," I said,
still a trifle doubtfully, "as though he was used to a larger planet
than we."</p>

<p>"It looks like that," she mimicked "I might even suggest it would be
well not to let such an idea--or its opposite--lie dormant in the back
of your mind."</p>

<p>With that and a tingling glance she turned and was gone, leaving me
wondering. What did she see or know I could or did not? What indeed
made her suggest anything of the sort to me? No hint of my office, I
could swear, escaped Hume. I could only think I somehow, uncannily, she
may have guessed.</p>

<p>Our engines shuddered, a shiver ran through our whole framework,
then died away. We had passed the midpoint of gravity, and with our
motors off were utilizing the Moon's pull to draw us rapidly towards
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>The Wreck in the Void</h3>

<p>I have spoken of the Moon as airless, yet that is not strictly
correct. Habit, however, is a hard thing to cast aside, and one clings
stubbornly to old beliefs even in the face of the newer facts. Our
satellite, as we have known for centuries, lacks atmosphere such as we
possess, and its day and night, each of fourteen Earth days in
duration, swing from torrid heat in the one to the extremes of
perishing cold in the other. Butin the rifts and hollows and the
abysmal depths of the craters air still lingers, tenuous and all but
unbreathable to us, but air nevertheless. Such life as there exists on
the Moon lives mostly underground, or did until the advent of the
rolgar mines.</p>

<p>To counteract the extremes of heat and cold, and secure a constant
supply of air at earth pressure, huge buildings have been erected. Each
mine is practically an enclosed city, entered through airlocks. It was
on one of these airlocks that the <i>Cosmos</i> had come to rest; one of her
ports was jointed to a port in the airlock, forming a sort of enclosed
gangway, through which passengers ascended and descended.</p>

<p>Apart from the mechanical ingenuity that aided the embarkation there
was nothing to see of any interest. Give me a landing in the free air
every time. From where I stood I could see through the quartzite side
of the promenade deck above and beyond the airlock, while I was able at
the same time to run a speculative eye over the passengers leaving and
arriving. Those taking off were mostly Earth miners, rough, rugged
fellows, with an odd Earth official with them, and, of course, my
acquaintances the Venerian family of Mir Ongar.</p>

<p>There were not so many coming on board. Mostly Venerians. A couple
of those ubiquitous planet-trotting Martians with them to add a leaven
to the dish. We took on no Earth-men. When one comes to think of it, it
is a curious thing that the Moon should hold least attraction for those
who are closest to it. If it had not been for the Venerians and their
discovery of rolgar I believe we would have been content for ever to
sheer past it into space. As it is the Moon--or rather its rolgar
mines--gives us the means of holding the balance of peace in the
Universe; the sinews of interplanetary war are to a great extent ours,
and none can fight should we decide to cut off supplies.</p>

<p>Our stay on the Moon was only of short duration. An airport
inspector or two donned oxygen helmets and made a thorough examination
of our landing gear and gravity screen apparatus before passing us out.
As soon as that was done and our clearance had been issued our port was
sealed and disconnected from that of the airlock, the signal given, and
the lift begun.</p>

<p>Beneath us Archimedes dropped away until the black circle of its
crater was no more than a shrivelled ring. Mars flared up redly ahead,
though presently we shifted our course a little as though we meant to
leave it to our left. This however, was due merely to the fact that we
were in a sense, circle sailing. It must not be forgotten that if we
were travelling in space, so too was the planet of our destination. Our
course was set exactly for that point in the void, where, according to
our astronomical charts, our orbit, if one can use the expression, and
that of Mars should intersect. A ticklish job, you must understand, is
this of space navigation, requiring a remarkable intricacy of
calculation and cross-calculation.</p>

<p>So the days passed. Once we sighted a meteor heading, it seemed,
directly for us, but our repeller ray sent it rocketing off on a new
path.</p>

<p>A finger touching me lightly on the shoulder brought me with a jerk
out of the depths of sleep. I touched a button at the wall side of my
bunk and the light tube above my head glowed brightly. I blinked. Gond,
the first officer, was standing beside me. Seeing that I was awake:</p>

<p>"Quickly, Mr Sanders," he said in a half-whisper. "The skipper wants
you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I queried.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Something I sighted out in the void of space. It was
my control hour. I called him, he sent me to call you."</p>

<p>"I'm coming." I slid out of my bunk. "I'll be there--control-room, I
suppose?--as soon as I can dress."</p>

<p>"Quickly, quickly," he breathed again. He knew not what it was he
had sighted--some wandering mystery of space, no doubt--but that the
urgent need of my presence had been impressed on him deeply enough it
was plain to see.</p>

<p>"I won't waste a minute," I said. "You can go back. I'll follow
almost on your heels."</p>

<p>Indeed, I was half dressed before the door shut on him. A Guard
sleeps often in his clothes; when he does not he can get into them with
a minimum loss of time.</p>

<p>It wanted two seconds to the minute I had allowed myself when I
slipped through the door in my turn, fastening buttons as I went. At
that hour no one save the officers and crew was likely to be about; I
need not fear that, half-clad, I would run into any of the
passengers.</p>

<p>Hume himself awaited me, dressed only in tunic and shorts. The
control-room was warm enough to make up for any deficiencies of
costume.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked the moment I stood beside him. He did not
reply but motioned me to the screen that communicated with our look-out
"eyes". The screen darkened momentarily, then flashed into light as the
beam from our searchlight shot out and picked up the object that had
occasioned the alarm.</p>

<p>For some seconds I was not quite sure what it was. Possibly because
it was drifting towards us end on, I thought for a moment that it was a
meteor, but the slowness of its approach should have warned me from the
start that it was not that at all. Then as we swung round and I could
see it broad-side on it looked more like a space-flier. That indeed was
what I would have felt satisfied it was but for the absence of lights
on board. A long cigar-shaped object, tapering to a point at one end,
made blunt and warty at the other by the discharge tubes that clustered
there.</p>

<p>"Can you get her name?" Hume whispered to me.</p>

<p>I could not. But I made sundry adjustments to the scale knobs at the
side of the screen and the projection of the space-flier seemed
suddenly to leap forward and become closer.</p>

<p>With some little difficulty I at last picked out her name. "M-E 75
A/B," I read from the line painted near her prow.</p>

<p>"Mars-Earth," Hume amplified. "Carrying A and B class traffic,
passengers and freight. Urn. This is your job, Sanders, I think. I
wonder what's gone dead in her?"</p>

<p>"That's yet to learn. How did you pick her up?"</p>

<p>"Our locator positioned her long before we were able to see her.
We--Gond, that is--thought it was another meteorite. But you see it
isn't."</p>

<p>He paused and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Sanders," he said abruptly, "I am in your hands. What am I to
do?"</p>

<p>"I'd like a look at her, a closer one, if I may. Can we lay
alongside?"</p>

<p>"We can board her if you wish."</p>

<p>"I'd better. I wish you'd give the orders."</p>

<p>He threw me a smile at that. This big bluff man had his weakness,
and I played on it that night, partly from a sense of courtesy, partly
because it was policy. As long as I did not interfere with his command,
just so long as I asked him as favours what I was entitled to order or
demand, he was my grateful warm-hearted friend. Something of his
appreciation of my consideration, my care not to humiliate him before
his own officers showed in his face. I left it to him to give
instructions, and set myself to watch the craft itself. We had veered a
little, our speed was slackening, yet we would have to move round in a
wide circle before, perhaps in another half-hour, we could come back
and sheer in beside the stranger craft. Our engines, which had for a
while been silent--for in free space once a certain pace is reached
impetus and freedom from friction carry us onward--took up an odd
pulsation, just enough to steady us.</p>

<p>Momentarily I lost sight of the derelict, picked her up again and
again from all sorts of odd angles as the movable "eye" mounted on our
prow swung round as we altered our course. Then abruptly I saw the
length of the derelict looming large beside us, a black bulk that
almost filled the vision screen. Came there a slight jar and I realized
that our attractors had caught and held her.</p>

<p>Word came up from the port control that we were connecting and that
our air-tight extension had been sealed against the derelict's nearest
port.</p>

<p>As I turned away from the vision screen Hume caught my arm.</p>

<p>"Can I come?" he whispered in my ear. "I'm interested..."</p>

<p>I nodded. "Certainly. I'd like a witness, and someone to check my
own observations. What are her tests?"</p>

<p>He spoke into a tube, then turned to me. "Normal interior air
pressure," he reported. "Temperature 28 degrees Fahrenheit."</p>

<p>I whistled. Four degrees below freezing point. Something queer
there. Either she should have dropped to absolute zero, or else
maintained the normal interior temperature. What in the name of the
Universe was holding her constant?</p>

<p>I took down one of the emergency coats from a hook, a heavy
fur-lined fabric that covered me from chin to ankle, slipped my feet
into the insulated boots one of our helpers held towards me, and drew
them thigh-high. With the coat drawn in and its bifurcations buttoned
tightly round each leg I was insulated against cold. I could even feel
the warmth of the heater wires in the fabric as the current from the
battery fixed to the back thrilled through them. I drew on my gloves
and someone clamped on my air helmet, sealing it temperature tight on
to the metal collar at the neck of my coat.</p>

<p>Each helmet contained a radio attachment that provided means of
communication with each other and with the ship if necessary. I tried
mine. It sparked, and a fraction of second later I heard Hume's voice
burring in the receiver at my ear. Sealed against air and temperature
variations, we could yet converse as we chose.</p>

<p>"Ready, Sanders?" he said, and when I answered in the affirmative he
led the way down the direct ladder to the connecting port.</p>

<p>The connecting port, really a long metal tube that could collapse in
on itself telescope fashion, had been extended to the wall of the
derelict and clamped there. The door the latter's port had been opened
mechanically, but the blasts of normally heated air the fans were
sending through our craft pulsed along the connecting tube and kept the
temperature there from diminishing perceptibly.</p>

<p>The moment we stepped through the open port of the stranger vessel,
however, we sensed the change. Despite our heated emergency kit the
cold air lapped round us, clutching our limbs with icy fingers. For the
moment the grip of it, no less than the inky blackness of the ship's
interior, halted us. I had a feeling that the cold was not so much the
absence of heat as a sentient thing in itself.</p>

<p>Hume touched the button of the portable light at his b and I
followed suit. The white beams sprang out, filling the place with a
light akin to natural daylight.</p>

<p>There was nothing to see here, but then neither of us expected that
there would be anything. It was up in the control departments and the
living quarters that we hoped or feared; neither of us was quite sure
which--to make our discoveries.</p>

<p>The direct ladder that led straight to the upper control department
seemed clear, and with my place as an Interplanetary Guard to sustain I
took the lead. The trap-door was closed, but it opened at a touch and I
climbed into the compartment, then turned to give a hand to my
colleague. A moment later we stood together, staring round the
cabin.</p>

<p>It was nothing like as modern as its equivalent on the <i>Cosmos</i>.
From some of the devices it seemed the craft was at least ten years
old. I made for the log book. Search brought it to light in the drawer
of the captain's table, and a comparison of dates showed that it had
been written up within twenty-four hours. Therefore whatever had
happened to render the craft derelict had occurred within the measure
of one Earth day.</p>

<p>Both of us had naturally expected to find some trace of humanity in
the control-room, bodies, if not living creatures. But there was no
sign of anyone and no sign of a struggle. For all we could see the men
on duty might have walked out the door in as orderly a fashion as
though they were going ashore.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" I asked Hume.</p>

<p>His voice buzzed with a perturbed note in my ear. "I don't know what
to think," he said. "It's weird, uncanny. It's--" Whatever else he was
going to say he pulled himself up with a jerk.</p>

<p>"We can't form any definite opinion about anything until we've
searched the ship from control to keel."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I agreed, but as he made a move towards the door I
stayed him.</p>

<p>"Let us read the dials before we go," I suggested.</p>

<p>He moved towards me again, and we studied the indicators. The engine
dials showed an ample supply of fuel, and the stud had been pushed over
to "Stop". No question about that then. The engines had not run down or
been brought up automatically. Human agency or something akin to it had
been at work here.</p>

<p>Mindful of what Harran had told me I turned to the heating machinery
indicator. It showed that the apparatus was still running. Yet here we
were in an atmosphere at present a few degrees below freezing point,
whereas the thermometer should actually have registered something
between sixty and seventy degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Curious on this point I turned to the wall thermometer. The glass
was shattered, the mercury had vanished. From the way in which the
glass had broken it was impossible to say whether the damage was
deliberate or due to excessive cold. If it was the latter the control
cabin itself must have at one period endured a temperature of at least
forty-four degrees below zero!</p>

<p>Hume clutched my arm convulsively.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked, starting.</p>

<p>"I thought...I felt," he spoke in a strained voice, "as though
someone...or something...had just come in."</p>

<p>I swung round sharply. The door, which a moment or so before had
been closed, was now open a space. Even as I stared the gap seemed
perceptibly to widen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>The Sleepers</h3>

<p>As a man I am no braver that the rest. I know there are more things
in the Universe than we have as yet managed to tabulate, forms of life,
abodes of intelligence, that may appear monstrous to us, just as
perhaps we appear monstrous to them. But as against this I believe--and
experience has yet to prove me wrong--that everything there is must
face dissolution sooner or later, that it can indeed be killed suddenly
and violently, provided only that one can reach a vital spot.</p>

<p>My courage was oozing from the tips of my insulated boots as I
turned towards the door, and I was already aware of an uncomfortable,
prickly sensation about the region of my backbone. Nevertheless the
fact of another's presence gave me comfort, so, taking my ray tube in
my free hand, I swung the door wide open with the other, and sent the
beam of my lamp searching down the dark passage outside. I saw nothing.
No visible entity appeared. My audiphones, which would have recorded
the sound of any movement, however faint, remained stubbornly silent.
Only a wave of cold that threatened to bite through the warmth of my
emergency coat seemed to flow in on us like a living thing.</p>

<p>"Nothing there," I said in a tone meant to be reassuring. "Nothing,"
Hume repeated, and I could have sworn to a faint note of relief in his
voice. "I'll tell you what, Jack," he ran on, "it's the uncanniness of
this place that's giving us the creeps, that's what it is. The sooner
we pry into every nook and corner the better. We're losing time as it
is and letting our nerves get the better of us."</p>

<p>There was sound good sense in that, but oh, how I wished we had
brought some others with us. I would have given much then to have had a
couple of my own sturdy, hardheaded Guards beside me. Something of what
I was thinking must have impinged on Hume's consciousness, for:</p>

<p>"It's a pity we didn't bring a man or two with us," he grumbled in
his helmet.</p>

<p>"And have them take a risk we don't care to face?" I countered.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there's that to it," he answered. "Let's get ahead before
we start thinking over things."</p>

<p>He tried to push past me, do doubt in the hope that in action he
would find a spur to his own courage, but I stayed him. These
space-captains may rate themselves as highly as they please, but when
it comes to facing the dangers of the unknown it is the Guards'
privilege to lead. I think he guessed my motive, for he flung me a
whimsical smile, plain to see through the glass front of his
helmet.</p>

<p>I shut the door carefully behind us. I was more or less sure now
that some unnoticed motion of the vessel had sent it stealing open, but
I had no mind in case I was mistaken that I should be taken unawares.
If that door should open again I would know of a certainity that there
was an intelligent agency at work.</p>

<p>As we traversed the passage to the promenade deck my mind played
round what was to me the most significant feature we had so far come
across, the utter emptiness of the control-room. I could not imagine
any officer of the Inter-planetary Service leaving his post unless
there was good reason for it. And everything pointed to the supposition
that the desertion, if such it could be called, had included everyone
on duty in its scope.</p>

<p>Our beams wavered down the line of the promenade deck, fell on the
chairs spread about the space, and simultaneously we stopped dead, and
looked fearfully at each other.</p>

<p>"Did you see it?" Hume whispered.</p>

<p>"See what?" I asked, for I wanted corroboration of the reliability
of my own eyesight.</p>

<p>"The people sitting in their chairs...still...lifeless."</p>

<p>So I was not dreaming. Hume had seen what I had seen.</p>

<p>"Hume," I said abruptly, "we haven't thought of it before. We've
taken certain things for granted. But there should be buttons about the
wall here...lights...better than our own portable lamps.
Perhaps after all they may be working."</p>

<p>He swung the beam of his own lamp round, then his mittened hand
closed over a stud and drew it down. Instantly the length of the
promenade deck sprang into light. I shuddered. Row on row of chairs,
most with occupants, met our eyes. They sat as stiff and still as
figures carven from wood. Dead, it seemed, without a doubt.</p>

<p>I leaned over and touched the nearest figure, a woman, on the cheek,
and even through the heated thickness of my gloves her flesh struck
cold. I drew back with a gasping sigh.</p>

<p>"Hume," I said, "This is beyond us. We must know how these people
died, if they're dead; if not, what's wrong with them. And that's a
doctor's job."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm thinking," he agreed. "I'd better call him up?" He
looked to me for approval.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>He adjusted his communicators to the ship's, and purely out of
curiosity I listened in on him.</p>

<p>"That you, Gond?" I heard him say. "Good. It's Hume speaking. Send
Dr Spence over at once. What's he to bring? I'm sure I can't say. Oh,
yes"--I'd whispered to him--"say it may be suspended animation, or cold
exposure. That's data enough for him. And, yes, better send two men
with him. The most reliable. And give them a ray tube each. They can
reach us through the control-room. No, nothing yet...of any
importance."</p>

<p>I liked that. He was not giving anything away, forgetful, no doubt,
that with the stranger ship's lights on and the two craft riding side
by side the deck we were on would be plainly visible. Thanks be it was
during the sleep-hours, else we would have had eager, excited, curious,
perhaps fearful passengers peering at us across the gap from the
quartzite windows. I thought of that, thought too what might happen if
some sleepless individual began to wander along the deck, saw, gaped,
and went off to wake his friends.</p>

<p>"Tell Gond," I cut in in a quick whisper, "to close his shutters on
the promenade deck. Else we may be watched. What we have to do may be
better done without curious onlookers."</p>

<p>He put that through, and I heard the click as he cut out.</p>

<p>"We'd better wait," I said in answer to Hume's unspoken question.
"More may turn on what Spence can tell us than we think." Nevertheless
I put in some of the time of waiting by looking about me. It seemed
that everyone had been frozen into immobility as he or she sat. The
thing itself had come upon them suddenly, for there was nothing either
of surprise of horror in any face.</p>

<p>The doctor came with his attendants, stared at the still figures,
made such tests as he could, then straightened up and cased us. In the
white light of the vessel's deck I could see his face show blank
through the glass front of his helmet. His hand went up to make some
adjustment of his audiphone before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Frankly," he said in answer to my question, "I can't tell you what
it is. They've been frozen, that's what it amounts to, but several of
the characteristic signs are absent."</p>

<p>I guessed what he meant. I'd looked closely for the blue and purple
splotches, the other signs of a man frozen to death, and had failed to
find them. Frozen they were in a sense, yet perhaps turned to stone
more nearly described them. A little bead of perspiration trickled from
my forehead down my nose; the glass front of my helmet seemed to be
clouding a little; there was a feeling of warmth that I had not noticed
before beginning to permeate my body under the emergency coat. Of a
sudden the meaning of it came to me.</p>

<p>"Hume, Spence," I called through the audiophone, "It's getting
warmer. Can't you feel it, both of you?"</p>

<p>Something akin to a blank consternation showed for the moment in
Hume's face; the doctor looked interested, albeit a trifle puzzled.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," I ran on, "this cold's disappearing? The heaters
are beginning to make themselves felt. All the time they've been
warming up the air, not perceptibly until now. But it's a big lift from
forty-four degrees below zero up to the twenty-eight it was when we
came on board. That means that from the time this happened--whatever it
was---until the moment we stepped aboard the heaters had raised the
temperature a matter of seventy-two degrees, from minus to plus, a
tremendous lift. What's more, they're still doing it. It must be
getting back to normal now."</p>

<p>"But why," said Hume, puzzled, "didn't the heaters freeze out too
when this happened?" He made a clumsy gesture of his mittened hand to
include the figures on the chairs.</p>

<p>The answer to that hit me almost the instant he asked the
question.</p>

<p>"Simple," I explained. "The heater plant runs in a vacuum. External
cold couldn't effect it."</p>

<p>"Of course." His voice was tingling. "I should have thought of that
before."</p>

<p>"I didn't until just now." I put my hands up clumsily and caught at
the fastenings at the back of my helmet.</p>

<p>"Steady, man, what are you doing?" Hume said agitatedly.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to roast. Perhaps we can take our kit off now. At
least I'll be the first to try."</p>

<p>"But the air," Hume's voice was vibrant with warning. "We got a
normal pressure, but there may be something in it, something inimical
to life."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk," I answered. I had seen something out of the
corner of my eye, something that looked a mite uncanny. I preferred not
say what it was--yet. But it made me think that the air was safe,
breathable at any rate.</p>

<p>I fumbled at the fastenings myself, for Hume mumbled he did not want
what might happen on his conscience if anything went wrong, and in the
circumstances I was not inclined to press him to help me. But I saw the
doctor was following my example, though the two men waited to see what
their skipper was doing first.</p>

<p>The helmet came off at last and the cool air hit my face. Cool air,
not cold. The temperature, as I had surmised, was lifting degree by
degree as the heaters struggled with and overcame whatever it was had
caused the cold. The air was breathable. At least I could sense no
foreign element in it, nothing to account for that abrupt drop in
temperature.</p>

<p>In a moment I had stripped my emergency coat, leaving only my boots.
They did not matter so much. The doctor was free of his trappings by
this, too. He took one gulp of the air, and looked across at me, then I
saw his eyes widen.</p>

<p>His glance had travelled past me to the chair at my back. I whirled
round. The woman whom I had first examined was stirring, yes, visibly
stirring. Her bosom rose and fell, gently at first, then more rapidly
as she gulped in the air. Her eyes opened...wide. She stared about
her. Her glance fell on us. One expression after another chased with
the rapidity of light across her face--astonishment--incredulity, fear,
I thought.</p>

<p>An inarticulate cry, a sort of strangled scream, issued from her
lips, and her head dropped forward in a faint. Spence sprang to her
aid.</p>

<p>But the little cry, almost soundless though it was, might have been
some signal already agreed upon. All over the deck figures were
stirring. It seemed that one surprise on another was being stacked up
in front of us.</p>

<p>Hume, with his helmet off and himself half-way out of his coat,
uttered an exclamation. I gasped as I followed the direction he
indicated. A tall man with the insignia of an Inter-planetary skipper
on his collar and coat-sleeves had risen languidly from a chair some
distance down the deck, coming to his feet slowly, with a bewildered
expression on his face, as though he had just been roused out of a
sound sleep.</p>

<p>His expression changed as he saw us. Surprise, anger at this seeming
alien invasion of his vessel, seized on him. He made a quick movement
forward, then came striding down the deck towards us.</p>

<p>"What's...what's the meaning of this?" he demanded. Then a
puzzled look came into his eyes and he passed one hand across his
forehead.</p>

<p>"How...how did I get here?" he said bewilderedly. "The last I
remember was in the control-room, thinking it was getting rather on the
cold side, wondering if anything had gone wrong with the heaters."</p>

<p>I took his arm. "Captain," I said, "there's a mystery here. With
your help we'll solve it. We came on you, floating in free space,
without lights, you...your people stretched out apparently dead...
as you were just now."</p>

<p>"Who...what are you? From what ship?" he asked quickly, the
light of an odd fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>I slipped my fingers in a pocket, found my badge and extended it
flat in my palm towards him.</p>

<p>"You're safe...in good hands," I said. "Whatever you have to
tell, you can say without fear."</p>

<p>For the moment he hesitated, staring away from us through the
quartzite windows of his ship at the black shadow of the shuttered bulk
of the <i>Cosmos</i> floating a few yards away.</p>

<p>"My officers, the men who were with me..." he said a trifle
incoherently, running his eyes down the long lines of chairs.</p>

<p>The passengers were stirring now, coming back to life, all a little
bewildered if one could judge from their expressions. The woman who had
fainted had now revived, and it struck me that she was the only one of
the lot who had shown any sign of fear on regaining consciousness.
Could it be that she alone of all that company had seen something? At
least I was not minded to leave the ship until I had had a chance of
questioning her.</p>

<p>"Good," I said, "your first duty is to your officers. I think you'll
find them all here, on this deck." You see, I was beginning to have a
glimmer of what had happened, though the precise motive behind it all
eluded me. "Get them together, bring them somewhere where we can talk.
All that were on duty when...when whatever it was happened."</p>

<p>I dropped my voice an octave, came a little closer to him.
"Captain," I said, "Don't look round. But tell me quick, who is that
woman just behind us?"</p>

<p>He turned slowly as though looking down the run of the deck. I could
have sworn his eyes did not so much as touch the woman in passing,
but:</p>

<p>"A Mrs Galon," he whispered back. "An Earth-woman, she says, though
I take leave to doubt it. Why?"</p>

<p>"We'll want her," I told him. "After we've talked with you. But see
she doesn't move away. I'd rather she had no opportunity to speak with
the others in the interval."</p>

<p>"As you wish," he said deferentially. There was magic in that little
badge of mine, a magic that made me proud to belong to the Service it
represented. After all, we Guards may hold up schedules, and interfere
much in many ways, but it can never be said that we use our power at
any time for anything but good. Perhaps that is in the long run the
secret of our power.</p>

<p>"Better," the captain shot at me in a whisper, "better get your men
to tend her. Mine...I don't know...Everything's bound to be
disorganized."</p>

<p>I gave the cue to Hume, and he passed the word to his two men. I
gathered they were to cut Mrs Galon out a moment after we left,
shepherd her after us, and keep her waiting in the outer room until we
were ready for her. As it was while the skipper was rousing the watch
on duty the others of us unobtrusively slid between her and the rest of
the passengers.</p>

<p>I don't think she noticed it, or if she did she gave no sign. Her
interest seemed centred on Spence, perhaps because the was the first of
our company with whom she had come in contact, the only one at any rate
who had paid any sort of attention to her. That it had been purely
medical attention did not, I felt certain, matter in the least.</p>

<p>A moment it seemed and the space-ship's captain came striding back
to us, behind him a little straggle of his men.</p>

<p>"I'm ready now, gentlemen," he said, "if you will follow me."</p>

<p>He led the way along the deck, but it struck me in the instant's
glimpse I had caught of his face as he passed that he seemed of a
sudden to have grown worried and a little afraid.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>M-E 75</i> pushed open the door we had so recently
shut, switched on the light and stood aside for us to enter. We went in
followed by the duty man, the second in command and the captain
himself.</p>

<p>When the door was shut--"My name is James Bensen, am I am captain of
this ship," he said. "We are homeward bound from Enghan, Mars, to
London, Earth. Crew, sixteen all told. Passengers, forty-three adults,
two children. Cargo, marsonite in bulk. Here"--he flung open a drawer
of his table, and drew out a steel-box--"here are my papers."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said, as I took them. He had made merely the formal
declaration and carrying traffic that is required of every space boat
that is stopped and challenged by the Interplanetary Guard. Before I
went further I ran through his papers, found they agreed with his
declaration.</p>

<p>"And now," I went on, "before you start your story it may help if I
tell you what I found."</p>

<p>I gave him in detail a sketch of all that had transpired from the
moment oour locators had picked up his ship drifting free until the
time he regained consciousness on his own promenade deck. I was
careful, however, not to hint that other ships had apparently suffered
in the same way.</p>

<p>His brow knitted as my story proceeded. It was plain he was more
perturbed and bewildered than ever.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can tell you anything much at all," he said
half apologetically. "Things were going as usual, I was in control. My
second and duty man were with me when I fancied it was getting a bit on
the cold side. The indicator showed, however, that the heating machiner
was running as usual."</p>

<p>I interrupted. "Can you give me any idea of the time of this?"</p>

<p>He did a brief calculation in his head. The Pause made me realize
that he was still running on Enghan (martian) time.</p>

<p>"It would be the equivalent of about eight P.M. Earth Western time,"
he said. "The passengers would have just finished dinner, I fancy. I
was on the point of ordering the duty men to call up the heater control
and ask what was wrong when I suddenly dropped into unconsciousness.
When I came to I was propped up in a chair on the promenade deck."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said formally.</p>

<p>He looked at me a trifle anxiously. "It doesn't help matters much,
does it?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say--as yet," I told him.</p>

<p>"Now the others."</p>

<p>The second and the duty man had much the same story to tell.</p>

<p>"On the face of it," said Bensen at the end, "it looks as though we
were carried from here down the deck while we were unconscious.
Though," he added thoughtfully, "I can't see how anyone could have
existed through the sort of cold that we felt."</p>

<p>"You did," I pointed out. "All of you."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I didn't put that too well," he said. "I should have
said 'retained consciousness' rather than 'existed.' A cold chilling
enough to send us into a torpor for some hours should have had the same
effect on anything--anybody else, I mean."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," I said. "Suppose the people--we'll assume that's
what they were--who moved you came on board in emergency suits like
ours, insulated against cold."</p>

<p>A light sprang up in Bensen's eyes. "You're assuming, of course,
that the cold was an artificially induced state but it seems to me that
there's one point you've overlooked. Assuming you're correct, the cause
of the cold must have been introduced from outside, perhaps in the form
of a gas. The biggest argument against that however, is the fact that
we are to all intents and purposes hermetically sealed between ports
besides being insulated against the cold of space."</p>

<p>"We're dealing with facts," I said a trifle testily, "not with
theories. The fact is that something happened here to lower the
temperature to such a degree that everyone lost consciousness. The
heaters are functioning perfectly normally, so whatever occurred was
not due to any breakdown on their part.</p>

<p>"And if you want any further evidence that it was the work of an
intelligent agency you have it in the fact that you and the others on
duty recovered consciousness in another part of the ship."</p>

<p>THE captain looked crestfallen. "That's true," he admitted wryly.
"That being so," I went on, "the point to clear up at the start is
whether the trouble originated on board or arrived from outer
space."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," Bensen cut in with a light in his eyes, "that
there's a possibility that someone on board, some passenger perhaps,
was at the back of this? That would appear too patently
impossible."</p>

<p>"In what way?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Cold like heat has to be manufactured," he explained. "You need
apparatus and chemicals and so on."</p>

<p>I saw what he was driving at. Even in the fourth decade of the
twentieth century science was beginning to realize that cold was not
the absence of heat but a state quite as distinct and as readily
induced, even though it happened to be at the other end of the
temperature scale.</p>

<p>"And what you're working up to, I've no doubt," I said, "is that no
such apparatus or chemicals could possibly be smuggled on board. The
examination of passengers' baggage on embarking is pretty strict at the
Earth ports but how about the other planets?"</p>

<p>"Mars," Hume put in in his deep voice, "is even stricter if
possible. No, my friend, you can rest assured that nothing of the sort
could have got past the examiners at Enghan."</p>

<p>"Very good," I said. "That's impossible. Remains the other
alternative then--that some space visitors half-froze you into a state
of unconsciousness then boarded the vessel with some object yet to
transpire."</p>

<p>"One moment." It was Hume who interrupted. "Tell me why everyone was
half-frozen--if you're correct in saying that--instead of being wholly
frozen, stiff and stark."</p>

<p>"The answer seems simple enough," I retorted. "The heaters were
runnin all the time, and once the nadir of temperature was reached they
graduallu managed to overcome the condition. No-one was left in the
frozen state long enough for harm to ensue."</p>

<p>"But even that's only the beginning," Bensen said glumly. "Admitting
we've reasoned rightly up to this juncture, admitting further that by
some means yet to be discovered space raiders made a entrance to the
ship, we've still to settle who or what they were and what exactly they
came for."</p>

<p>"What of value have you on board?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he told me, "other than our Marsonite cargo and that as
you can see from the indicators still shows intact. Looks as if the
whole thing was absolutely without motive."</p>

<p>I wondered what, if anything, had been removed from the other
space-ship Harran had told me about.</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken," I said, quickly "we have a witness of
sorts--Mrs Galon. I think she knows or saw something. Will you have
somebody bring her in?"</p>

<p>She came, glancing quetioningly from one to the other of our little
group. Even the presence of the doctor did not seem to reassure her. I
imagine that during the wait she must have been turning matters over in
her mind, perhaps finding a lengthening fear beginning to throw its
shadow across her path.</p>

<p>Yet she was a woman of character and decision. Before any of us
could speak she lifted her head, quite regally and swept us with a
glance one could almost call defiant. "Well, gentlemen," she said, "why
have I been brought here and kept uder guard awaiting your pleasure?"
She turned to the one man of our little group she knew. "Perhaps you,
Captain Bensen, can explain it?"</p>

<p>"The doing is not mine, Mrs. Galon," he said. "I'm under orders too.
We are in the hands of the Guard."</p>

<p>IN such a moment one can imagine all sorts of things, most of them
withny foundation in fact at all, I thought, however, though probably I
was mistaken, that a glance of understanding passed between them.</p>

<p>"At least in the hands of one representative of it," I said, and
bowed.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a genuine interest she had not hitherto
displayed, irritation at her detention appeared to have vanished
entirely.</p>

<p>"Then--" she said. "Then, I wasn't dreamming. It wasn't a nightmare
if the Guard is playing a part in it."</p>

<p>"You saw something," I said sharply, "In those few minutes on the
deck in it chair before you fell asleep something happened. What was
it?"</p>

<p>"If I said just what I saw or rather what I fancy I saw--no one
would believe me," she said a little fearfully, "No one will doubt
you," I told her. "Listen to me, Mrs. Galon. I can tell you something
that may help you. I can trust you to keep it to yourself, not breathe
a word of it to the other passengers?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said. "I won't say a word to a soul."</p>

<p>Frankly I did not believe her. Not that it mattered much. But
thinking she was being taken into my confidence she was almost certain
to tell me without reservation everything she knew.</p>

<p>"This, then," I said slowly, "is not the only ship that has had a
similar adventure. This, however, is the first ship I've boarded and it
is my business to get to the bottom of this particular mystery. If you
can give me the slightest any help the Service and I will forever be
your debtor."</p>

<p>Flowery, you will say, and so I thought and hated myself while
saying it--but something told me she was the type to whom such phrases
were meat and drink. Out of the corner of one eye I saw Hume
frowning.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said. "We-ell, I don't know if there is much to tell
really. I was just sitting in my chair on the deck just where you found
me. Of a sudden I began to feel cold. I wondered if anything had
happened to the heaters. Then I thought perhaps I'd better go to my
cabin for a wrap.</p>

<p>"But I could not move a limb, not even a finger, only my eyes. Why
they weren't paralyzed too I can't say. Then there was that feeling of
intolerable cold and another feeling on top of it just as if I were
sinking away into unconsciousness under an anesthetic. Not actually an
unpleasant feeling at that.</p>

<p>"I think I must have been on the verge of going, for things seemed
very misty before my eyes. Then the odd thing happened that I'm still
not sure wasn't something I dreamt. Two figures carrying someone came
down the length of the deck, The person being carried, a limp
unconscious body, must have been Captain Bensen or one of the officers.
I could see only the uniform.</p>

<p>"But it was the people, things, whatever you care to call them that
were carrying the body that--that made me think I was dreaming. Figures
perhaps eight or nine feet high, higher than any Martian. They weren't
real, not tangible, They seemed just like mist.</p>

<p>"But the most horrifying thing about them was that I could see clean
through them. As they passed I could see the side of the deck and the
quartzite windows and even a star or two in the black void beyond, just
as if they were transparent, made of glass themselves. It was
horrible!</p>

<p>"Well, after that I don't quite know what happened. Either I fainted
right off or the lights went out: I don't know which. All I can say is
that everything seemed to go dark. The next I remember is seeing you
good folk round me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>The Guard Ship</h3>

<p>SHE finished and looked expectantly from one to the other as though
she fancied we would treat her tale with derision. Yet there was
nothing in it to laugh at.</p>

<p>"Can you describe the figures more closely?" I asked, but she shook
her head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't. I saw only the vaguest outlines and they seemed
to flicker."</p>

<p>"As though a faint light were playing on them?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what it looked like," she said quickly. "How do
you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't," I said smiling. "I merely guessed right, it seems."</p>

<p>Truth to tell all the while she had been speaking one idea after
another had been tumbling through my mind. Something about light and
its refractive qualities, something about things being made invisible
through the light beams being bent. I had a book in my luggage on the
<i>>Cosmos</i>--one of the old print books--that dealt with problems of the
kind.</p>

<p>"I'd better take her disks and prints," I said when she had
gone.</p>

<p>The radio operator, who had been with us all the time and whose
business it was to attend to such matters, turned to the little wall
machine. A compact piece of mechanism that recorded every word that had
been uttered and every gesture made in the room since the moment Mrs.
Galon entered. It was so cleverly hidden that I doubt if any outsider
would have suspected its existence.</p>

<p>The operator pushed a button placed in an inconspicuous part of the
machine and a little panel slid back, revealing the cavity from which
he took a roll of still dripping film, and three or four disks. The
spoken word was recorded at the side of the film, of course, but since
it was not always possible to run the film through when one wanted to
consult it, the sound was also recorded on the disks rather after the
style of old gramophone records.</p>

<p>"Be careful of that film," the operator said as he handed it over.
"It's not quite dry yet. Perhaps I'd better dry it out for you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I answered. I could spare five minutes.</p>

<p>I saw Hume shift from one foot to the other, then glance nervously
at watch. It was evident he was getting impatient and wondering how
much longer he was going to be held up. I tried to hurry things as much
as possible.</p>

<p>"Captain Bensen," I said, "you been boarded in mid-space and
subjected to a deal of inconvenience and annoyance. On the other hand
your cargo shown by your indicators is intact and nothing has been
touched here in this cabin. Is that a fair summing up?"</p>

<p>"More or less," Bensen agreed. "Except that you'd better record that
there's nothing to show who our visitors were or even that we had any
at all."</p>

<p>"Only Mrs. Galon's statement," I cut in.</p>

<p>"Barely visible entities!" he said.</p>

<p>"I imagine," I said mildly, "that it would be hard to explain what
has happened in any other way."</p>

<p>"I think," said Bensen with almost my own intonation, "that you will
find it hard to explain matters in that way."</p>

<p>WHAT more he might have said can only guess, for at that moment came
the low whine of the locator, a shutter on the wall of the cabin
dropped and a red bulb glowed to life.</p>

<p>The operator sprang to the television screen, connected the
communicator, and with the receivers to his ears took the call.
"Interplanetary Guard-ship E Twenty-two calling," he said. "Want to
know what the trouble is."</p>

<p>The <i>E. 22!</i>--my own Guard-ship! For the moment no one moved in the
little control room.</p>

<p>"What shall I reply, sir?" the operator asked abruptly.</p>

<p>It was significant that he looked not at me but at his own
captain.</p>

<p>Bensen flashed me a look. "It's for Mr. Sanders to say," he said
dryly.</p>

<p>"If I may," I said, "I'd like to answer that call."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Bensen gruffly. To the operator he added, "Mr.
Sanders will tell you what to reply."</p>

<p>"Do you mind," I said silkily, "if send the message myself?"</p>

<p>HE did not answer but stepped aside with what I thought an ill
grace. There is a certain close communion between these service
operators that leads them to resent the intrusion of an outsider, more
particularly when the latter has the power to ride rough-shod over
them.</p>

<p>The change-over did not occupy more a quarter of a minute,
nevertheless it was long enough for the man on the <i>E.22</i> to show
impatience. Even as I fixed earphones over my head the crackle of his
signalled questions sounded in my ears.</p>

<p>"Don't be impatient," I signalled back as fast as I could work the
button with my finger. Then without giving the <i>E.22's</i> people time to
think up something snappy in return I changed over to the Guard-ship
code. The vision screen beside me was now showing up their control
room, just as ours must have becoming visible to them.</p>

<p>A man was standing near the operator watching the screen that
reflected the interior of our control room. It was Glenn Vance, my
relief. Recognition came to him almost at the moment it came to me.</p>

<p>I gave Vance an outline of the situation, told him why I was here
and waited for the suggestion I hoped he would make. It came without
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Pity to interrupt your holiday," the reply clicked in my ear. "I'll
take over if you wish."</p>

<p>I signalled delighted agreement.</p>

<p>"Coming over at once," he signalled back. "Will clamp on to your
vacant opposite side to the <i>Cosmos</i>." The screen went blank and the
crackle died in my ears. I turned to Bensen. "The <i>E. Twenty-two</i> is
coming over," I told him. "She'll probably escort you to the
atmosphere's edge, if you wish."</p>

<p>Bensen nodded. "Anything that will get us safely and quickly to our
destination sounds good to me now. But you?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to the <i>Cosmos</i> as soon as I've handed over," I
said. "I'm no more anxious for delay than you are. Also I have Captain
Hume's feelings to consider. I've upset his schedule enough as it
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about me," said Hume. "We're all in the hands of
the Guard nowadays."</p>

<p>I scented an undertone of smouldering sarcasm that might yet burst
into flame. I was saved from saying something that might have led to an
exchange of remarks for which we would all be sorry later by the glow
of the warning bulbs advising us the E.22 was connecting and would want
the port opened on signal. It came a second later, a dull buzzing that
filled the room.</p>

<p>Bensen gave the order to open the starboard port. Came first the
clump of feet up the ladder, then the smiling face of Glenn Vance
appeared.</p>

<p>"So it's really you, Jack, in trouble as usual," was his greeting as
he gained level flooring and came towards me.</p>

<p>"The only trouble I'm in is that of delay," I said a little sharply.
I was not in the mood for banter. "The sooner you can take over and let
us be off the better we'll be pleased."</p>

<p>"So?" he said agreeably. "Well, tell me what it's all about and you
can hand over at once."</p>

<p>He had already had my resume over the power beam and it only needed
filling in. He seemed to find the matter vastly interesting and did not
appear altogether surprised. As I learnt presently Harran had sent him
a flash, an all-ships call, setting out the situation in outline.</p>

<p>Thereafter we speeded things up as much as possible, and in a little
less than ten minutes from the time Vance had arrived Hume and I and
our people were making our way back to the <i>Cosmos</i>. As I turned to go
I put my hand in my pocket and drew out the compact little packet of
film and disks.</p>

<p>"You'd better take these," I said to my colleague. "Mrs. Galon's
statement."</p>

<p>"Good. They'll do as a check. Well, good-bye and a good journey. I
wouldn't change with you anyway. I'm in the thick of it here, trying to
unravel this mystery, while you--"</p>

<p>"While I," I said, "am out of it, leading a calm and placid
existence."</p>

<p>"Vegetating for the duration," he laughed. "Well, you'll hear all
about it when you get back to duty--and will probably want to kick
yourself for being out of the climax of the most interesting
investigation in years."</p>

<p>"Probably," I agreed.</p>

<p>We got back to the <i>Cosmos</i>, closed our port, and signalled our
imminent departure to the others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A Martian Girl Seeking Knowledge</h3>

<p>I SLEPT until the steward at the door filled my cabin with the
grotesque wail of the sounder. I came to with a start, dimly realizing
what had happened.</p>

<p>After our adventure in mid-space and our return to the <i>Cosmos</i> I
had tumbled into bed dog-tired. I had locked my door against intrusion,
but had forgotten everything beyond that. Since I had slept beyond the
normal, and not answered the breakfast call and there was no indication
in my message grid beside the door of the time I wished to be called my
steward had not unnaturally concluded that something was wrong.</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed the moment the wailing started and made shift to
open my door. My steward's face showed relief when I appeared.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Sanders," he said, awkwardly apologetic, "but when
you didn't appear for breakfast and there was no message in your grid I
thought..."</p>

<p>"Quite right," I told him. "My fault entirely. I'll be more careful
next time. What's the hour now?"</p>

<p>"Ten A.M. Earth Western time," he told me. "We change to Martian
time at midnight tonight. We're working up to velocity now."</p>

<p>That was news to me, good news in a way, for it showed our trip
would be over sooner than I thought. I might have guessed it for the
vessel quivered slightly to the steady pulse of the rolgar engines. Not
often are they used in free space, save to take off or slow dolwn.
Evidently Hume had decided we had wasted enough time over the
unscheduled stop last night.</p>

<p>The steward lingered. "If you want something to eat now I think I
can manage it," he said hesitantly.</p>

<p>Looking out for an extra tip no doubt, the rascal. Well, it didn't
matter much. He'd looked after me well to date and I could do with
something to eat and drink.</p>

<p>I made ready while he was away. A certain giddiness that I did not
like attacked me from time to time as I moved about. It was nothing
much when all was said and done. Nevertheless it worried me. In some
ways it was akin to space vertigo, an affliction I dread, for it would
mean the end of my career in the Service. In all my eleven years in the
Interplanetary Guard-ships I had not been troubled by it and so
concluded I was immune.</p>

<p>The trouble passed away, however, by the time my tray arrived.
Probably it was no more than momentary weakness engendered by the
exertion and the tenseness of the night. The fact that it left me
completely, once I had made my meal, seemed to satisfy me on that
point.</p>

<p>A knock came on the door just as I was putting the finishing touches
to my toilet before venturing out. I called, "Come in."</p>

<p>It was another steward, a man whose face I had not seen before. He
had a message from Hume. The skipper was inquiring after me. If I was
up he would like a word with me.</p>

<p>"I'll see him," I said. "Where is he? In the control room?"</p>

<p>In bed, the steward told me. That was rather a surprise. It set me
wondering, wondering if there were any connect between my recent
giddiness and Hume's indisposition.</p>

<p>Hume was sitting propped up in bed when I entered. He looked a
little grey. He did not speak until I had closed the door and we were
alone.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you about, Jack," he said then. "I was beginning to
wonder."</p>

<p>"Wonder what?" I asked. "What's wrong with you, anyway?"</p>

<p>HE made a wry face. "I thought it was space vertigo when it came
on," he said. "I was up before the breakfast call, not much sleep
naturally, seeing what we were at during the night. But when I tried to
move about, the cabin started spinning round me."</p>

<p>"That's bad. And then?"</p>

<p>"I won't bore you with my symptoms. I got a scare, however, began to
imagine space vertigo was seizing me, saw my career snapping off short
and all helped to make me worse, I suppose. However, the long and short
of it is that Dr. Spence came down, tested my reflexes, and decided it
wasn't space vertigo after all."</p>

<p>"I had a somewhat similiar experience this morning myself." I gave
him details. "What do you make of that?"</p>

<p>"What Dr. Spence thinks is that we got out of our emergency suits
too soon last night There must have been something in the air of M.E.
Seventy-five, something other than the cold, an ingredient with a
slightly anesthetizing property. We're feeling the after-kick of it
now."</p>

<p>"What's Spence ordered you to do?"</p>

<p>"Stay in till I'm better," Hume smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling that way already and--if you don't mind--we'll have the
complete cure in a moment or two."</p>

<p>"Oxcta," he went on. "You'll find the box in that drawer. The lock's
a simple switch one. The white button breaks the circuit, the red one
opens it."</p>

<p>I did as he told me, drew out the little box I had seen my first
evening on board and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Now the water," Hume said.</p>

<p>When I handed him the glass, "I'm glad you were able to come," he
said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't risk getting out for things myself and I've no mind to
let others into my secrets."</p>

<p>"I needed that," he said as he swalloweded the last of the draught.
Then he eyed me. "I've been thinking of myself solely. You need a taste
of it too. Draw yourself a glass."</p>

<p>I did and felt immeasurably the better for it. I said so. He did not
answer, merely nodded and still eyed me, a trifle more thoughtfully
now.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, "I've been thinking. Last night put a fancy or two
into my head. Yours isn't altogether a pleasant job though no doubt it
has its romantic side. Still you may get into tighter corners than I'm
ever likely to. Corners of the sort we were both in last night.</p>

<p>"A few of these on hand"--he held out a dozen of the Oxcta pellets
to me--"might be valuable. Only I must ask you never to say that you
have them in your possession, never indeed acknowledge that you know of
their existence."</p>

<p>"In that case," I said, not taking the pellets, "perhaps you
shouldn't offer them."</p>

<p>"A time may come when you'll be glad I did. You've seen their effect
on me. You've felt it twice on yourself. Here, take them. Call it
humoring me if you like."</p>

<p>"All right, since you're so pressing."</p>

<p>"Keep them in a metal box, steel for preference. You've got one you
can use? No? Well, you'll find an empty one in the same drawer. It's
Earth-made so there's nothing to connect it up with them."</p>

<p>I found the box, and transferred to it the dozen pellets he had
given me. A lot of fuss to make about them. After all, if his
assurances were to be believed, as I felt they were, they were no more
than a remarkable tonic whose constituents were kept a close secret by
the Martian manufacturers. The box slid into my pocket.</p>

<p>"As far as we are concerned," said Hume a trifle anxiously, "I take
it last night's affair is over and done with."</p>

<p>We still kept to the old Earth style of dividing the day into
periods of darkness and light though here there was neither. We saw
only the blackness of space with the stars and the planets doubly
bright, doubly brilliant with the absence of air.</p>

<p>"The Guard-ship's taken over," I pointed out. "That should end it as
far as this voyage goes. But there may be enquiries at Tlanan when we
reach there. It depends on what the Martian authorities think."</p>

<p>"At any rate we won't have our schedule upset," Hume remarked.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so. In a day or so we'll pass the beat of the
last of the Earth Guard-ships, and the Martian ones, I'd imagine, would
be more interested in speeding us towards Tlanan for an inquiry than in
hanging us up in mid-space."</p>

<p>"I hope so." He did not seem so sure of that. Perhaps he knew the
Martians better than I.</p>

<p>A MOMENT'S silence, then, "Well, Jack, if you don't mind clearing
out I'd like to get up," he said. "I'm feeling fit to face things
again, now that I know it isn't space vertigo coming on. Also the Oxcta
has made a new man of me. By the way, use the stuff sparingly. It will
lose its effect if you take it too often."</p>

<p>"Never fear. I don't like forming habits, good, bad or indifferent,"
I told him. With that and a nod I left him.</p>

<p>There were many things to think about. Free though I was of the
necessity of probing further the particular mystery of the <i>M.E. 75</i> I
was still interested deeply. Here was a mystery doubly intriguing. It
seemed to defy solution, yet ever and again I had a queer feeling that
I was very close to a revelation.</p>

<p>It was not unlikely that contact with my fellow beings might not
only clear my befogged brain but perhaps set it working along new
lines. For some reason or other there were few about at that hour. My
chair had already been marked out for me though so far I had made no
use of it. Now I found it without difficulty, dropped into it and began
to fill my pipe. That alone of Earth's vices was left me for
comfort.</p>

<p>I felt drowsy. I must have dozed, for the next I remember was a
voice musical in my ear. I opened my eyes with a start. Jansca Dirka
was standing beside me, smiling. I jerked upright in my chair and began
some remark about ing dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said in a voice held just the faintest trace of
h-er accent. "I wouldn't have disturbed had I known."</p>

<p>I drew up a vacant chair beside "Sit here," I invited her. I did not
believe her statement that she did know I was dozing. Patently she
wanted to talk with me.</p>

<p>She seated herself and half-turned towards me. "You do not mind?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I said, amused. "I can see you want to ask questions.
What is it now?"</p>

<p>Her eyebrows lifted archly. "Nothing of any importance. I am merely
a Martian girl seeking knowledge."</p>

<p>"In that case I'll be happy to tell anything I can."</p>

<p>"I have been reading," she wen gently, "delving into the ship's
library of your Earth books. Somehow I prefer them to the
book-machines. They not noisy. One can read them and at the same time
maintain privacy without the need of sound insulators."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like them," I said simply. "I, too, have a leaning to
old print. In many ways I like the old ideas. The book-machines seen
lack something. Yet we took them fronm you."</p>

<p>She frowned. "From Mars," she said thoughtfully, using the Earth
title for her planet. "Well, not all that comes from us is good." She
stopped abruptyly, thinking perhaps of that disastrous War of the
Planets that came near wrecking the civilizations of the Inner
Planets.</p>

<p>Abruptly she pulled herself back to the conversation. "I found
amongst those books an old one by an man named Wells--'The War of the
Worlds,'" she said slowly. "I thought at first it was an actual
history, then discovered as I read that it you call..." She
hesitated, looking to me to supply the elusive word.</p>

<p>"A romance?" said I.</p>

<p>"An imaginative romance," she qualified. "I read on and on. Tell me,
was Earth really like that? Did men at one time drive animals
about?"</p>

<p>"As a picture of those times I fancy it is pretty accurate," I said.
"That is, course, if you leave out the invasion part of it."</p>

<p>SHE shuddered. "To think that Earthmen once imagined we might assume
those shapes--the things that came in the cylinders. Octopus shapes.
Loathsome things." Then quickly before I could comment, she ran on.
"Yet it was you Earth-people who first voyaged to the distant
planets."</p>

<p>"I've often wondered about that," I said. "Time and time again it
has puzzled me why neither your people nor the Venusians branched out
in that way."</p>

<p>"There were many reasons," she told me. "You are a predatory folk,
an exploring, restless race. Also you had certain things we lacked. We
could fly but we had not that urge to reach out for stars that is your
heritage."</p>

<p>In this she was not quite accurate. Interplanetary travel would
never have become the accomplished fact it is today had it not been for
the discovery of rolgar. True, we found it on the Moon, in our own
territory so to speak, though we did not immediately realize its
significance.</p>

<p>Even with the improvements Leyton Browne introduced in 1975, which
enabled our space explorers to extend the radius of their travels,
interplanetary voyages could not have become a commercial proposition.
It was only when we made contact with the Venusians and learnt from
them the true value of rolgar that we began to make any progress at
all.</p>

<p>It is odd to recall that to the Venusians rolgar was practically a
theoretical substance, one as rare, if not rarer, to them than radium
is on Earth. The Earth, ignorant of its value and its almost
incalculable powers, possessed on our Moon a practically unlimited
supply. Sad to think that it was over rolgar that the first and we hope
the last of the dreadful interplanetary wars was fought...</p>

<p>"Do you think then"--I switched back to the immediate subject--"that
there would never have been communication between us had it not been
for Earth-folk?"</p>

<p>"Do you?" she said and for the moment I failed to realize that the
question was merely rhetorical. "Do you ever pause to think, Mr.
Sanders, whether somewhere in the Universe there may not be others,
intelligent beings, like us in form, immeasurably our superiors in
intellect, who may even now be reaching out to contact with us? One
hears strange stories."</p>

<p>I stared at her. What she was saying ran so close to the ideas in my
own mind, paralleled so nearly my own recent experiences that I asked
myself if she weren't throwing out feelers. A Martian girl seeking
knowledge...</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> it!" I said. I might have phrased it otherwise, have
said, "You've guessed!" But I used instinctively the one word that
accurately summed up the situation. She knew.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, this Martian maiden seeking knowledge, and her
hand dropped comfortingly on mine. "Indeed I am more aware of you than
perhaps you think. You see, you have interested me--us. My father and
I."</p>

<p>She did not take her hand away. A moment later I had prisoned it in
mine. "You know," I said challengingly. "But how much do you know?"</p>

<p>"Enough to startle you," she told me. "That you are no private
tourist, that you hold a high position in Earth's Guard-ship
Fleet."</p>

<p>"I am not unknown. It is quite possible that many travellers on the
space-liners should have seen me in an official capacity, and have
remembered."</p>

<p>"That is so," she agreed. "But do not worry. If you wish to preserve
your secret it is safe with us. But as you say that is a little thing,
no sure test of the knowledge I boasted I possessed."</p>

<p>She leaned a little closer to me, so close that I could have taken
her in my arms without effort had I wished. "Suppose"--her voice
dropped to a whisper---"suppose I were to tell you what else I know, of
the things that have worried you and threatened to upset your holiday,
of the events of last night, of the ship adrift in space, and the
sleeping, half-frozen men you found there."</p>

<p>"There must have been a leak somewhere," I said. "Someone has
talked."</p>

<p>"You could explain it so," she agreed. "But what you could not
explain by that or any other form of reason is this, a thing known only
to you and Captain Hume that in this pocket"--she tapped it
lightly--"you have a little steel box containing twelve pellets of
Martian Oxcta."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A Friend, or Perhaps a Little More</h3>

<p>I STARED at her stupefied--while the unrecoverable seconds ticked
remorselessly away. I scarcely knew what to say or with what counter to
meet this frank revelation. The fact that she knew something and no
doubt guessed more of the mystery in which I had played my little part
did not matter so much. It was the uncanny knowledge she displayed of
something trifling in itself, yet about which no one but myself and the
captain should know anything, that was so disconcerting.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I demanded, still in the same soft whisper she herself
had used. "Tell me how you know all this. It's..." In my turn I
halted for a word and this time it was she who supplied the needed
one.</p>

<p>"Uncanny," she suggested and when I nodded, "No, Mr. Sanders, it
isn't. It's anything but that. To show you what I mean I'll tell you
something more. Wait a moment, please."</p>

<p>She thrust her hand through the V opening at the bosom of her dress,
kept her hand there under the shadow of the material almost as though
she held something in her palm, something at which she looked and
frowned a little, with a drawing together of those fine eyebrows of
hers.</p>

<p>"Face me squarely," she commanded. "Ah, that's it. Now--under the
left lapel of your coat, where you can show it in a moment if
necessary, is your interplanetary badge, a silver badge in the shape of
a space-ship with the letters--I. P. G. spread along its length."</p>

<p>"Go on," I said with interest. So much she could have told me from
memory if she had ever--as no doubt she had--seen a Guard's badge
before.</p>

<p>"You're still a little doubtful," she whispered. "We-ell--on the
back of the Badge is a number--seven-twenty-five. Beneath the number
are the two letters S. C."</p>

<p>She could not have known without having seen my badge--which I swear
ahe had never done--could not possibly have known that I was number 725
of the Interplanetary Guard and that my rank was Space Captain.</p>

<p>She went on calmly, "In your right-hand coat pocket you have an
envelope, buff in color. It contains a space radio form. The message on
the form is written in an Earth-language I do not know. It is not one
in use, that is all I can say. But I can spell out the words to you."
She spelled it through until I thought it time to call a halt.</p>

<p>"Please!" I said almost breathlessly. "I'm convinced."</p>

<p>She looked up mischievously at me. Her hand came out of the bosom of
her dress, empty, as it had gone in. Yet I could swear that the moment
she raised her eyes to meet mine I heard a slight click as of a spring
being released.</p>

<p>"And of what are you convinced?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Of the reality of what you're saying--or doing," I told her. "But
it's magic, witchcraft."</p>

<p>"No. Applied science, that's all. A little toy it is, yet how it
shakes you, saps your confidence and makes you talk of magic, of
witchcraft, of things no sane planetarian really believes in."</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said quickly, "why do you do this thing? I am sure it
is not merely to puzzle me."</p>

<p>"It is," she said, "because I want to help you, if only in my small
way."</p>

<p>"With that little toy? What is it? May I see it?"</p>

<p>She took my questions in order. "Yes, with that little toy, as you
call it. It is worked on the principle of your X-rays, something
analogous, at any rate. But I cannot show it to you here. There may be
prying eyes about."</p>

<p>She flung a swift glance about the deck. No one seemed in the least
interested in our talk but then that was othing to go by. Men--women
too--can watch and listen without showing the slightest outward sign of
interest. "Mr. Sanders, you are Earth-born. You have conventions that
are not ours. We have conventions that possibly you do not understand.
Would you therefore think it a thing that should not have been said if
I were to ask you to come down to the seclusion of my cabin where we
can talk undisturbed?"</p>

<p>MY hesitation was but for the moment. "No, of course not," I said
readily.</p>

<p>"Leave me now," she said. "My cabin is C-eight. In ten minutes you
will find me there. We had better not go together."</p>

<p>There was wisdom in her suggestion. With a brightly-flung word and a
cheery nod for the benefit of anyone who might chance to be watching, I
rose to my feet, sauntered off along the deck, stopped to relight my
pipe, strolled through the saloon.</p>

<p>So casually I made my way to the accommodation deck, and presently
located C-eight. The glow of a light tube streaming through the grille
over the door told me it was in occupancy. I glanced at the name grid.
Jansca Dirka, that was all. She then had the whole cabin to
herself.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind me, snapped the switch and shut the sound
insulators. Then she turned to me with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why," I said, "are you doing all this?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, "I would be your friend."</p>

<p>"A friend or perhaps a little more," I said softly, overwhelmed by
that other-world intoxication of her presence, that lure that was not
Earth's. I had her hands in mine as I spoke. She said nothing but I
felt them drawn softly away.</p>

<p>"We can," she said with meaning, "speak of such matters after. There
are more important things to talk of now."</p>

<p>She turned swiftly away from me for a moment. What she did or where
it came from I could not say, but when she faced me the next second in
the palm of her outstretched hand there lay glittering a watchlike
thing with a tiny thread-thin chain attached.</p>

<p>"Take it," she said. "It is yours. It will help you."</p>

<p>It was shaped like a watch, save that back and front were made of
some vitreous substance, neither glass nor quartzite. As I looked into
one crystal face I could see nothing till the girl leaned over, touched
a spring I had not noticed. I nearly let it drop, for the floor of the
cabin under the crystal face seemed to vanish and I found myself
looking into the deck below, seeing everything beneath me as clearly as
though the floor were made of glass.</p>

<p>"It is rather startling when one sees it for the first time," she
said, "but as I've told you the principle underlying it is quite
simple. It is merely a matter of penetrative rays."</p>

<p>"It is rather astounding," I said as soon as I recovered my
composure. "You don't know then how the principle is applied?"</p>

<p>Slowly, seriously she shook her head. "I do not know," she said
deliberately, "and if I did I would not tell. I am giving you this
little instrument because I know it will help you but not even for you
would I betray the secrets of my people."</p>

<p>I turned on her, suddenly contrite. "Of course!" I said. "You are
doing a wonderful thing even in giving me this. I should not have asked
you any such question."</p>

<p>She waved that aside, came a little closer and as though afraid that
evenin that soundproof cabin she might be overheard dropped her voice
to the merest thread of a whisper.</p>

<p>"Keep it there," she said, pointing. "On the inside of your buttoned
jacket. Make a pocket for it there to keep it hidden out of sight. You
have only to put your hand down--you need never pull it out more than
is necessary--to see the dial face on one side or the other."</p>

<p>"Your father?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"He does not know," she said quickly. "I do not want him to know. He
is well-disposed towards you, as who would not be? But even he, if he
knew that I was even to this extent betraying a Martian secret to one
not of our race by blood or by adoption, would be harsh with me."</p>

<p>Her voice trailed into silence.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said quickly, "if this were known--what would happen to
you? Anything dire?"</p>

<p>She did not answer but the droop of her head told me all I wished to
know. This Martian maiden, in so many ways like an Earth girl, in so
many other ways unlike, was for me taking the stars knew what
risks.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I begged. "Is it merely tha I am an alien, because I have
no Sonjho blood in me that you would be punished?" In my eagerness,
anxiety, call I what you will, I had stumbled into using the Martian
word itself.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly, thoughtfully "yes, it is because you have no
Sonjho blood in you that I must fear for myself."</p>

<p>For a space she paused. I saw the glitter of the little knife in her
hand and sprang forward but she thrust me back with one hand, and for
once I was not minded to use force.</p>

<p>"Stay," she said fiercely. "I mean harm to you or anyone else. But I
see a way."</p>

<p>Something in her eyes compelled me to wait. She took the little
knife, made a tiny scratch in the fleshy part of her left arm, waited
until the red blood came.</p>

<p>Suddenly she thrust the arm towar me, and spoke commandingly. "See,"
she said, "I have drawn blood. With your lips remove it."</p>

<p>She came of a long line of those born to rule, this girl. There was
something of their concentrated magnetism in her, something too that
was all her own. Scarcely knowing what I did, I obeyed her. My lips
touched her warm flesh.</p>

<p>SHE drew her arm away and as I straightened, looked at me with a new
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are one of us," she said with a strange dignity and a stranger
softness in her manner. "Now you can always say with truth that you are
of the Sonjhon blood for you have that blood, my blood in you."</p>

<p>It was no barbaric rite, no ancient survival of blood brotherhood
such as once existed amongst certain peoples on Earth. It was her way,
the only way she knew, of giving me power to claim if necessary the
rights by blood of a citizen of Mars.</p>

<p>The deed, as much as the thought behind it, amazed me. I knew enough
of her planet's customs to realize that it would hold as binding in any
Martian community but whether it had any deeper implication I could not
say.</p>

<p>Our eyes met. She stepped back a pace, drew a long breath, and slid
the tiny knife into a sheath at her girdle.</p>

<p>"I had better explain," she said in studied calm tones, "the working
of the--" She used a word I did not catch, a Martian phrase new to me.
She smiled at my puzzled expression. "That little instrument I gave
you," she explained.</p>

<p>I took the thing from my pocket--for lack of a better name I called
it in my own mind "The Crystal Eye" and as such it will be referred to
hereafter--and handed it to her. She showed me that the spring at the
top was in reality a sort of screw. It could be adjusted to suit the
distance in much the same way that one adjusts binoculars.</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing before I go," I said, for it was a thought that
worried me. "Do all Martians carry these?"</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly, "no. Only those of--only a favored few carry
them."</p>

<p>I read in her eyes the meaning of that hesitation, could almost hear
the word she had left unsaid. I knew without a doubt that she had meant
to say "Only those of the blood," and had pulled herself up just in
time. Well, it seemed--if suppressions and hesitations went for
anything--that now it was a matter not to be referred to between us
again.</p>

<p>Blindly I made a step forward, fumbled, caught her in my arms, I
kissed the lips that for the moment feigned resistance, then clung
passionately to mine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>I Take Over</h3>

<p>THROUGHOUT most of that day the ether must have been super-heated
with the messages between worlds. In the administrative centers of the
three confederated planets men must have been working feverishly,
preparing to deal with a menace whose actual purpose, whose identity
even, had not yet become manifest.</p>

<p>To us sealed up in our space-ship hurtling through the void to our
destination nothing of this was known. It was not until the dinner hour
that night that the first repercussions of the trouble became
apparent.</p>

<p>Supremely happy in my new-found love I had taken my seat at the
table to meet the ardent glance from Jansca's glowing eyes and the
approving look from her father, whom I had already seen and talked
with. I noticed as a thing of little moment that Hume's place was
unoccupied.</p>

<p>Jansca leaned across the table and said something to me. I was about
to make some light answer to Jansca's remark, when a finger touched me
on the shoulder and I heard my name spoken. It was one of the
officers.</p>

<p>"Captain Hume would like to see you at once, Mr. Sanders," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, well." I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'llhave to go."</p>

<p>I faced Jansca and she leaned across to catch my words. "My dear," I
said, "I'm afraid I'm wanted. Apparently urgently."</p>

<p>"Go," she said swiftly. "Don't wait. I think I understand." Her
hand, reaching across the table, caught mine and gave it a gentle
pressure.</p>

<p>I met her eyes. There was something in them that startled me. Agony,
fear, anxiety--all somehow mixed together. Then I rose to my feet and
swung off behind the man who had summoned me.</p>

<p>Hume sat before a desk littered with papers. He raised a grave face
as I was ushered in. "Sit down there, Jack," was his greeting. Then to
the officer who had conducted me, "Insulate us against all outside
interference."</p>

<p>"Man, what is it?" I cried.</p>

<p>His brow furrowed into lines. "Jack," he said earnestly, "I'd give a
lot to be able to answer that question. But perhaps this may tell you
something."</p>

<p>He pushed a message form to me. It was written in plain English and
it had been sent out from New York headquarters of the Earth division
of the Interplanetary Board of Control not two hours before.</p>

<p>I stared at it, for it began with the triple call of urgency, that
call we seldom get more than once in a generation. The gist of it can
be given in a sentence. It was a general call to all space-ships to
rendezvous at the nearest Guard-ship base as quickly as possible and
wait for escort before proceeding to their destinations.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" I asked.</p>

<p>For answer he passed me another wad of sheets. The top one was a
similar message, sent from London. It was timed a few minutes later. I
turned to the others. One was from Shangun, the Venusian capital, in
that planet's international language. The third message also
indecipherable, was, I guessed from the office of dispatch in
Tlananian, the language of two-thirds of the Martian peoples.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about the urgency of the matter," I said slowly.
"The fact that the Venusian and Martian messages have been broadcast in
their own tongue shows that to my mind. They couldn't afford to waste
the time to translate them into international code."</p>

<p>"Or meant them solely for their own ships, knowing Earth messages
would reach liners like us," Hume said with a puckering of the
forehead. "But what's behind it all?"</p>

<p>"The space-visitors--the things--people--that were responsible for
the trouble on M.E. Seventy-five. Perhaps I'm wrong. I hope I am--it
looks as though something has happened, some new development that
menaces the safety of every space liner from the three planets enroute
at the moment. Such a thing has never been heard of since
space-travelling became an accomplished fact."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do? Is this the crisis your instructions
cover?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say. Looks to me like a matter for individual
judgment. But at present, providing there are no further developments,
I can make no move in any direction. You have already got your orders.
I think in the circumstances you will be wise to abide by them."</p>

<p>"I've changed course already." He pointed to the dial-chart, where
the quivering pointer showed us edging off at an angle from the red
line that had hitherto marked our route to intercept the orbit of Mars.
"Also, our locators are sounding space to pick up the nearest
Guard-ship. It will probably be a Martian one now, we're so far
advanced on our way."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is does not matter as long as it is a Guard-ship," I
said wearily. A heaviness had come over me, a weight on my heart.</p>

<p>HUME shot a glance at me from under his tired drooping lids. "Sick
of it, already," he said. "Ah, well, you've no responsibilities,
no--"</p>

<p>"You're wrong," I cut in before he could go further. "I have
responsibilities, one big one at least aboard this ship."</p>

<p>"Aboard the <i>Cosmos</i>!" he exclaimed. "What...who is it?"</p>

<p>"Jansca," I said. "Jansca Dirka."</p>

<p>"You mean that, Jack? Is it fact or merely a hope?"</p>

<p>"A fact accomplished. We agreed only this morning that our paths lay
together. Her father knows and has approved."</p>

<p>For one long second he looked at me, then across the table his hand
reached out and gripped mine heartily.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said at last. "Of course our safety means more to
you perhaps even than it does to me." Then, almost under his breath.
"But a <i>Dirka</i>!"</p>

<p>I caught the word. "Why a Dirka?" I demanded. "What is strange in
that?"</p>

<p>"Your luck. Call it that. The Dirkas are the nearest to a race of
kings Mars has had in a thousand years. But, Jack, coming back to
immediate urgencies, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Follow instructions. We can't make any other preparations, for we
don't know what we may have to face."</p>

<p>"Our armament--" he suggested tentatively.</p>

<p>"What have you in that way?"</p>

<p>"The two rays--heat and the repeller rays. The former won't function
too well free space, I should imagine."</p>

<p>"Why not? It doesn't need an atmosphere. It will go where light
goes. We'll--rather I hope we won't have the need to see. We--"</p>

<p>There came a warning crackle, thrice repeated, from the sounder at
his elbow.</p>

<p>"More messages," he said wearily. "Manners, take them."</p>

<p>My conductor made the sundry adjustments that allowed the door to be
opened. It was a messenger from the transmitting room--the <i>Cosmos</i> was
big enough to have a separate one of her own--with a sealed envelope in
his hand. "For Mr. Sanders," he said. "I was told he was here."</p>

<p>Manners passed it to me, the messenger sped away and the insulating
barrage went up again. As I thought, it was from Harran.</p>

<p><i>Have reason to suppose that concerted attack is to be made on all
spaceships. Possible invasion of three planets projected. Confirm
general rendezvous order. All Guards are to hold in readiness for
immediate duty. All emergency regulations to be put into operation
forthwith. No private messages to be transmitted from space-ships or if
received aboard to be delivered to addressees, except under direction
and at discretion of Guard until further orders. Emergency regulations
in force from moment of receipt of this message. (Signed)
Harran--Tellus, Tambard--Mars, Clinigo--Venus.</i></p>

<p>I thrust the translation over to Hume. "You had better read this," I
said.</p>

<p>Slowly he read it through and as he read his face blanched. At the
end he handed it back to me. "It means," he said, "that you are now in
command."</p>

<p>"It means that," I agreed. "But it means more--that you and I and
all the rest of us must work together for the safety of our ship and
passengers."</p>

<p>"Yet," he said heavily, "there is so little we can do."</p>

<p>I nodded. "Arm your men," I said. "Serve out your ray tubes at once.
Are all your officers trustworthy?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them."</p>

<p>"I want them paraded at once--here. Would you care to advise them or
shall I?"</p>

<p>"Better you, Jack. I won't cavil at what you say or do in a time
like this. About the operators. Had they better come too?"</p>

<p>"Yes--all except the men on duty."</p>

<p>He called Manners and gave his orders and soon the emergency signals
were sounding in each man's quarters.</p>

<p>ONE by one they came to the room--the three officers--the
apprentices who were actually junior officers in training--the purser,
Parey--the doctor and others. All told there was a round dozen of
them.</p>

<p>Hume wasted no time in preliminaries. "You've been called here," he
said, "because of certain matters of importance with which you should
be acquainted at the earliest opportunity. What they are Mr. Sanders
will explain."</p>

<p>I saw curious eyes turn wonderingly towards me. Even Parey, who knew
who I was, knitted his brows. I pinned my Guard's badge in the lapel of
my coat where it was plain for all to see. Even then I could see most
of them were still frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>I gave a brief sketch of the condition in which we had found M.E.
Seventy-five--there was no need to enlarge on that as it was already
more or less common property amongst the after-guard--and added that
similar things had happened to other space-ships.</p>

<p>I insisted that as yet we did not know anything about the motive
behind these visitations--one could hardly call them attacks--and
certainly had no idea from which planet the vandals had come. Then to
round everything off I read out the message signed by The Three. I
finished, and glanced round the little company.</p>

<p>"Any questions?" I asked. "We may not have the opportunity to ask or
answer them later."</p>

<p>Parey caught my eye. "Does this mean, Mr. Sanders," he said, "that
you are in absolute command here?"</p>

<p>"It means," I said deliberately, "that I am responsible to the
Interplanetary Board of Control for the safety of this ship and her
complement. If anything goes wrong it is I who will be to blame. But
let us have no talk of absolute or any other kind of command."</p>

<p>"Captain Hume and I have discussed the matter thoroughly between us
and are agreed, as I want you all to be agreed, that unless each man
does his utmost we may fail to pull through. It may hearten you to
realize that in a thousand ships all up and down the void this message
is being repeated and similar scenes enacted."</p>

<p>The first officer, Gond, took a step forward. "I think I can speak
for the others. What you say goes with us, the more so as Captain Hume
is backing you up. That's a mouthful, I think."</p>

<p>I smiled at the quaint archaisms in his little speech but I could
not smile at his sincerity. It was too affecting for that. A murmur
that rose from the little group showed how well he had expressed the
sentiments of all of them.</p>

<p>"That's that then," I said. "Captain Hume, will you take over,
please?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>The Inexplicable Incident</h3>

<p>MY further duties took me half an hour or so. Then I was free to go
about my own small concerns.</p>

<p>Dinner had long since been ended and the saloon was bare and empty.
Knowing the long hours the kitchen staff put in, I did not feel like
giving them extra trouble in serving me a late meal.</p>

<p>I slipped down to my cabin, drew a glass of water from the faucet
and dropped an Oxcta pellet in it. I drank the resultant mixture and
felt all the better for it. But, I warned myself, it would not do to
make a regular practice of this. Despite what Hume had told me--that it
was not habit-forming--I had no wish to put the matter to the test.</p>

<p>It was too early to go to bed yet. I wanted time to think things out
and if possible formulate some plan of campaign. Since I can always
think better with a pipe in my mouth I filled and lit one.</p>

<p>The result of half-an-hour's intensive thought was zero. When all
was said an done the initiative did not lie with us but with those
invaders out of space an until we learnt a little more about them and
their objects I could see no use in speculating.</p>

<p>Was it possible, to borrow a phrase from one writer who one hundred
and fifty years ago forecast something of the sort, that we were being
examined in much the same impersonal fashion as man will examine
infusoria under a microscope?</p>

<p>A soft yet penetrating rap sound on my cabin door and brought me out
my reverie. Jansca was standing there, mild perplexity and alarm in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack," she said almost breathlessly. "I've been looking for you
and wondering. Then I saw your light and knocked."</p>

<p>"Come in," I said. "Come in, dear. I've been here some time."</p>

<p>I shut the door and threw the insulaswitch. I was getting jumpy,
taking precauutions that a week before I would laughed at.</p>

<p>"When you left the table and did not returnrn I feared something was
wrong," she said, looking up earnestly into my face.</p>

<p>"Nothing was wrong with me."</p>

<p>"No?" Her fair brow wrinkled. "But there have been comings and
goings, an amount of activity amongst the officers that made me
think--" She stopped abruptly and looked to me to supply the end of
that truncated thought.</p>

<p>"Made you think what, Jansca?" I said encouragingly.</p>

<p>Shee put her two hands on my shoulders and looked me straight in the
eyes. "Dear," she said, "tell me what is wrong, if not with you, at
least with things in which you are implicated."</p>

<p>"Jansca," I said gravely, "sit down." She obeyed but flung me one
quick glance of interest as though already she glimpsed something of
what I had to tell her.</p>

<p>"Thiss," I said, "is between ourselves. It must go no further than
you, not even to your father. Will you promise me that?"</p>

<p>Her face glowed. "Where you and I concerned, Jack, there is no need
ofpromises, given or taken."</p>

<p>That was good hearing, and I said so. "But, Jansca, what I wish to
impress on you is that I am revealing to you secret matter, messages
that have passed and will be passing between myself and the Council of
Three."</p>

<p>Briefly I told her, omitting nothing, stressing nothing. She did not
look as grave at the end as I had expected.</p>

<p>"It follows on what we already knew," she said simply. "It may mean
trouble for our worlds or it may be something that can be dealt with
very easily once we understand the reason behind it. But, dear one,
does this mean that when we reach Tlanan, if we do in safety, you and I
will be separated for a time?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," I said with truth. "If things were left to me I would
marry you out of hand and make the rest of my space-voyage a
honeymoon."</p>

<p>"A honeymoon?" For the moment she seemed puzzled, then the meaning
of it dawned on her. "Of course," she said brightly, "that is your
Earth-term for the period of adjustment. It is a sweet phrase.
Sometimes I wish we Martians were a little less practical in
sentimental matters and a little more sentimental in practical affairs.
Strange that we should so reverse things."</p>

<p>"We can all teach each other something," I told her. "We all have
much to learn. Perhaps, by mixing as we do, we planetarians may yet
evolve a race as noble as it is good."</p>

<p>She smiled at that. "Too much to hope for, prophet mine. Men and
women are much the same the planets over."</p>

<p>"Well, we needn't worry about it, as long as we're happy in
ourselves," I remarked. My thoughts leaped off at a tangent. "Jansca,
beyond that little knife you carry in your girdle have you any weapon
of defense?"</p>

<p>"Do I need one?" she queried.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said frankly, "but it's just as well to be
prepared. Can you use a ray tube?"</p>

<p>"I can use anything," she said, "once you have shown me how."</p>

<p>WITHOUT more words I took down the case containing the charges and
the duplicate tube. She had seen such before--the ship's guards carried
them on every space-boat--but she had never held one in her hands and
had no idea of its mechanism. But within a very few minutes she had
acquired as complete a command over the weapon as though she had been
handling it for years.</p>

<p>I loaded the tube, gave her an extra clip or two of the charges,
advised her to conceal it in her dress somewhere.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, as she slid it out of sight, "my mind's at rest. At
the worst you have the means at hand to defend yourself if
necessary."</p>

<p>"I wonder if it will ever be necessary," she said softly. "I hope
not. Are you coming up on deck for awhile, Jack? It wants an hour or
two yet of retiring time. We can sit and talk and perhaps find pleasure
in each other's company, if not forgetfulness of what hangs over
us."</p>

<p>"Jansca, my dear," I said chuckling, "you seem to be taking rather a
pessimistic view of the situation."</p>

<p>"And you," she countered, "who should be that way inclined are
almost cheerful. Missing a meal seems to do you good." As though her
own words had brought back recollection she dropped her bantering tone.
"Oh, you must be starving and here I have been keeping you from getting
anything to eat."</p>

<p>"I don't need food," I told her and pointed to the empty glass
standing on the ledge beneath the faucet.</p>

<p>For a moment she looked puzzled, took up the glass--some of the
dregs were still in it--and held it close to her nose.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I understand." Then came a little pause, just the
merest hesitation. Then, "Jack, it is years since I last tasted Oxcta.
Do you think tonight seeing this is a special occasion, that a little,
one sip even would be allowe me?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I said without thinking.</p>

<p>Five minutes later we made our way up deck. Heads turned and eyes
followed us for I think the news of our impending mating had somehow
got about on board, and interested people in us.</p>

<p>I do not know what Jansca and I talked about. We chatted idly as
lovers will. We deliberately avoided all talk of the future that was
likely to impinge on that dubious thing that menaced the Universe if we
were to believe the warning of the Council.</p>

<p>A man came mincing down the deck, one seemingly wrapped in his own
thoughts. It was the carefully selected steps that made me think it was
Nomo Kell, though for the moment I did recognize the man. He wore some
quaint kind of headgear, rather like a cap with a visor and earflaps,
that I do not member having seen before. Though the ship's heaters kept
the temperature normal he was muffled to the chin in a coat of light
shiny material.</p>

<p>"Nomo Kell must be feeling cold," I remarked to Jansca. "See how he
is wrapped up."</p>

<p>She did not answer in words, but her hand--we were very close
together tightened warningly on mine. Of course it was no more than
coincidence that he should glance up at that exact moment and shoot a
deliberately searching look toward us. Yet Jansca's warning grip coming
at the same instant, sent a stir of uneasiness through me. I waited til
he was out of sight.</p>

<p>"Jansca," I said, "do you think he could have heard me?"</p>

<p>She gave the tiniest shrug to shoulders. "Who knows?" she said
absently. "At least I thought it wise to stop you before you said
more."</p>

<p>I objected, "there is no way he could have heard."</p>

<p>"Audiophones," she reminded me. "That cap he wore could easily have
concealed-a pair."</p>

<p>I did not quite agree with her. The audiphones, after all, were
attuned to special receivers. I was on the point of explaining this
when of a sudden it struck me that the heater must have developed a
defect, that some of the cold of space was trickling through our shell.
Perhaps Nomo Kell with a greater sensitiveness had become aware of this
before we had.</p>

<p>"I think," I said softly, "that our friend knew what he was about.
Jansca, it strikes me it is getting cold."</p>

<p>She did not answer, and I turned my head to see why. Her hand had
suddenly gone chill in mine. I gasped. Her head had slumped down on her
breast, fallen a way that it would have seemed the natural outcome of
her nestling me had it not been for the iciness of her hand.</p>

<p>A great horror crept over me, a feeling of utter lassitude. Through
split fractions of a second--too small to measure by any accepted
standard of time, though they felt like hours--the advancing tide of
chill torpor crept over me, numbing all my faculties.</p>

<p>With horror I realized that we were grip of that mysterious force
that more than one space-liner floundering, a derelict, about the void.
And at that all things seemed to go before me. It was as though a veil
of mist had been drawn down between us and the rest of the ship,
shutting me out from sound and sight and consciousnes of all other
life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>The Space-Raiders</h3>

<p>BUT this phase must have been merely momentary. For a reason that
became apparent later I did not entirely lose consciousness. I must
have trembled on the brink of coma for an instant, then the rising tide
of life came flooding back through my veins.</p>

<p>I felt the slight stir of movement beside me, tried to turn my head,
discovered to my great surprise that I could. I found myself looking
into Jansca's wide expressive eyes.</p>

<p>"Darling, are you all right?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quickly. "But what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" I said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" There was an odd catch in her breath. Her face hardened as she
flung a glance about here, saw all the others on that deck slumped down
in their chairs.</p>

<p>"The space-raiders," she breathed. "We are in their hands. But I
thought the cold..."</p>

<p>"So did I, Jansca, but for some reason we've managed to fight it off
apparently. It's a puzzle."</p>

<p>I made a movement as though to rise but she caught me by the arm,
dragged me back.</p>

<p>"We must remain as we are, pretending to be
asleep--unconscious--like the others. If we move we may blunder into
something, gain nothing, lose everything."</p>

<p>There was wisdom in her suggestion even though the forced inaction
irked me. She caught my arm again, so tightly that I gasped.</p>

<p>"What?" I said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see it?" She pointed to the quartzite windows that gave
us a view of empty space and the stars beyond. Only now it was not
empty. Something that might have been a wisp of smoke or the drift of
thin rain seemed to be blocking the windows. Then I saw that it had
blotted out the stars. It was the ship of the space raiders!</p>

<p>More correctly we did not see it. We had no means of knowing that it
was there save that it interposed between us and the stars and hid them
from our vision.</p>

<p>An idea came to me. I closed one eye. Dimly then I began to see a
form, a cigar-shaped thing, the space-ship of these strange entities,
resting in mid-ether, so to speak, side by side with our own vessel. No
doubt its connecting port was already clamped against our port, which
could be opened on the outside by the emergency manual machinery.</p>

<p>I opened my eye, and stared at the shape beyond the quartzite
windows with the sight of both eyes. The shape was no longer visible.
It had become absorbed in the blackness of space. But I knew it was
there.</p>

<p>"You see?" I said. "You understand what it is?"</p>

<p>Jansca nodded. "I can guess at the principle by which they make
themselves invisible. But what I can't yet understand--"</p>

<p>She did not complete the sentence. Instead she slumped down in her
chair, releasing my hand as she did so. I took the cue from her. I
could not see what it was that had alarmed her and I dared not raise
myself in the chair to find out.</p>

<p>I did not have to wait long. But what I saw seemed for the moment so
monstrous and incredible that I could hardly believe my eyes. A
procession of bodies was advancing along the deck, the bodies of those
officers who should at this time of night have been in the control
room.</p>

<p>The eerie thing about it all was that the bodies were seemingly
floating in the air, at a distance of three or four feet above the
deck. While the head and legs were more or less on a level in each case
the middle part of the body sagged, dipped or drooped.</p>

<p>For a split second I stared, forgetting that I was supposed to be
unconscious. Then quickly the meaning of it all came flooding back to
me, and with it the memory of that queer tale--which I had
half-disbelieved at the time--told to us by Mrs. Galon on board the
M.E. Seventy-five.</p>

<p>The unconscious figures of the officers were being carried! Carried
by those invisible entities, whom, for want of a better phrase, we
called the space raiders.</p>

<p>The procession came closer, drew level. At the head and shoulders of
each of our men I could see now a vague misty outline, a thing that
flickered uncannily in the glare from the stored-sunlight tubes that
lit the deck.</p>

<p>Neither Jansca nor I made a movement. We saw the unconscious men
deposited in vacant chairs, there was a moment's wait, then came the
passing in front of our eyes of those fluid misty things. There were
eight of them.</p>

<p>Jansca made a slight movement. She had a tiny handbag in her lap, a
thing of light and glittering metal and as she stirred it slipped to
the floor with a tinkling clatter. Foolishly she bent to pick it up
before I could stop her.</p>

<p>IT was as though several columns of mists opposite us stood still
for an instant, then began to advance toward us. A chair was in the way
of the oncoming entities. I know that beecause I saw it pushed to one
side.</p>

<p>I think I must have lost my head, I sprang to my feet, drawing my
ray tube as I did so, and levelled it at the nearest mist-like figure.
In my agitation I loosed the full charge.</p>

<p>There came a spurt of light and I staggered back, half-blinded. But
where the mist had been a moment before there was a tumbled heap on
deck, something whose outlines were rapidly thickening and taking
shape. As though a body were being molded there under our eyes.</p>

<p>Jansca must have sprung to her feeta moment after me, for almost on
the heels of my discharge came another spurt of light from beside me an
almost inaudible click of the ray-tube mechanism. I did not look to see
what damage she had done, but tried to keep my eyes on the other
mist-wraiths, the very vagueness of their outline endowed them with a
kind of will-o'-the-wisp quality that was in itsell quieting.</p>

<p>A moment I waited--expecting I knew not what diabolical force loosed
on us in reprisal. But nothing happened--and then abruptly the swirls
of mist were vanishing up the deck in the direction of the control-room
quarters.</p>

<p>Ray tube in hand I started in pursuit, Jansca panting along beside
me. And as I ran I flicked the button of my weapon. We did not wait to
see what became of the things that fell at our feet, but kept on, for I
did not know what damage the others might do if we did not keep them in
sight.</p>

<p>Thee door of the control room opened and closed uncannily as we came
abreast of it. It opened again the very next instant and something came
hissing out. What it was I could not see--either because it too was
invisible or else it moved too swiftly--but it passed between us and
crashed against the opposite wall of the deck. A huge wet splash
appeared on the Marsonite surface, as though someone had cast a bucket
of water there and the air seemed of a sudden to have turned icy.</p>

<p>I breathed. "Jansca, stay here! You mustn't take the risk."</p>

<p>"That's for me to say," she gasped with a sob in her voice.</p>

<p>There was no time to argue with her. Feeling that we were taking our
lives in our hands I dashed in through the open door of the control
room, expecting every second to find another icy missile, better aimed
this time, hurled at us. But nothing happened.</p>

<p>To make doubly certain we followed the descent down to the port
against which they had linked their ship. For some reason the light
here had failed but we blundered on. Then, with the most surprising
luck in the Universe, I blundered into something. It felt, soft, and
cold and repellent to the touch, like a dead body, save that there was
a jelly-like flow of it away from under my hand.</p>

<p>In my horror I flickered the button of ray-tube. The catch must have
slipped somehow, for I don't think it have given a full discharge. I
heard an odd sound like a thin wail, there was a rush of cold air past
me. Then as something creaked under my feet, I realized that we were on
the edge of the passageway our visitors had clamped against the port of
the <i>Cosmos</i>. I drew back abruptly, pulling Jansca with me.</p>

<p>The planets know what would have happened had I not done so. It was
purely an instinctive movement, for I hadn't time to stop and think
that the stranger ship would probably cast off at once. Yet this is
much what must have happened and had I not pulled back then another few
seconds might have seen us hurled out to our deaths in space.</p>

<p>I heard a creaking almost at my feet and blindly flashed my ray-tube
in the direction from which the sound came. I know now, what I did not
realize at the time, that it was the preliminary movement of casting
off. But what I did realize the very next instant was that the air of
the <i>Cosmos</i> was beginning to whistle off into space. I got the port
closed just in time.</p>

<p>Panting I leaned against the port through which we and the whole
ship's company had nearly come to our deaths, striving to get my
breathing back to normal. Jansca, who had been further back than I, had
not fared so badly. Her cry of horror roused me.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I gasped.</p>

<p>A quartzite window had been let into the port and the slide had been
drawn back, giving us an outlook on empty space. At the moment it
framed a picture that I shall remember to my dying day.</p>

<p>A huge space-ship, larger than anything I had ever seen, was slowly
taking form before my eyes. It was a glistening monster that would have
made six of the <i>Cosmos</i>, latest product of the interplanetary genius
though she was. But the most appalling part of what we saw was that the
stranger vessel seemed to be breaking in halves.</p>

<p>A great gap showed in the quarter nearest to us, a red-rimmed
outline, that spread as we watched. To this day I am not quite sure
just exactly what had occurred, though I feel that that last flicker of
my ray tube must have set my opponent afire instead of killing him
outright.</p>

<p>How or why the blaze spread, I cannot say; the only thing of which I
really can be certain is that they must have had a store of explosives
of unknown potency on board. For even as we watched The huge ship
stretched out like an overfilled balloon and burst into a myriad
fragments that whirled and glowed, that faded and passed at last in
flickering extinction out into the uncharted depths of space.</p>

<p>THE <i>Cosmos</i> bounced like a kicked football and the vibrations of
the explosion, soundless though they were, reached out and buffeted us
a thousand miles or more out of our course. Jansca and I were thrown
against each other and dropped, battered, bruised and breathless, on
the dark floor of the passage.</p>

<p>Fumbling for her hand I found it, and helped her upright. For the
moment we both gasped in the rarefied air. It was that which reminded
me how narrowly we had escaped a terrible death.</p>

<p>The little air left in the passage where we were was thin enough in
all conscience and its effect on us was momentarily becoming more
pronounced. I felt dizzy and something was wrong apparently with both
my lungs and heart. Jansca, used to a thinner atmosphere, was not so
distressed. Nevertheless the sooner we got back to a normal pressure
the better for us both.</p>

<p>I did not waste words and air in telling her what I wanted but drew
her back to the center of the ship. She came staggering, as I most
certainly did myself, until a few yards brought us up against the
valved door that had fallen into place behind our backs.</p>

<p>After some ineffectual fumbling I found a switch and a tube overhead
glowed brightly enough to show me the mechanism that opened the door. I
turned the graduated scale, letting the air fill in by degrees.</p>

<p>Jansca still clung to me. Now that the worst was over the reaction
had come and it was hard to recognize her as the daring Amazon who had
taken a stand beside me and driven the strange invaders from our
ship.</p>

<p>I made at once for the control room for I had no idea how the vessel
was drifting. It took a few minutes' intricate calculation before I
learned what I wished to know. That done it was a simple matter to
correct the error bring and the <i>Cosmos</i> back to the space-lane she had
been following.</p>

<p>Locking the gears so that we could not slew off again I turned away
to find Jansca regarding me. "Well, my dear" she said, "is it all right
now?"</p>

<p>"I think everything's right as far as this end of it is concerned,"
I told her, "but there's still quite a lot for us to do."</p>

<p>I took her in my arms and kissed her. "That," I said, "is for the
help you've given me. Come on now, my dear, better not waste any more
time. I'm not sure, you see, whether we killed or merely paralyzed
those folk we dropped, so keep your ray tube handy in case of
trouble."</p>

<p>Our fears were groundless, however. None of the raiders was left
alive. Jansca and I, by some species of luckyaccident, had killed all
those we struck. There were seven of them, scattered at intervals along
the route from the control floor to the spot on the promenade deck
where we had first encountered them. Whatever the invisible process,
its effects evidently were neutralized by the discharge from our
ray-tubes.</p>

<p>We did not linger to examine them, however. Either we had not been
treated to as big a dose of the anesthetic as the <i>M. E. Seventy-five</i>
or else something had happened to neutralize it very quickly for there
were signs as we made our way down to the deck that some of the company
were already stirring. Hume had slid down from the chair on they had
placed him and was lolling on the deck in a sitting position.</p>

<p>I caught him by the shoulder and shook him. He opened his eyes,
blinking stupidly, then lurched sideways as though he were going off
into a faint. I caught him.</p>

<p>"Steady on," I said. "Wake up!" As I shook him again.</p>

<p>This time he opened his eyes to the full, stared from Jansca to me
in a puzzled fashion. "Ah, Sanders," he said slowly.</p>

<p>He held out his hand to me and with an effort I hauled him to his
feet. He stood there an instant swaying, then with what must have been
a powerful of will he got himself under control.</p>

<p>"Go on, Jack," he said urgently. "I think I'm all right now. The
last I can remember is doing something in the control room and now I
come to and find myself out here. It's not--"</p>

<p>A FLICKER of alarm passed across his face. I guessed what he had
left unsaidd.</p>

<p>"These space-visitors we were warned against," I said. "Yes, we had
a raid from them, though this time there've been casualties."</p>

<p>"Casualties? <i>Gods?</i> Any of us killed?"</p>

<p>"No, the raiders. Jansca and I--"</p>

<p>"But how"--his brow wrinkled--"how in the stars did you escape?"</p>

<p>"I've my own ideas, but they can wait for explanation until later.
Meanwhile--do you feel better now?"</p>

<p>"Much." He brushed a hand across his brow and involuntarily squared
his shoulders. "This stuff seems to wear off quickly, once one opens
one's eyes. But, the ship!"</p>

<p>"I've set her on her course. The automatic control will carry on. I
would suggest, however, that we wake up the rest of your fellows."</p>

<p>He made a movement as though to go off and do it at once. I caught
his sleeve. "Stay," I said. "Jansca will attend to that. You and I have
other things to do. We've killed some of the space-raiders. Their
bodies--"</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said quickly.</p>

<p>"--had better be taken from here. Perhaps you and I between us can
get them on to the control-deck. Then we may have the worst of it over
before the bulk of the passengers are awake enough to realize what
we're doing."</p>

<p>The details of our task can well be spared but it was over and done
with and our space-visitors removed to the control-deck in less time
than we had anticipated. Jansca too had done her work well. When at
last we paused for breath and looked about us it was to find that the
officers had trickled back to their places, looking sick and
bewildered.</p>

<p>The passengers too were stirring, all aware that something bizarre
had occurred while they were unconscious. The guard-bar at the entrance
to the control-deck was set, however, and a junior officer stationed
there to prevent any invasion of our privacy.</p>

<p>I gave Hume an outline of what had transpired. I could see that he
was not quite sure whether to be most impressed by our luck--he called
it daring--in clearing the ship between us, or puzzled because the
general coma seemed to have passed us by. It was pretty plain to me now
why we had not been left unaffected but I did not want to advertise it
unduly. I fancied he would agree with me when he knew.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "perhaps it would be as well to have a look at
our bag."</p>

<p>Jansca moved forward with us. I would rather she kept away but she
was insistent and for once I did not gainsay her.</p>

<p>An odd sense of familiarity struck me the moment I had leisure to
look the dead beings over carefully. Each was clad from neck to knee in
a coat of some light shiny material, the head of each was covered by a
cap of the same stuff with a mica-like transparency in front for the
eyes.</p>

<p>I gasped as I realized where I had seen such garments before. Jansca
too recalled for her eyes met mine meaningfully.</p>

<p>I bent down swiftly, fumbled with the visor of the helmet.
Inadvertently I must have pressed some spring, for the visor shot back,
revealing the face of the dead being.</p>

<p>A cry from Hume brought me round to him. He had been examining the
next being and had managed to get the helmet clean off the head. As I
turned he was standing with it in his hand, an expression of utter
amazement stamped on his face.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said huskily, pointing.</p>

<p>We looked. The wide staring eyes, vacant of life now, were an odd
shade of purple, the pupils queerly flecked.</p>

<p>The skin of the face was blotchy red and starting at the forehead
and running back to the occiput was a horn-like ridge.</p>

<p>I nodded. "They're all like that," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Hume said quickly, "but this particular one--he's not a
stranger. I've seen his face before--on this ship."</p>

<p>"I know," I said deliberately. "And his name, in case you have
forgotten, is Nomo Kell."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>Rendezvous</h3>

<p>HUME nodded. "Nomo Kell, the man you were suspicious of from the
first time you saw him. I only wish now," he added bitterly, "that I'd
taken notice of your suspicions."</p>

<p>"I couldn't give a name to my suspicion. I felt he was odd, that's
all. And all the taking notice in the Universe wouldn't have made
matters one whit better. As it is now we know something. We've made a
point of contact and we have some sort of a clue to guide us when we
want it."</p>

<p>Others of the officers were gathering round now, staring curiously.
Gond came out of the control-room, and stopped with a little gasp of
surprise. I could see from the man's face that he was itching to know
all that had happened and I could hardly blame him.</p>

<p>He was passing by when Hume called him. "Just a moment, Mr. Gond,"
he said. "We may need you."</p>

<p>Hume himself turned back to me. "Jack," he said, "what should we do
with these bodies? It's for you to say."</p>

<p>"Keep one, dressed and all," I said promptly. "It may be wanted for
purposes of study. The others we'd better bury in space. Strip their
cloaks and helmets first. They'll certainly be wanted for
examination."</p>

<p>"Good," he said. He gave the first crilicer instructions, satisfied
his curiosity in part and came back to us. On his arm were the cloak
and helmet he had stripped from Nomo Kell.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, "you and Miss Dirka may wish to have a talk with
me. I know I want to talk with you. My cabin's the most private place
on this ship."</p>

<p>I looked at Jansca and she nod "All right," I said to Hume. "Lead
the way."</p>

<p>It wasn't until we were comfortably seated in Hume's cabin and all
precautions taken against outside interference that any of us spoke
again.</p>

<p>"What I'd most like to know," Hume said deliberately, "is why you
two alone out of all the ship's company, were not overcome."</p>

<p>"It's quite simple," I said smiling. "We did it unwittingly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, by accident you've discovered some way of combatting
whatt it is Nomo Kell's people use, so I think it's up to you to make
your discovery public property."</p>

<p>"You and Jansca would be the first to protest against doing anything
of the sort."</p>

<p>Jansca made an odd movement of impatience. "Don't mystify us merely
to amuse yourself, Jack," she said softly. "I don't know anything more
than Captain Hume does of this matter. What is it, my dear? Can't you
see we're impatient?"</p>

<p>For answer I put my hand in my pocket, drew out the little steel box
and placed it on the table between us.</p>

<p>"That," I said.</p>

<p>Hume half-started to his feet. <i>"Oxcta!"</i> he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jansca nodded. "I arrived at the conclusion by a process of
elimination. Jack missed his dinner. With his forethought for others he
wouldn't trouble the kitchen staff getting a late meal so he decided to
carry on on Oxcta. I came down to see him, saw the signs of the stuff
and asked for some myself. It kept me awake, energized me, gave me a
chance to be of help."</p>

<p>"And it seems you were of considerable help, Miss Dirka," he said.
"If the Council don't make you an honorary Member of the Guard, they
don't know merit when they hear of it. If Jack won't report you I
shall."</p>

<p>"You'd better do it," I hinted. "Mightn't look well coming from me
since we're going to marry soon."</p>

<p>"Never mind me, what I do or don't deserve," said Jansca calmly.
"Let us get to business."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" I queried.</p>

<p>"We've discovered certain facts," she said. "I suggest we make them
public, save lives. It will certainly save trouble."</p>

<p>Hume leaned forward across the table, his dark face suddenly grave.
"Up to a point you're right, Jansca," he said with the easy freedom of
an old friend. "But the main fact, the one that is going the most
important factor in fighting this menace, is one we can't make public.
You and Jack retained your consciousness and were able to ake a sweep
of this ship's crew simply because of Oxcta."</p>

<p>"And," I put in quickly as he paused, "that we can't broadcast."</p>

<p>"No, I'm with you there," Jansca agreed. "I hadn't had that in mind
myself anyway. But before we leave that particular item let me tell you
there is a method of getting over that difficulty. I'm Martian born,
Captain Hume is Martian by adoption and Jack here is"--for the moment I
thought, shuddering, that she was going to say of Sonjhon blood--but
she ran on--"going to marry a Martian. It's a bond of a sort. When we
reach Tlanan, if you'll allow it, I'll see the council, tell them what
Oxcta did for us and suggest a plan. Tambard will listen to me, that I
know. We can make a solution of it--no need to divulge the secret of
its preparation--and supply it to the fighting forces of all the
planets."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea at all," said Hume. "But we've yet to reach Tlanan.
Go on, I think you've more to say."</p>

<p>She flung us a glance of scorn. "You with your superior intellects.
Didn't your experience on the <i>M.E. Seventy-five</i> show you anything,
the two of you?"</p>

<p>"The emergency suits!" I cried.</p>

<p>"That's it," she agreed. "It means wearing them day and night but
they're built to stand the absolute zero of space at a pinch. And the
one thing we know about this anesthetizing cold is that no matter how
it is produced it doesn't remain constant."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it could be kept constant. Point one then is the constant
wearing of space suits. I'm taking this, of course, as applying only to
the fighting forces. Probably all passenger and freight vessels will be
laid up if this menace develops to any extent."</p>

<p>"Have you any point two?" I asked. "And three and perhaps four too,"
she said. "Taking them down, Jack? Good. Well, log it this way. The
space visitors can be killed. We--you and I--have killed them with the
ray tubes. Death, accident or injury renders them visible again. Their
ships can be made visible by the same means."</p>

<p>"One moment," I interrupted her. "Hume, that helmet and cloak. Hand
them over, please."</p>

<p>He did so. There was absolute silence in the cabin while I examined
first the cloak, and then the helmet. I had begun by thinking that
invisibility was induced by the substance with which the two articles
were painted but consideration showed me that in one case at least this
could not be so.</p>

<p>I had seen Nomo Kell walking the deck with this self-same cloak on
him and the queer headgear that had then attracted my attention had
been the helmet with the visor and ear-flaps drawn up. Obviously then
this invisibility was not a permanent feature.</p>

<p>In view of that the problem narrowed down to a question of
vibrations and this presupposed a battery of some sort. Presently I
found one, a tremendously light battery of the new Dirac type, small
enough to be concealed under the left armpit of the cloak.</p>

<p>Then by accident I discovered that one of the buttons on the cloak
acted as a switch by which the current inducing the vibrations could be
turned on and off. I found this out by the simple process of turning it
idly. To my astonishment the button pivoted round in a half-turn and
the cloak incontinently vanished. I could still feel its weight and
substance in my hand.</p>

<p>"You see!" I cried.</p>

<p>Jansca appeared to take the discovery for granted--and as for
Hume--well, I fully believe that by then he was past being astonished
by anything.</p>

<p>"I've never seen the principle applied before," he remarked, "but
it's been more or less common knowledge for years. Curved light, that's
what it is, curved so that it flows round the object instead of being
reflected back from it. Once you've found a mechanical method of
bending a light ray out of its path, you've achieved practical
invisibility."</p>

<p>"I won't say you're entirely wrong," I remarked as I twisted back
the button and once more rendered the cloak visible. "In fact I think
you're right--up to a point. But apparently the properties aren't
constant. They have to be activated by the vibrations set up by this
battery."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite grasp that," Jansca said with a puzzled
air.</p>

<p>"It's simple enough," I told her. "You know that human ears, whether
they are Martian, Tellurian or Venusian, have a limited range of
audibility."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>I went on. "Birds and animals can hear sounds that are too high or
too low in the scale to make any impression on our eardrums. The same
thing applies to sight. Our eyes are attuned to respond merely to a
limited range of vibration. Get above or below that limited range and a
thing becomes invisible. It is a result that can be obtained
mechanically by speeding up the rate of light vibrations."</p>

<p>"Or by slowing them down," said Hume. "Either would answer, I take
it."</p>

<p>"I should imagine so," I said a trifle dubiously. "At any rate this
little gadget in the cloak apparently works the miracle so I don't see
that the rest matters."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?" Jansca interrupted. "I should think it rather
important."</p>

<p>"Why?" I queried, interested. I knew she had a singularly clear
sense of ception in most matters and when she made a suggestion it was
usually worth listening to.</p>

<p>"Because," she said slowly, "if we wish to combat this invisible
menace must know something about the method they use to produce
it."</p>

<p>I FLUNG out my hands and nodded towards the cloak and helmet on
table.</p>

<p>"We do," I said. "There's the evidence."</p>

<p>"And your last words," she retorted scathingly, "are evidence that
you don't quite realize the nature of one at least of your
discoveries."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I smiled.</p>

<p>"In the first place we found that when we attacked these people with
our tubes their visibility returned slowly and gradually. Therefore the
ray has power to neutralize the vibrations that induce visibility. Most
probably breaks the circuit somehow. Is that plain enough?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I said, springing to my feet. "I see what you're
driving at. Our ray becomes effective by using a high scale vibration.
It is so high in fact it can also speed up the vital proceses of a
human being to the very point of dissolution."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Jansca. "So the vibrations we are seeking must be
below, not above, the range of human perception."</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "the sooner we make our discoveries known in the
proper quarters the better for the three worlds. None of us are
scientists and our deductions may have to be checked for errors but the
main point is our ray not only renders our antagonists visible but will
also kill them. It is not necessary to kill them. I think they cab be
deprived of their invisibility by a non-lethal ray of the same
vibratory pitch. How's that?"</p>

<p>"An epoch-making discovery, I should imagine," said Jansca with a
slightly sarcastic note in her voice. "Jack, suppose you code this
information--you Guards have a code of your own, I believe--and beam it
to the representatives of the Council."</p>

<p>I drew my pad towards me, scribbled quickly for some minutes while
the other sat silent, awaiting my pleasure. At last I flung down my
pencil and looked up.</p>

<p>"I've made it as clear as I possibly can," I said, "though I've had
to put some words in English since there is no equivalent in the code I
use."</p>

<p>"Want to send it yourself?" said Hume in reference to the message.
"I'll have the transmitting room cleared if you wish."</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter," I assured him. "The operator on duty can send it
providing he sends it as it stands."</p>

<p>"Right." Hume pushed the button, and waited for the answer to come
from the transmitting room. Almost immediately the surface of his
vision-plate glowed and the voice of the operator sounded in the room.
Hume had left his communicator open so that we could hear every word
that was said.</p>

<p>"Operator? Captain Hume here. Message to be sent at once. Yes,
general call to Guard-ships. Is your vision-plate clear? Good. Here's
the message then."</p>

<p>He took the first sheet on which I had written my report--special
sheets prepared for the purpose and cut to size--and placed it in a
clamp that held it steady against the vision-plate. A few seconds
passed, then came the operator's voice through the communicator, "Next
sheet, please, Captain."</p>

<p>The process was repeated until the sheets were exhausted, then again
came the calm, unhurried voice of the operator, "Message completed,
Captain. I'll call through when I get an answer."</p>

<p>The light in the vision-plate surface died, and Hume handed me back
the sheets. "You know how best to deal with these," he said
meaningly.</p>

<p>I wadded them up, dropped them in a basin under the water-faucet,
and allowed a trickle to play on them. The sheets spread out, dissolved
into liquid and passed down the flush pipe into the depths of
space.</p>

<p>I was turning back from my work of destruction when the communicator
sounded again.</p>

<p>"Message for Interplanetary Guard Officer Sanders, aboard
Space-Liner <i>Cosmos</i>," came in the operator's metallic tones. "Message
begins. 'Space-Liner <i>Cosmos</i> required to report immediately at Martian
rendezvous base. Signature Tambard.' Message ends."</p>

<p>I whistled softly. I had met Tambard once or twice in the course of
my work. A singularly dynamic personality when roused to action, yet
one whom it took much to stir. That he should be directing
investigations in person away from his own planet suggested that
matters might already have reached a stage of greater seriousness than
we had imagined possible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>The Gaudien Base</h3>

<p>EXACTLY twenty-three and a half hours after receiving the message we
arrived at Gaudien. On board the <i>Cosmos</i> things had already reached
the stage where it was manifestly impossible to keep the real state of
affairs hidden any longer from the passengers.</p>

<p>Rather than have wild rumors racing round the ship I prepared a
digest of the situation and had it posted on the various notice boards.
There was no sense in pretending there was no occasion for alarm.
Instead I called on all to give every possible help to the staff to
enable them to maintain smooth running.</p>

<p>My appeal, I fancy, justified the terms in which it was cast by the
result it achieved. There was no panic, no sign of alarm anywhere. A
touch of anxiety and apprehension I did notice and Jansca reported that
she had literally been besieged by questioners. She handled them all
with her good-humored Martian tactfulness.</p>

<p>Feeling from the first that we required someone who, while still one
of the passengers, could speak with a certain authority, I had
appointed her to the position. Her work was simply to keep the social
activities moving, and deprecate any alarmist tendencies.</p>

<p>The Council, I was sure, would have no hesitation in appointing her
an honorary Guard once my report went in and they had time to study it.
Both she and her father would certainly value the silver comet's tail
that is the symbol of that honor far more than they would the
Interplanetary Guardsman's own badge. After all not one civilian in a
million ever qualifies for that honorary award.</p>

<p>To come to Gaudien. Long before we made contact that huge structure
of glittering metal, a veritable city in the void, was visible against
the background of interstellar space.</p>

<p>In the early days of interplanetary travel it became increasingly
obvious that the Guard-ships must have some base in the void to obviate
the necessity of having to run for their home planets for repairs and
fuel. We Earthlings were fortunate in that in our own Moon we had a
ready-made base a quarter of a million miles away. So on the side of
our satellite that is invisible from Earth our refuelling and repair
depot was established.</p>

<p>Mars, less, fortunate, had to construct such a base in space. The
result is a lasting monument to the friendship between three worlds,
that banished the last of the ill-feeling which lingered for years
after the disastrous business of the War of the Planets.</p>

<p>The plans for the Gaudien base were actually based on designs drawn
up so long ago as the year 1929 by Captain Hermann Noordung, a German
engineer and authority on mechanics, who was perhaps the first of all
Earthmen to deal with the problems of space navigation seriously.</p>

<p>The final result is all the more remarkable when one considers that
the greater part of the work was done in free space, that only the
nucleus was built on Maim and the rest of the floating base built up
bit by bit by working in space suits of metal, which again we owe to
Captain Noordung's fertile invention.</p>

<p>These space suits were necessary the beginning, since the men had
work in an airless heatless void under remarkably trying conditions.
But once Gaudien--for so the base was named after the Martian engineer
who played the greatest part in its construction was completed, the
scientists immediately set to work to provide it with an atmosphere of
its own.</p>

<p>The huge city in space, for such it was, was alive with lights,
light so confusing that only the Guards' captains actually know the
meaning of them all. Ordinary space liners usually are content to give
the place a wide berth, and when they do not it is because either they
are in trouble or in charge o a Guard.</p>

<p>As the clamps closed over our hull and drew it down softly into the
nest prepared for it a gangway was run up against our main entrance
port, and the moment it was opened half a dozen Martian officials
strode through.</p>

<p>I was there at the entrance to meet them and I recognized the
foremost as the redoubtable Tambard himself. To my surprise I saw just
behind the dapper birdlike figure of little Clinigo, the Venusian
member of Council. I had not expected him and the latest news had been
that he was on his home planet.</p>

<p>Tambard was tall even for a Martian but he was built so perfectly in
proportion that only when one saw him siting beside an Earthman did his
height become apparent. He towered over me and there was a frown on his
face that I liked but ill. However, his first words set me at my
ease.</p>

<p>"Ah, Clinigo," he said to his confrere with that easy disregard of
all titles that marked the Council as men apart, "here is Sanders
himself. Clinigo, your good fortune to meet in the one of the smartest
space-captains in the Interplanetary Service. Tellus has the honor of
producing him."</p>

<p>LONG before I had become acquainted properly with Tambard I always
fancied there was an undercurrent of sarcasm in words such as these but
now I knew him well enough to realize he meant exactly what he said. He
was pleased with me, pleased with my poor way of handling things and he
said so in the Martian fashion, extravagantly.</p>

<p>Clinigo stepped forward at the introduction with his right hand on
his heartin the formal fashion of the Venusian and I brought my hand up
smartly to the salute. I was no longer in mufti but had donned my
uniform, the skyblue of the Guards with the silver Guard-ship on each
wing of the collar and the silver lace design of the planetary
system--the badge of my rank--on my left sleeve.</p>

<p>The two stood a little apart after that, ignoring me for the moment
as was the custom, while the port chief or his deputy examined Hume's
papers. The port authority moved back. Hume handed the initialed papers
to the purser. There was a pause, then Tambard crooked his little
finger at me.</p>

<p>"Sanders," he said, "we must talk things over. No, not here on the
ship, but on Gaudien. I think you have much to tell us that was hinted
at in your report. You mentioned others whose words would support your
conclusions. Is Hume one?"</p>

<p>"He is one," I agreed.</p>

<p>"And the other? She?" He made the slightest motion of his head in
Jansca's direction and I could swear that a smile curved the corners of
his mouth.</p>

<p>"She," I said, striving to hold my voice so that it would not betray
me. "She, sir, is the other."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" The question was rapped out.</p>

<p>"One Jansca Dirka, the daughter of a director of the Canal Company
of Mars," I answered. "She also," I added, "and this, sir, is the more
important in my eyes, is my affianced and my invaluable assistant."</p>

<p>His eyes twinkling Tambard turned to Clinigo. "There seems some
magic in these Earthmen, Clinigo," he said, "that in a few short days
one of them can not only win a Martian maiden but can fire her with his
own spirit, so that she can qualify for an honorary membership of the
Guard." Clinigo smiled a little. I think he was not very interested in
us save in so far as the information we had to give concerned him and
his office.</p>

<p>"An apt helpmeet, I should think," he said.</p>

<p>Tambard shrugged. I often wondered in the days that followed if
there was any possibility of friction between the pair but luckily for
the Planets it never came to that.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Tambard. "This conference now..." He touched me
lightly on the arm, beckoned Hume and Jansca to come with us.</p>

<p>Tambard apparently was using with Clinigo the room of an officer in
command as an office. At least I saw there, when we came to it, many
gadgets that were not usual, some of which bore traces of having been
hurriedly affixed and quite recently.</p>

<p>The Martian motioned us to seats but surprisingly it was Hume who
first broke the silence. "My ship and the passengers, sir?" he
queried.</p>

<p>"Are safe," said Tambard. "The passengers will not get into
mischief, for they will not be allowed to land. It is scarcely worth
while. All of you will be on your way to Tlanan again before thirty of
your Earth minutes have passed."</p>

<p>Good news, I thought. Then a sudden doubt assailed me. Was Tambard
including me in what he said? I would dearly have liked to have asked
him and cleared the matter up at once, but I did not dare. He addressed
himself first to me.</p>

<p>"Start from the moment of sailing," he said, "and tell us all that
has the slightest bearing on the case."</p>

<p>I told him everything, suppressing only those matters of purely
private concern which had transpired between Jansca and myself. And, of
course, seeing Clinigo was present, I mentioned nothing of that purely
Martian secret, the Oxcta pellets.</p>

<p>Both members of the Council listened attentively to the end, when
Clinigo spoke for the first time. "An admirable exposition," he
remarked. "Even more admirable is the fact that despite its
condensation you have been able to add little of material value to your
message."</p>

<p>TAMBARD sat silent and thoughtfully his fingers drumming noiselessly
on the table-top in front of him.</p>

<p>"An odd situation," he said at last. "Frankly--we can all be
outspoken here and know that nothing goes beyond the walls of this
room--we don't quite know what to make of it. If an attack had been
made on any of our ships we would know what to expect. But so far
nothing of the kind has occurred. The only bloodshed, the only
destruction achieved rests at our door. Or yours rather."</p>

<p>"One moment," I spoke. "That explosion, when the stranger ship flew
pieces, to my mind throws a sidelight on things. I reason it was the
ignition of high explosives that caused her end. And, I'd say, those
high explosives, their nature whatever it was, were intended for a
purpose."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Tambard coolly. "But these explosives were not used
against our ships. Your space-visitors--we must call them that for want
of a better name--boarded each ship they came to a seemingly left it in
the state they found it. The obvious conclusion is that they boarded it
for purposes of examination."</p>

<p>"Infusoria under the microscope." For the life of me I could not
help using that century-and-a-half-old phrase of Wells. Tambard looked
puzzled, so I plained the allusion delicately, of course, for <i>The War
of the Worlds</i> as a book ever a was ever a sore point with your
Martian.</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Tambard when he had grasped what I meant. "I would
agree without reservation if we seemed to be dealing with vastly higher
intelligences than our own. They are using forces whose existence and
of many of of whose methods of application we are already aware. Given
time our scientists can puzzle them out."</p>

<p>"The point," said Clinigo, "is that we be given time. Tambard, why
are we being studied?"</p>

<p>"Our ships? It may merely be in a spirit of scientific curiosity
though I doubt that. Most probably we are dealing with spies."</p>

<p>"In the message I received," I interrupted "there was a phrase
referring to a menace to the Universe."</p>

<p>Tambard's face went grave. "That is so," he agreed. "I was
responsible for that. It was my suggestion, but Clinigo here agreed
with me and Harran is already of the same opinion."</p>

<p>"May I ask a question?" Jansca spoke and Tambard nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that any can tell me," she said daringly, "but I
should imagine that we might arrive at some more definite conclusion
about the menace we have to face if we knew with whom we are to deal.
Can you suggest from where the space-visitors are likely to have
come?"</p>

<p>"They do not come from Tlanan, Venus or Tellus, of that we can be
certain," the Martian returned. "The major planets--such as are
inhabited--possess no peoples so far advanced in space-navigation.
There remain to be considered then but two possible planets, the outost
and the innermost."</p>

<p>"Pluto and Mercury!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Tambard. "Of Pluto we know little, of Mercury even
less. One far from the Sun, the other too near it to allow observations
to be made with any degree of accuracy."</p>

<p>"Of the two I would favor Mercury," I told him. And when he looked
questioningly I explained what I had learned of Nomo Kell. Apparently
he had not paid much attention to that part of the story. Now I
stressed the point, particularly what Parey had told me about the
argument over the condition of Mercury in which Nomo Kell had flatly
declared the others did not know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>"There is always the possibility," he said thoughtfully. "I wonder
if we could learn anything from the body."</p>

<p>"The dead space-visitor we kept on the <i>Cosmos</i>?" Hume queried.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tambard. "Only he's not on the <i>Cosmos</i> now but down in
the laboratories. Our scientists--"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. "Excuse me," he said, and turned and whispered
something to Clinigo. I saw Clinigo nod and rise to his feet. He
sauntered to the door and passed through. Tambard turned to me.</p>

<p>"Clinigo and I agreed," he said with a curious half-smile, "that it
would be well if he went down to the laboratories and had a look about
himself. He can use his eyes--he is trained to observation of that
sort. Now--someone here has something to say that had better be said
before Clinigo returns." Tambard looked meaningfully towards
Jansca.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>The New Command</h3>

<p>"I have," Jansca said simply. I stared at her, then turned to
Tambard. Somehow, during the course of conversation, a word, a sign
must have passed between them, something that a Martian alone could
understand.</p>

<p>"Speak on," Tambard advised her. "Time is short."</p>

<p>"It's only this," she said hurriedly, "though it's rather important.
The reason why Jack"--she nodded towards me---"and I were not stupefied
when those people boarded the <i>Cosmos</i> is that we'd each had some Oxcta
not long before."</p>

<p>"So that's it," said Tambard gravely. "I thought from the mention of
emergency suits as a temporary measure"--he was referring to a line in
my message--"that there was something more to come. But--Oxcta!"</p>

<p>He looked from me to Hume and the latter colored. "I'm afraid," he
said apologetically, "that the fault was mine. I gave it to
Sanders."</p>

<p>Tambard stared at him a space, then his stern face relaxed. "You
have the right to carry it, of course," he said.</p>

<p>"You've acquired that right because of your wife...a Tlananian
lady. You also have the right to exercise your discretion as to whom
you should offer it."</p>

<p>He turned easily to Jansca. "You had your own supply, I suppose?" he
said.</p>

<p>Jansca shook her head. "I got mine from Jack."</p>

<p>"Ah." Tambard's eyes came round to me. "And you got it from--?"</p>

<p>Hume pulled himself upright in his seat. "From me," he said. "I used
my discretion."</p>

<p>For a long second Tambard brooded over us. But again Jansca saved
the situation.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any question about the rights or wrongs of
the case," she said with a touch of indignation. "Jack is perfectly
entitled to Oxcta, even more so than Captain Hume. "</p>

<p>"He has not yet married a Martian wife," Tambard reminded her.</p>

<p>"But"--Jansca's voice quivered a little--"but he is of the blood--a
Sonjhon!"</p>

<p>Hume uttered a wordless exclamation, Tambard stared at her long and
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You did that?" he said with a note of perfect amazement in his
voice. "You thought enough of him for that?"</p>

<p>"I would do it again. But"--her voice faltered--"I did not expect so
soon to have to make it known."</p>

<p>Tambard sighed. "Perhaps it is just as well," he said softly. "It
may simplify matters considerably. However, dismiss the matter of the
Oxcta from your minds for the present. I'll attend to all that it
implies. Will you take over a new command, Sanders?"</p>

<p>I hesitated. A command of a Martian Guard-ship fleet, temporary
though it might be, was not a thing lightly to be undertaken. Even had
I been a free agent I would have debated before accepting. As it was
even though on vacation I was still attached to the Earth service.</p>

<p>"There's nothing I'd like better," I said at last, "but I can't
decide of myself without Harran's permission."</p>

<p>"Harran has already given it," said Tambard patiently.</p>

<p>I think I must have looked some of the chagrin I felt. Duty tugged
me one way. The thoughts of my interrupted holiday and of Jansca drew
me the other.</p>

<p>Tambard looked up at me thoughtfully. "Still," he said, "unless the
unexpected happens you will not be required immediately. I would
suggest you resume your interrupted voyage to Tlanan in the
<i>Cosmos</i>--it might not be wise follow your original intention and
proceed to Venus--and wait there for orders or developments, whichever
comes first."</p>

<p>"I shall do that," I said stiffly. A holiday of this sort with the
hourly prospect of having to part from Jansca at a moment's notice was
not so inviting as it seemed at first glance.</p>

<p>"A pity," he said musingly, "that you are not mated. It would solve
many difficulties."</p>

<p>"And if we were mated," Jansca asked interestedly, "what difference
would it make?"</p>

<p>"I could give you place with your lord on his ship as second in
command," Tamard said steadily. "It is no new thing! You are too young
yourself to remember the old custom, but I--"</p>

<p>HE stopped abruptly and his eye clouded. It was then I realized how
old Tambard must be. If truth be told he was well into his second
century. Then he would remember, might even have participated in those
wars that twenty or thirty years before the coming of the Earthmen to
the Red Planet had welded the Martians into one nation. Wasn't there
some story--dimly recalled--of his having lost his wife in that
conflict?</p>

<p>"I will take that place then," Janska announced with decision. "That
is"--abruptly she remembered that I had not been consulted and she
dropped her eyes--"if my lord is willing."</p>

<p>"Jansca," I said, "I'm an Earthman and not so conversant with your
wways as I might be, so that must be my excuse if I say anything you
think I should not say. You're a dear to make such a suggestion and I'd
jump at it if it wasn't for the risk."</p>

<p>"What risk?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The risk you would run if you came with me."</p>

<p>"The risk you would run yourself?"</p>

<p>"That is different."</p>

<p>"The difference," she said slowly, "is that with you I would be
sharing in your danger. But if I did not come I should have to
remain--no, not at home, for it not be home without you--at Tlanan and
eat out my heart with anxiety."</p>

<p>I placed my hand on her shoulder and gently pressed her back into
her seat. "Tambard Mitaka," I said formally, "Jansac Dirka will, as my
mate, take command."</p>

<p>Tambard inclined his head in assent. "It is carved in stone," using
the phrase that to a Martian is a decree that is unalterable.</p>

<p>Jansca gave me one look, caught my hand pressed it in her own.</p>

<p>"Sensible man," came in a rumble from Hume.</p>

<p>"Accident or chance, call it what you will, had timed it all nicely.
Another second or so and the door opened and Clingo entered. I took it
from his expression that he had not been as successful as he had
hoped.</p>

<p>"I went--I looked--I saw," he said, "and I confess that I am
baffled. He is like no man of any of the planets I have ever seen. A
ridge of horny substance across the head, and purple eyes. No one has
ever seen such a being alive."</p>

<p>"Nomo Kell," I said quickly. "I told you of nim."</p>

<p>Clinigo nodded. "So you did," said Tambard. "Yet Nomo Kell was
posing as a Martian."</p>

<p>"Of twenty years residence," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"About the time we were getting used to you Earthmen and your
strange divergences of racial types," Tambard said thoughtfully. "We
were astounded at the types that were coming from Earth to visit
us."</p>

<p>"It would have been comparatively easy then for such a man as Nomo
Kell to have taken up residence and qualified for citizenship. But
perhaps if we get his prints and see where they were issued we may be
able to trace back. Someone must have sponsored him. If we can trace
that person we may get at some solution."</p>

<p>He stood up. "Clinigo," he said, "I think we may be needed more on
our respective planets than here. I, for my part, will repair to Mars
by the <i>Cosmos</i>. I do not want to detail a Guard-ship to take me back.
It may be wanted here yet, And you?"</p>

<p>Clinigo smiled, a little sadly I thought. "Your suggestion is good,"
he said. "I, too, will come on the <i>Cosmos</i>. It is to make Shangun on
its return trip and should get me home without undue delay. But one
thing I would suggest. While the <i>Cosmos</i> is stopping over at Tlanan it
should take on extra armament purely as a precautionary measure."</p>

<p>"I thought," I said, perhaps unwisely, "that it was intended to call
in all spaceships."</p>

<p>"It was," Tambard answered. "But we have reconsidered that since
receiving your report. You have shown us a method of combatting them,
where before we had none. Also we have decided that there is nothing to
be gained by calling all ships in and starting a panic. Still it is for
every captain to say for himself whether he will take the risk."</p>

<p>He turned to Hume. The latter smiled wryly. "You needn't worry about
me," he answered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>The Red Planet</h3>

<p>MARS glowed ahead in the void, and grew rapidly. Those of us to whom
it meant the end of the voyage sighed with relief. What those others
who had yet to make Shangun in Venus thought of matters I cannot say.
Hume himself assured me he was not worrying.</p>

<p>I fancy he had a hope that perhaps, before it was time for him to
resume his voyage, things would have advanced so far that all
commercial vessels would be warned out of space and only the fighting
machines allowed to take off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Cosmos</i> had become to all intents and purposes a
Guard-ship. Tambard and Clinigo with my assistance had taken over
control and one or another of us three was constantly in the
transmission room. Messages were coming over thick and fast, and Harran
was beginning to warm up the ether with his suggestions. If Mercury
were the abode of these intelligences we had encountered, Venus and
Earth, being nearer the Sun, were likely to be attacked in that order.
Mars would come last of the three.</p>

<p>The main Martian space observatory on Chimes, one of the many
asteroids or minor planets in the belt between Mars and Jupiter, had
received orders to concentrate all observations on Pluto, the outermost
of the planets. No reports had yet come in but somehow we all felt that
nothing would be discovered in that direction.</p>

<p>It was the business of the Venusian astronomers to keep Mercury
under observation. Not that we hoped for anything startling or even
decisive. Mercury has always been an elusive planet as far as
observation is concerned; its nearness to the Sun has rendered study of
its surface by telescope a matter of considerable difficulty and no
space-ship captain has yet been found venturesome enough to conduct an
expedition in person.</p>

<p>Our landing at Tlanan took place early in the morning, though
already the heat in the thin Martian atmosphere, thin compared with
Earth, was beginning to be almost overpowering. Yet when all is said
and done it is a dry enough heat, easier to stand than the humidity of
Venus.</p>

<p>To prevent regrettable accidents we were all passed through airlocks
and gradually accustomed to the differences in atmospheric pressure and
it was quite an hour from the time of our landing before we set foot on
Martian soil. Tlanan I had seen many times before and always there is
something new about the city to charm the eye.</p>

<p>Built beside one of the main canals of the planet's system it has
been constructed and toned that it seems part of the landscape, a
landscape that in many ways is reminiscent of Earth scenery in Egypt.
All these Martian cities are what one might call dual-pupose
constructions, for they are built to be comfortable both by night and
by day, very necessary when one consider the great variation of
temperature one encounters there in the Martian equivalent of our
twenty-four hour Earth day.</p>

<p>Ordinarily I would either have remained on the <i>Cosmos</i> during her
stay in port or else have taken quarters at one of the various hostels
run by the Interplanetary Tourist Bureau. I think it was with some idea
now of doing the latter that I gathered up my meager baggage, and was
casting about for transport when Jansca detached herself from the crowd
and came toward me.</p>

<p>"I've been looking for you," she said. "I was afraid you might have
strayed off or done something foolish."</p>

<p>"Foolish?" I echoed with a laugh.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going to stay?" sge queried.</p>

<p>"At one of the hostels," I told her. "My purse won't run to anything
more opulent."</p>

<p>"You utterly irresponsible Earthman!" she cried. "Don't you know t
there is only one place in all of Mars where you can stop?"</p>

<p>"No," I said with a faint touch of alarm. Was this some new
regulation of which I had not heard? "Where, Jansca?"</p>

<p>SHE slipped her arm through mine. "Where but with us?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I should. The trouble"--Her face clouded. "Our
conventions are not yours, I know, Jack," she said slowly, "but if you
wish to give a Sonjhon a deadly insult refuse his offer of
hospitality."</p>

<p>"My dear, I did not mean it that way. But I did not wish to be a
source of trouble and inconvenience to you."</p>

<p>She bent swiftly and brushed my lips with hers. "Your habit of
kissing," she said softly, "is the sweetest thing that Earth has taught
to Mars." She dropped her voice to a whisper and drew closer to me.
"Jack," she said tremulously, "time may be short for us. The sooner we
are mated the longer we will have to ourselves. Father and I have
talked the matter over."</p>

<p>I nodded, my heart too full for words. It was what I wanted most in
life and the one thing I was dubious of suggesting. "That's settled
then," she said firmly and turning, beckoned. For the first time I
noticed that her father had been standing back well out of earshot,
obediently waiting, great man though he was, until his masterful
daughter had said her say and brought me to her way of thinking.</p>

<p>His and Jansca's baggage made a formidable heap beside my puny lot.
I was wondering how we would set about removing it when a robot--or to
give him his Martian name a Toro--appeared. Much of the menial labor on
the planet was done by these mechanical men, though to give them their
due the average Martian was not backward in putting his shoulder to the
wheel when the necessity arises. Dirka spoke into the televox apparatus
situated in the Toro's metal diaphragm, giving him orders that were
picked up by an exceedingly sensitive cell which in some very ingenious
fashion operated the mechanism. The Toro picked up as much of the
baggage as he could conveniently carry in his metal hands, and
unerringly led the through the exit doors of the building to the
duralmac road outside. A small battery car just large enough to hold
the three of us and our luggage was standing outside.</p>

<p>Dirka took the wheel while Jansca nestled in between us and soon we
were speeding along the duralmac track at a pace that well-nigh took my
breath away. In the void, curiously enough, speeds approaching that of
light do not seem to matter. But on the planet's surface a hundred
miles or so an hour seemed perfectly appalling.</p>

<p>The ride lasted only a matter of twenty minutes. We pulled up
outside a pleasant little house, beautifully shaded by dilium trees
with a slope at the rear to the sparkling waters of the Great Canal. A
few launches floated on the canal's smooth surface, pleasure boats, the
only form of water travel that the Martian knows on his own oceanless
world.</p>

<p>Dirka's wife, of course, was no longer living. I would have guessed
that from the first even if I had not been told so by Jansca, for no
Martian of the upper classes ever travels without his family if it can
possibly be avoided. There were only servants in the house, who did the
light work, while the rougher jobs were attended to by the Toros. It
was a Toro who met us at the entrance and brought in our luggage, and
another Toro, of a more highly specialized type, took the car round to
some sort of garage.</p>

<p>JANSCA disappeared as soon as we entered the house with the
intimation that she would see me at nondal, the local equivalent of our
lunch, leaving it to her father to conduct me to my rooms. My
apartments were three in all, a bedroom, a sort of study and sitting
room combined with the walls lined with shelves containing
book-machines, and a private bathroom.</p>

<p>"You may want to bathe after your journey," Dirka remarked as he
showed me the bathroom. "You may use it as much as you wish, you
understand, providing you do not draw the water from the canal. That is
kept solely for culinary purposes."</p>

<p>"Where then," I said, "do you get enough to be so lavish in your
bathrooms?"</p>

<p>"Here," he said, pointing to two cylinders which stood side by side
over the bath. "You will find there all the water you need."</p>

<p>They looked curiously like gas cylinders to me and I bent forward to
look at the wording on the plate of each. It was in Martian characters,
however, which I have never learned to read.</p>

<p>"You do not know our language?" Dirka asked. "No? Well this"--he
pointed to one cylinder--"is hydrogen and that is oxygen. They are
recombined to form water and the process is automatically
regulated."</p>

<p>I enjoyed the bath, the first that I had been able to have since
leaving Earth. The artificial water, however, seemed to lack something
I was used to. Say what we will no synthetic product, no matter how
chemically correct is its method of manufacture, can quite equal the
work of nature.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was a freshening quality in the bath that made me
feel rest was out of the question. For want of something to do I
strolled into the study and sitting room and began to examine the
book-machines.</p>

<p>In reality they were reels of fine wire which when run through a
machine specially made for the purpose told the story with voices
suitable to the characters. One could too if one wished, by pressing a
button on one side of the machine, set a series of synchronized
pictures moving that added to the verisimilitude of the story.</p>

<p>I may be a little old-fashioned in some ways but I have never taken
altogether to the book-machines. A story, after all, is not all
dialogue nor is it all acting and one misses that literary touch that
flares up so often in the old print books.</p>

<p>I was feeling more or less at a loose end and wondering whether I
should light my pipe, when someone knocked on the door. I opened it to
find Jansca waiting there for me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>The Calm Before the Storm</h3>

<p>FOR the moment I fancied she was he bearer of evil tidings but one
look at her smiling face drove the idea from my mind.</p>

<p>"I hope," she said, almost breathlessly, "that you don't mind my
coming see you? You weren't resting?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't," I declared. "I was wondering how I was going to pass the
time."</p>

<p>She entered, shut the door behind her and ran her eye round the
room. "So you've been looking at the book-machines," she said. "You
won't find much there. What a pity you don't know our language."</p>

<p>"I do in a way," I told her. "I can understand what's being said to
me, but read it I cannot. The characters puzzle me."</p>

<p>"Of course." She nodded. "All communications are made in a sort of
common language, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"That's so," I agreed smiling. I had an idea what was coming.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it called?" asked.</p>

<p>"That, Jansca mine, is a secret I cannot tell even you. Some day
soon when you receive your appointment I can make it plain to you--but
not till then."</p>

<p>She looked at me with grave eyes. "I'd be the last to try and
persuade you be false to your bond," she said soberly. "Yet it was not
mere idle curiosity that prompted me. It was the wish to share in all
your knowledge in the hope that I might be able to take some of the
work off your shoulders."</p>

<p>"I know," I said gently. A thought struck me. "Has further word of
any sort come through on the news-machines?"</p>

<p>"None as yet," she said in a strained voice. "But I fear that this
is merely calm before the storm. Our time grows short. We must make the
most of it."</p>

<p>"When...?" I was beginning, then stopped, for I was not quite sure
how phrase my question.</p>

<p>She must have read my thoughts. "When can we be mated?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jansca. The sooner the sweeter to my way of thinking though I
have no wish to rush you."</p>

<p>"Rush me?" She looked prettily puzzled for the moment, then the
meaning of it dawned on her. "You mean hurry me? You could never do
that in this matter-I am too unmaidenly anxious."</p>

<p>I caught her in my arms and drew to me. "I think you are adorable,"
I said. "But you have not answered the question."</p>

<p>"A day then, perhaps two," she said. "My father must be judge of
that and and I would not run counter to his wishes. But no day can be
too soon. Who knows but that the destiny of the Universe may be knit up
with the course of our love? You and I together can work miracles."</p>

<p>"It is questionable," I said grimly, "whether they are the sort of
miracles that might stem the tide of invasion."</p>

<p>"You do not know," she said softly with a light in her eyes. "My
father...there are things you will be told...I should not tell
you now." She spoke hurriedly, ending incoherently, as though she were
afraid her tongue might betray her into breaking confidences.</p>

<p>Someewhere in the distance a bell tinkled softly, a faint silvery
note that brought us back to the immediate present with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Nondal hour," she exclaimed. "So soon. How time has passed."</p>

<p>She glanced in the mirror, passed herself as presentable, then took
my arm. She drew me down the spacious hall to the room where the meal
was served. Dirka was waiting for us, and his face lit up with smiles
as he saw us coming, our arms linked, our faces afire with
happiness.</p>

<p>The Martian meal lingers in my memory, will linger perhaps long
after most other things have faded. It was the setting and the company
that made it memorable, though the course of it for the greater part
followed the prescribed ritural. Our conversation came round by
insensible degrees to the matter uppermost in the minds of us all, the
possibility of invasion. A little to my surprise Dirka was not inclined
to scout the idea. He merely remarked that it had happened and would
doubtless happen again but that he knew of no recorded case where the
invaders, even with superior science at their disposal, had managed to
establish themselves for any length of time in the conquered
country.</p>

<p>"What planet are you talking about?" I queried.</p>

<p>"All of them, I suppose I had better say," he answered with a smile,
"but of Venus I cannot be sure. Both Mars and Earth have had their
visitations."</p>

<p>"From what planets?" I asked with interest.</p>

<p>HE shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows?" he said. "The very fact of
these invasions is buried under the litter of history."</p>

<p>"But," I persisted, "if you know so little of that side of it how
can you be sure that actually there have been invasions?"</p>

<p>"Legend, folk-lore, even fairy tales." He met my eyes with a smile
in his. "Your own Earth legends are full of such things. That has been
my hobby these many years, the interpretations of many of your various
races' so-called myths in the light of this theory. I can give you two
instances at least."</p>

<p>"What are they?" I begged.</p>

<p>"You have a country on your Earth in the continent called Asia, a
land sometimes referred to as the Celestial Empire though it has been a
republic for over a hundred of your years."</p>

<p>"China," I said. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Did not their old Emperors call themselves the Sons of Heaven? That
may or may not be of value in the last analysis. But the legends of
that land are full of tales of dragons, monstrous flying things,
breathing fire and smoke and pouring destruction on the country."</p>

<p>"The myths of all our countries have references to them," I pointed
out.</p>

<p>"I should be surprised if they had not," he answered. "What could
they be but space-ships?"</p>

<p>"Admitting that, what became of the invaders?"</p>

<p>"Any of a hundred things. Some of them may even have survived, have
married into an alien tribe and carried on some of their culture and
attainments. Your histories are full of stories of races that have
little in common with their neighbors, that still preserve strange
rites and ancient customs, that seem at times to have lost a culture
that was once theirs."</p>

<p>I thought of the Basques, of the pre-Christian civilization in
Ireland, of isolated cultures scattered throughout ancient America. I
had to admit that what he said was quite feasible.</p>

<p>"Again," he went on, "scarcely a nation, scarcely a race in your
planet but has mixed up in its folk-lore strange tales of bright lights
in the sky, of visitations impossible to explain by the ordinary laws
of Nature as known to these peoples."</p>

<p>"So much for Earth," I said. "And Mars?"</p>

<p>"Our recorded history goes further back than yours but we have only
legends. But it is odd that so many of our legends should agree with
yours as though they had a common origin."</p>

<p>It was a fascinating subject. As a matter of pure speculation we
could have talked about it all day. But there was another matter, one
closer to our hearts, that Jansca and I wished her father to discuss
with us.</p>

<p>"We would with your permission be mated before we go," said Jansca
demurely. "And, father mine, it is well to bear in mind that the call
may come any day at any hour of the day."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," he said. "I see no ground for delay, since
delay would bring happiness to no one. The hour is yours to
choose."</p>

<p>She rose from her seat, came to her father, put her arm about his
neck and kissed him passionately. He looked startled for the moment,
then smiled.</p>

<p>"An Earth custom," he said softly, "but a pleasing one."</p>

<p>We might have said more but almost at that moment, while we were
still feeling our way through a rather awkward pause, the communicator
wailed. Dirka took up the audiophones and clapped them to his ears, for
this was a private set, where converstion and reply could both be kept
secret if need be. He listened in silence for a moment before turned to
us with consternation on his face. "It is Tambard," he said oddly. "He
wishes to come right over as he has a matter of extreme urgency to
discuss."</p>

<p>"We are at his absolute disposal," I said with a queer tightening of
the heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>The Storm Breaks</h3>

<p>FIVE minutes later Tambard arrived. I was surprised at the change in
him. He had seemed sprightly when I parted from him some hours before.
Now he looked as though he had spent a sleepless night and a day of
care and worry to follow. He took the seat to which Dirka invited him,
but declined all offer of food or drink.</p>

<p>"All communication with Venus ceased two hours ago," he said
deliberately. Out of courtesy to me, it may be recorded, he used
Earth-terms whenever possible right throughout our conversation. "We
have been unable to get a message through, and none of the regular
calls from there have reached us. I have been in touch with Harran.
Some of the Earth stations report having received weak
signals--something about 'attack' and 'invasion' and that was all."</p>

<p>We looked at each other as he ended, seeing the thing we had dreaded
coming to pass.</p>

<p>"But that," Tambard went on, "is not all. I wish it were. Harran and
I from our respective planets called up our outermost Guard-ships,
where they junction with the Venusian lines. They were not
acknowledged. There was a silence lasting half an hour. Then came a
reply, not from the flagship but from a smaller scout on the edge of
the fleet. It ran, 'Can transmit but cannot revceive messages.
Receiving apparrently hopelessly damaged in fight. Invisible foe
suddenly descending, wiped out combined Guard-ship fleets before attack
could be resisted. <i>M. Ten</i>, sole survivor, transmitting and heading
for Gaudien at velocity.'"</p>

<p>Tambard paused and again his eyes swept our little circle. "No
further details have come through. If <i>M. Ten</i> does not reach Gaudien
soon we can only conclude that there has been no survivor at all."</p>

<p>"Then," said Dirka, "what is there to be done?"</p>

<p>"Dirka, it is you, through your daughter and her mate here, who may
yet save us. We want water, canal water, as much as we can get even if
all Mars has go on thirst rations."</p>

<p>"We'll have to live on the synthetic product if it is necessary to
save the planets," Dirka said oddly. "What is it? Atomic power, that
what you want?"</p>

<p>Tambard nodded. I was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Am I supposed to know?" I asked. "Because if I am to handle this
matter I think I should know."</p>

<p>Tambard told me. "We have perfected an atomic weapon--a
disintegrating ray obtained by breaking up the atomic structure of
water. We hoped we would never have to use it and we kept the knowledge
secret. Now we find we have made little preparation. Dirka, write me an
order to pump your canals dry if need be."</p>

<p>Without hesitation the other drew a pad from the pocket of his tunic
and in crabbed Martian characters wrote the necessary permission. He
handed it to Tambard with a wry face. "It may well be Mars' death
warrant," he said queerly.</p>

<p>"Without it we face certain annihilation," Tambard pointed out.
"Now"--he turned to me--"I would discuss the rest with you."</p>

<p>Dirka made an abrupt movement. "I shall leave you," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"Do nothing of the sort," Tambard insisted. "What we have to say
concerns you. I want this young man's help--Mars needs him badly--and a
man with divided mind is of no use to anyone. He cannot leave Jansca
behind since his thoughts would be on her, not on what he had to face,
and he cannot take her even as his second in command unless they are
mated."</p>

<p>"I see. So the sooner they are mated the better then," Dirka
remarked. He spoke quite easily, calmly, without the slightest trace of
hesitation.</p>

<p>BUT I think Dirka realized the need was desperate. No doubt, too, he
knew his daughter well enough to rely on her judgment.</p>

<p>"Good," said Tambard. "We will attend to the details of that in a
little moment then. Meanwhile other matters await our attention."</p>

<p>"Before we get to the point of making suggestions," I answered, "I'd
like to have some idea of what I am to command."</p>

<p>"The newest, swiftest spaceship we can find for you," he said with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"If it narrows down to a question of speed and novelty," I remarked,
"there's nothing in the known Universe to beat the <i>Cosmos</i>.
Unfortunately she's a liner."</p>

<p>"Embodying all the latest improvements and built with a purpose,"
said Tambard. "As you doubtless know this is her trial trip and later
she was to be put on an outer planetary schedule. She is the last word
in space-ships. If you're satisfied with her, we'll commandeer
her."</p>

<p>"Then the <i>Cosmos</i> let it be," I agreed. "Now, what surprises have
we in store?"</p>

<p>"In the way of armament? Beyond this atomic weapon none--and even
with that I should imagine you'll find it rather difficult fighting an
invisible enemy."</p>

<p>"Not altogether invisible," I corrected. "The locators will enable
us to spot them and then, of course, the ray tubes..."</p>

<p>Tambard brought his hand down on the table with a thump.</p>

<p>"The ray, of course!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It was that which made them visible. We can rig up projectors--no
need to make them lethal--that will nullify the greatest advantage they
so far possess over us."</p>

<p>"Can they be rigged in time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in ample time. Anything more you'd like to suggest?"</p>

<p>"Several things," I said. "Can these projectors be rigged to give
higher vibratory rate than is necessary to counteract these
invisibility waves?"</p>

<p>"It should not be impossible," said Tambard. He made a note on a pad
beside him. "What else?"</p>

<p>"A question of diplomacy," I said smiling. "I'll have to have a crew
of Martians because Oxcta will play an important part in the campaign.
I wonder if there will be any friction due to an Earthman being in
command."</p>

<p>"No, there will be no difficulty over that, particularly since you
will have a Martian mate. Your crew will all be picked men."</p>

<p>"Can I make one suggestion then? There's one man of the present
complement I'd sooner have with me as navigator than any other. That's
Hume, her present commander."</p>

<p>Tambard nodded. "It can be arranged," he said affably.</p>

<p>He rose to go. "Dirka," he said, "walk a little way with me to the
door. I would discuss these young people and how best to help them in
the short time at their disposal."</p>

<p>Together they went out, leaving us to ourselves and our troubled
thoughts. I looked moodily across the table to my love. "Jansca," I
said, "there is yet time if you wish to change your mind."</p>

<p>A look of blank horror showed in her eyes, then she got up and came
round to me. "Is it," she asked with a quaver in her voice, "that you
no longer love me?"</p>

<p>"I say it, Jansca," I said unsteadily, "however much it hurts me,
because I love you now more than ever."</p>

<p>"That," she said softly, "is all the answer I require."</p>

<p>I made the only reply possible in such circumstances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>The Extra Passengers</h3>

<p>OUR mating took place in the late afternoon of that same day. The
ceremony was a quiet one, attended only by Dirka, Tambard himself and
two official witnesses--one of each sex--though it followed the strict
Martian ritual which had not been varied by word or phrase for
centuries. We were then free to go about our own affairs until the
<i>Cosmos</i> was ready for us.</p>

<p>The call came the next day. We loaded what little baggage we were
taking into the back of the car and, with Dirka accompanying us, set
out along the duralmac road to headquarters.</p>

<p>Tambard, Clinigo and a man I did not know were standing by the
entrance to the covered gangway that led to <i>Cosmos</i>' main deck. As
they saw us the Martian chief started forward. Clinigo, I noticed, hung
back.</p>

<p>Hume was waiting for us on the control-deck, his face a trifle paler
than usual. "So it has come to this, Jack?" he murmured as we met.
"Well, in a way I'm not sorry. I'll do what you want."</p>

<p>He stepped back as Tambard wished to speak to me.</p>

<p>"I've nothing much to add," the Martian said slowly. "You'll head
for Gaudien first. They haven't all the necessary apparatus there but
you may a few ships ready to accompany you. Take good care of your
passengers."</p>

<p>"Passengers?" I echoed in surp "This is no pleasure trip."</p>

<p>"So I told them," said Tambard, "they do not agree. Clinigo--"</p>

<p>I interrupted him, swinging on Venusian. "You mean you're coming
with us, sir?" I said.</p>

<p>He nodded. "What else is left for me to do? My planet is in greater
danger than either Earth or Mars. You and stand"--his eyes met mine
levelly--"I sail with you under your orders."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said, "and it is well. But the other
passenger?"</p>

<p>Tambard motioned the other man forward-"This," he said to me, "is
Arenack-Perhaps you may find a use for him."</p>

<p>I looked Arenack over with interest. Of course I had heard of
him--who had not? A scientist of no mean attainments, I had heard his
name in connection with the atomic structure.</p>

<p>I took a liking to Arenack from the first. His mother, born on Mars,
had been the child of a Martian man and a Venusian woman. His father
had been a native of Earth. An odd mixture of races, yet one that gave
him a peculiar genius. Tambard had little more to say. The Martian
shook hands all round, leaving me to the last.</p>

<p>"Go," he said, as he bade me farewell, "go, and the good wishes of
the planet go with you. Jansca, bring him back safe and sound."</p>

<p>"Or I do not come myself," she said with dignity. "That, you know,
Tambard."</p>

<p>ANOTHER moment and the shore-party took its leave, and went off down
the gangway.</p>

<p>Once out in space and heading for Gaudien, I could take things
easier and hand over to Hume. The first thing I did, however, was to
call Jansca down from her observation post and in her company make a
complete tour of the ship, for I wished to familiarize myself with all
the alterations that had been made overnight.</p>

<p>Arenack, however, knew all there was to be known about them and he
would see that his helpers were well enough acquainted with the use of
each piece of machinery to be able to give a good account of
themselves. He showed me an intricate piece of mechanism that he told
me was the disintegrating ray. It consisted of a long tube with a
smaller tube on top of it. The small tube was made of some iridescent
substance that led down to a generating apparatus underneath the gun,
for such the whole thing actually was.</p>

<p>The larger tube ran back to a huge box-shaped arrangement that was
connected to pipes leading from the water tanks. As I understood his
explanation of the process a fine stream of water was shot out from the
larger tube and at the same time the ray was projected from the smaller
tube.</p>

<p>The angles had been so calculated that ray and water jet gradually
converged, meeting at a spot twenty-five yards ahead of the point of
issue. The ray, acting on the stream of water, broke up its atomic
structure and formed another ray of incalculable power that hurled
itself with irresistible force against anything in its path. The radius
beyond which the ray ceased to be effective had never actually been
defined.</p>

<p>I talked loosely about our prospective opponents' production of a
temperature of absolute zero until Arenack corrected me. The production
of absolute zero, he informed me gravely, would have resulted in some
sort of transmutation of metals. In otner words every scrap of iron and
steel that encountered the source of this temperature--or lack of
it--would be turned into neutronium, an element with the astounding
weight of sixty million tons to the cubic inch.</p>

<p>"But after all," I said, "that's only a theoretical condition.
There's, no such element known in the whole of the Universe."</p>

<p>"Isn't there?" said Arenack sharply. "If you get in the neighborhood
of Sirius you'll probably learn far more about neutronium than you care
to know."</p>

<p>I LEFT it at that. As we went out Jansca dropped a swift remark to
the man that I did not catch. He nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>"What was it you said to Arenack," I said as we went along, "that
made him of a sudden so human?"</p>

<p>Jansca glanced at me roguishly. "Merely making a suggestion that was
after his own heart," she said. And not all the coaxing in the worlds
could induce her to say more.</p>

<p>Messages kept coming and going all the time but no further
development seemingly had taken place. Venus was still isolated from
its companion-worlds as far as communication was concerned and the
missing Guard-fleet had been given up as a total loss.</p>

<p>Jansca made a curious request of me during a lull in the messages
that up till then had been streaming ceaselessly through the void.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "do you mind if I send a private code message
to Tambard?"</p>

<p>I hesitated. "You should have no secrets from your husband," I said
reprovingly.</p>

<p>"It is no secret," she smiled. "I have an idea that may or may not
work. Until I am sure it functions I would rather say nothing about
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," I said, "I suppose I'll have to let you have your
way."</p>

<p>She sent the message herself. Within ten minutes an answer came
back. She took that herself too and, judging from her smiling face, it
was evidently the answer for which she wished.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me yet?" I asked.</p>

<p>She handed me the reply form on which she had scribbled the answer.
It ran, You have my permission to proceed. Tambard.</p>

<p>"That," I said with chagrin, "tells me precisely nothing."</p>

<p>"You shall know by the time we reach Gaudien."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>Between Worlds</h3>

<p>BUT I did not learn the details of Jansca's plan before we reached
the Gaudien base. Something must have gone wrong with it for whenever I
twitted her about the matter she became very glum and avoided giving me
a direct answer.</p>

<p>The glare of the artificial suns from the base picked us up a
thousand miles out. We clicked onto the directional beam and headed for
the Earthward side. This, we learned on contact, was where the
Guard-ship fleet was being gathered. Work there had been speeded up and
I was agreeably surprised to find that half a dozen ships were ready to
proceed with us. Others would follow later. Harran had not been idle
either. London and New York were mustering a fleet, which was planned
to make junction with us somewhere in mid-space.</p>

<p>The Gaudien people had fixed up a fast flyer with the latest thing
in locators, put in special power communicator apparatus and sent it
off into the void in the direction from which our last warning had
come.</p>

<p>Her commander had orders not to attempt to engage in combat even
though it were forced on him--but to turn tail and run away. It was his
job to make contact of some sort with the invading vessels and to give
the position on a general call.</p>

<p>In space it is difficult to plot an exact position--but the Martian
officials at Gaudien had seen this and provided for it. The flyer was
to accelerate to peak at progressive rates of speed and her course
would be plotted hourly as her reports came in.</p>

<p>The moment she made contact and transmitted the news the Gaudien
officials would be able to plot reliably the exact spot in the void
where she had encountered the invaders.</p>

<p>Had I known before that such a ship was being hurled into space as a
bait' and possibly as a sacrifice I do not think I would have
countenanced the proceeding. However, when I heard of it it was too
late to do anything.</p>

<p>I got her angle of flight, took a copy of the chart that showed her
calculated' position and, seeing half a dozen supporting ships already
awaiting my orders, decided to take off after her.</p>

<p>The third day out a faint message trickled through to us. The <i>M.
Two</i> had run into a nest of the invaders. So terrific was her speed
that she had shot past them before they could recover from the surprise
of her advent. Apparently they had been lounging along with their
invisibility apparatus at rest but the moment they mutually located
each other the enemy ships disappeared. They immediately put up a power
barrage that gradually overcame the strength of our craft's signals. I
was stretching out my hand with the idea of operating the call once
more when Jansca caught me by the wrist.</p>

<p>"You mustn't," she said fiercely. "Do you want them to get our
position?"</p>

<p>"They'll locate us quickly enough," I said wearily.</p>

<p>"I think not," she said steadily.</p>

<p>Something in her eyes made me look at her a second time.</p>

<p>"Is this the secret then?" I asked. "Part of it, lover, part of
it."</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said quickly.</p>

<p>"Instead of utilizing the projectors neutralizing rays we have
turned their strength to making the <i>Cosmos</i> invisible."</p>

<p>"Very nice," I commented, "but if they are invisible too how much
better are we?"</p>

<p>"None." she said, "if they should be invisbisle. But they won't be.
We have provided for that but I think I should prefer to keep that a
secret a little longer."</p>

<p>"They'll surely have locators," I objected.</p>

<p>"Certainly. But you are forgetting repeller rays. We are
strengthening them to make the locator vibrations ineffective."</p>

<p>"Can it be done?" I said dubiously.</p>

<p>"Arenack says so. A better answer is he has done it."</p>

<p>"A rather marvelous man, this Arenack," I said with a touch of
bitterness.</p>

<p>A gong clanged in the control room, an urgent signal from Arenack
that something was afoot.</p>

<p>"Hume," I said, "you'll have to take over here. We're wanted in the
projection room. I don't know what it is but you'd better be prepared
to take orders from there."</p>

<p>"Is there any possibility of an engatement?" he queried
anxiously.</p>

<p>Jansca caught me by the arm and smiled at me. Perhaps after all this
was the chance for which she and Arenack had been waiting.</p>

<p>The scientist looked up alertly as we entered the room. He and his
assistants were surrounded by all sorts of spinning and humming
apparatus, machines whose very purpose was beyond me.</p>

<p>"We have something in sight," he snapped. "I don't know what it is
but I'd suggest spacesuits be kept in readiness to don at a moment's
notice."</p>

<p>"They're kept in readiness night and day," I told him. "What is it
you've sighted?"</p>

<p>He pointed to an ordinary view tube connected with the ship's eye. I
bent down and looked at the vision plate on which the picture was
reflected. At first I thought I could see nothing but the blackness of
space with the constellations gleaming brightly against it.</p>

<p>Then abruptly one constellation was momentarily obscured as though
something opaque had passed between it and me. Had I not been on the
alert for some such thing I would most certainly have missed it. Jansca
was staring over my shoulder. She gave an exclamation as the opacity
moved across the stars, blotted out their light, passed and merged into
the obscurity of space.</p>

<p>"You saw it?" said Arenack. "Or rather you saw its effect. An
artificial eclipse, so to speak."</p>

<p>"But how could that happen?" I queried. "I thought the
thing--space-ship, I suppose it is--was invisible."</p>

<p>"Invisible, not transparent. Also you're not seeing the actual thing
itself with your own two eyes. In other words you lose the stereoscopic
effect."</p>

<p>I NODDED. There was one big objection however and I voiced it. "It's
rather risky relying on anything like that," I said. "Only sheer luck
enabled us to pick up that object the way we did. Double luck, yours
and mine."</p>

<p>"No, I picked it up with a more reliable apparatus. Come here."</p>

<p>He moved from his seat, motioning me to take his place. In front of
where he had been sitting, at eye level, was something like a pair of
elongated binoculars. They had a hood arrangement that fitted like a
mask to one's face.</p>

<p>Arenack leaned over me and adjusted it. Some automatic mechanism, I
learned later, on the lines of the clockwork that moves telescopes in
the observatories, kept it constantly on the object to be viewed.</p>

<p>I stared ahead, blinked and then I saw. It was a space-ship modeled
on the lines of the craft Jansca and I had been instrumental in
destroying not so long before. Only it did not seem so large.</p>

<p>"You saw it then?" said Arenack at my gasp of surprise. "One moment,
please."</p>

<p>He made some minor adjustments. The space-ship seemed to leap toward
me; its walls shimmered and vanished, and it was as though I were
looking through glass into its interior. Everything, however, was on a
reduced scale, and I could see nothing with any clearness of detail.
Machinery, men--pigmy figures--dressed oddly. That was about all I
could make out.</p>

<p>I slipped the hood from my face. "That's it then, is it?" I said
with amazement at the miracle I had witnessed.</p>

<p>"It's too far away yet for us to see details, of course," Arenack
said, "but you see we've a means to overcome their invisibility."</p>

<p>"But how?" I queried.</p>

<p>"The--" He said something that sounded like "dalifon"--but before I
could ask him what that meant Jansca interposed.</p>

<p>"What you call the Crystal Eye," she explained. "We may be able to
make further improvements."</p>

<p>"If we have the time and opportunity," Arenak said softly. "That
fellow is cutting across our line now but at any moment he may change
direction and veer toward us. Perhaps they have some mechanism for
detecting our presence, even though we happen to be invisible."</p>

<p>I realized that. But I fancied I saw one defect in the apparatus of
detection.</p>

<p>"This is good," I said, "excellent in fact, but does it not mean
that you must keep someone with eyes constantly glued to the peep-holes
here?"</p>

<p>Smilingly Arenack shook his head, "Not necessary," he told me. He
gestured toward a white plaque on the wall in a direct line with the
Crystal Eye. He touched a button on the desk beside him and as I
watched the milky surface of the plaque changed. It went black--the
stars came out on it and the tiny silver ship showed up quite
clearly.</p>

<p>As we stared its appearance changed. From a cigar shape it altered
to a disk, then abruptly with a great leap the disk increased in size.
Arenack exclaimed. Jansca caught at my arm.</p>

<p>"It's changed direction," she cried. "It's coming toward us now and
it's moving at a terrific rate."</p>

<p>"Do you think they've managed to locate us somehow?" I asked Arenack
quickly.</p>

<p>"Impossible to say," he answered "Try altering our course."</p>

<p>I got Hume on the open communicator. "Three points west of our
present direction." I told him. "Hold her there for fifteen
minutes."</p>

<p>Again we turned our eyes toward the plaques. The angle of the
space-ship seemed to have altered slightly. It was no longer a disk,
rather an ellipse. But even as we watched with bated breath it slowly
swung back again into its former position.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it now. She was aware of our presence in
space.</p>

<p>"Action stations," I ordered. "Space-suit rig and Oxcta solution for
every man."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>At Grips</h3>

<p>OUR own space-suits were kept readiness in the projecting room and
beside them a ready solution of Oxcta put up in tiny phials. We broke
ours, drank the highly concentrated contents and proceeded to don the
suits.</p>

<p>On the belt of each suit hung a reaction pistol, a thing with a vast
mouth like an old blunderbuss. Should the worst, the ship be destroyed
and ourselves projected into the void, we possessed at least a fighting
chance for life. The reaction pistols furnished a means of propulsion
through space. A man might live in such a suit, moving about space, for
a matter of two or three days. The suits had originally been designed
to preserve the lives of passengers wrecked in space. No one had ever
thought of the possibility of their being used to save survivors from a
ship stricken in war far off the beaten track, war we fancied had long
been banished from the planets.</p>

<p>The remaining ships of the fleet were a couple of thousand miles to
the rear and so safe for the time being. Their locators would no doubt
have warned them of our altered course and in due time the same means
would give them notice of the presence of a stranger ship.</p>

<p>But since we had been discovered I did not think it wise to
communicate with them. Their rate of progress would soon bring them
close enough to distinguish the stranger, as she would become visible
as soon as our neutralizing rays played on her.</p>

<p>I swung over the little lever that set the power going. For a space
nothing happened. Then suddenly against the background of the void
there leaped to life a lovely golden shape, the spaceship sheering
around to veer in at us.</p>

<p>It looked as though her intentions were purely exploratory. An idea
struck me. It was not altogether impossible they might have mistaken us
for one of their own craft.</p>

<p>I was just about to put the idea to when a call came through from
the transmitting room. It was the duty operator speaking.</p>

<p>"A series of strange signals coming through for some minutes," he
informed me.</p>

<p>"How's the recorder transcribing them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"As a series of impulses," the operator told me. "They're coming
over with irregular frequency and the recorder is putting them down as
lines and dots. If it wasn't that it's never been used nowadays I'd
think it was someone trying to transmit in archaic Morse code."</p>

<p>"Morse?" I ejaculated. "Do you happen to know anything about
that?"</p>

<p>The operator chuckled. "Not much. But enough to say that this isn't
Morse. Here, sir, something's coming through again. I've got a group
combination that came several times before. It looks like a <i>message
begins</i> sign. It's clattering."</p>

<p>"Throw your communicator open so I can hear what's going on," I
commanded.</p>

<p>The screen immediately lit up, showing me the interior of the
transmitting room and the sounds of the instruments working came
plainly to my ears.</p>

<p>I listened to the clack of the machine as it worked. It was going at
a fearful rate, a sort of urgent click-click-click, then a long click
and so on. Something in the pace at which the signals came over made me
think that the operator at the other end was fast losing patience.</p>

<p>"Now he's getting angry," I commented.</p>

<p>THE clicks came with a sharp rattle, a perfect hailstorm of them.
There was a pause, possibly while the operator waited for a reply. Then
when none came our machine began to clatter again over an octave and
ended on a final note that expanded into one sharp explosion. Anger,
irritation, finally utter disgust. Though I waited a full minute
nothing more came through.</p>

<p>"Good," I said to the operator, "you can cut out the general circuit
now. But keep those records. We may try our hands at deciphering
them."</p>

<p>I cut out and spoke to Jansca. "How's that stranger ship been
behaving while I've been at the communicator?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Maintaining distance," she said. I told her something of what I had
seen and heard.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "doubtful of us then. Perhaps that's a good sign. I
wonder what Arenack thinks of it."</p>

<p>"Thinks of what?" he said, looking up from his work on the
projector. I told him.</p>

<p>"That's it then," he said. "They're trying to speak us and have lost
patience because we haven't answered. That means they don't know our
ships have discovered an invisibility process. When they find out..."
He finished the sentence with a soft whistle.</p>

<p>I looked toward the plaque where he had pointed. The golden shape
was moving again. The distance between us was lessening rapidly.</p>

<p>"It's coming," said Arenack, stretching his hands toward the nearest
tube.</p>

<p>"No--not yet!" I cried. "The ray projector. You've taken the kick
out of it and are merely using its vibratory scale?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," he said calmly. "What I'm doing is using a wave with a
lesser number of vibrations. If I quicken up the vibrations I can send
the ray over again."</p>

<p>I nodded. "I don't want to destroy that craft utterly. But something
has to be done. Heat him up a bit, will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll try. Stand aside, all of you. There may be a flashback when I
change over."</p>

<p>Over the flexible metal fingers that covered his own flesh and blood
ones he drew thick yet pliable rubber gloves, flung a glance at the
plaque before him, adjusted a vernier scale screw on the edge of the
tube and pulled a lever. We watched the growing bulk of the spaceship
as it showed in the plaque. For a minute or so nothing happened. Then
the golden shape seemed to dull a little. It shone out again, gleaming
rather brighter than before.</p>

<p>A little later it began to glow. From gold it passed to a deeper
orange and gradually a faint tinge of red crept over it.</p>

<p>"Better hold it at that, Arenack," I said warningly. "You've got the
outer shell red hot. I don't want to roast them. I'd rather get them to
surrender if I can."</p>

<p>"I'll notch it a shade higher," he said "That heat will radiate off
quickly in space. Unless, of course," he added "they've got something
to counteract."</p>

<p>I didn't think they had. I could have sworn we had them helpless, we
held them so long. I was even beginning to think there was a chance of
capturing the ship intact when the thing itself happened.</p>

<p>The red-hot shell of a sudden began to lose its color. It wavered
fitfully back to orange but somehow Arenack managed to hold it at that,
though I saw out of the corner of my eye that he had to apply an extra
notch or so to do it. One force, it seemed, was struggling again the
other, neither strong enough to win. They were locking in neutral.</p>

<p>I have never made a bigger mistake.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the orange dimmed down. I don't quite know what happened
next. To this day I am not quite sure. Jansca, however--perhaps
fancifully--says it looked as though someone had rolled up the edges of
space and hurled it like a ball into nothingness between us.</p>

<p>BUT what I do know was what ha pened in the projection room. There
came a vivid sheet of blue light. The room seemed to grow chokingly
cold as though one were breathing--or trying to breathe--liquid air. I
can give no better description of it than that Arenack made an abrupt
movement an a startled oath fell from his lips. With his gloved hand he
dragged over the kever that cut off the power.</p>

<p>The air of the room cleared on the instant. The blue light vanished
and I became aware of Arenack crouching ove rthe machine as though he
had been struck and thrown there. I caught him by the shoulaer and at
my touch he slipped to his knees.</p>

<p>"Jansca," I called and between the two of us we raised him to his
feet. His assistants came to our aid. He opened his eyes, blinked,
pushed the visor of helmet farther back from his face.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now," he said. "That was a near thing, though. If I
hadn't cut off power when I did...I thought for the moment we were
gone."</p>

<p>"So did I," I said grimly. "Have you any idea what happened?"</p>

<p>"A glimmer," he said. "They've got somethig to beat our heat
ray--some repelling force. But the nerve of it! They used our ray as a
path for it, hurled itt back on itself and into the machine I hadn't
been wearing insulating gloves I wouldn't have been able to pull the
lever over and if I hadn't pulled the lever over--the stars confound
them!--we'd have gone out in a blue flare."</p>

<p>Arenack jerked himself to his feet. "Can't afford to take our senses
off the job for a moment," he said warningly. "That craft's notched the
first score. Thinking he's taught us a lesson he may try to push it
home. If he has any more samples of that sort we'll be lucky to get out
of it with our lives."</p>

<p>"If it's a case of lives ours mustn't be lost," Jansca declared. "If
we go the barriers are down and there'll be none to hold them." She
turned to Arenack. "That's your work, my friend," she said steadily.
"Keep us alive no matter who is destroyed. The <i>Cosmos</i> must come
through."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, Jansca," he said. "If the chief gives me a free
hand I'll clean up the void."</p>

<p>"You can have that free hand," I said. "Ah, he's swinging
again."</p>

<p>The gleaming space-ship had indeed swing around. It was rising at an
angle too. I caught a glimpse of the underside of the ship and at once
the meaning of the maneuver came to me.</p>

<p>"He's trying to get above us," I cried. "We mustn't let that
happen."</p>

<p>I spang to the control communicator, and snapped quick orders. We
could hardly rise on the course we were taking. The only thing left to
do with any hope of success was to make the nearest thing possible to a
right-angle turn and rise from that.</p>

<p>The abrupt veering of the ship threw us off balance and flung us
against each other, the contact of our space-suits filling the room
with clatter.</p>

<p>The instant we recovered ourselves I swung my eyes to the plaque on
the wall. We seemed to be now at much the same altitude, circling like
two hawks, each watching the chance to strike.</p>

<p>Then abruptly the stranger veered. A dazzling white glow flickered
about her nose and I waited for what terrible thing I knew not. But
nothing happened to us. Why, I saw in the very next instant.</p>

<p>One of our half dozen supporting ships must have blundered somehow
into our orbit and been located by the stranger. The white glow
flickered about her nose. It spread, taking on her outlines. Then the
ship dissolved into a myriad of fragments that went floating and
drifting away.</p>

<p>"The atomic gun, Arenack," I said grimly.</p>

<p>I do not think the stranger ship's people could have known what
struck them. One instant they were there, the next they had been
exploded into ultimate nothingness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>The Vandals of the Void</h3>

<p>MY next act was to call the transmission room to get in touch with
the fleet and presently the heartening news came back that only the
ship we had seen destroyed had met with disaster.</p>

<p>From now on, however, it behooved us to go warily. The most
irritating feature of our two encounters was their utter
conclusiveness. Because of that we were no nearer to learning the
things we wished to know.</p>

<p>After the strenuous time of the last hour or so we were all more or
less exhausted--so I sent Arenack off to rest and told Jansca I thought
she had better turn in.</p>

<p>She asked me what I intended doing and when she found I meant to
relieve Hume at control she said, "I think it's you who need a rest
more than any of us."</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Jansca," I said wearily for I had no mind to
argue. "Actually I've done no more than stand by and watch while you
and Arenack and his assistants did the work."</p>

<p>"Yours was the harder part then," she said. "We had our work to keep
us occupied. You, with your responsibilities--"</p>

<p>"Enough," I said sharply. "Jansca, you've just reminded me that I'm
in command. Carry out orders, please."</p>

<p>She made a wry face but she went.</p>

<p>I took over from Hume. Though he said nothing I thought from the
look of him that he was glad to be relieved. He had got the <i>Cosmos</i>
back on her original course, so I gave the control into the hands of
the Martian second officer with orders to hold her and turned to the
work of plotting our further direction.</p>

<p>The chart on which our evolutions had been automatically recorded
was a mass of amazingly intricate geometrical figures, the mere sight
of which set my brain in a whirl, but the work had to be done and I set
to it at once.</p>

<p>All the same it was some time before I managed to orient myself.
Then with the planet chart in front of me I ruled the course I wished
to take, plotted the figures and gave the altered direction to the
Martian Second.</p>

<p>"That will take us direct to Venus," he said. "You're heading for
Shangun?"</p>

<p>"I'm asking the company to take no risks that I don't take myself,"
I said steadily for I understood only too well what was passing through
his mind. "If we have to make a sacrifice of ourselves it can't be
helped."</p>

<p>"I know that," he said. He turned to put my instructions into
operation but he left me thoughtful.</p>

<p>Clinigo came in a moment later, an angry little man. He had been
resting when the trouble began and had awakened to find himself
virtually a prisoner in his own part of the ship, one where I believed
he was least likely to come to harm.</p>

<p>He stood and eyed me for a moment, his whole body quivering.</p>

<p>"It was you," he said with an harsh note in his voice, "who
orderered that I be kept to the rear of the ship."</p>

<p>And when I nodded, "Why was that.</p>

<p>"Because," I said steadily, "you were in what was the safest place.
Even if we were blown up you would have had a fighting chance in your
space-suit."</p>

<p>"By what right did you give such order?" he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"The right I acquired when you and Tambard sent me on this
expedition You may remember you came as a passenger."</p>

<p>He smiled at that, the first faint flicker of a smile I had seen on
his face that day. "Do you think that for one moment I question the
authority delegate to you? I deprecate the policy that considers my
life of such value that special precautions should be taken to pre
serve it."</p>

<p>HE looked then at the space-chat with the red line of our intended
course pointing like a lance at the heart of Venus. "Man!" he said with
a note incredulity in his voice. "Are you actually making for
Venus?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I informed him. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"But it's cut off from the rest of the worlds. The entire planet may
be in the hands of these vandals of the void," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"The more reason for going there," I assured him. "The sooner we
tear the veil away the better."</p>

<p>He looked doubtful. "I suppose you know best," he said at length.
"We're in your hands now. You've pulled through one encounter
successfully, you may do so to the end."</p>

<p>"That's rather optimistic," I smiled. "You heard what happened? It
was science that won the victory, not generalship."</p>

<p>"So I believe. What's your acceleration?"</p>

<p>"I'm increasing velocity up to peak," I told him.</p>

<p>We were already far out in space, far beyond the farthest point our
scouting ships had penetrated when they were silenced, perhaps forever,
by the strange spare-craft.</p>

<p>ONCE again, with Venus far closer, our locators warned us of alien
bodies and I ordered "action stations" at once. The stranger was coming
right for us. He was not traveling invisibly. He was still too far off
for us to see him save as a silver streak, moving athwart the blackness
of space. But even I sensed a certain familiarity.</p>

<p>"Operator," I called through the communicator, "stand by to
transmit."</p>

<p>I heard his startled gasp, gave him a plain call in the
international code. "Leave the general communicator on," I said when he
took it. "I want to see and hear what transpires."</p>

<p>He did so. Back in a very few seconds came a startled, "Who the
planets are you? Where are you anyway?"</p>

<p>"Give them our call signal," I told the operator. "Not our name. Get
his name however."</p>

<p>It was slow work, this questioning and answering in the code. It
always is.</p>

<p>"Got yours," came the answer. "<i>M. Ten</i> here. But where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Throw off the vibrations," I said over my shoulder to Jansca. "It
won't hurt to be visible for a while now."</p>

<p>I could imagine their vision man on the <i>M. Ten</i> blinking as we
suddenly appeared out of nothingness, perhaps gasping with amazement at
the apparent miracle of it. But they wasted no time once they were sure
of us.</p>

<p>"We've escaped," ran their next message. "But we think we're being
pursued."</p>

<p>"Tell them to link up and send a man across," I said to the
operator. "Their commander if he can rely on anyone in his absence. Get
action. We haven't time to spare."</p>

<p>"Coming across at once," I read on the screen two seconds later.
"Stand by to connect."</p>

<p>It was ticklish business, making that connection but it was done in
record time. I went down to the port myself to meet the commander.
Everything went like clockwork. We closed our port, disconnected, and
<i>M. Ten</i> sped off, heading for the Gaudien base and Mars beyond. The
moment she began to move our vibratory apparatus was put to work and we
vanished once more.</p>

<p>"Now," I said to the commander of the <i>M. Ten</i>, Balena by name,
"come to the projection room with me and you can tell your tale there
while we watch. I have an idea our time will be short."</p>

<p>"Why are you making for Venus?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Because," I said, "we want to go there. But let us make the
projection room. There are others who may wish to hear your story and
to whom the knowledge of what you've discovered may be helpful."</p>

<p>I ushered him to the room and made him known to Jansca, Clinigo and
Arenack. He saluted them, then turned to me as his conductor.</p>

<p>"Now," I said. "What has happened to Venus? Why has the planet been
cut out of communication?"</p>

<p>"Because they've got one if not more bases there," he answered, "and
it's only a matter of time--short at that--till they subjugate the
whole planet. Then they'll turn their attention to our worlds."</p>

<p>"You think there is no hope?" said Clinigo brokenly.</p>

<p>The other hesitated. "For Venus?" he asked. Clinigo nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the other, "but I don't see how there can be."</p>

<p>Clinigo turned away. He seemed to be studying the growing image of
Venus reflected on the wall but I think in reality he had turned to
hide his tears. I caught the words, "My poor planet."</p>

<p>He came around suddenly, another Clinigo from the one I had got to
know.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell us," he said in a voice from which all emotion
had been wrung, "as completely as possible everything of importance
that has occurred to you since we lost touch with you?"</p>

<p>Clinigo had forgotten that he was a passenger and remembered only
that he was one of The Three.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>The Evening Star</h3>

<p>IN precise dry formal tones Balena told his story. When the fleet
sent out from Gaudien had been attacked by the invisible force, the <i>M.
Ten</i> had been saved by the fact that, due to the necessity of repairing
a temporary defect in her propulsive machinery, she had lagged
behind.</p>

<p>Her observers had witnessed the disposal, practically en masse, of
the whole Martian fleet. Realizing that there was nothing to be gained
by lingering near the scene of the disaster, the <i>M. Ten</i> turned tail,
transmitting to Gaudien as she went.</p>

<p>Something had gone wrong with the locators and they had no means of
knowing whether the foe was following or not. The receiver apparatus
was damaged and failed to function.</p>

<p>In the midst of transmitting the whole of the ship's company began
to feel a paralyzing cold creeping over them and one by one they
dropped at their posts.</p>

<p>"Why wasn't Oxcta served out to the men?" I broke in to ask. "That
would have saved you all."</p>

<p>But it seemed that when the fleet was being fitted out at Gaudien
Oxcta supplies ran short. The bulk of it was concentrated on the
flagship. But even then, Balena stated, Oxcta hadn't helped. Oxcta
might neutralize the paralyzing cold but it had no effect where the
other weapons of the strangers were concerned.</p>

<p>They came back to consciousness to find themselves prisoners and
their ship in charge of strange beings, taller even than the Martians,
whose most distinctive features were their deep purple eyes and the
ridge of horn on each man's head. They spoke a marvelously simple
language for Balena himself managed to pick it up under instruction in
five days.</p>

<p>My original guess, or rather Parey'sinformation, had been correct.
The strangers came from the planet Merury and were part of an
expedition partly exploratory and partly predatory sent out with the
view of finding a congenial home somewhere among other habitable
planets.</p>

<p>They seemed of a rather high order of intelligence, ruthless in
their ways, yet their civilization had moved lines different from ours.
Apparently they had made a number of discoveries we knew nothing about
while in ways we had the advantage of them. However--they had
established a base on Venus in one of the uninhabited districts and
there they had gradually accumulated a space navy. Venus, it seemed,
suited them as a base but they wanted a world not so cloudy as a place
of permanent settlement.</p>

<p>Apparently they would have been content to keep their presence on
Venus a strict secret had they not somehow discovered that Venus was
one of the constituent bodies in the confederation of three worlds.</p>

<p>How they made this discovery is not quite clear, nor is it clear
what they hoped to gain by holding up and examining the ships of the
interstellar traffic. Once they discovered the worlds were beginning to
wake up to the menace they embodied, the Mercurians threw a
communication barrage around Venus and set to work to trawl space.</p>

<p>Balena and his men identified the place to which they were taken as
being somewhere on the Southern edge of the Venusian tropics, one of
the wastelands of that planet. The heart, from the Martians' point of
view, was very trying. It gave Balena an idea which he gradually
communicated to the crew.</p>

<p>They began dropping one by as though overcome by the excessive
humidity. The Mercurians became reallly alarmed. They took Balena aside
and their leader questioned him closely to the cause of this condition
and any possible method of alleviating it. Balena after some hesitation
admitted they had a preparation on his space-ship that would help to
counteract the trouble.</p>

<p>THE Mercurians sent for it. It was a semi-liquid preparation,
bromine, used extensively to form bromides and bromates and as such the
two cylinders containing it were labeled in Martian characters. Some of
the Mercurians, who had made good progress in Tlananian from the
various textbooks they had take from space-liners they had raided, were
able to read the labels and satisfy themselves that the stuff was quite
safe from their point of view.</p>

<p>Bromine, however, was an entirely new subtance to them and naturally
they were unaware that in its raw state it is capable, if liberated in
sufficient quantities, of causing considerable distress, probably
pneumonia, possibly death to any who comes in contact without taking
reasonable precautions.</p>

<p>Balena, instead of releasing the bromine by means of the graduated
scale of the cylinder, turned it suddenly full on with the nozzle
pointed toward the Merrcurian group, who were standing idly watching
them.</p>

<p>The Mercurians staggered, gulped and were seized with paroxysms of
couhging that rendered them absolutely helpless. At the first sign that
the stuff was taking effect the Martians began to run back to their
space-ship. Balena threw the hissing cylinder into the midst of the
squirming Mercurians, releasing the pressure in the second cylinder and
threw it after its mate.</p>

<p>They reached the space-ship, piled inside, closed the door and
started to ascend just as the first of the Mercurians came running
after them and began to shoot with their rays. It would have gone hard
with the Martians, no doubt, had they had to contend with a guard on
the ship. But although one was kept over it during the night, none was
considered necessary in the day.</p>

<p>Even as it was, however, the first was of the ray tubes came
dangerously close to <i>M. Ten</i>. Also, for some unaccountable reason, the
engines refused to function properly. But by frantic manipulation of
the screens Balena and his men prevented the worst from happening. "And
then, of course, our locators picked us up," I said as he ended. "Well
done, Balena, I'll see you're recommended for this."</p>

<p>"If I might ask, sir," he said, "just what are you proposing to
do?"</p>

<p>"We're running for Venus," I told him. "Rather hard lines on you
since you've just managed to escape from there. But duty is duty."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that aspect of it altogether," he said with a
wry face. "But they must have lifted the barrage temporarily at any
rate. Not so long after we got into free space we heard signals, not
from any of our ships. I think they must have been recalling their
fleet."</p>

<p>There was one other possibility that struck me, though now was not
the time to make it public. It was quite as likely that the Mercurians,
besides signaling their ships back to the Venusian base, had also sent
out a call for help to their own planet.</p>

<p>I got Balena to give us the location of the base and altered our
course to strike Venus in the tropics. I had in mind the desperate
throw of striking at the heart of their power-plant in the hope of
putting it out of action before a fleet that hopelessly outnumbered us
swept down to wipe us out of existence.</p>

<p>All that day the ether was thick with strange signals in a code none
of us knew. Even Balena, with the knowledge he had acquired of the
Mercurian language, was unable to decipher them for us.</p>

<p>The one thing we could do was to locate their point of origin, and
on that I kept the assistant operators working overtime. Some of the
signals were streaming in from Venus and presently we began to catch
other signals in the interplanetary code. The Mercurians had had to
lift the barrage to send their own messages through and the Venusian
authorities were trying frantically to get in touch with the rest of
the Universe.</p>

<p>All the while the blue disk of Venus grew and grew, became silver,
filled out and out until it covered almost the entire vision surface of
the white plaque in the projection room.</p>

<p>As the planet swung nearer Clinigo became more restless than ever.
That calm which should have characterized one of The Three utterly
deserted him.</p>

<p>When we were a hundred and fifty thousand miles above the planet I
called a halt. The time had come to drop down through the floor of
cloud into the atmospheric envelope.</p>

<p>I called Jansca to my side. "Dear," I said, "keep with me. It is
only right to let you know that we may never live to see another
dawn."</p>

<p>Her face paled. I think for the first time she visioned the
possibility of our being disrupted into our original atoms as one
breaks up a mound of dust with a jet from a hose. But worse than the
fear of dissolution in that fashion was the dread of parting. She came
a little closer, caught me by both arms--we were alone for the moment
in the room--and drew me to her.</p>

<p>"If I have to die I shall at least die like one of Sonjhon blood,"
she said tremulously. "But even in death I would not be parted from
you."</p>

<p>I caught her to my heart and kissed her dear lips, then gently
thrust her from me.</p>

<p>My finger wavered over a button on the button-studded plate before
me, then with a sudden resolution I pressed it. I had given the signal
that was to send us dropping through the floor of cloud to whatever
fate awaited us below.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>Armageddon of the Void</h3>

<p>SLOWLY the cloud murk parted, slowly the mist lifted and the land
below stood plainly revealed in the light of the hot-house day. A land
of strange things, strange colors and strange plants--Venus, the planet
I had planned to reach as the last point o pleasure trip.</p>

<p>We were flying invisible, keeping level by rapid and tricky
moduulation of our gravity-plates--some call them screens--for I dared
not use the engines. In atmosphere they made a drone that carries a
surprising distance.</p>

<p>Balena touched my arm. "That," he said, "should be the place but I
don't see any lights, any reflections of any sort."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think we could," I told him. "Probably they've masked
the camp now. They mightn't even care to run the risk of a Venusian
coastwise craft sighting them. They want to be undisturbed until their
armada arrives. However, we've the means to uncover them.</p>

<p>"Arenack"--I turned to him--"any results yet?"</p>

<p>He was trying to focus on the instrument I have called the Crystal
Eye and was finding it difficult, perhaps because of some subtle
difference in the atmosphere of Venus. But as I addressed him he jerked
his finger back over his shoulder, gave an exclamation and went on
twisting screws.</p>

<p>I glanced at the plaque towards which he had pointed. Something
misty showed where a moment before had been nothingingness. I fancied I
saw buildings. I looked again and was sure.</p>

<p>Then abruptly, as Arenack hit the right vibration in the scale, the
scene sprang into light and became plain. I saw buildings--I saw men,
the od figures of the Mercurians--and, rising gigantic over men and
buildings both a mast of some sort that was a spiderweb of metal
traceries. At the very apex something that I would have called mirror
had it not been egg-shaped wobbled and spun, throwing gleams of light
from it as it moved. That it was power-station of some sort I had no
doubt.</p>

<p>I think they must have had some deice that warned them of our
presence, invisible though we were, for I saw some of the figures
abruptly look skyard, and I almost swear--to such a pitch was my
imagination keyed--that I heard them cry out. One look from each them,
the abrupt white patch of an upturned face, then the figures
disappeared inside the building and the egg-shaped mirror on the mast
began to wobble more furiously than ever.</p>

<p>"Arenack, let them have the heat-ray and stand by for the atomic jet
for use at a moment's notice," I ordered.</p>

<p>The words had hardly left my mouth before the long yellow ray jetted
from our bow projector. Some of the buildings glowed in outline for an
instant, then collapsed into their own ashes. But that infernal mirror
still wobbled. The mast itself seemed intact and even as I looked a
plae blue light glowed in its center then uddenly shot out towards us.
Remembering our invisibility I think they must have aimed at random,
for no doubt their locators had been destroyed by our heat ray.
Nevertheless they shot amazingly straight.</p>

<p>The <i>Cosmos</i> staggered, buffeted by a force titanic beyond all
conception, and for an instant I thought she was going to keel
over.</p>

<p>Then I saw through our vision plate one supporting ships glowing
like a blue sun. The vision lasted no longer than one would take to
count five. The ship seemed to lose shape, passed into a molten stream,
a metallic rain that dropped upon the humid soil beneath.</p>

<p>"Give them the atomic gun, Arenack," I snarled.</p>

<p>A HISSING sound as the water leapedout, a trembling as the
disintegrating vibrations rushed to join it in mid-air, then a rushing
stream of fury like the the dust molecules in a beam of sunlight. The
kick of the explosion flung us back, and when we looked again there was
no longer any mast or mirror or that we could identify, only a scorched
and disrupted wilderness, torn, scarred and ripped open by the heel of
the atomic jet.</p>

<p>At the cost of one of our ships we had destroyed the one known base
but now the question arose--were there any others of which we had not
known?</p>

<p>Since we could not scour a planet ourselves I decided the best thing
to do was to head for Shangun and warn the authorities of what to
expect. I gathered that they might not be altogether defenseless and
since I wished to run no unnecessary risks I decided after talking the
matter over with Clinigo and Jansca that we had better start
transmitting so they would know we were coming.</p>

<p>After being so long isolated from the rest of the Universe Shangun
went mad when the communication was restored and the infection no doubt
spread right round the planet. They could not but believe that the
menace had been removed forever. Even the guarded warnings that came
through did little to dampen their wild enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In extenuation it must be remembered that though their planet was
the only one so far invaded none of the Venusians had had any
encounters with the Mercurians. They possessed no firsthand knowledge
of the powers wielded by the aggressors. And the only base so far
located had been established at a point remote from civilization.</p>

<p>Indeed, until the advent of the <i>Cosmos</i> the Venusians themselves
did not know such a base existed.</p>

<p>Yet when we began transmitting, telling in detail the story of our
efforts and how they had culminated, even that was taken as proof that
we had conquered finally.</p>

<p>Otherwise, they reasoned, how was it that we were sailing calmly
towards the capital of the confederation, victorious and unharmed?</p>

<p>Shangun, a city of soft twilight tones, of lights subdued and
eye-entrancing after the glare of the Martian redlands, had for once
outdone itself. It was alive with lights and flags. It was shouting
joyously the incarnate voice of a planet snatched from worse than
death.</p>

<p>The very loveliness of it, the wild abandon of its people, cut me to
the quick. How could we convince them that this was no conclusive
victory, merely a skirmish by the way, with the red, riper scenes of
carnage yet to come?</p>

<p>Clinigo was our last hope. If he could not bring his people to a
realization of what still lay ahead of them no one could. But as I
looked at his face I seemed to read there and in his eyes doubt of his
own ability to do any such thing.</p>

<p>A troubled man was Clinigo that day, torn between love of his planet
and anger at the folly of the people. A pleasant birdlike people, sweet
and charming to know, but broken reeds on which to lean in a
crisis.</p>

<p>We dropped the <i>Cosmos</i> until she floated a hundred feet above the
ground and let her drift gently to the landing slips. I would not let
them close the grips over her hull, however, for I had an ugly
foreboding that the worst had still to come and we might yet have to
rise at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Clinigo descended, leaving the rest of us in the ship. We refused
all invitations to land, although the Venusians clustered round the
departure platforms--they could not come nearer for I would not have
any gangways run out--and cheered us, called to us, chattered, laughed,
threw us flowers and congratulations.</p>

<p>It was as if Fate had thrown the gage and taken up the challenge
without delay. While Clinigo was still wrangling with the local
authorities, trying to convince them of the danger hanging over them
and finding it no easy task--while the laughing, loving people about us
were singing their delight of our presence--things were going on which
were presently to become manifest.</p>

<p>The first intimation came in startling fashion. We had been
transmitting--to where I am not sure--and the televox machines on the
landing stage were shouting some news of the hour when all of a sudden
everything went still and dead. All communication stopped in mid-note
as though temporarily paralyzed. Alarmed, we swung our eyes
skywards.</p>

<p>For a time we could see nothing save our four remaining colleagnes
maneuvering against the ceiling of cloud.---as though someone had
ripped the sky open with a bright steel blade--the cloud rack parted
and through the opening, one by one, brazenly disdaining concealment,
came the eighty ships or so of the Mercurian armada. They had been
closer than we thought.</p>

<p>Glistening golden shapes, the smallest of the size of the <i>Cosmos</i>,
they slowly settled down, secure in their own overwhelming power. Had
we remain inactive it is hard to say what might or might not have
happened--but as always nervousness precipitated the conflict.</p>

<p>ONE of our four ships, the closest to the descending host, suddenly
whirled, flashing its heat-ray as it moved. The ray landed on the nose
of the foremost space-ship. There came a red glow, and almost instantly
an expplosion set the air rocking. Perhaps the Mercurian was carrying
explosive material. At any rate for the second our puny heat ray,
almost by accident it seemed, was the spark to touch off the powder and
blow the ship to fragments.</p>

<p>It touched off more than that vengeance! The air-blast that set
fleet rocking had hardly died away--the fragments of the broken craft
were still falling even when its fellows, like hawks suddenly
disturbed, wheeled and in the twinkling of an eye had formed a circle
in the center of which floated our supporting guard-ships.</p>

<p>One moment we were dazzled by that whirling circle of gold. The next
the whole visible round of the cloud-wrapped sky had turned that
unearthly electric blue--and the very heavens seemed to be raining
molten metal on us.</p>

<p>The instant the first blue ray I had swung over the levers that
sealed our hull. Almost in the same motion I pushed the button that
rang the room to activity. We rose so quickly that we were nearly swung
off our feet and Jansca was thrown against me heavily. I caught her
from plunging to the floor.</p>

<p>I have often wondered since if that was the means of our salvation.
The roof above us seemed to split asunder, a searing blue ray passed so
close that we could feel the thrill and shock of it and then somehow we
seemed to be tipped out into free air, and to be dropping, dropping.
Jansca I still held close to me and it was that that saved herr life, I
really believe.</p>

<p>Coming out of the void we had laid aside our space-suits, but I had
donned instead my service uniform--put it down to that same uneasy
feeling that would not permit the <i>Cosmos</i> to be moored fast. Tucked in
a roll at the back of the collar was the tiny light, yet strong
parachute every Guard wears as a matter of course when maneuvering in
the air. Its weight does not incommode one, for it weighs little more
than a silk pocket handkerchief. But it is built of a material that
will take the strain of a normal man without ripping.</p>

<p>As we dropped I felt the tug about my waist as the light cords
tightened, and we floated instead of falling. We landed in a tumbled
heap, the breath shaken out of our bodies, and for a space we did not
move. At last I struggled to my feet, found my knife in its sheath and
cut the cords away. Jansa lay very still on the ground and a wild fear
that she was dead seized me.</p>

<p>But she moved, took a deep breath, and "Thank God, you're safe!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"But you--are you hurt?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Only the breath knocked out of me. But what
happened?"</p>

<p>I could not not say. I could only look about me. The <i>Cosmos</i> lay
some distance away from us, all that was left of her. Her rear half had
been fused so that it must have run like molten butter--her forward
part pitched down nose first and now lay half buried in the soft soil.
Fumes and smoke rose from her.</p>

<p>We had fallen some distance outside the city but our fall had been
marked and people came running to our assistance. With their help we
searched, sick at heart, knowing from the beginning that we would find
no living soul amongst the wreckage.</p>

<p>By some unaccountable working of the law of chance we had been
standing in the one spot in the ship that spelt safety. A foot one way
and the ray would have fused us, a foot the other and we would have
been tumbled into the shattered forward part and incinerated with the
others.</p>

<p>As it was, when the two halves separated, we were tumbled out into
the air in the same way that a housewife will crack an egg-shell and
tumble its contents into the pan. What miracle, what blind working of
fate it was that threw us clear of the blazing forward end I cannot say
even to this day.</p>

<p>Sick and weary, we stood and looked at each other, our faces wan and
ghastly in the light of destruction. High above us the golden fleet of
the Mercurian invaders still wheeled and dipped, but now the blue rays
were sweeping over Shangun and that city of wonder and beauty was
dissolving like ice in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Soon, if this went on, there would be nowhere in the whole round of
the planet where a man could lie with his roof above his head and know
the night would bring him rest and peace, the dawn the pleasures of a
new day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>Ad Astra</h3>

<p>THE little group of people--our-selves and the Venusians who had run
to our aid--remained staring like men frozen. The stupendous malignity
of it all had temporarily paralyzed us, and left us without power of
speech or movement. We could only stand gazing in awe-struck horror,
eyes round with apprehension, at each other's blue-lit faces and the
scene of stormy devastation beyond.</p>

<p>How long we stood thus I cannot say. It was probably no more than a
matter of seconds, though it seemed ages. The ruin of the <i>Cosmos</i>
close by us was still blowing and the vegetation it had crushed in its
fall smoked fitfully. A red-hot girder from the shell rested across the
trunk of one of those enormous tree ferns that are such a prominent
feature of the Venusian landscape.</p>

<p>The soggy mass of the bole resisted for a time the passage of the
girder as the bursts of steam eloquently witnessed. But presently the
heat of the metal forced it through the trunk and it fell with a clang
on another girder, already prone on the ground.</p>

<p>The clatter roused me. It seemed too to have released the shackles
from the others. A babble of voices came to me. Most of what was said,
being in Venusian, was unintelligible, but presently I found a man who
could speak Earth English--he had made one or two trips to our
planet--and through him I was able to communicate.</p>

<p>The salvation of the little group was for the moment the thought
uppermost in my mind. Cosmic destinies could wait until later. For a
time we were out of the arena and in the meanwhile it remained to be
seen how we could best keep life in us.</p>

<p>How extensive the damage done in Shangun was we could not say but
Jansca and I and our Venusian friend--Gallivog, he said his name
was--all agreed that we would only diminish our chances by making for
there. The populous centers were almost certain to be dealt with first
by the Mercurians.</p>

<p>But back of the city was a fern jungle with trees as thick as six
earth feet and in its depths we might find food and shelter of a sort.
I learnt from our guide that vegetable life was prolific on the planet
and only the constant vigilance of the Venusians kept it from
inundating their towns and cities.</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing for it but to take refuge in the jungle and
trust to the fates to find a way out for us. The Venusians themselves
were more or less at home here but Jansca and I found the climate
terribly trying.</p>

<p>She was used to the dry air and warm plains of Mars and this dank
dripping heat sapped her vitality to an incredible extent. Fortunately
we carried our own private supply of Oxcta, else I don't think we would
have made it. Most of the vegetable growths were edible and we did not
want for water but what we missed most was flesh meats. True, most of
the pools and lakes we came across were swarming with fish but they
were of a kind alien to us. The Venusians seemed to relish them but
somehow we could never adjust our palates to them.</p>

<p>The days crawled by. We managed to build a shelter of sorts in the
jungle and once that was erected Jansca showed signs of improvement,
though she never quite became her old self. And all the time, day and
night the Mercurian fliers passed to and fro overhead, the sky dripping
with the light of that blue ray of theirs.</p>

<p>From the moment we first decided what we were to do I had put the
group under discipline. Jansca, Gallivog and I had organized the camp
apportioned to each one the work he or she must do. I think it was
partly due to this strictness of mine and partly to the way we
camouflaged the camp that we were left so long undisturbed. One day
Gallivog went on a scouting expedition to Shangun.</p>

<p>When he returned he reported many of the buildings were still
intact, but the Mercurians had landed and were beginning to occupy the
place. Such Venusians as remained in the city and escaped with their
lives were being mustered and put to slave tasks.</p>

<p>His report, however, gave me an idea. I did not think it likely that
the invaders had yet found it possible to conduct a house-to-house
search, and acting on that assumption I belived there might be weapons
or food or other useful articles there that we would do well to
acquire.</p>

<p>I would have gone myself but I knew nothing of the layout of the
city. Gallivog and a couple of his friends, however, volunteered for
the job as soon as I mentioned the matter to them. I was glad
afterwards that I did.</p>

<p>They brought back quite a number of useful articles, ray tubes and
charges for them, compressed foods and tinned liquids that could be
warmed up mechanically. Gallivog, in a moment of acquisitiveveness, had
taken possession of a portable communicator set.</p>

<p>On thee face of it that was least useful. It had only a local range.
Its impulses would not penetrate beyond the planet's atmospheric
envelope and even if they would we dare not take the risk of
broadcasting signals through space. The Mercurians would certainly
locate their source and through them us.</p>

<p>For some days we had seen nothing of the Mercurian ships, though we
knew parties had landed and were even now in Shangun. The ships
themselves, I had no doubt, had drawn off to a base somewhere on the
planet and were probably refitting. I was beginning to wonder just how
much longer we could hold out before sickness and, sooner or later, the
lack of proper food and comfort began to thin out our little party when
the things itself happened.</p>

<p>A THIN thread of a whisper brought me out of my sleep, a voice close
to my ear. For the moment I thought it was Jansca speaking to me, the
next instant I changed my mind. It was her without a doubt but it was
not me she addressed. "Ship of Earth," she was murmuring. "We are here
in the jungle, Jansca Sanders, who is speaking, and her mate, the sole
survivors of the Earth ship <i>Cosmos</i>, brought down by Mercurian
invaders."</p>

<p>The wild thought hit me like a blow between the eyes. The jungle
fever I dreaded had got its hold on my mate.</p>

<p>She was dreaming...delirious...the first stage in that awful
Venusian jungle fever to which we Outtlanders--Martians and
Earthmen--seem peculiarly susceptible and for which we have not found
any cure!</p>

<p>I reached out my hand. Jansca should have been beside me, within
reach, but I struck only empty air. She had moved, was wandering not
only in mind but in body. The second dangerous stage.</p>

<p>Her voice went on. "Do not answer. You will only betray your
presence. But our directional beam shows you exactly overhead, high in
the clouds. I caught a glimpse of you, steel ship of Earth, so
different from the golden ones of the invaders. Can you rescue us? I
shall cut out now and presently flash a light from our position, so
that you may know exactly where we are."</p>

<p>I saw her now, a dim shape kneeling before something in the far
corner of our rude shelter. I strode across to her and caught her by
the shoulder. She gave a little cry that choked off as she realized it
was only I.</p>

<p>"Jansca," I said in a quick whisper, "what are you doing?"</p>

<p>Her answer was a woman's, yes, this girl of another world differed
little from the rest of her sex, whatever planet they come from. She
dropped her head on my shoulder and began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"I--I can't believe it even now," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Can't believe what?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"That I looked out the door--stared up at the sky, and saw a ship,
an Earth-ship just showing through a break in the cloud ceiling."</p>

<p>"An Earth-ship? If you saw such a thing, what makes you so sure it
wasn't a Mercurian craft?"</p>

<p>"The color--the polish of cobalt steel--the lines of an Earth
Guard-ship."</p>

<p>"You're mad, dreaming--the fever!"</p>

<p>"No, dear one, it may have been a dream that woke me, that prompted
me to creep from your side and look out the door--but what I saw was no
vision though it lasted only the tenth part of a second perhaps."</p>

<p>There was that in her manner which convinced me, galvanized me into
action. "You took a fearful risk," I said. "But never mind that now.
Wake the others--quickly. I'll signal."</p>

<p>"But the light, Jack?"</p>

<p>"My ray tube. If I discharge it into the ground it will give flash
enough for them to see--if they are watching."</p>

<p>"God pray they are, that my message reached them. I trained the
communicator beam overhead, just where I imagined the ship to be. I
made it selective. It might have missed them.</p>

<p>"We'll know that soon. Hurry now."</p>

<p>She turned into the next shelter, which was really a separate
compartment of ours. I took the ray tube from my torn and muddy jacket,
turned it into the ground at such an angle that the discharge would
splash a safe distance away. I pressed the button.</p>

<p>There came a blinding flash of light and I heard the hiss of steam
as the ray struck and volatilized the water content of some soggy
Venusian plant.</p>

<p>For the space of a heart-beat nothing happened. Then abruptly it
seemed to me that the clouds overhead were a little thicker than they
were a minute ago. A second later and I knew it was not a cloud I saw,
but the dim bulk of a spaceship dropping towards us.</p>

<p>She came to rest on an even keel a stone's throw away. Lights
suddenly flooded from her and a port was thrown hastily open. A voice
called, "Quick whoever you are! We must make altitude at once."</p>

<p>I bundled Jansca and the others in unceremoniously. The port closed
behind me with a clang and I was nearly thrown off my feet by the rapid
acceleration of the ship's rise. For a space I could not speak, could
do nothing but gasp and blink in the unaccustomed light. Out of the
dazzling glare came a hand seeking mine, a voice that cried, "Wonder of
wonders, so it's you I've pulled off, Jack, old man."</p>

<p>MIRACLE of miracles! The voice that of Glenn Vance, my relief! The
ship, my own Guard-ship, the old <i>E. Twenty-two!</i></p>

<p>"But how did you get here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Harran's orders, Jack. That man must have worked like crazy. He
called in every available Guard-ship, made us junction just beyond the
Moon and sent out a supply fleet to intercept us there. We fitted out
and mounted our weapons as we came along.</p>

<p>"There's not an Earth Guard-ship left between Earth and Mars and
half the Martian fleet is only a day behind us. The rest are following
with Tambard. We've orders to clean up this mess, no matter what the
cost. But you're the man we want, the one who can tell us everything.
The one person in the worlds I'm glad to have on board."</p>

<p>"There's a better one with me," I said.</p>

<p>"Jansca, a Dirka once, a Sanders now."</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"You'll have to look for the Mercurians," I said and told him of the
weapons he'd have to face.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was as bad as that," he said. "Eighty ships you
say they have? We've nearer two hundred, counting the Martians."</p>

<p>"You may swamp them by weight of numbers," I said, "providing you
keep out of range of their rays. You've the atomic ray rigged? Good.
What's its range?"</p>

<p>"We haven't tried yet," he told me. "We..." What more he meant to
say I do not know. The alarm bell from the locators cut him short and
on the heels of that came a call from the observer.</p>

<p>"They're awake to us," Vance cried. "We can't see them, however." He
was peering at the vision plate in front him. "We'll simply have to
trust to luck and the locators."</p>

<p>"Good," I said. "They can't use the ray while they have the
invisibility force turned on. You've got that much. What about your
other ships?"</p>

<p>"They're all right. They'll follow lead."</p>

<p>Something flashed in the vision plate, a gout of blue flame. The
ship reeled and for a moment I thought we were done for. But it must
have been merely a blind shot unless, of course, one of our ships had
incautiously ventured too low.</p>

<p>The men in the power room must have had their orders for I saw one
them glance swiftly down his sights then jerk the lever of his gun
back.</p>

<p>The blue flame in the vision plate vanished abruptly in an explosion
of red-hot cosmic dust. That seemed to be the general signal to join
battle. The Mercurians, confident in their superior science, came on,
disdaining all concealment. One could no longer look at the vision
plate to see how things were going. It was a wild riot of hot colors
that seared the eye-balls, light that crackled like a living thing and
that filled the sky with terror and death.</p>

<p>For a time I thought the tide was turning in our favor but gradually
I began to realize with a sinking of the heart that our fleet was being
forced and higher until we were struggling out in free space. Ever and
anon one of the Guard-ships went dripping down in a torrent of blue
rain, gleaming and molten, and the Mercurians grew more and more
venturesome until it became evident that we were fighting a losing
fight.</p>

<p>Jansca, close to me, looked into my eyes and I saw my fears mirrored
in hers. Once again we were facing the prospect of dissolution
together.</p>

<p>Abruptly I became aware that the vortex of the battle seemed to have
receded-It was dropping below us, nearer to the planet's surface. Then
too there were more Guard-ships. Space was filled them. They were
dropping like hawks out of the void.</p>

<p>"The Martians, the Martians are coming!" Jansca cried with a note of
joy.</p>

<p>It was true. The Martian fleet Vance had mentioned as being a few
hours in our rear had overtaken us. We were saved and the Mercurian
fleet, by sheer weight of numbers, was being beaten back into the mud
from which we could wish it had never arisen.</p>

<p>There is little more to tell.</p>

<p>Crippled and broken, the Mercurian fleet was chased and destroyed to
the last ship and the bruised and battered planet left to recover from
its wounds.</p>

<p>But for my own part I am not so sure. It may be that we have merely
postponed the evil day, for after all, they seem our superiors in many
branches of science. The secret of their blue ray or rather the manner
in which they generate it still eludes us.</p>

<p>Neither have we learnt how men like Nomo Kell--for it is certain
that he was not the only spy moving about in interplanetary
circles--managed to reach our worlds and establish their citizenship
there.</p>

<p>Myself, I do not think that we shall ever be free from the
possibility of invasion or solve these other mysteries until the day
when we feel we are enough advanced to send our own expeditions out
against this world which has once threatened the security of the inner
planets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have Jansca to occupy my thoughts and fill my heart to
the exclusion of all else. She is the best of wives and mates, as proud
of me as I am of her, though perhaps the proudest moment of our lives
was when she was given her badge and made a member of the
Interplanetary Guard with the same rank as I hold myself.</p>

<p>She values that little silver emblem more than anything else the
planets can give her. In an idle mood I sometimes tell her she cares
more for it than she does for me. But that I know she does not, for has
she not again and again given me ample proof of her love?</p>

<p>And I? Well, I have told my story and I would rather not repeat here
what the Council said to me. It was flattering, all too flattering, and
totally undeserved. I had little or nothing to do with bringing about
that crushing defeat of the Mercurians.</p>

<p>I shall always maintain, and Jansca agrees with me, that the real
saviors of our planets were the men who died the night the blue ray of
the Mercurians sliced the <i>Cosmos</i> as a hot knife will slice through
butter.</p>

<p>Arenack, Hume and my wonderful crew of gallant Martians, I salute
your shades. May the God of the Planets balance the manner of your
passing against whatever faults you had in life and bring you to that
ultimate Elysium--by whatever style we care to call it--where weary
heroes find rest and peace at last.</p>
