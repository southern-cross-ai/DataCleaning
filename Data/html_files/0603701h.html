<h1>The Green Shiver</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Perley Poore Sheehan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>I</h2>

<p>NO one would have taken him to be an American, as he stood there
in the thick of the Chinese mob. His wrinkled skin was brown and
dirty. The dank hair that fell over his swollen and gummy eyes was
black. So were his eyes black--as much as you could see of them.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways of turning eyes that are blue or gray
to a dark, unguessable shade. Lemon juice is the best--squeezed right
in if you can stand the pain. But the juice of bitter sage, a common
weed of the mountains, will also perform the trick. It hurts worse,
too. The root of the same plant will also furnish a sticky brown
stain for the fair Caucasian skin.</p>

<p>While it dries it wrinkles. Mixed with ashes, it not only makes
the skin look "native" but it also takes on the appearance of
encrusted dirt.</p>

<p>In his heart, Shattuck--Pelham Rutledge Shattuck, sometimes of the
U. S. A.--laughed a little. He wished that certain friends of his
could see him now--and smell him! Even the smell was right. He could
distinguish it even here in the crowd. He was an offense even to
himself.</p>

<p>But this was the fault--or the virtue--of the clothes he wore.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a combination of soiled sheepskins, of greasy
yak-hair felt, and tattered silk.</p>

<p>On his head was a Tibetan felt cap--a sort of pointed skull-cap
with ear-laps.</p>

<p>As for his race, he might have been one of several things:
Tibetan, Mongol, or for that matter, just wild Chinaman--shan jin, a
man of the mountains. A robber, in any case. Minchow, just now, was
full of such.</p>

<p>Minchow was one of those old cities the outside world never hears
about. It lay far up in wild Kansu, where the frontiers of China,
Mongolia and Tibet meet. A great place for caravans. Caravans had
been making this their headquarters for centuries--caravans from
Turkey and Persia, with opium and tobacco; from Tibet with turquoise
and gold and musk; from China with silk and ivory.</p>

<p>In the gossip of desert and mountain, Minchow stood considerably
higher than Peking.</p>

<p>NOW a new war-lord had taken Minchow and made it his capital. All
day his men had been going about the tunnel-like streets of the old
city with red paddles in their hands as signs of a military
requisition. They took whatever they wanted--from turnips to women;
for which they sometimes gave a "chop"--the war-lord's seal on a bit
of red paper, which passed for money--and sometimes they didn't.</p>

<p>In any case, the soldiers had rounded up some twenty-five or
thirty small merchants, too poor for "squeeze," who'd protested
overmuch, and the war-lord was about to make an example of them.</p>

<p>SHATTUCK could see the victims. He was taller than most of the
straining crowd about him. He was taller than most of the war-lord's
soldiers who formed a triple hedge about the place of execution.</p>

<p>Shattuck had an eye for everything--the discipline of these
troops, the way they were uniformed and armed, the expression on
their faces.</p>

<p>Good fighting-stock, he judged. Mountaineers and Northerners,
husky, browned and hard.</p>

<p>A little ragged in their quilted cotton, Chinese-style; but that
would pass. Their rifles were modern and looked well cared for.
Natural fighters who didn't know what they were fighting for, beyond
those perquisites the red paddles brought them; fighting, as some men
work, for what it brought in grub and fun.</p>

<p>"Great stuff, though," Shattuck was telling himself, "if they once
went crazy for some great cause!"</p>

<p>There was a shrill of hysterical bugles and a crash of gongs.</p>

<p>The war-lord was coming.</p>

<p>The place of judgment couldn't have been better chosen.</p>

<p>It was a broad, raised terrace, a platform about a hundred yards
long and as many wide. On one side of this was the long facade of a
temple, on the other, the long front of an old imperial palace. The
temple had been made a barracks for the war-lord's personal regiment,
which now stood on guard. The palace had become his headquarters.</p>

<p>Both buildings were ornate with red lacquer and gold, heavy green
tiles and flamboyant carvings. They were like the wings of some
tremendous theatre. The terrace of polished stone was the stage.
Mountains and sky made the backdrop.</p>

<p>In the middle of the terrace, facing the palace, the prisoners
were kneeling at spaced intervals, each stripped to his waist and his
hands tied behind him. Old and young, black hair and gray, skinny
backs and backs that would have looked well in the prize-ring, here
and there an old-fashioned queue dangling to the pavement.</p>

<p>At the left and right of this kneeling file were two squads of
soldiers standing at ease. Between these two groups, the war-lord's
executioner strolled--a pachyderm of a man, a professional wrestler,
also stripped to the waist and proud of what he had to show in the
way of well-fed brawn, carrying what wasn't so much a sword as a
colossal butcher knife.</p>

<p>He didn't look at the prisoners. The prisoners didn't look at
him.</p>

<p>There came another blast and jangle from the trumpets and the
gongs. And the crowd went a little more tense.</p>

<p>THE war-lord had passed the Number Two court of the palace. He was
evidently taking his time--stopping to light a cigarette, pausing to
admire a fountain.</p>

<p>The prisoners had been waiting so long, some of them had begun to
sag. The executioner lost his smirk for a frown as he prodded this
one and that one up to a position of greater respect. Here and there
kicking knees back into a more perfect alignment.</p>

<p>Then he was smirking again as he resumed his stroll.</p>

<p>"Him I'll kill," said Shattuck in his heart, as he gripped the
sword concealed under his ragged sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>Just then, there was a third ripping blast and jangle as the
war-lord, followed by his staff, sauntered through the great pai-lo,
or entrance--gate, of the palace.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>HE was a short but powerful man--bowlegged from having passed most
of his life in the saddle. A Mongol habit. That he was more Mongol
than Chinese was stamped on his face.</p>

<p>It was a face that was large and almost perfectly round. The
cheekbones were more prominent than the large but bridgeless nose. A
moon-face. It was like a platter of hammered brass, the hammered
brass effect deriving not only from the color and shine, but the
thousand smallpox pits that covered it. Also from the fact that the
expression of it never changed.</p>

<p>Only the bead-like eyes of it were quick and alive, incessantly
alert, every glance like a little black dart that traveled far and
never missed its mark.</p>

<p>For an instant, Shattuck had an almost painful impression that he
himself had been looked at.</p>

<p>The war-lord didn't even move his lips or change his expression
when he laughed or talked. You could watch him closely, and you
wouldn't see the quiver of a muscle.</p>

<p>His lips were always a little open. They gave that platter-mask of
his a fixed, inscrutable smile. It was a smile that gave all those
who looked at it long enough a strange invasion of terror, especially
if they found themselves looking overlong at the great man's
teeth.</p>

<p>These teeth were small and pointed and spaced apart, very clean,
but uncanny and not quite human. They were like the teeth of certain
rapacious fish. And the report was current--just one of many about
this man of power--that he'd come by these teeth through a certain
habit of feeding, once every new moon, on forbidden flesh.</p>

<p>HE was familiar with all these stories, of course. There wasn't a
war-lord in China with a more efficient, or harder-working corps of
spies.</p>

<p>But the stories pleased him. He encouraged them. They were right
in his line.</p>

<p>He was General Yu.</p>

<p>Now, yu is the Chinese word for jade.</p>

<p>Jade, in Chinese common thought, is green; and from this and that
the general had come by a nickname. It was: "Yu, the Green
Shiver"</p>

<p>He came strolling out through the great pai-lo and stood there for
a while leaning on his sword, knowing the sort of impression that he
made and enjoying it.</p>

<p>All eyes were on him now, and the black eyes in his moon-disc of a
face shot a million tiny black darts back at the crowd.</p>

<p>In the collapse of all sound, following his appearance, you could
almost hear the packed mob translate that nickname of his with a
single, chattering breath:</p>

<p>"Yu! Yu! Yu!, the Green Shiver!"</p>

<p>Finally he glanced at the kneeling prisoners, from one to the
other, his examination beginning at the left of the file and
proceeding to the right--an instant glance for each of them.</p>

<p>And as each was touched by that glance, it was as if the victim
had been touched by the point of a needle--a poisoned needle,
perhaps. At the touch of it, something in each of them died--a
flutter of hope, an excuse, a plea.</p>

<p>MEANTIME, that elephant of an executioner had been standing there,
also swaggering a little, swelling his chest, flexing the muscles of
his arms, playing his big butcher knife in little oscillations
somewhat like a prize-fighter showing off and limbering up after he
has cast his dressing--robe aside.</p>

<p>The Green Shiver glanced at the executioner, and the yellow
Hercules stiffened. There for a moment, was a whiff of fright on the
executioner's own face. It was known that the Green Shiver cared to
have no man steal his act.</p>

<p>But the mood of the war-lord was tolerant.</p>

<p>Some sort of signal must have been shot from his ferret-eyes. Or
perhaps he spoke--there was no telling from any movement of his lips.
There was a swish and a thud. It was as if there was a tiny explosion
of red mist over a spouting red fountain, and a head had jumped away
and rolled.</p>

<p>AGAIN that gasping breath from the crowd:</p>

<p>"Yu! Yu, the Green Shiver!"</p>

<p>The war-lord must have heard it. He appeared to smile. But on his
face there was no change of expression. Only his eyes were active as
the executions followed.</p>

<p>One after the other. Without disorder. Now and then the
executioner had to get his subject into a better pose. He did this
with his foot. The slash followed afterward so lightning-fast,
there'd been no time for the victim to sag again.</p>

<p>Twice the big man showed good-natured patience--one of the elderly
and one of the younger prisoners being too far gone, having to be
coaxed to a balance by an ear. But, even then, no disorder, no loss
of more than a dozen seconds.</p>

<p>And now that original little red cloud had become a faint but
clearly discernible mist in the westerning sun--a faint pink cloud,
like that which might overhang a pool or a cataract at sunset.</p>

<p>The residents of Minchow and the surrounding country had long
called this valley of theirs the High Cloud Place, or Cloudy
Garden--because of the rainbow-tinted clouds that hovered about the
numerous cascades coming down from the hills. But now they were
calling it something else.</p>

<p>Since the Green Shiver had come this way, the Cloudy Garden had
become the Feng-ti-yu, meaning "the Valley of Hell."</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>THE executioner had just finished his work and there was a surging
movement in the crowd toward dispersal when the War-lord raised his
sword in a signal that the show wasn't over.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a smashing attack of noise again as the
buglers and gong-beaters got to work. The noise swirled up in a
crashing roar, like a house afire, and this time lasted longer than
it had before. At the same time the spies and military police
scattered through the crowd, shouting for everyone to remain where he
was.</p>

<p>Here and there a head was cracked, someone was collared, thrown
and kicked.</p>

<p>Shattuck took advantage of the disorder to work in closer to the
hedge of soldiers.</p>

<p>The blare and hammer of trumpet and gong had as if set a new tempo
for the beating of his heart and the pulsing of his blood.</p>

<p>He always felt like this when some new excitement was
impending.</p>

<p>It was as if his heart took voice. It was as if his boiling blood
became the blood of some older, more primitive and, perhaps, a better
self.</p>

<p>He wasn't Shattuck, any more. Not Pelham Rutledge Shattuck of the
U.S.A. He was Captain Trouble, the Fighting Fool. Shadak Khan, the
heir of Kubla Khan, whose sword he'd come by, whose empire he'd
unfurl again up and down and around the world!</p>

<p>Before he could push his private reflections further, he was once
again engrossed by what was unfolding before his eyes.</p>

<p>The war-lord, still followed by his staff, having neatly skirted
that lake of blood in the center of the terrace--a lake of blood in
which the dead were hunched or sprawled, like ornamental islands--was
now pacing his leisurely way around the limits of the terrace, like a
general inspecting his troops.</p>

<p>BUT it was the gaping crowd as well as the banked regiment that he
looked at. The stone--paved terrace was two or three feet higher than
the level of the rest of the open square. The Green Shiver could look
down on all these people. They shivered all right at the touch of his
eyes.</p>

<p>For a second--the fraction of a second---Shattuck felt the touch
of those eyes on his own. There came to him the penetrating thought
that he had been discovered, that the war-lord knew who he was--knew
that here was a rival down from the mountains--knew that back there
in the mountains were horses and men, armed with machine-guns stolen
from an arm-running caravan, captured far away at the other end of
the Gobi.</p>

<p>What didn't the Green Shiver know, with all those spies of
his?</p>

<p>Long ago he must have heard the gossip that was now going the
rounds of a thousand--ten thousand--camp-fires.</p>

<p>Shadak Khan! The name had caught on! Chinese-Mongol for Captain
Trouble. A Captain Trouble come to conquer the world. Like Kubla
Khan, his great predecessor. And already this Captain Trouble, the
Fighting Fool, had gone to Kara Koto, the ghost city of the Gobi.
There he had met and defeated the Chud and allied himself with the
Agharti--two of the great Subterranean Peoples, as they were
called.</p>

<p>The Chud were slaves. They'd been set to work digging Kara Koto
out of the sands.</p>

<p>The Agharti had acknowledged Shadak Khan as their chief. They'd
put at his disposal all their buried treasures of gold and magic.
Shadak Khan! Kubla Khan come back after all these centuries!</p>

<p>WHETHER by intent or accident, the war-lord had come to a stand
not far from where Shattuck himself stood wedged between the soldiers
and the mob.</p>

<p>All this time the bugles had been squalling and the gongs rolling
out their tumbling thunder---a barbaric incantation to turn any man
to thoughts of blood and fire. Now the war-lord again made a quick
signal with his sword and the racket ended.</p>

<p>Even after it had ended, the air kept throbbing for a minute or
so, and during this interval the Green Shiver still looked about him.
As he slowly turned, that big face of his caught the sun and
reflected it like hammered brass.</p>

<p>This time Shattuck had a yet stronger impression that the war-lord
had looked at him---looked at him as a snake might look, seeing,
knowing, appraising, but itself a sphinx.</p>

<p>A hard, metallic voice was heard--a small voice, but
needle-pointed, carrying far, like those black darts of the
war-lord's eyes. And although there was still not the slightest
quiver or change of General Yu's bright face and grinning lips,
everyone knew that the voice was his.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>HE spoke a variant of the Peking dialect and he didn't speak this
very well. But it was good enough. Minchow, as a caravan center, had
been brought up on strange accents.</p>

<p>The voice came in a drawling, choppy snarl, almost plaintive, at
times, like the menacing talk of an offended tiger.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go on killing you," the Green Shiver said. "I
like this town. I want to stay here and have people around me. I'm
going to make it my capital. I'm going to protect you. I'm telling
you this for the good of us all. I don't want to do to you what I did
to the people of Holy-Way-Town down there in the South. They thought
they'd keep their women and their rice for themselves. Now they don't
need either."</p>

<p>As an orator he was highly successful, regardless of his accent.
The people were listening. The haze of sunset was like a haze of
blood. There was a scent of blood in the air stronger than all the
other compact taints that drifted here and there--of sweat and
incense, of unmentionable things; the faint but far-traveling perfume
of sesame.</p>

<p>The Green Shiver, still with his darting eyes at work on the
crowd, made a slight movement with his hand. One of his younger
staff-officers leaned close, listened to some whispered command, and
started off at a trot toward the palace.</p>

<p>"Speaking of women," said the Green Shiver--and now Shattuck's
heart leapt with a premonition--"speaking of women, I suppose you've
all heard that I have a certain little taitai of my own just now--a
white one, a maiden, daughter of a keto-jin (hairy foreigner),
daughter of a cursed missionary and his wife, I found down there in
Holy-Way-Town--Meikuo-jin (Americans)--and worth their weight in
gold. Them I killed. I sent them to hell. That shows you that I'm not
after money.</p>

<p>"But as for this daughter of theirs, this little
yang-kwei-tzu--"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"As for this little foreign devil--"</p>

<p>He'd heard that patter of feet. He waited. A dozen palace-servants
in long purple robes---eunuchs, most likely--were coming on the run,
bearing an elaborate sedan-chair, on long poles. It was an imperial
chair, screened and veiled and ornamented, fit for an emperors'
favorite, for which it might have been originally intended. It was
carved, jeweled, lacquered. It was further ornamented with swaying
tassels and little bells, like the wind-bells of a temple.</p>

<p>The servants put the chair down, bowed to the ground, and pattered
into the background.</p>

<p>THE Green Shiver had a great sense of theatrical values. He was
absolutely motionless as he scanned the crowd. Shattuck was conscious
of those watchful, snakey eyes and controlled himself. But his heart
was beating high.</p>

<p>Then it was true--the rumor he'd heard in the hills! It was this
that had brought him here--an American girl in the hands of the Green
Shiver.</p>

<p>He even knew her name. It was Macon. The Chinese convert--a
fugitive from Holy-Way-Town that they'd found dying in the hills--had
called it Ma-kong. But he'd been able to write the name: Laureen
Macon.</p>

<p>The crowd strained, holding its breath. Most of the people here
had lived their lives thus far and had never seen a foreign devil
before, even a man. And now, a taitai!--a woman! a girl!</p>

<p>One of the officers in the war-lord's suite, acting on an
inaudible and invisible order, had stooped toward the chair and
jerked a carved screen aside.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he ordered, in correct Chinese.</p>

<p>The girl stepped out.</p>

<p>At sight of her, the crowd let out a sound that was half-howl,
half-shriek. They were looking at the apparition of their lives.</p>

<p>It was as if they'd seen a spirit.</p>

<p>She was, literally, white and gold, an ivory statue come to
life.</p>

<p>SHATTUCK read details of her tragedy as he looked at her. She'd
been wakened from her sleep. She'd been carried off before she'd had
a chance to dress herself. All she wore was her nightdress and a
Chinese coat of embroidered silk, grass sandals on her feet. Her head
was bare and her long yellow hair was loosely plaited.</p>

<p>But the tragic note was principally in her face. A young face. She
was perhaps, eighteen, or even younger. A face that was lean and
delicate, very beautiful, with wide eyes filled at once with terror
and challenge.</p>

<p>"Hi-ee!" cried the crowd.</p>

<p>"Ee-ya!"</p>

<p>Shattuck was smothering his heart as he looked up at her.</p>

<p>The girl was frightened to death, but was standing firm. And
that--was courage!</p>

<p>"Stand forward!" said the officer, curtly--the one who'd commanded
her to leave the chair. "Quickly!"--and he gave her a prod with his
finger-tips.</p>

<p>"And you also, I'll kill for that!" Captain Trouble choked in his
heart.</p>

<p>Shattuck was Captain Trouble again. He was Shadak Khan! He'd kill!
The world was in need of a purge! He was the Fighting Fool. The world
was in need of Fighting Fools just now!</p>

<p>The girl--like a girl in a dream--had stepped forward. She was
looking out over that ocean of straining yellow faces--not all of
them bad--not many bad; but strained, gaping, shot with wonder, lust,
superstition.</p>

<p>"Hi-ee! Eee-ya! Ai!</p>

<p>Then the droning snarl of the Green Shiver was snaking out over
their heads again, commanding silence, as a coiling lash would
do.</p>

<p>"Look at her!" he cried. "Silver and gold! Who wants her?"</p>

<p>The question was so amazing that it held the crowd in
suspense.</p>

<p>The Green Shiver took up his menacing complaint:</p>

<p>"So far, Minchow hasn't been so very generous! Who wants her? I'm
going to sell her to the highest bidder!"</p>

<p>Shattuck could control himself no longer. He hadn't tried to. It
was something else controlling him.</p>

<p>"Me!" he howled in a choked voice. "I want her!"</p>

<p>He thought of it only after the last word was out--he'd spoken
Chinese, thank God!</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>SOME of those nearest Shattuck--those who could see him--began to
laugh and jeer. They referred to his rags and his smell.</p>

<p>But he turned on them with a curse so deadly and foul that they
quailed, and, satisfied, he turned again toward the war-lord.</p>

<p>General Yu was looking at him. Even the girl was looking at him.
And some of the nearest soldiers also had lost their fixity of
attention on the war-lord and were glancing around at him.</p>

<p>At the same time, as if through the back of his head, Shattuck was
aware of pushings and scufflings, and he knew what the meaning of
this would be. These were the bravos and gorillas of the war-lord
who'd been scattered through the crowd. They were headed his way.</p>

<p>Had the Green Shiver given some secret signal that would fetch
him--Shattuck wondered--a knife in the back?</p>

<p>In any case, as well to be damned for a sheep as a lamb!</p>

<p>SHATTUCK again addressed the Green Shiver direct:</p>

<p>"You made your offer! I take you up!"</p>

<p>He and the war-lord were looking at each other. While they looked,
there was one of those moments when the fate of the world seems to be
hanging in suspense--all things suspended--ready to fade into
nothingness or come back into solid reality again: those mountains in
the background, the blue Nan Shan; sun and air; this crowd; that
white wraith of a girl.</p>

<p>He didn't dare look at her again, as yet, but he knew that again
she had turned and was looking down at him--just another figure in
that nightmare of hers.</p>

<p>What could she be thinking of him? Had she grasped something of
what was going on? The Chinese refugee back there in the mountains
had spoken of her as not having been long out of America. How much
could she possibly understand of what was going on.</p>

<p>The Green Shiver had kept his grin. But that meant nothing.
Through his small-pox-paralyzed lips, his small pointed teeth were
gleaming. He was something very, very hard to look at, vaguely
terrifying even to a man with nothing on his conscience, nothing to
fear. To face him now was like facing a tiger in a world of
tigers.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" came the cold steel of his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm an ambassador," said Shattuck.</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke. He'd made it boldly. This was no time to
cringe. He'd bawled his answer.</p>

<p>There was a guffaw, a howl.</p>

<p>"He stinks!"</p>

<p>"He's lousy!"</p>

<p>"He's smoked a green pill!"</p>

<p>But the Green Shiver had seen nothing nor heard anything to laugh
at. He looked away from Shattuck for a few flashing seconds,
spreading a chill and a silence wherever he looked.</p>

<p>"An ambassador!" said General Yu, in his droning voice; and his
eyes were drilling into Shattuck again.</p>

<p>Yu was no fool. He'd spent a lot of his life among men who'd
looked no better than this clotted and squinting beggar down there.
Some of these men had been kings in their way, the masters of strange
secrets, wide flocks.</p>

<p>"Ma-lai!" Shattuck growled. "Make way!"</p>

<p>AND he clawed at the shoulders of the nearest soldiers.</p>

<p>There was something of terror in the way they tried to stop him.
Was this an assassin--a crazy man at that--bent on killing the Green
Shiver here before their eyes?</p>

<p>For a flickering moment it seemed as if the same question had
found its way into the warlord's brain. He took a half-step backward.
As he did so, two of his staff-officers jerked out automatics and
switched the muzzles toward Shattuck.</p>

<p>But it was the war-lord himself who repeated the order that
Shattuck had given.</p>

<p>"Ma-lai!"</p>

<p>And Shattuck, who'd been elbowing the soldiers aside, found the
way open before him.</p>

<p>The world seemed large before him as he emerged from the crowd. He
was breathing again and looking about him as he came up to the
stone--paved terrace.</p>

<p>He was close to the girl, close to the war-lord, close to those
tense young officers who stood just back of the war-lord still with
their revolvers drawn.</p>

<p>"Kungyeh," Shattuck said as he faced the war-lord "--Duke, you at
least know a man when you see one. So do I!"</p>

<p>The crowd had fallen deathly silent again. The only sound in all
Minchow, just then, was a faint and as if reluctant murmur from the
wind-bells, suspended from the temple roof. It sounded like a
tolling--a knell for those already dead and those about to die.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>"WHAT'S your name?" came the query from the war-lord's motionless
lips. "I have no name," Shattuck answered recklessly.</p>

<p>"What's your business?"</p>

<p>"Bakha!"--a strolling minstrel.</p>

<p>Shattuck felt a sort of drunkenness upon him. He always felt like
that when his danger was great--it was like some subtle ether
distilled by the nearness of Death. Yet it left him fearless, poised,
his brain abnormally clear.</p>

<p>He looked at the girl.</p>

<p>She was gazing at him as if with sightless eyes. One horror more
or less at the present moment meant nothing to her.</p>

<p>Shattuck, rolling slightly on his feet, took time to look out over
the crowd. His look was one of contempt and defiance. He made the
gesture of spitting at them. Then, once more, he confronted the
war-lord.</p>

<p>"If you are a strolling minstrel," said the Green Shiver, "you'll
know some poetry. Recite us something."</p>

<p>Shattuck quoted:</p>

<p>May you mount the Sacred Mountain</p>

<p>And find yourself as a god;</p>

<p>Eat jade-pure sky and quaff the sunrise cloud,</p>

<p>Yoke up the hornless dragon---</p>

<p>The White Tiger of the clouds--and so,</p>

<p>Ride on to heaven!</p>

<p>Had any of those tense young officers back of the war-lord--or had
the Green Shiver himself---detected anything wrong in his recitation
of the verse? It was a poem he'd learned as a child, down in
Tientsin. Had the girl caught the message he'd woven into it? One
English word to a line he'd woven into the recitation:</p>

<p>"Laureen!</p>

<p>"Laureen!</p>

<p>"You</p>

<p>"Have</p>

<p>"Help</p>

<p>"Near-by!"</p>

<p>Shattuck had the pose of a man who has acquitted himself well, and
isn't ashamed to acknowledge it himself. But he
wondered---wondered!</p>

<p>DEATH was very near, and now this meant not only his own death but
that--and God grant nothing worse than that--of the girl. He looked
at her again, taking his time about it this time, as any man
might--especially when he was expecting to buy her. This time, when
her eyes crossed his, he saw--he was sure--a glint of
understanding.</p>

<p>General Yu cut in with a purring query:</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Minstrel, you are an ambassador, are you?"</p>

<p>"Duke, I have that honor."</p>

<p>"And what's that you've got hidden under your coat?"</p>

<p>This was death--it flashed through Shattuck's mind. But that other
self, his Genius, came to his aid.</p>

<p>"That, Duke," he said, "is my testimonial---the sword of him who
sent me!"</p>

<p>AND before the frozen stare of the officers and the crowd, and for
an instant, the alert suspicion of the Green Shiver himself, Shattuck
carefully, slowly, brought out the sword he'd been keeping concealed.
He brought it out unsheathed, gleaming white--the perfect sword.</p>

<p>There was no disguising it. This, unmistakably, was the Perfect
Sword. As compared to other swords, it was as a thoroughbred among
crowbaits--the beautiful lines, the perfect balance, but, above all,
that ancient seal on the gold pommel of the hilt. It was a seal cut
into a thousand rocks, in the secret places of the mountains.</p>

<p>"Who was it that sent you?" the war-lord purred.</p>

<p>"Shadak Khan," Shattuck replied. "He has sent me to inquire about
this maiden."</p>

<p>As Shattuck said this, he saw a glint of such black poison in the
eyes of General Yu, that he knew that the girl's fate and his own
would be sealed, unless he thought quickly.</p>

<p>Quickly he added in a whisper that only the Green Shiver could
hear:</p>

<p>"And I alone, O Duke, can deliver Shadak Khan into your
safe-keeping."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m!"</p>

<p>The seconds ticked off. Looking up, Shattuck saw a dozen carrion
eagles in the sky--circling lower, circling lower, while the Green
Shiver toyed with plans and speculations in his crafty brain.</p>

<p>"I think," the war-lord said, at last, as much to the others as to
Shattuck, "that the honorable ambassador would like to refresh
himself with a bath and a change of raiment. We'll talk things over
afterward in private."</p>

<p>As Shattuck joined the procession that now started for the
palace--trumpets screaming and the big gongs rolling again--he
noticed that the executioner was walking at his side.</p>

<p>There lay the score or more of headless bodies in their blackening
pool--most of them in an attitude of prayer. He took a last glance at
the sky. The sky seemed very beautiful. The sun was going down.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>SHATTUCK, that morning, had left his people well back in the Nan
Shan. They'd been on their way through the mountains, headed for
Tibet, when they'd come on the dying Chinese who'd told them of the
murdered missionary and his wife, and their daughter, Laureen, and
then of that grinning horror of a warlord, General Jade, the Green
Shiver.</p>

<p>Just over the mountains from China, and Minchow, in the Tibetan
highlands lay Koko Nor--Koko Nor, the Blue Lake. It was at Koko Nor
that Kubla Khan had established one of his capitals. Where Kubla Khan
had passed, there Shadak Khan would follow.</p>

<p>Shadak Khan was already at the head of a growing horde.</p>

<p>Juma, the old Kirghiz chief, was calling in his people to join the
new movement. Why not? Fighting for those who wanted it; new grazing
lands for those who didn't want to fight.</p>

<p>Then Champela, the mystic, the only lama in Tibet with an American
father, had decided that now was the time, and his friend Shattuck
the means, to bring about the long-predicted reformation of the
Lhassa government and Lamaism in general.</p>

<p>It was the dream of many another fighting--priest in the Tibetan
highlands. They'd come drifting down to the Lamasery of the Soaring
Meditation ready to join the movement. For them it was the launching
of a new Crusade.</p>

<p>SO with the Agharti, that tribe of the Subterranean People who'd
kept alive during the centuries the legend that some day the Great
Khan would return and when he did it would be to clear the way for
Maitreya, the new King of Peace and King of the World.</p>

<p>Shattuck had given them a sign. He himself was the Great Khan come
back--Shadak Khan, the Trouble Captain, Captain Trouble.</p>

<p>The Aghartis, master astrologists, all of them, had cast
Shattuck's horoscope. It was as they had known it would be. The
"eight signs of his birth" were all signs of war and the sun over
all, meaning that he would succeed.</p>

<p>Now some of the Agharti were going with Shadak Khan to Koko Nor
while others remained at Kara Koto, the black ghost city of the Gobi,
now arising again from the sands after more than half a thousand
years...</p>

<p>"Dak, my son and my chief," old Juma had said, stroking his beard,
"you can't risk all this by going down into that Chinese city alone.
Say the word, and we'll all go."</p>

<p>But Dak--Juma's first rendering of Shattuck's name--must have his
way. His friends had seen him on his way. Strange are the ways of a
man possessed! The life on which may hang the turning of the
world--that life a man will risk as he might risk a coin.</p>

<p>BUT the thing that is written can't be changed. Kismet! Karma!
Fate! Still, there had been certain arrangements, in case things did
go wrong. That also would be an affair of Karma, the invisible tissue
of cause and effect that shaped men's lives.</p>

<p>Should Shadak Khan fail to appear again outside the walls of
Minchow before the setting of the sun, the Agharti, singly and in
scattered groups, were to make their way to the city in the dark.</p>

<p>The main gates of the city would be closed by that time, but
they'd have no trouble in finding the entrance of the
opium-runners--the t'u fang-tze.</p>

<p>Minchow had been in the smuggling business--opium included--for
upward of a thousand years.</p>

<p>Great guides and travelers were the Agharti, especially at night.
Which wasn't surprising. From father to son they'd spent their own
centuries going about Asia in secret. They had secret trails through
mountains and mountain-caves, known only to themselves. They had
allies in widely-scattered cities.</p>

<p>All these centuries they had been storing up this knowledge and
their wealth against the coming of the Great Khan. And now the Great
Khan had come: Shadak Khan, Captain Trouble.</p>

<p>There was a cave in the Nan Shan overlooking Minchow called the
Fur-Girl cave. It was a hiding-place that could be reached only by
the Gorge of the Grasping Fist.</p>

<p>In the cave itself and the folds of the mountain that could be
reached only through the cave, there was room enough to hide away an
army--an army with horses and camels.</p>

<p>It was here that the two chief lieutenants of Shadak Khan, Juma
and Champela, one the fighting chief and one the spiritual chief of
the rising horde, took up their watch after the Agharti had taken
their leave.</p>

<p>Sunset! And in the glow of the West the faint slim ring of a new
moon! The moon was gone and the stars came out.</p>

<p>Dogs were barking now, and down in the darkening valley Minchow
was like a moored ship gleaming with ten thousand yellow lights. The
lights grew rarer as the stars swung over.</p>

<p>"And still no Shadak Khan!" breathed Juma in his beard.</p>

<p>Champela, the mystic, was at his side. Champela had been sitting,
cross-legged as was his custom, like a man in a trance. His eyes were
open, but they appeared to be unseeing. One would have said that
Champela was seeing by some other eye.</p>

<p>"There's a signal!" Champela suddenly spoke up.</p>

<p>"Where?" gasped Juma.</p>

<p>He had the eyes of an eagle--or a nighthawk--and he'd been
watching dark Minchow as if it held his only hope of heaven.</p>

<p>A full two seconds passed--seconds of darkness; then, from a
corner of special blackness in the city's mass Juma saw a flash of
bright red flame.</p>

<p>It was the signal they'd been waiting for.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>THE palace was as large as any that Shattuck had ever
seen--courtyard after courtyard and all of these guarded by soldiers.
He was a prisoner. He had no doubt about that as he followed the lead
of the executioner back into the far interior of the palace. Very
wonderful! Painted and gilded rafters, jade and porcelain, vast old
carpets of yellow and black, plum-color and mountain-blue, silk
hangings.</p>

<p>"The honorable ambassador will drink tea with me--after his
refreshing bath," said General Yu, and he was gone with the members
of his staff.</p>

<p>Had the Green Shiver meant it for a joke?</p>

<p>Whether he did or not, Shattuck didn't care. He was busy, busy.
His brain had developed as many feelers as a cuttle-fish.</p>

<p>He believed that he could find again the court where the
chair-carriers had turned aside with Laureen Macon. He could find
again the court where the war-lord had just now left him. This was a
game and the loser in it would lose his life.</p>

<p>The palace was getting dark, and a swarm of servants were going
about the place lighting paper lanterns and oil lamps, some of which
were old and some of which were modern. Even to Minchow the American
Oil King had found his way; and by some occult twist of his mind
Shattuck found the fact encouraging.</p>

<p>BUT the thing that arrested him most was the sight of all these
servants. Manifestly they were not newcomers. These were Minchow
people. These were servants that had been left here by the old
regime.</p>

<p>He took note of the fact and no longer felt alone. He was on the
side of these people, and if he could prove it to them so also would
they be on his side.</p>

<p>Then--the crisis was on him like a springing tiger.</p>

<p>There'd come a push from behind. As he plunged forward, unable to
turn, he was caught in what seemed to be a giant spider-web. The web
had been spun across the door of a shadowy room. The room was
suddenly filled with men in uniforms.</p>

<p>Shattuck had heard about these man-trap spider-webs before--heard
about them vaguely. They were good to take men alive and uninjured.
Like that the prey could be left in full possession of his capacity
for pain. An old invention--old as China. The real, exquisite
perfection of torture could be indulged in only when the victim was
taken unblemished, unstunned, wide awake.</p>

<p>TORTURE! Shattuck could see it now. He'd be tortured while the
Green Shiver was drinking his tea. There was the finger-nail torture?
The ten--thousand little tap torture!</p>

<p>All this simultaneously, in the very act of sprawling.</p>

<p>And other things simultaneously. A warning in his brain not to
struggle--it was by his struggles, sudden and wild, that the victim
tied himself up the more securely in these silken nets. A foot in his
back--and there came to Shattuck a memory of the executioner footing
like that a man he was about to kill.</p>

<p>And all in this same instant there came to Shattuck the memory
that he'd promised himself to kill the executioner for doing just
that.</p>

<p>At his first contact with the silken mesh he'd started to turn.
He'd kept his arms hunched and close to his sides.</p>

<p>Before he'd come to the floor he'd pulled an automatic from the
left sleeve of his sheepskin coat and sent a bullet through a mass of
flesh that was all he could see.</p>

<p>Shattuck came down on his side all but paralyzed so far as free
movement was concerned.</p>

<p>The next time he fired he came within an ace of shooting himself
in the chin. He'd fired with his two hands against his stomach, up
past his own head, at some one plunging toward him from the room.</p>

<p>Two shots, and he didn't know--he didn't even try to guess--the
result of either of these. But the fools were giving him time. Why
didn't they pile on to him?--smother him?</p>

<p>Carefully, swiftly, knowing that a single false movement and yet
also the loss of a second, might mean slow death--for himself, for
the girl--while a Green Jade Devil drank his tea--Shattuck's two
hands found his sword. If ever a fighting man made a prayer to his
sword--back through strangling dark annals of unwritten history--he
made one now.</p>

<p>But this also must have been happening all at once. The blade had
turned. An invisible harper had begun to play as taut silk strings
were severed.</p>

<p>He was quick as a cat, quick as a snake, as the web dissolved
about him. He didn't suspect until then how quick he had been.</p>

<p>A glance behind him and he saw the big executioner in a final
paroxysm--kneeling, kowtowing. Still on his spraddled knees, the
executioner ducked head down to the floor and remained there in the
attitude of one of his own beheaded subjects.</p>

<p>A GLANCE into the room, and Shattuck saw that he'd shot another
man. The comrades of the man were just easing him to the floor.</p>

<p>The look of consternation on the faces of these comrades brought
him a further flash of discovery. Not one of these men was armed.
They were the kidnaping crew, meant to trap rich merchants and such
others as General Yu might invite to tea. If the men were armed, they
might injure the guest before the war-lord himself got to work--the
bloom would be gone from the peach, the torture-luxury would have
lost its quintessence.</p>

<p>Shattuck was on his feet, sword in one hand, pistol in the
other.</p>

<p>He addressed them softly.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of Shadak Khan?"</p>

<p>They had. Not a caravan had come into Minchow since they'd been
here that hadn't brought stories of Shadak Khan. Caravans were
Minchow's newspapers, its telegraph and radio.</p>

<p>"I'm Shadak Khan," said Shattuck, "And you may take your choice.
It's me--or death!"</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>"KILL! Kill!" It was the old cry of the Chinese mobs. In Chinese
it went:</p>

<p>"Dah! Dah!"</p>

<p>"Kill! Kill!"--and the hard-pressed, long--suffering people of
Minchow were shouting it now. The Agharti, Shadak Khan's new
followers, had fired them to it. But Minchow's people were already
human tinder just waiting for the match.</p>

<p>They'd seen their men murdered and their women abused, their
temple defiled and their palace--to which emperors had come to write
poems--turned into a laboratory of luxury and pain.</p>

<p>But now they dared rise. Shadak Khan had come to save them.</p>

<p>General Yu, the Green Shiver, must have heard those cries at last.
For some time he must have been hearing them--but strained fine, as
through a sieve of silence--back there in the depths of the yamen
where he was taking his repose.</p>

<p>He lay on a divan of purple satin splashed with a rich embroidery
of yellow dragons and bright green willow-trees. Before him, kneeling
on a cushion, was Laureen Macon.</p>

<p>"Are you still resolved to kill yourself," the general was asking,
"if I honor you by making you my wife?"</p>

<p>She stared at him, but did not answer.</p>

<p>"You saw that lousy beggar--that crazy man from the hills?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Would you prefer that--I marry you--to him?"</p>

<p>The general might as well have been threatening a ghost.</p>

<p>"Um-m-m!" he purred. "No answer! Did you ever hear of someone
dying under the fifty--thousand cuts? That generally makes them talk.
And my good people of Minchow would enjoy the spectacle--"</p>

<p>He reached over and touched a suspended gong.</p>

<p>"Dah! Dah!"</p>

<p>The shouting from the street had taken on a ponderous rhythm.</p>

<p>The girl herself heard it and tried to straighten up from her
kneeling position, but her knees were tied and she almost fell.</p>

<p>General Yu, with a curse, struck the gong with his fist. No one
had answered that earlier summons.</p>

<p>"Dah! Dah!"</p>

<p>It was rolling thunder, drawing nearer.</p>

<p>The Green Shiver came to his stockinged feet. He'd had his boots
pulled off and his sword-belt unbuckled when he'd entered the room.
The boots were gone, apparently, beyond recall. But he found his
sword.</p>

<p>He'd just unsheathed it when a dark figure lurched through the
doorway also armed with a sword.</p>

<p>IT was the sword that the Green Shiver recognized first--the sword
of Kubla Khan--the sword of Shadak Khan--of Captain Trouble, the
Fighting Fool.</p>

<p>Yu, the Jade Green Shiver, was a wily fighter. It was
characteristic of him that his first movement should have been to
seize the girl as a guard, as a possible hostage, a piece to be
ransomed. With her he might still ransom his life.</p>

<p>"DAH!"</p>

<p>It was Shattuck who shouted it.</p>

<p>It was as if the sword had acted of itself. It was like a shot
arrow as it sped through the Green Shiver's throat....</p>

<p>Shattuck had brought the girl to her feet and cut the silken cords
that bound her knees. He scarcely dared touch her himself. But he
could speak to her. He was telling her not to be afraid, that she was
safe, that he'd give her an escort down to the Coast.</p>

<p>THREE or four of the palace servants came in, swiftly, armed with
daggers. The daggers were red.</p>

<p>When they saw Shattuck--Shadak Khan---they bowed low.</p>

<p>"Go quickly," he commanded them, "and seek out the best women in
the palace--the older ones--and let them care for this lady. Tell
them she's--Holy!"</p>

<p>He turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she whispered.</p>

<p>She was as beautiful as an artist's dream of a holy wraith.
Shattuck felt a pang of regret at the thought of never seeing her
again. But he had work to do.</p>

<p>He knew what was happening in the town. The Agharti had stirred up
the people. The people would be butchering the soldiers of the Green
Shiver as the Green Shiver had himself just died. And even now Juma
and Champela with the Tibetan force would be headed this way.</p>

<p>He had work to do, all right.</p>

<p>"Me?" he said. "I'm no one."</p>

<p>"No one? You've been an angel to me!"</p>

<p>So Shattuck let it go at that and shepherded her out and away from
the thing that lay there sprawled on the floor.</p>
