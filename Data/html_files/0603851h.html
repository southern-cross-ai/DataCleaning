<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">1. BEWARE OF CLEOPATRA</a>
</h2>

<p>At midnight, when Marty Quade returned to his hotel after a
quiet evening, he found two telegrams waiting for him. They were
from Connecticut. The first was time-stamped 11 P.M.:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram"><span class="smcap"><tt>M. QUADE HOTEL BALTIC
NY. $600 WAITING FOR YOU IF YOU WILL BE AT MAX'S BAR OPPOSITE
RAILROAD STATION IN BRIDGETOWN AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TOMORROW EVENING.
ASK FOR SANDRA</tt></span>
</p>
<br>

<p>There was no signature to that one. The other one was
time-stamped 11:20 P.M. and read:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram"><span class="smcap"><tt>M. QUADE HOTEL BALTIC
NY. DON'T COME TO BRIDGETOWN. SANDRA MEANS YOU NO GOOD. I AM WIRING
YOU ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS CARE OF WESTERN UNION AS FEE FOR STAYING
AWAY FROM BRIDGETOWN TOMORROW EVENING. (SIGNED) MADGE</tt></span>
</p>
<br>

<p>Marty frowned at the two telegrams, and laid them back on the
desk. "I don't think these are for me, Joe," he said to the clerk.
"I don't know any Sandra, or any Madge in Bridgetown. In fact, I
don't know anybody in Bridgetown. And what's more, I don't want
to."</p>

<p>Joe Hazelton grinned. "They must be for you, Mr. Quade. There's
no other M. Quade in the hotel." He glanced through the two
messages. "They must be nice girls&mdash;Sandra and Madge. Looks
like they have money to burn. I think I'd prefer Madge, if you ask
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I won't ask you," Marty growled. He took the telegrams, left
the desk, and crossed the lobby to the Western Union counter at the
other side.</p>

<p>"Have you got a thousand dollars for me, wired from Bridgetown
by a girl named Madge?"</p>

<p>"Madge who?" asked the Western Union girl.</p>

<p>Marty shrugged. "I wouldn't know. Just Madge. Here's the
telegram."</p>

<p>"I'll look," she said. "I just came on duty, so I don't know
what's in the file."</p>

<p>She went through the remittance drawer, and came up with a
paper. "Here it is, all right. One thousand dollars to M. Quade."
She gave Marty a sly look. "Gee, Mr. Quade, the girls must
certainly go for you in a big way. She sends a thousand dollars,
and doesn't even give her last name. How will you have it? I can
give you a Western Union check, or I can give you the
cash&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on to it for a while," Marty said thoughtfully. "I don't
know yet if I want it."</p>

<p>"You mean to say you're going to turn down a thousand
dollars?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Marty told her sourly, "it's cheaper to turn down
cash&mdash;till you know what you're letting yourself in for."</p>

<p>He started away from the counter, toward the elevators. The
telegraph operator at the machine behind the girl called out: "Hey,
Mr. Quade. Here's another one for you."</p>

<p>Marty frowned, and took the form which the operator ripped out
of the machine and handed him. As he read it, his frown
deepened.</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram"><span class="smcap"><tt>M. QUADE BALTIC HOTEL
NY. DONT TAKE MADGES MONEY AND DONT BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAYS. BE
SURE TO COME TO BRIDGETOWN. I AM TOPPING HER OFFER WIRING FIFTEEN
HUNDRED JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU COME AND LISTEN TO PROPOSITION. WILL
PAY YOU PLENTY MORE IF YOU ACCEPT. (SIGNED) SANDRA</tt></span>
</p>
<br>

<p>"Gee!" said the Western Union girl, reading the form over his
shoulder. "Some people have all the luck!"</p>

<p>The telegraph operator ripped another form out of the machine
and gave it to the girl. "There's the authority to pay out fifteen
hundred dollars to M. Quade."</p>

<p>Marty scowled. "If I keep on getting telegrams," he said, "I'll
be a millionaire before morning." He waved the form at the Western
Union girl. "Hold that money, too, till I decide which I'll
take&mdash;if any." On the way to the elevator he stopped at the
desk for his key.</p>

<p>Joe grinned. "The boys are upstairs in your room, Mr. Quade.
They said it was all right for me to give them the key, that you
wouldn't mind if they used your room for a little poker game."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" said Marty. He went up in the elevator and knocked
at the door of his own room; and then opened the door.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he asked sarcastically. "Do you boys mind very
much if I disturb you?"</p>

<p>There were five of them in there; three plainclothesmen from the
local precinct house, a safe-and-loft man from headquarters, and a
sergeant from the homicide detail. A couple of times a week they
crashed Marty's room for a quiet poker game, without even asking
his permission. They had set up two bridge tables in the middle of
the floor, and they had stacks of money and highballs around the
tables.</p>

<p>"Come on, Marty," said Sergeant Gill of homicide. "We're saving
a place for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Marty said sourly. "I'd rather sleep."</p>

<p>But he took off his coat, vest and shoulder holster, draped them
over the back of a chair&mdash;and joined the game.</p>

<p>They played till four o'clock in the morning. The game would
have lasted longer, but some of the boys had to report for the
four-to-noon shift.</p>

<p>Marty left the stuff littered around the room, and started to
undress. He was just getting ready to step under the shower, when a
bellboy knocked at the door with another telegram.</p>

<p>Marty swore luridly under his breath. He gave the boy a quarter,
and read the message on the way back to the shower:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram"><span class="smcap"><tt>M. QUADE BALTIC HOTEL
NY. HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT SANDRA OUTBID ME. CANT RAISE MORE THAN
THE THOUSAND I SENT YOU SO I GUESS SANDRA WINS AND YOU'LL COME TO
BRIDGETOWN. IF YOU COME BEWARE OF CLEOPATRA (SIGNED)
MADGE</tt></span>
</p>
<br>

<p>Marty swore some more, crumpled the telegram into a ball and
threw it on the floor, took his shower and went to bed.</p>

<p>He didn't get much sleep, because at nine o'clock sharp his
telephone rang. He pawed around blindly for it, and upset an
uncorked bottle of Scotch which some one had left on the night
table. It spread beautifully over the rug, and didn't put him in
any better humor. He finally found the phone, picked it up and
growled: "What the hell do you want?"</p>

<p>"Hello," said a woman's voice. "This is Sandra. I just wanted to
make sure you're coming to Bridgetown tonight."</p>

<p>"No," said Marty. "I'm not coming." And he hung up.</p>

<p>He turned around and closed his eyes, and the phone rang
again.</p>

<p>"Hello," said another woman's voice. "This is Madge. Can I
induce you to stay away from Bridgetown tonight? I think I could
raise another thousand dollars in an hour or so, and I'll wire it
to you. That'll top Sandra's offer by five hundred."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Marty, "do you think this is an auction?"</p>

<p>"Well, I just thought if I pay you more than Sandra, you'll take
my money and send hers back."</p>

<p>"Why don't you want me to go to Bridgetown?"</p>

<p>"For the same reason that she wants you to come here."</p>

<p>"I see," said Marty. "That makes everything perfectly clear.
Send me the other thousand, and I'll promise not to come near your
damned town for the rest of my life. Goodbye."</p>

<p>Once more he hung up and went back to sleep. The next time the
phone rang, it was noon. The switchboard operator said: "Two
gentlemen are on their way up to see you, Mr. Quade."</p>

<p>"Did you say gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. They're policemen. Sergeant Gill and Inspector
Hanson."</p>

<p>Marty gave up in disgust. He got out of bed, went into the
bathroom and stuck his head under the shower. He dried quickly, and
started to dress. By the time he had his trousers on, his visitors
were knocking at the door. He let them in, and waved to the chairs
around the littered bridge tables. "Sit down. Have a drink. Make
yourselves at home."</p>

<p>"I hope we aren't disturbing you," Inspector Hanson said, not
sounding very much as if he meant it. He looked around the room,
and grunted. "I see you were having a little poker game. Anybody in
it that I know?"</p>

<p>Marty looked at Sergeant Gill, who reddened. Then Marty grinned,
as he put on his socks and shoes. "Sure, inspector. They were all
boys that you know."</p>

<p>"Well, well. No wonder you have so many inside lines to
headquarters, Quade. Might I ask who they were?"</p>

<p>"You might," said Marty. "But I might not tell you."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill breathed a sigh of relief, and flashed a smile of
gratitude to Marty.</p>

<p>Inspector Hanson grumbled. He seated himself in one of the
chairs. "All right, Quade, let's skip that. Gill and I are here on
other business."</p>

<p>"Fire away," said Marty, sliding into his shirt.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you about Felix Gildey," Hanson went on
slowly, watching Marty carefully.</p>

<p>Marty stood in front of the mirror, knotting his tie. "Gildey?
You mean the guy they're after for the Bronx payroll robbery?"</p>

<p>"Come off it," said Hanson. "You know damned well all about
Felix Gildey."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Marty. "So does everybody else. It was spread all
over the papers. Gildey's mob rubbed out a cashier and two guards,
and got away with a quarter of a million bucks in small bills. So
far, there's been no trace of him or his mob. So what?"</p>

<p>"So I have information," Hanson said heavily, "that Gildey
double-crossed his mob, and lammed with the whole two hundred and
fifty grand, leaving the rest of his boys out in the cold."</p>

<p>"I've heard that, too," Marty said. "Gildey's mob are after him,
as well as the police. But so far, he's been able to outsmart all
of them. Nobody can find hide nor hair of him."</p>

<p>"That," said Inspector Hanson, "is what we've come to see you
about!"</p>

<p>"Me?" Marty finished patting his tie into place, turned around
to face Hanson. "What have I got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"We got the dope from a stoolie," said Hanson. "That Gildey is
going to try to use you to square things up with his mob. He's
going to offer them a settlement through you. He's afraid they're
on to where he's hiding out, and he wants to buy them off."</p>

<p>"Well," Marty told him flatly, "your dope is wrong. Gildey
hasn't contacted me. What's more, I don't know where he is. And
what's more, if I knew where he was, I'd turn him in. There's a
fifty-thousand dollar reward on his head&mdash;dead or alive."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill interrupted hastily: "That's what I told the
inspector, Marty. I told him you'd never cover up for a murder rap.
I told him he's wasting his time ribbing you on it, because you'd
never lend yourself to such a thing."</p>

<p>Hanson smiled sardonically, "You have a lot of faith in Quade,
haven't you. Sergeant Gill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have!" Gill said hotly. "Marty is a friend of
mine."</p>

<p>"All right," Hanson said, getting up. "Since you're such a good
friend of his, he won't mind if you tail him. I'm assigning you to
shadow him twenty-four hours a day, from this minute on. You're a
cop above everything else, Gill. If you see anything suspicious
about Quade's actions&mdash;anything that leads you to believe he's
contacting Gildey&mdash;you'll report it. Otherwise, Gill, it would
be too bad for both of you."</p>

<p>He went to the door, and put his hat on carefully. "Goodbye, Mr.
Quade. I trust you will enjoy Sergeant Gill's company."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Marty. "This stoolie&mdash;who is he?"</p>

<p>Hanson wagged a finger at him. "Naughty, naughty. You wouldn't
want me to reveal the name of a stoolie, would you? But I'll tell
you this&mdash;he comes from Bridgetown."</p>

<p>When the door had slammed after Hanson, Marty looked at Gill.
"Johnny! Did he say&mdash;Bridgetown?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Johnny Gill nodded. "That's what he said, Marty. I
don't know who the stoolie is. It's one of Hanson's private
connections. But it's Bridgetown, all right. Hanson had a
long-distance phone call from there, a half hour ago. That's why he
came hotfooting over here."</p>

<p>Thoughtfully, Marty strapped on his shoulder holster, and
checked his automatic. The phone rang. He reached for it, saying:
"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Hello. This is Sandra. What the hell do you mean by hanging up
on me? Give me a chance to talk, will you?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead and talk," said Marty.</p>

<p>"I sent you fifteen hundred dollars. It's waiting for you at
Western Union. But I just found out that Madge is ending you
another thousand. Well, look. I'll shoot the works. I'll give you
five grand to come to Bridgetown tonight. You go to Max's bar and
ask for Sandra, and there'll be an envelope waiting for you, with
another thirty-five hundred in it."</p>

<p>"What will you want me to do for it?"</p>

<p>"Just listen to my proposition. If you don't like the
proposition, you can turn it down and go back to New York and keep
the five thousand to cover your time for coming up. If you like the
proposition, and agree to do what I want done&mdash;I'll pay you
more."</p>

<p>"How much more?"</p>

<p>"We can talk about that when you get up here."</p>

<p>"What's your last name?"</p>

<p>"We can talk about that, too&mdash;when you get up here."</p>

<p>"Who's Cleopatra?" Marty asked.</p>

<p>The woman laughed harshly. "That must be something Madge told
you in her telegram. Pay no attention to it. You have nothing to
fear from Cleopatra."</p>

<p>"All right," Marty said. "I'll be there at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>He hung up and looked at Sergeant Gill. He picked up one of the
bottles of Scotch, and poured two drinks, and gave him one of
them.</p>

<p>"I'm taking a little trip, Johnny," he said.</p>

<p>"A trip? Where to?"</p>

<p>"Bridgetown."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill almost choked over the drink. "Say! Then Hanson's
dope was right. You are mixed up with Gildey!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," Marty told him. "But I may be."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you, Marty. It's Hanson's orders."</p>

<p>"Not with me, Johnny. I'm going alone. But I can't stop you from
following me. Only don't get in my way. Give me rope."</p>

<p>"I'll give you plenty of rope, Marty," Sergeant Gill said. "I
only hope Hanson doesn't hang you with it."</p>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">2. [UNTITLED]</a>
</h2>

<p>Marty didn't like the City of Bridgetown from the moment he
stepped out of the railroad station. It was one of those newly
prosperous boom towns, humming with defense orders. On one side of
the railroad tracks there was a vast forest of spuming funnels,
sending dense clouds of smelly smoke up to the heavens from half a
hundred factories. On the other side of the tracks was the business
and residential section, alive with new stores and theatres which
were daily cropping up to cater to the swollen pocketbooks of the
town.</p>

<p>Even the circus had come to town. A huge billboard on the side
of a tall building announced:</p>

<p class="sign">Last Two Weeks<br>
ESTERHAZY'S MAMMOTH CIRCUS<br>
42 ATTRACTIONS<br>
42 UNDER ONE ROOF<br>
160 TRAINED ANIMALS<br>
36 ACROBATS<br>
24 CLOWNS<br>
A FULL EVENING OF FUN<br>
60c&mdash;75c&mdash;$1.00 at the COLISEUM!</p>
<br>

<p>Down at the next corner from the railroad station, Marty saw a
glittering electric sign of the circus.</p>

<p>Marty didn't like the smell around a circus. He didn't care for
the odor of the animals, or for popcorn or peanuts, either. He
scowled and started across the street toward a sign on the opposite
side which said:</p>

<p class="sign">MAX'S&mdash;NUFF SAID!</p>

<p>But some one tapped him on the shoulder and said: "Hi, Pal."</p>

<p>He turned around and saw a tall fellow with buck teeth and
squint eyes, who was grinning insolently. "Hi, Pal," the fellow
said again. "Stranger in town?"</p>

<p>"No," Marty said sourly. "I'm the mayor." He started across once
more, and the fellow with the buck teeth grabbed hold of his
arm.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Pal." he said. "You will tell jokes, won't you? Here's
a good joke."</p>

<p>He showed Marty what he was holding in his left hand. It was a
small, snub-nosed automatic pistol. "Very dangerous at close range,
mister. It makes a nasty hole."</p>

<p>"You don't say," said Marty.</p>

<p>"See that alley across the street, next to Max's, mister? That's
where we're going."</p>

<p>"Glad to oblige," said Marty.</p>

<p>Together they crossed the street and stepped into the alley.</p>

<p>Buck-teeth faced Marty, holding the nasty little gun chest high.
He was so tall that he towered far above Marty. "Now we can talk,
mister. I will tell you a few jokes."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Marty. "I'm always ready for a laugh."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Your name is Quade, and you come from New York,
and the dope is that you're gonna contact Felix Gildey."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Marty. "Do you know any more jokes?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Buck-teeth. "The joke is that you are going to take
me and a couple of the boys to this place where you are to meet
Gildey, because we are very anxious to tell him a couple of jokes
of our own."</p>

<p>"I see," said Marty. "You must be one of the mob that knocked
off that payroll in the Bronx, eh?"</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, I am not saying yes and I am not saying no.
But I am asking you&mdash;are you going to do what I ask, or are
you going to give trouble?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Marty, "that I will give trouble."</p>

<p>He kicked Buck-teeth in the right shin, and at the same time he
chopped down with the edge of his left palm upon the right wrist of
the gunman.</p>

<p>The double result was instantaneous, synchronized, and entirely
satisfactory. Buck-teeth jumped, yelled with pain, and dropped the
snub-nosed automatic, all at the same time.</p>

<p>Marty smiled thinly, and drove a hard right up against
Buck-teeth's chin, then followed it with a smashing overhand blow
square into his face. He drove the gunman's head backward, so that
it smacked against the wall of the building. The resulting thwack
had a wicked sound, but Buck-teeth did not hear it at all. He was
in no condition to hear anything. His eyes just closed, and his
lanky body slid down along the wall, like a puppet whose master has
let go of the strings.</p>

<p>Marty rubbed his knuckles, and bent down and picked up the
automatic. He wrapped it carefully in a handkerchief and started to
put it in his pocket. And just at that moment, he felt a cold chill
run up his spine.</p>

<p>Something warm and wet and rough was rubbing against the back of
his hand.</p>

<p>Marty Quade had lived a pretty hard life, and he had had plenty
of strange things happen to him. He had schooled himself to resist
any impulses to panicky action. But this time he had the greatest
difficulty in keeping himself from jumping away from that spot,
fast. He knew that something was licking his hand. But he also knew
very well that it was no animal of the domestic variety. He had
owned a Great Dane once, and he knew just how it felt to have his
hand licked by a Great Dane. He was familiar with the feel of a
dog's tongue.</p>

<p>This was no dog's tongue.</p>

<p>He didn't pull his hand away. He kept it there, with the wet,
warm tongue licking at it, and forced himself to turn around
slowly.</p>

<p>And for the first time in a long and active life, Marty Quade
didn't know what to do next.</p>

<p>His hand was being licked by a great, green-eyed, tawny
lion.</p>

<p>Marty had read about lions, but he had never seen one outside of
a cage. This was no good at all. He had heard that if you showed
fear and ran away, a lion would catch you in a single leap and bite
a nice morsel out of your jugular vein. On the other hand, if you
stayed where you were, the lion might take the same notion.</p>

<p>This particular lion seemed to like the flavor of Marty's hand.
And suddenly Marty realized the reason why. It was the hand where
he had skinned his knuckles on Buck-teeth's incisors, and there
were little flecks of blood there. It was the blood that the lion
was enjoying.</p>

<p>Marty started to withdraw his hand. The lion growled deep in its
throat, raised green eyes to him, baring its teeth.</p>

<p>Marty felt cold sweat along the nape of his neck. But he didn't
run. Running would be useless, and besides he had always made it a
rule never to turn his back on danger. So he balled up his left
fist, and smacked the lion square in the nose.</p>

<p>At the same time he said: "Scram!"</p>

<p>The lion's growl died in its throat, then changed to a whine. It
backed away from Marty, still whining, and turning its head away so
as to keep its nose out of line with Marty's fist.</p>

<p>And suddenly, Marty heard the light tattoo of feet pattering
toward him from the rear of the alley. A girl came running into
view. Even in the semi-gloom, it was easy to see that she was the
most lovely thing to be found in Bridgetown. She was no more than
five foot four, and very slim, with gorgeous auburn hair struggling
to squeeze out from under a stiff-visored cap. She was wearing a
tight-fitting jacket over a red sweater. The jacket had silver
buttons which glittered in the darkness.</p>

<p>Her skirt was red, to match the sweater, and barely came down to
her knees. A whistle was hanging from her neck by a silver chain,
and she carried a whip in her right hand.</p>

<p>She spotted the lion at once, and called out frantically: "Cleo!
Down, Cleo!"</p>

<p>The lion was still crouching as far away as possible from Marty,
and whining louder than ever.</p>

<p>The girl came up short, abreast of Marty, and said angrily: "You
brute! What have you done to Cleo?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Marty. "I just socked him in the nose."</p>

<p>"Oh, you&mdash;you brute!"</p>

<p>"Now listen, sister," Marty said exasperatedly, "if this is your
lion, take him away. What did you want me to do&mdash;stand here
and let him chew me up?"</p>

<p>"It's a her&mdash;not a him," the girl said. "And Cleo is
trained. She would never chew anybody."</p>

<p>"You should put a sign on her then. How did I know?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," the girl said, suddenly contrite. "Cleo got out of
her cage. I chased her all the way from the Coliseum, and I wasn't
sure which alley she'd gone into&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, as her eyes lighted on the crumpled figure
of Buck-teeth. "Oh! Did&mdash;did Cleo kill him?"</p>

<p>Marty chuckled. "I thought you said Cleo was harmless?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. She has teeth&mdash;and claws. If she's
annoyed&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl knelt beside Buck-teeth, and Marty chuckled again:
"Don't worry about him. I'm responsible for him. Cleo hasn't hurt
anybody. Who are you&mdash;the animal trainer?"</p>

<p>She gave him an angry look. "I'm the lion tamer." She got up
from beside Buck-teeth's body, and got a grip on the lion's collar.
"Come on, Cleo. We're going home."</p>

<p>She started off at a lope toward the rear of the alley, with the
lion running at her side like a mastiff, reaching almost to her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hey, wait a minute," Marty called. "Is that lion's name
Cleopatra?"</p>

<p>"That's right," she called back. "And I'm Madge, Come up and see
us some time. The best seats are a dollar ten!" And then she was
gone.</p>

<p>Marty stared after her for a moment, and then suddenly began to
chuckle. "Madge, eh?" he whispered. "Not bad. I wonder if you're
the baby who signed the telegrams&mdash;"</p>

<p>He heard some one coming into the alley from the street, and
swung around. He recognized the broad-shouldered figure of Sergeant
Johnny Gill. "Oh, it's you!" said Marty Quade.</p>

<p>"I followed you off the train," said Johnny, "and saw you talk
to that lanky guy, and cross the street with him. I started across
after you, but the traffic light changed, and I got stuck."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Marty. "Always obey the law. Never cross
against the light."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill came further into the alley, his eyes blinking
against the comparative darkness of the alley. "What happened to
that lanky guy&mdash;" He swallowed the rest of the sentence as he
stumbled over the dark pile at his feet, which was Buck-teeth.
"Hey&mdash;what's this?"</p>

<p>"That's what happened to him," said Marty, catching the
sergeant's arm and steadying him. "Don't worry. It's not
catching."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" Gill asked.</p>

<p>Marty Quade took out the snub-nosed automatic, still wrapped in
the handkerchief, and gave it to him. "Here's your chance to earn
yourself a promotion, Johnny, and put one over on the Bridgetown
police. Take him down to headquarters. Say you made the arrest.
Have him fingerprinted. I think you'll find that he's one of the
guys that participated in the Bronx holdup."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;he's one of Felix Gilders gang?"</p>

<p>"Could be."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill bent forward and brought his face close to
Quade's. "Look here, Marty&mdash;then it's true, what Hanson
said&mdash;about you being mixed up with Gildey?"</p>

<p>"Never think it, my friend. Don't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I trust you," Gill said doubtfully, "but you pull such
awful fast ones."</p>

<p>"Take my word for it, Johnny, that if I run into Felix Gildey, I
won't protect him from the law. You ought to know me well enough
for that. You even stood up for me to Hanson. Didn't you tell
Hanson you didn't believe I'd ever protect a murderer?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then play along with me. I have a hunch you're going to
come out of this with a lieutenant's stripes, Johnny."</p>

<p>"And I might get broke, too&mdash;put back on a beat. You could
have the wrong hunch, you know."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Marty Quade. "It's the chance you have to
take, Johnny. Nobody ever got anywhere by playing it close to his
vest."</p>

<p>"Okay, Marty!" Sergeant Gill said decisively, "To play ball with
you&mdash;all the way! What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Take this lug down to the Bridgetown police headquarters, and
have him held for the New York police as a fugitive from justice.
Wire New York for extradition warrants for Gildey and every one of
his mob that's known by name, so if this one turns out to be among
them, you can take him back. And tell nobody where I am, or what
I'm doing."</p>

<p>"Okay;" said Johnny Gill. "And where can I get in touch with you
later?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea. Stick close to headquarters, and
I'll try and give you a call. Now give me two minutes to get out of
this alley, then do your stuff."</p>

<p>He pressed Gill's hand, and slipped out of the alley and into
the street. He threw a quick glance to the right and left, made
sure no one was watching him especially, and stepped into the
entrance of Max's&mdash;Nuff Said.</p>

<p>It was two minutes of seven on the electric clock above the bar.
The place was of medium size, with a bar in the front part, and
tables in the rear. It was a long bar, and there were almost a
dozen people at it, being served by a single bartender.</p>

<p>Marty stepped up and said: "Scotch&mdash;and the envelope."</p>

<p>The bartender had a bushy head of hair like a Russian violinist,
and a scraggly moustache like the Count of Monte Cristo's before he
visited the barber. He squinted at Marty from under thick, uncombed
eyebrows, and said: "Scotch and&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"The envelope," Marty told him. "The envelope from Sandra."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;ho!" said the bartender, in a voice like a foghorn. "So
you're the guy Sandra's gonna meet. You're Quade, ain't you? Marty
Quade from New York!"</p>

<p>Marty glowered at him. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Jones. Sidney Jones. Glad to know you, Mr. Quade."</p>

<p>"You're a nice, discreet guy, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I never blab."</p>

<p>"No. You don't blab. You shout."</p>

<p>"What's that? I'm a little hard of hearing. Ever since the cops
clouted me around five years ago."</p>

<p>"What did they clout you around for?"</p>

<p>"I used to be a knife thrower in the circus. Esterhazy's
Circus&mdash;the same one that's in town now. I used to throw
twelve knives at a girl. Well, one night I threw eleven of them,
and the twelfth one I missed."</p>

<p>"You mean the knife hit the girl?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. It was a tough break. She had just got engaged to be
married to one of the aerial trapeze artists. The knife got her
right in the heart, and killed her"&mdash;he snapped his
fingers&mdash;"like that!"</p>

<p>"Accident?" Marty asked.</p>

<p>"Sure. Sure it was an accident. But the cops, they had queer
ideas. They said I did it a-purpose, because the girl had turned me
down for the aerial trapeze artist. They took me downtown and
grilled me for ten hours, and boy they smacked me around. Ever
since then, I don't hear so good."</p>

<p>"Then they let you go?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. I had to stand trial, and the jury hung up. They
couldn't agree. So the D.A. gave up in disgust, and never tried the
case again."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Marty.</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? I didn't get it."</p>

<p>"Skip it," said Marty. "Where's the scotch? Where's the
envelope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure. Sure." Sidney Jones produced a bottle and a glass,
and while Marty poured himself a drink he dug under his apron and
brought out an envelope which he slid across the counter.</p>

<p>Marty took it and put it in his pocket without even opening it,
and downed the whiskey.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Mr. Quade," some one said at his elbow. "Don't you
even bother to count your fees?"</p>

<p>Marty turned around and looked at the woman who had come up
alongside him. His eyes reflected grudging admiration. She was no
whit less beautiful than the girl he had just talked to in the
alley. But she was taller, and older. Perhaps five years older. Her
hair was not auburn, but glistening platinum. Yet her features were
disturbingly similar to Madge's. So much so that Marty was almost
certain at first glance that they were sisters.</p>

<p>"So you're Sandra?" he said.</p>

<p>She was studying him, from under half-lowered lashes. She was
wearing a light cloth coat around the curving lines of her tall and
slender body.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Sandra." She shook hands, and her coat fell open. She
was wearing skin tights.</p>

<p>She smiled, and picked up the drink which Sidney Jones had
placed before her. "Here's luck!" she said.</p>

<p>Marty shrugged, poured himself another tumblerful, and drank
with her.</p>

<p>"All right, Sandra," he said. "What's your proposition?"</p>

<p>She studied him for a moment longer, as if trying to decide the
best way to appeal to him. Then she picked up her purse from the
bar, opened it, and showed him that it was packed full of
money.</p>

<p>"I'll pay you ten thousand dollars more," she said deliberately,
"to be a clown at tonight's circus performance!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">3. DRESSED TO KILL</a>
</h2>

<p>Marty put his glass down on the bar. "It was nice knowing you,
Sandra. Look me up sometime, when you get to New York&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait. Don't go. I'll pay you more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Sandra. It so happens that I'm a private detective. I
don't take odd jobs of being a circus clown&mdash;even at fifteen
grand a night."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," she said. "This isn't just an odd job.
This is"&mdash;she paused, coming closer to him so that he could
smell the perfume of her hair&mdash;"this is a matter of life and
death. I could have got a dozen men to take the job for tonight,
for five or ten dollars. But I wanted you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the clown whose place you will take tonight is in
danger of death. Some one will try to kill him tonight. Some one
with a gun will take a shot at him from among the audience. I want
you to wear that man's clown costume, and I want you to be ready
with your gun. I want you to spot the person who will try to
shoot&mdash;and to kill that person!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Marty. "I begin to see. And who is this person whose
place I'm to take?"</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes. "My&mdash;my&mdash;husband." Then she
hurried on, as if to avoid his asking further questions. "I told
you, I could have hired any number of men to take his place
tonight, and whoever took the job, would be murdered, in
my&mdash;my husband's stead. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that wouldn't be enough," Marty said, watching her out of
narrowed eyes. "You want the potential killer
removed&mdash;permanently. So that he'll no longer be a threat,
eh?"</p>

<p>She nodded, without speaking.</p>

<p>Marty grinned. "All right, Sandra, suppose you break down. Open
up."</p>

<p>She fumbled with the empty glass on the bar, avoiding his gaze.
Then she started to talk, in a half monotone. "I'm Sandra
Esterhazy. My father died last year, leaving the whole circus to my
sister and myself. Madge is my sister. She handles the
lion&mdash;taming act, and I do the tightrope number. We own the
circus now, half and half. I was married two years
ago&mdash;secretly. I didn't dare tell dad, because he disapproved
of&mdash;of the man I married."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" Marty asked. "The man you married?"</p>

<p>She laughed, with a forced note. "Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he told her. "It matters."</p>

<p>"His name is&mdash;Frank&mdash;Gray."</p>

<p>"Frank Gray, eh? All right. Go ahead. Who wants to kill
this&mdash;Frank Gray?"</p>

<p>"We don't know. It's some secret enemy. Some one who must bear a
grudge against him out of the past."</p>

<p>"How do you know they're going to try to kill him tonight?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was tipped off."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, still not looking directly at him. At
last, she said swiftly: "It was an anonymous telephone call."</p>

<p>"Uh huh. And where's this Frank Gray&mdash;this husband of
yours?"</p>

<p>"He went out of town. I made him promise to lie low till the
danger was over."</p>

<p>"And you want me to take his place? You want me to be the target
for some rifleman in the audience?"</p>

<p>Now she faced him. "Yes. That's what I want you to do. I read in
the papers about you. I've heard you talked about. They say you
take the damndest cases and the damndest risks&mdash;as long as
you're paid well enough. All right, I'm willing to pay you well.
Very well. If ten thousand isn't enough, say how much."</p>

<p>Marty smiled thinly. "My life is all I've got. I'll risk
it&mdash;against all you've got. Nothing less."</p>

<p>"All right," she said. "I own a half interest in the Esterhazy
Circus. I'll turn it over to you. But&mdash;but suppose you
fail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;suppose I don't kill that marksman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If I don't kill him," Marty told her, "he'll kill me. In that
case, we'll put a clause in the contract that the half interest in
the circus reverts to you."</p>

<p>"It's a bargain!"</p>

<p>"Let's go over to a table, then. You can write out the
assignment, and our friend, Sidney Jones, can witness it."</p>

<p>It took only fifteen minutes for her to write it out, at Marty's
dictation, and for Jones to attest their signatures. Marty folded
the document, put it in his pocket, and gave her a sour smile. "All
right, Sandra. You've hired yourself a clown for the night."</p>

<p>"Come on," she said nervously. "It's a quarter of eight. The
performance starts in a half hour."</p>

<p>"What's your circus worth?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand dollars. But there's a mortgage on it for
sixty thousand. So Madge and I have an equity of forty thousand.
That makes my half worth twenty. That's what I'm paying you for
shooting straight tonight."</p>

<p>"It's a high price, Sandra. You must have a lot to gain by
keeping your husband alive&mdash;and killing his enemy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Your husband a rich man?"</p>

<p>"He has&mdash;resources," she said evasively.</p>

<p>"What kind of resources? Cash?"</p>

<p>She looked at him queerly. "Just what are you driving at?"</p>

<p>"Sister," said Marty, "you must take me for an awful sap."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I'm wondering why you're willing to give up
your interest in the circus? Don't you think I'm figuring that you
have more to gain this way&mdash;far more?"</p>

<p>"Sure you are. But you don't care&mdash;as long as you get
yours."</p>

<p>"I might care. I might be interested in just how much this
husband of yours has in cash. The exact figure might be very
interesting. Let's say it's a quarter of a million dollars."</p>

<p>Her face was suddenly white. "What made you mention that
sum?"</p>

<p>"And suppose that your husband's name isn't Frank Gray at
all&mdash;but Felix Gildey."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"I'm only saying it," Marty told her imperturbably, "because I
want to play fair with you. Fairer than you're playing with me. I
want you to know that I'm taking this job, and I'll go through with
it. But after it's over&mdash;if I'm alive&mdash;I'm going after
Felix Gildey. I'm going to get him, and turn him in. Is that fair
warning?"</p>

<p>Her eyes were veiled, her body tense and strained. "I don't know
what you're talking about!"</p>

<p>Marty shrugged. "Have it your way. Let's go."</p>

<p>They got up and went out of Max's. The calculating eyes of the
bushy-haired, mustached Sidney Jones followed them all the way out
to the street...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">4. BIG-TENT TREACHERY</a>
</h2>

<p>At eight-fifteen, Marty Quade stood in front of a mirror and
surveyed himself, and said: "Oh, hell. I was a sucker to go into
this!"</p>

<p>Sandra Esterhazy finished buttoning his clown's costume up the
back for him, then came around in front and put the finishing
touches to his makeup, with a brush from the dressing table. The
white covered his entire face, and the red dabs which she painted
on, across his forehead, under his eyes and down his cheeks made
him feel like nothing human.</p>

<p>He said: "I never realized what a circus clown has to go through
to make himself up."</p>

<p>Sandra Esterhazy didn't answer. She had discarded her coat while
she worked over his face. Finishing with the makeup, she helped him
on with his boots.</p>

<p>Marty asked: "What about this marksman&mdash;did you find out
how he expects to pick your husband out of twenty-four clowns?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You're wearing my husband's costume. It has these red
tassels on the shoulders. That's how the killer will know
him&mdash;I mean, you."</p>

<p>A bugle began to blow out in the arena, and Sandra said
hurriedly:</p>

<p>"There's the first signal. The parade of clowns starts in ten
minutes. Better hurry!"</p>

<p>Marty nodded, suddenly grim. He picked up his automatic from the
dressing table, and palmed it. "Here we go!" he said.</p>

<p>Sandra came up close to him. "I hope you kill him," she
said.</p>

<p>Marty grunted. "And you also hope he kills me, don't you?"</p>

<p>She put her arms around his neck, and pressed her lips hard
against his. Then she took her lips away, and looked up into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, Marty," she whispered. "I hope he kills you!"</p>

<p>Then she dropped her arms, and stepped back.</p>

<p>Marty said nothing. He turned and walked out of the dressing
room.</p>

<p>He made his way through a crowd of acrobats, trapeze performers,
aerial bicyclists, Japanese jugglers and Hindu snake-charmers, and
then hurried past the cages of the trained seals, the tigers and
the lions. He passed the cage of Cleopatra, and she suddenly raised
her paws, slapping against the bars, and growled at him. He stopped
in front of the cage and looked at her. She kept on growling, and
bared her teeth, as if her dearest desire were to rip him to
pieces.</p>

<p>Marty scowled under his clown disguise. Madge had said that
Cleopatra wouldn't harm anyone. And Cleopatra had certainly
knuckled under to him. But now she seemed different. She seemed
imbued with a kind of animal hate which he couldn't understand. He
stepped a little closer to the bars, and some one called out:</p>

<p>"Get away from that cage, you vicious beast!"</p>

<p>He turned around, and saw Madge Esterhazy, still attired in her
neat and natty uniform. Her beautiful, youthful face was flushed
with anger as she ran toward him, brandishing her whip.</p>

<p>"Get away from that cage, you beast!" she repeated. "Get away,
or I'll whip you!"</p>

<p>Marty looked at her, amazed. She was even more appealing in her
anger than she had been in the alley. But he couldn't understand
it.</p>

<p>She kept about ten feet away from him, holding the whip up above
her head, ready to slash at his face. "I've warned you about
tormenting Cleo," she said. "I mean it. You're a vicious beast,
worse than any of these animals. Now get away!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy," Marty said. "Where did you get the idea that I
was a vicious beast who tormented animals?"</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, Cleopatra abruptly ceased her
growling, and began to whine. The change in the lion was so
startling that Marty might have wondered about it, if he didn't
suddenly have something even more interesting to wonder about. That
was the change in Madge Esterhazy's manner.</p>

<p>Her mouth opened as if she were about to speak, but she said
nothing. She let the whip slowly down, and came closer to him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you were some one else," she said. "You're
wearing his costume."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Marty. "I'm not Felix Gildey."</p>

<p>Madge's face was suddenly white and strained. "Who&mdash;who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm the man you met in the alley this evening," he told her.
"You invited me to come and see you and Cleo, so here I am."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that costume?"</p>

<p>"From your sister."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Then you're taking my brother-in-law's
place!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm Marty Quade. Remember me? You tried to give me a
thousand dollars last night."</p>

<p>Her eyes were wide with consternation. "You're Marty Quade! Why
didn't you say so when you talked to me in the alley?"</p>

<p>He chuckled. "You didn't give me a chance. Remember, you and
Cleopatra walked out on me."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I'd only known who you were!" She put an impulsive hand
on his arm. "You mustn't go out there in the arena, Mr. Quade.
You'll be killed!"</p>

<p>Cleopatra, in her cage, seconded her mistress's appeal with a
gentle little whine.</p>

<p>Marty turned and looked at the animal. "So you like me just a
little, don't you, old girl?"</p>

<p>The lioness stuck her muzzle between the bars. Marty stroked her
nose. He smiled at Madge, his eyes appreciating the petite
slenderness of her figure, which was done ample justice by the cute
little costume she wore.</p>

<p>"Why did you want to buy me off from coming here, Madge?"</p>

<p>"Because I didn't want an innocent man killed in my
brother-in-law's stead. I knew what Sandra was planning to do. And
I didn't want blood on my sister's hands."</p>

<p>"What was she planning to do?"</p>

<p>"She's doing it now, I see," Madge said bitterly. "She's sending
you out there to be killed in my brother-in-law's place. She's
hoping that you'll kill the assassin. But you haven't got a
chance."</p>

<p>"It's Felix Gildey's old mob that's after him, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Marty Quade. I don't know who's after him. I only
know you'll be shot to death if you go out there."</p>

<p>He showed her his automatic. "Not if I see the guy first."</p>

<p>He put a hand on her shoulder. "Madge, you knew all along that
the man your sister was married to was Felix Gildey. Why didn't you
notify the police?"</p>

<p>She shuddered. "I didn't dare. I was afraid of what he'd do to
Sandra&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's Gildey hiding out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He was hiding out here in the circus till
yesterday, passing himself off as a clown, and sleeping in Sandra's
dressing room at night. But when he learned that his old gang had
caught up with him, he disappeared. He used to spend his idle time
torturing the animals. Cleo was his pet victim. He'd stand outside
her cage with a slingshot, and pelt her with pebbles. She hates
him. That's why she growled at you just now. She recognized the
costume."</p>

<p>"Does she know him when he's not in costume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I&mdash;I had even thought of letting Cleo out
of her cage when he was around. It would have been the end of
him."</p>

<p>Outside in the arena, the bugle sounded a second time.</p>

<p>Madge's eyes widened. "That's the final signal for the parade of
clowns. That's your cue!"</p>

<p>Marty nodded. "Here I go."</p>

<p>"Heaven help you!" she said.</p>

<p>He left her, and reached the runway leading to the arena just as
the last of the clowns were passing through. He joined the end of
the procession, but kept a respectable distance between himself and
the others. He didn't want the hidden marksman up there among the
spectators to hit one of the other clowns by mistake. They weren't
being paid to be human targets.</p>

<p>The other clowns fell into their usual routine, pirouetting,
doing handstands and somersaults, parading in trick costumes to
represent wheelbarrows, elephants, and whatnot. But Marty Quade
walked sedately behind them, with the automatic palmed in his right
hand, and his eyes surveying the sea of faces above the arena.</p>

<p>Among all those spectators who looked down now upon the antics
of the clowns, there was one who had not come for pleasure, but for
the grim business of murder. Where was he? From what side would the
single shot come?</p>

<p>Marty felt prickles along his spine as he moved out into the
center of the arena.</p>

<p>A small group of clowns got together and did a complicated
acrobatic stunt, which ended in all of them tumbling to the sawdust
in a tangled, comical heap.</p>

<p>Marty paid no attention to them. He kept moving around along the
edge of the arena, watchfully, his eyes fixed on the opposite
stands. By keeping close to the edge he obviated to some degree, an
attack from the back, for if the marksman were in the seats
directly above him, the man would have to stand up and aim
downward. He would thus have a difficult shot, and at the same time
attract the attention of the other spectators.</p>

<p>The Master of Ceremonies, attired in a gorgeous ruffled uniform,
waved his hand in signal, and the trumpeter raised his instrument
to his lips. A long, shrill note blasted from it, signaling the
clowns to retire so that the first of the circus acts could go
on.</p>

<p>Marty Quade knew that this would be the moment. A shot at this
particular instant would be partly drowned by the notes of the
trumpet. His eyes darted along the stands, seeking for a glint of
metal which would betray the position of the marksman.</p>

<p>And just then, a woman's shriek sounded loud and shrill, above
the blare of the trumpet.</p>

<p>The shriek came from the stands directly behind Marty, and above
him. He acted without a moment's hesitation. Instead of turning to
see what had caused the woman to scream, he threw himself headlong
to the ground, hugging the framework of the stands.</p>

<p>Something whined past him, and a bullet ploughed into the ground
at the very spot where he had been standing. Thanks to that woman's
shriek, he had been warned in time. No doubt she had seen the
marksman standing up to take aim.</p>

<p>Marty sprang up again, almost before the rolling echo of the
high-powered rifle shot had had a chance to gather volume, and
raised his automatic, swinging toward the stands. He saw a milling
throng of men and women spectators up there in the fifth row,
frantically struggling to get away from one man who was standing on
his seat, with a smoking rifle in his hand. The audience had
cleared a space all around that man. He was a stocky fellow with a
bullet head, close-cropped. He was turning now, brandishing his
rifle at the crowd, preparatory to making his getaway. But he saw
Marty come to his feet, and swiftly raised the rifle for another
shot.</p>

<p>Marty's clown face remained impassive, never twitching. He just
extended his right arm, with the automatic gripped in his hand, and
pointed at the rifleman. Then he pulled the trigger. His automatic
blasted once.</p>

<p>The rifleman's arms flew up into the air, the long weapon slid
from his grasp, and he went toppling off the bench. His body fell
athwart the bench in front, and he lay, lifeless, with his head
hanging down.</p>

<p>The echoes of the two shots&mdash;the long, whining bark of the
high-powered rifle, and the deep&mdash;throated blast of Marty's
automatic&mdash;mingled and rolled back from the vaulted roof in a
thunderous blend of violence, only to be dwarfed by the sudden
rising wave of screaming hysteria which swept the huge auditorium.
The audience was on its feet as one man, gripped by the excitement
of witnessing sudden death in all its bleak finality. They saw,
hanging across the seat there, a man who, a moment ago had been
living and vibrant and dangerous, and who was now nothing but a bag
of bones and blood for the dissecting scalpel of the coroner.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the hysterical frenzy, one man made his way
unobserved out of the arena. That man was Marty Quade.</p>

<p>At that moment, Marty felt no particular sense of elation, of
victory, of accomplishment. He had risked his life and fought for a
cause for which he had no sympathy. True, that man he had just
killed had been a member of a vicious gang, hunted for robbery and
cold-blooded murder. The man had deserved to die. But now that he
was dead, Marty was no nearer the end of this strange case of
obscure motives and hidden hatreds.</p>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">5. THE SLEUTH SHOWMAN</a>
</h2>

<p>Sandra Esterhazy was waiting for him as he came out of the
arena. He had torn the red tassels off the shoulders of his
costume, so that now he was indistinguishable from half a dozen of
the other clowns. But she guessed his identity, and verified it by
the sight of the automatic in his hand.</p>

<p>"You killed him!" she said.</p>

<p>Marty nodded. "Yes, I killed him. Sorry I couldn't see my way to
oblige you, and get myself knocked off, too. But I guess you've
arranged for that, eh?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I know the name of your husband. Surely, Felix Gildey can't
afford to let me say what I know! Isn't he around somewhere? Isn't
he going to make a try for me?"</p>

<p>"No, no. You mustn't believe anything like that. Come. Come in
here. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>She led him toward one of the sideshow tents. It was the
knife-thrower's tent, as the sign above the flap proclaimed.</p>

<p>The people from the sideshows had all come out of their tents,
and were hurrying toward the runway to get a view of the excitement
out in the arena. Somewhere, a policeman's whistle was blowing. At
the other end of the quarters, the caged animals, aroused by the
shouting of the humans, were baying, growling,
whining&mdash;raising a cacophony of frightened animal sound which
added a weird note to the hysterical din emanating from the
arena.</p>

<p>But at the knife-thrower's tent, everything was quiet.</p>

<p>"Where's your sister, Madge?" Marty asked as he followed her
toward the tent.</p>

<p>"With the lion. She loves that damned lion. She's trying to keep
it quiet."</p>

<p>She had hold of his left hand, and she was pulling him urgently
toward the tent. As they approached the entrance, Marty thought he
spotted a flitting shadow, just inside. He slowed up, holding her
back, and raised his gun.</p>

<p>But just then, Sandra uttered a scream of fright, and threw
herself against him, pointing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Look out! The knives&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marty thought it was a trick on her part, to divert his
attention from that shadowy figure lying in wait within the tent.
But he nevertheless threw a quick glance in the direction in which
she was pointing, and he cursed under his breath.</p>

<p>Sidney Jones&mdash;the bartender and ex-knife&mdash;thrower was
there, not ten feet away from them. He had a knife in each hand,
and two sticking from his belt. His right hand was raised, in the
act of throwing one of the blades. His face was cold,
expressionless, and entirely businesslike.</p>

<p>Even as Marty looked, that knife went sailing out of Jones'
hand, straight and true for Sandra's heart.</p>

<p>And while that knife was still in the air, Jones raised the
other one and hurled it.</p>

<p>Marty thrust Sandra out of the way of that speeding blade, and
fired at the same time.</p>

<p>His bullet caught Sidney Jones high in the chest, and hurled the
knife-thrower back in an awkward somersault. Simultaneously, Marty
was conscious of the dark form from the tent looming up behind him,
with a black jack upraised above his head.</p>

<p>Marty had no time to turn, no time to ward off that sap. It
would come down on his skull with stunning force. His scalp tingled
with expectancy of the descending blow.</p>

<p>But somehow, it never landed. There was a gasp from behind him,
and the upraised arm sagged, with one of Sidney Jones's knives
sticking in it. Marty had thrust Sandra Esterhazy out of line of
that flying knife. It had missed her, but had found a mark in the
arm of the mysterious assailant in the tent.</p>

<p>The wounded man ducked back into the tent, and Marty could hear
the sounds of ripping canvas as the man cut his way out through the
rear. The fellow must have yanked the knife out of his arm to use
on the canvas.</p>

<p>Grimly, Marty started into the tent after him. But Sandra
Esterhazy threw both arms around him, clung to him tightly,
preventing him from moving.</p>

<p>"Let him go!" she gasped. "It's Felix. He has a quarter of a
million cached. I'm going to join him. We'll give you
half&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let go!" Marty barked. He broke her hold, and thrust her
away.</p>

<p>There was no use going into the tent now. That delay had given
Gildey a chance to get out. Marty sprinted around to the rear, and
caught sight of his man, running toward the animal quarters. He
started after the man, shouting: "Stop, Gildey! Stop or I'll
shoot!"</p>

<p>Felix Gildey didn't stop. He had his gun in his left hand now.
His right arm was bleeding copiously above the elbow, and he was
holding it close at his side as he ran, heading for the cages. He
thrust his left hand out behind him, and fired twice, at random.
The bullets sang harmlessly past Marty, going wide by several
feet.</p>

<p>Behind him, Marty could hear the patter of Sandra's footsteps,
following him. He slowed up and raised his automatic, aiming for
the running man's legs. But just then Gildey snapped another shot
behind him, and Marty heard a cry at his side. Sandra Esterhazy had
just come abreast of Marty, and Gildey's slug, though it was wide
for Marty, had taken her right over the heart.</p>

<p>She stumbled into Marty, spoiling his aim. Blood was spurting
from her breast, staining the flesh-colored tights a deep
crimson.</p>

<p>Marty's eyes were bleak as he caught her in his arms, and eased
her down to the ground. He was oblivious of the crowd of people who
were streaming from the arena, oblivious of what Felix Gildey was
doing, oblivious of everything but what the dying Sandra was trying
to say to him.</p>

<p>"Felix was on the spot tonight... We needed a man like you to
hold the mob at bay while we escaped in the excitement." She paused
a moment. "Then I hired Jones&mdash;to rub you out. But the
mob&mdash;hired him to"&mdash;she gasped as blood welled in her
throat, but whispered on&mdash;"to kill us both."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Sandra," said Marty. "Damned sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was gasping in his arms. But she smiled wryly, trying to
talk. "You're all right, Marty Quade&mdash;good man. Take care of
Madge. Bend down closer. I'll tell you&mdash;where Felix hid the
quarter million... In the floor&mdash;of Cleopatra's cage..."</p>

<p>Felix Gildey had taken cover behind the monkey cage, and he was
firing at Marty.</p>

<p>Marty felt Sandra stiffen in his arms. She was dead.</p>

<p>Gildey's gun roared again, and another slug whistled past
Marty's shoulder.</p>

<p>Marty gently lowered Sandra's dead body. Then he got to his
feet, his mouth tight, his eyes hard and bleak. He raised his
automatic and sent two swift shots at the corner of the monkey cage
from behind which Gildey was shooting. But Gildey had left that
corner, and was backing away. He was bent on escape. He had a clear
path behind him, with no one to block it, except for Madge
Esterhazy, who had suddenly appeared in front of Cleopatra's
cage.</p>

<p>Marty saw Madge standing there, with only her whip to protect
her against that madman brother-in-law of hers. He couldn't see
Gildey, who was entirely hidden by the high flooring of the monkey
cage. But he knew that Gildey was coming toward her, and would
surely not leave her alive when he passed. A cold blast of hate for
Gildey streaked through Marty's bones. He set out at a dead run to
get around the monkey cage for a clear shot at Gildey.</p>

<p>He could see Madge plainly, standing with her back to
Cleopatra's cage, her eyes wide upon what must be the approaching
figure of Gildey the killer. Marty saw this as he ran, and cursed
under his breath. Sandra was dead, yes. But it would be unbearable
to see that slim little Madge, cold in death as well, all the
honesty and vitality and love of life gone from her wilted
body.</p>

<p>And just then he saw Madge turn to the cage and do something
with the catch on the door, then swing it wide open.</p>

<p>Cleopatra, who had been pawing at the bars, uttered a
deep-throated roar, and launched herself out of that cage like a
comet, sailing through the air with her claws distended and her
great teeth showing.</p>

<p>Marty raced around the end of the monkey cage just in time to
see Cleopatra strike. Her hurtling feline form hit the running
Gildey square on the chest. He had fired at her as he ran. Marty
had heard the shot. But Felix had missed. Marty saw Cleopatra's
claws rake Gildey's face and chest, then saw her great teeth sink
into his jugular as all the pent-up rage and hatred of the beast
was unleashed in one deadly, savage fury of attack.</p>

<p>By the time Marty got there, Felix Gildey was past all help.</p>

<p>He got hold of Cleopatra by the collar, and dragged her off the
kill. She growled, licking her chops, but she did not resent his
handling of her.</p>

<p>Marty led the lioness over to where Madge Esterhazy was
standing, white-faced, with a hand pressed tight against her
breast.</p>

<p>"Don't cave in, kid," he said. "This is no time to crumble. Put
Cleopatra away."</p>

<p>She nodded mutely, and took hold of the lioness' collar.</p>

<p>"Put her in another cage," Marty said. "Not in this one."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is Sandra&mdash;dead?" she asked.</p>

<p>Marty nodded.</p>

<p>With her eyes almost a blank, Madge Esterhazy led Cleopatra away
to a vacant cage further down the line.</p>

<p>Marty Quade turned around in time to see a flying wedge of
bluecoats and detectives forcing their way through the crowd of
frightened spectators, with Sergeant Johnny Gill of the New York
Homicide Detail in the lead.</p>

<p>One of the detectives grabbed at Marty, and ordered: "Hand over
that gun, you!"</p>

<p>Marty grinned, and rubbed the paint off his face.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gill yelled: "Marty! It's Marty Quade!"</p>

<p>He spoke swiftly to the detective. "He's all right." Then he
turned to Marty. "What in hell's been happening here?"</p>

<p>"I think Sergeant Gill has been getting his lieutenant's
stripes," Marty said. He led Johnny Gill to one side. "This all
goes in your book, Johnny. I want none of the credit. You tell
these Bridgetown cops that you planned the whole thing, and that
you only got me in to help you, Gildey's dead, and so are at least
two of his mob. The stolen payroll is cached in the flooring of the
lion's cage over there. You can mastermind it out of there. Tell
them you had private information. Or tell them you deduced it from
clues. Anyway, it's all yours."</p>

<p>"There's a reward, Marty&mdash;fifty grand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marty waved him aside, for he saw Madge Esterhazy returning,
after having locked Cleopatra up again. She came straight to him,
and he put an arm around her and led her over to where her sister
lay dead.</p>

<p>"She made a mistake," Marty said. "She loved the wrong man. Now
she's dead. Now you're the sole owner of the Esterhazy Circus."</p>

<p>"No," said Madge. "I'm not the sole owner."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him from the shelter of his arm. "You know what
I mean, Marty Quade. You have a paper."</p>

<p>"Paper? What paper?"</p>

<p>Her eyes were misty. "Sandra told me&mdash;she gave you an
assignment of her interest in the circus. You earned it. You're a
half owner."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Marty. He took the paper out of his pocket, and
started to tear it up.</p>

<p>She swiftly put a hand over his, stopping him. "Please, Marty.
Don't tear it up. I want you to keep it. I want you for my partner.
I'd never be able to run the circus alone, now, I need the
protection of some one like you. I want to be partners with you.
You needn't spend any time running the circus. If all the crooks
and conmen and highbinders know you are part owner, they'll think
twice before trying anything. Please&mdash;be my partner."</p>

<p>Marty smiled. His arm tightened around her shoulders.</p>

<p>"All right, Madge. I'm your partner&mdash;till you don't need me
any more."</p>

<p>Johnny Gill came up to them. "Marty," he said, "that was damned
big of you, giving me credit for this catch. I was just on the
phone talking to Hanson, He's putting my name before the
commissioner for a lieutenancy."</p>

<p>"Nice going, Johnny."</p>

<p>Gill's face expressed worry. "But the Bridgetown cops insist on
sharing the reward. There won't be much left. What'll you get out
of it? Not even credit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You take the credit," Marty told him, "and I'll take the
circus!"</p>
