<h1>The Phantom Detective in...<br>
Empire Of Terror</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE - KILLERS IN BLACK</h2>

<p>The bright, dazzlingly clear Arizona sky gave no hint of the
ominous.</p>

<p>Outside the two-story frame building housing the temporary
national radio network concentrated at Rock Canyon Dam, a midday sun
gleamed brazenly down upon the several thousand sweltering,
enthusiastic citizens and officials expectantly milling about the
giant dam a half mile away.</p>

<p>Within the unpainted radio headquarters, on the second floor,
three engineers with an assistant each, and three United States Army
soldiers acting as guards under a hard-boiled infantry lieutenant,
waited alertly for the hands of the electric clock on the drab wall
to point to the hour of noon.</p>

<p>At the precise stroke of twelve the President of the United
States, broadcasting in person from Rock Canyon Dam, would dedicate
and formally open the greatest Federal irrigation project in the
history of the country.</p>

<p>Lundbalm, the stocky chief radio engineer, touched a volume dial
with tensed fingers and said over his hunched shoulder to Lieutenant
Howard in charge of the army guards:</p>

<p>"Twelve minutes to go. The Marine band is hooked in now from
Washington. It'll be hell if something goes wrong here."</p>

<p>"Nothing can go wrong," the lieutenant snapped. "This isn't the
Tennessee Valley flood disaster, if that's what you're thinking of.
We're prepared, this time. The entire section here is under guard.
It's fool-proof!"</p>

<p>A frown darkened the square face of the chief engineer, and for a
worried moment he stared grimly at the battery of signal lamps in a
panel along one wall.</p>

<p>A duplicate set of signal bulbs, a brief month ago, had given him
and the world the only warning of that ruthless devastation. Those
lamps had flared violently a minute before the public opening of the
famous Tennessee Federal power project.</p>

<p>Then the lights had shattered in the terrific, unexplained
explosion that had blasted free the pent flood waters of the vast
system and turned the valley into a torrential cataract of death.</p>

<p>That disaster, and others smaller but similar throughout the
country, it still remained unexplained. But their origin had been
traced to mysterious human hands. There, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the G-men, had run into a blank wall. They had been
stopped by a strange, impenetrable emblem&mdash;a small grey seal cut in
the shape of an hour-glass, with a crimson capital "I" drawn
perpendicularly through the stem.</p>

<p>The challenging, mystical emblem had appeared but once, pasted on
the forehead of the murdered Public Works engineer in charge of the
demolished Tennessee Valley Project. But the weird seal had started
wild, imaginative tales of terror. And ugly, mob-inspiring rumors
were persisting.</p>

<p>"I was out on that emergency Tennessee broadcast for two hellish
weeks," Lundbalm growled dourly. "It was a ghastly experience. I'll
never get over it."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't happen here!" Lieutenant Howard guaranteed flatly.
"You tend to your gadgets. I've got us all locked in this room. Leave
the protection to me."</p>

<p>Lundbalm reached for a phone. "I'll check again with Lewis over in
the main announcer's cage at the dam." He started to plug into one of
a row of connections.</p>

<p>His hand never finished the movement.</p>

<p>Behind him, from a silently opening trap in the ceiling, a
yellowish egg-shaped object dropped to the floor, cracked open with a
quick hissing sound. Instantly, an acrid, faintly greenish gas curled
swiftly upwards, filling the long room with paralyzing, blistering
fumes.</p>

<p>Lundbalm staggered back from the instrument table, his hands
clutching his throat. He stumbled against Lieutenant Howard who was
blindly trying to fire his heavy service Colt up at the hideously
masked face leering down at them through the opened ceiling trap.</p>

<p>A black-sleeved arm laced across the opening, and a knife flashed
downward through the curling, greenish vapor.</p>

<p>The raised Colt clattered to the floor from Lieutenant Howard's
fingers as the steel blade plunged hilt deep through his neck. He
fell, twisting in death, his clawing hands dragging Lundbalm's
gas-strangled body down with him.</p>

<p>Blood spurted from his throat, spilling redly over the chief
engineer's beefy back as the other radio control men and the three
heavily armed soldiers collapsed and fell where they stood.</p>

<p>Not a strangled cry had broken the swift, silent action, so
rapidly had the deadly gas choked out their lives.</p>

<p>A black-robed, hooded figure dropped quickly through the trap and
stood reaching up, his face hidden within the startlingly weird gas
mask covering his head.</p>

<p>"Hand it down!" he ordered in a terse, gratingly harsh voice.</p>

<p>The black-robed arm of a similarly hooded and masked figure
reached through the hole in the ceiling, passed a round, flat
leather-covered parcel into those extended hands. Then the second man
swung down through the opening, dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>With scarcely a glance at the ten dead engineers and soldiers
sprawled in grotesquely pitiful huddles about the room, the two robed
figures crossed wordlessly to the control switchboard. Working with
expert speed, one of them disconnected several wires while the other
opened the flat leather case, removed from it a black wax radio
recording disc.</p>

<p>The first man turned abruptly, strode directly to a far corner of
the long room, and came back carrying a standard studio electric
portable phonograph. He hooked it up to the broadcast wires he had
unfastened, glanced briefly at the wall clock, and put the black wax
record on the machine.</p>

<p>"Good timing," his rasping voice commented. "One minute to
twelve!"</p>

<p>His fingers flicked beneath his robe, came out holding a single
small grey seal. Its design was an hour-glass, and a blood-red
capital "I" was drawn upright through the stem.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly over to the body of Lieutenant Howard,
moistened the back of the strange emblem with the army officer's
blood, stuck the mysterious seal on the dead man's forehead.</p>

<p>His movements were swift, nerveless, as devoid of emotion as
though he'd merely hurriedly pasted a stamp on a letter. He stepped
back to the instrument desk, started the phonograph disc revolving,
and poised the sensitive reproducing needle above the fine outer
lines at the edge of the record.</p>

<p>"The President's uninvited ghost goes on the air in exactly
thirty-five seconds," he said with low-voiced, exultant grimness.</p>

<p>The second robed figure, standing ready with one hand on a
master-control switch, asked in a flat, dried voice:</p>

<p>"You sure we can get out of here all right?"</p>

<p>"Yellow?" Sneering contempt grated in the first man's quick,
snarling retort. "The Imperator's experts never miss! We'll walk out,
you fool, like ministering monks in the confusion when the dam
blows!"</p>

<p>Slowly, nervelessly, the needle lowered toward the ominously
whirling black record&mdash;A half mile away, at Rock Canyon Dam, the
sweltering crowds shuffled restlessly in the hot noonday sun that
beat down upon the colorful pageantry.</p>

<p>Enormous American flags draped the sheer walls of the gigantic
dam, ready to be raised majestically on gaily bannered wires when the
sluices opened at the President's pressure on an electric control
key. The President himself, with his chosen administration officials
and vigilant Secret-Service guards occupied a temporary, flag-draped
stand in a niche cut into the rock wall above the dam.</p>

<p>From the horns of the public address system the National Anthem,
played by the Marine Band in the nation's capital, swayed the eager
watchers crowding the canyon's rugged, railed rim, and poured
inspiringly from the radios of millions of listeners.</p>

<p>The Arlington-timed clock in the main announcer's cage at the near
end of the dam showed ten seconds to noon. Mort Lewis, the veteran
radio announcer, nodded to Toby, his assistant, and leaned tensely
close to his microphone.</p>

<p>As the final rousing strains of the Marine Band faded, Lewis'
clear baritone voice came over the air and through the canyon
speakers along the rocky walls:</p>

<p>"And now, ladies and gentlemen of America, the nation's Chief
Executive is about to speak from Rock Canyon Dam&mdash;the President of the
United States!"</p>

<p>A pause. Then the President's kindly, sincerely convincing voice:
"My friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without warning, the President's voice was cut off by a sharp,
amplified click.</p>

<p>For a bare fraction of a second there was a scratching sound,
followed instantly by a swift, brassy, metallic flow of startling
words:</p>

<p>"This is the Imperator of the Two Americas speaking for the
citizens of the rising Invisible Empire! Rock Canyon Dam, a futile
project of a weak, incipient government, will be destroyed by
explosives in exactly one hundred seconds. Future public disasters
will follow until the purpose of constructive anarchy has been
attained. Sixty seconds now remain before the explosion. I, the
Imperator, have spoken!"</p>

<p>The chilling, metallic voice stopped with a clipped snap that was
like a hammer blow on glass.</p>

<p>For a terrifying, suspended moment dead silence fell upon the air
and gripped the assembled officials and spectators at Rock Canyon in
a paralysis of helpless dread. Then pandemonium broke loose.</p>

<p>The crowds surged back away from the canyon's railed
rim&mdash;fighting, shouting, cursing. Army officers, soldiers and state
police rallied vainly to direct a swift, safe escape for the
hysteria-crazed mauling mob.</p>

<p>Women and children were trampled underfoot. Strong men were
knocked down by the wild, blundering rush. Screams drowned out the
frantically shouted commands of the officers.</p>

<p>Three Secret Service guards grabbed the President bodily, rushed
him back off the platform, hurried him out into a cleared roadway
where they, with the willing help of his official party, made a
white-faced, desperately protecting ring with their bodies.</p>

<p>Down on the rim of the dam, Mort Lewis shouted futilely into his
dead mike in a frantic, heroic attempt to direct the crowd caught and
jammed in the lower approaches. He waved Toby, his assistant, toward
the exit bored into the canyon wall, rushed after him at the last
second.</p>

<p>The veteran announcer was three yards from the narrow exit when
the first terrific detonation rocked the canyon from deep in the
bowels of the mighty dam. The rock walls trembled.</p>

<p>He stared down, hypnotized into rigidity by the enormous
snake-like cracks appearing in a patternless maze across the solid
face of the man-made water barrier. The greenish expanse of
imprisoned flood, extending for miles back of the dam, rippled and
shuddered.</p>

<p>And suddenly, as a second shock reverberated, Lewis' widened eyes
narrowed on the black-hooded, cloaked figures emerging from a leaking
sluice slot at the dam's base, running for shelter. A moment later,
with three more thunderous explosions shattering the masonry, the
center of the dam split open into an enormous, writhing V.</p>

<p>A harsh, angry roar arose drowning out the rumble of the rocking
blasts, and the strangled water poured through the split, tearing
away huge pieces of the dam, widening the vital opening.</p>

<p>The two fleeing black-robed figures disappeared, whirled away in
the first rush of the flood that blotted out the power houses and
buildings at the foot of the dam as though by, magic in a hellish
cataract of thundering destruction.</p>

<p>The churning water rushed on, sweeping everything in its path. The
helpless spectators, workmen and soldiers caught beneath the rising
tide of the whirling, serpentine monster of death, were gone like
straws, their despairing cries lost utterly in the horrifying roar of
the plunging flood.</p>

<p>Mort Lewis swayed dizzily, leaped for the dangerous safety of the
narrow exit at the end of the completely crumpling dam. He lunged
halfway through the tunnel opening, was knocked down as part of the
wall gave way.</p>

<p>Rocks and shale pounded down on his twisted legs, pinioned him
helplessly to the stone floor. He lay there writhing, sweating in
agony, while behind him the snarling torrent drowned out his
shouting, fading voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO - RED WARNING</h2>

<p>Lowering purplish storm clouds had hovered menacingly over New
York City all day, seemingly caught and held stationary by the sharp
spires and pinnacles of the towering skyscrapers. At three o'clock in
the afternoon the storm hadn't broken yet, and the spasmodic rumble
of thunder was just beginning to become annoying over radios in
crackling static.</p>

<p>But it wasn't storm interference that broke in upon the swing
music floating from the hidden radio in the large Moorish reception
room of the stately Fifth Avenue residence of Mr. Frank Havens, the
nationally known publisher. It was the announcer's smooth voice
cutting in from Radio City:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, through the facilities of the National
Broadcasting Company, you are about to hear the President of the
United States speak from Rock Canyon Dam, Arizona, where he will
formally open the largest irrigation system in the world. One moment,
please&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the fading strains of the National Anthem, played by the U. S.
Marine Band, swelled into the big, gaily crowded reception room,
Muriel Havens stopped dancing and smiled whimsically up into the
lean, tanned face of Richard Curtis Van Loan.</p>

<p>"Something official like that would have to break into my
afternoon tea-dance," she protested with a little laugh, and started
to signal a butler to dial in another program.</p>

<p>Dick Van Loan stopped her with a quick shake of his head and moved
with her nearer the wide window where the radio was camouflaged in a
flower-covered wall table.</p>

<p>"Mind if I listen to him?" he asked politely, and added, "The
daughter of Frank Havens should be able to inflict the President's
voice on her guests for a few min&mdash;"</p>

<p>His bantering words broke off abruptly as his sharp eyes flicked
to the window.</p>

<p>Out across Central Park, rising high above the skyscrapers of the
Roaring Forties to the south, blinking red lights on Frank Havens'
towering Clarion Press Building gleamed now, flashing warningly,
vividly against the purplish background of foreboding storm
clouds.</p>

<p>The Phantom's signal! Neither exclamation nor tremor betrayed the
vitalizing shock that whipped Dick Van Loan's nerves into tensed
alertness. His signal&mdash;from Frank Havens&mdash;Around him the gay party
went on, heedless and merrily ignorant of the dire call. Even Muriel
Havens, the nationally powerful publisher's beautiful daughter, had
no inkling of the grim Phantom drama being signaled in by those
rapidly winking lights atop her father's Clarion tower.</p>

<p>Dick Van Loan's cryptic smile gave no hint of the driving turmoil
seething within him as he deciphered that flashing code message:</p>

<p>Calling the Phantom&mdash;Come to my office&mdash;</p>

<p>Hurry&mdash;This is a murder call&mdash;Havens&mdash;</p>

<p>Calling the Phantom&mdash;</p>

<p>The dots and dashes kept on winking ominously, would continue to
blink that secret message until the Phantom himself contacted Frank
Havens. Van Loan damned himself mentally. He'd been idling here,
dancing, unalert to that urgent message.</p>

<p>But before his brain could hit upon an acceptably logical excuse
to offer Muriel Havens for an abrupt departure, the familiar voice of
the veteran radio announcer, Mort Lewis, broke in upon his
consciousness:</p>

<p>"&mdash;From Rock Canyon Dam&mdash;The President of the United States!"</p>

<p>Then the President's warm voice: "My friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick Van Loan's eyes narrowed at the sharp click that interrupted
the President's kindly greeting.</p>

<p>The next instant, as the first chilling words of that strange
unannounced metallic voice came brassily over the air, Van stooped
low over the radio table, his tensed fingers twisting off the volume.
He motioned Muriel Havens away, dialed the icy flow of words until he
alone in the room could hear:</p>

<p>"&mdash;the Imperator of the Two Americas speaking for the Invisible
Empire. Rock Canyon Dam will be destroyed in&mdash;one hundred seconds.
Future public disasters will follow&mdash;Sixty seconds&mdash;I, the Imperator,
have spoken!"</p>

<p>Grimly, his knuckles white against the dial, Dick Van Loan spun
the volume on full as the icy metallic voice stopped with a brittle
snap that was like glass broken by a hammer blow. But now only a
vague rumbling sound and the crackle of distant static came from the
suddenly stilled station.</p>

<p>Tight-lipped, Van turned down the power to normal volume, dialed
in a dance orchestra on a minor local station, and rose to face
Muriel. No use disrupting her afternoon party with this new, grimly
spectacular radio mystery. Damage enough, that millions of listeners
had heard that dire, threatening voice.</p>

<p>"Something went wrong with the President's address," he said to
her with a convincing smile of apology.</p>

<p>"I'm a very hard-boiled stockholder in that broadcasting company,
so you won't mind. Muriel, if I run off from your very pleasant
soiree to see what's happened?"</p>

<p>How much she minded was evident in her gently veiled, disappointed
gaze as she let him go. But it was not a polite lie that Dick Van
Loan used to excuse himself from the Havens home.</p>

<p>He did own stock in the National Broadcasting Company. In a number
of other industrial corporations, too. And in Frank Havens'
coast-to-coast chain of newspapers, including the New York Clarion.
Richard Curtis Van Loan was wealthy, but not cumbersomely so.</p>

<p>But the tall, athletic Park Avenue clubman and man-about-town had
cleared his mind of Muriel's tea-dance before he reached the curb.
And he had no intention of driving first to Radio City, as he jumped
into his fast, powerful coupe. South of Central Park, the Clarion
tower lights were still flashing their urgent secret code for the
Phantom.</p>

<p>And the Phantom was answering that call! Answering it now in the
fast run of Dick Van Loan's dark blue coupe down Fifth Avenue and
across town to Eighth.</p>

<p>He parked a block from the towering Clarion Press building, but
did not immediately get out of the car. Instead, bending low in the
coupe's seat, he produced from a panel beneath him a small, compactly
equipped make-up kit.</p>

<p>Working rapidly, with swift glances of caution at the hurrying
pedestrians passing a few feet from the car windows, he began the
familiar task of disguising his features. It was an old story with
him, this quick change of character.</p>

<p>Always, when the inevitable Clarion call came to war on crime, it
was Van's deft, experienced fingers that brought the Phantom into
being again&mdash;as those sure, artistic fingers had done in the
beginning. For the Phantom was Dick Van Loan's own creation, a
product of his restless energy, his fearless demand for action, and
his determination to put his wealth and talents to the best use.</p>

<p>Van hated crime and criminals instinctively. But it was Frank
Havens, a far older man, who had shown him that always, behind the
scenes of every series of modern crimes, some one brain, some one
man, was the ruthless guiding genius, untouchable by the usual forces
of law or the police.</p>

<p>The Phantom was Richard Curtis Van Loan's answer to the death
challenge of lawlessness. The Phantom, a sinister figure without
name, without identity&mdash;more untouchable and grimly mysterious than
the slipperiest of those crooks and killer geniuses of crime whose
ravages he was fighting.</p>

<p>It was the Phantom's real identity, the identity of Richard Curtis
Van Loan behind the varied character disguises of the Phantom, that
had to be ultimately and desperately protected. Without that complete
anonymity, all the aids he used&mdash;the different character roles, the
three hideouts, his gift of ventriloquism, even the red code lights
still signalling him from the pinnacle of the Clarion Building&mdash;went
for naught.</p>

<p>Dick Van Loan slid the make-up case under the seat into its trick
compartment. But it wasn't the Park Avenue clubman who sat upright in
the coupe now.</p>

<p>The lean, tanned face had disappeared, replaced by a square
featured, sallow-skinned man twenty years older than Van Loan. The
hair was combed unbecomingly on the opposite side of the greying
head, and the eyebrows curled upward belligerently.</p>

<p>A twist of the necktie, a slip of two notches in the soft leather
belt, and an awkward, ill-fitting hitch of the grey suit coat,
rounded out the convincing picture of a rugged, aggressive but
personally sloppy and rather shopworn character of no particular
qualifications.</p>

<p>What unknown talents the character possessed, were added to by a
shoulder-holstered Colt .38 automatic, a carefully pocketed black
silk mask, a pencil flashlight, and a peculiarly designed platinum
and diamond badge.</p>

<p>It was seventeen minutes after three o'clock in the afternoon, and
the delayed storm was just beginning to spatter the pavement with the
first big drops of a heavy rain, when the Phantom, alias Jim Doran,
jammed a crumpled panama low over his eyes and faded down the street
away from the locked coupe.</p>

<p>He paused abruptly at the corner of Eighth Avenue, lighted a
cigarette as he listened to an announcer's tense voice cracking from
a loudspeaker in a radio shop doorway:</p>

<p>"Flash! The giant government irrigation project at Rock Canyon
Dam, Arizona, has just been destroyed by a series of devastating
explosions. The entire dam has been demolished and the canyon itself
is a raging torrent. Loss of life is estimated at well over a
thousand, with the toll mounting.</p>

<p>"Property damage will be incalculable until the water now sweeping
the whole Arizona valley spends itself. The President of the United
States was saved by quick action on the part of his Secret Service
guards and members of his staff. This report comes by telephone from
Phoenix, all radio facilities at Rock Canyon having been destroyed by
the disastrous explosions.</p>

<p>"A mysterious voice, cutting in upon the President's dedicatory
address at the dam a few seconds before the series of blasts,
threatened this fatal national disaster and others to follow.</p>

<p>"Federal investigators are flying to the scene. This is the first
report that has been received. More details will be broadcast as they
are relayed to us."</p>

<p>The voice stopped, and people on the street stared blankly at one
another, stunned, heedless of the increasing rain.</p>

<p>Jim Doran's squarish face became rocky, his keen grey eyes
smoldering as he strode grimly a half block north. He ducked into a
subway kiosk, came up into the Clarion Building on the other side of
the wet street.</p>

<p>The Phantom was reborn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE - SPECIAL CORPSE</h2>

<p>The editorial offices of the Clarion were on the eleventh floor
and Frank Havens had a bulletproof glass cubicle there, raised above
the floor level in a far corner.</p>

<p>But the publisher's real office was a triplex suite on the
eighty-fifth and top floors of the towering press building, reached
only by a private express elevator entered through a sliding panel in
that non-shatterable glass cubicle overlooking the editorial
rooms.</p>

<p>Turmoil and cyclonic confusion seemed to have hit the enormous
editorial office when Jim Doran stepped off the public elevator and
was stopped by the wise-eyed blond receptionist at the railing gate.
Telephones jangled, typewriters and teletypes clattered, adding to
the bedlam of excitedly shouted orders and rushing copy boys.</p>

<p>But the suspense-ridden, grinding overtones of the Clarion's
frenzied editorial department, the Phantom realized grimly, was only
a larger duplicate, of the frantic commotion occurring in every
metropolitan press editorial room in the country at this moment. The
universal, terse newspaper cry was:</p>

<p><i>Hold that Rock Canyon wire open!</i></p>

<p>"Jim Doran, to see Mr. Frank Havens," Van told the girl curtly.
Jim Doran was one of the score of names that Dick Van Loan and the
publisher had agreed upon as Phantom aliases. "Mr. Havens is
expecting me," he added as the girl at the desk hesitated.</p>

<p>She gave him a sharp, respectfully curious glance as she finished
putting through the call to Havens' quarters, and a moment later Jim
Doran was slouching through the familiar maze of editorial desks,
guided by an alert copy boy.</p>

<p>Toby, the publisher's trusted elevator guard, rode him up in the
private express car from the glass cubicle, watching him warily but
without recognition. Toby had known Richard Curtis Van Loan for some
years.</p>

<p>Van's veiled grey eyes hid his satisfaction, as the keen scrutiny
of the operator failed to catch the slightest flaw in the quick
character make-up of nondescript Jimmy Doran. Toby's shrewd, bold
eyes were always an infallible first test.</p>

<p>At the eighty-fifth floor, the swarthy operator slid back the
elevator door. Jim Doran stepped out of the car, stood a moment in
the ornately furnished reception foyer staring belligerently at the
uniformed policeman eyeing him suspiciously. Behind him, the car door
slid shut silently as Toby took the elevator down again.</p>

<p>"I'm here to see Mr. Havens," Van announced in a deep, gruff voice
that was not at all the smooth baritone of Richard Curtis Van Loan.
"Didn't expect to find you cops up here."</p>

<p>Before the policeman could question him, Judkins' tall,
bald-headed figure appeared on a balcony at one end of the room. The
publisher's confidential secretary called down to the cop:</p>

<p>"If that's Mr. Doran, send him right up, officer."</p>

<p>Van nodded to the cop, brushed past him and mounted the staircase
to the balcony.</p>

<p>Judkins' sallow glance was nervous but his worried brown eyes were
without recognition as he led Jim Doran through a doorway into a
large room that was more lounge than office.</p>

<p>"Mr. James Doran," he announced, and withdrew, closing the
door.</p>

<p>Frank Havens' penetrating gaze darted up sharply as Dick Van Loan
crossed to the wide, polished walnut desk behind which the publisher
sat drumming his fingers anxiously. Six other men, one in the uniform
of a police captain, looked up quickly from the armchair about which
they were grouped.</p>

<p>But the figure slumped in that chair did not move.</p>

<p>As Van's swift glance took in the unusual tableau, his right hand
swung across the desk toward Havens in a hearty handshake that hid
the small platinum-and-diamond badge palmed in his long fingers. The
significant emblem of a mask outlined by the brilliant gems was the
only design on the smooth platinum surface of that cryptic shield.
But it was enough.</p>

<p>Frank Havens' worried eyes glinted with recognition as Van's swift
fingers gave him, but not the others, a flashing look at that Phantom
badge. The emblem disappeared again in Jim Doran's hand.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, Mr. James Doran!" Havens said and stood up from behind
his desk. The name had weight now as he spoke it. Jim Doran was no
longer a password name, but had become a reality. "Mr. Doran will
represent me in this investigation." He nodded his grey head toward
the silent figure in the armchair.</p>

<p>Van stepped over to the armchair, his eyes on the domelike head of
the middle-aged man slumped there. A small fleck of blood stained the
fellow's white lips as the Phantom raised the lolling head and
studied the fixed expression of sheer surprise stamped on the dead
man's face.</p>

<p>Rigor mortis had not yet set in, and there were no visible marks
of violence on the neatly dressed body.</p>

<p>"This wants some preliminary explaining," Jim Doran grumbled. "I
didn't think anybody'd be interested in just one corpse, after what
happened at Rock Creek Canyon."</p>

<p>"We know about that," the officer in the captain's uniform said.
"This happens to be New York City, not Arizona."</p>

<p>Van glanced up, curiously aware that Havens, in his repressed
excitement, had not named him as the Phantom, although two of the men
in street clothes were obviously homicide detectives.</p>

<p>The other three men in the room were big, well dressed
fellows. Frank Havens made the brief introductions.</p>

<p>One of the strangers was Warden Jack Bluebold of Alleghany
Penitentiary at Mountainview, Pennsylvania. The next man was Dr.
Maurice Jessup, resident surgeon at the Alleghany prison. The third
was ex-Congressman Harry Arnold, a Pennsylvania politician. The three
of them stayed close together in a compact, capable group.</p>

<p>Havens eyed the lifeless figure in the armchair, frowned and
said:</p>

<p>"Lester Gimble is&mdash;was&mdash;one of the leading metallurgists in this
country. Because I wanted an article on the subject, I induced him to
interview Dr. Waldo Junes, the famous scientist who is conducting
some unusual experiments in metals at the General Electric laboratory
at Niagara Falls. Gimble was on his way back here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Havens broke off, nodded to the plainclothes men.</p>

<p>"Simmons and me," the taller of the two dicks said, jerking his
head at his partner, "were standing in Grand Central Station near the
taxicab entrance about two-thirty this afternoon, when this fellow
Gimble shows with a suitcase and a briefcase, coming from the lower
level train platforms.</p>

<p>"He starts to get into a cab, when two guys take a shot at him
from behind. He dropped his bags and swung round. One of the gunmen
grabs up his suitcase and the other one got the briefcase. Simmons
and me opened up on 'em then and there was a hell of a lot of racket
and commotion.</p>

<p>"I killed the bird with the suitcase before he got ten steps, but
the one with the briefcase got into the crowd where Simmons didn't
dare shoot. So far as we heard yet, the second guy got away. A lot of
cops were after him by that time, so Simmons and me took care of this
Gimble who'd been shot at.</p>

<p>"He claimed he wasn't either hit or hurt, and had to get over here
to see Mr. Havens in a hurry&mdash;" The tall detective shrugged and
glanced deprecatingly at Captain Walters.</p>

<p>"Well, we knew who Mr. Havens was, so we took Gimble and his
suitcase and brought him over here."</p>

<p>Frank Havens nodded. "The right thing to do, under the
circumstances." His blue, penetrating eyes swung to the Phantom. "Mr.
Gimble came in here with these two officers and sat down in the chair
he's in now, he hadn't said anything on the short ride over, and he
was looking rather white. Before he had a chance to talk, he slumped
over and died.</p>

<p>"I had the Clarion's staff physician rush right up here from
downstairs, but nothing could be done. We found that Gimble had been
shot in the spine."</p>

<p>"That's why we didn't see any blood," Detective Simmons stated.
"Them kind of wounds don't hardly bleed at all, and the victim don't
feel he's been shot because he's numbed. He don't die until the fluid
in the spine drains out like an internal hemorrhage. But how was we
to know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Clarion physician exonerated both of you," Havens declared.
"I've heard of similar cases, particularly during the war. Gimble
would have died anyway. But what are we going to do now?"</p>

<p>He turned to Van. "I phoned for Captain Walters and asked him to
keep this free of the regular police routine for one hour. I'm glad
you got here so quickly, Mr. Doran."</p>

<p>"If you haven't found anything of importance in Gimble's suitcase,
or on his person, and if that scientist, Dr. Junes up in Niagara
Falls, can't give you a lead of some sort," Van growled, "you don't
need any help until the police catch the gunman who got away with
Gimble's briefcase." He shot a look at Captain Walters. "That is,
unless the man this detective killed can be identified."</p>

<p>"We're working on that angle," Walters snapped, and said pointedly
to Havens, "If it's okay now, let's have the Homicide Squad and the
Medical Examiner in on this."</p>

<p>Havens eyed Van questioningly, and when Jim Doran nodded, the
precinct captain picked up the phone, asked for Headquarters.</p>

<p>"There was absolutely nothing in Gimble's pockets, nor in his
suitcase, that points to a clue," Havens said emphatically. "We went
through everything while we were waiting for you. And I've put a call
through to the General Electric Experimental Laboratory, but Dr.
Junes refuses to be disturbed and won't answer the phone."</p>

<p>He motioned Van to follow him across the large room to a teletype
machine in the corner. The tape, twisting snakelike over the rim of
the overflowing receptacle, was still uncoiling the grim account of
the life and property toll at Rock Canyon Dam.</p>

<p>Havens fingered the ticker-tape with a trembling hand, looked
searchingly at the Phantom. "I didn't tell them"&mdash;he nodded toward the
three police officers, and lowered his voice&mdash;"who you were, because
I thought you'd want to work on that Arizona disaster, Van."</p>

<p>Jim Doran's slatey eyes were inscrutable. "I saw the Clarion tower
lights signaling just before the N.B.C. network started to put the
President on the air. Yes, Frank," he agreed in a grave, low-pitched
tone, "I'd like to go after the brain that is directing these
catastrophes. I heard his voice&mdash;if that was his voice, making that
threat over the radio. Somebody will have to stop him!"</p>

<p>The Phantom looked keenly at the famous publisher. Havens was
staring out through the wide windows overlooking Manhattan and the
New Jersey hills green against the background of dark, scudding rain
clouds. The older man's blue, moody eyes seemed to be envisaging the
calamity that threatened those peaceful, rolling lands and the vast
country beyond, presaged in the thin, endless record of the tape
sliding implacably through his fingers.</p>

<p>"Somebody must stop him!" Havens repeated with a note of despair
in the almost-whispered words.</p>

<p>Van asked shrewdly, "What did you send Gimble to Niagara for,
Frank? It wasn't just a news article you wanted!"</p>

<p>"You're right," Havens confessed. "Dr. Junes is trying to unite
two metals, aluminum and calbite, heretofore impossible of fusion
because high enough temperatures couldn't be reached. It's an
experiment a lot of steel and munitions manufacturers would like to
know about.</p>

<p>"If those two metals can be fused, the result will be the most
impenetrable armorplate in the world, a new metal ten thousand times
harder and stronger than the toughest of modern steels!"</p>

<p>"At least tough enough to get Lester Gimble murdered," Van
commented, and glanced at the three big men from Pennsylvania. "What
are those fellows here for?"</p>

<p>"Ex-Congressman Arnold came here with the other two prison
officials to ask me to stop giving publicity in my newspapers to the
graft and corruption that's been reported at Alleghany Penitentiary.
They were here when Gimble came in. Harry Arnold is chairman of the
Pennsylvania Board of Parole and Pardons. He and Bluebold and Jessup
claim the publicity I've been giving their prison has interfered with
their attempts to ferret out and clean up the prison rottenness. I'm
convinced they're right, too."</p>

<p>Van nodded, and said to Havens as the police captain called to
them, "Keep the Phantom out of this, Frank, until I tell you
otherwise."</p>

<p>Captain Walters had finished phoning, with flustering results.</p>

<p>"A sour mess this is turning out to be!" he exclaimed. "Doran, you
wanted to get a line on that bird Jackson, the detective,
killed."</p>

<p>Van's voice slipped into character again, became a harsh,
demanding growl.</p>

<p>"If it's a lead, hand it out," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"It's a lead that's going to raise hell over in Pennsylvania,"
Walters declared. "That gunman Jackson shot is Snakey Willow, a lifer
at Alleghany Penitentiary!"</p>

<p>The three brawny prison officials eyeing Captain Walters glanced
sharply over to Frank Havens and Jim Doran.</p>

<p>"Snakey Willow&mdash;" Warden Bluebold's voice was a dry rasp. "He was
in the prison three days ago, when we left. By&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Walters said caustically. "He ain't there now! And I
didn't see any police teleflash about his escape yet, neither. But
that's not all. The rogues gallery picture of him we had at
Headquarters don't fit his face. He had a fresh operation on his mug!
If he'd been able to erase his fingerprints, we'd never have found
out who he was!"</p>

<p>Dr. Maurice Jessup, the prison's resident surgeon, frowned, and
glanced sharply at Bluebold. "I don't think the report you received
is correct. Not in intent, anyway, sir. I remember Willow&mdash;I should,
because he had an accident in the prison foundry and I operated to
save his life. His face was very badly burned, so I did my best to
patch it up. If that's what you refer to, Captain."</p>

<p>"Well," Walters said grudgingly, "that's different!"</p>

<p>Harry Arnold, the ex-congressman from Pennsylvania, broke in with,
"It's a mistake that Willow was able to escape at all! Mr. Havens,
you can see the state things are in at Alleghany Prison. If there's
any more adverse publicity, we're apt to have a prison riot or an
organized jailbreak. If you'll give us some help, by stopping
advertising the conditions, I'll guarantee the prison is cleaned
up!"</p>

<p>"You're right, Mr. Arnold," Havens said determinedly. "I'll do my
best to keep this escape quiet. But see that the prison is
reorganized at once, or I'll have to expose the whole situation, and
you're apt to have the Federal Prison authorities step in!"</p>

<p>Jim Doran's slatey eyes had become the color of muddy marble. He
nodded abruptly to the men in the office. "The police can handle
this. I'll get the details later from them," he announced curtly, and
strode out of the room.</p>

<p>But only Frank Havens caught and appreciated the determined, eager
gleam that had crept into Jim Doran's sardonic gaze.</p>

<p>Several police officials, two internes and a man from the medical
examiner's office were waiting in the bulletproof glass cubicle down
on the eleventh floor when Van got out of the elevator. The editorial
room was still a bedlam of cyclonic confusion.</p>

<p>Out on Eighth Avenue a persistent rain was wetting the shouted
Clarion extras:</p>

<p>TITANIC EXPLOSIONS WRECK</p>

<p>HUGE FEDERAL PROJECT</p>

<p>Weird Radio Voice Threatens Further Disasters</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR - DREAD SNATCH</h2>

<p>Snakey Willow's body lay flat and deflated on the cold morgue slab
when Van pulled back the disinfected white sheet and bent close over
the dead killer's wax-like face. Even in death, the escaped
murderer's features were menacing and evil.</p>

<p>Special attention had evidently been given Snakey Willow's
face-lifting operation by the Bellevue Hospital medicos, for the
recently healed incisions under the tight-skinned jowls and along the
high cheekbones had been slit open again by the autopsy scalpels.</p>

<p>Studying those freshly reopened incisions keenly the Phantom
smiled thinly to himself.</p>

<p>He was no M.D., but mechanized crime hunts had led him deeply into
the study of modern drugs, hypnosis and medicine. He recognized here,
in Snakey Willow's now mutilated features, the sensitive hand of an
exceptionally fine surgeon.</p>

<p>The criminal's nose had been remoulded, shortened and widened in a
manner that tended to broaden the appearance of the unchangeable bone
structure of the narrow head. No wonder the sharp eyes of the New
York City police had failed to recognize that revamped face.</p>

<p>But it was the deft, startlingly liberal application of skin
grafting that held the Phantom's concentrated attention. He fingered
a small, powerful magnifying glass from his vest pocket, focused it
upon those hundreds of individual skin grafts that had covered the
incisions of the original plastic surgery operation.</p>

<p>Each graft, he knew, had been a separate detail taking time and
infinite patience&mdash;and taking, also, a dangerously large amount of
live skin.</p>

<p>Van pulled the white sheet all the way off the nude figure,
examined the body carefully from shoulders to feet for scars of skin
removal. He found none, and slid the sheet back up over the corpse
slowly, his grey eyes moody and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Some other person had provided the live skin for this facial
operation. And from the amount of skin grafted, it had been a
dangerous venture for the donor.</p>

<p>Snakey Willow was not a type to have sacrificing friends. And
prison hospitals didn't provide such donations for convicts. Somebody
had been paid a big sum for the skin used. Or else force had been
used to take it.</p>

<p>Before Jim Doran replaced the magnifying glass in his pocket, he
examined the dead man's fingertips. They had been tampered with,
showed the marks of acid burns, but the tell-tale whorls had not been
eradicated.</p>

<p>Even skin grafting could not stop those true fingerprints from
growing back again to identify their owner. Snakey Willow had, it
seemed, tried to polish off for criminally practical purposes a job
the prison surgeon had done to save his life.</p>

<p>Van Loan left the Bellevue morgue with three convictions:</p>

<p>The prison surgeon who had repaired Snakey Willow's face had
performed one of the finest technical and artistic operations the
Phantom had ever seen. The skin grafting job had taken more live
epidermis than any one donor could safely give. And the entire
operation had cost far more money than Snakey Willow could ever have
paid.</p>

<p>Beyond those three conclusions the Phantom refused to confuse his
mind with speculation. He made a phone call from a drug store booth to
his garage, asking that his coupe be picked up near the Clarion
Building.</p>

<p>A second telephone message got Wild Jerry Lannigan at the mid-town
apartment where the Phantom kept sanctuary quarters under Lannigan's
name.</p>

<p>"Holmes Airport at eight this evening, Champ," he said curtly when
the big red-headed man's voice boomed over the wire. "We're flying
the Beechcraft to Buffalo."</p>

<p>At the other end of the line he could hear Jerry Lannigan's
explosive exclamation of enthusiasm. "Champ" was the familiar name
that only the Phantom used for the beefy, reckless ex-army mechanic
and pilot. It served as a confidential and friendly identification,
for not even Lannigan knew the Phantom was Richard Van Loan.</p>

<p>"Okay, Skipper!" Lannigan was too close to Van personally to use
The Phantom appellation, and too smart to bandy it over a public
phone. "The ship'll be gassed and oiled. It's about time something
happened. I heard that guy with the screwy voice break in on the
President's radio broadcast&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van cut him off with a cryptic, "So did too many other people,
Champ. The man at the airport will be Professor Bendix," and hung
up.</p>

<p>The Jim Doran disguise had sufficed for the hurried Phantom
appearance at the Clarion, but a character of far more ponderance
would be needed for the difficult interview Van planned. And there
was some special technical information he wanted before he visited
Dr. Waldo Junes at the General Electric Experimental Laboratory at
Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>The place to effect both of these needs was in the seclusion of
that sound- and explosion-proof lab in the old abandoned river-front
building up on the East Side.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the scientist in the appearance of the
slouching figure of Jim Doran as he swung off a First Avenue bus at
Ninetieth Street and ambled with wary carelessness toward the East
River.</p>

<p>At the dock end of the street a deserted red brick warehouse
loomed on the left, its dirty windows staring vacuously through
the still drizzling rain of the late summer afternoon. Jim Doran
paused as he reached the corner of the decrepit building, glanced
furtively about him.</p>

<p>The next instant he had faded into the darker shadows beneath the
dilapidated loading platform.</p>

<p>A gaping, broken coal-chute window let him drop through into the
darkness of the warehouse basement. He crossed the musty concrete
floor with quick, familiar steps, produced a small brass key from a
hidden crevice in the masonry at the opposite end of the silent
cellar.</p>

<p>A moment later and he'd unlocked and pulled open a heavy
counter-balanced steel and concrete trap door in the floor.</p>

<p>The Phantom lowered himself down a metal ladder, closed the trap
above him, locked it and snapped on a light switch. He stood in the
large steel-walled sub-cellar laboratory of Professor Paul
Bendix.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the long, low-ceilinged chamber was equipped
with indestructible work tables upon which were an array of glass
jars, racks of test tubes, Bunsen burners, heat-resisting crocks. A
large electric arc furnace filled one corner of the modern lab. And
along two walls were rows of compactly stacked shelves of chemical
supplies.</p>

<p>The remaining quarter of the long room was a well stocked
scientific library of modern chemistry, physics and crime literature
in bound volumes, in professional technical magazines, and in those
privately printed abstruse brochures published by the more learned
scientific societies for purposes of research. The library
represented seven languages.</p>

<p>There were no windows in the room, but a hidden ventilation system
operating through a disused chimney in the warehouse tended to the
air and chemical fumes when Professor Bendix used the laboratory.
Behind a screen in a corner of the library was a couch, a dressing
table, a shower and a large steel wardrobe case with a combination
lock.</p>

<p>Jim Doran stepped over to that wardrobe, unlocked and opened it
with four deft turns of the dial.</p>

<p>Inside hung an array of clothes&mdash;the rough garments of Gunner
McGlone, a Chinatown character as mysterious as he was tough; the
loud-checked suit of Lucky Luke Lamar, the swaggering gambler; the
tuxedo and dinner clothes of Maxie Herman the Hermit, a unique
Broadway figure who emerged bat-like from some undiscovered seclusion
to frequent the night clubs, cabarets and expensive gambling and vice
dens of Manhattan after dark.</p>

<p>There, too, hung the greenish, antique frock coat, the
wing-collared shirt and the baggy striped trousers of that strange,
erratically brilliant scientist, Professor Paul Bendix, the owner of
this underground laboratory.</p>

<p>A brief smile of appreciation curved Dick Van Loan's lips as his
grey eyes slid over that array of garments.</p>

<p>He touched the sleeve of Maxie the Hermit's tuxedo
reminiscently.</p>

<p>The last time he'd worn that disguise, the Hermit had exchanged
hot lead with Trigger Dwyer, now dead, across the crooked roulette
table of the extinct Gold Casino Club.</p>

<p>The Phantom's smile faded, shutting out the past. This was a
grimmer case he was facing. The tough disguise of Gunner McGlone
might prove more appropriate in combating the murderer of Lester
Gimble. But right now Professor Paul Bendix was needed.</p>

<p>He took down the faded, greenish frock coat and the rest of the
professor's eccentric, old-fashioned clothes. From the bottom of the
steel wardrobe cabinet he lifted a metal make-up box, opened it on
the mirror-backed dressing table.</p>

<p>Sitting before the triple mirror, with a strong electric light
focusing his reflection, the Phantom's trained fingers went to work.
Jim Doran disappeared, became Richard Curtis Van Loan again.</p>

<p>Then the lean, tanned face of the Park Avenue clubman faded
rapidly beneath the squarish, bearded features of Professor
Bendix.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the Phantom closed and locked the steel
cabinet and adjusted the worn frock coat on his padded shoulders.</p>

<p>Professor Bendix was a big man physically as well as
scientifically, and spoke with a slightly guttural accent. Van made a
few practise gestures before the mirrors, then turned to the shelves
of specialized technical books and magazines.</p>

<p>For a solid hour he pored over involved treatises dealing with
metallurgy and explosives. Rock Canyon Dam was supposed to have been
engineered to withstand even T.N.T. and the newer picric acid
explosive compounds.</p>

<p>And for another hour he studied various medical journals,
confining his research to articles on plastic surgery and skin
grafting. Dr. Jessup's operation on Willow might not have been a
matter of sheer coincidence.</p>

<p>By seven o'clock he was finished, his mind a bit fagged from the
strain of such continuous concentration. But his confidence was
backed now by definite knowledge of the specialized and seemingly
unrelated subjects he appeared to be up against.</p>

<p>He let himself out of the laboratory through the heavy steel door
that opened directly onto the stubby concrete dock jutting out into
the East River. Van had bought and equipped this abandoned warehouse
under the name of Paul Bendix, so in character he was free to come
and go as he chose, without the handicap of secrecy&mdash;a stooped,
hulking and harmless old gentleman steeped in abstract problems of
pure science.</p>

<p>He phoned Frank Havens from a booth, caught him still in the
Clarion office, and identified himself with a clipped: "Jim
Doran."</p>

<p>"I'm going to Niagara, flying with the Champ," he said
cryptically. "Dr. Bendix. But unannounced, Frank. Anything new come
up?"</p>

<p>Haven's voice was irritable with worry. "Yes. Mort Lewis, the
radio announcer at Rock Canyon, was the last man alive off the dam.
He was found partially buried in a tunnel exit, but was revived. He
reports that two men wearing black robes and black hoods ran out of
the bottom of the dam after the first two explosions, and were
drowned in the flood. Several soldiers claim they saw two similarly
robed figures walking away from the building there that was used for
the radio control station. Every man in that radio station was
murdered, including the guards!"</p>

<p>The Phantom whistled tunelessly through clamped teeth. Havens'
voice went on:</p>

<p>"Somebody tried unsuccessfully to break into the ore exhibit of
the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, D. C., last night. An F.B.I.
man has been added to the building's regular watchmen.</p>

<p>"How do you figure a connection?" Van asked. "The Smithsonian is a
long jump from a revival of the Ku Klux idea in Arizona."</p>

<p>"I'm not figuring," Havens' voice snapped, and the publisher added
apologetically a moment later, "It's only that I know Dr. Junes
visited the Smithsonian a month ago and was given a chip off a
meteoric fragment on display there. He was using it, how I don't
know, in his Niagara experiments with aluminum and calbite. I rather
expected you'd go out to that Alleghany Penitentiary, after finding
Willow had escaped."</p>

<p>"There's the two choices," the Phantom explained. "Remember,
Gimble was murdered evidently for information he'd got from Dr.
Junes. If I can see Junes first, I might have something positive to
work on from the prison angle, afterward. You'll hear from me."</p>

<p>He hung up. Out on the street, he bought a late Clarion extra. The
dam disaster in Arizona, the headlines screamed, was still spreading
destruction through the lower valley of the enormous Federal
project.</p>

<p>Arizona state militia had taken charge of the paralyzed flood
district, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had a number of men
on the job. But as yet nothing definite had been unearthed regarding
either the mechanics of the terrific explosion, or the fiendish
operators who had set off those devastating blasts.</p>

<p>On a back page, crowded in with the comparatively inconsequential
local news, was a short item about the shooting that afternoon in
Grand Central Station. It was given out that Lester Gimble had died
suddenly on his way home from the attack, with a bullet lodged in his
spine, But the fact that he had actually died in the Clarion Press
Building was omitted.</p>

<p>The motive was given as probably robbery.</p>

<p>Professor Paul Bendix left the newspaper on the counter of a diner
where he ate a hurried meal, and climbed into a taxi. As the cab
rolled over Queensboro Bridge toward Holmes Airport, the nearest
aviation field on Long Island, the cab radio began announcing late
news.</p>

<p>The Phantom listened moodily to more flood reports from the
Arizona area. But suddenly his eyes narrowed as a flash announcement
came over the air:</p>

<p>Niagara Falls, New York. Dr. Waldo Junes, noted chemical scientist
conducting secret metallurgical experiments in the General Electric
Research Laboratories in that city, was driven from his underground
workshop late this afternoon by an explosion that demolished
a portion of the laboratory and wrecked his experiment. The Doctor
is at home, recovering from shock, and claims he cannot explain
the cause of the blast, but will never attempt the
experiment again that he was conducting, because of the danger to
humanity&mdash;a danger which he also refuses to explain.</p>

<p>Professor Paul Bendix leaned forward in the cab seat, his grey
eyes sharp and penetrating beneath their shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"Faster!" he called to the taxi driver in a terse, guttural voice.
"A bonus for speed!"</p>

<p>The cab spurted ahead, raced along Northern Boulevard, swung left
through the entrance to Holmes Airport.</p>

<p>The swift red and silver Beechcraft cabin biplane was waiting on
the line, its propeller already turning.</p>

<p>The Phantom threw a five-dollar bill to the cab driver, lurched
out of the taxi, loping in hurrying strides to the plane. The fiery
red head of Big Jerry Lannigan, visible through the open window of
the cabin's cockpit, turned as Professor Bendix pulled himself into
the ship.</p>

<p>"Hiya, Skipper!" Lannigan said, and grinned. "We're going places
again, eh? Reminds me of&mdash;"</p>

<p>His good-humored voice broke off and the grin on his freckled,
weathered face faded abruptly as he recognized the grim determination
in the Phantom's darting eyes.</p>

<p>"Get going, Champ," Van then snapped. "Full throttle! We'll talk
in the air. Head for Buffalo."</p>

<p>Jerry Lannigan's beefy shoulders hunched over the controls, and
the powerful motor roared. The ship taxied rapidly, swung into the
wind, thundered down the runway.</p>

<p>A minute later Long Island was dropping swiftly away below them as
Jerry wound up the retractable landing gear. The climbing plane
banked and headed north across the Sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE - HOODED KILL</h2>

<p>Darkness had descended over the nation's capital. Yet Washington,
sweltering in the heat, was a murmuring hive of excitement and near
panic. The Rock Canyon Dam disaster was on everyone's tongue.</p>

<p>The lights in the Smithsonian Institute had been turned out, but
that building of strange antiques and specimens was being guarded by
a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Standing in a window on the second floor of the Smithsonian
Building, Jud Marks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation operative
stationed in the building, was staring out at the red marker lights
atop the shaft of the Washington Monument. He was a large, rawboned
man, with sharp blue eyes, a blond mustache and a jutting jaw.</p>

<p>He turned quickly as a slight shuffling noise caught his ear, but
it was only one of the regular night watchmen making his rounds.</p>

<p>Jud Marks signaled the man and turned back to the window. He
lighted a cigarette, smoked half of it leisurely, and suddenly
dropped it to the floor, scrubbed it out with the toe of his shoe as
his narrowed eyes stared down at the driveway below.</p>

<p>A long, black sedan, its headlights extinguished, was rolling to a
stop beside the delivery entrance to the building. But nobody got out
of the car immediately.</p>

<p>Marks watched the car a moment longer, then moved away from the
window toward the stairway. There was, so far as he knew, no official
of the Smithsonian Institute who had stayed in the building after it
had been closed up for the night, no person here who would have a car
call for him.</p>

<p>He started down to investigate, but flattened abruptly against the
wall halfway down the staircase as two shadowy figures darted across
the corridor below.</p>

<p>Jud Marks jerked out his gun, ran silently the rest of the way
down the stairs, following those two fast-moving, furtive figures. He
lost them among the glass cases of stuffed reptiles on exhibition in
a room of the west wing.</p>

<p>Out in the big dark main foyer an electric flashlight in the hand
of one of the regular night watchmen made a thin, yellowish shaft
across the stone floor. A second later the light blinked out,
clattered onto the flagging, and there was a quick, stifled moan,
then the dull thud of a falling body.</p>

<p>Marks ran back into the foyer, his own torch shooting a shaft of
light before him.</p>

<p>In the moving beam the watchman's body was a huddled heap on the
floor, and a flow of blood coursed redly from a wound in the
unconscious guard's back. The protruding black handle of a knife was
visible.</p>

<p>This, the tall F.B.I. operative saw in a sliding glance as his
torchlight jerked across and outlined for an instant a black-robed,
black-hooded figure running through a doorway into the mineral
exhibit room.</p>

<p>Marks bent down over the watchman on the floor, saw that he was
dead, then plunged after the hooded killer. And as he swung through
the open doorway a human catapult hit him.</p>

<p>A knife blade ripped his coat in a swift downward plunge. He
whirled aside, slammed into a wall behind him, snapped on his
flashlight to get a target for the automatic in his right hand. The
light struck full against a corpse-grey mask covering a face hidden
beneath a black, monklike hood. The Federal operative's gun fired
low, purposely. The robed murderer would be more valuable alive than
dead.</p>

<p>But in the split-second it took to change his aim, the grim target
spun aside, leaped at him again with poised knife. Marks' slug
chipped the stone wall harmlessly.</p>

<p>Then the killer was on him again, cursing with harsh, rasping
oaths. The long-bladed knife slashed at Jud, ripped through his
sleeve, burned paralyzingly through the flesh of his warding forearm,
knocking the electric torch from his grip.</p>

<p>As the light dropped, its rays for a split-second swept down
across two more robed and hooded men crouched over an open glass
display case. They were lifting from its bed a silver-colored rough
ball-like piece of metal the size of a small goldfish bowl&mdash;the
meteoric fragment Dr. Hugo Junes had taken a chip from.</p>

<p>The torch cracked out against the stone flooring, blotting off the
strange tableau. From somewhere off in the darkness another gun
exploded and a scream of agony started and broke off. The powerful
arms closed around Jud Marks' body, lifting him into the air.</p>

<p>He fought now like a wild man, his gun hand gripped in the
viselike fist of his smothering opponent. The man in that weird
hooded garb had the strength of a gorilla. Ju jitsu and judo were
useless tricks in this swaying, gasping, silent battle.</p>

<p>Marks kicked back with his heels, tried to dislodge the footing of
the man holding him off the floor. The grip about his waist only
tightened.</p>

<p>He was vaguely aware of blurred movement across in the darkness. A
torch gleamed in the doorway at the rear of the room, advanced
toward them. The man he was struggling with shrieked out a curse,
called for help.</p>

<p>The next moment a second hooded unknown ripped the gun from Marks'
grip, cracked him in the jaw with a driving fist. Jud's senses rocked
as the second and third blows crashed against him.</p>

<p>"He's not a watchman," an authoritative, icy voice stated. The
torch shone blindingly in Marks, eyes. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I'll kill him and find out afterward!" The powerful arms took a
fresh grip about the F.B.I. man's body.</p>

<p>Jud felt fingers jabbing into his pockets as the light blinked
out. He stopped struggling, breathing hard, waiting for an
opportunity to break free. He could feel the sharp point of the long
knife against his ribs.</p>

<p>"Federal agent of the Bureau of Investigation," the first voice
grated as the flashlight jabbed its beam at the badge that had been
taken from Marks' vest pocket.</p>

<p>"All the more reason to use the knife on him," the growled voice
of the man pinioning Marks' arm said ruthlessly.</p>

<p>"A damned good reason not to!" the man with the electric torch
snapped. "Give him the pencil and we'll take him along. We've got
what we want here. The chief wants one of these Federals for
questioning. Wants to find out how much the bureau knows about him.
Use the pencil on him and toss him in the car. We've got to get out
of here!"</p>

<p>"I ain't got one of them pencils with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're a damn fool!" The hooded, white-masked face in front of
Jud Marks came closer, taking a thick black pencil from his
pocket.</p>

<p>Marks' slitted eyes glared fearlessly, helplessly.</p>

<p>The hand holding the pencil thrust it close to Jud's face.</p>

<p>"Have a nice nap, copper!"</p>

<p>"I'll see you in hell!" Marks grated defiantly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you'll get there eventually yourself," the black-robed man
promised.</p>

<p>A cruel, sadistic chuckle sounded behind the Federal agent. A
faintly bluish puff of odorless gas squirted suddenly from the pencil
into Marks' face. The F. B. I. man gagged, coughed once, then went
limp as unconsciousness swept over him.</p>

<p>"Tape him up and lock him in the luggage trunk on the sedan," the
one with the electric flashlight directed as he put away his gas
pencil. "Everything else is ready. Hurry up. We've got a long hard
trip."</p>

<p>The unconscious Secret Service operative was picked up bodily,
carried to the delivery entrance, dropped on the floor while
adhesive tape was plastered over his eyes and lips and wrapped around
his wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>As he was carried out and crammed into the trunk on the rack at
the rear of the car, the rough ball of heavy metal the meteoric
fragment taken from the glass case in the ore exhibition room, was
being wrapped in a blanket and placed in the bottom of the car. Ten
minutes later that long, black sedan was purring across the Potomac
River into Virginia where it turned to the right and headed north in
the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX - TORTURE DEATH</h2>

<p>All through the fast two and a half-hour flight against a strong
crosswind, Dr. Paul Bendix sat in the front seat beside Lannigan, and
seemed half asleep. His cryptic answers to the big red-headed
Irishman's questions were enigmatic and curt.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait, Champ," he told Lannigan flatly, "until we
find out what's been going on with Dr. Junes' metallurgical
experiments. With murder at one end, and an explosion at the other,
there's more than the ordinary crime-for-money motive behind this
peculiar affair."</p>

<p>"Some big mob is working again," Jerry declared. "Another gang of
crooks like that arson outfit that tried to blackmail New York City,
eh? I'd like to get my hands on 'em!"</p>

<p>Van veiled the fragment of a wry smile behind his drooping
eyelids. Jerry Lannigan was a whirlwind in a fight, fearless and
trustworthy beyond reason, and far from dumb. But it was sometimes a
tough job to hold the big fellow back from too sudden action that
might warn off the unknown brain operating back of a sequence of
crimes.</p>

<p>Jerry Lannigan had been the top sergeant-mechanic in charge of the
pursuit squadron that Richard Curtis Van Loan had commanded as a
flying major during the World War. And Lannigan, loyal and faithful,
kicked and shoved by chance three times around the world since then,
had tried to find the man who had been his C.O. in France.</p>

<p>He'd not succeeded, so far as he knew. Four burly but polite
doormen had unceremoniously tossed him into the street from the
aristocratic entrance to the exclusive London-town Apartments on
upper Park Avenue atop which Dick Van Loan had built his penthouse
bachelor home. Van Loan owned the building, in fact, but had been
away when Lannigan had tried to visit him.</p>

<p>Van had found Jerry by accident, subsequently, during the blowing
up of a Bronx River bridge, but had been disguised and Lannigan had
not recognized him. Remembering the battling qualities of the big
red-headed mechanic. Van had immediately hired him, letting Jerry
know only that he was being employed by the Phantom.</p>

<p>It still stood that way now.</p>

<p>For Dick was afraid that Jerry's pride, damaged at having been
thrown out of the swanky London-town when Lannigan had tried to look
him up, would drive the Champ away if ever the likeable, fiery
Irishman found that the one-time flying major he was searching for and
the wealthy Park Avenue clubman were the same.</p>

<p>Lannigan knew some of the Phantom's disguises. He would never know
the real identity of the man he sought behind those ingenious
characterizations.</p>

<p>The Beechcraft's powerful Wasp motor beat a rhythmic, staccato
monotone as the late evening sky darkened into night, making
conversation difficult. The rain storm of the afternoon had blown
north, but the speedy ship outdistanced it. At ten-thirty the glow
and flash of Buffalo's lights were under them, and the Phantom swung
the control wheel from Lannigan's seat over to his own.</p>

<p>"I'll land at Niagara," he told Jerry. "We'll lock up the ship.
You come with me to Dr. Junes' home. I don't know what we'll run into
there."</p>

<p>A gleam of anticipation shone in the Champ's greenish eyes as Van
cut the throttle and swooped down toward the small unlighted airport
at Niagara. Across the dark, thunderous canyon of the mighty falls
itself, the glimmering lights of houses and hotels winked
mysteriously at them from the Canadian side of the rapids.</p>

<p>A grim reminder of the flood force of the disaster at Rock Canyon
Dam seemed to echo through the darkness from the mighty falls as the
Phantom set the ship down on the field and snapped off the landing
lights.</p>

<p>"What we want," he told Lannigan as they locked up the plane, "is
a talk with Junes, if I can get him to talk. He'll know something
about Dr. Paul Bendix, because I've managed to get several science
articles published in the journals he reads. Then, we want a look at
his laboratory, whether he'll take us there or not."</p>

<p>"We've cracked open tougher spots than labs," Jerry reminded him
confidently. "We'll get in!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Van and Jerry were pulling up in a cab in front
of a small, neat cottage on a dark, quiet street at the residence
address of the famous metallurgist.</p>

<p>"Just in case," Van whispered to Lannigan, "I couldn't come armed.
If I need a rod, how about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm rodded, so don't worry," Jerry told him. "I wouldn't want to
answer a phone call from you without a roscoe on my hip."</p>

<p>Several reporters stood on the tree-shrouded sidewalk, talking in
low tones with a detective and a uniformed police lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Doctor Junes," the Phantom announced as he got
out of the cab. He spoke with a slightly guttural accent, his eyes
studying the men and the dark surroundings from beneath the shaggy
greying eyebrows of Professor Paul Bendix. "Is the Doctor at home,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>One of the reporters, wearing a ticket in his hat band, eyed the
odd, stooped figure in the faded frock coat with interest. "Who are
you, Mister?" He added, in a brazen aside to the other men, "This
old-timer looks as screwy as Junes himself, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am Professor Paul Bendix!" Van said haughtily. "I am a man of
science, so you have doubtless never heard of me!"</p>

<p>The police lieutenant stepped up close. "Didn't you know that Dr.
Junes had a nasty explosion in his laboratory early this
evening?"</p>

<p>"We just flew up from New York City," Lannigan said gruffly.</p>

<p>The plainclothes detective, watching them suspiciously, glanced at
the lieutenant. "If they flew up, they were in the air when the
report went out. They wouldn't know, I guess."</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded, asked bluntly, "What did you want to see
Dr. Junes about, Professor Bendix?"</p>

<p>"A purely scientific matter," the Phantom's foreign-accented voice
answered curtly. "Doctor Junes is conducting some valuable
experiments in metallurgy in which I am interested. My visit here is
sponsored by Mr. Frank Havens, the eminent publisher."</p>

<p>"I guess I can tell you, then," the police lieutenant said, his
eyebrows going up at mention of the Clarion owner's name. "Dr. Junes
had a very mean shock when the explosion happened. Nobody was killed,
fortunately. He was brought home by two of his assistants, and
refused to talk, except to say that he was finished forever with what
he was working on&mdash;I don't pretend to understand that part of it,
naturally. Anyhow, he suddenly changed his mind about a half hour
ago, and went back to the laboratory with the two assistants
again."</p>

<p>"If the doctor is at the laboratory, then I should see him there,"
Van stated. "Is there any reason why not, sir?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you can go there," the officer admitted. "I'll tell
you, though, Professor Bendix&mdash;a fellow from New York City visited Dr.
Junes yesterday, and was murdered in Grand Central Station today when
he returned to your city. The New York police notified us, so we are
sort of trying to watch out, for the doctor's protection. In fact,
we've got a couple of detectives hanging around as close to Dr. Junes
as they can get. Which isn't very close, in that lab of his. He's a
touchy old codger." The officer studied Dr. Bendix warily.</p>

<p>"What could that have to do with me, sir?" Professor Bendix
shrugged, turned toward the cab. "I am concerned with science, not
with crime. Thank you for directing me, officer."</p>

<p>He climbed into the taxi with Jerry, ordered the driver to take
him to Dr. Junes' laboratory. As the cab pulled away, he turned
sideways in the seat, watched narrowly through the rear window.</p>

<p>In the vague darkness behind, he caught a glimpse of the police
lieutenant and the two reporters darting across the sidewalk toward
Dr. Junes' cottage, evidently intent on using the phone.</p>

<p>"Checking on us," he said quietly to Lannigan. "Perhaps warning
the detectives to watch us, or let us go through. We'll soon
see."</p>

<p>"If we're going in, we're going in, dick or no dicks," Jerry
declared flatly.</p>

<p>Van's eyes clouded, then became sharply alert, determinedly alive
again as the taxi stopped in front of a long, squatty low building of
bleak stone that stood apart from other dark buildings on a black
private lane near the rumbling falls. He got out, paid off the
driver, and stood for a minute with Lannigan as the taxi turned and
rolled away.</p>

<p>A high iron picket fence surrounded the tree-shaded grounds. The
large vehicle gate was locked, but a narrow pedestrian passage beside
the empty watchman's booth let them through onto a winding cinder
path leading to the dark laboratory.</p>

<p>Van led the way, making no attempt at caution. There was no sign
of the detectives the police lieutenant had mentioned.</p>

<p>At the arched main entrance to the squat building he tried the
door, found it locked, and rapped resoundingly with his knuckles.</p>

<p>There was no answer for fully two minutes. Then the door opened a
few inches and a flashlight gleamed blindingly in their faces.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" a harsh voice demanded suspiciously. "What'd ya want?"</p>

<p>The Phantom ignored the gun visible in the hand of the man with
the torch.</p>

<p>"Professor Paul Bendix to see Doctor Hugo Junes," he announced
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'll have to know more than that," the man inside growled.</p>

<p>"Tell the doctor," Van ordered, "that Professor Bendix has arrived
from New York City and is to see the doctor in behalf of Mr. Frank
Havens, the publisher."</p>

<p>"Wait here." The door shammed shut on them.</p>

<p>"I should have shoved in while he was arguin'," Jerry
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Van shook his head. There were other means of getting inside that
laboratory, if this direct method failed. If possible, he wanted Dr.
Junes to connect Professor Bendix with the murdered Lester Gimble
before they met, so the General Electric scientist could be prepared
to give him, unobserved, the information Gimble had carried to his
death. But he didn't want to use Havens' name unnecessarily.</p>

<p>There was another wait of several minutes before the door opened
once more and the torch gleamed at them.</p>

<p>"Come on in," the harsh voice directed.</p>

<p>They shoved into the blackness anteroom. The door shut and the
smell of a thousand chemicals assailed their nostrils. Van recognized
the predominant odor of fulminated sulphur which increased as they
followed the stocky figure who motioned them along with the revolver
he held.</p>

<p>Ahead of them the beam of his flashlight outlined the bare walls
of a concrete corridor, and steps going down. They descended, their
footsteps echoing hollowly.</p>

<p>Another corridor turned off at right angles behind a heavy steel
door which the stocky man opened and closed behind them. Van got one
good look at his hard features before he padded on ahead again. There
was another left turn, a second stairway going down, steeper and
longer than the first.</p>

<p>At the bottom they stopped before a massive circular steel
vault-like door cut into what appeared to be no longer concrete but
solid rock. Their guide could not have come this far and returned
during the short few moments they had waited outside the front
entrance of the building. He must have phoned down here.</p>

<p>As the man swung open the heavy round door, Van said to him:</p>

<p>"How do you know I'm Professor Bendix?"</p>

<p>The fellow eyed him belligerently. "That'll be up to the doctor.
He's down there." The stocky man stood aside, waiting.</p>

<p>Van looked through the circular doorway. A ladder disappeared into
the well-like shaft, but light showed at the bottom some twenty feet
below as he peered down. Except for a rangy shadow that moved
momentarily across the light at the bottom, the hole had every
appearance of a death trap.</p>

<p>The Phantom glanced warningly at Jerry Lannigan, nodded swiftly,
and stepped onto the steel rungs of the ladder fastened into the
circular stone wall. Above him, as he lowered himself, Lannigan's
descending bulk blotted out the light of the electric torch
above.</p>

<p>A moment later the Phantom stood at the bottom of the hole. He
stepped away from the ladder, turned and moved into the queer
octagonal laboratory of Dr. Hugo Junes.</p>

<p>One whole side of the laboratory was a wreck. An electric arc
oven was blasted apart, and a slab of the rock wall behind it had
been blown off. The debris-burnt metal, ore and scorched, blackened
stone had been brushed into a heap and partly covered by a collapsed
iron screen tipped over it.</p>

<p>The compact but barren-looking equipment across the room that had
not been demolished by the explosion was now in use.</p>

<p>Dr. Junes himself&mdash;Van recognized the man from his pictures in
several of the metallurgical journals he'd studied&mdash;was standing tall,
gaunt and frightened beside a shelflike high-voltage electric oven
which was already glowing whitely beneath the plates covering its
heat producing arcs.</p>

<p>Two men, wearing heavy welder's goggles covering their eyes and
faces, were watching him alertly, and a third stood back of them at a
large rheostat in the wall. He, too, wore similar heavy glasses and
face protector.</p>

<p>There was no other equipment in the room except, on a stone slab
that made a workbench jutting from the wall opposite the rheostat, a
heavy twenty-four-pound sledge hammer, a chisel and a steel handsaw.
Beside the hammer was a small chip of silver colored ore the size of
a silver dollar.</p>

<p>The tall, gaunt man nearest the furnace looked across at Van with
an almost beseeching gleam of hope in his heat-moistened eyes. His
gaze shifted a moment to Lannigan, who now stood behind the Phantom,
then settled helplessly upon Van again.</p>

<p>"I am told," the unsteady voice of the gaunt, frightened man said
with an attempt at formality, "that you are Professor Paul Bendix, of
New York City. I believe I have had the pleasure of reading several
of your scientific brochures. I am Dr. Hugo Junes."</p>

<p>The Phantom nodded gravely, and his grey eyes veiled their wary
alertness beneath the drooping lids of Professor Paul Bendix.</p>

<p>"Excellent, Doctor," he said austerely. "And I am familiar with
your remarkable work." He glanced at the glowing furnace. "I observe
your experiment is already in process, despite an unfortunate
explosion."</p>

<p>"What you observe," Junes stated with suppressed passion, "is the
ultimate defeat of all my experiments with aluminum and calbite. I
have returned here only to burn up what the attempted fusion reaction
did not completely destroy."</p>

<p>The eyes of the others in the room were inscrutable behind their
heavy goggles. For the moment, at least, they seemed content to
listen and dart quick glances at the furnace.</p>

<p>"I understand your experiments are designed to fuse calbite and
aluminum," Van said appreciatively. "But the explosion&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dr. Junes' gaze shifted to the others, then to the oven, and back
to the Phantom, blinking confusedly. "I have refused to continue, or
to leave any trace of my work, because of that revealing accident
this afternoon. I am unable to understand what was the real cause of
it, sir, but only a few grains of the composite metals, not quite
fused, suddenly exploded&mdash;with the result you can see for yourself."
He waved a hand toward the debris at one side of the room.</p>

<p>"Powerful," Van commented, his nerves tightening as the impact of
that information struck him. "A few grains, you say? No more?"</p>

<p>"A very few grains, Professor Bendix. And&mdash;" Junes smacked his
palms together sharply&mdash;"it happened! My assistants do not agree with
me in my refusal to continue. But consider&mdash;what would happen to
humanity if the explosive power of the formula I nearly discovered
became a reality! The whole world would be at the mercy of whoever
could control that metallurgical combination. It is too dangerous,
too terrible to contemplate. So I have refused to go on!"</p>

<p>"It's an endothermic compound, I presume," Professor Bendix
suggested, and when Junes nodded agreement, "At what temperature did
you expect to make the aluminum-calbite fusion?"</p>

<p>"Impossible to say," Junes declared warmly. "These furnaces
produce the greatest heat of any man-made generators yet devised. And
they fall considerably short of a real fusion. I've added ammonium
nitrate&mdash;" He paused, frowned. "But enough. I am done. I will not
jeopardize humanity."</p>

<p>The man at the rheostat said sullenly, "Dr. Junes is very
stubborn, Professor Bendix. The explosion this afternoon has him
imagining too many things a scientist should never consider."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Junes exploded. "You&mdash;all of you! I will not be driven, nor
forced! Nor bribed. Nor threatened!" His voice rose to a suddenly
terrified screech, a pitch that seemed without reason.</p>

<p>Two of the assistants grabbed and held him. The rheostat man
nodded curtly, asked Bendix:</p>

<p>"Could you, Professor, finish the doctor's experiment&mdash;if you were
without his hysterical prejudices?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Van answered evenly. "Given time."</p>

<p>Dr. Junes' tall figure jerked violently, shuddered, and suddenly
collapsed as the two men let him loose. He staggered, stepped
backward, his eyes wide with quick terror, staring at the opening
behind Van where the steel ladder led up to the sub-cellar corridor
above.</p>

<p>The Phantom whirled, knocking against Lannigan's big hand that
almost automatically was reaching for a hidden revolver. Van gave
Jerry a warning signal to wait. Then Professor Paul Bendix settled
his gaze on that exit.</p>

<p>Standing in the well-like opening was a tall, powerfully built
figure dressed in a caped black robe with a black hood over a head
whose face was masked in white. The next moment the terrifying figure
moved into the room.</p>

<p>A frightful scream of agony slashed the silence, shot a
blood-chilling shock through Van as he spun back, stared with
momentarily paralyzed muscles at the gaunt, writhing form of
Junes.</p>

<p>The scientist was sprawled backward halfway across the top of the
white-hot furnace plates, his body held there by the adhesive,
scorching flesh that stuck to the plates and was filling the room
with a nauseating stench. A final shriek died on the doctor's lips.
The whole upper half of his body shriveled; the arms alone waving
spasmodically in unconscious, dying reflexes.</p>

<p>The Phantom sprang for the rheostat, knocked aside the third
masked man standing near it. He spun off the electric dial control,
turned to watch the scientist's limp body slide down off the
furnace.</p>

<p>For a fleeting second, as one of the men wearing the welding mask
bent over Junes' dead body, Van caught a glimpse of the handle of a
hypodermic syringe in the fellow's coat pocket. The next moment the
handle had slipped down out of sight.</p>

<p>"A regrettable accident," the hooded figure stated sullenly, and
glanced at Professor Paul Bendix with icy determination. "Did I hear
you say you could carry on the unfortunate scientist's work?"</p>

<p>"This furnace wasn't hot enough for the experiment, anyhow," the
masked man who had been at the rheostat declared. "We've been
watching this stove seven hours, and the metals won't fuse."</p>

<p>The Phantom's seething mind clicked to a grim conclusion. He was
being asked to take the place of the dead scientist. Junes had
refused to aid these men in what ever plan they had proposed. Van had
not positive proof, but already suspected that the doctor had been
shoved onto that furnace and murdered. He decided to join them, let
them force him into their scheme.</p>

<p>He nodded, inclined his head gravely, saw even then out of the
corner of his eye what was going to happen, as he indicated Lannigan.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is entirely possible that I could conduct the unfortunate
doctor's experiment," he said. "If I have my assistant."</p>

<p>At a nod from the hooded figure, one of the men had stepped close
to Jerry Lannigan. A faintly blue vapor curled up swiftly from a
pencil in the man's hand, and Jerry dropped unconscious to the
floor.</p>

<p>"You shall have your assistant," the icy voice promised with a
note of satanic humor. He pocketed the small chip of silver-colored
ore on the stone bench, and advanced on Van.</p>

<p>The next instant a second pencil ejected a shot of that bluish
brain-fogging gas straight into the Phantom's bearded face. The room
whirled dizzily for a second that seemed endless, while the hooded
face leered. Then oblivion blotted out the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN - DESTINATION DARKNESS</h2>

<p>Jolting movement and the sound of rushing wind and an automobile
motor's powerful throbbing rhythm beat into the Phantom's drugged
brain.</p>

<p>He tried to open his eyes, but the tight pressure of tape on them
kept the lids shut. His hands were fastened behind his back with
tape. He lurched helplessly with each swerving plunge of the car, his
body held upright between two men in the seat beside him.</p>

<p>His parched lips were taped shut, and hunger gnawed at his
stomach, giving him the only measure of the passage of time. Eight
hours or longer, he judged, since he had been knocked out with those
bluish odorless fumes.</p>

<p>The last physical sensations he remembered were the smell of
fulmigated sulphur and the heat in that sub-cellar of the General
Electric metallurgical laboratory. But now the fresh odor of pines,
an occasional lingering whiff of burning coal, and the rush of cool
air assailed his senses.</p>

<p>He listened keenly, trying to pick up the rumbling roar of Niagara
Falls, but could hear only the hum of the motor and the swish of the
wind. The totality of his blind impressions was of steep long climbs,
quick descents and open spaces.</p>

<p>The two men sitting beside him began to stir restlessly. A match
scraped, followed by the pungent odor of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>"Making good time for a long ride," one of the men said in a tired
voice. "Almost there now. The other car'll be there already."</p>

<p>"Yeah," the other rider agreed. "Not a hitch on this trip. That's
what organization does. You going to try for a sergeant's
circles?"</p>

<p>"I ain't killed nobody yet," the other grumbled. "Anyhow, not
officially. Soon's I do, though, I'll sure apply for the next rating.
Sergeant's get plenty of authority."</p>

<p>"You won't have to wait long for a chance to get a killing
credit," the second man prophesied knowingly. "I heard, from one of
the district majors, that th' State Militia is commin' after us."</p>

<p>"Better not talk too much," the man on Van's right warned. "I
heard somethin' about that, too, but you know what the penalty is for
not keepin' your mouth shut!"</p>

<p>Van could tell by the movement of the man's body that the guard
had gestured significantly at him.</p>

<p>In the prolonged, moody silence that followed, the Phantom tried
to fathom the motives and extent of the mysterious organization that
three times now had reared its ugly, poisonous head, There was but
the one conclusion&mdash;some secret society was plotting to overthrow the
government of the United States, and was relying upon some new
unannounced discovery of modern science to effect their treacherous
ends.</p>

<p>And that the dead Dr. Hugo Junes' metallurgical experiments with
aluminum and calbite had something to do with those murderous plans
appeared obvious. The Phantom was convinced that Dr. Junes' death had
not been accidental, but a deliberate killing.</p>

<p>The doctor's pleading fear and final wild hysteria, the hypodermic
syringe visible for an instant in one of the masked men's pockets,
the whole set-up in the General Electric underground heat laboratory,
in fact, pointed at murder. Junes must have been drugged and thrown
against the top of that furnace.</p>

<p>But why should these hooded and masked members of such a secret
organization kill Dr. Junes, a scientist whom they were using?</p>

<p>The obvious answer was that Junes had refused to conform to their
demands. And now the Phantom himself was purposely letting himself be
forced to take the murdered scientist's place in their subversive
scheme. The disguise of Professor Paul Bendix had proved more real
and convincing than Van had ever hoped.</p>

<p>His unanswered and unvoiced questions were interrupted by the
slowing of the car. It stopped and, judging by the sounds, they had
driven inside some building which, nevertheless, did not smell like a
garage. The binding tape was ripped off his ankles and he was shoved
out of the car.</p>

<p>His shoes crunched on cinders and there was a trace of coal gas in
the air. Then he was being guided along an earthy-smelling, cool
passageway that had the confining feel of a tunnel.</p>

<p>There were four men with him now, their rough voices sounding loud
and echoing. They stopped him a hundred paces beyond. Van could feel
unsteady board footing beneath him.</p>

<p>Something slammed suddenly, sounding like a gate. Mechanism grated
and groaned into action. The Phantom, his pinioned arms still held by
two of the men, experienced the sensation of being lowered slowly in
an elevator.</p>

<p>The complaining, slow descent went on it seemed endlessly. Van had
no way of reckoning how far down into the earth he was being carried,
but the air became rapidly more gaseous and damp, the pressure
heavier.</p>

<p>The guards with him had ceased talking, but their casual, almost
illiterate conversation before had given him no inkling of where he
might be, except for an occasional miner's phrase.</p>

<p>The elevator car stopped finally and Van was pushed into a narrow
passageway. His shoulders rubbed against damp dirt walls, and he had
to stoop to protect his head from the low, wooden beams bracing the
roof.</p>

<p>From the voices only two men were with him now one in front and
one behind. He was herded through an interminably long and crooked
tunnel and several times he could feel with his shoulders different
openings leading off. Whether or not they were following the main
tunnel or any one of its branches, he had no way of knowing.</p>

<p>The floor was a steady decline, some parts steeper than others,
but always descending. Five times, the Phantom counted, he was
stopped while the exaggerated clicking and grating noise of a door
being unlocked, opened, closed behind them and locked again, filled
the accentuated silence about him.</p>

<p>The passage leveled out beyond the fifth door. He felt several
more openings in the walls as he was shoved ahead. The tunnel twisted
continuously, and the odor of gas increased, made breathing more
labored.</p>

<p>Another door barred their passage, but there was no key in the
possession of the guards for this one. One of them beat against the
panel with what sounded like the butt of a gun&mdash;five swift blows, a
pause and a single sixth.</p>

<p>On the other side a key turned with a click that echoed like an
explosion in the compressed atmosphere. A bar scraped as it was slid
away from the door on the opposite side. A moment later the door
swung inward and the Phantom was pushed through, shoved up against a
wall.</p>

<p>He heard the door being closed and locked. Then without
preliminaries the tape was ripped off his wrists, torn off his eyes
and mouth. Van opened his eyes slowly, slitting them against any
unexpected light that might blind him after his long siege of
complete darkness. But only a poor indirect glow lighted the
cavernous room in which he found himself.</p>

<p>The two men who had brought him in stood on either side of him and
one of them held a heavy long-barreled revolver. Both were dressed in
overalls and miners' caps in which gleamed small electric bulbs.</p>

<p>Across the chamber stood a tall figure in a black-caped robe. The
man had a black hood over his head and his face was covered with a
mask through which his eyes glittered ominously. He might have been
the same grim specter who had appeared at the General Electric
sub-cellar laboratory. Even his voice when he spoke sounded similar
in the deceiving echoes of the cavern.</p>

<p>"Professor Paul Bendix," he said contemptuously, "I hope the trip
hasn't upset you."</p>

<p>Van eyed the hooded figure defiantly, wet his parched lips. "What
manner of science is it," he demanded in the guttural voice of
Professor Bendix, "that makes such humiliating experience
necessary?"</p>

<p>The hooded man shrugged indifferently beneath his robe.</p>

<p>"Asking questions is not a part of your job here," the tall man
stated flatly, and added significantly, "You witnessed what happened
to your predecessor, Dr. Hugo Junes."</p>

<p>The Phantom stepped away from the wall, flexing his cramped
muscles. In another corner of the cavern his eyes, accustomed to the
peculiar light now, slid and settled on the bound and gagged figure
of Jerry Lannigan. The big Irishman was watching him eagerly.</p>

<p>"You have my assistant here, I see!" the Phantom exclaimed, making
his words ring with anger that covered the relief he felt. "Untie
him!" This was no time for feeling his way. They evidently still
thought he was an eminent scientist, and he had to continue his
bluffing characterization.</p>

<p>"I had your assistant untied before," the cloaked leader in the
room said. "He became unmanageable and fought, so I had him tied
again to keep him from getting hurt. I hope that the fool will behave
himself now that you are here."</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee that he will," Professor Bendix declared gravely.
Yet within him was a warming glow at the thought of what damage the
Champ had probably done before they overpowered him.</p>

<p>The hooded leader nodded to one of the guards, who went over and
ripped the tape bonds from Lannigan's ankles, wrists and lips. The
red-headed Irishman got to his feet, came over and stood
belligerently beside the professor.</p>

<p>"This joint is ratty!" Lannigan growled at the man in the hood,
and turned to Van. "The whole place is overrun with these guys
dressed up like Ku Kluxers."</p>

<p>"Enough of that!" the leader snapped. "You'll find our
organization very effective if you try any foolishness."</p>

<p>"Quiet," the Phantom warned Lannigan, and addressed the man in the
black robe: "If I am to be put to work, I must see the laboratory.
And I would appreciate knowing where I am."</p>

<p>The tall, hooded figure again jerked his head at the two mine
guards and moved to another door in the chamber.</p>

<p>"You will find where you are," he said over his shoulder, "when
the time comes and you are a blood member with us. For the present,
the temporary laboratory is directly under us."</p>

<p>The two guards, both of them with guns in their hands now,
motioned Van and Lannigan to follow their leader. Van, while he had
been talking, had been using his hands casually, feeling of his
clothes and secret pockets. His captors appeared not to have taken
time to search him thoroughly.</p>

<p>Even though unarmed, he and the Champ might have put up a fight in
an attempt to break free. But the information he wanted was evidently
down here, not elsewhere.</p>

<p>Escape now would have defeated his purpose.</p>

<p>Guarded by the two armed men, Van and Jerry followed the robed
figure through the door which he opened, down a steep incline that
turned twice at right angles and brought them out into a deeper,
smaller cavern cut into the earth directly below the subterranean
chamber above.</p>

<p>Heat greeted them as they entered this room.</p>

<p>Four burly men, stripped to the waist, eyed them curiously. A
fifth man who appeared to be a hunchback looked up leeringly with
small pale eyes set deep and wide apart in a distorted, twitching and
scarred face.</p>

<p>But it was the glow in the center of the room that held Van's
attention. Through a small opening in the rock a thin flame stood up
from the floor for almost a foot in height. The rock from which this
jet spurted was white hot, and the flame itself was perfectly
colorless at the base but flowered into vivid blues and yellows
before it expended itself.</p>

<p>The room was filled with a constant hissing sound, a miniature
roar that made speech difficult.</p>

<p>The Phantom tore his eyes from that fascinating light, and for a
moment as he looked away he was blinded. Then vision returned
swiftly, but he kept his eyes off that flame, and noticed that about
the necks of the four workmen and the hunchback hung thick
goggles.</p>

<p>The cloaked leader indicated the short squat man with the hunched
back, and said to Van, "This is Doctor Kag. Professor Kag was one of
the foremost metallurgists in the world until one of his experiments
blew up and crippled him. He is temporarily&mdash;" He emphasized the word
forebodingly&mdash;"in charge of the experiments we are conducting here.
The gas flame in this room, with the addition of oxygen, is the
hottest torch that has ever been discovered&mdash;two thousand degrees
centigrade higher than that electric arc oven of Dr. Junes at Niagara
Falls."</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes showed a sharpened interest that he did not
have to fake.</p>

<p>The man-made oven of Dr. Junes, built by the General Electric
Company for experimental purposes, had the highest temperature of
any arc furnace thus far designed. And arc furnaces were the hottest
known to man.</p>

<p>Yet, by the statement of one of the engineers in this hooded
organization, seven hours of that arc heat had failed to fuse the two
metals whose union had been the aim of Doctor Junes. Van did not
doubt the statement of the leader standing before him now. And two
thousand more degrees of heat, he realized, would be more than
sufficient, if properly controlled, to effect that world-important
fusion of those two metals.</p>

<p>He was about to speak, when Kag came swaying toward him, leering,
pawing with gnarled, crippled hands.</p>

<p>"Professor Junes!" Kag's voice was shrill, piercing.</p>

<p>"He's not Junes," the hooded man shouted. "He's another scientist.
Junes is dead, burned up in his own furnace!"</p>

<p>Kag's pale eyes rolled wildly in their sockets. "You're not
Junes?" he cried querulously.</p>

<p>"No," Van admitted, watching the man narrowly. There was near
insanity in those crazy, rolling eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hunchback's fawning attitude changed. Crazed genius
glittered in his rocking gaze.</p>

<p>"Ach!" he screamed. "A scientist, are you? It is I who am the
scientist&mdash;the greatest scientist in the world! What do you know of
science&mdash;of fire&mdash;of metallurgy?"</p>

<p>"I was a friend and contemporary worker with Dr. Junes," Van
answered as calmly as he could. This hunchback, he knew, could trip
him with questions, show him up as an impostor. "Tell me, Professor
Kag, what experiments you are working&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kag!" The hunchback's shrill voice trembled with frenzy. "Kag! I
shall tell you nothing! I shall ask you questions! You do not even
know who I am. Kag!"</p>

<p>The Phantom saw the mistake he had made, tried to stop the man's
wild screeching by correcting the error. This man was unquestionably
Dr. Gulliver Vonderkag, once the foremost metallurgical scientist in
Germany&mdash;but now only the shell of him, yet his genius still
raged.</p>

<p>But Van could not make himself heard.</p>

<p>"A metallurgist, are you? Tell me quickly the fusion point of
antimony and copper."</p>

<p>The Phantom's muscles tensed at the suddenness of this crisis.</p>

<p>"Antimony and copper&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van had to hesitate, grope an instant before the answer came to
him. Then he gave it, watching the hunchback nervously. If the German
scientist shot many more such questions at him, he'd be stuck, and
his Bendix role unmasked.</p>

<p>"Slow," Kag cried in disgust. "Dr. Junes, he would have been
quicker. I could have used him in my work. But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've no choice in the matter, Kag," the hooded leader said
flatly. "Test him again."</p>

<p>The Phantom's mind fought against Vonderkag's warped brain, beat
the crippled scientist's formulating question by sheer audacity and
drive.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" Van shouted. "Let us stop this kindergarten child's
game. I am interested only in your knowledge of Dr. Junes' work&mdash;his
experiment which he refused to continue."</p>

<p>"Refused to continue?" Kag demanded shrilly. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"Fusing aluminum and calbite," the Phantom declared in a loud,
challenging voice. "Dr. Junes, as you've been told, was killed, but
before he died, he had refused to carry on the fusion. He was
afraid. I know what he feared. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Kag screeched the word as though it had come from a
foreign tongue and had no meaning for him. "Are we men of
science?"</p>

<p>Somebody pounded on the door. The hooded leader swung round,
unlocked the door, let in a man dressed similarly in hood and robe
but without a mask. On the sleeve of the newcomer was a green circle
with a zigzag line running through it.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Sergeant?" the masked man demanded.</p>

<p>The hooded sergeant saluted briskly, swinging his arm in toward
his stomach and out again. He stepped around a water pail, his leg
brushing the dipper sticking out of it as he handed over a sealed
envelope.</p>

<p>"Something that demands immediate attention," he stated.</p>

<p>As the man in the mask ripped open the envelope and extracted the
folded sheet of note paper it contained, Van signaled Lannigan to be
ready, and edged closer to the leader whose eyes narrowed dangerously
as he read the penciled notation.</p>

<p>For a swift instant, Van caught a glimpse of that note, got a
flash view of the words:</p>

<p><i>Professor Bendix suspected of being sent as a scientist spy from
the capitalist publisher&mdash;</i></p>

<p>He managed to catch the name Havens in the note. As he moved, Van
remembered he'd used Havens' name in Niagara Falls. The invisible
organization had caught up with him!</p>

<p>But what he did now he had already planned to do in that continued
moment of suspense when Vonderkag had challenged him as a
metallurgical scientist. The crisis demanded instant action; Kag was
forgotten for the instant.</p>

<p>With one quick swing, so swift as to be almost undetectable, Van's
right arm shot out and downward as his hand gripped the water pail,
lifted it, swung its contents straight into the hissing gas flame in
the center of the floor.</p>

<p>Instantly the entire room became a dense fog of swirling, blinding
steam. The Phantom whirled, and his fist cracked against the jaw of
the nearest mine guard. He yanked the gun from the falling man's
hand, heard the harder crack of Lannigan's hamlike fist as Jerry
slugged the other guard.</p>

<p>"Out!" Van barked.</p>

<p>The next second he was through the door with Jerry puffing behind
him. Back of them in the furnace chamber, shouts and shots sounded as
slugs pounded into the wall after them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT - LANNIGAN'S TRICK</h2>

<p>Near the first turn in the inclined passageway, the Phantom
stopped to make sure Lannigan was still coming. The big Irishman
plunged past, carrying something heavy over his shoulder.</p>

<p>They raced on up, lunged into the larger cavern above. The place
was empty.</p>

<p>Van slammed the door shut, slid down an iron crossbar, locking it.
He jerked out his pencil flashlight that the guards had not taken
away from him. In its thin shaft he saw Lannigan dumping the hooded
figure of the sergeant on the floor.</p>

<p>"How long can we hold them off?" the Irishman demanded. "I brought
this guy along so that you could use his costume."</p>

<p>"Not very long, Champ," the Phantom said tersely. "They'll shoot
the door off its hinges." He looked quickly at the sergeant. The
unmasked face was ordinary, unintelligent. "Get into those robes
yourself," the Phantom directed. "One of us has got to get out of
this mine and get to Havens. You're elected." He bent down over the
unconscious man, began unfastening the black hood.</p>

<p>Shots began crashing into the barred door as Van handed up the
costume to Lannigan.</p>

<p>"I'd rather stay here and let you go up, Phantom," Jerry growled
as he shrugged into the black outfit.</p>

<p>"I've got to stay. Got to find out more about this organization
and the metal they're fusing with that heat," Van insisted. "You get
to Havens and fly back here. He'll know what to do when you tell him
what's happening. Come on!"</p>

<p>Van's light guided them through the door through which they had
first come. Behind them, the barred entrance to the passageway below
was trembling on its hinges under the onslaught of the hooded leader
and Kag and the hunchback's four burly helpers.</p>

<p>With Lannigan running ahead in the disguise of the sergeant they
ran swiftly along the level tunnel toward the first guarded gate.
Suddenly, Lannigan ducked into one of the side passages as a bobbing
electric headlight on the cap of someone approaching gleamed in the
darkness ahead.</p>

<p>Van slid in beside Jerry. The racket of shots and shouts back
along the passageway echoed and re-echoed against the walls.</p>

<p>"That's the guard at the next doorway," Van warned. "You've got
the black uniform, Champ. Go get him!"</p>

<p>Lannigan's grunt of satisfaction was eager. He took Van's pencil
flashlight, stepped out in the path of the advancing guard.</p>

<p>"What's going on down there?" the man shouted excitedly.</p>

<p>The torch in Lannigan's hand gleamed, caught the guard full in the
face, outlining his hood and robe and the revolver in his fist.</p>

<p>He jerked to a halt, stopped by the blinding glare of the flash.
Jerry gave him no chance to ask anything more. The big Irishman's
hammerlike knuckles hit the guard's jaw. The fellow seemed to bounce
up off the floor of the tunnel, hang suspended in the air an instant
before he dropped back and lay still.</p>

<p>The Phantom darted out, snaked the black costume off the man's
body, got into it himself. He took the man's gun, ran on again,
urging Lannigan ahead of him.</p>

<p>They were both outfitted in organization uniforms now, and both had
two guns apiece. But there was a maze of black, guarded passageways
and doors ahead of them, and they had still no identification or
countersigns to get them through.</p>

<p>A powerful flashlight sent its beam into the tunnel behind them as
the imprisoned men broke loose from the cavern. The Phantom and the
Champ raced through the now unguarded first gate into the upgrade
underground passage ahead. There was no way of locking those doorways
on the entrance side, for only the guards on the inside of the tunnel
openings could bar them.</p>

<p>"Take the first turn to the left that looks like something!" The
Phantom directed. "We can't take time to lay out every door guard we
come to."</p>

<p>A moment later, as the light grew larger behind them, they whirled
off the main corridor into a side passage that led up sharply. As he
ran, the Phantom tugged off the tell-tale Van Dyke of Professor Paul
Bendix. That character was done now, so far as this mysterious
subterranean organization was concerned. He thrust the beard up into
a crevice between the wall and a wooden tunnel brace, and caught up
with Lannigan again.</p>

<p>The passage broke unexpectedly into a large cavern along one wall
of which cement sacks were stacked to the roof. In the opposite wall
was a large steel door built into a heavy concrete and stone
abutment. The door was locked with several large handles and two
wheels that gave it the appearance of a steel vault. The construction
was recent. Van recognized it as a watertight compartment lock, built
to hold back one of the subterranean lakes found in all deep mines.
This lower level series of shafts and channels under the operating
portion of the coal mine had evidently been used and abandoned, for
there was no sign of recent operation this far down and they had come
upon no workmen.</p>

<p>There were three exits from this cave, one of them unmarked, the
other two marked respectively in chalk on their frame braces: SHAFT 9
and CAGE.</p>

<p>"Which way, Skipper?" Jerry asked.</p>

<p>The Phantom stopped running, glanced back and listened. For a
moment there was no sound of pursuit.</p>

<p>"The cage," Van answered, and led the way. "We'll probably run
into someone. Don't shoot if you can use your fists."</p>

<p>They advanced more cautiously, and as they went forward along the
slightly rising tunnel, Van manipulated some of the make-up of Dr.
Bendix that remained on and inside his face.</p>

<p>His nose became more normal as he removed the two small aluminum
pieces that had given it the broadened, heavy appearance. The
injection of the specially prepared compound that he had shot into
his cheeks and jowls had already been partially absorbed and
dissipated. He ordinarily had to renew his make-up for any disguise
every twenty-four hours. It was, he realized, only the dumbness of
his captors and the demand for speed on the part of their leaders,
that had made them forego the opportunity they had had to strip him
while he had been unconscious.</p>

<p>Even so, it required the expert, trained eye of a physician to
detect the fact that one of his complete characterizations was a
fraud. By the time he and Jerry had gone another two hundred yards
through the shaft, the face of Professor Paul Bendix had completely
disappeared, although beneath the black robe Van wore, the frock coat
was still a dangerous piece of evidence.</p>

<p>"If this tunnel don't end pretty soon," Jerry panted behind him,
"we don't need any elevator. We'll have walked out of here!"</p>

<p>"Just so we get you free of this place, Champ," Van replied.</p>

<p>A half minute later a voice challenged them from somewhere ahead,
and another voice, harsher than the first, repeated the warning.</p>

<p>"Keep going," the Phantom whispered to Lannigan, and answered the
challenge with a terse, "Show your light, you fools!"</p>

<p>A strong torch beam caught them immediately in a blinding glare.
Van stopped, tried to look beneath that light.</p>

<p>"Password!" the harsh voice demanded.</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes glinted. "Two suspected men have escaped from
Professor Kag's shaft!" he snapped, ignoring the password demand. "If
they haven't got this far, send word ahead!"</p>

<p>"Whose orders?" the first voice asked sharply from the intense
blackness behind the flashlight's unswerving beam.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Flannigan is with me," Van said angrily. He glanced over
his shoulder. "Sergeant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jerry stepped to the front, glowering, showing the gun in his
hand. His rough voice bellowed: "Who th' hell is giving orders
here?"</p>

<p>"I am!" the harder voice snapped, and a tall, hooded and masked
man stepped partway into view. On his robed sleeve was the green
circle with two crossed yellow zigzagged markers through it. "I'm
Commander Rotz!"</p>

<p>The authority in his voice was unmistakable. Van tensed, and gave
the peculiar salute he had observed back in Kag's cavern. Lannigan,
too, saluted uncertainly.</p>

<p>And at the same instant, the Phantom's keen ears heard the first
faint sounds of the pursuit far back along the tunnel.</p>

<p>They were trapped!</p>

<p>Commander Rotz heard that growing sound of voices footsteps also,
for he suddenly whipped up his gun, covering them menacingly.</p>

<p>"Stand where you are!" he ordered grimly. "I've seen deserters try
to get away like this before."</p>

<p>The Phantom's left hand jerked abruptly at Jerry Lannigan's stolen
black robe, a hard, unexpected tug that yanked the beefy Irishman off
balance. If Lannigan had made that quick movement himself, some
slight flick of warning would have given him away. But Van's
quickness had precluded that.</p>

<p>In the split-second that the commander with the leveled gun took
to correct his aim, the Phantom's right foot kicked up, hit the
masked man's hand at the wrist behind the revolver.</p>

<p>A sharp cry of pain broke from the fellow's hidden lips. The gun
spun from his fingers. And Van's fist exploded against the man's
jaw!</p>

<p>In the sudden violent confusion, the light fell to the floor of
the shaft as Jerry leaped at the other guard. For a matter of seconds
there was only gasping, strangled breathing. Then the muffled sound
of quick movement and the rustle of cloth.</p>

<p>It was less than a full minute, all told, when Van's fingers found
the powerful torch on the dirt floor and snapped it on briefly. In
its bright light, Lannigan was bent over the dead figure of the
guard, his big hands going through the fellow's clothing.</p>

<p>And the Phantom was standing erect in the black robe, hood and
white mask of Commander Rotz. The lifeless, frock-coated body of a
man who might have been, beneath his masked features, Professor Paul
Bendix, lay at his feet.</p>

<p>Even Lannigan stared twice at the swift, complete transformation
before he recognized the Phantom's voice ordering him to action.</p>

<p>"Drag that guard out of sight somewhere," Van directed tensely.
"Dump him some place where he won't be found immediately. Get on
ahead of me and if you get a chance to get out of here, take it!"</p>

<p>"Okay, Skipper! That's the fastest make-up change I've ever seen
you put on." Lannigan grabbed up the dead guard as the light in Van's
hand turned toward the sloping end of the shaft up which they had
come. The glare of the torch completely hid Jerry's movements behind
it as he carried his burden further up the tunnel.</p>

<p>The Phantom kept his light on, faced the pursuers who were already
shouting to him above the hard, echoing pounding of their feet.
Behind the white mask, his lips were a thin, determined line.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he shouted above the increasing clamor. "Password!"</p>

<p>His voice was harsh and sharp now, like the voice of Rotz. He
recognized in the beam of the electric torch the foremost of the
advancing crew&mdash;one of the mine guards who had been with him in Kag's
cavern. The others were strange faces, men picked up in the search
that had split into several parties.</p>

<p>"September Third!" the guard snapped back at him and saluted.</p>

<p>September Third! There was grim significance in that
countersign.</p>

<p>Van pointed his light down at the figure on the tunnel floor.
"You're hunting for that?" he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>The guard and the others with him stared. The identity of the dead
Rotz would eventually be discovered, but for the moment the
resemblance to Bendix was close enough to fool them. The guard
nodded, glanced up.</p>

<p>"There was another one&mdash;a big, heavy man with red hair."</p>

<p>"Didn't come this way," Van stated with a ring of authority his
voice. "This man was sneaking along here and refused to stop when I
challenged him. I've sent the guard stationed here to report this in
Shaft Nine. Take your men and come with me. I'll send you up to
report on top."</p>

<p>He turned, started up the inclined tunnel in the direction Jerry
had taken. There was a sharp curve in the shaft that ended fifty
yards beyond at a rough gate that barred the entrance to an elevator
car.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Lannigan. The Phantom breathed easier.</p>

<p>"This car shouldn't be left down here now, with a deserter loose.
Take it up," he ordered.</p>

<p>"The fellow wasn't a deserter," the guard leading the others told
him. "He was a spy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll be a dead spy if we catch him," Van promised. "Now get
going with that car and report topside!"</p>

<p>The guard saluted again, got onto the car with the three men who
had come with him. The elevator trembled in its loose, rough
framework as it started to move upward.</p>

<p>The Phantom's light was on it, watching. Where in hell was
Lannigan?&mdash;The question was answered a second later. Only the
protection of the white mask he wore kept back the jolt of sheer
shocked surprise that twisted Van's features; He stared, almost
unbelieving.</p>

<p>Jerry Lannigan's beefy bulk was hanging beneath the rising floor
of the shaft cage, his hamlike hands gripping the cross-bracing under
the car! The Champ let go with one hand, waved to Van, and pointed
down under him.</p>

<p>The Phantom understood. Lannigan had dumped the body of the dead
guard into the elevator well. There was no need even to look.</p>

<p>Van switched off the electric torch, stood in complete
darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE - FIND THE IMPERATOR!</h2>

<p>Half a second later he was running noiselessly back along the
narrow tunnel. Jerry might be able to get through up above. If
audacity and courage counted, Van was confident he would. But there
was more information needed about this subterranean organization down
here, before any outside help would be of value. Without more
knowledge than he had, a raid would only drive the members of this
mysterious society of revolt deeper into their hidden holes.
Somewhere there was a leader, a single brain, governing and directing
this mob-mad legion of doom. Not until that leader was ferreted out
could this terror-inspiring organization be broken up and
destroyed.</p>

<p>The Phantom decided upon a bold stroke. He had got rid of the
clothes of Dr. Paul Bendix, wore now the complete equipment of the
dead Commander Rotz.</p>

<p>And he had the password&mdash;September Third!</p>

<p>He retraced the path up which he and Jerry had fled from Kag's
cavern. In his stolen commander's uniform there was no difficulty in
getting by the reguarded barriers he and Jerry had fought through
before.</p>

<p>He went directly to Kag's cavern. The hunchbacked scientist was
still there, with two of his stripped helpers, and two hooded but
unmasked guards whom Van had not seen before, but who eyed him with
considerable respect.</p>

<p>"I understand there's been some trouble down here," the Phantom
rasped in the voice of Commander Rotz as he entered.</p>

<p>The men, excepting Kag, saluted him with that same peculiar and
suggestive movement of the clenched fist across the stomach.</p>

<p>"A dangerous scientist sent to spy on us for the capitalists," Kag
exclaimed with renewed excitement, and gave a garbled account of
Professor Bendix and his beefy assistant who had been caught and
escaped. "An ignoramus!"</p>

<p>As he talked, the crippled scientist unfastened a blanket from a
heavy, round object on the floor, began stroking the rough,
silver-colored ball of metal.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Van demanded, keeping his eyes off the white jet of
flame shooting up through the center of the floor, but motioning at
the ball with his hand.</p>

<p>"Ach!" Kag's wild eyes rolled and glistened. "A meteoric
fragment!" he exclaimed. "From the Smithsonian Institute. It was the
only proof in the world that aluminum and calbite could be fused&mdash;but
the world lacks that proof now. The Imperator and I alone hold this
secret. Not even the famous Dr. Junes could do what I have done!"</p>

<p>"I've heard about it," the Phantom said. "And you too, Dr.
Vonderkag."</p>

<p>The hunchbacked German expert in metallurgy smiled at the mention
of his real name, and grew more voluble.</p>

<p>"You are interested, I see," he cried. "I will tell you&mdash;I have
fused calbite and aluminum in that flame there, and have made the
lightest, toughest metal ever conceived by man! Soon, we plan to
manufacture this for our own purposes, in quantity!"</p>

<p>Kag's statement ended in a series of shrieks and idiotic chuckles
of secret merriment. Van wanted to ask him more, but at that moment
another sergeant entered, stared round and saluted him, handing over
a note. The Phantom accepted the piece of paper, read the order
printed in pencil:</p>

<p>IMPERIAL BOARD STAFF MEETING</p>

<p>IMMEDIATELY IN THE SHAFT 9</p>

<p>BARRACKS. KINDLY ATTEND.</p>

<p>THE IMPERATOR.</p>

<p>Van stared at the order through narrowed eyes, his every nerve
alert and tingling. He nodded at the sergeant, shoved the paper into
a pocket under his black robe.</p>

<p>"I shall call upon you again, Professor Vonderkag," he said, and
strode out.</p>

<p>As he went back up the incline and out into the main corridor, he
noticed with surprise that the passageway was now heavily guarded,
with sentries stationed every thirty or forty yards. Each of them
threw their electric torches upon him and saluted him as he
passed.</p>

<p>Several other men were standing along some distance ahead,
receiving the same crisp salutations as himself. It didn't seem
possible that he was soon to meet the Imperator in person. Yet the
Imperator's name was the authority on that order in his pocket.</p>

<p>He passed through the cavern where the steel water door was set in
the concrete, followed the two men ahead of him into the underground
corridor marked SHAFT 9. The tunnel curved to the left away from the
passage that led to the elevator cage up which Lannigan, he hoped,
had made his escape.</p>

<p>Two guards at a heavy wooden door took up his written order,
passed him on into an extraordinarily large and long chamber of
cavernous height. The place, lighted by lanterns that threw grotesque
shadows along the walls, was already a scene of weird assembly.</p>

<p>All of the men present were robed, hooded and masked. Each of them
wore upon his sleeve a green circle of the clan. And through each
circle ran the double zigzag emblem that marked them as ranking
officers.</p>

<p>There was no fraternizing. The men did not gather in the usual
small groups while they waited. Each man stood aloof from his
companions, as though afraid of being caught discussing their mutual
organization affairs.</p>

<p>The Phantom moved over against a wall, looking about eagerly for
some centralizing nucleus to this strange silent gathering, There was
no dais, no raised platform.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without preliminaries, an incisive, chilling and
metallic voice filled the cavern&mdash;the same voice that had come over
the air to announce the Rock Creek Dam disaster sixty seconds before
it happened.</p>

<p>Van's darting eyes slid over the room, searching for the source of
that metallic flow of words. Of the fifty men present, not a lip
moved. Yet the voice went on:</p>

<p>"Attention, officers of the Invisible Empire! Rock Canyon Dam has
been successfully destroyed! Not a clue that could be traced to us
was left. And only ten of our men were obliged to sacrifice their
lives to protect our Order. Their families, according to our
constitution, will be financially independent now for seven
generations."</p>

<p>Van's eyes glittered behind his white mask as the full
significance of that statement struck him. With such a guarantee of
financial security as a reward for sacrifices to this carefully
schemed out organization, there was practically no limit to the
hysterical courage which such a bait engendered.</p>

<p>The cold, inhuman voice went on: "Our next attack upon the
government will occur at dawn on September 3rd. I myself, at that
hour four days hence, will bomb the United States Treasury Building
at Washington, using the airplane that has been built of the
aluminum-calbite metal being manufactured here. A new explosive, more
powerful than the explosive used at Rock Canyon, will be dropped from
my plane. I shall detail a detachment to carry here the United States
Treasury gold."</p>

<p>Throughout the cavern there was a sharp intake of greedy breath as
this announcement was made. But the invisible speaker continued
emotionlessly:</p>

<p>"One other matter at this time. Through our intelligence service I
have been warned that a capitalist scientist, Dr. Bendix, has
attempted to gain admittance to our headquarters here. It is
suspected that Mr. Frank Havens, an enemy publisher, has employed
this man.</p>

<p>"A Professor Bendix and an assistant did appear here. I have two
reports, neither of them checked sufficiently. One is that these two
men escaped. The other is that one of them, presumably Bendix has
been killed. I shall send at once a man disguised as Doctor Bendix to
visit Mr. Havens in New York. This envoy will remove the publisher. I
call for a volunteer."</p>

<p>Instantly, the Phantom's hand was raised in the air and his voice
rang out:</p>

<p>"I, Commander Rotz, offer myself for that honor!"</p>

<p>There was an imperceptible silence while the eyes of every officer
in the room turned toward him. Then the chilling voice of the unseen
speaker again:</p>

<p>"Commander Rotz is accepted. He will advance at once, at the
conclusion of this meeting, along the unnumbered gallery next to
Shaft 9. He will be met. That is all, gentlemen. I, the Imperator,
have spoken!"</p>

<p>The Phantom's pulse pounded wildly. He out-stared the eyes
watching him, turned quickly and strode out of the barrack cavern,
the Imperator's icy words ringing in his ears:</p>

<p>"Advance along the unnumbered gallery."</p>

<p>He would be met.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN - HORROR CAVE</h2>

<p>Van was gripped by the first real hope of unmasking the power-mad
genius behind the Invisible Empire. It quickened his senses, keyed
him to alertness.</p>

<p>Not once since he had tricked his way into this maze of
subterranean passageways had he been able even to guess at the
position of the headquarters of the organization. It would have been
impossible to track out the black, labyrinthian corridors of this
vast series of connected mines and expect to stumble upon the center
of the hooded society.</p>

<p>Nor had he heard anyone except Kag mention so much as the
existence of a leader. He suspected none of the robed members or the
guards had ever seen the Imperator face to face. There seemed to be
some unwritten law against speaking his name.</p>

<p>That was the most baffling phase of this strange underground
hunt&mdash;the utter and impregnable silence of the members.</p>

<p>The Phantom had considered Vonderkag as a suspect, but the
hunchback scientist seemed too excitable, too unstable to govern such
a ruthless association of men. Yet, apart from Kag, who was there, of
all those masked and hooded members, that he could challenge as being
the Imperator? A single such open attempt would only end in his
immediate death.</p>

<p>The fifty masked officers who had attended that cryptic meeting in
the cavern barrack were automatically eliminated as ultimate
Imperator suspects, for that cold, emotionless speech had been
delivered from some point outside that underground chamber.</p>

<p>Van had thought of trying to escape from this subterranean warren,
to contact Havens and get help. He'd have to get out and warn the
publisher, after this last threat. But to have these tunnels
surrounded by police or soldiers would be useless. The Invisible
Empire would only fade deeper into the mines and emerge at will from
a hundred different exits.</p>

<p>He was stopped by two guards at the entrance to the tunnel leading
off from the cavern that had the concrete walled water door of steel.
They let him through at mention of the name Commander Rotz.</p>

<p>He went on alone, his flashlight outlining the earth walls of the
sharply rising passage.</p>

<p>The tunnel curved several times, and ended at an iron door that
was unlocked. He swung it open, found that it was the entrance to an
elevator. The car was empty.</p>

<p>Van stepped into the cage, closed the iron door, and tried the
operating lever. The elevator would not lower, but it went up rapidly
when he reversed the control.</p>

<p>So far as he could determine, there were no stage landings until
the car stopped of its own accord. He opened the door again, stepped
out into a short corridor.</p>

<p>Two more guards in robes, masks and hoods, stood before the only
exit, a narrow steel door set in a wall of cement at the end of the
passage. There was an electric battery lamp over their heads.</p>

<p>The Phantom advanced, gave his name again. A key jangled in the
lock, and the door swung open for him. He stepped through the opening
into a lighted room of solid white concrete, heard the door close and
the lock click behind him.</p>

<p>An odor of disinfectant and medicine permeated the place which was
a combination surgical ward and operating room. Against one wall was
a glass cabinet holding several trays filled with delicate,
razor-sharp instruments. Beyond it was another door opposite the one
he had entered, closed and evidently locked from the other side.</p>

<p>In the center of the room stood two operating tables, with space
to work between them.</p>

<p>Van's eyes slid around the place, and a low moan sounded behind
him. He turned, stepped behind a screen, looked down at a cot. On
that stiff bed lay a man whose face was scarcely recognizable as
human!</p>

<p>Van gazed pityingly into the agonized eyes of the helpless
patient, and drew in his breath sharply. The skin on that mutilated
face had been removed from more than two-thirds of its area. The
cheeks, jowls, jaw and nose were raw flesh, and both ears had been
amputated. The pillow upon which the head rested was bloodstained,
sticky with gore.</p>

<p>The man's eyes clung to the Phantom's masked face wildly, then
roved to the bed stand at the head of the cot. Van followed that
tortured glance, and started at what he saw.</p>

<p>On the enameled top of the stand lay a gold badge and an
identification card. He picked them up, his own eyes narrowing as he
read the name:</p>

<p>JUD MARKS</p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation</p>

<p>Van's hand shoved back the black hood he wore, and jerked off his
white mask. He reached beneath his black robe and his fingers dug
into a pocket in the belt he wore under his clothes.</p>

<p>Then he bent over the man on the bed, and held before the Secret
Service operative's eyes a small, flat platinum badge studded with
bright diamonds set in the shape of a mask&mdash;the Phantom's seal. Few
men had ever seen that badge, but its legend was a by-word of
accomplishment in police circles, an emblem of terror among
criminals.</p>

<p>The eyes of the tortured F.B.I. man became alive with recognition
and hope as he stared at the diamond mask in Van's hand. He tried to
nod, and his bloody lips formed the word "Phantom!"</p>

<p>Dick Van Loan replaced the badge in his belt, bent again over the
man on the bed.</p>

<p>"Can you talk?" he asked eagerly. "Who brought you here?"</p>

<p>The G-man's mangled face shuddered with the effort to answer. His
words came slowly, painfully weak:</p>

<p>"An attempt had been made to rob Smithsonian Institute&mdash;I
was&mdash;guarding it&mdash;Hoods&mdash;like yours"&mdash;his agonized glance roved over
Van's black costume&mdash;"jumped me&mdash;stealing a&mdash;meteor from&mdash;ore case.
Been trying to make&mdash;me talk about the Bureau&mdash;since I woke up
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van's eyes gleamed. That meteoric fragment he'd seen and that Kag
had boasted about down in the furnace cavern&mdash;it had come from the
Smithsonian Institute. Kag had gloated over its theft.</p>

<p>"Who did this to you&mdash;here?" he urged.</p>

<p>"A doctor&mdash;big man&mdash;couldn't see his face&mdash;I'm dying."</p>

<p>The F.B.I. man's hand moved beneath the thin, stained sheet.</p>

<p>Van pulled back the bloody covering, saw that Jud Marks was
shackled to the bed. More skin had been cut from his arms, chest and
stomach. The G-Man's fingers gestured&mdash;desperately.</p>

<p>The Phantom gripped that bony hand, held it warmly, while his
narrowed gaze clung to Marks' glazing eyes. The man was dying, and
knew it.</p>

<p>Van swallowed back the burning, hard lump choking in his throat.
This was death, ruthless, horrible, yet a blessed relief for Jud
Marks from the torture of unceasing pain.</p>

<p>The G-man's fingers in the Phantoms' hand slowly relaxed. The
Federal agent's eyes became glassy, vacant, staring sightlessly.</p>

<p>Van lowered the limp hand to the bed, pulled the sheet up over the
dead man's ghastly face. Gravely, a bleak look of intense
determination growing in his eyes, he picked up and pocketed Jud
Marks' badge and identification.</p>

<p>If Van escaped from here alive, those two grim articles would be
returned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Washington. And
the name of Jud Marks, G-Man, would appear on the engraved honor roll
there, another hallowed addition to that heroic record of courageous
warriors who had lost against crime.</p>

<p>As he stood there moodily, his thoughts still on the murdered
Federal investigator, the Phantom's fingers toyed nervously with a
physician's thermometer on the bed stand. He shook himself out of his
brief, grisly reverie, glanced about the room, preparatory to giving
it a quick search. His eyes shifted back to the thermometer in his
hand.</p>

<p>He held it closer, looking for the manufacturer's stamp. And
suddenly an eager gleam leaped into his narrowed grey gaze.</p>

<p>Printed on that sliver of glass, the two words partially rubbed
away by use, was the ownership legend:</p>

<p>Alleghany Penitentiary.</p>

<p>As he stared at that name, Van's mind leaped back to Frank Havens'
office in the Clarion Tower, and the tableau of death that had been
enacted there.</p>

<p>The picture was startlingly vivid&mdash;the murdered metallurgical
expert, Lester Gimble, lifeless in the armchair beside Havens' desk;
the two homicide detectives with Captain Walters; Havens himself; and
the three officials from the Alleghany Prison.</p>

<p>Warden Jack Bluebold; Dr. Maurice Jessup, the resident physician:
ex-Congressman Harry Arnold, Chairman of the Board of Pardons and
Parole. Van hadn't forgotten them.</p>

<p>Even at that time, it had struck him as odd that they should have
been sitting in the Clarion publisher's private office at the precise
moment when an escaped lifer from the Alleghany stir was identified
as the dead murderer of the metallurgical specialist employed by
Havens.</p>

<p>The Phantom stepped resolutely across to the instrument tray
between the two grim operating tables, took from it the metal
container for the thermometer that someone had left there. He thrust
the thermometer in its cover, put the case in his pocket.</p>

<p>That slim glass tube of mercury would be used as evidence, if the
time ever came when the facial surgeon and skin grafter was caught.
And he should be here now, if the Imperator still meant to disguise
Commander Rotz and send him as Professor Paul Bendix on the murderous
mission to Havens.</p>

<p>Van glanced at those fine, sharp knives and instruments in the
glass cabinet against the wall! The Imperator's genius for evil went
beyond any make-up table, and resorted to surgery that cut any
moulded living flesh to suit its deadly purposes.</p>

<p>Grimly, the Phantom decided to see it through, despite his
discovery of the thermometer clue and his realization that he himself
would be recognized as Dr. Bendix again. It was an immediate chance
to meet the surgeon, probably the Imperator himself. He pulled the
ghost-white mask back up over his face, tugged the black hood down
over his head.</p>

<p>The two revolvers he had appropriated with Jerry Lannigan down
there deeper in the mine warrens felt good in his belt under the
black robe.</p>

<p>And suddenly he heard harsh, clipped voices outside in the short
corridor where the two masked guards kept watch. Judging by the
different tones that came through the steel door, five or six more
men had just come up in the elevator and joined them.</p>

<p>The Phantom crouched at the door, listening. Some of the words out
there came through distinctly:</p>

<p>"&mdash;found Commander Rotz dead down below&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What're the orders? Do we wait?"</p>

<p>"Open up! Imperator's instruction&mdash;He won't be here now. Get in
there and kill the spy&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voices lowered to whispered directions.</p>

<p>Van's nerves steadied under the desperate change in the situation.
He realized clearly what had happened. The Imperator had already
discovered that the dead man wearing the clothes of Professor Paul
Bendix was not Bendix at all but Commander Rotz himself.</p>

<p>Eventually, that discovery had to be made, and the Phantom's quick
change of disguises shown up. Van had hoped it would not happen so
fast, but now that it had&mdash;He darted across the room, tried the
opposite door, but found it was too securely barred on the other
side.</p>

<p>Out in the corridor the voices faded to an ominous silence.</p>

<p>Van's glance raced to the dead, ghastly face of Jud Marks outlined
rigidly beneath the stained sheet. He leaped over to the narrow bed,
tossed the bloody covering aside, carried the mutilated body to the
operating table nearest the corridor door.</p>

<p>The G-man's body was limp. He propped it up facing the entrance
through which the masked guards would come, managed to get the right
arm and hand in a braced position so the lifeless fingers pointed
accusingly straight at the door.</p>

<p>Outside, the key was scraping against the lock.</p>

<p>Van sacrificed his flashlight, turned it on and set it on the
instrument tray so that its rays centered upon the grisly figure.</p>

<p>With a final swift movement, he turned out the powerful oil lamp
in the room, sprang to the wall and flattened himself beside the
steel door as it swung open.</p>

<p>A horrified oath broke from the lips of the first two guards as
they rushed in. Their momentum carried them past the door, but the
ghastly, spotlighted spectacle held them momentarily frozen in their
tracks.</p>

<p>And in that split second, the Phantom plunged through the doorway
out into the short, dimly lighted passage, his two guns
pistol-whipping the five stunned guards outside!</p>

<p>He knocked three of them down before they could recover from the
charging shock of his attack.</p>

<p>Springing past them, he reached the open elevator door, whirled
into the car.</p>

<p>Both his guns blasted back into the corridor as flaming shots
slugged at him. A masked guard screamed and flopped to the floor. A
bullet nicked Van's knuckles as he jerked the door shut, grabbed the
control lever.</p>

<p>The cage started down swiftly, the grating rattle of its descent
drowned in the echoing barks of gun fire above.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN - ON TOP</h2>

<p>There was no guard at the bottom of the elevator shaft when Van
stepped out of the car.</p>

<p>He made his way back to the big cavern where he had entered the
unnumbered tunnel. The two hooded sentries were still posted there,
but they let him pass when their torch lights showed the green circle
with the two zigzag yellow stripes of an Empire officer on his black
sleeve. Evidently no general alarm had been sent out for him, since
he was supposed to be securely locked up in that subterranean
concrete operating room.</p>

<p>The Phantom passed on into the main tunnel from which he and Jerry
Lannigan had fled to make their escape from their original guards. He
turned left, away from the direction of Vonderkag's gas cavern.</p>

<p>He was moving without a light, but the guards at the tunnel gates
ahead of him, were satisfied with his officer's insignia and with the
password, September Third.</p>

<p>When he had got by the last of the six doors he'd counted on his
way in blind, he discarded the robe, mask and hood. A quarter mile
further on he came to a fork in the shaft, and took the tunnel that
had the heaviest bracing.</p>

<p>The passage climbed steeply, opened into a broader shaft up which
ran a cog-wheel rail line for coal cars. There were no cars operating
now. Van struggled up the long, sharp incline, came out upon a slag
dump beneath stars and a bright moon.</p>

<p>He ran off the dump, darted along a mountain side, and dropped
down to a dirt road. The fresh night air that filled his lungs gave
him new energy. He followed the road, heard a railroad train laboring
up a grade somewhere in the near distance.</p>

<p>Van had no definite idea where he was, except that he was in the
heart of a coal mining district, probably in Pennsylvania. But
fifteen minutes later, when he walked into a small town, his location
assumed a grim significance.</p>

<p>The name of the town, Mountainview, was the post office address of
the Alleghany State Penitentiary!</p>

<p>Van had Frank Havens on a long-distance phone connection to New
York City within ten minutes. He was talking from a booth in the
waiting room of the local railroad station. He didn't dare say much,
and used the name of another Phantom alias, Jimmy Lance.</p>

<p>"I'll be at the Mountainview Hotel," he informed Havens. "Is
Lannigan back yet?"</p>

<p>"He is," Havens stated. "And he'll fly me right out there."</p>

<p>"That saves me asking you to come," Van said appreciatively. "It's
hotter here than you think. Bring along all the authority you can. If
I'm not at the hotel there'll be a message for you. Anything else
happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Havens told him tersely. "The Twin-City Power Dam at
Minneapolis was destroyed by a blast&mdash;one single blast did it&mdash;to-night!
And several more hooded men were reported seen at the disaster
immediately after the explosion. The Twin-Cities are in a panic,
partially without light, and the State Militia has been called out by
the Minnesota governor!"</p>

<p>The Phantom kept back the flow of words that leaped to his tongue.
One single explosion&mdash;the new explosive Kag had perfected!</p>

<p>Havens' voice came over the line again:</p>

<p>"I'm leaving for Mountainview at once!"</p>

<p>Van cut off the connection. Enough had been said over the phone.
The clock in the hotel lobby showed ten P.M. when he registered for a
room and locked himself in.</p>

<p>There was still time to visit the prison, if he could get inside
the grim walls. Jud Marks' F.B.I. badge should help him there.</p>

<p>The Phantom spent five more minutes at the mirror and wash basin,
removing the grime of the mines from his face, brushing off the blue
suit he'd taken from Rotz. When he finished, he looked like a
hard-traveled man who might have been a salesman.</p>

<p>It took him twenty minutes to get a local taxi and ride to the
penitentiary on the outskirts of the town. The prison appeared bleak
and grey, and fortlike in the night. It was built on a mountain side,
one high stone wall almost abutting the rock-ribbed mountain
itself.</p>

<p>About the tough prison was an atmosphere of menace and mystery
that seemed to hover even over the wooded, thickly undergrown
background of rugged ranges and deep, boulder-strewn valleys.</p>

<P>Van announced himself to the prison turnkey as a Federal agent
named Jim Lance checking up on the escape of Snakey Willow, shot to
death in New York City. He flashed the murdered Jud Marks' gold
badge, asked to see the warden at once.</p>

<p>A rangy fellow named Rowan listened to the Phantom's preliminary
questions irritably.</p>

<p>"Can't give you no information," the deputy grumbled. "You'll have
to see Bluebold himself. He's in a huddle right now with Mr. Arnold
who's Chairman of the Board of Parole. Dr. Jessup, the prison
physician, and the wall and cell captains are with him. We got Killer
Kline, that two million dollar mail robber and murderer, coming up
here from Pittsburgh to be electrocuted next week. We do all the
state's killings up here, since we built the big new chair."</p>

<p>Van studied Rowan's dull features keenly. The deputy wasn't
impressed by the presence of Jim Lance, G-man, but was obviously in
considerable awe of the Pittsburgh big shot who was to be locked up
here for the last brief week before his official execution.</p>

<p>"Kline gets delivered here in the morning," the deputy went on,
"so we ain't taking no chances on anything happening to him while
he's with us, until he gets the jolt in the electric chair. Bluebold
and the others are in the Board Room getting up their plans to handle
this killer now. So you'll have to wait until they're done."</p>

<p>He took Van into the warden's office inside the prison behind the
double gates of the turnkey's cage, and sat with him for a half hour
until Bluebold and the men in the conference came out of the Board
Room door at one end of the prison chief's office.</p>

<p>During that wait, Van's attempts to get the deputy to talk about
the prison's management failed dismally. The rangy officer was
obviously under orders not to give out any information at all
concerning the activities behind these grim walls.</p>

<p>Rowan had run completely out of conversation when the Board Room
door opened and the conference filed out.</p>

<p>The Phantom eyed the seven men in turn as they entered the
warden's office. They were all big, powerful sharp-glanced, with the
hard look of prison officials accustomed to handling convicts
ruthlessly. The two cell captains and the two officers in command of
the prison wall guards went out immediately. The deputy introduced
Jim Lance, told what he'd come for.</p>

<p>In the austere environment of the penitentiary, Warden Jack
Bluebold was even more rugged and capable looking than he had
appeared when the Phantom had first seen him in Frank Havens' office.
He sat aggressively in the chair behind his desk, eyeing Lance with
shrewd, suspicious appraisal.</p>

<p>Ex-Congressman Harry Arnold, the Parole Board chairman, seemed no
different than he had been in New York. His bearing was confident,
his manner unruffled and assured. The responsibility of handling
Killer Kline and electrocuting the tough murderer hadn't disturbed
the politician's suavely alert and open-minded appearance.</p>

<p>Dr. Maurice Jessup, Van observed, seemed to be the only one of the
three who was not fully satisfied with what had been decided upon in
that Board Room meeting. He kept darting unexpected glances at Arnold
and Bluebold, as though on the verge of declaring himself on some
point which he never quite voiced.</p>

<p>The three officials were no more impressed by the presence of a
G-man investigating Snakey Willow's escape than Deputy Rowan had
been. They listened tolerantly to Van's questions, and Warden
Bluebold became the spokesman.</p>

<p>"Snakey Willow was working in the foundry, welding a job, when
some of the metal kicked back into his face. His welding glasses
saved his eyes, but we had to patch up his ugly map or he wouldn't
have had any face at all. Dr. Jessup's pretty proud of how he fixed
Willow's face."</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup nodded. "I took my time on him," and shrugged. "Willow
told me nobody'd know him, if he ever got out again."</p>

<p>Bluebold jerked open a drawer, thrust a printed "Wanted" police
broadside at Van, The folder gave Willow's Bertillon and fingerprint
measurements and his picture before the lifer had had his face
lifted. The date of release printed on the police notice was four
days old.</p>

<p>"Hell!" Bluebold exclaimed. "Deputy Rowan here, who was in charge
of the prison while I was on a trip to New York, reported the escape
as soon as it was discovered, and had that broadside sent out. I
admit we've had some graft and corruption going on here under our
noses, but we're getting that cleaned up. I fired eight inside guards
today!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Rowan nodded. "Those eight screws won't be sneaking in any
more contraband."</p>

<p>"Besides bringing in whiskey on their hips," Dr. Jessup exclaimed
caustically, "those guards were bringing in dope!"</p>

<p>Van handed back the police broadside to Bluebold.</p>

<p>"I'm not through cleaning up this prison," the warden declared
determinedly. "But it takes time to ferret out these rats who've been
wearing guards' uniforms around here. Mr. Arnold is going to appear
before the state legislature with a bill that will make it a felony
for a state penitentiary employee, guards and civilians both, to be
caught carrying in or out anything that isn't permitted in the book
of prison rules. The way it is now, all I can do is can these birds
whenever we catch them trying to slip something over on us!"</p>

<p>The Phantom nodded, letting them talk.</p>

<p>"All they lose is their jobs," Harry Arnold emphasized. "We can't
prosecute them. This is the toughest prison in the state, a sort of
Alcatraz where the hardest criminals are sent. Those crooks usually
have plenty of money and friends outside the walls, so you can
understand, Mr. Lance, the profit there must be in bringing
contraband in here to the prisoners."</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup, Warden Bluebold and Deputy Rowan jerked their heads in
agreement, their eyes on Van.</p>

<p>"I'd be safe in saying," Harry Arnold went on, "as I'm going to
say to the state legislature, that without a law putting a high
felony penalty on such violations of our penitentiary rules, the
crooked guards and civilian employees can, and do, make ten times
their salary carrying in contraband and taking out uncensored letters
to be mailed without our knowledge!"</p>

<p>Van asked bluntly, "How do you figure Snakey Willow got out?"</p>

<p>Warden Bluebold's eyes glinted. "Outside help did it!" he snapped.
"This prison is escape-proof from within. There's a double count when
the cons are locked in their cells at night, and again when they're
let out to go to the shops in the morning. That count is checked
twice each time before the cell doors are locked. At the shops and
wherever the men work, there are between two and four guards who are
responsible for the number of cons they handle. Willow's changed face
might have helped, but you can't blame Dr. Jessup for that."</p>

<p>"If the guards are corrupted with money outside when they're off
duty," Arnold put in, "all the warden and his deputies can do is wait
until something arouses their suspicions, or until a convict
disappears. We know the cons can't get out without help. It's the
screws and the civilians who aid in the few escapes we've had. We're
organizing a spy system among the guards themselves, which should
help us detect crookedness before anything serious happens."</p>

<p>The four prison officials talked on, emphasizing what they'd
already said, repeating themselves in different words. The Phantom
recognized the hard logic in their statements, but could not break
through the defense barrier they were building against him. The whole
story was not coming out, whatever it was. They were ganging up on
him, holding him off with reiterated generalities.</p>

<p>"How about the hospital?" he demanded. "Prison hospitals are apt
to be a breeding place of corruption, due to the necessity for less
iron-bound rules."</p>

<p>Dr. Maurice Jessup glanced at him with a gleam of contempt.
"Perhaps that is true in other penitentiaries. It isn't true
here!"</p>

<p>Warden Bluebold thrust out his jaw. "Our hospital is the hardest
spot in this institution to get into. A convict is damned sick before
he's admitted. We don't even allow visitors to go through that part
of the prison without a special guard as a guide. Dr. Jessup is as
much a disciplinarian as I am, besides being a very exceptional
doctor and surgeon."</p>

<p>Van's eyelids flicked. They were putting this on heavy now&mdash;too
thickly for him to swallow whole. There wasn't going to be a single
loop-hole for him or any other investigator to use as a starting
point.</p>

<p>He switched his attack, asked suddenly, "Ever had any trouble with
any secret societies around here?"</p>

<p>The four men looked at him with set blankness in their eyes. Then
Arnold chuckled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean, Lance," he said tolerantly. "The papers are
beginning to play up the old Ku Klux Klan idea in connection with the
Arizona dam disaster. About twelve years ago, if I remember right,
there was an organization of Ku Kluxers in these parts, but they sort
of petered out after the national exposure of their political
aspirations."</p>

<p>Warden Bluebold scowled. "If you're really investigating Snakey
Willow's escape, Mr. Lance, you won't get anywhere chasing screwy
newspaper scareheads. The payoff on that was cold cash on the line,
outside, and not any nutty Ku Klux hocus-pocus. I'd suggest that you
try to find the surgeon who fixed up Snakey's mug. That's the angle
that Mr. Arnold, Dr. Jessup and myself are working on."</p>

<p>Van nodded, his veiled gaze hiding the sharp alertness behind his
drooping lids. If that thermometer he'd found, with Alleghany
Penitentiary stamped upon it, meant anything, Warden Bluebold's words
were a direct challenge.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, warden," he said, as though he'd begun to
lose interest in the Willow case. "If you don't mind, I'll go through
the prison tonight, so I won't have to wait over until tomorrow. I've
got to make a routine report on this, anyhow."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," Bluebold stated. "Deputy Rowan will show
you around."</p>

<p>Van shook hands with them, then followed the deputy into the main
corridor opening into the two big dormitory wings of the institution.
Rowan seemed voluble enough now, so long as the Phantom stayed on
generalities.</p>

<p>They walked along railed and lighted galleries past row upon row
of gloomy cells in which the convicts slept restlessly. An occasional
cry of some prisoner in his sleep was the only sound that broke the
peculiar monotone of four thousand men breathing in weary nervous
rhythm.</p>

<p>The great dining hall was a dark, deserted auditorium of long,
narrow tables that gave the vague impression of deserted tombstones,
where their footsteps shuffled ominously loud in the echoing
silence.</p>

<p>In the shops, where shoes and cheap mining machinery were
manufactured by convict labor, the rows of lathes, presses, cutting
machines and drills were grotesque shapes poised in grim stillness,
waiting for the maw of morning when they, would grind again into
endless, heartbreakingly monotonous motion.</p>

<p>Van took particular notice of the enormous foundry as he and the
deputy passed through its shrouded darkness. The high-ceilinged shop
with its two big blast furnaces was peculiarly well equipped, and
there were extra night guards stationed around its thick walls.</p>

<p>"That's the hospital over there," the deputy announced when they
came out into the prison yard again.</p>

<p>He pointed at a four-story stone building set against the grey
prison wall. It was dark, except for a red light over the entrance
and a glow from one of the windows on the top floor.</p>

<p>"I'd take you in there," Deputy Rowan stated with finality,
"except there's an iron-bound rule against visitors, official or not,
going there at night. Black-Jack Bluebold would kick hell out of me
if I let you in. Anyhow, the place is locked and I haven't got the
key on me."</p>

<p>"Who keeps that key?" Van asked.</p>

<p>"Dr. Jessup, when he's inside the
prison," Rowan answered and eyed Van distrustfully. "Other times it's
locked up in the warden's safe. There's a fire exit that can be
opened from inside the hospital, if that's what's worrying you."</p>

<p>The Phantom shrugged. There was no use his trying to break through
the official reserve of these prison officials any longer. They were
telling him just so much, and no more. But there was another way of
getting past their loquatious, calculated barriers.</p>

<p>"Where's the death house cells?" he asked.</p>

<p>"See that light on the top floor of the hospital building?" Rowan
said, his voice hardening. "That's it. There's two guys in there now,
Sam Robbins and Joe Sholtz. We're frying Joe tonight. The electric
chair is where that light shows. They're getting it ready."</p>

<p>The Phantom studied that grim window with the drawn shade a
moment, his grey eyes slitted, his features masking the intensity of
his sharp scrutiny. The shade of death would be drawn across that
window in a few brief hours.</p>

<p>"I've seen enough," he said abruptly. "I'll fix up my report to
the bureau from what information you've given me."</p>

<p>Relief showed on Rowan's face as they walked back to the main cell
blocks and on through to the turnkey's double-doored cage.</p>

<p>Van thanked the deputy, shook hands with him, and was let out into
the starry night. But the Phantom's eyes had become strangely
restless.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE - FAST FLIGHT</h2>

<p>When he got back to town Van stopped at an all-night restaurant.
He had almost forgotten that he was ravenously hungry. But his mind
was not on the food he ate.</p>

<p>He calculated the flying time from New York City to Mountainview,
Pennsylvania, decided that Lannigan and Havens would land at the
small local airport at about two o'clock in the morning. He needed
sleep, but he could sleep in the plane, after he'd convinced Havens
of the necessity for the queer, dangerous action he was planning.</p>

<p>Speed was essential; and next to that, Havens' influence as a
public figure. He'd need Jerry Lannigan, too.</p>

<p>Van had left nothing at the hotel. He went directly to the airport
from the restaurant, found the two small hangars locked and the field
deserted.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently at the edge of the single short runway,
keeping himself awake with cigarettes and frequent nervous pacings,
while his mind went over and over the details of his plan.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past two in the morning, an hour and a half after
the Phantom had reached the forsaken airport, he heard the first
faint drone of an airplane motor. He stared skyward, caught sight of
the red, green and white triangle of the ship's flying lights.</p>

<p>The moon was still out, making landing flares unnecessary. A half
minute later the beat of the motor ceased and the ship drifted down
toward the field, spiraling as Lannigan maneuvered for a short
landing. The twin wing lights flashed on as the ship slid down and
settled on the ground.</p>

<p>Van was at the door of the plane's cabin before Havens had it
unlocked. He jerked it open, flashed his platinum and diamond
insignia at the publisher, and pulled himself into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Get into the air again, Champ!" he ordered.</p>

<p>The roar of the motor as Lannigan taxied rapidly and turned into
the wind, taking off again, gave Van a chance to greet Havens and
slap the big red-headed Irishman on his beefy shoulder. When the ship
was above the mountain ranges, leveling off, Van said determinedly to
Havens:</p>

<p>"You've got to see the governor of Pennsylvania for me right away,
Frank. Is he at the capitol in Harrisburg?"</p>

<p>Havens shook his head, reached forward and tapped Jerry on the
arm. "Pittsburgh, Lannigan," he directed, and turned to Van.
"Governor Young is in Pittsburgh tonight. I talked with him on long
distance after Lannigan got through to me and said you were down in a
Pennsylvania coal mine near Mountainview."</p>

<p>The publisher smiled wanly and added, "I wanted Young to have a
detachment of National Guardsmen ready in that district, in case I
didn't hear from you within the next twelve hours."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't have helped any," the Phantom declared flatly.
"That region is honey-combed with connected mines, for miles around."
He glanced at Lannigan, asked him. "How'd you get out, Champ?"</p>

<p>"I hung onto that elevator until it stopped," Jerry said over his
shoulder as he banked and headed for Pittsburgh. "Then I got into
the shaft bracing beams and climbed on up. I was still in the mine,
but those hoods had disappeared, so I smacked a couple of guys that
got in my way, and found a drift that led me out finally. Jeez, I had
to walk about five miles to get to a phone. A miner drove me to the
Mountainview airport and I chartered a plane. What happened to you
after I scrammed?"</p>

<p>Van's eyes held a faraway look for a moment as he recalled the
burly figure of Lannigan hanging to the bottom of that mine cage.
Then he gave the two men a swift account of his own attempts to
penetrate the hooded mystery.</p>

<p>As he talked, Frank Havens' age-lined face darkened into a frown
of grim worry that matched the graveness of his steady gaze.</p>

<p>"Phantom," he said, "you've taken too many risks already." He
looked down through the cabin windows at the dark, ragged tops of the
mountains. "But we've got to keep on until the Imperator is stopped!
Governor Young will use his soldiers&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van cut him off with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"It can't be done that way, Havens," he insisted sternly. "Even if
the entire district was surrounded, these members of the Invisible
Empire could come and go as ordinary miners&mdash;most of them are
workingmen who've been duped into joining this legion."</p>

<p>"Got to nail the bird who calls himself the Imperator," Jerry
declared. "I was in those mine tunnels myself, and I know! You
couldn't even blast 'em out with that stuff that blew up Rock Canyon
Dam!"</p>

<p>"You see, Frank," Van went on, "the members are too afraid of
their leader to talk, even to save themselves. And he knows that
nothing can drive them out into the open so long as he remains an
unseen emperor, and continues to pay them off. Remember, if any
member is killed, that man's family is guaranteed financial
independence for seven generations! It's a weird idea but it holds
them, makes them willing martyrs."</p>

<p>"Can't he be cut off through his finances," Havens demanded.
"Money can be traced!"</p>

<p>"Not the way he handles it, evidently," Van persisted. "Don't
forget all the small bank robberies, the blackmail pay-offs, the
things he can do with that explosive of his. And now he's going after
the United States Treasury. You can't trace gold, you know. And he
does not keep his money in public institutions, I imagine. That
hospital room he's got underground, is proof enough he can, and
probably does, have vaults buried in those tunnels."</p>

<p>"What's all this got to do with Governor Young, then?" Havens
demanded. "You say you can't use state militia to any purpose."</p>

<p>The Phantom's grey eyes glowed. "The heart of this secret
organization is in that prison at Mountainview, Frank, I've told you
I made a pass at it tonight, and ran into a blank wall. But there's
that thermometer with Alleghany Penitentiary stamped on it. There's
the fact that three men from that institution were in your office at
the time your man was to report to you on Dr. Junes' aluminum-calbite
fusion experiments&mdash;and that man was murdered.</p>

<p>"There's the killing of Junes by these hooded devils, witnessed by
Jerry and myself! There's the theft of that aluminum-calbite meteoric
fragment from the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, and its
delivery to Vonderkag down in the mines. The whole thing ties up with
the fusion of these two metals&mdash;a fusion demonstrated as a
possibility by that fragment itself!"</p>

<p>Lannigan called over his shoulder, "I'm with you, Skipper,
whatever it is you're leading up to. Maybe you didn't get much chance
to keep up with your reading, down in the mine, but the newspapers
are reporting, now that two or three hooded guys were seen at that
Mississippi River explosion in Minneapolis. Mort Lewis, remember the
radio announcer, says he saw two of them hoods himself after the Rock
Canyon blast."</p>

<p>The Phantom nodded to the publisher "Havens told me on the phone,
and the Imperator boasted, in his speech down in the cavern, that the
Arizona disaster had been a huge success for the organization, and
that the new explosive&mdash;the stuff they used in Minneapolis&mdash;would be
dropped from the air on the Treasury Building."</p>

<p>"All right," Havens said curtly. "The prison, you've discovered,
is right on top of this mine district. What's your plan?"</p>

<p>Van looked searchingly at the publisher, and said "I want to get
into that prison in the disguise of Killer Kline!"</p>

<p>Havens jerked in his seat. "That's an impossibility! Kline is the
present Number One criminal in the United States. They're going to
electrocute him almost as soon as they get him into the death house.
He's to die some time during the week beginning September second&mdash;and
that's tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's tomorrow," the Phantom agreed tensely. "And on
September third, the day following, the Treasury at Washington will
be blown up at dawn&mdash;if we don't stop the Imperator in the next"&mdash;he
glanced at the clock on the ship's instrument panel&mdash;"fifty
hours!"</p>

<p>For a long minute the grey-haired publisher pondered. Then he
asked: "Suppose something goes wrong, Phantom? Suppose you're in
there as Killer Kline, and they decide to hold the execution at
once?"</p>

<p>Lannigan turned and eyed them. "They'd have a hell of a time, if I
was there as a witness to that frying! And I'll be there!"</p>

<p>Havens' head moved slowly in negation. "You, nor anyone else, not
even Governor Young himself, Lannigan could stop the warden if he
should decide to strap Kline in that death seat at any hour after the
week set for the execution starts."</p>

<p>"You mean, if somebody there&mdash;maybe the warden himself&mdash;got
suspicious of Kline, or the Phantom?" Jerry demanded.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean," Havens said. "The Phantom is
convinced that the Imperator operates from within that penitentiary.
If that is true, then the Imperator is one of those officials, or
controls them. If he gave the word to electrocute Kline, nothing
could stop that execution."</p>

<p>"Nothing can stop the Imperator's wrecking the financial heart of
the country, until he's caught," Van insisted grimly. "I'm willing to
take my chances in there." Defiance crept into his voice.</p>

<p>Havens eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>"In which instance," the Phantom added pointedly, "you couldn't
ever be sure that I didn't manage to substitute myself for Kline. I
could do it, you know."</p>

<p>A peculiar light, that had no malice in it, gleamed deep in the
publisher's somber eyes. He smiled inwardly, but said sternly:</p>

<p>"That's a threat, Phantom. A challenge. I might even call it
blackmail. In fact, it was I who asked Lannigan to fly us to see the
governor in Pittsburgh."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you agree with me, Frank," Van grinned. "You can make
things so much easier, when you quit fussing about my safety. Here's
a few other things I'd like to have you work on while I catch some
sleep. Get a line on the history of the executives and their
assistants at Alleghany Penitentiary.</p>

<p>"And you, Jerry! Somewhere in the Mountainview district is a
hangar, probably built underground like the new army field hangars.
You won't be flying me back, but you can report to me as a visitor at
the stir, and tell me how your hunt for that all-metal ship the
Imperator has built is coming. Blow it up when you find it."</p>

<p>The Phantom's tired glance covered the two men a moment. Then he
stretched back in the seat, adjusted the safety belt, and cocked
Havens' hat over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Wake me up," he said, "when you get things fixed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN - KILLER KLINE</h2>

<p>It was six o'clock in the morning. Killer Kline was shaken awake
and hurried from his cell in the Pittsburgh jail out a back exit into
an armored car that sped him toward the airport.</p>

<p>In the car with him was another prisoner&mdash;the Phantom.</p>

<p>But that second prisoner had not been booked in any Pittsburgh
jail. Van had been locked in the truck before it had left the
sheriff's garage, as a precaution against spying eyes in the jail.
Only the driver and the two guards&mdash;three special deputies assigned by
Governor Young to make the Kline delivery knew that that second
passenger rode in the steel box behind them. And even they did not
know who he was.</p>

<p>Van studied the shrewd, ruthless features of the mail robber and
machine-gun killer crouching on the iron bench in the armored box as
the truck whirled through the streets. Kline's greenish grey eyes
darted about the interior of the car ceaselessly, in search of a way
of escape.</p>

<p>He was close enough to the Phantom in size, to make a switch a
reasonable risk. Van's gaze noted brazenly the mannerisms of the
criminal, the way he moved his hands, the leering twist of his
lips:</p>

<p>"Going all the way?" he asked Kline bluntly.</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it," the murderer snarled. "They jolted Joe
Sholtz up there in the stone house early this morning, didn't they? I
ain't seen a morning paper yet."</p>

<p>"Yeah," the Phantom answered, getting the tone and inflection of
Kline's sharp, harsh voice. "Four minutes it took to burn him dead.
That's a long time to jerk against those death chair straps."</p>

<p>Beads of sweat began to stand out on Killer Kline's forehead.</p>

<p>"I do it in four seconds with a tommy gun," Kline growled. "It
don't hurt so much, either. By God, I wish I had a tommy gun in my
hands right now! They ain't going to fry me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, glowering at Van distrustfully.</p>

<p>"A smart, tough guy like you," Van encouraged, "shouldn't have to
take the juice.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Kline's voice grated boastfully. "I ain't never stayed
locked up long before. Parties make passes at me to get me out so I
can help 'em pull jobs they ain't smart enough to do themselves." He
shut up abruptly, eyeing Van with suspicion.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you got propositioned that way since you've been in the
Pittsburgh can," the Phantom suggested.</p>

<p>Kline's gaze froze up. "I don't know what the hell you're talking
about!" he declared belligerently.</p>

<p>Van didn't press him further. The Killer's manner implied that
he'd already been approached with a chance to escape. It was what the
Phantom had been expecting and hoping for.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the armored truck stopped at an outlying
precinct station. The only door in the box opened and one of the
three deputies called in:</p>

<p>"Come on out, Killer. This is as far as you go, this trip."</p>

<p>"What th' hell is this?" Kline demanded, and peered out the door.
"This ain't the Alleghany stir?"</p>

<p>That was as far as he got. The deputies yanked him out of the car,
manhandled him into the precinct station's alley entrance.</p>

<p>Nobody except Van and the three officers knew the transfer had
been made. Kline would be booked under another name and hidden in a
constantly guarded cellar cell until the Phantom or Governor Young
sent word to have him finish his last ride.</p>

<p>The armored truck door slammed shut on Van and the car rolled off
again. The Phantom forgot everything else for the next ten minutes as
he concentrated on the make-up task confronting him. Before the truck
reached the airport where a plane was waiting to fly Killer Kline to
Mountainview, Killer Kline had to be reproduced.</p>

<p>From beneath his coat Van took out a paper sack containing the
make-up kit he'd got on such short notice through the influence of
Governor Young.</p>

<p>He set up a small pocket mirror, went to work swiftly. The Kline
character had to be done entirely with the face, for Van would be
stripped and re-dressed in prison clothes at the penitentiary. For
the rest, he had to rely on his own ability to portray the Killer's
characteristics in voice, mannerisms and action.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were no Bertillon figures or fingerprints of
Killer Kline on record at Mountainview. Those records would be taken
there at the stir, and a copy of them mailed to the State and Federal
identification bureaus&mdash;where they would be seized and promptly
destroyed. Van had insisted upon that, to protect the Phantom's
identity from being discovered. Later, if he survived the Alleghany
Prison affair, the records there would be burned, too.</p>

<p>A moment before the truck swerved into the airport gate, a
crumpled paper sack and a small pocket mirror fell from a gun slot in
the steel car wall. The truck drove directly to a waiting ship, its
door was opened, and Killer Kline was hurriedly transferred to the
airplane.</p>

<p>There had been no hitch, no error. And there was none when the
plane landed at the small Mountainview flying field and was met by a
prison van.</p>

<p>Within thirty minutes Killer Kline was booked into Alleghany
Penitentiary, without a hint of suspicion concerning his real
identity, and the commitment papers were being signed by Warden
Black-Jack Bluebold in person.</p>

<p>The same four men who had talked to Jimmy Lance in the warden's
office the night before, now confronted the Phantom in the same
room.</p>

<p>Ex-congressman Arnold and Dr. Maurice Jessup eyed Killer Kline in
austere, watchful silence. Deputy Rowan, with three prison guards,
kept the two doors into the office blocked. They were taking no
chances with the notorious murderer.</p>

<p>"Still think you're the toughest guy in the United States?"
Bluebold demanded harshly.</p>

<p>The Phantom put across his initial act with a snarl of
defiance.</p>

<p>"I've got part of a week to live, starting tomorrow, you big punk!
If you can think up anything during that time that's too tough for
me, give me a crack at it, Peanut-brain! And that goes for the rest
of you bottom rate chislers."</p>

<p>He swung upon them all. "Hell, there ain't a one of you smart
enough to make yourself a buck outside. If it wasn't that the state
paid you a salary, you'd all starve to death! Come on, let's take a
squint at the death house you're so damned proud of."</p>

<p>"You'll take more than a squint at it, Killer," Bluebold
snapped.</p>

<p>"Take him away and give him a bath, Rowan!"</p>

<p>But Rowan didn't take him alone. The three uniformed guards came
along, crowding Van, yet watching him with nervous respect. He'd told
off Black-Jack Bluebold! Killer Kline was the toughest con they'd
ever handled.</p>

<p>Van shed his clothes, and took a secret satisfaction in making the
muscles ripple under his skin as he moved about under the shower.
These screws would think twice before they tried to maul him around.
And his toughness and prowess as a hard guy would get talked about,
which was what he wanted.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure the Imperator had sent an envoy to the real Kline
in Pittsburgh jail. But he intended to give that mystery commander of
the Invisible Empire a reason for wanting him as a member, if brazen
courage and insolent fearlessness would do it.</p>

<p>Deputy Rowan threw him an outfit of prison clothes, drab, worn
garments of faded muddy color that blended with the bleak, hopeless
surroundings. Bluebold himself supervised the Bertillon and
fingerprint records. Then he was herded over to the hospital.</p>

<p>Van's eyes sharpened as Dr. Jessup examined him, in the presence
of the warden and Rowan and Arnold. The four men seemed to take a
grisly delight in observing his physical qualifications.</p>

<p>"If you'd turned out to be a prizefighter or a professional
wrestler, Kline," Dr. Jessup advised, "you'd have got some place in
the world." He glanced at the others. "A wonderful specimen of a
physique, gentlemen. It's really a shame to destroy it by
electrocution."</p>

<p>"Count up the number of innocent and helpless guys Kline has
killed," Harry Arnold said gravely. "Kline, you can't be executed but
the one time. How many men do you figure you've murdered?"</p>

<p>"Who th' hell are you?" Van demanded. "Another punk screw?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Arnold," Bluebold said dryly, "is the Chairman of the Board
of Parole and Pardons."</p>

<p>"If I added you to that list of guys I've rubbed out," Van rasped,
"it would be a hell of a swell idea. Go on back to the Pardon Board
and tell 'em that!"</p>

<p>"You're not going to ask Mr. Arnold for any help, I take it," Dr.
Jessup remarked dryly.</p>

<p>"Nuts to him!" Van exploded. "I wouldn't take a pardon from none
of you dopes. When I crash out of a stir, I do it my way!"</p>

<p>"Let's see you beat the death house, Kline," Black-Jack Bluebold
challenged grimly. "I'll be waiting to shoot you!"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Killer Kline snarled contemptuously. "You, with a gun. I
can imagine! Hell, punk, I'd take it away from you and blow your
damned face off with it!"</p>

<p>"Upstairs with him," Bluebold ordered.</p>

<p>The Phantom was ushered out of the prison physician's office into
an elevator. There were no stairs, he noticed. At the fourth floor,
which was the top, he was shoved out of the car into a steel-walled
corridor at the end of which was a door painted a sickly green.</p>

<p>Bluebold, who had come up with him, pointed to the corridor's end.
"That's the last door you'll ever enter, Kline. The chair is waiting
for you on the other side. It's not a long walk."</p>

<p>Van did not answer. He'd put on his Killer Kline act enough, he
imagined, and didn't want to overdo it. The guards shoved him into a
cell, slammed shut the door which was entirely of steel bars.</p>

<p>There were seven other death cells on the corridor, four on each
side, but none of them were occupied. Since Joe Sholtz had gone last
night, Killer Kline appeared to be the only occupant of the death
house.</p>

<p>But Deputy Rowan last night had mentioned a second murderer
awaiting a future execution&mdash;Sam Robbins. And convicted men who
entered this short corridor weren't supposed to be removed except
through that fatal green door at the end, or by order of the Board of
Pardons. If there'd been a pardon for Robbins, Governor Young would
have mentioned it.</p>

<p>Robbins wasn't in the death house now.</p>

<p>Warden Bluebold and Rowan left him a few minutes later, after a
whispered conference with the two guards on duty. The Phantom sat on
the edge of the iron bed fastened to the wall, staring moodily
through the bars at the empty cell opposite him.</p>

<p>He was on his own now completely. Not even Frank Havens could
reach him on short notice, without the consent of Black-Jack
Bluebold.</p>

<p>And suddenly Van remembered a mistake he'd made. He'd told Jerry
Lannigan to visit him here, keep him informed about the hunt for the
mystery plane. But Lannigan had been seen by the Imperator, or by
several of the Imperator's men; in Dr. Waldo Junes' laboratory at
Niagara Falls, and again in the mine, where Gulliver Vonderkag, the
hunchback scientist, worked with the subterranean gas flame.</p>

<p>During those two periods, Lannigan had been stripped of the
adhesive tape bandages over his eyes and mouth. And Jerry wore no
disguise. If he showed up here, visiting Killer Kline, and one of the
Imperator's men saw him&mdash;The Phantom shrugged off the thought of the
consequences. At any rate, then the Imperator would guess the ruse
that had been put over on the prison officials, and would show his
hand in action.</p>

<p>Presently the elevator door jangled open and two men came into the
corridor. Van could get only a passing look at them down the hallway,
but they were in civilian clothes. He heard one of them mention his
name: "Tough guy Killer Kline."</p>

<p>The two guards stepped over to his cell, unlocked the door, let in
the two strangers, and locked the door again. Van heard them both go
into the electrocution room beyond the green door, evidently so they
wouldn't hear the conversation.</p>

<p>He stared at them sullenly, with the baleful contempt of Killer
Kline himself. The two men were stocky, blunt-featured, shifty-eyed.
They flashed state troopers' badges at him. They looked like
brothers.</p>

<p>"Remember us, Kline?" one of them demanded.</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes narrowed. Was this a trap? "So what?" he
evaded. "I'm Garbo&mdash;I wanna be alone."</p>

<p>"Still the wise guy, eh?" the second one growled. "Well, you got
this far along the route, sap. Want to let 'em fry you?"</p>

<p>"It's me that's gettin' fried, ain't it?" the Phantom snarled. He
was stalling for time, trying to lead them into making some remark
that would let him know what they were after, who they were. "I guess
I got some rights left. If I wanna let 'em cook me, that's my
business, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"That's what you said in the Pittsburgh can," the first of the two
men grumbled. "You haven't got much time to make up your mind."</p>

<p>"I got a week," Van declared, eyeing them slantwise from the
bed.</p>

<p>"That's what you think, chump. Listen!" The two men bent over him,
as one of them prodded the air emphatically with a stubby finger:
"Bluebold's got the authority to squirt the old juice into you any
time after midnight tonight. Your last week starts then."</p>

<p>"Bluebold ain't in no hurry," Van exclaimed mockingly. "The
publicity Killer Kline is bringin' him is plenty. He's eatin' it
up!"</p>

<p>"Balance that publicity against the hundred grand you salted away
out of that last mail robbery. It still adds up to cash on the line
for your liberty. We ain't saying how soon Bluebold is figuring on
watching you burn. He's sore. We offered you a chance at a
proposition down in the Pittsburgh can. Want to talk business
now?"</p>

<p>"You ain't very free with the details," Van growled.</p>

<p>The other stocky stranger elbowed his partner aside, and said:</p>

<p>"Look at the facts, Kline! For that dough, you get snaked out of
here without any fireworks. You join up with our outfit and get an
equity in your own money, and that's a damned sight more than you'd
get trying to buy your way out through a regular stir delivery."</p>

<p>"Keep talking," the Phantom urged, and let himself show some
growing interest.</p>

<p>Evidently Killer Kline had more of an inside track on his proposed
escape than anyone had even dreamed. But Van still didn't know who
these men represented.</p>

<p>"And another thing," the stocky man persisted. "You get taken care
of after you get out of here. That comes with joining with us. The
hideout is free, and you don't have to keep yourself locked up in no
cheap room for a year, or keep jumping from town to town dodging
cops, either."</p>

<p>Van spoke with a gleam of challenge in his sharp eyes.</p>

<p>"For a hundred grand you guys are going to make over the whole
world so everybody'll love me or something? Me&mdash;the top killer of 'em
all! Yeah, sell that plot to the movies, you lugs!"</p>

<p>"Don't get like that Kline," the second man grumbled. "You ain't
heard it all yet. Our outfit's got a croaker that does the best job
of face-lifting in the country. And he's working on a way to keep
fingerprints from growing back again after he grafts new skin on the
fingertips. All that medical stuff goes along with the hundred grand,
soon as you join up."</p>

<p>"You won't recognize yourself, Kline," the first stocky stranger
declared, "after that medico gets through with your map. You'd pay
fifty grand alone for an operation like that, outside."</p>

<p>"Who's the croaker who does those operations?" Van demanded
bluntly. "Why ain't I never heard of him before?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, a lot of smart guys would like to know that," one of the
men told him. "Hell, Kline, we don't even know ourselves who he is.
And what's more, we don't ask."</p>

<p>"And all my dough goes to that doctor?" the Phantom said.</p>

<p>"The dough goes to the organization, the mob," the other fellow
told him. "You'll find out about it when the time comes."</p>

<p>"Gimme a little while to think about it," Van said after a pause
during which they eyed him eagerly. "I'll probably come on in with
you. But I gotta think about it." He saw their eyes cloud, and added
quickly, "I can't pluck that hundred grand of mine out of the air in
this damned stir. I'll have to figure how you can get it."</p>

<p>"Okay, Kline. You got until midnight tonight." The two men glanced
confidently at each other. "You'll be seen before then, if not by us,
by somebody who'll be in the know. And don't forget that midnight
your death week begins. Black-Jack Bluebold ain't a nice guy to be
waiting on, when it's your life he can burn up."</p>

<p>They rattled the door to attract the guards.</p>

<p>"Suppose I get quizzed about your visit," the Phantom said in a
low voice. "What's the angle?"</p>

<p>"We're a couple of state cops, like our badges show," one of the
men winked at him and grinned. "We're trying to find out what you did
with that dough from that mail robbery."</p>

<p>The guard with the cell key let them out, and the elevator at the
end of the corridor made a scraping noise as it took them down.</p>

<p>"Guard," Van called when the two men had gone. "Gimme a
cigarette." And as the guard lit one and handed it to him through the
bars: "Say, I thought I was having a guy named Sam Robbins for
company. Where they got him now?"</p>

<p>"The prison physician, Dr. Jessup, moved him downstairs into one
of the wards," the guard answered indifferently. "Sam complained that
something he ate didn't agree with him. Then he got pretty blamed
sick all of a sudden right after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Ate something that poisoned him, eh?" The Phantom's veiled gaze
was sharp and hard behind the drooping lids.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN - BEHIND THAT DOOR</h2>

<p>The Phantom had three more visitors that afternoon.</p>

<p>Congressman Harry Arnold was brought up by Deputy Rowan, who
left immediately, and the interview was conducted with the bars of the
cell door between them. Arnold was on his official dignity at first,
but he became shrewder and more human as they talked.</p>

<p>"My purpose in coming here," the Congressman stated, "is to
fulfill a formal duty. As Chairman of the Board of Pardons, I'm
obliged to talk with every man condemned to death by the state, to
make sure that he is given an opportunity to try for a pardon if his
lawyer or friends or relatives have not done so."</p>

<p>Van stepped away from the bars and sat down on the end of the
uncomfortable iron bed, studying the politician shrewdly. The man was
rather handsome in a rawboned manner, and the inflection of his
speech was flawless.</p>

<p>"I take my oratory sitting down," Van cut in on him. "After you
get through about the pardon I couldn't get in a couple of million
years, what're you going to talk about?"</p>

<p>Arnold raised his eyebrows appreciatively, and a faint smile
twitched his lips.</p>

<p>"Aside from the fact that you're here in the death house, Kline,"
he said interestedly, "which means that you blundered&mdash;I'd say you
were a pretty smart man. I suppose you won't be afraid to die, until
the last minute or two. Or don't you give a damn any more?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think I don't?" the Phantom asked curiously.</p>

<p>Arnold shrugged mildly. "Your toughness, your hardness, Kline. The
name you've acquired&mdash;Killer. Admirable qualities, sometimes.
But&mdash;there's always the chair at the end."</p>

<p>"Nerts!" Van snapped at him. "I figure I'm in for a battle over
that hundred grand I'm supposed to have tucked away&mdash;and what do I
have to listen to? A sermon!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Jessup's point of view is rather apt," Arnold remarked, his
glance still amused. "It ought to be a shame to destroy a specimen
like you." He turned away abruptly toward the elevator. Over his
shoulder he said, "I may see you again before Bluebold's nerves get
the better of him. I'm afraid your reputation is working against you
this time&mdash;speeding the last hour."</p>

<p>Van lay back on the bed, pondering. Arnold had been present in
Frank Haven's office when the three officials from the Alleghany
Penitentiary had appeared. That was about the only suspicion Van
could attach to him.</p>

<p>Yet Arnold, being a politician, had to be a public speaker and
organizer. It would take a shrewd organizer to build up and control
such a fear disciplined mob of hooded devils as Van had run into.</p>

<p>Arnold didn't seem to possess the ruthlessness needed, hadn't
evidenced such hardness at any rate. Nor had he displayed any
knowledge of either medicine or chemistry&mdash;the two requirements the
leader of the Invisible Empire must possess besides a genius for
organization in secret.</p>

<p>Anyone, the Phantom reasoned, could hire a surgeon to transform
the criminal faces of crooks who chose to become members. He was
trying to consider the prison executives one at a time now, and kept
Dr. Jessup out of the mentally probing picture for the moment. And
anyone could hire a scientist, such as Kag, perhaps.</p>

<p>But the rub was, that no shrewd-minded commander of such a society
as the Imperator controlled, would sensibly care to trust both of the
main mechanical factors in his organization to hired men. He'd almost
have to be an expert in at least one of the two major lines himself,
over and above his executive capacity.</p>

<p>Van's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Warden Bluebold.
Van stood up, leaned against the bars, eyeing the prison chief
sharply.</p>

<p>"How do you like your temporary quarters now?" the big man asked.
He handed Van a fresh pack of cigarettes. "The guards give you lights
for your smokes and tend to your whims okay, Killer?" His attitude
was not sour, but unexpectedly cheerful.</p>

<p>"I'm doing fine," the Phantom told him. "Decided when you're going
to tuck me into the chair and turn on the juice?" He eyed the warden
sharply. "Your pal Arnold is afraid I'm getting on your nerves."</p>

<p>"Arnold? Humph!" Black-Jack Bluebold's voice was a tolerant growl.
"Mr. Arnold isn't tough enough, I'm thinking, to make a good prison
warden. Kline, it takes guys with nerve&mdash;like you and me, Killer! I'm
going to get a kick out of throwing the switch on you."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning?" Van asked pointedly.</p>

<p>"That'll be up to you, in a way," Bluebold told him flatly.</p>

<p>"Saving me for something?" The Phantom's voice was caustic.</p>

<p>"I want to find out where that money is you got on your last
robbery, Kline. The insurance company put it at a hundred thousand
dollars. Want to talk about it now&mdash;or later?"</p>

<p>The Phantom covered his own surprised reaction in a Killer Kline
shrug of contempt. "I was waiting for something like that, you big
punk! Personal shakedown, eh? Suppose somebody beat you to it?"</p>

<p>Bluebold's eyes narrowed dangerously.</p>

<p>"Kline, I've stood about all the insults from you I'm going to
take! I can fry you at midnight tonight, and by God, if you don't
control that dirty tongue of yours, I will turn the heat on you
then!"</p>

<p>Van's voice cracked back at him:</p>

<p>"Why the hell don't you? What's stopping you? What the devil are
you waiting for?"</p>

<p>The warden's face reddened. He started to shout something, but bit
off the words with a snap of his heavy jaw.</p>

<p>"If you've got a proposition to make," the Phantom told him
flatly, "let's have it, Bluebold. You ain't the only one making
passes at me."</p>

<p>"Listen, you rat!" Bluebold growled, his eyes smoldering with
hate, "I ought to come in there and beat that information out of you.
But there's other ways of finding out." His manner changed suddenly,
became icy and deliberate. "I'm not after that dough for myself.
There were two dicks up here to see about that money a while ago.
What did you tell 'em?"</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes glittered. Was Bluebold in with those two phony
state trooper detectives, afraid they were doublecrossing him?</p>

<p>"I told them," Van answered, "what I'm telling you, Bluebold!
Before I cough up about any dough I may have parked somewhere, I want
time to figure out where I come out on the deal."</p>

<p>"I see," Bluebold said stonily. "All right, sucker! Figure it out
your way, but don't figure too damned long. Midnight tonight!" He
strode away from the cell door, stomped heavy-footed into the
elevator and went down.</p>

<p>Van began pacing the narrow cell floor.</p>

<p>He couldn't figure Bluebold out. The man was harder, tougher than
Arnold. And he had a reputation as a ruthless disciplinarian&mdash;an
essential requirement for a man handling any secret society like the
organization that called itself the Invisible Empire.</p>

<p>The Phantom's mind kept reverting to that underground surgical
room where he'd found the Alleghany Penitentiary thermometer. It was
obvious that, if there was a connecting passage from the prison down
to that operating room&mdash;and Van believed such a tunnel existed.
Warden Bluebold would have the greatest opportunity to use it.</p>

<p>With a degree of medical and scientific knowledge that he might
easily be hiding beneath his harsh outward bearing, Black-Jack
Bluebold could be the Imperator.</p>

<p>Van was still thinking about the warden when one of the guards
brought him his supper. And Van's third visitor didn't show up until
almost ten o'clock that night.</p>

<p>It was Dr. Jessup.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask you a favor," the M.D. said without
preliminaries when he came up to Van's cell door. "You don't have to
submit to my request."</p>

<p>From the way he said it, though, there was little doubt that
Killer Kline would conform, or else!</p>

<p>"Going to try to make a specimen out of me?" Van demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm conducting some very detailed experiments and analysis of the
effect of electricity on the human body and brain," Jessup explained
gravely. "I want to examine you more thoroughly than I've
done&mdash;before the electrocution. I'll make the other part of the tests
and experiments, of course, when I perform the autopsy on you."</p>

<p>"Glad you're so cheerful about it," Van said sardonically.</p>

<p>The cold, distant eyes of Dr. Maurice Jessup surveyed him with
sharp eagerness. "Very good, Kline. We'll go down to my
laboratory."</p>

<p>He summoned the two guards, had the cell door opened, and the four
of them got into the elevator.</p>

<p>"Of course," Jessup said as they rode down, "I do this with the
consent of the prison authorities."</p>

<p>The car stopped at the basement, and the Phantom was ushered
across a barren concrete floor into a three room laboratory that was
a strange combination of operating equipment and electrical
instruments. The two guards had come into the main laboratory and
stationed themselves near the door.</p>

<p>"The X-ray pictures come first," Dr. Jessup said, and led Van into
a smaller room on the right. The place was furnished only with a
large X-ray machine, a plate cabinet, and the one chair used for
seating the subject. "Be seated, please," Jessup directed.</p>

<p>The Phantom parked himself in the chair, watching the doctor move
swiftly about the small, compact space. Jessup's cold eyes seemed to
be watching everything at once, and there was no lost motion in his
movements.</p>

<p>Van's back was toward a narrow door opening into the basement
proper, and a screen blocked his view of the larger main
laboratory.</p>

<p>"Damn!" Jessup exclaimed suddenly. "I'll have to get fresh X-ray
plates. Just sit where you are, Kline."</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to have forgotten that he was preparing to
examine a criminal convicted of murder and capable of murdering
again. He hurried round the screen, out into the main lab. Van could
hear his footsteps cross the floor to the third of the three rooms. A
door opened and shut.</p>

<p>For almost a minute there was silence.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, a screaming voice shrilled somewhere out in
the dimly lighted basement.</p>

<p>The Phantom leaped from the chair, reached the narrow door that
opened directly into the basement. As his hand shook the knob, the
voice sounded again, screaming words. "You tricked me! I'm making
explosives for your brainless empire&mdash;I'll expose you&mdash;I'll&mdash;aaahhh
!&mdash;"</p>

<p>The frenzied words broke off in a piercing wail of terror that
chopped off into abrupt, ominous silence, punctuated by the thud of a
falling body.</p>

<p>Van's hand jerked away from the locked door. He swung round the
screen, saw one of the guards still standing by the main door,
poised, a gun in his hand. The other prison guard was running out
into the basement. Dr. Jessup was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>The Phantom ran into the large laboratory as the second guard
snapped out of his paralyzed posture. The two of them rushed out
toward the uniformed screw bending over a huddled figure on the
basement floor.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" the running guard shouted.</p>

<p>"Don't know," the other called. "Never saw him in my life."</p>

<p>But Van had seen that odd, grotesque form before.</p>

<p>It was Gulliver Vonderkag!</p>

<p>The Phantom stared down with narrowed, unbelieving eyes at that
hunchback German scientist. The crippled man was already dead, but as
Van and the two excited guards bent over him, no wounds or marks of
violence were visible.</p>

<p>Remembering the gas fumes that had knocked him out in Dr. Junes'
laboratory, the Phantom stooped suddenly between the guards before
they could stop him, smelled Kag's lips, depressing the no longer
breathing lungs. But there was no odor of gas, no sign of the
purplish discoloration of asphyxiation.</p>

<p>The two guards yanked him back away from the body, and the two of
them lifted the dead hunchback, carried him away into Jessup's
laboratory.</p>

<p>As they laid the body on one of the operating tables, the prison
physician emerged from the smaller room on the left, opposite the
X-ray office. Dr. Jessup was carrying a packet of X-ray plates. He
stopped, stared at the tableau, hurried over to join them.</p>

<p>Van eyed the doctor covertly, noted that the man's seeming
surprise was replaced almost at once by a sharp, professional
interest.</p>

<p>"Who is this man?" he demanded. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," one of the guards exclaimed. "We heard a screech
and some screw hollerin' about explosives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I heard that part of it myself," Jessup declared, shutting off
the guard's answer. "Thought it was a patient in a fit, up on the
floor above." He glanced sharply at Van. "Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Right where you parked me, Doc!" the Phantom snapped. "What
killed him?"</p>

<p>Jessup set down the plate case, started examining the body, while
the others watched him. The doctor's fingers moved expertly over the
dead cripple, removing the clothing, prodding, probing.</p>

<p>When he'd finished, he glanced up, frowning.</p>

<p>"Not a mark on him," he said. "Not a scratch!"</p>

<p>"A guy don't scream like that just from heart failure," Van
remarked and stared keenly at the dead face.</p>

<p>Those wide eyes that had rolled so terribly in Kag's head were
fixed now, concentrated straight ahead in glazed contemplation of
eternity. Staring down at their vacuous expression, the Phantom's
keen gaze caught a tiny fleck of blood that looked like a thread thin
blood-vessel on the white eyeball. He bent over the still, agonized
face, pushed the wrinkled flesh away from the eye socket.</p>

<p>"Mind, doc?" he asked, but didn't wait for permission.</p>

<p>On the outer corner of the left eye was a minute blood clot
covering a needle hole that had penetrated the brain.</p>

<p>Van pointed it out to Dr. Jessup, noticing the worried, lines that
appeared on the surgeon's features.</p>

<p>"Maybe the guards can find the needle that made that puncture,"
the Phantom suggested boldly. "Anyhow, Doctor, it took a medical man
to know how to kill a guy that way."</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup looked at Van sharply, startled, but was too slow to
stop him as the Phantom stepped back and crossed to the small room
from which the doctor had emerged a minute after the murder.</p>

<p>Van reached the open door, stared swiftly through. A man moving
fast could have got out of that room through a door, met and killed
Kag, and got back into the room again before even the paralyzed guard
could have seen him.</p>

<p>He scowled, stared again through that open doorway. A single
glance covered the whole of the small room. There was not a door or a
window in it, and the walls, like the walls of the other rooms, were
of solid concrete.</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup couldn't have got out of there unless there was a trick
door. Van had no chance to search for one. He was still Killer
Kline.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN - THE VOICE</h2>

<p>As the Phantom swung back into the main laboratory, heavy, quick
footsteps sounded out on the basement floor, and a moment later
Warden Black-Jack Bluebold stood staring at them all through the
doorway.</p>

<p>"What the hell's going on down here?" he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>Then his eyes saw the naked hunchback on the operating table, the
clothes strewn on the floor. His gaze hardened and his face became
rocky as he advanced into the room. But by neither expression nor
gesture could Van detect recognition in the beady-eyed prison chief's
manner as he stared down at Vonderkag's white face.</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup told him grudgingly what had happened, and why Killer
Kline was present. Still, the stolid features of the warden betrayed
no emotion other than anger and resentment. Bluebold was either a
consummate actor, or else his thick-skinned reactions were limited to
ruthless malice.</p>

<p>"Where's Rowan, that damned deputy of mine, the lazy devil!"
Bluebold growled. "I want this body got the hell out of here in a
hurry! What am I running here, a prison or a madhouse?"</p>

<p>"How about finding out who killed that hunchback?" Van
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Bluebold's beady gaze glittered dangerously. "Since when
did Killer Kline start worrying about catching murderers? You shut
up, or I'll hang this bump-off onto you!" He went to one wall,
grabbed the phone receiver off its hook, barked into the
instrument:</p>

<p>"Get me my office, Muldoon&mdash;Hello, Rowan?&mdash;Send a guard detail
down to the hospital basement. Man killed here&mdash;I don't know&mdash;Oh, he
is, eh? Be right up."</p>

<p>He turned back to Jessup. "Arnold just came into my office. Wants
us to bring Killer Kline up there right away."</p>

<p>"We'd better go along then," Dr. Jessup said. "I'll finish with
Kline afterwards."</p>

<p>"If we don't fry your specimen first," Bluebold said sourly.</p>

<p>Van went with them through a heavy door in the hospital basement
wall, down a flight of steps into an underground concrete connecting
passage, electric lighted, that brought them out into the corridor
behind the warden's office.</p>

<p>Rowan and Harry Arnold were alone in Bluebold's private room when
the three of them entered.</p>

<p>"Lock Kline in the Board Room with a couple of guards," Arnold
said curtly. "I've got a surprise for you." He smiled blandly at the
prisoner. "We'll let you in on our surprise in about ten minutes,
Killer."</p>

<p>Jessup was repeating the circumstances of the killing, back in
the hospital, to the Pardons Board chairman when Rowan took Van into
the Board Room through the door that opened from the warden's office.
Rowan put two guards in with the Phantom, went back and joined the
other three men.</p>

<p>Van borrowed a smoke off one of his guards, began wandering about
the long, high-ceilinged room. Bookcases containing the bound laws
and penal records of the state lined one wall. Opposite were full
length pictures in oil of the state governors over a period of more
than a hundred years.</p>

<p>A long oak table with stiff chairs pressed against it occupied the
center of the room. Two tall heavily barred windows at one end of the
room gave the only outside light&mdash;showed now dark night sky above a
row of gloomy pines.</p>

<p>The impression the room gave was frigid, ominously bleak for those
condemned men who faced the Pardons Board here to argue for their
lives. But for the Phantom, as he moved around the gloomy room, the
place seemed to exude a sinister, premonitory warning.</p>

<p>The murderer of Kag, under the hospital, had disappeared as though
the walls had swallowed him. Yet that killer had left a clue, the
deft mark of a medical man. And Kag's last shrieking words had
irrevocably tied that unseen murder to the Imperator in a binding
union of identity that could never be broken.</p>

<p>But of the Imperator, the killer of Kag, there was still not the
slightest trace. Van had been so positive, for a moment, that Dr.
Maurice Jessup was the man, that the weird, grim mystery of the
Invisible Empire had seemed to solve itself in a single flash of
comprehension. And then there had been no visible second door out of
that one basement room. The obvious and narrow deduction that Jessup
had killed Kag had become a problematical, unproved chance again!</p>

<p>What, now, was going on in the warden's office, Van had no idea.
One of the guards was stationed near the door, barring him off from
any attempt to listen at the panel.</p>

<p>Had he been alone, the Phantom would have searched even this
austere room for a possible secret opening into that hidden
passageway which Van was positive existed, connecting the prison with
the subterranean operating room and the labyrinthian mine shafts
below. He had to content himself, under the hard, suspicious eyes of
the two guards, with spotting possible likely places where such an
exit might be concealed in the long room.</p>

<p>The door to the warden's office swung open abruptly, and Deputy
Rowan appeared, his eyes burning grimly at Killer Kline.</p>

<p>"Come on in," he rasped, and snapped at the two guards:</p>

<p>"You screws beat it."</p>

<p>Van watched him let the guards out into a corridor exit. Rowan
locked the door again, nodded at him. "Okay. Let's go!"</p>

<p>The Phantom entered the warden's room, and the Board Room door
locked behind him. He faced Black-Jack Bluebold who glowered at him
from across the heavy desk. Jessup and Arnold were standing to one
side, and Rowan joined them.</p>

<p>"Well, Killer Kline," Bluebold grated, "this is the end for
you!"</p>

<p>"Going to fry me tonight?" the Phantom asked harshly.</p>

<p>The four men nodded.</p>

<p>Van's eyes slid over the room&mdash;furniture, walls, ceiling, doors,
barred windows. There wasn't a chance to escape! And there was
neither pity nor patience in the four pair of grim, ruthless eyes
glaring at him. In the tight, watchful silence of the office, the
only human element of contact seemed to come from the faint, metallic
hum of the radio in the corner where it had been turned down but not
quite off.</p>

<p>"We've decided," Bluebold stated in a deadly voice, "that the
sentence imposed upon you by the trial judge in Pittsburgh will be
carried out one minute after midnight tonight! Thirty-five minutes
from now." He glanced at his watch. "Anything you've got to say,
Kline?"</p>

<p>Van stepped closer to the desk. "Lemme write a note," he said.
"You can read it."</p>

<p>"Stalling?" Bluebold asked sharply.</p>

<p>"It's about that hundred grand I'm leaving behind," Van said.</p>

<p>"We're not interested in that&mdash;" Bluebold started, but the
politician broke in on him with:</p>

<p>"Write the note, Kline! It's his privilege, warden. That hundred
thousand dollars belongs to somebody."</p>

<p>The Phantom glanced about him as he picked up a sheet of stiff
writing paper. Dr. Jessup was picking up the phone, starting to give
orders about his medical kit being taken up to the execution chamber.
Rowan was on another phone, giving directions to the guards who would
be on duty during the licensed killing.</p>

<p>Van's gaze flicked and his lips twitched.</p>

<p>"Getting nervous, eh?" Bluebold sneered.</p>

<p>"Not much." The Phantom put fear into his voice, and suddenly slid
the sharp edge of the paper across his thumb. "Hell! I guess I must
be getting jittery&mdash;"</p>

<p>Blood spurted from the deep cut, smeared the edge of the warden's
desk, made crimson blotches on his papers. Bluebold swore, jerked
open a drawer, slapped a first-aid kit on the desk top, pulled out a
roll of bandage.</p>

<p>Van held out his hand, thumb up, watching Bluebold keenly. As the
warden began wrapping the bandage around the cut, the Phantom jerked
his hand awkwardly, wincing.</p>

<p>Bluebold cursed and the bandage slipped off onto the desk.</p>

<p>"Here!" Arnold snapped. "Let me, warden. You're as nervous as he
is." He caught the bandage in his fingers, wrapped it securely,
twisting it around Van's wrist. "All right, Kline. You won't need to
wear it after your heart stops beating."</p>

<p>"Thanks," the Phantom said. His voice had a sudden steely ring.
"Before I put on this party, suppose you let me in on the surprise
you've got."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure, Kline." Bluebold glared at him. "Part of that little
surprise is something maybe you can help explain, Killer. You've got
some queer friends."</p>

<p>"Bring him in," Arnold advised. "Let's get it over with."</p>

<p>Bluebold punched a button on his desk. There was a brief pause.
Then a key grated in the lock of the corridor door. It swung open
with a bang.</p>

<p>Four burly prison guards crowded into the office, holding a fifth
man&mdash;Jerry Lannigan!</p>

<p>The Phantom's narrowed eyes smoldered and he fought for control
of his tensed, twitching muscles as he recognized the big, powerful,
red-headed Irishman.</p>

<p>Lannigan's face was raw from a beating, but his blue eyes blazed
defiance. He growled a curse at the screws holding him, and his gaze
settled on Killer Kline.</p>

<p>"Know this guy?" Bluebold roared at Van.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second, the Phantom hesitated, trying to
signal Jerry to silence. But Lannigan's jaw was already clamped
shut.</p>

<p>"Hello, Champ!" Van called to the burly fighter. "Thanks, pal, for
the try!" He turned swiftly to Bluebold and the others. "Sure I know
this bird. Champ O'Hara, from Frisco. He's an airplane pilot, and he
was going to make a pass at chiseling me out of this stir. What
tripped you, O'Hara?"</p>

<p>"Hiya, Killer," Jerry growled disgustedly. If he'd forgotten that
one or more of these men might have seen him twice before, he'd now
caught Van's cue, was putting on a swell act. "I cracked up my ship,
and was trying to swipe a new one."</p>

<p>A wry grin split his bloody face as he went on:</p>

<p>"Did I pick out a good one, or didn't I? Jeez, it turned out to be
a sort of kind of earthquake an' volcano! The damned thing blew up on
me, Killer! Blew all to hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van's slatey eyes flicked. Lannigan had found that mystery ship,
and demolished it!</p>

<p>"Tough going, Champ," he offered. "What was the trouble?"</p>

<p>"She was loaded with bombs, or something worse," Lannigan declared.
"I found some airplane tracks in a deserted field, and there
was this brand new crate hid in an underground hangar. It looked like
what I wanted, so I went after it. Some hoods tried to shoo me off
with gun slugs, but I had a rod and tossed some back at 'em. The ship
didn't get hit, but I guess some of the bombs they were loading did.
When I come to, Killer, the birdies was singing and I was asking for
Killer Kline."</p>

<p>"Looks like you found me," Van said, and noticed that a deathly
silence had fallen over the tensed office.</p>

<p>Black-Jack Bluebold was watching them both, catlike. Every eye in
the room was on them.</p>

<p>Van saw the guns appearing in the hands of the four guards. Rowan
and Jessup were edging toward him. Bluebold was getting to his feet
behind the desk, fingering a long, sharp paper knife with a steely,
ragged-edged blade.</p>

<p>Ex-Congressman Arnold's eyes were bleak as he moved away from the
Phantom and Lannigan, toward the wall, his voice calling across the
stilled room:</p>

<p>"Warden, this is your affair! I'd suggest you lock O'Hara up until
you're officially finished with Kline." He jerked his head
significantly at Lannigan. "Dr. Jessup, it looks like you've got a
nice big new human specimen."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Bluebold grated. "I'm running this pen! I'm frying Kline,
and his tough gorilla pal can be a witness. Then I'll tend to him!
Let's take 'em up, men!"</p>

<p>The broken silence of the office became a quick, restless stir.
Across the room Van saw Jerry's blue eyes begin to burn and his neck
muscles bulge. Bluebold was advancing, the knife held low,
poised.</p>

<p>"It won't be your thumb that's cut this time, Killer!" the warden
rasped. "I'm going to make your innards trail from here to the
electric chair!"</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes flicked at Lannigan again, and his face slid
sideways, his jaw hunched close to his shoulder, his lips parted in a
voiceless snarl.</p>

<p>And suddenly, from the corner of the office where the radio still
hummed in dull, mechanical monotony, a metallic, chilling flow of
words poured into the room:</p>

<p>"Attention, members of the Invisible Empire!</p>

<p>Alarm! Calling the Imperator! Gas has broken</p>

<p>into the officers' cavern! Warning! Calling</p>

<p>the Imperator! Danger of explosion!"</p>

<p>The lights in the warden's office blinked off abruptly. The voice
stopped. Instantly, the room became a pandemonium of shouts, curses,
bodies hurtling into each other, fists thudding, screams.</p>

<p>A steel door slammed across the room, crackling like a pistol shot
above the bedlam.</p>

<p>The Phantom hurled his lean body through the crowd, his hands
pawing aside the blindly fighting, panicked men in his path as he
leaped toward the sound of that door. His voice roared:</p>

<p>"Champ! Champ!"</p>

<p>Then his fingers clawed open the exit that had crashed shut, and
he darted through, found himself in the darkness of the long,
high-ceilinged Board Room.</p>

<p>Across in the blackness his narrowed eyes caught the vague
movement of one of the full-length oil pictures as it swung shut
against the wall.</p>

<p>As, he sprang toward it, he heard Jerry Lannigan's harsh breathing
behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN - HELL'S GOAL</h2>

<p>Van reached the picture he'd seen move in the darkness. He ripped
at its frame, swung it away from the wall. He pulled himself up into
the black opening behind the canvas, reached out and touched
Lannigan's groping arms.</p>

<p>"In here, quick!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Back of the big Irishman, across the length of the Board Room, the
guards and prison officers inside the warden's private quarters were
ham-mering at the steel door that Lannigan had slammed after him. The
Phantom pulled Jerry up into the narrow hole behind the oil painting,
swung the frame shut against the wall again.</p>

<p>"Here's a ladder," he muttered as his dangling legs knocked
against iron rungs. "Got a light?"</p>

<p>"That's all I got!" Jerry growled. Van was already climbing down
into the black well hidden in the Board Room wall. Above him,
Lannigan's electric torch sent down a wavering, eerie glow as Champ
followed him.</p>

<p>The hole seemed bottomless, but the Phantom didn't take time to
listen for the sounds of that fleeing figure who had preceded them.
Their own rapid descent made hollow, echoing thunder in the narrow
well as their feet struck each iron rung.</p>

<p>When Van's feet hit solid dirt, finally, all noise from above had
ceased.</p>

<p>Lannigan dropped down beside him, shifting the dim, fatigued gleam
of the flash.</p>

<p>"Gawd!" he exclaimed. "Those guys up there don't know about this
hole!"</p>

<p>"Lucky for us," Van said tersely. "A dozen shots pouring down
would have finished us. Come on, Champ. Through here!"</p>

<p>A low opening in one side of the well let them crawl on hands and
knees through a down-grade, twisting tunnel. Van reached back, took
the electric torch from Jerry, crawled on ahead rapidly. Behind him,
the beefy Irishman was having a tougher time getting his bulk around
the sharp curves.</p>

<p>Then the tunnel widened, dropped off abruptly into a chasm.</p>

<p>Van's flashlight beam petered out into darkness before the glow
touched bottom. He flung the beam across the empty space, centered it
on a plank on the other side.</p>

<p>"Smart lad," he muttered to Jerry "He pulled his bridge across
after him."</p>

<p>"Well, we can't sit here and catch him," the Champ growled.</p>

<p>Van measured the gap with a sharp eye. It couldn't be leaped
without at least a short run. And nobody could run out of that
hip-high tunnel through which they'd just squirmed their way.</p>

<p>"Might swing you over," Lannigan ventured.</p>

<p>The Phantom shook his head grimly and suddenly stretched out full
length, his feet against one side of the passage, his hands against
the other. By stretching out, he could make the long reach and brace
himself a little.</p>

<p>"You may have to stay here, Champ," he warned. "If I miss!"</p>

<p>Then, stretched horizontally, Van began inching his body out over
the chasm. Lumps of loose dirt slipped through his fingers, dribbled
silently into the fissure, making no sound against a bottom too deep
to send up even an echo.</p>

<p>Lannigan, watching him, began to sweat.</p>

<p>For a full half minute the Phantom was a straining human bridge
from wall to wall above that bottomless pit. Then he dropped to the
tunnel bottom on the other side. He took a deep breath, shoved the
plank across for the Irishman.</p>

<p>Lannigan crawled over to him, pulled the plank back.</p>

<p>They went on, standing upright now in a higher passageway. And as
they stumbled on, the Phantom began to recognize some of the
landmarks he'd spotted during his escape from the mines.</p>

<p>He led Jerry on, down grade, twisting, turning.</p>

<p>"Where'd that devil go?" Jerry panted as Van hesitated a moment at
a fork.</p>

<p>"He's headed for the water gate," the Phantom answered. "He thinks
gas has broken out somewhere down below." Van spotted the turn he
wanted, ran on again.</p>

<p>The gate to the elevator shaft Van was looking for almost broke as
they crashed into it, but the car was at their level. They leaped in,
started down.</p>

<p>"We'll split off from each other at the bottom," Van directed.
"You take the left tunnel, follow it straight through to the third
door, and turn right. You'll come out into the cavern where that
water door is fastened into the cement retaining wall. I'll probably
be there ahead of you."</p>

<p>"Suppose you're not," the Champ demanded.</p>

<p>"Then you'll run into this Imperator yourself, Jerry. I guess
you'll know what to do with him. Pull a Frank Buck on him,
Champ."</p>

<p>"I'll bring him back," Lannigan promised, "conscious, but in
pieces, if you say so, Skipper. How do I know him when I see
him."</p>

<p>The Phantom chuckled.</p>

<p>"You'll know him, all right. He'll be wearing a gas mask, and that
damned robed outfit. But he won't have a white mask. If there's more
than one, pick on the bird with the gas mask, Champ, and you can't go
wrong."</p>

<p>"Okay," Lannigan agreed. "But where're you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to beat you there."</p>

<p>The elevator car hit bottom, stopped. Van grabbed Lannigan's hand
in a firm grip. "Good luck, Irish. But if you hear water, run like
hell! Get out any way you can!"</p>

<p>The pressure left Jerry's hamlike palm, and the electric torch was
thrust into the Champ's fingers. Then the Phantom was gone, moving
swiftly through a wide, dark passageway straight ahead of the
elevator shaft.</p>

<p>He felt his way along, touching one side of the tunnel with his
hands, feeling the ground ahead for his unseen footing. He wasn't
positive, was relying upon his knowledge of mine tunneling, to locate
the shortcut that reason told him should be here.</p>

<p>If he didn't find it, he'd have to run back and try to catch up
with Jerry before the Irishman got to the cavern and the steel water
barrier. But he'd sent the Champ on that route for another reason&mdash;to
have a way cleared for a running escape. Lannigan, he knew, wouldn't
leave anyone behind who'd have an ounce of fight left.</p>

<p>Then, two hundred yards from the elevator shaft, the Phantom found
what he was hunting. It was a drop-off in a narrow shaft, leading at
right angles from the main passage.</p>

<p>He could tell by the type of bracing his hands encountered that
he'd guessed accurately. He was moving through an auxiliary shaft
that served as an emergency exit into the mine further on.</p>

<p>Van slid down the sharp incline of the drop, bumped his way along
uneven down-grade steps cut into the dirt, and emerged into a wider
passage that opened suddenly into the cavern he wanted.</p>

<p>Even in the blackness, he could discern the feeling of movement in
the air about him. Labored, harsh breathing guided him across a blank
space where his hands touched only heavy, moist air.</p>

<p>As he advanced, crouching, a thin shaft of bright light slid along
the further wall, caught and hung for a moment on a concrete
foundation, then slid on again to circle the round steel water
door.</p>

<p>The Phantom's pulse calmed now. He moved forward cautiously,
silently. The light ahead blinked out. There was a prolonged silence.
Then a dry creaking sound.</p>

<p>Van reached the concrete wall, flattened against it, edging closer
to the steel door. He could hear the quick, hard gasps of breath
again, each followed by another straining, louder creak of metal
against unoiled metal.</p>

<p>And suddenly the torch flashed on without warning, skidded over
the door, caught the Phantom full in the face.</p>

<p>Blinded by the unexpected ray, Van dove straight at the light. His
shoulder hit a shifting human body, and his hands closed in on the
familiar feel of a long robe.</p>

<p>Then the electric torch crashed down on his skull!</p>

<p>The Phantom twisted, half stunned and ducked a second blow as the
light shattered into intense blackness. He slugged upward, hammering
into a flat, hard stomach.</p>

<p>Then fingers gripped his throat, tightened.</p>

<p>With a wrenching lurch, Van threw himself sideward, tried to claw
off those throttling fingers. He could feel his own senses reeling.
The fingers, clawlike, closed down.</p>

<p>The Phantom relaxed abruptly, let his whole body go limp.</p>

<p>But the next moment, as the robed, writhing weight floundered down
on top of him, his knees doubled under him, his heels kicked out, hit
solid bone.</p>

<p>The crack of that blind kick was like the snap of a whip. He hung
onto the cloth in his fingers, was jerked forward onto his chest,
sprawled across the suddenly inert form beneath him. His fists
smashed into an unprotected jaw with crunching force. There was no
answering struggle.</p>

<p>But beneath him, now, was a trickle of water, and filling the
cavern was a suppressed but growing rumble.</p>

<p>Van lunged to his feet, grabbing the limp figure. He half dragged,
half carried it back toward the tunnel exit, shouting once more for
Lannigan.</p>

<p>An answering bellow drowned out for a moment the increasing roar
of the still dammed water.</p>

<p>"Skipper! Skipper!"</p>

<p>Then Jerry Lannigan's feeble torch gleamed in the darkness ahead,
the weak rays caught Van's struggling figure.</p>

<p>A moment more, and the Champ was at Van's side.</p>

<p>"Carry this fellow!" the Phantom gasped. "Run! The bulkhead is
breaking open!"</p>

<p>He grabbed the torch from Jerry, ran beside him. They reached the
first incline at the cavern's exit as the water lapped at their
heels. As they got into the tunnel, the dull growl back of them broke
into a violent, angry roar.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" Van shouted. "The bulkhead gave way!"</p>

<p>They had a fair start, for the narrowness of the tunnel acted as a
brake against the crowding water of the subterranean flood. And the
up-grade helped beat the churning wall of dank water that, lunged at
their heels.</p>

<p>But the flood was knee deep when they reached the elevator shaft,
and waist deep before the creaking cage dragged them up out of the
roaring, clutching current.</p>

<p>As the car climbed, Van jabbed the light downward through a crack
in the flooring. The beam reflected only churning, rising water.</p>

<p>"That," he said, standing up again and putting the beam on the
robed and hooded figure Lannigan was holding, "is the end of the
Invisible Empire, Champ. They're finally, flooded out."</p>

<p>He lifted the head of the man slung limply over Lannigan's
powerful shoulders, and jerked the gas mask off that pallid face.</p>

<p>"And this&mdash;" He shoved the light close to the no longer robust but
now sagging features.</p>

<p>Jerry Lannigan said, "Yeah, I guessed who he was already. Warden
Bluebold! It couldn't have been Jessup, the prison croaker, because I
slugged him, chasin' you into the Board Room." The Champ grinned
proudly at his own smartness, and turned his head to look.</p>

<p>A chuckle broke from the Phantom's bruised lips as Lannigan, his
blue eyes widening, stared into the face of ex-Congressman Harry
Arnold!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN - THE PHANTOM FADES</h2>

<p>Minutes later they were still in the mine, but the flood was
swirling unseen, deep in the shafts below them. Lannigan was shifting
Arnold's inert body on his shoulder when Van announced:</p>

<p>"Here's the passageway I've been looking for, Champ. I came up
here on another elevator, but there had to be some back way in,
because there was a locked door I couldn't get out of."</p>

<p>He stood facing a steel door set in concrete&mdash;the rear entrance to
the underground operating room&mdash;after they'd gone a few rods up a
sharp incline. An up-elevator opened several yards further on.</p>

<p>The Phantom examined the lock on the door, took keys from Harry
Arnold's pocket. One of the keys fitted, opened the door.</p>

<p>Van stepped swiftly across the threshold, got a light lit and
stared about the Imperator's operating room. Only one thing in it had
been changed since he'd escaped from there last:</p>

<p>The place of the dead, nude body of the F.B.I. operative, Marks,
on the operating table was empty now, but a live man occupied the
narrow hospital bed behind the screen.</p>

<p>As he crossed to that bed, the Phantom said over his shoulder,
"Champ, get some tape and do a job on Arnold, but leave his mouth
free." Then Van looked down at the new occupant of the room.</p>

<p>The man on the bed was stocky, dark-skinned, with dark, glittering
eyes that darted over the Phantom's face in startled, hopeful
recognition. His hands and feet were shackled to the bed, and his
mouth was taped, but he had not been touched yet with a knife.</p>

<p>The Phantom worked the tape off the fellow's lips, stood back,
waiting for the man to get his tongue moving again. A mumbled volley
of oaths spewed from the prisoner's throat, and his words became
rapidly intelligible.</p>

<p>"You're Killer Kline, ain't you!" he declared as soon as the
profanity wore out. "The toughest crook of us all, eh? What'd you do,
crack this stir?"</p>

<p>Van turned without speaking, set the screen aside so the fellow
could see Lannigan and the Imperator in the robe and black hood. The
man's eyes smoldered, then burst into darting flames of fresh
hate:</p>

<p>"Him! The dirty, sneakin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who're you?" Van barked.</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;you ain't forgot me, from the Pittsburgh jail! I'm Joe Sholtz.
God! That guy you got there, he was going to skin me alive, he told
me, so's he could use my hide on you, Killer! He was goin' to do a
face-liftin' job on you, use you for somethin' he was planning.
That's why I wasn't cooked in th' hot seat last night." Terror
suddenly pitched Sholtz' voice. "You ain't gonna let him skin me now,
are you, Killer?"</p>

<p>Van thought fast, sizing up the hard-looking con on the bed.</p>

<p>"I won't, if you'll talk," he snapped. "Maybe I can get you free
of the hot seat, get 'em to commute your sentence to life."</p>

<p>"I'll tell every damned thing I know!" Sholtz declared. "I've been
in this stir awhile. I seen some queer things."</p>

<p>"How'd you know it was Arnold who brought you here?" Van
asked.</p>

<p>Sholtz' glittering eyes darted to the ex-Congressman's taped body.
"The dirty rat! He was dressed up like the prison surgeon when he
took me down here, handcuffed. He didn't think I'd ever get out. He
took off the gauze he was wearin' over his face, after he'd chained
me to this damned bed, so he could talk better."</p>

<p>Van turned to Lannigan. "Champ, that elevator out there'll take
you up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It'll take you up into the prison hospital basement," Sholtz cut
in. "Lets you out through a fake dumbwaiter. But there's a halfway
landing up the elevator shaft that opens into a tunnel leading to a
rock quarry outside the prison walls. I was brought down from the
hospital, but you can skip th' stir that other way."</p>

<p>"Get that?" The Phantom nodded to Jerry, who'd finished with
Arnold's bindings. "Use that quarry exit, Champ. You'll find Havens
with the National Guards the governor sent up to Mountainview. Tell
them to take over the prison, and bring Havens, Bluebold, Jessup and
the militia commandant back here with you. Lock up Deputy Rowan and
his screws until we find out how much they're in on this."</p>

<p>Lannigan grinned, went out, and when Van had locked the door he
swung back to Sholtz.</p>

<p>"Who told you about that quarry tunnel?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The hood who was with Snakey Willow on that New York killing,"
Sholtz said grimly. "He came in here that way, an' Arnold jumped him
for using that entrance. I seen and heard the whole thing."</p>

<p>The Phantom's eyes flashed. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"The guy come in here and met Arnold," Sholtz growled. "And give
him a briefcase snatched from the fellow shot in New York&mdash;Grand
Central Station, he said, was the spot. Arnold raised hell because
the thing had been bungled, and stabbed the hood to death right here
in front of me. Gawd, it was bloody!"</p>

<p>Harry Arnold had opened his eyes and was staring at Killer Kline
with growing comprehension and fear. Van turned on him:</p>

<p>"Where's that briefcase now, Arnold?"</p>

<p>"To hell with you!" Arnold's voice was shrill, choppy with sudden
rage. "Find it, if you're so damned clever!"</p>

<p>"Know where that case went to, Sholtz?" Van demanded.</p>

<p>"I seen him hide it under the instrument cabinet," the con
answered, gloatingly. "There's a trick drawer below the bottom
shelf."</p>

<p>The Phantom had the briefcase a moment later, was opening it on the
operating table, examining its contents, staring keenly at Gimbel's
reports on Dr. Hugo Junes' aluminum-calbite fusion experiments.</p>

<p>He studied the reports briefly, then turned to Arnold, and his
voice was icy when he spoke.</p>

<p>"You intend to talk, Arnold? Or do you think you can hold
out?"</p>

<p>"You're not Killer Kline," Arnold snarled abruptly. "You'd be out
of here before now, if you were. I got nothing to say, to you or to
anybody else. What the hell can you prove, in court?"</p>

<p>"You're in court right now," Van told him tersely, and turned to
Sholtz. "Think you can make him talk, if I let you at him?"</p>

<p>"I'll peel him alive if he don't!" the murderer guaranteed, but he
eyed Van now with intent sharpness.</p>

<p>Arnold was trying not to show his mounting terror. He glared at
Van, stuck to his question:</p>

<p>"Sholtz couldn't make me talk. But&mdash;who are you?"</p>

<p>For a moment Van hesitated, advancing close to Arnold, And there
was something so terrifying in the steely grey eyes boring into the
Imperator's that Arnold winced, glanced away, trembling. Van's hand
reached down, jerked the ex-Congressman's jaw around so that he
couldn't avoid that impelling, piercing stare.</p>

<p>"I'm your judge!" Van said in words that seemed to chill the walls
of the concrete room. "I can do with you anything I choose! Arnold,
you are facing the Phantom!"</p>

<p>As the dread name filled the strange subterranean room, and the
full realization of the power of the man he was up against struck
Arnold's consciousness, he slumped back against the wall, seemed
suddenly to collapse within himself as a balloon collapses when it is
punctured.</p>

<p>Over on the bed, Sholtz began swearing, making low, animal noises,
while his eyes, bitter and defeated, stared at the Phantom with a
stunned expression of amazed bewilderment.</p>

<p>Harry Arnold's lips moved. His voice came out, dry, grating:</p>

<p>"I've heard&mdash;God! I'll talk!"</p>

<p>"I think," Van said flatly, "you're beating Bluebold to the punch.
I never met a bull-whip like him yet who wasn't yellow. How'd you
happen to pick on him as your right-hand man?"</p>

<p>Arnold's eyes glowered hopelessly. "I had to use him, because of
the prison and the men I could take from it. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arnold, the Imperator, kept on talking, while the Phantom checked
his weird, dominion&mdash;mad story with Dr. Junes' reports on the
operating table, with Sholtz's growled comments, and with his own
piecing together of the murderous crime pattern.</p>

<p>The ex-Congressman didn't shut up until, a full hour later, Van
unlocked the door and let in Lannigan. With the big Irishman were
Bluebold and Dr. Jessup, both handcuffed, Frank Havens, and Colonel
Leusik, the tall, sharp-featured National Guard commander.</p>

<p>"Colonel Leusik's men have command of the penitentiary now,"
Havens said, introducing the colonel and eyeing Van's make-up
curiously.</p>

<p>"Lannigan says you have caught the Imperator&mdash;" He looked at
Arnold and at Sholtz.</p>

<p>The Phantom nodded. "Take the cuffs off Dr. Jessup, if you will,
Colonel. I'll try to give you the incriminating facts quickly, since
I presume you'll want to turn over the evidence to the governor along
with the prisoners. You'll have little difficulty, I'm sure, getting
the signatures now of Arnold and Bluebold."</p>

<p>The warden's face whitened and he shot a frantic look toward
Arnold. "I'll sign no confession! I'm being railroaded!" He took a
menacing step nearer the ex-Congressman. "You&mdash;you talked?"</p>

<p>"He beat you there, Bluebold," Van cut in and shoved the big man
back against the wall. "You can recriminate after it's over."</p>

<p>Bluebold's jaw dropped as he glared at Van. "Arnold's a liar,
whatever he told you! He's behind all this. And you, Killer
Kline&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Killer Kline you're looking at," Lannigan said with a
growling laugh, "will have to do until the real Kline comes up from
Pittsburgh, Bluebold. You signed your death warrant when you signed
the commitment papers letting him into your stir!"</p>

<p>The Phantom stepped back to the table, picked up the reports
spread there, while the others watched him with mingled emotions.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, Bluebold," Van said, "Harry Arnold didn't
have to tell me a great deal, although Sholtz and I convinced him it
would be a healthy idea. But what he did tell me was startling&mdash;the
part I couldn't grasp at first:</p>

<p>"Arnold conceived this gigantic idea of the Invisible Empire,
gentlemen, not for money. He wanted power. He wanted to be another
Hitler, another Mussolini, in America!</p>

<p>"He couldn't do it by votes. He was washed up politically because
of a conviction against him in California for an illegal operation on
the face of an escaped San Quentin convict. He was known there, he
admits, as Dr. Harold Arrnster. His fingerprints and the American
Medical Society would have caught up with him if he'd tried to become
more than a congressman anywhere in public life.</p>

<p>"But he thought he could get control of the country without
votes&mdash;by terrorism, by destroying enough well chosen industries and
governmental projects, to throw the nation into a helpless,
undirected revolt.</p>

<p>"Then he planned to step into control, take over the armed forces
with his own trained lieutenants, and set up a new government with
himself as dictator."</p>

<p>The Phantom paused, shuffled the reports on the operating
table.</p>

<p>"It was the aluminum-calbite fusion experiments of Dr. Hugo Junes
at Niagara Falls that first gave me the trail that has ended here in
this room, gentlemen! Colonel Leusik, if you'll follow my deductions
you'll find the presentation of evidence against Arnold and his
assistant, Bluebold, not so complicated.</p>

<p>"I realized, when the Rock Canyon Dam was blown up, that a new
explosive had been discovered. For the Arizona dam, and some of the
other industrial projects that had been wrecked, had been built to
withstand T.N.T. Metallurgical chemistry is a rare enough field, so
that any new or outstanding development in it can be traced. Dr.
Junes was known to be experimenting with a new metal fusion.</p>

<p>"And then Gimble, carrying a report of Junes' work to Mr. Havens,
was shot to death and the reports stolen. I have them here, for they
were delivered to Arnold by the killer who escaped.</p>

<p>"Almost immediately, Dr. Junes' experiment blew up in his face.
But I'd already realized that, since in all endothermic compounds,
terrific heat is necessary to their formation, the sudden releasing
of those fused elements, by accident or design, must produce the same
amount of heat energy when the elements separate.</p>

<p>"That breakdown makes, rudimentarily, all endothermic explosions,
and is the basic rule for the manufacture of trinitrotoluene and the
amatol, picric acid and ammoniurn nitrate mixtures we use for
blasting and bombs.</p>

<p>"The fusion of aluminum and calbite would be an unstable union,
apt to disintegrate in an explosion, without the addition of some
stabilizing element. Dr. Junes was using a chip from a meteoric
fragment on exhibition at the Smithsonian Institute, so I was sure
there'd be an experimental tie-up with that ore.</p>

<p>"There was. The meteorite was a stable fusion of the two metals
Junes was trying to unite, But the fusion had happened on another
planet. The only way he could find out what the third ingredient was
that held them together was by melting them down. And he couldn't do
it. The hottest furnaces man had ever made wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>"I had most of this knowledge before meeting Junes. Of course, it
was obvious that somebody else was trying to find out what the
metallurgist had discovered, how far he'd gone in his fusion, and how
close he was to getting sufficient heat to finish his work.</p>

<p>"In fact, the Imperator had his own men working there in Junes'
laboratory. And his own metallurgist, the half crazy Vonderkag, was
doing things with aluminum and calbite down here underground&mdash;things
that Junes couldn't do. For Kag had the heat, a natural compressed
gas from a subterranean reservoir that would, and did, melt the
meteorite and give him the third vital element.</p>

<p>"In the course of Kag's experiments, the metal that Junes was
trying to make was perfected. Lannigan found it in discovering the
airplane Arnold had got built. But more important, for the
Imperator, was Kag's working out of an even higher powered explosive
in the disintegration of the new metal.</p>

<p>"It was that latest explosive compound that Arnold relied upon to
blast into being his plan for an Invisible Empire that would be no
longer invisible but actual and operative. It was the near discovery
of that explosive that stopped Junes from continuing his fusion
work. He was very close to it then, and saw the danger to the world
if such a chemical formula should be perfected."</p>

<p>Van paused again, put down the reports and notes he'd been
scanning while he talked.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you this in detail, Colonel," he explained, "because
this phase of the investigation won't come out in court. You'll have
evidence enough without using it, and it will be better that the
public doesn't know of Kag's too dangerous findings. Fortunately, Kag
is dead. And the stolen meteorite, along with Dr. Junes' chip from
it, have been lost forever in the flooded mine under us.</p>

<p>"And now for the record: It was an accident that Snakey Willow was
shot by a New York City detective when Gimble was killed. That was a
lead here to this prison&mdash;a lead, however, which wouldn't have broken
the case. All it would have proved was that one or two convicts had
escaped. For Dr. Jessup knew nothing of what was going on, and would
have been of no help. Arnold and Bluebold, naturally, would have, and
did, cover up nicely any attempt to pry too deeply into their
affairs.</p>

<p>"But it wasn't an accident that Arnold and Bluebold were in Frank
Havens' office the day Gimble was to have appeared. They were there
to see that he didn't get a chance to talk, if Willow and the other
gunman missed. And again, Dr. Jessup was brought along as a figure
who would help clear them of any suspicion, should there be a slip in
their calculations somewhere.</p>

<p>"The chronology of events, Colonel, you can get from Mr. Havens at
your leisure. I'm sure he'll help you organize the prosecution
against Arnold and Bluebold.</p>

<p>"It was the Imperator's desire to get somebody to replace the
erratic and untrustworthy Dr. Vonderkag, that led me here. I
submitted to a form of kidnaping, and met Kag. I knew about the
stolen meteorite, and was expecting it when it showed up in the
underground laboratory under the mines.</p>

<p>"That cinched the location of the Empire and its center as being
there. The rest of the job, from my angle, was to force the Imperator
into the open. But it wasn't until I tricked him into using me as a
murder volunteer that I found this room, and the thermometer with the
Alleghany Penitentiary stamp on it. Finding Marks, the Federal agent,
a prisoner here, furnished the surgical information needed.</p>

<p>"Thereafter, it was a process of thinning down the suspects up in the
prison to a doctor who had the other necessary qualifications to fit
the character such a role as the Imperator demanded.</p>

<p>"Death, at the hands of Arnold&mdash;although I didn't know who the
murderer was at that point&mdash;eliminated Vonderkag. It also very nearly
eliminated Dr. Jessup, for Jessup would have had to move faster than
I'd ever seen him move before, to get in and out of that hospital
basement laboratory to kill Kag. Jessup wasn't eliminated then, as a
suspect, but my attention turned more suspiciously to the others.</p>

<p>"That brought the choice down to Jessup, Bluebold, Arnold and
Rowan, with the emphasis on Bluebold and Arnold. So I cut my thumb
with a piece of stiff paper when Jessup and Rowan were occupied
phoning. Bluebold was clumsy when he tried to bandage my cut, but
Arnold did a very neat spica wrapping&mdash;a technique only a doctor or a
nurse would be apt to use.</p>

<p>"So I knew that Arnold had once been a medical man. The last move
was to force him into the open. I resorted to a bit of ventriloquism,
using the radio as a medium and the threat of escaped gas in the mine
as a motive for immediate action. The Imperator had to stop that
gas&mdash;actually, he flooded it out with water, which was the only
emergency measure he could take.</p>

<p>"I was ready when he got the lights out, and followed him, with
Lannigan. I'd already spotted the water door he'd have to open, down
in the mine, so I knew where to catch him. And because of the
supposed gas, he'd be wearing a gas mask, which precluded his
smelling that there wasn't any leak, and at the same time marked him
as the only man in that section of the mine who would not be wearing
an Empire face mask.</p>

<p>"There was no difficulty, then, in taking him and bringing him
here."</p>

<p>The Phantom smiled thinly, glanced at Bluebold.</p>

<p>The warden was muttering oaths, his eyes glaring at Arnold.</p>

<p>"Bluebold will, I think," Van said drily, "clear up any little
details I may have missed."</p>

<p>"By God," the warden exploded. "I heard you! Arnold's talked,
you've talked. Damn you, it's my turn now!"</p>

<p>With a slight shrug, Van went to the door, opened it, and stepped
out, closing the door upon the violent, cursing recriminations of
Black-Jack Bluebold, the Imperator's befuddled lieutenant. Nobody in
the room except Lannigan and Havens noticed Van's silent
departure.</p>

<p>He used the elevator, got off at the halfway stage, and entered
the tunnel, using his deft fingers on his made-up features as he
followed the shaft. Killer Kline was disappearing.</p>

<p>When he emerged into the rock quarry, he stood for a moment in the
freshness of night, breathing deeply, freeing himself of the
atmosphere of the mine.</p>

<p>But it wasn't as Killer Kline that he stared skyward at the silent
stars. Nor was it the Phantom who finally lowered his hands from a
smudged, rather handsome and weary face. For the Phantom was
fading...</p>

<p>Yet a memory that was growing in the strange annals of criminal
investigation&mdash;a nervous, restless figure in a mask who would, when
the vipers of crime bared their poisonous fangs again, stalk once
more the dread streets of darkness.</p>

<p>But for the moment, amongst all the teeming millions of the land,
there stood alone, here in the quarry, a tall, silent, nondescript
figure who was without name, without any tie.</p>

<p>Then that moment was gone. And the lithe form moved swiftly
through the shadows of rocks and trees, disappearing toward the
road&mdash;a road that led back again to the old life and to the Park
Avenue penthouse of Richard Curtis Van Loan.</p>

<p>Only a brief sigh that was like a faint, vagrant breeze through
the boughs above, signaled the Phantom's transition.</p>
