<h2>Chapter I. DEAD MAN AT THE DOOR</h2>

<p>"THERE'S a dead man just outside your door."</p>

<p>The voice was calm and controlled. Its tone might have indicated the owner
was accustomed to encountering dead men just outside of doors. Certainly the
man who spoke was not greatly perturbed.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was facing the man as he entered. Except for a quick stirring of
his flaky gold eyes, the bronze adventurer himself did not betray great
surprise. Yet, until the visitor had announced it, neither Doc Savage nor his
four companions then present had known of any presence in their corridor, dead
or otherwise.</p>

<p>That is, with the exception of the man who had made the announcement. And
this visitor had pressed the buzzer and been admitted in the usual manner.
Moreover, the visitor had been expected. He had telephoned half an hour
previously. His visit was for the purpose of consulting Doc Savage on the
investigation in which Doc and his four men were then engaged.</p>

<p>There was not a ripple on the smooth bronze skin of Doc Savage's face.
Looking at his visitor, he spoke first to the big, solemn-faced man behind
him.</p>

<p>"Renny, you will see what has happened," he said, quietly. "You will have a
look around and bring the body in."</p>

<p>Colonel John Renwick, known as "Renny," an engineer of worldwide repute,
moved his great bulk toward the outer door. Renny was a giant in breadth and
stature. His rugged features were always solemn, almost melancholy. But that
was deceptive.</p>

<p>Doc spoke next to the other big man beside him. This man was of ungainly,
squat appearance. His small eyes twinkled under the shaggiest of jutting brows.
His long arms trailed his hands below his knees.</p>

<p>"Monk," directed Doc, "you will have a look around outside on the stairs.
Perhaps it would be well to drop down a few floors by elevator, then come up
carefully."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Blodgett Mayfair, known as "Monk," the widely
famed chemist of Doc's group, grunted in a childish treble. He scuttled in the
direction of the elevators.</p>

<p>Doc thus had started the quickest possible means of finding out what a dead
man outside his door might mean. Then he addressed his visitor.</p>

<p>"Your reception has been somewhat unpleasant," said the bronze man. "You
have excellent nerve. I take it you are Professor Callus, the
oceanographer?"</p>

<p>The man bowed and agreed. "I am Professor Callus. I have been in touch with
a friend in the Geodetic Survey. He mentioned you were seeking to trace the
origin of the prevailing subsea disturbance."</p>

<p>"We have been working on that," stated Doc Savage. "I admit we probably have
little more information than yourself, if we have as much. What we know thus
far we will gladly pass along."</p>

<p>Professor Callus wagged his head again. His skull had the peculiar
appearance of a shining globe. It was partly bald, and apparently too large for
his scrawny neck and skinny body.</p>

<p>"Seeing the man outside the door was somewhat of a shock," he said, slowly.
"It was more so because I recognized him."</p>

<p>The voice of Professor Callus was still so calm that another of Doc's
companions emitted an exclamation.</p>

<p>"That's nerve!" he said to the man beside him. "He walks onto a dead man! He
knows him! And he doesn't turn a hair!"</p>

<p>The speaker was a slender, well-dressed fellow. He had the sharp nose and
the keen eyes of an analyst. Which he was. For the speaker was Brigadier
General Theodore Marley Brooks, otherwise known as "Ham," the legal luminary of
Doc Savage's group. Ham carried a sword cane, the tip of which was covered with
a chemical that, injected in the skin, would produce instant
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Professor Callus apparently did not catch Ham's remark.</p>

<p>"The dead man is a colleague, after a manner of speaking," he volunteered.
"He is--or was--Professor Homus Jasson, and he also has been a deep student of
oceanography. I imagine he must have been on somewhat the same mission as
myself."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THEY were now in Doc Savage's great library. This room, with other offices
and perhaps the world's most completely equipped laboratory were on the
eighty-sixth floor of lower Manhattan's most impressive skyscraper.</p>

<p>At the time Professor Callus had entered, Doc and his companions were
intensively engaged with a wide variety of instruments. Every known device for
indicating weather conditions was in service.</p>

<p>For in the past few days, strange disturbances had been reported by the
government Coast and Geodetic Survey. Delicate instruments had been disturbed
to the extent of being put out of business.</p>

<p>The inexplicable emanation appeared to come from the depths of the sea.
Tonight Doc Savage was attempting to not only trace the disturbance, but to
isolate the position of its origin.</p>

<p>Thus far, the man of bronze had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Until the moment of the arrival of Professor Callus, the phenomenon had been
accepted as probably some natural, perhaps some undersea volcanic,
disturbance.</p>

<p>But now there was a dead man outside the door. And Professor Callus had said
he was an oceanographer like himself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE matter of the identification brought no comment from Doc Savage. Renny
was coming in. He was bearing a body of slight form and weight in his huge
arms.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny, placing the body on a couch near the library
table. "Feels like he might have been out there some time! The body's already
stiff, Doc. And it looks to me like we missed something by him not getting in
here alive!"</p>

<p>Doc's bronzed hands were already busy. He was removing a variety of lethal
instruments from the pockets of the dead man's loose-fitting, shabby suit.</p>

<p>"Great guns!" exploded Ham. "He seems to have been a man going places for
purposes of much violence! Are those things bombs, Doc?"</p>

<p>Ham indicated two round, black objects equipped with timing triggers.</p>

<p>"They are bombs," stated Doc, calmly. "And from their compact form, I
imagine they contain enough high explosive to have wrecked this whole
floor."</p>

<p>"This is indeed most peculiar," commented Professor Callus. "I've always
known Professor Jasson as a very mild sort of man. Yet that must be an
automatic pistol. And is that other instrument a weapon?"</p>

<p>Doc had removed a loaded automatic of large calibre. He was examining the
other device. It had the appearance of an oversize water pistol such as might
have been used by a child. But Doc put it carefully aside.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, this is a gun for spreading poison gas," he said,
quietly. "And be careful, Long Tom. Don't touch that for a moment."</p>

<p>The bronze man had taken a flat, ebony box from the dead man's inner pocket.
It was a large box to have been thus carried. A clasp appeared to open by the
touching of a spring. "Long Tom" had been about to unsnap the clasp.</p>

<p>Long Tom, or Major Thomas J. Roberts, one of the world's best-known
electricians, had been helping operate some of the radio instruments.</p>

<p>Doc picked up the flat box.</p>

<p>"I believe this should have special attention," he advised. "Of all this
collection of death-dealing devices, I suspect this is the most deadly."</p>

<p>Doc filled a shallow glass receptacle with a clear liquid. This was only
pure alcohol. Doc's sleeves were stripped from his forearms. Tendons of
cable-like strength played under his smooth bronze skin.</p>

<p>Immersing the flat ebony case, his thumb flicked the spring of the hasp. The
case divided. Its opening was accompanied by a sibilant, sinister hissing.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" ejaculated big Renny. "It's a snake--one of them cobras!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE darting, writhing splash of color springing from the flat, ebony case
was less than a foot in length. But its head and neck expanded enormously.</p>

<p>"It is the most poisonous of all the cobra species," stated Doc. "It's a
hamadryad, which does not reach great size."</p>

<p>The effect of the alcohol was almost instant. The death-dealing hamadryad
hissed only once. It struck at the bronze hand which had released it. But Doc's
movement had been quicker than the cobra's dart.</p>

<p>Professor Callus gasped a little. It had seemed as if the snake must have
buried its fangs in the bronzed skin.</p>

<p>But the cobra stretched its length and fell back. Then it stretched inertly.
The alcohol had overpowered it.</p>

<p>Professor Callus blinked a little and his big head bobbed up and down.</p>

<p>"Professor Jasson must have been overtaken by some form of killing
dementia," he commented. "Yet why would he be coming to your headquarters, Mr.
Savage?"</p>

<p>Doc Savage, as was his habit when some great idea was beginning to take
shape in his marvelous brain, said nothing. He moved back beside the corpse on
the couch in the library.</p>

<p>The arms of the dead man were sticking out stiffly. His legs were rigid. The
face was a cold, blood-drained mask. The eyes were open and staring.</p>

<p>"Must have been dead some time, the way he felt," said Renny.</p>

<p>Professor Callus was looking at Doc, but he did not see his lips move. But
Doc's companions knew their bronze leader was on the eve of some important
discovery.</p>

<p>"Yes, rigor mortis seems to have set in," said Doc, quietly. "It would mean
this Professor Jasson was dead some hours ago. But the man died within the past
half hour."</p>

<p>"Why, that would seem impossible!" said Professor Callus. "I thought rigor
mortis would not take place for from two to five hours?"</p>

<p>"This man has been killed instantly by a poisonous injection," stated Doc.
"And rigor mortis was artificially induced to make it appear he had been dead
for some time. He must have been at the door only a short time; perhaps a few
minutes."</p>

<h2>Chapter II. WOMAN OF VIOLENCE</h2>

<p>WHILE Doc Savage was examining the dead man and finding him so thoroughly
equipped for violence, the ungainly Monk was encountering another form of
violence. But this was very much alive. It was in the form of a slender
girl.</p>

<p>The girl's face would have been beautiful, under normal conditions. But when
the young woman encountered the terrifying figure of Monk before her on the
stairway, her countenance was a strained, desperate mask.</p>

<p>The girl was red-headed. The hair was naturally and vividly red. Her
deep-brown eyes were sparkling with menace. Undoubtedly she was scared, but
being red-headed, she intended doing something about it.</p>

<p>Monk had been unusually quiet about ascending the stairs. No person had
recently descended by elevator. The arrival of Professor Callus had apparently
been the only movement of a passenger to the eighty-sixth floor.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl must have seen Monk first. The apelike figure of the
chemist moved around an upward turn in the stairs. The Cold steel of an
automatic's snout jammed right into his hairy throat.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" said a low, tense voice. "You're him, and I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>Monk did not know who he was supposed to be. But it seemed plainly evident
the girl would shoot. The automatic's snout quivered against Monk's tough
hide.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" he squealed in his childlike voice. "Where'd you come
from? You musta killed that guy upstairs!"</p>

<p>"I said, don't move!" repeated the girl. "So you know about the murder? You
were trying to get away, and you heard Barton! Barton! Come on up here!"</p>

<p>The young man called Barton must have been a floor or two below where Monk
had started to ascend the stairs. His feet pounded quickly upward. He was a
thick-browed, black-haired young fellow. When he saw the position of the young
woman, his face became very pale.</p>

<p>"Lora!" exclaimed the young man. "Who is he? Wait! Give me the gun!"</p>

<p>The red-headed girl shook her head determinedly.</p>

<p>"You walk behind me, Barton," she directed. "Here, take this. If he makes a
break, you'll have to shoot!"</p>

<p>Monk's small eyes bulged. The red-headed girl produced another automatic
pistol. She pushed it into the young man's hands.</p>

<p>"But lady, dag-gone it!" yelped Monk. "Whatcha think you're doin'? What's
the--"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped the red-headed girl, emphatically. "Now you just march
ahead of us up these stairs! Barton, be sure about the safety catch! Perhaps
Mr. Savage will like to see this hoodlum!"</p>

<p>There was a metallic click. Monk knew the sound of a safety catch on an
automatic when he heard it. The weapon had been shifted around to the back of
his neck. It was no more reassuring there than it had been against his
throat.</p>

<p>Monk's short legs jerked. Step by step, he mounted toward the eighty-sixth
floor. At the first corridor above, which happened to be the eighty-fourth, the
red-headed girl said, "Wait a minute!"</p>

<p>The automatic continued to bore into his neck. The girl said, "Barton, put
this in your pocket!"</p>

<p>The object, Monk saw, was a hypodermic syringe. Monk's quick-working
olfactory sense detected an odor. He could detect any known chemical almost
instantly by smell. His awkward body shivered.</p>

<p>For he had caught what might have been the odor of burned almonds. That hypo
must contain hydrocyanic acid.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE door of Doc Savage's headquarters was of plain metal. No lock or knob
appeared in view. It might have been only an indentation in the wall. The
red-headed girl halted, still prodding Monk's neck.</p>

<p>"Barton!" she said. "There must be a buzzer button--"</p>

<p>She ceased speaking. The door was silently opening. At some other time, Monk
would have enjoyed this immensely. The electroscope mechanism in the door had
been operated by radio control.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl breathed quickly, but recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Go on in!" she directed. "All right, Barton! You can put away your gun! I
can handle him!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage was standing in the door of the library. Neither his features nor
his eyes expressed any surprise. But behind him loomed the sharp features of
Ham, the lawyer. Ham let out a delighted yell.</p>

<p>"Now isn't that somethin'!" he said, sarcastically. "Lady, where did you
catch it?"</p>

<p>"Doc!" Squawked Monk. "Willya tell this redhead to take that gun outta my
neck! She's likely to pull the trigger!"</p>

<p>"Lady," drawled Ham, maliciously, "go on and pull it. You'll be doing the
world a great service. I've always said some one would get the ape, if he was
permitted to run loose much longer."</p>

<p>"Dag-gone you, Ham!" howled Monk. "You quit runnin' off at the mouth!"</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed big Renny. "An' Monk brought her up, he says!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE red-headed girl seemed to have a disposition like flash powder. The
various remarks clearly had her puzzled. Also they struck an angry spark.</p>

<p>"What's so funny about all of this?" she demanded. "You're Mr. Savage?"--she
addressed Doc. "Well, I ran onto this ugly baboon sneaking around on the
stairway. I was coming up to see you and--"</p>

<p>"Don't believe anything the redhead tells you!" interrupted Monk. "I caught
her and this other pasty-faced animal trying to get away, Doc! She's carryin'
two guns an' she's got a hypo loaded with enough poison to kill a hundred men!
She gave it to this guy with her!"</p>

<p>The young woman slowly removed the automatic from Monk's neck.</p>

<p>"Then he is one of your men, Mr. Savage?" she said with disbelief. "I guess
I'll have to say I'm sorry; I made a mistake. I've heard about the one called
Monk, but I didn't think any human being could look like that."</p>

<p>This elicited another howl from Ham.</p>

<p>"Neither did any one else," grinned the lawyer. "You've got good judgment,
lady, even if he can't help it."</p>

<p>"Listen, you danged shyster!" squealed Monk. "I'll make you eat them words,
or they'll pack you outta here in pieces!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage disregarded the apparent deadly hate of the chemist and the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"There seems to have been some misunderstanding," stated the man of bronze.
"Undoubtedly you can explain your presence here? What is this about a hypo
filled with poison?"</p>

<p>The red-headed young woman looked from one to the other of the men.
Professor Callus was observing her closely.</p>

<p>"A hypo of poison?" he said. "Then perhaps my colleague has not been dead as
long as it appears, or--"</p>

<p>"If you mean the man who was lying out in the corridor," interrupted the
young woman, "I know nothing about that. I was coming to see Mr. Savage, with
my brother. But when we saw the man--the dead man--we thought perhaps it would
not be a good time to enter. We have a hypodermic. I found it stuck into the
wall of the stairway between this floor and the one next below." Doc did not
say whether he believed or disbelieved the young woman.</p>

<p>"You had some definite purpose in coming to me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes!" exclaimed the red-headed girl. "You see Mr. Savage, I am
Lora Krants. This is my brother, Barton. We were informed you were seeking the
cause of some unusual oceanic upheaval."</p>

<p>"That is correct," stated Doc Savage.</p>

<p>Behind him, Ham murmured to Renny, "And I thought this thing was somewhat of
a government secret."</p>

<p>"Then you are the daughter of Cyrus Krants," said Doc, instantly. "We are
indebted to your father for many discoveries of importance. His new form of
bathosphere has penetrated to unusual depths of the ocean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad you do know about him!" said the girl. "We have been told you
are informed on nearly all subjects. So perhaps you can give us some
information that will help."</p>

<p>The young woman had spoken the truth. There were few subjects on which Doc
Savage was not fully informed.</p>

<p>"If you will tell me in what way I can be of assistance," Doc suggested.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl spoke more softly and with deep feeling.</p>

<p>"It's about my father," she said. "He has been missing now for more than a
week. The last word we had was a radio message from his yacht in the vicinity
of the lower Florida Keys."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Doc. "We will go into that in just a moment, Miss Krants. Long
Tom, you and Renny had better continue checking at once on the radio short
waves. If you can fix the latitude and longitude of the broadcasting blind
spot, I'm sure we will be getting close to something."</p>

<p>Doc then spoke again to the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>"And if you'll permit Monk here to examine that hypodermic, we then may know
the character of the poison which probably has been employed for murder."</p>

<p>"You'll have to trust the big ape," suggested Ham, dryly. "He is good for
one thing, Miss Krants, and that's why we keep him around."</p>

<p>Monk glared speechlessly. Now that her first fear and her anger had
subsided, Lora Krants was undeniably a very pretty young woman. Monk was
extremely susceptible.</p>

<p>"That is strange about your father," said Professor Callus. "I am quite well
acquainted with him, Miss Krants. But I never had the pleasure of meeting his
daughter, or his son."</p>

<p>"Tell us more about this radio message," suggested Doc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"THERE isn't much more to tell," said Lora Krants. "More than a week ago, we
had a radio message. It seems the boat engines were disabled then for no reason
the engineer could discover. And another message said that while the trouble
was being traced, the motors suddenly resumed functioning."</p>

<p>"And you have not heard from the yacht since then?" questioned Doc. "No
radio or other messages?"</p>

<p>"None, Mr. Savage. The yacht seems to have vanished. We have wired all
possible ports."</p>

<p>"I imagine he may be all right," said the man of bronze. "How did you know
of the work we are doing?"</p>

<p>"I have a friend employed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey," said the
red-headed girl.</p>

<p>Monk appeared in the door of the laboratory.</p>

<p>"It's hydrocyanic, and plenty of it!" he said. "And the needle has traces of
human blood. It has been used recently."</p>

<p>Doc Savage's short, trilling note suddenly startled the girl and her
brother. Barton Krants had taken no part in the conversation. His dark eyes had
glowered at every one.</p>

<p>The young man seemed to have a suspicion his sister might not get fair
treatment. Only when he looked at Doc Savage was there any hint of friendliness
in his features. And his face remained too white and pasty to be natural.</p>

<p>Professor Callus apparently had taken a deep interest in the young woman. He
moved to her side and engaged her in conversation.</p>

<p>Long Tom came to the door of the library.</p>

<p>"Doc, I believe we've got it," he announced. "We've eliminated everything
but the blind spot in the short wave radio contacts. It fixes an approximate
latitude and longitude."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter III. THE ABDUCTED COMMISSION</h2>

<p>"COME into the laboratory," invited Doc Savage. "You will be interested in
what we may have discovered."</p>

<p>It had been odd that Doc had made little further comment on the manner of
Professor Jasson's death. Nor had he as yet informed the police. The body had
been covered in the library.</p>

<p>Miss Krants and her brother joined Professor Callus in the laboratory. The
professor's eyes gleamed with appreciative interest.</p>

<p>"This is a treat," he said. "I've heard much of your equipment, Mr.
Savage."</p>

<p>Doc Savage produced several sets of earphones.</p>

<p>"If you will listen," he said, "you will hear that which has upset the
officials of the Coast Survey. Were it more pronounced, it might be mistaken
for the ordinary rumble of some undersea earthquake. But the seismograph has
not responded."</p>

<p>Doc explained, after they had listened to that faint murmuring. It was a
sound distinctly of the sea. It might have been that peculiar roaring effect
produced when a conch shell is held over one ear.</p>

<p>The instruments showed there had been no unusual weather anywhere. The
atmospheric conditions remained normal practically all over the world.</p>

<p>"But something has been happening," said Long Tom, the electrical wizard.
"Our own radio waves encounter a blind spot at intervals."</p>

<p>"And it seems to come from the depths of the ocean itself," explained Doc
Savage. "It is unlike anything the Coast Survey has ever previously
encountered. I have been unable to trace it to any manifestation of
nature."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THEIR conversation was interrupted by the sharp buzzing of the telephone.
Doc took the call in the presence of the others. The voice came over long
distance.</p>

<p>"This is the President of the United States speaking," came to Doc. "It is
important that you come to Washington at once, for a confidential
communication."</p>

<p>"I understand," stated Doc. "What have you heard from the commission?"</p>

<p>There was a few seconds' hesitation. Then the president spoke again.</p>

<p>"That is part of it," he said, gravely. "The commission has not reached
Calais. The steamship Trafalgar Square has not been reported for more than
twelve hours. The other part of it is too fantastic for belief."</p>

<p>"I shall communicate with you when I arrive," was Doc's quiet reply. "The
news you give confirms a thought that may be of some importance."</p>

<p>His thought was indeed of the most serious importance. Mention of the
commission was mingled with a growing conviction on the part of the bronze
adventurer. The dead man outside his door had pointed directly to something
new, some human agency connected with all this strange business of the haunted
ocean.</p>

<p>The armament of this dead man, Professor Jasson, was indisputable evidence
that Doc Savage's present work was unwanted by some one. It seemed clear enough
that a reputedly mild little professor had arrived at Doc's headquarters for
the purpose of killing, if necessary, and most certainly with the idea of
destroying the bronze man's extensive equipment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE report of the disappearance of a commission on its way to Calais was of
the greatest significance. Doc Savage was among the very few persons who knew
of the commission. It might have been correctly called a "war commission."</p>

<p>But its real mission was to end war. That is, the greater nations of the
world had decided on the most powerful of all treaties.</p>

<p>This was to be a pact that would include not disarmament of any nation, but
the immediate super-armament of the six member nations against all others. Six
governments had decided the time had come for them to take a stand for peace
against the world.</p>

<p>In brief, they were planning such powerful navies, air fleets and armies as
to make a war threat from others impossible. The six great nations had decided
to become world police.</p>

<p>Doc Savage had much more than a general interest in this war commission to
end war. William Harper Littlejohn, better known as "Johnny," the archaeologist
and geologist of Doc's group, was one of the commission.</p>

<p>The six war commissioners had been in London. They were preparing to meet
with representatives of other nations at Washington within a short period. The
commission had boarded the steamer Trafalgar Square for the crossing of the
English Channel from Dover to Calais. That crossing should have required only a
few short hours.</p>

<p>Now there had been no radio report of the Trafalgar Square for more than
twelve hours. There had been no SOS alarm. The weather had been of the calmest
for that usually stormy channel.</p>

<p>Yet the Trafalgar Square, one of the newest and safest of Channel vessels,
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Doc checked over in his mind the members of the commission.</p>

<p>Johnny, for the present at least, was representing the United States. The
others were Sir Arthur Westcott, Great Britain; Baron Calosa, Italy; Monsieur
Lamont, France; Herr Schumann, Germany, and Se&ntilde;or Torron, Spain.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE confronted the others. He spoke first to Professor Callus and
Miss Krants.</p>

<p>"We have been honored by your interest," he announced. "You are at liberty
to remain while Renny and Long Tom make further observations."</p>

<p>Then he issued quick directions.</p>

<p>"Renny, you and Long Tom will confirm as closely as possible the locale you
already have fixed. Monk and Ham will accompany me. We will be gone for only a
few hours."</p>

<p>Drawing Renny to one side in the library, Doc added instructions unheard by
the others.</p>

<p>"For the present, you will not notify the police of the dead man," Doc
advised. "But the circumstances are such, it might be advisable to be sure that
Miss Krants is safely escorted to her home. Also, it is possible you will have
other visitors who will be interested in what you are doing. Treat them with
every courtesy."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" muttered Renny. "And all this was confidential stuff between us
and the Coast Survey! There's a screw loose somewhere, Doc!"</p>

<p>"There may be several, but that will develop," was all the man of bronze
explained.</p>

<p>Acting on Doc's instructions, Ham and Monk were fully armed when they left
the skyscraper headquarters. Which might have seemed unusual for what could
hardly be other than a fast airplane trip to the national capital.</p>

<p>In Doc's special armored sedan, the three sped rapidly toward what to most
persons appeared to be only a little-used warehouse on the Hudson River. This
bore the simple sign:</p>

<p>HIDALGO TRADING COMPANY</p>

<p>The warehouse was a set of hangars housing the world's most modern and
remarkable planes, dirigible and submarine.</p>

<p>At headquarters, Renny and Long Tom continued their checking of the
instruments.</p>

<p>"The blind spot," announced Long Tom, "is somewhere in the vicinity of
Norway, in the North Sea."</p>

<p>"Remarkable!" commented Professor Callus.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter IV. THE MYSTERY GROWS</h2>

<p>"I'VE lost Doc!" exclaimed Renny, suddenly. "Now what's gone haywire with
that radio?"</p>

<p>Long Tom, Professor Callus, Lora Krants and her brother pushed forward with
eager interest. Doc's plane was already somewhere south of Baltimore, following
the coast line. Renny had been keeping in touch with them by short wave.</p>

<p>Doc had replied only briefly to Renny's inquiries. Renny had started to
report an apparent change in the locale of the ocean disturbance. Then the
radio speaker had squealed and squawked. After sporadic bursts, it functioned
imperfectly.</p>

<p>"Funny!" ejaculated Long Tom. "Have a look at the light recorders!"</p>

<p>The needles in circles at the ends of long steel cylinders were oscillating
rapidly. These were recording the refraction and gyration of light atoms over a
wide area of the ocean. Despite the absence of the sun, light appeared to be
increasing over a considerable section.</p>

<p>"Doc!" boomed Renny into the broadcasting mike. "Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Um-bum-bum-bul-um!" hummed the speaker.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Doc had heard Renny. But likely his reception of the engineer's
voice had been similarly jumbled.</p>

<p>The light recorder showed rising luminance somewhere much closer than the
hitherto located blind spot somewhere in the North Sea.</p>

<p>"Do you think something might be happening to Mr. Savage's plane?" said
Professor Callus.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" exclaimed the red-headed girl, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry about," said Long Tom. "This ocean haunt hasn't been
serious in any way."</p>

<p>Lora Krants's expression showed she doubted his words.</p>

<p>The corridor buzzer whined. It was less strident than usual. Long Tom, with
his keen electrician's sense, noted this. When he applied the radio contact to
work the electroscopic locks of the doors, it responded more slowly than it
should.</p>

<p>It was as if the available electrical current had been lessened.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE little man who came in bowed obsequiously. His flashing white teeth
smiled at every one. His skin was of the yellow darkness of an Oriental. But
his clothes were elegantly correct. His English was faultless.</p>

<p>"I do not need to confirm the information that this is the establishment of
Clark Savage," he said. "I am Kama Dbhana. It would be much simpler to call me
Kama, which is the family name."</p>

<p>"Sure!" grunted Renny, who was worrying about Doc. "Mr. Kama is all right
with us! What can we do for you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Savage, he is not now present?" said Mr. Kama.</p>

<p>He glanced with sparkling black eyes at Professor Callus. He had a passing
gleam of appreciation for the pretty Lora Krants.</p>

<p>Renny explained that Doc was absent. He introduced the others briefly.</p>

<p>"You haven't said, Mr. Kama, what we can do for you?" Renny then said.</p>

<p>Kama's darting eyes lingered on the variety of instruments.</p>

<p>"I have been informed," he said, "that Mr. Savage is tracing atmospheric
phenomena apparently of marine origin. I hoped he might be able to divulge
something of its source."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" thundered Renny. "You, too! And I suppose you have a friend in
the Coast Survey, Mr. Kama?"</p>

<p>Mr. Kama, merely bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>The buzzer whined again. It was even fainter than when Mr. Kama had
entered.</p>

<p>The man who entered was big and blond. He was a hearty, jolly fellow. His
words rolled with Scandinavian slowness of speech.</p>

<p>"I am Hjalmar Landson," he announced. "My countryman, one of the consular
staff of Norway, asked of me that I should have some conversation with Mr.
Savage."</p>

<p>"Say!" rapped out Renny. "Have you got a friend on the Coast Survey who
called you up and told you about it?"</p>

<p>Hjalmar Landson's mild, blue eyes went rather blank.</p>

<p>"I have no friend in what you call this Coast Survey," he said, slowly. "No,
it is not that. My countryman, he informed me--"</p>

<p>"You haven't met Mr. Kama, or Professor Callus, or Miss Krants?" Renny
asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen this Mr. Kama," said Hjalmar Landson, unexpectedly. "But it
does not matter. The others I have not had the pleasure--"</p>

<p>Renny introduced him. Then he made another effort to contact Doc's plane.
All he got was a louder squawling than before. Other instruments were beginning
to oscillate. But those recording the weather showed no atmospheric
changes.</p>

<p>Professor Callus seemed to take Mr. Kama under his wing. Now he was
explaining also to Mr. Landson the purposes of the variety of gadgets.</p>

<p>Renny heard Mr. Kama say he came from San Tao. The engineer had heard of San
Tao while he had been supervising a great tunnel in western China. He recalled
San Tao was an isolated, little known, but immensely wealthy, mountain province
of southern China.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE telephone buzzed. Long Tom took the call. He looked up with quick
suspicion.</p>

<p>"It's for you, Miss Krants," he said. "So others know you came here?" The
red-headed girl smiled calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "I was hoping perhaps a cable might come from my father! I
left word with the telegraph company!"</p>

<p>A few seconds later, she replaced the telephone.</p>

<p>"There's been a steamer report of father's yacht," she said. "I must go at
once to pick up the message. If I leave a telephone number and anything
happens, would you call me?"</p>

<p>Though the instruments were in increasing confusion, Renny put on his
coat.</p>

<p>"I shall go with you," he announced. "You can give me the telephone number
later."</p>

<p>"Why--" began Lora Krants. "You are so busy here--I had thought that--"</p>

<p>"I could very well escort Miss Krants to her home," offered Professor
Callus. "There seems nothing more to be learned just now. I have my car."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Renny. "But I think I had better take her home."</p>

<p>The engineer was following Doc's instructions to see Miss Krants safely
home. Also, the big engineer, who wasn't usually susceptible, liked this snappy
red-headed girl very much.</p>

<p>"Very well," bowed Professor Callus. "I shall be leaving soon, anyway."</p>

<p>"I should like very much to have the honor of remaining," said Kama, "but I
have other urgent matters to which I must attend."</p>

<p>"Me, too," grunted Hjalmar Landson.</p>

<p>The very blond Norwegian and the very dark Oriental followed Renny, the girl
and her brother closely, as they got to the lower floor.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ONE of Doc's armored roadsters provided ample space for Renny, Miss Krants
and her brother. The thick-browed brother did not talk. The red-headed girl
chattered her hope the message at the telegraph office might mean
something.</p>

<p>Renny's hands looked big and clumsy on the steering wheel. But the girl
gasped at the speed with which the car flicked past the steel pillars of the
elevated tracks. The telegraph office from which the notification to the girl
had come was about ten blocks from Doc's headquarters.</p>

<p>In the fourth block, Renny shaved a steel pillar. He swung at high speed
around a street car on the wrong side. His eyes were fixed on the rear-view
mirror.</p>

<p>At the next corner, Renny twisted suddenly into a wider street and drove
fast through a block. He rounded through the city canyons and came back to the
elevated tracks.</p>

<p>"Thought so!" he grunted. "We've got company, Miss Krants!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>"Closed car, sedan, has been following us," announced Renny. "Now we'll show
that driver something."</p>

<p>For the next minute or two, the redhead let out occasional gasps. Her
brother swore under his breath.</p>

<p>There was little traffic. But even that didn't seem to make seventy miles an
hour safe. Elevated pillars swished past like a row of close-set fence
pickets.</p>

<p>If the girl or her brother said anything for the next few seconds, it
couldn't be heard. The motor of the car was only a sibilant rush, but the
pillars crashed sound with their speed.</p>

<p>Renny grunted with satisfaction. The pursuing sedan apparently hadn't the
speed to overtake them. Then they whizzed into a new block. Just ahead was a
lumbering truck.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>Renny twisted desperately on the steering wheel. His strength almost tore it
from the post. The big truck was squarely across both car tracks.</p>

<p>The roadster brakes squawled. The red-headed girl clutched convulsively at
Renny's thick arm. Her hand slipped off. The tires of spongy rubber bit into
the pavement. The rubber burned.</p>

<p>The long hood took the impact. The side of the big truck splintered. Lora
Krants screamed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE girl's cry was short. Renny's bulky arm was across her body. He was
attempting to prevent her being hurled through the windshield. That glass would
not shatter. Likewise, it was bulletproof.</p>

<p>Renny's giant strength undoubtedly saved the girl's life. But she struck the
glass with force enough to knock her completely out. Barton, her brother, flew
from the side door. He was lucky in skidding, feet-first, on a smooth stretch
of asphalt.</p>

<p>Renny was only slightly stunned. He attempted to get the girl back into the
seat. Behind them a sedan skidded to an abrupt stop. Men poured from this car.
Others were springing from the truck.</p>

<p>The murdered man at Doc's door had some dire meaning. But it was all a deep
mystery to Renny. The snub-nosed gun suddenly shoved under his arm was
definite. Not many men would have done other than lift their hands.</p>

<p>But Renny really liked this red-headed girl. Almost as much as he liked a
good scrap. Renny had less caution than man power.</p>

<p>He hit the man holding the gun so hard and so unexpectedly, the weapon flew
out of his hands. His fists were mauling sledges as he sprang into the
street.</p>

<p>One of the attackers made a serious mistake.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" he growled. "She said to take him alive!"</p>

<p>Renny was not pausing to think about who "she" might be.</p>

<p>The engineer picked out the man who had spoken. One fist traveled in a wide
arc. It was a haymaker that landed the man five yards away. Renny backed up to
the truck.</p>

<p>The giant had no special rules about fighting. In less than half a minute he
had piled six or seven men in a heap.</p>

<p>Renny downed two more men with sickening smashes. He waded toward the
roadster.</p>

<p>A long arm reached out. It was lengthened by the snubnosed machine gun it
held. The steel barrel rapped cruelly upon Renny's tough skull.</p>

<p>Renny went to his hands and knees. He thought the asphalt had heaved up and
struck him. Then he was out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>WHEN Renny awoke, he was bound hand and foot. A tight blindfold covered his
eyes. But the warmth about him informed him he was in some apartment. His head
was aching. But his hearing was unimpaired.</p>

<p>He strained at the cords binding him when he heard the husky, and clearly
angry voice of Lora Krants. Then he abruptly ceased his effort.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" he grumbled. "I mighta known it was something like that! Darned
if you can ever trust a woman!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter V. THE STRANGE REDHEAD</h2>

<p>"FOOLS!" spoke the voice of Lora Krants. "He is the wrong man! You ought to
have known that. Why didn't you wait for my signal?"</p>

<p>Renny was greatly puzzled. Anyway, he thought grimly, he was the man who had
got this headache out of it. Then the girl added a few words.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage has gone to Washington by plane!"</p>

<p>So that was it, judged Renny. The charming redhead had been only a decoy.
She had been sent to bait Doc Savage into this trap.</p>

<p>Then Renny was more amazed. Barton, the brother of Lora Krants, had
spoken.</p>

<p>"We'll turn him loose then," he said. "We haven't any time to waste.
Anything might happen in the next hour or two."</p>

<p>Men came into the room. They pulled Renny to his feet.</p>

<p>"Think you're able to navigate?" said one.</p>

<p>"Untie my hands and you'll think I can!" boomed Renny.</p>

<p>"Guess he's all O.K.," said another man.</p>

<p>"It would be best to gag him until you are out of the way," said the cool
voice of Lora Krants. "We don't want to get the police in on this. They'll be
tracing those smashed cars right now."</p>

<p>A gag was slapped over Renny's mouth. He was carried down several flights of
stairs. After a short ride in a car, he was rolled out onto a grassy plot. A
knife slid along the cords around his arms.</p>

<p>Renny was compelled to waste time untying the knots around his legs. He
pulled the gag from his mouth. The tape blindfold took some hairs with it. A
car purred away.</p>

<p>Renny stood up and blinked. He was in the approximate middle of Central
Park. The car had made only two turns. Renny fixed a location that might be the
apartment house from which he had been brought.</p>

<p>That would have to keep. He considered it more important to get back to
headquarters. Long Tom was probably alone now. Professor Callus had said he
would be leaving soon.</p>

<p>Renny wished he knew why Doc had insisted he escort Lora Krants to her home.
Well, anyway, he reflected grimly, he had carried out the order. Hailing a
taxicab, Renny headed for the midtown skyscraper.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE buzzer at Doc Savage's headquarters sounded faintly. It was but a few
minutes after Renny and Lora Krants, with the others, had departed. Long Tom
had been unsuccessfully trying to make something out of the radio jumble.</p>

<p>"Good gosh!" he exploded impatiently. "More visitors?"</p>

<p>Professor Callus wagged his shiny head and smiled.</p>

<p>"It would seem that secrecy no longer attaches to this investigation of the
disturbed ocean," he said.</p>

<p>The man who came in was tall and of the same Oriental coloring as the
recently departed Kama Dbhana. His teeth flashed in a pleased smile.</p>

<p>"I have been informed only tonight," he said, "that Clark Savage has been
investigating--"</p>

<p>"Sure, I know!" snapped Long Tom. "Your friend in the Coast Survey told you!
Now what do you want?"</p>

<p>The dark-skinned Oriental continued to smile. Long Tom stepped back
suddenly, slowly putting up his hands. The outside door had remained open.
Other men with yellow faces seemed to glide in without walking.</p>

<p>There were six of these men. All were smiling. But the guns in their hands
brought no smile to Long Tom's face. The electrical expert made a quick
movement to reach for a pocket.</p>

<p>But he was not quick enough. Six unwavering guns were fixed upon his middle.
Combined fire could have sliced him to pieces.</p>

<p>"We know you are alone here, with only this man who is not one of Doc
Savage's companions," stated the dark-skinned leader. "You will not be
harmed."</p>

<p>Professor Callus sputtered. But he was seized with Long Tom. Steel cuffs of
intricate design clinked onto their wrists behind their backs. Damp cloths were
slapped over their faces.</p>

<p>The drug was not chloroform. Long Tom had never before smelled this perfumed
odor. He did not puzzle over it long. He and Professor Callus were bundled to
one side. Both were peacefully sleeping.</p>

<p>Directed by their still-smiling leader, the six dark men went to work
methodically. Strangely, they seemed to be acquainted with the most vital parts
of all the delicate apparatus with which Doc had been seeking the origin of the
ocean haunt.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes, the wreckage was as complete as if one of
Professor Homus Jasson's bombs had been touched off.</p>

<p>Weather instruments, light recorders, the radio were ripped apart and
smashed. The Orientals touched nothing in the laboratory except the gadgets
used directly in the checking up on the haunted ocean.</p>

<p>They moved out as silently as they had come. The leader pulled the cover
from the face of Professor Homus Jasson. The dead man still had a look of
horror in his eyes.</p>

<p>The Oriental smiled with his white teeth.</p>

<p>"The master will be greatly pleased," he said. "This makes all perfect for
the one who would sell."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOWNSTAIRS, Renny alighted from his taxicab. He saw seven men getting into a
closed car. They had yellow, Oriental skins.</p>

<p>"Good grief!" he muttered. "I suppose we've been having some more visitors!
Looks like that guy Kama's friends or--"</p>

<p>Renny whipped into the building. He shot upward in Doc's own private
elevator. This rocketlike lift passed seventy floors at a speed that would have
projected it through the tower of the imposing mass of steel and marble.</p>

<p>Cushioned apparatus slowed it at the eighty-sixth floor.</p>

<p>Doc Savage's outside door was standing open. Renny proceeded with infinite
caution. At the door of the laboratory he halted with a deep groan.</p>

<p>"I might have known something like that would happen," he murmured to
himself. "I wonder where--"</p>

<p>A dull thumping came from one side of the room. Renny sprang to what seemed
to be only the smooth wall. A panel swung open.</p>

<p>Professor Callus rolled out, groaning. His big head seemed to be attached to
his body by only a thin rag. But his neck was not broken. As Long Tom staggered
to his feet, Professor Callus arose.</p>

<p>"This is terrible--terrible!" said the professor. "Everything has been
smashed! I thought we were done for!"</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded Renny. "I saw men who looked like that Kama
guy!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Long Tom, mournfully. "We didn't have a chance! We were
drugged and put into the cabinet."</p>

<p>The cabinet was one of the ventilated spaces in which Doc Savage sometimes
imprisoned individuals he might want to question later.</p>

<p>"Set up the emergency," said Renny. "We've got to find out what happened to
Doc."</p>

<p>Professor Callus opened his eyes. From what appeared to be a blank wall
space emerged the complete equipment of an intricate radio and television set.
This was a set maintained by Doc Savage for an emergency.</p>

<p>But when it went into service, the squawking and bumbling had become more
intense. The apparatus was useless.</p>

<p>Renny had an idea. He went to the telephone. Thumbing through the book, he
found the number of Cyrus Krants, the bathosphere man.</p>

<p>It must have been the voice of a caretaker or some servant replying to
Renny's call.</p>

<p>"I would like to speak with Miss Krants, Miss Lora Krants," said Renny. "It
is important. I have news of her missing father."</p>

<p>The reply was instant, unhesitating.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but Miss Lora Krants is visiting friends in California. You said her
father is missing? There must be some mistake. Cyrus Krants has been in touch
with his home every day. Who is this speaking?"</p>

<p>Renny did not say who was speaking. His sudden liking for the red-headed
girl had completely evaporated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter VI. DAWN AT MIDNIGHT</h2>

<p>DURING the wrecking of his Manhattan weather instruments, Doc Savage had
been holding his silver-winged plane to a line closely bordering the Atlantic
coast. Ham and Monk were engaged in one of their usual caustic exchanges.</p>

<p>"An' a red-headed woman made a fool out of me," chanted Ham, with tuneless
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" piped Monk. "An' you'll shut up or I'll be makin' mincemeat
outta you!"</p>

<p>Doc was watching the lights of Baltimore, a mile below.</p>

<p>A shrill grunt accompanied Monk's irate exclamation. An animal that looked
to be all ears and legs, seemed to sympathize with the apelike chemist's
remarks. This was Habeas Corpus, Monk's pet pig.</p>

<p>"That shote's a fine thing to be taking to a conference at Washington,"
grinned Ham. "At that, he'll probably make about the same impression as his
master."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" sputtered Monk. "If you had his brains, you danged shyster,
you'd talk a lot less and think more!"</p>

<p>Doc interrupted the pleasant exchange.</p>

<p>"That's strange," he said, quietly. "It is just after midnight, but it would
seem the sun has decided to come up. Look over to the eastward."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" exploded Monk. "Looks like daylight's bustin' on us,
an' comin' fast! What's happened to the radio, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Um---um--bum---ulbum---ulbum!" squawked the loudspeaker in the plane.</p>

<p>"It has been going bad for some time," remarked Doc.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had figured he would make Washington well within two
hours. Suddenly he was not so sure about it.</p>

<p>The eerie dawn at midnight was spreading. The east took on a brighter hue.
But it was not as if the sun were rising. Usually, an ocean sunrise is varied
in color. This was much like a white fan spreading across the horizon.</p>

<p>"Looks something like the northern lights," suggested Ham.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>HABEAS CORPUS, the pig Monk had picked up in Arabia, was an animal of acute
instincts. Now he was standing rigidly. He sniffed and quivered.</p>

<p>"Something about it Habeas Corpus don't like," said Monk.</p>

<p>"I don't like that hog, but he is smarter than any ape," grinned Ham.</p>

<p>The radio squawking suddenly was cut off. There had been a sound like a
tremendous burst of static. Then silence.</p>

<p>"I don't like that," stated Doc. "Sounds as if something has smashed things
at headquarters."</p>

<p>From the plane's motor came a sputter. The engine of finest alloy metal
seemed to hesitate. But its cylinders picked up again. Doc's hand moved a
lever. This closed shutters around the motor.</p>

<p>These shutters were of a special material made to resist magnetic influence.
It was insulated against any known form of interference by any of the rays thus
far invented.</p>

<p>More than just a false sunrise had become apparent over the ocean. The plane
was passing over a vast expanse of shore marshes. No human habitations
showed.</p>

<p>Above the hissing of the plane's motor, a low humming became audible. Doc
Savage had been hearing this for some time. His ears were easily three times as
acute as those of Ham and Monk.</p>

<p>"It might be well to put on the 'chutes," advised Doc. "Those bogs provide a
poor footing for setting the plane down."</p>

<p>"Are we going to land out here?" piped up Monk.</p>

<p>The plane's motor gave the answer. Its muffled explosions ceased
suddenly.</p>

<p>Doc Savage stared at the switch for a few seconds. The propeller rotated
slowly. The man of bronze pushed a button. This should have lighted the
instrument board. There was no light. The electrical current had been lost.</p>

<p>"Something wrong with the wires?" questioned Ham. Doc did not reply. The
interior of the cabin now had no lights. They were not needed while daylight
had flooded the space. In the uneven line of the shore, the low caps of the
ocean swells, a fishing launch sprang into view.</p>

<p>Monk and Ham had hastily slipped their arms through the harness of
parachutes. The skilled hand of Doc Savage kept the plane winging in a wide,
descending spiral.</p>

<p>They were in daylight. Broad daylight at the hour of midnight. The plane was
as silent as if it never had been powered. Wind whistled through the wings in
its descent.</p>

<p>"Bail out!" Doc ordered the others.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had made no effort to don a parachute.</p>

<p>"You coming, Doc?" said Ham.</p>

<p>"I will be with you presently," said Doc.</p>

<p>Ham and Monk opened the door. Monk seized one ear of the pig Habeas Corpus.
They went out and dropped.</p>

<p>Doc was sticking with the plane. The silver ship flashed down. The man of
bronze had picked out a boggy hammock. Monk groaned.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred feet above the marsh, Doc leveled off. The wind shrieked
as the wings pancaked. The air cushioned the descent. The plane struck, settled
into the boggy ground.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC and his two companions found themselves in a wide space of mucky ground.
They sank over their knees. The going was tough enough for Doc and Ham.</p>

<p>Monk's short legs made it worse for him. The weight of the pig was a
handicap.</p>

<p>Monk set Habeas Corpus on his feet.</p>

<p>Doc, walking ahead, rubbed one hand over his smooth hair. Sparks flashed.
The atmosphere was charged with some strange force. They came to the shore
rocks.</p>

<p>In the marsh, birds were whistling. Some were shrill-voiced, as they greeted
the dawn.</p>

<p>Doc climbed the rocks. Ham and Monk followed. Habeas Corpus was still
struggling to break away.</p>

<p>Voices of men came from the ocean. Three fishermen on a small launch were
tramping their deck and swearing lustily. They were working furiously to get
their motor going.</p>

<p>"I surmise we are face to face with whatever has been haunting the ocean,"
stated Doc. "That launch has no power."</p>

<p>The launch drifted broadside onto the rocks. Doc and the others waded in and
helped the fishermen beach the boat.</p>

<p>"What in Hades is all this?" growled one of the fishermen. "Is it the horn
of Gabriel or something?"</p>

<p>"Well, it might be at that," replied Ham, cheerfully.</p>

<p>A smudge of smoke showed at sea. It rolled upward from just below the
horizon.</p>

<p>"That vessel seems to have stopped," said Doc.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied one of the fishermen. "We were out there when this thing
started. It's a coastal passenger steamer. They had to drop their hooks. Their
engines quit suddenly."</p>

<p>Doc Savage mounted a point of rocks. All around he was looking at what
appeared to be the circular curtain of night. Darkness had been thrust back
only a few miles. They were in the center of the eerie midnight
illumination.</p>

<p>It was possible to mark three different boats. Two of these were drifting.
The other had anchored.</p>

<p>"We must procure some new means of transportation," advised Doc. "It is
important that we get to Washington quickly."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE three fishermen accompanied them around the rim of the wide marsh.</p>

<p>On the first paved road no traffic was moving. An electric railway was
close. The building of a power substation bulked ahead. In the doorway were
four men in overalls.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" said one of the men. "Our own power went off, and when I
tried to telephone, it was dead!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. He led the way toward a farmhouse. A puzzled
countryman and his wife were standing in their yard.</p>

<p>"I ain't never seen the like o' this!" grumbled the farmer. "Even the derned
chickens thinks it's mornin'! But there ain't no sun!"</p>

<p>Doc smiled. "I judge the sun will be along at its usual time."</p>

<p>Two roosters were crowing at top pitch. They were greeting the morning.</p>

<p>"Have you a car?" Doc asked the farmer. "If so, I will pay you well to get
to some other means of transportation."</p>

<p>Doc smiled as he asked the question.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, the farmer learned the meaning of this smile. His best
efforts got no results. The battered farm machine had no power. The farmer
looked up with an oath. Once more, he whirled the crank savagely by hand.</p>

<p>Then something happened. It was like some one suddenly switching off a
brilliant flashlight. The darkness of midnight shut in the countryside. The
small motor of the car started so suddenly it backfired and kicked the farmer
onto his haunches.</p>

<p>Night had returned. From the direction of the railway substation came the
sudden humming of a dynamo. The power was on. The three fishermen shouted and
started back toward the shore.</p>

<p>Doc produced a roll of bills.</p>

<p>"We won't bother to hire the car," he said. "We'll buy it."</p>

<p>Ham and Monk piled in. Monk dragged Habeas Corpus aboard. The rickety
vehicle rattled out onto the highway.</p>

<p>Doc pushed the old motor to the limit. In less than half an hour he had
reached an airport and chartered a fast plane. This arrived in Washington after
a hop of a few minutes.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter VII. THE WORLD THREAT</h2>

<p>THE meeting between the president and Doc Savage was secret and informal.
The president stated he had sought this conversation with the man of bronze
because of his vast scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is fantastic," stated the president, "but it suggests such
great possible calamity, it cannot be overlooked! We seem to be threatened by
such a power as none of our government scientists and technicians have ever
believed could exist."</p>

<p>"Practical science has progressed in an incredible manner during the past
few years, Mr. President," stated Doc Savage. "None can say what vast force may
be discovered at any time. Unfortunately, the discoveries are not always made
by those of balanced and straightforward minds."</p>

<p>They were discussing the affair that had begun with the queer disturbance of
Coast and Geodetic Survey equipment. Doc had cautioned his companions against
mentioning, for the present, the occurrence on the coast.</p>

<p>But they had arrived in Washington to find themselves confronted with
several new and serious angles. Not only had the haunted ocean become apparent,
but the phenomenon was being used as a direct threat.</p>

<p>The purpose of that threat was of such fabulous character as to border upon
the incredible.</p>

<p>The government had been informed that it must disarm. Further, it had been
stated that all other nations would be similarly compelled to dispense with all
of their armed forces.</p>

<p>"We received the communication in such manner as to make it untraceable,"
said the president. "The message apparently originated somewhere in the
Northern Atlantic. It was relayed by radio from one ship to another."</p>

<p>"And you say the purpose of this is declared to end all war in the world?"
mused Doc Savage. "I would say the object is a most worthy one. At the same
time, such force as is threatened would not for long be confined to such a
benevolent purpose. If the machinery of any nation, any great city could be
paralyzed indefinitely, then this force would soon be in the hands of
rascals."</p>

<p>The president nodded his head.</p>

<p>"That is correct, Mr. Savage," he said, gravely. "But this whole thing
savors of a disordered mind. It would seem some lunatic has isolated himself in
The Land of the Midnight Sun."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" rapped Monk.</p>

<p>"The lunatic's ideas of yesterday often become the great inventions of
today," interrupted Doc, quickly. "You say this unknown sender of the message
demands complete disarmament at once? He declared he has the power to control
the destinies of all other countries?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the president. "And to prove it, he declares he will demonstrate
this power. He has set eight o'clock this morning. If he can do it, all of the
New York area will be rendered inactive from the hour set until noon."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"WON'T that be something for the anti-noise boys?" said Ham. "Imagine New
York City without a wheel turning. No thunder of the subway, no roar of the
elevated, no grind of traffic--"</p>

<p>"Anyway," said the president, "the whole thing can hardly be other than the
ravings of a lunatic. The whole thing is probably unworthy of our serious
attention."</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. He was thinking of The Land of the Midnight Sun.
Back there on the Maryland coast there had been daylight.</p>

<p>"I believe with you that this threatener may be unbalanced," said Doc. "But
I also believe he will do exactly as he says."</p>

<p>The president tried to laugh. His mirth had a hollow sound.</p>

<p>"And we have received no further word of the war commission or the steamship
Trafalgar Square," he stated.</p>

<p>A secretary presented a message to the president.</p>

<p>"Then there is something, Mr. Savage! Some ships were stopped off the
Maryland coast! A naval destroyer was without power for nearly an hour! They
report a mysterious light like daylight!"</p>

<p>"Yes," observed Doc. "One of my best planes is bogged down in a Maryland
marsh."</p>

<p>The president stared at the bronze man bleakly.</p>

<p>"You hadn't mentioned that," he said, gravely. "I wish we had Arne Dass with
us."</p>

<p>"I knew Arne Dass was missing," stated Doc. "His knowledge would indeed be
most valuable."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the president. "Dass has been gone for more than six months. His
scientific work with the navy department was invaluable. We fear some foreign
agency may have had a hand in his disappearance."</p>

<p>The work of Arne Dass, an aged scientist, was a high spot in the history of
the navy department. He had developed some of the most effective weapons of
warfare.</p>

<p>"What steps would you advise we take?" said the president.</p>

<p>"I know of none that might be effective before eight o'clock this morning,"
stated Doc. "That is now barely six hours away. We shall fly back to New York
at once."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE was back in his eighty-sixth floor laboratory at dawn. The man of
bronze had been busy for nearly an hour. One telephone call had been a contact
with an electro-chemical company plant on the Hudson River.</p>

<p>The man of bronze owned a controlling interest in this works. For ten
minutes he talked with one of the machinery designers. The plan for what he
desired was being copied by the designer in elaborate detail. The intricate
design had been evolved and mapped in the amazing brain of the bronze
giant.</p>

<p>"Put all the men necessary on this to have it ready within twelve hours,"
instructed Doc.</p>

<p>The man of bronze returned to chemical experiments he had been making. He
was clad in a cloak of gray rubberized fabric. His head was encased in what
might have been a diver's helmet of crystal.</p>

<p>The chemicals Doc was employing were of a deadly character. It lacked two
hours until eight o'clock.</p>

<p>A red light glowed and a buzzer whined. Doc removed the glass helmet and
picked up the telephone.</p>

<p>"The White House speaking," said a voice. "We have received word of two
lifeboats from the Trafalgar Square being picked up. Our information says they
were in the vicinity of the Lofoten Islands, off the coast of Norway."</p>

<p>"The islands are a thousand and more miles north of the English Channel,"
stated Doc. "It sounds rather fantastic. But the commission? What have you
learned?"</p>

<p>"Very little. Washington is trying to get a clear story of what happened to
the Trafalgar Square. The steamer was abandoned. And it is reported the war
commission has been abducted. A lifeboat carrying them vanished into the north.
That may be only a wild tale."</p>

<p>"I fear you will find it is true," stated Doc.</p>

<p>The conversation was terminated.</p>

<p>Doc summoned the others to the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Whatever affairs you may have at hand should be adjusted quickly," he
stated. "Brothers, we are soon to journey into the Arctic regions, so equip
yourselves."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC had left off his helmet. The door buzzer whined. Doc threw a switch. A
square of frosted glass was illuminated. In that glass was a man crawling.
Scarlet liquid oozed from his mouth and dripped slowly from his chin.</p>

<p>The frosted glass gave a detailed view of the corridor in front of Doc
Savage's door.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" rasped Ham. "Another one!"</p>

<p>Renny and Long Tom were staring.</p>

<p>"It's that fellow who said he was a Norwegian," declared Long Tom. "He left
here with that fellow, Kama."</p>

<p>Hjalmar Landson, the blond Norwegian, had staggered from the elevator.
Likely he had fallen after the car started downward. For he now was making a
second effort to reach the door. Doc glided through the library into the outer
room. The door opened by the radio contact.</p>

<p>The big Norwegian half arose to his feet. His eyes were like hard, blue ice.
But they were beginning to glaze a little. One big hand wiped the oozing blood
from his lips.</p>

<p>"Doc--Doc Savage--" he mumbled. "You must--must know about this--Knut
Aage--he will--"</p>

<p>Hjalmar Landson slid forward on his face. The ornamental handle of a dagger
stuck gruesomely from between his shoulders. Nearly all of a queerly curved
blade had been sunk beside his spine.</p>

<p>Doc Savage made a quick injection from a syringe. Hjalmar Landson appeared
to come back from death itself.</p>

<p>"They'll get it--find Knut Aage--Salten Fjord--Moskenes--north passage in
Satan's Gateway--this professor--who died--Kama wanted to buy--my country--go
there--"</p>

<p>The Norwegian's last words were only liquid gurgling. What he might have
meant by his reference to the dead professor, Homus Jasson, he now could never
reveal.</p>

<p>Stretched in death, Hjalmar Landson more than ever resembled a blond Viking
of the Far North.</p>

<p>"Whatever he might have been, he was loyal to his country to the last,"
stated Doc Savage. "Moskenes is one of the Lofoten Islands."</p>

<p>"Kama!" exclaimed Ham. "That would be his murderer!"</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" growled Renny. "I wouldn't be so sure! There is that bogus
red-headed Krants girl!"</p>

<p>But at this moment, Doc and his companions had another matter to claim their
attention.</p>

<p>The heart of Hjalmar Landson, the Norwegian, had ceased beating at precisely
eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>And with it, the heart of Greater New York City also halted its loudly
pulsing stroke.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. WHEN A CITY STOPPED</h2>

<p>NEW YORK CITY, Manhattan and all of its environs, had been warned from
Washington. Several million persons were cautioned to be on their guard.</p>

<p>Trains might stop. Ferries might be disabled. Subways could become unsafe.
Elevated tracks might cease to thunder.</p>

<p>In other words, advised Washington by radio and early edition newspapers, a
few million persons should be careful of their activities at eight o'clock this
morning.</p>

<p>New York at eight o'clock in the morning was going about its customary
business. In the eighty-sixth floor headquarters of Doc Savage could be heard
the humming thunder of the active city.</p>

<p>So great and constant is this roar of traffic, its beat ceases to be
recorded by the ears of the average New Yorkers. These waves of sound were
rolling up when Hjalmar Landson staggered to his death in Doc Savage's
corridor.</p>

<p>Now another wave arose. More appalling perhaps than anything else that could
happen. It was an abrupt wave of silence.</p>

<p>Comparative silence, but an absence of sound, nevertheless. For shouting
voices, even screaming crowds in suddenly halted subway trains, on stopped
elevated coaches, flowing from thousands of automobiles blocking the streets,
hardly registered after the customary thunder of traffic had died.</p>

<p>New York had stopped. Stopped, paralyzed.</p>

<p>Congestion and panic in the subways were the worst. The trains had stopped.
All lights went out. Thousands of workers were trapped in Stygian darkness.
Perhaps thousands would have been killed there and on the elevated, where they
were pouring from halted trains, had the third rails still been working.</p>

<p>Motormen and guards tried ineffectually to prevent the maddened crowds from
seeking to escape along the tracks. The guards were overwhelmed. Crowds
streamed toward the stairs leading to the streets.</p>

<p>Doc Savage and his companions looked from a window down into the canyon of
the street far below.</p>

<p>"Looks like one of those slow motion pictures," observed Ham. "Look, Doc!
Every automobile has stopped!"</p>

<p>Bewildered masses crowded into doorways. Their white faces were lifted
toward the blue sky. Many seemed to believe this might be Judgment Day.</p>

<p>"The thing is complete," stated Doc. "Our lights are gone. All electrical
current has been stopped."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE man of bronze whipped into the laboratory. He returned with one of their
generator flashlights. Even the small generator in this device refused to
respond.</p>

<p>"Doc!" exclaimed Long Tom. "We're locked in! The electroscope is out of
order!"</p>

<p>The main doors, which had been closed, failed to operate. There was no radio
contact. However, there were various exits available from the headquarters.</p>

<p>Doc Savage's emergency radio was dead. So much a part of modern life had the
radio become, that this one feature alone of the paralyzed city was perhaps the
most terrifying. Bewildered housewives, seeking to ascertain why their vacuum
cleaners, their automatic refrigerators, their lights and their telephones had
gone dead, turned the knobs of their radios.</p>

<p>Within the first half hour, even the voices of the crowds became silenced.
The words of individuals were being spoken in whispers. Their natural voices
sounded unearthly loud without the accustomed background of the city's
clamor.</p>

<p>"Brothers, no such power has ever before appeared," stated Doc. "We are
informed this threat is made to force an end to all war. It is a good purpose.
But even now, I more than suspect this force is known and desired by fiendish
brains."</p>

<p>The murderer of Professor Homus Jasson and of Hjalmar Landson were
convincing evidence this was true.</p>

<p>Because it was a clear day, the difference in the quality of light did not
appear to the casual millions. But in Doc's laboratory the light recorders were
mysteriously agitated.</p>

<p>And in the most acute ears was that low, throbbing hum, as if the air
suddenly had become filled with billions of invisible, buzzing insects.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>EXACTLY at the noon hour, New York City came to life. The transition from
powerless machinery to a sudden surge of returned energy was more disastrous
than the stopping of the city had been.</p>

<p>Now trains were starting. Thousands of motors started unexpectedly. Hundreds
were caught and injured.</p>

<p>Radios squawked. Every telephone was immediately seized upon by the person
nearest. The flood of calls overwhelmed the exchanges. The automatic lines were
choked.</p>

<p>In some of the skyscrapers, elevators shot up or down. They had been
abandoned with power on by some of the terrified operators.</p>

<p>Yet such was the influence of Doc Savage, he was one of the first persons to
put through a call. Having been fully informed of the dubious standing of the
red-headed girl who had said she was Lora Krants, the man of bronze was making
contact with a banker.</p>

<p>"You have the handling of the affairs of Cyrus Krants?" said Doc. "The
information I seek may be of vital importance."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am in touch with the personal affairs of the Krants family," stated
the banker. "If I can be of assistance, I will."</p>

<p>"We have been told Miss Lora Krants is in California and her father is in
daily touch with his home," said Doc. "Is that true?"</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake," replied the banker. "Miss Lora Krants is here
in New York. I happen to know she appeared to you for help last night. Her
father has been unheard from for several days. Our firm would regard it as a
personal favor if you would do what you can, Mr. Savage."</p>

<p>As Doc replaced the telephone, the exotic trilling of sudden discovery
reached his companions. Renny had been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>"The young lady appears to be Miss Krants," stated Doc. "My informant is
most reliable."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "Doc, when can we get started for the North Pole,
or wherever we're going? In a minute, I'll wake up and discover I dreamed all
that happened this morning."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC made no reply. He was again on the telephone. In a few minutes he had
put through a call to the Pacific coast. He held a short conversation with a
person in Del Monte, in southern California. When he replaced the instrument,
he made no explanation.</p>

<p>During this conversation, a visitor had arrived. He was the massive-headed
Professor Callus.</p>

<p>"Another one!" he exclaimed in a shocked voice, as he saw the body of
Hjalmar Landson. "What in the world can this terrible thing mean, Mr. Savage?
Could all of this incredible phenomena of this morning, these murders, be
related to our haunted ocean?"</p>

<p>"It would seem that is the case," stated Doc. "Have you ever had any contact
with this man Landson, or the man called Kama, before they appeared here last
night, Professor Callus?"</p>

<p>"I never saw either of them before," said the big-headed man. "I returned
today, hoping to learn what their interest might have been in the ocean
disturbance. I did see Landson at an early hour this morning on Fifth Avenue
near Central Park."</p>

<p>"Was he alone at that time?"</p>

<p>Professor Callus shook his shiny head, as if with reluctance.</p>

<p>"No," he said, slowly, "but I hesitated to speak of it. Probably it has no
relation to what might have happened later. Landson was riding in a sedan early
this morning with Miss Krants and the brother she called Barton."</p>

<p>"We might've known it!" spilled Renny. "What time was that, professor?"</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can recall, it was between seven and eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"And he reached here and died just when the city went dead," said Ham. "That
seems to provide a clear case of circumstantial evidence."</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" piped up Monk, unexpectedly. "That girl wouldn't have done
it! She wouldn't go around stickin' a knife in anybody's back!"</p>

<p>"Or an automatic in your neck," said Ham, sarcastically. "Or maybe a hypo in
that other dead man."</p>

<p>Doc Savage changed the subject suddenly.</p>

<p>"As I told you before, prepare for Arctic conditions. You will proceed at
once to the Hudson River hangars. I shall join you within a short time. Renny,
describe for me the approximate location of that apartment near Central Park
where you were taken."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter IX. DOC IS TRAPPED</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE arrived at the address given by Renny.</p>

<p>"The Krants's servants left early this morning," said the janitor of the
Central Park apartment house. "There was only the housekeeper and her husband.
They've been taking care of the apartment."</p>

<p>Doc Savage exhibited no surprise at the apparent absence of the Krants
family. Seemingly, the man of bronze left the apartment house. Five minutes
later he was ascending the tradesmen's stairway at the back of the
building.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had little difficulty in obtaining an entrance. The Krants
apartment contained five bedrooms.</p>

<p>Doc glided from one room to another. None of the rooms showed evidence of
having been occupied within the past few days. The big living room had been
converted partly into a library.</p>

<p>Doc's flaky gold eyes stirred with little whirlpools. Two crossed daggers
had been crossed above a big table. One dagger was still in place. The mark on
the wall showed the other had been removed recently.</p>

<p>The handle of the remaining dagger was ornamented and inlaid with jewels.
The design was a replica of that which had been buried in the back of Hjalmar
Landson, the Norwegian.</p>

<p>Doc crossed to a window facing Central Park. He pulled back the heavy
drapery a part of an inch. His face was inscrutable as he watched a sedan
arrive and park in the avenue below.</p>

<p>From the time he had left his headquarters Doc had known he was being
shadowed. He was not surprised when a man got out of the sedan and crossed the
street to a point where he could best keep an eye on the apartment house.</p>

<p>The watcher had a yellowish skin. He was immaculately dressed. His movement
was the glide of an Oriental. From the description given by Long Tom, Doc
identified the man as Kama Dbhana, of San Tao.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC was turning from the window. His movement ceased. His remarkable senses
were not of an occult character. But his ears could detect the ticking of the
finest watch.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the apartment a watch was ticking. That watch was not hidden in
a drawer. For the sound had moved. It was still moving.</p>

<p>Doc kept close to the wall. He glided noiselessly toward the large room
adjoining the living room. In the doorway, he halted and listened.</p>

<p>A telephone on the table had been shifted since he had entered. A picture on
the wall had been moved. But few men in the world would have noted these minor
details. Doc Savage never entered any room without instantly fixing the
position of each object.</p>

<p>Doc apparently had not noticed anything unusual. He walked slowly across the
room toward an inner door. Except for the door which he had entered, all
windows and doors were closed.</p>

<p>The window drapes were closely drawn and the room was in semidarkness. This
did not prevent Doc from seeing moving figures.</p>

<p>Doc stood in the middle of the room and waited. Into his hands had come two
small glass objects. Each contained enough anaesthetic gas to have overcome a
dozen men.</p>

<p>The rush toward him came from the shadows. There was hardly a whisper of
movement and no voice of command. But Doc saw there were eight or ten figures.
All wore clumsy-appearing masks.</p>

<p>More strange than the masks, was the fact that none of the figures seemed to
be armed. Their hands were empty. Perhaps they counted on the weight of
numbers.</p>

<p>The little glass capsules hardly tinkled. They were crushed on the rug at
Doc's feet. The man of bronze had inhaled a deep breath, then had expelled some
of it. He was capable of some three to four minutes without breathing.</p>

<p>The gas should have put these attackers to sleep instantly. But they
remained erect. And none touched the bronze man. He was simply ringed in by the
menacing masks. The figures might have had queer weapons not now displayed.</p>

<p>A slender figure separated from the others. The husky, muffled voice of a
woman spoke. It was so disguised as to be unidentifiable. The woman was
calm.</p>

<p>"You are powerful enough to defeat some of us, Doc Savage," advised the
voice. "But you could not overpower all of us. I would advise you to surrender.
Your devices are useless against us. We are doing this for your own good. We
would save the lives of you and your companions."</p>

<p>In addition to her mask, the woman wore an enveloping hood.</p>

<p>"I seem to have no choice," replied Doc, quietly. "But you should put up
your hair more carefully. Where it shows, it is red."</p>

<p>There was no red hair showing. But the woman's hand whipped instantly
upward, feeling the hood. At once, she laughed huskily.</p>

<p>"I've been informed you are very clever, Doc Savage," the woman said. "It
seems you live up to your reputation! But that cannot save you now. We
are--"</p>

<p>Doc expelled his breath slowly. The anaesthetic gas had dissipated into the
air. It was only effective for a lesser time than Doc could hold his
breath.</p>

<p>His symmetrical body moved with flashing speed. The arc of the bronze fists
could not have been followed by any human eye.</p>

<p>Most certainly the blows could not have been dodged. Knuckles crunched into
masked faces. The figures massed in a combined rush. Doc's twisting hands
caught up one man and hurled him broadside against others. Four men went down
in a heap.</p>

<p>Only four figures were on their feet. A sinewy arm went around Doc's throat.
His effort to free himself from the grip caused a gun to be shoved into his
neck. At least one attacker was armed.</p>

<p>Doc realized the odds were against him. He relaxed his fight. They bound him
and carried him with them when they departed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"ONLY by the certain removal of Doc Savage can our enterprise be made safe,"
spoke a voice.</p>

<p>"I agree with you perfectly," spoke a woman. "I am glad you have come to see
it my way. He tricked me into betraying myself. He undoubtedly knows who I am.
When will he be removed? They say he has powers that amount to black
magic!"</p>

<p>A macabre laugh came from the invisible man.</p>

<p>"That has all been arranged," he said. "The automatic device on the death
tank will work in fifteen minutes. By then we will be conspicuously in another
place some distance from here."</p>

<p>Doc Savage heard this conversation. He had been dumped on the bare floor of
what appeared to be a large room in some deserted loft building. There are
hundreds of such lofts located along the Hudson and the East Rivers.</p>

<p>Doc could tell this building was close to the river. Boats were passing not
far away. The man speaking might be Kama. At least, the voice was the same.</p>

<p>All of his devices had been stripped from his body. Knowledge of his many
secrets was indicated. Even his bullet-proof skullcap of metal had been
removed. His feet were bare. False toenails were missing. Hollow shells worn
over some of his teeth had been taken out.</p>

<p>It was the most thorough job of rendering the bronze giant helpless he had
ever encountered. The bonds held him rigid. He could only wait.</p>

<p>The woman laughed again, harshly.</p>

<p>"Well, let's be on our way," she said. "You will be going to Washington
tonight?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," replied the man's voice. "Perhaps it would be
best to hold out for greater returns."</p>

<p>Their feet beat hollowly on the bare floor of another room. A distant door
was slammed. Doc could hear the thudding of their feet on stairs.</p>

<p>Doc's acute senses picked up a ticking. He judged it was some device for
timing. There was not so much as a table or chair in the room. Doc had tried
all of the muscular contortions that would have freed him from ordinary bonds.
He met with no success.</p>

<p>Thick dust of the abandoned loft choked his nostrils. It was useless to call
for help in this empty building. He rolled in the direction of the ticking.</p>

<p>A bright aluminum tank was set in an alcove of the big room. All of the
windows were tightly closed. Some cracks had been carefully sealed with strips
of paper to make more certain it would be a death chamber.</p>

<p>A timing device was affixed to an ordinary alarm clock at the top of the
tank. The ringing of the alarm would release a spring. This in turn would
release the valve at the top of the tank. Doc had no doubt but that the
cylinder contained some deadly gas.</p>

<p>A small vial contained a colorless liquid. It was set to fall and break on
the floor. Doubtless it contained an inflammable chemical which would be set
off by the jar of the vial. Perhaps the gas in the tank would be combustible.
Or it might merely kill.</p>

<p>The fire chemical on the dry floor of the loft would start an immediate
blaze either way. Before the fire would be discovered, the identity of a body
would be almost entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>Doc rolled close to the tank. His first thought was to break the timing
device. Then he saw that any disturbance of the tank would cause the spring to
release the death valve.</p>

<p>Likewise, a touch would send the fire chemical to be broken on the
floor.</p>

<p>More than five minutes had passed. Doc rolled to the window. By tremendous
effort he again got to his feet. He teetered forward and his bronzed head
crashed the glass and the frame. But only a small aperture was made.</p>

<p>Below was the river, down ten stories. Boats were passing, far out in the
stream. Doc attempted to break out another section of the heavy sash with his
head, but the effort threw him on his back.</p>

<p>Then the alarm clock device rang. Immediately, there came a low hiss of
escaping gas. There was a slight thud and a tinkling of glass.</p>

<p>Bluish vapor rolled into the room. As it struck the air, it seemed converted
into writhing, bloated globes.</p>

<p>A quick, bright flame was spreading on the floor of the alcove. A tongue of
fire darted up the wall.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC fought to his feet. He jammed his head and shoulders into the space of
the broken window. That way, he would have fresh air for the maximum of time.
He knew the death gas was filling the room behind him.</p>

<p>The alcove had become a flaming mass. Doc looked intently at the river far
below. But he could not force his body through the small window space.</p>

<p>Behind Doc, the room was being converted into a fiery furnace. The bronze
man's clothes smoked. The back of his neck was being blistered. Only his face
being jammed into the window saved him from breathing the deadly gas.</p>

<p>There came a great crashing. Doc thought at first a part of a wall had
fallen. But it was the door which bulged on its hinges. It might have been a
sledge hammer that struck it. At the second blow, a stout panel cracked.</p>

<p>The third blow smashed the panel altogether. It was no hammer. A great,
knuckled fist projected into the room. Another fist struck. The whole door
buckled. A voice boomed.</p>

<p>"Hey, Doc! Holy cow! You in there?"</p>

<p>Doc called, "Keep back, Renny, keep back! Poison gas!"</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" howled the voice of Monk. "Lemme get at them windows,
Renny!"</p>

<p>Side by side, the giant Renny and the grotesque, apelike chemist shouldered
into the room. The draught from the door fanned the fire. Their clothes
smoked.</p>

<p>But they took the windows. They smashed them with their big fists. Sashes
and glass disintegrated. Renny and Monk were holding their breaths. So were Ham
and Long Tom. The latter two were freeing Doc.</p>

<p>Within forty seconds after the door had been smashed by the great fists of
Renny, Doc and the others were clumping down the stairs. Above them, the top of
the loft building was an inferno. A dense cloud of flame and smoke rolled out
over the river.</p>

<p>Fire apparatus was wailing into the street. Doc led the way from a side
door. So far as outside information was concerned, he desired it to be believed
he had perished in the burning loft.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>AGAIN it was night.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was directing the stowing away of a strange contrivance aboard
the speediest of his tri-motored planes. The plane was fueled for four thousand
miles. Not that it carried an extraordinary amount of gas and oil. The new
motors, more modern than any other in the world, consumed a minimum of
fuel.</p>

<p>Doc's companions saw a new machine had been placed aboard. The machine was
in the form of an immense snubnosed cylinder. Part of its construction must
have been a new combination of the vitreous elements of glass. Coils of pipes
and a few tanks could be seen plainly through the outer shell.</p>

<p>This machine had just been delivered from the electro-chemical machine
plant. It had been constructed within twelve hours.</p>

<p>Doc had inquired what had brought his companions to the burning loft
building.</p>

<p>"A woman called us," had been Renny's reply. "The phone was ringing at the
hangar when we arrived. The woman said to be on the top floor of that loft
building at six o'clock, just at sunset. We made it just in time."</p>

<p>All of the signs at the now burned loft building indicated Doc had been
conveyed there by several men. A woman, and Doc believed a red-headed woman,
had been in command of the crowd that had taken him prisoner.</p>

<p>Was there still another woman involved?</p>

<p>The man of bronze had arrived at one definite conclusion. Already several
foreign countries were in the market for the power that had paralyzed New York,
haunted the ocean. And most nations find women, pretty women, valuable for this
class of intrigue.</p>

<p>The big plane was ready to taxi from the hangar onto the wide Hudson River
for its take-off. Doc Savage made a telephone connection with Washington.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FROM the White House came new and startling news.</p>

<p>The crew of a rescued lifeboat from the missing Trafalgar Square had
talked.</p>

<p>"Men in the boat say they were hauled at tremendous speed by some invisible
force," Doc Savage was informed.</p>

<p>"That might account for their being in the vicinity of the Lofoten Islands,"
stated Doc. "The boats were picked up not far from Moskenes Island, near Salten
Fjord."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" came the amazed voice from the White House.</p>

<p>"Mere surmise," stated Doc. "You have no word of the war commission, but you
probably have received a new message."</p>

<p>"Yes. Another relayed radio. I'll read it: 'The United States must disarm.
So must all other nations. You have five days to decide. The navy must be laid
up. The army must be disbanded. All armament must be destroyed. The same order
applies to all nations of the world. Peace will be applied at any price.'"</p>

<p>"Sounds as if the sender knew definitely what can be done," stated Doc.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the White House. "If we only had Arne Dass here to advise us. He
knew a great deal about atomic energy he never revealed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may find Arne Dass," said Doc.</p>

<p>He gave no reason for his belief.</p>

<p>As the conversation ended, Monk was dragging Habeas Corpus aboard the plane.
The Arabian pig already was shivering. He had seen the queer suit of fur Monk
had provided for him.</p>

<p>"We leave at once for the Lofoten Islands off the coast of Norway," Doc
announced. "Perhaps we shall soon have a trace of the war commission and
Johnny."</p>

<p>On the open sea, far in the north, at least one man in a lifeboat would have
been gratified to know Doc Savage's plan. At the time the bronze man's speedy
plane took off from the Hudson River, the position of Johnny and those with him
was hardly enviable.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter X. THE MIDNIGHT SUN</h2>

<p>EIGHT men occupied the open lifeboat. Two were in the uniform of sailors.
The other six wore plain business attire. Luckily they had heavy-collared
overcoats. These they had with them for the chilly crossing of the stormy
English Channel.</p>

<p>None of the six had suspected what extremes of cold these same coats would
be called upon to resist.</p>

<p>The faces of the six men indicated they were uncomfortable, and completely
mystified.</p>

<p>The lifeboat was now speeding through the calm, green water of an inner
channel under towering ice cliffs. At first glance, it would have appeared the
lifeboat was moving by black magic. No propeller swirled at its stern. Its bow
cut the water on a rising crest.</p>

<p>One of the men was a skeletonlike figure. He shook in his big coat as if his
long, skinny body would fall apart. He had the fine, intelligent face of a
scholar.</p>

<p>He was the fifth man of Doc Savage's highly trained group, William Harper
Littlejohn. Once he had occupied a chair of applied science in a leading
university of America. But since he had shared the adventures of the great
bronze giant, he had come to be known simply as "Johnny."</p>

<p>Now Johnny said, "In no other locale has there ever been such opalescent
radiation, even in the summer. At that time, the continuous solar suspension
above the horizon produces streams of light from all parts of the periphery
which diffuses vertically over the hemisphere."</p>

<p>"Jolly well put, Mr. Littlejohn!" replied a ruddy-faced man with a drooping
gray mustache. "If I were not feeling so fearfully peckish, I might appreciate
the thought. By jove, it will go tough with these blighters when His Majesty's
navy arrives!"</p>

<p>The man was Sir Arthur Westcott, British member of the abducted war
commission. He had not the slightest idea what Johnny had been talking about.
But he had everlasting faith in the British navy.</p>

<p>Johnny seldom used a short word when he could find a longer one. Just now,
he had been speaking of the effect of the Midnight Sun. In the summer season,
the sun never dropped below the horizon. At this season it did not rise above
the rim.</p>

<p>Yet, where there should have been darkness, relieved only by the northern
lights, the big lifeboat was speeding through daylight of a strange white
quality.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>JOHNNY spoke in simple English the others could understand.</p>

<p>"If only we had some way of getting in touch with Doc Savage," he said,
thoughtfully. "But we had no warning. No time. And now we've got no radio. We
are in a dead world, except for that mysterious monster with the horns. But Doc
Savage would know what to do."</p>

<p>"You seem to have a lot of confidence in this person Doc Savage, old
fellow," said Sir Arthur, pulling at his long mustache. "I would prefer to rely
upon His Majesty's navy. After all, old chap, the British navy goes
everywhere."</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to believe Doc Savage has been places even the British navy
never will see," smiled Johnny.</p>

<p>He thoroughly respected His Majesty's sea force. But Johnny had his doubts
about British warships chasing a mechanical undersea monster into the
treacherous channels and fjords inside the Lofoten Islands.</p>

<p>Johnny's other companions were Baron Calosa, of Italy; Monsieur Lamont, of
France; Herr Schumann, of Germany, and Se&ntilde;or Torron, of Spain.</p>

<p>None had evolved any theory which might have explained the four mysterious
prongs drawing their boat closer to the icy polar region. The prongs might
indeed have been the horns of some underwater monster.</p>

<p>The eerie daylight bathed the blue, icy water. The intense radiation
obscured the customary northern lights, the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>Perhaps a hundred yards ahead of the big lifeboat projected the four prongs.
These cut through the calm sea. No turmoil of whirling propellers was
apparent.</p>

<p>From the bow of the lifeboat extended a slender steel cable. This drew the
boat along at great speed. All instruments with which this cable might have
been cut had been removed. The lifeboat bore the name, "S. S. TRAFALGAR SQUARE,
DOVER, ENG." The steel cable ran down into the sea.</p>

<p>"I'd jolly well like to know if the blighters down there can see us through
those queer eyes?" complained Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>The four prongs traveled a few feet apart in a straight line. The eyes were
like great mirrors. They reflected the strange daylight with dazzling
radiation. This sometimes nearly blinded the eight men in the lifeboat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>GREAT, glittering bergs of ice came floating over the horizon from the
north. This horizon now appeared to be defined by a definite circle of the
daylight.</p>

<p>"If we only could guess what all this means," added Johnny. "Here we are a
war commission bent on ending war. We are bundled out of our berths in the
middle of the night. We don't see the men with the guns, but evidently they
forced every one to leave the Trafalgar Square. Do you suppose the other
lifeboats have been brought up here?"</p>

<p>None of the others had any answer to this.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the projecting prongs were attached to some new and incredible
undersea craft. Yet it never had descended far enough to submerge the rearing
prongs. Johnny was shrewd enough to deduce that these horns and the mirrorlike
eyes had something to do with the motion of the craft.</p>

<p>If there were motors of tremendous power, then why was the progress of the
submarine so noiseless?</p>

<p>Again Sir Arthur Westcott affirmed his faith in the British navy.</p>

<p>"They'll jolly well have a hundred boats searching for us," he declared.
"They'll find us if they have to send out the whole British navy!"</p>

<p>Doubtless the whole British navy would have been turned out if necessary to
rescue the war commission. But just now His Majesty's sailors were having a
puzzle all their own in the North Sea.</p>

<p>Daylight had struck at an unearthly hour. In all of a vast area, every
vessel from fishing trawlers to patrol destroyers had become powerless. On all
of the wide expanse through which the strangely abducted commission had moved,
not another boat was capable of motion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XI. WHEN GUNS FAILED</h2>

<p>HIS MAJESTY'S farthest north submarine was in the vicinity of the Lofoten
Islands. Its presence was by the chance of having been sent to investigate the
drift of ice along the Norwegian coast. The influence of the Gulf Stream to
some extent kept this shore clear of solid freezing.</p>

<p>The commander of the submarine had been exploring the hundred-mile shelf of
the ocean along the northern Norway coast. This shelf, having a depth of five
hundred to six hundred feet, extended for some hundred miles from the
mountainous shore.</p>

<p>The submarine had been cruising on the surface during the night. The craft's
radio had picked up the broadcast of the apparent disaster overtaking the
Trafalgar Square in the English Channel. The commander made note of this.</p>

<p>The Channel crossing between Dover and Calais was too distant to cause
concern to a submarine crew in the vicinity of the Lofoten Islands.</p>

<p>But now, when there should be only the dark sea above, the surface had taken
on the glowing aspect of daylight. The commander ordered the submerging tanks
pumped out. His Majesty's submarine nosed slowly upward.</p>

<p>The commander himself was at the periscope glass. The slender tube poked
above the calm water.</p>

<p>"Well, by jove!" he exclaimed. "I'm seeing things! That could not possibly
be a lifeboat sailing along like that under its own steam! Crickety! Have a
look, lieutenant! It's a boat from the steamer Trafalgar Square!"</p>

<p>"You're jolly well right, sir!" exclaimed the lieutenant. Then he muttered
darkly, "But I do not believe in sea serpents, and if those are not the horns
of some monsters, I'm crazy!"</p>

<p>The commander rapped out a hurried order. The submarine tanks hissed. The
undersea craft was coming up.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"MAYBE you're right, after all, Sir Arthur," said Johnny. "His Majesty's
navy does seem to get around."</p>

<p>He was forced to speak loudly because of the whistling wind. Sir Arthur
exclaimed jubilantly and tugged at his mustache. The periscope of the submarine
had come into view.</p>

<p>The submarine was moving at good speed.</p>

<p>"Britannia still rules the waves, old chap!" said Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>The towing prongs with their flashing mirrors had suddenly lessened their
speed. The moving periscope was possibly less than one hundred yards away. The
submarine did not seem to have had its power affected as had surface craft.</p>

<p>Johnny and those in the lifeboat had no means of knowing of the suspension
of power. If they had, they would not have been so confident that help had
arrived.</p>

<p>Those operating the craft of the four mysterious prongs apparently had known
of the submarine's approach. The speed of the prongs lessened to about the same
movements as the British boat.</p>

<p>"Good grief!" exploded Johnny. "You don't suppose our friends are planning
to fight?"</p>

<p>"The blighters will be handled expeditiously," assured Sir Arthur. "They are
under His Majesty's guns."</p>

<p>The submarine was taking the surface. It headed directly for the lifeboat.
The long black hull was only a hundred yards or so away when it broke the
water. The conning tower thrust its round shape into view. The submarine
reversed its engines. The propellers sucked in tons of water.</p>

<p>Machinery clanked. The hatch of the conning tower was opening. Gilt-braided
officers came onto the iron-back deck.</p>

<p>Again the mirrored prongs moved more rapidly. They started pulling the
lifeboat away from the submarine.</p>

<p>"Heave to, in the name of His Majesty!" bellowed a British voice from the
submarine.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE prongs started in a tantalizing circle of the British sub.</p>

<p>Another sharp order was barked. It gained no attention.</p>

<p>Then a rapid-firing deck gun swung from the conning tower. The submarine
still was moving slowly. Its motors had not yet felt the effect of the
mysterious power which seemed to accompany the eerie daylight.</p>

<p>The sub's deck gun barked viciously. The shot skipped across the green
water. Whether by accident or intention, the shell clipped squarely into one of
the moving prongs. The horn snapped off. Its mirror reflector vanished into the
sea.</p>

<p>Instantly, the other three prongs moved faster.</p>

<p>Johnny had no long words now.</p>

<p>"My gosh!" he exploded. "They shoot off its horns, and still it doesn't
stop! Look! What's happened?"</p>

<p>There was apparent consternation aboard the British sub. The officers were
waving their arms. Voices shouted. The submarine had ceased to move. Its
engines had been suddenly paralyzed.</p>

<p>"I wonder about that!" muttered Johnny. "That sub seemed all right until it
came up. Remember, the engines of the Trafalgar Square were stopped suddenly,
just before they grabbed us?"</p>

<p>The submarine commander was barking more orders. Apparently, he had the
thought to close the hatch of the conning tower. But the motor operating the
machinery was also dead.</p>

<p>"And that apparently washes up your British navy," declared Johnny. "Now
what?"</p>

<p>From under the submarine emerged a slender, fishlike shape. It was a long,
deadly torpedo. The quick-witted commander had ordered the explosive in an
effort to halt the strange prongs.</p>

<p>The torpedo had been shot from its compartment deep under the water. Its own
motive power sent it streaking across between the lifeboat and the mirrored
prongs.</p>

<p>"Get set!" yelled Johnny. "We're all due for a cold bath! When that thing
hits, we'll have to jump!"</p>

<p>The torpedo was perhaps halfway from the sub to the three moving prongs.
Johnny wondered if it were traveling at a depth sufficient to strike the
mystery craft. Then he ceased to wonder.</p>

<p>The torpedo seemed to expire like a fish suddenly harpooned. It floated to
the surface without forward motion. It became very much of a dud. The strange
power of this daylight in The Land of the Midnight Sun had killed the torpedo
motor.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THERE was no explosion. An effort to release another torpedo from the
British sub failed. Orders were barked. From the waving of arms, it was
indicated the commander wished to submerge immediately. Perhaps he imagined his
disabled engines could work underwater.</p>

<p>But there was no clanking of machinery. The conning tower hatch remained
open. The British sub floated as helplessly as the dead torpedo.</p>

<p>The three pronged mirrors were speeding up. The lifeboat resumed its
northern course at a fast pace.</p>

<p>And the war commission of six great nations was again on its way to an
undetermined destination.</p>

<p>"Anyway," declared Johnny, "I'm now sure of one thing. This whole incredible
happening has been too big for Doc Savage to miss. We'll be hearing from
him."</p>

<p>Johnny was partly correct. Doc Savage's plane was not far away. But it would
be some time before this would be of any help to Johnny and his companions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XII. NEW SKY POWER</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE'S plane motors were probably the most noiseless of any in the
world skies. The big cabin ship was being held at an altitude of only a
thousand feet above the shifting surface of the North Sea.</p>

<p>Though it was night, Doc Savage was scanning the ocean intently. Every wave
crest and every floating object was clearly revealed. Yet no visible light
projected from the plane toward the dark water.</p>

<p>Doc was wearing a pair of oversize goggles with complex lenses. From under
the plane shot an invisible beam, which spread over a wide area. In the radius
of this beam everything became outlined in stark black and white, much like a
motion picture.</p>

<p>The beam was an infra-red ray. The goggles worn by Doc and his four
companions made the beam serve as a great light.</p>

<p>"We're on another blind spot," announced Long Tom from the radio, which he
was handling. "And, Doc, this location doesn't seem to check with the position
we fixed back in New York. Anyway, the dead area seems to be in motion."</p>

<p>The radio reception was highly static. Yet it picked up stuttering
reports.</p>

<p>From Washington came, "Still no word has been received of the missing war
commission."</p>

<p>From London more exciting news was being broadcast.</p>

<p>"Warning to all ships--strange disturbance in North Sea--many boats
disabled--queer light has appeared--"</p>

<p>Then came an extra flash.</p>

<p>One of His Majesty's submarines was unreported in the Far North, in the
vicinity of the Lofoten Islands.</p>

<p>"Doc," exclaimed Monk, "isn't that where we're headed?"</p>

<p>"That would seem to be our immediate destination," stated Doc. "The other
report is not surprising. Our radio blind spot is in that vicinity."</p>

<p>"This daylight thing they're reporting, Doc?" questioned Ham. "After what
happened to us in Maryland, suppose the same thing smashes us down away up
here? Then what do we do?"</p>

<p>Doc merely smiled and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Ham, you're gettin' to be as big a calamity howler as Monk!" grumbled
Renny.</p>

<p>Doc's companions had been intensely curious concerning the immense
glass-like cylinder aboard the plane. But Doc had explained nothing of its
purpose.</p>

<p>Suddenly Doc sighted a drifting ship. It showed like a silent, ghostly
silhouette in the infra-red beam.</p>

<p>"We have reached the Trafalgar Square," Doc announced. "The steamer has been
wrecked on the rocks."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE abandoned Trafalgar Square was solidly wedged in the rocks of the
forbidding coast. Its bow plates had been crumpled.</p>

<p>Doc brought the plane to a smooth landing close to the ship. It became
necessary to use one of the rubber pontoon boats to reach the vessel. Monk was
dragging the pig along.</p>

<p>When they reached the high side of the ghostly steamer on the rocks, Habeas
Corpus stiffened. He resisted Monk's effort to drag him aboard.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it, Doc!" exclaimed Monk. "I don't like this! That pig knows
something's screwy about all this!"</p>

<p>Doc was carrying a square, black box with a lens that looked like black
glass. This was a fluoroscope. The man of bronze walked along the tilted side
deck of the Trafalgar Square. He passed the lens of the box along various
stateroom windows.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a curious blue glowing on one window pane. Words leaped
into view.</p>

<p>"I hoped Johnny might find time to leave some message," said Doc.</p>

<p>But the words furnished little information:</p>

<p>Doc, if you see this, the war commission is being taken into a lifeboat by
armed men--our engines stopped--all of the crew and passengers are taking to
the boats--</p>

<p>This was all. The message had been written with a chalky substance that
fluoresced under the ultra-violet ray, sometimes called "black light."</p>

<p>Doc led the way to the big engine room. There was no sign of life about the
passenger steamer. Nor was there evidence of violence.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC wasted no further time aboard the Trafalgar Square. The passenger
steamer was doomed to break up on the rocks with the first storm.</p>

<p>The tri-motored plane headed again into the north. Almost immediately, the
radio sputtered and ceased functioning. The stark, rocky-headed coast of Norway
was picked up. Doc Savage set the controls immediately to gain altitude.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing, Doc!" exclaimed Ham. "Only this time it's coming out
of the north! This isn't such a hot spot to be forced down!"</p>

<p>"Into all of your heaviest stuff," instructed Doc. "We are approaching what
I had feared. See that you have all of our equipment. We have many other things
already aboard."</p>

<p>These final words were somewhat of a mystery.</p>

<p>But the swiftly increasing dawn in the north was no mystery to Ham and Monk.
It was the same white daylight they had witnessed off the Maryland coast. Only
the plane was headed directly into the area, and this dawn seemed to be
arriving more swiftly.</p>

<p>The motors labored in the higher altitude. Doc opened a switch. There was a
slight hissing from the sides of the cabin. The ventilators had been tightly
closed. Oxygen was now filling the cabin. It was necessary at this great
height.</p>

<p>Then from the night around the plane came the steady humming of power.
Motors droned in the sky. It was as if unknown ships of the stratosphere were
thundering down to intercept their own plane.</p>

<p>"Planes!" boomed Renny. "An' listen to them motors! Boy! They sound like
thunder itself!"</p>

<p>"There are only three planes," Doc announced. "They are tri-motored like our
own plane, but they have a different sound from any I have ever heard."</p>

<p>Apparently the pilots of the three mysterious planes at this unusual
altitude had no intention of intercepting Doc Savage's ship. Or perhaps they
had missed it altogether in the darkness.</p>

<p>Slowly, the thunder of the strange motors died away.</p>

<p>"Well," breathed Long Tom, "I guess we're out of that one, all right! Now I
wonder--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE electrician did not complete his question.</p>

<p>With the suddenness of a bursting Very flare, daylight struck the sky. It
was an enveloping whiteness that gathered the tri-motored plane into its band
of illumination.</p>

<p>The big trio of motors were instantly silenced. Possibly six miles above the
earth, Doc Savage's plane had lost all power.</p>

<p>"Be prepared to leave quickly, when we land," advised Doc, as calmly as if
they were about to alight from some automobile on land. "Have everything ready.
We may have little time."</p>

<p>That mysterious northern light was not the aurora borealis. Yet it
illuminated all of the bleak, hard coast in infinite detail. Back from the
inlet of the ocean stretched the great plateau of Norway.</p>

<p>Closer to the ocean, wide glaciers moved inexorably down upon the scores of
fjords to be seen from this great height. Some of these sea channels extended
for many miles inland.</p>

<p>This land now was intensely cold. The insulated walls of the big plane
excluded the chill. But the temperature ranged far below the zero mark. The
wisdom of Doc Savage in ordering Arctic outfits was proved.</p>

<p>"Habeas Corpus won't like this," complained Monk. "I oughta got him some
blinkers. He'll get snow blindness."</p>

<p>"And if he gets some kind of permanent blindness, it will be perfectly all
right with me," retorted Ham, ironically.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was gliding as slowly as possibly with the weighted plane.</p>

<p>"Look, comrades!" he directed. "Those blue shadows over there are the
Lofoten Islands. One of those is Moskenes Island. That is what Hjalmar Landson
spoke of just before he died."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>BETWEEN the blue shadows and the mainland was an expanse of smooth, green
water. At different points, three dark blots seemed to be motionless.</p>

<p>Doc's keen eyes saw more than those of his companions.</p>

<p>"Fishing boats and they are powerless," he said. "Two of the crews have
rigged up crude sails. They are making for shore and there must be a
village."</p>

<p>Between two ice walls near a fjord appeared a dark spot. Smoke eddied
upward.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are in luck," stated Doc. "Anyway, that is a Norwegian or
Laplander fishing village. These folk are usually friendly."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "I hope they're friendly! This would be a tough
spot to be on our own!"</p>

<p>They were to discover these simple fishermen were not friendly. The welcome
signs had been taken off this particular village.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. THE FACE OF A WOMAN</h2>

<p>PERHAPS there were other fliers who could have made that landing on the icy
sea. But few indeed could have set the loaded plane on that green surface
without either dragging off the tail assembly or nosing over.</p>

<p>Doc Savage slid the pontoons onto the surface as if they were greased. The
plane settled deeply, but remained upright.</p>

<p>Against the strange daylight, the mountains of the coast bulked like huge,
blue cathedrals. Glaciers filled the valleys.</p>

<p>As the plane settled, Doc's men poured out onto the wings.</p>

<p>"It won't be much of a job to get ashore here in the rubber boats,"
commented Long Tom. "We can make several trips and take off what supplies we
may need."</p>

<p>Doc Savage stood outlined against the fuselage. He was looking into the
north. Up there, the area of daylight seemed to be banked solidly against a
black curtain. For a few seconds the other four men heard the bronze man's
weird trilling note.</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus was standing on the wing of the plane. His body had become
rigid. His long nose pointed northward.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" advised Monk. "The pig smells something!"</p>

<p>"I might suggest you move away from him," grated Ham. Clearly the pig was
scared. Then Doc turned quickly.</p>

<p>"I've been afraid of that all the time," he remarked. "This haunted ocean
has two-way power. Force to disable and another force to supply motor
energy."</p>

<p>The bronze man's meaning became all too apparent.</p>

<p>Out of that black curtain to the northward flashed three objects. From
specks, they speedily took on the shape of speeding planes.</p>

<p>And they approached with flashing speed. They must have been hitting three
hundred miles an hour. For they were directly above the plane floating on the
sea almost before Doc's men had started to move.</p>

<p>"It would be just as well to stay outside until they pass over," advised
Doc. "The results would be the same."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>HIS judgment was quickly proved. The three planes were flying low. They
passed over at a height of barely one hundred feet.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" grunted Renny. "Doc, did you notice? All you can hear is the
wind of their props! Their motors aren't makin' any noise at all!"</p>

<p>"That made itself quite evident," stated Doc. "But when they passed us in
the night up above, their motors were noisy enough. I would suggest they are
not now flying with the same motors."</p>

<p>Monk was dancing around on the wing. His short legs and long arms made him
look surprisingly like an excited chimpanzee.</p>

<p>"It was her, Doc! That red-headed dame!" Monk was shouting. "An' I thought
maybe she was O.K.! But she's in one of them planes! I saw her face an' her red
hair!"</p>

<p>"He's right," drawled Long Tom. "And that fellow Kama was in the same plane.
They were looking down. Doc, we've been trailed all the way across the
Atlantic."</p>

<p>"So I surmised," said Doc, calmly. "Yes, it was red-headed Lora Krants and
that fellow who says he came from San Tao. Now get inside. They'll be coming
back."</p>

<p>Only the two faces had been observed in the flashing planes. It could only
be guessed who the other occupants of the ships might be.</p>

<p>The three planes vanished quickly to the southward. But they were not absent
long.</p>

<p>Doc and his men were back inside the cabin. The man of bronze pulled levers
at the end of the big glasslike cylinder. A tight-fitting cover slid smoothly
open. Inside there was only room for a few persons.</p>

<p>"We'll wait for a moment," advised Doc. "But be prepared to get in quickly.
We are about to be attacked."</p>

<p>Almost immediately, the three planes again whispered in the sky. They were
flying back over their course. This time they had lifted a few hundred feet.
Long Tom and Renny already were squeezing into the close spaces inside the
glasslike cylinder.</p>

<p>"But what is the thing, Doc?" said Ham. "You don't mean--That won't go under
the water, will it?"</p>

<p>"That is the purpose for which it was designed," stated Doc, calmly. "It may
accomplish more than just going under the water."</p>

<p>The three planes again passed over.</p>

<p>"I noticed something funny, Doc," said Ham. "Those planes didn't have any
shadows when they passed the first time."</p>

<p>"Without direct light from above, shadows could not be expected," stated
Doc.</p>

<p>Ham shivered, then said quickly, "One of 'em's banking, Doc. It's coming
back!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ONE of the swift planes of mysterious power had separated from the others.
Directly over the floating Doc Savage ship, it tipped its wings in a descending
spiral.</p>

<p>Doc and his men did not see the shining object flash toward the water. By
sheer luck, the aim of the pilot was poor.</p>

<p>The object struck more than fifty yards from Doc's plane. The erupting
explosion geysered tons of water. A huge wave threatened to wreck the
pontoons.</p>

<p>"Inside, all of you!" ordered Doc. "He will probably have his distance
better gauged the next time."</p>

<p>The glasslike cylinder provided just enough room for the five men and little
more. They were surrounded by a variety of metallic tanks.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" growled Renny. "It's going to be plenty dark!"</p>

<p>Doc said nothing. He ran his hand along a panel. This uncovered long tubes.
The tubes suddenly glowed with a weird blue light. The emanation was
phosphorescent in character. It provided illumination.</p>

<p>Doc did not say what chemicals had been employed. It was apparent the
lighting system did not depend on electrical current.</p>

<p>The entrance lid of the big cylinder slid into place. Doc turned some knobs
and a slow hissing came from some of the tanks. Oxygen was being slowly
released.</p>

<p>"Now if we only had some power, we'd being going places," said Ham. "I
suppose our next stop will be the bottom. And the shelf along this coast, they
say, is nearly six hundred feet deep!"</p>

<p>The faith of Doc's companions assured them that the contrivance they now
occupied probably had been provided with everything. Everything, but power,
they imagined.</p>

<p>Habeas Corpus grunted. His long nose poked into Ham's neck. Ham made a move
as to withdraw his sword cane.</p>

<p>"You get that crossed-up quadruped out of my neck," he yelled, "or I'm
slicing off one of his ears!"</p>

<p>Monk only grinned and grunted. The floor of the cabin sagged and tilted. One
of the pontoons had been cracked by the exploding bomb. The three planes still
whispered above them.</p>

<p>"Probably the next one will be better directed," stated Doc. "I think it is
time we are leaving."</p>

<p>There was a grinding noise. The floor of the cabin seemed to dissolve under
the big cylinder. It dropped by its own weight into the green water. Hardly had
it submerged under the floating plane before concussion threatened to cave in
its glasslike sides.</p>

<p>The second bomb above had made a direct hit. Doc Savage's ship had been
destroyed with a blast that scattered its parts. No person could then have been
in the cabin and remained alive.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IN one of the planes overhead, a man's voice spoke.</p>

<p>"The great Doc Savage is finished!" he said, venomously. "His knowledge was
the only thing in the world we had to fear. If he had been given time, he would
have got to the bottom of the mystery."</p>

<p>"Dot iss goot!" spoke a voice with a broad accent. "Ven do ve haff der price
to puy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the sale still rests on the figures of the highest bidder," said
the other voice. "No nation has a treasury too big to risk all of it for this
power. A few men alone could control the world."</p>

<p>"Dot is vot makes der vun man to slit anoder man's throat," suggested the
other voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the throat-slitting will be well taken care of," said the first
man. "Any nation will buy. Which one, will be for me to decide. We no longer
have Doc Savage to fear."</p>

<p>The three mystery planes streamed again into single line. In one of these
planes sat Lora Krants, the red-headed young woman. She was staring at the
green sea as they passed over where Doc Savage's plane had rested.</p>

<p>Nothing of the metal ship still floated. But all about was a multi-colored
rainbow spread of oil.</p>

<p>"He is gone," the girl whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the end of Doc Savage," said the dark-browed young man beside
her.</p>

<p>A yellow-skinned man showed his flashing teeth.</p>

<p>"Those who tamper with the will of the infinite invite their own
destruction," he remarked, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Apparently, the man called Kama was not grievously affected by the evidence
of Doc Savage's swift and gruesome death.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THOUGH crowded into the compact space of the cylinder, Doc's crew was
comfortable. For several minutes, the cylinder remained suspended like a toy
balloon floating in air. The last bit of the wrecked plane had slowly sifted
toward the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Now the cylinder started sinking again. It reached a depth where the
pressure must have been terrific. But the material of which the strange diving
affair was constructed was capable of resisting.</p>

<p>"This feels like being in a coffin," complained Renny. "Doc, this makes some
hide-out, but it seems to be a little too good."</p>

<p>Doc Savage smiled and said nothing. His bronze hands were busy.</p>

<p>"It is advisable to wait a little while," stated Doc. "We are in conflict
with more than one clever brain. Many nations are in the market for this white
light of the haunted ocean. It is a power that would make the smallest of
countries absolute."</p>

<p>The man of bronze was waiting until he was convinced the men in the three
planes could not possibly suspect his men and himself had survived.</p>

<p>Now Doc moved a small lever. To his companions' amazement, the cylinder was
instantly filled with the throb of power. A small control steered the craft.
Close to the murky bottom of the ice-cold sea, the cylinder moved like a great
fish seeking for food.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exploded Renny. "What a submarine! Now maybe we can go places!
Have you discovered the power that kept those planes in the air, Doc?"</p>

<p>The bronze man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall find that out later," he said. "For the present, we are
moving by the release of compressed air."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. A HOT RECEPTION</h2>

<p>HABEAS CORPUS didn't like his close quarters. Even in the face of deadly
danger, Ham had discovered a means of annoying Monk. When the fur-clad pig
squeezed too close to Ham, the lawyer jabbed the point of his signet-ring knife
into the animal's tough hide.</p>

<p>The pig grunted. Monk swore at Ham. The fur on the pig was not intended for
inside wear. The Arabian misfit became most malodorous.</p>

<p>The cylinder might have been moving toward the shore.</p>

<p>"If we have to break out of this thing down here, we'll be pulverized," said
Ham. "It isn't big enough to have submerging tanks, so we can't expel any water
to rise to the surface."</p>

<p>This was somewhat of a grisly thought to the others. The oxygen in the tanks
could not last forever. The time during which they could breathe was now being
reduced to minutes.</p>

<p>Doc Savage made no reply. From flat alloy containers, he was pouring three
powdered chemicals into an odd-shaped retort. A tube extended from this vessel
into the side of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The cylinder had been constructed with a double wall. Between the skins was
considerable space. This space had been made a vacuum.</p>

<p>The envelope of the cylinder was filling. The contrivance was being given
buoyancy. The cylinder started toward the surface.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exclaimed Renny. "Now we're all set! That gang run by the
red-headed dame believes we're dead! Doc, we can land at that fishing village!
It won't be any trick at all to find out about this haunted ocean stuff!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE was watching a small compass. The rocks of the shore loomed under
water like a black wall. The man of bronze set a course along these rocks. Soon
the cylinder was nosing into a fjord.</p>

<p>"Your idea is not bad, Renny," said Doc. "But I have a feeling our
appearance may prove somewhat of a shock to these fishermen. That will be
especially true if they are Laplanders."</p>

<p>A sandy spit projected between two bulking rocks. At its end was a small
wharf. The glass cylinder was only a few yards under the surface. A queer
figure stood at the end of the little wharf. His garb was that of some shaggy
animal. The skins had been sun-cured with the fur on.</p>

<p>The man's face was furrowed by weather and sun. Beady, black eyes were
peering down into the water. The man emitted a yell. He shouted two words. Then
he caught up a long-handled walrus harpoon and hurled it downward.</p>

<p>The words were in the Laplander tongue. "Sea devil!"</p>

<p>The point of the harpoon bumped the cylinder. Doc and the others saw the
weapon flash downward.</p>

<p>"You said they were a very primitive people, Doc," remarked Ham. "I have a
feeling our arrival is inauspicious."</p>

<p>"More than possibly there will be some misunderstanding," said Doc Savage.
"Have your weapons ready, but don't use them unless compelled to do so."</p>

<p>Monk, Long Tom and Renny were armed with their super-firing pistols. These
weapons had huge drums loaded with mercy bullets. Doc Savage and his men did
not kill unless it was absolutely unavoidable. The bullets in these queer guns
would render men unconscious.</p>

<p>The cylinder's nose was pushed into the frozen sand. Doc snapped open the
door. He was the first to slide out. Before the others could emerge, the air
was filled with angry, frightened shouting.</p>

<p>Doc Savage understood the tongue of the Northland. So did Ham. From a score
of places in the rocks came the booming of guns. Harpoons and spears hurtled
toward them. Lesser crackling explosions were the more dangerous.</p>

<p>The booming weapons were old-fashioned, muzzle-loading guns of the type used
for shooting birds with small shot. The others were rifles.</p>

<p>The shouts were repeated.</p>

<p>"Kill the devils of the sea!" they meant. "Kill the devils of the sea! They
make dead men float!"</p>

<p>This last was a remarkably queer statement.</p>

<p>Doc and Ham slid to the temporary cover of a big rock. Renny, Monk and Long
Tom found another rock. The pig, Habeas Corpus, had been plastered with fine
shot. He let out an unearthly squeal.</p>

<p>Perhaps a hundred fur-clad figures showed among the rocks of the shore.
Behind them was a circle of huts, made of skins stretched on poles. Thick,
greasy smoke poured from vents in the top of these.</p>

<p>Shooting stopped for a few seconds. One strange figure in skins was pointing
at Habeas Corpus. His words were, "Spawn of the sea devil! Kill! Kill!"</p>

<p>It looked bad for Habeas Corpus. The pig stood shivering. The heavy haft of
a harpoon struck the apelike Monk across the forehead. He fell down and rolled
into cover. For a minute, the chemist was stunned.</p>

<p>There seemed no hope for the trembling hog. The pig's big ears waved.</p>

<p>"That miserable pig's my own personal meat! I've been saving him!" asserted
Ham, suddenly. Two squat Laplanders were rushing upon Habeas Corpus. They held
long harpoons. The slender figure of Ham moved with incredible speed. There was
a whirling gleam of steel.</p>

<p>"You come asking for it!" yelled Ham.</p>

<p>The Laplanders turned their harpoons upon him. The fighting lawyer was
between the weapons. His sword moved too fast to be followed. Its needlelike
point flicked through the fur of one man. A harpoon struck the rocks.</p>

<p>The Laplander only grunted once. Then he apparently went to sleep. The other
harpoon struck sidewise and knocked Ham to his knees. His sword point jabbed
the fur-clad wrist of the wielder. This Laplander, too, dropped on his
face.</p>

<p>With an expression of utter loathing on his ascetic face, Ham grabbed one of
the pig's long ears. Shot whistled around him as he dragged the hog to
safety.</p>

<p>Though some of the villagers looked grotesquely small, others were of giant
size. In their skin clothes, they looked like the real Vikings of a past
century.</p>

<p>Doc arose and began speaking in their own language.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XV. HOODOO OF THE SEA</h2>

<p>"WE come in peace," stated Doc Savage. "You have had some trouble. For that,
you have united."</p>

<p>The man of bronze had quickly analyzed an unusual situation. Some of the men
of this queer village were the dark, squat Lapps. Others were the huskier,
blond Norwegians.</p>

<p>Only some common danger could have drawn them together. They were of
different speech, habits, dress and thought. Even now, a commanding figure was
stepping into view.</p>

<p>Doc had spoken in the Norwegian language.</p>

<p>"Vaer god! Vaer god!" The commanding figure shouted to the Lapps and his own
fellow Norwegians.</p>

<p>The words meant simply, "Be good!" This tall leader was open to argument.
The Lapps were the more numerous. They did not heed.</p>

<p>"Na! Na! Na!" some shouted.</p>

<p>Another rain of harpoons showered from among the rocks. Guns exploded. Some
poorly aimed shot blasted the face of the Norwegian leader. Blood flowed from
his torn cheek.</p>

<p>Perhaps others imagined the wound had been inflicted by Doc's men. A
strange, small figure appeared on a rock. He was as small as a half-grown boy.
But white locks of matted hair framed his diminutive, wrinkled face.</p>

<p>Doc Savage instantly identified him as a jarl, one of the sub-chiefs of the
coastal clan.</p>

<p>"Na! Na! Na!" this old man shrilled, joining the angry Lapps.</p>

<p>Again were uttered the words meaning "sea devils."</p>

<p>The man of bronze was forced to drop behind a rock. Plainly the fishermen
had been terrorized.</p>

<p>Lapps and Norwegians jabbered. Their eyes were fixed in fear upon the
glasslike cylinder.</p>

<p>Doc Savage knew the many legends of the Edda. Norwegian fishermen were a
superstitious lot. The Lapps perhaps were worse. They believed in huldrefok,
evil fairies of the fjords.</p>

<p>Recalling these legends, Doc Savage realized the fishermen would not feel
safe unless they exterminated these men they believed to be sea devils.</p>

<p>Doc spoke to his companions in ancient Mayan.</p>

<p>"Do not kill any of these people under any circumstances," said the bronze
man. "They are harmless, but greatly frightened."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" yelped Monk. "We won't last long unless we do
something!"</p>

<p>Steel-headed harpoons clanged on the rocks. Shotguns continued blasting.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>AGAIN the bronze man spoke quickly in Mayan. Then he sprang from behind the
rock. With a striding glide, he was close to the nearest group of
fishermen.</p>

<p>From his garments, Doc flipped four of the usually effective anaesthetic
capsules. The fragile glass tinkled on the rocks. The nearest Lapps subsided in
grotesque heaps of furs.</p>

<p>But the winter air was clear and cold. A chill wind swept by. Lapps and
Norwegians rushed upon the bronze man. The gas capsules were not effective over
enough area.</p>

<p>For several seconds, the Lapps armed with harpoons must have imagined they
had been struck by a cyclone. Doc narrowly escaped being impaled. But his
bronzed fists were moving too fast for the eye to follow.</p>

<p>Fishermen armed with harpoons tumbled and groaned.</p>

<p>The point of a harpoon caught Doc's right arm. That whirled him from his
feet. Half a dozen weapons were aimed at his body. He was for the moment
helpless to ward these off.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" thundered Renny. "Let 'em have it!"</p>

<p>There arose a deep humming like giant bullfiddles. The superfirers streamed
mercy bullets from the hands of Renny, Monk and Long Tom.</p>

<p>Fishermen were piled in a heap around Doc Savage. Doc's men rushed out. Warm
liquid gushed from Doc's wounded arm and dripped from his fingers.</p>

<p>There were too many fishermen scattered about to be reached by the mercy
bullets. Doc and his men were in one of the tightest spots of their career.</p>

<p>The haft of a heavy harpoon cracked Renny's skull. The big engineer grunted
and fell down. Ham's sword was broken in his hand by the blast of a
shotgun.</p>

<p>Then Doc's men were given respite from an unexpected source.</p>

<p>The uncanny daylight winked out. The eerie illumination was shut off as
abruptly as if some one had pulled a switch. There was no lingering twilight.
Only the shadowy fingers of the aurora borealis beyond the mountain.</p>

<p>Comparatively, the darkness was intense. The fishermen fled into the rocks.
They seemed to fear the shutting off of the inexplicable daylight.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>RENNY was reviving. Doc ordered the others again into shelter. For several
minutes, there was a lull in the attack.</p>

<p>Oil torches flared. What appeared to be a big pot of blazing whale blubber
suddenly rolled into the open space. Against this smoky glare the fishermen
were crouching shadows, waiting.</p>

<p>"We must undertake a bold move," stated Doc. "All will walk into the open
and throw down your weapons. We must end this misunderstanding or we will be
killed by some of the very people we must free."</p>

<p>The surprise of Doc's strategy must have awed the fishermen for the
moment.</p>

<p>Renny and the others walked boldly into the glare of the whale-oil pot. They
threw their superfiring pistols with their drums of bullets in a heap. Ham
contributed the hilt of his broken sword.</p>

<p>Doc Savage himself was not armed with any gun. He believed men who went
armed came to rely too much upon mechanical force and not enough on their own
wits and strength.</p>

<p>Doc walked out with the others. His hands were raised.</p>

<p>"Now shelter yourselves," he admonished the others. The figure of the
shriveled, ancient jarl was outlined by a torch. For several seconds, the
surprised sub-chief did not speak. Doc Savage was striding straight toward the
jarl and the largest group of fishermen.</p>

<p>Then the jarl shrilled out a command.</p>

<p>The bronze giant understood the words. They were an order to kill. Doc kept
his hands uplifted.</p>

<p>From the rocks guns started snarling. Some were rifles that cracked
viciously. Leaden shot and bullets hailed into the space.</p>

<p>Doc Savage held his head in a bowed position to protect his face. Lead
pounded onto his bared bronze head. Bullets whammed into his magnificent
torso.</p>

<p>But the bronze man's pace was unaltered. He must have seemed to the simple,
superstitious fishermen like a real devil, or a god of the sea. He was
impervious to their bullets.</p>

<p>Doc's body was sheathed in bullet-proof garments of finest chain mesh. This
extended to his knees under his other clothing.</p>

<p>The bronze hair in view was on the outside of a skullcap of thin, but
impenetrable metal alloy. The leaden bullets and fine shot flattened on this
surface.</p>

<p>It was terrifying. This immense bronze giant walking toward them. One charge
of shot blasted from an old-fashioned gun. All of it splattered squarely into
Doc's breast. Yet he neither faltered nor staggered.</p>

<p>This was a little too much for the nerves of the Lapps. They began
squawking. It sounded like, "Wha! Wha! Wha!"</p>

<p>Doc knew this signified one of their spirits of the Skager-Rack. The
Skager-Rack was the devilish turmoil of tides between the North Sea and the
Baltic Sea. Because this claimed so many victims, the Lapps had peopled it with
their own conception of a devil.</p>

<p>The fishermen were throwing down their weapons. The ancient jarl shrilled
commands without effect.</p>

<p>It seemed for the moment as if the bronze man would be able to parley.</p>

<p>But a harpoon whistled from a high rock. A retreating Norwegian had hurled
it as he fled. It was a walrus harpoon and heavy. Unfortunately, it struck with
violent impact across the bone of Doc's leg below the knee.</p>

<p>Doc was thrown off balance and he fell.</p>

<p>Cries of fear immediately changed into yells of menace. Lapps and Norwegians
united in a rush. Doc was crushed to the ground. He made no resistance.</p>

<p>"Let yourselves be taken," he instructed his companions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE bronze man permitted thongs of walrus skin and reindeer hide to be
wrapped about his limbs.</p>

<p>The bronze man's companions were similarly bound. The fishermen apparently
had changed their minds about an immediate killing.</p>

<p>Outside the edge of the whale-oil flare had arisen another commotion. Many
of the fishermen were rushing down to the shore of the fjord. Their oil torches
flared across the blue water beyond the glass cylinder.</p>

<p>"They're about to put our new submarine out of business," said Ham. "It
doesn't look so cheering."</p>

<p>Doc and the others were now lying on the ground near the whale-oil pot. They
could see the smooth surface of the fjord.</p>

<p>"Another matter may be to our advantage, temporarily," stated Doc. "I heard
them speak of dead men floating. It seems a dead man has come to our
rescue."</p>

<p>The others now could see the body in the fjord. It was a floating man. The
figure was not half submerged, as a drowned man might be. Instead, the body
floated high on the surface.</p>

<p>The dead man appeared to be buoyant, as if made of cork.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. SATAN'S GATEWAY CURSE</h2>

<p>ROUGH hands bore Doc Savage and his men toward a building of outlandish
appearance. The structure was blackened. It appeared to be very ancient.</p>

<p>"Looks like a place that might be inhabited by some of the devils they've
been talking about," grunted Ham.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," advised Doc, "it's the reverse of that. It is one of the
oldest of churches, called a stavekirker."</p>

<p>The building was without windows. It jutted into many square towers and
sharp gables. On the gables were the blackened prows of ships that had been
wrecked.</p>

<p>The faces of the towers were carved with legendary figures.</p>

<p>The structure was composed of heavy timbers. There was only one massive
door.</p>

<p>Inside was a nave, a shrine and a single broad aisle.</p>

<p>Their captors dumped Doc and the others unceremoniously on the floor of
earth. All but two armed Lapps rushed out again. The excitement indicated the
arrival of the floating dead man was of greater importance for the moment than
the prisoners.</p>

<p>Doc and his men were left to themselves. Two voices were disputing loudly
near by. They were speaking in a queer conglomeration of languages.
Occasionally, they said something in broken English.</p>

<p>Doc disregarded these for the moment.</p>

<p>"All of us saw the phenomenon of the dead man floating in the fjord," the
bronze giant stated. "Brothers, it is not remarkable these people have been
frightened to killing terror. Dead men do not arise to the surface in these
ice-cold waters for many days, often weeks. Then they are not perfectly
preserved, as was that corpse."</p>

<p>"Do you think it has something to do with the haunted ocean?" said Ham.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," declared Doc. "I believe we are close to the source of
this power. Floating dead men would be an effective means of driving curious
fishermen away."</p>

<p>The quarreling voices beyond the wooden bench were silent for a few seconds.
Then one spoke in broken English.</p>

<p>"Amerikaner!" it exclaimed. "You haff also put yourselves into dis
trap!"</p>

<p>Two men rolled into view. They were bound with strips of hide.</p>

<p>"Zarkov," stated Doc, instantly. "And Larrone. The haunt of the ocean seems
to be a magnet for many parts of the world."</p>

<p>"Doc Savage!" exclaimed the bearded little man called Zarkov. "So you haff
come here also! But you would not haff come for buying, maybe?"</p>

<p>Larrone spoke in good English, but with an angry snarl.</p>

<p>"It is not so that Doc Savage would buy anything!" he said with disgust. "If
he has his way, none will buy!"</p>

<p>"By that, I infer you have come for the purpose of purchasing this power,"
stated Doc. "I recall both of you were once detained in my country for
attempting to purloin some secret of the navy. By the way, those secrets were
those of Arne Dass, the aged scientist, who has disappeared. Perhaps you would
know something of Arne Dass?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the pair met briefly.</p>

<p>"We know nothing of this Arne Dass," said Larrone. "We are engaged in a
legitimate mission."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of that, from your point of view," stated Doc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE man of bronze desired more information.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could inform us about what these fisherman seem to fear so
greatly?" he suggested. "Before you were taken prisoners, did you know of these
floating dead men?"</p>

<p>Zarkov explained quickly.</p>

<p>For several weeks, fishermen on the coast had been dying mysteriously. Only
the week before, a fishing boat had entered the fjord known as Satan's Gateway.
This fjord was one of those below the great Jostedalsbrae glacier.</p>

<p>This was the greatest live glacier in Europe. For many thousands of years,
its mountainous ice had covered more than three hundred and fifty square miles.
Ages old, parts of the Jostedalsbrae were covered with many feet of ice
dust.</p>

<p>The great, living glacier was forever moving. Its icy arms reached into
gouged-out valleys. It was believed to have hollowed out immense caverns under
the mountains.</p>

<p>Five men had been aboard the fishing sloop which had entered Satan's
Gateway, Zarkov informed Doc Savage. Four of the five men had died mysteriously
before the boat returned.</p>

<p>But the fishing sloop had come back strangely. For the craft had come
floating into this fjord against a rip tide.</p>

<p>One man, said Zarkov, had lived a short time. And he had spoken of men who
went naked. Naked at a temperature of forty to fifty below zero. Men who seemed
impervious to the cold.</p>

<p>And when all of these five men were dead, their bodies had seemed to become
of the lightness of cork.</p>

<p>Since then, a few other fishermen had lost their boats. They returned,
however, without them. Came back floating like lightest wood, high on the
surface.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FROM outside came cries of lamentation among the fishermen.</p>

<p>Now four women entered the stavekirker that was serving as a prison. They
bore wooden platters of food.</p>

<p>It seemed the woman had been sent to feed the prisoners. Doc's men, Zarkov
and Larrone were fed like children. The women were Lapps. Their dark faces had
little expression. They filled their hands with what appeared to be a hard,
black bread and strips of dried codfish.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" grunted Renny. "If this ain't somethin'! How'd they think
we--"</p>

<p>A greasy hand stuffed his open mouth full of the black bread.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" gulped Monk. "Them dames has been sent to choke us to death!
You don't suppose they're feedin' this junk to Habeas Corpus?"</p>

<p>Ham chuckled through a mouthful of tough fish.</p>

<p>"That's the only thought that makes this meal bearable," he asserted.</p>

<p>"An' I hope you choke first, so you'll quit talkin'," chirped Monk.</p>

<p>When the women left, Zarkov declared the fishermen now would send no boats
near Satan's Gateway.</p>

<p>Only the two guards remained at the single doorway. Doc Savage had been
working at the tough rawhide around his arms. But his right arm was wounded.
The hide cut into his flesh.</p>

<p>The interior of the stavekirker was lighted by only two of the smelly
whale-oil torches.</p>

<p>Ham rolled close to Doc.</p>

<p>"If we could get all of these cords cut at once, we might be able to make a
break for it," he suggested. "I can get at all of you, one at a time."</p>

<p>The lawyer worked fast. The large signet ring had not been removed from his
middle finger. From inside it sprang a razor-edged knife blade. With this he
worked first on the thongs around Doc's wrists and ankles. When he had
finished, the hide was cut almost through.</p>

<p>Ham went to work on the others. Renny's bonds were cut to the point where he
could have heaved himself loose.</p>

<p>But none were then to go free. Wails arose outside.</p>

<p>"Knut Aage! Knut Aage! Awai! Awai!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"HOWLIN' calamities!" squealed Monk. "Now it's something else! Sounds like a
funeral!"</p>

<p>"Knut Aage!" said Zarkov. "He is the one big man of these fishermen. We
heard he was going alone to investigate this Satan's Gateway."</p>

<p>"Holy cow, Doc!" boomed Renny. "I remember! Knut Aage! That's the name that
fellow Hjalmar Landson spoke just before he died!"</p>

<p>"That is true," said Doc. "Then perhaps Hjalmar Landson came from this
place."</p>

<p>The two guards rushed outside. Doc started to free his hands. A rush of feet
thudded over the rocks.</p>

<p>"This Knut Aage is the brother of that skinny little old man they call the
jarl," volunteered Zarkov. "I'll bet he's come floating back."</p>

<p>The ancient jarl led the men entering the stavekirker.</p>

<p>"Don't let it appear we might free ourselves," Doc advised.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squealed Monk. "Wouldja look who's here!"</p>

<p>"Now this is something!" agreed Renny.</p>

<p>The "something" was the red-headed woman, Lora Krants. She was being
conducted into the gloomy prison. Beside her walked Barton, the heavy-browed
young man she had called her brother. And behind her was the dark-skinned
Kama.</p>

<p>The fishermen were jabbering. Doc interpreted their excited
conversation.</p>

<p>"Our friends seem to have been forced down in their plane a short distance
at sea," he interpreted. "They were picked up by one of the fishing boats.
Perhaps they were depending on the power of the haunted ocean, and it failed
them."</p>

<p>"But look, what's that?" exclaimed Ham.</p>

<p>Four Norwegian fishermen were bearing between them what appeared to be a
crude boat of split bark. In this boat lay the nearly nude figure of a man. His
body was magnificently proportioned. His rugged face was hewn in the lines of a
Viking of old.</p>

<p>"Knut Aage, he came back like the others," said Zarkov. "Only for him they
seem to have built a boat."</p>

<p>Lapps and Norwegians were wailing in a mingled chorus. The ancient jarl
walked beside the strange bier from the sea. His white locks draped around his
pinched face.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was studying the rigid outlines of the body on the bark boat.</p>

<p>"Frozen," he said, quietly. "And frozen alive. Like those naked men the
fishermen reported who did not seem to feel the intense cold. It is possible
this man, Knut Aage, still lives."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THERE was an interruption. Because of the poor illumination in the
stavekirker, Doc and the other prisoners had not been immediately visible to
Lora Krants and the others being brought in.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl apparently heard Doc Savage's voice for the first time.
In the whale-oil flare, the young woman's face went ghastly white.</p>

<p>"You! Why, it couldn't be!" she murmured, then cried in a louder voice. "It
is! Mr. Savage, and the one called Renny! All of you! Oh, I'm so glad--so glad!
But how--"</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" thundered Renny. "I'll bet you're some surprised!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please!" cried the red-headed girl. "You don't know how much I
mean it! I'm overjoyed at seeing you here!"</p>

<p>Kama, from San Tao, was staring at Doc and the others. His eyes seemed dark,
for the moment, with hate. But he spoke in a suave voice.</p>

<p>"Evidently the infinite ocean has been overcome by some superior magic. Let
me congratulate and felicitate you, Doc Savage, on your escape. We happened to
come upon your plane after it was wrecked, and we feared you had perished."</p>

<p>Doc Savage was watching the red-headed girl. He apparently was reading much
deeper than the others. Perhaps he really believed the girl was sincere.</p>

<p>The dark-browed brother was sullen. He said nothing.</p>

<p>Zarkov seemed to be keeping his face averted. Suddenly the ancient jarl
stood before the prisoner. One skinny hand gripped Zarkov's shoulder. The
prisoner's face showed in the light.</p>

<p>The jarl was speaking in Norwegian, which Zarkov seemed to understand.</p>

<p>Doc and Ham also caught his words.</p>

<p>"My brother, Knut Aage, he is not dead," said the jarl. "He is not old
enough to die. It is some black magic of Satan's Gateway."</p>

<p>Doc Savage looked at the rigid form of Knut Aage. The bark boat, which had
become a coffin, had been set upon one of the wooden benches. Trembling hands
placed lighted candles beside the dead man's head.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the interior of the stavekirker was filled with an eerie,
fantastic trilling. The hands of some fishermen flew to their weapons. None
could determine from where the rare, almost tuneless melody had come.</p>

<p>Doc's companions knew he was on the verge of some discovery, or that some
plan had come to him. The bronze man spoke slowly, impressively, in Norwegian.
He was talking for the jarl.</p>

<p>"Your brother is only in the frozen sleep," Doc announced. "We of the sea
know that he is not dead. He can be awakened. If I am freed, I will see if the
magic of life cannot be applied."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XVII. DOC'S MIRACLE</h2>

<p>THE ancient jarl was not easily convinced. But he must have had some of the
fear of the others for Doc Savage and his men. Had they not come up out of the
sea, in the strange, transparent tube?</p>

<p>The jarl's sunken eyes had a piercing brightness. Suddenly, his thin voice
pronounced his decision.</p>

<p>"You shall be given the chance. If my brother lives, all shall go free! If
he is dead, then all of these prisoners shall die at once! There is no
alternative."</p>

<p>Doc Savage indicated this was agreeable. The bronze man knew that Renny's
thongs had been cut. The big engineer could free himself at any time.</p>

<p>Doc indicated Ham, and said, "I must have this man to help me." Then he
pointed to Monk. "And this man must be permitted to bring me the magical
potions from the glass fish."</p>

<p>This aroused much jabbering. But the jarl consented. Monk was cut loose. Doc
directed him to bring the portable laboratory which had been stored in the
cylinder. The hands and feet of Ham were freed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE man of bronze stood beside the still figure of Knut Aage. He had no
illusions about any supernatural ability to revive a man who had been frozen.
Very evidently, Knut Aage had been frozen while alive. There was no mark of
violence.</p>

<p>The rugged face was like chiseled marble. The eyes were closed as if the
Norwegian leader were only sleeping.</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. Guarded by half a dozen fishermen, Monk was
bringing in the portable laboratory.</p>

<p>The man of bronze proceeded slowly with his preparations. None there would
have believed a human hand could be quicker than the eye. But the hands of Doc
Savage were performing a miracle which had nothing to do with bringing Knut
Aage to life.</p>

<p>From Monk's laboratory, Doc produced a shallow, flat vessel. Solemnly, he
placed this near the head of the dead man in the bark boat. At the same time,
his incredible hands were concealing various devices from that same laboratory
about his clothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't do it--you can't do it!" breathed the red-headed girl. "All
of us will die! Mr. Savage, I want to tell you about the plane and--"</p>

<p>The dark-browed brother, Barton, caught the girl's wrist. Doc did not seem
to notice this. But Lora Krants winced with pain.</p>

<p>The dark-skinned Kama moved close to the pair. Words he believed none but
the girl and her brother could hear, were hissed. Doc Savage's trained ears
caught them.</p>

<p>"The boss man will come, you fool! A loose tongue may fasten a noose around
the whitest throat!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage was pouring three chemical powders together from containers. He
mixed them slowly with a glass rod. The chemical reaction produced a blaze of
reddish blue.</p>

<p>The man of bronze seldom displayed any great amount of ceremony. But now he
was as solemn as any priest of a temple. He began a slow chanting, a singsong
of apparently meaningless words. These were in the ancient Mayan which only he
and his men understood.</p>

<p>"Monk, Ham and Renny, your hands are free--you will first cut the thongs on
Long Tom--for the others we have no time--lead them out--Renny and Ham will get
to the weapons by the door--when I pour on the chemicals, cover your eyes--it
will be less than five seconds--be certain to lead all the others from the
stavekirker--"</p>

<p>"Lead that redhead out?" growled Renny. "And that Kama? Why, they
would--"</p>

<p>Doc gave no sign that he had noticed. His chant continued. "Lead all
out--perhaps there is much you cannot understand--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE singsong chant had impressed even the ancient jarl. The monkeylike small
figure was tense. His sunken eyes were fixed on the mixture in the flat vessel
beside Knut Aage's head.</p>

<p>Doc Savage picked up the fourth container. He held it above the blue flame
as if to filter it slowly into the blaze. But his powerful fingers closed in a
terrific grip.</p>

<p>The strong glass containing the chemical was crushed. All of it dropped and
spread at once upon the blaze.</p>

<p>Instantly, the interior of the stavekirker was illuminated with a blinding
flare. Doc was pressing the balls of his hands over his eyes. His own men were
doing the same.</p>

<p>The jarl and his crowding fishermen were perhaps too amazed to act at once.
Then, too, they might for a few seconds have imagined this was part of the
ceremony of producing life from death. The regard of the jarl for his Viking
brother was intense.</p>

<p>"See--as the light comes--Knut Aage will live!"</p>

<p>The bronze man's words gave them a few seconds more of time. With hands
still pressed over their eyes, Ham and Renny were moving toward the weapons
near the door. Long Tom was freed.</p>

<p>Zarkov and Larrone had not understood what was transpiring. At Doc's word,
Long Tom had sliced the thongs around their ankles.</p>

<p>"Come with us!" muttered Long Tom.</p>

<p>It was Monk whose furry hand fastened on the wrist of the red-headed
girl.</p>

<p>"Keep your mouth shut and come along!" ordered the apelike chemist. "An' if
you let out a squawk, I'll smack you down!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Lora Krants. "I'm blind! I can't see!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage himself seized the blinded Kama.</p>

<p>"You're coming with us," said the bronze man. "You will be unable to see for
an hour or more. It is well for you, and it may help answer some questions.
Anyway, you're taking us to where they landed your plane."</p>

<p>"Those in darkness have no choice of paths," said Kama, mockingly. "However,
I shall not lead you to the plane, for it is sunken in the fjord. You are not
clever enough, Doc Savage."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE Lapps and Norwegians became aware of the truth. They heard the voices of
their prisoners. Completely blinded, the fishermen were groping around. They
started jabbing with their harpoons.</p>

<p>The bronze man and his companions aided the others to evade the futile
attack. The interior of the dimly lighted stavekirker became a bedlam. In the
midst of this, Doc suddenly released his hold on Kama.</p>

<p>A miracle was taking place. The nearly nude figure of Knut Aage was no
longer rigid. One great arm was slowly lifting. The blond head was being
raised.</p>

<p>Doc Savage knew he had nothing to do with what might be happening. His
chemicals had been mixed for the sole purpose of creating a temporary
blindness. They had no potency either for illness or death.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the warmth of the stavekirker's interior. Or, more likely, it
was the condition in which Knut Aage had been placed by the mysterious men of
Satan's Gateway. Apparently, the Norwegian had been frozen.</p>

<p>Could it have been some new form of suspended animation?</p>

<p>The bronze man's sensitive hands touched Knut Aage's heaving breast. The
flesh was uncannily cold. It might well have been frozen. But Doc detected a
slow, pulsing beat. It was the heart. But this was the slowest throbbing of a
heart Doc Savage had ever encountered.</p>

<p>The strokes could not have been above twenty to the minute. This was out of
accord with all medical science. Life blood could not flow through any man's
veins at this sluggish rate.</p>

<p>But Knut Aage's eyes had opened. They were as glinting blue as the clean ice
of some new glacier. The white lips were attempting to form words.</p>

<p>None but Doc's own men could have observed this apparent miracle. And Doc's
men were otherwise engaged. Ham and Renny had scooped up the weapons near the
door. Some of the Lapps started a blind rush in the bedlam created by their own
voices.</p>

<p>The superfiring pistols whoomed suddenly, steadily. A whole line of
harpooners pitched to their faces. They would be out for at least two hours
under the mercy bullets.</p>

<p>From his clothing, Doc Savage produced a hypodermic syringe. In this was
perhaps the most powerful heart stimulant in the world. The man of bronze
carried it always. Its contents could put unconscious men on their feet.</p>

<p>A small part of the mixture was adrenalin. The rest of it was the result of
Doc's extensive surgical and medical knowledge. The man of bronze plunged the
needle into the seemingly frozen flesh of Knut Aage's breast. The needle
penetrated to the heart muscles.</p>

<p>Knut Aage's heartbeat may or may not have quickened. But the seeming dead
man who had returned in a coffin of bark sat up. Then he spoke. Because they
had been closed, his eyes had not been blinded.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage," were his first slow words. "Hjalmar Landson said you would
come."</p>

<p>Doc Savage spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"We must get out at once, Knut Aage. But if possible, I shall return in a
short time."</p>

<p>Doc again gripped Kama's wrist.</p>

<p>"I have heard the voice of Knut Aage," spoke Kama. "The renowned Doc Savage
undoubtedly will fancy he has performed amazing magic. But there are more
remarkable forces of which the world never before has been aware. It is no
miracle."</p>

<p>Doc impelled the dark-skinned man of San Tao toward the single door. Renny
had ceased using his superfirer. The giant engineer was standing waist-deep in
writhing bodies. Each time he struck with one of his tremendous fists, another
body was added to the heap.</p>

<p>Monk was howling, "Dag-gone it, Doc! C'mon! I can't hold onto this redhead
much longer!"</p>

<p>One long arm of the apelike chemist was sweeping around. It was helping
Renny and Long Tom clear a space to the outside. Monk's other hand was still
fastened to the red-headed girl's wrist. Barton, the dark-browed brother,
remained close to the young woman.</p>

<p>Zarkov and Larrone were among the first out of the stavekirker.</p>

<p>When they were outside, the interior of the stavekirker still resounded to
wild cries. The blinded Lapps and Norwegians were fighting each other.</p>

<p>With Kama close beside him, Doc Savage led the way up a sloping, icy trail.
Ahead was the monster glacier of Jostedalsbrae. Somewhere in the wilderness of
ice was Satan's Gateway.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. MEN OF ICY BLOOD</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE and his men had undertaken a Herculean task. The ascent of the
rugged mountain toward the Jostedalsbrae glacier was a feat for the strongest
man. In this case it became the job of each one of the five to lead one blinded
person.</p>

<p>With Kama beside him, Doc Savage led the way. The fleeing party crossed the
mountain between spitted peaks. Suddenly, they were floundering in mingled snow
and the dust of centuries. The man of bronze was forced to seek a trail of
harder ice.</p>

<p>He found such a pathway. Here steps seemed to have been cut into the
ice.</p>

<p>"This could be no other than the work of men," announced Doc. "We are
ascending what was once a great wall."</p>

<p>Kama only chuckled evilly. Then Monk let out a howling complaint.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities! I gotta go back! I've got to get Habeas Corpus!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the red-headed girl. "Who could have a legal name
like that?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a 'who,'" rasped Ham's sarcastic voice. "It's a pig!"</p>

<p>"A pig?" said the red-headed girl. "Goodness gracious! You want to go back
for a pig?"</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" yelped Monk. "I wish I'd 'a' let you go an' brought him
along!"</p>

<p>Doc was leading the way up the roughly hewn steps of the ice wall. Zarkov
and Larrone were disputing. They were accusing Doc Savage of deliberately
blinding them to prevent the carrying out of their mission.</p>

<p>Kama still was saying nothing. The ice stairway led up a wall where the top
was invisible.</p>

<p>Suddenly the steps ahead were obscured by ice blink. This was a dense fog
which was composed of minute particles of blowing snow and ice.</p>

<p>Doc Savage projected Kama ahead to where another step should have been. The
step was not there. The bronze man's feet slid onto a smooth slope. Still
gripping Kama's wrist, the man of bronze felt himself sliding rapidly downward
into the fog.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"HOLY cow!" boomed Renny. "I knew there'd be a trap in this somewhere! Now
where are we headed?"</p>

<p>No one bothered to reply. Each was busy trying to slide feet foremost down
the slippery grade. Doc Savage attempted to set his heels. This indeed might be
a trap. The ice slope possibly would end in a glacier crevasse.</p>

<p>Doc's men, who were blind, thumped into a heap on clear, flat ice. As they
gained their feet there was a moment of intense silence.</p>

<p>Then somewhere in the fog above them sounded a peculiar clop-clopping. The
sound was like the iron-shod hoofs of a horse slowly pounding on hard ice or
rock.</p>

<p>"Some one is passing over us," stated Doc. "It is perhaps some person in a
stolkjaerre, one of the native carts. Roads among the most ancient in the world
have been carved out of some of these mountains."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd better give the fellow a hail," suggested Ham.</p>

<p>"It would hardly be advisable," said the man of bronze. "At this moment, we
are being rapidly surrounded by many men."</p>

<p>There had been a rustling movement from four directions. This was as if
moccasined or skin-packed feet were shuffling over the glacier.</p>

<p>Now there came a clink of metal. It was like the snapping of a safety catch
on a pistol.</p>

<p>The slowly moving horse on the road above was still clanking his iron-shod
hoofs. Steel tires squealed in grittily cold snow.</p>

<p>Doc Savage pushed the blinded five into the middle of a small ring. He and
his own men stood about them.</p>

<p>Like the throwing of an electrical switch, the ice blink and the darkness
was swept away. Uncanny, white daylight enveloped them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE little party was huddled on a wide, flat plain of the great glacier.
Here the constant wind had kept the blue ice clear of dust and snow. The space
was perhaps a mile in extent. Beyond it rose a sheer black wall of rock.</p>

<p>It was on a high, winding road of this precipice the horse had passed with
the stolkjaerre. The cart had vanished.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" grunted Renny. "Wouldja look at them! Doc, we ain't got a
chance!"</p>

<p>"Fifty below zero, and they don't seem to have any use for clothes!"
exclaimed Long Tom.</p>

<p>Between forty and fifty strange figures ringed the party. They had halted
perhaps a dozen yards from Doc Savage and his men. All appeared to be white men
of normal size.</p>

<p>And at first glance, it seemed all of the men were naked. Then it was to be
observed that each man wore what might have been a breechcloth of skin.
Otherwise, their bodies were fully exposed to the rigorous temperature. All of
Doc's men and the others were thickly clad in furs.</p>

<p>The strangely naked, and equally strangely silent men were blond and tall.
Each held a modern rifle across one arm. One man spoke in the Norwegian
tongue.</p>

<p>"If you understand our language, you will make no resistance," he said,
calmly. "We have been sent to conduct you to the Man of Peace under the
mountain. You have not strong enough force to do us any damage."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Lora Krants. "The Man of Peace! At last!"</p>

<p>"Now what do you suppose is on her mind?" growled Renny.</p>

<p>Doc Savage made no answer to Renny; he spoke quietly to the naked men.</p>

<p>"It would seem we can do no other than accompany you," he said.</p>

<p>The tall leader of the naked men stepped closer. Then it was that Kama, of
San Tao, cried out sharply in his own language. The Oriental must have regained
his sight more quickly than the others.</p>

<p>Also, it was apparent he knew something of this place. His flowing command
rapped across the glacier. Men clad in furs poured from what appeared to be the
mouth of a cavern.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>NO time was given for an order from Doc Savage.</p>

<p>Guns started cracking venomously. These were in the hands of the new
arrivals. These men were short, and dark of face.</p>

<p>Three or four of the naked men fell at the first volley. Kama, of San Tao,
was running. He darted across the ice toward the new party. His voice shouted a
new command.</p>

<p>Though the naked men had been taken by apparent surprise, they acted. Their
rifles belched fire.</p>

<p>The impetuous Renny opened up with his superfirer. Three or four men went
down before the mercy bullets. Doc Savage took the weapon from Renny's
hand.</p>

<p>"It would be advisable for us to keep out of this," stated the man of
bronze. "Wisdom directs us to retreat while we have opportunity."</p>

<p>Kama was now among the new crowd of men. Plainly they were from his own
country. They were like those who had appeared at Doc Savage's headquarters in
Manhattan and attacked Long Tom and Professor Callus.</p>

<p>Zarkov cried out with pain. His hands were flung out and his body pitched to
the ice. He would not speak again. A rifle bullet had bored into his skull over
one ear.</p>

<p>Larrone yelled, and started running in a circle. He still could not see.</p>

<p>The illuminated glacier was all white daylight. Doc Savage was looking up
the wall of black rock. Close to this wall, in the distance, were what appeared
to be streaming rays of light.</p>

<p>It was clear to the bronze man that this uncanny daylight must be coming
from this source. Doc could make out what might have been described as short
stacks of steel.</p>

<p>At the top of each stack appeared to be an eye. A luminous globe. The
glowing daylight was greater than the light of the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>Doc directed the others to crouch close to the ice. The naked men and the
dark men were about evenly matched in numbers. The naked men moved toward
near-by ice ridges.</p>

<p>Eight or ten of the nearly nude figures lay on the ice. Doc made note of a
queer circumstance. Though these men were dead or seriously wounded, no blood
had flowed from the bullet holes.</p>

<p>Kama now was leading his group toward Doc and his men. The dark men switched
the object of their fire. Bullets buzzed off the ice. Some thudded into Doc's
bulletproof garments.</p>

<p>From one of his many pockets Doc produced two small metal globes. On each of
these was a small lever. Doc moved these levers. He tossed both objects toward
the oncoming men of Kama's.</p>

<p>Between Doc's party and Kama's attackers the glacier split into a wide
crevasse. Two explosions drowned out the cracking of the rifles.</p>

<p>Kama's dark men were blown from their feet. But none seemed to be seriously
injured. Their advance would only be temporarily impeded.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had refrained from killing with the high-explosive
chemicals in the tiny bombs. He hoped only to break up the glacier between them
and provide respite by which they might escape.</p>

<p>Kama was shouting. The leader of the nearly naked men was trying to halt the
flight of his force.</p>

<p>"We will try and get back to the stairs of the icy causeway," said Doc. "It
is certain Kama does not want us to live. We do not know what might happen in
the hands of the others."</p>

<p>The red-headed girl still was unable to see. She attempted to rise. One foot
slipped and she fell back. Her face was very white.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've twisted my ankle!" she moaned. "All of you get away. Don't
wait for me."</p>

<p>The man of bronze caught up the red-headed girl as easily as if she were a
small child. Renny and Ham pushed her brother and Larrone in the right
direction. It seemed they would have time to get back up the icy slope to the
stairway.</p>

<p>As suddenly as it had come, the eerie daylight was switched off. The fog
from the ice had not been dissipated. All were groping in a darkness.
Visibility had been reduced to a few feet only.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SOMETHING new happened in that darkness. The nearly naked men rallied. They
surrounded Doc and the others. They made no effort to use their rifles.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was hemmed in by men of as great size as himself. Their movements
were slower. The man of bronze let the red-headed girl slip to the ice. His
incredibly fast fists struck at shadowy figures.</p>

<p>Three or four men pushed him to the ice with their weight. Doc's bronze
fingers fastened on the neck of one. His thumb pressed a nerve center. The man
should have become unconscious instantly. But the paralyzing hold seemed to
have little effect.</p>

<p>Doc Savage had the queer sensation of having pressed his fingers into dead
flesh. It yielded. The skin was as cold as ice. The usual nerve reaction failed
to take place.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it! Lemme go!" howled Monk.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny's voice. "I didn't know it was you!"</p>

<p>They had exchanged blows in the fog. Renny's fist must have knocked Monk
out. The chemist said nothing more.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was fighting the weight of numbers. From a distance, he could
hear the cracking of Kama's rifles. But they did not seem to have crossed the
blasted crevasse. The bullets were flying wild.</p>

<p>The man of bronze attempted to get at some of the anaesthetic capsules.
Cold, heavy arms pinned him to the ice. The bronze giant was being held down by
what seemed to be the relentless weight of men whose flesh seemed frozen.</p>

<p>A blow from the hard butt of a gun rapped across the base of his skull.
Doc's senses faded out.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XIX. THE WANDERING PROFESSOR</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE came to his senses with the queer feeling of having been carried
and then dropped roughly. He put out one hand and it touched bare flesh. This
was very cold.</p>

<p>The bronze man was still enveloped in the glacial fog. He could hear two
voices faintly.</p>

<p>The man he had touched was one of the largest of the nearly naked
Norwegians. Doc produced his small pencil flashlight. The spring generator
hummed inside. The ray widened on the white body of the man on the ice.</p>

<p>The man was dead. Without doubt, he had been carrying Doc Savage. An ugly
hole appeared between the man's shoulders. A bullet had gone in through his
spine.</p>

<p>Doc got to his feet. From near by came a low moan. A few yards away lay
another of the Norwegians. His skull had been clipped by a slug. But he was
still breathing. His head had only been creased.</p>

<p>The man of bronze wondered what had happened to the others. The last he
could recall was battling with a weight of cold flesh. Then he had been knocked
unconscious.</p>

<p>Apparently these men, carrying him away, had been attacked. Or they might
have been hit by bullets fired from some distance.</p>

<p>The voices Doc had heard grew more distinct "Dag-gone it!" piped Monk's
voice. "They've got Doc, and I think you know something about it! I oughta make
you walk!"</p>

<p>"Please, oh, please!" came the voice of Lora Krants. "I don't know what
happened! There were men all around! Mr. Savage was knocked down! I thought I
saw them taking him away, but I couldn't walk!"</p>

<p>"Over this way, Monk!" called out Doc, flashing the pencil light.</p>

<p>The big chemist let out a whoop of delight.</p>

<p>"An' it's a good thing for you I found him!" he squealed at Lora Krants. "I
was just about to let you find your own way outta this mess!"</p>

<p>Monk's ungainly figure came into the circle of light. For all of his
threats, the apelike chemist was carrying the young woman in his arms. He set
her carefully down on the ice.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we found you, Mr. Savage," exclaimed the girl. "I was afraid
something awful had happened! And my brother's gone, too!"</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" asked Doc--"Renny, Long Tom, Ham, Larrone."</p>

<p>Monk shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>"The last I remember, Renny cracked me one and I hit my head on the ice," he
said. "When I woke up, I heard the redhead crying. Doc, I don't trust her any
more."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>MONK was being quite frank about Lora Krants. The girl spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"The circumstances are unavoidable," murmured the girl. "I am here, it is
true, but I cannot tell you why. Not now. I hope everything will come all
right, then you will know."</p>

<p>Doc Savage turned to the wounded Norwegian. The nearly naked man was still
groaning.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it, Doc!" exploded Monk. "She knows something about this fellow
that naked guy called the Man of Peace!"</p>

<p>Doc seemed not to have heard Monk's protesting statement. He was examining
the wounded Norwegian.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said the man of bronze, "that blood should not flow from a
wound. The man's flesh is cold, like all of the others."</p>

<p>"They're not frozen, they're--"</p>

<p>The red-headed girl seemed to have spoken involuntarily. She ended her
speech by stuffing the back of one furred mitten over her red lips.</p>

<p>"I knew it!" yelped Monk. "I'll bet this dame knows all about this,
too!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is true," assented Doc. "But I'm sure Miss Krants will talk
when the time comes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doc Savage," murmured the girl.</p>

<p>Doc had extracted an instrument from his clothing. It looked like a
combination stethoscope and sick room thermometer on a miniature scale. The man
of bronze attached it to the man's breast with a slender, piercing needle.</p>

<p>He listened for a moment with the earpiece of the instrument. As he did, the
fantastic trilling suddenly filled the ice fog. Doc looked closely at the tiny
thermometer.</p>

<p>"What is it, Doc?" questioned Monk. "Is the poor devil about to pass
out?"</p>

<p>The wounded Norwegian's muscled breast was heaving with slow breathing.</p>

<p>"According to the most reliable medical information, this man has been dead
for some time," stated Doc, calmly. "Any physician would probably declare rigor
mortis has set in."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities, Doc!" squealed Monk. "The fellow's still
breathing!"</p>

<p>"That is true," advised Doc. "Also, his heart is still beating. Yet the
temperature shows at exactly twenty-six. The heart action is recording only
thirty-two beats a minute."</p>

<p>"It ain't possible!" squawked Monk. "What do you say, Doc, we get out of
here? I don't like this place!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC was examining the wounded man more closely.</p>

<p>"Only a few known animals can be frozen and still survive," stated Doc.
"There's one, the Chorni Ryba, or Alaskan blackfish."</p>

<p>"But dag-gone it, Doc," protested Monk, "the human temperature has to be
around ninety-eight, and the pulse about seventy-two."</p>

<p>"That is true," stated the man of bronze. "In some acute cases of illness
the human temperature has been known to go as low as seventy-five. But there is
danger of death. Adrenalin increases heat and heart action by burning bodily
sugar. I would say nearly all of the sugar has been burned from these men. So
they have become almost impervious to freezing temperature."</p>

<p>Doc's hands probed around the base of the Norwegian's brain.</p>

<p>Monk was watching Lora Krants. She again clamped her furred mitten over her
lips, as if to keep from speaking.</p>

<p>"These fellows did not yield to nerve pressure," stated Doc. "Now part of
the reason becomes apparent. The nerves controlling temperature are known as
the diencephalon. They are located at the base of the brain. A scar shows where
nerve groups must have been changed."</p>

<p>Doc Savage ceased speaking. The cold-blooded Norwegian at his feet had
ceased to breathe.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"LISTEN, Doc!" admonished Monk. "Hear that? Isn't it that horse again, upon
the road?"</p>

<p>The iron-shod hoofs were clanking. The steel tires squealed in the sandy
snow. From a short distance up the black wall, a voice hailed.</p>

<p>"Hello there, below! Can you direct us to a way down? My driver said there
was a fishing village near by, but this road seems to end in a mountain
meadow!"</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" exploded Monk. "Doc, that's Professor Callus or I
don't know voices! This whole thing's crazy!"</p>

<p>"It is Professor Callus," agreed Doc, calmly. Then he called out, "We know
of a way down afoot, but not from the road up there."</p>

<p>"Doc Savage!" shouted Professor Callus. "I might have known you would have
found your way into this place! But I had greatly feared you were lost in your
plane, after I learned you had started for the Norway coast!"</p>

<p>"We escaped that disaster," replied Doc. "Your own presence indicates you
are greatly interested in the mystery of the haunted ocean, Professor
Callus."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and who wouldn't be, after all that happened in Manhattan," replied
the professor. "When I learned you had started for The Land of the Midnight
Sun, I chartered a plane. We were over a great plateau of snow when that
strange disturbance of the ocean must have started again. Our plane lost its
power and we narrowly escaped death.</p>

<p>"I accompanied my two pilots until we found a village. Then I heard of this
fishing town and hired one of these Norwegian carts. Do you think we could get
down this cliff and join you?"</p>

<p>"That might be possible," stated Doc. "Also it might be advisable for your
own safety--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE words of the bronze man were lost in a sudden crackle of gunfire. The
fusillade apparently came from the road above not far from the cart of
stolkjaerre.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage!" shouted Professor Callus. "We are being attacked! They
are--"</p>

<p>His next words were lost in the crashing plunge of a horse. Above in the ice
blink fog the stolkjaerre crackled as if it were being dashed against the
rocks. A hoarse voice cried out in Norwegian.</p>

<p>"They've got him!" yelled Monk.</p>

<p>The stolkjaerre and the horse came rolling down the black wall. They struck
the flat ice with sickening impact. A man's body thudded onto the glacier.</p>

<p>A command was shouted above. It was the voice of Kama.</p>

<p>The man who had fallen, lay almost at the feet of Doc Savage. Plainly enough
he was the skydgul, or driver of the cart. His head was horribly crushed.</p>

<p>Professor Callus had not fallen with the cart. Doc Savage whirled back to
the others. He caught up the slender form of the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>"We must get out before they find a way down the wall," advised Doc.
"Farther on, there may be some trail leading up to that mountain meadow. I
imagine it would be unsafe to go back down the causeway."</p>

<p>Above them, the men of Kama were scrambling along the road. It was apparent
they were seeking a way down. Now Kama knew Doc Savage still lived and was
below.</p>

<p>"If there is a mountain meadow at the end of that road, I think there will
be a way down for us," advised Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"How would you know that?" said Monk.</p>

<p>"You will find a strange means of transportation from every mountain meadow
along this coast," stated Doc.</p>

<p>The man of bronze seemed not to mind the weight of the red-headed girl. His
progress was so swift Monk was compelled to lope along on his short legs. They
were concealed by the darkness. The men of Kama were making so much noise they
could not have heard them depart.</p>

<p>Doc had progressed more than a mile along the wall before a break appeared.
Monk had great difficulty climbing the steep ascent. The bronze man cradled the
girl in his arms and swung easily upward.</p>

<p>They emerged upon a road that had been carved centuries before.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XX. THE SKY SLIDE</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE carried Lora Krants into the mountain meadow. On this soil, in
season, a crop of hay had been grown. Some of this was covered with snow where
it had been spread upon wooden racks to dry during the summer.</p>

<p>Lora Krants tried her twisted ankle. It would not bear her weight.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can ever get out of this place," the girl said. "If
Kama's men come up the road, we are trapped."</p>

<p>Doc Savage did not reply. The man of bronze could hear the pursuit. The
slight crunching of men's feet in the snow had not yet come to the ears of
either Monk or the girl.</p>

<p>Doc was following the rack of abandoned hay. At one end the meadow seemed to
tip off into space. And far below showed the hazy flare of torches. The meadow
seemed to lie almost directly above the fishing village.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it, Doc!" complained Monk. "If them devils are on the road, we
can't get out of here! It's more than a thousand feet down!"</p>

<p>Doc was stripping back some of the hay. From the drying rack he pulled two
queer-looking iron hooks. They were covered with heavy, dried reindeer
hide.</p>

<p>"Now we will find the hesjire," stated Doc. "Unless it is too badly rusted,
we have a means of transportation it isn't likely any one will use to follow
us."</p>

<p>Now Monk and the girl could hear the crunching feet of the oncoming men.
Their pursuers were already entering the farther side of the meadow. Some of
the pursuers whooped. They had come upon the tracks of Doc and the others.</p>

<p>"All right," said Doc. "Monk, you will go first. I will follow with Miss
Krants."</p>

<p>"Down that thing?" growled Monk. "You mean we're doin' a circus act down
that measly wire?"</p>

<p>"It isn't much of a stunt," said Doc, calmly. "The people here find this
crude elevator quite convenient."</p>

<p>Monk and the girl were staring at the slender wire attached to a heavy,
wooden post. The village flares looked miles away. Only a few feet of the tight
wire was visible. It slanted down into space.</p>

<p>Doc wrapped one of the hooks over the wire. Under the hook was a loop. On
this crude contrivance hay was shot down from the mountain in the summer to the
village below. Perhaps, as Doc had said, the wire might be rusted and weak. But
it was the only means of escape.</p>

<p>Monk hooked one hairy wrist into the loop. He drew a deep breath. Then he
stepped off into space. The tough hide of the hook squawked shrilly on the
wire. Monk almost instantly disappeared.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SPARKS flashed from the hook and wire.</p>

<p>Behind them, Kama shouted out an oath. Now he had discovered the plan of Doc
Savage. Rifles began to explode. Bullets clipped the snow.</p>

<p>"You'll have to trust me and hold your breath," counseled Doc.</p>

<p>"You have trusted me, and I don't know why," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is because I know you are not Lora Krants," said the man of
bronze, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Kama's men were running. Their rifles whoomed now. There seemed no further
effort to spare the girl. Doc felt the slugs nipping at his furs. But the
bulletproof undergarment was stopping them. He gathered the girl into one
massive arm.</p>

<p>Doc's other bronzed wrist wrapped into the loop of hide. He put the hook
over the wire and stepped into space.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl suddenly clung to Doc Savage's neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll be killed--I must tell you--the plane--"</p>

<p>The girl gasped these words. The hook over the wire was screeching. It must
have seemed to the girl their descent could only be checked by a crushing
impact.</p>

<p>Yet, as swiftly as they were dropping, Doc Savage felt the tremor he feared
most. Kama's men were hammering at the wire post above. Bullets sang past their
flying bodies. If Kama succeeded in getting that wire loosened, only a miracle
could save them.</p>

<p>Doc's powerful wrist was twisting the hook. They had dropped almost five
hundred feet before he started checking their speed. Below them, the strained
voice of Monk called up.</p>

<p>His words were unintelligible. The wire seemed to slacken suddenly. At its
lower end this hesjire, or mountain elevator, curved into a deep bend that was
intended to slow down any descending object before it crashed the lower
post.</p>

<p>Doc and the girl were in this bend when the wire sang wickedly. It had been
cut at the post above. Their bodies turned over and fell.</p>

<p>Even at forty below zero, the deep water of the fjord never was frozen. This
was because of the influence of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>"Hold your breath!" commanded Doc, as they flashed downward.</p>

<p>The bronze man could not be sure whether they were falling into the fjord or
upon the rocky shore.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE had sucked air into his great lungs. Holding the girl, his giant
form struck with a force that would have stunned another man.</p>

<p>The water of the fjord received them. The thick furs helped break the
shock.</p>

<p>The girl had become limp in Doc's arm. Fighting back to the surface was a
gigantic task. Doc succeeded in stripping the upper part of his body of the
clinging furs. His massive arm and limbs churned the blue water.</p>

<p>Doc Savage had underwater training comparable only to the skill of South Sea
pearl divers.</p>

<p>No doubt, Lora Krants was in that state described as drowned. Her lungs had
filled with water. When they reached the surface, she was for the time as dead
as she would ever be.</p>

<p>Monk helped get the girl to the shore. Now the quick freezing of that
fearful temperature became an imminent menace.</p>

<p>"I thought you was gone for good that time, Doc," declared Monk,
plaintively. "Now what are we going to do? I guess the little redhead is dead.
We can't do much without a fire. If we build one they'll be right on our necks
from that crazy village."</p>

<p>Monk was scratching his nubbin of a head. Anxiety screwed his homely face
into an ugly knot.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was stripping off nearly all of his clothing.</p>

<p>"Get off her furs and the rest of her clothing," he ordered Monk. "We can
save her without a fire."</p>

<p>Doc Savage might have added that only his great surgical skill could
accomplish what might otherwise have been impossible. Monk's awkward hands
trembled, but he clicked his teeth grimly and went to work.</p>

<p>While Monk was preparing the girl, Doc did some exercises that restored his
own circulation.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl lay on her face. Monk applied what he knew of first aid.
This was having little effect.</p>

<p>"Monk, you will go to the first of the skin huts in the village," directed
Doc. "You will find some are unoccupied. Take the driest skins and bring them
back."</p>

<p>For Monk, this was a welcome mission.</p>

<p>Doc Savage had become the great surgeon. Monk had dropped his own outer
furs. Within five minutes, Lora Krants gave a great sobbing breath.</p>

<p>Monk's outer furs were wrapped about the young woman when Monk returned. He
was carrying an armload of miscellaneous furred skins. Doc and the girl were
quickly clothed.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had preserved all of his devices in the pockets of his
bulletproof garment.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the girl. "I dreamed I had died, and I saw my father! I thought
that I had crossed the ocean and--"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes widened with dawning realization of her present position.
She ceased speaking. Doc ignored her words. He had said he knew she was not
Lora Krants.</p>

<p>"Our best chance for the present is to discover if the cylinder is intact,"
stated Doc. "I believe the superstitious fishermen would hesitate to touch
it."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE had guessed correctly. The strange glass fish was still in the
sand where it had been beached. The tide was ebbing.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" gritted Monk. "Are we going down again?"</p>

<p>"We must find the wrecked plane at once," stated Doc. "Perhaps the fate of
Johnny and the commission, and all the others depends upon our getting some
means of entering the fjord called Satan's Gateway. Miss Krants now will direct
us to the spot where the plane was beached."</p>

<p>"I will do anything I can," stated the girl. "But for you, I would not be
alive, Doc Savage. The plane was beached. Its power is lost without the
daylight you saw. It has other motors, but they failed."</p>

<p>Oil torches still flared in the stavekirker. A light moved among the skin
huts of the Lapps. No person was near the glass fish.</p>

<p>"We have enough compressed air to last perhaps an hour," stated Doc. "In
that time, either we will reach the wrecked plane or get to Satan's
Gateway."</p>

<p>Monk and the girl were crowded into the glass fish. Doc was pushing and
pulling the cylinder into position where its own compressed air force would
slide it into the fjord.</p>

<p>Doc slid inside the glass fish and closed the lid. Immediately the blue,
unearthly light of the tubes began to glow. This gave the transparent cylinder
a supernatural appearance.</p>

<p>An oxygen tank hissed. Then Doc Savage switched on the compressed air.
Sputtering explosions resulted.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE tail of the glass fish was buried in the sand. It was as if a great hand
pushed it into the deep fjord. The cylinder sank a hundred feet.</p>

<p>"Where is this plane?" said Doc Savage. "We have but little time."</p>

<p>"It was pulled up on a shelf at the north side of the fjord," said the
red-headed girl. "Perhaps if you can reach it, the power of the ocean will come
on. Then you could use it."</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. His real purpose in reaching the plane was to
examine the strange machinery. He hoped this would give him some inkling of the
force which must be overcome.</p>

<p>"Doc," said Monk, "do you suppose they took Ham and the others alive? If
they've killed Ham, I'll stay here and take these mountains apart!"</p>

<p>Lora Krants stared at the ugly chemist. She had imagined Monk and Ham would
have slit each other's throats at the slightest excuse.</p>

<p>"Before we reach the plane, Miss Krants," suggested Doc, "have you any other
information to divulge?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes suddenly went cold.</p>

<p>"I may seem ungrateful, Doc Savage," she said, "but I have nothing more I
can tell."</p>

<p>Doc did not insist. He had arrived at an amazing theory. If what he believed
proved to be the truth, he imagined Washington would be rocked.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>NEAR the entrance to the fjord of the fishing village, Doc mixed the
chemicals which filled the outer envelope of the cylinder with the powerful
lifting gas. The girl was watching the bronze giant with increasing
amazement.</p>

<p>Then they reached the plane.</p>

<p>The modern, streamlined plane rested on a narrow shelf. Its wings and
fuselage were marvels of mechanical genius. The design rivaled the best of
Doc's own superior ships. Apparently no great damage had resulted from the
forced landing.</p>

<p>"If that thing only will fly, we could bomb that Kama off the glacier,"
suggested Monk, as the glass fish nosed close to the shelf. "I'd like to get my
hands on Kama!"</p>

<p>Doc was sliding back the lid. The play of the aurora borealis was giving
some light. But it could not give the bronze man visibility around the point of
the jutting mountain.</p>

<p>Beyond their range of vision, two ordinary fishing schooners were nosing
across the fjord. From winches on the deck of each boat extended cable ropes.
These went down into the sea.</p>

<p>The fishing boats were perhaps three hundred yards apart. Between them was
nearly all of the width of the narrow entrance to the deep fjord.</p>

<p>"Remain here until I investigate," directed Doc. "If it is possible to
operate the motors, we will board the plane."</p>

<p>"This cylinder will be all right," protested Monk.</p>

<p>"That may be," agreed Doc. "But close the lid and be prepared to submerge if
anything should happen. I will be gone only a few minutes."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXI. IN THE DEVIL'S NET</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE reached the roomy cabin of the mystery plane. The craft had been
operated part of the time by ordinary motors. The propellers were not now
connected with these.</p>

<p>The bronze man's fantastic trilling filled the space. He was inspecting
short metal prongs extending from the cowling. These were equipped at the outer
ends with what might have been bright mirrors.</p>

<p>Doc determined these were powerful lenses. They were of the type employed in
the greatest telescopes.</p>

<p>The prongs were of hollow metal alloy. They concentrated on groups of
selenium cells. These were arranged in the form of batteries hooked together
for the concentration of power upon one objective.</p>

<p>"It was bound to happen some day," mused the man of bronze. "The light has
been discovered to operate the machinery of the world. This could only be a
power that would revolutionize all transportation."</p>

<p>He saw the plane props had been operated by the power of light. The
mysterious property of selenium, already applied on a small scale to operate
motors in laboratories, had been amplified on a greater and more practical
scale.</p>

<p>The mystery of the apparent uncanny daylight was unfolded to Doc Savage. He
realized that a band of such light, with proper motive machinery, might some
day operate every ship that sailed the seas, every vehicle of transportation in
the world.</p>

<p>The regular motors of the plane had been irreparably wrecked. Parts of the
machinery had been fused and ruined.</p>

<p>So engrossed was Doc in his investigation, he failed to note the lights of
the fishing schooners coming into the fjord. The dark hulks of these craft lay
close to the opposite walls.</p>

<p>The boats were dragging something between them. One boat was slowly
approaching the spot where Monk and the red-headed girl lay in the transparent
glass fish. Perhaps its blue, unearthly illumination was seen by men on the
fishing boats.</p>

<p>"There are lights coming along the fjord," said Lora Krants. "Do you suppose
we should call to Doc Savage?"</p>

<p>Monk shook his nubbin of a head.</p>

<p>"Doc's eyes are quicker than yours," Monk boasted. "He has seen the lights.
He knows what to do."</p>

<p>Monk was even then planning to open the sliding door. One long arm reached
out. A blundering elbow struck the lever controlling the compression tanks.</p>

<p>The air hissed and exploded at the tail of the glass fish. With a vibrating
movement, the cylinder slithered from the shelf. Its lifting gas had partly
evaporated.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE emerged from the plane's cabin. He had seen the ship rested so
that the removal of its wooden blocks would slide it off the shelf into the
fjord.</p>

<p>The bronze man noted that the tide now had changed. As in these northern
latitudes, the flood was starting with a rush. A swift current was beginning to
boil along the cliff.</p>

<p>Doc Savage started toward the spot where he had left the glass fish.
Suddenly he hastened his stride. The chugging of the motors of the fishing
boats had come to his ears. He could see their distant moving lights.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had expected to be guided back to the glass fish by its
phosphorescent illumination. The light had vanished. He believed for a few
seconds that Monk might have tampered with the tubes.</p>

<p>But it was not that. Doc Savage checked his rush at the edge of the sloping
shelf. The green depths, he knew, dropped here to perhaps five hundred
feet.</p>

<p>Doc stared bleakly down into the deep water. He could just mark a dim, blue
radiance. The glass fish was submerged. It was at least a hundred feet beneath
the surface. It was still sinking.</p>

<p>Doc Savage rarely had a sensation of helplessness. For just a few seconds,
he stood rooted to the spot. There beneath him, Monk and Lora Krants were
slowly dropping into the depths.</p>

<p>Doc could only depend upon Monk's knowledge of chemistry to bring the glass
fish to the surface. Apparently Monk had been unable to apply the lifting gas.
Doc Savage remembered an oversight.</p>

<p>The final chemical combination, the key to the production of the gas, was
now in his own pocket. He had expected to be gone only a minute or two.</p>

<p>Monk was powerless to bring the glass fish from the bottom of the fjord.</p>

<p>An eddy in the sweeping flood tide caught the light far below. Its force
whisked the blue radiance from view, downward under the straight wall of the
black cliff.</p>

<p>Doc Savage groaned deeply. The faithful Monk and the red-headed girl were
undoubtedly going to certain doom.</p>

<p>The fishing boat on this side of the fjord came nosing along on the
tide.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE whipped back to the mystery plane. He could do nothing here. None
of his vast forces could reach down into the murk of that icy water. The glass
fish had apparently become a coffin from which no human agency ever could
rescue its occupants.</p>

<p>The man of bronze brought his mind to the thought of his other men. Johnny,
the member of the war commission; Renny, Ham and Long Tom, if they were alive,
must be prisoners in the hands of Kama--or this Man of Peace, whoever he might
be.</p>

<p>Doc kicked the blocks from under the wheels of the amphibian plane. The
streamlined ship rolled toward the water. It slid into the fjord. The pontoons
had not been damaged.</p>

<p>The bronze man swung to one wing as the rushing tide caught the plane. The
pontoons lifted the ship buoyantly. It was swept along the face of the cliff
toward the inner end of the fjord.</p>

<p>Farther out in the sea, beyond visibility from the fjord, lay another craft.
But nothing of its hull was visible. Only three, horned prongs stuck above the
surface.</p>

<p>These prongs had eyes, but the eyes now were apparently dead and sightless.
If Doc Savage had seen these things his action would have been different.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>MORE than a mile above the fishing village, the mystery plane ground along
the rocks. Doc Savage leaped ashore. He wedged one of the ship's wings into a
cleft of the rocks.</p>

<p>The man of bronze was a strange, almost appalling individual. The cured
skins taken from the village were his only clothes. He had fitted them about
his giant body as best he could. His movements were like those of some
grotesque animal.</p>

<p>Doc glided toward the mountain trail. He headed upward. His intention was to
return to Jostedalsbrae glacier. Somewhere beyond the ice stairs he hoped to
pick up the trail of some of his missing men.</p>

<p>Still the northern lights afforded the only illumination. Doc arrived at the
first finger of the glacier. He floundered over the surface covered with mixed
dust and snow.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bronze man halted. There was no sound that any normal man might
have heard. But the keen wind whipping down from the Jostedalsbrae brought
something to Doc's sharp olfactory sense.</p>

<p>This was a human smell. And the odor of tanned hide. It was so faint as to
have been missed by other than the noses of the plateau wolves or the deer of
the mountains.</p>

<p>Doc flattened himself. He became a part of the dust-covered ice. But he had
not been quick enough.</p>

<p>A blue flame sliced from the edge of a glacial crack not far away. The
explosion of a rifle followed. Dusty snow slapped into Doc's face. The rifle
cracked again. The second bullet skipped about the same distance away.</p>

<p>Doc carried no device that could have reached the gunner. He waited for the
third shot.</p>

<p>A voice spoke in Norwegian.</p>

<p>"You will stay where you are until I see whether you are a friend or an
enemy!" it commanded. "I will not kill you unless you resist!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage replied quietly.</p>

<p>"I had hoped to find you somewhere on the glacier, Knut Aage. You were wise
to give such warning. I believe we have a common purpose."</p>

<p>"It is you, Doc Savage!" exclaimed Knut Aage in perfect English. "It was to
seek you I ascended the Jostedalsbrae. I found evidence which made me believe
your party had been wiped out. You must be the amazing man Hjalmar Landson
reported."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>KNUT AAGE came closer. His face was still as white as that of a
death's-head. His skin had the coldness of marble.</p>

<p>Doc was sure Knut Aage had been made a victim of the icy blood.</p>

<p>"I fear I have lost one of my men, the chemist called Monk," said Doc
Savage. "My other companions may be prisoners of one of these conflicting
forces of the glacier. Perhaps you would know something of what is behind all
of this, Knut Aage?"</p>

<p>"I know much, Doc Savage, but not enough," said Knut Aage. "It is only
enough to know that I shall sacrifice my life if necessary to destroy the devil
they call a Man of Peace. He is the real satan of the ice caverns. You say, Doc
Savage, you have lost the man known as Monk?"</p>

<p>"Unless I am mistaken, Monk and a girl who calls herself Lora Krants have
perished at the bottom of the fjord beside the fishing village," stated
Doc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IN the meantime, the glass fish was sinking toward the bottom of the
mountain-walled fjord. The face of the red-headed girl was white as death. But
now that the end seemed to be near, her red lips were tightened in courage.</p>

<p>Monk was attempting to get a proper mixture of chemicals in the gas-making
retort. He found three powders. They produced a blue flame. But the element
needed seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>"Now that it seems as if we are to die together, Monk, you might be a little
more pleasant," suggested the red-headed girl. "I think you and all of Doc
Savage's men are swell! My own mission in this country was to save you from
disaster."</p>

<p>Monk only grunted. He shut off the compressed air. The glass fish had been
moving against the flood tide. Monk had decided to save what power he had.</p>

<p>He stared bleakly at the gas-making retort. He wished for his portable
laboratory. The suck of the tide started whirling the glass fish over and over.
Its spinning motion seemed to be boring toward the bottom.</p>

<p>Monk again turned on the compressed air. The glass fish nosed into the flood
tide. But it had no buoyancy and would not ascend. Monk had a tight feeling
across his throat.</p>

<p>The girl's attractive face was suddenly buried in her hands. She had been
nodding sleepily.</p>

<p>Monk guessed the reason. Their oxygen supply was running low. He turned on
the last of the small tanks. There was no hissing.</p>

<p>Monk rolled over, facing the girl.</p>

<p>"Dang it!" he managed. "I ain't so mad at you! I guess maybe you have your
reasons."</p>

<p>"You are a funny, ugly, kind-hearted man," whispered Lora Krants. "It hurts
to breathe, to talk, Monk. I guess this--is--about the end--"</p>

<p>Monk's possible reply was snatched away. The glowing blue glass fish struck
some obstruction. In spite of its compressed air power, the cylinder was hurled
over and back into the tide.</p>

<p>The glass fish lifted and tilted. Its blue radiance illuminated the water
for several yards on the outside.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" gasped Monk. "A whole flock of big fish have grabbed
us! Next thing we'll be swallowed like Jonah by the whale! Wouldja look at
that!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Lora Krants. "We're trapped at the bottom of the
fjord!"</p>

<p>It seemed both statements were correct. Giant codfish with eyes sticking out
like huge knobs pressed against the transparent cylinder. Silvery salmon
flashed among them.</p>

<p>The glass fish was being swept along.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe we're going up!" exclaimed Lora Krants. "Monk, we're caught
in one of those great fish seines! I'll bet Doc Savage had found a way to save
us!"</p>

<p>"Doc's a lot of things, but he ain't any fisherman," asserted Monk. "An' he
wasn't carryin' any fishin' seine around with him. It's them heathen have got
us again!"</p>

<p>The glass cylinder was rising rapidly toward the surface of the fjord.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ON the two fishing boats the fishermen were gabbing excitedly. The schooners
had been dragging their giant seine into the fjord on the flood tide.</p>

<p>Fishermen jabbered. They had seen the strange, glowing monster strike the
net. Winches began to grind. Cables were pulling the great seine toward the
surface.</p>

<p>These men on the boats had not been in the village during the presence of
the glass cylinder with Doc's men. They were seeing the weird blue glow for the
first time.</p>

<p>They could see through the glass sides. Monk and the girl were visible. They
were motionless. Apparently they were corpses in a lighted glass coffin.</p>

<p>Still, the winches turned.</p>

<p>Like the flicking of a switch, eerie daylight flooded the fjord under the
mountains. The grinding winches stopped abruptly. The engines of the fishing
schooners crackled and ceased turning the propellers.</p>

<p>With fishermen falling on their knees, the fishing boats were swept along by
the power of the tide alone. The big seine sagged, pulled the boats slowly
together.</p>

<p>The glowing glass fish again was sinking.</p>

<p>Lapp fishermen flung themselves on their faces. They were awed to
speechlessness.</p>

<p>Three prongs were sweeping into the fjord at incredible speed. Their
mirrored eyes were absorbing power from the uncanny light.</p>

<p>Without pausing, the strange undersea craft ripped into the great seine. The
deep net was torn loose from its cables. The folds of tarred cords wrapped
around the long hull of the pronged submarine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXII. HORNS OFF THE DEVIL</h2>

<p>ONLY a few times had Doc Savage ever given up any of his men as lost. But if
he had not abandoned all hope for Monk, the bronze man was unusually
saddened.</p>

<p>He could see that blue glowing fish of glass sinking deeper into half a mile
of icy sea.</p>

<p>"I have come upon things which the most credulous would refuse to believe,"
stated Knut Aage. "My own condition was a part of it. After being trapped in
the ice caverns under the Jostedalsbrae, I was made unconscious. You did not
have time to observe the scar at the back of my neck?"</p>

<p>"I have now seen it," stated Doc. "The mysterious nerves governing bodily
temperature and the heart pulse have been changed by surgical skill."</p>

<p>"I have not known what it was," said Knut Aage. "I seemed to go into a
strange trance. Since then, I have no sensation of heat or cold. I can think
how I want to move, but I can do it only with great caution. All of my muscles
are sluggish."</p>

<p>"You saw others in the ice caverns perhaps?" inquired Doc.</p>

<p>"I saw several who were prisoners, and apparently two crowds of men opposing
each other," stated Knut Aage. "There are those of my own race. Some are
Orientals who take commands from two persons. One is this Kama who was in the
stavekirker. I do not know the other."</p>

<p>"And the prisoners?" suggested Doc. "Was there one who seemed like a
skeleton?"</p>

<p>"I recall him," said Knut Aage. "A man with a scholarly face, but very tall
and thin. He was with an Englishman and four others."</p>

<p>"Johnny," said Doc. "He's William Harper Littlejohn. He is one of a war
commission of six that had disappeared."</p>

<p>Knut Aage frowned deeply.</p>

<p>"That is very bad," he said. "For these six are chained on a rock shelf in
the cavern known as the Place of the Glacial Death. Once each year, at this
season, the old Jostedalsbrae pushes a wall of ice through the cavern. This
extends over a deep underground fjord."</p>

<p>"You mean this finger of the glacier fills the cavern?"</p>

<p>"Exactly that," said Knut Aage. "Thousands of tons of ice scour that wall
where the prisoners are chained. It comes each year."</p>

<p>"But what could be the purpose of exterminating the men of the war
commission?"</p>

<p>"I learned little of that before I was trapped," said Knut Aage. "It
concerns this one they call the Man of Peace. His brain alone holds knowledge
of the power of this artificial daylight. Another is seeking the full
knowledge. I understand the Man of Peace does not desire to kill needlessly.
But he has been told all prisoners will be crushed to death a slow inch at a
time by the glacial push if he does not reveal all of his secret."</p>

<p>"But your escape was unusual, Knut Aage."</p>

<p>"I think I was set afloat and brought back to the fishing village as a final
stroke of terror to drive all of the fishermen from this vicinity," stated Knut
Aage.</p>

<p>"I fear," stated Doc, "that others of my men are now there. I shall not ask
you to guide me to these caverns, but I must go there."</p>

<p>A grim smile crossed Knut Aage's white face.</p>

<p>"You do not have to ask, Doc Savage," he said. "You cannot prevent my
accompanying you. Hjalmar Landson, who informed me you would come, was my
brother in the blood. His death must be avenged. I have received a mysterious
communication, Doc Savage. It informs me this woman of the flaming hair who was
with you in the slavekirker was Hjalmar Landson's murderess."</p>

<p>"Others have been convinced of that same thing," advised Doc. "But you will
do well to investigate thoroughly before you act."</p>

<p>"I never act upon an unproved report or even my own unverified opinion, Doc
Savage."</p>

<p>"I had judged you that way--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE two men were at the edge of the great glacier. They were making their
way slowly back toward the fishing village. Knut Aage was impeded by the
sluggishness of his muscles.</p>

<p>The uncanny daylight flooded the mountains.</p>

<p>"If there were only some way we might enter the caverns without being
observed," Knut Aage had just suggested.</p>

<p>Doc's fantastic trilling filled the icy air.</p>

<p>"If the light of the peace power will persist for only a few hours, there
may be a way," he stated. "Come with me, Knut Aage. That plane in which Kama
arrived must now be equipped with power."</p>

<p>The mystery plane still was wedged in the cleft of the rock. Knut Aage
watched the play of Doc Savage's corded bronze arms. The facile fingers were
examining the parts of the strange motor connection.</p>

<p>"I believe we now shall have the means we seek," stated Doc.</p>

<p>The plane's two propellers were whispering, turning. There was no sound of
an exploding motor. Only the low humming of powerful electrical motors. The
selenium cells apparently were releasing or transmitting the amazing energy of
the daylight.</p>

<p>Doc Savage swung the plane onto the sweeping tide of the fjord. He turned
the streamlined fuselage with its nose to the wind of the mountains.</p>

<p>The ship shot toward the open sea. Knut Aage grasped Doc's arm.</p>

<p>"Look below!" he shouted. "It's the undersea devil my men have feared! It's
one of the craft of the Man of Peace! Those horned prongs are its only
power!"</p>

<p>"If the prongs were removed, it would not sink," stated Doc.</p>

<p>"No, but it would be powerless," stated Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"That would be one group less of the enemy to combat," said the man of
bronze.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE strangely powered plane dived with shrieking wings. It skimmed the
fjord. Its pontoons clipped into the speeding prongs.</p>

<p>Doc Savage and Knut Aage had only a flashing glimpse of what might have been
a writhing, distorted monster just under the surface of the green water.</p>

<p>Whatever its motive power, the propellers of the mystic submarine had ceased
to beat. The impelling force of the white daylight had been severed. The craft
was perhaps sixty or seventy feet in length.</p>

<p>Doc's trained senses took in more details than Knut Aage. With its
remarkable horns clipped, the vessel was not rising to the surface.</p>

<p>The devil's own blast of wind howled and shrieked in the canyon of the
fjord.</p>

<p>"We cannot reverse here," stated Doc. "We will swing outside the walls and
return."</p>

<p>"That flood tide has tremendous force," said Knut Aage. "Likely the vessel
will be dashed upon the rocks."</p>

<p>"I had thought of that," said Doc. "We will attempt to get back in time to
rescue the crew from drowning."</p>

<p>The screaming wind on the plane's tail projected it over the sea of the wide
channel outside the cliffs.</p>

<p>Two black fishing schooners leaped into view. Their crews were like
struggling knots of puppets. They were hauling in the tangled wreckage of a
great seine.</p>

<p>"You see, Doc Savage, the men of that submarine are ruthless enough,"
pointed Knut Aage. "They have torn away a seine which was the result of a year
of effort."</p>

<p>The bite of the plane's props was tremendous, but not enough to give it
speed. That mountain wind was a blast of more than gale intensity. Doc glided
to the fjord. He permitted the flood tide to catch the pontoons.</p>

<p>"They'll not have a chance if the submarine strikes," said Knut Aage. "It
will sink immediately."</p>

<p>But the dehorned monster of the sea had not sunk. It was a mile or more from
the plane when it was shot into a slanting scar of the cliff. This break led
into the trail mounting to the Jostedalsbrae glacier.</p>

<p>What served as a conning tower must have opened. The half dozen figures
emerging were mere specks at that distance. They were in flight toward the
great glacier.</p>

<p>"We could ascend and trap them easily," suggested Knut Aage. "They will be
many hours making their way back to the ice caverns over the
Jostedalsbrae."</p>

<p>"Time is more valuable for other purposes," stated Doc. "The submarine
appears to be undamaged. The few hours they require to reach the ice caverns of
Satan's Gateway must be employed."</p>

<p>"But what can be done with the helpless vessel?" said Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"That remains to be determined," advised Doc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE pointed snout of the submarine rested easily in the rocks. The craft
might have been a stranded aluminum fish. Four jagged sprouts showed where the
plane's pontoons had sheered off the prongs.</p>

<p>Doc whipped from the plane into the door of the conning tower. Knut Aage
followed more slowly. When the Norwegian got inside, the amazing bronze man
already had a wrench in his hand.</p>

<p>Multiple coils of pipe lined the sides of the forward chamber. Below them
were geared motors. The boxing of a propeller shaft extended through the lower
floor of the sub.</p>

<p>"This is one of the most intricate vessels I have ever seen," stated Doc.
"It has many principles that will some day be applied to all undersea boats.
Beside the daylight power, there are auxiliary engines for motive force when
the prongs would be submerged."</p>

<p>"And they were trapped by the rush of the tide before they could get them in
operation," stated Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Doc. "Perhaps the crew feared our return. They would have
expected to be attacked with bombs before they could get out of the fjord."</p>

<p>Doc was disconnecting the broken prongs inside the submarine. Knut Aage
explored through several bulkheaded compartments.</p>

<p>Doc Savage had been working with great haste. He started outside toward the
moored plane. His purpose had not been clear to Knut Aage.</p>

<p>Knut Aage was near the middle of the sub. Doc heard him call out
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage! Here's something!"</p>

<p>The man of bronze whipped back into the craft. A central compartment looked
as if it might have been a torpedo room. But there were no torpedoes.
Iron-clamped doors showed where there must be openings for leaving and entering
when submerged.</p>

<p>In the middle of this room lay the glass fish. It's tubes still glowed with
blue phosphorescence. The sliding door was open. Doc breathed with relief.</p>

<p>"They have got Monk and Lora Krants," he stated. "Strands of the big fish
seine are hanging onto the hull. It must have caught the cylinder as it was
sinking."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FROM what appeared to be an outer air chamber came a thudding knock. It was
like a man's head being butted against a wall. It was a head, Monk's.</p>

<p>Doc snapped off the clamps and the figure of the apelike chemist rolled out.
Monk had not been bound. He scrambled to his feet. His hairy throat heaved as
he pulled in fresh air.</p>

<p>"A couple more minutes and I'd been through breathing," gasped the chemist.
"Them dag-goned devils meant to suffocate me! And that redhead is nothing but a
sneaky double-crosser! Doc, them men took to her like she was a queen or
something. I told you she was crooked."</p>

<p>"What happened?" said Doc quietly.</p>

<p>"The glass fish got caught in a seine with a lot of other fish," said Monk.
"We were dragged up and then we went down. The oxygen tanks were empty. After a
while, we passed out. And I'd got to kinda believin' that red-headed dame was
on the square."</p>

<p>"An' then what happens?" squealed Monk. "Next thing we're being rolled outta
the glass fish. Them devils runnin' this boat act like they think the redhead
is a princess. I don't know what she told them. They were them fellows running
around without any clothes."</p>

<p>"You think perhaps they might have identified Lora Krants?" said Doc.</p>

<p>"Dang it, Doc, they almost kissed her!" exploded Monk. "Then they got off in
a corner and talked among themselves. I tried to horn in and a couple of 'em
grabbed me. The redhead must have told them what to do. So they crammed me into
that hole in the wall."</p>

<p>"It does seem peculiar," admitted Doc. "But we have work to do. Monk,
scramble around and pipe a new hook-over from their air-chamber pumps. I
believe we can charge our compressed air tanks. You will find several oxygen
tanks aboard. Substitute those for the empties in the cylinder."</p>

<p>Doc went outside. Knut Aage watched him in amazement. The bronze man had
disconnected the power prongs from the plane. He brought them into the
submarine.</p>

<p>"I never would have thought of that," said Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"They have been made standard size," said Doc. "Their seating is the same on
both sets of light cells. We will soon have the power to reach Satan's Gateway,
if the daylight is kept on."</p>

<p>If haggard prisoners in the Place of the Glacial Death could have known of
Doc's intention, their spirits might not have been so low.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII. THE CRUSHING DEATH</h2>

<p>SIR ARTHUR WESTCOTT'S mustache had become scraggly. The usually
imperturbable Englishman gnawed at its straggling ends.</p>

<p>"By jove!" he exclaimed. "When they find out what these bally blighters have
been up to, there probably will be a war! Nobody can kick one of His Majesty's
subjects around like this!"</p>

<p>The usually dignified Englishman had lost all of his calmness. His wrists
were locked in manacles. These were fastened to short iron chains stapled into
a rock wall.</p>

<p>"Indubitably an international complication will eventuate," drawled the
voice of the skeletonlike figure chained beside Sir Arthur. "It is extremely
doubtful, however, if it will provide any insuperable obstacle to the
irresistible pressure of glacial erosion. While they are summoning conferences,
we will have become particles of infinitesimal indifference to diplomatic
processes."</p>

<p>The four other members of the international war commission made no comment.
Their English had its limitations.</p>

<p>If Johnny had said, "Before Great Britain can start a war, we will be ground
to bits by that ice wall," they would have understood.</p>

<p>Johnny was a woeful object. The six temporary statesmen of the great nation
were a haggard lot.</p>

<p>This speech took place at about the time Doc Savage was getting the conning
tower of the light-powered submarine closed. Johnny's faith in the man of
bronze was now expressed. He reverted to short words.</p>

<p>"My hope lies in Doc Savage," he said. "Something tells me Doc isn't far
away."</p>

<p>The other members of the war commission were hunched in a strained position
on a narrow shelf. Back of them the wall oozed cold moisture. Overhead a
smooth, vaulted roof bore the scored marks of eroding ice.</p>

<p>Where their chains were attached to the wall, there were gouged grooves.
Even the narrow shelf on which they were situated was a scar left in the hard,
black rock by thousands of tons of grinding ice.</p>

<p>"By jove, old fellow!" spouted Sir Arthur. "You have a great eye! The bally
wall seems to be slipping!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE wall was a solid, towering face of a creeping finger of the great
glacier. It was pushing through a cleft cut in past centuries. It was like the
glittering head of a slowly moving piston. This filled all of the cavern at one
end.</p>

<p>In the other direction a series of passages showed. All of the inner caverns
had been continuously lighted by the uncanny daylight power. Some fifty feet
below the narrow shelf was clear, deep water.</p>

<p>Johnny and the others had been brought here in one of the pronged undersea
boats. This submarine passed back and forth often. Johnny had judged there were
at least three of these submarines. One had only three prongs, having been
partly dehorned by a British gun.</p>

<p>"That ice is moving now at the rate of about a foot an hour," stated Johnny.
"When it happens it won't be over with quickly."</p>

<p>This was an unpleasant thought.</p>

<p>The gleaming ice completely filled the space from side to side.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FOUR prongs swam into the fjord. They had come from the inner caverns. As
nearly as Johnny could judge, the strange daylight emanated from some source
farther under the mountain. The geologist could occasionally catch the low,
vibrant humming of machinery.</p>

<p>The submarine emerged close to the shelf. The conning tower opened. Half a
dozen dark-skinned men came out. They were pushing prisoners ahead of them.</p>

<p>"Renny!" shouted Johnny. "Long Tom! Ham! Sir Arthur, I told you Doc Savage
would be along!"</p>

<p>With these three of Doc's men were Larrone, and Barton, the heavy-browed
brother of Lora Krants. They were shoved to the narrow shelf. Skin thongs were
exchanged for the iron manacles chained to the wall.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exploded Renny. "How'd you come here, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Same way you did, I imagine," replied Johnny. "Where's Doc?"</p>

<p>There was a minute of silence. None of the new arrivals spoke.</p>

<p>"You don't mean something's happened to Doc?" demanded Johnny.</p>

<p>Then Renny exploded irately, "Well, if anything did, it's that red-headed
dame again! The last we saw of Doc, he was trying to save her from a crowd of
naked guys who didn't have any blood! I saw Doc and Monk go down under a whole
bunch, and then we were grabbed!"</p>

<p>Renny always took a gloomy view of things. Ham was more cheerful.</p>

<p>"And by this time, I'll bet whoever landed on Doc is wishing he hadn't,"
said the lawyer. "We were brought a long way to get in here and Doc might be
any place by this time."</p>

<p>"By jove!" exclaimed Sir Arthur. "I was of the opinion your Doc Savage could
not cope with these blighters!"</p>

<p>"Whoever you are then," observed Ham, scathingly, "your opinions aren't
worth ten cents a dozen! You don't know Doc Savage."</p>

<p>Kama's dark-skinned men returned to the pronged submarine. The strange craft
submerged. The prongs passed directly under the arching wall of the glacial
crusher.</p>

<p>"If only that ice would let go right now, it would suit me fine," said
Johnny. "Brothers, it looks like we're going to discover what it would be like
to go through a slow-motion meat grinder."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE movement of the ice wall was slow, but its progress was certain. Already
a section of the narrow shelf on which they were chained was being ground to
atoms.</p>

<p>The gleaming, blue wall was like a great knife pushed by a mountain. Sir
Arthur Westcott was closest to the creeping death. Next to him was Johnny.
Beyond were the others.</p>

<p>The usually sartorially perfect Ham was a sad-looking human. But he
maintained a light tone.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I'd never figured when my time came they'd have to move a whole
mountain," he commented. "Maybe we'll get a break, though. One gang headed by
this fellow Kama, from San Tao, is fighting that Norwegian crowd. They had one
jam on the glacier. If they get together down here, it might help."</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Westcott gnawed at his mustache. The creeping wall was barely six
feet away. The solid wall trembled. A part of the narrow shelf split off. It
left scarcely two feet to where Sir Arthur was huddled.</p>

<p>"I'm jolly well glad," remarked the Englishman, "I'll be the first to
go."</p>

<p>He didn't look jolly well glad. Johnny scowled at him.</p>

<p>The others were getting the picture. They would be crushed slowly. One by
one they would go. First the ice would touch. Then its weight would begin
pushing.</p>

<p>The prisoner would strain away in his manacles. The chains would hold him
against the ice. His body would be pressed the fraction of an inch at a time
between the wall and the glacier.</p>

<p>"But have you discovered, Johnny, what the purpose of all this might be?"
said Ham. "If either of these crowds wants us out of the way, it would have
been much simpler to have put us out quick. Or do you suppose we are being used
in some way to bring pressure upon Doc to lay off?"</p>

<p>"It might be that," stated Johnny. "We have learned enough to know there is
some strange power of light. In some manner, the war commission was about to
interfere. But I don't understand this slow-torture angle."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IF the chained prisoners could have been in a mammoth inner cavern, they
might have understood the purpose of the horrible, creeping death by the
glacier ice. This apparently did not concern any pressure to be brought upon
Doc Savage.</p>

<p>The greatest cavern of all was at the end of a connected series. The
passages leading inward were partly of clear blue ice and partly of black
rock.</p>

<p>In the midst of this room sat a man who, when younger must have been a
magnificent figure. His thick hair, now snowily white, was in shaggy confusion
around a rugged, wrinkled face. Before him on a wall was a panel containing a
number of spread charts.</p>

<p>The man was following lines on these charts with a slender steel pointer. As
the pointer moved, his lips murmured.</p>

<p>"Each man to his own country," he was saying. "Press of population brings
wars. Conquest must cease. Each nation must develop and exist by its own
resources within its own boundaries."</p>

<p>The steel pointer swung.</p>

<p>"Conquest, always conquest!" the man murmured. "I have but to move one
finger and it will cease. In this way only, can war be ended. Only my own craft
and my own air force shall have the secret of moving by the light of
peace."</p>

<p>In towering columns of some transparent substance varicolored lights spit
and crackled. Many giant tubes converged on conductors which seemed to project
through the roof into outside space.</p>

<p>The white-haired giant spoke louder. While his sunken eyes held a fanatical
gleam, his voice was gentle, kindly.</p>

<p>"Some may die, but it is best, for I shall save the world from wholesale
murder. And all of this shall be for peace. Peace for the whole world!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ANOTHER voice spoke with a high, sarcastic inflection. The owner of this
voice was invisible. Apparently he was standing somewhere outside the mammoth
room of the peace power. Perhaps he was speaking into a conductor.</p>

<p>Around this second speaker other men must have been assembled. Movement of
bodies, muttered words could be detected.</p>

<p>"I have come for an answer," spoke this voice. "Your ideas of peace for the
world are all a very fine theory. But we will not go on until you have imparted
full knowledge of both the positive and negative light rays."</p>

<p>The white-haired giant laughed softly to himself.</p>

<p>"What I have given a lifetime to learn is only for myself to know," he
replied. "I am not deceived. You already have bartered to sell this power. But
none may purchase that which you do not possess. Without the key, you are
helpless."</p>

<p>The other voice laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"The time has come for a showdown, Man of Peace," spoke the voice. "I have
waited until now. I will wait no longer. The precious war commission which you
intended to instruct has been put in the Place of the Glacial Death. Within
another few hours, the representatives of the greatest nations will be crushed
slowly to pulp!"</p>

<p>The white-haired giant jerked to his feet. His big hands trembled. There was
now anger in his voice.</p>

<p>"You have gone too far!" he rapped out. "None is to die, as you were
instructed! You cannot compel me to do your bidding! I will summon my men!"</p>

<p>"You may summon them in vain," mocked the other voice. "Do you imagine I
have been so foolish as not to prepare? Look around you. Then, if you think it
is wise, summon your men."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE sunken eyes of the white-haired giant turned slowly.</p>

<p>In the several doors of the mammoth room stood armed figures. All of these
men were short and dark-skinned.</p>

<p>"But you cannot do this! One of our purposes was preservation of the white
race--"</p>

<p>The white-haired giant was raging now.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," mocked the outside voice. "It is already done. We have
possession of one of the subs. Your men without blood have another. The third
will return presently. It will be seized as it enters Satan's Gateway. We shall
take possession of all the machinery. If you desire this war commission to
survive, you will impart complete information."</p>

<p>"You condemn these innocent men to death for your own petty purpose?"
shouted the white-haired giant.</p>

<p>"Petty purpose hardly describes it," said the voice. "One Oriental province
alone has offered one hundred millions. There are twelve other foreign bidders.
The power will bring five hundred millions before we have finished."</p>

<p>There was the clicking as if a switch had been pulled. In front of the
white-haired giant a dark panel glowed with purple light. Living figures leaped
into the square.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," rasped the voice. "Not only are some there of
the war commission, but there are others. Once you had a very great friend they
call Doc Savage. Perhaps you would like to see four of his men crushed by the
Glacial Death? And Doc Savage himself already has died."</p>

<p>The big hands of the white-haired giant moved helplessly, as if he would
push away the vision in the glass. The television showed the narrow shelf of
the Place of the Glacial Death.</p>

<p>The blue wall of ice was slivering. Pieces were falling. Tons of crushing
force were sliding along the shelf. Stone was being reduced to pulpy powder. A
mustached figure--Sir Arthur Westcott, of Great Britain--was pulling at chains
holding him to iron pegs in the wall above the shelf.</p>

<p>The face of the living glacier was hardly more than a foot from the
Britisher's writhing body. The faces of the other prisoners were mirrors of
stark horror.</p>

<p>The mocking voice said, "One by one, the others will see what it is like for
living flesh and bone to be pinched, ground slowly to bloody nothing. Each one
will die slowly. He will fight his chains, but before those iron pegs could be
torn out, his body will be in fragments. Is it not a nice picture?"</p>

<p>"You arch-fiend of hell!" shouted the white-haired giant. "I shall destroy
all--I shall--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE deeply sunken eyes were staring at the shelf of horror in the
television. But those orbs were fixed more upon one figure than any other. It
was the dark-browed brother of Lora Krants. Into the sunken eyes crept slow,
desperate anguish. It was succeeded by cunning.</p>

<p>One hand of the white-haired giant moved.</p>

<p>"Do not do that!" rapped out a closer voice. "If you touch anything, you
will die instantly! We shall at least have the power as it is! No doubt, we can
discover the full knowledge we seek!"</p>

<p>Rifles pointed at the white-haired giant. This new speaker was Kama, of San
Tao. His teeth flashed in a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>The white-haired giant refrained from touching the levers. He must have
realized that his own death would not save those in the glacial chamber.</p>

<p>But the giant was sliding one foot slowly forward. It touched a contact. The
Man of Peace undoubtedly had prepared for just such an emergency. At the same
time, he bowed his head as if resigned.</p>

<p>"What do you hope to gain by assisting a traitor?" he said to Kama. "He will
sell to the highest bidder, if he learns all he must know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be the highest bidder," suggested Kama with a smile. "If
not, then the amount shall be great enough to make the sharing of it worth
while."</p>

<p>The white-haired giant had apparently touched nothing. But from some
distance underground came a humming throb of power.</p>

<p>The voice outside spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Look out, Kama! We have been tricked! Have your men seize him! He has
summoned the other submarine!"</p>

<p>The white-haired Man of Peace laughed loudly, suddenly, horribly. His great
figure plunged forward. His hands were thrust toward the levers. Kama's nearest
men moved with the quickness of striking cobras.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IN the Place of the Glacial Death, Sir Arthur Westcott had ceased speaking.
Though the temperature was far below freezing, the sweat was popping on his
reddened, desperate face. Liquid ran from the corners of his mouth, dripping
from the ends of his gnawed mustache.</p>

<p>The British statesman had virtually ceased to "carry on." His teeth had
chewed his lower lip to red fragments. Now he could have moved his head and
touched the face of the living glacier.</p>

<p>The crushing, slow death was only inches away.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Westcott had perhaps half an hour, a little more or a little
less, before his body would begin to flatten, to dissolve, between the pinch of
the glacier and black rock.</p>

<p>"Look!" grated Ham. "Maybe, after all, we'll get a break!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV. BATTLE OF THE MONSTERS</h2>

<p>INTO the blue water below the narrow shelf moved two sets of objects. Each
of these consisted of four prongs. They entered from opposite ends of the
glacial cavern. They were moving at high speed.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "They're going to smash each other!"</p>

<p>But the commanders of the peace power submarines were too skillful to risk
collision. Like horns of submerged monsters, the prongs ceased moving. Around
the silvery crafts just under the surface the water boiled.</p>

<p>"They're coming up!" said Long Tom. "Now what do you suppose we're in
for?"</p>

<p>The sleek, shining bodies rolled to the surface together. As they emerged,
two conning towers opened noiselessly. Men poured onto the backs of the boats
from these.</p>

<p>All those who appeared carried rifles. The guns started snapping almost
before members of the crews had regained their balance.</p>

<p>Leaden slugs buzzed like bees in the echoing caverns. The slight explosions
were sufficient to cause sharp, crackling reports from the living face of the
glacier.</p>

<p>"Good grief!" rapped Ham. "They're bumping each other off! It is a
break!"</p>

<p>"It might be well to point out just where we will benefit," said Johnny.
"Suppose they keep that up? When they've finished, then where will we be?"</p>

<p>His questions were logical. On the rounded back of one horned sub were the
nearly naked figures of giant Norwegians. These undoubtedly were the loyal
adherents of the white-haired one who called himself the Man of Peace.</p>

<p>On the other craft were the dark-skinned Orientals. Owing to the limited
movement from the conning towers, they were for the moment evenly matched.</p>

<p>A huge Norwegian received a bullet in his hairy breast. Without a sound, he
pitched into the underground current. His body rolled over. It disappeared.</p>

<p>The following Norwegian pierced the skull of the Oriental who had killed the
first man. The little Oriental splashed into the water. A red blotch stained
the spot where he disappeared.</p>

<p>The Norwegian who killed him was next to go.</p>

<p>Four men had been killed on each sub before a command was given. The
Orientals faded back into the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" growled Renny. "I thought those dark-skinned guys had more guts
than that! They're still even and they quit!"</p>

<p>"I have an idea that if we have any chance at all, it lies with the naked
blond fellows," said Ham. "But the little dark chaps don't quit like that for
nothing."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>HAM'S opinion was quickly substantiated. With the cessation of shooting, the
white bodies of the Norwegians became more numerous. There were more than a
score crowding the back of their craft.</p>

<p>"That's idiotic," surmised the wise Johnny. "I'll bet the dark guys are
playing just for that."</p>

<p>From the conning tower of the Oriental submarine racketed a weapon. But this
was no cracking rifle. The high, deadly chatter was like the hammering of a
riveting machine.</p>

<p>The result was ghastly.</p>

<p>Dead men slid from the Norwegian submarine into the underground sea. Some
lived long enough to writhe with agony on the sloping deck before they slid
off. The men on the narrow shelf stared helplessly at the massacre.</p>

<p>The Norwegian deck was swept clear. Only two men lay draped across the
rounded surface. The machine gun still hammered at the conning tower. A slow,
heavy voice spoke a command.</p>

<p>Air hissed in the cavern. The water bubbled. The iron port of the conning
tower started to close. One of the men on the deck moved. He got to his feet
and lurched forward. Already the tanks of the submarine were filling.</p>

<p>The craft was submerging. The wounded Norwegian pitched toward the closing
iron port. His head and shoulders were thrust through.</p>

<p>Then he screamed with agony. The closing iron was pinching his bared torso.
Excited voices yammered inside the sub. Evidently an effort was made to reverse
the submerging operations.</p>

<p>The order came too late.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "They're going under with that conning hatch
open!"</p>

<p>The sleek, horned vessel dipped beneath the surface. Water gurgled past the
wounded man wedged in the port of the hatchway. Someone attempted to open the
door and release the body. The underground sea poured in with a flood.</p>

<p>Oil sprinkled with air bubbles oiled the surface. Into this heads began to
pop up. Evidently the Norwegians still in the submarine were making their final
desperate fight to live.</p>

<p>Already, the silvery craft was beyond the view of the prisoners on the
narrow shelf. The water here apparently was of great depths. More than a dozen
heads came into view.</p>

<p>On the side of the cavern opposite the high, narrow shelf was a broader
ledge at nearly the level of the water. The swimming Norwegians made for this
refuge.</p>

<p>Above them, the Oriental undersea craft swung slowly broadside. The snout of
the machine gun poked out.</p>

<p>"Good grief!" barked Ham. "The devils couldn't do that!"</p>

<p>But the dark men had no compunction. The machine gun weaved slowly. Fire
sliced from the muzzle.</p>

<p>Lead pattered along the water. The slugs skipped and danced among the
bobbing heads. One by one, the skulls were filled with round blue holes. Some
were split open, as more than one bullet found its mark.</p>

<p>The bare arms of the Norwegians beat the surface hopelessly.</p>

<p>The prisoners groaned in unison. The last bobbing head had been punctured.
The last white hand had flashed up, then followed a body to the bottom.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE uncanny, white daylight continued to flood the interior of the Place of
the Glacial Death. The submarine of the Orientals swung on the surface.</p>

<p>Kama, of San Tao, stepped forth. His teeth flashed in a cheerful smile. He
seemed immensely pleased with the amusement his men had been given. He looked
up at the prisoners. He probably had as much feeling for them as he would have
had for a similar number of flies pinned on a wall.</p>

<p>"There is one among you who can influence the Man of Peace," said Kama. "We
have not been informed who this fortunate individual may be. But the Man of
Peace has betrayed himself. If that one of you will make himself known, he will
be released and taken to the inner cavern."</p>

<p>Doc's men stared at each other. Sir Arthur Westcott had ceased fighting his
chains. The ice was still moving slowly, inexorably.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the living glacier itself gave the Englishman a reprieve for the
time being. Perhaps it had been the shooting. A great corner cracked from the
ice wall and crashed into the water below. It opened a space of perhaps two
feet close to the shelf.</p>

<p>At the rate the glacier was moving, that might mean another hour before the
first victim would be crushed.</p>

<p>The prisoners were saying nothing. They were waiting for one to reply to the
Kama.</p>

<p>It was the dark-browed brother of Lora Krants who spoke.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am the one you mean," he said. "I am not saying this to save
myself."</p>

<p>"Then you know the Man of Peace?" said Kama. "That, indeed, is most
strange."</p>

<p>"I am the one," repeated Barton Krants.</p>

<p>Two of Kama's men ascended the narrow shelf. The manacles of the youth's
wrists were unlocked. They lowered him to the sloping deck of the sub.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" rasped Renny. "I knew it all the time! An' that red-headed
dame's another one of them!"</p>

<p>But the eyes of the others were snapped away from the dark-browed Barton
Krants.</p>

<p>The four prongs of another peace power submarine were gliding into the
cavern. The four mirrored horns seemed like the head of some stalking beast of
prey. Kama uttered a curse in his own language.</p>

<p>Barton Krants was shoved quickly into the conning tower of the Orientals'
submarine. Kama ordered his other men below. The Oriental potentate, if that
was what he claimed to be, no longer was smiling.</p>

<p>Commands flowed from his lips in the language of San Tao.</p>

<p>Johnny, alone of the prisoners, could understand the words.</p>

<p>"Prepare to attack, but we must preserve this submarine!" directed Kama. "It
would be well to riddle their power projectors with shot! Then they will come
to the surface."</p>

<p>The Orientals were bringing their machine gun into position.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE four prongs of the new submarine slackened their speed. The craft had
been heading directly for the glacial finger where it extended into the cave.
There was considerable space between this ice and the water.</p>

<p>The glacier's weight was supported by its own thickness and its crowding of
the upper walls.</p>

<p>"This sub has also lost one of its eyes," remarked Johnny. "The mirror, or
whatever it is, has been taken out."</p>

<p>The four prongs came to a complete stop. The silver craft was motionless.
Its sleek sides could be seen a few feet below the surface. Three of the
light-gathering lenses were shining.</p>

<p>But the fourth prong seemed to be an eye socket with an empty hole.</p>

<p>"It may be they are using that prong for a periscope," suggested Ham. "There
doesn't seem to be any other device for observation."</p>

<p>In this he was incorrect. The craft was equipped with something better than
a periscope. The observer inside could survey the outside for a long distance.
The device was something on the order of a television arrangement. And it could
also bring to view the interior of another vessel.</p>

<p>"Perforate the projecting inductors!" commanded Kama.</p>

<p>The machine gun was aimed at the four prongs. An Oriental tripped the
trigger.</p>

<p>A stream of slugs skipped the water. They slapped around the prongs. Some
bullets pinged off the gleaming metal, but apparently did no great damage.</p>

<p>"Aim for the lenses!" yelled Kama. "Smash them! The Norwegians will be
forced out!"</p>

<p>"Good grief!" groaned Renny. "We're about to witness another bloody
slaughter!"</p>

<p>The machine gun was lifted. Slugs buzzed around the shining mirrors of the
horns.</p>

<p>Then from the prong with the missing lens curled a yellow wisp of smoke.
Puffs came from behind it. The vapor mushroomed and spread rapidly. Apparently
it was coming from the craft with the force of a pump behind it.</p>

<p>The prongs vanished in a cloud. The machine gun's stream searched for the
target. But there was only the spreading cloud of yellow vapor.</p>

<p>Kama yelled, "Get inside! This is something new! Where did those Norwegians
get it? It may be poison gas!"</p>

<p>The machine gunners ceased firing. The Orientals scrambled for their conning
tower hatchway.</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to bet a million against a thin dime that it's nobody but--"
Ham started to say.</p>

<p>Then a scared Oriental poked his face from the conning tower. He yammered
excitedly at Kama. But there were two words for which there seemed no
equivalent in the language of San Tao.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage! Doc Savage!"</p>

<p>Kama slapped his hands together and swore vilely. The other craft was hidden
by the yellow smoke-screen. Kama followed his men into the conning tower.</p>

<p>"I told you, Sir Arthur, Doc would be around," drawled Johnny.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXV. UNDER THE ICE</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE glided from the big retort that had been converted into a
smoke-screen pot. This chemical container had been ingeniously connected with
the open inductor prong from which the lens had been removed.</p>

<p>"Monk, have you got the connection for that extra air compressor tank?" said
the man of bronze.</p>

<p>Monk was engaged in mixing half a dozen chemicals in metal containers. The
apelike chemist had seemed to forget their mission and all of its danger. For
they had discovered a completely outfitted laboratory aboard the mystery craft
of the peace power.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Doc," stated Monk, "I've got the compression and the hook-up. All I
need to do now is slip the acid into this mess. And when it starts spouting,
there won't be any doubt about this being Satan's Gateway. It'll probably be
hotter'n that."</p>

<p>"Then we are going under the ice of that glacial finger," stated Doc. "I
estimate we have perhaps half an hour to discover what lies beyond. By that
time, the glacier will be carrying out the terrible purpose for which the
prisoners have been chained to the wall."</p>

<p>"But Doc," said Monk. "Why couldn't we pull up there and free all of them
right now?"</p>

<p>"Because we probably would be overtaken by the same fate that wiped out the
Norwegians on that other sub," stated Doc. "Perhaps not all of our enemies are
in the craft with Kama. We are opposing forces about which we are not familiar.
This daylight power now is on. If it should be switched off, it is possible we
should fail."</p>

<p>Doc had the prongs moving under the ice. The craft was headed for the inner
caverns.</p>

<p>"The other craft is pursuing us, Doc Savage," stated the voice of Knut Aage.
"Kama is driving directly toward us at high speed. He will ram this vessel if
he gets the chance."</p>

<p>"I had judged he would make that mistake," advised Doc. "Monk, release the
outside port of the exit chamber. The stuff is ready."</p>

<p>Monk's nubbin of a head bobbed. He scuttled to a lever. In the special
periscopic device, Knut Aage was watching the slender needle of Kama's
submarine shooting toward them. Its prow was in the form of a pointed ram.</p>

<p>Monk pushed the lever. Immediately the clear, green water around them took
on a purplish color. This deepened. It became an intense black. Though their
own visibility ahead was not lessened, behind them the channel became a vast
pool of ink.</p>

<p>"Their craft has disappeared, Doc Savage," said Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"And for the present, we are lost to their view," stated Doc. "You say the
chamber of the light is at the end of this cavern channel?"</p>

<p>"It is there the Man of Peace controls the destinies of this power," said
Knut Aage.</p>

<p>"We shall proceed there," stated Doc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>KAMA stood at the periscope device in his submarine. He had ordered full
speed ahead, despite the danger of crashing a wall. His purpose was to ram the
submarine carrying Doc Savage.</p>

<p>Then the underground sea was blackened. Visibility and direction became
confused. Strangely enough, Kama could still observe Doc Savage and the others
inside their craft, but steering a direct course had become impossible.</p>

<p>Kama released a flood of Oriental curses. Then his teeth flashed in an evil
smile.</p>

<p>"We will take the passage of the short cut!" he ordered.</p>

<p>The prongs of Kama's submarine immediately swerved from the channel. Slow
speed was ordered. The craft nosed slowly along the wall. In a few minutes, the
craft swung off under the mountain glacier.</p>

<p>"We shall arrive at the cavern of light ahead of this bronze man of magic,"
stated Kama. "And we shall be ready to receive him."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>AHEAD of Doc Savage's submarine loomed the entrance to the cavern of light.
A queer, pink radiance bathed shallow steps cut from the water into the mammoth
room.</p>

<p>"Keep close watch, Monk," directed Doc. "I shall investigate."</p>

<p>The ballast chambers boiled. The power craft slowly came to the surface. Doc
Savage opened the conning tower hatchway and emerged.</p>

<p>Monk was grumbling. He was beside Knut Aage at the observing device. Kama's
submarine had not again come into view.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it, Doc," yelped Monk, "I don't like this! Maybe that heathen got
lost in that ink an' maybe he didn't! It's too danged quiet to suit me!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage did not reply. He was moving along the sleek back of the
submarine. Its prow touched the shallow stone steps.</p>

<p>From the lighted mammoth room came the low humming of some kind of
machinery. There was a hissing and bubbling. This was like liquids gurgling in
great retorts.</p>

<p>Doc Savage stepped lightly to the first of the shallow stairs.</p>

<p>From this position, his vision swept the interior of the great cavern. The
bronze man's remarkable powers of observation took in several hundred details
of the machinery.</p>

<p>From among this intricate mass he unerringly selected the vital instruments.
His rare, fantastic trilling broke out. Now it was a tribute to the mighty
brain which had conceived this power and perfected it to practical
application.</p>

<p>The trilling abruptly ended.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was taking in a new scene. And in this scene was the white-haired
giant, the Man of Peace.</p>

<p>The man of bronze stood motionless. His powerful hands hung at his sides.
Not by any visible action, did he betray that which his own super-senses had
conveyed to his brain.</p>

<p>For Doc Savage knew he was surrounded. He had become aware that hidden black
eyes were even now sighting along aimed rifle barrels. There were more than a
score of these weapons. Yet so perfect was the drilling of the Kama's subjects,
not the faintest sound had been created.</p>

<p>The voice of Kama spoke mockingly.</p>

<p>"You will walk ahead, Doc Savage, into the cavern of light," said Kama.
"Your determination to solve the mystery of the power of peace shall be
gratified. I would not deny you that. Walk forward, I command! Either that, or
you shall die where you are! Our bullets will not be wasted! For your eyes
alone shall be the target!"</p>

<p>"A wise man, Kama, knows when to obey," said Doc Savage, calmly. He raised
his bronzed hands. Step by step, he went up the shallow stairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>HAD Kama been closer, more ready to reveal himself, he would have noted a
queer circumstance. Doc Savage was apparently accepting his defeat in this
trap. Stair by stair, he climbed toward the cavern of light.</p>

<p>But the flaky gold eyes of the bronze man were closed. The lids concealed
the whirlwinds that must have been stirring in the depths of these hypnotic
orbs.</p>

<p>And as Doc walked up the stairs, his knees rubbed slowly together.</p>

<p>The eyes sighting along the rifle barrels were all within a few yards.
Kama's men were enclosed in the cold, icy cavern.</p>

<p>The crushing of fragile glass could hardly have been heard. Some steam arose
from the icy water in the cavern. The vapor slowly spreading along the stairs
around Doc Savage might have been mistaken for that.</p>

<p>Only, where the bronze giant had been walking under the menace of the
rifles, there now was no one.</p>

<p>Kama yelled, "Shoot now! Don't wait!"</p>

<p>The Orientals were accustomed to many kinds of magic. But this sudden
disappearance of Doc Savage paralyzed them temporarily. Then a dozen rifles
slapped flame and lead at the place on the stairs where Doc Savage had
been.</p>

<p>The man of bronze was no longer there. His massive legs had been sprung like
springs of finest steel. He had propelled himself backward. But when he struck
the water, he checked his descent so that no splash sounded.</p>

<p>Doc Savage did not possess the power to make himself invisible. His apparent
disappearance into thin air was only in the eyes of the Orientals. Especially
those whose rifle sights were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>The vaporlike gas released from the containers strapped inside his massive
limbs affected the sight of Kama and his men for only a few seconds. Then it
was dispelled. Other Orientals dashed from their places of concealment in the
cavern of light.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was alongside the peace power submarine. One bronze hand lifted.
It was visible to Monk and Knut Aage. The hand made quick signs.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" yelled Monk. "Doc's gone crazy! He's telling us to
dive!"</p>

<p>Knut Aage was sluggish, but he was quick enough to act now. Already, he was
closing the conning tower. The bronze man was making another sign.</p>

<p>"There he is!" screamed Kama. "Alongside the sub! Fill his worthless body
with lead!"</p>

<p>The Orientals made a most desperate effort to do this. Rifles belched.
Bullets scored the side of the submarine. Water was boiling from its ballast
tanks. The silver fish of the peace power was submerging.</p>

<p>Only the four prongs now were visible. A leaden hail squawled over the
surface near the craft. One of Doc's bronze hands was seen for a moment. Then
it slowly disappeared.</p>

<p>"This time, we have left no possible doubt!" gloated Kama. "It would have
been best to have permitted him to view our power, but all things must be as
they are!"</p>

<p>For the fourth time, Kama was convinced the man of bronze had died. Now he
rapped out another order. The four prongs of the sub were moving away from the
stairs.</p>

<p>"We must now capture the peace sub for our own purpose," announced Kama.
"Without Doc Savage, the others will be easily overcome."</p>

<p>Kama led the rush of his men to their own concealed submarine. The craft had
been hidden in one of the numerous side channels near the cavern of light.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>KNUT AAGE was at the controls, as their pronged craft moved slowly away from
the stairs of the cavern of light. Monk whipped back into a middle compartment.
His hairy hands shifted levers with frantic haste.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it, Doc!" he was muttering. "I knew I should've gone with
you!"</p>

<p>Monk's hands whirled a wheel. A metal panel started sliding. Some green
water flooded in.</p>

<p>Doc Savage climbed to his feet. He shook the water from the sleek mask of
his bronze hair. His golden skin seemed itself waterproof. His lungs filled
with air.</p>

<p>This had been his first breath in nearly four minutes. During that time, he
had dived. Then he had clung to the outside clamps of the entrance-and-exit
chamber of the submarine.</p>

<p>"Dang it, Doc--" Monk began.</p>

<p>"We have no time to lose," interrupted Doc. "At this moment, we have been
compelled to wait too long. The ice of the glacier is upon our companions. If
we do not hasten, the Englishman and the others nearest him will be crushed.
Johnny is chained beside him."</p>

<p>Knut Aage stared at Doc Savage as he came into the control room.</p>

<p>"You are almost as much of a miracle as the men who floated after they were
dead," he stated. "And I discovered that was simple enough. Their blood had
been removed and their veins filled with a chemical gas."</p>

<p>"My own escape was just as simple," was Doc's only comment.</p>

<p>The bronze man regarded this statement as true. He never looked on his
apparently miraculous powers as extraordinary. Knowledge of thousands of
devices and their application, and the use of his wits in preparation for
nearly all emergencies, he did not regard as supernatural.</p>

<p>Knut Aage was back at the observing device.</p>

<p>"Kama's sub is coming again," he stated. "He probably believes you have
perished, Doc Savage."</p>

<p>"Only until they pick us up with their own underwater television observer,"
stated Doc. "And we cannot lose them as before. We have no time to mix a new
lot of the screening chemical. Moreover, I have another more vital use for the
projector."</p>

<p>Kama's submarine was coming along rapidly. Doc headed back for the Place of
the Glacial Death. Both craft were speeding about evenly. Kama apparently was
trying to come alongside. The movement indicated he did not intend to repeat
the effort to ram the other submarine.</p>

<p>"Monk, prepare the big retort," directed Doc. "Connect it with the
compression tank. Have the igniting acid ready."</p>

<p>A broad grin crossed Monk's face.</p>

<p>"If there's really a devil in this Satan's Gateway, we'll give him something
to play with," he piped.</p>

<p>The great metal retort with its strange mixture of chemicals was placed
under the prong projector from which the eye had been removed. A person with
chemical knowledge would have known the retort and its connection were of alloy
that was designed to resist the most intense heat.</p>

<p>Kama's submarine speeded close. Doc saw the craft was making an effort to
crowd their vessel into the wall. He shot his own boat ahead at dangerous
speed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXVI. DEVIL'S OWN FIRE</h2>

<p>"I GUESS this is the finish for him!" grated Ham. "What do you suppose could
have happened to Doc in that pronged boat? Could Kama have got him?"</p>

<p>The first of Ham's remark was directed at the plight of Sir Arthur Westcott.
Despite his stolid British courage, the Englishman groaned loudly.</p>

<p>There was a deep grinding of ice against rock. Sir Arthur had strained the
length of the short chains. But the slowly pushing ice already had caught his
shoulder. The pinch had cut the flesh. Blood flowed over one hand.</p>

<p>The narrow shelf under Sir Arthur's feet slivered off. The tortured
Britisher was suddenly left suspended by the chains. Against him a corner of
the ice was pushing, pushing, pushing.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in time, that chain would break. But it could only be snapped by a
pressure that would first reduce the prisoner's body to a thing of jellied
bone.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur suddenly shouted in an agonized tone. Plainly, his brain was
giving away under the strain.</p>

<p>Then Johnny spoke quickly, "He's back--Doc's come back! There's the
submarine with one empty eye--"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" rapped out Ham. "An' there's Kama's sub right on their tail! There
doesn't seem anything Doc can do to shake him! I'm afraid there's nothing even
Doc can do in time!"</p>

<p>Doc's submarine shot toward the hanging finger of the glacier. The prongs
passed underneath the ice close to the point where Sir Arthur was being
inexorably squeezed. The Britisher now was only mumbling out his intense
suffering.</p>

<p>The four prongs of Kama's submarine crossed the open space toward the ice.
They were stopped.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>FROM under the ice leaped a blinding light. It was as if a blowtorch of
giant size had suddenly begun spurting fire. The flame danced with varied
colors from the face of the glacier.</p>

<p>Johnny, who was next to Sir Arthur, lost all of his scholarly aplomb. He
shouted.</p>

<p>"I told you so! Doc's got it! Well, I'll be superamalgamated! The whole
place is getting hot!"</p>

<p>Johnny spoke the truth. All of the inside of the Place of Glacial Death was
becoming heated. From under the corner of the crushing glacier leaped darting
tongues of blue-green fire.</p>

<p>The heat must have been withering. Probably it was of an intensity that
would have cut into the hardest steel.</p>

<p>Most certainly the spouting flame was penetrating the ice of the glacial
finger. One wide crack appeared. Into this, water started pouring down. This
was on the corner which was slowly crushing Sir Arthur to squeezed flesh.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the whole corner of the glacial finger split. Tons of ice were
being dissolved as if they had been pushed into a fiery furnace. The face of
the glacier closest to Sir Arthur roared of its own weight and went crashing
into the water under it.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" shouted Renny. "If that ever hit that sub, it would be all up
with Doc!"</p>

<p>But this falling chunk dived, then came slowly up. It was as large as a
small berg. Its fall revealed Doc's submarine.</p>

<p>From the prong without an eye shot the melting flame. The heat of it was so
intense, even the alloy metal of the projector was beginning to fall away.</p>

<p>The fierce blaze hissed with the pressure behind it. Doc's men on the narrow
shelf could not understand the source. They did not know of the laboratory Doc
and Monk had discovered. Nor did they know of the compressed air tanks which
had been charged from the ballast power pumps of the submarine.</p>

<p>Doc's craft moved slightly. The gigantic blowtorch was touching more of the
glacial finger. Like a knife dividing soft cheese, it cut the granitelike ice
apart.</p>

<p>"Your Doc Savage," murmured a voice. "He arrived. By jove! I admit he's a
great fellow--a great fellow--almost as great as the king himself."</p>

<p>Then Sir Arthur Westcott, loyal subject of His Britannic Majesty, fainted.
He was hanging suspended by the chain manacles. His injuries were painful, but
he probably would live.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that!" groaned Long Tom. "That devil, Kama, is going after
Doc!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE prongs of Kama's submarine were moving swiftly. No doubt, the maddened
man from San Tao had decided to ram Doc's craft. This time, he intended to
destroy the bronze giant in such manner there could be no doubt of his
death.</p>

<p>The prisoners groaned. After all, if Kama won this battle, their deaths had
only been delayed.</p>

<p>"He's going to ram right into the other sub!" said Johnny.</p>

<p>Kama's silvery fish gathered speed. The monster blowtorch was filling the
cavern with heat. Another mighty section of the glacial finger was
loosening.</p>

<p>The prisoners gasped. With a roaring crash, Kama's submersible smashed its
pointed prow into the other vessel. It seemed the ram had passed clear through
the other craft.</p>

<p>Air hissed. A flood of oil painted a rainbow across the green water. The
flame of the giant blowtorch snapped off as if a wire had been cut.</p>

<p>"There ain't anything can save Doc now!" groaned Renny. "Unless maybe that
devil Kama gets him outta there!"</p>

<p>But Kama, the man of San Tao, was not to rescue Doc Savage.</p>

<p>Thunder shook the mountain. It was like the rumbling of a great earthquake.
It was crackling, crashing sound.</p>

<p>At least half of the glacial finger in the cavern had been split off by the
effect of the terrible blowtorch from the prong of the now-wrecked
submersible.</p>

<p>With a roar, more than a thousand tons of ice crashed down into the green
water. The massive chunk went deep. There were other splintering sounds.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" grasped Johnny. "Doc and Kama both! The
subs went down!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE other prisoners gasped and swore. There was no doubt of it. The fishlike
submarines, joined by their collision, must have been flattened under that ice
like a watch might have been under a steam hammer.</p>

<p>All around, the green water arose in a great wave. It slapped over the
prisoners chained to the shelf. Only their chains prevented them from being
dragged from their places.</p>

<p>As the water subsided, a few bodies rolled to the surface. None attempted to
swim. Some of the Orientals had been mangled to death, even before they had
been drowned. Oil and blood floated up together.</p>

<p>"It looks as if that's the finish for Doc!" moaned Renny.</p>

<p>"He saved us for the time, and then he got it," stated Ham.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are correct," said a new voice. "I was hoping to get here in
time to prevent it. I was imprisoned in the cavern where the power is located.
I just managed to escape and I found the keys that may unlock your manacles. We
will see."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exclaimed Renny. "Professor Callus! And I thought they had got
you up on the mountain!"</p>

<p>"No," announced Professor Callus. "They seized me and killed the driver of
my cart. I was brought under the glacier and imprisoned in a big room."</p>

<p>The professor's enormous head rocked on his skinny shoulders. The strange
daylight shone from his hairless skull.</p>

<p>"I thought I had discovered the mystery of the ocean haunt," he said. "I was
hoping Doc Savage and I could work out the formula together. There's a fellow
called the Man of Peace who knows all about it."</p>

<p>Professor Callus was trying the keys. One by one, he was freeing the
prisoners. Renny was the first to swing over and get to the limp figure of Sir
Arthur Westcott. He deposited the limp man on the narrow shelf.</p>

<p>"That red-headed woman had a lot to do with getting us into this, an' it
ain't the first time she's tried to kill Doc," declared the big engineer.</p>

<p>"I am much afraid you speak the truth," declared Professor Callus.
"Unfortunately, I was unable to reach Doc Savage on the glacier above. I had
learned some strange things about this Lora Krants."</p>

<p>"And what were these things you learned?"</p>

<p>The heavy voice rapped out from back of the narrow shelf.</p>

<p>Professor Callus had come onto the shelf through a passage which the
prisoners had not known existed. In the entrance to this passage stood the
heavy-browed Barton Krants.</p>

<p>The youth accompanied his question with an unexpected leap. He struck
savagely at the professor's shining bald dome. The blow was a glancing one.</p>

<p>For a man devoted to scientific pursuits, Professor Callus was surprisingly
quick. One hand lashed out. The skinny fingers fastened on Barton Krants's
throat.</p>

<p>The youth smashed again with his fist. It seemed to have little effect on
the hard, shining skull. In the professor's hand appeared a snubnosed gun. He
pushed this into the youth's stomach.</p>

<p>"You and your sister are fakes!" he shouted. "I've known it all the time!
You have been responsible for most of this killing! But you have come to the
end!"</p>

<p>"Hey, don't do that!" shouted Renny. "You can't kill a man because--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THERE came the briefly spaced double crack of an automatic rifle. The
explosions whirled the prisoners around. They were looking at an ordinary
fishing schooner. The vessel had glided into the glacial cavern from an outside
passage.</p>

<p>Professor Callus gurgled in his throat. His snubnosed gun hit the shelf and
bounced into the water below. Across the shining dome was furrowed a deep, red
line. Close to it was another mark. But this was not a red furrow.</p>

<p>It was a clean, round hole. The eye behind that rifle had been certain. The
hand on the trigger had been sure.</p>

<p>Professor Callus uttered no further sound. His great head seemed to weigh
his small body down. The shining skull rolled off the shelf. The weight pulled
the rest of his skinny form along.</p>

<p>The water splashed. Barton Krants yelled, "Sis! Good enough!"</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" rumbled Renny. "That red-headed dame again! And she murdered the
professor in cold blood!"</p>

<p>The slim, red-headed girl stood on the foredeck of the fishing schooner.
Death smoke still curled from the rifle in her hands.</p>

<p>"Barton!" she cried out. "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"I'm all right!" replied the heavy-browed youth. "But I've got to get back!
Sis, I've found him! You wait here!"</p>

<p>"Say," barked Ham, "what's this all about? You stay here and explain!"</p>

<p>But the heavy-browed Barton Krants was slipping back into the passageway.
The fishing schooner scraped the black rock wall. On its deck were eight or ten
nearly naked men. They were the huge Norwegians.</p>

<p>A mast with a rope ladder touched the narrow shelf. The red-headed girl
ascended it lightly, the rifle still held in her hands. Some of the nearly
naked men heaved after her.</p>

<p>Renny barged forward and seized the girl's wrist. With a cry of pain, she
dropped the rifle.</p>

<p>"I guess you've got some explainin' to do, sister!" growled the big
engineer. "Beginnin' back in Manhattan when you grabbed me, an' then tried to
burn Doc alive!"</p>

<p>The nearly naked men pushed forward. They jammed guns into Renny. Rifles
menaced the others. Renny released the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>"Never mind, they'll be all right," said the girl. She spoke in Norwegian.
"They're my friends, though they don't know it."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" grunted Renny. "You think we don't know you're hooked up with
these crooks? Professor Callus spilled it before you murdered him!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE girl smiled sadly. She shook her round head.</p>

<p>"You'll have to listen, Colonel Renwick," she said. "You were kidnaped by
mistake by some of my men in Manhattan. They believed you were Professor
Callus. You were released, when I told them their mistake."</p>

<p>"Yeah? Then, Miss Krants, explain how you happened to head the gang that
tried to bump off Doc? They've finally done it, those devils of Kama's, even if
they did go with him!"</p>

<p>The girl's face became deadly white.</p>

<p>"You mean they've got Mr. Savage?" she murmured. "Oh, they couldn't! Not
now, after everything else seem to be coming out all right! Doc Savage is
alive! I just know it! Don't you understand? I played in with that crowd to
trap Mr. Savage in Manhattan! That got me in with the brains of this whole
scheme! But I telephoned you at the hangar in time to save Mr. Savage from
being burned to death."</p>

<p>Ham stepped forward. His lean face lighted.</p>

<p>"That's right, Renny," he stated. "It was a woman who telephoned. It sounds
reasonable. There is much to this which we haven't discovered. But, Miss
Krants, I fear Renny has spoken the truth. Doc was buried with the others under
the glacier when it fell."</p>

<p>The red-headed girl sobbed convulsively. There was considerably more than
just interest in a friend in her grief.</p>

<p>"He saved my life," the girl said, slowly. "Nothing could have happened to
Doc Savage."</p>

<p>But the cold, green water of the underground sea had ceased to ripple. The
great bulk of the floating ice reared like a slowly moving monument to
death.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have your faith," began Johnny. "But--"</p>

<p>A rending, rumbling explosion drowned his speech. The uncanny daylight went
out as though some one had thrown a switch. The Place of the Glacial Death
became a Stygian tomb.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the red-headed girl. "It has happened!"</p>

<p>Whatever the fearsome thing might be, it was still happening. In some
distant cavern flared a great pinkish glow. Through the ice caverns seeped the
acrid smell of acids like the burning of sulphur.</p>

<p>Then once more the darkness became intense. Bit by bit, great chunks of rock
or ice were thudded from cavern roofs in the distance. The last bit fell, then
there was silence.</p>

<p>"He has done it," spoke the red-headed girl in a stricken voice. "Barton!
Barton!"</p>

<p>"Can't we muster up some sort of light?" questioned Johnny in Norwegian.</p>

<p>"Oil torches, Skavnar!" said the red-headed girl, more firmly.</p>

<p>The torches began casting fitful, grotesque shadows on the deck of the
schooner.</p>

<p>Then Long Tom cried out, "Look! He's coming up out of the sea! Miss Krants,
do you know if Doc had the glass fish on that submarine?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE reply of the red-headed girl was not needed. A faint blue glow appeared
far down in the water. It spread rapidly. It was rising to the surface.</p>

<p>Doc Savage's glass cylinder emerged close to the side of the schooner. As it
touched, floating, the lid slid back. First appeared the dead-white face of
Knut Aage.</p>

<p>After him came the ugly, apelike countenance of Monk.</p>

<p>"Hello, insect!" rapped Ham, hiding his feelings with heavy sarcasm. "I
can't get rid of you! I can't even get rid of that pig!"</p>

<p>The smooth, bronze head of Doc Savage appeared. The giant adventurer stood
erect on the deck of the fishing schooner.</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly in Norwegian to the nearly naked men. Their oil torches
clustered around him.</p>

<p>"We thought you had taken your last dive," said Ham, grinning. "No one could
live under a thousand tons or so of ice."</p>

<p>"We were too far down for it to reach us," advised Doc. "We saw the glacier
breaking. The glass fish was a couple of hundred feet under when it struck. We
saw the body of Professor Callus. His head seemed to be pulling him deeper.
Miss Krants, I am glad you have arrived. We must get to the cavern of light at
once."</p>

<p>The lips of the red-headed girl trembled. Tears spotted her white
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You know--oh, you do know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know nearly all of it," stated Doc Savage. "I have been partly
informed ever since I made a telephone call to Del Monte, California, before we
left Manhattan. The real Lora Krants is in Del Monte. She confirmed her
friendship for you and your brother. She did not object to your assuming her
identity."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squeaked Monk. "I knew all the time the redhead wasn't
playin' on the square! She shook hands with me! Then she had them indecent guys
without clothes try to smother me to death!"</p>

<p>The red-headed girl smiled at Monk through her tears.</p>

<p>"I like you too much to have harm come to you, Monk," she said, softly.</p>

<p>"Maybe she was just trying to do the world a great favor," said Ham,
maliciously. "Too bad they didn't finish the job."</p>

<p>"I don't know why Doc took the trouble to melt off that glacier!" howled
Monk. "Think of all the people who would have been spared listening to your
loose mouth!"</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Westcott opened his eyes and spoke feebly.</p>

<p>"Well, by jove! What queer fellows your blighters are, Doc Savage!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage said, "We must not delay longer. Let us get to the cavern of
light and find this Man of Peace."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Chapter XXVII. THE MAN OF PEACE</h2>

<p>BARTON KRANTS held the body of the white-haired Man of Peace in his arms.
The rugged face was peaceful. The sunken eyes were closed in death. But a smile
remained on the giant's lips.</p>

<p>"He realized at the last what this power of light would mean to the world in
the hands of the wrong persons," stated Doc Savage. "So he destroyed his
lifetime of work and himself with it. It was a great atonement."</p>

<p>The red-headed girl knelt beside the white-haired giant. Her hand softly
stroked his shaggy hair.</p>

<p>"It is best this way," she murmured. "Oh, if we could only have reached him
before it was too late."</p>

<p>"The murderer of Hjalmar Landson has met justice," stated Knut Aage. "Those
who would have turned the evil force loose upon the world have been destroyed.
My people can resume their occupation of peace."</p>

<p>"Yes," stated Doc Savage. "Many murders have been avenged. The first was
that of the professor, Homus Jasson, who was killed at my door in Manhattan. He
came to warn me, I believe. Another man trapped him."</p>

<p>"But, Doc," said Ham, "how about all of the weapons Homus Jasson was
carrying, and that deadly hamadryad cobra?"</p>

<p>"I am sure they were on the person of the other man," stated Doc. "He
intended to destroy us, fearing we would detect his scheme when Homus Jasson
arrived. After he killed Jasson, he planted the lethal weapons upon him. He
felt that for a time he would be safe."</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" piped up Monk. "I don't quite get it yet!"</p>

<p>"The President of the United States will be greatly pleased and greatly
grieved," said Doc Savage. "The Man of Peace before you was Arne Dass, the
great scientist who disappeared. Miss Krants and her brother are Kana and
Barton Dass. They were the first to suspect their father was the originator of
the haunted-ocean fight. They were made agents of the department of
justice."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" gulped Renny. "Then I was grabbed by a bunch of them G-men in
Manhattan?"</p>

<p>"It would seem that was it," smiled Doc. "The man who Arne Dass trusted to
help bring peace to the world, realized the millions in the power. Dass sent
him to Washington to negotiate with his own government. This man contacted
Kama, of San Tao, and his crowd. Then he contrived to get many bids from other
nations."</p>

<p>"But these men of the icy blood?" said Johnny.</p>

<p>"The person who was aid to Dass was a great scientist himself," advised Doc.
"He produced rigor mortis in Homus Jasson a few minutes after he was killed. He
had the secret by which the loyal Norwegians were made almost impervious to
cold. But the Norwegians fought for the Man of Peace, Arne Dass. The aid was
compelled to use Kama's men for his own ends."</p>

<p>"So Professor Callus was the real crook, the killer?" said Ham. "And the
girl played along with him to try and save her father?"</p>

<p>"That about sums up all the answers," said Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squealed out Monk. "I forgot all about Habeas Corpus!
I've got to get outta here and find that pig!"</p>

<p>"Your queer quadruped is being well taken care of," assured Knut Aage. "My
people will give you a different reception, when we return. I instructed them
the animal was not to be harmed."</p>

<p>"And that just about spoils the whole finish to a great and perfect
adventure!" rapped Ham. "There doesn't seem any way I can get rid of that
pig!"</p>

<p>Ham and Monk in all probability would argue about Habeas Corpus the duration
of their trip back to New York.</p>
