<h1>The Curse of the Catafalques</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>F. Anstey</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Unless I am very much mistaken, until the time when I was
subjected to the strange and exceptional experience which I now
propose to relate, I had never been brought into close contact with
anything of a supernatural description. At least if I ever was, the
circumstance can have made no lasting impression upon me, as I am
quite unable to recall it. But in the "Curse of the Catafalques" I
was confronted with a horror so weird and so altogether unusual, that
I doubt whether I shall ever succeed in wholly forgetting it--and I
know that I have never felt really well since.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to tell my story intelligibly without some
account of my previous history by way of introduction, although I
will try to make it as little diffuse as I may.</p>

<p>I had not been a success at home; I was an orphan, and, in my
anxiety to please a wealthy uncle upon whom I was practically
dependent, I had consented to submit myself to a series of
competitive examinations for quite a variety of professions, but in
each successive instance I achieved the same disheartening failure.
Some explanation of this may, no doubt, be found in the fact that,
with a fatal want of forethought, I had entirely omitted to prepare
myself by any particular course of study--which, as I discovered too
late, is almost indispensable to success in these intellectual
contests.</p>

<p>My uncle himself took this view, and conceiving--not without
discernment--that I was by no means likely to retrieve myself by any
severe degree of application in the future, he had me shipped out to
Australia, where he had correspondents and friends who would put
things in my way.</p>

<p>They did put several things in my way--and, as might have been
expected, I came to grief over every one of them, until at length,
having given a fair trial to each opening that had been provided for
me, I began to perceive that my uncle had made a grave mistake in
believing me suited for a colonial career.</p>

<p>I resolved to return home and convince him of his error, and give
him one more opportunity of repairing it; he had failed to discover
the best means of utilizing my undoubted ability, yet I would not
reproach him (nor do I reproach him even now), for I too have felt
the difficulty.</p>

<p>In pursuance of my resolution, I booked my passage home by one of
the Orient liners from Melbourne to London. About an hour before the
ship was to leave her moorings, I went on board and made my way at
once to the stateroom which I was to share with a fellow passenger,
whose acquaintance I then made for the first time.</p>

<p>He was a tall cadaverous young man of about my own age, and my
first view of him was not encouraging, for when I came in, I found
him rolling restlessly on the cabin floor, and uttering hollow
groans.</p>

<p>"This will never do," I said, after I had introduced myself; "if
you're like this now, my good sir, what will you be when we're fairly
out at sea? You must husband your resources for that."</p>

<p>"And why trouble to roll? The ship will do all that for you, if
you will only have patience."</p>

<p>He explained, somewhat brusquely, that he was suffering from
mental agony, not seasickness; and by a little pertinacious
questioning (for I would not allow myself to be rebuffed) I was soon
in possession of the secret which was troubling my companion, whose
name, as I also learned, was Augustus McFadden.</p>

<p>It seemed that his parents had emigrated before his birth, and he
had lived all his life in the Colony, where he was contented and
fairly prosperous--when an eccentric old aunt of his over in England
happened to die.</p>

<p>She left McFadden himself nothing, having given by her will the
bulk of her property to the only daughter of a baronet of ancient
family, in whom she took a strong interest. But the will was not
without its effect upon her existence, for it expressly mentioned the
desire of the testatrix that the baronet should receive her nephew
Augustus if he presented himself within a certain time, and should
afford him every facility for proving his fitness for acceptance as a
suitor. The alliance was merely recommended, however, not enjoined,
and the gift was unfettered by any conditions.</p>

<p>"I heard of it first," said McFadden, "from Chlorine's father
(Chlorine is her name, you know)".</p>

<p>Sir Paul Catafalque wrote to me, informing me of the mention of my
name in my aunt's will, enclosing his daughter's photograph, and
formally inviting me to come over and do my best, if my affections
were not preengaged, to carry out the last wishes of the departed. He
added that I might expect to receive shortly a packet from my aunt's
executors which would explain matters fully, and in which I should
find certain directions for my guidance. The photograph decided me;
it was so eminently pleasing that I felt at once that my poor aunt's
wishes must be sacred to me. I could not wait for the packet to
arrive, and so I wrote at once to Sir Paul accepting the
invitation.</p>

<p>"Yes," he added, with another of the hollow groans, "miserable
wretch that I am, I pledged my honor to present myself as a suitor,
and now--now--here I am, actually embarked upon the desperate
errand!"</p>

<p>He seemed inclined to begin to roll again here, but I stopped him.
"Really," I said, "I think in your place, with an excellent
chance--for I presume the lady's heart is also disengaged--with an
excellent chance of winning a baronet's daughter with a considerable
fortune and a pleasing appearance, I should bear up better."</p>

<p>"You think so," he rejoined, "but you do not know all! The very
day after I had despatched my fatal letter, my aunt's explanatory
packet arrived. I tell you that when I read the hideous revelations
it contained, and knew to what horrors I had innocently pledged
myself, my hair stood on end, and I believe it has remained on end
ever since. But it was too late. Here I am, engaged to carry out a
task from which my inmost soul recoils. Ah, if I dared but
retract!"</p>

<p>"Then why in the name of common sense, don't you retract?" I
asked. "Write and say that you much regret that a previous
engagement, which you had unfortunately overlooked, deprives you of
the pleasure of accepting."</p>

<p>"Impossible," he said; "it would be agony to me to feel that I had
incurred Chlorine's contempt, even though I only know her through a
photograph at present. If I were to back out of it now, she would
have reason to despise me, would she not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she would," I said.</p>

<p>"You see my dilemma--I cannot retract; on the other hand, I dare
not go on. The only thing, as I have thought lately, which could save
me and my honor at the same time would be my death on the voyage out,
for then my cowardice would remain undiscovered."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "you can die on the voyage out if you want
to--there need be no difficulty about that. All you have to do is
just to slip over the side some dark night when no one is looking. I
tell you what," I added (for somehow I began to feel a friendly
interest in this poor slack-baked creature): "if you don't find your
nerves equal to it when it comes to the point, I don't mind giving
you a leg over myself."</p>

<p>"I never intended to go as far as that," he said, rather
pettishly, and without any sign of gratitude for my offer; "I don't
care about actually dying, if she could only be made to believe I had
died that would be quite enough for me. I could live on here, happy
in the thought that I was saved from her scorn. But how can she be
made to believe it?--that's the point."</p>

<p>"Precisely," I said. "You can hardly write yourself and inform her
that you died on the voyage."</p>

<p>"You might do this, though: sail to England as you propose, and go
to see her under another name, and break the sad intelligence to
her."</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, I might do that!" he said, with some animation;
"I should certainly not be recognized--she can have no photograph of
me, for I have never been photographed. And yet---no," he added, with
a shudder, "it is useless. I can't do it; I dare not trust myself
under that roof!"</p>

<p>"I must find some other way. You have given me an idea. Listen,"
he said, after a short pause:</p>

<p>"You seem to take an interest in me; you are going to London; the
Catafalques live there, or near it, at some place called Parson's
Green. Can I ask a great favor of you--would you very much mind
seeking them out yourself as a fellow-voyager of mine? I could not
expect you to tell a positive untruth on my account--but if, in the
course of an interview with Chlorine, you could contrive to convey
the impression that I died on my way to her side, you would be doing
me a service I can never repay!"</p>

<p>"I should very much prefer to do you a service that you could
repay," was my very natural rejoinder.</p>

<p>"She will not require strict proof," he continued eagerly; "I
could give you enough papers and things to convince her that you come
from me. Say you will do me this kindness!"</p>

<p>I hesitated for some time longer, not so much, perhaps, from
scruples of a conscientious kind as from a disinclination to
undertake a troublesome commission for an entire
stranger---gratuitously. But McFadden pressed me hard, and at length
he made an appeal to springs in my nature which are never touched in
vain, and I yielded.</p>

<p>When we had settled the question in its financial aspect, I said
to McFadden, "The only thing now is--how would you prefer to pass
away? Shall I make you fall over and be devoured by a shark? That
would be a picturesque end--and I could do myself justice over the
shark? I should make the young lady weep considerably."</p>

<p>"That won't do at all!" he said irritably; "I can see from her
face that Chlorine is a girl of a delicate sensibility, and would be
disgusted by the idea of any suitor of hers spending his last
cohesive moments inside such a beastly repulsive thing as a shark. I
don't want to be associated in her mind with anything so unpleasant.
No, sir; I will die--if you will oblige me by remembering it--of a
low fever, of a noninfectious type, at sunset, gazing at her portrait
with my fading eyesight and gasping her name with my last breath. She
will cry more over that!"</p>

<p>"I might work it up into something effective, certainly," I
admitted; "and, by the way, if you are going to expire in my
stateroom, I ought to know a little more about you than I do. There
is time still before the tender goes; you might do worse than spend
it in coaching me in your life's history."</p>

<p>He gave me a few leading facts, and supplied me with several
documents for study on the voyage; he even abandoned to me the whole
of his traveling arrangements, which proved far more complete and
serviceable than my own.</p>

<p>And then the "All-ashore" bell rang, and McFadden, as he bade me
farewell, took from his pocket a bulky packet. "You have saved me,"
he said. "Now I can banish every recollection of this miserable
episode. I need no longer preserve my poor aunt's directions; let
them go, then."</p>

<p>Before I could say anything, he had fastened something heavy to
the parcel and dropped it through the cabin-light into the sea, after
which he went ashore, and I have never seen nor heard of him
since.</p>

<p>During the voyage I had leisure to think seriously over the
affair, and the more I thought of the task I had undertaken, the less
I liked it.</p>

<p>No man with the instincts of a gentleman can feel any satisfaction
at finding himself on the way to harrow up a poor young lady's
feelings by a perfectly fictitious account of the death of a
poor-spirited suitor who could selfishly save his reputation at her
expense.</p>

<p>And so strong was my feeling about this from the very first, that
I doubt whether, if McFadden's terms had been a shade less liberal, I
could ever have brought myself to consent.</p>

<p>But it struck me that, under judiciously sympathetic treatment,
the lady might prove not inconsolable, and that I myself might be
able to heal the wound I was about to inflict.</p>

<p>I found a subtle pleasure in the thought of this, for, unless
McFadden had misinformed me, Chlorine's fortune was considerable, and
did not depend upon any marriage she might or might not make. On the
other hand, I was penniless, and it seemed to me only too likely that
her parents might seek to found some objection to me on that
ground.</p>

<p>I studied the photograph McFadden had left with me; it was that of
a pensive but distinctly pretty face, with an absence of firmness in
it that betrayed a plastic nature. I felt certain that if I only had
the recommendation, as McFadden had, of an aunt's dying wishes, it
would not take me long to effect a complete conquest.</p>

<p>And then, as naturally as possible, came the thought--why should
not I procure myself the advantages of this recommendation? Nothing
could be easier; I had merely to present myself as Augustus McFadden,
who was hitherto a mere name to them; the information I already
possessed as to his past life would enable me to support the
character, and as it seemed that the baronet lived in great
seclusion, I could easily contrive to keep out of the way of the few
friends and relations I had in London until my position was
secure.</p>

<p>What harm would this innocent deception do to anyone? McFadden,
even if he ever knew, would have no right to complain--he had given
up all pretentions himself--and if he was merely anxious to preserve
his reputation, his wishes would be more than carried out, for I
flattered myself that whatever ideal Chlorine might have formed of
her destined suitor, I should come much nearer to it than poor
McFadden could ever have done. No, he would gain, positively gain, by
my assumption. He could not have counted upon arousing more than a
mild regret as it was; now he would be fondly, it might be madly,
loved. By proxy, it is true, but that was far more than he
deserved.</p>

<p>Chlorine was not injured--far from it; she would have a suitor to
welcome, not weep over, and his mere surname could make no possible
difference to her. And lastly, it was a distinct benefit to me, for
with a new name and an excellent reputation success would be an
absolute certainty.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, that the scheme, which opened out a far more
manly and honorable means of obtaining a livelihood than any I had
previously contemplated, should have grown more attractively feasible
each day, until I resolved at last to carry it out? Let rigid
moralists blame me if they will; I have never pretended to be better
than the average run of mankind (though I am certainly no worse), and
no one who really knows what human nature is will reproach me very
keenly for obeying what was almost an instinct. And I may say this,
that if ever an unfortunate man was bitterly punished for a fraud
which was harmless, if not actually pious, by a visitation of intense
and protracted terror, that person was I!</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>After arriving in England, and before presenting myself at
Parson's Green in my assumed character, I took one precaution against
any danger there might be of my throwing away my liberty in a fit of
youthful impulsiveness. I went to Somerset House, and carefully
examined the probate copy of the late Miss Petronia McFadden's last
will and testament.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more satisfactory; a sum of between forty
and fifty thousand pounds was Chlorine's unconditionally, just as
McFadden had said. I searched, but could find nothing in the will
whatever to prevent her property, under the then existing state of
the law, from passing under the entire control of a future
husband.</p>

<p>After this, then, I could no longer restrain my ardor, and so, one
foggy afternoon about the middle of December, I found myself driving
towards the house in which I reckoned upon achieving a comfortable
independence.</p>

<p>Parson's Green was reached at last; a small triangular open space
bordered on two of its sides by mean and modern erections, but on the
third by some ancient mansions, gloomy and neglected-looking indeed,
but with traces on them still of their former consequence.</p>

<p>My cab stopped before the gloomiest of them all--a square grim
house with dull and small-paned windows, flanked by two narrow and
projecting wings, and built of dingy brick, faced with yellow-stone.
Some old scrollwork railings, with a corroded frame in the middle for
a long departed oil lamp, separated the house from the road; inside
was a semicircular patch of rank grass, and a damp gravel sweep led
from the heavy gate to a square portico supported by two wasted black
wooden pillars.</p>

<p>As I stood there, after pulling the pear-shaped bell-handle, and
heard the bell tinkling and jangling fretfully within, and as I
glanced up at the dull housefront looming cheerless out of the
fog-laden December twilight, I felt my confidence beginning to
abandon me for the first time, and I really was almost inclined to
give the whole thing up and run away.</p>

<p>Before I could make up my mind, a mouldy and melancholy butler had
come slowly down the sweep and opened the gate---and my opportunity
had fled. Later I remembered how, as I walked along the gravel, a
wild and wailing scream pierced the heavy silence--it seemed at once
a lamentation and a warning. But as the District Railway was quite
near, I did not attach any particular importance to the sound at the
time.</p>

<p>I followed the butler through a dank and chilly hall, where an
antique lamp hung glimmering feebly through its panes of dusty
stained glass, up a broad carved staircase, and along some tortuous
paneled passages, until at length I was ushered into a long and
rather low reception room, scantily furnished with the tarnished
mirrors and spindle-legged brocaded furniture of a bygone
century.</p>

<p>A tall and meager old man, with a long white beard, and haggard,
sunken black eyes, was seated at one side of the high chimney-piece,
while opposite him sat a little limp old lady with a nervous
expression, and dressed in trailing black robes relieved by a little
yellow lace about the head and throat. As I saw them, I recognized at
once that I was in the presence of Sir Paul Catafalque and his
wife.</p>

<p>They both rose slowly, and advanced arm-in-arm in their
old-fashioned way, and met me with a stately solemnity. "You are
indeed welcome," they said in faint hollow voices. "We thank you for
this proof of your chivalry and devotion. It cannot be but that such
courage and such self-sacrifice will meet with their reward!"</p>

<p>And although I did not quite understand how they could have
discerned, as yet, that I was chivalrous and devoted, I was too glad
to have made a good impression to do anything but beg them not to
mention it.</p>

<p>And then a slender figure, with a drooping head, a wan face, and
large sad eyes, came softly down the dimly-lighted room towards me,
and I and my destined bride met for the first time.</p>

<p>As I had expected, after she had once anxiously raised her eyes,
and allowed them to rest upon me, her face was lighted up by an
evident relief, as she discovered that the fulfillment of my aunt's
wishes would not be so distasteful to her, personally, as it might
have been.</p>

<p>For myself, I was upon the whole rather disappointed in her; the
portrait had flattered her considerably--the real Chlorine was
thinner and paler than I had been led to anticipate, while there was
a settled melancholy in her manner which I felt would prevent her
from being an exhilarating companion.</p>

<p>And I must say I prefer a touch of archness and animation in
womankind, and, if I had been free to consult my own tastes, should
have greatly preferred to become a member of a more cheerful family.
Under the circumstances, however, I was not entitled to be too
particular, and I put up with it.</p>

<p>From the moment of my arrival I fell easily and naturally into the
position of an honored guest, who might be expected in time to form
nearer and dearer relations with the family, and certainly I was
afforded every opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>I made no mistakes, for the diligence with which I had got up
McFadden's antecedents enabled me to give perfectly satisfactory
replies to most of the few allusions or questions that were addressed
to me, and I drew upon my imagination for the rest.</p>

<p>But those days I spent in the baronet's family were far from
lively: the Catafalques went nowhere; they seemed to know nobody; at
least no visitors ever called or dined there while I was with them,
and the time dragged slowly on in a terrible monotony in that dim
tomb of a house, which I was not expected to leave except for very
brief periods, for Sir Paul would grow uneasy if I walked out
alone--even to Putney.</p>

<p>There was something, indeed, about the attitude of both the old
people towards myself which I could only consider as extremely
puzzling. They would follow me about with a jealous care, blended
with anxious alarm, and their faces as they looked at me wore an
expression of tearful admiration, touched with something of pity, as
for some youthful martyr; at times, too, they spoke of the gratitude
they felt, and professed a determined hopefulness as to my ultimate
success.</p>

<p>Now I was well aware that this is not the ordinary bearing of the
parents of an heiress to a suitor who, however deserving in other
respects, is both obscure and penniless, and the only way in which I
could account for it was by the supposition that there was some
latent defect in Chlorine's temper or constitution, which entitled
the man who won her to commiseration, and which would also explain
their evident anxiety to get her off their hands.</p>

<p>But although anything of this kind would be, of course, a
drawback, I felt that forty or fifty thousand pounds would be a fair
set-off--and I could not expect everything.</p>

<p>When the time came at which I felt that I could safely speak to
Chlorine of what lay nearest my heart, I found an unforeseen
difficulty in bringing her to confess that she reciprocated my
passion.</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink unaccountably from speaking the word which
gave me the right to claim her, confessing that she dreaded it not
for her own sake, but for mine alone, which struck me as an
unpleasantly morbid trait in so young a girl.</p>

<p>Again and again I protested that I was willing to run all
risks--as I was--and again and again she resisted, though always more
faintly, until at last my efforts were successful, and I forced from
her lips the assent which was of so much importance to me.</p>

<p>But it cost her a great effort, and I believe she even swooned
immediately afterwards; but this is only conjecture, as I lost no
time in seeking Sir Paul and clenching the matter before Chlorine had
time to retract.</p>

<p>He heard what I had to tell him with a strange light of triumph
and relief in his weary eyes.</p>

<p>"You have made an old man very happy and hopeful," he said. "I
ought, perhaps, even now to deter you, but I am too selfish for that.
And you are young and brave and ardent; why need we despair? I
suppose," he added, looking keenly at me, "you would prefer as little
delay as possible?"</p>

<p>"I should indeed," I replied. I was pleased, for I had not
expected to find him so sensible as that.</p>

<p>"Then leave all preliminaries to me; when the day and time have
been settled, I will let you know. As you are aware, it will be
necessary to have your signature to this document; and here, my boy,
I must in conscience warn you solemnly that by signing you make your
decision irrevocable--irrevocable, you understand?"</p>

<p>When I had heard this, I need scarcely say that I was all
eagerness to sign; so great was my haste that I did not even try to
decipher the somewhat crabbed and antiquated writing in which the
terms of the agreement were set out.</p>

<p>I was anxious to impress the baronet with a sense of my
gentlemanly feeling and the confidence I had in him, while I
naturally presumed that, since the contract was binding upon me, the
baronet would, as a man of honor, hold it equally conclusive on his
own side.</p>

<p>As I look back upon it now, it seems simply extraordinary that I
should have been so easily satisfied, have taken so little pains to
find out the exact position in which I was placing myself; but, with
the ingenuous confidence of youth, I fell an easy victim, as I was to
realize later with terrible enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Say nothing of this to Chlorine," said Sir Paul, as I handed him
the document signed, "until the final arrangements are made; it will
only distress her unnecessarily."</p>

<p>I wondered why at the time, but I promised to obey, supposing that
he knew best, and for some days after that I made no mention to
Chlorine of the approaching day which was to witness our union.</p>

<p>As we were continually together, I began to regard her with an
esteem which I had not thought possible at first. Her looks improved
considerably under the influence of happiness, and I found she could
converse intelligently enough upon several topics, and did not bore
me nearly as much as I was fully prepared for.</p>

<p>And so the time passed less heavily, until one afternoon the
baronet took me aside mysteriously. "Prepare yourself, Augustus,"
(they had all learned to call me Augustus), he said; "all is
arranged. The event upon which our dearest hopes depend is fixed for
tomorrow--in the Gray Chamber of course, and at midnight."</p>

<p>I thought this a curious time and place for the ceremony, but I
had divined his eccentric passion for privacy and retirement, and
only imagined that he had procured some very special form of
license.</p>

<p>"But you do not know the Gray Chamber," he added.</p>

<p>"Come with me, and I will show you where it is." And he led me up
the broad staircase, and, stopping at the end of a passage before an
immense door covered with black baize and studded with brass nails,
which gave it a hideous resemblance to a gigantic coffin lid, he
pressed a spring, and it fell slowly back.</p>

<p>I saw a long dim gallery, whose very existence nothing in the
external appearance of the mansion had led me to suspect; it led to a
heavy oaken door with cumbrous plates and fastenings of metal.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night is Christmas eve, as you are doubtless aware," he
said in a hushed voice. "At twelve, then, you will present yourself
at yonder door--the door of the Gray Chamber--where you must fulfill
the engagement you have made."</p>

<p>I was surprised at his choosing such a place for the ceremony; it
would have been more cheerful in the long drawing room; but it was
evidently a whim of his, and I was too happy to think of opposing it.
I hastened at once to Chlorine, with her father's sanction, and told
her that the crowning moment of both our lives was fixed at last.</p>

<p>The effect of my announcement was astonishing: she fainted, for
which I remonstrated with her as soon as she came to herself. "Such
extreme sensitiveness, my love," I could not help saying, "may be
highly creditable to your sense of maidenly propriety, but allow me
to say that I can scarcely regard it as a compliment."</p>

<p>"Augustus," she said, "you must not think I doubt you; and
yet--and yet--the ordeal will be a severe one for you."</p>

<p>"I will steel my nerves," I said grimly (for I was annoyed with
her); "and, after all, Chlorine, the ceremony is not invariably
fatal; I have heard of the victim surviving it--occasionally."</p>

<p>"How brave you are!" she said earnestly. "I will imitate you,
Augustus; I too will hope."</p>

<p>I really thought her insane, which alarmed me for the validity of
the marriage. "Yes, I am weak, foolish, I know," she continued; "but
oh, I shudder so when I think of you, away in that gloomy Gray
Chamber, going through it all alone!"</p>

<p>This confirmed my worst fears. No wonder her parents felt grateful
to me for relieving them of such a responsibility! "May I ask where
you intend to be at the time?" I inquired very quietly.</p>

<p>"You will not think us unfeeling," she replied, "but dear papa
considered that such anxiety as ours would be scarcely endurable did
we not seek some distraction from it; and so, as a special favor, he
has procured evening orders for Sir John Soane's Museum in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, where we shall drive immediately after dinner."</p>

<p>I knew that the proper way to treat the insane was by reasoning
with them gently, so as to place their own absurdity clearly before
them. "If you are forgetting your anxiety in Sir John Soane's Museum,
while I cool my heels in the Gray Chamber," I said, "is it probable
that any clergyman will be induced to perform the marriage ceremony?
Did you really think two people can be united separately?"</p>

<p>She was astonished this time. "You are joking!" she cried; "you
cannot really believe that we are to be married in--in the Gray
Chamber?"</p>

<p>"Then will you tell me where we are to be married?" I asked. "I
think I have the right to know--it can hardly be at the Museum!"</p>

<p>She turned upon me with a sudden misgiving; "I could almost
fancy," she said anxiously, "that this is no feigned ignorance.
Augustus, your aunt sent you a message--tell me, have you read
it?" Now, owing to McFadden's want of consideration, this was my one
weak point--I had not read it, and thus I felt myself upon delicate
ground. The message evidently related to business of importance which
was to be transacted in this Gray Chamber, and as the genuine
McFadden clearly knew all about it, it would have been simply
suicidal to confess my own ignorance.</p>

<p>"Why of course, darling, of course," I said hastily. "You must
think no more of my silly joke; there is something I have to arrange
in the Gray Chamber before I can call you mine. But, tell me, why
does it make you so uneasy?" I added, thinking it might be prudent to
find out beforehand what formality was expected from me.</p>

<p>"I cannot help it--no, I cannot!" she cried, "the test is so
searching--are you sure that you are prepared at all points? I
overheard my father say that no precaution could safely be neglected.
I have such a terrible foreboding that, after all, this may come
between us."</p>

<p>It was clear enough to me now; the baronet was by no means so
simple and confiding in his choice of a son-in-law as I had imagined,
and had no intention, after all, of accepting me without some inquiry
into my past life, my habits, and my prospects.</p>

<p>That he should seek to make this examination more impressive by
appointing this ridiculous midnight interview for it, was only what
might have been expected from an old man of his confirmed
eccentricity.</p>

<p>But I knew I could easily contrive to satisfy the baronet, and
with the idea of consoling Chlorine, I said as much. "Why will you
persist in treating me like a child, Augustus?" she broke out almost
petulantly. "They have tried to hide it all from me, but do you
suppose I do not know that in the Gray Chamber you will have to
encounter one far more formidable, far more difficult to satisfy,
than poor dear papa?"</p>

<p>"I see you know more than I--more than I thought you did," I said.
"Let us understand one another, Chlorine--tell me exactly how much
you know."</p>

<p>"I have told you all I know," she said; "it is your turn to
confide in me."</p>

<p>"Not even for your sweet sake, my dearest," I was obliged to say,
"can I break the seal that is set upon my tongue. You must not press
me. Come, let us talk of other things."</p>

<p>But I now saw that matters were worse than I had thought; instead
of the feeble old baronet I should have to deal with a stranger, some
exacting and officious friend or relation perhaps, or, more probably,
a keen family solicitor who would put questions I should not care
about answering, and even be capable of insisting upon strict
settlements.</p>

<p>It was that, of course; they would try to tie my hands by a strict
settlement, with a brace of cautious trustees; unless I was very
careful, all I should get by my marriage would be a paltry
life-interest, contingent upon my surviving my wife.</p>

<p>This revolted me; it seems to me that when law comes in with its
offensively suspicious restraints upon the husband and its
indelicately premature provisions for the offspring, all the poetry
of love is gone at once. By allowing the wife to receive the income
"for her separate use and free from the control of her husband," as
the phrase runs, you infallibly brush the bloom from the peach, and
implant the "little speck within the fruit" which, as Tennyson
beautifully says, will widen by and by and make the music mute.</p>

<p>This may be overstrained on my part, but it represents my honest
conviction; I was determined to have nothing to do with law. If it
was necessary, I felt quite sure enough of Chlorine to defy Sir Paul.
I would refuse to meet a family solicitor anywhere, and I intended to
say so plainly at the first convenient opportunity.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>The opportunity came after dinner that evening when we were all in
the drawing-room, Lady Catafalque dozing uneasily in her armchair
behind a fire screen, and Chlorine, in the further room, playing
funereal dirges in the darkness, and pressing the stiff keys of the
old piano with a languid uncertain touch.</p>

<p>Drawing a chair up to Sir Paul's, I began to broach the subject
calmly and temperately. "I find," I said, "that we have not quite
understood one another over this affair in the Gray Chamber. When I
agreed to an appointment there, I thought--well, it doesn't matter
what I thought, I was a little too premature. What I want to say now
is, that while I have no objection to you, as Chlorine's father,
asking me any questions (in reason) about myself, I feel a delicacy
in discussing my private affairs with a perfect stranger."</p>

<p>His burning eyes looked me through and through; "I don't
understand," he said. "Tell me what you are talking about."</p>

<p>I began all over again, telling him exactly what I felt about
solicitors and settlements. "Are you well?" he asked sternly. "What
have I ever said about settlements or solicitors?"</p>

<p>I saw that I was wrong again, and could only stammer something to
the effect that a remark of Chlorine's had given me this
impression.</p>

<p>"What she could have said to convey such an idea passes my
comprehension," he said gravely; "but she knows nothing---she's a
mere child. I have felt from the first, my boy, that your aunt's
intention was to benefit you quite as much as my own daughter.
Believe me, I shall not attempt to restrict you in any way; I shall
be too rejoiced to see you come forth in safety from the Gray
Chamber."</p>

<p>All the relief I had begun to feel respecting the settlements was
poisoned by these last words.</p>

<p>Why did he talk of that confounded Gray Chamber as if it were a
fiery furnace, or a cage of lions? What mystery was there concealed
beneath all this, and how, since I was obviously supposed to be
thoroughly acquainted with it, could I manage to penetrate the secret
of this perplexing appointment?</p>

<p>While he had been speaking, the faint, mournful music died away,
and, looking up, I saw Chlorine, a pale, slight form, standing framed
in the archway which connected the two rooms.</p>

<p>"Go back to your piano, my child," said the baronet; "Augustus and
I have much to talk about which is not for your ears.</p>

<p>"But why not?" she said; "oh, why not? Papa! Dearest mother!
Augustus! I can bear it no longer! I have often felt of late that we
are living this strange life under the shadow of some fearful Thing,
which would chase all cheerfulness from any home. More than this I
did not seek to know; I dared not ask. But now, when I know that
Augustus, whom I love with my whole heart, must shortly face this
ghastly presence, you cannot wonder if I seek to learn the real
extent of the danger that awaits him! Tell me all. I can bear the
worst--for it cannot be more horrible than my own fears!"</p>

<p>Lady Catafalque had roused herself and was wringing her long
mittened hands and moaning feebly. "Paul," she said, "you must not
tell her; it will kill her; she is not strong!" Her husband seemed
undecided, and I myself began to feel exquisitely uncomfortable.
Chlorine's words pointed to something infinitely more terrible than a
mere solicitor.</p>

<p>"Poor girl," said Sir Paul at last, "it was for your own good that
the whole truth has been thus concealed from you; but now, perhaps,
the time has come when the truest kindness will be to reveal all.
What do you say, Augustus?" "I--I agree with you," I replied faintly;
"she ought to be told."</p>

<p>"Precisely!" he said. "Break to her, then, the nature of the
ordeal which lies before you."</p>

<p>It was the very thing which I wanted to be broken to me! I would
have given the world to know all about it myself, and so I stared at
his gloomy old face with eyes that must have betrayed my helpless
dismay. At last I saved myself by suggesting that such a story would
come less harshly from a parent's lips.</p>

<p>"Well, so be it," he said. "Chlorine, compose yourself, dearest
one; sit down there, and summon up all your fortitude to hear what I
am about to tell you. You must know, then--I think you had better let
your mother give you a cup of tea before I begin; it will steady your
nerves."</p>

<p>During the delay which followed--for Sir Paul did not consider his
daughter sufficiently fortified until she had taken at least three
cups--I suffered tortures of suspense, which I dared not betray.</p>

<p>They never thought of offering me any tea, though the merest
observer might have noticed how very badly I wanted it.</p>

<p>At last the baronet was satisfied, and not without a sort of
gloomy enjoyment and a proud relish of the distinction implied in his
exceptional affliction, he began his weird and almost incredible
tale.</p>

<p>"It is now," said he, "some centuries since our ill-fated house
was first afflicted with the family curse which still attends it. A
certain Humfrey de Catafalque, by his acquaintance with the black
art, as it was said, had procured the services of a species of
familiar, a dread and supernatural being. For some reason he had
conceived a bitter enmity towards his nearest relations, whom he
hated with a virulence that not even death could soften. For, by a
refinement of malice, he bequeathed this baleful thing to his
descendants forever, as an inalienable heirloom! And to this day it
follows the title--and the head of the family for the time being is
bound to provide it with a secret apartment under his own roof. But
that is not the worst as each member of our house succeeds to the
ancestral rank and honors, he must seek an interview with 'The
Curse,' as it has been styled for generations. And, in that
interview, it is decided whether the spell is to be broken and the
Curse depart from us forever--or whether it is to continue its
blighting influence, and hold yet another life in miserable
thraldom."</p>

<p>"And are you one of its thralls then, papa?" faltered
Chlorine.</p>

<p>"I am, indeed," he said. "I failed to quell it, as every
Catafalque, however brave and resolute, has failed yet. It checks all
my accounts, and woe to me if that cold, withering eye discovers the
slightest error--even in the pence column! I could not describe the
extent of my bondage to you, my daughter, or the humiliation of
having to go and tremble monthly before that awful presence.</p>

<p>"Not even yet, old as I am, have I grown quite accustomed to
it!"</p>

<p>Never, in my wildest imaginings, had I anticipated anything one
quarter so dreadful as this; but still I clung to the hope that it
was impossible to bring me into the affair.</p>

<p>"But, Sir Paul," I said--"Sir Paul, you--you mustn't stop there,
or you'll alarm Chlorine more than there's any need to do. She--ha,
ha!--don't you see, she has got some idea into her head that I have
to go through much the same sort of thing. Just explain that to her.
I'm not a Catafalque, Chlorine, so it--it can't interfere with me.
That is so, isn't it, Sir Paul? Good heavens, sir, don't torture her
like this!" I cried, as he was silent. "Speak out!"</p>

<p>"You mean well, Augustus," he said, "but the time for deceiving
her has gone by; she must know the worst. Yes, my poor child," he
continued to Chlorine, whose eyes were wide with terror--though I
fancy mine were even wider--"unhappily, though our beloved Augustus
is not a Catafalque himself, he has of his own free will brought
himself within the influence of the Curse, and he, too, at the
appointed hour, must keep the awful assignation, and brave all that
the most fiendish malevolence can do to shake his resolution."</p>

<p>I could not say a single word; the horror of the idea was
altogether too much for me, and I fell back on my chair in a state of
speechless collapse.</p>

<p>"You see," Sir Paul went on explaining, "it is not only all new
baronets, but every one who would seek an alliance with the females
of our race, who must, by the terms of that strange bequest, also
undergo this trial. It may be in some degree owing to this necessity
that, ever since Humfrey de Catafalque's diabolical testament first
took effect, every maiden of our House has died a spinster." (Here
Chlorine hid her face with a low wail.) "In 1770, it is true, one
solitary suitor was emboldened by love and daring to face the ordeal.
He went calmly and resolutely to the chamber where the Curse was then
lodged, and the next morning they found him outside the door--a
gibbering maniac!"</p>

<p>I writhed on my chair. "Augustus!" cried Chlorine wildly, "promise
me you will not permit the Curse to turn you into a gibbering maniac.
I think if I saw you gibber I should die!"</p>

<p>I was on the verge of gibbering then; I dared not trust myself to
speak.</p>

<p>"Nay, Chlorine," said Sir Paul more cheerfully "there is no cause
for alarm; all has been made smooth for Augustus." (I began to
brighten a little at this.) "His Aunt Petronia had made a special
study of the old-world science of incantation, and had undoubtedly
succeeded at last in discovering the master-word which, employed
according to her directions, would almost certainly break the
unhallowed spell. In her compassionate attachment to us, she formed
the design of persuading a youth of blameless life and antecedents to
present himself as our champion, and the reports she had been given
of our dear Augustus's irreproachable character led her to select him
as a likely instrument. And her confidence in his generosity and
courage was indeed well-founded, for he responded at once to the
appeal of his departed aunt, and, with her instructions for his
safeguard, and the consciousness of his virtue as an additional
protection, there is hope, my child, strong hope, that, though the
struggle may be a long and bitter one, yet Augustus will emerge a
victor!"</p>

<p>I saw very little ground for expecting to emerge as anything of
the kind, or for that matter to emerge at all, except in
installments--for the master-word which was to abash the demon was
probably inside the packet of instructions, and that was certainly
somewhere at the bottom of the sea, outside Melbourne, fathoms below
the surface.</p>

<p>I could bear no more. "It's simply astonishing to me," I said,
"that in the nineteenth century, hardly six miles from Charing Cross,
you can calmly allow this hideous 'Curse,' or whatever you call it,
to have things all its own way like this."</p>

<p>"What can I do, Augustus?" he asked helplessly.</p>

<p>"Do? Anything!" I retorted wildly (for I scarcely knew what I
said). "Take it out for an airing (it must want an airing by this
time); take it out--and lose it! Or get both the archbishops to step
in and lay it for you. Sell the house, and make the purchaser take it
at a valuation, with the other fixtures. I certainly would not live
under the same roof with it. And I want you to understand one
thing--I was never told all this; I have been kept in the dark about
it. Of course I knew there was some kind of a curse in the
family--but I never dreamed of anything so bad as this, and I never
had any intention of being boxed up alone with it either. I shall not
go near the Gray Chamber!"</p>

<p>"Not go near it!" they all cried aghast.</p>

<p>"Not on any account," I said, for I felt firmer and easier now
that I had taken up this position.</p>

<p>"If the Curse has any business with me, let it come down and
settle it here before you all in a plain straightforward manner. Let
us go about it in a businesslike way. On second thoughts," I added,
fearing lest they should find means of carrying out this suggestion,
"I won't meet it anywhere!"</p>

<p>"And why--why won't you meet it?" they asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Because," I explained desperately, "because I'm--I'm a
materialist." (I had not been previously aware that I had any decided
opinions on the question, but I could not stay then to consider the
point.) "How can I have any dealings with a preposterous supernatural
something which my reason forbids me to believe in? You see my
difficulty? It would be inconsistent, to begin with, and--and
extremely painful to both sides."</p>

<p>"No more of this ribaldry," said Sir Paul sternly. "It may be
terribly remembered against you when the hour comes. Keep a guard
over your tongue, for all our sakes, and more especially your own.
Recollect that the Curse knows all that passes beneath this roof. And
do not forget, too, that you are pledged--irrevocably pledged. You
must confront the Curse!"</p>

<p>Only a short hour ago, and I had counted Chlorine's fortune and
Chlorine as virtually mine; and now I saw my golden dreams roughly
shattered forever! And, oh, what a wrench it was to tear myself from
them! What it cost me to speak the words that barred my Paradise to
me forever!</p>

<p>But if I wished to avoid confronting the Curse--and I did wish
this very much--I had no other course. "I had no right to pledge
myself," I said, with quivering lips, "under all the
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Why not," they demanded again; "what circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place," I assured them earnestly, "I'm a base
impostor. I am indeed. I'm not Augustus McFadden at all. My real name
is of no consequence--but it's a prettier one than that.</p>

<p>"As for McFadden, he, I regret to say, is now no more."</p>

<p>Why on earth I could not have told the plain truth here has always
been a mystery to me. I suppose I had been lying so long that it was
difficult to break myself of this occasionally inconvenient trick at
so short a notice, but I certainly mixed things up to a hopeless
extent.</p>

<p>"Yes," I continued mournfully, "McFadden is dead; I will tell you
how he died if you would care to know. During his voyage here he fell
overboard, and was almost instantly appropriated by a gigantic shark,
when, as I happened to be present, I enjoyed the melancholy privilege
of seeing him pass away. For one brief moment I beheld him between
the jaws of the creature, so pale but so composed (I refer to
McFadden, you understand--not the shark), he threw just one glance up
at me, and with a smile, the sad sweetness of which I shall never
forget (it was McFadden's smile, I mean, of course--not the shark's),
he, courteous and considerate to the last, requested me to break the
news and remember him very kindly to you all. And, in the same
instant, he abruptly vanished within the monster--and I saw neither
of them again!"</p>

<p>Of course in bringing the shark in at all I was acting directly
contrary to my instructions, but I quite forgot them in my anxiety to
escape the acquaintance of the Curse of the Catafalques.</p>

<p>"If this is true, sir," said the baronet haughtily when I had
finished, "you have indeed deceived us basely."</p>

<p>"That," I replied, "is what I was endeavoring to bring out. You
see, it puts it quite out of my power to meet your family Curse. I
should not feel justified in intruding upon it. So, if you will
kindly let some one fetch a fly or a cab in half an hour--"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Chlorine. "Augustus, as I will call you still, you
must not go like this. If you have stooped to deceit, it was for love
of me, and--and Mr. McFadden is dead. If he had been alive, I should
have felt it my duty to allow him an opportunity of winning my
affection, but he is lying in his silent tomb, and--and I have learnt
to love you. Stay, then; stay and brave the Curse; we may yet be
happy!"</p>

<p>I saw how foolish I had been not to tell the truth at first, and I
hastened to repair this error.</p>

<p>"When I described McFadden as dead," I said hoarsely, "it was a
loose way of putting the facts--because, to be quite accurate, he
isn't dead. We found out afterwards that it was another fellow the
shark had swallowed, and, in fact, another shark altogether. So he is
alive and well now, at Melbourne, but when he came to know about the
Curse, he was too much frightened to come across, and he asked me to
call and make his excuses. I have now done so, and will trespass no
further on your kindness--if you will tell somebody to bring a
vehicle of any sort in a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the baronet, "but we cannot part in this way. I
feared when first I saw you that your resolution might give way under
the strain; it is only natural, I admit. But you deceive yourself if
you think we cannot see that these extraordinary and utterly
contradictory stories are prompted by sudden panic. I quite
understand it, Augustus; I cannot blame you; but to allow you to
withdraw now would be worse than weakness on my part. The panic will
pass, you will forget these fears tomorrow, you must forget them;
remember, you have promised. For your own sake, I shall take care
that you do not forfeit that solemn bond, for I dare not let you run
the danger of exciting the Curse by a deliberate insult."</p>

<p>I saw clearly that his conduct was dictated by a deliberate and
most repulsive selfishness; he did not entirely believe me, but he
was determined that if there was any chance that I, whoever I might
be, could free him from his present thraldom, he would not let it
escape him.</p>

<p>I raved, I protested, I implored--all in vain; they would not
believe a single word I said, they positively refused to release me,
and insisted upon my performing my engagement.</p>

<p>And at last Chlorine and her mother left the room, with a little
contempt for my unworthiness mingled with their evident compassion;
and a little later Sir Paul conducted me to my room, and locked me in
"till," as he said, "I had returned to my senses."</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>What a night I passed, as I tossed sleeplessly from side to side
under the canopy of my old-fashioned bedstead, torturing my fevered
brain with vain speculations as to the fate the morrow was to bring
me.</p>

<p>I felt myself perfectly helpless; I saw no way out of it; they
seemed bent upon offering me up as a sacrifice to this private Moloch
of theirs. The baronet was quite capable of keeping me locked up all
the next day and pushing me into the Gray Chamber to take my chance
when the hour came.</p>

<p>If I had only some idea what the Curse was like to look at, I
thought I might not feel quite so afraid of it; the vague and
impalpable awfulness of the thing was intolerable, and the very
thought of it caused me to fling myself about in an ecstasy of
horror.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, as daybreak came near, I grew calmer--until
at length I arrived at a decision. It seemed evident to me that, as I
could not avoid my fate, the wisest course was to go forth to meet it
with as good a grace as possible. Then, should I by some fortunate
accident come well out of it, my fortune was ensured.</p>

<p>But if I went on repudiating my assumed self to the very last, I
should surely arouse a suspicion which the most signal rout of the
Curse would not serve to dispel.</p>

<p>And after all, as I began to think, the whole thing had probably
been much exaggerated; if I could only keep my head, and exercise all
my powers of cool impudence, I might contrive to hoodwink this
formidable relic of medieval days, which must have fallen rather
behind the age by this time. It might even turn out to be (although I
was hardly sanguine as to this) as big a humbug as I was myself, and
we should meet with confidential winks, like the two augurs.</p>

<p>But, at all events, I resolved to see this mysterious affair out,
and trust to my customary good luck to bring me safely through, and
so, having found the door unlocked, I came down to breakfast
something like my usual self, and set myself to remove the
unfavorable impression I had made on the previous night.</p>

<p>They did it from consideration for me, but still it was mistaken
kindness for them all to leave me entirely to my own thoughts during
the whole of the day, for I was driven to mope alone about the
gloom-laden building, until by dinnertime I was very low indeed from
nervous depression.</p>

<p>We dined in almost unbroken silence; now and then, as Sir Paul saw
my hand approaching a decanter, he would open his lips to observe
that I should need the clearest head and the firmest nerve ere long,
and warn me solemnly against the brown sherry; from time to time,
too, Chlorine and her mother stole apprehensive glances at me, and
sighed heavily between every course. I never remember eating a dinner
with so little enjoyment.</p>

<p>The meal came to an end at last; the ladies rose, and Sir Paul and
I were left to brood over the dessert. I fancy both of us felt a
delicacy in starting a conversation, and before I could hit upon a
safe remark, Lady Catafalque and her daughter returned, dressed, to
my unspeakable horror, in readiness to go out. Worse than that even,
Sir Paul apparently intended to accompany them, for he rose at their
entrance.</p>

<p>"It is now time for us to bid you a solemn farewell, Augustus," he
said, in his hollow old voice.</p>

<p>"You have three hours before you yet, and if you are wise, you
will spend them in earnest self-preparation.</p>

<p>"At midnight, punctually, for you must not dare to delay, you will
go to the Gray Chamber--the way thither you know, and you will find
the Curse prepared for you. Good-bye, then, brave and devoted boy;
stand firm, and no harm can befall you!"</p>

<p>"You are going away, all of you!" I cried. They were not what you
might call a gay family to sit up with, but even their society was
better than my own.</p>

<p>"Upon these dread occasions," he explained, "it is absolutely
forbidden for any human being but one to remain in the house. All the
servants have already left, and we are about to take our departure
for a private hotel near the Strand. We shall just have time, if we
start at once, to inspect the Soane Museum on our way thither, which
will serve as some distraction from the terrible anxiety we shall be
feeling."</p>

<p>At this I believe I positively howled with terror; all my old
panic came back with a rush.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me all alone with It!" I cried; "I shall go mad if
you do!"</p>

<p>Sir Paul simply turned on his heel in silent contempt, and his
wife followed him; but Chlorine remained behind for one instant, and
somehow, as she gazed at me with a yearning pity in her sad eyes, I
thought I had never seen her looking so pretty before.</p>

<p>"Augustus," she said, "get up." (I suppose I must have been on the
floor somewhere.) "Be a man; show us we were not mistaken in you. You
know I would spare you this if I could; but we are powerless. Oh, be
brave, or I shall lose you forever!"</p>

<p>Her appeal did seem to put a little courage into me; I staggered
up and kissed her slender hand and vowed sincerely to be worthy of
her.</p>

<p>And then she too passed out, and the heavy hall door slammed
behind the three, and the rusty old gate screeched like a banshee as
it swung back and closed with a clang.</p>

<p>I heard the carriage-wheels grind the slush, and the next moment I
knew that I was shut up on Christmas eve in that somber mansion--with
the Curse of the Catafalques as my sole companion.</p>

<p>I don't think the generous ardor with which Chlorine's last words
had inspired me lasted very long, for I caught myself shivering
before the clock struck nine, and, drawing up a clumsy leathern
armchair close to the fire, I piled on the logs and tried to get rid
of a certain horrible sensation of internal vacancy which was
beginning to afflict me.</p>

<p>I tried to look my situation fairly in the face; whatever reason
and common sense had to say about it, there seemed no possible doubt
that something of a supernatural order was shut up in that great
chamber down the corridor, and also that, if I meant to win Chlorine,
I must go up and have some kind of an interview with it. Once more I
wished I had some definite idea to go upon; what description of being
should I find this Curse? Would it be aggressively ugly, like the
bogie of my infancy, or should I see a lank and unsubstantial shape,
draped in clinging black, with nothing visible beneath it but a pair
of burning hollow eyes and one long pale bony hand? Really I could
not decide which would be the more trying of the two.</p>

<p>By and by I began to recollect unwillingly all the frightful
stories I had ever read; one in particular came back to me--the
adventure of a foreign marshal who, after much industry, succeeded
in invoking an evil spirit, which came bouncing into the room shaped
like a gigantic ball, with, I think, a hideous face in the middle of
it, and would not be got rid of until the horrified marshal had spent
hours in hard praying and persistent exorcism!</p>

<p>What should I do if the Curse was a globular one and came rolling
all round the room after me?</p>

<p>Then there was another appalling tale I had read in some
magazine--a tale of a secret chamber, too, and in some respects a
very similar case to my own, for there the heir of some great house
had to go in and meet a mysterious aged person with strange eyes and
an evil smile, who kept attempting to shake hands with him.</p>

<p>Nothing should induce me to shake hands with the Curse of the
Catafalques, however apparently friendly I might find it.</p>

<p>But it was not very likely to be friendly, for it was one of those
mystic powers of darkness which know nearly everything--it would
detect me as an impostor directly, and what would become of me? I
declare I almost resolved to confess all and sob out my deceit upon
its bosom, and the only thing which made me pause was the reflection
that probably the Curse did not possess a bosom.</p>

<p>By this time I had worked myself up to such a pitch of terror that
I found it absolutely necessary to brace my nerves, and I did brace
them. I emptied all the three decanters, but as Sir Paul's cellar was
none of the best, the only result was that, while my courage and
daring were not perceptibly heightened, I was conscious of feeling
exceedingly unwell.</p>

<p>Tobacco, no doubt, would have calmed and soothed me, but I did not
dare to smoke. For the Curse, being old-fashioned, might object to
the smell of it, and I was anxious to avoid exciting its prejudices
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>And so I simply sat in my chair and shook. Every now and then I
heard steps on the frosty path outside: sometimes a rapid tread, as
of some happy person bound to scenes of Christmas revelry, and little
dreaming of the miserable wretch he was passing; sometimes the slow
creaking tramp of the Fulham policeman on his beat.</p>

<p>What if I called him in and gave the Curse into custody---either
for putting me in bodily fear (as it was undeniably doing), or for
being found on the premises under suspicious circumstances?</p>

<p>There was a certain audacity about this means of cutting the knot
that fascinated me at first, but still I did not venture to adopt it,
thinking it most probable that the stolid constable would decline to
interfere as soon as he knew the facts; and even if he did, it would
certainly annoy Sir Paul extremely to hear of his Family Curse
spending its Christmas in a police cell, and I felt instinctively
that he would consider it a piece of unpardonable bad taste on my
part.</p>

<p>So one hour passed. A few minutes after ten I heard more footsteps
and voices in low consultation, as if a band of men had collected
outside the railings. Could there be any indication without of the
horrors these walls contained?</p>

<p>But no; the gaunt housefront kept its secret too well; they were
merely the waits. They saluted me with the old carol, "God rest you,
merry gentleman, let nothing you dismay!" which should have
encouraged me, but it didn't and they followed that up by a wheezy
but pathetic rendering of "The Mistletoe Bough."</p>

<p>For a time I did not object to them; while they were scraping and
blowing outside I felt less abandoned and cut off from human help,
and then they might arouse softer sentiments in the Curse upstairs by
their seasonable strains: these things do happen at Christmas
sometimes. But their performance was really so infernally bad that it
was calculated rather to irritate than subdue any evil spirit, and
very soon I rushed to the window and beckoned to them furiously to go
away.</p>

<p>Unhappily, they thought I was inviting them indoors for
refreshment, and came round to the gate, when they knocked and rang
incessantly for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>This must have stirred the Curse up quite enough, but when they
had gone, there came a man with a barrel organ, which was suffering
from some complicated internal disorder, causing it to play its whole
repertory at once, in maddening discords. Even the grinder himself
seemed dimly aware that his instrument was not doing itself justice,
for he would stop occasionally, as if to ponder or examine it. But he
was evidently a sanguine person and had hopes of bringing it round by
a little perseverance; so, as Parson's Green was well-suited by its
quiet for this mode of treatment, he remained there till he must have
reduced the Curse to a rampant and rabid condition.</p>

<p>He went at last, and then the silence that followed began to my
excited fancy (for I certainly saw nothing) to be invaded by strange
sounds that echoed about the old house. I heard sharp reports from
the furniture, sighing moans in the draughty passages, doors opening
and shutting, and--worse still--stealthy padding footsteps, both
above and in the ghostly hall outside!</p>

<p>I sat there in an ice-cold perspiration, until my nerves required
more bracing, to effect which I had recourse to the spirit-case.</p>

<p>And after a short time my fears began to melt away rapidly. What a
ridiculous bugbear I was making of this thing after all! Was I not
too hasty in setting it down as ugly and hostile before I had seen
it... how did I know it was anything which deserved my horror?</p>

<p>Here a gush of sentiment came over me at the thought that it might
be that for long centuries the poor Curse had been cruelly
misunderstood--that it might be a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>I was so affected by the thought that I resolved to go up at once
and wish it a merry Christmas through the keyhole, just to show that
I came in no unfriendly spirit.</p>

<p>But would not that seem as if I was afraid of it? I scorned the
idea of being afraid. Why, for two straws, I would go straight in and
pull its nose for it--if it had a nose! I went out with this object,
not very steadily, but before I had reached the top of the dim and
misty staircase, I had given up all ideas of defiance, and merely
intended to go as far as the corridor by way of a preliminary
canter.</p>

<p>The coffin-lid door stood open, and I looked apprehensively down
the corridor; the grim metal fittings on the massive door of the Gray
Chamber were gleaming with a mysterious pale light, something between
the phenomena obtained by electricity and the peculiar
phosphorescence observable in a decayed shellfish; under the door I
saw the reflection of a sullen red glow, and within I could hear
sounds like the roar of a mighty wind, above which peals of fiendish
mirth rang out at intervals, and were followed by a hideous dull
clanking.</p>

<p>It seemed only too evident that the Curse was getting up the steam
for our interview. I did not stay there long, because I was afraid
that it might dart out suddenly and catch me eavesdropping, which
would be a hopelessly bad beginning. I got back to the dining room,
somehow; the fire had taken advantage of my short absence to go out,
and I was surprised to find by the light of the fast-dimming lamp
that it was a quarter to twelve already.</p>

<p>Only fifteen more fleeting minutes and then--unless I gave tip
Chlorine and her fortune forever--I must go up and knock at that
awful door, and enter the presence of the frightful mystic Thing that
was roaring and laughing and clanking on the other side!</p>

<p>Stupidly I sat and stared at the clock; in five minutes, now, I
should be beginning my desperate duel with one of the powers of
darkness--a thought which gave me sickening qualms.</p>

<p>I was clinging to the thought that I had still two precious
minutes left--perhaps my last moments of safety and sanity---when the
lamp expired with a gurgling sob, and left me in the dark.</p>

<p>I was afraid of sitting there all alone any longer, and besides,
if I lingered, the Curse might come down and fetch me. The horror of
this idea made me resolve to go up at once, especially as scrupulous
punctuality might propitiate it.</p>

<p>Groping my way to the door, I reached the hall and stood there,
swaying under the old stained-glass lantern. And then I made a
terrible discovery. I was not in a condition to transact any
business; I had disregarded Sir Paul's well-meant warning at dinner;
I was not my own master. I was lost!</p>

<p>The clock in the adjoining room tolled twelve, and from without
the distant steeples proclaimed in faint peals and chimes that it was
Christmas morn. My hour had come!</p>

<p>Why did I not mount those stairs? I tried again and again, and
fell down every time, and at each attempt I knew the Curse would be
getting more and more impatient.</p>

<p>I was quite five minutes late, and yet, with all my eagerness to
be punctual, I could not get up that staircase. It was a horrible
situation, but it was not at its worst even then, for I heard a
jarring sound above, as if heavy rusty bolts were being
withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Curse was coming down to see what had become of me! I should
have to confess my inability to go upstairs without assistance, and
so place myself wholly at its mercy!</p>

<p>I made one more desperate effort, and then--and then, upon my
word, I don't know how it was exactly--but, as I looked wildly about,
I caught sight of my hat on the hat-rack below, and the thoughts it
roused in me proved too strong for resistance. Perhaps it was weak of
me, but I venture to think that very few men in my position would
have behaved any better.</p>

<p>I renounced my ingenious and elaborate scheme forever, the door
(fortunately for me) was neither locked nor bolted, and the next
moment I was running for my life along the road to Chelsea, urged on
by the fancy that the Curse itself was in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>For weeks after that I lay in hiding, starting at every sound, so
fearful was I that the outraged Curse might track me down at last;
all my worldly possessions were at Parson's Green, and I could not
bring myself to write or call for them, nor indeed have I seen any of
the Catafalques since that awful Christmas eve.</p>

<p>I wish to have nothing more to do with them, for I feel naturally
that they took a cruel advantage of my youth and inexperience, and I
shall always resent the deception and constraint to which I so nearly
fell a victim.</p>

<p>But it occurs to me that those who may have followed my strange
story with any curiosity and interest may be slightly disappointed at
its conclusion, which I cannot deny is a lame and unsatisfactory
one.</p>

<p>They expected, no doubt, to be told what the Curse's personal
appearance is, and how it comports itself in that ghastly Gray
Chamber, what it said to me, and what I said to it, and what happened
after that.</p>

<p>This information, as will be easily understood, I cannot pretend
to give, and, for myself, I have long ceased to feel the slightest
curiosity on any of these points. But for the benefit of such as are
less indifferent, I may suggest that almost any eligible bachelor
would easily obtain the opportunities I failed to enjoy by simply
calling at the old mansion at Parson's Green, and presenting himself
to the baronet as a suitor for his daughter's hand.</p>

<p>I shall be most happy to allow my name to be used as a
reference.</p>
