<h1>The Desert Islander</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Stella Benson</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>CONSTANTINE hopefully followed the Chinese servant through the
unknown house. He felt hopeful of success in his plan of begging this
Englishman for help, for he knew that an Englishman, alone among
people of a different colour (as this Englishman was alone in this
South China town), treated the helping of stray white men almost as
part of the White Man's Burden. But even without his claim of one
lonely white man upon another, Constantine would have felt hopeful.
He knew himself to be a man of compelling manner in spite of his
ugly, too long face, and his ugly, too short legs.</p>

<p>As Constantine stumped in on his hobnailed soles, Mr. White--who
was evidently not a very tactful man--said, "Oh, are you another
deserter from the Foreign Legion?"</p>

<p>"I am Constantine Andreievitch Soloviev," said Constantine,
surprised. He spoke and understood English almost perfectly (his
mother had been English), yet he could not remember ever having heard
the word another applied to himself. In fact it did not--could not
possibly--so apply. There was only one of him, he knew.</p>

<p>Of course, in a way there was some sense in what this stupid
Englishman said. Constantine had certainly been a l&eacute;gionnaire
in Tonkin up till last Thursday--his narrow pipe-clayed helmet, stiff
khaki greatcoat, shabby drill uniform, puttees, brass buttons, and
inflexible boots were all the property of the French Government. But
the core--the pearl inside this vulgar, horny shell--was Constantine
Andreievitch Soloviev. That made all the difference.</p>

<p>Constantine saw that he must take this Didymus of an Englishman in
hand at once and tell him a few exciting stories about his dangerous
adventures between the Tonkin border and this Chinese city. Snakes,
tigers, love-crazed Chinese princesses and brigands passed rapidly
through his mind, and he chose the last, because he had previously
planned several impressive things to do if he should be attacked by
brigands. So now, though he had not actually met a brigand, those
plans would come in useful. Constantine intended to write his
autobiography some day when he should have married a rich wife and
settled down. Not only did his actual life seem to him a very rare
one but, also, lives were so interesting to make up.</p>

<p>Constantine was a desert islander--a spiritual Robinson Crusoe. He
made up everything himself and he wasted nothing. Robinson Crusoe was
his favourite book--in fact, almost the only book he had ever
read--and he was proud to be, like his hero, a desert islander. He
actually preferred clothing his spirit in the skins of wild thoughts
that had been the prey of his wits and sheltering it from the world's
weather in a leaky hut of his brain's own contriving, to enjoying the
good tailoring and housing that dwellers on the mainland call
experience and education. He enjoyed being barbarous, he enjoyed
living alone on his island, accepting nothing, imitating nothing,
believing nothing, adapting himself to nothing--implacably home-made.
Even his tangible possessions were those of a marooned man rather
than of a civilized citizen of this well-furnished world. At this
moment his only luggage was a balalaika that he had made himself out
of cigar-boxes, and to this he sang songs of his own
composition--very imperfect songs. He would not have claimed that
either his songs or his instrument were better than the songs and
instruments made by song-makers and balalaika-makers; they were,
however, much more rapturously his than any acquired music could have
been and, indeed, in this as in almost all things, it simply never
occurred to him to take rather than make. There was no mainland on
the horizon of his desert island.</p>

<p>"I am not a beggar," said Constantine. "Until yesterday I had
sixty piastres which I had saved by many sacrifices during my service
in the Legion. But yesterday, passing through a dark forest of pines
in the twilight, about twenty versts from here, I met---"</p>

<p>"You met a band of brigands," said Mr. White. "Yes, I know you all
say that."</p>

<p>Constantine stared at him. He had not lived, a desert islander, in
a crowded and over-civilized world without meeting many rebuffs, so
this one did not surprise him--did not even offend him. On the
contrary, for a minute he almost loved the uncompromising Mr. White,
as a sportsman almost loves the chamois on a peculiarly inaccessible
crag. This was a friend worth a good deal of trouble to secure,
Constantine saw. He realized at once that the desert islander's line
here was to discard the brigands and to discard noble
independence.</p>

<p>"Very well then," said Constantine. "I did not meet brigands. I am
a beggar. I started without a penny and I still have no penny. I hope
you will give me something. That is why I have come." He paused,
drawing long pleased breaths through his large nose. This, he felt,
was a distinctly self-made line of talk; it set him apart from all
previous deserting l&eacute;gionnaires.</p>

<p>Mr. White evidently thought so too. He gave a short grunting
laugh. "That's better," he said.</p>

<p>"These English," thought Constantine lovingly. "They are the next
best thing to being originals, for they admire originals." "I like
you," he added extravagantly, aloud. "I like the English. I am so
glad I found an Englishman to beg of instead of an American--though
an American would have been much richer than you are, I expect.
Still, to a beggar a little is enough. I dislike Americans; I dislike
their women's wet finger-nails."</p>

<p>"Wet finger-nails?" exclaimed Mr. White. "Oh, you mean their
manicure polishes. Yes ... they do always have wet finger-nails ...
ha, ha ... so they do. I should never have thought of that
myself."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Constantine, genuinely surprised. "I thought
of it. Why should you have thought of it?" After a moment he added,
"I am not a gramophone."</p>

<p>Mr. White thought that he had said, "Have you got a gramophone?"
and replied at once with some pleasure, "Yes, I have--it is a very
precious companion. Are you musical? But of course you are, being
Russian. I should be very lonely without my daily ration of Chopin.
Would you like some music while the servants are getting you
something to eat?"</p>

<p>"I should like some music," said Constantine, "but I should not
like to hear a gramophone. I will play you some music--some unique
and only music on a unique and only instrument."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Mr. White, peering doubtfully through
his glasses at the cigar-box balalaika. "What good English you
speak," he added, trying to divert his guest's attention from his
musical purpose. "But all Russians, of course, are wonderful
linguists."</p>

<p>"I will play you my music," said Constantine. "But first I must
tell you that I do not like you to say to me, 'Being Russian you are
musical' or 'All Russians speak good English.' To me it seems so
stupid to see me as one of many."</p>

<p>"Each one of us is one of many," sighed Mr. White patiently.</p>

<p>"You, perhaps--but I, not," said Constantine. "When you notice my
English words instead of my thoughts it seems to me that you are
listening wrongly--you are listening to sounds only, in the same way
as you listen to your senseless gramophone---"</p>

<p>"But you haven't heard my gramophone," interrupted Mr. White,
stung on his darling's behalf.</p>

<p>"What does it matter what sounds a man makes--what words he uses?
Words are common to all men; thoughts belong to one man only."</p>

<p>Mr. White considered telling his guest to go to hell, but he said
instead, "You're quite a philosopher, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite an anything," said Constantine abruptly. "I am me.
All people who like Chopin also say, 'You're quite a
philosopher.'"</p>

<p>"Now you're generalizing, yourself," said Mr. White, clinging to
his good temper. "Exactly what you've just complained of my
doing."</p>

<p>"Some people are general," said Constantine. "Now I will play you
my music, and you will admit that it is not one of many musics."</p>

<p>He sang a song with Russian words which Mr. White did not
understand. As a matter of fact, such was Constantine's horror of
imitating that the words of his song were just a list of the names of
the diseases of horses, learned while Constantine was a veterinary
surgeon in the Ukraine. His voice was certainly peculiar to himself;
it was hoarse--so hoarse that one felt as if a light cough or a
discreet blowing of that long nose would clear the hoarseness away;
it was veiled, as though heard from behind an intervening stillness;
yet with all its hoarseness and unsonorousness, it was flexible,
alive, and exciting. His instrument had the same quality of quiet
ugliness and oddity; it was almost enchanting. It was as if an
animal--say, a goat--had found a way to control its voice into a
crude goblin concord.</p>

<p>"That's my music," said Constantine. "Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Frankly," said Mr. White, "I prefer Chopin."</p>

<p>"On the gramophone?"</p>

<p>"On the gramophone."</p>

<p>"Yet one is a thing you never heard before and will never hear
again--and the other is a machine that makes the same sound for
millions."</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>Constantine chewed his upper lip for a minute, thinking this over.
Then he shook himself. "Nevertheless, I like you," he said
insolently. "You are almost a person. Would you like me to tell you
about my life, or would you rather I explained to you my idea about
Zigzags?"</p>

<p>"I would rather see you eat a good meal," said Mr. White, roused
to a certain cordiality--as almost all Anglo-Saxons are--by the
opportunity of dispensing food and drink.</p>

<p>"I can tell you my Zigzag idea while I eat," said Constantine,
leading the way towards the table at the other end of the room. "Are
you not eating too?"</p>

<p>"I'm not in the habit of eating a meat meal at ten o'clock at
night."</p>

<p>"Is 'not being in the habit' a reason for not doing it now?"</p>

<p>"To me it is."</p>

<p>"Oh--oh--oh--I wish I were like you," said Constantine vehemently.
"It is so tiring being me--having no guide. I do like you."</p>

<p>"Help yourself to spinach," said Mr. White crossly.</p>

<p>"Now shall I tell you my Zigzag idea?"</p>

<p>"If you can eat as well as talk."</p>

<p>Constantine was exceedingly hungry; he bent low over his plate,
though he sat sideways to the table, facing Mr. White, ready to
launch a frontal attack of talk. His mouth was too full for a moment
to allow him to begin to speak, but quick, agonized glances out of
his black eyes implored his host to be silent till his lips should be
ready. "You know," he said, swallowing hurriedly, "I always think of
a zigzag as going downwards. I draw it in the air, so ... a straight
honest line, then--see--a diagonal subtle line cuts the air away from
under it--so ... Do you see what I mean? I will call the zig a to,
and the zag a from. Now---"</p>

<p>"Why is one of your legs fatter than the other?" asked Mr.
White.</p>

<p>"It is bandaged. Now, I think of this zigzag as a diagram of human
minds. Always human minds are zigs or zags--a to or a from--the brave
zig is straight, so ... the cleverer, crueller zag cuts away below.
So are men's---"</p>

<p>"But why is it bandaged?"</p>

<p>"It was kicked by a horse. Well, so are men's understandings. Here
I draw the simple, faithful understanding--and here--zag--the easy,
clever understanding that sees through the simple faith. Now below
that--see--zig once more--the wise, the serene, and now a zag
contradicts once more; this is the cynic who knows all answers to
serenity. Then below, once more---"</p>

<p>"May I see your leg?" asked Mr. White. "I was in an ambulance unit
during the war."</p>

<p>"Oh, what is this talk of legs?" cried Constantine. "Legs are all
the same; they belong to millions. All legs are made of blood and
bone and muscle--all vulgar things. Your ambulance cuts off legs,
mends legs, fits bones together, corks up blood. It treats men like
bundles of bones and blood. This is so dull. Bodies are so dull.
Minds are the only onliness in men."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. White. "But minds have to have legs to walk about
on. Let me see your leg."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, let us talk of legs. We have at least legs in
common, you and I."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you got more sense than to put such a dirty rag round an
open wound?"</p>

<p>"It is not dirty; it is simply of a grey colour. I washed it in a
rice field." Constantine spoke in a muffled voice from somewhere near
his knee-cap, for he was now bent double, wholeheartedly interested
in his leg. "I washed the wound too, and three boils which are behind
my knee. This blackness is not dirt; it is a blackness belonging to
the injury."</p>

<p>Mr. White said nothing, but he rose to his feet as though he had
heard a call. Constantine, leaving his puttee in limp coils about his
foot like a dead snake, went on eating. He began to talk again about
the zigzag while he stuffed food into his mouth, but he stopped
talking soon, for Mr. White was walking up and down the long room and
not pretending to listen. Constantine, watching his host restively
pacing the far end of the room, imagined that he himself perhaps
smelled disagreeable, for this was a constant fear of his--that his
body should play his rare personality this horrid trick. "What is the
matter?" he asked anxiously, with a shamed look. "Why are you so
far?"</p>

<p>Mr. White's lazy, mild manner was quite changed. His voice seemed
to burst out of seething irritation. "It's a dam nuisance just now.
It couldn't happen at a worse time. I've a great deal of work to
do--and this fighting all over the province makes a journey so
dam---"</p>

<p>"What is so dam?" asked Constantine, his bewilderment affecting
his English.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Mr. White, standing in front of
Constantine with his feet wide apart and speaking in an angry voice.
"You're going to bed now in my attic, and to-morrow at daylight
you're going to be waked up and driven down in my car, by me (damn
it!) to Lao-chow, to the hospital--a two days' drive--three hundred
miles-over the worst roads you ever saw."</p>

<p>Constantine's heart gave a sickening lurch. "Why to hospital? You
think my leg is dangerous?"</p>

<p>"If I know anything of legs," said Mr. White rather brutally, "the
doctor won't let you keep that one an hour longer than he has
to."</p>

<p>Constantine's mouth began instantly to tremble so much that he
could scarcely speak. He thought, "I shall die--I shall die like
this--of a stupid black leg--this valuable lonely me will die."</p>

<p>He glared at Mr. White, hungry for consolation. "He isn't
valuable--he's one of many ... of course he could easily be
brave."</p>

<p>Mr. White, once more indolent and indifferent, led the little
Russian to the attic and left him there. As soon as Constantine saw
the white sheets neatly folded back, the pleasant blue rugs squarely
set upon the floor, the open wardrobe fringed with hangers, he
doubted whether, after all, he did value himself so much. For in this
neat room he felt betrayed by this body of his--this unwashed,
unshaven, tired body, encased in coarse dirty clothes, propped on an
offensive, festering leg. He decided to take all his clothes off,
even though he had no other garment with him to put on; he would feel
more appropriate to the shiny linen in his own shiny skin, he
thought. He would have washed, but his attention was diverted as be
pulled his clothes off by the wound on his leg. Though it was not
very painful, it made him nearly sick with disgust now. Every nerve
in his body seemed on tiptoe, alert to feel agony, as he studied the
wound. He saw that a new sore place was beginning, well above the
knee. With only his shirt on, he rushed downstairs, and in at the
only lighted doorway. "Look--look," he cried. "A new sore place....
Does this mean the danger is greater even than we thought?"</p>

<p>Mr. White, in neat blue-and-white pyjamas, was carefully pressing
a tie in a tie-press. Constantine had never felt so far away from a
human being in his life as he felt on seeing the tie-press, those
pyjamas, those monogrammed silver brushes, that elastic apparatus for
reducing exercises that hung upon the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to bed," said Mr. White irascibly. "For God's sake, show a
little sense."</p>

<p>Constantine was back in his attic before he thought, "I ought to
have said, 'For God's sake, show a little nonsense yourself.' Sense
is so vulgar."</p>

<p>Sense, however, was to drive him three hundred miles to safety,
next day.</p>

<p>All night the exhausted Constantine, sleeping only for a few
minutes at a time, dreamed trivial, broken dreams about establishing
his own superiority, finding, for instance, that he had after all
managed to bring with him a suitcase full of clean, fashionable
clothes, or noticing that his host was wearing a filthy bandage round
his neck instead of a tie.</p>

<p>Constantine was asleep when Mr. White, fully dressed, woke him
next morning. A clear, steely light was slanting in at the window.
Constantine was always fully conscious at the second of waking, and
he was immediately horrified to see Mr. White looking
expressionlessly at the disorderly heap of dirty clothes that he had
thrown in disgust on the floor the night before. Trying to divert his
host's attention, Constantine put on a merry and courageous manner.
"Well, how is the weather for our motor-car jaunt?"</p>

<p>"It could hardly be worse," said Mr. White placidly. "Sheets of
rain. God knows what the roads will be like."</p>

<p>"Well, we are lucky to have roads at all, in this benighted
China."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. If there weren't any roads we shouldn't
be setting off on this beastly trip."</p>

<p>"I shall be ready in two jiffies," said Constantine, springing
naked out of bed and shuffling his dreadful clothes out of Mr.
White's sight. "But just tell me," he added as his host went through
the door, "why do you drive three hundred miles on a horrible wet day
just to take a perfect stranger--a beggar too--to hospital?" (He
thought, "Now he must say something showing that he recognizes my
value.")</p>

<p>"Because I can't cut off your leg myself," said Mr. White
gloomily. Constantine did not press his question because this new
reference to the Cutting off of legs set his nerves jangling again;
his hands trembled so that he could scarcely button his clothes.
Service in the Foreign Legion, though it was certainly no suitable
adventure for a rare and sensitive man, had never obliged him to face
anything more frightening than non-appreciation, coarse food, and
stupid treatment. None of these things could humiliate him--on the
contrary, all confirmed him in his persuasion of his own value. Only
the thought of being at the mercy of his body could humiliate the
excited and glowing spirit of Constantine. Death was the final, most
loathsome triumph of the body; death meant dumbness and decay--yet
even death he could have faced courageously could he have been
flattered to its very brink.</p>

<p>The car, a ramshackle Ford, stood in the rain on the bald gravel
of the compound, as Constantine, white with excitement, limped out
through the front door. His limp, though not consciously assumed, had
developed only since last night. His whole leg now felt dangerous,
its skin shrinking and tingling. Constantine looked into the car. In
the back seat sat Mr. White's coolie, clasping a conspicuously neat
little white canvas kit-bag with leather straps. The kit-bag held
Constantine's eye and attacked his self-respect as the tie-press had
attacked and haunted him the night before. Every one of his host's
possessions was like a perfectly well-balanced, indisputable
statement in a world of fevered conjecture. "And a camp-bed--so
nicely rolled," said Constantine, leaning into the car, fascinated
and humiliated. "But only one...."</p>

<p>"I have only one," said Mr. White.</p>

<p>"And you are bringing it--for me?" said Constantine, looking at
him ardently, overjoyed at this tribute.</p>

<p>"I am bringing it for myself," said Mr. White with his unamused
and short-sighted smile. "I am assuming that a l&eacute;gionnaire is
used to sleeping rough. I'm not. I'm rather fixed in my habits and I
have a horror of the arrangements in Chinese inns."</p>

<p>"He is morally brave," thought Constantine, though, for the first
time, it occurred to him how satisfactory it would be to slap his
host's face. "A man less brave would have changed his plans about the
camp-bed at once and said, 'For you, my dear man, of course--why
not?'" Constantine chattered nervously as he took his seat in the car
next to his host, the driver. "I feel such admiration for a man who
can drive a motor-car. I adore the machine when it does not--like the
gramophone--trespass on matters outside its sphere. The machine's
sphere is space, you see--it controls space--and that is so
admirable--even when the machine is so very unimpressive as this one.
Mr. White, your motor-car is very unimpressive indeed. Are you sure
it will run three hundred miles?"</p>

<p>"It always seems to," said Mr. White. "I never do anything to it
except pour petrol, oil, and water into the proper openings. I am
completely unmechanical."</p>

<p>"You cannot be if you work a gramophone."</p>

<p>"You seem to have my gramophone on your mind. To me it doesn't
answer the purpose of a machine--it simply is Chopin, to me."</p>

<p>Constantine stamped his foot in almost delighted irritation, for
this made him feel a god beside this groundling. After a few minutes
of self-satisfaction, however, a terrible thought invaded him. He
became obsessed with an idea that he had left fleas in his bed in Mr.
White's attic. That smug, immaculate Chinese servant would see them
when he made the bed, and on Mr. White's return would say, "That
foreign soldier left fleas in our attic bed." How bitterly did
Constantine wish that he had examined the bed carefully before
leaving the room, or alternatively, that he could invent some
elaborate lie that would prevent Mr. White from believing this
revolting accusation. Constantine's mind, already racked with the
fear of pain and death and with the agony of his impotence to impress
his companion, became overcast with the hopelessness and
remorselessness of everything. Everything despairing seemed a fact
beyond dispute; everything hopeful, a mere dream. His growing
certainty about the fleas, the persistence of the rain, combined with
the leakiness of the car's side-curtains, the skiddiness of the road,
the festering of his leg, the thought of the surgeon's saw, the
perfection of that complacent kit-bag in the back seat, with the poor
cigar-box balalaika tinkling beside it, the overstability and
overrightness of his friend in need--there was not one sweet or
flattering thought to which his poor trapped mind could turn.</p>

<p>The absurdly inadequate bullock-trail only just served the purpose
of a road for the Ford. The wheels slid about, wrenching themselves
from groove to groove. Constantine's comment on the difficulties of
the road was silenced by a polite request on the part of Mr. White.
"I can't talk while I'm driving, if you don't mind. I'm not a good
driver, and I need all my attention, especially on such a bad
road."</p>

<p>"I will talk and you need not answer. That is my ideal plan of
conversation. I will tell you why I joined the Foreign Legion. You
must have been wondering about this. It will be a relief for me from
my misfortunes, to talk."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not, if you don't mind," said his host serenely.</p>

<p>"Mean old horse," thought Constantine passionately, his heart
contracting with offence. "It is so English to give away nothing but
the bare, bald, stony fact of help--no decorations of graciousnesses
and smilings. A Russian would be a much poorer helper, but a how much
better friend."</p>

<p>The car ground on. Constantine turned over again and again in his
mind the matter of the fleas. The wet ochre-and-green country of
South China streamed unevenly past, the neat, complex shapes of rice
fields altering, disintegrating and re-forming, like groups in a
country dance. Abrupt horns of rock began piercing through the flat
rain-striped valley, and these, it seemed, were the heralds of a
mountain range that barred the path of the travellers, for soon
cliffs towered above the road. A village which clung to a slope at
the mouth of a gorge was occupied by soldiers. "This is where our
troubles begin," said Mr. White peacefully. The soldiers were
indolent, shabby, ineffectual-looking creatures, scarcely
distinguishable from coolies, but their machine-guns, straddling
mosquito-like about the forlorn village street, looked disagreeably
wideawake and keen. Constantine felt as if his precious heart were
the cynosure of all the machine-guns' waspish glances, as the car
splashed between them. "Is this safe?" he asked. "Motoring through a
Chinese war?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," smiled Mr. White. "But it's safer than
neglecting that leg of yours."</p>

<p>Constantine uttered a small, shrill, nervous exclamation--half a
curse, "Is a man nothing more than a leg to you?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, from one side of the gorge along which they were now
driving, a rifle shot cracked, like the breaking of a taut wire. Its
echoes were overtaken by the sputtering of more shots from a higher
crag. Constantine had been tensely held for just such an attack on
his courage as this--and yet he was not ready for it. His body moved
instantly by itself, without consulting his self-respect; it flung
its arms round Mr. White. The car, thus immobilized at its source of
energy, swerved, skidded, and stood still askew upon the trail.
Constantine, sweating violently, recalled his pride and reassembled
his sprawling arms. Mr. White said nothing, but he looked with a cold
benevolence into Constantine's face and shook his head slightly. Then
he started the car again and drove on in silence. There was no more
firing.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, I do wish you had been a little bit frightened too," said
Constantine, clenching his fists. He was too much of a desert
islander to deny his own fright, as a citizen of the tradition-ruled
mainland might have denied it. Brave or afraid, Constantine was his
own creation; he had made himself, he would stand or fall by this
self that he had made. It was indeed, in a way, more interesting to
have been afraid than to have been brave. Only, unfortunately, this
exasperating benefactor of his did not think so.</p>

<p>The noon-light was scarcely brighter than the light of early
morning. The unremitting rain slanted across the grey air. Trees,
skies, valleys mountains, seen through the rain-spotted windshield,
were like a distorted, stippled landscape painted by a beginner who
has not yet learned to wring living colour from his palette. However,
sun or no sun, noontime it was at last, and Mr. White, drawing his
car conscientiously to the side of the bullock-trail, as if a
procession of Rolls-Royces might be expected to pass, unpacked a neat
jigsaw puzzle of a sandwich-box.</p>

<p>"I brought a few caviare sandwiches for you," he said gently: "I
know Russians like caviare."</p>

<p>"Are your sandwiches then made of Old England's Rosbif?" asked
Constantine crossly, for it seemed to him that this man used nothing
but collective nouns.</p>

<p>"No; of bloater paste."</p>

<p>They said nothing more but munched in a rather sullen silence.</p>

<p>Constantine had lost his desire to tell Mr. White why he had
joined the Foreign Legion--or to tell him anything else, for that
matter. There was something about Mr. White that destroyed the
excitement of telling ingenious lies--or even the common truth; and
this something Constantine resented more and more, though he was
uncertain how to define it. Mr. White leaned over the steering-wheel
and covered his eyes with his hands, for driving tired him. The
caviare, and his host's evident weariness, irritated Constantine more
and more; these things seemed like a crude insistence on his
increasing obligation. "I suppose you are tired of the very sight of
me," he felt impelled to say bitterly.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. White politely but indifferently. "Don't worry
about me. It'll all be the same a hundred years hence."</p>

<p>"Whether my leg is off or on--whether I die in agony or live--it
will all be the same a hundred years hence, I suppose you would say,"
said Constantine, morbidly goading his companion into repeating this
insult to the priceless mystery of personality.</p>

<p>"My good man, I can't do more than I am doing about your leg, can
I?" said Mr. White irritably, as he restarted the car.</p>

<p>"A million times more--a million times more," thought Constantine
hysterically, but with an effort he said nothing.</p>

<p>As the wet evening light smouldered to an ashen twilight, they
drove into Mo-ming, which was to be their night's stopping-place.
Outside the city wall they were stopped by soldiers; for Mo-ming was
being defended against the enemy's advance. After twenty minutes'
talk in the clanking Cantonese tongue, the two white men were allowed
to go through the city gate on foot, leaving the Ford in a shed
outside, in the care of Mr. White's coolie. Mr. White carried his
beautiful little kit-bag and expected Constantine to carry the
camp-bed.</p>

<p>"What--and leave my balalaika in the car?" protested Constantine
childishly.</p>

<p>"I think it would be safe," said Mr. White, only faintly ironic.
"Hurry up. I must go at once and call on the general in charge here.
I don't want to have my car commandeered."</p>

<p>Constantine limped along behind him, the camp-bed on one shoulder,
the balalaika faintly tinkling under his arm. They found the inn in
the centre of a tangle of looped, frayed, untidy streets--a box-like
gaunt house, one corner of which was partly ruined, for the city had
been bombarded that day. The inn, which could never have been a
comfortable place, was wholly disorganized by its recent misfortune;
most of the servants had fled, and the innkeeper was--entirely
engrossed in counting and piling up on the verandah his rescued
possessions from the wrecked rooms. An impudent little boy, naked
down to the waist--the only remaining servant--showed Mr. White and
Constantine to the only room the inn could offer.</p>

<p>"One room between us?" cried Constantine, thinking of his
shameful, possibly verminous, clothes and his unwashed body. He felt
unable to bear the idea of unbuttoning even the greasy collar of his
tunic within sight of that virgin--new kit-bag. Its luminous
whiteness would seem in the night like triumphant civilization's eye
fixed upon the barbarian--like the smug beam of a lighthouse glowing
from the mainland upon that uncouth obstruction, a desert island.
"I'm not consistent," thought Constantine. "That's my trouble. I
ought to be proud of being dirty. At least that is a home-made
condition."</p>

<p>"Yes--one room between us," said Mr. White tardy. "We must do the
best we can. You look after things here, will you, while I go and see
the general and make the car-safe."</p>

<p>Left alone, Constantine decided not to take off any clothes at
all--even his coarse greatcoat--but to say that he had fever and
needed all the warmth he could get. No sooner had he come to this
decision than he felt convinced that he actually was feverish; his
head and his injured leg ached and throbbed as though all the hot
blood in his body had concentrated in those two regions, while ice
seemed to settle round his heart and loins. The room was dreary and
very sparsely furnished with an ugly, too high table and rigid chairs
to match. The beds were simply recesses in the wall, draped with
dirty mud-brown mosquito-veils. Constantine, however, stepped more
bravely into this hard, matted coffin than he had into Mr. White's
clean attic bed. As he lay down, his leg burned and throbbed more
fiercely than ever, and he began to imagine the amputation--the
blood, the yawning of the flesh, the scraping of the saw upon the
bone. His imagination did not supply an anaesthetic. Fever came upon
him now in good earnest; he shook so much that his body seemed to
jump like a fish upon the unyielding matting, he seemed to breathe in
heat, without being able to melt the ice in his bones. Yet he
remained artistically conscious all the time of his plight, and even
exaggerated the shivering spasms of his limbs. He was quite pleased
to think that Mr. White would presently return and find him in this
condition, and so be obliged to be interested and compassionate. Yet
as he heard Mr. White's heavy step on the stair, poor Constantine's
eye fell on the fastidious white kit-bag, and he suddenly remembered
all his fancies and fears about vermin and smells. By the time Mr.
White was actually standing over him, Constantine was convinced that
the deepest loathing was clearly shown on that superior, towering
face.</p>

<p>"I can't help it--I can't help it," cried Constantine, between his
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Mr. White seemed to ignore the Russian's agitation. "I think the
car'll be all right now," he said. "I left the coolie sleeping in it,
to make sure. The general was quite civil and gave me a permit to get
home; but it seems it's utterly impossible for us to drive on to
Lao-chow. Fighting on the road is particularly hot, and the bridges
are all destroyed. The enemy have reached the opposite side of the
river, and they've been bombarding the city all day. I told the
general about your case; he suggests you go by river in a sampan down
to Lao-chow to-morrow. You may be fired on just as you leave the
city, but nothing to matter, I dare say. After that, you'd be all
right--the river makes a stiff bend south here, and gets right away
from the country they're fighting over. It would take you only about
eighteen hours to Lao-chow, going down stream. I've already got a
sampan for you.... Oh, Lord, isn't this disgusting?" he added,
looking round the dreadful room and wrinkling his nose. "How I loathe
this kind of thing."</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I can't help it." Constantine began first to
moan and then to cry. He was by now in great pain, and he did not try
to control his distress. It passed through his mind that crying was
the last thing a stupid Englishman would expect of a
l&eacute;gionnaire; so far so good, therefore--he was a desert
islander even in his degradation. Yet he loathed himself; all his
morbid fears of being offensive were upon him, and the unaccustomed
exercise of crying, combined with the fever, nauseated him. Mr.
White, still wearing his expression of repugnance, came to his help,
loosened that greasy collar, lent a handkerchief, ordered some
refreshing hot Chinese tea.</p>

<p>"You should have known me in Odessa," gasped Constantine in an
interval between his paroxysms. "Three of the prettiest women in the
town were madly in love with me. You know me only at my worst."</p>

<p>Mr. White, soaking a folded silk handkerchief in cold water,
before laying it on Constantine's burning forehead, did not answer.
He unrolled the pillow from his camp-bed and put it under
Constantine's head. As he did so, he recoiled a little, but after a
second's hesitation, he pushed the immaculate little pillow into
place with a heroic firmness.</p>

<p>"I wore only silk next the skin then," snuffled Constantine. The
fever rose in a wave in his brain, and he shouted curses upon his
cruelly perfect friend.</p>

<p>Mr. White lay only intermittently on his camp-bed that night. He
was kept busy making use of his past experience as a member of an
ambulance unit. Only at daylight he slept for an hour or so.</p>

<p>Constantine, awakened from a short sleep by the sound of firing
outside, lay on his side and watched Mr. White's relaxed, sleeping
face. The fever had left Constantine, and he was now sunk in cold,
limp depression and fear. Luckily, he thought, there was no need to
stir, for certainly he could not be expected--a sick man--to set
forth in a sampan through such dangers as the persistent firing
suggested. At least in this inn he knew the worst, he thought
wearily, and his companion knew the worst too. "I will not leave
him," Constantine vowed, "until I have somehow cured him of these
frightful memories of me--somehow amputated his memory of me...." He
lay watching his companion's face--hating it--obscurely wishing that
those eyes, which had seen the worst during this loathsome night,
might remain for ever shut.</p>

<p>Mr. White woke up quite suddenly. "Good Lord!" he said, peering at
his watch. "Nearly seven. I told the sampan man to be at the foot of
the steps at daylight."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" asked Constantine shrilly. "Listen to the
firing--quite near. Besides--I'm a very sick man, as you should know
by now. I couldn't even walk--much less dodge through a crowd of
Chinese assassins."</p>

<p>Mr. White, faintly whistling Chopin, laboriously keeping his
temper, left the room, and could presently be heard hee-hawing in the
Chinese language on the verandah to the hee-hawing innkeeper.</p>

<p>When he came back, he said, "The sampaneer's there, waiting--only
too anxious to get away from the bombing they're expecting to-day.
He's tied up only about a hundred yards away. You'll be beyond the
reach of the firing as soon as you're round the bend. Hurry up, man;
the sooner you get down to hospital, and I get off on the road home,
the better for us both."</p>

<p>Constantine, genuinely exhausted after his miserable night, did
not speak, but lay with his eyes shut and his face obstinately turned
to the wall. He certainly felt too ill to be brave or to face the
crackling dangers of the battle-ridden streets, but he was conscious
of no plan except a determination to be as obstructive as he
could--to assert at least this ignoble power over his tyrant.</p>

<p>"Get up, you damn fool," shouted Mr. White, suddenly plucking the
pillow from under the sick man's head, "or I'll drag you down to the
river by the scruff of your dirty neck."</p>

<p>Dirty neck! Instantly Constantine sat up--hopeless now of curing
this man's contempt, full of an almost unendurable craving to be far
away from him--to wipe him from his horizon--to be allowed to imagine
him dead. Invigorated by this violent impulse, he rolled out of bed
and sullenly watched Mr. White settle up with the innkeeper and take
a few packages out of that revoltingly refined kit-bag.</p>

<p>"A small tin of water-biscuits," said Mr. White, almost
apologetically, "and the remains of the bloater paste. It's all I
have with me, but it ought to keep you alive till you get to Lao-chow
to-morrow morning.... I'll see you down to the river first and then
pick up these things." He spoke as if he were trying to make little
neat plans still against this disorderly and unwonted background. He
brushed his splashed coat with a silver clothes-brush, wearing the
eagerly safe expression Constantine had seen on his face as he bent
over the tie-press the night before last. The orderly man was trying
to maintain his quiet impersonal self-respect amid surroundings that
humiliated him. Even Constantine understood vaguely that his attacker
was himself being attacked. "Well, I've done my best," added Mr.
White, straightening his back after buckling the last strap of the
kit-bag, and looking at Constantine with an ambiguous, almost
appealing look.</p>

<p>They left the inn. The steep street that led down to the river
between mean, barricaded shops was deserted. The air of it was
outraged by the whipping sound of rifle fire--echoes clanked sharply
from wall to wall.</p>

<p>"It is not safe--it is not safe," muttered Constantine, suddenly
standing rooted, feeling that his next step must bring him into the
path of a bullet.</p>

<p>"It's safer than a gangrenous leg." With his great hand, Mr. White
seized the little Russian's arm and dragged him almost gaily down the
steps. Constantine was by now so hopelessly mired in humiliation that
he did not even try to disguise his terror. He hung back like a
rebellious child, but he was tweaked and twitched along, stumbling
behind his rescuer. He was pressed into the little boat. "Here, take
the biscuits--good-bye--good luck," shouted Mr. White, and a smile of
real gaiety broke out at last upon his face. The strip of rainy air
and water widened between the friends.</p>

<p>"Strike him dead, God!" said Constantine.</p>

<p>The smile did not fade at once from the Englishman's face, as his
legs curiously crumpled into a kneeling position. He seemed trying to
kneel on air; he clutched at his breast with one hand while the other
hand still waved good-bye; he turned his alert, smiling face towards
Constantine as though he were going to say again--"Good-bye--good
luck." Then he fell, head downward, on the steps, the bald crown of
his head just dipping into the water. Mud was splashed over the coat
he had brushed only five minutes before.</p>

<p>There was a loud outcry from the sampan man and his wife. They
seemed to be calling Constantine's already riveted attention to the
fallen man--still only twenty yards away; they seemed uncertain
whether he would now let them row yet more quickly away, as they
desired, or insist on returning to the help of his friend.</p>

<p>"Row on--row on," cried Constantine in Russian and, to show them
what he meant, he snatched up a spare pole and tried to increase the
speed of the boat as it swerved into the current. Spaces of water
were broadening all about the desert islander--home on his desert
island again at last. As Constantine swayed over the pole, he looked
back over his shoulder and flaunted his head, afraid no more of the
firing now that one blessed bullet had carried away unpardonable
memory out of the brain of his friend.</p>
