<p><b>The dead abide with us! Though stark and cold<br>
Earth seems to grip them, they are with us still.</b></p>

<p>Some years ago I took up architecture, and made a tour through
Holland, studying the buildings of that interesting country. I was
not then aware that it is not enough to take up art. Art must take
you up, too. I never doubted but that my passing enthusiasm for her
would be returned. When I discovered that she was a stern mistress,
who did not immediately respond to my attentions, I naturally
transferred them to another shrine. There are other things in the
world besides art. I am now a landscape gardener.</p>

<p>But at the time of which I write I was engaged in a violent
flirtation with architecture. I had one companion on this expedition,
who has since become one of the leading architects of the day. He was
a thin, determined-looking man with a screwed-up face and heavy jaw,
slow of speech, and absorbed in his work to a degree which I quickly
found tiresome. He was possessed of a certain quiet power of
overcoming obstacles which I have rarely seen equalled. He has since
become my brother-in-law, so I ought to know; for my parents did not
like him much and opposed the marriage, and my sister did not like
him at all, and refused him over and over again; but, nevertheless,
he eventually married her.</p>

<p>I have thought since that one of his reasons for choosing me as
his travelling companion on this occasion was because he was getting
up steam for what he subsequently termed 'an alliance with my
family', but the idea never entered my head at the time. A more
careless man as to dress I have rarely met, and yet, in all the heat
of July in Holland, I noticed that he never appeared without a high,
starched collar, which had not even fashion to commend it at that
time.</p>

<p>I often chaffed him about his splendid collars, and asked him why
he wore them, but without eliciting any response. One evening, as we
were walking back to our lodgings in Middeburg, I attacked him for
about the thirtieth time on the subject.</p>

<p>'Why on earth do you wear them?' I said.</p>

<p>'You have, I believe, asked me that question many times,' he
replied, in his slow, precise utterance; 'but always on occasions
when I was occupied. I am now at leisure, and I will tell you.'</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>I have put down what he said, as nearly in his own words as I can
remember them.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, I was asked to read a paper on English Frescoes at
the Institute of British Architects. I was determined to make the
paper as good as I could, down to the slightest details, and I
consulted many books on the subject, and studied every fresco I could
find. My father, who had been an architect, had left me, at his
death, all his papers and note-books on the subject of architecture.
I searched them diligently, and found in one of them a slight
unfinished sketch of nearly fifty years ago that specially interested
me. Underneath was noted, in his clear, small hand--Frescoed east
wall of crypt. Parish Church. Wet Waste-on-the-Wolds, Yorkshire (via
Pickering).</p>

<p>The sketch had such a fascination for me that I decided to go
there and see the fresco for myself. I had only a very vague idea as
to where Wet Waste-on-the-Wolds was, but I was ambitious for the
success of my paper; it was hot in London, and I set off on my long
journey not without a certain degree of pleasure, with my dog Brian,
a large nondescript brindled creature, as my only companion.</p>

<p>I reached Pickering, in Yorkshire, in the course of the afternoon,
and then began a series of experiments on local lines which ended,
after several hours, in my finding myself deposited at a little
out-of-the-world station within nine or ten miles of Wet Waste. As no
conveyance of any kind was to be had, I shouldered my portmanteau,
and set out on a long white road that stretched away into the
distance over the bare, treeless wold. I must have walked for several
hours, over a waste of moorland patched with heather, when a doctor
passed me, and gave me a lift to within a mile of my destination. The
mile was a long one, and it was quite dark by the time I saw the
feeble glimmer of lights in front of me, and found that I had reached
Wet Waste. I had considerable difficulty in getting any one to take
me in; but at last I persuaded the owner of the public-house to give
me a bed, and, quite tired out, I got into it as soon as possible,
for fear he should change his mind, and fell asleep to the sound of a
little stream below my window.</p>

<p>I was up early next morning, and inquired directly after breakfast
the way to the clergyman's house, which I found was close at hand. At
Wet Waste everything was close at hand. The whole village seemed
composed of a straggling row of one-storeyed grey stone houses, the
same colour as the stone walls that separated the few fields enclosed
from the surrounding waste, and as the little bridges over the beck
that ran down one side of the grey wide street. Everything was
grey.</p>

<p>The church, the low tower of which I could see at a little
distance, seemed to have been built of the same stone; so was the
parsonage when I came up to it, accompanied on my way by a mob of
rough, uncouth children, who eyed me and Brian with half-defiant
curiosity.</p>

<p>The clergyman was at home, and after a short delay I was admitted.
Leaving Brian in charge of my drawing materials, I followed the
servant into a low panelled room, in which, at a latticed window, a
very old man was sitting. The morning light fell on his white head
bent low over a litter of papers and books.</p>

<p>'Mr er--?' he said, looking up slowly, with one finger keeping his
place in a hook.</p>

<p>'Blake.'</p>

<p>'Blake,' he repeated after me, and was silent.</p>

<p>I told him that I was an architect; that I had come to study a
fresco in the crypt of his church, and asked for the keys.</p>

<p>'The crypt,' he said, pushing up his spectacles and peering hard
at me. 'The crypt has been closed for thirty years. Ever since--' and
he stopped short.</p>

<p>'I should be much obliged for the keys,' I said again.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'No,' he said. 'No one goes in there now.</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' I remarked, 'for I have come a long way with that
one object'; and I told him about the paper I had been asked to read,
and the trouble I was taking with it.</p>

<p>He became interested. 'Ah!' he said, laying down his pen, and
removing his finger from the page before him, 'I can understand that.
I also was young once, and fired with ambition. The lines have fallen
to me in somewhat lonely places, and for forty years I have held the
cure of souls in this place, where, truly, I have seen but little of
the world, though I myself may be not unknown in the paths of
literature. Possibly you may have read a pamphlet, written by myself,
on the Syrian version of the Three Authentic Epistles of
Ignatius?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said, 'I am ashamed to confess that I have not time to
read even the most celebrated books. My one object in life is my art.
Ars longa, vita brevis, you know.'</p>

<p>'You are right, my son,' said the old man, evidently disappointed,
but looking at me kindly.</p>

<p>'There are diversities of gifts, and if the Lord has entrusted you
with a talent, look to it. Lay it not up in a napkin.'</p>

<p>I said I would not do so if he would lend me the keys of the
crypt. He seemed startled by my recurrence to the subject and looked
undecided.</p>

<p>'Why not?' he murmured to himself. 'The youth appears a good
youth. And superstition! What is it but distrust in God!'</p>

<p>He got up slowly, and taking a large bunch of keys out of his
pocket, opened with one of them an oak cupboard in the corner of the
room.</p>

<p>'They should be here,' he muttered, peering in; 'but the dust of
many years deceives the eye.</p>

<p>See, my son, if among these parchments there be two keys; one of
iron and very large, and the other steel, and of a long thin
appearance.'</p>

<p>I went eagerly to help him, and presently found in a back drawer
two keys tied together, which he recognised at once.</p>

<p>'Those are they,' he said. 'The long one opens the first door at
the bottom of the steps which go down against the outside wall of the
church hard by the sword graven in the wall. The second opens (but it
is hard of opening and of shutting) the iron door within the passage
leading to the crypt itself. My son, is it necessary to your treatise
that you should enter this crypt?'</p>

<p>I replied that it was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>'Then take them,' he said, 'and in the evening you will bring them
to me again.'</p>

<p>I said I might want to go several days running, and asked if he
would not allow me to keep them till I had finished my work; but on
that point he was firm.</p>

<p>'Likewise,' he added, 'be careful that you lock the first door at
the foot of the steps before you unlock the second, and lock the
second also while you are within. Furthermore, when you come out lock
the iron inner door as well as the wooden one.'</p>

<p>I promised I would do so, and, after thanking him, hurried away,
delighted at my success in obtaining the keys. Finding Brian and my
sketching materials waiting for me in the porch, I eluded the
vigilance of my escort of children by taking the narrow private path
between the parsonage and the church which was close at hand,
standing in a quadrangle of ancient yews.</p>

<p>The church itself was interesting, and I noticed that it must have
arisen out of the ruins of a previous building, judging from the
number of fragments of stone caps and arches, bearing traces of very
early carving, now built into the walls. There were incised crosses,
too, in some places, and one especially caught my attention, being
flanked by a large sword. It was in trying to get a nearer look at
this that I stumbled, and, looking down, saw at my feet a flight of
narrow stone steps green with moss and mildew. Evidently this was the
entrance to the crypt. I at once descended the steps, taking care of
my footing, for they were damp and slippery in the extreme.</p>

<p>Brian accompanied me, as nothing would induce him to remain
behind. By the time I had reached the bottom of the stairs, I found
myself almost in darkness, and I had to strike a light before I could
find the keyhole and the proper key to fit into it. The door, which
was of wood, opened inwards fairly easily, although an accumulation
of mould and rubbish on the ground outside showed it had not been
used for many years. Having got through it, which was not altogether
an easy matter, as nothing would induce it to open more than about
eighteen inches, I carefully locked it behind me, although I should
have preferred to leave it open, as there is to some minds an
unpleasant feeling in being locked in anywhere, in case of a sudden
exit seeming advisable.</p>

<p>I kept my candle alight with some difficulty, and after groping my
way down a low and of course exceedingly dank passage, came to
another door. A toad was squatting against it, who looked as if he
had been sitting there about a hundred years. As I lowered the candle
to the floor, he gazed at the light with unblinking eyes, and then
retreated slowly into a crevice in the wall, leaving against the door
a small cavity in the dry mud which had gradually silted up round his
person. I noticed that this door was of iron, and had a long bolt,
which, however, was broken.</p>

<p>Without delay, I fitted the second key into the lock, and pushing
the door open after considerable difficulty, I felt the cold breath
of the crypt upon my face. I must own I experienced a momentary
regret at locking the second door again as soon as I was well inside,
but I felt it my duty to do so. Then, leaving the key in the lock, I
seized my candle and looked round. I was standing in a low vaulted
chamber with groined roof, cut out of the solid rock. It was
difficult to see where the crypt ended, as further light thrown on
any point only showed other rough archways or openings, cut in the
rock, which had probably served at one time for family vaults.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the Wet Waste crypt, which I had not noticed in
other places of that description, was the tasteful arrangement of
skulls and bones which were packed about four feet high on either
side. The skulls were symmetrically built up to within a few inches
of the top of the low archway on my left, and the shin bones were
arranged in the same manner on my right. But the fresco! I looked
round for it in vain. Perceiving at the further end of the crypt a
very low and very massive archway, the entrance to which was not
filled up with bones, I passed under it, and found myself in a second
smaller chamber. Holding my candle above my head, the first object
its light fell upon was--the fresco, and at a glance I saw that it
was unique. Setting down some of my things with a trembling hand on a
rough stone shelf hard by, which had evidently been a credence table,
I examined the work more closely. It was a reredos over what had
probably been the altar at the time the priests were proscribed. The
fresco belonged to the earliest part of the fifteenth century, and
was so perfectly preserved that I could almost trace the limits of
each day's work in the plaster, as the artist had dashed it on and
smoothed it out with his trowel. The subject was the Ascension,
gloriously treated. I can hardly describe my elation as I stood and
looked at it, and reflected that this magnificent specimen of English
fresco painting would be made known to the world by myself.
Recollecting myself at last, I opened my sketching bag, and, lighting
all the candles I had brought with me, set to work.</p>

<p>Brian walked about near me, and though I was not otherwise than
glad of his company in my rather lonely position, I wished several
times I had left him behind. He seemed restless, and even the sight
of so many bones appeared to exercise no soothing effect upon him. At
last, however, after repeated commands, he lay down, watchful but
motionless, on the stone floor.</p>

<p>I must have worked for several hours, and I was pausing to rest my
eyes and hands, when I noticed for the first time the intense
stillness that surrounded me. No sound from me reached the outer
world. The church clock which had clanged out so loud and ponderously
as I went down the steps, had not since sent the faintest whisper of
its iron tongue down to me below. All was silent as the grave. This
was the grave. Those who had come here had indeed gone down into
silence. I repeated the words to myself, or rather they repeated
themselves to me.</p>

<p>Gone down into silence.</p>

<p>I was awakened from my reverie by a faint sound. I sat still and
listened. Bats occasionally frequent vaults and underground
places.</p>

<p>The sound continued, a faint, stealthy, rather unpleasant sound. I
do not know what kinds of sounds bats make, whether pleasant or
otherwise. Suddenly there was a noise as of something falling, a
momentary pause--and then--an almost imperceptible but distant jangle
as of a key.</p>

<p>I had left the key in the lock after I had turned it, and I now
regretted having done so. I got up, took one of the candles, and went
back into the larger crypt--for though I trust I am not so effeminate
as to be rendered nervous by hearing a noise for which I cannot
instantly account; still, on occasions of this kind, I must honestly
say I should prefer that they did not occur. As I came towards the
iron door, there was another distinct (I had almost said hurried)
sound. The impression on my mind was one of great haste. When I
reached the door, and held the candle near the lock to take out the
key, I perceived that the other one, which hung by a short string to
its fellow, was vibrating slightly. I should have preferred not to
find it vibrating, as there seemed no occasion for such a course; but
I put them both into my pocket, and turned to go back to my work. As
I turned, I saw on the ground what had occasioned the louder noise I
had heard, namely, a skull which had evidently just slipped from its
place on the top of one of the walls of bones, and had rolled almost
to my feet. There, disclosing a few more inches of the top of an
archway behind, was the place from which it had been dislodged. I
stooped to pick it up, but fearing to displace any more skulls by
meddling with the pile, and not liking to gather up its scattered
teeth, I let it lie, and went back to my work, in which I was soon so
completely absorbed that I was only roused at last by my candles
beginning to burn low and go out one after another.</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh of regret, for I had not nearly finished, I
turned to go. Poor Brian, who had never quite reconciled himself to
the place, was beside himself with delight. As I opened the iron door
he pushed past me, and a moment later I heard him whining and
scratching, and I had almost added, beating, against the wooden one.
I locked the iron door, and hurried down the passage as quickly as I
could, and almost before I had got the other one ajar there seemed to
be a rush past me into the open air, and Brian was bounding up the
steps and out of sight. As I stopped to take out the key, I felt
quite deserted and left behind. When I came out once more into the
sunlight, there was a vague sensation all about me in the air of
exultant freedom.</p>

<p>It was already late in the afternoon, and after I had sauntered
back to the parsonage to give up the keys, I persuaded the people of
the public-house to let me join in the family meal, which was spread
out in the kitchen. The inhabitants of Wet Waste were primitive
people, with the frank, unabashed manner that flourishes still in
lonely places, especially in the wilds of Yorkshire; but I had no
idea that in these days of penny posts and cheap newspapers such
entire ignorance of the outer world could have existed in any corner,
however remote, of Great Britain.</p>

<p>When I took one of the neighbour's children on my knee--a pretty
little girl with the palest aureole of flaxen hair I had ever
seen--and began to draw pictures for her of the birds and beasts of
other countries, I was instantly surrounded by a crowd of children,
and even grown-up people, while others came to their doorways and
looked on from a distance, calling to each other in the strident
unknown tongue which I have since discovered goes by the name of
'Broad Yorkshire'.</p>

<p>The following morning, as I came out of my room, I perceived that
something was amiss in the village. A buzz of voices reached me as I
passed the bar, and in the next house I could hear through the open
window a high-pitched wail of lamentation.</p>

<p>The woman who brought me my breakfast was in tears, and in answer
to my questions, told me that the neighbour's child, the little girl
whom I had taken on my knee the evening before, had died in the
night.</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the general grief that the little creature's
death seemed to arouse, and the uncontrolled wailing of the poor
mother took my appetite away.</p>

<p>I hurried off early to my work, calling on my way for the keys,
and with Brian for my companion descended once more into the crypt,
and drew and measured with an absorption that gave me no time that
day to listen for sounds real or fancied. Brian, too, on this
occasion seemed quite content, and slept peacefully beside me on the
stone floor. When I had worked as long as I could, I put away my
books with regret that even then I had not quite finished, as I had
hoped to do. It would be necessary to come again for a short time on
the morrow. When I returned the keys late that afternoon, the old
clergyman met me at the door, and asked me to come in and have tea
with him.</p>

<p>'And has the work prospered?' he asked, as we sat down in the
long, low room, into which I had just been ushered, and where he
seemed to live entirely.</p>

<p>I told him it had, and showed it to him.</p>

<p>'You have seen the original, of course?' I said.</p>

<p>'Once,' he replied, gazing fixedly at it. He evidently did not
care to be communicative, so I turned the conversation to the age of
the church.</p>

<p>'All here is old,' he said. 'When I was young, forty years ago,
and came here because I had no means of mine own, and was much moved
to marry at that time, I felt oppressed that all was so old; and that
this place was so far removed from the world, for which I had at
times longings grievous to be borne; but I had chosen my lot, and
with it I was forced to be content. My son, marry not in youth, for
love, which truly in that season is a mighty power, turns away the
heart from study, and young children break the back of ambition.
Neither marry in middle life, when a woman is seen to be but a woman
and her talk a weariness, so you will not be burdened with a wife in
your old age.</p>

<p>I had my own views on the subject of marriage, for I am of opinion
that a well-chosen companion of domestic tastes and docile and
devoted temperament may be of material assistance to a professional
man. But, my opinions once formulated, it is not of moment to me to
discuss them with others, so I changed the subject, and asked if the
neighbouring villages were as antiquated as Wet Waste 'Yes, all about
here is old,' he repeated. 'The paved road leading to Dyke Fens is an
ancient pack road, made even in the time of the Romans. Dyke Fens,
which is very near here, a matter of but four or five miles, is
likewise old, and forgotten by the world. The Reformation never
reached it. It stopped here. And at Dyke Fens they still have a
priest and a bell, and bow down before the saints. It is a damnable
heresy, and weekly I expound it as such to my people, showing them
true doctrines; and I have heard that this same priest has so far
yielded himself to the Evil One that he has preached against me as
withholding gospel truths from my flock; but I take no heed of it,
neither of his pamphlet touching the Clementine Homilies, in which he
vainly contradicts that which I have plainly set forth and proven
beyond doubt, concerning the word Asaph.'</p>

<p>The old man was fairly off on his favourite subject, and it was
some time before I could get away. As it was, he followed me to the
door, and I only escaped because the old clerk hobbled up at that
moment, and claimed his attention.</p>

<p>The following morning I went for the keys for the third and last
time. I had decided to leave early the next day. I was tired of Wet
Waste, and a certain gloom seemed to my fancy to be gathering over
the place. There was a sensation of trouble in the air, as if,
although the day was bright and clear, a storm were coming.</p>

<p>This morning, to my astonishment, the keys were refused to me when
I asked for them. I did not, however, take the refusal as, final--I
make it a rule never to take a refusal as final--and after a short
delay I was shown into the room where, as usual, the clergyman was
sitting, or rather, on this occasion, was walking up and down.</p>

<p>'My son,' he said with vehemence, 'I know wherefore you have come,
but it is of no avail. I cannot lend the keys again.'</p>

<p>I replied that, on the contrary, I hoped he would give them to me
at once.</p>

<p>'It is impossible,' he repeated. 'I did wrong, exceeding wrong. I
will never part with them again.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then said slowly:</p>

<p>'The old clerk, Abraham Kelly, died last night.' He paused, and
then went on: 'The doctor has just been here to tell me of that which
is a mystery to him. I do not wish the people of the place to know
it, and only to me he has mentioned it, but he has discovered plainly
on the throat of the old man, and also, but more faintly on the
child's, marks as of strangulation. None but he has observed it, and
he is at a loss how to account for it. I, alas! can account for it
but in one way, but in one way!'</p>

<p>I did not see what all this had to do with the crypt, but to
humour the old man, I asked what that way was.</p>

<p>'It is a long story, and, haply, to a stranger it may appear but
foolishness, but I will even tell it; for I perceive that unless I
furnish a reason for withholding the keys, you will not cease to
entreat mc for them.</p>

<p>'I told you at first when you inquired of me concerning the crypt,
that it had been closed these thirty years, and so it was. Thirty
years ago a certain Sir Roger Despard departed this life, even the
Lord of the manor of Wet Waste and Dyke Fens, the last of his family,
which is now, thank the Lord, extinct. He was a man of a vile life,
neither fearing God nor regarding man, nor having compassion on
innocence, and the Lord appeared to have given him over to the
tormentors even in this world, for he suffered many things of his
vices, more especially from drunkenness, in which seasons, and they
were many, he was as one possessed by seven devils, being an
abomination to his household and a root of bitterness to all, both
high and low.</p>

<p>'And, at last, the cup of his iniquity being full to the brim, he
came to die, and I went to exhort him on his death-bed; for I heard
that terror had come upon him, and that evil imaginations encompassed
him so thick on every side, that few of them that were with him could
abide in his presence. But when I saw him I perceived that there was
no place of repentance left for him, and he scoffed at me and my
superstition, even as he lay dying, and swore there was no God and no
angel, and all were damned even as he was. And the next day, towards
evening, the pains of death came upon him, and he raved the more
exceedingly, inasmuch as he said he was being strangled by the Evil
One. Now on his table was his hunting knife, and with his last
strength he crept and laid hold upon it, no man withstanding him, and
swore a great oath that if he went down to burn in hell, he would
leave one of his hands behind on earth, and that it would never rest
until it had drawn blood from the throat of another and strangled
him, even as he himself was being strangled. And he cut off his own
right hand at the wrist, and no man dared go near him to stop him,
and the blood went through the floor, even down to the ceiling of the
room below, and thereupon he died.</p>

<p>'And they called me in the night, and told me of his oath, and I
for I thought it better he should take it with him, so that he might
have it, I counselled that no man should speak of it, and I took the
dead hand, which none had ventured to touch, and I laid it beside him
in his coffin; if haply some day after much tribulation he should
perchance be moved to stretch forth his hands towards God. But the
story got spread about, and the people were affrighted, so, when he
came to be buried in the place of his fathers, he being the last of
his family, and the crypt likewise full, I had it closed, and kept
the keys myself, and suffered no man to enter therein any more; for
truly he was a man of an evil life, and the devil is not yet wholly
overcome, nor cast chained into the lake of fire. So in time the
story died out, for in thirty years much is forgotten. And when you
came and asked me for the keys, I was at the first minded to withhold
them; but I thought it was a vain superstition, and I perceived that
you do but ask a second time for what is first refused; so I let you
have them, seeing it was not an idle curiosity, but a desire to
improve the talent committed to you, that led you to require
them.'</p>

<p>The old man stopped, and I remained silent, wondering what would
be the best way to get them just once more.</p>

<p>'Surely, sir,' I said at last, 'one so cultivated and deeply read
as yourself cannot be biased by an idle superstition.'</p>

<p>'I trust not,' he replied, 'and yet--it is a strange thing that
since the crypt was opened two people have died, and the mark is
plain upon the throat of the old man and visible on the young child.
No blood was drawn, but the second time the grip was stronger than
the first. The third time, perchance--'</p>

<p>'Superstition such as that,' I said with authority, 'is an entire
want of faith in God. You once said so yourself.'</p>

<p>I took a high moral tone which is often efficacious with
conscientious, humble-minded people.</p>

<p>He agreed, and accused himself of not having faith as a grain of
mustard seed; but even when I had got him so far as that, I had a
severe struggle for the keys. It was only when I finally explained to
him that if any malign influence had been let loose the first day, at
any rate, it was out now for good or evil, and no further going or
coming of mine could make any difference, that I finally gained my
point. I was young, and he was old; and, being much shaken by what
had occurred, he gave way at last, and I wrested the keys from
him.</p>

<p>I will not deny that I went down the steps that day with a vague,
indefinable repugnance, which was only accentuated by the closing of
the two doors behind me. I remembered then, for the first time, the
faint jangling of the key and other sounds which I had noticed the
first day, and how one of the skulls had fallen. I went to the place
where it still lay. I have already said these walls of skulls were
built up so high as to be within a few inches of the top of the low
archways that led into more distant portions of the vault. The
displacement of the skull in question had left a small hole just
large enough for me to put my hand through. I noticed for the first
time, over the archway above it, a carved coat-of-arms, and the name,
now almost obliterated, of Despard. This, no doubt, was the Despard
vault. I could not resist moving a few more skulls and looking in,
holding my candle as near the aperture as I could. The vault was
full. Piled high, one upon another, were old coffins, and remnants of
coffins, and strewn bones. I attribute my present determination to be
cremated to the painful impression produced on me by this spectacle.
The coffin nearest the archway alone was intact, save for a large
crack across the lid. I could not get a ray from my candle to fall on
the brass plates, but I felt no doubt this was the coffin of the
wicked Sir Roger. I put back the skulls, including the one which had
rolled down, and carefully finished my work. I was not there much
more than an hour, but I was glad to get away.</p>

<p>If I could have left Wet Waste at once I should have done so, for
I had a totally unreasonable longing to leave the place; but I found
that only one train stopped during the day at the station from which
I had come, and that it would not be possible to be in time for it
that day.</p>

<p>Accordingly I submitted to the inevitable, and wandered about with
Brian for the remainder of the afternoon and until late in the
evening, sketching and smoking. The day was oppressively hot, and
even after the sun had set across the burnt stretches of the wolds,
it seemed to grow very little cooler. Not a breath stirred. In the
evening, when I was tired of loitering in the lanes, I went up to my
own room, and after contemplating afresh my finished study of the
fresco, I suddenly set to work to write the part of my paper bearing
upon it. As a rule, I write with difficulty, but that evening words
came to me with winged speed, and with them a hovering impression
that I must make haste, that I was much pressed for time. I wrote and
wrote, until my candles guttered out and left me trying to finish by
the moonlight, which, until I endeavoured to write by it, seemed as
clear as day.</p>

<p>I had to put away my MS., and, feeling it was too early to go to
bed, for the church clock was just counting out ten, I sat down by
the open window and leaned out to try and catch a breath of air. It
was a night of exceptional beauty; and as I looked out my nervous
haste and hurry of mind were allayed. The moon, a perfect circle,
was--if so poetic an expression be permissible--as it were, sailing
across a calm sky. Every detail of the little village was as clearly
illuminated by its beams as if it were broad day; so, also, was the
adjacent church with its primeval yews, while even the wolds beyond
were dimly indicated, as if through tracing paper.</p>

<p>I sat a long time leaning against the window-sill. The heat was
still intense. I am not, as a rule, easily elated or readily cast
down; but as I sat that light in the lonely village on the moors,
with Brian's head against my knee, how, or why, I know not, a great
depression gradually came upon me.</p>

<p>My mind went back to the crypt and the countless dead who had been
laid there. The sight of the goal to which all human life, and
strength, and beauty, travel in the end, had not affected me at the
time, but now the very air about me seemed heavy with death.</p>

<p>What was the good, I asked myself, of working and toiling, and
grinding down my heart and youth in the mill of long and strenuous
effort, seeing that in the grave folly and talent, idleness and
labour lie together, and are alike forgotten? Labour seemed to
stretch before me till my heart ached to think of it, to stretch
before me even to the end of life, and then came, as the recompense
of my labour--the grave. Even if I succeeded, if, after wearing my
life threadbare with toil, I succeeded, what remained to me in the
end? The grave. A little sooner, while the hands and eyes were still
strong to labour, or a little later, when all power and vision had
been taken from them; sooner or later only--the grave.</p>

<p>I do not apologise for the excessively morbid tenor of these
reflections, as I hold that they were caused by the lunar effects
which I have endeavoured to transcribe. The moon in its various
quarterings has always exerted a marked influence on what I may call
the sub-dominant, namely, the poetic side of my nature.</p>

<p>I roused myself at last, when the moon came to look ill upon me
where I sat, and, leaving the window open, I pulled myself together
and went to bed.</p>

<p>I fell asleep almost immediately, but I do not fancy I could have
been asleep very long when I was wakened by Brian. He was growling in
a low, muffled tone, as he sometimes did in his sleep, when his nose
was buried in his rug. I called out to him to shut up; and as he did
not do so, turned in bed to find my match box or something to throw
at him. The moonlight was still in the room, and as I looked at him I
saw him raise his head and evidently wake up. I admonished him, and
was just on the point of falling asleep when he began to growl again
in a low, savage manner that waked me most effectually. Presently he
shook himself and got up, and began prowling about the room. I sat up
in bed and called to him, but he paid no attention. Suddenly I saw
him stop short in the moonlight; he showed his teeth, and crouched
down, his eyes following something in the air. I looked at him in
horror. Was he going mad? His eyes were glaring, and his head moved
slightly as if he were following the rapid movements of an enemy.
Then, with a furious snarl, he suddenly sprang from the ground, and
rushed in great leaps across the room towards me, dashing himself
against the furniture, his eyes rolling, snatching and tearing wildly
in the air with his teeth. I saw he had gone mad. I leaped out of
bed, and rushing at him, caught him by the throat. The moon had gone
behind a cloud; but in the darkness I felt him turn upon me, felt him
rise up, and his teeth close in my throat. I was being strangled.
With all the strength of despair, I kept my grip of his neck, and,
dragging him across the room, tried to crush in his head against the
iron rail of my bedstead. It was my only chance. I felt the blood
running down my neck. I was suffocating. After one moment of
frightful struggle, I beat his head against the bar and heard his
skull give way. I felt him give one strong shudder, a groan, and then
I fainted away.</p>

<p>When I came to myself I was lying on the floor, surrounded by the
people of the house, my reddened hands still clutching Brian's
throat. Someone was holding a candle towards me, and the draught from
the window made it flare and waver. I looked at Brian. He was stone
dead. The blood from his battered head was trickling slowly over my
hands. His great jaw was fixed in something that--in the uncertain
light--I could not see.</p>

<p>They turned the light a little.</p>

<p>'Oh, God!' I shrieked. 'There! Look! Look!'</p>

<p>'He's off his head,' said some one, and I fainted again.</p>

<p>I was ill for about a fortnight without regaining consciousness, a
waste of time of which even now I cannot think without poignant
regret. When I did recover consciousness, I found I was being
carefully nursed by the old clergyman and the people of the house. I
have often heard the unkindness of the world in general inveighed
against, but for my part I can honestly say that I have received many
more kindnesses than I have time to repay. Country people especially
are remarkably attentive to strangers in illness.</p>

<p>I could not rest until I had seen the doctor who attended me, and
had received his assurance that I should be equal to reading my paper
on the appointed day. This pressing anxiety removed, I told him of
what I had seen before I fainted the second time. He listened
attentively, and then assured me, in a manner that was intended to be
soothing, that I was suffering from an hallucination, due, no doubt,
to the shock of my dog's sudden madness.</p>

<p>'Did you see the dog after it was dead?' I asked.</p>

<p>He said he did. The whole jaw was covered with blood and foam; the
teeth certainly seemed convulsively fixed, but the case being
evidently one of extraordinarily virulent hydrophobia, owing to the
intense heat, he had had the body buried immediately.</p>

<p>My companion stopped speaking as we reached our lodgings, and went
upstairs. Then, lighting a candle, he slowly turned down his
collar.</p>

<p>'You see I have the marks still,' he said, 'but I have no fear of
dying of hydrophobia. I am told such peculiar scars could not have
been made by the teeth of a dog. If you look closely you see the
pressure of the five fingers. That is the reason why I wear high
collars.'</p>
