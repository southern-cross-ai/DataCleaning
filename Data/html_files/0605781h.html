<h2><a name="c1"></a>The Haunted Jarvee</h2>

<p>'Seen anything of Carnacki lately?' I asked Arkright when we met
in the City.</p>

<p>'No,' he replied. 'He's probably off on one of his jaunts. We'll
be having a card one of these days inviting us to No. 472, Cheyne
Walk, and then we'll hear all about it. Queer chap that.'</p>

<p>He nodded, and went on his way. It was some months now since we
four--Jessop, Arkright, Taylor and myself--had received the usual
summons to drop in at No. 472 and hear Carnacki's story of his latest
case. What talks they were! Stories of all kinds and true in every
word, yet full of weird and extraordinary incidents that held one
silent and awed until he had finished.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the following morning brought me a curtly worded
card telling me to be at No. 472 at seven o'clock promptly. I was the
first to arrive, Jessop and Taylor soon followed and just before
dinner was announced Arkright came in.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Carnacki as usual passed round his smokes, snuggled
himself down luxuriously in his favourite armchair and went straight
to the story we knew he had invited us to hear.</p>

<p>'I've been on a trip in one of the real old-time sailing ships,'
he said without any preliminary remarks. 'The Jarvee, owned by my old
friend Captain Thompson. I went on the voyage primarily for my
health, but I picked on the old Jarvee because Captain Thompson had
often told me there was something queer about her. I used to ask him
up here whenever he came ashore and try to get him to tell me more
about it, you know; but the funny thing was he never could tell me
anything definite concerning her queerness. He seemed always to know
but when it came to putting his knowledge into words it was as if he
found that the reality melted out of it. He would end up usually by
saying that you saw things and then he would wave his hands vaguely,
but further than that he never seemed able to pass on the knowledge
of something strange which he had noticed about the ship, except odd
outside details.</p>

<p>'"Can't keep men in her no-how," he often told me. "They get
frightened and they see things and they feel things. An' I've lost a
power o' men out of her. Fallen from aloft, you know. She's getting a
bad name." And then he'd shake his head very solemnly.</p>

<p>'Old Thompson was a brick in every way. When I got aboard I found
that he had given me the use of a whole empty cabin opening off my
own as my laboratory and workshop. He gave the carpenter orders to
fit up the empty cabin with shelves and other conveniences according
to my directions and in a couple of days I had all the apparatus,
both mechanical and electric with which I had conducted my other
ghost-hunts, neatly and safely stowed away, for I took a great deal
of gear with me as I intended to interest myself by examining
thoroughly into the mystery about which the captain was at once so
positive and so vague.</p>

<p>'During the first fortnight out I followed my usual methods of
making a thorough and exhaustive search. This I did with the most
scrupulous care, but found nothing abnormal of any kind in the whole
vessel. She was an old wooden ship and I took care to sound and
measure every casement and bulkhead, to examine every exit from the
holds and to seal all the hatches. These and many other precautions I
took, but at the end of the fortnight I had neither seen anything nor
found anything.</p>

<p>'The old barque was just, to all seeming, a healthy, average
old-timer jogging along comfortably from one port to another. And
save for an indefinable sense of what I could now describe as
"abnormal peace" about the ship I could find nothing to justify the
old captain's solemn and frequent assurances that I would see soon
enough for myself. This he would say often as we walked the poop
together; afterwards stopping to take a long, expectant, half-fearful
look at the immensity of the sea around.</p>

<p>'Then on the eighteenth day something truly happened. I had been
pacing the poop as usual with old Thompson when suddenly he stopped
and looked up at the mizzen royal which had just begun to flap
against the mast. He glanced at the wind-vane near him, then ruffled
his hat back and stared at the sea.</p>

<p>'"Wind's droppin', mister. There'll be trouble tonight," he said.
"D'you see yon?" And he pointed away to windward.</p>

<p>'"What?" I asked, staring with a curious little thrill that was
due to more than curiosity. "Where?"</p>

<p>'"Right off the beam," he said. "Comin' from under the sun."</p>

<p>'"I don't see anything," I explained after a long stare at the
wide-spreading silence of the sea that was already glassing into a
dead calm surface now that the wind had died.</p>

<p>'"Yon shadow fixin'," said the old man, reaching for his
glasses.</p>

<p>'He focussed them and took a long look, then passed them across to
me and pointed with his finger. "Just under the sun," he repeated.
"Comin' towards us at the rate o' knots." He was curiously calm and
matter-of-fact and yet I felt that a certain excitement had him in
the throat; so that I took the glasses eagerly and stared according
to his directions.</p>

<p>'After a minute I saw it--a vague shadow upon the still surface of
the sea that seemed to move towards us as I stared. For a moment I
gazed fascinated, yet ready every moment to swear that I saw nothing
and in the same instant to be assured that there was truly something
out there upon the water, apparently coming towards the ship.</p>

<p>'"It's only a shadow, captain," I said at length.</p>

<p>'"Just so, mister," he replied simply. "Have a look over the stern
to the norrard." He spoke in the quietest way, as a man speaks who is
sure of all his facts and who is facing an experience he has faced
before, yet who salts his natural matter-of-factness with a deep and
constant excitement.</p>

<p>'At the captain's hint I turned about and directed the glasses to
the northward. For a while I searched, sweeping my aided vision to
and fro over the greying arc of the sea.</p>

<p>'Then I saw the thing plain in the field of the glass--a vague
something, a shadow upon the water and the shadow seemed to be moving
towards the ship.</p>

<p>'"That's queer," I muttered with a funny little stirring at the
back of my throat.</p>

<p>'"Now to the west'ard, mister," said the captain, still speaking
in his peculiar level way.</p>

<p>'I looked to the westward and in a minute I picked up the thing--a
third shadow that seemed to move across the sea as I watched it.</p>

<p>'"My God, captain," I exclaimed, "what does it mean?"</p>

<p>'"That's just what I want to know, mister," said the captain.
"I've seen 'em before and thought sometimes I must be going mad.
Sometimes they're plain an' sometimes they're scarce to be seen, an'
sometimes they're like livin' things, an' sometimes they're like
nought at all but silly fancies. D' you wonder I couldn't name 'em
proper to you?"</p>

<p>'I did not answer for I was staring now expectantly towards the
south along the length of the barque. Afar off on the horizon my
glasses picked up something dark and vague upon the surface of the
sea, a shadow it seemed which grew plainer.</p>

<p>'"My God! " I muttered again. "This is real. This--" I turned
again to the eastward.</p>

<p>'"Comin' in from the four points, ain't they," said Captain
Thompson and he blew his whistle.</p>

<p>'"Take them three r'yals off her," he told the mate, "an' tell one
of the boys to shove lanterns up on the sherpoles. Get the men down
smart before dark," he concluded as the mate moved off to see the
orders carried out.</p>

<p>'"I'm sendin' no men aloft to-night," he said to me. "I've lost
enough that way."</p>

<p>'"They may be only shadows, captain, after all," I said, still
looking earnestly at that far-off grey vagueness on the eastward sea.
"Bit of mist or cloud floating low." Yet though I said this I had no
belief that it was so. And as for old Captain Thompson, he never took
the trouble to answer, but reached for his glasses which I passed to
him.</p>

<p>'"Gettin' thin an' disappearin' as they come near," he said
presently. "I know, I've seen 'em do that oft an' plenty before.
They'll be close round the ship soon but you nor me won't see them,
nor no one else, but they'll be there. I wish 'twas mornin'. I do
that!"</p>

<p>'He had handed the glasses back to me and I had been staring at
each of the oncoming shadows in turn. It was as Captain Thompson had
said. As they drew nearer they seemed to spread and thin out and
presently to become dissipated into the grey of the gloaming so that
I could easily have imagined that I watched merely four little
portions of grey cloud, expanding naturally into impalpableness and
invisibility.</p>

<p>'"Wish I'd took them t'gallants off her while I was about it,"
remarked the old man presently. "Can't think to send no one off the
decks to-night, not unless there's real need." He slipped away from
me and peered at the aneroid in the skylight. "Glass steady, anyhow,"
he muttered as he came away, seeming more satisfied.</p>

<p>'By this time the men had all returned to the decks and the night
was down upon us so that I could watch the queer, dissolving shadows
which approached the ship.</p>

<p>'Yet as I walked the poop with old Captain Thompson, you can
imagine how I grew to feel. Often I found myself looking over my
shoulder with quick, jerky glances; for it seemed to me that in the
curtains of gloom that hung just beyond the rails there must be a
vague, incredible thing looking inboard.</p>

<p>'I questioned the captain in a thousand ways, but could get little
out of him beyond what I knew. It was as if he had no power to convey
to another the knowledge which he possessed and I could ask no one
else, for every other man in the ship was newly signed on, including
the mates, which was in itself a significant fact.</p>

<p>'"You'll see for yourself, mister," was the refrain with which the
captain parried my questions, so that it began to seem as if he
almost feared to put anything he knew into words. Yet once, when I
had jerked round with a nervous feeling that something was at my back
he said calmly enough: "Naught to fear, mister, whilst you're in the
light and on the decks." His attitude was extraordinary in the way in
which he accepted the situation. He appeared to have no personal
fear.</p>

<p>'The night passed quietly until about eleven o'clock when suddenly
and without one atom of warning a furious squall burst on the vessel.
There was something monstrous and abnormal in the wind; it was as if
some power were using the elements to an infernal purpose. Yet the
captain met the situation calmly. The helm was put down and the sails
shaken while the three t'gallants were lowered. Then the three upper
topsails. Yet still the breeze roared over us, almost drowning the
thunder which the sails were making in the night.</p>

<p>'"Split 'em to ribbons!" the captain yelled in my ear above the
noise of the wind. "Can't help it. I ain't sendin' no men aloft
to-night unless she seems like to shake the sticks out of her. That's
what bothers me."</p>

<p>'For nearly an hour after that, until eight bells went at
midnight, the wind showed no signs of easing but breezed up harder
than ever. And all the while the skipper and I walked the poop, he
ever and again peering up anxiously through the darkness at the
banging and thrashing sails.</p>

<p>'For my part I could do nothing except stare round and round at
the extraordinarily dark night in which the ship seemed to be
embedded solidly. The very feel and sound of the wind gave me a sort
of constant horror, for there seemed to be an unnaturalness rampant
in the atmosphere. But how much this was the effect of my over-strung
nerves and excited imagination, I cannot say. Certainly, in all my
experience I had never come across anything just like what I felt and
endured through that peculiar squall.</p>

<p>'At eight bells when the other watch came on deck the captain was
forced to send all hands aloft to make the canvas fast, as he had
begun to fear that he would actually lose his masts if he delayed
longer. This was done and the barque snugged right down.</p>

<p>'Yet, though the work was done successfully, the captain's fears
were justified in a sufficiently horrible way, for as the men were
beginning to make their way in off the wards there was a loud crying
and shouting aloft and immediately afterwards a crash down on the
main deck, followed instantly by a second crash.</p>

<p>'"My God! Two of 'em!" shouted the skipper as he snatched a lamp
from the forrard binnacle. Then down on to the main deck. It was as
he had said. Two of the men had fallen, or--as the thought came to
me--been thrown from aloft and were lying silent on the deck. Above
us in the darkness I heard a few vague shouts followed by a curious
quiet, save for the constant blast of the wind whose whistling and
howling in the rigging seemed but to accentuate the complete and
frightened silence of the men aloft. Then I was aware that the men
were coming down swiftly and presently one after the other came with
a quick leap out of the rigging and stood about the two fallen men
with odd exclamations and questions which always merged off instantly
into new silence.</p>

<p>'And all the time I was conscious of a most extraordinary sense of
oppression and frightened distress and fearful expectation, for it
seemed to me, standing there near the dead in that unnatural wind
that a power of evil filled all the night about the ship and that
some fresh horror was imminent.</p>

<p>'The following morning there was a solemn little service, very
rough and crude, but undertaken with a nice reverence and the two men
who had fallen were tilted off from a hatch-cover and plunged
suddenly out of sight. As I watched them vanish in the deep blue of
the water an idea came to me and I spent part of the afternoon
talking it over with the captain, after which I passed the rest of
the time until sunset was upon us in arranging and fitting up a part
of my electrical apparatus. Then I went on deck and had a good look
round. The evening was beautifully calm and ideal for the experiment
which I had in mind, for the wind had died away with a peculiar
suddenness after the death of the two men and all that day the sea
had been like glass.</p>

<p>'To a certain extent I believed that I comprehended the primary
cause of the vague but peculiar manifestations which I had witnessed
the previous evening and which Captain Thompson believed implicitly
to be intimately connected with the death of the two sailormen.</p>

<p>'I believed the origin of the happenings to lie in a strange but
perfectly understandable cause, i.e., in that phenomenon known
technically as "attractive vibrations." Harzam, in his monograph on
"Induced Hauntings," points out that such are invariably produced by
"induced vibrations," that is, by temporary vibrations set up by some
outside cause.</p>

<p>'This is somewhat abstruse to follow out in a story of this kind,
but it was on a long consideration of these points that I had
resolved to make experiments to see whether I could not produce a
counter or "repellent" vibration, a thing which Harzam had succeeded
in producing on three occasions and in which I have had a partial
success once, failing only because of the imperfectness of the
apparatus I had aboard.</p>

<p>'As I have said, I can scarcely follow the reasoning further in a
brief record such as this, neither do I think it would be of interest
to you who are interested only in the startling and weird side of my
investigations. Yet I have told you sufficient to show you the germ
of my reasonings and to enable you to follow intelligently my hopes
and expectations in sending out what I hoped would prove "repellent"
vibrations.</p>

<p>'Therefore it was that when the sun had descended to within ten
degrees of the visible horizon the captain and I began to watch for
the appearance of the shadows. Presently, under the sun, I discovered
the same peculiar appearance of a moving greyness which I had seen on
the preceding night and almost immediately Captain Thompson told me
that he saw the same to the south.</p>

<p>'To the north and east we perceived the same extraordinary thing
and I at once set my electric apparatus at work, sending out the
strange repelling force to the dim, far shadows of mystery which
moved steadily out of the distance towards the vessel.</p>

<p>'Earlier in the evening the captain had snugged the barque right
down to her topsails, for as he said, until the calm went he would
risk nothing. According to him it was always during calm weather that
the extraordinary manifestations occurred. In this case he was
certainly justified, for a most tremendous squall struck the ship in
the middle watch, taking the fore upper topsail right out of the
ropes.</p>

<p>'At the time when it came I was lying down on a locker in the
saloon, but I ran up on to the poop as the vessel canted under the
enormous force of the wind. Here I found the air pressure tremendous
and the noise of the squall stunning. And over it all and through it
all I was conscious of something abnormal and threatening that set my
nerves uncomfortably acute. The thing was not natural.</p>

<p>'Yet, despite the carrying away of the topsail, not a man was sent
aloft.</p>

<p>'"Let 'em all go!" said old Captain Thompson. "I'd have shortened
her down to the bare sticks if I'd done all I wanted!"</p>

<p>'About two a.m. the squall passed with astonishing suddenness and
the night showed clear above the vessel. From then onward I paced the
poop with the skipper, often pausing at the break to look along the
lighted main deck. It was on one of these occasions that I saw
something peculiar. It was like a vague flitting of an impossible
shadow between me and the whiteness of the well-scrubbed decks. Yet,
even as I stared, the thing was gone and I could not say with surety
that I had seen anything.</p>

<p>'"Pretty plain to see, mister," said the captain's voice at my
elbow. "I've only seen that once before an' we lost half of the hands
that trip. We'd better be at 'ome, I'm thinkin'. It'll end in
scrappin' her, sure."</p>

<p>'The old man's calmness bewildered me almost as much as the
confirmation his remark gave that I had really seen something
abnormal floating between me and the deck eight feet below us.</p>

<p>'"Good lord, Captain Thompson," I exclaimed, "this is simply
infernal! "</p>

<p>'"Just that," he agreed. "I said, mister, you'd see if you'd wait.
And this ain't the half. You wait till you sees 'em looking like
little black clouds all over the sea round the ship and movin' steady
with the ship. All the same, I ain't seen 'em aboard but the once.
Guess we're in for it."'</p>

<p>'"How do you mean?" I asked. But though I questioned him in every
way I could get nothing satisfactory out of him.</p>

<p>'"You'll see, mister. You wait an' see. She's a queer un." And
that was about the extent of his further efforts and methods of
enlightening me.</p>

<p>'From then on through the rest of the watch I leaned over the
break of the poop, staring down at the maindeck and odd whiles taking
quick glances to the rear. The skipper had resumed his steady pacing
of the poop, but now and again he would come to a pause beside me and
ask calmly enough whether I had seen any more of "them there."</p>

<p>'Several times I saw the vagueness of something drifting in the
lights of the lanterns and a sort of wavering in the air in this
place and that, as if it might be an attenuated something having
movement, that was half-seen for a moment and then gone before my
brain could record anything definite.</p>

<p>'Towards the end of the watch, however, both the captain and I saw
something very extraordinary. He had just come beside me and was
leaning over the rail across the break. "Another of 'em there," he
remarked in his calm way, giving me a gentle nudge and nodding his
head towards the port side of the maindeck, a yard or two to our
left.</p>

<p>'In the place he had indicated there was a faint, dull shadowy
spot seeming suspended about a foot above the deck. This grew more
visible and there was movement in it and a constant, oily-seeming
whirling from the centre outwards. The thing expanded to several feet
across, with the lighted planks of the deck showing vaguely through.
The movement from the centre outwards was now becoming very distinct,
till the whole strange shape blackened and grew more dense, so that
the deck below was hidden.</p>

<p>'Then as I stared with the most intense interest there went a
thinning movement over the thing and almost directly it had dissolved
so that there was nothing more to be seen than a vague rounded shape
of shadow, hovering and convoluting dimly between us and the deck
below. This gradually thinned out and vanished and we were both of us
left staring down at a piece of the deck where the planking and
pitched seams showed plain and distinct in the light from the lamps
that were now hung nightly on the sherpoles.</p>

<p>'"Mighty queer that, mister," said the captain meditatively as he
fumbled for his pipe. "Mighty queer." Then he lit his pipe and began
again his pacing of the poop.</p>

<p>'The calm lasted for a week with the sea like glass and every
night without warning there was a repetition of the extraordinary
squall, so that the captain had everything made fast at dusk and
waited patiently for a trade wind.</p>

<p>'Each evening I experimented further with my attempts to set up
"repellent" vibrations, but without result. I am not sure whether I
ought to say that my meddling produced no result; for the calm
gradually assumed a more unnatural permanent aspect whilst the sea
looked more than ever like a plain of glass, bulged anon with the low
oily roll of some deep swell. For the rest, there was by day a
silence so profound as to give a sense of unrealness, for never a
sea-bird hove in sight whilst the movement of the vessel was so
slight as scarce to keep up the constant creak, creak of spars and
gear, which is the ordinary accompaniment of a calm.</p>

<p>'The sea appeared to have become an emblem of desolation and
freeness, so that it seemed to me at last that there was no more any
known world, but just one great ocean going on for ever into the far
distances in every direction. At night the strange squalls assumed a
far greater violence so that sometimes it seemed as if the very spars
would be ripped and twisted out of the vessel, yet fortunately no
harm came in that wise.</p>

<p>'As the days passed I became convinced at last that my experiments
were producing very distinct results, though the opposite to those
which I hoped to produce, for now at each sunset a sort of grey cloud
resembling light smoke would appear far away in every quarter almost
immediately upon the commencement of the vibrations, with the effect
that I desisted from any prolonged attempt and became more tentative
in my experiments.</p>

<p>'At last, however, when we had endured this condition of affairs
for a week, I had a long talk with old Captain Thompson and he agreed
to let me carry out a bold experiment to its conclusion. It was to
keep the vibrations going steadily at full power from a little before
sunset until the dawn and to take careful notes of the results.</p>

<p>'With this in view, all was made ready. The royal and t'gallant
yards were sent down, all the sails stowed and everything about the
decks made fast. A sea anchor was rigged out over the bows and a long
line of cable veered away. This was to ensure the vessel coming head
to wind should one of those strange squalls strike us from any
quarter during the night.</p>

<p>'Late in the afternoon the men were sent into the fo'c'sle and
told that they might please themselves and turn in or do anything
they liked, but that they were not to come on deck during the night
whatever happened. To ensure this the port and starboard doors were
padlocked. Afterwards I made the first and the eighth signs of the
Saaamaaa Ritual opposite each door-post, connecting them with triple
lines crossed at every seventh inch. You've dipped deeper into the
science of magic than I have, Arkright, and you will know what that
means. Following this I ran a wire entirely around the outside of the
fo'c'sle and connected it up with my machinery, which I had erected
in the sail-locker aft.</p>

<p>'"In any case," I explained to the captain, "they run practically
no risk other than the general risk which we may expect in the form
of a terrific storm-burst. The real danger will be to those who are
'meddling.' The 'path of the vibrations' will make a kind of 'halo'
round the apparatus. I shall have to be there to control and I'm
willing to risk it, but you'd better get into your cabin and the
three mates must do the same."</p>

<p>'This the old captain refused to do and the three mates begged to
be allowed to stay and "see the fun." I warned them very seriously
that there might be a very disagreeable and unavoidable danger, but
they agreed to risk it and I can tell you I was not sorry to have
their companionship.</p>

<p>'I set to work then, making them help where I needed help, and so
presently I had all my gear in order. Then I led my wires up through
the skylight from the cabin and set the vibrator dial and
trembler-box level, screwing them solidly down to the poop-deck, in
the clear space that lay between the foreside of the skylight and the
lid of the sail locker.</p>

<p>'I got the three mates and the captain to take their places close
together and I warned them not to move whatever happened. I set to
work then, alone, and chalked a temporary pentacle about the whole
lot of us, including the apparatus. Afterwards I made haste to get
the tubes of my electric pentacle fitted all about us, for it was
getting on to dusk. As soon as this was done I switched on the
current into the vacuum tubes and immediately the pale sickly glare
shone dull all about us, seeming cold and unreal in the last light of
the evening.</p>

<p>'Immediately afterwards I set the vibrations beating out into all
space and then I took my seat beside the control board. Here I had a
few words with the others, warning them again whatever they might
hear or see not to leave the pentacle, if they valued their lives.
They nodded to this and I knew that they were fully impressed with
the possibility of the unknown danger that we were meddling with.</p>

<p>'Then we settled down to watch. We were all in our oilskins, for I
expected the experiment to include some very peculiar behaviour on
the part of the elements and so we were ready to face the night. One
other thing I was careful to do and that was to confiscate all
matches so that no one should forgetfully light his pipe, for the
light rays are "paths" to certain of the Forces.</p>

<p>'With a pair of marine glasses I was staring round at the horizon.
All around, but miles away in the greying of the evening, there
seemed to be a strange, vague darkening of the surface of the sea.
This became more distinct and it seemed to me presently that it might
be a slight, low-lying mist far away about the ship. I watched it
very intently and the captain and the three mates were doing likewise
through their glasses.</p>

<p>'"Coming in on us at the rate o' knots, mister," said the old man
in a low voice. "This is what I call playin' with 'ell. I only hope
it'll all come right." That was all he said and afterwards there was
absolute silence from him and the others through the strange hours
that followed.</p>

<p>'As the night stole down upon the sea we lost sight of the
peculiar incoming circle of mist and there was a period of the most
intense and oppressive silence to the five of us, sitting there
watchful and quiet within the pale glow of the electric pentacle.</p>

<p>'A while later there came a sort of strange, noiseless lightning.
By noiseless I mean that while the Hashes appeared to be near at hand
and lit up all the vague sea around, yet there was no thunder;
neither, so it appeared to me, did there seem to be any reality in
the flashes. This is a queer thing to say but it describes my
impressions. It was as if I saw a representation of lightning rather
than the physical electricity itself. No, of course, I am not
pretending to use the word in its technical sense.</p>

<p>'Abruptly a strange quivering went through the vessel from end to
end and died away. I looked fore and aft and then glanced at the four
men who stared back at me with a sort of dumb and half-frightened
wonder, but no one said anything. About five minutes passed with no
sound anywhere except the faint buzz of the apparatus and nothing
visible anywhere except the noiseless lightning which came down,
flash after flash, lighting the sea all around the vessel.</p>

<p>'Then a most extraordinary thing happened. The peculiar quivering
passed again through the ship and died away. It was followed
immediately by a kind of undulation of the vessel, first fore and aft
and then from side to side. I can give you no better illustration of
the strangeness of the movement on that glass-like sea than to say
that it was just such a movement as might have been given her had an
invisible giant hand lifted her and toyed with her, canting her this
way and that with a certain curious and rather sickening rhythm of
movement. This appeared to last about two minutes, so far as I can
guess, and ended with the ship being shaken up and down several
times, after which there came again the quivering and then
quietness.</p>

<p>'A full hour must have passed during which I observed nothing
except that twice the vessel was faintly shaken and the second time
this was followed by a slight repetition of the curious undulations.
This, however, lasted but a few seconds and afterwards there was only
the abnormal and oppressive silence of the night, punctured time
after time by these noiseless flashes of lightning. All the time I
did my best to study the appearance of the sea and atmosphere around
the ship.</p>

<p>'One thing was apparent, that the surrounding wall of vagueness
had drawn in more upon the ship, so that the brightest flashes now
showed me no more than about a clear quarter of a mile of ocean
around us, after which the sight was just lost in trying to penetrate
a kind of shadowy distance that yet had no depth in it, but which
still lacked any power to arrest the vision at any particular point
so that one could not know definitely whether there was anything
there or not, but only that one's sight was limited by some
phenomenon which hid all the distant sea. Do I make this clear?</p>

<p>'The strange, noiseless lightning increased in vividness and the
flashes began to come more frequently. This went on till they were
almost continuous, so that all the near sea could be watched with
scarce an intermission. Yet the brightness of the flashes seemed to
have no power to dull the pale light of the curious detached glows
that circled in silent multitudes about us.</p>

<p>'About this time I became aware of a strange sense of
breathlessness. Each breath seemed to be drawn with difficulty and
presently with a sense of positive distress. The three mates and the
captain were breathing with curious little gasps and the faint buzz
of the vibrator seemed to come from a great distance away. For the
rest there was such a silence as made itself known like a dull,
numbing ache upon the brain.</p>

<p>'The minutes passed slowly and then, abruptly, I saw something
new. There were grey things floating in the air about the ship which
were so vague and attenuated that at first I could not be sure that I
saw anything, but in a while there could be no doubt that they were
there.</p>

<p>'They began to show plainer in the constant glare of the quiet
lightning and growing darker and darker they increased visibly in
size. They appeared to be but a few feet above the level of the sea
and they began to assume humped shapes.</p>

<p>'For quite half an hour, which seemed indefinitely longer, I
watched those strange humps like little hills of blackness floating
just above the surface of the water and moving round and round the
vessel with a slow, everlasting circling that produced on my eyes the
feeling that it was all a dream.</p>

<p>'It was later still that I discovered still another thing. Each of
those great vague mounds had begun to oscillate as it circled round
about us. I was conscious at the same time that there was
communicated to the vessel the beginning of a similar oscillating
movement, so very slight at first that I could scarcely be sure she
so much as moved.</p>

<p>'The movement of the ship grew with a steady oscillation, the bows
lifting first and then the stern, as if she were pivoted amidships.
This ceased and she settled down on to a level keel with a series of
queer jerks as if her weight were being slowly lowered again to the
buoying of the water.</p>

<p>'Suddenly there came a cessation of the extraordinary lightning
and we were in an absolute blackness with only the pale sickly glow
of the electric pentacle above us and the faint buzz of the apparatus
seeming far away in the night. Can you picture it all? The five of us
there, tense and watchful and wondering what was going to happen.</p>

<p>'The thing began gently--a little jerk upward of the starboard
side of the vessel, then a second jerk, then a third and the whole
ship was canted distinctly to port. It continued in a kind of slow
rhythmic tilting with curious timed pauses between the jerks and
suddenly, you know, I saw that we were in absolute danger, for the
vessel was being capsized by some enormous Force in the utter silence
and blackness of that night.</p>

<p>'"My God, mister, stop it!" came the captain's voice, quick and
very hoarse. "She'll be gone in a moment! She'll be gone!"</p>

<p>'He had got on to his knees and was staring round and gripping at
the deck. The three mates were also gripping at the deck with their
palms to stop them from sliding down the violent slope. In that
moment came a final tilting of the side of the vessel and the deck
rose up almost like a wall. I snatched at the lever of the vibrator
and switched it over.</p>

<p>'Instantly the angle of the deck decreased as the vessel righted
several feet with a jerk. The righting movement continued with little
rhythmic jerks until the ship was once more on an even keel.</p>

<p>'And even as she righted I was aware of an alteration in the
tenseness of the atmosphere and a great noise far off to starboard.
It was the roaring of wind. A huge flash of lightning was followed by
others and the thunder crashed continually overhead. The noise of the
wind to starboard rose to a loud screaming and drove towards us
through the night. Then the lightning ceased and the deep roll of the
thunder was lost in the nearer sound of the wind which was now within
a mile of us and making a most hideous, bellowing scream. The shrill
howling came at us out of the dark and covered every other sound. It
was as if all the night on that side were a vast cliff, sending down
high and monstrous echoes upon us. This is a queer thing to say, I
know, but it may help you to get the feeling of the thing; for that
just describes exactly how it felt to me at the time--that queer,
echoing, empty sense above us in the night, yet all the emptiness
filled with sound on high. Do you get it? It was most extraordinary
and there was a grand something about it all as if one had come
suddenly upon the steeps of some monstrous lost world.</p>

<p>'Then the wind rushed out at us and stunned us wit its sound and
force and fury. We were smothered and half-stunned. The vessel went
over on to her port side merely from pressure of the wind on her
naked spars and side. The whole night seemed one yell and the foam
roared and snowed over us in countless tons. I have never known
anything like it. We were all splayed about the poop, holding on to
anything we could, while the pentacle was smashed to atoms so that we
were in complete darkness. The storm-burst had come down on us.</p>

<p>'Towards morning the storm calmed and by evening we were running
before a fine breeze; yet the pumps had to be kept going steadily for
we had sprung a pretty bad leak, which proved so serious that we had
to take to the boats two days later. However, we were picked up that
night so that we had only a short time of it. As for the Jarvee, she
is now safely at the bottom of the Atlantic, where she had better
remain for ever.'</p>

<p>Carnacki came to an end and tapped out his pipe.</p>

<p>'But you haven't explained,' I remonstrated. 'What made her like
that? What made her different from other ships? Why did those shadows
and things come to her? What's your idea?'</p>

<p>'Well,' replied Carnacki, 'in my opinion she was a focus. That is
a technical term which I can best explain by saying that she
possessed the "attractive vibration" that is the power to draw to her
any psychic waves in the vicinity, much in the way of a medium. The
way in which the "vibration" is acquired--to use a technical term
again--is, of course, purely a matter for supposition. She may have
developed it during the years, owing to a suitability of conditions
or it may have been in her ("of her" is a better term) from the very
day her keel was laid. I mean the direction in which she lay the
condition of the atmosphere, the state of the "electric tensions,"
the very blows of the hammers and the accidental combining of
materials suited to such an end--all might tend to such a thing. And
this is only to speak of the known. The vast unknown it is vain to
speculate upon in a brief chatter like this.</p>

<p>'I would like to remind you here of that idea of mine that certain
forms of so-called "hauntings" may have their cause in the
"attractive vibrations." A building or a ship--just as I have
indicated--may develop "vibrations," even as certain materials in
combination under the proper conditions will certainly develop an
electric current.</p>

<p>'To say more in a talk of this scope is useless. I am more
inclined to remind you of the glass which will vibrate to a certain
note struck upon a piano and to silence all your worrying questions
with that simple little unanswered one: What is electricity? When
we've got that clear it will be time to take the next step in a more
dogmatic fashion. We are but speculating on the coasts of a strange
country of mystery. In this case, I think the next best step for you
all will be home and bed.'</p>

<p>And with this terse ending, in the most genial way possible,
Carnacki ushered us out presently on to the quiet chill of the
Embankment, replying heartily to our various good-nights.</p>

<h2><a name="c2"></a>The Find</h2>

<p>In response to Carnacki's usual card of invitation to dinner I
arrived in good time at Cheyne Walk to find Arkright, Taylor and
Jessop already there, and a few minutes later we were seated round
the dining table.</p>

<p>We dined well as usual, and as nearly always happened at these
gatherings Carnacki talked on every subject under the sun but the one
on which we had all expectations. It was not until we were all seated
comfortably in our respective armchairs that he began.</p>

<p>'A very simple case,' he told us, puffing at his pipe. 'Quite a
simple bit of mental analysis. I had been talking one day to Jones of
Malbrey and Jones, the editors of the Bibliophile and Book Table, and
he mentioned having come across a book called the Dumpley's
Acrostics. Now the only known copy of this book is in the Caylen
Museum. This second copy which had been picked up by a Mr. Ludwig
appeared to be genuine. Both Malbrey and Jones pronounced it to be
so, and that, to anyone knowing their reputation, would pretty well
settle it.</p>

<p>'I heard all about the book from my old friend Van Dyll, the
Dutchman who happened to be at the Club for lunch.</p>

<p>'"What do you know about a book called Dumpley's Acrostics?"' I
asked him.</p>

<p>'"You might as well ask me what I know of your city of London, my
friend," he replied. "I know all there is to know which is very
little. There was but one copy of that extraordinary book printed,
and that copy is now in the Caylen Museum."'</p>

<p>'"Exactly what I had thought,"' I told him.</p>

<p>'"The book was written by John Dumpley," he continued, "and
presented to Queen Elizabeth on her fortieth birthday. She had a
passion for word-play of that kind--which is merely literary
gymnastics but was raised by Dumpley to an extraordinary height of
involved and scandalous punning in which those unsavoury tales of
those at Court are told with a wit and pretended innocence that is
incredible in its malicious skill."'</p>

<p>'"The type was distributed and the manuscript burnt immediately
after printing that one copy which was for the Queen. The book was
presented to her by Lord Welbeck who paid John Dumpley twenty English
guineas and twelve sheep each year with twelve firkins of Miller
Abbott's ale to hold his tongue. Lord Welbeck wished to be thought
the author of the book, and undoubtedly he had supplied Dumpley with
the very scandalous and intimate details of famous Court personages
about whom the book is written."'</p>

<p>'"He had his own name put in the place of Dumpley's; for though it
was not a matter for much pride for a well born man to write well in
those days, still a good wit such as the Acrostics was deemed to be
was a thing for high praise at the Court."'</p>

<p>'"I'd no idea it was as famous as you say,"' I told him.</p>

<p>'"It has a great fame among a few," replied Van Dyll, "because it
is at the same time unique and of a value both historic and
intrinsic. There are collectors today who would give their souls if a
second copy might be discovered. But that's impossible."'</p>

<p>'"The impossible seems to have been achieved," I said. "A second
copy is being offered for sale by a Mr. Ludwig. I have been asked to
make a few investigations. Hence my inquiries."'</p>

<p>'Van Dyll almost exploded.'</p>

<p>'"Impossible!" he roared. "It's another fraud!"'</p>

<p>'Then I fired my shell.'</p>

<p>'"Messrs. Malbrey and Jones have pronounced it unmistakably
genuine," I said, "and they are, as you know, above suspicion. Also
Mr. Ludwig's account of how he bought the book at a 'dump' sale in
the Charing Cross Road seems quite straight and above-board. He got
it at Bentloes, and I've just been up there. Mr. Bentloes says it is
quite possible though not probable. And anyway, he's mighty sick
about it. I don't wonder, either!"'</p>

<p>'Van Dyll got to his feet.'</p>

<p>'"Come on round to Malbrey and Jones," he said excitedly, and we
went straight off to the offices of the bibliophile where Dyll is
well-known.'</p>

<p>'"What's all this about?" he called out almost before he got into
the Editors' private room. "What's all this about the Dumpley's
Acrostics, eh? Show it to me. Where is it?"</p>

<p>'"It's that newly discovered copy of the Acrostics the Professor
is asking for," I explained to Mr. Malbrey who was at his desk. "He's
somewhat upset at the news I've just given him."</p>

<p>'Probably to no other men in England, except its lawful owner,
would Malbrey have handed the discovered volume on so brief a notice.
But Van Dyll is among the great ones when it comes to bibliology, and
Malbrey merely wheeled round in his office chair and opened a large
safe. From this he took a volume wrapped about with tissue paper, and
standing up he handed it ceremoniously to Professor Dyll.</p>

<p>'Van Dyll literally snatched it from him, tore off the paper and
ran to the window to have a better light. There for nearly an hour,
while we watched in silence, he examined the book, using a magnifying
glass as he studied type, paper, and binding.</p>

<p>'At last he sat back and brushed his hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>'"Well?" we all asked.</p>

<p>'"It appears to be genuine," he said. "Before pronouncing finally
upon it, however, I should like to have the opportunity of comparing
it with the authentic copy in the Caylen Museum."</p>

<p>'Mr. Malbrey rose from his seat and closed his desk.</p>

<p>'"I shall be delighted to come with you now, Professor," he said.
"We shall be only too pleased to have your opinion in the next issue
of the Bibliophile which we are making a special Dumpley number, for
the interest aroused by this find will be enormous among
collectors."'</p>

<p>'When we all arrived at the Museum, Van Dyll sent in his name to
the chief librarian and we were all invited into his private room.
Here the Professor stated the facts and showed him the book he had
brought along with him.</p>

<p>'The librarian was tremendously interested, and after a brief
examination of the copy expressed his opinion that it was apparently
genuine, but he would like to compare it with the authentic copy.</p>

<p>'This he did and the three experts compared the book with the
Museum copy for considerably over an hour, during which time I
listened keenly and jotted down from time to time in my notebook my
own conclusions.</p>

<p>'The verdict of all three was finally unanimous that the newly
found copy of the Acrostics was undoubtedly genuine and printed at
the same time and from the same type as the Museum copy.</p>

<p>'"Gentlemen," I said, "as I am working in the interests of Messrs.
Malbrey and Jones, may I ask two questions? First, I should like to
ask the librarian whether the Museum copy has ever been lent out of
the Museum."'</p>

<p>'"Certainly not," replied the librarian. "Rare editions are never
loaned, and are rarely even handled except in the presence of an
attendant."'</p>

<p>'"Thanks," I said. "That ought to settle things pretty well. The
other question I wish to ask is why were you all so convinced before
that there was but one copy in existence?"'</p>

<p>'"Because," said the librarian, "as both Mr. Malbrey and Professor
Dyll could tell you, Lord Welbeck states in his private Memoirs that
only one copy was printed. He appears to have been determined upon
this, apparently to enhance the value of his gift to the Queen. He
states clearly that he had the one copy printed, and that the
printing was done entirely in his presence at the House of Pennywell,
Printers of Lamprey Court. You can see the name at the beginning of
the book. He also personally superintended the distribution of the
type and burnt the manuscript and even the proof-pulls, as he says.
Indeed, so precise and unmistakable are his statements on these
points that I should always refuse to consider the authenticity of
any 'found' copy unless it could stand such a drastic test as this
one has been put through. But here is the copy," he went on,
"unmistakably genuine, and we have to take the evidence of our senses
rather than the evidence of Lord Welbeck's statement. The finding of
this book is a kind of literary thunderbolt. It will make some
commotion in the collecting dove-cotes if I'm not mistaken!"'</p>

<p>'"What should you estimate its possible value at?" I asked
him.'</p>

<p>'He shrugged his shoulders.'</p>

<p>'"Impossible to say," he answered. "If I were a rich man I would
gladly give a thousand pounds to possess it. Professor Dyll there,
being more fortunately endowed with worldly wealth, would probably
outbid me unmercifully! I expect if Messrs. Malbrey and Jones do not
buy it soon it will go across to America in the wake of half the
treasures of the earth."</p>

<p>'We separated then and went our various ways. I returned here, had
a cup of tea and sat down for a good long think, for I wasn't at all
satisfied in my mind that everything was as plain and aboveboard as
it seemed.</p>

<p>'"Now," I said to myself, "let's have a little plain and unbiased
reasoning applied, and see what comes of the test."'</p>

<p>'"First of all there is the apparently incontrovertible statement
in Lord Welbeck's Memoirs that there was only one copy of the
Acrostics printed. That titled gentleman evidently took extraordinary
pains to see that no second copy of the book was printed, and the
very proofs he burned. Also this copy is no conglomeration of
collected printer's proofs, for the examination the three experts
have given it quite preclude that idea. All this points then to what
I might term 'Certainty Number One,' that only one copy was
printed."'</p>

<p>'"But now--come to the next step, a second copy has been proved
today to exist. That is Certainty Number Two. And the two make that
impossibility--a paradox. Therefore, though of the two certainties I
may be bound in the end to accept the second, yet equally I cannot
accept the complete smashing of the plain statement made in Lord
Welbeck's private Memoirs. There seems to be more in this than meets
the eye."'</p>

<p>Carnacki puffed thoughtfully at his pipe for a few minutes before
he resumed his story.</p>

<p>'In the next few days,' he continued, 'by simple methods of
deduction and a matter-of-fact following of the dues that were
thereby indicated, I had laid bare as cunningly planned a little
drama of clever crime as I have ever met with.</p>

<p>'I got into communication with Scotland Yard, my clients Messrs.
Malbrey and Jones, Ralph Ludwig the owner of the find, and Mr. Notts
the librarian. I arranged for a detective from the Yard to meet us
all at the offices of the Bibliophile and Book Table, and I managed
to persuade Notts to bring along with him the Museum copy of the
Acrostics.</p>

<p>'In this way I had my stage set, with all the characters involved,
in that little bookish office of the hundred-year-old Collectors'
Weekly.</p>

<p>'The meeting was for three in the afternoon, and when they had all
arrived I asked them to listen to me for a few minutes.</p>

<p>'"Gentlemen," I said, "I should like you to follow me a little in
a line of reasoning which I wish to indicate to you. Two days ago Mr.
Ludwig brought to this office a copy of a book of which only one copy
was supposed to be extant. An examination of his find by three
experts, perhaps the three greatest experts in England, proved it to
be undoubtedly genuine. That is fact number one. Fact number two is
that there were the very best reasons for supposing there could not
be two original copies of this particular book in existence."'</p>

<p>'"Now we were forced, by the experts' opinion, into accepting the
first fact as indubitable. But there still remained to explain away
the second fact, that is, the good reason for supposing that only one
copy of this book was originally printed."'</p>

<p>'"I found that although I was forced to accept the fact of the
finding of the second copy, yet I could not see how to explain away
the good reason I have mentioned. Therefore, not feeling that my
reason was satisfied I followed the line of investigation which
unsatisfied reason indicated. I went to the Caylen Museum and asked
questions."'</p>

<p>'"I had already learned from Mr. Notts that rare editions were
never loaned. And an examination of the registers showed that the
Acrostics had been referred to only three times by three different
people in the last two years, and then, as I knew, always in the
presence of an attendant. This seemed proof enough that I was hunting
a mare's nest; but reason still asserted that there were more things
not explained. So I went home and thought it all out again."'</p>

<p>'"One deduction remained from all my hours of thinking. That was
that the three different men who had examined the book within the
last two years could be the only line of explanation left to me. I
had found out their names--Charles, Noble and Waterfield. My
meditations suggested a handwriting expert, and the two of us visited
the Museum register with the result that I found my reason had not
led me astray. The expert pronounced the handwriting of the three men
to be the handwriting of one and the same person."'</p>

<p>'"My next step was simple. I came here to the office with the
expert and asked if I could be shown any handwriting of Mr. Ralph
Ludwig. I could, and the expert assured me that Mr. Ludwig was the
man who had written the three different signatures in the register of
the Museum."'</p>

<p>'"The next step is deduction on my part and is indicated by
reasoning as the only possible lines on which Mr. Ludwig could have
worked. I can only suppose that he must have come across a dummy copy
of the Acrostics in some way or other, possibly in the bundle of
books he says he picked up at Bentloes' sale. This blank-paper dummy
of the book would be made up by the printers and bookbinders so as to
enable Lord Welbeck to see how the Acrostics would bind up and bulk.
The method is common in the publishing trade, as you know. The
binding may be exactly a duplicate of what the finished article will
be but the inside is nothing but blank paper of the same thickness
and quality as that on which the book will be printed. In this way a
publisher can see beforehand just how the book will look."'</p>

<p>'"I am quite convinced that I have described the first step in Mr.
Ludwig's ingenious little plot. He made only three visits to the
Museum and as you will see in a minute, if he had not been provided
with a facsimile in binding of the Acrostics on his first visit, he
could not have carried out his plot under four. Moreover, unless I am
mistaken in my psychology of the incident it was through becoming
possessed of this particular dummy copy that he thought out this
scheme. Is that not so, Mr. Ludwig?" I asked him. But he refused to
reply to my question, and sat there looking very crestfallen.'</p>

<p>'"Well, gentlemen," I went on, "the rest is plain sailing. He went
the first time to the Museum to study their copy, after which he
deftly replaced it with the dummy one he had brought in with him. The
attendant took the copy--which was externally identical with the
original and replaced it in its case. This was, of course, the one
big risk in Mr. Ludwig's little adventure. A smaller risk was that
someone should call and ask for the Acrostics before he could replace
it with the original, for this was what he meant to do, and which he
did after he had photographed each page. Isn't that so, Mr. Ludwig?"
I asked him; but he still refused to open his mouth.'</p>

<p>'"This," I resumed, "accounts for his second visit when he
returned the original and started to print on a handpress the
photographic blocks which he had prepared. Once the pages were bound
up in the dummy he went back to the Museum and exchanged the copies,
this time taking away for keeps the Museum copy and leaving the very
excellently printed dummy in its place. Each time, as you know, he
used a new name and a new handwriting, and probably disguises of some
kind; for he had no wish to be connected with the Museum copy. That
is all I have to tell you; but I hardly think Mr. Ludwig will care to
deny my story, eh, Mr. Ludwig?"'</p>

<p>Carnacki knocked out the ashes of his, pipe as he finished.</p>

<p>'I can't imagine what he stole it for,' said Arkright. 'He could
surely never have hoped to sell it.'</p>

<p>'No, that's true,' Carnacki replied. 'Certainly not in the open
market. He would have to sell it to some unscrupulous collector who
would, of course, knowing it was stolen, give him next to nothing for
it, and might in the end hand him over to the police. But don't you
see if he could so arrange that the Museum still had its copy he
might sell his own without fear in the open market to the highest
bidder, as an authentic second copy which had come to light. He had
sense to know that his copy would be mercilessly challenged and
examined, and that is why he made his third exchange, and finally
left his dummy, printed as exactly like the original as was possible,
and took away with him the authentic copy.'</p>

<p>'But the two books were bound to be compared,' I argued.</p>

<p>'Quite true, but the copy at the Museum would not be so
suspiciously examined. Everyone considered that book beyond
suspicion. If the three experts had given the same attention to the
false copy in the Museum which they thought all the time was the
original, I don't suppose for a moment this little story would have
been told. It's a very good example of the way people take things for
granted. Out you go!' he said, genially, which was his usual method
of dismissing us. And a few minutes later we were out on the
Embankment.</p>

<h2><a name="c3"></a>The Hog</h2>

<p>We had finished dinner and Carnacki had drawn his big chair up to
the fire, and started his pipe.</p>

<p>Jessop, Arkright, Taylor and I had each of us taken up our
favourite positions, and waited for Carnacki to begin.</p>

<p>'What I'm going to tell you about happened in the next room,' he
said, after drawing at his pipe for a while. 'It has been a terrible
experience. Doctor Witton first brought the case to my notice. We'd
been chatting over a pipe at the Club one night about an article in
the Lancet, and Witton mentioned having just such a similar case in a
man called Bains. I was interested at once. It was one of those cases
of a gap or flaw in a man's protection barrier, I call it. A failure
to be what I might term efficiently insulated--spiritually--from the
outer monstrosities.</p>

<p>'From what I knew of Witton, I knew he'd be no use. You all know
Witton. A decent sort, hard-headed, practical,
stand-no-kind-of-nonsense sort of man, all right at his own job when
that job's a fractured leg or a broken collarbone; but he'd never
have made anything of the Bains case.'</p>

<p>For a space Carnacki puffed meditatively at his pipe, and we
waited for him to go on with his tale.</p>

<p>'I told Witton to send Bains to me,' he resumed, 'and the
following Saturday he came up. A little sensitive man. I liked him as
soon as I set eyes on him. After a bit, I got him to explain what was
troubling him, and questioned him about what Doctor Witton had called
his "dreams."</p>

<p>'"They're more than dreams," he said, "they're so real that
they're actual experiences to me. They're simply horrible. And yet
there's nothing very definite in them to tell you about. They
generally come just as I am going off to sleep. I'm hardly over
before suddenly I seem to have got down into some deep, vague place
with some inexplicable and frightful horror all about me. I can never
understand what it is, for I never see anything, only I always get a
sudden knowledge like a warning that I have got down into some
terrible place--a sort of hellplace I might call it, where I've no
business ever to have wandered; and the warning is always
insistent--even imperative--that I must get out, get out, or some
enormous horror will come at me."</p>

<p>'"Can't you pull yourself back?" I asked him. "Can't you wake
up?"</p>

<p>'"No," he told me. "That's just what I can't do, try as I will. I
can't stop going along this labyrinth-of-hell as I call it to myself,
towards some dreadful unknown Horror. The warning is repeated, ever
so strongly--almost as if the live me of my waking moments was awake
and aware. Something seems to warn me to wake up, that whatever I do
I must wake, wake, and then my consciousness comes suddenly alive and
I know that my body is there in the bed, but my essence or spirit is
still down there in that hell, wherever it is, in a danger that is
both unknown and inexpressible; but so overwhelming that my whole
spirit seems sick with terror."'</p>

<p>'"I keep saying to myself all the time that I must wake up," he
continued, "but it is as if my spirit is still down there, and as if
my consciousness knows that some tremendous invisible Power is
fighting against me. I know that if I do not wake then, I shall never
wake up again, but go down deeper and deeper into some stupendous
horror of soul destruction. So then I fight. My body lies in the bed
there, and pulls. And the power down there in that labyrinth exerts
itself too so that a feeling of despair, greater than any I have ever
known on this earth, comes on me. I know that if I give way and cease
to fight, and do not wake, then I shall pass out--out to that
monstrous Horror which seems to be silently calling my soul to
destruction."'</p>

<p>'"Then I make a final stupendous effort," he continued, "and my
brain seems to fill my body like the ghost of my soul. I can even
open my eyes and see with my brain, or consciousness, out of my own
eyes. I can see the bedclothes, and I know just how I am lying in the
bed; yet the real me is down in that hell in terrible danger. Can you
get me?" he asked.'</p>

<p>'"Perfectly," I replied.'</p>

<p>'"Well, you know," he went on, "I fight and fight. Down there in
that great pit my very soul seems to shrink back from the call of
some brooding horror that impels it silently a little further, always
a little further round a visible corner, which if I once pass I know
I shall never return again to this world. Desperately I fight brain
and consciousness fighting together to help it. The agony is so great
that I could scream were it "'not that I am rigid and frozen in the
bed with fear.</p>

<p>'"Then, just when my strength seems almost gone, soul and body
win, and blend slowly. And I lie there worn out with this terrible
extraordinary fight. I have still a sense of a dreadful horror all
about me, as if out of that horrible place some brooding monstrosity
had followed me up, and hangs still and silent and invisible over me,
threatening me there in my bed. Do I make it clear to you?" he asked.
"It's like some monstrous Presence."'</p>

<p>'"Yes," I said. "I follow you."'</p>

<p>'The man's forehead was actually covered with sweat, so keenly did
he live again through the horrors he had experienced.'</p>

<p>'After a while he continued:'</p>

<p>'"Now comes the most curious part of the dream or whatever it is,"
he said. "There's always a sound I hear as I lie there exhausted in
the bed. It comes while the bedroom is still full of the sort of
atmosphere of monstrosity that seems to come up with me when I get
out of that place. I hear the sound coming up out of that enormous
depth, and it is always the noise of pigs--pigs grunting, you know.
It's just simply dreadful. The dream is always the same. Sometimes
I've had it every single night for a week, until I fight not to go to
sleep; but, of course, I have to sleep sometimes. I think that's how
a person might go mad, don't you?" he finished.'</p>

<p>'I nodded, and looked at his sensitive face. Poor beggar! He had
been through it, and no mistake.'</p>

<p>'"Tell me some more," I said. "The grunting--what does it sound
like exactly?"'</p>

<p>'"It's just like pigs grunting," he told me again. "Only much more
awful. There are grunts, and squeals and pighowls, like you hear when
their food is being brought to them at a pig farm. You know those
large pig farms where they keep hundreds of pigs. All the grunts,
squeals and howls blend into one brutal chaos of sound--only it isn't
a chaos. It all blends in a queer horrible way. I've heard it. A sort
of swinish clamouring melody that grunts and roars and shrieks in
chunks of grunting sounds, all tied together with squealings and shot
through with pig howls. I've sometimes thought there was a definite
beat in it; for every now and again there comes a gargantuan GRUNT,
breaking through the million pig-voiced roaring--a stupendous GRUNT
that comes in with a beat. Can you understand me? It seems to shake
everything.... It's like a spiritual earthquake. The howling,
squealing, grunting, rolling clamour of swinish noise coming up out
of that place, and then the monstrous GRUNT rising up through it all,
an ever-recurring beat out of the depth--the voice of the
swine-mother of monstrosity beating up from below through that chorus
of mad swine-hunger.... It's no use! I can't explain it. No one ever
could. It's just terrible! And I'm afraid you're saying to yourself
that I'm in a bad way; that I want a change or a tonic; that I must
buck up or I'll land myself in a madhouse. If only you could
understand! Doctor Witton seemed to half understand, I thought; but I
know he's only sent me to you as a sort of last hope. He thinks I'm
booked for the asylum. I could tell it."'</p>

<p>'"Nonsense!" I said. "Don't talk such rubbish. You're as sane as I
am. Your ability to think clearly what you want to tell me, and then
to transmit it to me so well that you compel my mental retina to see
something of what you have seen, stands sponsor for your mental
balance."'</p>

<p>'"I am going to investigate your case, and if it is what I
suspect, one of those rare instances of a 'flaw' or 'gap' in your
protective barrier (what I might call your spiritual insulation from
the Outer Monstrosities) I've no doubt we can end the trouble. But
we've got to go properly into the matter first, and there will
certainly be danger in doing so."'</p>

<p>'"I'll risk it," replied Bains. "I can't go on like this any
longer."'</p>

<p>'"Very well," I told him. "Go out now, and come back at five
o'clock. I shall be ready for you then. And don't worry about your
sanity. You're all right, and we'll soon make things safe for you
again. Just keep cheerful and don't brood about it."'</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>'I put in the whole afternoon preparing my experimenting room,
across the landing there, for his case. When he returned at five
o'clock I was ready for him and took him straight into the room.</p>

<p>'It gets dark now about six-thirty, as you know, and I had just
nice time before it grew dusk to finish my arrangements. I prefer
always to be ready before the dark comes.</p>

<p>'Bains touched my elbow as we walked into the room.</p>

<p>'"There's something I ought to have told you," he said, looking
rather sheepish. "I've somehow felt a bit ashamed of it."</p>

<p>'"Out with it," I replied.</p>

<p>'He hesitated a moment, then it came out with a jerk.</p>

<p>'"I told you about the grunting of the pigs," he said. "Well, I
grunt too. I know it's horrible. When I lie there in bed and hear
those sounds after I've come up, I just grunt back as if in reply. I
can't stop myself. I just do it. Something makes me. I never told
Doctor Witton that. I couldn't. I'm sure now you think me mad," he
concluded.</p>

<p>'He looked into my face, anxious and queerly ashamed.</p>

<p>'"It's only the natural sequence of the abnormal events, and I'm
glad you told me," I said, slapping him on the back. "It follows
logically on what you had already told me. I have had two cases that
in some way resembled yours."</p>

<p>'"What happened?" he asked me. "Did they get better?"</p>

<p>'"One of them is alive and well today, Mr. Bains," I replied. "The
other man lost his nerve, and fortunately for all concerned, he is
dead."</p>

<p>'I shut the door and locked it as I spoke, and Bains stared round,
rather alarmed, I fancy, at my apparatus.</p>

<p>'"What are you going to do?" he asked. "Will it be a dangerous
experiment?"</p>

<p>'"Dangerous enough," I answered, "if you fail to follow my
instructions absolutely in everything. We both run the risk of never
leaving this room alive. Have I your word that I can depend on you to
obey me whatever happens?"</p>

<p>'He stared round the room and then back at me.</p>

<p>'"Yes," he replied. And, you know, I felt he would prove the right
kind of stuff when the moment came.</p>

<p>'I began now to get things finally in train for the night's work.
I told Bains to take off his coat and his boots. Then I dressed him
entirely from head to foot in a single thick rubber
combination-overall, with rubber gloves, and a helmet with ear-flaps
of the same material attached.</p>

<p>'I dressed myself in a similar suit. Then I began on the next
stage of the night's preparations.</p>

<p>'First I must tell you that the room measures thirty-nine feet by
thirty-seven, and has a plain board floor over which is fitted a
heavy, half-inch rubber covering.</p>

<p>'I had cleared the floor entirely, all but the exact centre where
I had placed a glass-legged, upholstered table, a pile of vacuum
tubes and batteries, and three pieces of special apparatus which my
experiment required.</p>

<p>'"Now Bains," I called, "come and stand over here by this table.
Don't move about. I've got to erect a protective 'barrier' round us,
and on no account must either of us cross over it by even so much as
a hand or foot, once it is built."</p>

<p>'We went over to the middle of the room, and he stood by the
glass-legged table while I began to fit the vacuum tubing together
round us.</p>

<p>'I intended to use the new spectrum "defense" which I have been
perfecting lately. This, I must tell you, consists of seven glass
vacuum circles with the red on the outside, and the colour circles
lying inside it, in the order of orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo
and violet.</p>

<p>'The room was still fairly light, but a slight quantity of dusk
seemed to be already in the atmosphere, and I worked quickly.</p>

<p>'Suddenly, as I fitted the glass tubes together I was aware of
some vague sense of nerve-strain, and glancing round at Bains who was
standing there by the table I noticed him staring fixedly before him.
He looked absolutely drowned in uncomfortable memories.</p>

<p>'"For goodness' sake stop thinking of those horrors," I called out
to him. "I shall want you to think hard enough about them later; but
in this specially constructed room it is better not to dwell on
things of that kind till the barriers are up. Keep your mind on
anything normal or superficial--the theatre will do--think about that
last piece you saw at the Gaiety. I'll talk to you in a moment."</p>

<p>'Twenty minutes later the "barrier" was completed all round us,
and I connected up the batteries. The room by this time was greying
with the coming dusk, and the seven differently coloured circles
shone out with extraordinary effect, sending out a cold glare.</p>

<p>'"By Jove!" cried Bains, "that's very wonderful--very
wonderful!"</p>

<p>'My other apparatus which I now began to arrange consisted of a
specially made camera, a modified form of phonograph with ear-pieces
instead of a horn, and a glass disk composed of many fathoms of glass
vacuum tubes arranged in a special way. It had two wires leading to
an electrode constructed to fit round the head.</p>

<p>'By the time I had looked over and fixed up these three things,
night had practically come, and the darkened room shone most
strangely in the curious upward glare of the seven vacuum tubes.</p>

<p>'"Now, Bains," I said, "I want you to lie on this table. Now put
your hands down by your sides and lie quiet and think. You've just
got two things to do," I told him. "One is to lie there and
concentrate your thoughts on the details of the dream you are always
having, and the other is not to move off this table whatever you see
or hear, or whatever happens, unless I tell you. You understand,
don't you?"</p>

<p>'"Yes," he answered, "I think you may rely on me not to make a
fool of myself. I feel curiously safe with you somehow."</p>

<p>'"I'm glad of that," I replied. "But I don't want you to minimise
the possible danger too much. There may be horrible danger. Now, just
let me fix this band on your head," I added, as I adjusted the
electrode. I gave him a few more instructions, telling him to
concentrate his thoughts particularly upon the noises he heard just
as he was waking, and I warned him again not to let himself fall
asleep. "Don't talk," I said, "and don't take any notice of me. If
you find I disturb your concentration keep your eyes closed."</p>

<p>'He lay back and I walked over to the glass disk arranging the
camera in front of it on its stand in such a way that the lens was
opposite the centre of the disk.</p>

<p>'I had scarcely done this when a ripple of greenish light ran
across the vacuum tubes of the disk. This vanished, and for maybe a
minute there was complete darkness. Then the green light rippled once
more across it--rippled and swung round, and began to dance in
varying shades from a deep heavy green to a rank ugly shade; back and
forward, back and forward.</p>

<p>'Every half second or so there shot across the varying greens a
flicker of yellow, an ugly, heavy repulsive yellow, and then abruptly
there came sweeping across the disk a great beat of muddy red. This
died as quickly as it came, and gave place to the changing greens
shot through by the unpleasant and ugly yellow hues. About every
seventh second the disk was submerged, and the other colours
momentarily blotted out by the great beat of heavy, muddy red which
swept over everything.</p>

<p>'"He's concentrating on those sounds," I said to myself, and I
felt queerly excited as I hurried on with my operations. I threw a
word over my shoulder to Bains.</p>

<p>'"Don't get scared, whatever happens," I said. "You're all
right!"</p>

<p>'I proceeded now to operate my camera. It had a long roll of
specially prepared paper ribbon in place of a film or plates. By
turning the handle the roll passed through the machine exposing the
ribbon.</p>

<p>'It took about five minutes to finish the roll, and during ail
that time the green lights predominated; but the dull heavy beat of
muddy red never ceased to flow across the vacuum tubes of the disk at
every seventh second. It was like a recurrent beat in some unheard
and somehow displeasing melody.</p>

<p>'Lifting the exposed spool of paper ribbon out of the camera I
laid it horizontally in the two "rests" that I had arranged for it on
my modified gramaphone. Where the paper had been acted upon by the
varying coloured lights which had appeared on the disk, the prepared
surface had risen in curious, irregular little waves.</p>

<p>'I unrolled about a foot of the ribbon and attached the loose end
to an empty spool-roller (on the opposite side of the machine) which
I had geared to the driving clockwork mechanism of the gramophone.
Then I took the diaphragm and lowered it gently into place above the
ribbon. Instead of the usual needle the diaphragm was fitted with a
beautifully made metal-filament brush, about an inch broad, which
just covered the whole breadth of the ribbon. This fine and fragile
brush rested lightly on the prepared surface of the paper, and when I
started the machine the ribbon began to pass under the brush, and as
it passed, the delicate metal-filament "bristles" followed every
minute inequality of those tiny, irregular wave-like excrescences on
the surface.</p>

<p>'I put the ear-pieces to my ears, and instantly I knew that I had
succeeded in actually recording what Bains had heard in his sleep. In
fact, I was even then hearing "mentally" by means of his effort of
memory. I was listening to what appeared to be the faint, far-off
squealing and grunting of countless swine. It was extraordinary, and
at the same time exquisitely horrible and vile. It frightened me,
with a sense of my having come suddenly and unexpectedly too near to
something foul and most abominably dangerous.</p>

<p>'So strong and imperative was this feeling that I twitched the
ear-pieces out of my ears, and sat a while staring round the room
trying to steady my sensations back to normality.</p>

<p>'The room looked strange and vague in the dull glow of light from
the circles, and I had a feeling that a taint of monstrosity was all
about me in the air. I remembered what Bains had told me of the
feeling he'd always had after coming up out of "that place"--as if
some horrible atmosphere had followed him up and filled his bedroom.
I understood him perfectly now--so much so that I had mentally used
almost his exact phrase in explaining to myself what I felt.</p>

<p>'Turning round to speak to him I saw there was something curious
about the centre of the "defense."</p>

<p>'Now, before I tell you fellows any more I must explain that there
are certain, what I call "focussing", qualities about this new
"defense" I've been trying.</p>

<p>'The Sigsand manuscript puts it something like this: "Avoid
diversities of colour; nor stand ye within the barrier of the colour
lights; for in colour hath Satan a delight. Nor can he abide in the
Deep if ye adventure against him armed with red purple. So be warned.
Neither forget that in blue, which is God's colour in the Heavens, ye
have safety."</p>

<p>'You see, from that statement in the Sigsand manuscript I got my
first notion for this new "defense" of mine. I have aimed to make it
a "defense" and yet have "focussing" or "drawing" qualities such as
the Sigsand hints at. I have experimented enormously, and I've proved
that reds and purples--the two extreme colours of the spectrum--are
fairly dangerous; so much so that I suspect they actually "draw" or
"focus" the outside forces. Any action or "meddling" on the part of
the experimentalist is tremendously enhanced in its effect if the
action is taken within barriers composed of these colours, in certain
proportions and tints.</p>

<p>'In the same way blue is distinctly a "general defense." Yellow
appears to be neutral, and green a wonderful protection within
limits. Orange, as far as I can tell, is slightly attractive and
indigo is dangerous by itself in a limited way, but in certain
combinations with the other colours it becomes a very powerful
"defense". I've not yet discovered a tenth of the possibilities of
these circles of mine. It's a kind of colour organ upon which I seem
to play a tune of colour combinations that can be either safe or
infernal in its effects. You know I have a keyboard with a separate
switch to each of the colour circles.</p>

<p>'Well, you fellows will understand now what I felt when I saw the
curious appearance of the floor in the middle of the "defense." It
looked exactly as if a circular shadow lay, not just on the floor,
but a few inches above it. The shadow seemed to deepen and blacken at
the centre even while I watched it. It appeared to be spreading from
the centre outwardly, and all the time it grew darker.</p>

<p>'I was watchful, and not a little puzzled; for the combination of
lights that I had switched on approximated a moderately safe "general
defense." Understand, I had no intention of making a focus until I
had learnt more. In fact, I meant that first investigation not to go
beyond a tentative inquiry into the kind of thing I had got to deal
with.</p>

<p>'I knelt down quickly and felt the floor with the palm of my hand,
but it was quite normal to the feel, and that reassured me that there
was no Saaaiti mischief abroad; for that is a form of danger which
can involve, and make use of, the very material of the "defense"
itself. It can materialise out of everything except fire.</p>

<p>'As I knelt there I realised all at once that the legs of the
table on which Bains lay were partly hidden in the ever blackening
shadow, and my hands seemed to grow vague as I felt at the floor.</p>

<p>'I got up and stood away a couple of feet so as to see the
phenomenon from a little distance. It struck me then that there was
something different about the table itself. It seemed unaccountably
lower.</p>

<p>'"It's the shadow hiding the legs," I thought to myself. "This
promises to be interesting; but I'd better not let things go too
far."</p>

<p>'I called out to Bains to stop thinking so hard. "Stop
concentrating for a bit," I said; but he never answered, and it
occurred to me suddenly that the table appeared to be still
lower.</p>

<p>'"Bains," I shouted, "stop thinking a moment." Then in a flash I
realised it. "Wake up, man! Wake up!" I cried.</p>

<p>'He had fallen over asleep--the very last thing he should have
done; for it increased the danger twofold. No wonder I had been
getting such good results! The poor beggar was worn out with his
sleepless nights. He neither moved nor spoke as I strode across to
him.</p>

<p>'"Wake up!" I shouted again, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>'My voice echoed uncomfortably round the big empty room; and Bains
lay like a dead man.</p>

<p>'As I shook him again I noticed that I appeared to be standing up
to my knees in the circular shadow. It looked like the mouth of a
pit. My legs, from the knees downwards, were vague. The floor under
my feet felt solid and firm when I stamped on it; but all the same I
had a feeling that things were going a bit too far, so striding
across to the switchboard I switched on the "full defense."</p>

<p>'Stepping back quickly to the table I had a horrible and sickening
shock. The table had sunk quite unmistakably. Its top was within a
couple of feet of the floor, and the legs had that fore-shortened
appearance that one sees when a stick is thrust into water. They
looked vague and shadowy in the peculiar circle of dark shadows which
had such an extraordinary resemblance to the black mouth of a pit. I
could see only the top of the table plainly with Bains lying
motionless on it; and the whole thing was going down, as I stared,
into that black circle.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>'There was not a moment to lose, and like a flash I caught Bains
round his neck and body and lifted him clean up into my arms off the
table. And as I lifted him he grunted like a great swine in my
ear.</p>

<p>'The sound sent a thrill of horrible funk through me. It was just
as though I held a hog in my arms instead of a human. I nearly
dropped him. Then I held his face to the light and stared down at
him. His eyes were half opened, and he was looking at me apparently
as if he saw me perfectly.</p>

<p>'Then he grunted again. I could feel his small body quiver with
the sound.</p>

<p>'I called out to him. "Bains," I said, "can you hear me?"</p>

<p>'His eyes still gazed at me; and then, as we looked at each other,
he grunted like a swine again.</p>

<p>'I let go one hand, and hit him across the cheek, a stinging
slap.</p>

<p>'"Wake up, Bains!" I shouted. "Wake up!" But I might have hit a
corpse. He just stared up at me. And, suddenly I bent lower and
looked into his eyes more closely. I never saw such a fixed,
intelligent, mad horror as I saw there. It knocked out all my sudden
disgust. Can you understand?</p>

<p>'I glanced round quickly at the table. It stood there at its
normal height; and, indeed, it was in every way normal. The curious
shadow that had somehow suggested to me the black mouth of the pit
had vanished. I felt relieved; for it seemed to me that I had
entirely broken up any possibility of a partial "focus" by means of
the full "defense" which I had switched on.</p>

<p>'I laid Bains on the floor, and stood up to look round and
consider what was best to do. I dared not step outside of the
barriers, until any "dangerous tensions" there might be in the room
had been dissipated. Nor was it wise, even inside the full "defense,"
to have him sleeping the kind of sleep he was in; not without certain
preparations having been made first, which I had not made.</p>

<p>'I can tell you, I felt beastly anxious. I glanced down at Bains,
and had a sudden fresh shock; for the peculiar circular shadow was
forming all round him again, where he lay on the floor. His hands and
face showed curiously vague, and distorted, as they might have looked
through a few inches of faintly stained water. But his eyes were
somehow clear to see. They were staring up, mute and terrible, at me,
through that horrible darkening shadow.</p>

<p>'I stopped, and with one quick lift, tore him up off the floor
into my arms, and for the third time he grunted like a swine, there
in my arms. It was damnable.</p>

<p>'I stood up, in the barrier, holding Bains, and looked about the
room again; then back at the floor. The shadow was still thick round
about my feet, and I stepped quickly across to the other side of the
table. I stared at the shadow, and saw that it had vanished; then I
glanced down again at my feet, and had another shock; for the shadow
was showing faintly again, all round where I stood.</p>

<p>'I moved a pace, and watched the shadow become invisible; and
then, once more, like a slow stain, it began to grow about my
feet.</p>

<p>'I moved again, a pace, and stared round the room, meditating a
break for the door. And then, in that instant, I saw that this would
be certainly impossible; for there was something indefinite in the
atmosphere of the room--something that moved, circling slowly about
the barrier.</p>

<p>'I glanced down at my feet, and saw that the shadow had grown
thick about them. I stepped a pace to the right, and as it
disappeared, I stared again round the big room and somehow it seemed
tremendously big and unfamiliar. I wonder whether you can
understand.</p>

<p>'As I stared I saw again the indefinite something that floated in
the air of the room. I watched it steadily for maybe a minute. It
went twice completely round the barrier in that time. And, suddenly,
I saw it more distinctly. It looked like a small puff of black
smoke.</p>

<p>'And then I had something else to think about; for all at once I
was aware of an extraordinary feeling of vertigo, and in the same
moment, a sense of sinking--I was sinking bodily. I literally
sickened as I glanced down, for I saw in that moment that I had gone
down, almost up to my thighs into what appeared to be actually the
shadowy, but quite unmistakable, mouth of a pit. Do you under stand?
I was sinking down into this thing, with Bains in my arms.</p>

<p>'A feeling of furious anger came over me, and I swung my right
boot forward with a fierce kick. I kicked nothing tangible, for I
went clean through the side of the shadowy thing, and fetched up
against the table, with a crash. I had come through something that
made all my skin creep and tingle--an invisible, vague something
which resembled an electric tension. I felt that if it had been
stronger, I might not have been able to charge through as I had. I
wonder if I make it clear to you?</p>

<p>'I whirled round, but the beastly thing had gone; yet even as I
stood there by the table, the slow greying of a circular shadow began
to form again about my feet.</p>

<p>'I stepped to the other side of the table, and leaned against it
for a moment: for I was shaking from head to foot with a feeling of
extraordinary horror upon me, that was in some way, different from
any kind of horror I have ever felt. It was as if I had in that one
moment been near something no human has any right to be near, for his
soul's sake. And abruptly, I wondered whether I had not felt just one
brief touch of the horror that the rigid Bains was even then enduring
as I held him in my arms.</p>

<p>'Outside of the barrier there were now several of the curious
little clouds. Each one looked exactly like a little puff of black
smoke. They increased as I watched them, which I did for several
minutes; but all the time as I watched, I kept moving from one part
to another of the "defense", so as to prevent the shadow forming
round my feet again.</p>

<p>'Presently, I found that my constant changing of position had
resolved into a slow monotonous walk round and round, inside the
"defense"; and all the time I had to carry the unnaturally rigid body
of poor Bains.</p>

<p>'It began to tire me; for though he was small, his rigidity made
him dreadfully awkward and tiring to hold, as you can understand; yet
I could not think what else to do; for I had stopped shaking him, or
trying to wake him, for the simple reason that he was as wide awake
as I was mentally; though but physically inanimate, through one of
those partial spiritual disassociations which he had tried to explain
to me.</p>

<p>'Now I had previously switched out the red, orange, yellow and
green circles, and had on the full defense of the blue end of the
spectrum--I knew that one of the repelling vibrations of each of the
three colours: blue, indigo and violet were beating out protectingly
into space; yet they were proving insufficient, and I was in the
position of having either to take some desperate action to stimulate
Bains to an even greater effort of will than I judged him to be
making, or else to risk experimenting with fresh combinations of the
defensive colours.</p>

<p>'You see, as things were at that moment, the danger was increasing
steadily; for plainly, from the appearance of the air of the room
outside the barrier, there were some mighty dangerous tensions
generating. While inside the danger was also increasing; the steady
recurrence of the shadow proving that the "defense" was
insufficient.</p>

<p>'In short, I feared that Bains in his peculiar condition was
literally a "doorway" into the "defense"; and unless I could wake him
or find out the correct combinations of circles necessary to set up
stronger repelling vibrations against that particular danger, there
were very ugly possibilities ahead. I felt I had been incredibly rash
not to have foreseen the possibility of Bains falling asleep under
the hypnotic effect of deliberately paralleling the associations of
sleep.</p>

<p>'Unless I could increase the repulsion of the barriers or wake him
there was every likelihood of having to chose between a rush for the
door--which the condition of the atmosphere outside the barrier
showed to be practically impossible--or of throwing him outside the
barrier, which, of course, was equally not possible.</p>

<p>'All this time I was walking round and round inside the barrier,
when suddenly I saw a new development of the danger which threatened
us. Right in the centre of the "defense" the shadow had formed into
an intensely black circle, about a foot wide.</p>

<p>'This increased as I looked at it. It was horrible to see it grow.
It crept out in an ever widening circle till it was quite a yard
across.</p>

<p>'Quickly I put Bains on the floor. A tremendous attempt was
evidently going to be made by some outside force to enter the
"defense", and it was up to me to make a final effort to help Bains
to "wake up." I took out my lancet, and pushed up his left coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>'What I was going to do was a terrible risk, I knew, for there is
no doubt that in some extraordinary fashion blood attracts.</p>

<p>'The Sigsand mentions it particularly in one passage which runs
something like this: "In blood there is the Voice which calleth
through all space. Ye Monsters in ye Deep hear, and hearing, they
lust. Likewise hath it a greater power to reclaim backward ye soul
that doth wander foolish adrift from ye body in which it doth have
natural abiding. But woe unto him that doth spill ye blood in ye
deadly hour; for there will be surely Monsters that shall hear ye
Blood Cry."</p>

<p>'That risk I had to run. I knew that the blood would call to the
outer forces; but equally I knew that it should call even more loudly
to that portion of Bains' "Essence" that was adrift from him, down in
those depths.</p>

<p>'Before lancing him, I glanced at the shadow. It had spread out
until the nearest edge was not more than two feet away from Bains'
right shoulder; and the edge was creeping nearer, like the blackening
edge of burning paper, even while I stared. The whole thing had a
less shadowy, less ghostly appearance than at any time before. And it
looked simply and literally like the black mouth of a pit.</p>

<p>'"Now, Bains," I said, "pull yourself together, man. Wake up!" And
at the same time as I spoke to him, I used my lancet quickly but
superficially.</p>

<p>'I watched the little red spot of blood well up, then trickle
round his wrist and fall to the floor of the "defense". And in the
moment that it fell the thing that I had feared happened. There was a
sound like a low peal of thunder in the room, and curious
deadly-looking flashes of light rippled here and there along the
floor outside the barrier.</p>

<p>'Once more I called to him, trying to speak firmly and steadily as
I saw that the horrible shadowy circle had spread across every inch
of the floor space of the centre of the "defense", making it appear
as if both Bains and I were suspended above an unutterable black
void--the black void that stared up at me out of the throat of that
shadowy pit. And yet, all the time I could feel the floor solid under
my knees as I knelt beside Bains holding his wrist.</p>

<p>'"Bains!" I called once more, trying not to shout madly at him.
"Bains, wake up! Wake up, man! Wake up!"</p>

<p>'But he never moved, only stared up at me with eyes of quiet
horror that seemed to be looking at me out of some dreadful
eternity.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>'By this time the shadow had blackened all around us, and I felt
that strangely terrible vertigo coming over me again. Jumping to my
feet I caught up Bains in my arms and stepped over the first of the
protective circles--the violet, and stood between it and the indigo
circle, holding Bains as close to me as possible so as to prevent any
portion of his helpless body from protruding outside the indigo and
blue circles.</p>

<p>'From the black shadowy mouth which now filled the whole of the
centre of the "defense" there came a faint sound--not near but
seeming to come up at me out of unknown abysses. Very, very faint and
lost it sounded, but I recognised it as unmistakably the infinitely
remote murmur of countless swine.</p>

<p>'And that same moment Bains, as if answering the sound, grunted
like a swine in my arms.</p>

<p>'There I stood between the glass vacuum tubes of the circles,
gazing dizzily into that black shadowy pit-mouth, which seemed to
drop sheer into hell from below my left elbow.</p>

<p>'Things had gone so utterly beyond all that I had thought of, and
it had all somehow come about so gradually and yet so suddenly, that
I was really a bit below my natural self. I felt mentally paralysed,
and could think of nothing except that not twenty feet away was the
door and the outer natural world; and here was I face to face with
some unthought-of danger, and all adrift, what to do to avoid it.</p>

<p>'You fellows will understand this better when I tell you that the
bluish glare from the three circles showed me that there were now
hundreds and hundreds of those small smoke-like puffs of black cloud
circling round and round outside the barrier in an unvarying,
unending procession.</p>

<p>'And all the time I was holding the rigid body of Bains in my
arms, trying not to give way to the loathing that got me each time he
grunted. Every twenty or thirty seconds he grunted, as if in answer
to the sounds which were almost too faint for my normal hearing. I
can tell you, it was like holding something worse than a corpse in my
arms, standing there balanced between physical death on the one side
and soul destruction on the other.</p>

<p>'Abruptly, from out of the deep that lay so close that my elbow
and shoulder overhung it, there came again a hint, marvellously faint
murmur of swine, so utterly far away that the sound was as remote as
a lost echo.</p>

<p>'Bains answered it with a pig-like squeal that set every fibre in
me protesting in sheer human revolt, and I sweated coldly from head
to foot. Pulling myself together I tried to pierce down into the
mouth of the great shadow when, for the second time, a low peel of
thunder sounded in the room, and every joint in my body seemed to
jolt and burn.</p>

<p>'In turning to look down the pit I had allowed one of Bains' heels
to protrude for a moment slightly beyond the blue circle, and a
fraction of the "tension" outside the barrier had evidently
discharged through Bains and me. Had I been standing directly inside
the "defense" instead of being "insulated" from it by the violet
circle, then no doubt things might have been much more serious. As it
was, I had, psychically, that dreadful soiled feeling which the
healthy human always experiences when he comes too closely in contact
with certain Outer Monstrosities. Do you fellows remember how I had
just the same feeling when the Hand came too near me in the "Gateway"
case?</p>

<p>'The physical effects were sufficiently interesting to mention;
for Bains left boot had been ripped open, and the leg of his trousers
was charred to the knee, while all around the leg were numbers of
bluish marks in the form of irregular spirals.</p>

<p>'I stood there holding Bains, and shaking from head to foot. My
head ached and each joint had a queer numbish feeling; but my
physical pains were nothing compared with my mental distress. I felt
that we were done! I had no room to turn or move for the space
between the violet circle which was the innermost, and the blue
circle which was the outermost of those in use was thirty-one inches,
including the one inch of the indigo circle. So you see I was forced
to stand there like an image, fearing each moment lest I should get
another shock, and quite unable to think what to do.</p>

<p>'I daresay five minutes passed in this fashion. Bains had not
grunted once since the "tension" caught him, and for this I was just
simply thankful; though at first I must confess I had feared for a
moment that he was dead.</p>

<p>'No further sounds had come up out of the black mouth to my left,
and I grew steady enough again to begin to look about me, and think a
bit. I leant again so as to look directly down into the shadowy pit.
The edge of the circular mouth was now quite defined, and had a
curious solid look, as if it were formed out of some substance like
black glass.</p>

<p>'Below the edge, I could trace the appearance of solidity for a
considerable distance, though in a vague sort of way. The centre of
this extraordinary phenomenon was simple and unmitigated
blackness--an utter velvety blackness that seemed to soak the very
light out of the room down into it. I could see nothing else, and if
anything else came out of it except a complete silence, it was the
atmosphere of frightening suggestion that was affecting me more and
more every minute.</p>

<p>'I turned away slowly and carefully, so as not to run any risks of
allowing either Bains or myself to expose any part of us over the
blue circle. Then I saw that things outside of the blue circle had
developed considerably; for the odd, black puffs of smoke-like cloud
had increased enormously and blent into a great, gloomy, circular
wall of tufted cloud, going round and round and round eternally, and
hiding the rest of the room entirely from me.</p>

<p>'Perhaps a minute passed, while I stared at this thing; and then,
you know, the room was shaken slightly. This shaking lasted for three
or four seconds, and then passed; but it came again in about half a
minute, and was repeated from time to time. There was a queer
oscillating quality in the shaking, that made me think suddenly of
that Jarvee Haunting case. You remember it?</p>

<p>'There came again the shaking, and a ripple of deadly light seemed
to play round the outside of the barrier; and then, abruptly, the
room was full of a strange roaring--a brutish enormous yelling,
grunting storm of swine-sounds.</p>

<p>'They fell away into a complete silence, and the rigid Bains
grunted twice in my arms, as if answering. Then the storm of swine
noise came again, beating up in a gigantic riot of brute sound that
roared through the room, piping, squealing, grunting, and howling.
And as it sank with a steady declination, there came a single
gargantuan grunt out of some dreadful throat of monstrousness, and in
one beat, the crashing chorus of unknown millions of swine came
thundering and raging through the room again.</p>

<p>'There was more in that sound than mere chaos--there was a mighty
devilish rhythm in it. Suddenly, it swept down again into a
multitudinous swinish whispering and minor gruntings of unthinkable
millions; and then with a rolling deafening bellow of sound came the
single vast grunt. And, as if lifted upon it the swine roar of the
millions of the beasts beat up through the room again; and at every
seventh second, as I knew well enough without the need of the watch
on my wrist, came the single storm beat of the great grunt out of the
throat of unknowable monstrosity--and in my arms, Bains, the human,
grunted in time to the swine melody--a rigid grunting monster there
in my two arms.</p>

<p>'I tell you from head to foot I shook and sweated. I believe I
prayed; but if I did I don't know what I prayed. I have never before
felt or endured just what I felt, standing there in that
thirty-one-inch space, with that grunting thing in my arms, and the
hell melody beating up out of the great Deeps: and to my right,
"tensions" that would have torn me into a bundle of blazing tattered
flesh, if I had jumped out over the barriers.</p>

<p>'And then, with an effect like a clap of unexpected thunder, the
vast storm of sound ceased; and the room was full of silence and an
unimaginable horror.</p>

<p>'This silence continued. I want to say something which may sound a
bit silly; but the silence seemed to trickle round the room. I don't
know why I felt it like that; but my words give you just what I
seemed to feel, as I stood there holding the softly grunting body of
Bains.</p>

<p>'The circular, gloomy wall of dense black cloud enclosed the
barrier as completely as ever, and moved round and round and round,
with a slow, "eternal" movement. And at the back of that black wall
of circling cloud, a dead silence went trickling round the room, out
of my sight. Do you understand at all?...</p>

<p>'It seemed to me to show very clearly the state of almost insane
mental and psychic tension I was enduring.... The way in which my
brain insisted that the silence was trickling round the room,
interests me enormously; for I was either in a state approximating a
phase of madness, or else I was, psychically, tuned to some abnormal
pitch of awaredness and sensitiveness in which silence had ceased to
be an abstract quality, and had become to me a definite concrete
element, much as (to use a stupidly crude illustration), the
invisible moisture of the atmosphere becomes a visible and concrete
element when it becomes deposited as water. I wonder whether this
thought attracts you as it does me?</p>

<p>'And then, you know, a slow awaredness grew in me of some further
horror to come. This sensation or knowledge or whatever it should be
named, was so strong that I had a sudden feeling of suffocation.... I
felt that I could bear no more; and that if anything else happened, I
should just pull out my revolver and shoot Bains through the head,
and then myself, and so end the whole dreadful business.</p>

<p>'This feeling, however, soon passed; and I felt stronger and more
ready to face things again. Also, I had the first, though still
indefinite, idea of a way in which to make things a bit safer; but I
was too dazed to see how to "shape" to help myself efficiently.</p>

<p>'And then a low, far-off whining stole up into the room, and I
knew that the danger was coming. I leant slowly to my left, taking
care not to let Bains' feet stick over the blue circle, and stared
down into the blackness of the pit that dropped sheer into some
Unknown, from under my left elbow.</p>

<p>'The whining died; but far down in the blackness, there was
something--just a remote luminous spot. I stood in a grim silence for
maybe ten long minutes, and looked down at the thing. It was
increasing in size all the time, and had become much plainer to see;
yet it was still lost in the far, tremendous Deep.</p>

<p>'Then, as I stood and looked, the low whining sound crept up to me
again, and Bains, who had lain like a log in my arms all the time,
answered it with a long animallike whine, that was somehow newly
abominable.</p>

<p>'A very curious thing happened then; for all around the edge of
the pit, that looked so peculiarly like black glass, there came a
sudden, luminous glowing. It came and went oddly, smouldering queerly
round and round the edge in an opposite direction to the circling of
the wall of black, tufted cloud on the outside of the barrier.</p>

<p>'This peculiar glowing finally disappeared, and, abruptly, out of
the tremendous Deep, I was conscious of a dreadful quality or
"atmosphere" of monstrousness that was coming up out of the pit. If I
said there had been a sudden waft of it, this would very well
describe the actuality of it; but the spiritual sickness of distress
that it caused me to feel, I am simply stumped to explain to you. It
was something that made me feel I should be soiled to the very core
of me, if I did not beat it off from me with my will.</p>

<p>'I leant sharply away from the pit towards the outer of the
burning circles. I meant to see that no part of my body should
overhang the pit whilst that disgusting power was beating up out of
the unknown depths.</p>

<p>'And thus it was, facing so rigidly away from the centre of the
"defense", I saw presently a fresh thing; for there was something,
many things, I began to think, on the other side of the gloomy wall
that moved everlastingly around the outside of the barrier.</p>

<p>'The first thing I noticed was a queer disturbance of the ever
circling cloud-wall. This disturbance was within eighteen inches of
the floor, and directly before me. There was a curious, "puddling"
action in the misty wall; as if something were meddling with it. The
area of this peculiar little disturbance could not have been more
than a foot across, and it did not remain opposite to me; but was
taken round by the circling of the wall.</p>

<p>'When it came past me again, I noticed that it was bulging
slightly inwards towards me: and as it moved away from me once more,
I saw another similar disturbance, and then a third and a fourth, all
in different parts of the slowly whirling black wall; and all of them
were no more than about eighteen inches from the floor.</p>

<p>'When the first one came opposite me again, I saw that the slight
bulge had grown into a very distinct protuberance towards me.</p>

<p>'All around the moving wall, there had now come these curious
swellings. They continued to reach inwards, and to elongate; and all
the time they kept in a constant movement.</p>

<p>'Suddenly, one of them broke, or opened, at the apex, and there
protruded through, for an instant, the tip of a pallid, but
unmistakable snout. It was gone at once, but I had seen the thing
distinctly; and within a minute, I saw another one poke suddenly
through the wall, to my right, and withdraw as quickly. I could not
look at the base of the strange, black, moving circle about the
barrier without seeing a swinish snout peep through momentarily, in
this place or that.</p>

<p>'I stared at these things in a very peculiar state of mind. There
was so great a weight of the abnormal about me, before and behind and
every way, that to a certain extent it bred in me a sort of antidote
to fear. Can you understand? It produced in me a temporary dazedness
in which things and the horror of things became less real. I stared
at them, as a child stares out from a fast train at a quickly passing
night-landscape, oddly hit by the furnaces of unknown industries. I
want you to try to understand.</p>

<p>'In my arms Bains lay quiet and rigid; and my arms and back ached
until I was one dull ache in all my body; but I was only partly
conscious of this when I roused momentarily from my psychic to my
physical awaredness, to shift him to another position, less
intolerable temporarily to my tired arms and back.</p>

<p>'There was suddenly a fresh thing--a low but enormous, solitary
grunt came rolling, vast and brutal into the room. It made the still
body of Bains quiver against me, and he grunted thrice in return,
with the voice of a young pig.</p>

<p>'High up in the moving wall of the barrier, I saw a fluffing out
of the black tufted clouds; and a pig's hoof and leg, as far as the
knuckle, came through and pawed a moment. This was about nine or ten
feet above the floor. As it gradually disappeared I heard a low
grunting from the other side of the veil of clouds which broke out
suddenly into a diafaeon of brute-sound, grunting, squealing and
swine-howling; all formed into a sound that was the essential melody
of the brute--a grunting, squealing howling roar that rose, roar by
roar, howl by howl and squeal by squeal to a crescendo of
horrors--the bestial growths, longings, zests and acts of some grotto
of hell.... It is no use, I can't give it to you. I get dumb with the
failure of my command over speech to tell you what that grunting,
howling, roaring melody conveyed to me. It had in it something so
inexplicably below the horizons of the soul in its monstrousness and
fearfulness that the ordinary simple fear of death itself, with all
its attendant agonies and terrors and sorrows, seemed like a thought
of something peaceful and infinitely holy compared with the fear of
those unknown elements in that dreadful roaring melody. And the sound
was with me inside the room--there right in the room with me. Yet I
seemed not to be aware of confining walls, but of echoing spaces of
gargantuan corridors. Curious! I had in my mind those two
words--gargantuan corridors.</p>

<p>As the rolling chaos of swine melody beat itself away on every
side, there came booming through it a single grunt, the single
recurring grunt of the HOG; for I knew now that I was actually and
without any doubt hearing the beat of monstrosity, the HOG.</p>

<p>'In the Sigsand the thing is described something like this: "Ye
Hogge which ye Almighty alone hath power upon. If in sleep or in ye
hour of danger ye hear the voice of ye Hogge, cease ye to meddle. For
ye Hogge doth be of ye outer Monstrous Ones, nor shall any human come
nigh him nor continue meddling when ye hear his voice, for in ye
earlier life upon the world did the Hogge have power, and shall again
in ye end. And in that ye Hogge had once a power upon ye earth, so
doth he crave sore to come again. And dreadful shall be ye harm to ye
soul if ye continue to meddle, and to let ye beast come nigh. And I
say unto all, if ye have brought this dire danger upon ye, have
memory of ye cross, for of all sign hath ye Hogge a horror."</p>

<p>'There's a lot more, but I can't remember it all and that is about
the substance of it.</p>

<p>'There was I holding Bains who was all the time howling that
dreadful grunt out with the voice of a swine. I wonder I didn't go
mad. It was, I believe, the antidote of dazedness produced by the
strain which helped me through each moment.</p>

<p>'A minute later, or perhaps five minutes, I had a sudden new
sensation, like a warning cutting through my dulled feelings. I
turned my head; but there was nothing behind me, and bending over to
my left I seemed to be looking down into that black depth which fell
away sheer under my left elbow. At that moment the roaring bellow of
swine-noise ceased and I seemed to be staring down into miles of
black aether at something that hung there--a pallid face floating far
down and remote--a great swine face.</p>

<p>'And as I gazed I saw it grow bigger. A seemingly motionless,
pallid swine-face rising upward out of the depth. And suddenly I
realised that I was actually looking at the Hog.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>'For perhaps a full minute I stared down through the darkness at
that thing swimming like some far-off, deadwhite planet in the
stupendous void. And then I simply woke up bang, as you might say, to
the possession of my faculties. For just a certain over-degree of
strain had brought about the dumbly helpful anaesthesia of dazedness,
so this sudden overwhelming supreme fact of horror produced, in turn,
its reaction from inertness to action. I passed in one moment from
listlessness to a fierce efficiency.</p>

<p>'I knew that I had, through some accident, penetrated beyond all
previous "bounds", and that I stood where no human soul had any right
to be, and that in but a few of the puny minutes of earth's time I
might be dead.</p>

<p>'Whether Bains had passed beyond the "lines of retraction" or not,
I could not tell. I put him down carefully but quickly on his side,
between the inner circles--that is, the violet circle and the indigo
circle--where he lay grunting slowly. Feeling that the dreadful
moment had come I drew out my automatic. It seemed best to make sure
of our end before that thing in the depth came any nearer: for once
Bains in his present condition came within what I might term the
"inductive forces" of the monster, he would cease to be human. There
would happen, as in that case of Aster who stayed outside the
pentacles in the Black Veil Case, what can only be described as a
pathological, spiritual change--literally in other words, soul
destruction.</p>

<p>'And then something seemed to be telling me not to shoot. This
sounds perhaps a bit superstitious; but I meant to kill Bains in that
moment, and what stopped me was a distinct message from the
outside.</p>

<p>'I tell you, it sent a great thrill of hope through me, for I knew
that the forces which govern the spinning of the outer circle were
intervening. But the very fact of the intervention proved to me
afresh the enormous spiritual peril into which we had stumbled; for
that inscrutable Protective Force only intervenes between the human
soul and the Outer Monstrosities.</p>

<p>'The moment I received that message I stood up like a flash and
turned towards the pit, stepping over the violet circle slap into the
mouth of darkness. I had to take the risk in order to get at the
switch board which lay on the glass shelf under the table top in the
centre. I could not shake free from the horror of the idea that I
might fall down through that awful blackness. The floor felt solid
enough under me; but I seemed to be walking on nothing above a black
void, like an inverted starless night, with the face of the
approaching Hog rising up from far down under my feet--a silent,
incredible thing out of the abyss--a pallid, floating swine-face,
framed in enormous blackness.</p>

<p>'Two quick, nervous strides took me to the table standing there in
the centre with its glass legs apparently resting on nothing. I
grabbed out the switch board, sliding out the vulcanite plate which
carried the switch-control of the blue circle. The battery which fed
this circle was the right-hand one of the row of seven, and each
battery was marked with the letter of its circle painted on it, so
that in an emergency I could select any particular battery in a
moment.</p>

<p>'As I snatched up the B switch I had a grim enough warning of the
unknown dangers that I was risking in that short journey of two
steps; for that dreadful sense of vertigo returned suddenly and for
one horrible moment I saw everything through a blurred medium as if I
were trying to look through water.</p>

<p>'Below me, far away down between my feet I could see the Hog
which, in some peculiar way, looked different dearer and much nearer,
and enormous. I felt it had got nearer to me all in a moment. And
suddenly I had the impression I was descending bodily.</p>

<p>'I had a sense of a tremendous force being used to push me over
the side of that pit, but with every shred of will power I had in me
I hurled myself into the smoky appearance that hid everything and
reached the violet circle where Bains lay in front of me.</p>

<p>'Here I crouched down on my heels, and with my two arms out before
me I slipped the nails of each forefinger under the vulcanite base of
the blue circle, which I lifted very gently so that when the base was
far enough from the floor I could push the tips of my fingers
underneath. I took care to keep from reaching farther under than the
inner edge of the glowing tube which rested on the two-inch-broad
foundation of vulcanite.</p>

<p>'Very slowly I stood upright, lifting the side of the blue circle
with me. My feet were between the indigo and the violet circles, and
only the blue circle between me and sudden death; for if it had
snapped with the unusual strain I was putting upon it by lifting it
like that, I knew that I should in all probability go west pretty
quickly.</p>

<p>'So you fellows can imagine what I felt like. I was conscious of a
disagreeable faint prickling that was strongest in the tips of my
fingers and wrists, and the blue circle seemed to vibrate strangely
as if minute particles of something were impinging upon it in
countless millions. Along the shining glass tubes for a couple of
feet on each side of my hands a queer haze of tiny sparks boiled and
whirled in the form of an extraordinary halo.</p>

<p>'Stepping forward over the indigo circle I pushed the blue circle
out against the slowly moving wall of black cloud causing a ripple of
tiny pale flashes to curl in over the circle. These flashes ran along
the vacuum tube until they came to the place where the blue circle
crossed the indigo, and there they flicked off into space with sharp
cracks of sound.</p>

<p>'As I advanced slowly and carefully with the blue circle a most
extraordinary thing happened, for the moving wall of cloud gave from
it in a great belly of shadow, and appeared to thin away from before
it. Lowering my edge of the circle to the floor I stepped over Bains
and right into the mouth of the pit, lifting the other side of the
circle over the table. It creaked as if it were about to break in
half as I lifted it, but eventually it came over safely.</p>

<p>'When I looked again into the depth of that shadow I saw below me
the dreadful pallid head of the Hog floating in a circle of night. It
struck me that it glowed very slightly--just a vague luminosity. And
quite near--comparatively. No one could have judged distances in that
black void.</p>

<p>'Picking up the edge of the blue circle again as I had done
before, I took it out further till it was half clear of the indigo
circle. Then I picked up Bains and carried him to that portion of the
floor guarded by the part of the blue circle which was clear of the
"defense". Then I lifted the circle and started to move it forward as
quickly as I dared, shivering each time the joints squeaked as the
whole fabric of it groaned with the strain I was putting upon it. And
all the time the moving wall of tufted clouds gave from the edge of
the blue circle, bellying away from it in a marvellous fashion as if
blown by an unheard wind.</p>

<p>'From time to time little flashes of light had begun to flick in
over the blue circle, and I began to wonder whether it would be able
to hold out the "tension" until I had dragged it clear of the
defense.</p>

<p>'Once it was clear I hoped the abnormal stress would cease from
about us, and concentrate chiefly around the "defense" again, and the
attractions of the negative "tension."</p>

<p>'Just then I heard a sharp tap behind me, and the blue circle
jarred somewhat, having now ridden completely over the violet and
indigo circles, and dropped clear on to the floor. The same instant
there came a low rolling noise as of thunder, and a curious roaring.
The black circling wall had thinned away from around us and the room
showed clearly once more, yet nothing was to be seen except that now
and then a peculiar bluish flicker of light would ripple across the
floor.</p>

<p>'Turning to look at the "defense" I noticed it was surrounded by
the circling wall of black cloud, and looked strangely extraordinary
seen from the outside. It resembled a slightly swaying squat funnel
of whirling black mist reaching from the floor to the ceiling, and
through it I could see glowing, sometimes vague and sometimes plain,
the indigo and violet circles. And then as I watched, the whole room
seemed suddenly filled with an awful presence which pressed upon me
with a weight of horror that was the very essence of spiritual
deathliness.</p>

<p>'Kneeling there in the blue circle by Bains, my initiative
faculties stupefied and temporarily paralysed, I could form no
further plan of escape, and indeed I seemed to care for nothing at
the moment. I felt I had already escaped from immediate destruction
and I was strung up to an amazing pitch of indifference to any minor
horrors.</p>

<p>'Bains all this while had been quietly lying on his side. I rolled
him over and looked closely at his eyes, taking care on account of
his condition not to gaze into them; for if he had passed beyond the
"line of retraction" he would be dangerous. I mean, if the
"wandering" part of his essence had been assimilated by the Hog, then
Bains would be spiritually accessible and might be even then no more
than the outer form of the man, charged with radiation of the
monstrous ego of the Hog, and therefore capable of what I might term
for want of a more exact phrase, a psychically infective force; such
force being more readily transmitted through the eyes than any other
way, and capable of producing a brain storm of an extremely dangerous
character.</p>

<p>'I found Bains, however, with both eyes with an extraordinary
distressed interned quality; not the eyeballs, remember, but a reflex
action transmitted from the "mental eye" to the physical eye, and
giving to the physical eye an expression of thought instead of sight.
I wonder whether I make this clear to you?</p>

<p>'Abruptly, from every part of the room there broke out the noise
of those hoofs again, making the place echo with the sound as if a
thousand swine had started suddenly from an absolute immobility into
a mad charge. The whole riot of animal sound seemed to heave itself
in one wave towards the oddly swaying and circling funnel of black
cloud which rose from floor to ceiling around the violet and indigo
circles.</p>

<p>'As the sounds ceased I saw something was rising up through the
middle of the "defense". It rose with a slow steady movement. I saw
it pale and huge through the swaying, whirling funnel of cloud--a
monstrous pallid snout rising out of that unknowable abyss.... It
rose higher like a huge pale mound. Through a thinning of the cloud
curtain I saw one small eye.... I shall never see a pig's eye again
without feeling something of what I felt then. A pig's eye with a
sort of hell-light of vile understanding shining at the back of
it.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>"And then suddenly a dreadful terror came over me, for I saw the
beginning of the end that I had been dreading all along--I saw
through the slow whirl of the cloud curtains that the violet circle
had begun to leave the floor. It was being taken up on the spread of
the vast snout."</p>

<p>'Straining my eyes to see through the swaying funnel of clouds I
saw that the violet circle had melted and was running down the pale
sides of the snout in streams of violet-coloured fire. And as it
melted there came a change in the atmosphere of the room. The black
funnel shone with a dull gloomy red, and a heavy red glow filled the
room.</p>

<p>'The change was such as one might experience if one had been
looking through a protective glass at some light and the glass had
been suddenly removed. But there was a further change that I realised
directly through my feelings. It was as if the horrible presence in
the room had come closer to my own soul. I wonder if I am making it
at all clear to you. Before, it had oppressed me somewhat as a death
on a very gloomy and dreary day beats down upon one's spirit. But now
there was a savage menace, and the actual feeling of a foul thing
close up against me. It was horrible, simply horrible.</p>

<p>'And then Bains moved. For the first time since he went to sleep
the rigidity went out of him, and rolling suddenly over on to his
stomach he fumbled up in a curious animallike fashion, on to his
hands and feet. Then he charged straight across the blue circle
towards the thing in the "defense".</p>

<p>'With a shriek I jumped to pull him back; but it was not my voice
that stopped him. It was the blue circle. It made him give back from
it as though some invisible hand had jerked him backwards. He threw
up his head like a hog, squealing with the voice of a swine, and
started off round the inside of the blue circle. Round and round it
he went, twice attempting to bolt across it to the horror in that
swaying funnel of cloud. Each time he was thrown back, and each time
he squealed like a great swine, the sounds echoing round the room in
a horrible fashion as though they came from somewhere a long way
off.</p>

<p>'By this time I was fairly sure that Bains had indeed passed the
"line of retraction", and the knowledge brought a fresh and more
hopeless horror and pity to me, and a grimmer fear for myself. I knew
that if it were so, it was not Bains I had with me in the circle but
a monster, and that for my own last chance of safety I should have to
get him outside of the circle.</p>

<p>'He had ceased his tireless running round and round, and now lay
on his side grunting continually and softly in a dismal kind of way.
As the slowly whirling clouds thinned a little I saw again that
pallid face with some clearness. It was still rising, but slowly,
very slowly, and again a hope grew in me that it might be checked by
the "defense". Quite plainly I saw that the horror was looking at
Bains, and at that moment I saved my own life and soul by looking
down. There, close to me on the floor was the thing that looked like
Bains, its hands stretched out to grip my ankles. Another second, and
I should have been tripped outwards. Do you realise what that would
have meant?</p>

<p>'It was no time to hesitate. I simply jumped and came down crash
with my knees on top of Bains. He lay quiet enough after a short
struggle; but I took off my braces and lashed his hands up behind
him. And I shivered with the very touch of him, as though I was
touching something monstrous.</p>

<p>'By the time I had finished I noticed that the reddish glow in the
room had deepened quite considerably, and the whole room was darker.
The destruction of the violet circle had reduced the light
perceptibly; but the darkness that I am speaking of was something
more than that. It seemed as if something now had come into the
atmosphere of the room--a sort of gloom, and in spite of the shining
of the blue circle and the indigo circle inside the funnel of cloud,
there was now more red light than anything else.</p>

<p>'Opposite me the huge, cloud-shrouded monster in the indigo circle
appeared to be motionless. I could see its outline vaguely all the
time, and only when the cloud funnel thinned could I see it
plainly--a vast, snouted mound, faintly and whitely luminous, one
gargantuan side turned towards me, and near the base of the slope a
minute slit out of which shone one whitish eye.</p>

<p>'Presently through the thin gloomy red vapour I saw something that
killed the hope in me, and gave me a horrible despair; for the indigo
circle, the final barrier of the defense, was being slowly lifted
into the air--the Hog had begun to rise higher. I could see its
dreadful snout rising upwards out of the cloud. Slowly, very slowly,
the snout rose up, and the indigo circle went up with it.</p>

<p>'In the dead stillness of that room I got a strange sense that all
eternity was tense and utterly still as if certain powers knew of
this horror I had brought into the world.... And then I had an
awareness of something coming... something from far, far away. It was
as if some hidden unknown part of my brain knew it. Can you
understand? There was somewhere in the heights of space a light that
was coming near. I seemed to hear it coming. I could just see the
body of Bains on the floor, huddled and shapeless and inert. Within
the swaying veil of cloud the monster showed as a vast pale, faintly
luminous mound, hugely snouted--an infernal hillock of monstrosity,
pallid and deadly amid the redness that hung in the atmosphere of the
room.</p>

<p>'Something told me that it was making a final effort against the
help that was coming. I saw the indigo circle was now some inches
from the floor, and every moment I expected to see it flash into
streams of indigo fire running down the pale slopes of the snout. I
could see the circle beginning to move upward at a perceptible speed.
The monster was triumphing.</p>

<p>'Out in some realm of space a low continuous thunder sounded. The
thing in the great heights was coming fast, but it could never come
in time. The thunder grew from a low, far mutter into a deep steady
rolling of sound.... It grew louder and louder, and as it grew I saw
the indigo circle, now shining through the red gloom of the room, was
a whole foot off the floor. I thought I saw a faint splutter of
indigo light.... The final circle of the barrier was beginning to
melt.</p>

<p>'That instant the thunder of the thing in flight which my brain
heard so plainly, rose into a crashing, a worldshaking bellow of
speed, making the room rock and vibrate to an immensity of sound. A
strange flash of blue flame ripped open the funnel of cloud
momentarily from top to base, and I saw for one brief instant the
pallid monstrosity of the Hog, stark and pale and dreadful.</p>

<p>'Then the sides of the funnel joined again hiding the thing from
me as the funnel became submerged quickly into a dome of silent blue
light--God's own colour! All at once it seemed the cloud had gone,
and from floor to ceiling of the room, in awful majesty, like a
living Presence, there appeared that dome of blue fire banded with
three rings of green light at equal distances. There was no sound or
movement, not even a flicker, nor could I see anything in the light:
for looking into it was like looking into the cold blue of the skies.
But I felt sure that there had come to our aid one of those
inscrutable forces which govern the spinning of the outer circle, for
the dome of blue light, banded with three green bands of silent fire,
was the outward or visible sign of an enormous force, undoubtedly of
a defensive nature.</p>

<p>'Through ten minutes of absolute silence I stood there in the blue
circle watching the phenomenon. Minute by minute I saw the heavy
repellent red driven out of the room as the place lightened quite
noticeably. And as it lightened, the body of Bains began to resolve
out of a shapeless length of shadow, detail by detail, until I could
see the braces with which I had lashed his wrists together.</p>

<p>'And as I looked at him his body moved slightly, and in a weak but
perfectly sane voice he said:</p>

<p>'"I've had it again! My God! I've had it again!"'</p>

<p>--7--</p>

<p>'I knelt down quickly by his side and loosened the braces from his
wrists, helping him to turn over and sit up. He gripped my arm a
little crazily with both hands.</p>

<p>'"I went to sleep after all," he said. "And I've been down there
again. My God! It nearly had me. I was down in that awful place and
it seemed to be just round a great corner, and I was stopped from
coming back. I seemed to have been fighting for ages and ages. I felt
I was going mad. Mad! I've been nearly down into a hell. I could hear
you calling down to me from some awful height. I could hear your
voice echoing along yellow passages. They were yellow. I know they
were. And I tried to come and I couldn't."</p>

<p>'"Did you see me?" I asked him when he stopped, gasping.</p>

<p>'"No," he answered, leaning his head against my shoulder. "I tell
you it nearly got me that time. I shall never dare go to sleep again
as long as I live. Why didn't you wake me?"</p>

<p>'"I did," I told him. "I had you in my arms most of the time. You
kept looking up into my eyes as if you knew I was there."</p>

<p>'"I know," he said. "I remember now; but you seemed to be up at
the top of a frightful hole, miles and miles up from me, and those
horrors were grunting and squealing and howling, and trying to catch
me and keep me down there. But I couldn't see anything--only the
yellow walls of those passages. And all the time there was something
round the corner."</p>

<p>'"Anyway, you're safe enough now," I told him. "And I'll guarantee
you shall be safe in the future."</p>

<p>'The room had grown dark save for the light from the blue circle.
The dome had disappeared, the whirling funnel of black cloud had
gone, the Hog had gone, and the light had died out of the indigo
circle. And the atmosphere of the room was safe and normal again as I
proved by moving the switch, which was near me, so as to lessen the
defensive power of the blue circle and enable me to "feel" the
outside tension. Then I turned to Bains.</p>

<p>'"Come along," I said. "We'll go and get something to eat, and
have a rest."</p>

<p>'But Bains was already sleeping like a tired child, his head
pillowed on his hand. "Poor little devil!" I said as I picked him up
in my arms. "Poor little devil!"</p>

<p>'I walked across to the main switchboard and threw over the
current so as to throw the "V" protective pulse out of the four walls
and the door; then I carried Bains out into the sweet wholesome
normality of everything. It seemed wonderful, coming out of that
chamber of horrors, and it seemed wonderful still to see my bedroom
door opposite, wide open, with the bed looking so soft and white as
usual--so ordinary and human. Can you chaps understand?</p>

<p>'I carried Bains into the room and put him on the couch; and then
it was I realised how much I'd been up against, for when I was
getting myself a drink I dropped the bottle and had to get
another.</p>

<p>'After I had made Bains drink a glass I laid him on the bed.</p>

<p>'"Now," I said, "look into my eyes fixedly. Do you hear me? You
are going off to sleep safely and soundly, and if anything troubles
you, obey me and wake up. Now, sleep--sleep--sleep!"</p>

<p>'I swept my hands down over his eyes half a dozen times, and he
fell over like a child. I knew that if the danger came again he would
obey my will and wake up. I intend to cure him, partly by hypnotic
suggestion, partly by a certain electrical treatment which I am
getting Doctor Witton to give him.</p>

<p>'That night I slept on the couch, and when I went to look at Bains
in the morning I found him still sleeping, so leaving him there I
went into the test room to examine results. I found them very
surprising.</p>

<p>'Inside the room I had a queer feeling, as you can imagine. It was
extraordinary to stand there in that curious bluish light from the
"treated" windows, and see the blue circle lying, still glowing,
where I had left it; and further on, the "defense", lying circle
within circle, all "out"; and in the centre the glass-legged table
standing where a few hours before it had been submerged in the
horrible monstrosity of the Hog. I tell you, it all seemed like a
wild and horrible dream as I stood there and looked. I have carried
out some curious tests in there before now, as you know, but I've
never come nearer to a catastrophe.</p>

<p>'I left the door open so as not to feel shut in, and then I walked
over to the "defense". I was intensely curious to see what had
happened physically under the action of such a force as the Hog. I
found unmistakable signs that proved the thing had been indeed a
Saaitii manifestation, for there had been no psychic or physical
illusion about the melting of the violet circle. There remained
nothing of it except a ring of patches of melted glass. The gutta
base had been fused entirely, but the floor and everything was
intact. You see, the Saaitii forms can often attack and destroy, or
even make use of, the very defensive material used against them.</p>

<p>'Stepping over the outer circle and looking closely at the indigo
circle I saw that it was melted clean through in several places.
Another fraction of time and the Hog would have been free to expand
as an invisible mist of horror and destruction into the atmosphere of
the world. And then, in that very moment of time, salvation had come.
I wonder if you can get my feelings as I stood there staring down at
the destroyed barrier.'</p>

<p>Carnacki began to knock out his pipe which is always a sign that
he has ended his tale, and is ready to answer any questions we may
want to ask.</p>

<p>Taylor was first in. 'Why didn't you use the Electric Pentacle as
well as your new spectrum circles?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Because,' replied Carnacki, 'the pentacle is simply "defensive"
and I wished to have the power to make a "focus" during the early
part of the experiment, and then, at the critical moment, to change
the combination of the colours so as to have a "defense" against the
results of the "focus". You follow me.</p>

<p>'You see,' he went on, seeing we hadn't grasped his meaning,
'there can be no "focus" within a pentacle. It is just of a
"defensive" nature. Even if I had switched the current out of the
electric pentacle I should still have had to contend with the
peculiar and undoubtedly "defensive" power that its form seems to
exert, and this would have been sufficient to "blur" the focus.</p>

<p>'In this new research work I'm doing, I'm bound to use a "focus"
and so the pentacle is barred. But I'm not sure it matters. I'm
convinced this new spectrum "defense" of mine will prove absolutely
invulnerable when I've learnt how to use it; but it will take me some
time. This last case has taught me something new. I had never thought
of combining green with blue; but the three bands of green in the
blue of that dome has set me thinking. If only I knew the right
combinations! It's the combinations I've got to learn. You'll
understand better the importance of these combinations when I remind
you that green by itself is, in a very limited way, more deadly than
red itself--and red is the danger colour of all.'</p>

<p>'Tell us, Carnacki,' I said, 'what is the Hog? Can you? I mean
what kind of monstrosity is it? Did you really see it, or was it all
some horrible, dangerous kind of dream? How do you know it was one of
the outer monsters? And what is the difference between that sort of
danger and the sort of thing you saw in the Gateway of the Monster
case? And what....?'</p>

<p>'Steady!' laughed Carnacki. 'One at a time! I'll answer all your
questions; but I don't think I'll take them quite in your order. For
instance, speaking about actually seeing the Hog, I might say that,
speaking generally, things seen of a "ghostly" nature are not seen
with the eyes; they are seen with the mental eye which has this
psychic quality, not always developed to a useable state, in addition
to its "normal" duty of revealing to the brain what our physical eyes
record.</p>

<p>'You will understand that when we see "ghostly" things it is often
the "mental" eye performing simultaneously the duty of revealing to
the brain what the physical eye sees as well as what it sees itself.
The two sights blending their functions in such a fashion gives us
the impression that we are actually seeing through our physical eyes
the whole of the "sight" that is being revealed to the brain.</p>

<p>'In this way we get an impression of seeing with our physical eyes
both the material and the immaterial parts of an "abnormal" scene;
for each part being received and revealed to the brain by machinery
suitable to the particular purpose appears to have equal value of
reality that is, it appears to be equally material. Do you follow
me?'</p>

<p>We nodded our assent, and Carnacki continued:</p>

<p>'In the same way, were anything to threaten our psychic body we
should have the impression, generally speaking, that it was our
physical body that had been threatened, because our psychic
sensations and impressions would be super-imposed upon our physical,
in the same way that our psychic and our physical sight are
super-imposed.</p>

<p>'Our sensations would blend in such a way that it would be
impossible to differentiate between what we felt physically and what
we felt psychically. To explain better what I mean. A man may seem to
himself, in a "ghostly" adventure, to fall actually. That is, to be
falling in a physical sense; but all the while it may be his psychic
entity, or being--call it what you will--that is falling. But to his
brain there is presented the sensation of falling all together. Do
you get me?</p>

<p>'At the same time, please remember that the danger is none the
less because it is his psychic body that falls. I am referring to the
sensation I had of falling during the time of stepping across the
mouth of that pit. My physical body could walk over it easily and
feel the floor solid under me; but my psychic body was in very real
danger of falling. Indeed, I may be said to have literally carried my
psychic body over, held within me by the pull of my lifeforce. You
see, to my psychic body the pit was as real and as actual as a coal
pit would have been to my physical body. It was merely the pull of my
life-force which prevented my psychic body from falling out of me,
rather like a plummet, down through the everlasting depths in
obedience to the giant pull of the monster.</p>

<p>'As you will remember, the pull of the Hog was too great for my
life-force to withstand, and, psychically, I began to fall.
Immediately on my brain was recorded a sensation identical with that
which would have been recorded on it had my actual physical body been
falling. It was a mad risk I took, but as you know, I had to take it
to get to the switch and the battery. When I had that physical sense
of falling and seemed to see the black misty sides of the pit all
around me, it was my mental eye recording upon the brain what it was
seeing. My psychic body had actually begun to fall and was really
below the edge of the pit but still in contact with me. In other
words my physical magnetic and psychic "haloes" were still mingled.
My physical body was still standing firmly upon the floor of the
room, but if I had not each time by effort or will forced my physical
body across to the side, my psychic body would have fallen completely
out of "contact" with me, and gone like some ghostly meteorite,
obedient to the pull of the Hog.</p>

<p>'The curious sensation I had of forcing myself through an
obstructing medium was not a physical sensation at all, as we
understand that word, but rather the psychric sensation of forcing my
entity to re-cross the "gap" that had already formed between my
falling psychic body now below the edge of the pit and my physical
body standing on the floor of the room. And that "gap" was full of a
force that strove to prevent my body and soul from rejoining. It was
a terrible experience. Do you remember how I could still see with my
brain through the eyes of my psychic body, though it had already
fallen some distance out of me? That is an extraordinary thing to
remember.</p>

<p>'However, to get ahead, all "ghostly" phenomena are extremely
diffuse in a normal state. They become actively physically dangerous
in all cases where they are concentrated. The best off-hand
illustration I can think of is the all-familiar electricity--a force
which, by the way, we are too prone to imagine we understand because
we've named and harnessed it, to use a popular phrase. But we don't
understand it at all! It is still a complete fundamental mystery.
Well, electricity when diffused is an "imagined and unpictured
something", but when concentrated it is sudden death. Have you got me
in that?</p>

<p>'Take, for instance, that explanation, as a very, very crude sort
of illustration of what the Hog is. The Hog is one of those
million-mile-long clouds of "nebulosity" lying in the Outer Circle.
It is because of this that I term those clouds of force the Outer
Monsters.</p>

<p>'What they are exactly is a tremendous question to answer. I
sometimes wonder whether Dodgson there realises just how impossible
it is to answer some of his questions,' and Carnacki laughed.</p>

<p>'But to make a brief attempt at it. There is around this planet,
and presumably others, of course, circles of what I might call
"emanations". This is an extremely light gas, or shall I say ether.
Poor ether, it's been hard worked in its time!</p>

<p>'Go back one moment to your school-days, and bear in mind that at
one time the earth was just a sphere of extremely hot gases. These
gases condensed in the form of materials and other "solid" matters;
but there are some that are not yet solidified--air, for instance.
Well, we have an earth-sphere of solid matter on which to stamp as
solidly as we like; and round about that sphere there lies a ring of
gases the constituents of which enter largely into all life, as we
understand life--that is, air.</p>

<p>'But this is not the only circle of gas which is floating round
us. There are, as I have been forced to conclude, larger and more
attenuated "gas" belts lying, zone on zone, far up and around us.
These compose what I have called the inner circles. They are
surrounded in turn by a circle or belt of what I have called, for
want of a better word, "emanations".</p>

<p>'This circle which I have named the Outer Circle can not lie less
than a hundred thousand miles off the earth, and has a thickness
which I have presumed to be anything between five and ten million
miles. I believe, but I cannot prove, that it does not spin with the
earth but in the opposite direction, for which a plausible cause
might be found in the study of the theory upon which a certain
electrical machine is constructed.</p>

<p>'I have reason to believe that the spinning of this, the Outer
Circle, is disturbed from time to time through causes which are quite
unknown to me, but which I believe are based in physical phenomena.
Now, the Outer Circle is the psychic circle, yet it is also physical.
To illustrate what I mean I must again instance electricity, and say
that just as electricity discovered itself to us as something quite
different from any of our previous conceptions of matter, so is the
Psychic or Outer Circle different from any of our previous
conceptions of matter. Yet it is none the less physical in its
origin, and in the sense that electricity is physical, the Outer or
Psychic Circle is physical in its constituents. Speaking pictorially
it is, physically, to the Inner Circle what the Inner Circle is to
the upper strata of the air, and what the air--as we know that
intimate gas--is to the waters and the waters to the solid world. You
get my line of suggestion?'</p>

<p>We all nodded, and Carnacki resumed.</p>

<p>'Well, now let me apply all this to what I am leading up to. I
suggest that these million-mile-long clouds of monstrosity with float
in the Psychic or Outer Circle, are bred of the elements of that
circle. They are tremendous psychic forces, bred out of its elements
just as an octopus or shark is bred out of the sea, or a tiger or any
other physical force is bred out of the elements of its earth-and-air
surroundings.</p>

<p>'To go further, a physical man is composed entirely from the
constituents of earth and air, by which terms I include sunlight and
water and "condiments"! In other words without earth and air he could
not BE! Or to put it another way, earth and air breed within
themselves the materials of the body and the brain, and therefore,
presumably, the machine of intelligence.</p>

<p>'Now apply this line of thought to the Psychic or Outer Cirde
which though so attenuated that I may crudely presume it to be
approximate to our conception of aether, yet contains all the
elements for the production of certain phases of force and
intelligence. But these elements are in a form as little like matter
as the emanations of scent are like the scent itself. Equally, the
force-and-intelligence-producing capacity of the Outer Circle no more
approximates to the life-and-intelligence--producing capacity of the
earth and air than the results of the Outer Circle constituents
resemble the results of earth and air. I wonder whether I make it
clear.</p>

<p>'And so it seems to me we have the conception of a huge psychic
world, bred out of the physical, lying far outside of this world and
completely encompassing it, except for the doorways about which I
hope to tell you some other evening. This enormous psychic world of
the Outer Circle "breeds"-if I may use the term, its own psychic
forces and intelligences, monstrous and otherwise, just as this world
produces its own physical forces and intelligences--beings, animals,
insects, etc., monstrous and otherwise.</p>

<p>'The monstrosities of the Outer Circle are malignant towards all
that we consider most desirable, just in the same way a shark or a
tiger may be considered malignant, in a physical way, to all that we
consider desirable. They are predatory--as all positive force is
predatory. They have desires regarding us which are incredibly more
dreadful to our minds when comprehended than an intelligent sheep
would consider our desires towards its own carcass. They plunder and
destroy to satisfy lusts and hungers exactly as other forms of
existence plunder and destroy to satisfy their lusts and hungers. And
the desire of these monsters is chiefly, if not always, for the
psychic entity of the human.</p>

<p>'But that's as much as I can tell you tonight. Some evening I want
to tell you about the tremendous mystery of the Psychic Doorways. In
the meantime, have I made things a bit clearer to you, Dodgson?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and no,' I answered. 'You've been a brick to make the
attempt, but there are still about ten thousand other things I want
to know.'</p>

<p>Carnacki stood up. 'Out you go!' he said using the recognised
formula in friendly fashion. 'Out you go! I want a sleep.'</p>

<p>And shaking him by the hand we strolled out on to the quiet
Embankment.</p>

<h2><a name="c4"></a>The Voice in the Night</h2>

<p>IT WAS a dark, starless night. We were becalmed in the Northern
Pacific. Our exact position I do not know; for the sun had been
hidden during the course of a weary, breathless week, by a thin haze
which had seemed to float above us, about the height of our
mastheads, at whiles descending and shrouding the surrounding
sea.</p>

<p>With there being no wind, we had steadied the tiller, and I was
the only man on deck. The crew, consisting of two men and a boy, were
sleeping forrard in their den; while Will--my friend, and the master
of our little craft--was aft in his bunk on the port side of the
little cabin.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from out of the surrounding darkness, there came a
hail:</p>

<p>"Schooner, ahoy!"</p>

<p>The cry was so unexpected that I gave no immediate answer, because
of my surprise.</p>

<p>It came again--a voice curiously throaty and inhuman, calling from
somewhere upon the dark sea away on our port broadside:</p>

<p>"Schooner, ahoy!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I sung out, having gathered my wits somewhat. "What are
you? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," answered the queer voice, having
probably noticed some trace of confusion in my tone. "I am only an
old man."</p>

<p>The pause sounded oddly; but it was only afterwards that it came
back to me with any significance.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come alongside, then?" I queried somewhat
snappishly; for I liked not his hinting at my having been a trifle
shaken.</p>

<p>"I--I--can't. It wouldn't be safe. I--" The voice broke off, and
there was silence.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, growing more and more astonished.
"Why not safe? Where are you?"</p>

<p>I listened for a moment; but there came no answer. And then, a
sudden indefinite suspicion, of I knew not what, coming to me, I
stepped swiftly to the binnacle, and took out the lighted lamp. At
the same time, I knocked on the deck with my heel to waken Will. Then
I was back at the side, throwing the yellow funnel of light out into
the silent immensity beyond our rail. As I did so, I heard a slight,
muffled cry, and then the sound of a splash as though someone had
dipped oars abruptly. Yet I cannot say that I saw anything with
certainty; save, it seemed to me, that with the first flash of the
light, there had been something upon the waters, where now there was
nothing.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there!" I called. "What foolery is this!"</p>

<p>But there came only the indistinct sounds of a boat being pulled
away into the night.</p>

<p>Then I heard Will's voice, from the direction of the after
scuttle:</p>

<p>"What's up, George?"</p>

<p>"Come here, Will!" I said.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, coming across the deck.</p>

<p>I told him the queer thing which had happened. He put several
questions; then, after a moment's silence, he raised his hands to his
lips, and hailed:</p>

<p>"Boat, ahoy!"</p>

<p>From a long distance away there came back to us a faint reply, and
my companion repeated his call. Presently, after a short period of
silence, there grew on our hearing the muffled sound of oars; at
which Will hailed again.</p>

<p>This time there was a reply:</p>

<p>"Put away the light."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I will," I muttered; but Will told me to do as the
voice bade, and I shoved it down under the bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Come nearer," he said, and the oar-strokes continued. Then, when
apparently some half-dozen fathoms distant, they again ceased.</p>

<p>"Come alongside," exclaimed Will. "There's nothing to be
frightened of aboard here!"</p>

<p>"Promise that you will not show the light?"</p>

<p>"What's to do with you," I burst out, "that you're so infernally
afraid of the light?"</p>

<p>"Because," began the voice, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Because what?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>Will put his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Shut up a minute, old man," he said, in a low voice. "Let me
tackle him."</p>

<p>He leant more over the rail.</p>

<p>"See here, Mister," he said, "this is a pretty queer business, you
coming upon us like this, right out in the middle of the blessed
Pacific. How are we to know what sort of a hanky-panky trick you're
up to? You say there's only one of you. How are we to know, unless we
get a squint at you--eh? What's your objection to the light,
anyway?"</p>

<p>As he finished, I heard the noise of the oars again, and then the
voice came; but now from a greater distance, and sounding extremely
hopeless and pathetic.</p>

<p>"I am sorry--sorry! I would not have troubled you, only I am
hungry, and--so is she."</p>

<p>The voice died away, and the sound of the oars, dipping
irregularly, was borne to us.</p>

<p>"Stop!" sung out Will. "I don't want to drive you away. Come back!
We'll keep the light hidden, if you don't like it."</p>

<p>He turned to me:</p>

<p>"It's a damned queer rig, this; but I think there's nothing to be
afraid of?"</p>

<p>There was a question in his tone, and I replied.</p>

<p>"No, I think the poor devil's been wrecked around here, and gone
crazy."</p>

<p>The sound of the oars drew nearer.</p>

<p>"Shove that lamp back in the binnacle," said Will; then he leaned
over the rail and listened. I replaced the lamp, and came back to his
side. The dipping of the oars ceased some dozen yards distant.</p>

<p>"Won't you come alongside now?" asked Will in an even voice. "I
have had the lamp put back in the binnacle."</p>

<p>"I--I cannot," replied the voice. "I dare not come nearer. I dare
not even pay you for the--the provisions."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Will, and hesitated. "You're welcome to
as much grub as you can take--" Again he hesitated.</p>

<p>"You are very good," exclaimed the voice. "May God, Who
understands everything, reward you--" It broke off huskily.</p>

<p>"The--the lady?" said Will abruptly. "Is she--"</p>

<p>"I have left her behind upon the island," came the voice.</p>

<p>"What island?" I cut in.</p>

<p>"I know not its name," returned the voice. "I would to God--!" it
began, and checked itself as suddenly.</p>

<p>"Could we not send a boat for her?" asked Will at this point.</p>

<p>"No!" said the voice, with extraordinary emphasis. "My God! No!"
There was a moment's pause; then it added, in a tone which seemed a
merited reproach:</p>

<p>"It was because of our want I ventured--because her agony tortured
me."</p>

<p>"I am a forgetful brute," exclaimed Will. "Just wait a minute,
whoever you are, and I will bring you up something at once."</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes he was back again, and his arms were full
of various edibles. He paused at the rail.</p>

<p>"Can't you come alongside for them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No--I dare not,' replied the voice, and it seemed to me that in
its tones I detected a note of stifled craving--as though the owner
hushed a mortal desire. It came to me then in a flash, that the poor
old creature out there in the darkness, was suffering for actual need
of that which Will held in his arms; and yet, because of some
unintelligible dread, refraining from dashing to the side of our
little schooner, and receiving it. And with the lightning-like
conviction, there came the knowledge that the Invisible was not mad;
but sanely facing some intolerable horror.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Will!" I said, full of many feelings, over which
predominated a vast sympathy. "Get a box. We must float off the stuff
to him in it."</p>

<p>This we did--propelling it away from the vessel, out into the
darkness, by means of a boathook. In a minute, a slight cry from the
Invisible came to us, and we knew that he had secured the box.</p>

<p>A little later, he called out a farewell to us, and so heartful a
blessing, that I am sure we were the better for it. Then, without
more ado, we heard the ply of oars across the darkness.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon off," remarked Will, with perhaps just a little sense
of injury.</p>

<p>"Wait," I replied. "I think somehow he'll come back. He must have
been badly needing that food."</p>

<p>"And the lady," said Will. For a moment he was silent; then he
continued:</p>

<p>"It's the queerest thing ever I've tumbled across, since I've been
fishing."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, and fell to pondering.</p>

<p>And so the time slipped away--an hour, another, and still Will
stayed with me; for the queer adventure had knocked all desire for
sleep out of him.</p>

<p>The third hour was three parts through, when we heard again the
sound of oars across the silent ocean.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Will, a low note of excitement in his voice.</p>

<p>"He's coming, just as I thought," I muttered.</p>

<p>The dipping of the oars grew nearer, and I noted that the strokes
were firmer and longer. The food had been needed.</p>

<p>They came to a stop a little distance off the broadside, and the
queer voice came again to us through the darkness:</p>

<p>"Schooner, ahoy!"</p>

<p>"That you?" asked Will.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the voice. "I left you suddenly; but--but there was
great need."</p>

<p>"The lady?" questioned Will.</p>

<p>"The--lady is grateful now on earth. She will be more grateful
soon in--in heaven."</p>

<p>Will began to make some reply, in a puzzled voice; but became
confused, and broke off short. I said nothing. I was wondering at the
curious pauses, and, apart from my wonder, I was full of a great
sympathy.</p>

<p>The voice continued:</p>

<p>"We--she and I, have talked, as we shared the result of God's
tenderness and yours--"</p>

<p>Will interposed; but without coherence.</p>

<p>"I beg of you not to--to belittle your deed of Christian charity
this night," said the voice. "Be sure that it has not escaped His
notice."</p>

<p>It stopped, and there was a full minute's silence. Then it came
again:</p>

<p>"We have spoken together upon that which--which has befallen us.
We had thought to go out, without telling any, of the terror which
has come into our--lives. She is with me in believing that to-night's
happenings are under a special ruling, and that it is God's wish that
we should tell to you all that we have suffered since--since--"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Will softly.</p>

<p>"Since the sinking of the Albatross."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed involuntarily. "She left Newcastle for 'Frisco
some six months ago, and hasn't been heard of since."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the voice. "But some few degrees to the North of
the line she was caught in a terrible storm, and dismasted. When the
day came, it was found that she was leaking badly, and, presently, it
falling to a calm, the sailors took to the boats, leaving--leaving a
young lady--my fiancee--and myself upon the wreck.</p>

<p>"We were below, gathering together a few of our belongings, when
they left. They were entirely callous, through fear, and when we came
up upon the deck, we saw them only as small shapes afar off upon the
horizon. Yet we did not despair, but set to work and constructed a
small raft. Upon this we put such few matters as it would hold
including a quantity of water and some ship's biscuit. Then, the
vessel being very deep in the water, we got ourselves on to the raft,
and pushed off.</p>

<p>"It was later, when I observed that we seemed to be in the way of
some tide or current, which bore us from the ship at an angle; so
that in the course of three hours, by my watch, her hull became
invisible to our sight, her broken masts remaining in view for a
somewhat longer period. Then, towards evening, it grew misty, and so
through the night. The next day we were still encompassed by the
mist, the weather remaining quiet.</p>

<p>"For four days we drifted through this strange haze, until, on the
evening of the fourth day, there grew upon our ears the murmur of
breakers at a distance. Gradually it became plainer, and, somewhat
after midnight, it appeared to sound upon either hand at no very
great space. The raft was raised upon a swell several times, and then
we were in smooth water, and the noise of the breakers was
behind.</p>

<p>"When the morning came, we found that we were in a sort of great
lagoon; but of this we noticed little at the time; for close before
us, through the enshrouding mist, loomed the hull of a large
sailing-vessel. With one accord, we fell upon our knees and thanked
God; for we thought that here was an end to our perils. We had much
to learn.</p>

<p>"The raft drew near to the ship, and we shouted on them to take us
aboard; but none answered. Presently the raft touched against the
side of the vessel, and, seeing a rope hanging downwards, I seized it
and began to climb. Yet I had much ado to make my way up, because of
a kind of grey, lichenous fungus which had seized upon the rope, and
which blotched the side of the ship lividly.</p>

<p>"I reached the rail and clambered over it, on to the deck. Here I
saw that the decks were covered, in great patches, with grey masses,
some of them rising into nodules several feet in height; but at the
time I thought less of this matter than of the possibility of there
being people aboard the ship. I shouted; but none answered. Then I
went to the door below the poop deck. I opened it, and peered in.
There was a great smell of staleness, so that I knew in a moment that
nothing living was within, and with the knowledge, I shut the door
quickly; for I felt suddenly lonely.</p>

<p>"I went back to the side where I had scrambled up. My--my
sweetheart was still sitting quietly upon the raft. Seeing me look
down she called up to know whether there were any aboard of the ship.
I replied that the vessel had the appearance of having been long
deserted; but that if she would wait a little I would see whether
there was anything in the shape of a ladder by which she could ascend
to the deck. Then we would make a search through the vessel together.
A little later, on the opposite side of the decks, I found a rope
side-ladder. This I carried across, and a minute afterwards she was
beside me.</p>

<p>"Together we explored the cabins and apartments in the after part
of the ship; but nowhere was there any sign of life. Here and there
within the cabins themselves, we came across odd patches of that
queer fungus; but this, as my sweetheart said, could be cleansed
away.</p>

<p>"In the end, having assured ourselves that the after portion of
the vessel was empty, we picked our ways to the bows, between the
ugly grey nodules of that strange growth; and here we made a further
search which told us that there was indeed none aboard but
ourselves.</p>

<p>"This being now beyond any doubt, we returned to the stern of the
ship and proceeded to make ourselves as comfortable as possible.
Together we cleared out and cleaned two of the cabins: and after that
I made examination whether there was anything eatable in the ship.
This I soon found was so, and thanked God in my heart for His
goodness. In addition to this I discovered the whereabouts of the
fresh-water pump, and having fixed it I found the water drinkable,
though somewhat unpleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>"For several days we stayed aboard the ship, without attempting to
get to the shore. We were busily engaged in making the place
habitable. Yet even thus early we became aware that our lot was even
less to be desired than might have been imagined; for though, as a
first step, we scraped away the odd patches of growth that studded
the floors and walls of the cabins and saloon, yet they returned
almost to their original size within the space of twenty-four hours,
which not only discouraged us, but gave us a feeling of vague
unease.</p>

<p>"Still we would not admit ourselves beaten, so set to work afresh,
and not only scraped away the fungus, but soaked the places where it
had been, with carbolic, a can-full of which I had found in the
pantry. Yet, by the end of the week the growth had returned in full
strength, and, in addition, it had spread to other places, as though
our touching it had allowed germs from it to travel elsewhere.</p>

<p>"On the seventh morning, my sweetheart woke to find a small patch
of it growing on her pillow, close to her face. At that, she came to
me, so soon as she could get her garments upon her. I was in the
galley at the time lighting the fire for breakfast.</p>

<p>"Come here, John,' she said, and led me aft. When I saw the thing
upon her pillow I shuddered, and then and there we agreed to go right
out of the ship and see whether we could not fare to make ourselves
more comfortable ashore.</p>

<p>"Hurriedly we gathered together our few belongings, and even among
these I found that the fungus had been at work; for one of her shawls
had a little lump of it growing near one edge. I threw the whole
thing over the side, without saying anything to her.</p>

<p>"The raft was still alongside, but it was too clumsy to guide, and
I lowered down a small boat that hung across the stern, and in this
we made our way to the shore. Yet, as we drew near to it, I became
gradually aware that here the vile fungus, which had driven us from
the ship, was growing riot. In places it rose into horrible,
fantastic mounds, which seemed almost to quiver, as with a quiet
life, when the wind blew across them. Here and there it took on the
forms of vast fingers, and in others it just spread out flat and
smooth and treacherous. Odd places, it appeared as grotesque stunted
trees, seeming extraordinarily kinked and gnarled--the whole quaking
vilely at times.</p>

<p>"At first, it seemed to us that there was no single portion of the
surrounding shore which was not hidden beneath the masses of the
hideous lichen; yet, in this, I found we were mistaken; for somewhat
later, coasting along the shore at a little distance, we descried a
smooth white patch of what appeared to be fine sand, and there we
landed. It was not sand. What it was I do not know. All that I have
observed is that upon it the fungus will not grow; while everywhere
else, save where the sand-like earth wanders oddly, path-wise, amid
the grey desolation of the lichen, there is nothing but that
loathsome greyness.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to make you understand how cheered we were to
find one place that was absolutely free from the growth, and here we
deposited our belongings. Then we went back to the ship for such
things as it seemed to us we should need. Among other matters, I
managed to bring ashore with me one of the ship's sails, with which I
constructed two small tents, which, though exceedingly rough-shaped,
served the purpose for which they were intended. In these we lived
and stored our various necessities, and thus for a matter of some
four weeks all went smoothly and without particular unhappiness.
Indeed, I may say with much of happiness--for--for we were
together.</p>

<p>"It was on the thumb of her right hand that the growth first
showed. It was only a small circular spot, much like a little grey
mole. My God! how the fear leapt to my heart when she showed me the
place. We cleansed it, between us, washing it with carbolic and
water. In the morning of the following day she showed her hand to me
again. The grey warty thing had returned. For a little while, we
looked at one another in silence. Then, still wordless, we started
again to remove it. In the midst of the operation she spoke
suddenly.</p>

<p>"'What's that on the side of your face, dear?' Her voice was sharp
with anxiety. I put my hand up to feel.</p>

<p>"'There! Under the hair by your ear. A little to the front a bit.'
My finger rested upon the place, and then I knew.</p>

<p>"'Let us get your thumb done first,' I said. And she submitted,
only because she was afraid to touch me until it was cleansed. I
finished washing and disinfecting her thumb, and then she turned to
my face. After it was finished we sat together and talked awhile of
many things for there had come into our lives sudden, very terrible
thoughts. We were, all at once, afraid of something worse than death.
We spoke of loading the boat with provisions and water and making our
way out on to the sea; yet we were helpless, for many causes,
and--and the growth had attacked us already. We decided to stay. God
would do with us what was His will. We would wait.</p>

<p>"A month, two months, three months passed and the places grew
somewhat, and there had come others. Yet we fought so strenuously
with the fear that its headway was but slow, comparatively
speaking.</p>

<p>"Occasionally we ventured off to the ship for such stores as we
needed. There we found that the fungus grew persistently. One of the
nodules on the maindeck became soon as high as my head.</p>

<p>"We had now given up all thought or hope of leaving the island. We
had realized that it would be unallowable to go among healthy humans,
with the things from which we were suffering.</p>

<p>"With this determination and knowledge in our minds we knew that
we should have to husband our food and water; for we did not know, at
that time, but that we should possibly live for many years.</p>

<p>"This reminds me that I have told you that I am an old man. Judged
by the years this is not so. But--but--"</p>

<p>He broke off; then continued somewhat abruptly:</p>

<p>"As I was saying, we knew that we should have to use care in the
matter of food. But we had no idea then how little food there was
left of which to take care. It was a week later that I made the
discovery that all the other bread tanks--which I had supposed
full--were empty, and that (beyond odd tins of vegetables and meat,
and some other matters) we had nothing on which to depend, but the
bread in the tank which I had already opened.</p>

<p>"After learning this I bestirred myself to do what I could, and
set to work at fishing in the lagoon; but with no success. At this I
was somewhat inclined to feel desperate until the thought came to me
to try outside the lagoon, in the open sea.</p>

<p>"Here, at times, I caught odd fish; but so infrequently that they
proved of but little help in keeping us from the hunger which
threatened."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that our deaths were likely to come by hunger, and
not by the growth of the thing which had seized upon our bodies.</p>

<p>"We were in this state of mind when the fourth month wore out.
When I made a very horrible discovery. One morning, a little before
midday. I came off from the ship with a portion of the biscuits which
were left. In the mouth of her tent I saw my sweetheart sitting,
eating something.</p>

<p>"'What is it, my dear?' I called out as I leapt ashore. Yet, on
hearing my voice, she seemed confused, and, turning, slyly threw
something towards the edge of the little clearing. It fell short, and
a vague suspicion having arisen within me, I walked across and picked
it up. It was a piece of the grey fungus.</p>

<p>"As I went to her with it in my hand, she turned deadly pale; then
rose red.</p>

<p>"I felt strangely dazed and frightened.</p>

<p>"'My dear! My dear!' I said, and could say no more. Yet at words
she broke down and cried bitterly. Gradually, as she calmed, I got
from her the news that she had tried it the preceding day, and--and
liked it. I got her to promise on her knees not to touch it again,
however great our hunger. After she had promised she told me that the
desire for it had come suddenly, and that, until the moment of
desire, she had experienced nothing towards it but the most extreme
repulsion.</p>

<p>"Later in the day, feeling strangely restless, and much shaken
with the thing which I had discovered, I made my way along one of the
twisted paths--formed by the white, sand-like substance--which led
among the fungoid growth. I had, once before, ventured along there;
but not to any great distance. This time, being involved in
perplexing thought, I went much further than hitherto.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I was called to myself by a queer hoarse sound on my
left. Turning quickly I saw that there was movement among an
extraordinarily shaped mass of fungus, close to my elbow. It was
swaying uneasily, as though it possessed life of its own. Abruptly,
as I stared, the thought came to me that the thing had a grotesque
resemblance to the figure of a distorted human creature. Even as the
fancy flashed into my brain, there was a slight, sickening noise of
tearing, and I saw that one of the branch-like arms was detaching
itself from the surrounding grey masses, and coming towards me. The
head of the thing--a shapeless grey ball, inclined in my direction. I
stood stupidly, and the vile arm brushed across my face. I gave out a
frightened cry, and ran back a few paces. There was a sweetish taste
upon my lips where the thing had touched me. I licked them, and was
immediately filled with an inhuman desire. I turned and seized a mass
of the fungus. Then more and--more. I was insatiable. In the midst of
devouring, the remembrance of the morning's discovery swept into my
mazed brain. It was sent by God. I dashed the fragment I held to the
ground. Then, utterly wretched and feeling a dreadful guiltiness, I
made my way back to the little encampment.</p>

<p>"I think she knew, by some marvellous intuition which love must
have given, so soon as she set eyes on me. Her quiet sympathy made it
easier for me, and I told her of my sudden weakness; yet omitted to
mention the extraordinary thing which had gone before. I desired to
spare her all unnecessary terror.</p>

<p>"But, for myself, I had added an intolerable knowledge, to breed
an incessant terror in my brain; for I doubted not but that I had
seen the end of one of those men who had come to the island in the
ship in the lagoon; and in that monstrous ending I had seen our
own.</p>

<p>"Thereafter we kept from the abominable food, though the desire
for it had entered into our blood. Yet our drear punishment was upon
us; for, day by day, with monstrous rapidity, the fungoid growth took
hold of our poor bodies. Nothing we could do would check it
materially, and so--and so--we who had been human, became---Well, it
matters less each day. Only--only we had been man and maid!</p>

<p>"And day by day the fight is more dreadful, to withstand the
hunger-lust for the terrible lichen.</p>

<p>"A week ago we ate the last of the biscuit, and since that time I
have caught three fish. I was out here fishing tonight when your
schooner drifted upon me out of the mist. I hailed you. You know the
rest, and may God, out of His great heart, bless you for your
goodness to a--a couple of poor outcast souls."</p>

<p>There was the dip of an oar--another. Then the voice came again,
and for the last time, sounding through the slight surrounding mist,
ghostly and mournful.</p>

<p>"God bless you! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," we shouted together, hoarsely, our hearts full of many
emotions.</p>

<p>I glanced about me. I became aware that the dawn was upon us.</p>

<p>The sun flung a stray beam across the hidden sea; pierced the mist
dully, and lit up the receding boat with a gloomy fire. Indistinctly
I saw something nodding between the oars. I thought of a sponge--a
great, grey nodding sponge---The oars continued to ply. They were
grey--as was the boat--and my eyes searched a moment vainly for the
conjunction of hand and oar. My gaze flashed back to the--head. It
nodded forward as the oars went backward for the stroke. Then the
oars were dipped, the boat shot out of the patch of light, and
the--the thing went nodding into the mist.</p>

<h2><a name="c5"></a>The Derelict</h2>

<p>"IT'S THE MATERIAL," said the old ship's doctor--"the material
plus the conditions--and, maybe," he added slowly, "a third
factor--yes, a third factor; but there, there--" He broke off his
half-meditative sentence and began to charge his pipe.</p>

<p>"Go on, doctor," we said encouragingly, and with more than a
little expectancy. We were in the smoke-room of the Sand-a-lea,
running across the North Atlantic; and the doctor was a character. He
concluded the charging of his pipe, and lit it; then settled himself,
and began to express himself more fully.</p>

<p>"The material," he said with conviction, "is inevitably the medium
of expression of the life-force--the fulcrum, as it were; lacking
which it is unable to exert itself, or, indeed, to express itself in
any form or fashion that would be intelligible or evident to us. So
potent is the share of the material in the production of that thing
which we name life, and so eager the life-force to express itself,
that I am convinced it would, if given the right conditions, make
itself manifest even through so hopeless seeming a medium as a simple
block of sawn wood; for I tell you, gentlemen, the life-force is both
as fiercely urgent and as indiscriminate as fire--the destructor; yet
which some are now growing to consider the very essence of life
rampant. There is a quaint seeming paradox there," he concluded,
nodding his old grey head.</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor," I said. "In brief, your argument is that life is a
thing, state, fact, or element, call it what you like, which requires
the material through which to manifest itself, and that given the
material, plus the conditions, the result is life. In other words,
that life is an evolved product, manifested through matter and bred
of conditions--eh?"</p>

<p>"As we understand the word," said the old doctor. "Though, mind
you, there may be a third factor. But, in my heart, I believe that it
is a matter of chemistry--conditions and a suitable medium; but given
the conditions, the brute is so almighty that it will seize upon
anything through which to manifest itself. It is a force generated by
conditions; but, nevertheless, this does not bring us one iota nearer
to its explanation, any more than to the explanation of electricity
or fire. They are, all three, of the outer forces--monsters of the
void. Nothing we can do will create any one of them, our power is
merely to be able, by providing the conditions, to make each one of
them manifest to our physical senses. Am I clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, in a way, you are," I said. "But I don't agree with
you, though I think I understand you. Electricity and fire are both
what I might call natural things, but life is an abstract
something--a kind of all-permeating wakefulness. Oh, I can't explain
it! Who could? But it's spiritual, not just a thing bred out of a
condition, like fire, as you say, or electricity. It's a horrible
thought of yours. Life's a kind of spiritual mystery--"</p>

<p>"Easy, my boy!" said the old doctor, laughing gently to himself.
"Or else I may be asking you to demonstrate the spiritual mystery of
life of the limpet, or the crab, shall we say." He grinned at me with
ineffable perverseness. "Anyway," he continued, "as I suppose you've
all guessed, I've a yarn to tell you in support of my impression that
life is no more a mystery or a miracle than fire or electricity. But,
please to remember, gentlemen, that because we've succeeded in naming
and making good use of these two forces, they're just as much
mysteries, fundamentally as ever. And, anyway, the thing I'm going to
tell you won't explain the mystery of life, but only give you one of
my pegs on which I hang my feeling that life is as I have said, a
force made manifest through conditions--that is to say, natural
chemistry--and that it can take for its purpose and need, the most
incredible and unlikely matter; for without matter it cannot come
into existence--it cannot become manifest--"</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you, doctor," I interrupted. "Your theory
would destroy all belief in life after death. It would--"</p>

<p>"Hush, sonny," said the old man, with a quiet little smile of
comprehension. "Hark to what I've to say first; and, anyway, what
objection have you to material life after death? And if you object to
a material framework, I would still have you remember that I am
speaking of life, as we understand the word in this our life. Now do
be a quiet lad, or I'll never be done:</p>

<p>"It was when I was a young man, and that is a good many years ago,
gentlemen. I had passed my examinations, but was so run down with
overwork that it was decided that I had better take a trip to sea. I
was by no means well off, and very glad in the end to secure a
nominal post as doctor in the sailing passenger clipper running out
to China.</p>

<p>"The name of the ship was the Bheosps&eacute;, and soon after I
had got all my gear aboard she cast off, and we dropped down the
Thames, and next day were well away out in the Channel.</p>

<p>"The captain's name was Gannington, a very decent man, though
quite illiterate. The first mate, Mr. Berlies, was a quiet, sternish,
reserved man, very well-read. The second mate, Mr. Selvern, was,
perhaps, by birth and upbringing, the most socially cultured of the
three, but he lacked the stamina and indomitable pluck of the two
others. He was more of a sensitive, and emotionally and even
mentally, the most alert man of the three.</p>

<p>"On our way out, we called at Madagascar, where we landed some of
our passengers; then we ran eastward, meaning to call at North-West
Cape; but about a hundred degrees east we encountered very dreadful
weather, which carried away all our sails, and sprung the jibboom and
foret'gallantmast.</p>

<p>"The storm carried us northward for several hundred miles, and
when it dropped us finally, we found ourselves in a very bad state.
The ship had been strained, and had taken some three feet of water
through her seams; the maintopmast had been sprung, in addition to
the jibboom and foret'gallantmast, two of our boats had gone, as also
one of the pigstys, with three fine pigs, these latter having been
washed overboard but some half-hour before the wind began to ease,
which it did very quickly, though a very ugly sea ran for some hours
after.</p>

<p>"The wind left us just before dark, and when morning came it
brought splendid weather--a calm, mildly undulating sea, and a
brilliant sun, with no wind. It showed us also that we were not
alone, for about two miles away to the westward was another vessel,
which Mr. Selvern, the second mate, pointed out to me.</p>

<p>"'That's a pretty rum-looking, packet, doctor,' he said, and
handed me his glass.</p>

<p>"I looked through it at the other vessel, and saw what he meant;
at least, I thought I did.</p>

<p>"'Yes, Mr. Selvern,' I said. 'She's got a pretty old-fashioned
look about her.'</p>

<p>"He laughed at me in his pleasant way.</p>

<p>"'It's easy to see you're not a sailor, doctor,' he remarked.
'There's a dozen rum things about her. She's a derelict, and has been
floating round, by the look of her, for many a score of years. Look
at the shape of her counter, and the bows and cutwater. She's as old
as the hills, as you might say, and ought to have gone down to Davy
Jones a good while ago. Look at the growths on her, and the thickness
of her standing rigging; that's all salt encrustations, I fancy, if
you notice the white colour. She's been a small barque; but, don't
you see, she's not a yard left aloft. They've all dropped out of the
slings; everything rotted away; wonder the standing rigging hasn't
gone, too. I wish the old man would let us take the boat and have a
look at her. She'd be well worth it.'</p>

<p>"'There seemed little chance, however, of this, for all hands were
turned to and kept hard at it all day long repairing the damage to
the masts and gear; and this took a long while, as you may think.
Part of the time I gave a hand heaving on one of the deck capstans,
for the exercise was good for my liver. Old Captain Gannington
approved, and I persuaded him to come along and try some of the same
medicine, which he did; and we got very chummy over the job.</p>

<p>"We got talking about the derelict, and he remarked how lucky we
were not to have run full tilt on to her in the darkness, for she lay
right away to leeward of us, according, to the way that we had been
drifting in the storm. He also was of the opinion that she had a
strange look about her, and that she was pretty old; but on this
latter point he plainly had far less knowledge than the second mate,
for he was, as I have said, an illiterate man, and knew nothing of
seacraft beyond what experience had taught him. He lacked the book
knowledge which the second mate had of vessels previous to his day,
which it appeared the derelict was.</p>

<p>"'She's an old 'un, doctor,' was the extent of observations in
this direction.</p>

<p>"Yet, when I mentioned to him that it would be interesting to go
aboard and give her a bit of an overhaul, he nodded his head as if
the idea had been already in his mind and accorded with his own
inclinations.</p>

<p>"'When the work's over, doctor,' he said. 'Can't spare the men
now, ye know. Got to get all shipshape an' ready as smart as we can.
But, we'll take my gig, an' go off in the second dog-watch. The glass
is steady, an' it'll be a bit of gam for us.'</p>

<p>"That evening, after tea, the captain gave orders to clear the gig
and get her overboard. The second mate was to come with us, and the
skipper gave him word to see that two or three lamps were put into
the boat, as it would soon fall dark. A little later we were pulling
across the calmness of the sea with a crew of six at the oars, and
making very good speed of it.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, I have detailed to you with great exactness all
the facts, both big and little, so that you can follow step by step
each incident in this extraordinary affair, and I want you now to pay
the closest attention. I was sitting in the stern-sheets with the
second mate and the captain, who was steering, and as we drew nearer
and nearer to the stranger I studied her with an ever-growing
attention, as, indeed, did Captain Gannington and the second mate.
She was, as you know, to the west-ward of us, and the sunset was
making a great flame of red light to the back of her, so that she
showed a little blurred and indistinct by reason of the halation of
the light, which almost defeated the eye in any attempt to see her
rotting spars and standing rigging, submerged, as they were, in the
fiery glory of the sunset.</p>

<p>"It was because of this effect of the sunset that we had come
quite close, comparatively, to the derelict before we saw that she
was all surrounded by a sort of curious scum, the colour of which was
difficult to decide upon by reason of the red light that was in the
atmosphere, but which afterwards we discovered to be brown. This scum
spread all about the old vessel for many hundreds of yards in a huge,
irregular patch, a great stretch of which reached out to the
eastward, upon the starboard side of the boat some score or so
fathoms away.</p>

<p>"'Queer stuff,' said Captain Gannington, leaning to the side and
looking over. 'Something in the cargo as 'as gone rotten, and worked
out through 'er seams.'</p>

<p>"'Look at her bows and stern,' said the second mate. 'Just look at
the growth on her!'</p>

<p>"There were, as he said, great clumpings of strange-looking
sea-fungi under the bows and the short counter astern. From the stump
of her jibboom and her cutwater great beards of rime and marine
growths hung downward into the scum that held her in. Her blank
starboard side was presented to us--all a dead, dirtyish white,
streaked and mottled vaguely with dull masses of heavier colour.</p>

<p>"'There's a steam or haze rising off her,' said the second mate,
speaking again. 'You can see it against the light. It keeps coming
and going. Look!'</p>

<p>"I saw then what he meant--a faint haze or steam, either suspended
above the old vessel or rising from her. And Captain Gannington saw
it also.</p>

<p>"'Spontaneous combustion!' he exclaimed. 'We'll 'ave to watch when
we lift the 'atches, 'nless it's some poor devil that's got aboard of
'er. But that ain't likely.'</p>

<p>"We were now within a couple of hundred yards of the old derelict,
and had entered into the brown scum. As it poured off the lifted oars
I heard one of the men mutter to himself, 'Dam' treacle!' And,
indeed, it was not something unlike it. As the boat continued to
forge nearer and nearer to the old ship the scum grew thicker and
thicker, so that, at last, it perceptibly slowed us.</p>

<p>"'Give way, lads! Put some beef to it!' sang out Captain
Gannington. And thereafter there was no sound except the panting of
the men and the faint, reiterated suck, suck of the sullen brown scum
upon the oars as the boat was forced ahead. As we went, I was
conscious of a peculiar smell in the evening air, and whilst I had no
doubt that the puddling of the scum by the oars made it rise, I could
give no name to it; yet, in a way, it was vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>"We were now very close to the old vessel, and presently she was
high about us against the dying light. The captain called out then to
'in with the bow oars and stand by with the boat-hook,' which was
done.</p>

<p>"'Aboard there! Ahoy! Aboard there! Ahoy!' shouted Captain
Gannington; but there came no answer, only the dull sound his voice
going lost into the open sea, each time he sung out.</p>

<p>"'Ahoy! Aboard there! Ahoy!' he shouted time after time, but there
was only the weary silence of the old hulk that answered us; and,
somehow as he shouted, the while that I stared up half expectantly at
her, a queer little sense of oppression, that amounted almost to
nervousness, came upon me. It passed, but I remember how I was
suddenly aware that it was growing dark. Darkness comes fairly
rapidly in the tropics, though not so quickly as many fiction writers
seem to think; but it was not that the coming dusk had perceptibly
deepened in that brief time of only a few moments, but rather that my
nerves had made me suddenly a little hypersensitive. I mention my
state particularly, for I am not a nervy man normally, and my abrupt
touch of nerves is significant, in the light of what happened.</p>

<p>"'There's no one on board there!' said Captain Gannington. 'Give
way, men!' For the boat's crew had instinctively rested on their
oars, as the captain hailed the old craft. The men gave way again;
and then the second mate called out excitedly, 'Why, look there,
there's our pigsty! See, it's got Bheosps&eacute; painted on the end.
It's drifted down here and the scum's caught it. What a blessed
wonder!'</p>

<p>"It was, as he had said, our pigsty that had been washed overboard
in the storm; and most extraordinary to come across it there.</p>

<p>"'We'll tow it off with us, when we go,' said the captain, and
shouted to the crew to get down to their oars; for they were hardly
moving the boat, because the scum was so thick, close in around the
old ship, that it literally clogged the boat from moving. I remember
that it struck me, in a half-conscious sort of way, as curious that
the pigsty, containing our three dead pigs, had managed to drift in
so far unaided, whilst we could scarcely manage to force the boat in,
now that we had come right into the scum. But the thought passed from
my mind, for so many things happened within the next few minutes.</p>

<p>"The men managed to bring the boat in alongside, within a couple
of feet of the derelict, and the man with the boat-hook hooked
on.</p>

<p>"'Ave ye got 'old there, forrard?'" asked Captain Gannington.</p>

<p>"'Yessir!' said the bowman; and as he spoke there came a queer
noise of tearing.</p>

<p>"'What's that?' asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"'It's tore, sir. Tore clean away!' said the man, and his tone
showed that he had received something of a shock.</p>

<p>"'Get a hold again, then!' said Captain Gannington irritably. 'You
don't s'pose this packet was built yesterday! Shove the hook into the
main chains' The man did so gingerly, as you might say, for it seemed
to me, in the growing dusk, that he put no strain on to the hook,
though, of course there was no need--you see the boat could not go
very far of herself, in the stuff in which she was imbedded. I
remember thinking this, also as I looked up at the bulging side of
the old vessel. Then I heard Captain Gannington's voice:</p>

<p>"'Lord, but she's old! An' what a colour, doctor! She don't half
want paint, do she? Now then, somebody, one of them oars.' An oar was
passed to him, and he leant it up against the ancient, bulging side;
then he paused, and called to the second mate to light a couple of
the lamps, and stand by to pass them up, for darkness had settled
down now upon the sea.</p>

<p>"The second mate lit two of the lamps, and told one of the men to
light a third, and keep it handy in the boat; then he stepped across,
with a lamp in each hand, to where Captain Gannington stood by the
oar against the side of the ship.</p>

<p>"'Now, my lad,' said the captain to the man who had pulled stroke,
'up with you, an' we'll pass ye up the lamps.'</p>

<p>"The man jumped to obey, caught the oar, and put his weight upon
it; and as he did so, something seemed to give way a little.</p>

<p>"'Look!' cried out the second mate, and pointed, lamp in hand.
'It's sunk in!'</p>

<p>"This was true. The oar had made quite an indentation into the
bulging, somewhat slimy side of the old vessel.</p>

<p>"'Mould, I reckon,' said Captain Gannington, bending towards the
derelict to look. Then to the man:</p>

<p>"'Up you go, my lad, and be smart! Don't stand there waitin'!'</p>

<p>"At that the man, who had paused a moment as he felt the oar give
beneath his weight began to shin' up, and in a few seconds he was
aboard, and leant out over the rail for the lamps. These were passed
up to him, and the captain called to him to steady the oar. Then
Captain Gannington went, calling to me to follow, and after me the
second mate.</p>

<p>"As the captain put his face over the rail, he gave a cry of
astonishment.</p>

<p>"'Mould, by gum! Mould--tons of it. Good lord!'</p>

<p>"As I heard him shout that I scrambled the more eagerly after him,
and in a moment or two I was able to see what he meant--everywhere
that the light from the two lamps struck there was nothing but smooth
great masses and surfaces of a dirty white coloured mould. I climbed
over the rail, with the second mate close behind, and stood upon the
mould covered decks. There might have been no planking beneath the
mould, for all that our feet could feel. It gave under our tread with
a spongy, puddingy feel. It covered the deck furniture of the old
ship, so that the shape of each article and fitment was often no more
than suggested through it.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington snatched a lamp from the man and the second
mate reached for the other. They held the lamps high, and we all
stared. It was most extraordinary, and somehow most abominable. I can
think of no other word, gentlemen, that so much describes the
predominant feeling that affected me at the moment.</p>

<p>"'Good lord!' said Captain Gannington several times. 'Good lord!'
But neither the second mate nor the man said anything, and, for my
part I just stared, and at the same time began to smell a little at
the air, for there was a vague odour of something half familiar, that
somehow brought to me a sense of half-known fright.</p>

<p>"I turned this way and that, staring, as I have said. Here and
there the mould was so heavy as to entirely disguise what lay
beneath, converting the deck-fittings into indistinguishable mounds
of mould all dirty-white and blotched and veined with irregular,
dull, purplish markings.</p>

<p>"There was a strange thing about the mould which Captain
Gannington drew attention to--it was that our feet did not crush into
it and break the surface, as might have been expected, but merely
indented it.</p>

<p>"'Never seen nothin' like it before! Never!' said the captain
after having stooped with his lamp to examine the mould under our
feet. He stamped with his heel, and the mould gave out a dull,
puddingy sound. He stooped again, with a quick movement, and stared,
holding the lamp close to the deck. 'Blest if it ain't a reg'lar skin
to it!'</p>

<p>"The second mate and the man and I all stooped and looked at it.
The second mate progged it with his forefinger, and I remember I
rapped it several times with my knuckles, listening to the dead sound
it gave out, and noticing the close, firm texture of the mould.</p>

<p>"'Dough!' the second mate. 'It's just like blessed dough! Pouf!'
He stood up with a quick movement. 'I could fancy it stinks a bit,'
he said.</p>

<p>"As he said this I knew, suddenly, what the familiar thing was in
the vague odour that hung about us--it was that the smell had
something animal-like in it; something of the same smell, only
heavier, that you would smell in any place that is infested with
mice. I began to look about with a sudden very real uneasiness. There
might be vast numbers of hungry rats aboard. They might prove
exceedingly dangerous, if in a starving condition; yet, as you will
understand, somehow I hesitated to put forward my idea as a reason
for caution, it was too fanciful.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington had begun to go aft along the mould-covered
main-deck with the second mate, each of them holding their lamps high
up, so as to cast a good light about the vessel. I turned quickly and
followed them, the man with me keeping close to my heels, and plainly
uneasy. As we went, I became aware that there was a feeling of
moisture in the air, and I remembered the slight mist, or smoke,
above the hulk, which had made Captain Gannington suggest spontaneous
combustion in explanation.</p>

<p>"And always, as we went, there was that vague, animal smell;
suddenly I found myself wishing we were well away from the old
vessel.</p>

<p>"Abruptly, after a few paces, the captain stopped and pointed at a
row of mould-hidden shapes on each side of the maindeck. 'Guns,' he
said. 'Been a privateer in the old days, I guess--maybe worse! We'll
'ave a look below, doctor; there may be something worth touchin'.
She's older than I thought. Mr. Selvern thinks she's about two
hundred years old; but I scarce think it.'</p>

<p>"We continued our way aft, and I remember that I found myself
walking as lightly and gingerly as possible, as if I were
subconsciously afraid of treading through the rotten, mould-hid
decks. I think the others had a touch of the same feeling, from the
way that they walked. Occasionally the soft stuff would grip our
heels, releasing them with a little sullen suck.</p>

<p>"The captain forged somewhat ahead of the second mate; and I know
that the suggestion he had made himself, that perhaps there might be
something below worth carrying away, had stimulated his imagination.
The second mate was, however, beginning to feel somewhat the same way
that I did; at least I have that impression. I think, if it had not
been for what I might truly describe as Captain Gannington's sturdy
courage, we should all of us have just gone back over the side very
soon, for there was most certainly an unwholesome feeling abroad that
made one feel queerly lacking in pluck; and you will soon see that
this feeling was justified.</p>

<p>"Just as the captain reached the few mould-covered steps leading
up on to the short half-poop, I was suddenly aware that the feeling
of moisture in the air had grown very much more definite. It was
perceptible now, intermittently, as a sort of thin, moist, fog-like
vapour, that came and went oddly, and seemed to make the decks a
little indistinct to the view, this time and that. Once an odd puff
of it beat up suddenly from somewhere, and caught me in the face,
carrying a queer, sickly, heavy odour with it that somehow frightened
me strangely with a suggestion of a waiting and half-comprehended
danger.</p>

<p>"We had followed Captain Gannington up the three mould covered
steps, and now went slowly along the raised after-deck. By the
mizzenmast Captain Gannington paused, and held his lantern near to
it. 'My word, mister,' he said to the second mate, 'it's fair
thickened up with mould! Why, I'll g'antee it's close on four foot
thick.' He shone the light down to where it met the deck. 'Good
lord!' he said. 'Look at the sea-lice on it!' I stepped up, and it
was as he had said; the sea-lice were thick upon it, some of them
huge, not less than the size of large beetles, and all a clear,
colourless shade, like water, except where there were little spots of
grey on them.</p>

<p>"'I've never seen the like of them, 'cept on a live cod,' said
Captain Gannington, in an extremely puzzled voice. 'My word! But
they're whoppers!' Then he passed on; but a few paces farther aft he
stopped again, and held his lamp near to the mould-hidden deck.</p>

<p>"'Lord bless me, doctor,' he called out, in a low voice, 'did ye
ever see the like of that? Why, it's a foot long, if it's a
hinch!'</p>

<p>"I stooped over his shoulder, and saw what he meant; it was a
clear, colourless creature about a foot long, and about eight inches
high, with a curved back that was extraordinarily narrow. As we
stared, all in a group, it gave a queer little flick, and was
gone.</p>

<p>"'Jumped!' said the captain. 'Well, if that ain't a giant of all
the sea-lice that ever I've seen. I guess it's jumped twenty foot
clear.' He straightened his back, and scratched his head a moment,
swinging the lantern this way and that with the other hand, and
staring about us. 'Wot are they doin' aboard 'ere?' he said. 'You'll
see 'em--little things--on fat cod an' such-like. I'm blowed, doctor,
if I understand.'</p>

<p>"He held his lamp towards a big mound of the mould that occupied
part of the after portion of the low poop-deck, a little foreside of
where there came a two-foot high 'break' to a kind of second and
loftier poop, that ran away aft to the taffrail. The mound was pretty
big, several feet across, and more than a yard high. Captain
Gannington walked up to it.</p>

<p>"'I reck'n this's the scuttle,' he remarked, and gave it a heavy
kick. The only result was a deep indentation into the huge, whiteish
hump of mould, as if he had driven his foot into a mass of some
doughy substance. Yet I am not altogether correct in saying that this
was the only result, for a certain other thing happened. From the
place made by the captain's foot there came a sudden gush of a
purplish fluid, accompanied by a peculiar smell, that was, and was
not, half familiar. Some of the mould-like substance had stuck to the
toe of the captain's boot, and from this likewise there issued a
sweat, as it were, of the same colour.</p>

<p>"'Well?' said Captain Gannington, in surprise, and drew back his
foot to make another kick at the hump of mould. But he paused at an
exclamation from the second mate:</p>

<p>"'Don't sir,' said the second mate.</p>

<p>"I glanced at him, and the light from Captain Gannington's lamp
showed me that his face had a bewildered, half-frightened look, as if
he were suddenly and unexpectedly half afraid of something, and as if
his tongue had given away his sudden fright, without any intention on
his part to speak. The captain also turned and stared at him.</p>

<p>"'Why, mister?' he asked, in a somewhat puzzled voice, through
which there sounded just the vaguest hint of annoyance. 'We've got to
shift this muck, if we're to get below.'</p>

<p>"I looked at the second mate, and it seemed to me that, curiously
enough he was listening less to the captain than to some other sound.
Suddenly he said, in a queer voice, 'Listen, everybody!'</p>

<p>"Yet we heard nothing, beyond the faint murmur of the men talking
together in the boat alongside.</p>

<p>"'I don't, hear nothing,' said Captain Gannington, after a short
pause. 'Do you, doctor?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Wot was it you thought you heard?' the captain, turning again to
the second mate. But the second mate shook his head in a curious,
almost irritable way, as if the captain's question interrupted his
listening. Captain Gannington stared a moment at him, then held his
lantern up and glanced about him almost uneasily. I know I felt a
queer sense of strain. But the light showed nothing beyond the
greyish dirty-white of the mould in all directions.</p>

<p>"'Mister Selvern,' said the captain, at last, looking at him,
'don't get fancying, things. Get hold of your bloomin' self. Ye know
ye heard nothin'?'</p>

<p>"'I'm quite sure I heard something, sir,' said the second mate. 'I
seemed to hear--' He broke off sharply, and appeared to listen with
an almost painful intensity.</p>

<p>"'What did it sound like?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'It's all right, doctor,' said Captain Gannington, laughing
gently. 'Ye can give him a tonic when we get back. I'm goin' to shift
this stuff.' He drew back, and kicked for the second time at the ugly
mass which he took to hide the companionway. The result of his kick
was startling, for the whole thing wobbled sloppily, like a mound of
unhealthy-looking jelly.</p>

<p>"He drew his foot out of it quickly, and took a step backward,
staring, and holding his lamp towards it. 'By gum,' he said, and it
was plain that he was generally startled, 'the blessed thing's gone
soft!'</p>

<p>"The man had run back several steps from the suddenly flaccid
mound, and looking horribly frightened. Though of what, I am sure he
had not the least idea. The second mate stood where he was, and
stared. For my part, I know I had a most hideous uneasiness upon me.
The captain continued to hold his light towards the wobbling mound
and stare.</p>

<p>"'It's gone squashy all through,' he said. 'There's no scuttle
there. There's no bally woodwork inside that lot! Phoo! What a rum
smell!'</p>

<p>"He walked round to the after side of the strange mound, to see
whether there might be some signs of an opening, into the hull at the
back of the great heap of mould-stuff. And then:</p>

<p>"'Listen!' said the second mate again, in the strangest sort of
voice.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington straightened himself upright, and there
succeeded a pause of the most intense quietness, in which there was
not even the hum of talk from the men alongside in the boat. We all
heard it--a kind of dull, soft thud, thud, thud, thud, somewhere in
the hull under us, yet so vague as to make me half doubtful I heard
it, only that the others did so, too.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington turned suddenly to where the man stood.</p>

<p>"'Tell them--' he began. But the fellow cried out something, and
pointed. There had come a strange intensity into his somewhat
unemotional face, so that the captain's glance followed his action
instantly. I stared also as you may think. It was the great mound at
which the man was pointing. I saw what he meant. From the two gapes
made in the mould-like stuff by Captain Gannington's boot, the purple
fluid was jetting out in a queerly regular fashion, almost as if it
were being forced out by a pump. My word! But I stared! And even as I
stared a larger jet squirted out, and splashed as far as the man,
spattering his boots and trouser legs.</p>

<p>"The fellow had been pretty nervous before, in a stolid, ignorant
sort of way, and his funk had been growing steadily; but at this he
simply let out a yell, and turned about to run. He paused an instant,
as if a sudden fear of the darkness that held the decks, between him
and the boat, had taken him. He snatched at the second mate's
lantern, tore it out of his hand, and plunged heavily away over the
vile stretch of mould.</p>

<p>"Mr. Selvern, the second mate, said not a word; he was just
staring, staring at the strange-smelling twin-streams of dull purple
that were jetting out from the wobbling mound. Captain Gannington,
however, roared an order to the man to come back, but the man plunged
on and on across the mould, his feet seeming to be clogged by the
stuff, as if it had grown suddenly soft. He zigzagged as he ran, the
lantern swaying, in wild circles as he wrenched his feet free with a
constant plop, plop; and I could hear his frightened gasps even from
where I stood.</p>

<p>"'Come back with that lamp!' roared the captain again; but still
the man took no notice.</p>

<p>"And Captain Gannington was silent an instant, his lips working in
a queer, inarticulate fashion, as if he were stunned momentarily by
the very violence of his anger at the man's insubordination. And in
the silence I heard the sounds again--thud, thud, thud, thud! Quite
distinctly now, beating, it seemed suddenly to me, right down under
my feet, but deep.</p>

<p>"I stared down at the mould on which I was standing, with a quick,
disgusting sense of the terrible all about me; then I looked at the
captain, and tried to say something, without appearing frightened. I
saw that he had turned again to the mound, and all the anger had gone
out of his face. He had his lamp out towards the mound, and was
listening. There was another moment of absolute silence, at least, I
knew that I was not conscious of any sound at all in all the world,
except that extraordinary thud, thud, thud, thud, down somewhere in
the huge bulk under us.</p>

<p>"The captain shifted his feet with a sudden, nervous movement, and
as he lifted them the mould went plop, plop! He looked quickly at me,
trying to smile, as if he were not thinking anything very much about
it.</p>

<p>"'What do you make of it, doctor?' he said.</p>

<p>"'I think--' I began. But the second mate interrupted with a
single word, his voice pitched a little high, in a tone that made us
both stare instantly at him.</p>

<p>"'Look!' he said, and pointed at the mound. The thing was all of a
slow quiver. A strange ripple ran outward from it, along the deck,
like you will see a ripple run inshore out of a calm sea. It reached
a mound a little foreside of us, which I had supposed to be the cabin
skylight, and in a moment the second mound sank nearly level with the
surrounding decks, quivering floppily in a most extraordinary
fashion. A sudden quick tremor took the mould right under the second
mate, and he gave out a hoarse little cry, and held his arms out on
each side of him, to keep his balance. The tremor in the mould
spread, and Captain Gannington swayed, and spread out his feet with a
sudden curse of fright. The second mate jumped across to him, and
caught him by the wrist.</p>

<p>"'The boat, sir!' he said, saying the very thing that I had lacked
the pluck to say. 'For God's sake--'</p>

<p>"But he never finished, for a tremendous hoarse scream cut off his
words. They hove themselves round and looked. I could see without
turning. The man who had run from us was standing in the waist of the
ship, about a fathom from the starboard bulwarks. He was swaying from
side to side, and screaming, in a dreadful fashion. He appeared to be
trying to lift his feet, and the light from his swaying lantern
showed an almost incredible sight. All about him the mould was in
active movement. His feet had sunk out of sight. The stuff appeared
to be lapping at his legs and abruptly his bare flesh showed. The
hideous stuff had rent his trouser-leg away as if it were paper. He
gave out a simply sickening scream, and, with a vast effort, wrenched
one leg free. It was partly destroyed. The next instant he pitched
face downward, and the stuff heaped itself upon him, as if it were
actually alive, with a dreadful, severe life. It was simply infernal.
The man had gone from sight. Where he had fallen was now a writhing,
elongated mound, in constant and horrible increase, as the mould
appeared to move towards it in strange ripples from all sides.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington and the second mate were stone silent, in
amazed and incredulous horror, but I had begun to reach towards a
grotesque and terrific conclusion, both helped and hindered by my
professional training.</p>

<p>"From the men in the boat alongside there was a loud shouting, and
I saw two of their faces appear suddenly above the rail. They showed
clearly a moment in the light from the lamp which the man had
snatched from Mr. Selvern; for, strangely enough, this lamp was
standing upright and unharmed on the deck, a little way foreside of
that dreadful, elongated, growing mound, that still swayed and
writhed with an incredible horror. The lamp rose and fell on the
passing ripples of the mould, just--for all the world--as you will
see a boat rise and fall on little swells. It is of some interest to
me now, psychologically, to remember how that rising and falling
lantern brought home to me more than anything the incomprehensible
dreadful strangeness of it all.</p>

<p>"The men's faces disappeared with sudden yells, as if they had
slipped, or been suddenly hurt; and there was a fresh uproar of
shouting from the boat. The men were calling to us to come away--to
come away. In the same instant I felt my left boot drawn suddenly and
forcibly downward, with a horrible, painful grip. I wrenched it free,
with a yell of angry fear. Forrard of us, I saw that the vile surface
was all amove, and abruptly I found myself shouting in a queer,
frightened voice, 'The boat, captain! The boat, captain!'</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington stared round at me, over his right shoulder,
in a peculiar, dull way, that told me he was utterly dazed with
bewilderment and the incomprehensibleness of it all. I took a quick,
clogged, nervous step towards him, and gripped his arm, and shook it
fiercely. 'The boat!' I shouted at him. 'The boat! For God's sake,
tell the men to bring the boat aft!'</p>

<p>"Then the mound must have drawn his feet down, for abruptly he
bellowed fiercely with terror, his momentary apathy giving place to
furious energy. His thickset, vastly muscular body doubled and
writhed with his enormous effort, and he struck out madly dropping
the lantern. He tore his feet free, something ripping as he did so.
The reality and necessity of the situation had come upon him
brutishly real, and he was roaring to the men in the boat, 'Bring the
boat aft! Bring 'er aft! Bring 'er aft!' The second mate and I were
shouting the same thing madly.</p>

<p>"'For God's sake, be smart, lads!' roared the captain, and stooped
quickly for his lamp, which still burned. His feet were gripped
again, and he hove them out, blaspheming breathlessly, and leaping a
yard high with his effort. Then he made a run for the side, wrenching
his feet free at each step. In the same instant the second mate cried
out something, and grabbed at the captain.</p>

<p>"'It's got hold of my feet! It's got hold of my feet!' he
screamed. His feet, had disappeared up to his boot-tops, and Captain
Gannington caught him round the waist with his powerful left arm,
gave a mighty heave, and the next instant had him free; but both his
boot-soles had gone. For my part, I jumped madly from foot to foot,
to avoid the plucking of the mould; and suddenly I made a run for the
ship's side. But before I could get there, a queer gape came in the
mould between us and the side, at least a couple of feet wide, and
how deep I don't know. It closed up in an instant, and all the mould
where the cape had been vent into a sort of flurry of horrible
ripplings, so that I ran back from it; for I did not dare to put my
foot upon it. Then the captain was shouting to me:</p>

<p>"'Aft, doctor! Aft, doctor! This way, doctor! Run!' I saw then
that he had passed me, and was up on the after raised portion of the
poop. He had the second mate, thrown like a sack, all loose and
quiet, over his left shoulder; for Mr. Selvern had fainted, and his
long legs flogged limp and helpless against the captain's massive
knees as he ran. I saw, with a queer, unconscious noting of minor
details, how the torn soles of the second mate's boots flapped and
jigged as the captain staggered aft.</p>

<p>"'Boat ahoy! Boat ahoy! Boat ahoy!' shouted the captain; and then
I was beside him, shouting also. The men were answering with loud
yells of encouragement, and it was plain they were working
desperately to force the boat aft through the thick scum about the
ship.</p>

<p>"We reached the ancient, mould-hid taffrail, and slewed about
breathlessly in the half-darkness to see what was happening. Captain
Gannington had left his lantern by the big mound when he picked up
the second mate; and as we stood, gasping we discovered suddenly that
all the mould between us and the light was full of movement. Yet, the
part on which we stood, for about six or eight feet forrard of us,
was still firm.</p>

<p>"Every couple of seconds we shouted to the men to hasten, and they
kept on calling to us that they would be with us in an instant. And
all the time we watched the deck of that dreadful hulk, feeling, for
my part, literally sick with mad suspense, and ready to jump
overboard into that filthy scum all about us.</p>

<p>"Down somewhere in the huge bulk of the ship there was all the
time that extraordinary dull, ponderous thud, thud, thud, thud
growing ever louder. I seemed to feel the whole hull of the derelict,
beginning to quiver and thrill with each dull beat. And to me, with
the grotesque and hideous suspicion of what made that noise, it was
at once the most dreadful and incredible sound I have ever heard.</p>

<p>"As we waited desperately for the boat, I scanned incessantly so
much of the grey white bulk as the lamp showed. The whole of the
decks seemed to be in strange movement. Forrard of the lamp, I could
see indistinctly the moundings of the mould swaying and nodding
hideously beyond the circle of the brightest rays. Nearer, and full
in the glow of the lamp, the mound which should have indicated the
skylight, was swelling steadily. There were ugly, purple veinings on
it, and as it swelled, it seemed to me that the veinings and
mottlings on it were becoming plainer, rising as though embossed upon
it, like you will see the veins stand out on the body of a powerful,
full-blooded horse. It was most extraordinary. The mound that we had
supposed to cover the companionway had sunk flat with the surrounding
mould, and I could not see that it jetted out any more of the
purplish fluid.</p>

<p>"A quaking movement of the mound began away forrard of the lamp,
and came flurrying away aft towards us, and at the sight of that I
climbed up on to the spongy-feeling taffrail, and yelled afresh for
the boat. The men answered with a shout, which told me they were
nearer, but the beastly scum was so thick that it was evidently a
fight to move the boat at all. Beside me, Captain Gannington was
shaking the second mate furiously, and the man stirred and began to
moan. The captain shook him again, 'Wake up! Wake up, mister!' he
shouted.</p>

<p>"The second mate staggered out of the captain's arms, and
collapsed suddenly, shrieking: 'My feet! Oh, God! My feet!' The
captain and I lugged him off the mound, and got him into a sitting
position upon the taffrail, where he kept up a continual moaning.</p>

<p>"'Hold 'im, doctor,' said the captain. And whilst I did so, he ran
forrard a few yards, and peered down over the starboard quarter rail.
'For God's sake, be smart, lads! Be smart! Be smart!' he shouted down
to the men, and they answered him, breathless, from close at hand,
yet still too far away for the boat to be any use to us on the
instant.</p>

<p>"I was holding the moaning, half-unconscious officer, and staring
forrard along the poop decks. The flurrying of the mould was coming
aft, slowly and noiselessly. And then, suddenly, I saw something
closer:</p>

<p>"'Look out, captain!' I shouted. And even as I shouted, the mould
near to him gave a sudden, peculiar slobber. I had seen a ripple
stealing towards him through the mould. He gave an enormous, clumsy
leap, and landed near to us on the sound part of the mould, but the
movement followed him. He turned and faced it, swearing fiercely. All
about his feet there came abruptly little gapings, which made horrid
sucking noises. 'Come back, captain!' I yelled. 'Come back, quick!'
As I shouted, a ripple came at his feet--lipping at them; and he
stamped insanely at it, and leaped back, his boot torn half off his
foot. He swore madly with pain and anger, and jumped swiftly for the
taffrail.</p>

<p>"'Come on, doctor! Over we go!' he called. Then he remembered the
filthy scum, and hesitated, and roared out desperately to the men to
hurry. I stared down, also.</p>

<p>"'The second mate?' I said.</p>

<p>"'I'll take charge doctor,' said Captain Gannington, and caught
hold of Mr. Selvern. As he spoke, I thought I saw something beneath
us, outlined against the scum. I leaned out over the stern, and
peered. There was something under the port-quarter.</p>

<p>"'There's something down there, captain!' I called, and pointed in
the darkness. He stooped far over, and stared.</p>

<p>"'A boat, by gum! A boat!' he yelled, and began to wriggle swiftly
along the taffrail, dragging the second mate after him. I followed.
'A boat it is, sure!' he exclaimed a few moments later, and, picking
up the second mate clear of the rail, he hove him down into the boat,
where he fell with a crash into the bottom.</p>

<p>"'Over ye go, doctor!' he yelled at me, and pulled me bodily off
the rail and dropped me after the officer. As he did so, I felt the
whole of the ancient, spongy rail give a peculiar, sickening quiver,
and begin to wobble. I fell on to the second mate, and the captain
came after, almost in the same instant, but, fortunately, he landed
clear of us, on to the fore thwart, which broke under his weight,
with a loud crack and splintering of wood.</p>

<p>"'Thank God!' I heard him mutter. 'Thank God! I guess that was a
mighty near thing to going to Hades.'</p>

<p>"He struck a match, just as I got to my feet, and between us we
got the second mate straightened out on one of the after fore-and-aft
thwarts. We shouted to the men in the boat, telling them where we
were, and saw the light of their lantern shining round the starboard
counter of the derelict. They called back to us to tell us they were
doing their best, and then, whilst we waited, Captain Gannington
struck another match, and began to overhaul the boat we had dropped
into. She was a modern, two-bowed boat, and on the stern there was
painted 'Cyclone, Glasgow.' She was in pretty fair condition, and had
evidently drifted into the scum and been held by it.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington struck several matches, and went forrard
towards the derelict. Suddenly he called to me, and I jumped over the
thwarts to him. 'Look, doctor,' he said, and I saw what he meant--a
mass of bones up in the bows of the boat. I stooped over them, and
looked; there were the bones of at least three people, all mixed
together in an extraordinary fashion, and quite clean and dry. I had
a sudden thought concerning the bones, but I said nothing, for my
thought was vague in some ways, and concerned the grotesque and
incredible suggestion that had come to me as to the cause of that
ponderous, dull thud, thud, thud thud, that beat on so infernally
within the hull, and was plain to hear even now that we had got off
the vessel herself. And all the while, you know, I had a sick,
horrible mental picture of that frightful, wriggling mound aboard the
hulk.</p>

<p>"As Captain Gannington struck a final match, I saw something that
sickened me and the captain saw it in the same instant. The match
went out, and he fumbled clumsily for another, and struck it. We saw
the thing again. We had not been mistaken. A great lip of grey-white
was protruding in over the edge of the boat--a great lappet of the
mould was coming stealthily towards us--a live mass of the very hull
itself! And suddenly Captain Gannington yelled out in so many words
the grotesque and incredible thing I was thinking: 'She's alive!'</p>

<p>"I never heard such a sound of comprehension and terror in a man's
voice. The very horrified assurance of it made actual to me the thing
that before had only lurked in my subconscious mind. I knew he was
right; I knew that the explanation my reason and my training both
repelled and reached towards was the true one. Oh, I wonder whether
anyone can possibly understand our feelings in that moment? The
unmitigated horror of it and the incredibleness!</p>

<p>"As the light of the match burned up fully, I saw that the mass of
living matter coming towards us was streaked and veined with purple,
the veins standing out, enormously distended. The whole thing
quivered continuously to each ponderous thud, thud, thud, thud, of
that gargantuan organ that pulsed within the huge grey-white bulk.
The flame of the match reached the captain's fingers, and there came
to me a little sickly whiff of burned flesh, but he seemed
unconscious of any pain. Then the flame went out in a brief sizzle,
yet at the last moment I had seen an extraordinary raw look become
visible upon the end of that monstrous, protruding lappet. It had
become dewed with a hideous, purplish sweat. And with the darkness
there came a sudden charnel-like stench.</p>

<p>"I heard the matchbox split in Captain Gannington's hands as he
wrenched it open. Then he swore, in a queer frightened voice, for he
had come to the end of his matches. He turned clumsily in the
darkness, and tumbled over the nearest thwart, in his eagerness to
get to the stern of the boat; and I after him. For we knew that thing
was coming towards us through the darkness, reaching over that
piteous mingled heap of human bones all jumbled together in the bows.
We shouted madly to the men, and for answer saw the bows of the boat
emerge dimly into view round the starboard counter of the
derelict.</p>

<p>"'Thank God!' I gasped out. But Captain Gannington roared to them
to show a light. Yet this they could not do, for the lamp had just
been stepped on in their desperate efforts to force the boat round to
us.</p>

<p>"'Quick! Quick!' I shouted.</p>

<p>"'For God's sake, be smart, men!' roared the captain.</p>

<p>"And both of us faced the darkness under the port-counter, out of
which we knew--but could not see--the thing was coming to us.</p>

<p>"'An oar! Smart, now--pass me an oar!' shouted the captain; and
reached out his hands through the gloom towards the on-coming boat. I
saw a figure stand up in the bows, and hold something out to us
across the intervening yards of scum. Captain Gannington swept his
hands through the darkness, and encountered it.</p>

<p>"'I've got it! Let go there!' he said, in a quick, tense
voice.</p>

<p>"In the same instant the boat we were in was pressed over suddenly
to starboard by some tremendous weight. Then I heard the captain
shout, 'Duck y'r head, doctor!' And directly afterwards he swung the
heavy, fourteen-foot oar round his head, and struck into the
darkness. There came a sudden squelch, and he struck again, with a
savage grunt of fierce energy. At the second blow the boat righted
with a slow movement, and directly afterwards the other boat bumped
gently into ours.</p>

<p>"Captain Gannington dropped the oar, and, springing across to the
second mate, hove him up off the thwart, and pitched him with knee
and arms clear in over the bows among the men; then he shouted to me
to follow, which I did, and he came after me, bringing the oar with
him. We carried the second mate aft, and the captain shouted to the
men to back the boat a little; then they got her bows clear of the
boat we had just left, and so headed out through the scum for the
open sea.</p>

<p>"'Where's Tom 'Arrison?" gasped one of the men, in the midst of
his exertions. He happened to be Tom Harrison's particular chum, and
Captain Gannington answered him briefly enough:</p>

<p>"'Dead! Pull! Don't talk!"</p>

<p>"Now, difficult as it had been to force the boat through the scum
to our rescue, the difficulty to get clear seemed tenfold. After some
five minutes pulling, the boat seemed hardly to have moved a fathom,
if so much, and a quite dreadful fear took me afresh, which one of
the panting men put suddenly into words, 'It's got us!' he gasped
out. 'Same as poor Tom!' It was the man who had inquired where
Harrison was.</p>

<p>"'Shut y'r mouth an' pull!' roared the captain. And so another few
minutes passed. Abruptly, it seemed to me that the dull, ponderous
thud, thud, thud, thud came more plainly through the dark, and I
stared intently over the stern. I sickened a little, for I could
almost swear that the dark mass of the monster was actually
nearer--that it was coming nearer to us through the darkness. Captain
Gannington must have had the same thought, for, after a brief look
into the darkness, he jumped forrard, and began to double-bank the
stroke-oar.</p>

<p>"'Get forrid under the oars, doctor,' he said to me rather
breathlessly. 'Get in the bows, an' see if you can't free the stuff a
bit round the bows.'</p>

<p>"I did as he told me, and a minute later I was in the bows of the
boat, puddling the scum from side to side, and trying to break up the
viscid, clinging muck. A heavy almost animal-like smell rose off it,
and all the air seemed full of the deadening, heavy smell. I shall
never find words to tell anyone on earth the whole horror of it
all--the threat that seemed to hang in the very air around us, and
but a little astern that incredible thing, coming, as I firmly
believed, nearer, and scum holding us, like half-melted glue.</p>

<p>"The minutes passed in a deadly, eternal fashion, and I kept
staring back astern into the darkness but never ceasing to puddle
that filthy scum, striking at it and switching it from side to side
until I sweated.</p>

<p>"Abruptly Captain Gannington sang out: 'We're gaining, lads.
Pull!' And I felt the boat forge ahead perceptibly, as they gave way
with renewed hope and energy. There was soon no doubt of it, for
presently that hideous thud, thud, thud, thud had grown quite dim and
vague somewhere astern and I could no longer see the derelict, for
the night had come down tremendously dark and all the sky was thick,
overset with heavy clouds. As we drew nearer and nearer to the edge
of the scum, the boat moved more and more perceptibly, until suddenly
we emerged with a clean, sweet, fresh sound into the open sea.</p>

<p>"'Thank God!' I said aloud, and drew in the boathook, and made my
way aft again to where Captain Gannington now sat once more at the
tiller. I saw him looking anxiously up at the sky and across to where
the lights of our vessel burned, and again he would seem to listen
intently, so that I found myself listening also.</p>

<p>"'What's that, Captain?' I said sharply; for it seemed to me that
I heard a sound far astern, something, between a queer whine and a
low whistling. 'What's that?'</p>

<p>"'It's wind, doctor.' he said in a low voice. 'I wish to God we
were aboard.' Then to the men: 'Pull! Put y'r backs into it, or ye'll
never put y'r teeth through good bread again!' The men obeyed nobly,
and we reached the vessel safely, and had the boat safely stowed
before the storm came, which it did in a furious white smother out of
the west. I could see it for some minutes beforehand, tearing the sea
in the gloom into a wall of phosphorescent foam; and as it came
nearer, that peculiar whining, piping sound grew louder and louder,
until it was like a vast steam whistle rushing towards us. And when
it did come, we got it very heavy indeed, so that the morning showed
us nothing but a welter of white seas, with that grim derelict many a
score of miles away in the smother, lost as utterly as our hearts
could wish to lose her.</p>

<p>"When I came to examine the second mate's feet, I found them in a
very extraordinary condition. The soles of them had the appearance of
having been partly digested. I know of no other word that so exactly
describes their condition, and the agony the man suffered must have
been dreadful.</p>

<p>"Now," concluded the doctor, "that is what I call a case in point.
If we could know exactly what the old vessel had originally been
loaded with, and the juxtaposition of the various articles of her
cargo, plus the heat and time she had endured, plus one or two other
only guessable quantities, we should have solved the chemistry of the
life-force, gentlemen. Not necessarily the origin, mind you; but, at
least, we should have taken a big step on the way. I've often
regretted that gale, you know--in a way, that is, in a way. It was a
most amazing discovery, but at the same time I had nothing but
thankfulness to be rid of it. A most amazing chance. I often think of
the way the monster woke out of its torpor. And that scum! The dead
pigs caught in it! I fancy that was a grim kind of a net, gentlemen.
It caught many things. It--"</p>

<p>The old doctor sighed and nodded.</p>

<p>"If I could have had her bill of lading," he said, his eyes full
of regret. "If---It might have told me something to help. But,
anyway--" He began to fill his pipe again. "I suppose," he ended,
looking round at us gravely, "I s'pose we humans are an ungrateful
lot of beggars at the best! But--but, what a chance? What a chance,
eh?"</p>

<h2><a name="c6"></a>Out of the Storm</h2>

<p>"Hush!" said my friend the scientist, as I walked into his
laboratory. I had opened my lips to speak; but stood silent for a few
minutes at his request.</p>

<p>He was sitting at his instrument, and the thing was tapping out a
message in a curiously irregular fashion--stopping a few seconds,
then going on at a furious pace.</p>

<p>It was during a somewhat longer than usual pause that, growing
slightly impatient, I ventured to address him.</p>

<p>"Anything important?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, shut up!" he answered back in a high, strained
voice.</p>

<p>I stared. I am used to pretty abrupt treatment from him at times
when he is much engrossed in some particular experiment; but this was
going a little too far, and I said so.</p>

<p>He was writing, and, for reply, he pushed several loosely-written
sheets over to me with the one curt word, "Read!"</p>

<p>With a sense half of anger, half of curiosity, I picked up the
first and glanced at it. After a few lines, I was gripped and held
securely by a morbid interest. I was reading a message from one in
the last extremity. I will give it word for word:---"John, we are
sinking! I wonder if you really understand what I feel at the present
time--you sitting comfortably in your laboratory, I out here upon the
waters, already one among the dead. Yes, we are doomed. There is no
such thing as help in our case. We are sinking--steadily,
remorselessly. God! I must keep up and be a man! I need not tell you
that I am in the operator's room. All the rest are on deck--or dead
in the hungry thing which is smashing the ship to pieces.</p>

<p>"I do not know where we are, and there is no one of whom I can
ask. The last of the officers was drowned nearly an hour ago, and the
vessel is now little more than a sort of breakwater for the giant
seas.</p>

<p>"Once, about half an hour ago, I went out on to the deck. My God!
the sight was terrible. It is a little after midday: but the sky is
the color of mud--do you understand?--gray mud! Down from it there
hang vast lappets of clouds. Not such clouds as I have ever before
seen; but monstrous, mildewed-looking hulls. They show solid, save
where the frightful wind tears their lower edges into great feelers
that swirl savagely above us, like the tentacles of some enormous
Horror.</p>

<p>"Such a sight is difficult to describe to the living; though the
Dead of the Sea know of it without words of mine. It is such a sight
that none is allowed to see and live. It is a picture for the doomed
and the dead; one of the sea's hell-orgies--one of the Thing's
monstrous gloatings over the living--say the alive-in-death, those
upon the brink. I have no right to tell of it to you; to speak of it
to one of the living is to initiate innocence into one of the
infernal mysteries--to talk of foul things to a child. Yet I care
not! I will expose, in all its hideous nakedness, the death-side of
the sea. The undoomed living shall know some of the things that death
has hitherto so well guarded. Death knows not of this little
instrument beneath my hands that connects me still with the quick,
else would he haste to quiet me.</p>

<p>"Hark you, John! I have learnt undreamt of things in this little
time of waiting. I know now why we are afraid of the dark. I had
never imagined such secrets of the sea and the grave (which are one
and the same).</p>

<p>"Listen! Ah, but I was forgetting you cannot hear! I can! The Sea
is--Hush! the Sea is laughing, as though Hell cackled from the mouth
of an ass. It is jeering. I can hear its voice echo like Satanic
thunder amid the mud overhead--It is calling to me! call--I must
go---The sea calls!</p>

<p>"Oh! God, art Thou indeed God? Canst Thou sit above and watch
calmly that which I have just seen? Nay! Thou art no God! Thou art
weak and puny beside this foul Thing which Thou didst create in Thy
lusty youth. It is now God--and I am one of its children.</p>

<p>"Are you there, John? Why don't you answer! Listen! I ignore God;
for there is a stronger than He. My God is here, beside me, around
me, and will be soon above me. You know what that means. It is
merciless. The sea is now all the God there is! That is one of the
things I have learnt.</p>

<p>"Listen! it, is laughing again. God is it, not He.</p>

<p>"It called, and I went out on to the decks. All was terrible. It
is in the waist--everywhere. It has swamped the ship. Only the
forecastle, bridge and poop stick up out from the bestial, reeking
Thing, like three islands in the midst of shrieking foam. At times
gigantic billows assail the ship from both sides. They form momentary
arches above the vessel--arches of dull, curved water half a hundred
feet towards the hideous sky. Then they descend--roaring. Think of
it! You cannot.</p>

<p>"There is an infection of sin in the air: it is the exhalations
from the Thing. Those left upon the drenched islets of shattered wood
and iron are doing the most horrible things. The Thing is teaching
them. Later, I felt the vile informing of its breath; but I have fled
back here--to pray for death.</p>

<p>"On the forecastle, I saw a mother and her little son clinging to
an iron rail. A great billow heaved up above them--descended in a
falling mountain of brine. It passed, and they were still there. The
Thing was only toying with them; yet, all the same, it had torn the
hands of the child from the rail, and the child was clinging
frantically to its Mother's arm. I saw another vast hill hurl up to
port and hover above them. Then the Mother stooped and bit like a
foul beast at the hands of her wee son. She was afraid that his
little additional weight would be more than she could hold. I heard
his scream even where I stood--it drove to me upon that wild
laughter. It told me again that God is not He, but It. Then the hill
thundered down upon those two. It seemed to me that the Thing gave a
bellow as it leapt. It roared about them churning and growling; then
surged away, and there was only one--the Mother. There appeared to me
to be blood as well as water upon her face, especially about her
mouth; but the distance was too great, and I cannot be sure. I looked
away. Close to me, I saw something further--a beautiful young girl
(her soul hideous with the breath of the Thing) struggling with her
sweetheart for the shelter of the charthouse side. He threw her off;
but she came back at him. I saw her hand come from her head, where
still clung the wreckage of some form of headgear. She struck at him.
He shouted and fell away to lee-ward, and she--smiled, showing her
teeth. So much for that. I turned elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Out upon the Thing, I saw gleams, horrid and suggestive, below H
the crests of the waves. I have never seen them until this time. I
saw a rough sailorman washed away from the vessel. One of the huge
breakers snapped at him!--Those things were teeth. It has teeth. I
heard them clash. I heard his yell. It was no more than a mosquito's
shrilling amid all that laughter: but it was very terrible. There is
worse than death.</p>

<p>"The ship is lurching very queerly with a sort of sickening
heave"--"I fancy I have been asleep. No--I remember now. I hit my
head when she rolled so strangely."</p>

<p>"My leg is doubled under me. I think it is broken; but it does not
matter--"</p>

<p>"I have been praying. I--I--What was it? I feel calmer, more
resigned, now. I think I have been mad. What was it that I was
saying? I cannot remember. It was something about--about---God. I--I
believe I blasphemed. May He forgive me! Thou knowest, God, that I
was not in my right mind. Thou knowest that I am very weak. Be with
me in the coming time! I have sinned: but Thou art all merciful.</p>

<p>"Are you there, John? It is very near the end now. I had so much
to say; but it all slips from me. What was it that I said? I take it
all back. I was mad, and--and God knows. He is merciful, and I have
very little pain now. I feel a bit drowsy."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you are there, John. Perhaps, after all, no one
has heard the things I have said. It is better so. The Living are not
meant--and yet, I do not know. If you are there, John, you will--you
will tell her how it was; but not--not--Hark! there was such a
thunder of water overhead just then. I fancy two vast seas have met
in mid-air across the top of the bridge and burst all over the
vessel. It must be soon now--and there was such a number of things I
had to say! I can hear voices in the wind. They are singing. It is
like an enormous dirge--I think I have been dozing again. I pray God
humbly that it be soon! You will not--not tell her anything about,
about what I may have said, will you, John? I mean those things which
I ought not to have said. What was it I did say? My head is growing
strangely confused. I wonder whether you really do hear me. I may be
talking only to that vast roar outside. Still, it is some comfort to
go on, and I will not believe that you do not hear all I say. Hark
again! A mountain of brine must have swept clean over the vessel. She
has gone right over on to her side... She is back again. It will be
very soon now--"</p>

<p>"Are you there, John? Are you there? It is coming! The Sea has
come for me! It is rushing down through the companionway! It--it is
like a vast jet! My God! I am dr-own-ing! I--am--dr--"</p>

<h2><a name="c7"></a>The Baumoff Explosive</h2>

<p>Dally, Whitlaw and I were discussing the recent stupendous
explosion which had occurred in the vicinity of Berlin. We were
marvelling concerning the extraordinary period of darkness that had
followed, and which had aroused so much newspaper comment, with
theories galore.</p>

<p>The papers had got hold of the fact that the War Authorities had
been experimenting with a new explosive, invented by a certain
chemist, named Baumoff, and they referred to it constantly as "The
New Baumoff Explosive".</p>

<p>We were in the Club, and the fourth man at our table was John
Stafford, who was professionally a medical man, but privately in the
Intelligence Department. Once or twice, as we talked, I had glanced
at Stafford, wishing to fire a question at him; for he had been
acquainted with Baumoff. But I managed to hold my tongue; for I knew
that if I asked out pointblank, Stafford (who's a good sort, but a
bit of an ass as regards his almost ponderous code-of-silence) would
be just as like as not to say that it was a subject upon which he
felt he was not entitled to speak.</p>

<p>Oh, I know the old donkey's way; and when he had once said that,
we might just make up our minds never to get another word out of him
on the matter as long as we lived. Yet, I was satisfied to notice
that he seemed a bit restless, as if he were on the itch to shove in
his oar; by which I guessed that the papers we were quoting had got
things very badly muddled indeed, in some way or other, at least as
regarded his friend Baumoff. Suddenly, he spoke:</p>

<p>"What unmitigated, wicked piffle!" said Stafford, quite warm. "I
tell you it is wicked, this associating of Baumoff's name with war
inventions and such horrors. He was the most intensely poetical and
earnest follower of the Christ that I have ever met; and it is just
the brutal Irony of Circumstance that has attempted to use one of the
products of his genius for a purpose of Destruction. But you'll find
they won't be able to use it, in spite of their having got hold of
Baumoff's formula. As an explosive it is not practicable. It is,
shall I say, too impartial; there is no way of controlling it.</p>

<p>"I know more about it, perhaps, than any man alive; for I was
Baumoff's greatest friend, and when he died, I lost the best comrade
a man ever had. I need make no secret about it to you chaps. I was
'on duty' in Berlin, and I was deputed to get in touch with Baumoff.
The government had long had an eye on him; he was an Experimental
Chemist, you know, and altogether too jolly clever to ignore. But
there was no need to worry about him. I got to know him, and we
became enormous friends; for I soon found that he would never turn
his abilities towards any new war-contrivance; and so, you see, I was
able to enjoy my friendship with him, with a comfy conscience--a
thing our chaps are not always able to do in their friendships. Oh, I
tell you, it's a mean, sneaking, treacherous sort of business, ours;
though it's necessary; just as some odd man, or other, has to be a
hangsman. There's a number of unclean jobs to be done to keep the
Social Machine running!</p>

<p>"I think Baumoff was the most enthusiastic intelligent believer in
Christ that it will be ever possible to produce. I learned that he
was compiling and evolving a treatise of most extraordinary and
convincing proofs in support of the more inexplicable things
concerning the life and death of Christ. He was, when I became
acquainted with him, concentrating his attention particularly upon
endeavouring to show that the Darkness of the Cross, between the
sixth and the ninth hours, was a very real thing, possessing a
tremendous significance. He intended at one sweep to smash utterly
all talk of a timely thunderstorm or any of the other more or less
inefficient theories which have been brought forward from time to
time to explain the occurrence away as being a thing of no particular
significance.</p>

<p>"Baumoff had a pet aversion, an atheistic Professor of Physics,
named Hautch, who--using the 'marvellous' element of the life and
death of Christ, as a fulcrum from which to attack Baumoff's
theories--smashed at him constantly, both in his lectures and in
print. Particularly did he pour bitter unbelief upon Baumoff's
upholding that the Darkness of the Cross was anything more than a
gloomy hour or two, magnified into blackness by the emotional
inaccuracy of the Eastern mind and tongue.</p>

<p>"One evening, some time after our friendship had become very real,
I called on Baumoff, and found him in a state of tremendous
indignation over some article of the Professor's which attacked him
brutally; using his theory of the Significance of the 'Darkness', as
a target. Poor Baumoff! It was certainly a marvellously clever
attack; the attack of a thoroughly trained, well-balanced Logician.
But Baumoff was something more; he was Genius. It is a title few have
any rights to; but it was his!</p>

<p>"He talked to me about his theory, telling me that he wanted to
show me a small experiment, presently, bearing out his opinions. In
his talk, he told me several things that interested me extremely.
Having first reminded me of the fundamental fact that light is
conveyed to the eye through the means of that indefinable medium,
named the &AElig;ther. He went a step further, and pointed out to me
that, from an aspect which more approached the primary, Light was a
vibration of the &AElig;ther, of a certain definite number of waves
per second, which possessed the power of producing upon our retina
the sensation which we term Light.</p>

<p>"To this, I nodded; being, as of course is everyone, acquainted
with so well-known a statement. From this, he took a quick, mental
stride, and told me that an ineffably vague, but measurable,
darkening of the atmosphere (greater or smaller according to the
personality-force of the individual) was always evoked in the
immediate vicinity of the human, during any period of great emotional
stress.</p>

<p>"Step by step, Baumoff showed me how his research had led him to
the conclusion that this queer darkening (a million times too subtle
to be apparent to the eye) could be produced only through something
which had power to disturb or temporally interrupt or break up the
Vibration of Light. In other words, there was, at any time of unusual
emotional activity, some disturbance of the &AElig;ther in the
immediate vicinity of the person suffering, which had some effect
upon the Vibration of Light, interrupting it, and producing the
aforementioned infinitely vague darkening.</p>

<p>"'Yes?' I said, as he paused, and looked at me, as if expecting me
to have arrived at a certain definite deduction through his remarks.
'Go on.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'don't you see, the subtle darkening around the
person suffering, is greater or less, according to the personality of
the suffering human. Don't you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh!' I said, with a little gasp of astounded comprehension, 'I
see what you mean. You--you mean that if the agony of a person of
ordinary personality can produce a faint disturbance of the
&AElig;ther, with a consequent faint darkening, then the Agony of
Christ, possessed of the Enormous Personality of the Christ, would
produce a terrific disturbance of the &AElig;ther, and therefore, it
might chance, of the Vibration of Light, and that this is the true
explanation of the Darkness of the Cross; and that the fact of such
an extraordinary and apparently unnatural and improbable Darkness
having been recorded is not a thing to weaken the Marvel of Christ.
But one more unutterably wonderful, infallible proof of His God-like
power? Is that it? Is it? Tell me?'</p>

<p>"Baumoff just rocked on his chair with delight, beating one fist
into the palm of his other hand, and nodding all the time to my
summary. How he loved to be understood; as the Searcher always craves
to be understood.</p>

<p>"'And now,' he said, 'I'm going to show you something.'</p>

<p>"He took a tiny, corked test-tube out of his waistcoat pocket, and
emptied its contents (which consisted of a single, grey-white grain,
about twice the size of an ordinary pin's head) on to his dessert
plate. He crushed it gently to powder with the ivory handle of a
knife, then damped it gently, with a single minim of what I supposed
to be water, and worked it up into a tiny patch of grey-white paste.
He then took out his gold tooth-pick, and thrust it into the flame of
a small chemist's spirit lamp, which had been lit since dinner as a
pipe-lighter. He held the gold tooth-pick in the flame, until the
narrow, gold blade glowed whitehot.</p>

<p>"'Now look!' he said, and touched the end of the tooth-pick
against the infinitesmal patch upon the dessert plate. There came a
swift little violet flash, and suddenly I found that I was staring at
Baumoff through a sort of transparent darkness, which faded swiftly
into a black opaqueness. I thought at first this must be the
complementary effect of the flash upon the retina. But a minute
passed, and we were still in that extraordinary darkness.</p>

<p>"'My Gracious! Man! What is it?' I asked, at last.</p>

<p>"His voice explained then, that he had produced, through the
medium of chemistry, an exaggerated effect which simulated, to some
extent, the disturbance in the &AElig;ther produced by waves thrown
off by any person during an emotional crisis or agony. The waves, or
vibrations, sent out by his experiment produced only a partial
simulation of the effect he wished to show me--merely the temporary
interruption of the Vibration of Light, with the resulting darkness
in which we both now sat.</p>

<p>"'That stuff,' said Baumoff, 'would be a tremendous explosive,
under certain conditions.'"</p>

<p>I heard him puffing at his pipe, as he spoke, but instead of the
glow of the pipe shining out visible and red, there was only a faint
glare that wavered and disappeared in the most extraordinary
fashion.</p>

<p>"'My Goodness!' I said, 'when's this going away?' And I stared
across the room to where the big kerosene lamp showed only as a
faintly glimmering patch in the gloom; a vague light that shivered
and flashed oddly, as though I saw it through an immense gloomy depth
of dark and disturbed water.</p>

<p>"It's all right,' Baumoff's voice said from out of the darkness.
'It's going now; in five minutes the disturbance will have quieted,
and the waves of light will flow off evenly from the lamp in their
normal fashion. But, whilst we're waiting, isn't it immense,
eh?'"</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said. 'It's wonderful; but it's rather unearthly, you
know.'"</p>

<p>"'Oh, but I've something much finer to show you,' he said. 'The
real thing. Wait another minute. The darkness is going. See! You can
see the light from the lamp now quite plainly. It looks as if it were
submerged in a boil of waters, doesn't it? that are growing clearer
and clearer and quieter and quieter all the time.'</p>

<p>"It was as he said; and we watched the lamp, silently, until all
signs of the disturbance of the light-carrying medium had ceased.
Then Baumoff faced me once more.</p>

<p>"'Now,' he said. 'You've seen the somewhat casual effects of just
crude combustion of that stuff of mine. I'm going to show you the
effects of combusting it in the human furnace, that is, in my own
body; and then, you'll see one of the great wonders of Christ's death
reproduced on a miniature scale.'</p>

<p>"He went across to the mantelpiece, and returned with a small, 120
minim glass and another of the tiny, corked test-tubes, containing a
single grey-white grain of his chemical substance. He uncorked the
test-tube, and shook the grain of substance into the minim glass, and
then, with a glass stirring-rod, crushed it up in the bottom of the
glass, adding water, drop by drop as he did so, until there were
sixty minims in the glass.</p>

<p>"'Now!' he said, and lifting it, he drank the stuff. 'We will give
it thirty-five minutes,' he continued; 'then, as carbonization
proceeds, you will find my pulse will increase, as also the
respiration, and presently there will come the darkness again, in the
subtlest, strangest fashion; but accompanied now by certain physical
and psychic phenomena, which will be owing to the fact that the
vibrations it will throw off, will be blent into what I might call
the emotional-vibrations, which I shall give off in my distress.
These will be enormously intensified, and you will possibly
experience an extraordinarily interesting demonstration of the
soundness of my more theoretical reasonings. I tested it by myself
last week' (He waved a bandaged finger at me), 'and I read a paper to
the Club on the results. They are very enthusiastic, and have
promised their co-operation in the big demonstration I intend to give
on next Good Friday--that's seven weeks off, to-day.'</p>

<p>"He had ceased smoking; but continued to talk quietly in this
fashion for the next thirty-five minutes. The Club to which he had
referred was a peculiar association of men, banded together under the
presidentship of Baumoff himself, and having for their appellation
the title of--so well as I can translate it--'The Believers And
Provers Of Christ'. If I may say so, without any thought of
irreverence, they were, many of them, men fanatically crazed to
uphold the Christ. You will agree later, I think, that I have not
used an incorrect term, in describing the bulk of the members of this
extraordinary club, which was, in its way, well worthy of one of the
religio-maniacal extrudences which have been forced into temporary
being by certain of the more religiously-emotional minded of our
cousins across the water.</p>

<p>"Baumoff looked at the clock; then held out his wrist to me. 'Take
my pulse,' he said, 'it's rising fast. Interesting data, you
know.'</p>

<p>"I nodded, and drew out my watch. I had noticed that his
respirations were increasing; and I found his pulse running evenly
and strongly at 105. Three minutes later, it had risen to 175, and
his respirations to 41. In a further three minutes, I took his pulse
again, and found it running at 203, but with the rhythm regular. His
respirations were then 49. He had, as I knew, excellent lungs, and
his heart was sound. His lungs, I may say, were of exceptional
capacity, and there was at this stage no marked dyspnoea. Three
minutes later I found the pulse to be 227, and the respiration
54.</p>

<p>"'You've plenty of red corpuscles, Baumoff!' I said. 'But I hope
you're not going to overdo things.'</p>

<p>"He nodded at me, and smiled; but said nothing. Three minutes
later, when I took the last pulse, it was 233, and the two sides of
the heart were sending out unequal quantities of blood, with an
irregular rhythm. The respiration had risen to 67 and was becoming
shallow and ineffectual, and dyspnoea was becoming very marked. The
small amount of arterial blood leaving the left side of the heart
betrayed itself in the curious bluish and white tinge of the
face.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff!' I said, and began to remonstrate; but he checked me,
with a queerly invincible gesture.</p>

<p>"'It's all right!' he said, breathlessly, with a little note of
impatience. 'I know what I'm doing all the time. You must remember I
took the same degree as you in medicine.'</p>

<p>"It was quite true. I remembered then that he had taken his M.D.
in London; and this in addition to half a dozen other degrees in
different branches of the sciences in his own country. And then, even
as the memory reassured me that he was not acting in ignorance of the
possible danger, he called out in a curious, breathless voice:</p>

<p>"'The Darkness! It's beginning. Take note of every single thing.
Don't bother about me. I'm all right!'</p>

<p>"I glanced swiftly round the room. It was as he had said. I
perceived it now. There appeared to be an extraordinary quality of
gloom growing in the atmosphere of the room. A kind of bluish gloom,
vague, and scarcely, as yet, affecting the transparency of the
atmosphere to light.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, Baumoff did something that rather sickened me. He drew
his wrist away from me, and reached out to a small metal box, such as
one sterilizes a hypodermic in. He opened the box, and took out four
rather curious looking drawing-pins, I might call them, only they had
spikes of steel fully an inch long, whilst all around the rim of the
heads (which were also of steel) there projected downward, parallel
with the central spike, a number of shorter spikes, maybe an eighth
of an inch long.</p>

<p>"He kicked off his pumps; then stooped and slipped his socks off,
and I saw that he was wearing a pair of linen inner-socks.</p>

<p>"'Antiseptic!' he said, glancing at me. 'Got my feet ready before
you came. No use running unnecessary risks.' He gasped as he spoke.
Then he took one of the curious little steel spikes.</p>

<p>"'I've sterilized them,' he said; and therewith, with
deliberation, he pressed it in up to the head into his foot between
the second and third branches of the dorsal artery.</p>

<p>"'For God's sake, what are you doing!' I said, half rising from my
chair.</p>

<p>"'Sit down!' he said, in a grim sort of voice. 'I can't have any
interference. I want you simply to observe; keep note of everything.
You ought to thank me for the chance, instead of worrying me, when
you know I shall go my own way all the time.'</p>

<p>"As he spoke, he had pressed in the second of the steel spikes up
to the hilt in his left instep, taking the same precaution to avoid
the arteries. Not a groan had come from him; only his face betrayed
the effect of this additional distress.</p>

<p>"'My dear chap!' he said, observing my upsetness. 'Do be sensible.
I know exactly what I'm doing. There simply must be distress, and the
readiest way to reach that condition is through physical pain.' His
speech had becomes a series of spasmodic words, between gasps, and
sweat lay in great clear drops upon his lip and forehead. He slipped
off his belt and proceeded to buckle it round both the back of his
chair and his waist; as if he expected to need some support from
falling.</p>

<p>"'It's wicked!' I said. Baumoff made an attempt to shrug his
heaving shoulders, that was, in its way, one of the most piteous
things that I have seen, in its sudden laying bare of the agony that
the man was making so little of.</p>

<p>"He was now cleaning the palms of his hands with a little sponge,
which he dipped from time to time in a cup of solution. I knew what
he was going to do, and suddenly he jerked out, with a painful
attempt to grin, an explanation of his bandaged finger. He had held
his finger in the flame of the spirit lamp, during his previous
experiment; but now, as he made clear in gaspingly uttered words, he
wished to simulate as far as possible the actual conditions of the
great scene that he had so much in mind. He made it so clear to me
that we might expect to experience something very extraordinary, that
I was conscious of a sense of almost superstitious nervousness.</p>

<p>"'I wish you wouldn't, Baumoff!' I said.</p>

<p>"'Don't--be--silly!' he managed to say. But the two latter words
were more groans than words; for between each, he had thrust home
right to the heads in the palms of his hands the two remaining steel
spikes. He gripped his hands shut, with a sort of spasm of savage
determination, and I saw the point of one of the spikes break through
the back of his hand, between the extensor tendons of the second and
third fingers. A drop of blood beaded the point of the spike. I
looked at Baumoff's face; and he looked back steadily at me.</p>

<p>"'No interference,' he managed to ejaculate. 'I've not gone
through all this for nothing. I know--what--I'm doing. Look--it's
coming. Take note--everything!'</p>

<p>"He relapsed into silence, except for his painful gasping. I
realised that I must give way, and I stared round the room, with a
peculiar commingling of an almost nervous discomfort and a stirring
of very real and sober curiosity.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said Baumoff, after a moment's silence, 'something's going
to happen. I can tell. Oh, wait--till I--I have my--big
demonstration. I'll show that brute Hautch."</p>

<p>"I nodded; but I doubt that he saw me; for his eyes had a
distinctly in-turned look, the iris was rather relaxed. I glanced
away round the room again; there was a distinct occasional breaking
up of the light-rays from the lamp, giving a coming-and-going
effect.</p>

<p>"The atmosphere of the room was also quite plainly darker--heavy,
with an extraordinary sense of gloom. The bluish tint was
unmistakably more in evidence; but there was, as yet, none of that
opacity which we had experienced before, upon simple combustion,
except for the occasional, vague coming-and-going of the
lamp-light.</p>

<p>"Baurnoff began to speak again, getting his words out between
gasps. 'Th'--this dodge of mine gets the--pain into the--the--right
place. Right association of--of ideas--emotions--for--best--results.
You follow me? Parallelising things--as--much as--possible. Fixing
whole attention--on the--the death scene--'</p>

<p>"He gasped painfully for a few moments. 'We demonstrate truth
of--of The Darkening; but--but there's psychic effect to be--looked
for, through--results of parallelisation of--conditions. May have
extraordinary simulation of--the actual thing. Keep note. Keep note.'
Then, suddenly, with a clear, spasmodic burst: 'My God, Stafford,
keep note of everything. Something's going to happen.
Something--wonderful--Promise not--to bother me. I know--what I'm
doing.'</p>

<p>"Baurnoff ceased speaking, with a gasp, and there was only the
labour of his breathing in the quietness of the room. As I stared at
him, halting from a dozen things I needed to say, I realised suddenly
that I could no longer see him quite plainly; a sort of wavering in
the atmosphere, between us, made him seem momentarily unreal. The
whole room had darkened perceptibly in the last thirty seconds; and
as I stared around, I realised that there was a constant invisible
swirl in the fast-deepening, extraordinary blue gloom that seemed now
to permeate everything. When I looked at the lamp, alternate
flashings of light and blue--darkness followed each other with an
amazing swiftness.</p>

<p>"'My God!' I heard Baumoff whispering in the half-darkness, as if
to himself, 'how did Christ bear the nails!'</p>

<p>"I stared across at him, with an infinite discomfort, and an
irritated pity troubling me; but I knew it was no use to remonstrate
now. I saw him vaguely distorted through the wavering tremble of the
atmosphere. It was somewhat as if I looked at him through
convolutions of heated air; only there were marvellous waves of
blue-blackness making gaps in my sight. Once I saw his face clearly,
full of an infinite pain, that was somehow, seemingly, more spiritual
than physical, and dominating everything was an expression of
enormous resolution and concentration, making the livid, sweat-damp,
agonized face somehow heroic and splendid.</p>

<p>"And then, drenching the room with waves and splashes of
opaqueness, the vibration of his abnormally stimulated agony finally
broke up the vibration of Light. My last, swift glance round, showed
me, as it seemed, the invisible aether boiling and eddying in a
tremendous fashion; and, abruptly, the flame of the lamp was lost in
an extraordinary swirling patch of light, that marked its position
for several moments, shimmering and deadening, shimmering and
deadening; until, abruptly, I saw neither that glimmering patch of
light, nor anything else. I was suddenly lost in a black opaqueness
of night, through which came the fierce, painful breathing of
Baumoff.</p>

<p>"A full minute passed; but so slowly that, if I had not been
counting Baumoff's respirations, I should have said that it was five.
Then Baumoff spoke suddenly, in a voice that was, somehow, curiously
changed--a certain toneless note in it:</p>

<p>"'My God!' he said, from out of the darkness, 'what must Christ
have suffered!'</p>

<p>"It was in the succeeding silence, that I had the first
realisation that I was vaguely afraid; but the feeling was too
indefinite and unfounded, and I might say subconscious, for me to
face it out. Three minutes passed, whilst I counted the almost
desperate respirations that came to me through the darkness. Then
Baumoff began to speak again, and still in that peculiarly altering
voice:</p>

<p>"'By Thy Agony and Bloody Sweat,' he muttered. Twice he repeated
this. It was plain indeed that he had fixed his whole attention with
tremendous intensity, in his abnormal state, upon the death
scene.</p>

<p>"The effect upon me of his intensity was interesting and in some
ways extraordinary. As well as I could, I analysed my sensations and
emotions and general state of mind, and realised that Baumoff was
producing an effect upon me that was almost hypnotic.</p>

<p>"Once, partly because I wished to get my level by the aid of a
normal remark, and also because I was suddenly newly anxious by a
change in the breathsounds, I asked Baumoff how he was. My voice
going with a peculiar and really uncomfortable blankness through that
impenetrable blackness of opacity.</p>

<p>"He said: 'Hush! I'm carrying the Cross.' And, do you know, the
effect of those simple words, spoken in that new, toneless voice, in
that atmosphere of almost unbearable tenseness, was so powerful that,
suddenly, with eyes wide open, I saw Baumoff clear and vivid against
that unnatural darkness, carrying a Cross. Not, as the picture is
usually shown of the Christ, with it crooked over the shoulder; but
with the Cross gripped just under the cross-piece in his arms, and
the end trailing behind, along rocky ground. I saw even the pattern
of the grain of the rough wood, where some of the bark had been
ripped away; and under the trailing end there was a tussock of tough
wire-grass, that had been uprooted by the lowing end, and dragged and
ground along upon the rocks, between the end of the Cross and the
rocky ground. I can see the thing now, as I speak. Its vividness was
extraordinary; but it had come and gone like a flash, and I was
sitting there in the darkness, mechanically counting the
respirations; yet unaware that I counted.</p>

<p>"As I sat there, it came to me suddenly--the whole entire marvel
of the thing that Baumoff had achieved. I was sitting there in a
darkness which was an actual reproduction of the miracle of the
Darkness of the Cross. In short, Baumoff had, by producing in himself
an abnormal condition, developed an Energy of Emotion that must have
almost, in its effects, paralleled the Agony of the Cross. And in so
doing, he had shown from an entirely new and wonderful point, the
indisputable truth of the stupendous personality and the enormous
spiritual force of the Christ. He had evolved and made practical to
the average understanding a proof that would make to live again the
reality of that wonder of the world--CHRIST. And for all this, I had
nothing but admiration of an almost stupefied kind.</p>

<p>"But, at this point, I felt that the experiment should stop. I had
a strangely nervous craving for Baumoff to end it right there and
then, and not to try to parallel the psychic conditions. I had, even
then, by some queer aid of sub-conscious suggestion, a vague
reaching-out-towards the danger of "monstrosity" being induced,
instead of any actual knowledge gained.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff!' I said. 'Stop it.'"</p>

<p>"But he made no reply, and for some minutes there followed a
silence, that was unbroken, save by his gasping breathing. Abruptly,
Baumoff said, between his gasps: 'Woman--behold--thy--son.' He
muttered this several times, in the same uncomfortably toneless voice
in which he had spoken since the darkness became complete.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff.' I said again. 'Baumoff! Stop it.'" And as I listened
for his answer, I was relieved to think that his breathing was less
shallow. The abnormal demand for oxygen was evidently being met, and
the extravagant call upon the heart's efficiency was being
relaxed.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff!' I said, once more. 'Baumoff! Stop it!'"</p>

<p>"And, as I spoke, abruptly, I thought the room was shaken a
little.</p>

<p>"Now, I had already as you will have realised, been vaguely
conscious of a peculiar and growing nervousness. I think that is the
word that best describes it, up to this moment. At this curious
little shake that seemed to stir through the utterly dark room, I was
suddenly more than nervous. I felt a thrill of actual and literal
fear; yet with no sufficient cause of reason to justify me; so that,
after sitting very tense for some long minutes, and feeling nothing
further, I decided that I needed to take myself in hand, and keep a
firmer grip upon my nerves. And then, just as I had arrived at this
more comfortable state of mind, the room was shaken again, with the
most curious and sickening oscillatory movement, that was beyond all
comfort of denial.</p>

<p>"'My God!' I whispered. And then, with a sudden effort of courage,
I called: 'Baumoff! For God's sake stop it."</p>

<p>"You've no idea of the effort it took to speak aloud into that
darkness; and when I did speak, the sound of my voice set me afresh
on edge. It went so empty and raw across the room; and somehow, the
room seemed to be incredibly big. Oh, I wonder whether you realise
how beastly I felt, without my having to make any further effort to
tell you.</p>

<p>"And Baumoff never answered a word; but I could hear him
breathing, a little fuller; though still heaving his thorax
painfully, in his need for air. The incredible shaking of the room
eased away; and there succeeded a spasm of quiet, in which I felt
that it was my duty to get up and step across to Baumoffs chair. But
I could not do it. Somehow, I would not have touched Baumoff then for
any cause whatever. Yet, even in that moment, as now I know, I was
not aware that I was afraid to touch Baumoff.</p>

<p>"And then the oscillations commenced again. I felt the seat of my
trousers slide against the seat of my chair, and I thrust out my
legs, spreading my feet against the carpet, to keep me from sliding
off one way or the other on to the floor. To say I was afraid, was
not to describe my state at all. I was terrified. And suddenly, I had
comfort, in the most extraordinary fashion; for a single idea
literally glazed into my brain, and gave me a reason to which to
cling. It was a single line:</p>

<p>"'&AElig;ther, the soul of iron and sundry stuffs' which Baumoff
had once taken as a text for an extraordinary lecture on vibrations,
in the earlier days of our friendship. He had formulated the
suggestion that, in embryo, Matter was, from a primary aspect, a
localised vibration, traversing a closed orbit. These primary
localised vibrations were inconceivably minute. But were capable,
under certain conditions, of combining under the action of
keynote-vibrations into secondary vibrations of a size and shape to
be determined by a multitude of only guessable factors. These would
sustain their new form, so long as nothing occurred to disorganise
their combination or depreciate or divert their energy--their unity
being partially determined by the inertia of the still &AElig;ther
outside of the closed path which their area of activities covered.
And such combination of the primary localised vibrations was neither
more nor less than matter. Men and worlds, aye! and universes.</p>

<p>"And then he had said the thing that struck me most. He had said,
that if it were possible to produce a vibration of the &AElig;ther of
a sufficient energy, it would be possible to disorganise or confuse
the vibration of matter. That, given a machine capable of creating a
vibration of the &AElig;ther of a sufficient energy, he would engage
to destroy not merely the world, but the whole universe itself,
including heaven and hell themselves, if such places existed, and had
such existence in a material form.</p>

<p>"I remember how I looked at him, bewildered by the pregnancy and
scope of his imagination. And now his lecture had come back to me to
help my courage with the sanity of reason. Was it not possible that
the &AElig;ther disturbance which he had produced, had sufficient
energy to cause some disorganisation of the vibration of matter, in
the immediate vicinity, and had thus created a miniature quaking of
the ground all about the house, and so set the house gently
a-shake?</p>

<p>"And then, as this thought came to me, another and a greater,
flashed into my mind. 'My God!' I said out loud into the darkness of
the room. It explains one more mystery of the Cross, the disturbance
of the &AElig;ther caused by Christ's Agony, disorganised the
vibration of matter in the vicinity of the Cross, and there was then
a small local earthquake, which opened the graves, and rent the veil,
possibly by disturbing its supports. And, of course, the earthquake
was an effect, and not a cause, as belittlers of the Christ have
always insisted.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff!' I called. 'Baumoff, you've proved another thing.
Baumoff! Baumoff! Answer me. Are you all right?'</p>

<p>"Baumoff answered, sharp and sudden out of the darkness; but not
to me:</p>

<p>"'My God!' he said. 'My God!' His voice came out at me, a cry of
veritable mental agony. He was suffering, in some hypnotic, induced
fashion, something of the very agony of the Christ Himself.</p>

<p>"'Baumoff!" I shouted, and forced myself to my feet. I heard his
chair clattering, as he sat there and shook. 'Baumoff!'</p>

<p>An extraordinary quake went across the floor of the room, and I
heard a creaking of the woodwork, and something fell and smashed in
the darkness. Baumoffs gasps hurt me; but I stood there. I dared not
go to him. I knew then that I was afraid of him--of his condition, or
something I don't know what. But, oh, I was horribly afraid of
him.</p>

<p>"'Bau--' I began, but suddenly I was afraid even to speak to him.
And I could not move. Abruptly, he cried out in a tone of incredible
anguish:</p>

<p>"'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani!'But the last word changed in his
mouth, from his dreadful hypnotic grief and pain, to a scream of
simply infernal terror.</p>

<p>"And, suddenly, a horrible mocking voice roared out in the room,
from Baumoff's chair: 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani!'</p>

<p>"Do you understand, the voice was not Baumoff's at all. It was not
a voice of despair; but a voice sneering in an incredible, bestial,
monstrous fashion. In the succeeding silence, as I stood in an ice of
fear, I knew that Baumoff no longer gasped. The room was absolutely
silent, the most dreadful and silent place in all this world. Then I
bolted; caught my foot, probably in the invisible edge of the
hearth-rug, and pitched headlong into a blaze of internal
brain-stars. After which, for a very long time, certainly some hours,
I knew nothing of any kind.</p>

<p>"I came back into this Present, with a dreadful headache
oppressing me, to the exclusion of all else. But the Darkness had
dissipated. I rolled over on to my side, and saw Baumoffand forgot
even the pain in my head. He was leaning forward towards me: his eyes
wide open, but dull. His face was enormously swollen, and there was,
somehow, something beastly about him. He was dead, and the belt about
him and the chair-back, alone prevented him from falling forward on
to me. His tongue was thrust out of one corner of his mouth. I shall
always remember how he looked. He was leering, like a human-beast,
more than a man.</p>

<p>"I edged away from him, across the floor; but I never stopped
looking at him, until I had got to the other side of the door, and
closed between us. Of course, I got my balance in a bit, and went
back to him; but there was nothing I could do.</p>

<p>"Baumoff died of heart-failure, of course, obviously! I should
never be so foolish as to suggest to any sane jury that, in his
extraordinary, self-hypnotised, defenseless condition, he was
"entered" by some Christ-apeing Monster of the Void. I've too much
respect for my own claim to be a common-sensible man, to put forward
such an idea with seriousness! Oh, I know I may seem to speak with a
jeer; but what can I do but jeer at myself and all the world, when I
dare not acknowledge, even secretly to myself, what my own thoughts
are. Baumoff did, undoubtedly die of heart-failure; and, for the
rest, how much was I hypnotised into believing. Only, there was over
by the far wall, where it had been shaken down to the floor from a
solidly fastened-up bracket, a little pile of glass that had once
formed a piece of beautiful Venetian glassware. You remember that I
heard something fall, when the room shook. Surely the room did shake?
Oh, I must stop thinking. My head goes round.</p>

<p>"The explosive the papers are talking about. Yes, that's
Baumoff's; that makes it all seem true, doesn't it? They had the
darkness at Berlin, after the explosion. There is no getting away
from that. The Government know only that Baumoff's formulae is
capable of producing the largest quantity of gas, in the shortest
possible time. That, in short, it is ideally explosive. So it is; but
I imagine it will prove an explosive, as I have already said, and as
experience has proved, a little too impartial in its action for it to
create enthusiasm on either side of a battlefield. Perhaps this is
but a mercy, in disguise; certainly a mercy, if Baumoff's theories as
to the possibility of disorganising matter, be anywhere near to the
truth.</p>

<p>"I have thought sometimes that there might be a more normal
explanation of the dreadful thing that happened at the end. Baumoff
may have ruptured a blood-vessel in the brain, owing to the enormous
arterial pressure that his experiment induced; and the voice I heard
and the mockery and the horrible expression and leer may have been
nothing more than the immediate outburst and expression of the
natural "obliqueness" of a deranged mind, which so often turns up a
side of a man's nature and produces an inversion of character, that
is the very complement of his normal state. And certainly, poor
Baumoff's normal religious attitude was one of marvellous reverence
and loyalty towards the Christ.</p>

<p>"Also, in support of this line of explanation, I have frequently
observed that the voice of a person suffering from mental derangement
is frequently wonderfully changed, and has in it often a very
repellant and inhuman quality. I try to think that this explanation
fits the case. But I can never forget that room. Never."</p>

<h2><a name="c8"></a>Jack Grey, Second Mate</h2>

<p>HE stepped aboard from one of the wooden jetties projecting from
the old Longside wharf, where the sailing ships used to lie above
Telegraph Hill, San Francisco. She rejected almost disdainfully the
great hand extended by the second mate to assist her over the
gangway.</p>

<p>The big man flushed somewhat under his tan, but otherwise gave no
sign that he was aware of the semi-unconscious slight. She, on her
part, moved aft daintily to meet the captain's wife, under whose wing
she was to make the passage from Frisco to Baltimore.</p>

<p>At first it seemed as if she were to be the only passenger in the
big steel bark; but, about half an hour before sailing, a second
appeared on the little jetty, accompanied by several bearers carrying
his luggage. These, having dumped their burdens at the outer end of
the gangway, were paid and dismissed; after which the passenger, a
gross, burly-looking man, apparently between forty and forty-five
years of age, made his way aboard.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was no stranger to sea-craft; for without
hesitation, he walked aft and down the companionway. In a few minutes
he returned to the deck. He glanced ashore to where his luggage
remained piled up as he had left it, then went over to where the
second mate was standing by the rail across the break of the
poop.</p>

<p>"Here, you!" he said brusquely, speaking fair English, but with an
unfamiliar accent. "Why don't you get my luggage aboard?"</p>

<p>The second mate turned and glanced down at him from his great
height.</p>

<p>"Were you speaking to me?" he asked quietly. "Certainly I was
addressing you, you--"</p>

<p>He stopped and retreated a pace, for there wassomething in the
eyes of the big officer which quieted him.</p>

<p>"If you will go below I'll have your gear brought aboard," the
second mate told him.</p>

<p>The tone was polished and courteous, but there was still something
in the gray eyes. The passenger glanced uneasily from the eyes to the
great, nervous hand lying, gently clenched, upon the rail. Then,
without a word, he turned and walked aft.</p>

<p>THE Carlyle had been two days at sea, and was running before a
fine breeze of wind. On the poop the second mate was walking up and
down, smoking meditatively. Occasionally he would go to the break and
pass some order to the boatswain, then resume his steady tramp.</p>

<p>Presently, he heard a step on the companion stairs, and, the
moment afterward, saw the lady passenger step out on deck. She was
very white, and walked somewhat unsteadily, as if she were giddy.</p>

<p>She was followed by the captain's wife, carrying a rug and a
couple of cushions. These the good woman proceeded to arrange on the
captain's own deck-chair, after which she steadied the girl to a
sitting position and wrapped the rug around her knees and feet.</p>

<p>Abruptly, in one of his periodic journeys, as the second mate
passed to windward of the place where they were sitting, the voice of
the lady passenger reached him. She was addressing the captain's
wife, but was obviously indifferent whether he heard or not.</p>

<p>"I wish that man would take his horrible pipe somewhere else. The
smell of it makes me quite sick!"</p>

<p>He was aware that the captain's wife was trying to signal to him
behind the girl's back; but he made no sign that he saw. Instead, he
continued his return journey to the break of the poop, with a certain
grimness about the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>Here he proceeded to walk athwartships, instead of fore and aft,
so that now he came nowhere near to the girl whose insolent
fastidiousness had twice irked him. He continued to smoke; for he was
of too big a mind to give way to the smallness of being huffed over
the lady's want of manners. He had removed from her presence the
cause of her annoyance, and, being of a logical disposition, saw no
reason for ceasing to obtain the reasonable enjoyment of his
pipe.</p>

<p>As he made his way to and fro across the planks, he proceeded to
turn the matter over in his own calm way. Evidently she regarded
him--if she thought at all about him--as a kind of upper servant;
this being so, it was absurd to suppose that there was an intentional
rudeness, beyond such as servants are accustomed to receive in their
position of living automata. And here, having occasion to go down on
to the main deck to trim sail, he forgot the matter.</p>

<p>When he returned to the poop, the girl was sitting alone; the
captain's wife having been called below to attend to her husband who
had been ill enough to be confined to his bunk for upward of a
week.</p>

<p>As he passed across the planks, he cast occasional glances aft.
The girl was certainly winsome, and peculiarly attractive, to such a
man as he, in her calm unknowing of his near presence. She was
sitting back in the chair, leaning tiredly and staring full of
thought out across the sea.</p>

<p>A while passed thus, perhaps the half of an hour, and then came
the sound of heavy steps coming up from the saloon. The second mate
recognized them for those of the male passenger; yet the girl did not
seem to notice them. She did not withdraw her gaze from the sea, but
continued to stare, seeming lost in quiet thought.</p>

<p>The man's head appeared out of the companionway, then the clumsy
grossness of his trunk and fat under-limbs. He moved toward her,
stopping within a couple of yards of her chair.</p>

<p>"And how is Miss Eversley?" the second mate heard him ask.</p>

<p>At his voice, the girl started and turned her head swiftly in his
direction.</p>

<p>"You!" That was all she said; but the disgustand the undertone of
something akin to fear were not lost upon the second officer.</p>

<p>"You thought--" began the man in tones of attempted banter.</p>

<p>"I thought I had seen the last of you--forever!" she cut in.</p>

<p>"But you see you were mistaken. If the sickness of the sea hadn't
claimed you for the last two days, you would have discovered earlier
that regret for my absence was wasted."</p>

<p>"Regret!"</p>

<p>"My pretty child--"</p>

<p>"Will you go away! Go away! Go away!" She put out her hands weakly
with a gesture of repulsion.</p>

<p>"Come, come! We shall have to see much of one another during the
next few weeks. Why--"</p>

<p>She was on her feet, swaying giddily. He took a step forward, as
if with an unconscious instinct to bar her passage.</p>

<p>"Let me pass!" she said, with a little gasp.</p>

<p>But he, staring at her with hot eyes, seemed not to have heard
her. She put up a hand to her throat, as if wanting air.</p>

<p>"Allow me to assist you below."</p>

<p>It was the deep voice of the second mate. His naturally somewhat
grave face gave no indication that he was aware of any tensions.</p>

<p>"I will attend to that," said the male passenger insolently.</p>

<p>But the officer seemed to have no knowledge of his existence.
Instead, he guided the lady to the companionway, and then down the
stairs to the saloon. There he left her in the charge of the
captain's wife, telling the latter that the sea air had proved too
much for the young lady.</p>

<p>Returning on deck, he found the passenger standing by the opening
of the companion. He had it in his heart to deal with the person in a
fashion of his own; but the fellow had taken the measure of the big
officer and, though full of repressed rage, took good care to invite
no trouble.</p>

<p>On his part, the second mate resumed his steady tramp of the deck;
but it may be noted that his pipe went out twice, for his thoughts
were upon the girl he had helped below. He was pondering the matter
of her repulsion for the male passenger. It was evident that they had
met elsewhere, probably at the port where the Carlyle had picked them
up. It was even more evident that the girl had no desire to continue
the acquaintance, if it could be named as such.</p>

<p>Upon this, and much more to the same effect, did he meditate. And
so, in due time, the first mate came up to his relief.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>THREE days later, the captain died suddenly, leaving his wife
helpless with grief at her loss. By this time, Miss Eversley had
gathered strength after her bout with seasickness, and now did her
best to comfort the poor woman. Yet the desolate wife would not be
comforted, but took to her bunk as soon as her husband had passed
into the deep, and there stayed, refusing to be companied by any one.
This being so, Miss Eversley was, perforce, left greatly to her own
devices, and her own company; for that of Mr. Pathan, the other
passenger, she avoided in a most determined manner.</p>

<p>This was by no means an easy matter to accomplish, save by staying
in her berth; for did she go upon the poop, the man would, in
defiance of all her entreaties or commands, pursue her with his
hateful attentions. Yet help was to come; for it happened one day
that, the poop being empty save for the man at the wheel, with whom,
however, Pathan seemed curiously familiar, the fellow took advantage
of the opportunity to try to take her hands. He succeeded in grasping
her left, making the remark:</p>

<p>"Don't be so skittish, my pretty. What are your hands, when I am
to have the whole of you?" And he laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>For answer, she tried to pull away from him, but without
success.</p>

<p>"You see, it's no good fighting against me!"</p>

<p>She glanced round, breathlessly, for help and her gaze fell upon
the helmsman, a little, hideous dago who, with an evil grin upon his
face, was watching them. At that, she went all hot with shame and
anger.</p>

<p>"Let go of my hand!"</p>

<p>"I shall not!"</p>

<p>He reached his left out for her right, but she drew it back; and
then, as if with the reflex of the movement, clenched it and struck
him full in the mouth.</p>

<p>"Beast!" she said with a little savage note in her voice.</p>

<p>The man staggered a moment; for the blow had been shrewdly
delivered, and his surprise almostequaled the pain. Then he came back
at her with a rush. The man was no better than some bestial creature
at the moment. He seized her about the neck and the waist.</p>

<p>"---you!" he snarled. "I'll teach--"</p>

<p>But he never finished. A great knuckled hand came between their
faces, splaying itself across his forehead. His sweating visage was
wrenched from hers. A rough, blue-sleeved arm comforted his neck
mightily, tilting his chin heavenward. His grip weakened upon her,
then gave abruptly, and she staggered back dizzily against the mizzen
rigging.</p>

<p>There came a sound of something falling. It was a very long
distance away. She was conscious of the second mate in the immediate
foreground, his back turned to her; and beyond him, her
gross-featured antagonist huddled limply upon the deck. For a moment
neither moved; then the man upon the deck rose shakily, keeping his
eye mateward.</p>

<p>The big officer never stirred, and the passenger began backing to
get the skylight between him and the second mate. He reached the
weather side and paused nervously. Then, and not till then, the
officer turned his back upon him, and, without vouchsafing a glance
in the direction of the girl, walked forward toward the break of the
poop.</p>

<p>As she made to go below, she heard the little steersman mutter
something to the defeated man; and he, now that he was in no instant
danger of annihilation, raised his voice to a blusterous growl. But
the big man?</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>THE fore-hands of the big steel bark Carlyle were a new lot who
had been signed on in Frisco, in place of the outward-bound crew of
Scotch and Welsh sailormen, who had deserted on account of the high
pay ruling in Frisco. The present crowd was composed chiefly of
"Dutchmen," and in each watch, consisting of eight men and a boy,
there were only two Americans, one Englishman and a German. The
remainder were dagoes and mixed breeds.</p>

<p>The two Americans were in the first mate's watch, the Englishman
and the German being with the second's crowd, and the whole lot of
them, white, olive and mixed, were about as hard a "rough-house"
crew, scraped up from the waterfront, as one could find, and
acceptable only because of the aforementioned high wages and shortage
of men.</p>

<p>And, to complete the number of undesirables aboard, there was Mr.
Pathan, the half-breed passenger.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Dunn, the first mate, was a nervous little man,
totally unfitted to handle anything more than an orderly crew of
respectable Scandinavians. The result was that already his own watch
had been once so out of hand he had been forced to call upon the
second officer to help him maintain authority; since when,
automatically, as it were, the second mate had taken, though
unofficially, the reins of authority into his own hands.</p>

<p>Thus the situation five days after leaving port, on the homeward
passage.</p>

<p>A week had passed.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I'd like a word with you."</p>

<p>It was the big boatswain who spoke. He had come halfway up the
poop ladder, and his request was put in a low voice, yet with an
apparently casual air.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Barton! Come up here if you have anything about which
you wish to speak."</p>

<p>"It's about the men, sir. There's something up, an' I can't just
put me finger on it."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, something up?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, they're gettin' a bit at a loose end, an' they're
gettin' a bit too free-like with their lip if I tells 'em to do
anythin'."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Barton, I cannot help you in that. If you cannot
keep them in hand without aid, you'll never do it with."</p>

<p>"'Tisn't exactly that, sir. I can handle a crowd right enough
along with any man; savin' it be yourself, sir"--with an
acknowledging glance at his officer's gigantic proportions--"but
there's somethin' in the wind, as is makin' 'em too ikey. It's only
since the cap'n went, an' it's my belief as yon passenger's at the
bottom of it!"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"You noticed somethin' then, sir?" asked the boatswain
quickly.</p>

<p>"Tell me what makes you think the passenger may be in anything
that is brewing?" said the second mate, ignoring the man's
question.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, sir, he's too familiar with the men. An'
I've seen him go forrard to the fo'cas'le of a night when 'twas dark.
Once I went up to the door on the quiet, thinkin' as I'd get to see
what it was as he was up to; but the chap on the lookout spotted me
an' started talkin'. I reckonedhe meant headin' me off; so I asked
him to pass me down the end of me clothesline, for a bluff, an' then
I made tracks."</p>

<p>"But didn't you get any idea of what the fellow was doing in the
fo'cas'le?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it seemed to me as he was palaverin' to 'em like a
father; but as I was sayin' I hadn't time to get the bearin's of what
was goin' forrard. Then there's another matter, sir, as--"</p>

<p>"And you might tell the man, while he's up, to take a look at the
chafing gear on the fore swifter," interjected the second mate
calmly.</p>

<p>The irrelevancy of this remark seemed to bring the boatswain up
all standing, as the saying goes. He glanced up at the officer's
face, and in so doing the field of his vision included something
else--the very one of whom they were talking. He understood now the
reason of the second's apparently causeless remark; for that
keen-sensed officer had detected the almost cat-like tread
approaching them along the poop-deck, and changed the conversation on
the instant.</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes the boatswain and the second mate kept up
a talk upon certain technical details of ship work, until Mr. Pathan
was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"I reckon as he thought he'd like to know what it was we're
talkin' about, sir," remarked the boatswain, eying the broad back of
the stout passenger.</p>

<p>"What is this other matter that you want to speak to me
about?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, some of the hands 'as got hold of booze somehow. I
keeps smellin' of 'em whenever one of 'em comes near me, and I reckon
as he"---jerking his head in the direction of Mr. Pathan--"is the one
as is givin' it to 'em."</p>

<p>The second mate swore quietly.</p>

<p>"What's his game, sir? That's what's foozlin' me. I thinks it's
time as you looked inter ther matter!"</p>

<p>"If I thought--"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" encouraged the boatswain.</p>

<p>But whatever the second mate thought, he did not put it into
words. Instead, he asked the boatswain if he were of the opinion that
any of the forecastle crowd were to be depended upon.</p>

<p>"Not one of 'em, sir! There isn't one as wouldn't put a knife
inter you if he got half a chanst!"</p>

<p>The second nodded, as if the man's summing-up of the crew were in
accordance with his own ideas. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, Barton, I cannot do anything till we know more definitely
what is in the wind. You must keep your eyes open and report to me
anything that seems likely to help."</p>

<p>Behind them they heard again the pad of Mr. Pathan's deck
shoes.</p>

<p>"You had better overhaul the sheaves in those main lower topsail
brace blocks," he remarked for the benefit of the listening
passenger. "That will do for the present."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the boatswain, and went down the ladder on
to the main deck.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>IT WAS in the afternoon watch, and Miss Eversley was sitting with
a book in her lap, staring thoughtfully out across the sea.</p>

<p>Forward of her, the second mate tramped across the break of the
poop. When she had appeared on deck, he had been pacing fore and aft
along the poop, but had kept since then to the fore part of the
deck.</p>

<p>Of the male passenger there was no sign. Indeed, since the big
officer's "handling" of him, he had kept quite away from her, so that
at last she was beginning to find her stay aboard not at all
unpleasant. Occasionally the girl's glance would stray inboard to the
great silent man, smoking and meditating as he paced across the
planks.</p>

<p>It was curious (she recognized the fact) how often of late she had
found her thoughts dwelling upon him. He was no longer a
nonentity---something below the line of her horizon--but a man, and a
man in whom she was beginning to be interested. She remembered
now--what at the time she had scarcely noticed--her casual ignoring
of his proffered aid as she stepped aboard. It had seemed nothing
then to her, no more than if she had casually rejected the aid of a
footman; but now she could not comprehend how she had done it.</p>

<p>From this her memory led her to that distinctlyto-be-regretted
remark about his smoking. She watched him, and realized the more
completely as she did so that she would be vitally afraid to do such
a thing again; for, all unaware to herself, the manhood of the man
was mastering her. Yet, at this time, she had no realization of the
fact; nothing beyond that she was interested in him, perhapssomewhat
afraid and certainly a little desirous of knowing him.</p>

<p>On the second mate's part, he was thinking of other things than
her. The preceding day he had been obliged to step down on the main
deck to exert authority, and had succeeded only by laying out a
couple of the crew. That the disaffection was due, in part at least,
to Mr. Pathan he had very little doubt; but no proof that would
justify him in putting the man in irons, as he had determined to do
the very moment such was forthcoming. Also, he knew that the
captain's death had unsettled them, and that there were vague ideas
among them that now they were under no compulsion to obey orders. It
was doubtless, along these lines that Pathan was working with them,
and the thought made the big officer grit his teeth.</p>

<p>"Look out, Mr. Grey!"</p>

<p>The words came shrill and sudden in the voice of Miss Eversley,
and the second officer turned sharply from where he had stopped a
moment to lean upon the rail. He saw that she was on her feet, her
arm extended toward him, while her gaze flickered between him and
aloft. In the same instant, there was a sort of sogging thud behind
him.</p>

<p>His stare had followed the girl's, and for an instant he had seen
the dark face of one of the crew over the belly of the mizzen
topsail; then he had twisted quickly to see the reason of that noise,
though already half comprehending the cause. In that portion of the
rail over which he had just been leaning was stuck a heavy steel
marlinspike, the sharp point thereof appearing below, for it had
penetrated right through the thick teak.</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at it, while his face grew quietly grim.
Then he turned and walked toward the mizzen rigging. From here he
could look up abaft the mast. Thus he saw the man who had dropped the
spike making his way rapidly from aloft.</p>

<p>Getting into the lower rigging, the man--who proved to be one of
those the second mate had floored the previous day--called out in
broken English his regret for the accident; but the officer, knowing
how little of an accident there had been about the affair, said
nothing. Then, as soon as the creature put foot on the deck, he
caught him by the nape of the neck and walked him forward to where
the spike stood up in the rail.</p>

<p>Below on the main deck stood several of the crew, watching what
would happen, and fully prepared to make trouble if they got the half
of a chance. They saw the second officer grasp the embedded spike
with one great hand, then with apparent ease bend it from side to
side till it broke, leaving in the rail that portion which had
penetrated.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward, quite coolly, and calculating the force of
the blow, he struck the man with it upon the side of the head, so
that he went limp in his grasp; then he laid him down gently on the
hencoop and bade a couple of them come up and carry him to his bunk.
And this, being thoroughly cowed, as was the second mate's intention,
they did without so much as a murmur.</p>

<p>As soon as the men were gone with their burden, he walked aft to
where the girl stood.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Eversley," he said simply. "I should have been
spitted like a frog if you had not called."</p>

<p>She made no pretense of replying, and he looked at her more
particularly. She was extraordinarily pale, and staring at him out of
frightened eyes. He noticed also that she held to the edge of the
skylight as if for support.</p>

<p>"You are not well?" he said, and made as if to support her.</p>

<p>But she warded him off with a gesture.</p>

<p>"What a brute you are!" she said in a voice that would have been
cold had it been less intense.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment before he replied, as if weighing the
use of speech.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he remarked at last, calmly. "We have a
rough crowd to handle, and half measures would be worse than useless.
Won't you sit down?" And he indicated the chair behind her.</p>

<p>"It--it was butchery!" she remarked with a sort of cold anger, and
ignoring his suggestion.</p>

<p>"Very nearly--if you hadn't called." There had come a suggestion
of humor about the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I--"</p>

<p>She groped backward vaguely for the chair, and seemed unconscious
that it was his hands which guided her there.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Miss Eversley. You must really allow me to be the
better judge in a matter of this sort. I cannot afford to sign for
the long trip, if only for your sake."</p>

<p>"For my sake!" Her voice sounded scornful. "Inwhat way does it
concern me?"</p>

<p>The grimness crept back into his face and chased away the scarcely
perceptible humor.</p>

<p>"In this way," he replied in a voice as nearly as cold as her own
but for a certain almost savage intensity. "I, and I alone, am
keeping matters quiet aboard here; for I may as well tell you at once
that the first mate does not count for that much"--and he snapped his
finger and thumb--"among the crowd we've got in this packet. They're
quiet at present only because they're afraid of me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" She asked the question with a brave assumption
of indifference, to which her frightened eyes gave no support. "How
does it matter to me whether your men are quiet or not?"</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment quietly and with something in the
expression of his face that would have been contempt had it not been
tempered by a deeper emotion.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said, and she quailed before his masterfulness. "If
that spike had done its work just now, you had been better dead than
here. Do you think--"</p>

<p>He did not finish but turned from her and walked forward along the
deck, leaving her gazing at the nakedness of a hideous
possibility.</p>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>A WEEK passed in quietness, and, though the second mate and the
boatswain between them had kept a strict watch upon the male
passenger's movements, there had been nothing that could be looked
upon with suspicion; for they had no knowledge of the tightly folded
notes flipped to the helmsman, and by him conveyed forward, and read
for the delectation of the mutinous crowd in the forecastle.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary that Pathan should discontinue so abruptly
his nocturnal visits to the men. Possibly he had caught a stray word
or two of the boatswain's confabulation with the second mate, and so
taken fright. Whatever it was, the fact remained that it was
impossible to come upon anything which would justify their putting
him out of the way of doing mischief. Even the boatswain's complaints
about the men's behavior seemed to be lacking foundation during this
time, and altogether the ship appeared to be quieting down
nicely.</p>

<p>Though there had seemed of late little need for anticipating
trouble, yet the second mate had his doubts but that there was
something under this apparent calm, and, having his doubts, took the
precaution to carry a companionable weapon in his side pocket.</p>

<p>In the end, events proved that he was right; for, one afternoon on
watch, the boatswain, chancing to have physical trouble with one of
the men, the rest of the watch closed in upon him in a mob. At that
the second mate went down to take a turn, which turn he took to such
a tune that he had three of them stretched out before they were well
aware that he was among them. They were beginning to give before his
onslaught when suddenly he heard Pathan's voice, away aft, singing
out:</p>

<p>"Get on to him, lads! Now's your time! Give the bully a taste of
his own sort!"</p>

<p>At that the rest of them turned upon him with a rush, leaving the
sadly mauled boatswain to himself. And now the second mate showed of
what he was made. They were clinging on to him like a lot of
weasels--gripping his legs to trip him, grasping at his hands and
arms, and climbing on his back. One of these latter having clasped
hands under his chin, was doing his utmost to throttle him.</p>

<p>This the second mate foiled by unclasping the fellow's dirty paws
and pulling him bodily over his head, bringing him, with a
continuation of the movement, crashing down upon those of his
attackers immediately in front. At the same instant, the boatswain,
being by now somewhat recovered, laid hold upon one of those in the
rear and hauled him off. Even as he did so, there came the sound of a
pistol shot.</p>

<p>The second mate hove himself round carrying the mass of clinging
men with him. He saw Pathan coming along the decks toward them at a
run. In his hand was a pistol, with the smoke still rising from it.
Upon the deck lay the boatswain. He was kicking and twitching; for it
was he whom the passenger had shot.</p>

<p>"You-----skunk!" roared the second mate. He caught two of his
attackers by the hair of their heads and beat their skulls together
so they became immediately senseless.</p>

<p>He saw Pathan halt within a dozen feet of him and aim straight at
his head. He had been dead the following instant, but that there
happened a diversion.</p>

<p>A white face flashed into the field of his vision, and the next
moment Miss Eversley had thrown ahandful of some whitish powder into
the man's face. The pistol dropped with a thud, and from Pathan there
was nothing save a mixture of gasps and shouts, violent sneezing, and
coughs that broke off oddly into breathless blasphemy.</p>

<p>The second mate shouted incoherently. Then the girl was upon his
assailants, throwing handfuls of the powder into their faces;
whereupon they loosed him, as if their strength had gone from them,
and fell to much the same antics as had Pathan. Some of the powder
rose and assailed the second officer's nostrils, so that he sneezed
violently. It was pepper!</p>

<p>He turned to the girl. At her feet lay the tin with which she had
wrought his relief. She herself was standing, crying and sneezing
along with the rest, and trying to wipe her eyes with a peppery
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The second mate's glance noted the pistol dropped by Pathan, and
he stepped over, and, picking it up, put it in his pocket. Between
him and the group of sneezing, choking men lay the body of the
boatswain. A lot of the pepper had been spilt upon his upturned face,
yet he moved no whit. He was quite dead.</p>

<p>"What's happened, Mr. Grey?" asked a thin voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Rank mutiny!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Whatever shall we do?" returned the voice, the owner of which was
the first mate. "Whatever shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the second mate shortly.</p>

<p>He turned from the mate and bellowed to the other watch who were
coming aft in a body, having been aroused by the noise.</p>

<p>"Now then, my lads! Up forrard with you! Smartly!" And he pulled
out his revolver.</p>

<p>They went backward with a surge as he covered them.</p>

<p>"Back into the fo'cas'le! Don't stir out till I tell you!"</p>

<p>The threatening weapon, backed by the determination of the man,
overawed them and they went quickly.</p>

<p>"Close that door!" he roared.</p>

<p>It was closed immediately. Then he turned his attention to those
around. Miss Eversley was standing near, her cheeks white, but her
eyes and nose very red. It was plain to him that she was all of a
tremble and like to fall, so that, without more ado, he took her by
the shoulders and led her to a seat upon a spar lashed along by the
bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Now, don't faint," he commanded.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to," she said soberly.</p>

<p>He left her hurriedly; for the men, having recovered from the
effects of the pepper, were gathered in a clump and eying him
doubtfully. To the right, Pathan had got upon his feet. It is just
possible that in another moment they would have been upon him, which
would have meant the loosing of the other watch, had he not acted
with decision.</p>

<p>"Cyrone and Andy," he shouted, facing them squarely, "aft with
you, and tell the steward to pass out the irons!"</p>

<p>At the word, Andy started aft to obey. But Cyrone, one of those
who had been foremost in the trouble, made no move.</p>

<p>"Cyrone!" said the second mate.</p>

<p>The man had done well to understand the dangerous quiet in his
tone; but he did not. Instead, with unbounded insolence, he turned to
the fellows surrounding him.</p>

<p>"Who for the irons, hey? They for we! I know! I know!" he shouted
excitedly, and broke off into an unintelligible jargon of words.</p>

<p>"Cyrone!"</p>

<p>"For to-----you go!" shouted the wretch in reply. It was evident
that he was depending on the others to back him up.</p>

<p>The second mate said no word, but raised his pistol. The men about
Cyrone scattered to each side. They had seen the second mate's eyes.
In that last moment the fellow himself must have come suddenly into
knowledge; for he started back, crying out something in an altered
tone.</p>

<p>There was a scream from Miss Eversley, which blent with the sudden
crack of the weapon; then Cyrone staggered and fell sideways on to
the hatch. There was an instant of strange silence, broken by a
dullish thud on the deck behind.</p>

<p>"Jardkenoff, go along with Andy for those irons," said the second
mate in a level tone.</p>

<p>At his order the whole of them had started forward like frightened
animals.</p>

<p>Jardkenoff ran past him, crying "Yi, yi, sir!" in a shaking
voice.</p>

<p>While they were gone for the irons, the second mate bade the
others lift the bodies of the boatswain and Cyrone on to the hatch.
Then he looked round to discover the cause of that thud upon the
deck. He saw that Miss Eversley had fallen forward off the spar on to
her face, and atthat he hastened to lift her. Fortunately, she had
escaped injury, at which unconsciously he sighed relief. Then, taking
her into his arms, he carried her to the hatch, singing out to one of
the men by name to run aft to bring the steward with some brandy.</p>

<p>All this while, Pathan, the passenger, had stood in a dazed
fashion beside the main-mast. Now, thinking he perceived a chance to
steal aft to the temporary safety of his room, he began to sidle
quietly away. It was no use, for the mate's voice pulled him up short
before he had gone a dozen feet.</p>

<p>"You will stay where you are, Mr. Pathan!" was all that he
said.</p>

<p>When the irons came, the steward accompanied them, carrying a
glass full of brandy. This, under the eye of the second mate, he
proceeded to administer. At the same time, the officer was
superintending the ironing of Pathan. By the time that this was
accomplished, Miss Eversley had begun to come to a knowledge of her
surroundings, and presently sat up. Before this, however, the second
mate had seen to it that Pathan was removed to the lazarette, for he
would not have her upset further by sight of the murderer.</p>

<p>As soon as she was strong enough, he gave her his arm and led her
aft to her cabin. In the saloon they came upon the captain's wife
sitting limply in one of the chairs. At their entrance, she started
up, and cried out something in a frightened voice. The poor woman
seemed demented and quite incapable of rational speech. It was
evident that the scene on deck--which apparently she had
witnessed--had, in conjunction with her recent loss, temporarily
unsettled her mental balance.</p>

<p>With difficulty they persuaded her to go to her room, after which
the second mate returned to the deck, with the intention of trying to
put a little heart into the nonentity whom Fate had placed above him
in the scale of authority.</p>

<p>That evening, in the second dog-watch, the body of Cyrone was, by
his orders, ignominiously dumped over the side without ceremony, and
with a piece of rope and holystone attached to his feet.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>THE following day it was a somewhat cowed lot of men who came aft,
at the second mate's bidding, to the funeral of the boatswain. Nor
did his opinion of them, expressed tersely after the body had gone
down into the darkness, help to reassure them. He told them that, at
the first sign of further insubordination, he would shoot them down
like the dogs they were; that, in future, there should be no
afternoon watch below, and that work should be continued right
through the two dog-watches. On learning this, there came a slight
murmur, expressive of discontent checked by fear, from the men
grouped below the break.</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared the second officer, and whipped out a pistol
from his side pocket.</p>

<p>Instantly the murmur ceased; for the men, as was the second's
intention, realized that he would stop nowhere to enforce his
commands. And there was still vividly in their minds the execution of
Cyrone.</p>

<p>As the men went forward, the first mate ventured a weak protest
against the second's measures.</p>

<p>"You'll have 'em murdering us, Mr. Grey, if you go on like that!
Why don't you speak to 'em nicely?"</p>

<p>The second mate looked down upon his superior. At first his glance
denoted impatient contempt; but after the first moment an expression
of tolerance spread over his features as he took in the other's
almost pathetic weakness of face and figure.</p>

<p>"I believe you read the Bible, Mr. Dunn?" "I--I---" began the
mate, flushing slightly. "Yes--perhaps I do sometimes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you should know how little use swine have for pearls."</p>

<p>"You think, then, Mr. Grey--"</p>

<p>"I'm certain. That scum would take kindness for a sign of
weakening on our part, and then--" He made an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"I wish to God we were home!" said the mate fervently.</p>

<p>"You cheer up, mister!" replied the big officer. "If you have any
trouble with your lot, don't stop to talk--shoot!"</p>

<p>"It's an awful thing to take a life."</p>

<p>"It is a necessary thing sometimes. And, besides, you have only to
bang on the deck for me, and I'll be up in a brace of shakes."</p>

<p>And so, after a few more words of encouragement to the frightened
man, the second left him in charge, and went below for a sleep.</p>

<p>True to his word, the second mate kept the mutinous crowd of
sailormen hard at it from dawnto dusk. Even the first mate, inspired
by his example and encouragement, made a brave attempt to follow in
his wake. As the second mate put it, "Sweat the flesh off their
bones, and they'll be too tired to use their dirty brains." Also, he
was the more confident of keeping them in subjection, now that Pathan
was safely ironed in the lazarette.</p>

<p>Thus, at last, matters seemed in a fair way to tend to a happy
ending of the troubles that had beset them so far. Yet of one person
this could not be said; for the mental condition of the captain's
wife showed no signs of improvement. Fortunately, she was in no way
violent and gave little trouble, her state being that of one
suffering from melancholia in one of its quieter forms.</p>

<p>Then one morning it was discovered she was missing. A search was
made through the ship, but without success. She was never found.
Evidently the poor creature had crept on deck some time during the
night and gone overboard.</p>

<p>From this, onward, nothing disturbed the monotony of the voyage
for many days. The second mate kept the crew well in hand, in no way
abating rigorous treatment of them, so that did he but raise a hand
they jumped to do his bidding.</p>

<p>And now of Miss Eversley. Day by day the girl had found her
thought centering upon the second mate. The horizon of her mind
seemed bounded by him. She caught herself watching his least gesture
as he paced the poop in his meditative fashion, or gave some order to
the crew. Did the first mate relieve him, so that he could go below
for a sleep, the deck seemed strangely empty, the wind chilly, the
sea dull and uninteresting. Yet when he relieved the first mate, how
different! Then the wind was warm, the sea full of an everlasting
beauty, the deck, nay, the very planks of the deck,
companionable.</p>

<p>And so she grew into the knowledge that she loved him, even to the
extent of looking forward to her future life as a hideous blank, if
he were not to share it; while he--silly man! He would break off his
walks to sit and chat with her; but of that which she most desired to
hear, not a word. Yet, by his eyes, she guessed that he cared; but
for some reason--possibly because she was so much alone---he said
nothing.</p>

<p>And so, at last, she might have come to aid him in spanning the
gulf that remained yet between them; but that fate, in its own
terrible way, took a hand.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>"MR. GREY! Mr. Grey! Jack! Jack!"</p>

<p>The second mate woke with a start and leapt up in his bunk.</p>

<p>Miss Eversley was standing in the doorway of his berth.</p>

<p>"Quick! They've killed the first mate! And they're coming
down--now! Pathan has been let out, and he's with them!"</p>

<p>Even before she had made an end of speaking, the second mate had
reached the floor with a bound. He snatched the revolver from under
his pillow, and ran into the saloon.</p>

<p>From the doorway, giving into the companion stairs came the sounds
of whispering, and the padding of many bare feet descending. He made
a quick step to meet them; but the girl caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't, Jack! Don't!" Then, as he still hesitated: "For my
sake--remember! Oh! Is there no place?"</p>

<p>She stopped, for the second mate had caught her by the arm and was
running her toward the fore part of the saloon. His wits, slightly
bewildered by sleep, had flashed instantly to their normal clearness
under the stress of her terror. He realized that, for her sake alone,
he had no right to throw away his chances of life.</p>

<p>Just as the foremost of the mutineers stepped silently into the
dimly lighted saloon, the big officer pushed open the door of the
foremost berth on the port side and thrust Miss Eversley in. At the
same moment, the man at the other end discovered them and gave a yell
to announce the fact.</p>

<p>The following instant he lay dead, and the man behind him shared
the same end. This caused a temporary hesitation on the part of the
attackers, and in that slight interval the second officer slipped
into the berth after the girl, slammed the door, and locked it.</p>

<p>"Stand to one side," he whispered to her.</p>

<p>As she did so, he hurled himself at the forward bulkhead of the
berth. One of the boards started, and he attacked it again, the noise
he was making drowning that of the mutineers in the saloon.</p>

<p>Crash! The momentum of his effort had made a great breach in the
woodwork and taken him clean through into the absolute darkness of
the sail-locker beyond.</p>

<p>In a moment he was back. He caught the girl by the wrist and
helped her through. Even as he did sothere came a loud report in the
saloon, and a bullet stripped off a long splinter on the inner side
of the door as it came through.</p>

<p>Immediately, the second officer raised his weapon, and
fired--once--twice. At the second shot there came a sharp outcry from
one of those beyond the door, and then three shots in quick reply.
They hurt no one, for the big officer had bounded into the
sail-locker. He had dropped his emptied weapon into his side pocket
and was helping Miss Eversley over the great masses of stowed
sails.</p>

<p>In the half of a minute he whispered to her to stand. An instant
he fumbled, and she heard the rattle of a key. Then a square of pale
light came in the darkness ahead of her, and she saw that he had
opened a trap in the steel bulkhead that ran across the poop.</p>

<p>The following instant she was in darkness; for the huge bulk of
her companion completely filled the aperture as he forced himself
through. The light came again, and then she saw his head silhouetted
against it in the opening.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," he whispered, and the moment afterward she
was standing beside him on the deck, under the break of the poop.</p>

<p>For an instant they stood there, scanning the decks, but every
soul, saving the helmsman, had joined in the attack. Through the
opening behind them came the sound of blows struck upon the door of
the berth which they had just quitted. No time was to be lost; for
the moment that the brutes discovered that rent in the woodwork of
the berth, they would be after them.</p>

<p>A sudden idea came to the second officer. He shut down the door of
the vertical trap and locked it. The men would search the sail-locker
for them, now that it was shut and fastened; while, if he had left it
open, they would have been on their track immediately.</p>

<p>"Forrard to the half-deck," he muttered, and they ran out into the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Now the half-deck was a little, strongly built steel deck-house,
situated about amidships. It had one steel door on the after end, and
once they were in, and this shut, they would be comparatively safe,
at least for the time being.</p>

<p>Abruptly, as they ran, there came a muffled outcry, and they knew
that the door to the berth had been broken down. They reached the
half-deck, and, while Miss Eversley sprang over the washboard, the
officer ran to slip the hood which held the door back. Even as he
reached up his hand there came a shout from the poop. They were
discovered. There came a thudding of rapid feet, and he saw the whole
remaining crew of the boat tumbling hurriedly down the ladder on to
the main deck. At that critical instant he found that the hook was
jammed. He riddled at it a moment; but still it refused to come out
of its eye.</p>

<p>The running men were halfway to him, howling like wild beasts, and
brandishing knives and belaying-pins. In desperation he caught the
edge of the door, put one foot against the side of the house, and
tugged. An instant of abominable suspense; then the hook gave,
parting with a sharp crack. Through the very supremeness of his
effort, he staggered back a couple of paces, then, before he could
regain the door to shut it, a couple of the men who had outstripped
the others, leaped past him and into the half-deck, with a cry of
triumph.</p>

<p>He heard Miss Eversley scream; then a third man was upon him. The
second mate tried to slam the door in his face, but the fellow jammed
himself in between the door and the side of the doorway. At that the
big officer caught him by the chin and the back of the head, and
plucked him into the half-deck by sheer strength. Then he brought the
door to, and slipped the bolt, just as the rest of the men outside
hurled themselves against it.</p>

<p>From the girl there came a cry of warning, and, in the same
instant, the loud clang of some heavy missile striking the door by
his right ear. He whirled round just in time to receive the united
charge of the three he had imprisoned with himself in the
deck-house.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a sufficiency of light in the berth; for the
lamp had been left burning by the former occupants when they left to
join in the attack on the afterguard.</p>

<p>Two of the men had their knives. The third stooped and made a grab
for the iron belaying-pin which he had just thrown at the officer.
Him the second mate made harmless by a kick in the face; then the
other two were upon him.</p>

<p>He snatched at the knife-hand of the man to the right, and got him
by the wrist; tried to do the same to the other and missed. The
fellow dodged, rushed in and slashed the second mate's shirt open
from the armpit to the waist, inflicting a long gash, but the next
instant was hurled across the berth by aterrific left-hand blow.</p>

<p>The second mate turned upon the man whose wrist he had captured.
His fingers were hurting intolerably, for the fellow was tearing at
them with the nails of his loose hand so that they were bleeding in
several places. He caught the wretch by the head, jammed the left arm
under his chin, and leaned forward with a vast effort. There was a
horrid crack, and the man shuddered and collapsed.</p>

<p>There came a little broken gasp of horror from the girl who was
crouched up against the corner on the starboard side. The second mate
turned upon her.</p>

<p>"Turn your face to the bulkhead, and stop your ears," he
commanded.</p>

<p>She shivered and obeyed, trembling and striving to stifle back a
tumult of sobbing which had taken her.</p>

<p>The officer stooped and removed the knife from the hand of the
dead man. Upon the door behind him there sounded a perfect thunder of
blows. Abruptly, as he stood up the glass of the port on the
starboard side was shattered, and a hand and arm came into the
light.</p>

<p>The second mate dodged below the line of the bunkboard. There was
a loud report, and a bullet struck somewhere against the ironwork. He
ran close up to the bunk, still keeping out of sight, then rose
upright with a sudden movement and grasped the pistol and the hand
that held it, leaned forward over the bunk, and struck with his knife
a little below the arm. There came a howl of pain from outside and
the body fell away from the port, leaving the loaded pistol in the
second mate's grasp.</p>

<p>Not a moment did he waste, but slammed to the iron cover over the
port and commenced to screw up the fastening. It was stiff, so that
he had to take both hands to it, and because of this he placed the
revolver down upon the bedding of the bunk.</p>

<p>This came near to causing his death, for, suddenly, as he wrestled
with the screw, a hand flashed over his shoulder and grabbed the
weapon. Instinctively the second mate dodged and swung up a defending
arm. He struck something. There was a sharp explosion close to his
head, and then the clatter of the falling weapon.</p>

<p>By this he had got himself about and saw that the two whom he had
temporarily disabled were upon him. Before he could defend himself,
one of them struck him with the iron belaying-pin across his head. It
sent him staggering across the floor.</p>

<p>As he fell, a scream from Miss Eversley pierced to his dull
senses, and he got upon his knees, gasping and rocking, yet still
full of the implacable determination to fight. For all his grit he
would have been dead but for the girl. He had grasped the legs of one
of his assailants; but was too dazed and weakened to put forth his
usual strength.</p>

<p>The second man raised the heavy pin for another smite, but it
never fell. To the second mate, wrestling pointlessly, there sounded
a dull thud and a cry. Something fell upon him all of a heap, as it
were, and he was brought to the deck upon his side; yet he had not
relaxed his somewhat nervous grip upon the man's legs, so that the
fellow came down with him.</p>

<p>For perhaps the half of a minute he held on stupidly while the man
struggled violently to get away. Then, almost abruptly, nerve and
reasoning-power came back to him, and in the same instant a violent
pain smote him between the left shoulder and the neck. He got upon
his knees, hurling the dead body of the other man from off his
shoulders with the movement.</p>

<p>He was now above his opponent, and at once attempted to capture
the fellow's knife. In this he was not at first successful, with the
result that he sustained a second stab, this time slitting open the
front of his shirt, and cutting his breast. At that, growing
inconceivably furious, he regarded not the knife, but smote the man
with his bare fist between the eyes and again below the ear, and so
shrewd and mighty were the blows that the fellow died
immediately.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the man was indeed dead, the second mate got
himself upon his feet. He was breathing deeply, and his head seemed
full of a dull ache.</p>

<p>He took his gaze from the bodies at his feet, and glanced around.
Not two yards distant stood Miss Eversley. She had a revolver in her
right hand. At that, the second mate understood how he had escaped
with his life. Yet he had no thought of thanking her; for the horror
in her face warned him not to do anything that might increase her
realization of what she had done. Instead, he made two steps to her,
and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>With the feel of his arms about her, she dropped the pistol and
broke into violent weeping. And he, having some smattering of wisdom,
held his peace for a space.</p>

<p>Presently the extreme agitation of the girl passed off, and she
sobbed only at intervals. Later still she spoke.</p>

<p>"I shall never be happy again."</p>

<p>And still the second mate preserved the sweet wisdom of
silence.</p>

<p>"Never, never, never!" he heard her whispering to herself.</p>

<p>And so, in a while, she calmed down to quiet breathing. For a
space they stood thus, and on the decks all about the little house
was silence, save for the occasional pad, pad, of a bare foot, as
those without moved hither and thither.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>THE day had come and passed, and it was again night.</p>

<p>Within the house things could be seen but dimly, for the lamp was
turned no more than a quarter up, and of oil they had no supply
beyond the quantity within the lamp itself. Fortunately, there was no
immediate need to worry about water; for the water breaker, lashed to
the port end of the table, was a quarter full, owing to the
boatswain's and carpenter's dislike for soap and water.</p>

<p>As for food, an examination of the bread barge in one of the empty
lower bunks showed him that there was enough biscuit to keep the two
of them crudely fed for some days, provided they were careful. In the
food cupboard there was also half a bottle of ship's vinegar, about
half a pound of ship salt pork, some sugar in a soup-and-bully tin,
and about three pounds of black molasses in a big seven-pound pickle
jar; all of these being the usual savings of rations that might be
found in the food locker of any other lime-juicer, windjammer in all
the seven seas.</p>

<p>He had, aided by the girl, bound up his wounds, which were not
sufficiently serious to trouble him with anything more than a
constant smarting; and though he had bled a good deal, he was so full
of life and vitality that he was scarcely aware of the loss, except
that he was abnormally thirsty; which fortunately the water in the
breaker enabled him to quench freely. Yet, all the same he held this
need somewhat in check, for they must never run short of the precious
fluid.</p>

<p>During the day a certain amount of light had driven in between the
crevices about the door. Beyond this there had been none, for the
ports were all protected by their iron covers. Fortunately, as the
second mate had discovered, all of them had been fastened on the
preceding night, previous to their making a refuge of the house, all,
that is, save the one through which they had been attacked. To this
fortunate happening it is probable they owed their lives.</p>

<p>In the corner of the house to the right of the door there was a
grim mound. The second mate had spread a couple of blankets over it
to hide its full horror from the eyes of the girl; yet, by this very
act, he had made it almost more unbearable than if he had left them
in all the stark awesomeness of uncovered death.</p>

<p>Out upon the decks was quietness. Indeed, all through the day
there had been but one attempt to molest them, and this the second
mate had foiled by quietly opening one of the after ports and firing
into the thick of the attacking party. In this way he was persuaded
that he could have held the house for as long as it pleased him to do
so but for the insurmountable obstacle that confronted him in the
shape of lack of ammunition. Yet, even as it was, it was plain to him
that the repulse he had given them was likely to keep them at a
respectable distance---at least for some while. For, out of a crew of
sixteen deck-hands, six had already been killed and several
wounded.</p>

<p>In the brief time he had been at the port he had gathered
something of the methods they had been about to apply to the felling
of the door. They had rigged up a spar on a tackle, so as to form a
rough sort of battering ram; yet, in the brief attempt that he had
permitted them, the machine had proved unsuccessful, for the
suspending rope had been too long, and the rolling of the ship had
caused the spar to swing across the after end of the house, in the
fashion of a clock pendulum, so that at one moment the business end
of the ram was opposed to the door, and another to some portion of
the end of the house.</p>

<p>In spite of the failure of the attackers, the big officer was well
aware that with a more perfect appliance, and no ammunition with
which to beat them off, they would not be long in forcing the door.
And then...</p>

<p>The second night of the imprisonment had come. The second mate had
gone to the door and was listening; but beyond the pad of a bare
foot, or hum of hoarse voices, there was nothing to tell of the
watchers about the decks.</p>

<p>For her part, the girl was busying herself clearing away the few
eatables from which they had been making a meal. This done, she
hesitated a moment, then went over to the second mate.</p>

<p>"Let me stay up tonight and watch, Jack. You have not had any
sleep, and I have slept most of the day. I could wake you up the
moment anything happened."</p>

<p>The big man put a hand on each side of her shoulders and looked
down upon her with a grave half-smile.</p>

<p>"Do, Jack! You can trust me," she urged.</p>

<p>"Trust you, little girl," he replied. "Yes, child, with a thousand
lives if I had them."</p>

<p>"Then you will let me stay up and watch?" He shook his head
slowly.</p>

<p>"There will be no need tonight, at any rate. They cannot get at us
without noise. We may both sleep."</p>

<p>This he said to quiet her entreaties; for he had no intention to
allow her to sit alone in the darkness with her thoughts, and that
blanket-covered mound, while he slept. More, he wished her to sleep;
for he had a project which he hoped to carry out during the hours of
darkness.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood looking up at him in the half-light. Then
she slipped her hands on to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Then I will say good night, Jack, for we must save the oil in the
lamp."</p>

<p>The second mate stooped and kissed her. "Good night, Mary," he
said gravely.</p>

<p>"Good night," she whispered, kissing him in return.</p>

<p>Then she left him and went behind the blanket which he had rigged
up before the bunks on the starboard side.</p>

<p>A space of about two hours passed, during which the second mate
lay awake listening. Presently, realizing that the girl was asleep,
he got up and quietly opened the door of the house. He listened a
minute and found no one about, then swiftly he carried out each of
the dead bodies on to the deck and left them there. He returned to
the house and locked the door.</p>

<p>All at once, from outside the door, there rose an outcry. At that,
he knew that the dead had been discovered. The outcries sank to a
subdued murmur; for there had come fear among the men. Yet from
thence onward, the door was never left unguarded day or night.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>THE morning of the fourth day of their imprisonment dawned, and
the second mate was awakened by a noise of hammering close against
the port on the left side of the door. He jumped from his bunk
quietly, and crept softly to the one on his right. He had the
revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>Very cautiously he unscrewed the fastening of the iron cover, and
glanced out, but could see no one. For a little he listened, and
between the blows he caught a murmur of talk some little distance
away. Abruptly he recognized Pathan's voice. At that, quickly but
silently, he unscrewed the fastening of the glass and opened it. He
thrust his head out and looked to the left.</p>

<p>Close to him, and right in front of the door, stood one of the
men. He held the muzzle of a clumsy ship's musket, the butt resting
on the deck. The second mate remembered having observed this same
antique weapon hanging in the steward's pantry. It was evident that
they were but poorly supplied with firearms.</p>

<p>Beyond the guard, he made out a couple more of the men fixing a
heavy piece of timber across the other port. Evidently they had hit
upon this plan of preventing his interfering with their operations.
With the two after ports blocked they could do much as they
pleased.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp exclamation on his right startled the second
officer. He glanced round. There was Pathan fumbling with his
revolver.</p>

<p>Instantly the second mate snatched his head into the shelter of
the house. Almost at the same moment there sounded a thunderous bang,
close to the left. He heard Pathan give a scream of pain, breaking
off into a blatter of cursing.</p>

<p>At the risk of his life he shoved his head out. Pathan was nursing
his right hand, while big tears of pain were running down his cheeks
to that strange accompaniment of blasphemy. On the deck, close to his
feet, lay the shattered butt of his revolver. The second mate twisted
to the left for a brief glance. He saw that the guard was sitting
upon the deck, rubbing his right shoulder. He looked woefully scared,
while nearby lay the cumbrous weapon with which he had been
armed.</p>

<p>What had happened was now clear to the big officer. The man had
fired at the protruding head---but a fraction too late--with the
result that the bolt, with which the gun had been loaded, had
strickenthe passenger's revolver, destroying it and wounding his
hand.</p>

<p>Even as the solution came to the officer, the guard had reached
for his gun and scrambled to his feet. In another moment he would
have clubbed the second mate, but that a bullet sent him twitching to
the deck.</p>

<p>The second mate turned his pistol upon Pathan. Could he but rid
the ship of that fiend, all might yet be well.</p>

<p>Yet, as he pressed the trigger for the second time, his elbow was
jogged from within the house. He swore between his teeth and tried
another shot, only to be warned by the unsatisfying click of the
hammer that his ammunition had come to an end.</p>

<p>He drew away from the port with an angry gesture, and well it was
for him that he did so, for one of the two at work upon the port,
seeing that the weapon was empty of cartridges, had run at him with a
hammer. The blow missed, and the following instant the second mate
had slammed the covers and fastened up the port.</p>

<p>He turned and found the girl standing by him.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said a trifle sternly, "you made me miss Pathan
when you touched me. If I had shot that wretch the men would have
been glad enough to come to terms."</p>

<p>He was hot with his failure, or he had not spoken so to her. And
she, having but touched him because of the fear which had seized her
at his rashness in so exposing himself, burst into crying; for she
had been sorely overstrained with the rough happenings of late.</p>

<p>At this his anger left him and he made to comfort her, so, for
that morning they sat together, she taking little heed of the various
sounds about the house which told him that the fiends outside were
preparing to batter down the door. They had covered up the second
port immediately after his closing of the cover, so that he had no
means of knowing how matters were progressing beyond such as his
ears, trained in ship-craft, could tell him.</p>

<p>Very slowly the day passed to its close. He knew that the final
struggle was at hand; but he did not by any means consider their
chances of life beyond hope; for he knew that the crew had been
greatly reduced, so that, could he but avoid the fire of the big
musket, he might slay Pathan and put the rest to flight. Yet he had
no knowledge but that the house might be their prison for a day or
two longer; though, beyond that time they could not hope to stay, for
of food they had but little, and less water.</p>

<p>The day had been a fine one, as they could tell by the light which
came through the crevices around the somewhat loosely fitting door,
and when at last the evening came, the girl went to the door to try
to get a look at the sunset.</p>

<p>"Come and look, Jack," she said suddenly, after a period of
silence.</p>

<p>He turned from the water breaker at which he was busy emptying the
last few drops.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mary?"</p>

<p>His voice was perhaps a trifle uneasy, for he had made the
discovery that there was left only half a pannikin of water. During
the last two days of their imprisonment he had been limiting his
allowance; for he would not see her stinted, and now, through some
mischance, the spigot, which someone had fixed near the bottom of the
little cask, had been loosened, and the small quantity of the
imperative liquid which had been theirs was all squandered save for
the drainings which he had emptied into the enameled mug.</p>

<p>He came across to where she stood. For the moment he was minded
not to tell her, then, remembering because of the fiends outside,
that a clear knowledge of their position was her due, he told her not
only of this matter but of the likelihood of the crisis being near at
hand.</p>

<p>When he had made an end, she reached up one hand to his shoulder,
then held out the other for the mug. She drew him down to the crevice
through which she had been peering.</p>

<p>"See," she said, "did you ever see such a sunset?" Her voice
dropped. "And it may be our last, Jack." She patted his shoulder as
she spoke. "You know, boy, I may be only a silly girl, but I know
nothing but a miracle can save us."</p>

<p>It was the first time she had spoken out so plainly, and he,
having nothing to answer, stared out blindly into the dying glory
outside.</p>

<p>In a little, perhaps the half of a minute, she drew him back
somewhat and held the little mug up before them.</p>

<p>"We will drink it together, darling," she whispered, and bent her
head over and kissed the brim, then handed it to him; but he was not
deceived.</p>

<p>"Fair play, little woman. You have drunk nothing."</p>

<p>He passed it back to her, and she, knowing him, sipped a little,
then held it up to him and made him drink from her own hands. He was
hideously thirsty, but controlled himself to one gulp only; then took
the mug from her and set it down upon the table. For the end was not
yet, and she might have need of it ere then.</p>

<p>It was almost dark in the berth, for the oil of the lamp was done
this long while, the only light they had coming in through the
crannies about the door.</p>

<p>For a while the two of them stood together. He was deep in
pondering as to when the attack would come. Probably as soon as it
was dark; for, of course, they could not be absolutely sure that he
had no further supply of cartridges.</p>

<p>She for her part was leaning forward, peering through the narrow
opening at the red splendor of the sun's shroud. Once or twice she
ran her fingers up and down this crack, as if she would fain enlarge
it. Possibly the tips showed outside, for her hands were very
slender; yet, however it may have been, it is certain that one of the
devils upon the deck was attracted and crept up on tiptoe. Inside,
the girl, staring out, saw something come abruptly between her and
the sun. The second mate saw it at the same moment, else she had been
dead on the instant.</p>

<p>He pushed her from him, out of a line with the crack, and in so
doing brought himself almost directly opposite. There came a sudden
spurt of flame into the semi-darkness of the house, and a tremendous
report close up against the door. The girl gave a little scream which
almost drowned her lover's moan of pain, but not quite.</p>

<p>"You are not hurt, dearest?" she cried out loud.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not answer, and in that quick silence she
heard a man outside laugh brutally.</p>

<p>The second mate had his hand up to his eyes and was very silent.
In the dimness of the place she saw that he was swaying upon his
feet.</p>

<p>"Jack," she said in an intense whisper of fear. "Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p>She caught his wrist with a gentle hold. Still he did not reply.
Beyond the door she heard the murmur of voices, and odd words and
fragments of sentences drifted to her uncomprehending brain.</p>

<p>"---for?"</p>

<p>"Fiddlin' at ther door!"</p>

<p>"---bust! The gun's busted!"</p>

<p>"Thank God!" It was the second mate who had spoken, and the girl
loosed her hands from his wrists in her astonishment. Then, with a
sudden applying of his words to satisfy the desire of her soul--</p>

<p>"You are not hurt, then, dear?"</p>

<p>"A--a little. My eyes--"</p>

<p>"What? Let me see!" But he swung round from her.</p>

<p>"Can you get me some--something for a bandage?" There was a
desperate levelness in his tone.</p>

<p>He took two or three uncertain steps across the floor, as if
bewildered. She followed him. He took his hands from his face and
moved his head from side to side, as if peering about the house.
Abruptly, he turned and blundered into her clumsily. She would have
fallen, but that he caught and steadied her.</p>

<p>"Jack! Oh, Jack!" she cried, for even in the dimness of the place
she had caught a glimpse of where his eyes ought to have been.</p>

<p>"It's all right, little woman," he replied in a voice that was
nearly steady. "I--can't see very well while the pain's bad." He had
covered his face again with his hands.</p>

<p>She answered nothing. She was tearing one of her undergarments
into strips, and trying to quiet her sobs.</p>

<h3>Chapter X</h3>

<p>THE night had come. The second mate, the upper portion of his face
swathed in wrappings, was seated on the sea-chest below his bunk. The
girl was sitting by him, and their right hands were clasped.</p>

<p>The crack along the edge of the door had been stuffed up with a
strip of blanket. Upon the edge of the table was stuck a tiny
fragment of candle, and by the light of this she was reading slowly
the betrothing passage from the Solemnization of Matrimony--that in
which the man plights his troth. The second mate was repeating the
words after her.</p>

<p>Presently they had made an end, and the girl slipped her hand
gently from his; then, taking hold of his in turn, she read in a firm
voice that passage in which the woman gives her troth. At the end,
she released the second mate's hand and drew a ring from off one of
her fingers. This she put gently into his hand. Then having given him
her left, he slid the ring on her third finger, repeating
themeanwhile, after her, the passage which she whispered to him.</p>

<p>And after that they sat a while, too full of thought for
speech.</p>

<p>Presently the candle went out abruptly, and the two were alone in
the darkness.</p>

<p>From the deck beyond the door came an occasional mutter of speech,
an occasional padding of feet and an occasional creaking of gear, and
the two within sat and waited.</p>

<p>Toward midnight the moon rose and limned the outline of the door
in pale light. Presently the girl spoke.</p>

<p>"The moon has risen, Jack."</p>

<p>She rose from his side and moved to the door. Perhaps she might be
able to see what the crew were busied at. Abruptly, as she stooped
forward to peer, something struck the door a tremendous blow, filling
the interior of the house with a deafening, hollow boom. She cried
out in fear, and even as she cried came the second blow and the crack
of a breaking rivet.</p>

<p>She realized that the attack had begun, and groped a moment for
the matches. She struck one and examined the door. To the casual
glance it was unharmed; but by the light of the third match she made
out that a rivet in the bottom hinge was snapped. By this, a dozen
blows had been dealt, and yet, from the second mate, seated upon the
sea-chest, no sound.</p>

<p>All at once he spoke.</p>

<p>"Come here, Mary."</p>

<p>She came to him quickly, wondering, half-consciously, at the
strange harshness of his tone. By the light of the match which she
carried, she saw that he had in his hand the revolver.</p>

<p>"It's no good, Jack," she said despairingly, thinking he had a
mind that she should use it in their defense. "There are no
cartridges!"</p>

<p>"I kept--one," he said with a jerk, and still in that unnatural
voice.</p>

<p>He reached out his left hand to her. And at that she comprehended,
and comprehending shrank back with a little wail.</p>

<p>"O-o-h! O-o-h! Jack!" she sobbed, with a sudden plumbing of the
abyss of mortal terror.</p>

<p>There came a louder crash on the door, and then the second mate's
voice.</p>

<p>"Mary!"</p>

<p>She went up to him, quivering.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Jack! Not yet!"</p>

<p>He put his left arm round her.</p>

<p>"Mary!" he said, and the fierce agony which possessed him spoke
out in his voice. "Tell me when the door begins to go!"</p>

<p>And she knew that the time of the door's standing was the span of
her life.</p>

<p>At each ringing thud of the ram she could feel the place quiver.
By now it had become a steady, almost rhythmic boom, boom, boom,
which, as a rivet gave, blent into a crash. The inside of the steel
house was like the inside of a great drum.</p>

<p>And so a minute passed, and another, and still the door stood,
while that dread booming beat out the knell of the two within--he
grim for very fear of himself, and she shaking because of the thing
that was to happen, and still with some room in her soul for his
sufferings, yet unable to say anything; for in those last moments he
had become her executioner as well as her lover, and there were
things she could not say to the two.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Crash!</p>

<p>"Mary?" His voice sounded like the cry of a lost soul, and the
love in the woman answered to it. Yet the physical terror of death
was upon her.</p>

<p>"The--the door--is--is--stop! It's only the bottom hinge has
broken. It isn't down yet!" Crash! Crash! Crash!</p>

<p>The girl, all of a shiver, turned suddenly and put her arms round
his neck.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Jack!"</p>

<p>Crash! Crash!</p>

<p>He repelled her for a moment, then, drawing her to him, kissed her
good-by.</p>

<p>Crash! C-r-a-s-h!</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't! Not yet! It isn't down yet! Give me--give me as
long as you--you can!"</p>

<p>For the arm about her shoulders had tightened with a sudden grip.
Then abruptly--</p>

<p>"Have you--have you a--a--a knife, Jack?"</p>

<p>He took his arm from about her and brought something from behind,
which he held out for her to take.</p>

<p>She saw it faintly by the glimmer of moonlight that came through
the shaken door.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she cried, and shuddered. "You---you take it! Give
me the pistol. I--I can see."</p>

<p>He gave up the revolver to her and shifted the knife to his right
hand. Even as he did so, the door crashed in. He felt the girl thrill
in the grip of his arm; then her right hand went up, and, an instant
later came the click of the hammer, but no report--the cartridge had
missed fire. She had aimed at a dark figure beyond the doorway, which
she had recognized as Pathan. Yet the cruelty of fate denied her even
the consolation of knowing that she died leaving her lover not at the
mercy of that creature.</p>

<p>She cried out her dismay, and then again in terror, for the grip
of the second mate's arm warned her that the end had indeed come.
There came the rush of feet along the deck, and the blaze of a flare.
Then Pathan's voice:</p>

<p>"Don't hurt the girl!"</p>

<p>She caught so much of it. Then the touch of her lover's fingers
upon her breast made her quiver. She felt his right arm go back for
the blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, help me! Help me! Help me!" he heard her whispering
desperately, and it shook him badly in that supreme moment. But, for
the love he bore her, he meant that there should be no faltering in
his stroke. Abruptly, the girl felt him start violently, and he began
to quiver from head to feet. He cried out something in a strange
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he said in a sort of whispering, husky shout. "I can
see! I can see! Oh, my God, I can see! We're going to win! Mary,
Mary! we're going to win! I can see! I can see! I can see! I tell
you, I can see!"</p>

<p>He loosed her and put both his hands up to his bandages, which had
slid down on to his nose, and tore them away in a mad kind of
fashion, while the girl stood limp and sick against him, still
half-fainting.</p>

<p>"I can see! I can see!" he began to reiterate again.</p>

<p>He seemed to have gone momentarily insane with the enormous
revulsion from utter despair to hope. Suddenly he caught the girl
madly into his arms, staring down at her through the darkness. He
hugged her savagely to him, whispering hoarsely his refrain of:</p>

<p>"I can see! I can see! I tell you I can see!"</p>

<p>He held her a single instant or two like this; then he literally
tossed her into one of the upper bunks.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" he whispered, his voice full of the most intense
purpose. "I'm going to get square with that brute now. There's a
chance for both of us. Here, take the knife in case I don't manage.
Just lie still, whatever happens. You must be out of the way. I could
tackle a hundred of them now."</p>

<p>He was silent, listening. By the sound of the men's voices, the
second mate knew that they had halted some little distance from the
doorway. There they hung for a few moments, no man anxious to be the
first to face the big officer. For they had no knowledge of his
blindness.</p>

<p>Then he caught Pathan's voice urging them on. "Go on, lads! Go on!
There won't be much fight left in him!"</p>

<p>At that, a feeling of dismay filled him. It was evident that
Pathan was not going to head the attack, and he might die without
ever getting his hands on to him.</p>

<p>From the irresolute men came a shuffle of feet. Then a man's voice
rose--</p>

<p>"Trow de flare into ze hoose."</p>

<p>To the second mate the remark suggested a course of action. He
threw himself upon a sea-chest, so that his face could be seen from
the doorway. He kept perfectly still. If the man threw the flare into
the house they would see his damaged face and think him dead. It
might be that the coward Pathan would venture to come into the
place--then!</p>

<p>Thud! Something struck the floor near him.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes shut. He could see no light; but the smell of
burning paraffin was plain in his nostrils. He listened intently and
seemed to catch the sound of stealthy footsteps. Abruptly, a voice
just without the doorway shouted:</p>

<p>"They're both dead! Both of 'em!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>It was Pathan's voice. He heard the noise of booted feet
approaching at a run. They hesitated one instant on the threshold,
then came within, and a surge of barefoot pads followed. The booted
feet came to a stand not two yards away.</p>

<p>For an instant there was silence, a bewildered, awestruck silence.
Pathan's voice broke it.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said. "My God!"</p>

<p>Immediately afterward he screamed, as the huge, bloodstained form
of the big officer hurled itself upon him. There were cries from the
men, and a pell-mell rush to escape. Someone fell upon the flare and
extinguished it.</p>

<p>There was a shivering silence. It was filled abruptly by the
beginning of a sobbing entreaty from Pathan. This shrilled suddenly
into a horrid screaming. The men were no longer trying for the
doorway, for the second mate had got between it and them. They could
see him indistinctly against the moonlight beyond. He was flogging
the steel side of the house with something. Beyond the hideous
thudding of the blows, the house was silent.</p>

<p>One of the crouched men, tortured to madness, threw a
belaying-pin. The next instant the second mate hurled himself among
them. He had the battered steel door for a weapon, and the edge of it
was as a plowshare amidst soil.</p>

<p>Amid the cries of the men, the side of the house rang out a dull
thunder beneath the weight of some blind, misdirected blow.</p>

<p>Most of the men escaped upon their hands and knees, creeping out
behind the man who smote and smote. They got to the forecastle upon
all fours, too terrified and bewildered even to get to their feet.
There, in the darkness, behind closed and barred doors, they sat and
sweated, in company of those who had hesitated to enter the
house.</p>

<p>Presently the ship was quiet.</p>

<p>The berserker rage eased out of the second mate and he perceived
that the house was empty, and the mutiny truly ended. He cast the
heavy steel door clanging through the open doorway, out on to the
main deck, a dripping testimony of a man's prowess against enormous
odds.</p>

<p>He stood a moment, breathing heavily. Then, remembering, he
wheeled round in the darkness to where, in the gloom of the upper
bunk, the girl lay shivering, with her hands pressed tightly over her
ears.</p>

<p>He caught her up in his great arms, with the one word, "Come!" and
stepped through the open doorway into the moonlight, the fallen door
ringing under his tread. Then, master of his ship, he carried her aft
to the cabin.</p>
