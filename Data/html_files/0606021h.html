<h1>The Ghosts at Grantley</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Leonard Kip</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>The London stagecoach dropped me at the gatelodge of Grantley
Grange, and according to my usual custom I started up to the Hall on
foot. It was such a pleasant Christmas morning as perhaps is not
often seen, and might well have tempted to a longer walk than that
short mile up the carefully trimmed avenue. There had been a slight
fall of snow, a mere sprinkle indeed; but it was sufficient to clothe
the brown turf with a dainty tint of pearl, and to make the dry
leaves rattle crisp beneath the feet, and to project the great oaks
in seemingly more ancient grandeur against the brightened background
and generally to give an unusually cheery and exhilerating aspect to
the whole scenery of the park.</p>

<p>When I had nearly reached the Hall, the church clock struck noon,
and immediately all the bells began to ring out a merry Christmas
peal. Up and down, hither and thither, now a snatch of tune and again
a meaningless clashing of all the bells at once--single notes and
double and triple concords, and, in fact, everything that
well-disposed bells ever can or will do--so it ran on right cheerily.
Now it was that I anticipated my Uncle Ruthven would hasten out to
meet and welcome me. For I knew that he was fond of listening to the
chimes; and when the changes were being sounded upon them he would
not unfrequently sit at the open window, the better to enjoy
them.</p>

<p>And of course, as I could now plainly see the Hall through the
leafless trees, he from his open window could as readily watch my
approach. Somewhat to my momentary chagrin, however, he did not come
forth or even meet me at the door, and I was suffered to enter
unannounced. And passing through the main hall, I wandered into the
library.</p>

<p>There I found my Uncle Ruthven standing in the middle of the
floor, his head thrown back, his eyes fixed intently upon the
opposite wall, one arm raised in front to the level of his face, the
other hand thrown behind him, an expression of resolute determination
impressed upon every feature, his whole appearance and position
resembling that of the antique Quolt Thrower.</p>

<p>Evidently he had been engaged in similar action; for, in a moment,
he stepped to the other side of the room, picked up a short, fat book
which had been thrown thither, and replaced it upon the table.</p>

<p>"Anatomy of Melancholy," he remarked, turning to me with a little
chuckling laugh. "The first person who for a long while has got the
book all through him--eh, Geoffrey? Though, of course, we all relish
a little of it, now and then. Hit him directly upon the breast, and
it went through him as through a summer mist, dropping out behind
between his shoulder blades. Of course he has vanished, taking the
hint of not being longer wanted here."</p>

<p>"Who, Uncle Ruthven?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, the ghost, of course," was the answer.</p>

<p>I was a little startled at this. It is true that I had sometimes
thought that the library at Grantley Grange might be just the place
for ghosts. It was wainscoted heavily with carved oak darkened in
tint with the seasoning of four centuries. Above, the walls were
covered with hangings of Spanish leather, stamped in quaint pattern.
The fireplace was deep set and broad--so deep and broad, indeed, that
the great logs smoldering within appeared no larger than ordinary
sticks. The windows were projected into oriels with heavy mullions
and let in the light, encumbered with a thousand stray shadows. The
tables and chairs and high bookcases seemed almost immovable with
their sculptured massiveness, and as though designed for a race of
giants. Queer lamps hung from the ceiling and grotesque candlesconces
projected themselves from the walls, each with heavy metal shades
that would shut in more light than they sent forth. Over the mantel
and beside the doors were paintings blackened with age; a Salvator
Rosa, turned by the grime of time into a mere confusion of different
shadows, with only here and there a touch of faded light for
contrast, and, on either hand, eight or ten old portraits in ruffs
and crimson coats and armor, cracked and worm-eaten and sometimes
almost undistinguishable in face, but serving in costume to show the
different careers into which, in times past, the fates or
inclinations of the originals had carried them. A gloomy old library,
indeed, full of crevices that would not stay closed, and cobwebs that
could not be got at, and drafts that came from no one knew where, and
flickering shades that seemed to obey no philosophic law, but stole
here and there across wall and ceiling as their fancy led them. So
that not unnaturally it appeared at times as though the place could
never have been made for man's enjoyment, but rather as a hall for
witches' Sabbath or ghostly revels; and as I watched the subdued and
hesitating flickering of an errant sunbeam across the tarnished gilt
pattern of the Spanish leather, it was not difficult for queer
fancies and imaginings to take hold of me. But, after all, they were
mere idle conceits, and at the most I had not for an instant
anticipated the actual presentment of unearthly visitants.</p>

<p>"The ghost, did you say?" I therefore repeated, in some
amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, the ghost. Has been here every Christmas for many a year.
Always comes just as the chimes strike up at noon, as regularly as
though they had waked him. If you had ever before this happened to
spend a Christmas with us, you might have met him yourself. Assumes
that he belongs to the house, and that therefore he has his vested
rights in it. Frightened me a little at the first, but have become
used to him now and do not care. Am rather disposed, indeed, to lord
it over him with high hand; and he is such a patient ghost that it
hardly seems to make much difference with him. Am sorry always, in
fact, if I speak crossly to him. But, then, you know my temper,
Geoffrey, and how little I can brook presumption. How, then, would
you feel if a ghost were to come, implying that he was the master of
the house and that you were merely a visitor? Getsjust so far,
indeed, and then vanishes without telling anything important."</p>

<p>I looked wonderingly at Uncle Ruthven thus calmly discoursing
about the supernatural.</p>

<p>"But do you ever let him get further than that?" I suggested, my
eyes wandering to the book upon the table.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Geoffrey--perhaps not. I suppose that if I were more
patient he would talk a little better to the purpose. But then I am
very quick tempered, and it is so exasperating, every Christmas to go
through the very same thing. I always throw a book at him and am
sorry for it afterward. It is certainly not the hospitable thing upon
my part. But then to be so constantly beset, year after year, and not
to know how many more there may be of them. For there is at least one
other ghost somewhere about the house, Geoffrey. I have never seen
him, but Bidgers the butler has, and he says it is as like this
fellow as two peas. And if I am too polite to them, who knows but
that they may be encouraged to come in swarms and make the house very
uncomfortable? But let us leave all that for the present. You will be
wanting to see your room, I suppose. The South Oriel, just past the
second landing. Bidgers will carry up your portmanteau."</p>

<p>"Am sorry, by the way, that Lilian has not yet returned from the
continent. She could, of course, make your stay much more pleasant
for you than I can. But will do my best, Geoffrey. Luncheon at one,
as usual." Escorted by Bidgers, I proceeded upstairs to the South
Oriel. It was a large apartment upon the south side of the house,
with a broad octagonal window projection. If possible, the furniture
was heavier and more antiquated than that of the library. There were
quaint old tapestry hangings to the bedstead, so queer and faded that
it seemed almost as though they might have been embroidered during
the Crusades. The wardrobe was a marvel of size and solidity, and
gave the impression that in troublous times, obnoxious owners of the
estate might have safely been concealed in a false recess. Other
articles of furniture were in similar style, and all together gave
quite a gloomy aspect to an apartment that naturally, if left to
itself, might have been well disposed to be cheerful. The effect was
not diminished by a dingy picture over the mantelshelf, representing
a funeral urn and drooping willow worked in hair, with an exceedingly
numerous and mournfully dressed family coming two by two down a
winding path to weep in concert around the tomb. While I gazed
solemnly at this work of art, a ragged yew tree kept striving at
every breath of wind to thrust one of its gnarled old branches in at
the window; and putting all things together, the cheerfulness went
out of me entirely, and the idea of ghosts came in quite as naturally
as in the library. I tried to shake it off, remembering my late
experience and not wishing to have my mind burdened with any further
queer fancies of the kind; and after a moment or two, indeed, seemed
to be succeeding very tolerably and became able to hum an operatic
drinking song with comparative ease and correctness. Just then,
however, happening to turn my head, I saw a strange figure standing
near the foot of the bed and gazing at me with fixed but not
unpleasing or unfriendly expression.</p>

<p>The figure of a pleasant young fellow; hot, to all appearance,
over twenty-two years of age, and exhibiting a lifelike rotundity and
opacity that would have prevented any suspicion in my mind of the
supernatural, if I had not had my uncle's word for it, or if I had
discovered any way in which the stranger could have entered the room
without my seeing him. A handsome young fellow, courtly in manner and
dress, with coat of purple velvet, slashed and embroidered the whole
length of the sleeves, a dainty little rapier swinging at his side
and a plumed cap held in his hand. Hair falling in long curls over
his broad lace collar, and the beard twisted into a point, while the
small mustachios also twined into points turned up against the
cheeks. A mild, responsive kind of face, with courteous smiles and
replete with indications of gentle disposition.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly happy to meet you," he remarked, playing with
the gold-lace upon his sword hilt. "The more so that since I have
been ill, so few persons come to visit me at all. I do not know that
I have seen anybody of late, excepting the butler; and even he
appears to be a new butler, most unaccountably put into possession by
some other and pretended authority. I must in-quire into it when I am
completely restored."</p>

<p>"You say that you have been ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a faintness and much uneasy want of rest at night,
principally arising from this lump in my chest; and that, in turn,
coming from the attack upon me by my brother Harold. Would be glad to
introduce him to you if it were not for that. But I put it to you
now: after what has happened could I show him any such attention, or,
indeed, associate with him at all? If cousin Beatrice were here,
now--" At this moment there came a rap at the door; and the ghost,
shrinking a little toward one side, began to pale before me, and I
saw that he was slowly fading away, beginning at the legs, and so the
line of invisibility extending upward until gradually the whole
figure had entirely vanished. Again I saw in its entirety the carved
footboard which he had hitherto partially obscured; there was nothing
left, indeed, to remind me of the strange visitant.</p>

<p>And opening the door I saw only Bidgers, the butler.</p>

<p>"Luncheon is ready, Master Geoffrey," he said. "No fish today, for
the West stage is not in, but the mushrooms is particularly fine.
Heard you talking to the ghost as I came along--the upstairs ghost,
not Sir Ruthven's downstairs ghost. Sir Ruthven has only seen the
downstairs one, but I've seen both. Saw this one last Christmas,
about this time. He would not speak to me, however, it being that I
am only the butler. They're very much alike, Master Geoffrey. There's
a very nice haunch of venison for dinner today, let me recommend; and
the kidneys is not to be despised, either."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>After that, and during the remainder of my visit, nothing else
happened especially worthy of mention. The Christmas festivities
passed off as they generally do; and the next morning I returned to
London, where my recollection of the ghosts soon began to die away.
At first, indeed, as is natural, I could think of nothing else. But
inasmuch as my Uncle Ruthven had taken the matter so coolly, I began
to be impressed by a careful and more deliberate consideration of his
manner, and to wonder whether I might not have imagined many of the
most singular circumstances attending the incident; until, at last, I
concluded that there could have been no ghost at all, but that I must
have dreamed the whole story.</p>

<p>In addition, my time became so fully occupied that I had few
occasions in which I might engage in desultory wandering of idle
curiosity or speculation; for during the first eight months I was
diligently employed reading for my admission to the Bar. After that,
I was actively forgetting most of what I had learned, giving myself
up as escort to my cousin Lilian. She had returned from her travels
upon the continent, and with her father was stopping awhile in London
before continuing on to the Grange. It was my pleasing duty to remain
at Lilian's side most of the time, Sir Ruthven being glad to avoid
the toil of active companionship. I was very much in love with
Lilian, but would not for the world have prematurely told her of
it--it would have made her so tyrannical. At last, of course, we
quarreled. It was the day before Sir Ruthven and Lilian returned
home; and she informed me that she was going on the 10.45 stagecoach,
and that she would be seriously displeased if I attempted to see her
off. This looked well for me upon the whole, I thought, and I started
for the coach at once. As ill luck would have it, I missed it, a
circumstance which really helped my cause; since Lilian, being
thereby persuaded that I understood it to be a lasting quarrel, felt
suitably piqued into anxiety and regret.</p>

<p>A little before Christmas, Sir Ruthven wrote me to run down to the
Grange as usual. With his letter came a perfumed note from Lilian,
stating that if she could, she would gladly be away at Christmas with
her Aunt Eleanor; but since she could not, but was obliged to remain
home, she would consider it a great insult if I presumed to visit the
Grange before she could get away in some other direction. I was
wonderfully encouraged at this, feeling that all was going on well;
and packing my trunk at once, I went down by the earliest stage on
Christmas morning.</p>

<p>Again the chimes happened to be ringing just as I alighted; and,
as before, no one coming forth to meet me, I pressed on to the
library, there to make my respects to Uncle Ruthven, feeling well
assured that I should find him in his accustomed seat beside the
fireplace. He was in the room, indeed, but not sitting down. He was
standing beside the chair and bowing with great affection of
cordiality to some one in the further corner of the room. Looking in
that direction, I beheld a young fellow in court suit of two
centuries ago, with hand upon his heart, bowing back to my uncle with
still greater excess of old-fashioned courtesy and cordiality; and I
did not for an instant doubt that I was looking upon the downstairs
ghost. Almost the duplicate of the other one, indeed. Evidently about
the same age, with equally agreeable, sunny, ingratiating
expression.</p>

<p>Like the other, he had thick curls falling over the collar, beard
cultivated to a point, slashed velvet coat, laces, gold tassels, and
a slim, daintily decorated rapier. The most notable differences
consisted in his complexion and hair being a shade darker, and his
coat being of a lively crimson. It was a pleasant thing to see these
two persons salaaming cordially and ceremoniously to each other; my
uncle bowing until he struck the table behind him, and the ghost
bending over in responsive courtesy until the point of the scabbard
of his sword tipping up, made a new scratch upon the worm-eaten
picture of Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>"You see, Geoffrey," my uncle whispered between his repeated
genuflexions, "he has come again to the very minute. The very same
time as last year, just as though the chimes waked him up. I remember
that you then thought that perhaps I was accustomed to cut him short
rather too suddenly. We will be more cautious now, and will not end
until we get his whole story out of him." Then to the ghost "I am
rejoiced to see you once more, kind sir."</p>

<p>"It gives me equal and exceeding pleasure," responded the ghost.
"And I know that my brother Arthur would be similarly gratified could
he only know about your arrival. But, then, how is he to know? After
his conduct toward me--the obloquy he has thrown around me, in
fact--it certainly would be beneath my dignity to approach him, even
for the sake of imparting informa-tion. I can, therefore, merely
myself welcome you."</p>

<p>"Now, just listen to that!" muttered Uncle Ruthven, beginning to
flush up angrily. "I have done my best; but is it possible to
continue politeness with a person who insists upon treating me as his
guest? I treat him with all the cordiality I can muster, and the only
result of it is that he turns around and seems to patronize me."</p>

<p>It chanced that, moved by the first warmth of my uncle's courtesy,
the ghost had advanced a little, as though to meet us, and thereby he
now stood between us and the window. This change of position seemed
to produce a marvelous alteration in his appearance. The face so fair
and genial and prepossessing became at once a queer confusion of
lines, every feature being obscured by what looked like converging
cuts and wrinkles, making the whole expression of the countenance
unintelligible. It was only for an instant, however. The next moment,
the ghost moving away from the window, his face became as
before--clear, distinct, filled with amiable and courteous refinement
and intelligence. It was not until afterward that the mystery
explained itself. Now, indeed, the singular appearance had lasted for
such a brief moment that it seemed scarcely worth while to seek an
explanation. The only thing, in fact, that particularly struck me was
a red line extending around the throat, as though the result of a
forced compression. This was observable even after the ghost had
passed from directly before the window, and until he had moved
completely out of reach of the entire spread of sunlight.</p>

<p>"If Cousin Beatrice were here," remarked the ghost in
continuation, "she would undoubtedly be very happy to take part in
entertaining you. But where is she now? It is some days since I have
seen her. Do you think it possible that Brother Arthur, in addition
to the ignominy to which he has subjected me by his unjust
suspicions, can have influenced her mind against me? If so, as long
as I live, I will never--" "Listen again to that! As long as he
lives! How can anybody stand such drivel?" cried Uncle Ruthven. "I
suppose, Geoffrey, you will now see that it is as well to put an end
to this first as last?"</p>

<p>With that, as upon the previous Christmas, my uncle seized a large
book and vindictively let fly at the stranger. If until that time I
had had any doubts as to his unsubstantial nature, they were now
relieved. Corporeal and opaque as he had seemed, it was none the less
true that the volume, striking him in the stomach, passed completely
through him as through a stratum of air, falling upon the floor
behind, while the figure remained unblemished and uninjured; with
this exception, however, that naturally he seemed scarcely pleased
with the roughness of the reception, and a shadow of discontent
flickered across his face. Then appearing to comprehend that possibly
he might be unwelcome, he slowly faded away.</p>

<p>"Middleton's Cicero, this time," remarked my uncle, wiping his
face and gazing toward the weapon he had just so successfully used.
"And the fellow has digested that as well as the volume last year. At
this rate he will get my whole library into him before long. I cannot
help it, Geoffrey. You saw that I tried my best to be polite. But
when a ghost acts as though he owned the house, and moreover talks as
though he were alive, mortal man could not withstand the temptation
to cut him down. Well, well, get ready for lunch, Geoffrey. The South
Oriel, as last year."</p>

<p>Of course, being sent up to the same room and the old program
seeming to begin being played, I expected once again to meet the
purple-coated ghost. And as is natural, I went up with some little
trepidation. For it is one thing to have a ghost appear to you; good
natured and smiling from the first; and another thing deliberately to
throw one's self in the way of a ghost who might not happen at the
moment to be in a very pleasant humor, and might exert some
supernatural power to make himself extremely disagreeable. All the
time I was dressing, I looked uneasily over my shoulder, in search of
apparitions. But inasmuch as we seldom find what we most surely
expect to see, I was left entirely undisturbed, and finally began my
descent to the dining room with feelings greatly relieved and
composed.</p>

<p>Passing the drawing-room, I heard the subdued rustle of silk, and
entering, found Cousin Lilian all arrayed for luncheon and smoothing
herself out before the fire. Of course after what had passed in
London, she swept me a stately courtesy, addressing me by my surname
as though I were a stranger whom she had casually met the previous
day; and of course I bowed in her presence with ceremonious reverence
befitting the first presentation of Raleigh to Queen Elizabeth. Then
Lilian, slightly lifting her eyebrows in spirit of wonderment at my
intrusion, remarked that she believed Sir Ruthven was in the library.
I replied that I had already seen Sir Ruthven and had found him
busily engaged with a ghost; and that as this seemed to be their
reception day and others might be expected by him, I would not
intrude upon him for a while, but with her permission would prefer to
remain where I was.</p>

<p>These preambles having been thus satisfactorily entered into, of
course we began making up by throwing at each other little spiteful
remarks of an epigrammatic nature; now and then spontaneous, but for
the most part carefully manufactured weeks before and treasured up
for the occasion. Snapping these off from side to side like
torpedoes, and mutually rebounding them harmlessly from our casemated
natures, we gradually composed our feelings and began getting along
very well on the path to reconciliation. How long it might have taken
under ordinary circumstances I cannot tell; but it happened all at
once that Lilian was startled into an unexpectedly rapid advance. For
of a sudden I felt her hand grasping my arm, and she called me by my
first name in the old familiar manner; and turning, I saw her gaze
fixed with a wondering but not altogether alarmed expression upon the
opposite corner of the room.</p>

<p>"See, Geoffrey!" she whispered. "The upstairs ghost! How comes he
in here?"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>Turning, I saw the purple velvet ghost at last, bowing low to the
floor, with a humble courtesy that disarmed wrath, though nonetheless
did an explanation seem necessary.</p>

<p>"Really, my good sir," I therefore said, "this intrusion--"</p>

<p>"I must apologize for it, certainly," he remarked, again bowing
low. "I was a little behindhand this morning in reaching the South
Oriel. And passing through the hall, I saw a female figure inside
this room. I entered, expecting to meet my Cousin Beatrice. I see
that I am mistaken. Last night I slumbered more uneasily than
usual--the lump in my chest causing me very great disturbance, and
doubtless it has excited my nerves and made me easily deceived. It
has all come from Brother Harold's outrage upon me, I suppose. Which
being so, it only remains for me to rake my leave, with apology for
the intrusion."</p>

<p>"Stay yet a moment," I said. "This is my cousin Miss Lilian, who
certainly will not! fear you and will forgive your slight mistake.
And--and I have so much to say to you."</p>

<p>In fact, I felt that this might be the last time I should see him;
and that it would be no more than a charity to enlighten him as to
his true condition. It was a very sad thing to see a bright, amiable
young ghost going around century after century as though he were
still alive, and I decided that it would be a kind action to correct
his error. Moreover, it happened that just at this moment, chance
threw a convincing explanation within my reach. For as the ghost
stepped a little to one side preparatory to taking his departure, it
came about that he stood between me and the window, just as the other
ghost had done; and in like manner, every feature seemed obscured
with a network of contrary lines and wrinkles. But as he chanced to
remain there a little longer than the other one had done, the mystery
became almost at once revealed. I saw that the singular appearance
was caused by the strong sunlight showing through him, whereby his
whole head appeared as a transparent object. It was exhibited as a
mass of dim, lurid light, not entirely endowed with all the bright
translucent qualities of glass, but rather as when a sheet of thin
porcelain is held up to the light, so that its semicloudy
transparency is revealed, and with it, any dark spots or
imperfections in the surface are brought to notice. In like manner,
our visitor's head now seemed transformed with the brightness of the
sunlight behind it, so that its former opacity was gone and there was
a light, cloudy appearance as of a dissolving mist, marked in every
direction with straight and curved lines of greater or less
intensity. At first, the features, excepting as they appeared in
profile, seemed entirely to have vanished beneath a confusion of
other lines; but a moment's observation assured me of the contrary.
They were all still there--the sparkling eye, the delicate mouth, the
well-shapen ear. With a little attention, I could still trace the
sweep of their several outlines. It was merely that those outlines
were now somewhat confused by the addition of other lines appearing
from within the skull. These also, I found that with a little study,
I could still make out. There was a broad, irregularly-curved mark
showing the outline of the lobes of the brain. I could follow the
whole ball of the eye beneath its socket and the fainter lines which
connect the eye with the brain behind. The drum and the small bones
of the ear, and the twisted passages from the nose to the ear were
all now clearly defined. The palate, too, and the sides of the
throat, until hidden at last beneath the laced collar of that courtly
coat. In fine, under the influence of that bright sunlight behind it,
the young fellow's head became something like one of the modern
medical wax preparations, exhibiting every portion of its frame in
exact position; except that, far superior to any work of art, it did
not require to be taken apart for study, but could be examined in
detail, just as it stood.</p>

<p>"How long," I said, myself moving a little one side so that he
might not appear between me and the window; by which judicious
movement he became at once like any other person, his features
returning to their usual distinctness of outline, unclouded by any
rival lines and curves from behind; "how long have you been thus ill
and disturbed at night by pain within your chest?"</p>

<p>"A week, or even more, I think," he said.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I responded; "here is where you have made a trifling
mistake in your chronology--you, and the other, as well. This little
episode which you believe has occupied a few days or so, has lasted,
in reality, upward of two centuries. You have been thrown into a
certain condition of mind in which you are unable to take due note of
time. Why this is so, I cannot attempt to explain. The melancholy
fact remains that you have already been wandering some two hundred
years, and for all we know, may be destined to wander to all
eternity. In proof of this, I might refer you to your costume, which
is of the fashion of Charles the Second; while, in fact, we are
living in the thirty-eighth of Victoria."</p>

<p>I paused for a moment here, thinking that he might wish to ask
some question. But as he maintained a perplexed silence, I
continued:</p>

<p>"You are in further error in believing that the only consequence
of some injury you have received has been mere restlessness at night.
Instead of which, you died and of course were suitably buried. And
consequently, you are not now a man, but merely a ghost. It may be
unpleasant to be told this, but it is as well that you should know it
first as last. And, after all, there can be no harm in being a
well-conducted, creditable ghost. As such, you are allowed to appear
each Christmas day for a few minutes, at the expiration of which,
doubtless, you return to your grave. There, I presume, you slumber
until the next Christmas day, for you seem to have no definite
knowledge of your whereabouts. At the least you must be comfortable,
which perhaps is more than can be said of many ghosts. Even Hamlet's
father seems to have suffered torments; though there is presumptive
evidence that he was a very good man, and totally unlike his
brother."</p>

<p>"You are incredulous about what I am now telling you? In proof of
it, let me stand you directly in front of the window, so that the
sunlight will strike full upon your person. Then let me hold this
looking-glass before you. Now studying your reflection carefully, you
will see that you are transparent; which, I take it, is the surest
proof any man can enjoy of his being a ghost. You can trace out the
passages of your ears, the convolutions of your brain, the course of
your jugular vein. This line, which you might easily mistake for a
nerve or cord, is merely a crack in the looking-glass. Should you
feel disposed, hereafter, for your amusement, to study your internal
anatomy more thoroughly, I would advise a new and more perfect
mirror. But can you any longer doubt your condition?"</p>

<p>"I can no longer doubt, indeed," groaned the ghost. "But what,
alas, can I now do?"</p>

<p>"A thousand things," I responded. "I take it that, inasmuch as men
must not live idle lives, in like manner ghosts, also, may have their
duties to perform. Surely, it can scarcely be intended, in the
economy of the unseen world, that they should pass lives--or, rather,
existences--of careless idleness. I know that, were I a ghost, I
would do my best to find some useful employment. I think that I would
endeavor to obtain some occupation that might be of benefit to the
world I had left behind. Suppose, for instance, that you endeavored
to retain some, even trifling, recollection of the nature of your
abode in the unseen world, how you are associated, whither you are
sent, and other facts of a kindred character, and were to impart them
to the human race from time to time through myself. Do you not think
that you would be doing great good, as well as entitling yourself to
the gratitude of all living men?"</p>

<p>The ghost mutely shook his head. Evidently he did not care
particularly about the gratitude of living men.</p>

<p>"Or suppose," I continued, struck with a new, and, in my
estimation, better idea--for it happened that I had lately been
interesting myself deeply in medical jurisprudence--"suppose that you
were to apply yourself to the benefit of the human race in an
anatomical or pathological capacity. There is on record the case of a
man who had a hole in the side of his stomach through which processes
of digestion could be watched, to the great service of medical
science. Need I say that, for every purpose of interest or utility,
you surpass him infinitely? I must assume, with tolerable certainty,
that if your head is transparent, so, also, is your whole body; and
that the workings of your inner system are simply hidden from sight
by your clothing. Divested of that, you could easily unfold, in the
strong light of the sun, the entire operations of your heart, your
lungs and your stomach. Daily could you have your seances, and new
discoveries could be noted down. There must be some thin, ghostly,
almost impalpable fluid in your system answering the purpose of blood
in the human frame, and of this physicians might succeed in watching
the circulation and flow. There are vexed questions in medical
science as to the real use of certain vessels and
attachments---whether they are actually necessary in the human
constitution, or whether they are mere rudimentary relics of a lower
organization. These questions you might succeed in determining. In
fact--"</p>

<p>I had reached thus far, becoming so transported with the
increasing magnitude of my speculations that I no longer looked at
the ghost, but with half-closed eyes gazed upward at the ceiling;
when suddenly Lilian plucked me gently by the sleeve, and, with quiet
movement of the eyes, called my attention more directly to our
visitor. He was standing motionless beside the window; but I observed
that the pleasant expression had faded from his face, an angry flush
was mounting into every feature, grim, transporting rage was clouding
every line. And, as I paused in natural hesitation, he turned roughly
toward me.</p>

<p>"Have you done?" he cried, bursting out with an old-fashioned oath
of the days of the royal Stuarts. "Have you come to the end of your
base proposals? Have you reflected sufficiently what it is to dare to
suggest to Sir Arthur Grantley, of the Court of Charles, that he
should pass his time illustrating the labors and theories of leeches,
quacks, and charlatans?"</p>

<p>Another old-fashioned oath, a half withdrawal of the slender
rapier from its sheath, a driving it down again with impetuous, angry
energy, and the ghost strode wildly out of the drawing room, and was
no more seen. But for two or three moments we could hear him growling
forth his queer old court oaths as he rattled away along the outside
passage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>Lilian and I gazed at each other in speechless wonderment. The
bell rung for luncheon, and we passed toward the dining room; still
with thoughts too deep for words.</p>

<p>"Can it be," I said at length, as we entered the other room, "that
this person, whom we had supposed to be merely some retainer of the
family, was in reality its head? That he could have been an ancestor
of yours, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"Papa will know," she answered. "We will ask him at luncheon."
Then, when the old gentleman sat eating his nuts and raisins and
sipping his wine--before which time he disliked to be disturbed about
anything excepting the occupation immediately in view--she began:</p>

<p>"Was there ever a Sir Arthur Grantley, papa?"</p>

<p>"Let me think," mumbled Uncle Ruthven. "Yes, there was a Sir
Arthur about two centuries ago. And now the story begins to come to
me. There were two brothers--twins; the oldest having the estate and
title, and the youngest being a captain in the Royal Guard. One would
have supposed that, being so nearly of an age and closely related,
they would have kept the peace; but the contrary was the fact. They
quarreled so that one of them murdered the other, and was suitably
hanged for it."</p>

<p>"Is there record of the fact, Uncle Ruthven?" "Nowhere, unless it
may be in the State Trials. I have never looked there. You will find
no allusion to it in Burke or Debrett. Those useful and accommodating
compilers, out of regard for the family honor, I suppose, merely
state that Harold Grantley died, aged twenty-two: a piece of
reticence which, after all, was scarcely worthwhile, considering that
it happened so long ago."</p>

<p>"Time is a great cleanser of family escutcheons. It would be
unpleasant to have a murder attached to the reputation of one's
father or grandfather; but carry it two centuries backs and no one
seems to care. If it were not so, there is scarcely a royal family on
earth which would not be hanging its head. I do not read that Her
Most Gracious Majesty Victoria ever makes herself miserable about any
suspicions attaching to the memory of Queen Mary of Scotland. In
fact, rather a disreputable ancestry, if distinguished, is better
than none at all. It is scarcely to be supposed, for instance, that
any of us would take it much to heart at finding Guy Fawkes seated
upon one of the limbs of the family tree. At any rate, we have no
reason to complain of this little murder in the Grantley line, seeing
that it finished up the direct descent in that quarter and sent down
the entail to us through a collateral branch."</p>

<p>With that, having exhausted his knowledge upon the subject, Uncle
Ruthven went on sipping his wine and turned the subject upon the
culture of turnips. But after luncheon Lilian and myself, feeling by
no means contented, slipped up to the library again and took down one
of the time-worn dusty volumes of the State Trials. The books had
evidently not been moved out of place for years; but it was easy,
having the reign, to find all that we wanted, and in a few minutes we
opened at the case of Rex Grantley. The book was very heavy, and at
the first we spread upon the table. This proving inconveniently high
we took to the sofa, where we let the volume rest on both our laps
and read together. It was very pleasant, altogether. It was necessary
for Lilian to lean over so that her curls brushed across my shoulder,
and at times I could feel her breath warm upon my cheek. That she
might have greater strength to hold her share of the book, I passed
my arm sustainingly about her waist; a fact which she did not seem to
realize, so intent was she upon the story of the murder. We have
often read about young men and maidens looking upon the same book and
in just such positions. In those narrations it is generally a book of
poetry, or at least a novel that interests them. I question if very
often a young lady sits with her lover absorbed in the story of a
murder committed by one of her own family and reads it without any
feeling except of curiosity about its mere incidents, and as coolly
as though it were Jack Shepperd or Oliver Twist.</p>

<p>But then, as Uncle Ruthven justly observed, it was so long
ago.</p>

<p>It appeared, then, from the account in the State Trials, that
Arthur and Harold Grantley were twin brothers of the age of
twenty-two. As Uncle Ruthven had stated, Arthur was the oldest and in
possession of the title and estate, while Harold held commission in
the Palace Guard.</p>

<p>Naturally the two brothers were thrown much together, and were
supposed to be greatly attached to each other. Of course, they
sometimes had their little disagreements; but, until the period of
the murder, it was never supposed that there was any especial ill
feelings between them. The trouble ensued about noon one Christmas
day. Harold had obtained leave to visit his brother at the Grange;
and after an early dinner--for they were alone and much form and
ceremony was dispensed with--they sat at the table, conversing,
eating filberts and drinking their wine.</p>

<p>Possibly they had been drinking too much; but not so much, in
fact, as to exhibit its effects upon them to any great extent. The
most that could be said was, that it might have tended to make them
quarrelsome; but as it turned out, this after all was the whole
mischief in the case, and much worse in its results than downright
and less harmful intoxication. It chanced that Sir Arthur had taken
the opportunity of exhibiting to his brother a certain valuable
heirloom, known in the family as the great Lancaster diamond, having
come into the line from a collateral Lancaster branch. It had lain
concealed in a secret closet during the Cromwellian troubles, and had
just been brought to light again. It is supposed that Sir Arthur,
being attached to their cousin Beatrice and wishing marriage with
her, had designed presenting her with the diamond; and that Harold,
being equally in love with her and perhaps with no less prospect of
success, had made objection; and that from this fact the quarrel had
arisen. Be that as it may, their voices were heard in loud dispute;
and suddenly Harold calling out for help, his brother was found lying
upon his back lifeless and with every appearance about the throat of
having been foully dealt with. Harold's account of the circumstance
was to the effect that Sir Arthur all at once had thrown himself back
in his chair and gasped and seemed to have been seized with a fit. On
the other hand, it was argued that young men of his vigorous
constitution did not readily die in fits--that the appear-ances of
foul play by strangulation were too evident--that there had certainly
been high words between them, a fact, indeed, which Harold was
obliged to admit--that the known passion of both the young men for
the same lady would have been sufficient of itself to produce
fraternal hatred and strife--and furthermore, that Harold would have
a supreme interest in his brother's death, by reason of the
succession to the estate. And then again, the diamond had
disappeared. If the death had been a natural one, the diamond would
not have been disturbed; but inasmuch as it was the leading cause of
the dissension, nothing was more natural than that the murderer
should have made away with it, by throwing it out of the window, into
the lake, most likely, so as to remove one great evidence of the
crime. Altogether the feeling ran very high against the surviving
brother, political prejudices that could scarcely now be explained
intervened to increase the excitement, while certain favorites of the
king, desiring promotion in the Guard by removal of one person of
higher rank, prejudiced the royal mind against pity or pardon. In
fine, after much agitation and a protracted trial, young Harold was
found guilty and executed.</p>

<p>"And this explains," I said to Lilian, "many circumstances that
hitherto have not been clear to me. The red line around the throat of
the downstairs ghost; the pain in the chest of the upstairs ghost--a
difficulty most naturally resulting from outside pressure--all these
things now tell the story very clearly, and agree most wonderfully
with the State trials account. Only---which at first seems
strange--the murdered now does not seem to remember that he was put
to death, nor the murderer that he was executed for it."</p>

<p>"That is, indeed, singular," said Lilian. "But, then, ghosts are
so silly!"</p>

<p>"At first sight, it may seem strange," I answered; "but not after
a moment's reflection. Violence endured by us in life is very often
with difficulty afterward brought to our memory. One has a fall or is
stricken down by a club and made senseless; he recovers after awhile,
and knows that in some way he has been injured, but does not remember
the actual fall or blow. And why should it be different if the injury
leads to death? Looking upon it in this light, and with this
philosophy, we see the young baronet awakening in the grave with no
conception of ever having been killed, but merely with some
indistinct idea of previous attack or vituperation. And, in the same
manner, we find the younger brother awakening in the belief that he
is still alive, and remembering not his execution at the hands of the
law, but only the fact of having been charged with some outrage
against the other, the nature of which he cannot comprehend, while
the circumstance of any charge being made at all grievously offends
and distresses him."</p>

<p>"All very plausible, indeed," responded Lilian. "But suppose that,
after all, he was innocent?"</p>

<p>"A thing very hard to believe, with so much contrary evidence," I
said. "All that is a mere woman's unreasoning supposition, with
endeavor to wipe off a blemish from the family escutcheon." "Pho! for
the family escutcheon," responded Lilian, putting up her lips in
pholike form. And as she spoke she looked so pretty that, having my
arm still about her waist, I began seriously to consider whether I
had not better improve the opportunity and now make my offer. So much
was already understood between us, indeed; and everyone, even Lilian
herself, knew very well that it was destined some day to come about,
as a suitable family arrangement long foreseen and often talked
about; and, therefore, what better moment than the present to
unburden my heart?</p>

<p>"I think, Lilian," I said, "that it is about time I spoke a word
or two to you about our future."</p>

<p>"Well, Geoffrey," she replied.</p>

<p>I saw the flush gather in her face, that she knew what must be
coming, that she anticipated tender avowal with loving expression. In
this last respect, at least, mindful of recent aggravations on her
part, I determined that I would disappoint her.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "it is not probable that Harold was innocent. And
therefore you must see for yourself, Lilian, that your family have
been a most disreputable lot. But for all that, having unfortunately
a strong personal prejudice in your favor, I am inclined to believe
that I shall not be doing myself too great injustice in offering you
my alliance."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, certainly, Geoffrey," she responded. "I cannot
but feel intensely gratified at the preference. I suppose that every
family must at some time or other meet its misfortune of a public
execution or some similar disgrace. I consider it particularly
fortunate that with us it has already happened. In your line of the
family it is yet to come; and if I may judge by circumstances, it
will probably take place during the present generation. And merely
that I may legally enjoy the privilege of standing at your side and
comforting you during that closing ordeal, I take pleasure in
accepting your offer."</p>

<p>And this is how Lilian and I became engaged.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>It was understood that the wedding would not take place
immediately. Uncle Ruthven had some old-fashioned notions about
matrimony, prominent among which was the idea that no young man
should marry without having the means of support from his profession,
so as to be independent of the fluctuations and liabilities to loss
of private fortune. Upon this basis, it was determined that we should
not wed until I had made a public and credible appearance at the
Bar.</p>

<p>This came about in the following October. I had been engaged as
third counsel in the great case of Charity-boy v. Church-warden, for
assault. Churchwarden had boxed the ears of Charity-boy for playing
marbles on a tombstone; but unfortunately had not succeeded in
catching him to do so until they were over the boundary-line of the
graveyard. Upon this defect, want of jurisdiction as to place was
alleged, and action brought. The suit had been running nearly five
years, and therefore could now reasonably be moved for trial. The
rector, curate, half the vestry and three of the bell-ringers had
been subpoenaed to give evidence and stood ready. It was necessary to
have, in addition, the testimony of the toy-maker who had sold the
marbles; and he, it happened, was on his deathbed at the north of
Scotland. A commission had been issued to take his testimony.</p>

<p>The toy-maker lay delirious for the most part, having a lucid
interval of about half an hour each day, during which he desired to
make his will. He was constantly prevented from doing so, however, by
the entrance of the commissioners demanding to take his testimony,
which so confused him that he always went off wandering again.
Pending the execution of the commission, of course an adjournment was
desired.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, both the senior counsel being away, it
devolved upon me to make the application for the adjournment, and
with a little difficulty about the pitch of my voice, I succeeded in
doing so. The judge said that if the other side were agreed, there
could be no objection; and the other side having duly consented, the
adjournment was ordered. Whereupon I wrote down to Sir Ruthven that I
had made my first appearance. Sir Ruthven immediately wrote back,
asking whether my speech would be reported in the Times. I replied
that I did not suppose it would, as the papers were unusually
interested in the Montenegro difficulty, to the exclusion of much
other valuable news. Uncle Ruthven thereupon responded that he was
satisfied, upon the whole, even if the Times was silent about me; and
that now that I had resources for support independent of inherited
estate, the wedding might come off immediately after Christmas. And
he told me to run down the day before Christmas, so that we could
have a pleasant little Christmas dinner by ourselves, before the
invited visitors began to arrive.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I arrived at Grantley Grange upon the after-noon of
the twenty-fourth, and was at once shown to my room by Bidgers, who
not only lighted me up, but followed me in to assist in unpacking my
wardrobe. And while doing so, naturally with the self-allowance of an
old family servant he let his tongue run loose with the gossip and
events of the day.</p>

<p>"A hamper just come in, Master Geoffrey, with a fine large salmon;
but that is for tomorrow. You must praise it when you see it, for Sir
Ruthven sets great store in having got it. There has been no ghosts
seen since you was here last--perhaps they have all gone away for
good. There is talk that the Earl of Kildare will be at the wedding
next week; but any which way, he has sent a silver pitcher. Maybe,
after all, the ghosts have all been locked lip where they are. Miss
Lilian's Aunt Eleanor has done better than the Earl of Kildare
though. She cannot come, they say; but such diamond earrings as she
has sent--almost as large as filberts, Mr. Geoffrey! As to the grapes
today, I am fearful there's a little mold on some of them; but the
oysters--"</p>

<p>"That will do--thank you, Bidgers," I said, tired of the running
stream; and Bidgers, taking the hint, affected to blow a speck of
dirt off the sleeve of my wedding coat, and gently glided out of the
room. I was not so much tired, indeed, as that I felt I would like to
be alone for thought.</p>

<p>Something in Bidgers last remark had awakened an association of
ideas in my mind; but of such intangible, confused character that I
could not follow it up to any definite purpose. Diamonds as large as
filberts--filberts and diamonds, so ran the words, through and
through my mind like the strain of a tune; but out of it all I could
not, with the utmost concentration of thought, gain any clue that I
might--follow up to a satisfactory certainty. At night the same--I
fell asleep with the old sequence of words running in my head, still
like the strain of a tune, as sometimes we will set to meter the
thumping of a railroad car. In the middle of the night I awoke; and
then there flashed upon mx' mind a solution of the puzzle, but so
wild and improbable, so idiotic and fantastic did it seem, that at
once I discouraged it. Even then, when scarcely half aroused, and at
an hour when the waking fancies run riot in premonition and alliance
with hardly more fanciful dreams, did I laugh at the crude conception
and try to beat it down, falling asleep again at last with mind
apparently entirely relieved of the foolish notion. But when in the
morning I awoke with the sun broadly shining in upon me, there again
was the queer idea; and now, wonderful to relate, though I lay with
the collectedness of thought appertaining to the open day, and with
little chance of crude fancies any longer overwhelming me, the idea,
though still as strange and ghostlike as before, no longer bore that
first impress of the ridiculous, but was as something real and to be
soberly and carefully considered. At least the experiment suggested
by it might be tried, though secretly and cautiously, so as not to
provoke ridicule in case it came to nothing.</p>

<p>Dressing myself, I stole softly downstairs. It was still very
early, and there was no one stirring below, excepting a housemaid
dusting the furniture. She merely looked up and then continued her
task, my habit of morning walks being too well known to excite
observation. I passed through the long window and came upon the bare
winter-stained lawn. There was the gardener, muffling anew some
plants in straw; but he too, merely touching his hat, said nothing.
Then I followed a gravel path around the terrace to the rear of the
house, and thence struck off to a little grove of pines a hundred
yards or so away.</p>

<p>In the midst of these was the burial vault of the Grantley family.
It was by no means a repulsive object, being merely a brick erection
a few feet above the surface of the ground, and originally
constructed with some pretense of architectural symmetry. Neither was
it an object of superstitious or sentimental reverence. In fact, at
the present time there were not more than twelve or fifteen of the
family laid away in it. It had been built four centuries ago, and
with accommodation for a hundred or so; but at the time of the
rebellion a party of Cromwell's troops came sweeping down upon the
house, and, being in want of material for bullets, turned all the
dead Grantleys out of doors and took their leaden coffins to cast
into ammunition. After that time the burials continued for only a few
generations; since which, the yard around the village church had
received the family dead. About ten years ago it had been found
necessary to open the vault in order to get the date of some
particular death for legal evidence. The long-closed door had stoutly
resisted, and at length the lock was obliged to be broken. It was
intended, of course, to restore the fastenings; but equally of
course, and as happens so often with matters that can be done any
day, the duty was postponed from time to time, and gradually came to
be no longer remembered. The closed door then warped open a little of
itself, and the gardeners leaned their tools against it, and after
awhile pushed the door further back, and slipped their tools just
inside out of the rain; and so, step by step, the almost empty vault
became only used as a toolhouse.</p>

<p>Vines were trained to grow over it, ferns gathered around its
base, and a stranger would have taken it for a somewhat dilapidated
icehouse.</p>

<p>I pushed the door open yet a little further and peeped within. The
sunbeams, still low and shut out by the screen of trees, could not
now enter; but enough light stole in to show a pile of rakes and hoes
just inside, and a little further along, a row of empty recesses,
built for coffins, but long since made vacant. Entering, I could see
that the recesses ran in double rows for some distance in front of
me, being at the further end shrouded in darkness. I drew out my
cigar lighter and by the aid of repeated tapers proceeded to explore.
Then I could see that at the further end, a few of the recesses were
filled with coffins. These were in various stages of decay. In all
cases, the dark coverings of cloth had moldered away and lay in
fragments at the side or on the stone floor below. In some, the outer
wooden shells were nearly whole; but in others, they had crumbled
into dust and splinters. With a few of the recesses, the names and
dates of the remains within were fastened at the lower edge upon
brass plates; with others, the plates had entirely disappeared. There
was one recess which contained a worm-eaten coffin of somewhat plain
construction, but no name or date or even evidence that any such had
ever been affixed. I could not resist the impression that here lay
the unfortunate Harold Grantley; given, as matter of right, a place
in this ancestral vault, but, through some charitable idea of letting
his unhappy fate become forgotten, denied all record that could lead
to future identification. Passing onward, with gathering assurance
that my search would not prove unavailing, at each minute renewing my
quickly expiring tapers, I carefully read every name, now and then
rubbing the brass plates with my handkerchief before I could decipher
the blurred old-fashioned letterings. Then, for a while, as the
number of remaining niches one by one was lessened without rewarding
my search, hope began to give way to disappointment. Only for a
moment, however; for soon, to my abundant gratification, I read upon
one of the plates, the words and characters, "Arthur Grantley, Obt.
Dec.</p>

<p>25, 1663, Aet 22."</p>

<p>Here then, lay he whom I sought, and I scrutinized attentively all
that remained. A moth-eaten, rat-torn pall, a nest of coffins, and
that was all. Uneasily for the instant I turned my head, dreading
lest the blithe young apparition with its purple and laced coat and
dangling sword should arise and demand wherefore I was about to
disturb him; but all remained quiet about me. I was alone with my own
thoughts and purposes, and could prosecute my designs unquestioned
and unimpeded.</p>

<p>I had feared lest I might be obliged to seek for assistance, but
it was not so. Every thing, in fact, seemed made ready and convenient
for me. The outer box was worm-eaten, warped and decayed, so that it
could be broken and brushed away in places with a mere stroke of the
hand; the leaden coffin inside had corroded, and the solder of the
seams parted, so that the joints had spread apart, and, with no great
effort, I was able to bend open the end; the mahogany coffin inside
of all had suffered similar decay with the outer box, and readily
parted. In a moment the outer end of all three coffins lay open, and
I could easily insert my hand.</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated. What if, as sometimes happens, the
remains had not suffered corruption, and my touch were to encounter a
solid form! Repressing this fear, I passed my hand stealthily within,
finding no obstruction. Only a little dust at the bottom, hardly deep
enough for a finger to write a name upon. This was all that was left
of the gay young courtier, twelfth baronet of Grantley. Slowly I let
my hand wander up along the bottom of the coffin, groping among the
dust, until two-thirds up to the top; then I struck against a small,
hard lump. My heart gave a loud thump of excitement. What could it
be? Was it the prize that I had hoped for, or was it merely some
fragment of unpulverized bone? Half wild with tremulous expectation,
I grasped the little lump of substance firmly between thumb and
forefinger, and hurried with it to the door of the vault. Even as I
approached the dim, lurid light just within the half-opened entrance,
I began to feel my assurances grow more sure; and when I emerged into
the bright glow of day beyond, and held my prize up against the
golden rays of the risen sun, I could no longer doubt that I had
gained possession of the long lost Lancaster diamond.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>When I returned to the house, I said nothing about what I had been
doing. It seemed as though the time for explanation would not come
until toward evening. How, in that broad garish light of morning,
could I venture to reveal that secret of dreams and darkness and
rifled tombs? How, indeed, would my story be believed, unless with
the glow of nightfall thrown around it to attune the listeners to
credence?</p>

<p>Moreover, what if, during the day, the ghost were to appear,
condemn my invasion of his sepulcher, demand his diamond, and
possibly, by threats of supernatural force and terrors, obtain it?
Certainly the accustomed hour for the ghosts was close at hand, and
at any moment they might visit us. Already Sir Ruthven sat in the
library awaiting his especial apparition. My uncle was, for the time,
in no particularly friendly mood toward ghosts; and he now loudly
declared that, whatever might before have been his courtesy, his
forbearance had at last ceased, and he would not tolerate their
coming. Certainly not now, he said, seeing that the house was
preparing for a season of festivity, and had other things than the
next world to think about. Accordingly he sat, watching, in his great
elbow chair, with the heaviest volume of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica
at his side, in readiness to crush out the first sign of ghost before
even a word of salutation could be uttered.</p>

<p>But to the wonder of all and greatly to Sir Ruthven's disgust as
well--seeing that, having made up his mind for action, he did not
like to feel that his time had been thrown away--no ghost appeared,
upstairs or down. Punctually at twelve, indeed, the chimes rang out
the merriest peal we had enjoyed for years--the changes were sounded
by the hundred with unusual exactness and celerity; yet all the time
my uncle sat unmolested, with his Encyclopaedia lying idle beside
him.</p>

<p>At length the day wore itself out, the bell sounded for dinner,
and we repaired to the dining room.</p>

<p>It was to be our last little dinner by ourselves; a very small
Christmas party, indeed, but on the morrow the guests would begin to
arrive and to break up our privacy, and then there could be no
complaint about lack of excitement in the household. This last day
Sir Ruthven had desired we should have for ourselves. But few as we
were, no one had forgotten that it was the Christmas season and
should be honored accordingly. Holly and mistletoe decked the room in
every direction. A great yule log lay cosily esconced in the
chimney-back and good humoredly tried to blaze up as merrily as the
smaller branches that crackled around it; though being so unwieldy,
it was not very successful in the attempt. But those smaller
branches, invading the yule log's smoldering dignity with their
blithe sport of gaiety, snapped and sputtered around it with
uproarious mirthfulness; sending none but the prettiest colored smoke
wreaths up the chimney, and casting out bright tongues of flames that
lighted up every corner of the room and gave a ruddy glow to the
time-faded portraits, and even brought out patches of cheerful
sunlight upon an old cracked Rembrandt that no one had ever been able
to decipher.</p>

<p>The table was set for us three only; but, in honor of the day,
with as much ceremony as though there were to be twenty present. A
tall branch wax-light, used only on occasions of great festivity, was
brought out from its green baize covering and planted in the center.
Treasures of antique silver, the very existence of which Sir Ruthven
had nearly forgotten, were exhumed from their places of long
concealment, and now once more, as in past centuries, pleasantly
glimmered in the gentle gleam of wax-light. Flowers here and there
unobtrusively exhaled sweet odors from tiny vases. There was to be a
boar's head brought out and placed on the table at the proper time
for each of us to look at and taste and pretend to enjoy. The
plum-pudding was turning out a great success--the greatest for many
years, as Bidgers whispered to me. All the circumstances of the scene
around us were soft, harmonious and cheerful; certainly now was the
time for me to tell my story.</p>

<p>With some little affectation of ceremony, perhaps, I drew forth
the Lancaster diamond and placed it in Lilian's hand. I told her that
I could make her no more valuable Christmas gift than to restore this
rich family relic of the past. Lightly I touched upon the process
whereby I had found it; rather elaborating, instead, the train of
thought that had led me to suspect where it had lain hidden. I
explained how the finding of the diamond gave new illustration to the
record in the State Trials, proving that the younger brother had not
been guilty of any murder at all--that during the agitation of a
quarrel the older brother must have accidentally swallowed the
diamond, mistaking it for one of the filberts that lay beside it near
his plate, and which were of similar size--how that this unfortunate
error had been sufficient of itself to cause his death by
suffocation--how that thereby the discoloration around the neck of
the deceased, as Well as the disappearance of the diamond were
properly accounted for--how that, most probably, it also gave an
explanation of the unpleasant lump in the chest of the crimson-coated
ghost.</p>

<p>"It is doubtless so," a soft voice thereat interrupted. We all
looked up; and, at the further side of the table, we beheld both the
ghosts. More alike now than ever before, it seemed to me; only with
that single difference of color of the coats. The same bright
engaging faces, the same gentle manner; as now, all heart burnings
seemingly healed, they stood with their arms bound lovingly about
each other in fraternal embrace.</p>

<p>"We have heard it all," continued the crimson ghost, "and thereby
we find an explanation of some things that we never thought of
before. Both Brother Arthur and myself now know that we are dead; and
that it is fitting, therefore, that we should no longer haunt these
scenes, to which indeed, we have no claim. I know that I have been
hanged; a matter, however, which occasions me no concern, seeing that
I deserved it not. I should at any rate have been dead long before
this; and since my family can be satisfied of my innocence and I know
that my Brother Arthur, in spite of a few harsh words, loves me still
the same, I care not for others' opinions."</p>

<p>"And I," said the purple ghost, "cannot sufficiently thank you for
the relief you have given me. Nightly have I lain in what I now
perceive was my grave, unable to sleep by reason of the strange lump
in my chest. This morning about eight, there came sudden relief; such
sweet relief, indeed, that I overslept myself, and for the first time
in many years have missed the chimes, and neglected at the appointed
hour to make my usual Christmas visit. Even this bodily relief,
perhaps, is not equal to what I feel at knowing that in reality I
have suffered no wrong at the hands of Brother Harold. I think that
if now we could only agree about the only subject which has ever
estranged us--by which I refer to our mutual attachment to Cousin
Beatrice we might--"</p>

<p>"I think I can easily make your mind easy about that matter,"
remarked Uncle Ruthven, coming forward. "If you will bear with me a
minute, I will show you the lifelike picture of your Cousin Beatrice
in after days."</p>

<p>He lifted one of the branch candlesticks from the table, and
directed its light upon a painting on the wall. The portrait of
Cousin Beatrice in more advanced life. A cracked, blackened and
moth-eaten picture; but in which, by singular chance, the face had
remained intact. The face of a woman who had long survived the
natural freshness and graces of youth, and had gained in place of
them none of those more matured and ennobling qualities that dignify
age. The patched and painted and powdered face of a woman given up to
all lightness and frivolity; a face in which there was nothing sweet
or pleasant or kindly; in which all the art of Sir Godfrey Kneller
had not succeeded in mingling with accurate likeness one spark of
generous nature or blotting out the appearance of sordid vanity that
pervaded it throughout all.</p>

<p>"The portrait of your Cousin Beatrice in her fiftieth year,"
remarked my Uncle Ruthven. "She never married, and was noted at Court
for her skill in cheating at cards."</p>

<p>The two young ghosts gazed for a moment intently at the picture.
As they did so, it seemed as though their embrace grew more intimate
and fraternal. At last they turned again, as satisfied.</p>

<p>"I do not think that we shall ever quarrel again about Cousin
Beatrice, even if at times we forget that we are all dead," the older
ghost then said, with a sweet smile. "And now that all differences
are so pleasantly made up, it remains for us only to bid you
farewell. And since Brother Harold can now rest in his grave
untroubled by any idea of wrong from me, and I can sleep, no longer
annoyed by the lump that pained my chest, it is probable that we
shall never be aroused to visits you again."</p>

<p>"But stay a moment," cried Uncle Ruthven, fairly touched at heart,
and no longer remembering the Encyclopaedia. "You will not go so
soon? At least you will take dinner with us?".As he spoke the ghosts
had already begun to vanish, the line of invisibility starting at the
feet, as before, and working upward until they were half gone. Then,
for a moment, the line trembled irresolutely, and so began to descend
until again they stood entirely revealed. It was as though a person
going out at a door had indeterminately held the handle for an
instant and then returned.</p>

<p>"Moreover," continued my uncle, "I have apologies to make for many
a past act of rudeness toward one of you."</p>

<p>"It is forgotten already," said the crimson ghost, bowing.</p>

<p>"What do you say Brother Arthur, can we wait a little longer?"</p>

<p>"A very few minutes, Brother Harold, if only to give myself time
to make amends for an act of impoliteness on my part toward this
other gentleman only last year."</p>

<p>So they seated themselves at the table and the dinner began. It
was pleasant to watch the old-fashioned politeness with which they
conducted themselves--the courtesy with which they bowed to Lilian at
each word they addressed to her--the grace with which, wishing to
cause no remark, they affected to eat and drink. Not able to do so,
indeed, by reason of their incorporeal nature, but all the time
lifting the full glasses and laden forks to their mouths and dropping
them again untouched. It was delightful to listen to their
conversation, marked here and there indeed, after the fashion of
their time, with a light oath, but bright and sparkling throughout
all, with vivacity and wit. At first, indeed; the time was somewhat
occupied by Uncle Ruthven giving sketches of the late history of the
family; but after that the ghosts were encouraged to talk, and
pleasantly beguiled half an hour with hitherto unknown anecdotes of
the Court of the Merry Monarch. As I listened my thoughts naturally
strayed from the present back to the romantic past, and my
imagination carried me, unresisting, into the olden days of the
Stuarts. I was no longer in the prosaic nineteenth century, I was in
the midst of a laughing, careless throng of king and courtiers, all
busily making up for their enforced deprivations during the somber
period of the Commonwealth. Hamilton and Nelly Gwynn, De Grammont and
Villiers and Frances Stewart, these and others of those long dead
disreputables, whose actions may not have been comely but whose names
live vividly in story, and to whose memories some glamor of romance
still kindly attaches us, now crowded around and made the past a
reality and the present a mere unstable myth. In the hallucination of
the moment even the portrait of the poor old card-cheating Beatrice
Grantley seemed to invest itself with something of her long-departed
youthfulness; and as the mingled gleam of wax-lights and yule log
flickered upon it, it was as though some hitherto unnoted beauties of
expression came to the surface, and the whole countenance became once
more aglow with that youthful loveliness which, doubtless, in the
time of it, and during her occasional visits to the Court, must have
enticed Charles himself awhile from his more stable attachments in
order to enjoy passing flirtation with her.</p>

<p>"A joyous Court, indeed; and sadly now coming to my memory as I
feel that I can never mingle with it more," said the purple ghost. "A
Court to which I know that my fair young kinswoman would have done
ample honor, could she have been there," he added, bowing to Lilian;
"even more abundantly, indeed, than Cousin Beatrice. Growing old with
more grace and dignity than did Beatrice, I am very sure. And that
she may live to grow old in such gentle manner, let her take heed and
not make my sad mistake."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed significantly to the Lancaster diamond
which chanced at that moment to be beside her plate, and, by a
singular coincidence, among a little pile of filberts.</p>

<p>"Yet I am sure," he added, still with the courtly manner of his
period, "that such sweet lips could never make mistake about
anything. Rather should the diamond, with its appropriate mate, be
reserved to grace those beauteous ears." "Its mate, do you say?" I
remarked; not sure, for the moment, but that the young ghost had
swallowed two diamonds, and that I had not carried my researches far
enough.</p>

<p>"Yes, its mate," he said. "Surely you must know? Not so, indeed?
Well, there were two of these great diamonds, the Lancaster and the
York. They had come into possession of one family through union of
adherents of those two rival parties, and thence into our own line,
through subsequent alliance of that family with the Grantleys. In
Cromwell's time, the diamonds were hidden in separate places to
preserve them from confiscation, the knowledge of those places being
handed down only by word of mouth, for greater security. At the
Restoration, I alone knew the secret. At the time of my death I had
already brought the Lancaster diamond to light, as you are well
aware. The York still remains hidden. Permit us now, my brother and
myself, to offer it to you as our joint Christmas present. You will
find it in a little metal box close beside--"</p>

<p>At that very moment it chanced that a small bantam rooster outside
the window set up a crow.</p>

<p>It was a miserable little banty, scarcely half fledged. It had a
drooping wing, and a twisted toe; and for these defects and others,
perhaps, which we had not noticed, was constantly driven away from
the general society of the poultry-yard. Even the hens were
accustomed to pick at it. Its crow was weak, and piping, like a
school-boy's first attempt at whistling. Nor was this the hour of
midnight or early dawn, but merely seven in the evening. There seemed
no reason why any ghost with self-respect should be moved by such a
feeble crow from such a despicable source, and at such an early hour.
And yet there may be a certain, inflexible rule for well-constituted
ghosts; and perhaps, in cock-crowing, the line cannot easily be drawn
between different styles.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, at the very first pretense of sound from the
little banty, the ghost stopped speaking, gazed inquiringly at his
brother and received an answering nod; and then without another word
they slowly faded away.</p>

<p>"Ghosts are so ridiculous!" said Lilian. But I thought that as she
gazed at the Lancaster diamond and reflected how well the two
Christmas gifts would have looked if worn together, she seemed sadly
disappointed that the little banty had not put off his crowing for a
minute longer.</p>
