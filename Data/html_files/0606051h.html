<h1>The Water Spectre</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Francis Lathom</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>Muchardus, the usurping Thane of Dungivan, had murdered Roderic
the late owner of that title, whom he had treacherously invited to
an entertainment in a castle that he possessed on the banks of the
Clyde. As soon as the banquet was nearly concluded, Roderic arose,
courteously took leave of his entertainer and his guests, and
descended the stairs. But he was not allowed to quit Boswell
Castle. His faithful followers had been previously dispatched, and
buried in one of the vaults beneath the edifice. To one of these,
which was formed into a kind of dungeon, the hapless Roderic was
forcibly dragged, and fastened to the stone wall by an iron
chain.</p>

<p>Three days and nights did the unfortunate Roderic remain in this
wretched lodging; his bed the cold ground, with oaten cake and
water for food; and this vile treatment he received from one on
whom he had heaped innumerable favours, and honoured with his
confidence.</p>

<p>On the fourth night of Roderic's dreadful confinement, Muchardus
entered his dungeon; in one hand he carried a written paper, in the
other a dagger; the man who had always brought Roderic's food,
carried a torch before the recreant lord. Roderic surveyed his foe
with silent indignation.</p>

<p>After a pause of a few minutes, Muchardus presented to the Thane
the paper which he had brought, and desired him to peruse it with
attention. He did so, and found it to be drawn up as a will, by
which he bequeathed to his treacherous friend all his vast
possessions, and the Thaneship of Dungivan.</p>

<p>'For what vile purpose have you brought me this infamous
scroll?' demanded the Thane.</p>

<p>'By signing that paper,' replied Muchardus, 'you will preserve
your existence. Liberty, 'tis true, I cannot grant you, consistent
with my own designs and safety; yet you shall be secreted in the
best apartment my castle affords; and every wish you can form, that
will not tend to a discovery of your still being an inhabitant of
this world, shall be attended to with the most scrupulous
exactness.'</p>

<p>The Thane's eyes darted fire at this disclosure of the
premeditated villainy of Muchardus, and he tore the paper to
atoms.</p>

<p>The enraged Muchardus flew towards his victim, and repeatedly
plunged his dagger in his breast, till, with a heavy groan, he
fell, and expired at the feet of his murderer.</p>

<p>Muchardus then left the dungeon, and returned to his own
apartment, where he employed one of his emissaries, whom he had
sworn to secrecy, to draw up another paper of the same purport as
that which the Thane had destroyed. Muchardus had several papers in
his possession, which had been written by Roderic, and to most of
them his signature was affixed. This they copied with great
exactness, and then prepared to reap the fruits of their wicked
design.</p>

<p>The corpse of the murdered Thane was taken ere the dawn of day,
and flung into a briery dell, where it was left, having been
previously stript of every article of value.</p>

<p>The absence of the Thane and his attendants from the Castle of
Dungivan, had caused a very serious alarm to his vassals and
adherents, who had made many successless researches in the
mountains, and inquired at every habitation, if they could give any
tidings of their lord; but no one had seen the Thane since the day
he went to Boswell Castle.</p>

<p>Some days after the murder had been committed, the body of the
Thane was found in the dell, by some huntsmen, who were led to the
spot by the sagacity of their hounds. The marks of violence on his
person, and his being despoiled of the property about it, which was
known to have been of great value on that fatal day, as he had
arrayed himself most sumptuously, and put on a variety of ornaments
to honour the banquet of Muchardus, led the persons interested in
the discovery, to conjecture that his attendants had murdered him,
and made off with the booty. And as their bodies could no where be
found, the report strengthened every day. Nor was Muchardus in the
least suspected of the murder.</p>

<p>That chief having proceeded so far with a success equal to his
most sanguine wishes, hastened to put the finishing blow to his
manoeuvres. He carried the forged will to be placed in a drawer in
one of the chambers where he was sure it would not be overlooked.
It was accordingly found by persons empowered to search for the
papers of the deceased. Muchardus was accordingly declared sole
heir of the late Thane of Dungivan: not much to the surprise of any
person, as the great intimacy between him and Roderic had been so
apparent; yet they greatly regretted the change, as the tyrannical
disposition of Muchardus was too well known, and often experienced
by those whom fortune had placed under him.</p>

<p>Muchardus (now Thane of Dungivan) had attained the height of his
ambition; yet his pillow was strewed with mental thorns. Ah! how
unlike the prosperity of the good man! Conscience, from whose
reproaches we cannot flee, perpetually reminded him of his crimes,
and made him shudder with apprehension, lest retributive vengeance
should overtake his guilty head.</p>

<p>The late Thane married, in early youth, a most beauteous lady,
the heiress of a neighbouring chieftain. With her he fondly hoped
for many years of happiness: but his hopes were vain; the peerless
Matilda expired in giving birth to her first born, the lovely
Donald; the traitor Muchardus being one of the sponsors that
answered for his faith at the font.</p>

<p>Two years passed on, and the widowed Thane still indulged his
grief, undiminished by the lapse of time. Muchardus artfully
endeavoured to learn the sentiments of his friend, as far as
regarded his re-engaging in matrimonial ties. To his great, though
concealed satisfaction, he heard from Dungivan, that he had
solemnly vowed never to take a second bride, but to cherish a
tender remembrance of his Matilda, and pray for a reunion with her
in those realms of bliss where the pangs of separation should be
unknown.</p>

<p>Muchardus had for some time past viewed the possessions of
Dungivan with a coveting eye; and he thought it feasible to obtain
the Thaneship by the murder of the father and son, as they had no
near relatives to make a claim. After much deliberation, he
concluded that it would be most prudent to remove the child first
from this world; as, in case of the death of the Thane preceding
that of Donald, the latter might be placed out of his reach.</p>

<p>Annie, the young woman who nursed the little Lord, was walking
on the banks of the Clyde, when she was seized by four men masked
and armed, who tore Donald from her arms. Two of them ran off with
the child; and the other two bound Annie to a tree, and then
followed their companions. The length of time that his son was
absent alarmed the Thane, and he sent some of the domestics to
search for Annie and her charge, and require their immediate
return.</p>

<p>They soon discovered the nurse, and heard her dismal story. They
led her back to the castle in an agony of grief, and acquainted the
Thane with the tidings. He tore his hair, and rent his garments;
nor would he listen to the consolations that Muchardus seemed so
eager to administer.</p>

<p>Various conjectures were formed who could be the perpetrator of
such a deed; but no one, upon mature reflection, appeared
feasible.</p>

<p>The Thane had not, to his knowledge, an enemy existing; for his
demeanour had been goodwill to all; nor did he conceive how any
person, as he had no immediate heir, could be benefitted by the
death or removal of his son. Alas! he clasped to his bosom as a
chosen friend, his deadly foe, the cause of all his sorrow: for it
was Muchardus that had employed ruffians to seize young Donald.</p>

<p>Allan, the man who was trusted with the management of this vile
plot, was ordered by his employer, to take the child and
precipitate him into the Clyde as soon as he had got rid of the men
who were joined with him in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Allan took the young Lord to his cottage, where he intended to
secrete him till the surrounding objects were enveloped in the
gloom of night, and then execute the horrid design which he had
pledged his faith to commit. When he entered his humble habitation,
he found Jannette, his wife, bitterly lamenting over the corpse of
her son, their only child. When Allan departed in the morning, he
had left the young Ambrose playing before the door of the cottage,
with the rose of health glowing on his cheeks. A few hours after,
death had seized his victim; and on the father's return, he found
himself bereft of his only hope. Nor did he fail to attribute this
calamity as the vengeance of an offended God. He felt what it was
to lose a child: and he pitied the sufferings that the Thane must
endure. 'They are more than my own,' ejaculated the now penitent
Allan, 'I know the end of mine; but the poor Lord is uncertain what
is the fate of his at this moment.'</p>

<p>'But tomorrow,' continued Allan, after a pause, in which he
recollected the injunctions of his employer, 'tomorrow thy corpse
will, perhaps, he discovered floating in the Clyde, and his
apprehensions will be confirmed by a horrid reality.'</p>

<p>'You will not, surely, murder this sweet babe,' exclaimed
Jannette in agony, and clasped the young Donald to her breast.</p>

<p>'I must,' said Allan; 'I have sworn. Behold the price of my
villainy;' emptying the contents of a well-filled purse on the
table; 'and I am to have as much more when Lord Muchardus is
convinced that the deed is executed.'</p>

<p>'I will not part with him,' said Jannette, 'he shall supply the
place of my child. You have been very wicked, Allan; but you are
not yet a murderer. The children are nearly of a size; nor are
their features much different; only the heir of Dungivan is so
beautifully fair, and our Ambrose is nearly olive; yet that will
not be when the poor babe has lain in the water.'</p>

<p>'What mean you?' said Allan, who instantly comprehended and
applauded the plan which she had in part expressed.</p>

<p>Jannette gave the young Donald some food; and exchanging his
apparel for some belonging to her own deceased baby, she lulled him
asleep; and placing him in the cradle of his predecessor, she began
to prepare her design.</p>

<p>She dressed her lifeless infant in the costly robes which had
been worn by the heir of Dungivan, placing also the ornaments of
that nobleman about the little corpse; only reserving a gold chain
with a small miniature of the Thane attached to it, and which
hanging loosely round the neck, might well be supposed to have
dropt off in the water. As soon as it was dark, Allan went and
flung the child into the river Clyde, accompanying the act with
many heartfelt tears and sorrowful lamentations.</p>

<p>Jannette, most fortunately for their plan, had not mentioned to
any of the neighbouring cottagers the death of her Ambrose. Under
the pretence of the child's being afflicted with a contagious
disease, she contrived to keep him in the upper chamber of her
cottage, from which she so completely excluded the light, that, if
anyone entered by chance, it was impossible to discover the deceit
that had been practised.</p>

<p>The body of the infant was not discovered till the third day,
when it was brought on shore by some young men who had been out in
a boat fishing. It was soon recognized by the dress to be the young
Lord Donald, (for the features were not now discernible), and was
conveyed to the Castle of Dungivan. The Thane was overwhelmed with
despair; he ordered a sumptuous funeral, and then immured himself
in a solitary apartment of the north tower.</p>

<p>Allan waited on Muchardus to claim his promised reward, which he
gave him, with much praise for his adroitness in performing his
commands. Allan then repaired to Jannette, and gathering together
what they wished to convey with them, left the cottage at the dead
of night, and procured a conveyance to Perth, from whence they
meant to travel to some remote part of Scotland, where they might
dwell in safety, for they were not without fear of Muchardus, as
they supposed that he would devise schemes to annihilate all those
who were acquainted with his atrocities. Nor were their conjectures
ill-founded; Muchardus rested not till he had removed those whose
aid he had purchased with his gold; and he felt great
disappointment on discovering that Allan had escaped with safety.
To murder the Thane was the next purpose of Muchardus; but while he
was deliberating on the best means to facilitate his design with
safety to his own person, Dungivan was suddenly ordered to attend
his monarch to England, where he was going to ratify some agreement
he had entered into with the monarch of that kingdom; and the
schemes of his treacherous friend were at that time defeated.</p>

<p>After passing some time in England, the Thane of Dungivan joined
the Crusaders, and repaired to the Holy Land, where he performed
wonders with his single arm against infidels. He passed sixteen
years in foreign countries ere he revisited his native place, which
he did with a determination to domesticate there in peace for the
remainder of his days.</p>

<p>He was yet in the prime of his age; and his valour had made him
an object of esteem and admiration. All the neighbouring nobility
gave splendid entertainments in honour of his return.--Among the
rest, Muchardus, with whom he had instantly renewed the friendship
of their youth, was not slow in preparing the banquet, and planning
the death of his unsuspecting guest.</p>

<p>The manner in which Muchardus obtained his ill-acquired grandeur
has already been described; but he was not happy. To divert his
thoughts from dwelling on the past events of his life, which were
not of a nature to bear retrospection, he resolved to marry. There
was an heiress of great property, who had been consigned to his
guardianship by her deceased father. The beauty of Lady Catharine
fascinated his senses, while her accumulating wealth held out a
lure to his avarice, and fondness for ostentatious parade.
Muchardus was still handsome; few men were more indebted to nature
for the gifts she had so lavishly bestowed on him. His countenance
was formed to command: but the tyrannical passions and habits he
had for many years imbibed, sometimes spread over his features a
fierceness almost terrific. Lady Catharine beheld him with a fixed
aversion. Two years she had resided at Dungivan, and had witnessed
enough of his disposition to make her shrink with terror, and daily
deplore the infatuation by which her parent was blinded, when he
chose the Thane daring her minority.</p>

<p>At this period, Caledonia was much governed by the influence of
the Weird Sisters. From the birth of young Donald, they had
resolved to protect him, and work his weal, and the woe of his
father's murderer.</p>

<p>Allan had long since lost his Jannette. He beheld Donald with
the most fervent affection. The noble and heroic mind of the youth
often called forth his wonder and admiration. A native dignity,
that adorned his soul, was not subdued by present poverty, or the
small expectations he had of acquiring any worldly wealth. Allan
could not subdue the regret that constantly arose when Donald met
his view; he wished to see him fill the place in society which was
his right; but his fears, and the improbability of his tale being
believed, made him bury the secret in his bosom.</p>

<p>He had been very successful in the tilling of a small farm,
which he had purchased with part of the money which Muchardus had
given him as a reward for the supposed murder of the child. All the
savings which arose from this source were hoarded for Donald; for
he had always retained that appellation from the time of his
protectors leaving the precincts of Dungivan. The youth was now in
his twentieth year, and the above-mentioned savings Allan was
debating with himself how he could best lay out for the benefit of
Donald, when he received an intimation from one of the Weird
Sisters, that he was to return with his young charge to the banks
of the Clyde. Allan disposed of his farm, and obeyed the commands
he had received; and he was once more settled in a cottage among
the mountains of Dungivan; and heard with horror of the murder of
the late Thane, which, from the proofs he had already had of the
villainy of the present one, he was not slow in attributing to
him.</p>

<p>Time had silvered over the head of Allan, and so altered his
person, that no one recognized him as Allan, under the name he
thought it now expedient with his own safety to assume. According
to the instructions he had received from the Weird Sisters, he
repaired to all the neighbouring Thanes, and made an avowal of the
transaction in which he had been engaged with respect to the heir
of Dungivan, and the way he was preserved by Jannette's
interposition.</p>

<p>A particular mark, which Allan asserted to be on the back of
Donald's neck, was well known to several of the nobles, who had
heard it remarked while the heir was yet in his infancy; this, and
several other convincing circumstances, placed his identity beyond
a doubt: but none of them were willing to make an enemy of the
fierce Muchardus, whose power and undaunted exploits had
effectually awed the neighbouring chieftains from interfering in
his concerns. Nor could all the endeavours of the aged Allan raise
the hapless youth one friend to assert his rights, and the poor old
man soon expired under the pressure of the regret that he
experienced.</p>

<p>Donald was ignorant of these applications, and the purport of
them; for Allan had never disclosed to him the nobleness of his
birth. He knew his lofty spirit would not suffer him to sink into
silent obscurity while an usurper enjoyed his domains. And what
could his single arm effect against his deadliest foe, who would
inevitably hurl him to destruction?</p>

<p>Though none of the chieftains would engage in the cause of the
orphan, yet their converse on the subject was not carried on so
secretly, but that it reached the ears of Muchardus, and gave him
the most dire apprehensions; though he openly derided the report as
a most absurd imposture.</p>

<p>Anxious to know if he should possess his guilty honours
unmolested, and win the love of the beauteous Lady Catharine, he
resolved to seek the Weird Sisters. For this purpose he left
Dungivan Castle, attended by Sandy, the only domestic he took with
him, and repaired to a forest near the cave of Fingal, where the
mysterious Sisters were said to resort, and perform their midnight
orgies.</p>

<p>When he approached the spot, he directed Sandy to wait his
return at the foot of a large tree, which he pointed out to his
notice. He then proceeded fearfully on. The soul of the Thane was
appalled; the wind rose to a tremendous height; the thunder rolled
over his head, and the blue lightning flashed in his
face--terror-struck, he resolved to give up his design of visiting
the Sisters; but he had lost the path which led back to the castle,
and he wandered he knew not whither. Now and then he beheld a faint
light, which he hoped proceeded from the cave of some anchorite,
where he could obtain shelter.</p>

<p>He soon came to a rock, in the hollow of which was a door partly
open, whence issued a pale gleam of light. The door flew back at
his touch, and he entered a misty cavern; the light increased to a
supernatural brightness, and in a few moments the Weird Sisters
appeared, and saluted him with a discordant voice.</p>

<p>'Hail! We know what brought thee here.</p>

<p>Wicked chieftain, shake with fear,</p>

<p>The assassin shuns his downy head</p>

<p>Can he shun the restless dead?</p>

<p>No, while in the forest drear,</p>

<p>Roderic, rise, and meet him here!</p>

<p>And the wounds he gave display.</p>

<p>Remorse be his by night and day.'</p>

<p>The mysterious Sisters then severally requested what he sought
to know. 'Ask!'--'Require!'--'Demand!'--exclaimed the Weird
Beings.</p>

<p>Muchardus inquired if he should perish by an avenging sword.</p>

<p>The first Sister replied, 'that no human power should harm
Muchardus.'</p>

<p>He then demanded who was next to enjoy the domains of
Dungivan.</p>

<p>The second Sister answered, 'that the lawful heir of the
murdered Roderic, and his bride, Lady Catharine, the peerless rose
of the Clyde, would succeed him.'</p>

<p>Muchardus's heart appeared to die within him at these words; and
it was not till the third Sister again repeated the question, of
what he sought to know, that he recovered sufficiently to ask how
many years of his existence still remained.</p>

<p>The bearded sister would not give an explicit answer to this
important question; but remarked to him, that he had once seen the
apparition of the murdered Roderic.</p>

<p>Muchardus, while his frame trembled with horror at the
recollection of the appalling scene he had witnessed in one of the
galleries of the castle, faintly replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>'Mark me then,' said the witch; 'you will not survive the third
appearance of the dreadful spectre.'</p>

<p>The sisters then vanished from his view and Muchardus,
affrighted at the gloom (for the witches had left him in total
darkness), was going to quit the cave with precipitation, when the
murdered Roderic stood before him, and intercepted his
progress.</p>

<p>Muchardus gazed on the hairy form with the greatest agony, till
a chilling sweat bedewed his forehead; his limbs failed him, and he
fell senseless on the floor of the cave.</p>

<p>In this situation he was found by Sandy, who alarmed by the
Thane's long absence, ventured from his leafy shelter, as soon as
the storm had abated, to seek him in which charitable design he
succeeded with some difficulty, and was much terrified with meeting
the Weird Sisters in his path, who maliciously diverted themselves
with exciting his fears, and then suffered him to proceed.</p>

<p>He found his master just recovering from a death-like swoon. He
assisted him to rise; and Muchardus, having glanced his eye around,
and, to his great relief, perceiving no spectre, exerted himself to
leave the horrid cave; and was led by Sandy to the Castle, where he
retired to his splendid couch the most miserable of human
beings.</p>

<p>Donald, since the death of Allan, his supposed parent, had
remained in his cottage, as he had not yet met with the opportunity
he coveted of embracing a military life.</p>

<p>In his solitary walks about the mountains, he frequently met
Lady Catharine, and her attendant, Moggy Cameron. A fervent passion
for the noble fair one took possession of his bosom; and he
reasoned with himself in vain against its increasing influence; for
Love, that leveller of rank, was constantly inspiring him with
hope.</p>

<p>Lady Catharine was not insensible to the attentions of Donald;
and she often breathed forth a secret prayer that he had been of
equal birth with herself.</p>

<p>Near five weeks had elapsed since their first casual meeting,
when one morning the Lady Catharine being with some of her
attendants on the Clyde, in a small sailing-boat, a sudden gust of
wind upset it; and the fair lady was precipitated into the water,
Donald, who had been walking on the banks for some time, and
surveying the lovely Catharine with delight, as the vessel slowly
glided along, immediately saw her danger, and plunged into the
stream to snatch her from impending death. He happily succeeded in
bearing his lovely burthen safe to the shore, and led her till they
arrived at the castle gates, where he abruptly left her, ere she
could express her thanks for the service he had rendered so
opportunely.</p>

<p>From this auspicious day, gratitude, united to love, created for
Donald a strong interest in her heart: yet prudence bade her avoid
him; there was no prospect that the prejudices which her friends
would entertain against such a suitor, could be overcome, and she
resolved to spare him and herself, if possible from the pangs of a
hopeless passion.</p>

<p>Donald no longer met her in his walks; he felt the change in her
behaviour most severely, and became a votary of sorrow and despair,
courting the influence of these passions in the still hours of the
night, wandering among precipices and dreary forests. Chance led
him to the cave where Muchardus had obtained an audience with the
Weird Sisters, about an hour after that Thane had quitted it. The
Sisters again appeared. Instead of cringing to them with the abject
servility of Dungivan's usurping lord, he demanded with some
sternness, what they wanted with him. But his asperity was soon
transformed into profound respect, when they expressed their
solicitude for his weal, and claimed his attention to what they had
to impart.</p>

<p>The eldest of the Weird Sisters then gave a concise account of
the crimes of the present Thane, and informed Donald that he was at
that time plotting his destruction; being in dread of his revenge,
and his gaining the affections of Lady Catharine.</p>

<p>The Weird Sisters then joined in admonishing him as to his
future conduct; and one of them delivered to Donald a white silk
flag, on which were woven some mysterious characters. This, she
told him, would once, and once only, be of singular service to him
in extreme danger, and that being the case, she exhorted him not to
try its efficacy till all other resources had failed, and his own
exertions proved abortive.</p>

<p>Donald took a courteous leave of the bounteous Sisters; and
repaired to his cottage in a far different frame of mind from that
he had ever experienced before. His birth was noble worthy of Lady
Catharine; and he felt that it was possible for time and
perseverance to bestow on him a happiness which the preceding day
he had regarded as unattainable.</p>

<p>The next day he was informed by a person who had a sincere
regard for his safety that the Thane had discovered him to be the
lawful heir of the domain, and had privately suborned persons to
assassinate him, not assigning the true reason for that horrid
design, but charging him with the attempt to seduce Lady Catharine
from her duty, by persuading her to leave the castle of her
guardian, and share a beggar's fate.--That lady, the informant
added, was now strictly confined within the circle of her own
apartments, and forced to listen to the hateful addresses of the
Thane.</p>

<p>Donald, on receiving this intimation, thought it most prudent to
leave his present habitation, and repair to the court of King
Malcolm, and submit the case to him. In searching the papers of the
deceased Allan, he discovered a written attestation of the deceit
he had practised to save the infant's life, describing some
particular marks of fruit he had on his body, together with the
chain he wore round his neck, which was now fastened to the
paper.</p>

<p>These proofs were very consoling to Donald, and made him
commence his journey with more alacrity; and by the noon of the day
on which he set out, he had travelled many miles. The heat of the
midday sun greatly incommoded him, and he grew faint and weary.</p>

<p>A neat cottage presented itself to view, and he knocked at the
door to request admittance, that he might rest till the cool of the
evening. This the loquacious hostess denied him; and during his
expostulations with her on the subject, she unguardedly betrayed to
his knowledge, that her inhospitable refusal was owing to her
having sheltered Lady Catharine, who had escaped from the Castle to
her humble roof, she having been led hither by her attendant, Moggy
Cameron, who was daughter to the cottager.</p>

<p>Donald had betrayed so much emotion during the recital, that the
good dame, alarmed at the consequences that might ensue from her
communicating so much to a stranger, entered the dwelling, and
closed the door.</p>

<p>Donald, hurt at her manner, and disappointed at not obtaining an
interview with Lady Catharine, to whom he wished to impart the
intelligence he had received from the Weird Sisters, and worn out
by fatigue, fainted at the door of the cottage. The noise he made
in falling, brought its inmates to his relief; and Lady Catharine
instantly recognized her faithful Donald. He soon revived; and the
fair one had just listened with pleasing surprise to his narrative,
when a party of Muchardus's soldiers, who had been sent in pursuit
of the fugitives, arrived, and conveyed the lovers to the Castle,
where Donald was confined in a dungeon, and Sandy, having
interfered in the behalf of the young lord, was also made a
prisoner; and guards were set over them; but, by a successful
stratagem of Moggy, who intoxicated their keepers, and procured the
keys, they were liberated, and quitted the Castle walls.</p>

<p>By the direction of Moggy, they repaired to an isolated building
about two miles from Dungivan; and in less than an hour they were
joined by Lady Catharine and her attendants, they having escaped
from the spies which Muchardus had set round them, by means of a
subterraneous winding, which led from the stairs of the north tower
to a grotto that terminated one of the avenues of the Castle
grounds.</p>

<p>They proceeded in their flight for two days unmolested when,
alas! they were again taken in the toils, and the Thane in person
headed the pursuers.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at the Castle, Muchardus ordered some of
his followers to take young Donald to the cave of Fingal (a long
subterraneous passage cut through a rock, and filled with a branch
of the river), in a boat, and destroy him. In vain Catharine knelt,
and besought him to avert the sentence; he was inexorable; and the
fair one, frantic with despair, rushed out of the Castle ere the
Thane had time to intercept her progress. Sandy, who had
attentively watched her, followed, and by her directions procured a
boat, and repaired with her to the cave of Fingal. They arrived
there first; and securing the boat in one of the inlets, Lady
Catharine hid herself behind a projection of the rock, to watch the
actions of the Thane, who soon arrived in a boat only, attended by
the man who handled the oars. Contrary to the expectations of
Catharine, Muchardus suspected her being in the cave, and soon
discovered her hiding place, from which he dragged her into his
boat, just at the instant that the one in which Donald and his
intended assassins were sitting, entered the place pitched on for
the scene of his destruction.</p>

<p>Catharine, in her struggles to get from the Thane fell into the
water, and would have perished, but for the activity of Sandy, who
succeeded in replacing her in the boat which had conveyed her
hither, while Donald, who was a confined spectator of the accident,
was almost senseless with despair.</p>

<p>The Thane now offered to grant Donald his life, if he would
renounce his presumptuous claim and the hand of Lady Catharine; but
the youth rejected the proposal with the scorn it merited. A secret
impulse made Muchardus wish to save the youth's life, if he could
consistent with his own terms; and he vowed to release him, and
provide for his future weal, if Lady Catharine would instantly
become his bride, and resign all thought of Donald. She gave an
heroic refusal; and the enraged Thane ordered the assassins to
strangle their victim. Struggles were of no avail; the youth
remembered the injunctions of the Weird Sisters, and waved the flag
three times in the air. The Spectre of his Sire arose in the midst
of the water, and pronounced the doom of his vile murderer, who
sank with the boat and perished.</p>

<p>Donald was instantly conveyed with Lady Catharine back to the
Castle, where the most lively transports of joy took place among
the domestics at receiving the son of Roderic for their lord; for
they had groaned under the tyranny of Muchardus.</p>

<p>Donald found no difficulty in getting his title acknowledged by
his sovereign; and his union with the fair Catharine was productive
of the utmost felicity to themselves and their off-spring.</p>
