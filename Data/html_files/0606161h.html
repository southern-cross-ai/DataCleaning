<h2><a name="s1"></a>The Downs</h2>

<p>I am venturing to set down the following personal experience,
inconclusive as it is, as I feel that it may interest those who have
the patience to study the phenomena of the unseen world around us. It
was my first experience of a psychical happening and its events are
accordingly indelibly imprinted on my memory.</p>

<p>The date was, alas, a good many years ago, when I was still a young
man and at the time was engaged in reading hard for a certain
examination. My friend J. was in similar plight to myself and together
we decided to abjure home and London life and seek a quiet country
spot, where we might devote ourselves to our work amidst pleasant and
congenial surroundings.</p>

<p>J. knew of such a place: a farm belonging to a Mr. Harkness, who was
a distant connection of his own by marriage. Mr. Harkness was a
childless widower and lived much to himself at Branksome Farm, attended
to only by an elderly housekeeper and one or two servants. Although he
called himself a farmer and did in fact farm fairly extensively, he was
a man of cultivated and even learned tastes, widely read and deeply
versed in the history and folklore of his neighbourhood. At the same
time, although good-natured, he was the most reserved and tactiturn man
lever met, and appeared to have a positive horror of communicating his
very considerable fund of local knowledge to outsiders like ourselves.
However, he was glad to welcome us as paying guests for the sake of his
relationship to J., and he and his housekeeper certainly took great
care to make us comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>Branksome Farm is a large old-fashioned house, surrounded by the
usual farm buildings and situated in a valley winding its way among the
Downs. The situation is beautiful and remote, and it would astonish
many of our City dwellers to know that within two or three hours'
railway journey from London there still are vast stretches of open
Downland on which one may walk for hours without sight of a human
being, and traversed only by winding roads which run from one small
town or hamlet to another, linking a few lonely cottages or farms to
civilization on their route. Behind the house Branksome Down, the
highest in the neighbourhood, rises steeply, and beyond it at a
distance of---about three miles is Willingbury, the nearest town,
whence the railway runs to London.</p>

<p>It is necessary to describe the geography of the country between
Willingbury and Branksome a little more closely. The two places lie, as
is usually the case in the Down country, in valleys between the hills
and by road are distant from each other about six to seven miles, being
separated by the long ridge of Branksome Down. But actually the
distance between them does not exceed three miles across the Down: the
path from Branksome, a mere sheep-track, leading up to the top of
Branksome Down whence the wanderer sees before him a wide shallow dip
in the Down, nearly circular, about three-quarters of a mile across and
at the other side sloping up to another gentle ridge. Arrived at the
summit of this second elevation the traveller gazes down on the
Willingbury-Overbury road and following another sheep-track down the
hill-side he reaches the road about a mile outside Willingbury.</p>

<p>The whole Down is covered with sweet, short turf, unbroken by trees
or shrubs and, at the time of my story, was unmarred by fencing of any
form. Flocks of sheep tended by shepherds and their watchful dogs were
almost its sole inhabitants, save for the shy, wild life that clings to
all natural shelters. Of the beauty of this Down and, in fact, of the
whole neighbourhood it is useless to speak. To anyone who has once felt
the fascination of a walk in the fresh, pure air, over the springy and
centuries-old turf, and who has allowed his eyes to wander over the
miles and miles of open Down, studded here and there with rare belts of
trees, and has watched the shifting lights play over the near and
distant hills, it is needless to speak, and to anyone who has never yet
been fortunate enough to find himself in Downland in fine weather one
can hardly make its fascination clear in words, and one can only advise
him to go and explore its beauties for himself.</p>

<p>Well, it was at Branksome Farm that J. and I took up our abode and
commenced a course of steady reading, tempered and varied by long walks
about the country. Our time passed pleasantly and profitably, and we
discovered one day with regret that more than half of it had
elapsed.</p>

<p>Dismayed at this discovery we began to set our wits to work to find
an excuse for prolonging our stay at Branksome, when suddenly an event
happened which entirely altered our plans.</p>

<p>Returning one day from our accustomed walk, J. found a telegram
waiting for him, which called him to London without delay and the
contents of which appeared to indicate the probability of his being
unable to return to Branksome. No time was to be lost in making a start
if he was to catch the afternoon train at Willingbury and, as it was
really quicker to walk across the Down than to drive round the roads
behind Mr. Harkness' rather slow old mare, he threw a few clothes
hastily into a bag and departed for the station. I accompanied him to
see him off and we made the best possible speed to Willingbury. But we
had miscalculated the time; the afternoon train had gone, and we found
on inquiry that there would be no other until the night mail for
London, which passed through Willingbury shortly before 11 p m.</p>

<p>J. urged me not to wait for this but to leave him at the little inn
and go back to Branksome before dark, but I was anxious to keep him
company and cheer up his rather depressed spirits, so finally we agreed
to dine together at the Blue Lion and spend the evening there until the
train left.</p>

<p>I was perfectly confident in my ability to find my way back over the
Down to Branksome at night, as the path was very familiar to us, and I
expected to be aided by the light of the moon which would rise about
ten o'clock. In due course the train arrived, and having seen J. safely
on his way to London I turned my steps towards the WillingburyOverbury
road and its junction with the Branksome sheeptrack.</p>

<p>It was a little after 11 p. m. when I left Willingbury on my
homeward way, and I was disappointed to find that the moon had failed
me, being completely hidden behind a thick canopy of cloud. The night
was profoundly still as well as being very dark, but I was confident in
my powers of finding my way and I strode contentedly along the road
till I reached the point where it was necessary I should diverge on to
the Down. I found the commencement of the sheep-track without
difficulty, as my eyes were now accustomed to the surrounding
obscurity, and set myself to climbing the Down as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>I must make it clear that up to the present time I had been in my
usual state of health and spirits, although the latter were somewhat
depressed at J.'s sudden departure and the break up of our pleasant
association together. Up to this night, also, I had never in the least
suspected that I was possessed of any special psychic intelligence. It
is true that I had known that I was in the habit of occasionally
dreaming very vividly and consecutively, but I had never given this
faculty a serious thought, nor, like most young men in their twenties,
had I ever given any consideration to psychic matters. It must be
remembered also that I am writing of nearly forty years ago, when an
intelligent interest in the potentialities of unseen beings and kindred
topics was far less common than it is to-day.</p>

<p>Well, I commenced my ascent of the hill, and I had not gone very far
when I became aware of a certain peculiar change taking place in
myself. I fear I shall find it very difficult to describe my sensations
in a fashion intelligible to those who have never experienced anything
similar, whilst to those who have undergone psychic ordeals my
description will probably appear bald and inadequate.</p>

<p>I seemed to be in some mysterious fashion divided into a dual
personality. One, the familiar one, was myself, my body, which
continued to walk up the sheep-track, keenly alive to the need to keep
a sharp look out against losing my way or stumbling over some
obstruction. This personality also felt loneliness and a certain degree
of nervousness. The darkness, silence and immensity of the empty
country round me were oppressive. I feared something, I was not quite
sure what, and I anxiously wished I was at the end of my journey with
the farm lights shining out to welcome me. My other personality was
more vague and ill-defined; it seemed to be separated from my body and
from my outer consciousness and to be floating in a region where there
was neither space nor time. It seemed to be aware of another world, a
world surrounding and intermingling with this one, in which all that is
or was or will be was but one moment and in which all places near or
far, the Down and the remotest of the invisible stars, were but one
spot.</p>

<p>All was instantaneous and all was eternal. I am not clear how long
this mood lasted, but it was probably only a few minutes before my
earthly self was brought or appeared to be brought into entire control
of my personality by a sudden shock.</p>

<p>As I walked I became aware that I was not alone. There was a man
moving parallel with me on my right at the distance of some four or
five yards. So suddenly and so silently had he appeared that he seemed
to have risen from the earth. He was walking quite quietly at my own
pace abreast of me, but apparently taking no notice of me, and I
observed that his footsteps made no sound on the soft turf. The dim
light made it difficult to see him at all distinctly, but he was
evidently a tall, powerfully built fellow, dressed in a long cloak,
which, partly covering his face, fell nearly to his feet. On his head
he wore a queer-shaped, three-cornered hat and in his hand he carried
what appeared to be a short, heavy bludgeon.</p>

<p>I was greatly startled. I am a small and by no means robust man and
the apparition of this odd-looking stranger on these lonely Downs was
disquieting. What did he want? Had he followed me down the road from
Willingbury, and, if so, for what purpose? However, I decided it was
best not to appear alarmed and after taking another glance at the man,
I wished him good evening.</p>

<p>He took not the faintest notice of my salutation, which he appeared
not even to have heard, but continued to advance up the hill by my side
in dead silence.</p>

<p>After a few moments I spoke again; and this time my voice sounded
strange in my own ears, as if it did not come from my lips, but from
somewhere far away.</p>

<p>"A dark night," I said.</p>

<p>And now he answered. In a slow, measured voice, but one in which
there sounded a note of hopelessness and misery, he said:</p>

<p>"It is dark to you. It is darker for me."</p>

<p>I scarcely knew what to reply, but I felt that my courage was at an
ebb and that I must maintain it by endeavouring to keep up a
conversation, difficult though this might prove. Accordingly I went
on:</p>

<p>"This is a strange place to walk in at night. Have you far to
go?"</p>

<p>He did not turn his head or look at me.</p>

<p>"Your way is short and easy, but mine is long and hard. How long, O
Lord, how long?" he cried. As he uttered the last words his voice rose
to a cry and he tossed his arms above his head, letting them fall to
his side with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>We had now almost reached the top of the Down, and as we neared the
summit I became aware that the wind was rising. At the moment we were
sheltered from it by the brow of the hill, but I could hear its distant
roaring, and as we reached the summit it broke upon us with a rush.</p>

<p>With it and mingled in its sounds came other sounds, the sounds of
human voices, of many voices, in many keys. There were sounds of
wailing, of shouting, of chanting, of sobbing, even at times of
laughter. The great, shallow bowl of Branksome Down was alive with
sounds. I could see nothing, save my strange companion, who continued
to move steadily forward; and I, dreading his company and yet dreading
even more to be left alone, accompanied him. The night was still
profoundly dark and, though as I advanced the voices often sounded
quite near, I saw nothing until after we had passed the centre of the
depression and were mounting the opposite slope. At that moment the
wind tore aside the clouds and the moon streamed down full upon the
Downs. By her light I saw a marvellous and a terrifying sight. The
whole of Branksome Down was alive with people hurrying hither and
thither, some busy and absorbed in their occupations, whatever they
might be, others roaming aimlessly and tossing their arms into the air
with wild and tragic gesticulations. The crowd appeared to be of all
sorts and conditions and to be dressed in the fashions of all the ages,
though ancient costumes seemed to predominate. Here I saw a group of
persons clothed apparently in the priestly robes of ancient Britain;
there walked a soldier wearing the eagle-crested helmet of Rome. Other
groups there were in dresses of later date, the steel-clad knight of
the Middle Ages, the picturesque dress and flowing hair of a cavalier
of the Seventeenth Century. But it was impossible to fix the shifting
crowd. As I gazed, absorbed, at one figure, it melted and was gone and
another took its place, to fade likewise as I watched.</p>

<p>My companion paid no heed to the throng. Steadily he passed on
towards the crest of the hill, at intervals raising his arms and
letting them fall with his old gesture of despair and uttering at the
same time his mournful cry of "How long, how long?"</p>

<p>We passed onward and upward and reached the top of the Down, my
companion now a few yards in front of me. As he reached the crest of
the hill, he stopped and, lifting his arms above his head, stood
motionless. Suddenly he wavered, his figure expanded, its lines became
vague and blurred against the background, it faded and was gone. As it
vanished the wind dropped suddenly, the sound of human voices ceased
and gazing round me I saw the plain bare and still in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>I was now at the top of the hill, and looking downwards I saw a
light burning in a window of Branksome Farm. I stumbled down the hill
in haste, and as I approached the house saw Mr.</p>

<p>Harkness standing at the open door. He looked at me strangely as I
entered.</p>

<p>"Have you come across Branksome Down to-night," he exclaimed,
"to-night of all the nights in the year?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"I should have warned you," he said, "but I expected you back before
dark. Branksome Down is an ill place to-night and men have vanished
upon it before now and never been heard of again. No shepherd will set
foot upon it to-night, for this is the night in the year when, folk
say, all those that ever died violent deaths upon the Downs come back
to seek their lost rest."</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>Brickett Bottom</h2>

<p>The Reverend Arthur Maydew was the hard-working incumbent of a large
parish in one of our manufacturing towns. He was also a student and a
man of no strong physique, so that when an opportunity was presented to
him to take an annual holiday by exchanging parsonages with an elderly
clergyman, Mr. Roberts, the Squarson of the Parish of Overbury, and an
acquaintance of his own, he was glad to avail himself of it.</p>

<p>Overbury is a small and very remote village in one of our most
lovely and rural counties, and Mr. Roberts had long held the living of
it.</p>

<p>Without further delay we can transport Mr. Maydew and his family,
which consisted only of two daughters, to their temporary home. The two
young ladies, Alice and Maggie, the heroines of this narrative, were at
that time aged twenty-six and twenty-four years respectively. Both of
them were attractive girls, fond of such society as they could find in
their own parish and, the former especially, always pleased to extend
the circle of their acquaintance. Although the elder in years, Alice in
many ways yielded place to her sister, who was the more energetic and
practical and upon whose shoulders the bulk of the family cares and
responsibilities rested. Alice was inclined to be absent-minded and
emotional and to devote more of her thoughts and time to speculations
of an abstract nature than her sister.</p>

<p>Both of the girls, however, rejoiced at the prospect of a period of
quiet and rest in a pleasant country neighbourhood, and both were
gratified at knowing that their father would find in Mr.</p>

<p>Roberts' library much that would entertain his mind, and in Mr.
Roberts' garden an opportunity to indulge freely in his favourite game
of croquet. They would have, no doubt, preferred some cheerful
neighbours, but Mr. Roberts was positive in his assurances that there
was no one in the neighbourhood whose acquaintance would be of interest
to them.</p>

<p>The first few weeks of their new life passed pleasantly for the
Maydew family. Mr. Maydew quickly gained renewed vigour in his quiet
and congenial surroundings, and in the delightful air, while his
daughters spent much of their time in long walks about the country and
in exploring its beauties.</p>

<p>One evening late in August the two girls were returning from a long
walk along one of their favourite paths, which led along the side of
the Downs. On their right, as they walked, the ground fell away sharply
to a narrow glen, named Brickett Bottom, about three-quarters of a mile
in length, along the bottom of which ran a little-used country road
leading to a farm, known as Blaise's Farm, and then onward and upward
to lose itself as a sheep track on the higher Downs.</p>

<p>On their side of the slope some scattered trees and bushes grew, but
beyond the lane and running up over the farther slope of the glen was a
thick wood, which extended away to Carew Court, the seat of a
neighbouring magnate, Lord Carew. On their left the open Down rose
above them and beyond its crest lay Overbury.</p>

<p>The girls were walking hastily, as they were later than they had
intended to be and were anxious to reach home. At a certain point at
which they had now arrived the path forked, the right hand branch
leading down into Brickett Bottom and the left hand turning up over the
Down to Overbury.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to turn into the left hand path Alice
suddenly stopped and pointing downwards exclaimed: "How very curious,
Maggie! Look, there is a house down there in the Bottom, which we have,
or at least I have, never noticed before, often as we have walked up
the Bottom."</p>

<p>Maggie followed with her eyes her sister's pointing finger.</p>

<p>"I don't see any house," she said.</p>

<p>"Why, Maggie," said her sister, "can't you see it! A quaint-looking,
old-fashioned red brick house, there just where the road bends to the
right. It seems to be standing in a nice, well-kept garden too."</p>

<p>Maggie looked again, but the light was beginning to fade in the glen
and she was short-sighted to boot.</p>

<p>"I certainly don't see anything," she said, "but then I am so blind
and the light is getting bad; yes, perhaps I do see a house," she
added, straining her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, it is there," replied her sister, "and to-morrow we will come
and explore it."</p>

<p>Maggie agreed readily enough, and the sisters went home, still
speculating on how they had happened not to notice the house before and
resolving firmly on an expedition thither the next day. However, the
expedition did not come off as planned, for that evening Maggie slipped
on the stairs and fell, spraining her ankle in such a fashion as to
preclude walking for some time.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the accident to her sister, Alice remained possessed
by the idea of making further investigations into the house she had
looked down upon from the hill the evening before; and the next day,
having seen Maggie carefully settled for the afternoon, she started off
for Brickett Bottom. She returned in triumph and much intrigued over
her discoveries, which she eagerly narrated to her sister.</p>

<p>Yes. There was a nice, old-fashioned red brick house, not very large
and set in a charming, old-world garden in the Bottom. It stood on a
tongue of land jutting out from the woods, just at the point where the
lane, after a fairly straight course from its junction with the main
road half a mile away, turned sharply to the right in the direction of
Blaise's Farm. More than that, Alice had seen the people of the house,
whom she described as an old gentleman and a lady, presumably his wife.
She had not clearly made out the gentleman, who was sitting in the
porch, but the old lady, who had been in the garden busy with her
flowers, had looked up and smiled pleasantly at her as she passed. She
was sure, she said, that they were nice people and that it would be
pleasant to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Maggie was not quite satisfied with Alice's story. She was of a more
prudent and retiring nature than her sister; she had an uneasy feeling
that, if the old couple had been desirable or attractive neighbours,
Mr. Roberts would have mentioned them, and knowing Alice's nature she
said what she could to discourage her vague idea of endeavouring to
make acquaintance with the owners of the red brick house.</p>

<p>On the following morning, when Alice came to her sister's room to
inquire how she did, Maggie noticed that she looked pale and rather
absent-minded, and, after a few commonplace remarks had passed, she
asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Alice? You don't look yourself this
morning."</p>

<p>Her sister gave a slightly embarrassed laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am all right," she replied, "only I did not sleep very well.
I kept on dreaming about the house. It was such an odd dream too the
house seemed to be home, and yet to be different."</p>

<p>"What, that house in Brickett Bottom?" said Maggie. "Why, what is
the matter with you, you seem to be quite crazy about the place?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is curious, isn't it, Maggie, that we should have only
just discovered it, and that it looks to be lived in by nice people? I
wish we could get to know them."</p>

<p>Maggie did not care to resume the argument of the night before and
the subject dropped, nor did Alice again refer to the house or its
inhabitants for some little time. In fact, for some days the weather
was wet and Alice was forced to abandon her walks, but when the weather
once more became fine she resumed them, and Maggie suspected that
Brickett Bottom formed one of her sister's favourite expeditions.
Maggie became anxious over her sister, who seemed to grow daily more
absent-minded and silent, but she refused to be drawn into any
confidential talk, and Maggie was nonplussed.</p>

<p>One day, however, Alice returned from her afternoon walk in an
unusually excited state of mind, of which Maggie sought an explanation.
It came with a rush. Alice said that, that afternoon, as she approached
the house in Brickett Bottom, the old lady, who as usual was busy in
her garden, had walked down to the gate as she passed and had wished
her good day.</p>

<p>Alice had replied and, pausing, a short conversation had followed.
Alice could not remember the exact tenor of it, but, after she had paid
a compliment to the old lady's flowers, the latter had rather
diffidently asked her to enter the garden for a closer view. Alice had
hesitated, and the old lady had said "Don't be afraid of me, my dear, I
like to see young ladies about me and my hus-band finds their society
quite necessary to him." After a pause she went on: "Of course nobody
has told you about us. My husband is Colonel Paxton, late of the Indian
Army, and we have been here for many, many years. It's rather lonely,
for so few people ever see us. Do come in and meet the Colonel."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't go in," said Maggie rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Why not?" replied Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like Mrs. Paxton asking you in that way," answered
Maggie.</p>

<p>"I don't see what harm there was in the invitation," said Alice.</p>

<p>"I didn't go in because it was getting late and I was anxious to get
home; but--"</p>

<p>"But what?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>Alice shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I have accepted Mrs. Paxton's invitation to pay
her a little visit to-morrow."</p>

<p>And she gazed defiantly at Maggie.</p>

<p>Maggie became distinctly uneasy on hearing of this resolution. She
did not like the idea of her impulsive sister visiting people on such
slight acquaintance, especially as they had never heard them mentioned
before. She endeavoured by all means, short of appealing to Mr. Maydew,
to dissuade her sister from going, at any rate until there had been
time to make some inquiries as to the Paxtons. Alice, however, was
obdurate.</p>

<p>What harm could happen to her? she asked. Mrs. Paxton was a charming
old lady. She was going early in the afternoon for a short visit. She
would be back for tea and croquet with her father and, anyway, now that
Maggie was laid up, long solitary walks were unendurable and she was
not going to let slip the chance of following up what promised to be a
pleasant acquaintance.</p>

<p>Maggie could do nothing more. Her ankle was better and she was able
to get down to the garden and sit in a long chair near her father, but
walking was still quite out of the question, and it was with some
misgivings that on the following day she watched Alice depart gaily for
her visit, promising to be back by half-past four at the very
latest.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed quietly till nearly five, when Mr. Maydew,
looking up from his book, noticed Maggie's uneasy expression and
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is Alice?"</p>

<p>"Out for a walk," replied Maggie; and then after a short pause she
went on: "And she has also gone to pay a call on some neighbours whom
she has recently discovered."</p>

<p>"Neighbours," ejaculated Mr. Maydew, "what neighbours? Mr. Roberts
never spoke of any neighbours to me."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know much about them," answered Maggie. "Only Alice
and I were out walking the day of my accident and saw or at least she
saw, for I am so blind I could not quite make it out, a house in
Brickett Bottom. The next day she went to look at it closer, and
yesterday she told me that she had made the acquaintance of the people
living in it. She says that they are a retired Indian officer and his
wife, a Colonel and Mrs. Paxton, and Alice describes Mrs. Paxton as a
charming old lady, who pressed her to come and see them. So she has
gone this afternoon, but she promised me she would be back long before
this."</p>

<p>Mr. Maydew was silent for a moment and then said:</p>

<p>"I am not well pleased about this. Alice should not be so impulsive
and scrape acquaintance with absolutely unknown people. Had there been
nice neighbours in Brickett Bottom, I am certain Mr. Roberts would have
told us."</p>

<p>The conversation dropped; but both father and daughter were
disturbed and uneasy and, tea having been finished and the clock
striking half-past five, Mr. Maydew asked Maggie:</p>

<p>"When did you say Alice would be back?"</p>

<p>"Before half-past four at the latest, father."</p>

<p>"Well, what can she be doing? What can have delayed her? You say you
did not see the house," he went on.</p>

<p>"No," said Maggie, "I cannot say I did. It was getting dark and you
know how short-sighted I am."</p>

<p>"But surely you must have seen it at some other time," said her
father.</p>

<p>"That is the strangest part of the whole affair," answered Maggie.
"We have often walked up the Bottom, but I never noticed the house, nor
had Alice till that evening. I wonder," she went on after a short
pause, "if it would not be well to ask Smith to harness the pony and
drive over to bring her back. I am not happy about her--I am
afraid--"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?" said her father in the irritated voice of a man
who is growing frightened.</p>

<p>"What can have gone wrong in this quiet place? Still, I'll send
Smith over for her."</p>

<p>So saying he rose from his chair and sought out Smith, the rather
dull-witted gardener-groom attached to Mr. Roberts' service.</p>

<p>"Smith," he said, "I want you to harness the pony at once and go
over to Colonel Paxton's in Brickett Bottom and bring Miss Maydew
home."</p>

<p>The man stared at him.</p>

<p>"Go where, sir?" he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Maydew repeated the order and the man, still staring stupidly,
answered:</p>

<p>"I never heard of Colonel Paxton, sir. I don't know what house you
mean."</p>

<p>Mr. Maydew was now growing really anxious.</p>

<p>"Well, harness the pony at once," he said; and going back to Maggie
he told her of what he called Smith's stupidity, and asked her if she
felt that her ankle would be strong enough to permit her to go with him
and Smith to the Bottom to point out the house.</p>

<p>Maggie agreed readily and in a few minutes the party started off.
Brickett Bottom, although not more than three-quarters of a mile away
over the Downs, was at least three miles by road; and as it was nearly
six o'clock before Mr. Maydew left time Vicarage, and the pony was old
and slow, it was getting late before the entrance to Brickett Bottom
was reached. Turning into the lane the cart proceeded slowly up the
Bottom, Mr. Maydew and Maggie looking anxiously from side to side,
whilst Smith drove stolidly on looking neither to time right nor
left.</p>

<p>"Where is the house?" said Mr. Maydew presently.</p>

<p>"At the bend of the road," answered Maggie, her heart sickening as
she looked out through the failing light to see the trees stretching
their ranks in unbroken formation along it. The cart reached the bend.
"It should be here," whispered Maggie.</p>

<p>They pulled up. Just in front of them the road bent to the right
round a tongue of land, which, unlike the rest of the right hand side
of the road, was free from trees and was covered only by rough grass
and stray bushes. A closer inspection disclosed evident signs of
terraces having once been formed on it, but of a house there was no
trace.</p>

<p>"Is this the place?" said Mr. Maydew in a low voice.</p>

<p>Maggie nodded.</p>

<p>"But there is no house here," said her father. "What does it all
mean? Are you sure of yourself, Maggie? Where is Alice?"</p>

<p>Before Maggie could answer a voice was heard calling "Father!
Maggie!" The sound of the voice was thin and high and, paradoxically,
it sounded both very near and yet as if it came from some infinite
distance. The cry was thrice repeated and then silence fell. Mr. Maydew
and Maggie stared at each other.</p>

<p>"That was Alice's voice," said Mr. Maydew huskily, "she is near and
in trouble, and is calling us. Which way did you think it came from,
Smith?" he added, turning to the gardener.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear anybody calling," said the man.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" answered Mr. Maydew.</p>

<p>And then he and Maggie both began to call "Alice. Alice. Where are
you?" There was no reply and Mr. Maydew sprang from the cart, at the
same time bidding Smith to hand the reins to Maggie and come and search
for the missing girl. Smith obeyed him and both men, scrambling up the
turfy bit of ground, began to search and call through the neighbouring
wood. They heard and saw nothing, however, and after an agonised search
Mr. Maydew ran down to the cart and begged Maggie to drive on to
Blaise's Farm for help leaving himself and Smith to continue the
search. Maggie followed her father's instructions and was fortunate
enough to find Mr.</p>

<p>Rumbold, the farmer, his two sons and a couple of labourers just
returning from the harvest field.</p>

<p>She explained what had happened, and the farmer and his men promptly
volunteered to form a search party, though Maggie, in spite of her
anxiety, noticed a queer expression on Mr.</p>

<p>Rumbold's face as she told him her talc.</p>

<p>The party, provided with lanterns, now went down the Bottom, joined
Mr. Maydew and Smith and made an exhaustive but absolutely fruitless
search of the woods near the bend of the road.</p>

<p>No trace of the missing girl was to be found, and after a long and
anxious time the search was abandoned, one of the young Rumbolds
volunteering to ride into the nearest town and notify the police.</p>

<p>Maggie, though with little hope in her own heart, endeavoured to
cheer her father on their homeward way with the idea that Alice might
have returned to Overbury over the Downs whilst they were going by road
to the Bottom, and that she had seen them and called to them in jest
when they were opposite the tongue of land.</p>

<p>However, when they reached home there was no Alice and, though the
next day the search was resumed and full inquiries were instituted by
the police, all was to no purpose. No trace of Alice was ever found,
the last human being that saw her having been an old woman, who had met
her going down the path into the Bottom on the afternoon of her
disappearance, and who described her as smiling but looking
"queerlike."</p>

<p>This is the end of the story, but the following may throw some light
upon it.</p>

<p>The history of Alice's mysterious disappearance became widely known
through the medium of the Press and Mr. Roberts, distressed beyond
measure at what had taken place, returned in all haste to Overbury to
offer what comfort and help he could give to his afflicted friend and
tenant.</p>

<p>He called upon the Maydews and, having heard their tale, sat for a
short time in silence. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard any local gossip concerning this Colonel and
Mrs. Paxton?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Maydew, "I never heard their names until the day
of my poor daughter's fatal visit."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Roberts, "I will tell you all I can about them,
which is not very much, I fear."</p>

<p>He paused and then went on: "I am now nearly seventy-five years old,
and for nearly seventy years no house has stood in Brickett Bottom. But
when I was a child of about five there was an old-fashioned, red brick
house standing in a garden at the bend of the road, such as you have
described. It was owned and lived in by a retired Indian soldier and
his wife, a Colonel and Mrs. Paxton. At the time I speak of, certain
events having taken place at the house and the old couple having died,
it was sold by their heirs to Lord Carew, who shortly after pulled it
down on the ground that it interfered with his shooting. Colonel and
Mrs. Paxton were well known to my father, who was the clergyman here
before me, and to the neighbourhood in general. They lived quietly and
were not unpopular, but the Colonel was supposed to possess a violent
and vindictive temper. Their family consisted only of themselves, their
daughter and a couple of servants, the Colonel's old Army servant and
his Eurasian wife. Well, I cannot tell you details of what happened, I
was only a child; my father never liked gossip and in later years, when
he talked to me on the subject, he always avoided any appearance of
exaggeration or sensationalism."</p>

<p>"However, it is known that Miss Paxton fell in love with and became
engaged to a young man to whom her parents took a strong dislike. They
used every possible means to break off the match, and many rumours were
set on foot as to their conduct--undue influence, even cruelty were
charged against them. I do not know the truth, all I can say is that
Miss Paxton died and a very bitter feeling against her parents sprang
up. My father, however, continued to call, but was rarely admitted. In
fact, he never saw Colonel Paxton after his daughter's death and only
saw Mrs. Paxton once or twice. He described her as an utterly broken
woman, and was not surprised at her following her daughter to the grave
in about three months' time. Colonel Paxton became, if possible, more
of a recluse than ever after his wife's death and himself died not more
than a month after her under circumstances which pointed to suicide.
Again a crop of rumours sprang up, but there was no one in particular
to take action, the doctor certified Death from Natural Causes, and
Colonel Paxton, like his wife and daughter, was buried in this
churchyard. The property passed to a distant relative, who came down to
it for one night shortly afterwards; he never came again, having
apparently conceived a violent dislike to the place, but arranged to
pension off the servants and then sold the house to Lord Carew, who was
glad to purchase this little island in the middle of his property. He
pulled it down soon after he had bought it, and the garden was left to
relapse into a wilderness."</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts paused.</p>

<p>"Those are all the facts," he added.</p>

<p>"But there is something more," said Maggie.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts hesitated for a while.</p>

<p>"You have a right to know all," he said almost to himself; then
louder he continued: "What I am now going to tell you is really rumour,
vague and uncertain; I cannot fathom its truth or its meaning. About
five years after the house had been pulled down a young maidservant at
Carew Court was out walking one afternoon. She was a stranger to the
village and a new-coiner to the Court. On returning home to tea she
told her fellow-servants that as she walked down Brickett Bottom, which
place she described clearly, she passed a red brick house at the bend
of the road and that a kind-faced old lady had asked her to step in for
a while. She did not go in, not because she had any suspicions of there
being anything uncanny, but simply because she feared to be late for
tea.</p>

<p>"I do not think she ever visited the Bottom again and she had no
other similar experience, so far as I am aware.</p>

<p>"Two or three years later, shortly after my father's death, a
travelling tinker with his wife and daughter camped for the night at
the foot of the Bottom. The girl strolled away up the glen to gather
blackberries and was never seen or heard of again. She was searched for
in vain--of course, one does not know the truth--and she may have run
away voluntarily from her parents, although there was no known cause
for her doing so.</p>

<p>"That," concluded Mr. Roberts, "is all I can tell you of either
facts or rumours; all that I can now do is to pray for you and for
her."</p>
