<h2>CHAPTER I - A DOUBLE TRAGEDY</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9; 10 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>IT has long been a source of wonder to me why the leading
criminological writers&mdash;men like Edmund Lester Pearson, H. B.
Irving, Filson Young, Canon Brookes, William Bolitho, and Harold
Eaton&mdash;have not devoted more space to the Greene tragedy; for
here, surely, is one of the outstanding murder mysteries of modern
times&mdash;a case practically unique in the annals of latter-day
crime. And yet I realize, as I read over my own voluminous notes on
the case, and inspect the various documents relating to it, how
little of its inner history ever came to light, and how impossible
it would be for even the most imaginative chronicler to fill in the
hiatuses.</p>

<p>The world, of course, knows the external facts. For over a month
the Press of two continents was filled with accounts of this
appalling tragedy; and even the bare outline was sufficient to
gratify the public's craving for the abnormal and the spectacular.
But the inside story of the catastrophe surpassed even the wildest
flights of public fancy; and, as I now sit down to divulge those
facts for the first time, I am oppressed with a feeling akin to
unreality, although I was a witness to most of them and hold in my
possession the incontestable records of their actuality.</p>

<p>Of the fiendish ingenuity which lay behind this terrible crime,
of the warped psychological motives that inspired it, and of the
strange hidden sources of its technique, the world is completely
ignorant. Moreover, no explanation has ever been given of the
analytic steps that led to its solution. Nor have the events
attending the mechanism of that solution&mdash;events in themselves
highly dramatic and unusual&mdash;ever been recounted. The public
believes that the termination of the case was a result of the usual
police methods of investigation; but this is because the public is
unaware of many of the vital factors of the crime itself, and
because both the Police Department and the District Attorney's
office have, as if by tacit agreement, refused to make known the
entire truth&mdash;whether for fear of being disbelieved or merely
because there are certain things so terrible that no man wishes to
talk of them, I do not know.</p>

<p>The record, therefore, which I am about to set down is the first
complete and unedited history of the Greene holocaust.* (*It is, I
hope, unnecessary for me to state that I have received official
permission for my task.) I feel that now the truth should be known,
for it is history, and one should not shrink from historical facts.
Also, I believe that the credit for the solution of this case
should go where it belongs.</p>

<p>The man who elucidated the mystery and brought to a close that
palimpsest of horror was, curiously enough, in no way officially
connected with the police; and in all the published accounts of the
murder his name was not once mentioned. And yet, had it not been
for him and his novel methods of criminal deduction, the heinous
plot against the Greene family would have been conclusively
successful. The police in their researches were dealing
dogmatically with the evidential appearances of the crime, whereas
the operations of the criminal were being conducted on a plane
quite beyond the comprehension of the ordinary investigator.</p>

<p>This man who, after weeks of sedulous and disheartening
analysis, eventually ferreted out the source of the horror, was a
young social aristocrat, an intimate friend of John F.-X. Markham,
the District Attorney. His name I am not at liberty to divulge, but
for the purposes of these chronicles I have chosen to call him
Philo Vance. He is no longer in this country, having transferred
his residence several years ago to a villa outside Florence; and,
since he has no intention of returning to America, he has acceded
to my request to publish the history of the criminal cases in which
he participated as a sort of <i>amicus curiae</i>. Markham also has
retired to private life; and Sergeant Ernest Heath, that doughty
and honest officer of the Homicide Bureau who officially handled
the Greene case for the Police Department, has, through an
unexpected legacy, been able to gratify his life's ambition to
breed fancy Wyandottes on a model farm in the Mohawk Valley. Thus
circumstances have made it possible for me to publish my intimate
records of the Greene tragedy.</p>

<p>A few words are necessary to explain my own participation in the
case. (I say "participation," though, in reality, my role was that
of passive spectator.) For several years I had been Vance's
personal attorney. I had resigned from my father's law
firm&mdash;Van Dine, Davis &amp; Van Dine&mdash;in order to devote
myself exclusively to Vance's legal and financial needs, which, by
the way, were not many. Vance and I had been friends from our
undergraduate days at Harvard, and I found in my new duties as his
legal agent and monetary steward a sinecure combined with many
social and cultural compensations.</p>

<p>Vance at that time was thirty-four years old. He was just under
six feet, slender, sinewy, and graceful. His chiselled regular
features gave his face the attraction of strength and uniform
modelling, but a sardonic coldness of expression precluded the
designation of handsome. He had aloof grey eyes, a straight,
slender nose, and a mouth suggesting both cruelty and asceticism.
But, despite the severity of his lineaments&mdash;which acted like
an impenetrable glass wall between him and his fellows&mdash;he was
highly sensitive and mobile; and, though his manner was somewhat
detached and supercilious, he exerted an undeniable fascination
over those who knew him at all well.</p>

<p>Much of his education had been acquired in Europe, and he still
retained a slight Oxonian accent and intonation, though I happen to
be aware that this was no affectation: he cared too little for the
opinions of others to trouble about maintaining any pose. He was an
indefatigable student. His mind was ever eager for knowledge, and
he devoted much of his time to the study of ethnology and
psychology. His greatest intellectual enthusiasm was art, and he
fortunately had an income sufficient to indulge his passion for
collecting. It was, however, his interest in psychology and his
application of it to individual behaviourism that first turned his
attention to the criminal problems which came under Markham's
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The first case in which he participated was, as I have recorded
elsewhere, the murder of Alvin Benson* (*"The Benson Murder Case").
The second was the seemingly insoluble strangling of the famous
Broadway beauty, Margaret Odell* (*"The 'Canary' Murder Case"). And
in the late fall of the same year came the Greene tragedy. As in
the two former cases, I kept a complete record of this new
investigation. I possessed myself of every available document,
making verbatim copies of those claimed for the police archives,
and even jotted down the numerous conversations that took place in
and out of conference between Vance and the official investigators.
And, in addition, I kept a diary which, for elaborateness and
completeness, would have been the despair of Samuel Pepys.</p>

<p>The Greene murder case occurred toward the end of Markham's
first year in office. As you may remember, the winter came very
early that season. There were two severe blizzards in November, and
the amount of snow-fall for that month broke all local records for
eighteen years. I mention this fact of the early snows because it
played a sinister part in the Greene affair: it was, indeed, one of
the vital factors of the murderer's scheme. No one has yet
understood, or even sensed, the connection between the unseasonable
weather of that late fall and the fatal tragedy that fell upon the
Greene household; but that is because all of the dark secrets of
the case were not made known.</p>

<p>Vance was projected into the Benson murder as the result of a
direct challenge from Markham; and his activities in the Canary
case were due to his own expressed desire to lend a hand. But pure
coincidence was responsible for his participation in the Greene
investigation. During the two months that had elapsed since his
solution of the Canary's death Markham had called upon him several
times regarding moot points of criminal detection in connection
with the routine work of the District Attorney's office; and it was
during an informal discussion of one of these problems that the
Greene case was first mentioned.</p>

<p>Markham and Vance had long been friends. Though dissimilar in
tastes and even in ethical outlook, they nevertheless respected
each other profoundly. I have often marvelled at the friendship of
these two antipodal men; but as the years went by I came more and
more to understand it. It was as if they were drawn together by
those very qualities which each realized&mdash;perhaps with a
certain repressed regret&mdash;were lacking in his own nature.
Markham was forthright, brusque, and, on occasion, domineering,
taking life with grim and serious concern, and following the
dictates of his legal conscience in the face of every obstacle:
honest, incorruptible, and untiring. Vance, on the other hand, was
volatile, debonair, and possessed of a perpetual Juvenalian
cynicism, smiling ironically at the bitterest realities, and
consistently fulfilling the role of a whimsically disinterested
spectator of life. But, withal, he understood people as profoundly
as he understood art, and his dissection of motives and his shrewd
readings of character were&mdash;as I had many occasions to
witness&mdash;uncannily accurate. Markham apprehended these
qualities in Vance, and sensed their true value.</p>

<p>It was not yet ten o'clock of the morning of November the 9th
when Vance and I, after motoring to the old Criminal Courts
Building on the corner of Franklin and Centre Streets, went
directly to the District Attorney's office on the fourth floor. On
that momentous forenoon two gangsters, each accusing the other of
firing the fatal shot in a recent pay-roll hold-up, were to be
cross-examined by Markham; and this interview was to decide the
question as to which of the men would be charged with murder and
which held as a State's witness. Markham and Vance had discussed
the situation the night before in the lounge-room of the Stuyvesant
Club, and Vance had expressed a desire to be present at the
examination. Markham had readily assented, and so we had risen
early and driven down-town.</p>

<p>The interview with the two men lasted for an hour, and Vance's
disconcerting opinion was that neither was guilty of the actual
shooting.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," he drawled, when the sheriff had returned
the prisoners to the Tombs, "those two Jack Sheppards are quite
sincere: each one thinks he's telling the truth. Ergo, neither of
'em fired the shot. A distressin' predicament. They're obvious
gallows-birds&mdash;born for the gibbet; and it's a beastly shame
not to be able to round out their destinies in proper fashion...I
say, wasn't there another participant in the hold-up?"</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "A third got away. According to these two, it
was a well- known gangster named Eddie Maleppo."</p>

<p>"Then Eduardo is your man."* (*This was subsequently proved
correct. Nearly a year later Maleppo was arrested in Detroit,
extradited to New York, and convicted of the murder. His two
companions had already been successfully prosecuted for robbery.
They are now serving long terms in Sing Sing.)</p>

<p>Markham did not reply, and Vance rose lazily and reached for his
ulster.</p>

<p>"By the by," he said, slipping into his coat, "I note that our
upliftin' Press bedecked its front pages this morning with
head-lines about a pogrom at the old Greene mansion last night.
Wherefore?"</p>

<p>Markham glanced quickly at the clock on the wall, and
frowned.</p>

<p>"That reminds me. Chester Greene called up the first thing this
morning and insisted on seeing me. I told him eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Where do you fit in?" Vance had taken his hand from the
door-knob, and drew out his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>"I don't!" snapped Markham. "But people think the District
Attorney's office is a kind of clearing-house for all their
troubles. It happens, however, that I've known Chester Greene a
long time&mdash;we're both members of the Marylebone Golf
Club&mdash;and so I must listen to his plaint about what was
obviously an attempt to annex the famous Greene plate."</p>

<p>"Burglary&mdash;eh, what?" Vance took a few puffs on his
cigarette. "With two women shot?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was a miserable business! An amateur, no doubt. Got in a
panic, shot up the place, and bolted."</p>

<p>"Seems a dashed curious proceeding." Vance abstractedly reseated
himself in a large arm-chair near the door. "Did the antique
cutlery actually disappear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing was taken. The thief was evidently frightened off
before he made his haul."</p>

<p>"Sounds a bit thick, don't y' know.&mdash;An amateur thief
breaks into a prominent home, casts a predat'ry eye on the
dining-room silver, takes alarm, goes upstairs and shoots two women
in their respective boudoirs, and then flees...Very touchin' and
all that, but unconvincin'. Whence came this caressin' theory?"</p>

<p>Markham was glowering, but when he spoke it was with an effort
at restraint.</p>

<p>"Feathergill was on duty last night when the call was relayed
from Head- quarters, and accompanied the police to the house. He
agrees with their conclusions." (Amos Feathergill was then an
Assistant District Attorney. He later ran on the Tammany ticket for
assemblyman, and was elected.)</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I could bear to know why Chester Greene is
desirous of having polite converse with you."</p>

<p>Markham compressed his lips. He was not in cordial mood that
morning, and Vance's flippant curiosity irked him. After a moment,
however, he said grudgingly:</p>

<p>"Since the attempted robbery interests you so keenly, you may,
if you insist, wait and hear what Greene has to say."</p>

<p>"I'll stay," smiled Vance, removing his coat. "I'm weak; just
can't resist a passionate entreaty...Which one of the Greenes is
Chester? And how is he related to the two deceased?</p>

<p>"There was only one murder," Markham corrected him in a tone of
forbearance. "The oldest daughter&mdash;an unmarried woman in her
early forties&mdash;was killed instantly. A younger daughter, who
was also shot, has, I believe, a chance of recovery."</p>

<p>"And Chester?"</p>

<p>"Chester is the elder son, a man of forty or thereabouts. He was
the first person on the scene after the shot had been fired."</p>

<p>"What other members of the family are there? I know old Tobias
Greene has gone to his Maker."</p>

<p>"Yes, old Tobias died about twelve years ago. But his wife is
still living, though she's a helpless paralytic. Then there
are&mdash;or rather were&mdash;five children: the oldest, Julia;
next, Chester; then another daughter, Sibella, a few years under
thirty, I should say; then Rex, a sickly, bookish boy a year or so
younger than Sibella; and Ada, the youngest, an adopted daughter
twenty-two or three, perhaps."</p>

<p>"And it was Julia who was killed, eh? Which of the other two
girls was shot?</p>

<p>"The younger&mdash;Ada. Her room, it seems, is across the hall
from Julia's, and the thief apparently got in it by mistake while
making his escape. As I understand it, he entered Ada's room
immediately after firing on Julia, saw his error, fired again, and
then fled, eventually going down the stairs and out the main
entrance."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a while in silence.</p>

<p>"Your hypothetical intruder must have been deuced confused to
have mistaken Ada's bedroom door for the staircase, what? And then
there's the query: what was this anonymous gentleman who had called
to collect the plate, doing above-stairs?"</p>

<p>"Probably looking for jewellery." Markham was rapidly losing
patience. "<i>I</i> am not omniscient." There was irony in his
inflection.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Markham!" pleaded Vance cajolingly. "Don't be
vindictive. Your Greene burglary promises several nice points in
academic speculation. Permit me to indulge my idle whims."</p>

<p>At that moment Swacker, Markham's youthful and alert secretary,
appeared at the swinging door which communicated with a narrow
chamber between the main waiting-room and the District Attorney's
private office.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chester Greene is here," he announced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II - THE INVESTIGATION OPENS</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 11 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>WHEN Chester Greene entered it was obvious he was under a
nervous strain; but his nervousness evoked no sympathy in me. From
the very first I disliked the man. He was of medium height and was
bordering on corpulence. There was something soft and flabby in his
contours; and, though he was dressed with studied care, there were
certain signs of overemphasis about his clothes. His cuffs were too
tight; his collar was too snug; and the coloured silk handkerchief
hung too far out of his breast-pocket. He was slightly bald, and
the lids of his close-set eyes projected like those of a man with
Bright's disease. His mouth, surmounted by a close-cropped blond
moustache, was loose; and his chin receded slightly and was deeply
creased below the under lip. He typified the pampered idler.</p>

<p>When he had shaken hands with Markham, and Vance and I had been
introduced, he seated himself and meticulously inserted a brown
Russian cigarette in a long amber-and-gold holder.</p>

<p>"I'd be tremendously obliged, Markham," he said, lighting his
cigarette from an ivory pocket-lighter, "if you'd make a personal
investigation of the row that occurred at our diggin's last night.
The police will never get anywhere the way they're going about it.
Good fellows, you understand&mdash;the police. But...well, there's
something about this affair&mdash;don't know just how to put it.
Anyway, I don't like it."</p>

<p>Markham studied him closely for several moments. "Just what's on
your mind, Greene?"</p>

<p>The other crushed out his cigarette, though he had taken no more
than half a dozen puffs, and drummed indecisively on the arm of his
chair.</p>

<p>"Wish I knew. It's a rum affair&mdash;damned rum. There's
something back of it, too&mdash;something that's going to raise the
very devil if we don't stop it. Can't explain it. It's a feeling
I've got."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Greene is psychic," commented Vance, with a look of
bland innocence.</p>

<p>The man swung about and scrutinized Vance with aggressive
condescension. "Tosh!" He brought out another Russian cigarette,
and turned again to Markham. "I do wish you'd take a peep at the
situation."</p>

<p>Markham hesitated. "Surely you've some reason for disagreeing
with the police and appealing to me."</p>

<p>"Funny thing, but I haven't." (It seemed to me his hand shook
slightly as he lit his second cigarette.) "I simply know that my
mind rejects the burglar story automatically."</p>

<p>It was difficult to tell if he were being frank or deliberately
hiding something. I did feel, however, that some sort of fear
lurked beneath his uneasiness; and I also got the impression that
he was far from being heart-broken over the tragedy.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," declared Markham, "that the theory of the
burglar is entirely consistent with the facts. There have been many
other cases of a housebreaker suddenly taking alarm, losing his
head, and needlessly shooting people."</p>

<p>Greene rose abruptly and began pacing up and down.</p>

<p>"I can't argue the case," he muttered. "It's beyond all that, if
you understand me." He looked quickly at the District Attorney with
staring eyes. "Gad! It's got me in a cold sweat."</p>

<p>"It's all too vague and intangible," Markham observed kindly.
"I'm inclined to think the tragedy has upset you. Perhaps after a
day or two&mdash;"</p>

<p>Greene lifted a protesting hand.</p>

<p>"It's no go. I'm telling you, Markham, the police will never
find their burglar. I feel it&mdash;here." He mincingly laid a
manicured hand on his breast.</p>

<p>Vance had been watching him with a faint suggestion of
amusement. Now he stretched his legs before him and gazed up at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Greene&mdash;pardon the intrusion on your esoteric
gropings&mdash;but do you know of anyone with a reason for wanting
your two sisters out of the way?"</p>

<p>The man looked blank for a moment.</p>

<p>"No," he answered finally; "can't say that I do. Who, in
Heaven's name, would want to kill two harmless women?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the groggiest notion. But, since you repudiate the
burglar theory, and since the two ladies were undoubtedly shot,
it's inferable that someone sought their demise; and it occurred to
me that you, being their brother and domiciled <i>en famille</i>,
might know of someone who harboured homicidal sentiments towards
them."</p>

<p>Greene bristled, and thrust his head forward. "I know of no
one," he blurted. Then, turning to Markham, he continued
wheedlingly: "If I had the slightest suspicion, don't you think I'd
come out with it? This thing has got on my nerves. I've been
mulling over it all night, and it's&mdash;it's bothersome,
frightfully bothersome."</p>

<p>Markham nodded non-committally, and rising, walked to the
window, where he stood, his hands behind him, gazing down on the
grey stone masonry of the Tombs.</p>

<p>Vance, despite his apparent apathy, had been studying Greene
closely; and, as Markham turned to the window, he straightened up
slightly in his chair.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he began, an ingratiating note in his voice; "just
what happened last night? I understand you were the first to reach
the prostrate women."</p>

<p>"I was the first to reach my sister Julia," retorted Greene,
with a hint of resentment. "It was Sproot, the butler, who found
Ada unconscious, bleeding from a nasty wound in her back."</p>

<p>"Her back, eh?" Vance leaned forward, and lifted his eyebrows.
"She was shot from behind, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Greene frowned and inspected his finger-nails, as if he,
too, sensed something disturbing in the fact.</p>

<p>"And Miss Julia Greene: was she, too, shot from behind?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;from the front."</p>

<p>"Extr'ordin'ry!" Vance blew a ring of smoke toward the dusty
chandelier. "And had both women retired for the night?"</p>

<p>"An hour before...But what has all that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"One never knows, does one? However, it's always well to be in
possession of these little details when trying to run down the
elusive source of a psychic seizure."</p>

<p>"Psychic seizure be damned!" growled Greene truculently. "Can't
a man have a feeling about something without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;quite. But you've asked for the District Attorney's
assistance, and I'm sure he would like a few data before making a
decision."</p>

<p>Markham came forward and sat down on the edge of the table. His
curiosity had been aroused, and he indicated to Greene his sympathy
with Vance's interrogation.</p>

<p>Greene pursed his lips, and returned his cigarette-holder to his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. What else do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"You might relate for us," dulcetly resumed Vance, "the exact
order of events after you heard the first shot. I presume you did
hear the shot."</p>

<p>"Certainly I heard it&mdash;couldn't have helped hearing it.
Julia's room is next to mine, and I was still awake. I jumped into
my slippers and pulled on my dressing-gown; then I went out into
the hall. It was dark, and I felt my way along the wall until I
reached Julia's door. I opened it and looked in&mdash;didn't know
who might be there waiting to pop me&mdash;and I saw her lying in
bed, the front of her night-gown covered with blood. There was no
one else in the room, and I went to her immediately. Just then I
heard another shot which sounded as if it cane from Ada's room. I
was a bit muzzy by this time&mdash;didn't know what I'd better do;
and as I stood by Julia's bed in something of a funk&mdash;oh, I
was in a funk all right..."</p>

<p>"Can't say that I blame you," Vance encouraged him.</p>

<p>Greene nodded. "A damned ticklish position to be in. Well,
anyway, as I stood there, I heard someone coming down the stairs
from the servants' quarters on the third floor, and recognized old
Sproot's tread. He fumbled along in the dark, and I heard him enter
Ada's door. Then he called to me, and I hurried over. Ada was lying
in front of the dressingtable; and Sproot and I lifted her on the
bed. I'd gone a bit weak in the knees; was expecting any minute to
hear another shot&mdash;don't know why. Anyway, it didn't come; and
then I heard Sproot's voice at the hall telephone calling up Doctor
Von Blon."</p>

<p>"I see nothing in your account, Greene, inconsistent with the
theory of a burglar," observed Markham. "And furthermore,
Feathergill, my assistant, says there were two sets of confused
footprints in the snow outside the front door."</p>

<p>Greene shrugged his shoulders, but did not answer.</p>

<p>"By the by, Mr. Greene"&mdash;Vance had slipped down in his
chair and was staring into space&mdash;"you said that when you
looked into Miss Julia's room you saw her in bed. How was that? Did
you turn on the light?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!" The man appeared puzzled by the question. "The light
was on."</p>

<p>There was a flutter of interest in Vance's eyes.</p>

<p>"And how about Miss Ada's room? Was the light on there
also?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Vance reached into his pocket, and, drawing out his
cigarette-case, carefully and deliberately selected a cigarette. I
recognized in the action an evidence of repressed inner
excitement.</p>

<p>"So the lights were on in both rooms. Most interestin'."</p>

<p>Markham, too, recognized the eagerness beneath his apparent
indifference, and regarded him expectantly.</p>

<p>"And," pursued Vance, after lighting his cigarette leisurely,
"how long a time would you say elapsed between the two shots?"</p>

<p>Greene was obviously annoyed by this cross-examination, but he
answered readily.</p>

<p>"Two or three minutes&mdash;certainly no longer."</p>

<p>"Still," ruminated Vance, "after you heard the first shot you
rose from your bed, donned slippers and robe, went into the hall,
felt along the wall to the next room, opened the door cautiously,
peered inside, and then crossed the room to the bed&mdash;all this,
I gather, before the second shot was fired. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it's correct."</p>

<p>"Well, well! As you say, two or three minutes. Yes, at least
that. Astonishin'!" Vance turned to Markham. "Really, y' know, old
man, I don't wish to influence your judgment, but I rather think
you ought to accede to Mr. Greene's request to take a hand in this
investigation. I too have a psychic feeling about the case.
Something tells me that your eccentric burglar will prove an
<i>ignis fatuus</i>."</p>

<p>Markham eyed him with meditative curiosity. Not only had Vance's
questioning of Greene interested him keenly, but he knew, as a
result of long experience, that Vance would not have made the
suggestion had he not had a good reason for doing so. I was in no
wise surprised, therefore, when he turned to his restive visitor
and said:</p>

<p>"Very well, Greene, I'll see what I can do in the matter. I'll
probably be at your house early this afternoon. Please see that
everyone is present, as I'll want to question them."</p>

<p>Greene held out a trembling hand. "The domestic
roster&mdash;family and servants&mdash;will be complete when you
arrive."</p>

<p>He strode pompously from the room.</p>

<p>Vance sighed. "Not a nice creature, Markham&mdash;not at all a
nice creature. I shall never be a politician if it involves an
acquaintance with such gentlemen."</p>

<p>Markham seated himself at his desk with a disgruntled air.</p>

<p>"Greene is highly regarded as a social&mdash;not a
political&mdash;decoration," he said maliciously. "He belongs to
your totem, not mine."</p>

<p>"Fancy that!" Vance stretched himself luxuriously. "Still, it's
you who fascinate him. Intuition tells me he is not overfond of
me."</p>

<p>"You did treat him a bit cavalierly. Sarcasm is not exactly a
means of endearment."</p>

<p>"But, Markham, old thing, I wasn't pining for Chester's
affection."</p>

<p>"You think he knows, or suspects, something?" Vance gazed
through the long window into the bleak sky beyond.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he murmured. Then: "Is Chester, by any chance, a
typical representative of the Greene family? Of recent years I've
done so little mingling with the elite that I'm woefully ignorant
of the East Side nabobs."</p>

<p>Markham nodded reflectively.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he is. The original Greene stock was sturdy, but the
present generation seems to have gone somewhat to pot. Old Tobias
the Third&mdash; Chester's father&mdash;was a rugged and, in many
ways, admirable character. He appears, however, to have been the
last heir of the ancient Greene qualities. What's left of the
family has suffered some sort of disintegration. They're not
exactly soft, but tainted with patches of incipient decay, like
fruit that's lain on the ground too long. Too much money and
leisure, I imagine, and too little restraint. On the other hand,
there's a certain intellectuality lurking in the new Greenes. They
all seem to have good minds, even if futile and misdirected. In
fact, I think you underestimate Chester. For all his banalities and
effeminate mannerisms, he's far from being as stupid as you regard
him."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> regard Chester as stupid! My dear Markham&mdash;my
very dear Markham! You wrong me abominably. No, no. There's nothing
of the anointed ass about our Chester. He's shrewder even than you
think him. Those oedematous eyelids veil a pair of particularly
crafty eyes. Indeed, it was largely his studied pose of fatuousness
that led me to suggest that you aid and abet in the
investigation."</p>

<p>Markham leaned back and narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's in your mind, Vance?"</p>

<p>"I told you. A psychic seizure&mdash;same like Chester's
subliminal visitation."</p>

<p>Markham knew, by this elusive answer, that for the moment Vance
had no intention of being more definite; and after a moment of
scowling silence he turned to the telephone.</p>

<p>"If I'm to take on this case, I'd better find out who has charge
of it and get what preliminary information I can."</p>

<p>He called up Inspector Moran, the commanding officer of the
Detective Bureau. After a brief conversation he turned to Vance
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Your friend, Sergeant Heath, has the case in hand. He happened
to be in the office just now, and is coming here immediately."*
(*It was Sergeant Ernest Heath, of the Homicide Bureau, who had
been in charge of both the Benson and the Canary cases; and,
although he had been openly antagonistic to Vance during the first
of these investigations, a curious good-fellowship had later grown
up between them. Vance admired the Sergeant's dogged and
straightforward qualities; and Heath had developed a keen
respect&mdash;with certain reservations, however&mdash;for Vance's
abilities.)</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes Heath arrived. Despite the fact
that he had been up most of the night, he appeared unusually alert
and energetic. His broad, pugnacious features were as imperturbable
as ever, and his pale-blue eyes held their habitual penetrating
intentness. He greeted Markham with an elaborate, though
perfunctory handshake; and then, seeing Vance, relaxed his features
into a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't Mr. Vance! What have you been up to,
sir?"</p>

<p>Vance rose and shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"Alas, Sergeant, I've been immersed in the terra-cotta
ornamentation of Renaissance facades, and other such trivialities,
since I saw you last.* But I'm happy to note that crime is picking
up again. It's a deuced drab world without a nice murky murder now
and then, don't y' know." (*Vance, after reading proof of this
sentence, requested me to make mention here of that beautiful
volume, "Terra Cotta of the Italian Renaissance," recently
published by the National Terra Cotta Society, New York.)</p>

<p>Heath cocked an eye, and turned inquiringly to the District
Attorney. He had long since learned how to read between the lines
of Vance's badinage.</p>

<p>"It's this Greene case, Sergeant," said Markham.</p>

<p>"I thought so." Heath sat down heavily, and inserted a black
cigar between his lips. "But nothing's broken yet. We're rounding
up all the regulars, and looking into their alibis for last night.
But it'll take several days before the check-up's complete. If the
bird who did the job hadn't got scared before he grabbed the swag,
we might be able to trace him through the pawnshops and fences. But
something rattled him, or he wouldn't have shot up the works the
way he did. And that's what makes me think he may be a new one at
the racket. If he is, it'll make our job harder." He held a match
in cupped hands to his cigar, and puffed furiously. "What did you
want to know about the prowl, sir?"</p>

<p>Markham hesitated. The Sergeant's matter-of-fact assumption that
a common burglar was the culprit disconcerted him.</p>

<p>"Chester Greene was here," he explained presently; "and he seems
convinced that the shooting was not the work of a thief. He asked
me, as a special favour, to look into the matter."</p>

<p>Heath gave a derisive grunt.</p>

<p>"Who but a burglar in a panic would shoot down two women?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, Sergeant." It was Vance who answered. "Still, the
lights were turned on in both rooms, though the women had gone to
bed an hour before; and there was an interval of several minutes
between the two shots."</p>

<p>"I know all that." Heath spoke impatiently. "But if an amachoor
did the job, we can't tell exactly what did happen upstairs there
last night. When a bird loses his head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! There's the rub. When a thief loses his head, d'ye see, he
isn't apt to go from room to room turning on the lights, even
assuming he knows where and how to turn them on. And he certainly
isn't going to dally around for several minutes in a black hall
between such fantastic operations, especially after he has shot
someone and alarmed the house, what? It doesn't look like panic to
me; it looks strangely like design. Moreover, why should this
precious amateur of yours be cavorting about the boudoirs upstairs
when the loot was in the dining-room below?"</p>

<p>"We'll learn all about that when we've got our man," countered
Heath doggedly.</p>

<p>"The point is, Sergeant," put in Markham, "I've given Mr. Greene
my promise to look into the matter, and I wanted to get what
details I could from you. You understand, of course," he added
mollifyingly, "that I shall not interfere with your activities in
any way. Whatever the outcome of the case, your department will
receive entire credit."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, sir." Experience had taught Heath that he
had nothing to fear in the way of lost <i>kudos</i> when working
with Markham. "But I don't think, in spite of Mr. Vance's ideas,
that you'll find much in the Greene case to warrant attention."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Markham admitted. "However, I've committed
myself, and I think I'll run out this afternoon and look over the
situation, if you'll give me the lie of die land."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell." Heath chewed on his cigar
cogitatingly. "A Doctor Von Blon&mdash;the Greene family
physician&mdash;phoned Headquarters about midnight. I'd just got in
from an up-town stick-up call, and I hopped out to the house with a
couple of the boys from the Bureau. I found the two women, like you
know, one dead and the other unconscious&mdash;both shot. I phoned,
Doc Doremus,* (*Doctor Emanuel Doremus, the Chief Medical Examiner)
and then looked the place over. Mr. Feathergill came along and lent
a hand; but we didn't find much of anything. The fellow that did
the job musta got in by the front door some way, for there was a
set of footprints in the snow coming and going, besides Doctor Von
Blon's. But the snow was too flaky to get any good impressions. It
stopped snowing along about eleven o'clock last night; and there's
no doubt that the prints belonged to the burglar, for no one else,
except the doctor, had come or gone after the storm."</p>

<p>"An amateur housebreaker with a front-door key to the Greene
mansion," murmured Vance. "Extr'ordin'ry!"</p>

<p>"I'm not saying he had a key, sir," protested Heath. "I'm simply
telling you what we found. The door mighta been unlatched by
mistake; or someone mighta opened it for him."</p>

<p>"Go on with the story, Sergeant," urged Markham, giving Vance a
reproving look.</p>

<p>"Well, after Doc Doremus got there and made an examination of
the older woman's body and inspected the younger one's wound, I
questioned all the family and the servants&mdash;a butler, two
maids, and a cook. Chester Greene and the butler were the only ones
who had heard the first shot, which was fired about half-past
eleven. But the second shot roused old Mrs. Greene&mdash;her room
adjoins the younger daughter's. The rest of the household had slept
through all the excitement; but this Chester fellow had woke 'em
all up by the time I got there. I talked to all of 'em, but nobody
knew anything. After a coupla hours I left a man inside and another
outside, and came away. Then I set the usual machinery going; and
this morning Captain Dubois went over the place the best he could
for finger-prints. Doc Doremus has got the body for an autopsy, and
we'll get a report to-night. But there'll be nothing helpful from
that quarter. She was fired on from in front at close
range&mdash;almost a contact shot. And the other woman&mdash;the
young one&mdash;was all powder-marked, and her night-gown was
burnt. She was shot from behind.&mdash;That's about all the
dope."</p>

<p>"Have you been able to get any sort of a statement from the
younger one?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. She was unconscious last night, and this morning she
was too weak to talk. But the doctor&mdash;Von Blon&mdash;said we
could probably question her this afternoon. We may get something
out of her, in case she got a look at the bird before he shot
her."</p>

<p>"That suggests something to me, Sergeant." Vance had been
listening passively to the recital, but now he drew in his legs,
and lifted himself a little. "Did any member of the Greene
household possess a gun?"</p>

<p>Heath gave him a sharp look.</p>

<p>"This Chester Greene said he had an old .32 revolver he used to
keep in a desk drawer in his bedroom."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he, now? And did you see the gun?"</p>

<p>"I asked him for it, but he couldn't find it. Said he hadn't
seen it for years, but that probably it was around somewheres.
Promised to dig it up for me to-day."</p>

<p>"Don't hang any fond hopes on his finding it, Sergeant." Vance
looked at Markham musingly. "I begin to comprehend the basis of
Chester's psychic perturbation. I fear he's a crass materialist
after all...Sad, sad."</p>

<p>"You think he missed the gun, and took fright?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;something like that...perhaps. One can't tell. It's
deuced confusin'." He turned an indolent eye on the Sergeant. "By
the by, what sort of gun did your burglar use?"</p>

<p>Heath gave a gruff, uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"You score there, Mr. Vance. I've got both
bullets&mdash;thirty-two's, fired from a revolver, not an
automatic. But you're not trying to intimate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Sergeant. Like Goethe, I'm merely seeking for more
illumination, if one may translate <i>Licht</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Markham interrupted this garrulous evasion.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the Greene house after lunch, Sergeant. Can you
come along?"</p>

<p>"Sure I can, sir. I was going out anyway."</p>

<p>"Good." Markham brought forth a box of cigars. "Meet me here at
two... And take a couple of these <i>Perfectos</i> before you
go."</p>

<p>Heath selected the cigars, and put them carefully into his
breast pocket. At the door he turned with a bantering grin.</p>

<p>"You coming along with us, Mr. Vance&mdash;to guide our erring
footsteps, as they say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could keep me away," declared Vance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III - AT THE GREENE MANSION</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 2.30 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>THE Greene Mansion&mdash;as it was commonly referred to by New
Yorkers&mdash;was a relic of the city's <i>ancien regime</i>. It
had stood for three generations at the eastern extremity of 53rd
Street, two of its oriel windows actually overhanging the murky
waters of the East River. The lot upon which the house was built
extended through the entire block&mdash;a distance of two hundred
feet&mdash;and had an equal frontage on the cross-streets. The
character of the neighbourhood had changed radically since the
early days; but the spirit of commercial advancement had left the
domicile of the Greenes untouched. It was an oasis of idealism and
calm in the midst of moiling commercial enterprise; and one of the
stipulations in old Tobias Greene's last will and testament had
been that the mansion should stand intact for at least a quarter of
a century after his death, as a monument to him and his ancestors.
One of his last acts on earth was to erect a high stone wall about
the entire property, with a great double iron gateway opening on
53rd Street and a postern-gate for tradesmen giving on 52nd
Street.</p>

<p>The mansion itself was two and a half stories high, surmounted
by gabled spires and chimney clusters. It was what architects call,
with a certain intonation of contempt, a "ch&acirc;teau
flamboyant"; but no derogatory appellation could detract from the
quiet dignity and the air of feudal traditionalism that emanated
from its great rectangular blocks of grey limestone. The house was
sixteenth-century Gothic in style, with more than a suspicion of
the new Italian ornament in its parts; and the pinnacles and
shelves suggested the Byzantine, But for all its diversity of
detail, it was not flowery, and would have held no deep attraction
for the Freemason architects of the Middle Ages. It was not
"bookish" in effect; it exuded the very essence of the old.</p>

<p>In the front yard were maples and clipped evergreens,
interspersed with hydrangea and lilac bushes; and at the rear was a
row of weeping willows overhanging the river. Along the
herring-bone-bond brick walls were high quick-set hedges of
hawthorn; and the inner sides of the encircling wall were covered
with compact escaliers. To the west of the house an asphalt
driveway led to a double garage at the rear&mdash;an addition built
by the newer generation of Greenes. But here too were boxwood
hedgerows which cloaked the driveway's modernity.</p>

<p>As we entered the grounds that grey November afternoon an
atmosphere of foreboding bleakness seemed to have settled over the
estate. The trees and shrubs were all bare, except the evergreens,
which were laden with patches of snow. The trellises stood stripped
along the walls, like clinging black skeletons; and, save for the
front walk, which had been hastily and imperfectly swept, the
grounds were piled high with irregular snow-drifts. The grey of the
mansion's masonry was almost the colour of the brooding overcast
sky; and I felt a premonitory chill of eeriness pass over me as we
mounted the shallow steps that led to the high front door, with its
pointed pediment above the deeply arched entrance.</p>

<p>Sproot, the butler&mdash;a little old man with white hair and a
heavily seamed capriform face&mdash;admitted us with silent,
funereal dignity (he had evidently been apprised of our coming);
and we were ushered at once into the great gloomy drawing-room
whose heavily curtained windows overlooked the river. A few moments
later Chester Greene came in and greeted Markham fulsomely. Heath
and Vance and me he included in a single supercilious nod.</p>

<p>"Awfully good of you to come, Markham," he said, with nervous
eagerness, seating himself on the edge of a chair and taking out
his cigarette-holder. "I suppose you'll want to hold an inquisition
first. Whom'll I summon as a starter?"</p>

<p>"We can let that go for the moment," said Markham. "First, I'd
like to know something concerning the servants. Tell me what you
can about them."</p>

<p>Greene moved restlessly in his chair, and seemed to have
difficulty lighting his cigarette.</p>

<p>"There's only four. Big house and all that, but we don't need
much help. Julia always acted as housekeeper, and Ada looked after
the Mater.&mdash;To begin with, there's old Sproot. He's been
butler, seneschal, and major- domo for us for thirty years. Regular
family retainer&mdash;kind you read about in English
novels&mdash;devoted, loyal, humble, dictatorial, and snooping. And
a damned nuisance, I may add. Then there are two maids&mdash;one to
look after the rooms and the other for general service, though the
women monopolize her, mostly for useless fiddle-faddle. Hemming,
the older maid, has been with us ten years. Still wears corsets and
fit-easy shoes. Deep-water Baptist, I believe&mdash;excruciatingly
devout. Barton, the other maid, is young and flighty: thinks she's
irresistible, knows a little <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> French, and
is the kind that's constantly expecting the males of the family to
kiss her behind the door. Sibella picked her out&mdash;she's just
the kind Sibella would pick out. Been adorning our house and
shirking the hard work for about two years. The cook's a stodgy
German woman, a typical <i>Hausfrau</i>&mdash;voluminous bosoms and
number-ten feet. Puts in all her spare time writing to distant
nieces and nephews in the upper reaches of the Rhine basin
somewhere; and boasts that the most fastidious person could eat off
her kitchen floor, it's that clean; though I've never tried it. The
old man engaged her a year before he died; gave orders she was to
remain as long as she liked.&mdash;There you have the personnel of
the backstairs. Of course, there is a gardener who loafs about the
lawn in summer. He hibernates in a speak-easy up Harlem way."</p>

<p>"No chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"A nuisance we dispense with. Julia hated motorcars, and Rex is
afraid to travel in them&mdash;squeamish lad, Rex. I drive my own
racer, and Sibella's a regular Barney Oldfield. Ada drives, too,
when the Mater isn't using her and Sibella's car is idle.&mdash;So
endeth."</p>

<p>Markham had been making notes as Greene rambled along with his
information. At length he put out the cigar he had been
smoking.</p>

<p>"Now, if you don't mind, I want to look over the house."</p>

<p>Greene rose with alacrity and led the way into the main lower
hall&mdash;a vaulted, oak-panelled entrance containing two large
carved Flemish tables of the Sambin school, against opposite walls,
and several Anglo-Dutch crown-back chairs. A great Daghestan rug
stretched along the parqueted floor, its faded colours repeated in
the heavy draperies of the archways.</p>

<p>"We have, of course, just come from the drawing-room," explained
Greene, with a pompous air. "Back of it, down the hall"&mdash;he
pointed past the wide marble stairway&mdash;"was the governor's
library and den&mdash;what he called his <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>.
Nobody's been in it for twelve years. The Mater has kept it locked
up ever since the old man died. Sentiment of some kind; though I've
often told her she ought to clean the place out and make a
billiard-room of it. But you can't move the Mater, once she's got
an idea in her head. Try it some time when you're looking for heavy
exercise."</p>

<p>He walked across the hall and pulled aside the draperies of the
archway opposite to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Here's the reception-room, though we don't use it much
nowadays. Stuffy, silly place, and the flue doesn't draw worth a
damn. Every time we've built a fire here, we've had to have the
cleaners in to remove the soot from the tapestries." He waved his
cigarette-holder toward two beautiful Gobelins. "Back there,
through those sliding doors, is the dining-room; and farther on are
the butler's pantry and the kitchen where one may eat off the
floor. Care to inspect the culinary department?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," said Markham. "And I'll take the kitchen
floor for granted.&mdash;Now, can we look at the second floor?"</p>

<p>We ascended the main stairs, which led round a piece of marble
statuary&mdash;a Falgui&egrave;re figure, I think&mdash;and emerged
into the upper hall facing the front of the house where three large
close-set windows looked out over the bare trees.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the rooms on the second floor was simple and
in keeping with the broad four-square architecture of the house;
but for the sake of clarification I am embodying in this record a
rough diagram of it; for it was the disposition of these rooms that
made possible the carrying out of the murderer's hideous and
unnatural plot.</p>

<p><img align="left" alt="Diagram of second floor" src=
"0606351h-01.gif">
</p>

<p>There were six bedrooms on the floor&mdash;three on either side
of the hall, each occupied by a member of the family. At the front
of the house, on our left, was the bedroom of Rex Greene, the
younger brother. Next to it was the room occupied by Ada Greene;
and at the rear were Mrs. Greene's quarters, separated from Ada's
by a fair-sized dressing-room through which the two apartments
communicated. It will be seen from the diagram that Mrs. Greene's
room projected beyond the main western elevation of the house, and
that in the L thus formed was a small balustraded stone porch with
a narrow flight of stairs, set against the house, leading to the
lawn below. French doors opened upon this porch from both Ada's and
Mrs. Greene's rooms.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the hall were the three rooms occupied
by Julia, Chester, and Sibella, Julia's room being at the front of
the house, Sibella's at the rear, and Chester's in the centre. None
of these rooms communicated with the other. It might also be noted
that the doors to Sibella's and Mrs. Greene's rooms were just
behind the main staircase, whereas Chester's and Ada's were
directly at the head of the stairs, and Julia's and Rex's farther
toward the front of the house. There was a small linen closet
between Ada's room and Mrs. Greene's; and at the rear of the hall
were the servants' stairs.</p>

<p>Chester Greene explained this arrangement to us briefly, and
then walked up the hall to Julia's room.</p>

<p>"You'll want to look in here first, I imagine," he said,
throwing open the door. "Nothing's been touched&mdash;police
orders. But I can't see what good all that stained bed-linen is to
anyone. It's a frightful mess."</p>

<p>The room was large and richly furnished with sage-green
satin-upholstered furniture of the Marie Antoinette period.
Opposite to the door was a canopied bedstead on a dais; and several
dark blotches on the embroidered linen gave mute evidence of the
tragedy that had been enacted there the night before.</p>

<p>Vance, after noting the disposition of the furniture, turned his
gaze upon the old-fashioned crystal chandelier.</p>

<p>"Were those the lights that were on when you found your sister
last night, Mr. Greene?" he asked casually.</p>

<p>The other nodded with surly annoyance.</p>

<p>"And where, may I ask, is the switch?"</p>

<p>"Behind the end of that cabinet." Greene indifferently indicated
a highly elaborate <i>armoire</i> near the door.</p>

<p>"Invisible&mdash;eh, what?" Vance strolled to the <i>armoire</i>
and looked behind it. "An amazin' burglar!" Then he went up to
Markham and spoke to him in a low voice. After a moment Markham
nodded.</p>

<p>"Greene," he said, "I wish you'd go to your room and lie down on
the bed just as you were last night when you heard the shot. Then,
when I tap on the wall, get up and do everything you did last
night&mdash;in just the way you did it. I want to time you."</p>

<p>The man stiffened, and gave Markham a look of resentful
protestation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" he began. But almost at once he shrugged compliance
and swaggered from the room, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Vance took out his watch, and Markham, giving Greene time to
reach his room, rapped on the wall. For what seemed an interminable
time we waited. Then the door opened slightly, and Greene peered
round the casing. Slowly his eyes swept the room; he swung the door
farther ajar, stepped inside hesitantly, and moved to the bed.</p>

<p>"Three minutes and twenty seconds," announced Vance. "Most
disquietin'... What do you imagine, Sergeant, the intruder was
doing in the interim of the two shots?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" retorted Heath. "Probably groping round the
hall outside looking for the stairs."</p>

<p>"If he'd groped that length of time he'd have fallen down
'em."</p>

<p>Markham interrupted this discussion with a suggestion that we
take a look at the servants' stairway down which the butler had
come after hearing the first shot.</p>

<p>"We needn't inspect the other bedrooms just yet," he added,
"though we'll want to see Miss Ada's room as soon as the doctor
thinks it's advisable. When, by the way, will you know his
decision, Greene?"</p>

<p>"He said he'd be here at three. And he's a punctual
beggar&mdash;a regular fiend for efficiency. He sent a nurse over
early this morning, and she's looking after Ada and the Mater
now."</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Greene," interposed Vance, "was your sister Julia in
the habit of leaving her door unlocked at night?"</p>

<p>Greene's jaw dropped a little, and his eyes opened wider.</p>

<p>"By Jove&mdash;no! Now that you mention it ... she always locked
herself in."</p>

<p>Vance nodded absently, and we passed out into the hall. A thin,
swinging baize door hid the servants' stairwell at the rear, and
Markham pushed it open.</p>

<p>"Nothing much here to deaden the sound," he observed.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Greene. "And old Sproot's room is right at the head
of the steps. He's got good ears, too&mdash;too damned good
sometimes."</p>

<p>We were about to turn back, when a high-pitched querulous voice
issued from the partly open door on our right.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Chester? What's all this disturbance? Haven't I
had enough distraction and worry&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Greene had gone to his mother's door and put his head
inside.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mater," he said irritably. "It's only the
police nosing around."</p>

<p>"The police?" Her voice was contemptuous. "What do they want?
Didn't they upset me enough last night? Why don't they go and look
for the villain instead of congregating outside my door and
annoying me?&mdash;So, it's the police." Her tone became
vindictive. "Bring them in here at once, and let me talk to them.
The police, indeed!"</p>

<p>Greene looked helplessly at Markham, who merely nodded; and we
entered the invalid's room. It was a spacious chamber, with windows
on three sides, furnished elaborately with all manner of
conflicting objects. My first glance took in an East Indian rug, a
buhl cabinet, an enormous gilded Buddha, several massive Chinese
chairs of carved tak-wood, a faded Persian tapestry, two
wrought-iron standard lamps, and a red-and-gold lacquered high-boy.
I looked quickly at Vance, and surprised an expression of puzzled
interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>In an enormous bed, with neither head-piece nor foot-posts,
reclined the mistress of the house, propped up in a semi-recumbent
attitude on a sprawling pile of varicoloured silken pillows. She
must have been between sixty-five and seventy, but her hair was
almost black. Her long, chevaline face, though yellowed and
wrinkled like ancient parchment, still radiated an amazing vigour:
it reminded me of the portraits I had seen of George Eliot. About
her shoulders was drawn an embroidered Oriental shawl; and the
picture she presented in the setting of that unusual and
diversified room was exotic in the extreme. At her side sat a
rosy-cheeked imperturbable nurse in a stiff white uniform, making a
singular contrast to the woman on the bed.</p>

<p>Chester Greene presented Markham, and let his mother take the
rest of us for granted. At first she did not acknowledge the
introduction, but, after appraising Markham for a moment, she gave
him a nod of resentful forbearance and held out to him a long bony
hand.</p>

<p>"I suppose there's no way to avoid having my home overrun in
this fashion," she said wearily, assuming an air of great
toleration. "I was just endeavouring to get a little rest. My back
pains me so much to-day, after all the excitement last night. But
what do I matter&mdash;an old paralyzed woman like me? No one
considers me anyway, Mr. Markham. But they're perfectly right. We
invalids are of no use in the world, are we?"</p>

<p>Markham muttered some polite protestation, to which Mrs. Greene
paid not the slightest attention. She had turned, with seemingly
great difficulty, to the nurse.</p>

<p>"Fix my pillows, Miss Craven," she ordered impatiently, and then
added, in a whining tone: "Even you don't give a thought to my
comfort." The nurse complied without a word. "Now, you can go in
and sit with Ada until Doctor Von Blon comes&mdash;How is the dear
child?" Suddenly her voice had assumed a note of simulated
solicitude.</p>

<p>"She's much better, Mrs. Greene." The nurse spoke in a
colourless, matter-of-fact tone, and passed quietly into the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>The woman on the bed turned complaining eyes upon Markham.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible thing to be a cripple, unable to walk or even
stand alone. Both my legs have been hopelessly paralyzed for ten
years. Think of it, Mr. Markham: I've spent ten years in this bed
and that chair "&mdash;she pointed to an invalid's chair in the
alcove&mdash;"and I can't even move from one to the other unless
I'm lifted bodily. But I console myself with the thought that I'm
not long for this world; and I try to be patient. It wouldn't be so
bad, though, if my children were only more considerate. But I
suppose I expect too much. Youth and health give little thought to
the old and feeble&mdash;it's the way of the world. And so I make
the best of it. It's my fate to be a burden to every one."</p>

<p>She sighed and drew the shawl more closely about her.</p>

<p>"You want to ask me some questions perhaps? I don't see what I
can tell you that will be of any help, but I'm only too glad to do
whatever I can. I haven't slept a wink, and my back has been
paining me terribly as a result of all this commotion. But I'm not
complaining."</p>

<p>Markham had stood looking at the old lady sympathetically.
Indeed, she was a pitiful figure. Her long invalidism and solitude
had warped what had probably been a brilliant and generous mind:
and she had now become a kind of introspective martyr, with an
exaggerated sensitiveness to her affliction. I could see that
Markham's instinct was to leave her immediately with a few
consoling words; but his sense of duty directed him to remain and
learn what he could.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to annoy you any more than is absolutely
necessary, madam," he said in a kindly voice. "But it might help
considerably if you permitted me to put one or two questions."</p>

<p>"What's a little annoyance, more or less?" she asked. "I've long
since become used to it. Ask me anything you choose."</p>

<p>Markham bowed with Old World courtesy. "You are very kind,
madam." Then, after a moment's pause: "Mr. Greene tells me you did
not hear the shot that was fired in your oldest daughter's room,
but that the shot in Miss Ada's room awakened you."</p>

<p>"That is so." She nodded slowly. "Julia's room is a considerable
distance away&mdash;across the hall. But Ada always leaves the
doors open between her room and mine in case I should need anything
in the night. Naturally the shot in her room wakened me...Let me
see. I must have just fallen to sleep. My back was giving me a
great deal of trouble last night; I had suffered all day with it,
though I of course didn't tell any of the children about it. Little
they care how their paralyzed old mother suffers...And then, just
as I had managed to doze off, there came the report, and I was
wide-awake again&mdash;lying here helpless, unable to move, and
wondering what awful thing might be going to happen to me. And no
one came to see if I was all right; no one thought of me, alone and
defenceless. But then, no one ever thinks of me."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it wasn't any lack of consideration, Mrs. Greene,"
Markham assured her earnestly. "The situation probably drove
everything momentarily from their minds except the two victims of
the shooting.&mdash;Tell me this: did you hear any other sounds in
Miss Ada's room after the shot awakened you?"</p>

<p>"I heard the poor girl fall&mdash;at least, it sounded like
that."</p>

<p>"But no other noises of any kind? No footsteps, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"Footsteps?" She seemed to make an effort to recall her
impressions. "No; no footsteps."</p>

<p>"Did you hear the door into the hall open or close, madam?" It
was Vance who put the question.</p>

<p>The woman turned her eyes sharply and glared at him. "No, I
heard no door open or close."</p>

<p>"That's rather queer, too, don't you think?" pursued Vance. "The
intruder must have left the room."</p>

<p>"I suppose he must have, if he's not there now," she replied
acidly, turning again to the District Attorney. "Is there anything
else you'd care to know?"</p>

<p>Markham evidently had perceived the impossibility of eliciting
any vital information from her.</p>

<p>"I think not," he answered; then added: "You of course heard the
butler and your son here enter Miss Ada's room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. They made enough noise doing it&mdash;they didn't
consider my feelings in the least. That fuss-budget, Sproot,
actually cried out for Chester like a hysterical woman; and, from
the way he raised his voice over the telephone, one would have
thought Doctor Von Blon was deaf. Then Chester had to rouse the
whole house for some unknown reason. Oh, there was no peace or rest
for me last night, I can tell you! And the police tramped around
the house for hours like a drove of wild cattle. It was positively
disgraceful. And here was I&mdash;a helpless old
woman&mdash;entirely neglected and forgotten, suffering agonies
with my spine."</p>

<p>After a few commiserating banalities Markham thanked her for her
assistance, and withdrew. As we passed out and walked toward the
stairs I could hear her calling out angrily: "Nurse! Nurse! Can't
you hear me? Come at once and arrange my pillows. What do you mean
by neglecting me this way...?" The voice trailed off mercifully as
we descended to the main hall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - THE MISSING REVOLVER</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 3 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>"THE Mater's a crabbed old soul," Greene apologized off-handedly
when we were again in the drawing-room. "Always grousing about her
doting offspring.&mdash;Well, where do we go from here?"</p>

<p>Markham seemed lost in thought, and it was Vance who
answered.</p>

<p>"Let us take a peep at the servants and hearken to their tale:
Sproot for a starter."</p>

<p>Markham roused himself and nodded, and Greene rose and pulled a
silken bell-cord near the archway. A minute later the butler
appeared and stood at obsequious attention just inside the room.
Markham had appeared somewhat at sea and even disinterested during
the investigation, and Vance assumed command.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Sproot, and tell us as briefly as possible just what
occurred last night."</p>

<p>Sproot came forward slowly, his eyes on the floor, but remained
standing before the centre-table.</p>

<p>"I was reading Martial, sir, in my room," he began, lifting his
gaze submissively, "when I thought I heard a muffled shot. I wasn't
quite sure, for the automobiles in the street back-fire quite loud
at times; but at last I said to myself I'd better investigate. I
was in <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>, if you understand what I mean,
sir; so I slipped on my bath-robe and came down. I didn't know just
where the noise had come from; but when I was half-way down the
steps I heard another shot, and this time it sounded like it came
from Miss Ada's room. So I went there at once, and tried the door.
It was unlocked, and when I looked in I saw Miss Ada lying on the
floor&mdash;a very distressing sight, sir. I called to Mr. Chester,
and we lifted the poor young lady to the bed. Then I telephoned to
Doctor Von Blon."</p>

<p>Vance scrutinized him.</p>

<p>"You were very courageous, Sproot, to brave a dark hall looking
for the source of a shot in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," the man answered, with great humility. "I
always try to do my duty by the Greene family. I've been with
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know all that, Sproot." Vance cut him short. "The light was
on in Miss Ada's room, I understand, when you opened the door."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you saw no one, or heard no noise? No door closing, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And yet the person who fired the shot must have been somewhere
in the hall at the same time you were there."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, sir."</p>

<p>"And he might well have taken a shot at you, too."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir." Sproot seemed wholly indifferent to the danger
he had escaped. "But what will be, will be, sir&mdash;if you'll
pardon my saying so. And I'm an old man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! You'll probably live a considerable time
yet&mdash;just how long I can't, of course, say."</p>

<p>"No, sir." Sproot's eyes gazed blankly ahead. "No one
understands the mysteries of life and death."</p>

<p>"You're somewhat philosophic, I see," dryly commented Vance.
Then: "When you phoned to Doctor Von Blon, was he in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but the night nurse told me he'd be back any minute,
and that she'd send him over. He arrived in less than half an
hour."</p>

<p>Vance nodded. "That will be all, thank you, Sproot.&mdash;And
now please send me <i>die gn&auml;dige Frau K&ouml;chin</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." And the old butler shuffled from the room. Vance's
eyes followed him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"An inveiglin' character," he murmured.</p>

<p>Greene snorted. "<i>You</i> don't have to live with him. He'd
have said 'Yes, sir,' if you'd spoken to him in Walloon or Volapuk.
A sweet little playmate to have snooping round the house
twenty-four hours a day!"</p>

<p>The cook, a portly, phlegmatic German woman of about forty-five,
named Gertrude Mannheim, came in and seated herself on the edge of
a chair near the entrance. Vance, after a moment's keen inspection
of her, asked:</p>

<p>"Were you born in this country, Frau Mannheim?"</p>

<p>"I was born in Baden," she answered, in flat, rather guttural
tones. "I came to America when I was twelve."</p>

<p>"You have not always been a cook, I take it." Vance's voice had
a slightly different intonation from that which he had used with
Sproot.</p>

<p>At first the woman did not answer.</p>

<p>"No, sir," she said finally. "Only since the death of my
husband."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come to the Greenes?"</p>

<p>Again she hesitated. "I had met Mr. Tobias Greene: he knew my
husband. When my husband died there wasn't any money. And I
remembered Mr. Greene, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand." Vance paused, his eyes in space. "You heard
nothing of what happened here last night?</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not until Mr. Chester called up the stairs and said
for us to get dressed and come down."</p>

<p>Vance rose and turned to the window overlooking the East
River.</p>

<p>"That's all, Frau Mannheim. Be as good as to tell the senior
maid&mdash; Hemming, isn't she?&mdash;to come here."</p>

<p>Without a word the cook left us, and her place was presently
taken by a tall, slatternly woman, with a sharp, prudish face and
severely combed hair. She wore a black, one-piece dress, and
heelless vici-kid shoes; and her severity of mien was emphasized by
a pair of thick-lensed spectacles.</p>

<p>"I understand, Hemming," began Vance, reseating himself before
the fire- place, "that you heard neither shot last night, and
learned of the tragedy only when called by Mr. Greene."</p>

<p>The woman nodded with a jerky, emphatic movement.</p>

<p>"I was spared," she said, in a rasping voice. "But the tragedy,
as you call it, had to come sooner or later. It was an act of God,
if you ask <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, we're not asking you, Hemming; but we're delighted to
have your opinion.&mdash;So God had a hand in the shooting,
eh?"</p>

<p>"He did that" The woman spoke with religious fervour. "The
Greenes are an ungodly, wicked family." She leered defiantly at
Chester Greene, who laughed uneasily. "'For I shall rise up against
them, saith the Lord of hosts&mdash;the name, the remnant, and son,
and daughter, and nephew'&mdash;only there ain't no
nephew&mdash;'and I will sweep them with the besom of destruction,
saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Vance regarded her musingly.</p>

<p>"I see you have misread Isaiah. And have you any celestial
information as to who was chosen by the Lord to personify the
besom?"</p>

<p>The woman compressed her lips. "Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Who, indeed? ...But to descend to temporal things: I assume
you weren't surprised at what happened last night?"</p>

<p>"I'm never surprised at the mysterious workin's of the
Almighty."</p>

<p>Vance sighed. "You may return to your Scriptural perusings,
Hemming. Only, I wish you'd pause <i>en route</i> and tell Barton
we crave her presence here."</p>

<p>The woman rose stiffly and passed from the room like an animated
ramrod.</p>

<p>Barton came in, obviously frightened. But her fear was
insufficient to banish completely her instinctive coquetry. A
certain coyness showed through the alarmed glance she gave us, and
one hand automatically smoothed back the chestnut hair over her
ear. Vance adjusted his monocle.</p>

<p>"You really should wear Alice blue, Barton," he advised her
seriously. "Much more becoming than cerise to your olive
complexion."</p>

<p>The girl's apprehensiveness relaxed, and she gave Vance a
puzzled, kittenish look.</p>

<p>"But what I particularly wanted you to come here for," he went
on, "was to ask you if Mr. Greene has ever kissed you."</p>

<p>"Which&mdash;Mr. Greene?" she stammered, completely
disconcerted.</p>

<p>Chester had, at Vance's question, jerked himself erect in his
chair and started to splutter an irate objection. But articulation
failed him, and he turned to Markham with speechless
indignation.</p>

<p>The corners of Vance's mouth twitched. "It really doesn't
matter, Barton," he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to ask me any questions about&mdash;what
happened last night?" the girl asked, with obvious
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Oh! Do you know anything about what happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," she admitted. "I was asleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Therefore, I shan't bother you with questions." He
dismissed her good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Markham, I protest!" cried Greene, when Barton had
left us. "I call this&mdash;this gentleman's levity rotten-bad
taste&mdash;damme if I don't!"</p>

<p>Markham, too, was annoyed at the frivolous line of interrogation
Vance had taken.</p>

<p>"I can't see what's to be gained by such futile inquiries," he
said, striving to control his irritation.</p>

<p>"That's because you're still holding to the burglar theory,"
Vance replied. "But if, as Mr. Greene thinks, there is another
explanation of last night's crime, then it's essential to acquaint
ourselves with the conditions existing here. And it's equally
essential not to rouse the suspicions of the servants. Hence my
apparent irrelevancies. I'm trying to size up the various human
actors we have to deal with; and I think I've done uncommonly well.
Several rather interesting possibilities have developed."</p>

<p>Before Markham could reply Sproot passed the archway and opened
the front door to someone whom he greeted respectfully. Greene
immediately went into the hall.</p>

<p>"Hallo, doc," we heard him say. "Thought you'd be along pretty
soon. The District Attorney and his <i>entourage</i> are here, and
they'd like to talk to Ada. I told 'em you said it might be all
right this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'll know better when I've seen Ada," the doctor replied. He
passed on hurriedly, and we heard him ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>"It's Von Blon," announced Greene, returning to the
drawing-room. "He'll let us know anon how Ada's coming along."
There was a callous note in his voice, which, at the time, puzzled
me.</p>

<p>"How long have you known Doctor Von Blon?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"How long?" Greene looked surprised. "Why, all my life. Went to
the old Beekman Public School with him. His father&mdash;old Doctor
Veranus Von Blon&mdash;brought all the later Greenes into the
world; family physician, spiritual adviser, and all that sort of
thing, from time immemorial. When Von Blon senior died we embraced
the son as a matter of course. And young Arthur's a shrewd lad,
too. Knows his pharmacopoeia. Trained by the old man, and topped
off his medical education in Germany."</p>

<p>Vance nodded negligently.</p>

<p>"While we're waiting for Doctor Von Blon, suppose we have a chat
with Miss Sibella and Mr. Rex. Your brother first, let us say."</p>

<p>Greene looked to Markham for confirmation; then rang for
Sproot.</p>

<p>Rex Greene came immediately upon being summoned.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want now?" he asked, scanning our faces with
nervous intensity. His voice was peevish, almost whining, and there
were certain overtones in it which recalled the fretful complaining
voice of Mrs. Greene.</p>

<p>"We merely want to question you about last night," answered
Vance soothingly. "We thought it possible you could help us."</p>

<p>"What help can I give you?" Rex asked sullenly, slumping into a
chair. He gave his brother a sneering look. "Chester's the only one
round here who seems to have been awake."</p>

<p>Rex Greene was a short, sallow youth with narrow, stooping
shoulders and an abnormally large head set on a neck which appeared
almost emaciated. A shock of straight hair hung down over his
bulging forehead, and he had a habit of tossing it back with a
jerky movement of the head. His small, shifty eyes, shielded by
enormous tortoise-rimmed glasses, seemed never to be at rest; and
his thin lips were constantly twitching as with a <i>tic
douloureux</i>. His chin was small and pointed, and he held it
drawn in, emphasizing its lack of prominence. He was not a pleasant
spectacle, and yet there was something in the man&mdash;an
overdeveloped studiousness, perhaps&mdash;that gave the impression
of unusual potentialities. I once saw a juvenile chess wizard who
had the same cranial formations and general facial cast.</p>

<p>Vance appeared introspective, but I knew he was absorbing every
detail of the man's appearance. At length he laid down his
cigarette, and focused his eyes languidly on the desk-lamp.</p>

<p>"You say you slept throughout the tragedy last night. How do you
account for that remarkable fact, inasmuch as one of the shots was
fired in the room next to yours?"</p>

<p>Rex hitched himself forward to the edge of his chair, and turned
his head from side to side, carefully avoiding our eyes.</p>

<p>"I haven't tried to account for it," he returned, with angry
resentment; but withal he seemed unstrung and on the defensive.
Then he hurried on: "The walls in this house are pretty thick
anyway, and there are always noises in the street...Maybe my head
was buried under the covers."</p>

<p>"You'd certainly have buried your head under the covers if you'd
heard the shot," commented Chester, with no attempt to disguise his
contempt for his brother.</p>

<p>Rex swung round, and would have retorted to the accusation had
not Vance put his next question immediately.</p>

<p>"What's your theory of the crime, Mr. Greene? You've heard all
the details and you know the situation."</p>

<p>"I thought the police had settled on a burglar." The youth's
eyes rested shrewdly on Heath. "Wasn't that your conclusion?"</p>

<p>"It was, and it is," declared the Sergeant, who, until now, had
preserved a bored silence. "But your brother here seems to think
otherwise."</p>

<p>"So Chester thinks otherwise." Rex turned to his brother with an
expression of feline dislike. "Maybe Chester knows all about it."
There was no mistaking the implication in his words.</p>

<p>Vance once more stepped into the breach.</p>

<p>"Your brother has told us all he knows. Just at present we're
concerned with how much you know." The severity of his manner
caused Rex to shrink back in his chair. His lips twitched more
violently, and he began fidgeting with the braided frog of his
smoking-jacket. I noticed then for the first time that he had short
rachitic hands with bowed and thickened phalanges.</p>

<p>"You are sure you heard no shot?" continued Vance ominously.</p>

<p>"I've told you a dozen times I didn't!" His voice rose to a
falsetto, and he gripped the arms of his chair with both hands.</p>

<p>"Keep calm, Rex," admonished Chester. "You'll be having another
of your spells."</p>

<p>"To hell with you," the youth shouted. "How many times have I
got to tell them I don't know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"We merely want to make doubly sure on all points," Vance told
him pacifyingly. "And you certainly wouldn't want your sister's
death to go unavenged through any lack of perseverance on our
part."</p>

<p>Rex relaxed slightly, and took a deep inspiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd tell you anything I knew," he said, running his tongue
over his dry lips. "But I always get blamed for everything that
happens in this house&mdash;that is, Ada and I do. And as for
avenging Julia's death: that doesn't appeal to me nearly so much as
punishing the dog that shot Ada. She has a hard enough time of it
here under normal conditions. Mother keeps her in the house waiting
on her as if she were a servant."</p>

<p>Vance nodded understandingly. Then he rose and placed his hand
sympathetically on Rex's shoulder. This gesture was so unlike him I
was completely astonished; for, despite his deep-seated humanism,
Vance seemed always ashamed of any outward show of feeling, and
sought constantly to repress his emotions.</p>

<p>"Don't let this tragedy upset you too much, Mr. Greene," he said
reassuringly. "And you may be certain that we'll do everything in
our power to find and punish the person who shot Miss Ada.&mdash;We
won't bother you any more now."</p>

<p>Rex got up almost eagerly and drew himself together.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right." And with a covertly triumphant glance at
his brother, he left the room.</p>

<p>"Rex is a queer bird," Chester remarked, after a short silence.
"He spends most of his time reading and working out abstruse
problems in mathematics and astronomy. Wanted to stick a telescope
through the attic roof, but the Mater drew the line. He's an
unhealthy beggar, too. I tell him he doesn't get enough fresh air,
but you see his attitude toward me. Thinks I'm weak-minded because
I play golf."</p>

<p>"What were the spells you spoke about?" asked Vance. "Your
brother looks as if he might be epileptic."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; nothing like that; though I've seen him have convulsive
seizures when he got in a specially violent tantrum. He gets
excited easily and flies off the handle. Von Blon says it's
hyperneurasthenia&mdash;whatever that is. He goes ghastly pale when
he's worked up, and has a kind of trembling fit. Says things he's
sorry for afterward. Nothing serious, though. What he needs is
exercise&mdash;a year on a ranch roughing it, without his infernal
books and compasses and T-squares."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's more or less a favourite with your mother."
(Vance's remark recalled a curious similarity of temperament
between the two I had felt vaguely as Rex talked.)</p>

<p>"More or less." Chester nodded ponderously. "He's the pet in so
far as the Mater's capable of petting anyone but herself. Anyway,
she's never ragged Rex as much as the rest of us."</p>

<p>Again Vance went to the great window above the East River, and
stood looking out. Suddenly he turned.</p>

<p>"By the by, Mr. Greene, did you find your revolver?" His tone
had changed; his ruminative mood had gone.</p>

<p>Chester gave a start, and cast a swift glance at Heath, who had
now become attentive.</p>

<p>"No, by Gad, I haven't," he admitted, fumbling in his pocket for
his cigarette-holder. "Funny thing about that gun, too. Always kept
it in my desk drawer&mdash;though, as I told this gentleman when he
mentioned it"&mdash;he pointed his holder at Heath as if the other
had been an inanimate object&mdash; "I don't remember actually
having seen it for years. But, even so, where the devil could it
have gone? Damme, it's mysterious. Nobody round here would touch
it. The maids don't go in the drawers when they're cleaning the
room&mdash;I'm lucky if they make the bed and dust the top of the
furniture. Damned funny what became of it."</p>

<p>"Did you take a good look for it to-day, like you said?" asked
Heath, thrusting his head forward belligerently. Why, since he held
to the burglar theory, he should assume a bulldozing manner, I
couldn't imagine. But whenever Heath was troubled, he was
aggressive; and any loose end in an investigation troubled him
deeply.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I looked for it," Chester replied, haughtily
indignant. "I went through every room and closet and drawer in the
house. But it's completely disappeared...Probably got thrown out by
mistake in one of the annual house-cleanings."</p>

<p>"That's possible," agreed Vance. "What sort of a revolver was
it?"</p>

<p>"An old Smith and Wesson .32," Chester appeared to be trying to
refresh his memory. "Mother-of-pearl handle: some scroll-engraving
on the barrel&mdash;I don't recall exactly. I bought it fifteen
years ago&mdash;maybe longer&mdash; when I went camping one summer
in the Adirondacks. Used it for target practice. Then I got tired
of it, and stuck it away in a drawer behind a lot of old cancelled
cheques."</p>

<p>"Was it in good working order then?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know. Fact is, it worked stiff when I got it, and
had the sear filed down, so it was practically a hair-trigger
affair. The slightest touch sent it off. Better for shooting
targets that way."</p>

<p>"Do you recall if it was loaded when you put it away?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say. Might have been. It's been so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were there any cartridges for it in your desk?"</p>

<p>"Now, that I can answer you positively. There wasn't a loose
cartridge in the place."</p>

<p>Vance reseated himself.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Greene, if you happen to run across the revolver you
will, of course, let Mr. Markham or Sergeant Heath know."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. With pleasure." Chester's assurance was
expressed with an air of magnanimity.</p>

<p>Vance glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"And now, seeing that Doctor Von Blon is still with his patient,
I wonder if we could see Miss Sibella for a moment."</p>

<p>Chester got up, obviously relieved that the subject of the
revolver had been disposed of, and went to the bell-cord beside the
archway. But he arrested his hand in the act of reaching for
it.</p>

<p>"I'll fetch her myself," he said, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Markham turned to Vance with a smile.</p>

<p>"Your prophecy about the non-reappearance of the gun has, I
note, been temporarily verified."</p>

<p>"And I'm afraid that fancy weapon with the hair-trigger never
will appear&mdash;at least, not until this miserable business is
cleaned up." Vance was unwontedly sober; his customary levity had
for the moment deserted him. But before long he lifted his eyebrows
mockingly, and gave Heath a chaffing look.</p>

<p>"Perchance the sergeant's predacious neophyte made off with the
revolver&mdash;became fascinated with the scrollwork, or entranced
with the pearl handle."</p>

<p>"It's quite possible the revolver disappeared in the way Greene
said it did," Markham submitted. "In any event, I think you unduly
emphasized the matter."</p>

<p>"Sure he did, Mr. Markham," growled Heath. "And, what's more, I
can't see that all this repartee with the family is getting us
anywheres. I had 'em all on the carpet last night when the shooting
was hot; and I'm telling you they don't know nothing about it. This
Ada Greene is the only person round here I want to talk to. There's
a chance she can give us a tip. If her lights were on when the
burglar got in her room, she maybe got a good look at him."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Vance, shaking his head sadly, "you're getting
positively morbid on the subject of that mythical burglar."</p>

<p>Markham inspected the end of his cigar thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No, Vance. I'm inclined to agree with the sergeant. It appears
to me that you're the one with the morbid imagination. I let you
inveigle me into this inquiry too easily. That's why I've kept in
the background and left the floor to you. Ada Greene's our only
hope of help here."</p>

<p>"Oh, for your trusting, forthright mind!" Vance sighed and
shifted his position restlessly. "I say, our psychic Chester is
taking a dashed long time to fetch Sibella."</p>

<p>At that moment there came a sound of footsteps on the marble
stairs, and a few seconds later Sibella Greene, accompanied by
Chester, appeared in the archway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V - HOMICIDAL POSSIBILITIES</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 3.30 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>SIBELLA entered with a firm, swinging gait, her head held high,
her eyes sweeping the assemblage with bold interrogation. She was
tall and of slender, athletic build, and, though she was not
pretty, there was a cold, chiselled attractiveness in her
lineaments that held one's attention. Her face was at once vivid
and intense; and there was a hauteur in her expression amounting
almost to arrogance. Her dark, crisp hair was bobbed but not waved,
and the severity of its lines accentuated the over-decisive cast of
her features. Her hazel eyes were wide-spaced beneath heavy, almost
horizontal eyebrows; her nose was straight and slightly prominent,
and her mouth was large and firm, with a suggestion of cruelty in
its thin lips. She was dressed simply, in a dark sport suit cut
extremely short, silk-wool stockings of a heather mixture, and low-
heeled mannish Oxfords.</p>

<p>Chester presented the District Attorney to her as an old
acquaintance, and permitted Markham to make the other
introductions.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know, Mr. Markham, why Chet likes you," she said,
in a peculiarly plangent voice. "You're one of the few persons at
the Marylebone Club that he can beat at golf."</p>

<p>She seated herself before the centre-table, and crossed her
knees comfortably.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd get me a cigarette, Chet." Her tone made the
request an imperative.</p>

<p>Vance rose at once and held out his case.</p>

<p>"Do try one of these <i>R&eacute;gies</i>, Miss Greene," he
urged in his best drawing-room manner. "If you say you don't like
them, I shall immediately change my brand."</p>

<p>"Rash man!" Sibella took a cigarette and permitted Vance to
light it for her. Then she settled back in her chair and gave
Markham a quizzical look. "Quite a wild party we pulled here last
night, wasn't it? We've never had so much commotion in the old
mansion. And it was just my luck to sleep soundly through it all."
She made an aggrieved <i>moue</i>. "Chet didn't call me till it was
all over. Just like him&mdash;he has a nasty disposition."</p>

<p>Somehow her flippancy did not shock me as it might have done in
a different type of person. But Sibella struck me as a girl who,
though she might feel things keenly, would not permit any
misfortune to get the better of her; and I put her apparent
callousness down to a dogged, if perverted, courageousness.</p>

<p>Markham, however, resented her attitude.</p>

<p>"One cannot blame Mr. Greene for not taking the matter lightly,"
he reproved her. "The brutal murder of a defenceless woman and the
attempted murder of a young girl hardly come under the head of
diversion."</p>

<p>Sibella looked at him reproachfully. "You know, Mr. Markham, you
sound exactly like the Mother Superior of the stuffy convent I was
confined in for two years." She became suddenly grave. "Why draw a
long face over something that's happened and can't be helped?
Anyway, Julia never sought to brighten her little corner. She was
always crabbed and fault-finding, and her good deeds wouldn't fill
a book. It may be unsisterly to say it, but she's not going to be
missed so dreadfully. Chet and I are certainly not going to pine
away."</p>

<p>"And what about the brutal shooting of your other sister?"
Markham was with difficulty controlling his indignation.</p>

<p>Sibella's eyelids narrowed perceptibly, and the lines of her
face became set. But she erased the expression almost at once.</p>

<p>"Well, Ada's going to recover, isn't she?" Despite her effort,
she was unable to keep a certain hardness out of her voice. "She'll
have a nice long rest, and a nurse to wait on her. Am I expected to
weep copiously because of baby sister's escape?"</p>

<p>Vance, who had been closely watching this clash between Sibella
and Markham, now took a hand in the conversation.</p>

<p>"My dear Markham, I can't see what Miss Greene's sentiments have
to do with the matter. Her attitude may not be strictly in accord
with the prescribed conduct for young ladies on such occasions, but
I feel sure she has excellent reasons for her point of view. Let us
give over moralizing, and seek Miss Greene's assistance
instead."</p>

<p>The girl darted him an amused, appreciative glance; and Markham
made a gesture of indifferent acquiescence. It was plain that he
regarded the present inquiry as of little importance.</p>

<p>Vance gave the girl an engaging smile.</p>

<p>"It's really my fault, Miss Greene, that we are intruding here,"
he apologized. "It was I, d'ye see, that urged Mr. Markham to look
into the case after your brother had expressed his disbelief in the
burglar theory."</p>

<p>She nodded understandingly. "Oh, Chet sometimes has excellent
hunches. It's one of his very few merits."</p>

<p>"You, too, I gather, are sceptical in regard to the
burglar?"</p>

<p>"Sceptical?" She gave a short laugh. "I'm downright suspicious.
I don't know any burglars, though I'd dearly love to meet one; but
I simply can't bring my flighty brain to picture them going about
their fascinating occupation the way our little entertainer did
last night."</p>

<p>"You positively thrill me," declared Vance. "Y' see, our
minority ideas coincide perfectly."</p>

<p>"Did Chet give you any intelligible explanation for his
opinion?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not. He was inclined to lay his feelings to
metaphysical causes. His conviction was due, I took it, to some
kind of psychic visitation. He knew, but could not explain: he was
sure, but had no proof. It was most indefinite&mdash;a bit
esoteric, in fact."</p>

<p>"I'd never suspect Chet of spiritualistic leanings." She shot
her brother a tantalizing look. "He's really deadly commonplace,
when you get to know him."</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it, Sib," objected Chester irritably. "You yourself had
a spasm this morning when I told you the police were hot-footing it
after a burglar."</p>

<p>Sibella made no answer. With a slight toss of the head she
leaned over and threw her cigarette into the grate.</p>

<p>"By the by, Miss Greene"&mdash;Vance spoke casually&mdash;"there
has been considerable mystery about the disappearance of your
brother's revolver. It has completely vanished from his desk
drawer. I wonder if you have seen it about the house anywhere."</p>

<p>At his mention of the gun Sibella stiffened slightly. Her eyes
took on an expression of intentness, and the corners of her mouth
lifted into a faintly ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Chet's revolver has gone, has it?" She put the question
colourlessly, as if her thoughts were elsewhere. "No...I haven't
seen it." Then, after a momentary pause: "But it was in Chet's desk
last week."</p>

<p>Chester heaved himself forward angrily.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in my desk last week?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't wax apoplectic," the girl said carelessly. "I wasn't
looking for love missives. I simply couldn't imagine you in love,
Chet..." The idea seemed to amuse her. "I was only looking for that
old emerald stick-pin you borrowed and never returned."</p>

<p>"It's at the club," he explained sulkily.</p>

<p>"Is it, really! Well, I didn't find it, anyway; but I did see
the revolver.&mdash;Are you quite sure it's gone?"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd," the man growled. "I've searched everywhere
for it...Including your room," he added vengefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would! But why did you admit having it in the first
place?" Her tone was scornful. "Why involve yourself
unnecessarily?"</p>

<p>Chester shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>"This gentleman"&mdash;he again pointed impersonally to
Heath&mdash;"asked me if I owned a revolver, and I told him 'yes.'
If I hadn't, some of the servants or one of my loving family would
have told him. And I thought the truth was best."</p>

<p>Sibella smiled satirically.</p>

<p>"My older brother, you observe, is a model of all the
old-fashioned virtues," she remarked to Vance. But she was
obviously <i>distraite</i>. The revolver episode had somewhat
shaken her self-assurance.</p>

<p>"You say, Miss Greene, that the burglar idea does not appeal to
you." Vance was smoking languidly with half-closed eyes. "Can you
think of any other explanation for the tragedy?"</p>

<p>The girl raised her head and regarded him calculatingly.</p>

<p>"Because I don't happen to believe in burglars that shoot women
and sneak away without taking anything, it doesn't mean that I can
suggest alternatives. I'm not a policewoman&mdash;though I've often
thought it would be jolly good sport&mdash;and I had a vague idea
it was the business of the police to run down criminals. You don't
believe in the burglar either, Mr. Vance, or you wouldn't have
followed up Chet's hunch. Who do you think ran amuck here last
night?"</p>

<p>"My dear girl!" Vance raised a protesting hand. "If I had the
foggiest idea I wouldn't be annoying you with impertinent
questions. I'm plodding with leaden feet in a veritable bog of
ignorance."</p>

<p>He spoke negligently, but Sibella's eyes were clouded with
suspicion. Presently, however, she laughed gaily and held out her
hand.</p>

<p>"Another <i>R&eacute;gie, monsieur</i>. I was on the verge of
becoming serious; and I simply mustn't become serious. It's so
frightfully boring. Besides, it gives one wrinkles. And I'm much
too young for wrinkles."</p>

<p>"Like Ninon de L'Enclos, you'll always be too young for
wrinkles," rejoined Vance, holding a match to her cigarette. "But
perhaps you can suggest, without becoming too serious, someone who
might have had a reason for wanting to kill your two sisters."</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that, I'd say we'd all come under suspicion. We're
not an ideal home circle, by any means. In fact, the Greenes are a
queer collection. We don't love one another the way a perfectly
nice and proper family should. We're always at each other's
throats, bickering and fighting about something or other. It's
rather a mess&mdash;this menage. It's a wonder to me murder hasn't
been done long before. And we've all got to live here until 1932,
or go it on our own; and, of course, none of us could make a decent
living. A sweet paternal heritage"* (*Sibella was here referring to
Tobias Greene's will, which stipulated not only that the Greene
mansion should be maintained intact for twenty-five years, but that
the legatees should live on the estate during that time or become
disinherited.)</p>

<p>She smoked moodily for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes, any one of us had ample reason to be murderously inclined
toward all the others. Chet there would strangle me now if he
didn't think the nervous aftermath of the act would spoil his
golf&mdash;wouldn't you, Chet dear? Rex regards us all as
inferiors, and probably considers himself highly indulgent and
altruistic not to have murdered us all long ago. And the only
reason mother hasn't killed us is that she's paralyzed and can't
manage it. Julia, too, for that matter, could have seen us all
boiled in oil without turning a hair. And as for Ada"&mdash;her
brows contracted and an extraordinary ferocity crept into her
eyes&mdash;"she'd dearly love to see us all exterminated. She's not
really one of us, and she hates us. Nor would I myself have any
scruples about doing away with the rest of my fond family. I've
thought of it often, but I could never decide on a nice thorough
method." She flicked her cigarette ash on the floor. "So there you
are. If you're looking for possibilities you have them galore.
There's no one under this ancestral roof who couldn't qualify."</p>

<p>Though her words were meant to be satirical, I could not help
feeling that a sombre, terrible truth underlay them. Vance, though
apparently listening with amusement, had, I knew, been absorbing
every inflection of her voice and play of expression, in an effort
to relate the details of her sweeping indictment to the problem in
hand.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he remarked off-handedly, "you are an amazingly
frank young woman. However, I shan't recommend your arrest just
yet. I haven't a particle of evidence against you, don't y' know.
Annoyin', ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," sighed the girl, in mock disappointment, "you may
pick up a clue later on. There'll probably be another death or two
around here before long. I'd hate to think the murderer would give
up the job with so little really accomplished."</p>

<p>At this point Doctor Von Blon entered the drawing-room. Chester
rose to greet him, and the formalities of introduction were quickly
over. Von Blon bowed with reserved cordiality; but I noted that his
manner to Sibella, while pleasant, was casual in the extreme. I
wondered a little about this, but I recalled that he was an old
friend of the family and probably took many of the social amenities
for granted.</p>

<p>"What have you to report, doctor?" asked Markham. "Will we be
able to question the young lady this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think there'd be any harm in it," Von Blon returned,
seating himself beside Chester. "Ada has only a little reaction
fever now, though she's suffering from shock, and is pretty weak
from loss of blood."</p>

<p>Doctor Von Blon was a suave, smooth-faced man of forty, with
small, almost feminine features and an air of unwavering
amiability. His urbanity struck me as too
artificial&mdash;"professional" is perhaps the word&mdash;and there
was something of the ambitious egoist about him. But I was far more
attracted than repelled by him.</p>

<p>Vance watched him attentively as he spoke. He was more anxious
even than Heath, I think, to question the girl.</p>

<p>"It was not a particularly serious wound, then?" Markham
asked.</p>

<p>"No, not serious," the doctor assured him; "though it barely
missed being fatal. Had the shot gone an inch deeper it would have
torn across the lung. It was a very narrow escape."</p>

<p>"As I understand it," interposed Vance, "the bullet travelled
transversely over the left scapular region."</p>

<p>Von Blon inclined his head in agreement.</p>

<p>"The shot was obviously aimed at the heart from the rear," he
explained, in his soft, modulated voice. "But Ada must have turned
slightly to the right just as the revolver exploded; and the
bullet, instead of going directly into her body, ploughed along the
shoulder-blade at the level of the third dorsal vertebra, tore the
capsular ligament, and lodged in the deltoid." He indicated the
location of the deltoid on his own left arm.</p>

<p>"She had," suggested Vance, "apparently turned her back on her
assailant and attempted to run away; and he had followed her and
placed the revolver almost against her back.&mdash;Is that your
interpretation of it, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that would seem to be the situation. And, as I said, at
the crucial moment she veered a little, and thus saved her
life."</p>

<p>"Would she have fallen immediately to the floor, despite the
actual superficiality of the wound?"</p>

<p>"It's not unlikely. Not only would the pain have been
considerable, but the shock must be taken into account.
Ada&mdash;or, for that matter, any woman&mdash;might have fainted
at once."</p>

<p>"And it's a reasonable presumption," pursued Vance, "that her
assailant would have taken it for granted that the shot had been
fatal?"</p>

<p>"We may readily assume that to be the case."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment, his eyes averted.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "I think we may assume that.&mdash;And another
point suggests itself. Since Miss Ada was in front of the
dressing-table, a considerable distance from the bed, and since the
weapon was held practically against her, the encounter would seem
to take on the nature of a deliberate attack, rather than a
haphazard shot fired by someone in a panic."</p>

<p>Von Blon looked shrewdly at Vance, and then turned a questioning
gaze upon Heath. For a moment he was silent, as if weighing his
reply, and when he spoke it was with guarded reserve.</p>

<p>"Of course, one might interpret the situation that way. Indeed,
the facts would seem to indicate such a conclusion. But, on the
other hand, the intruder might have been very close to Ada; and the
fact that the bullet entered her left shoulder at a particularly
vital point may have been the purest accident."</p>

<p>"Quite true," conceded Vance. "However, if the idea of
premeditation is to be abrogated, we must account for the fact that
the lights were on in the room when the butler entered immediately
after the shooting."</p>

<p>Von Blon showed the keenest astonishment at this statement.</p>

<p>"The lights were on? That's most remarkable!" His brow crinkled
into a perplexed frown, and he appeared to be assimilating Vance's
information. "Still," he argued, "that very fact may account for
the shooting. If the intruder had entered a lighted room he may
have fired at the occupant lest his description be given to the
police later."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" murmured Vance. "Anyway, let us hope we'll learn
the explanation when we've seen and spoken to Miss Ada."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't we get to it?" grumbled Heath, whose ordinarily
inexhaustible store of patience had begun to run low.</p>

<p>"You're so hasty, Sergeant," Vance chided him. "Doctor Von Blon
has just told us that Miss Ada is very weak; and anything we can
learn beforehand will spare her just so many questions."</p>

<p>"All I want to find out," expostulated Heath, "is if she got a
look at the bird that shot her and can give me a description of
him."</p>

<p>"That being the case, Sergeant, I fear you are doomed to have
your ardent hopes dashed to the ground."</p>

<p>Heath chewed viciously on his cigar; and Vance turned again to
Von Blon.</p>

<p>"There's one other question I'd like to ask, doctor. How long
was it after Miss Ada had been wounded before you examined
her?"</p>

<p>"The butler's already told us, Mr. Vance," interposed Heath
impatiently. "The doctor got here in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's about right." Von Blon's tone was smooth and
matter-of-fact. "I was unfortunately out on a call when Sproot
phoned, but I returned about fifteen minutes later, and hurried
right over. Luckily I live near here in East 48th Street."</p>

<p>"And was Miss Ada still unconscious when you arrived?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She had lost considerable blood. The cook, however, had
put a towel-compress on the wound, which of course helped."</p>

<p>Vance thanked him and rose.</p>

<p>"And now, if you'll be good enough to take us to your patient,
we'll be very grateful."</p>

<p>"As little excitement as possible, you understand," admonished
Von Blon, as he got up and led the way upstairs.</p>

<p>Sibella and Chester seemed undecided about accompanying us; but
as I turned into the hall I saw a look of interrogation flash
between them, and a moment later they too joined us in the upper
hall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - AN ACCUSATION</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 4 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>ADA GREENE'S room was simply, almost severely, furnished; but
there was a neatness about it, combined with little touches of
feminine decoration, that reflected the care its occupant had
bestowed upon it. To the left, near the door that led into the
dressing-room communicating with Mrs. Greene's chamber, was a
single mahogany bed of simple design; and beyond it was the door
that opened upon the stone balcony. To the right, beside the
window, stood the dressing-table; and on the amber-coloured Chinese
rug before it there showed a large irregular brown stain where the
wounded girl had lain. In the centre of the right wall was an old
Tudor fire-place with a high oak-panelled mantel.</p>

<p>As we entered, the girl in the bed looked at us inquisitively,
and a slight flush coloured her pale cheeks. She lay on her right
side, facing the door, her bandaged shoulder supported by pillows,
and her left hand, slim and white, resting upon the blue-figured
coverlet. A remnant of her fear of the night before seemed still to
linger in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>Doctor Von Blon went to her and, sitting down on the edge of the
bed, placed his hand on hers. His manner was at once protective and
impersonal.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen want to ask you a few questions, Ada," he
explained, with a reassuring smile; "and as you were so much
stronger this afternoon I brought them up. Do you feel equal to
it?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head wearily, her eyes on the doctor.</p>

<p>Vance, who had paused by the mantel to inspect the hand-carving
of the quadrae, now turned and approached the bed.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," he said, "if you don't mind, let me talk to Miss
Greene first."</p>

<p>Heath realized, I think, that the situation called for tact and
delicacy; and it was typical of the man's fundamental bigness that
he at once stepped aside.</p>

<p>"Miss Greene," said Vance, in a quiet, genial voice, drawing up
a small chair beside the bed, "we're very anxious to clear up the
mystery about last night's tragedy; and, as you are the only person
who is in a position to help us, we want you to recall for us, as
nearly as you can, just what happened."</p>

<p>The girl took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was awful," she said weakly, looking straight
ahead. "After I had gone to sleep&mdash;I don't know just what
time&mdash;something woke me up. I can't tell you what it was; but
all of a sudden I was wide awake, and the strangest feeling came
over me..." She closed her eyes, and an involuntary shudder swept
her body. "It was as though someone were in the room, threatening
me..." Her voice faded away into an awed silence.</p>

<p>"Was the room dark?" Vance asked gently.</p>

<p>"Pitch-dark." Slowly she turned her eyes to him. "That's why I
was so frightened. I couldn't see anything, and I imagined there
was a ghost&mdash;or evil spirit&mdash;near me. I tried to call
out, but I couldn't make a sound. My throat felt dry and&mdash;and
stiff."</p>

<p>"Typical constriction due to fright, Ada," explained Von Blon.
"Many people can't speak when they're frightened.&mdash;Then what
happened?"</p>

<p>"I lay trembling for a few minutes, but not a sound came from
anywhere in the room. Yet I knew&mdash;I
<i>knew</i>&mdash;somebody, or something, that meant to harm me was
here...At last I forced myself to get up&mdash;very quietly. I
wanted to turn on the lights&mdash;the darkness frightened me so.
And after a while I was standing up beside the bed here. Then, for
the first time, I could see the dim light of the windows; and it
made things seem more real somehow. So I began to grope my way
toward the electric switch there by the door. I had only gone a
little way when ...a hand ...touched me..."</p>

<p>Her lips were trembling, and a look of horror came into her
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was so stunned," she struggled on, "I hardly know
what I did. Again I tried to scream, but I couldn't even open my
lips. And then I turned and ran away from the&mdash;the
thing&mdash;toward the window. I had almost reached it when I heard
someone coming after me&mdash;a queer, shuffling sound&mdash;and I
knew it was the end...There was an awful noise, and something hot
struck the back of my shoulder. I was suddenly nauseated; the light
of the window disappeared, and I felt myself sinking
down-deep..."</p>

<p>When she ceased speaking a tense silence fell on the room. Her
account, for all its simplicity, had been tremendously graphic.
Like a great actress she had managed to convey to her listeners the
very emotional essence of her story.</p>

<p>Vance waited several moments before speaking.</p>

<p>"It was a frightful experience!" he murmured sympathetically. "I
wish it wasn't necessary to worry you about details, but there are
several points I'd like to go over with you."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly in appreciation of his considerateness, and
waited.</p>

<p>"If you tried hard, do you think you could recall what wakened
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there wasn't any sound that I can remember."</p>

<p>"Did you leave your door unlocked last night?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I don't generally lock it."</p>

<p>"And you heard no door open or close&mdash;anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No; none. Everything in the house was perfectly still."</p>

<p>"And yet you knew that someone was in the room. How, was that?"
Vance's voice, though gentle, was persistent.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know ...and yet there must have been something
that told me."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Now try to think." Vance bent a little nearer to the
troubled girl. "A soft breathing, perhaps&mdash;a slight gust of
air as the person moved by your bed&mdash;a faint odour of
perfume...?"</p>

<p>She frowned painfully, as if trying to recall the elusive cause
of her dread.</p>

<p>"I can't think&mdash;I can't remember." Her voice was scarcely
audible. "I was so terribly frightened."</p>

<p>"If only we could trace the source!" Vance glanced at the
doctor, who nodded understandingly, and said:</p>

<p>"Obviously some association whose stimulus went
unrecognized."</p>

<p>"Did you feel, Miss Greene, that you knew the person who was
here?" continued Vance. "That is to say, was it a familiar
presence?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly. I only know I was afraid of it."</p>

<p>"But you heard it move toward you after you had risen and fled
toward the window. Was there any familiarity in the sound?"</p>

<p>"No!" For the first time she spoke with emphasis. "It was just
footsteps&mdash;soft, sliding footsteps."</p>

<p>"Of course, anyone might have walked that way in the dark, or a
person in bedroom slippers..."</p>

<p>"It was only a few steps&mdash;and then came the awful noise and
burning."</p>

<p>Vance waited a moment.</p>

<p>"Try very hard to recall those steps&mdash;or rather your
impression of them. Would you say they were the steps of a man or a
woman?"</p>

<p>An added pallor overspread the girl's face; and her frightened
eyes ran over all the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Her breathing, I noticed, had quickened; and twice she parted
her lips as if to speak, but checked herself each time. At last she
said in a low tremulous voice:</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I haven't the slightest idea."</p>

<p>A short, high-strung laugh, bitter and sneering, burst from
Sibella; and all eyes were turned in amazed attention in her
direction. She stood rigidly at the foot of the bed, her face
flushed, her hands tightly clenched at her side.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell them you recognized my footsteps?" she
demanded of her sister in biting tones. "You had every intention of
doing so. Haven't you got courage enough left to lie&mdash;you
sobbing little cat?"</p>

<p>Ada caught her breath and seemed to draw herself nearer to the
doctor, who gave Sibella a stern, admonitory look.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Sib! Hold your tongue." It was Chester who broke the
startled silence that followed the outbreak.</p>

<p>Sibella shrugged her shoulders and walked to the window; and
Vance again turned his attention to the girl on the bed, continuing
his questioning as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"There's one more point, Miss Greene." His tone was even gentler
than before. "When you groped your way across the room toward the
switch, at what point did you come in contact with the unseen
person?"</p>

<p>"About half-way to the door&mdash;just beyond that
centre-table."</p>

<p>"You say a hand touched you. But how did it touch you? Did it
shove you, or try to take hold of you?" She shook her head
vaguely.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I don't know how to explain it, but I seemed to
walk into the hand, as though it were outstretched&mdash;reaching
for me."</p>

<p>"Would you say it was a large hand or a small one? Did you, for
instance, get the impression of strength?"</p>

<p>There was another silence. Again the girl's respiration
quickened, and she cast a frightened glance at Sibella, who stood
staring out into the black, swinging branches of the trees in the
side yard.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;oh, I don't know!" Her words were like a
stifled cry of anguish. "I didn't notice. It was all so
sudden&mdash;so horrible."</p>

<p>"But try to think," urged Vance's low, insistent voice. "Surely
you got some impression. Was it a man's hand, or a woman's?"</p>

<p>Sibella now came swiftly to the bed, her cheeks very pale, her
eyes blazing. For a moment she glared at the stricken girl; then
she turned resolutely to Vance.</p>

<p>"You asked me downstairs if I had any idea as to who might have
done the shooting. I didn't answer you then, but I'll answer you
now. I'll tell you who's guilty!" She jerked her head toward the
bed, and pointed a quivering finger at the still figure lying
there. "There's the guilty one&mdash;that snivelling little
outsider, that sweet angelic little snake in the grass!"</p>

<p>So incredible, so unexpected, was this accusation that for a
time no one in the room spoke. A groan burst from Ada's lips, and
she clutched at the doctor's hand with a spasmodic movement of
despair.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sibella&mdash;how could you!" she breathed.</p>

<p>Von Blon had stiffened, and an angry light came into his eyes.
But before he could speak Sibella was rushing on with her
illogical, astounding indictment.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's the one who did it! And she's deceiving you just as
she's always tried to deceive the rest of us. She hates
us&mdash;she's hated us ever since father brought her into this
house. She resents us&mdash;the things we have, the very blood in
our veins. Heaven knows what blood's in hers. She hates us because
she isn't our equal. She'd gladly see us all murdered. She killed
Julia first, because Julia ran the house and saw to it that she did
something to earn her livelihood. She despises us; and she planned
to get rid of us."</p>

<p>The girl on the bed looked piteously from one to the other of
us. There was no resentment in her eyes; she appeared stunned and
unbelieving, as if she doubted the reality of what she had
heard.</p>

<p>"Most interestin'," drawled Vance. It was his ironic tone, more
than the words themselves, that focused all eyes on him. He had
been watching Sibella during her tirade, and his gaze was still on
her.</p>

<p>"You seriously accuse your sister of doing the shooting?" He
spoke now in a pleasant, almost friendly, voice.</p>

<p>"I do!" she declared brazenly. "She hates us all."</p>

<p>"As far as that goes," smiled Vance, "I haven't noticed a
superabundance of love and affection in any of the Greene family."
His tone was without offence. "And do you base your accusation on
anything specific, Miss Greene?"</p>

<p>Isn't it specific enough that she wants us all out of the way,
that she thinks she would have everything&mdash;ease, luxury,
freedom&mdash;if there wasn't anyone else to inherit the Greene
money?"</p>

<p>"Hardly specific enough to warrant a direct accusation of so
heinous a character.&mdash;And by the by, Miss Greene, just how
would you explain the method of the crime if called as a witness in
a court of law? You couldn't altogether ignore the fact that Miss
Ada herself was shot in the back, don't y' know?"</p>

<p>For the first time the sheer impossibility of the accusation
seemed to strike Sibella. She became sullen; and her mouth settled
into a contour of angry bafflement.</p>

<p>"As I told you once before, I'm not a policewoman," she
retorted. "Crime isn't <i>my</i> speciality."</p>

<p>"Nor logic either apparently." A whimsical note crept into
Vance's voice. "But perhaps I misinterpret your accusation. Did you
mean to imply that Miss Ada shot your sister Julia, and that
someone else&mdash;party or parties unknown, I believe the phrase
is&mdash;shot Miss Ada immediately afterward&mdash;in a spirit of
vengeance, perhaps? A crime <i>&agrave; quatre mains</i>, so to
speak?"</p>

<p>Sibella's confusion was obvious, but her stubborn wrath had in
no wise abated.</p>

<p>"Well, if that was the way it happened," she countered
malevolently, "it's a rotten shame they didn't do the job
better."</p>

<p>"The blunder may at least prove unfortunate for somebody,"
suggested Vance pointedly. "Still, I hardly think we can seriously
entertain the double-culprit theory. Both of your sisters, d'ye
see, were shot with the same gun&mdash;a .32 revolver&mdash;within
a few minutes of each other. I'm afraid that we'll have to be
content with one guilty person."</p>

<p>Sibella's manner suddenly became sly and calculating. "What kind
of a gun was yours, Chet?" she asked her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was a .32, all right&mdash;an old Smith and Wesson
revolver." Chester was painfully ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Was it, indeed? Well, that's that." She turned her back on us
and went again to the window.</p>

<p>The tension in the room slackened, and Von Blon leaned
solicitously over the wounded girl and rearranged the pillows.</p>

<p>"Everyone's upset, Ada," he said soothingly. "You mustn't worry
about what's happened. Sibella'll be sorry to-morrow and make
amends. This affair has got on everybody's nerves."</p>

<p>The girl gave him a grateful glance, and seemed to relax under
his administrations.</p>

<p>After a moment he straightened up and looked at Markham.</p>

<p>"I hope you gentlemen are through&mdash;for to-day, at
least."</p>

<p>Both Vance and Markham had risen, and Heath and I had followed
suit; but at that moment Sibella strode toward us again.</p>

<p>"Wait" she commanded imperiously. "I've just thought of
something. Chet's revolver! I know where it went.&mdash;<i>She</i>
took it." Again she pointed accusingly at Ada. "I saw her in Chet's
room the other day, and I wondered then why she was snooping about
there." She gave Vance a triumphant leer. That's specific, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"What day was this, Miss Greene?" As before, his calmness seemed
to counteract the effect of her venom.</p>

<p>"What day? I don't remember exactly. Last week some time."</p>

<p>"The day you were looking for your emerald pin, perhaps?"</p>

<p>Sibella hesitated; then said angrily: "I don't recall. Why
should I remember the exact time? All I know is that, as I was
passing down the hall, I glanced into Chet's room&mdash;the door
was half open&mdash;and I saw her in there ...by the desk."</p>

<p>"And was it unusual to see Miss Ada in your brother's room?"
Vance spoke without any particular interest.</p>

<p>"She never goes into any of our rooms," declared Sibella.
"Except Rex's, sometimes. Julia told her long ago to keep out of
them."</p>

<p>Ada gave her sister a look of infinite entreaty.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sibella," she moaned; "what have I ever done to make you
dislike me so?"</p>

<p>"What have you done!" The other's voice was harsh and strident,
and a look almost demoniacal smouldered in her levelled eyes.
"Everything! Nothing! Oh, you're clever&mdash;with your quiet,
sneaky ways, and your patient, hang-dog look, and your goody-goody
manner. But you don't pull the wool over <i>my</i> eyes. You've
been hating all of us ever since you came here. And you've been
waiting for the chance to kill us, planning and scheming&mdash;you
vile little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sibella!" It was Von Blon's voice that, like the lash of a
whip, cut in on this unreasoned tirade. "That will be enough!" He
moved forward, and glanced menacingly into the girl's eyes. I was
almost as astonished at his attitude as I had been at her wild
words. There was a curious intimacy in his manner&mdash;an
implication of familiarity which struck me as unusual even for a
family physician of his long and friendly standing. Vance noticed
it too, for his eyebrows went up slightly and he watched the scene
with intense interest.</p>

<p>"You've become hysterical," Von Blon said, without lowering his
minatory gaze. "You don't realize what you've been saying."</p>

<p>I felt he would have expressed himself far more forcibly if
strangers had not been present. But his words had their effect.
Sibella dropped her eyes, and a sudden change came over her. She
covered her face with her hands, and her whole body shook with
sobs.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;sorry. I was mad&mdash;and silly&mdash;to say such
things."</p>

<p>"You'd better take Sibella to her room, Chester." Von Blon had
resumed his professional tone. "This business has been too much for
her."</p>

<p>The girl turned without another word and went out, followed by
Chester.</p>

<p>"These modern women&mdash;all nerves," Von Blon commented
laconically. Then he placed his hand on Ada's forehead. "Now, young
lady, I'm going to give you something to make you sleep after all
this excitement."</p>

<p>He had scarcely opened his medicine-case to prepare the draught
when a shrill, complaining voice drifted clearly to us from the
next room; and for the first time I noticed that the door of the
little dressing-room which communicated with Mrs. Greene's quarters
was slightly ajar.</p>

<p>"What's all the trouble now? Hasn't there been enough
disturbance already without these noisy scenes in my very ear? But
it doesn't matter, of course, how much <i>I</i> suffer...Nurse!
Shut those doors into Ada's room. You had no business to leave them
open when you knew I was trying to get a little rest. You did it on
purpose to annoy me...And, nurse! Tell the doctor I must see him
before he goes. I have those stabbing pains in my spine again. But
who thinks about me, lying here paralyzed&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The doors were closed softly, and the fretful voice was cut off
from us.</p>

<p>"She could have had the doors closed a long time ago if she'd
really wanted them closed," said Ada wearily, a look of distress on
her drawn white face. "Why, Doctor Von, does she always pretend
that everyone deliberately makes her suffer?"</p>

<p>Von Blon sighed. "I've told you, Ada, that you mustn't take your
mother's tantrums too seriously. Her irritability and complaining
are part of her disease."</p>

<p>We bade the girl good-bye, and the doctor walked with us into
the hall.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you didn't learn much," he remarked, almost
apologetically. "It's most unfortunate Ada didn't get a look at her
assailant." He addressed himself to Heath. "Did you, by the way,
look in the dining-room wall-safe to make sure nothing was missing?
You know, there's one there behind the big niello over the
mantel."</p>

<p>"One of the first places we inspected." The sergeant's voice was
a bit disdainful. "And that reminds me, doc: I want to send a man
up in the morning to look for finger-prints in Miss Ada's
room."</p>

<p>Von Blon agreed amiably, and held out his hand to Markham.</p>

<p>"And if there's any way I can be of service to you or the
police," he added pleasantly, "please call on me. I'll be only too
glad to help. I don't see just what I can do, but one never
knows."</p>

<p>Markham thanked him, and we descended to the lower hall. Sproot
was waiting to help us with our coats, and a moment later we were
in the District Attorney's car ploughing our way through the
snowdrifts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII - VANCE ARGUES THE CASE</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 9th; 5 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>IT was nearly five o'clock when we reached the Criminal Courts
Building. Swacker had lit the old bronze-and-china chandelier of
Markham's private office, and an atmosphere of eerie gloom pervaded
the room.</p>

<p>"Not a nice family, Markham, old dear," sighed Vance, lying back
in one of the deep leather-upholstered chairs. "Decidedly not a
nice family. A family run to seed, its old vigour vitiated. If the
heredit'ry sires of the contempor'ry Greenes could rise from their
sepulchres and look in upon their present progeny, my word! what a
jolly good shock they'd have!...Funny thing how these old families
degenerate under the environment of ease and idleness. There are
the Wittelsbachs, and the Romanoffs, and the Julian-Claudian house,
and the Abbasside dynasty&mdash;all examples of phyletic
disintegration...And it's the same with nations, don't y' know.
Luxury and unrestrained indulgence are corruptin' influences. Look
at Rome under the soldier emperors, and Assyria under Sardanapalus,
and Egypt under the later Ramessids, and the Vandal African empire
under Gelimer. It's very distressin'."</p>

<p>"Your erudite observations might be highly absorbing to the
social historian," grumbled Markham, with an undisguised show of
irritability; "but I can't say they're particularly edifying, or
even relevant, in the present circumstances."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be too positive on that point," Vance returned
easily. "In fact, I submit, for your earnest and profound
consideration, the temperaments and internal relationships of the
Greene clan, as pointers upon the dark road of the present
investigation...Really, y' know"&mdash;he assumed a humoursome
tone&mdash;"it's most unfortunate that you and the sergeant are so
obsessed with the idea of social justice and that sort of thing;
for society would be much better off if such families as the
Greenes were exterminated. Still, it's a fascinatin'
problem&mdash;most fascinatin'."</p>

<p>"I regret I can't share your enthusiasm for it." Markham spoke
with asperity. "The crime strikes me as sordid and commonplace. And
if it hadn't been for your interference I'd have sent Chester
Greene on his way this morning with some tactful platitudes. But
you had to intercede, with your cryptic innuendoes and mysterious
head-waggings; and I foolishly let myself be drawn into it. Well, I
trust you had an enjoyable afternoon. As for myself, I have three
hours' accumulated work before me."</p>

<p>His complaint was an obvious suggestion that we take ourselves
off; but Vance showed no intention of going.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't depart just yet," he announced, with a bantering
smile. "I couldn't bring myself to leave you in your present state
of grievous error. You need guidance, Markham; and I've quite made
up my mind to pour out my flutterin' heart to you and the
sergeant."</p>

<p>Markham frowned. He understood Vance so well that he knew the
other's levity was only superficial&mdash;that, indeed, it cloaked
some particularly serious purpose. And the experience of a long,
intimate friendship had taught him that Vance's
actions&mdash;however unreasonable they might appear&mdash;were
never the result of an idle whim.</p>

<p>"Very well," he acquiesced. "But I'd be grateful for an economy
of words."</p>

<p>Vance sighed mournfully.</p>

<p>"Your attitude is so typical of the spirit of breathless speed
existing in this restless day." He fixed an inquisitive gaze on
Heath. "Tell me, Sergeant: you saw the body of Julia Greene, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I saw it."</p>

<p>"Was her position in the bed a natural one?"</p>

<p>"How do I know how she generally laid in bed?" Heath was restive
and in bad humour. "She was half sitting up, with a coupla pillows
under her shoulders, and the covers pulled up."</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual about her attitude?"</p>

<p>"Not that I could see. There hadn't been a struggle, if that's
what you mean."</p>

<p>"And her hands: were they outside or under the covers?"</p>

<p>Heath looked up, mildly astonished.</p>

<p>"They were outside. And, now that you mention it, they had a
tight hold on the spread."</p>

<p>Clutching it, in fact?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes."</p>

<p>Vance leaned forward quickly.</p>

<p>"And her face, Sergeant? Had she been shot in her sleep?"</p>

<p>"It didn't look that way. Her eyes were wide open, staring
straight ahead."</p>

<p>"Her eyes were open and staring," repeated Vance, a note of
eagerness coming into his voice. "What would you say her expression
indicated? Fear? Horror? Surprise?"</p>

<p>Heath regarded Vance shrewdly. "Well, it mighta been any one of
'em. Her mouth was open, like as if she was surprised at
something."</p>

<p>"And she was clutching the spread with both hands." Vance's look
drifted into space. Then slowly he rose and walked the length of
the office and back, his head down. He halted in front of the
District Attorney's desk, and leaned over, resting both hands on
the back of a chair.</p>

<p>"Listen, Markham. There's something terrible and unthinkable
going on in that house. No haphazard unknown assassin came in by
the front door last night and shot down those two women. The crime
was planned&mdash;thought out. Someone lay in wait&mdash;someone
who knew his way about, knew where the light-switches were, knew
when everyone was asleep, knew when the servants had
retired&mdash;knew just when and how to strike the blow. Some deep,
awful motive lies behind that crime. There are depths beneath
depths in what happened last night&mdash;obscure fetid chambers of
the human soul. Black hatreds, unnatural desires, hideous impulses,
obscene ambitions are at the bottom of it; and you are only playing
into the murderer's hands when you sit back and refuse to see its
significance."</p>

<p>His voice had a curious hushed quality, and it was difficult to
believe that this was the habitually debonair and cynical
Vance.</p>

<p>"That house is polluted, Markham. It's crumbling in
decay&mdash;not material decay, perhaps, but a putrefaction far
more terrible. The very heart and essence of that old house is
rotting away. And all the inmates are rotting with it,
disintegrating in spirit and mind and character. They've been
polluted by the very atmosphere they've created. This crime, which
you take so lightly, was inevitable in such a setting. I only
wonder it was not more terrible, more vile. It marked one of the
tertiary stages of the general dissolution of that abnormal
establishment."</p>

<p>He paused, and extended his hand in a hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>"Think of the situation. That old, lonely, spacious house,
exuding the musty atmosphere of dead generations, faded inside and
out, run down, dingy, filled with ghosts of another day, standing
there in its ill-kept grounds, lapped by the dirty waters of the
river...And then think of those six ill-sorted, restless, unhealthy
beings compelled to live there in daily contact for a quarter of a
century&mdash;such was old Tobias Greene's perverted idealism. And
they've lived there, day in and day out, in that mouldy miasma of
antiquity-unfit to meet the conditions of any alternative, too weak
or too cowardly to strike out alone; held by an undermining
security and a corrupting ease; growing to hate the very sight of
one another, becoming bitter, spiteful, jealous, vicious; wearing
down each other's nerves to the raw; consumed with resentment,
aflame with hate, thinking evil&mdash;complaining, fighting,
snarling...Then, at last, the breaking point&mdash;the logical,
ineluctable figuration of all this self-feeding, ingrowing
hatred."</p>

<p>"All of that is easy to understand," agreed Markham. "But, after
all, your conclusion is wholly theoretic, not to say
literary.&mdash;By what tangible links do you connect last night's
shooting with the admittedly abnormal situation at the Greene
mansion?"</p>

<p>"There are no tangible links&mdash;that's the horror of it. But
the joinders are there, however shadowy. I began to sense them the
minute I entered the house; and all this afternoon I was reaching
for them blindly. But they eluded me at every turn. It was like a
house of mazes and false passages and trap-doors and reeking
oubliettes: nothing normal, nothing sane&mdash;a house in a
nightmare, peopled by strange, abnormal creatures, each reflecting
the subtle, monstrous horror that broke forth last night and went
prowling about the old hallways. Didn't you sense it? Didn't you
see the vague shape of this abomination continually flash out and
disappear as we talked to these people and watched them battling
against their own hideous thoughts and suspicions?"</p>

<p>Markham moved uneasily and straightened a pile of papers before
him. Vance's unwonted gravity had affected him.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly what you mean," he said. "But I don't
see that your impressions bring us any nearer to a new theory of
the crime. The Greene mansion is unhealthy&mdash;that's
granted&mdash;and so, no doubt, are the people in it. But I'm
afraid you've been oversusceptible to its atmosphere. You talk as
if last night's crime were comparable to the poisoning orgies of
the Borgias, or the Marquise de Brinvilliers affair, or the murder
of Drusus and Germanicus, or the suffocation of the York princes in
the Tower. I'll admit the setting is consonant with that sort of
stealthy, romantic crime; but, after all, housebreakers and bandits
are shooting people senselessly every week throughout the country,
in very much the same way the two Greene women were shot."</p>

<p>"You're shutting your eyes to the facts, Markham," Vance
declared earnestly. "You're overlooking several strange features of
last night's crime&mdash;the horrified, astounded attitude of Julia
at the moment of death; the illogical interval between the two
shots; the fact that the lights were on in both rooms; Ada's story
of that hand reaching for her; the absence of any signs of a forced
entry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about those footprints in the snow?" interrupted Heath's
matter-of-fact voice.</p>

<p>"What about them, indeed?" Vance wheeled about. "They're as
incomprehensible as the rest of this hideous business. Someone
walked to and from the house within a half-hour of the crime; but
it was someone who knew he could get in quietly and without
disturbing anyone."</p>

<p>"There's nothing mysterious about that," asserted the practical
sergeant. "There are four servants in the house, and any one of 'em
could've been in on the job."</p>

<p>Vance smiled ironically.</p>

<p>"And this accomplice in the house, who so generously opened the
front door at a specified hour, failed to inform the intruder where
the loot was, and omitted to acquaint him with the arrangement of
the house; with the result that, once he was inside, he went
astray, overlooked the dining-room, wandered upstairs, went groping
about the hall, got lost in the various bedrooms, had a seizure of
panic, shot two women, turned on the lights by switches hidden
behind the furniture, made his way downstairs without a sound when
Sproot was within a few feet of him, and walked out the front door
to freedom!...A strange burglar, Sergeant. And an even stranger
inside accomplice.&mdash;No; your explanation won't
do&mdash;decidedly it won't do." He turned back to Markham.</p>

<p>"And the only way you'll ever find the true explanation for
those shootings is by understanding the unnatural situation that
exists in the house itself."</p>

<p>"But we know the situation, Vance," Markham argued patiently.
"I'll admit it's an unusual one. But it's not necessarily criminal.
Antagonistic human elements are often thrown together; and a mutual
hate is generated as a result. But mere hate is rarely a motive for
murder; and it certainly does not constitute evidence of criminal
activity."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But hatred and enforced propinquity may breed all
manner of abnormalities&mdash;outrageous passions, abominable
evils, devilish intrigues. And in the present case there are any
number of curious and sinister facts that need
explaining&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! Now you're becoming more tangible. Just what are these
facts that call for explanation?"</p>

<p>Vance lit a cigarette and sat down on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"For instance, why did Chester Greene come here in the first
place and solicit your help? Because of the disappearance of the
gun? Maybe; but I doubt if it is the whole explanation. And what
about the gun itself? Did it disappear? Or did Chester secrete it?
Deuced queer about the gun. And Sibella said she saw it last week.
But did she see it? We'll know a lot more about the case when we
can trace the peregrinations of that revolver.&mdash;And why did
Chester hear the first shot so readily, when Rex, in the next room
to Ada's, says he failed to hear the second shot?&mdash;And that
long interval between the two reports will need some
explaining.&mdash;And there's Sproot&mdash;the multilingual butler
who happened to be reading Martial&mdash;Martial, by all that's
holy!&mdash;when the grim business took place, and came directly to
the scene without meeting or hearing anyone.&mdash;And just what
significance attaches to the pious Hemming's oracular
pronouncements about the Lord of hosts smiting the Greenes as He
did the children of Babylon? She has some obscure religious notion
in her head&mdash;which, after all, may not be so
obscure.&mdash;And the German cook: there's a woman with, as we
euphemistically say, a past. Despite her phlegmatic appearance,
she's not of the servant class; yet she's been feeding the Greenes
dutifully for over a dozen years. You recall her explanation of how
she came to the Greenes? Her husband was a friend of old Tobias's;
and Tobias gave orders she was to remain as cook as long as she
desired. She needs explaining, Markham&mdash;and a dashed lot of
it.&mdash;And Rex, with his projecting parietals and his wambly
body and his periodic fits. Why did he get so excited when we
questioned him? He certainly didn't act like an innocent and
uncomprehending spectator of an attempted burglary.&mdash;And again
I mention the lights. Who turned them on, and why? And in both
rooms! In Julia's room <i>before</i> the shot was fired, for she
evidently saw the assassin and understood his purpose; and in Ada's
room, <i>after</i> the shooting! Those are facts which fairly
shriek for explanation; for without an explanation they're mad,
irrational, utterly incredible.&mdash;And why wasn't Von Blon at
home in the middle of the night when Sproot phoned him? And how did
it happen he nevertheless arrived so promptly? Coincidence? ...And,
by the by, Sergeant: was that double set of footprints like the
single spoor of the doctor's?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any way of telling. The snow was too flaky."</p>

<p>"They probably don't matter particularly, anyhow." Vance again
faced Markham and resumed his recapitulation. "And then there are
the points of difference in these two attacks. Julia was shot from
the front when she was in bed, whereas Ada was shot in the back
after she had risen from bed, although the murderer had ample time
to go to her and take aim while she was still lying down. Why did
he wait silently until the girl got up and approached him? How did
he dare wait at all after he had killed Julia and alarmed the
house? Does that strike you as panic? Or as cool-
headedness?&mdash;And how did Julia's door come to be unlocked at
that particular time? That's something I especially want
clarified.&mdash;And perhaps you noticed, Markham, that Chester
himself went to summon Sibella to the interview in the
drawing-room, and that he remained with her a considerable time.
Why, now, did he send Sproot for Rex, and fetch Sibella personally?
And why the delay? I yearn for an explanation of what passed
between them before they eventually appeared.&mdash;And why was
Sibella so definite that there wasn't a burglar, and yet so evasive
when we asked her to suggest a counter-theory? What underlay her
satirical frankness when she held up each member of the Greene
household, including herself, as a possible suspect?&mdash;And then
there are the details of Ada's story. Some of them are amazing,
incomprehensible, almost fabulous. There was no apparent sound in
the room; yet she was conscious of a menacing presence. And that
outstretched hand and the shuffling footsteps&mdash;we simply must
have an explanation of those things. And her hesitancy about saying
whether she thought it was a man or a woman; and Sibella's evident
belief that the girl thought it was she. That wants explaining,
Markham.&mdash;And Sibella's hysterical accusation against Ada.
What lay behind that?&mdash;And don't forget that curious scene
between Sibella and Von Blon when he reproached her for her
outburst. That was devilish odd. There's some intimacy
there&mdash;<i>ca saute aux yeux</i>. You noticed how she obeyed
him. And you doubtless observed, too, that Ada is rather fond of
the doctor: snuggled up to him figuratively during the performance,
opened her eyes on him wistfully, looked to him for protection. Oh,
our little Ada has flutterings in his direction. And yet he adopts
the hovering professional bedside manner of a high-priced medico
toward her, whereas he treats Sibella very much as Chester might if
he had the courage."</p>

<p>Vance inhaled deeply on his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Yes, Markham, there are many things that must be satisfactorily
accounted for before I can believe in your hypothetical
burglar."</p>

<p>Markham sat for a while, engrossed in his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I've listened to your Homeric catalogue, Vance," he said at
length, "but I can't say that it inflames me. You've suggested a
number of interesting possibilities, and raised several points that
might bear looking into. However, the only potential weight of your
argument lies in an accumulation of items which, taken separately,
are not particularly impressive. A plausible answer might be found
for each one of them. The trouble is, the integers of your summary
are without a connecting thread, and consequently must be regarded
as separate units."</p>

<p>"That legal mind of yours!" Vance rose and paced up and down.
"An accumulation of queer and unexplained facts centring about a
crime is no more impressive than each separate item in the total!
Well, well! I give up. I renounce all reason. I fold up my tent
like the Arabs and as silently steal away." He took up his coat. "I
leave you to your fantastic, delirious burglar, who walks without
keys into a house and steals nothing, who knows where electric
switches are hidden but can't find a staircase, who shoots women
and then turns up the lights. When you find him, my dear Lycurgus,
you should, in all humaneness, send him to the psychopathic ward.
He's quite unaccountable, I assure you."</p>

<p>Markham, despite his opposition, had not been unimpressed. Vance
unquestionably had undermined to some extent his belief in a
housebreaker. But I could readily understand why he was reluctant
to abandon this theory until it had been thoroughly tested. His
next words, in fact, explained his attitude.</p>

<p>"I'm not denying the remote possibility that this affair may go
deeper than appears. But there's too little to go on at present to
warrant an investigation along other than routine lines. We can't
very well stir up an ungodly scandal by raking the members of a
prominent family over the coals, when there's not a scintilla of
evidence against any one of them. It's too unjust and dangerous a
proceeding. We must at least wait until the police have finished
their investigation. Then, if nothing develops, we can again take
inventory and decide how to proceed...How long, Sergeant, do you
figure on being busy?"</p>

<p>Heath took his cigar from his mouth and regarded it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That's hard to say, sir. Dubois'll finish up his fingerprinting
to- morrow, and we're checking up on the regulars as fast as we
can. Also, I've got two men digging up the records of the Greene
servants. It may take a lot of time, and it may go quick. Depends
on the breaks we get."</p>

<p>Vance sighed.</p>

<p>"And it was such a neat, fascinatin' crime! I've rather been
looking forward to it, don't y' know, and now you talk of prying
into the early amours of serving-maids and that sort of thing. It's
most disheartenin'."</p>

<p>He buttoned his ulster about him and walked to the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, there's nothing for me to do while you Jasons are
launched on your quaint quest. I think I'll retire and resume my
translation of Delacroix's 'Journal.'"</p>

<p>But Vance was not destined then to finish his task he had had in
mind so long. Three days later the front pages of the country's
press carried glaring headlines telling of a second grim and
unaccountable tragedy at the old Greene mansion, which altered the
entire character of the case and immediately lifted it into the
realm of the foremost <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> of
modern times. After this second blow had fallen all ideas of a
casual burglar were banished. There could no longer be any doubt
that a hidden death-dealing horror stalked through the dim
corridors of that fated house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII - THE SECOND TRAGEDY</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, November 12th; 8 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>THE day after we had taken leave of Markham at his office the
rigour of the weather suddenly relaxed. The sun came out, and the
thermometer rose nearly thirty degrees. Toward night of the second
day, however, a fine, damp snow began to fall, spreading a thin
white blanket over the city; but around eleven the skies were again
clear.</p>

<p>I mention these facts because they had a curious bearing on the
second crime at the Greene mansion. Footprints again appeared on
the front walk; and, as a result of the clinging softness of the
snow, the police also found tracks in the lower hall and on the
marble stairs.</p>

<p>Vance had spent Wednesday and Thursday in his library reading
desultorily and checking Vollard's catalogue of Cezanne's
water-colours. The three- volume edition of the "Journal de
Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix"* (*E. Plon, Nourrit et Cie, Paris, 1893)
lay on his writing-table; but I noticed that he did not so much as
open it. He was restless and distracted, and his long silences at
dinner (which we ate together in the living-room before the great
log fire) told me only too clearly that something was perturbing
him. Moreover, he had sent notes cancelling several social
engagements, and had given orders to Currie, his valet and domestic
factotum, that he was "out" to callers.</p>

<p>As he sat sipping his cognac at the end of dinner on Thursday
night, his eyes idly tracing the forms in the Renoir
<i>Beigneuse</i> above the mantel, he gave voice to his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, Van, I can't shake the atmosphere of that
damnable house. Markham is probably right in refusing to take the
matter seriously&mdash;one can't very well chivvy a bereaved family
simply because I'm oversensitive. And yet"&mdash;he shook himself
slightly&mdash;"it's most annoyin'. Maybe I'm becoming weak and
emotional. What if I should suddenly go in for Whistlers and
Bocklins! Could you endure it? <i>Miserere nostri</i>! ...No, it
won't come to that. But&mdash;dash it all!&mdash;that Greene murder
is haunting my slumbers like a lamia. And the business isn't over
yet. There's a horrible incompleteness about what's already
occurred..."</p>

<p>It was scarcely eight o'clock on the following morning when
Markham brought us the news of the second Greene tragedy. I had
risen early, and was having my coffee in the library when Markham
came in, brushing past the astonished Currie with only a curt
nod.</p>

<p>"Get Vance out right away&mdash;will you, Van Dine?" he began,
without even a word of greeting. "Something serious has
happened."</p>

<p>I hastened to fetch Vance, who grumblingly slipped into a
camel's-hair dressing-gown and came leisurely into the library.</p>

<p>"My dear Markham!" he reproached the District Attorney. "Why pay
your social calls in the middle of the night?"</p>

<p>"This isn't a social call," Markham told him tartly. "Chester
Greene has been murdered."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance rang for Currie and lighted a cigarette. "Coffee for
two and clothes for one," he ordered, when the man appeared. Then
he sank into a chair before the fire and gave Markham a waggish
look. "That same unique burglar, I suppose. A perseverin' lad. Did
the family plate disappear this time?"</p>

<p>Markham gave a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"No, the plate's intact; and I think we can now eliminate the
burglar theory. I'm afraid your premonitions were
correct&mdash;damn your uncanny faculty!"</p>

<p>"Pour out your heart-breakin' story." Vance, for all his levity,
was extraordinarily interested. His moodiness of the past two days
had given way to an almost eager alertness.</p>

<p>"It was Sproot who phoned the news to Head-quarters a little
before midnight. The operator in the Homicide Bureau caught Heath
at home, and the sergeant was at the Greene house inside of half an
hour. He's there now&mdash;phoned me at seven this morning. I told
him I'd hurry out, so I didn't get many details over the wire. All
I know is that Chester Greene was fatally shot last night at almost
the exact hour that the former shootings occurred&mdash;a little
after half-past eleven."</p>

<p>"Was he in his own room at the time?" Vance was pouring the
coffee which Currie had brought in.</p>

<p>"I believe Heath did mention he was found in his bedroom."</p>

<p>"Shot from the front?"</p>

<p>"Yes, through the heart, at very close range."</p>

<p>"Very interestin'. A duplication of Julia's death, as it were."
Vance became reflective. "So the old house has claimed another
victim. But why Chester? ...Who found him, incidentally?"</p>

<p>"Sibella, I think Heath said. Her room, you remember, is next to
Chester's, and the shot probably roused her. But we'd better be
going."</p>

<p>"Am I invited?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would come." Markham made no effort to hide his
desire to have the other accompany him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had every intention of doing so, don't y' know." And
Vance left the room abruptly to get dressed.</p>

<p>It took the District Attorney's car but a few minutes to reach
the Greene mansion from Vance's house in East 38th Street. A
patrolman stood guard outside the great iron gates, and a
plain-clothes man lounged on the front steps beneath the arched
doorway.</p>

<p>Heath was in the drawing-room talking earnestly to Inspector
Moran, who had just arrived; and two men from the Homicide Bureau
stood by the window awaiting orders. The house was peculiarly
silent: no member of the family was to be seen.</p>

<p>The sergeant came forward at once. His usual ruddiness of
complexion was gone and his eyes were troubled. He shook hands with
Markham, and then gave Vance a look of friendly welcome.</p>

<p>"You had the right dope, Mr. Vance. Somebody's ripping things
wide open here; and it isn't swag they're after."</p>

<p>Inspector Moran joined us, and again the handshaking ceremony
took place.</p>

<p>"This case is going to stir things up considerably," he said.
"And we're in for an unholy scandal if we don't clean it up
quickly."</p>

<p>The worried look in Markham's face deepened.</p>

<p>"The sooner we get to work, then, the better. Are you going to
lend a hand, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"There's no need, I think," Moran answered quietly. "I'll leave
the police end entirely with Sergeant Heath; and now that
you&mdash;and Mr. Vance&mdash; are here, I'd be of no use." He gave
Vance a pleasant smile, and made his adieux. "Keep in touch with
me, Sergeant, and use all the men you want."* (*Inspector William
M. Moran, who died last summer, had been the commanding officer of
the Detective Bureau for eight years. He was a man of rare and
unusual qualities, and with his death the New York Police
Department lost one of its most efficient and trustworthy
officials. He had formerly been a well-known up-State banker who
had been forced to close his doors during the 1907 panic.)</p>

<p>When he had gone Heath gave us the details of the crime.</p>

<p>At about half-past eleven, after the family and the servants had
retired, the shot was fired. Sibella was reading in bed at the time
and heard it distinctly. She rose immediately and, after listening
for several moments, stole up the servants' stairs&mdash;the
entrance to which was but a few feet from her door. She wakened the
butler, and the two of them then went to Chester's room. The door
was unlocked and the lights in the room were burning. Chester
Greene was sitting, slightly huddled, in a chair near the desk.
Sproot went to him, but saw that he was dead, and immediately left
the room, locking the door. He then telephoned to the police and to
Doctor Von Blon.</p>

<p>"I got here before Von Blon did," Heath explained. "The doctor
was out again when the butler phoned, and didn't get the message
till nearly one o'clock. I was damn glad of it, because it gave me
a chance to check up on the footprints outside. The minute I turned
in at the gate I could see that somebody had come and gone, the
same as last time; and I whistled for the man on the beat to guard
the entrance until Snitkin arrived. Then I came on in, keeping
along the edge of the walk; and the first thing I noticed when the
butler opened the door was a little puddle of water on the rug in
the hall. Somebody had recently tracked the soft snow in. I found a
coupla other puddles in the hall, and there were some wet imprints
on the steps leading upstairs. Five minutes later Snitkin gave me
the signal from the street, and I put him to work on the footprints
outside. The tracks were plain, and Snitkin was able to get some
pretty accurate measurements."</p>

<p>After Snitkin had been put to work on the footprints, the
sergeant, it seemed, went upstairs to Chester's room and made an
examination. But he found nothing unusual, aside from the murdered
man in the chair, and after half an hour descended again to the
dining-room, where Sibella and Sproot were waiting. He had just
begun his questioning of them when Doctor Von Blon arrived.</p>

<p>"I took him upstairs," said Heath, "and he looked at the body.
He seemed to want to stick around, but I told him he'd be in the
way. So he talked to Miss Greene out in the hall for five or ten
minutes, and then left."</p>

<p>Shortly after Doctor Von Blon's departure two other Men from the
Homicide Bureau arrived, and the next two hours were spent in
interrogating the members of the household. But nobody, except
Sibella, admitted even hearing the shot. Mrs. Greene was not
questioned. When Miss Craven, the nurse, who slept on the third
floor, was sent in to her, she reported that the old lady was
sleeping soundly; and the sergeant decided not to disturb her. Nor
was Ada awakened: according to the nurse, the girl had been asleep
since nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Rex Greene, however, when interviewed, contributed one vague
and, as it seemed, contradictory bit of evidence. He had been lying
awake, he said, at the time the snowfall ceased, which was a little
after eleven. Then, about ten minutes later, he had imagined he
heard a faint shuffling noise in the hall and the sound of a door
closing softly. He had thought nothing of it, and only recalled it
when pressed by Heath. A quarter of an hour afterward he had looked
at his watch. It was then twenty-five minutes past eleven; and very
soon after that he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>"The only queer thing about his story," commented Heath, "is the
time. If he's telling the tale straight, he heard this noise and
the door shutting twenty minutes or so before the shot was fired.
And nobody in the house was up at the time. I tried to shake him on
the question of the exact hour, but he stuck to it like a leech. I
compared his watch with mine, and it was O.K. Anyhow, there's
nothing much to the story. The wind mighta blown a door shut, or he
mighta heard a noise out in the street and thought it was in the
hall."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Sergeant," put in Vance, "if I were you I'd file
Rex's story away for future meditation. Somehow it appeals to
me."</p>

<p>Heath looked up sharply and was about to ask a question; but he
changed his mind and said merely:</p>

<p>"It's filed." Then he finished his report to Markham.</p>

<p>After interrogating the occupants of the house he had gone back
to the Bureau, leaving his men on guard, and set the machinery of
his office in operation. He had returned to the Greene mansion
early that morning, and was now waiting for the Medical Examiner,
the finger-print experts, and the official photographer. He had
given orders for the servants to remain in their quarters, and had
instructed Sproot to serve breakfast to all the members of the
family in their own rooms.</p>

<p>"This thing's going to take work, sir," he concluded. "And it's
going to be touchy going, too."</p>

<p>Markham nodded gravely, and glanced toward Vance, whose eyes
were resting moodily on an old oil-painting of Tobias Greene.</p>

<p>"Does this new development help co-ordinate any of your former
impressions?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It at least substantiates the feeling I had that this old house
reeks with a deadly poison," Vance replied. "This thing is like a
witches' sabbath." He gave Markham a humorous smile. "I'm beginning
to think your task is going to take on the nature of exorcising
devils."</p>

<p>Markham grunted.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the magic potions to you...Sergeant, suppose we take
a look at the body before the Medical Examiner gets here."</p>

<p>Heath led the way without a word. When we reached the head of
the stairs he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of
Chester's room. The electric lights were still burning&mdash;sickly
yellow disks in the grey daylight which filtered in from the
windows above the river.</p>

<p>The room, long and narrow, contained an anachronistic assortment
of furniture. It was a typical man's apartment, with an air of
comfortable untidiness. Newspapers and sports magazines cluttered
the table and desk; ash-trays were everywhere; an open cellaret
stood in one corner; and a collection of golf-clubs lay on the
tapestried Chesterfield. The bed, I noticed, had not been slept
in.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, beneath an old-fashioned cut-glass
chandelier, was a Chippendale "knee-hole" desk, beside which stood
a sleepy-hollow chair. It was in this chair that the body of
Chester Greene, clad in dressing-gown and slippers, reclined. He
was slumped a little forward, the head turned slightly back and
resting against the tufted upholstery. The light from the
chandelier cast a spectral illumination on his face; and the sight
of it laid a spell of horror on me. The eyes, normally prominent,
now seemed to be protruding from their sockets in a stare of
unutterable amazement; and the sagging chin and flabby parted lips
intensified this look of terrified wonder.</p>

<p>Vance was studying the dead man's features intently.</p>

<p>"Would you say, Sergeant," he asked, without looking up, "that
Chester and Julia saw the same thing as they passed from this
world?"</p>

<p>Heath coughed uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, "something surprised them, and that's a
fact."</p>

<p>"Surprised them! Sergeant, you should thank your Maker that you
are not cursed with an imagination. The whole truth of this
fiendish business lies in those bulbous eyes and that gaping mouth.
Unlike Ada, both Julia and Chester saw the thing that menaced them;
and it left them stunned and aghast."</p>

<p>"Well, we can't get any information outa <i>them</i>." Heath's
practicality as usual was uppermost.</p>

<p>"Not oral information, certainly. But, as Hamlet put it, murder,
though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous
organ."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Vance. Be tangible." Markham spoke with acerbity.
"What's in your mind?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, I don't know. It's too vague." He leaned over and
picked up a small book from the floor just beneath where the dead
man's hand hung over the arm of the chair. "Chester apparently was
immersed in literature at the time of his taking off." He opened
the book casually. "'Hydrotherapy and Constipation.' Yes, Chester
was just the kind to worry about his colon. Someone probably told
him that intestinal stasis interfered with the proper stance. He's
no doubt clearing the asphodel from the Elysian fields at the
present moment preparat'ry to laying out a golf-course."</p>

<p>He became suddenly serious.</p>

<p>"You see what this book means, Markham? Chester was sitting here
reading when the murderer came in. Yet he did not so much as rise
or call out. Furthermore, he let the intruder stand directly in
front of him. He did not even lay down his book, but sat back in
his chair relaxed. Why? Because the murderer was someone Chester
knew&mdash;and trusted! And when the gun was suddenly brought forth
and pointed at his heart, he was too astounded to move. And in that
second of bewilderment and unbelief the trigger was pulled and the
bullet entered his heart."</p>

<p>Markham nodded slowly, in deep perplexity, and Heath studied the
attitude of the dead man more closely.</p>

<p>"That's a good theory," the sergeant conceded finally. "Yes, he
musta let the bird get right on top of him without suspecting
anything. Same like Julia did."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Sergeant. The two murders constitute a most suggestive
parallel."</p>

<p>"Still and all, there's one point you're overlooking." Heath's
brow was roughened in a troubled frown. "Chester's door mighta been
unlocked last night, seeing as he hadn't gone to bed, and so this
person coulda walked in without any trouble. But Julia, now, was
already undressed and in bed; and she always locked her door at
night. Now, how would you say this person with the gun got into
Julia's room, Mr. Vance?"</p>

<p>"There's no difficulty about that. Let us say, as a tentative
hypothesis, that Julia had disrobed, switched off the lights, and
climbed into her queenly bed. Then came a tap on the
door&mdash;perhaps a tap she recognized. She rose, put on the
lights, opened the door, and again repaired to her bed for warmth
while she held parley with her visitor. Maybe&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;the visitor sat on the edge of the bed during the
call. Then suddenly the visitor produced the revolver and fired,
and made a hurried exit, forgetting to switch the lights off. Such
a theory&mdash;though I don't insist on the details&mdash;would
square neatly with my idea regarding Chester's caller."</p>

<p>"It may've been like you say," admitted Heath dubiously. "But
why all the hocus-pocus when it came to shooting Ada? That job was
done in the dark."</p>

<p>"The rationalistic philosophers tell us, Sergeant"&mdash;Vance
became puckishly pedantic&mdash;"that there's a reason for
everything, but that the finite mind is woefully restricted. The
altered technique of our elusive culprit when dealing with Ada is
one of the things that is obscure. But you've touched a vital
point. If we could discover the reason for this reversal of our
<i>inconnu's</i> homicidal tactics, I believe we'd be a lot
forrader in our investigation."</p>

<p>Heath made no reply. He stood in the centre of the room running
his eye over the various objects and pieces of furniture. Presently
he stepped to the clothes-closet, pulled open the door, and turned
on a pendent electric light just inside. As he stood gloomily
peering at the closet's contents there was a sound of heavy
footsteps in the hall and Snitkin appeared in the open door. Heath
turned and, without giving his assistant time to speak, asked
gruffly:</p>

<p>"How did you make out with those footprints?"</p>

<p>"Got all the dope here." Snitkin crossed to the sergeant, and
held out a long manila envelope. "There wasn't no trouble in
checking the measurements and cutting the patterns. But they're not
going to be a hell of a lot of good, I'm thinking. There's ten
million guys more or less in this country who coulda made 'em."</p>

<p>Heath had opened the envelope and drawn forth a thin white
cardboard pattern which looked like an inner sole of a shoe.</p>

<p>"It wasn't no pygmy who made this print," he remarked.</p>

<p>"That's the catch in it," explained Snitkin. "The size don't
mean nothing much, for it ain't a shoe-track. Those footprints were
made by galoshes, and there's no telling how much bigger they were
than the guy's foot. They mighta been worn over a shoe anywheres
from a size eight to a size ten, and with a width anywheres from an
A to a D."</p>

<p>Heath nodded with obvious disappointment.</p>

<p>"You're sure about 'em being galoshes?" He was reluctant to let
what promised to be a valuable clue slip away.</p>

<p>"You can't get around it. The rubber tread was distinct in
several places, and the shallow, scooped heel stood out as plain as
day. Anyhow, I got Jerym* to check up on my findings." (*Captain
Anthony P. Jerym was one of the shrewdest and most painstaking
criminologists of the New York Police Department. Though he had
begun his career as an expert in the Bertillon system of
measurements, he had later specialized in footprints&mdash;a
subject which he had helped to elevate to an elaborate and
complicated science. He had spent several years in Vienna studying
Austrian methods, and had developed a means of scientific
photography for footprints which gave him rank with such men as
Londe, Burias, and Reiss.)</p>

<p>Snitkin's gaze wandered idly to the floor of the
clothes-closet.</p>

<p>"Those are the kind of things that made the tracks."</p>

<p>He pointed to a pair of high arctics which had been thrown
carelessly under a boot-shelf. Then he leaned over and picked up
one of them. As his eye rested on it he gave a grunt. "This looks
like the size, too." He took the pattern from the sergeant's hand
and laid it on the sole of the overshoe. It fitted as perfectly as
if the two had been cut simultaneously.</p>

<p>Heath was startled out of his depression.</p>

<p>"Now, what in hell does that mean!"</p>

<p>Markham had drawn near.</p>

<p>"It might indicate, of course, that Chester went out somewhere
late last night."</p>

<p>"But that don't make sense, sir," objected Heath. "If he'd
wanted anything at that hour of the night he'd have sent the
butler. And, anyway, the shops in this neighbourhood were all
closed by that time, for the tracks weren't made till after it had
stopped snowing at eleven."</p>

<p>"And," supplemented Snitkin, "you can't tell by the tracks
whether the guy that made 'em left the house and came back, or came
to the house and went away, for there wasn't a single print on top
of the other."</p>

<p>Vance was standing at the window looking out.</p>

<p>"That, now, is a most interestin' point, Sergeant," he
commented. "I'd file it away along with Rex's story for prayerful
consideration." He sauntered back to the desk and looked at the
dead man thoughtfully. "No, Sergeant," he continued; "I can't
picture Chester donning gum-shoes and sneaking out into the night
on a mysterious errand. I'm afraid we'll have to find another
explanation for those footprints."</p>

<p>It's damn funny, just the same, that they should be the exact
size of these galoshes."</p>

<p>"If," submitted Markham, "the footprints were not Chester's,
then we're driven to the assumption that the murderer made
them."</p>

<p>Vance slowly took out his cigarette case.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "I think we may safely assume that."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX - THE THREE BULLETS</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, November 12th; 9 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>AT this moment Doctor Doremus, the Medical Examiner, a brisk,
nervous man with a jaunty air, was ushered in by one of the
detectives I had seen in the drawing-room. He blinked at the
company, threw his hat and coat on a chair, and shook hands with
everyone.</p>

<p>"What are your friends trying to do, Sergeant?" he asked, eyeing
the inert body in the chair. "Wipe out the whole family?" Without
waiting for an answer to his grim pleasantry he went to the windows
and threw up the shades with a clatter. "You gentlemen all through
viewing the remains? If so, I'll get to work."</p>

<p>"Go to it," said Heath. Chester Greene's body was lifted to the
bed and straightened out. "And how about the bullet, doc? Any
chance of getting it before the autopsy?"</p>

<p>"How'm I going to get it without a probe and forceps? I ask
you!" Doctor Doremus drew back the matted dressing-gown and
inspected the wound. "But I'll see what I can do." Then he
straightened up and cocked his eye facetiously at the sergeant.
"Well, I'm waiting for your usual query about the time of
death."</p>

<p>"We know it."</p>

<p>"Hah! Wish you always did. This fixing the exact time by looking
over a body is all poppycock anyway. The best we fellows can do is
to approximate it. Rigor mortis works differently in different
people. Don't ever take me too seriously, Sergeant, when I set an
exact hour for you. However, let's see..."</p>

<p>He ran his hands over the body on the bed, unflexed the fingers,
moved the head, and put his eye close to the coagulated blood about
the wound. Then he teetered on his toes, and squinted at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"How about ten hours? Say, between eleven-thirty, and midnight.
How's that?"</p>

<p>Heath laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You hit it, doc&mdash;right on the head."</p>

<p>"Well, well! Always was a good guesser." Doctor Doremus seemed
wholly indifferent.</p>

<p>Vance had followed Markham into the hall.</p>

<p>"An honest fellow, that archiater of yours. And to think he's a
public servant of our beneficent government!"</p>

<p>"There are many honest men in public office," Markham reproved
him.</p>

<p>"I know," sighed Vance. "Our democracy is still young. Give it
time."</p>

<p>Heath joined us, and at the same moment the nurse appeared at
Mrs. Greene's door. A querulous dictatorial voice issued from the
depths of the room behind her.</p>

<p>"...And you tell whoever's in charge that I want to see
him&mdash;right away, do you understand! It's an outrage, all this
commotion and excitement, with me lying here in pain trying to get
a little rest. Nobody shows me any consideration."</p>

<p>Heath made a grimace and looked toward the stairs; but Vance
took Markham's arm.</p>

<p>"Come, let's cheer up the old lady."</p>

<p>As we entered the room, Mrs. Greene, propped up as usual in bed
with a prismatic assortment of pillows, drew her shawl primly about
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" she greeted us, her expression
moderating. "I thought it was those abominable policemen making
free of my house again... What's the meaning of all this
disturbance, Mr. Markham? Nurse tells me that Chester has been
shot. Dear, dear! If people must do such things, why do they have
to come to my house and annoy a poor helpless old woman like me?
There are plenty of other places they could do their shooting in."
She appeared deeply resentful at the fact that the murderer should
have been so inconsiderate as to choose the Greene mansion for his
depredations. "But I've come to expect this sort of thing. Nobody
thinks of my feelings. And if my own children see fit to do
everything they can to annoy me, why should I expect total
strangers to show me any consideration?"</p>

<p>"When one is bent on murder, Mrs. Greene," rejoined Markham,
stung by her callousness, "one doesn't stop to think of the mere
inconvenience his crime may cause others."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," she murmured self-pityingly. "But it's all the
fault of my children. If they were what children ought to be,
people wouldn't be breaking in here trying to murder them."</p>

<p>"And unfortunately succeeding," added Markham coldly.</p>

<p>"Well, that can't be helped." She suddenly became bitter. "It's
their punishment for the way they've treated their poor old mother,
lying here for ten long years, hopelessly paralysed. And do you
think they try to make it easy for me? No! Here I must stay, day
after day, suffering agonies with my spine; and they never give me
a thought." A sly look came into her fierce old eyes. "But they
think about me sometimes. Oh, yes! They think how nice it would be
if I were out of the way. Then they'd get all my money..."</p>

<p>"I understand, madam," Markham put in abruptly, "that you were
asleep last night at the time your son met his death."</p>

<p>"Was I? Well, maybe I was. It's a wonder, though, that some one
didn't leave my door open just so I'd be disturbed."</p>

<p>"And you know no one who would have any reason to kill your
son?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? Nobody tells me anything. I'm a poor
neglected, lonely old cripple..."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't bother you any further, Mrs. Greene." Markham's
tone held something both of sympathy and consternation.</p>

<p>As we descended the stairs the nurse reopened the door we had
just closed after us, and left it ajar, no doubt in response to an
order from her patient.</p>

<p>"Not at all a nice old lady," chuckled Vance, as we entered the
drawing- room. "For a moment, Markham, I thought you were going to
box her ears."</p>

<p>"I admit I felt like it. And yet I couldn't help pitying her.
However, such utter self-concentration as hers saves one a lot of
mental anguish. She seems to regard this whole damnable business as
a plot to upset her."</p>

<p>Sproot appeared obsequiously at the door.</p>

<p>"May I bring you gentlemen some coffee?" No emotion of any kind
showed on his graven wrinkled face. The events of the past few days
seemed not to have affected him in any degree.</p>

<p>"No, we don't want coffee, Sproot," Markham told him brusquely.
"But please be good enough to ask Miss Sibella if she will come
here."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>The old man shuffled away, and a few minutes later Sibella
strolled in, smoking a cigarette, one hand in the pocket of her
vivid-green sweater- jacket. Despite her air of nonchalance her
face was pale, its whiteness contrasting strongly with the deep
crimson rouge on her lips. Her eyes, too, were slightly haggard;
and when she spoke her voice sounded forced, as if she were playing
a role against which her spirit was at odds. She greeted us
blithely enough, however.</p>

<p>"Good morning, one and all. Beastly auspices for a social call."
She sat down on the arm of a chair and swung one leg restlessly.
"Someone certainly has a grudge against us Greenes. Poor old Chet!
He didn't even die with his boots on. Felt bedroom slippers! What
an end for an outdoor enthusiast! Well, I suppose I'm invited here
to tell my story. Where do I begin?"</p>

<p>She rose, and throwing her half-burned cigarette into the grate,
seated herself in a straight-backed chair facing Markham, folding
her sinewy, tapering hands on the table before her.</p>

<p>Markham studied her for several moments.</p>

<p>"You were awake last night, reading in bed, I understand, when
the shot was fired in your brother's room."</p>

<p>"Zola's 'Nana,' to be explicit. Mother told me I shouldn't read
it; so I got it at once. It was frightfully disappointing,
though."</p>

<p>"And just what did you do after you heard the report?" continued
Markham, striving to control his annoyance at the girl's
flippancy.</p>

<p>"I put my book down, got up, donned a kimono, and listened for
several minutes at the door. Not hearing anything further, I peeked
out. The hall was dark, and the silence felt a bit spooky. I knew I
ought to go to Chet's room and inquire, in a sisterly fashion,
about the explosion; but, to tell you the truth, Mr. Markham, I was
rather cowardly. So I went&mdash;oh, well, let the truth prevail: I
<i>ran</i> up the servants' stairs and routed out our Admirable
Crichton; and together we investigated. Chet's door was unlocked,
and the fearless Sproot opened it. There sat Chet, looking as if
he'd seen a ghost; and somehow I knew he was dead. Sproot went in
and touched him, while I waited; and then we went down to the
dining-room. Sproot did some phoning, and afterward made me some
atrocious coffee. A half-hour or so later this gentleman"&mdash;she
indicated her head toward Heath&mdash;"arrived, looking
distressingly glum, and very sensibly refused a cup of Sproot's
coffee."</p>

<p>"And you heard no sound of any kind before the shot?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. Everybody had gone to bed early. The last sound I
heard in this house was mother's gentle and affectionate voice
telling the nurse she was as neglectful as the rest of us, and to
bring her morning tea at nine sharp, and not to slam the door the
way she always did.</p>

<p>"Then peace and quiet reigned until half-past eleven, when I
heard the shot in Chet's room."</p>

<p>"How long was this interregnum of quietude?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Well, mother generally ends her daily criticism of the family
around ten-thirty; so I'd say the quietude lasted about an
hour."</p>

<p>"And during that time you do not recall hearing a slight
shuffling sound in the hall? Or a door closing softly?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head indifferently, and took another
cigarette from a small amber case she carried in her
sweater-pocket.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I didn't. That doesn't mean, though, that people
couldn't have been shuffling and shutting doors all over the place.
My room's at the rear, and the noises on the river and in 52nd
Street drown out almost anything that's going on in the front of
the house."</p>

<p>Vance had gone to her and held a match to her cigarette. "I say,
you don't seem in the least worried."</p>

<p>"Oh, why worry?" She made a gesture of resignation. "If anything
is to happen to me, it'll happen, whatever I do. But I don't
anticipate an immediate demise. No one has the slightest reason for
killing me&mdash;unless, of course, it's some of my former bridge
partners. But they're all harmless persons who wouldn't be apt to
take extreme measures."</p>

<p>"Still"&mdash;Vance kept his tone inconsequential&mdash;"no one
apparently had any reason for harming your two sisters or your
brother."</p>

<p>"On that point I couldn't be altogether lucid. We Greenes don't
confide in one another. There's a beastly spirit of distrust in
this ancestral domain. We all lie to each other on general
principles. And as for secrets! Each member of the family is a kind
of Masonic Order in himself. Surely there's some reason for all
these shootings. I simply can't imagine anyone indulging himself in
this fashion for the mere purpose of pistol practice."</p>

<p>She smoked a moment pensively, and went on:</p>

<p>"Yes, there must be a motive back of it all&mdash;though for the
life of me I can't suggest one. Of course Julia was a vinegary,
unpleasant person, but she went out very little, and worked off her
various complexes on the family. And yet, she may have been leading
a double life for all I know. When these sour old maids break loose
from their inhibitions I understand they do the most utterly utter
things. But I just can't bring my mind to picture Julia with a bevy
of jealous Romeos." She made a comical grimace at the thought.
"Ada, on the other hand, is what we used to call in algebra an
unknown quantity. No one but dad knew where she came from, and he
would never tell. To be sure, she doesn't get much time to run
around&mdash;mother keeps her too busy. But she's young and
good-looking in a common sort of way"&mdash;there was a tinge of
venom in this remark&mdash;"and you can't tell what connections she
may have formed outside the sacred portals of the Greene mansion.
As for Chet, no one seemed to love him passionately. I never heard
anybody say a good word for him but the golf pro at the club, and
that was only because Chet tipped him like a parvenu. He had a
genius for antagonizing people. Several motives for the shooting
might be found in his past."</p>

<p>"I note that you've changed your ideas considerably in regard to
the culpability of Miss Ada." Vance spoke incuriously.</p>

<p>Sibella looked a little shamefaced.</p>

<p>"I did get a bit excited, didn't I?" Then a defiance came into
her voice. "But just the same, she doesn't belong here. And she's a
sneaky little cat. She'd dearly love to see us all nicely murdered.
The only person that seems to like her is cook; but then,
Gertrude's a sentimental German who likes everybody. She feeds half
the stray cats and dogs in the neighbourhood. Our rear yard is a
regular pound in summer."</p>

<p>Vance was silent for a while. Suddenly he looked up.</p>

<p>"I gather from your remarks, Miss Greene, that you now regard
the shootings as the acts of someone from the outside."</p>

<p>"Does anyone think anything else?" she asked, with startled
anxiety. "I understand there were footprints in the snow both times
we were visited. Surely they would indicate an outsider."</p>

<p>"Quite true," Vance assured her, a bit over-emphatically,
obviously striving to allay whatever fears his queries may have
aroused in her. "Those footprints undeniably indicate that the
intruder entered each time by the front door."</p>

<p>"And you are not to have any uneasiness about the future, Miss
Greene," added Markham. "I shall give orders to-day to have a
strict guard placed over the house, front and rear, until there is
no longer the slightest danger of a recurrence of what has taken
place here."</p>

<p>Heath nodded his unqualified approbation.</p>

<p>"I'll arrange for that, sir. There'll be two men guarding this
place day and night from now on."</p>

<p>"How positively thrilling!" exclaimed Sibella; but I noticed a
strange reservation of apprehension in her eyes.</p>

<p>"We won't detain you any longer, Miss Greene," said Markham,
rising. "But I'd greatly appreciate it if you would remain in your
room until our inquiries here are over. You may, of course, visit
your mother."</p>

<p>"Thanks awf'ly, but I think I'll indulge in a little lost beauty
sleep." And she left us with a friendly wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"Who do you want to see next, Mr. Markham?" Heath was on his
feet, vigorously relighting his cigar.</p>

<p>But before Markham could answer Vance lifted his hand for
silence, and leaned forward in a listening attitude.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sproot!" he called. "Step in here a moment." The old butler
appeared at once, calm and subservient, and waited with a vacuously
expectant expression.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know," said Vance, "there's not the slightest need
for you to hover solicitously amid the draperies of the hallway
while we're busy in here. Most considerate and loyal of you; but if
we want you for anything we'll ring."</p>

<p>"As you desire, sir."</p>

<p>Sproot started to go, but Vance halted him.</p>

<p>"Now that you're here you might answer one or two
questions."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"First, I want you to think back very carefully, and tell me if
you observed anything unusual when you locked up the house last
night."</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," the man answered promptly. "If I had, I would
have mentioned it to the police this morning."</p>

<p>"And did you hear any noise or movement of any kind after you
had gone to your room? A door closing, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Everything was very quiet."</p>

<p>"And what time did you actually go to sleep?</p>

<p>"I couldn't say exactly, sir. Perhaps about twenty minutes past
eleven, if I may venture to make a guess."</p>

<p>"And were you greatly surprised when Miss Sibella woke you up
and told you a shot had been fired in Mr. Chester's room?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," Sproot admitted, "I was somewhat astonished, though
I endeavoured to conceal my emotions."</p>

<p>"And doubtless succeeded admirably," said Vance dryly. "But what
I meant was this: did you not anticipate something of the kind
happening again in this house, after the other shootings?"</p>

<p>He watched the old butler sharply, but the man's lineaments were
as arid as a desert and as indecipherable as an expanse of sea.</p>

<p>"If you will pardon me, sir, for saying so, I don't know
precisely what you mean," came the colourless answer. "Had I
anticipated that Mr. Chester was to be done in, so to speak, I most
certainly would have warned him. It would have been my duty,
sir."</p>

<p>"Don't evade my question, Sproot." Vance spoke sternly. "I asked
you if you had any idea that a second tragedy might follow the
first."</p>

<p>"Tragedies very seldom come singly, sir, if I may be permitted
to say so. One never knows what will happen next. I try not to
anticipate the workings of fate, but I strive to hold myself in
readiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go away, Sproot&mdash;go quite away," said Vance. "When I
crave vague rhetoric I'll read Thomas Aquinas."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The man bowed with wooden courtesy, and left us.</p>

<p>His footsteps had scarcely died away when Doctor Doremus strode
in jauntily.</p>

<p>"There's your bullet, Sergeant." He tossed a tiny cylinder of
discoloured lead on the drawing-room table. "Nothing but dumb luck.
It entered the fifth intercostal space and travelled diagonally
across the heart, coming out in the post-axillary fold at the
anterior border of the trapezius muscle, where I could feel it
under the skin`; and I picked it out with my pen-knife."</p>

<p>"All that fancy language don't worry me," grinned Heath, "so
long's I got the bullet."</p>

<p>He picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand, his eyes
narrowed, his mouth drawn into a straight line. Then, reaching into
his waistcoat pocket, he took out two other bullets, and laid them
beside the first. Slowly he nodded, and extended the sinister
exhibits to Markham.</p>

<p>"There's the three shots that were fired in this house," he
said. "They're all .32-revolver bullets&mdash;just alike. You can't
get away from it, sir: all three people here were shot with the
same gun."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - THE CLOSING OF A DOOR</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, November 12th; 9.30 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>AS Heath spoke Sproot passed down the hall and opened the front
door, admitting Doctor Von Blon.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sproot," we heard him say in his habitually
pleasant voice. "Anything new?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I think not." The reply was expressionless. "The
District Attorney and the police are here. Let me take your coat,
sir."</p>

<p>Von Blon glanced into the drawing-room, and, on seeing us,
halted and bowed. Then he caught sight of Doctor Doremus, whom he
had met on the night of the first tragedy.</p>

<p>"Ah, good morning, doctor," he said, coming forward. "I'm afraid
I didn't thank you for the assistance you gave me with the young
lady the other night. Permit me to make amends."</p>

<p>"No thanks needed," Doremus assured him. "How's the patient
getting on?"</p>

<p>"The wound's filling in nicely. No sepsis. I'm going up now to
have a look at her." He turned inquiringly to the District
Attorney. "No objection, I suppose."</p>

<p>"None whatever, doctor," said Markham. Then he rose quickly.
"We'll come along, if you don't mind. There are a few questions I'd
like to ask Miss Ada, and it might be as well to do it while you're
present."</p>

<p>Von Blon gave his consent without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be on my way&mdash;work to do," announced Doremus
breezily. He lingered long enough, however, to shake hands with all
of us; and then the front door closed on him.</p>

<p>"We'd better ascertain if Miss Ada has been told of her
brother's death," suggested Vance, as we went up the stairs. "If
not, I think that task logically devolves on you, doctor."</p>

<p>The nurse, whom Sproot had no doubt apprised of Von Blon's
arrival, met us in the upper hall and informed us that, as far as
she knew, Ada was still ignorant of Chester's murder.</p>

<p>We found the girl sitting up in bed, a magazine lying across her
knees. Her face was still pale, but a youthful vitality shone from
her eyes, which attested to the fact that she was much stronger.
She seemed alarmed at our sudden appearance, but the sight of the
doctor tended to reassure her.</p>

<p>"How do you feel this morning, Ada?" he asked with professional
geniality. "You remember these gentlemen, don't you?"</p>

<p>She gave us an apprehensive look; then smiled faintly and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember them...Have they-found out anything
about&mdash;Julia's death?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not." Von Blon sat down beside her and took her
hand. "Something else has happened that you will have to know,
Ada." His voice was studiously sympathetic. "Last night Chester met
with an accident&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An accident&mdash;oh!" Her eyes opened wide, and a slight
tremor passed over her. "You mean..." Her voice quavered and broke.
"I know what you mean! ...Chester's dead!"</p>

<p>Von Blon cleared his throat and looked away.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ada. You must be brave and not let it&mdash;ah&mdash;upset
you too much. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was shot!" The words burst from her lips, and a look of
terror overspread her face. "Just like Julia and me." Her eyes
stared straight ahead, as if fascinated by some horror which she
alone could see.</p>

<p>Von Blon was silent, and Vance stepped to the bed.</p>

<p>"We're not going to lie to you, Miss Greene," he said softly.
"You have guessed the truth."</p>

<p>"And what about Rex&mdash;and Sibella?"</p>

<p>"They're all right," Vance assured her. "But why did you think
your brother had met the same fate as Miss Julia and yourself?"</p>

<p>She turned her gaze slowly to him.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I just felt it. Ever since I was a little
girl I've imagined horrible things happening in this house. And the
other night I felt that the time had come&mdash;oh, I don't know
how to explain it; but it was like having something happen that
you'd been expecting."</p>

<p>Vance nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"It's an unhealthy old house; it puts all sorts of weird notions
in one's head. But, of course," he added lightly, "there's nothing
supernatural about it. It's only a coincidence that you should have
felt that way and that these disasters should actually have
occurred. The police, y' know, think it was a burglar."</p>

<p>The girl did not answer, and Markham leaned forward with a
reassuring smile.</p>

<p>"And we are going to have two men guarding the house all the
time from now on," he said, "so that no one can get in who hasn't a
perfect right to be here."</p>

<p>"So you see, Ada," put in Von Blon, "you have nothing to worry
about any more. All you have to do now is to get well."</p>

<p>But her eyes did not leave Markham's face.</p>

<p>"How do you know," she asked, in a tense anxious voice, "that
the&mdash;the person came in from the outside?"</p>

<p>"We found his footprints both times on the front walk."</p>

<p>"Footprints&mdash;are you sure?" She put the question
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No doubt about them. They were perfectly plain, and they
belonged to the person who came here and tried to shoot you. Here,
Sergeant"&mdash;he beckoned to Heath&mdash;"show the young lady
that pattern."</p>

<p>Heath took the manila envelope from his pocket and extracted the
cardboard impression Snitkin had made. Ada took it in her hand and
studied it, and a little sigh of relief parted from her lips.</p>

<p>"And you notice," smiled Vance, "he didn't have very dainty
feet."</p>

<p>The girl returned the pattern to the sergeant. Her fear had left
her, and her eyes cleared of the vision that had been haunting
them.</p>

<p>"And now, Miss Greene," went on Vance, in a matter-of-fact
voice, "we want to ask a few questions. First of all: the nurse
said you went to sleep at nine o'clock last night. Is that
correct?"</p>

<p>"I pretended to, because nurse was tired and mother was
complaining a lot. But I really didn't go to sleep until hours
later."</p>

<p>"But you didn't hear the shot in your brother's room?"</p>

<p>"No. I must have been asleep by then."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything before that?"</p>

<p>"Not after the family had gone to bed and Sproot had locked
up."</p>

<p>"Were you awake very long after Sproot retired?"</p>

<p>The girl pondered a moment, frowning.</p>

<p>"Maybe an hour," she ventured finally. "But I don't know."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been much over an hour," Vance pointed out;
"for the shot was fired shortly after half past eleven. And you
heard nothing&mdash;no sound of any kind in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Why, no." The look of fright was creeping back into her face.
"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Your brother Rex," explained Vance, "said he heard a faint
shuffling sound and a door closing a little after eleven."</p>

<p>Her eyelids drooped, and her free hand tightened over the edge
of the magazine she was holding.</p>

<p>"A door closing..." She repeated the words in a voice scarcely
audible. "Oh! And Rex heard it?" Suddenly she opened her eyes and
her lips fell apart. A startled memory had taken possession of
her&mdash;a memory which quickened her breathing and filled her
with alarm. "I heard that door close, too! I remember it
now..."</p>

<p>"What door was it?" asked Vance, with subdued animation. "Could
you tell where the sound came from?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it was so soft. I'd even forgotten it until now. But I
heard it! ...Oh, what did it mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing probably." Vance assumed an air of inconsequentiality
calculated to alleviate her fears. "The wind doubtless."</p>

<p>But when we left her, after a few more questions, I noticed that
her face still held an expression of deep anxiety.</p>

<p>Vance was unusually thoughtful as we returned to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I'd give a good deal to know what that child knows or
suspects," he murmured.</p>

<p>"She's been through a trying experience," returned Markham.
"She's frightened, and she sees new dangers in everything. But she
couldn't suspect anything, or she'd be only too eager to tell
us."</p>

<p>"I wish I were sure of that."</p>

<p>The next hour or so was occupied with interrogating the two
maids and the cook. Markham cross-examined them thoroughly not only
concerning the immediate events touching upon the two tragedies,
but in regard to the general conditions in the Greene household.
Numerous family episodes in the past were gone over; and when his
inquiries were finished he had obtained a fairly good idea of the
domestic atmosphere. But nothing that could be even remotely
connected with the murders came to light. There had always been, it
transpired, an abundance of hatred and ill-feeling and vicious
irritability in the Greene mansion. The story that was unfolded by
the servants was not a pleasant one; it was a record&mdash;scrappy
and desultory, but none the less appalling&mdash;of daily clashes,
complainings, bitter words, sullen silences, jealousies and
threats.</p>

<p>Most of the details of this unnatural situation were supplied by
Hemming, the older maid. She was less ecstatic than during the
first interview, although she interspersed her remarks with
Biblical quotations and references to the dire fate which the Lord
had seen fit to visit upon her sinful employers. Nevertheless, she
painted an arresting, if overcoloured and prejudiced, picture of
the life that had gone on about her during the past ten years. But
when it came to explaining the methods employed by the Almighty in
visiting his vengeance upon the unholy Greenes, she became
indefinite and obscure. At length Markham let her go after she had
assured him that she intended to remain at her post of
duty&mdash;to be, as she expressed it, "a witness for the Lord"
when his work of righteous devastation was complete.</p>

<p>Barton, the younger maid, on the other hand, announced, in no
uncertain terms, that she was through with the Greenes for ever.
The girl was genuinely frightened, and, after Sibella and Sproot
had been consulted, she was paid her wages and told she could pack
her things. In less than half an hour she had turned in her key and
departed with her luggage. Such information as she left behind her
was largely a substantiation of Hemming's outpourings. She, though,
did not regard the two murders as the acts of an outraged God. Hers
was a more practical and mundane view.</p>

<p>"There's something awful funny going on here," she had said,
forgetting for the moment the urge of her coquettish spirits. "The
Greenes are queer people. And the servants are queer,
too&mdash;what with Mr. Sproot reading books in foreign languages,
and Hemming preaching about fire and brimstone, and cook going
around in a sort of trance muttering to herself and never answering
a civil question. And such a family!" She rolled her eyes. "Mrs.
Greene hasn't got any heart. She's a regular old witch, and she
looks at you sometimes as though she'd like to strangle you. If I
was Miss Ada I'd have gone crazy long ago. But then, Miss Ada's no
better than the rest. She acts nice and gentle like, but I've seen
her stamping up and down in her room looking like a very devil; and
once she used language to me what was that bad I put my fingers in
my ears. And Miss Sibella's a regular icicle&mdash;except when she
gets mad, and then she'd kill you if she dared, and laugh about it.
And there's been something funny about her and Mr. Chester. Ever
since Miss Julia and Miss Ada were shot they've been talking to
each other in the sneakiest way when they thought no one was
looking. And this Doctor Von Blon what comes here so much: he's a
deep one. He's been in Miss Sibella's room with the door shut lots
of times when she wasn't any more sick than you are. And Mr. Rex,
now. He's a queer man, too. I get the creeps every time he comes
near me." She shuddered by way of demonstration. "Miss Julia wasn't
as queer as the rest. She just hated everybody and was mean."</p>

<p>Barton had rambled on loquaciously with all the thoughtless
exaggeration of a gossip who felt herself outraged; and Markham had
not interrupted her. He was trying to dredge up some nugget from
the mass of her verbal silt; but when at last he sifted it all down
there remained nothing but a few shining grains of scandal.</p>

<p>The cook was even less enlightening. Taciturn by nature, she
became almost inarticulate when approached on the subject of the
crime. Her stolid exterior seemed to cloak a sullen resentment at
the fact that she should be questioned at all. In fact, as Markham
patiently pressed his examination, the impression grew on me that
her lack of responsiveness was deliberately defensive, as if she
had steeled herself to reticency. Vance, too, sensed this attitude
in her, for, during a pause in the interview, he moved his chair
about until he faced her directly.</p>

<p>"Frau Mannheim," he said, "the last time we were here you
mentioned the fact that Mr. Tobias Greene knew your husband, and
that, because of their acquaintance, you applied for a position
here when your husband died."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't I?" she asked stubbornly. "I was poor, and I
didn't have any other friends."</p>

<p>"Ah, friends!" Vance caught up the word. "And since you were
once on friendly terms with Mr. Greene, you doubtless know certain
things about his past, which may have some bearing on the present
situation; for it is not at all impossible, d' ye see, that the
crimes committed here during the past few days are connected with
matters that took place years ago. We don't know this, of course,
but we'd be very much gratified if you would try to help us in this
regard."</p>

<p>As he was speaking the woman had drawn herself up. Her hands had
tightened as they lay folded in her lap, and the muscles about her
mouth had stiffened.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything," was her only answer.</p>

<p>"How," asked Vance evenly, "do you account for the rather
remarkable fact that Mr. Greene gave orders that you were to remain
here as long as you cared to?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Greene was a very kind and generous man," she asserted, in
a flat, combative voice. "Some there were that thought him hard,
and accused him of being unjust; but he was always good to me and
mine."</p>

<p>"How well did he know Mr. Mannheim?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the woman's eyes looked blankly
ahead.</p>

<p>"He helped my husband once, when he was in trouble."</p>

<p>"How did he happen to do this?"</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then:</p>

<p>"They were in some deal together&mdash;in the old country." She
frowned and appeared uneasy.</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember. It was before I was married."</p>

<p>"And where did you first meet Mr. Greene?"</p>

<p>"At my home in New Orleans. He was there on business&mdash;with
my husband."</p>

<p>"And, I take it, he befriended you also."</p>

<p>The woman maintained a stubborn silence.</p>

<p>"A moment ago," pursued Vance, "you used the phrase 'me and
mine.'&mdash;Have you any children, Mrs. Mannheim?"</p>

<p>For the first time during the interview her face radically
changed expression. An angry gleam shone in her eyes. "No!" The
denial was like an ejaculation.</p>

<p>Vance smoked lethargically for several moments.</p>

<p>"You lived in New Orleans until the time of your employment in
this house?" he finally asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And your husband died there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That was thirteen years ago, I understand.&mdash;How long
before that had it been since you had seen Mr. Greene?"</p>

<p>"About a year."</p>

<p>"So that would be fourteen years ago?"</p>

<p>An apprehension, bordering on fear, showed through the woman's
morose calmness.</p>

<p>"And you came all the way to New York to seek Mr. Greene's
help," mused Vance. "Why were you so confident that he would give
you employment after your husband's death?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Greene was a very good man," was all she would say.</p>

<p>"He had perhaps," suggested Vance, "done some other favour for
you which made you think you could count on his
generosity&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there." Her mouth closed tightly.</p>

<p>Vance changed the subject.</p>

<p>"What do you think about the crimes that have been committed in
this house?"</p>

<p>"I don't think about them," she mumbled; but the anxiety in her
voice belied the assertion.</p>

<p>"You surely must hold some opinion, Mrs. Mannheim, having been
here so long." Vance's intent gaze did not leave the woman. "Who,
do you think, would have had any reason for wanting to harm these
people?"</p>

<p>Suddenly her self-control gave way.</p>

<p>"<i>Du Lieber Herr Jesus</i>! I don't know&mdash;I don't know!"
It was like a cry of anguish. "Miss Julia and Mr. Chester
maybe&mdash;<i>gewiss</i>, one could understand. They hated
everybody; they were hard, unloving. But little Ada&mdash;<i>der
susse Engel</i>! Why should they want to harm her!" She set her
face grimly, and slowly her expression of stolidity returned.</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" A note of sympathy was evident in Vance's voice.
After a pause he rose and went to the window. "You may return to
your room now, Frau Mannheim," he said, without turning. "We shan't
let anything further happen to little Ada."</p>

<p>The woman got up heavily and, with an uneasy glance in Vance's
direction, left the room.</p>

<p>As soon as she was out of hearing, Markham swung about.</p>

<p>"What's the use of raking up all this ancient history?" he
demanded irritably. "We're dealing with things that have taken
place within the past few days; and you waste valuable time trying
to find out why Tobias Greene hired a cook thirteen years ago."</p>

<p>"There's such a thing as cause and effect," offered Vance
mildly. "And frequently there's a dashed long interval between the
two."</p>

<p>"Granted. But what possible connection can this German cook have
with the present murders?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps none." Vance strode back across the room, his eyes on
the floor. "But, Markham old dear, nothing appears to have any
connection with this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. And, on the other hand,
everything seems to have a possible relationship. The whole house
is steeped in vague meaning. A hundred shadowy hands are pointing
to the culprit, and the moment you try to determine the direction
the hands disappear. It's a nightmare. Nothing means anything,
therefore, anything may have a meaning."</p>

<p>"My dear Vance! You're not yourself." Markham's tone was one of
annoyance and reproach. "Your remarks are worse than the obscure
ramblings of the sibyls. What if Tobias Greene did have dealings
with one Mannheim in the past? Old Tobias indulged in numerous
shady transactions, if the gossip of twenty-five or thirty years
ago can be credited.* (*I remember, back in the nineties, when I
was a schoolboy, hearing my father allude to certain picturesque
tales of Tobias Greene's escapades.) He was for ever scurrying to
the ends of the earth on some mysterious mission, and coming home
with his pockets lined. And it's common knowledge that he spent
considerable time in Germany. If you try to dig up his past for
possible explanations for the present business, you'll have your
hands full."</p>

<p>"You misconstrue my vagaries," returned Vance, pausing before
the old oil-painting of Tobias Greene over the fire-place. "I
repudiate all ambition to become the family historian of the
Greenes...Not a bad head on Tobias," he commented, adjusting his
monocle and inspecting the portrait. "An interestin' character.
Dynamic forehead, with more than a suggestion of the scholar. A
rugged, prying nose. Yes, Tobias no doubt fared forth on many an
adventurous quest. A cruel mouth, though&mdash;rather sinister, in
fact. I wish the whiskers permitted one a view of the chin. It was
round, with a deep cleft, I'd say&mdash;the substance of which
Chester's chin was but the simulacrum."</p>

<p>"Very edifying," sneered Markham. "But phrenology leaves me cold
this morning.&mdash;Tell me, Vance: are you labouring under some
melodramatic notion that old Mannheim may have been resurrected and
returned to wreak vengeance on the Greene progeny for wrongs done
him by Tobias in the dim past? I can't see any other reason for the
questions you put to Mrs. Mannheim. Don't overlook the fact,
however, that Mannheim's dead."</p>

<p>"I didn't attend the funeral." Vance sank lazily again in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Don't be so unutterably futile," slapped Markham. "What's going
through your head?"</p>

<p>"An excellent figure of speech! It expresses my mental state
perfectly. Numberless things are 'going through my head.' But
nothing remains there. My brain's a veritable sieve."</p>

<p>Heath projected himself into the discussion.</p>

<p>"My opinion is, sir, that the Mannheim angle of this affair is a
washout. We're dealing with the present, and the bird that did this
shooting is somewheres around here right now."</p>

<p>"You're probably right, Sergeant," conceded Vance. "But&mdash;my
word!&mdash;it strikes me that every angle of the case&mdash;and,
for that matter, every cusp, arc, tangent, parabola, sine, radius,
and hyperbole&mdash;is hopelessly inundated."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI - A PAINFUL INTERVIEW</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, November 12th; 11 a.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>MARKHAM glanced impatiently at his watch.</p>

<p>"It's getting late," he complained, "and I have an important
appointment at noon. I think I'll have a go at Rex Greene, and then
leave matters in your hands for the time being, Sergeant. There's
nothing much to be done here now, and your routine work must be
gone through with."</p>

<p>Heath got up gloomily.</p>

<p>"Yes; and one of the first things to be done is to go over this
house with a fine-tooth comb for that revolver. If we could find
that gun we'd be on our way."</p>

<p>"I don't want to damp your ardour, Sergeant," drawled Vance,
"but something whispers in my ear that the weapon you yearn for is
going to prove dashed elusive."</p>

<p>Heath looked depressed; he was obviously of Vance's opinion.</p>

<p>"A hell of a case, this is! Not a lead&mdash;nothing to get your
teeth in."</p>

<p>He went to the archway and yanked the bell-cord viciously. When
Sproot appeared he almost barked his demand that Mr. Rex Greene be
produced at once; and he stood looking truculently after the
retreating butler as if longing for an excuse to follow up his
order with violence.</p>

<p>Rex came in nervously, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from his
lips. His eyes were sunken; his cheeks sagged, and his short splay
fingers fidgeted with the hem of his smoking jacket, like those of
a man under the influence of hyoscine. He gave us a resentful,
half-frightened gaze, and planted himself aggressively before us,
refusing to take the seat Markham indicated. Suddenly he demanded
fiercely:</p>

<p>"Have you found out yet who killed Julia and Chester?"</p>

<p>"No," Markham admitted; "but we've taken every precaution
against any recurrence..."</p>

<p>"Precaution? What have you done?"</p>

<p>"We've stationed a man both front and rear&mdash;" A cackling
laugh cut him short.</p>

<p>"A lot of good that'll do! The person who's after us Greenes has
a key. He has a key, I tell you! And he can get in whenever he
wants to, and nobody can stop him."</p>

<p>"I think you exaggerate a little," returned Markham mildly. "In
any case, we hope to put our hands on him very soon. And that's why
I've asked you here again&mdash;it's quite possible that you can
help us."</p>

<p>"What do I know?" The man's words were defiant, and he took
several long inhalations on his cigarette, the ashes of which fell
upon his jacket unnoticed.</p>

<p>"You were asleep, I understand, when the shot was fired last
night," went on Markham's quiet voice; "but Sergeant Heath tells me
you were awake until after eleven and heard noises in the hall.
Suppose you tell us just what happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing happened!" Rex blurted. "I went to bed at half-past
ten, but I was too nervous to sleep. Then, some time later, the
moon came out and fell across the foot of the bed; and I got up and
pulled down the shade. About ten minutes later I heard a scraping
sound in the hall, and directly afterward a door closed
softly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Mr. Greene," interrupted Vance. "Can you be a
little more definite about that noise? What did it sound like?"</p>

<p>"I didn't pay any attention to it," was the whining reply. "It
might have been almost anything. It was like someone laying down a
bundle, or dragging something across the floor; or it might have
been old Sproot in his bedroom slippers, though it didn't sound
like him&mdash;that is, I didn't associate him with the sound when
I heard it."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"After that? I lay awake in bed ten or fifteen minutes longer. I
was restless and-and expectant; so I turned on the lights to see
what time it was, and smoked half a cigarette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was twenty-five minutes past eleven, I understand."</p>

<p>"That's right. Then a few minutes later I put out the light, and
must have gone right to sleep."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and Heath drew himself up aggressively.</p>

<p>"Say, Greene: know anything about fire-arms?" He shot the
question out brutally.</p>

<p>Rex stiffened. His lips sagged open, and his cigarette fell to
the floor. The muscles of his thin jowls twitched, and he glanced
menacingly at the sergeant.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The words were like a snarl; and I noticed
that his whole body was quivering.</p>

<p>"Know what became of your brother's revolver?" pursued Heath
relentlessly, thrusting out his jaw.</p>

<p>Rex's mouth was working in a paroxysm of fury and fear, but he
seemed unable to articulate.</p>

<p>"Where have you got it hidden?" Again Heath's voice sounded
harshly.</p>

<p>"Revolver?... Hidden?..." At last Rex had succeeded in
formulating his words. "You&mdash;filthy rotter! If you've got any
idea that I have the revolver, go up and tear my room apart and
look for it&mdash;and be damned to you!" His eyes flashed, and his
upper lip lifted over his teeth. But there was fright in his
attitude as well as rage.</p>

<p>Heath had leaned forward and was about to say something further,
when Vance quickly rose and laid a restraining hand on the
sergeant's arm. He was too late, however, to avoid the thing he
evidently hoped to forestall. What Heath had already said had
sufficient stimulus to bring about a terrible reaction in his
victim.</p>

<p>"What do I care what that unspeakable swine says?" he shouted,
pointing a palsied finger at the sergeant. Oaths and vituperation
welled shrilly from the twitching lips. His insensate wrath seemed
to pass all ordinary bounds. His enormous head was thrust forward
like a python's; and his face was cyanosed and contorted.</p>

<p>Vance stood poised, watching him alertly; and Markham had
instinctively moved back his chair. Even Heath was startled by
Rex's inordinate malignity.</p>

<p>What might have happened I don't know, had not Von Blon at that
moment stepped swiftly into the room and placed a restraining hand
on the youth's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Rex!" he said, in a calm, authoritative voice. "Get a grip on
yourself. You're disturbing Ada."</p>

<p>The other ceased speaking abruptly; but his ferocity of manner
did not wholly abate. He shook off the doctor's hand angrily and
swung round, facing Von Blon.</p>

<p>"What are you interfering for?" he cried. "You're always
meddling in this house, coming here when you're not sent for, and
nosing into our affairs. Mother's paralysis is only an excuse.
You've said yourself she'll never get well, and yet you keep
coming, bringing her medicine and sending bills." He gave the
doctor a crafty leer. "Oh, you don't deceive me. I know why you
come here! It's Sibella!" Again he thrust out his head and grinned
shrewdly. "She'd be a good catch for a doctor, too&mdash;wouldn't
she? Plenty of money&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted. His eyes did not leave Von Blon, but he
shrank back and the twitching of his face began once more. A
quivering finger went up; and as he spoke his voice rose
excitedly.</p>

<p>"But Sibella's money isn't enough. You want ours along with
hers. So you're arranging for her to inherit all of it. That's
it&mdash;that's it! <i>You're</i> the one who's been doing all
this... Oh, my God! You've got Chester's gun&mdash;you took it! And
you've got a key to the house&mdash;easy enough for you to have one
made. That's how you got in."</p>

<p>Von Blon shook his head sadly and smiled with rueful tolerance.
It was an embarrassing moment, but he carried it off well.</p>

<p>"Come, Rex," he said quietly, like a person speaking to a
refractory child. "You've said enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I!" cried the youth, his eyes gleaming unnaturally. "You
knew Chester had the revolver. You went camping with him the summer
he got it&mdash;he told me so the other day, after Julia was
killed." His beady little eyes seemed to stare from his head; a
spasm shook his emaciated body; and his fingers again began
worrying the hem of his jacket.</p>

<p>Von Blon stepped swiftly forward and, putting a hand on each of
his shoulders, shook him.</p>

<p>"That'll do, Rex!" The words were a sharp command. "If you carry
on this way, we'll have to lock you up in an institution."</p>

<p>The threat was uttered in what I considered an unnecessarily
brutal tone; but it had the desired effect. A haunting fear showed
in Rex's eyes. He seemed suddenly to go limp, and he docilely
permitted Von Blon to lead him from the room.</p>

<p>"A sweet specimen, that Rex," commented Vance. "Not a person one
would choose for a boon companion. Aggravated
macrocephalia&mdash;cortical irritation. But I say, Sergeant;
really, y' know, you shouldn't have prodded the lad so."</p>

<p>Heath grunted.</p>

<p>"You can't tell me that guy don't know something. And you can
bet your sweet life I'm going to search his room damn' good for
that gun."</p>

<p>"It appears to me," rejoined Vance, "he's too flighty to have
planned the massacre in this house. He might blow up under pressure
and hit somebody with a handy missile; but I doubt if he'd lay any
deep schemes and bide his time."</p>

<p>"He's good and scared about something," persisted Heath
morosely.</p>

<p>"Hasn't he cause to be? Maybe he thinks the elusive gunman
hereabouts will choose him as the next target."</p>

<p>"If there <i>is</i> another gunman, he showed damn bad taste not
picking Rex out first." It was evident the sergeant was still
smarting under the epithets that had so recently been directed at
him.</p>

<p>Von Blon returned to the drawing-room at this moment, looking
troubled.</p>

<p>"I've got Rex quieted," he said. "Gave him five grains of
luminal. He'll sleep for a few hours and wake up penitent. I've
rarely seen him quite so violent as he was to-day. He's
supersensitive&mdash;cerebral neurasthenia; and he's apt to fly off
the handle. But he's never dangerous." He scanned our faces
swiftly. "One of you gentlemen must have said something pretty
severe."</p>

<p>Heath looked sheepish. "I asked him where he'd hid the gun."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The doctor gave the sergeant a look of questioning
reproach. "Too bad! We have to be careful with Rex. He's all right
so long as he isn't opposed too strongly. But I don't just see,
sir, what your object could have been in questioning him about the
revolver. You surely don't suspect him of having had a hand in
these terrible shootings."</p>

<p>"You tell me who did the shootings, doc," retorted Heath
pugnaciously, "and then I'll tell you who I <i>don't</i>
suspect."</p>

<p>"I regret that I am unable to enlighten you." Von Blon's tone
exuded its habitual pleasantness. "But I assure you Rex had no part
in them. They're quite out of keeping with his pathologic
state."</p>

<p>"That's the defence of half the high-class killers we get the
goods on," countered Heath.</p>

<p>"I see I can't argue with you." Von Blon sighed regretfully, and
turned an engaging countenance in Markham's direction. "Rex's
absurd accusations puzzled me deeply, but, since this officer
admits he practically accused the boy of having the revolver, the
situation becomes perfectly clear. A common form of instinctive
self-protection, this attempting to shift blame on others. You can
see, of course, that Rex was merely trying to turn suspicion upon
me so as to free himself. It's unfortunate, for he and I were
always good friends. Poor Rex!"</p>

<p>"By the by, doctor," came Vance's indolent voice; "that point
about your being with Mr. Chester Greene on the camping-trip when
he first secured the gun: was that correct? Or was it merely a
fancy engendered by Rex's self-protective instinct?"</p>

<p>Von Blon smiled with faultless urbanity and, putting his head a
little on one side, appeared to recall the past.</p>

<p>"It may be correct," he admitted. "I was once with Chester on a
camping- trip. Yes, it's quite likely&mdash;though I shouldn't like
to state it definitely. It was so long ago."</p>

<p>"Fifteen years, I think, Mr. Greene said. Ah, yes&mdash;a long
time ago. <i>Eheu! fugaces, Postume, Postume, labuntur anni</i>.
It's very depressin'. And do you recall, doctor, if Mr. Greene had
a revolver along on that particular outing?"</p>

<p>"Since you mention it, I believe I do recall his having one,
though again I should choose not to be definite on the
subject."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may recollect if he used it for target practice."
Vance's tone was dulcet and uneager. "Popping away at tree-boles
and tin cans and what not, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Von Blon nodded reminiscently.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es. It's quite possible..."</p>

<p>"And you yourself may have done a bit of desult'ry popping,
what?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, I may have." Von Blon spoke musingly, like one
recalling childish pranks. "Yes, it's wholly possible."</p>

<p>Vance lapsed into a disinterested silence, and the doctor, after
a moment's hesitation, rose.</p>

<p>"I must be going, I'm afraid." And with a gracious bow he
started toward the door. "Oh, by the way," he said, pausing, "I
almost forgot that Mrs. Greene told me she desired to see you
gentlemen before you went. Forgive me if I suggest that it might be
wise to humour her. She's something of a dowager, and her
invalidism has made her rather irritable and exacting."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you mentioned Mrs. Greene, doctor." It was Vance who
spoke. "I've been intending to ask you about her. What is the
nature of her paralysis?"</p>

<p>Von Blon appeared surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, a sort of paraplegia dolorosa&mdash;that is, a paralysis
of the legs and lower part of the body, accompanied by severe pains
due to pressure of the indurations on the spinal cord and nerves.
No spasticity of the limbs has supervened, however. Came on very
suddenly without any premonitory symptoms about ten years
ago&mdash;probably the result of transverse myelitis. There's
nothing really to be done but to keep her as comfortable as
possible with symptomatic treatment, and to tone up the heart
action. A sixtieth of strychnine three times a day takes care of
the circulation."</p>

<p>"Couldn't by any chance be a hysterical akinesia?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no! There's no hysteria." Then his eyes widened in
amazement. "Oh, I see! No; there's no possibility of recovery, even
partial. It's organic paralysis."</p>

<p>"And atrophy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Muscular atrophy is now pronounced."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much." Vance lay back with half closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all.&mdash;And remember, Mr. Markham, that I always
stand ready to help in any way I can. Please don't hesitate to call
on me." He bowed again, and went out.</p>

<p>Markham got up and stretched his legs.</p>

<p>"Come; we've been summoned to appear." His facetiousness was a
patent effort to shake off the depressing gloom of the case.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene received us with almost unctuous cordiality.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd grant the request of a poor old useless cripple,"
she said, with an appealing smile; "though I'm used to being
ignored. No one pays any attention to my wishes."</p>

<p>The nurse stood at the head of the bed arranging the pillows
beneath the old lady's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is that comfortable now?" she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene made a gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>"A lot you care whether I'm comfortable or not! Why can't you
let me alone, nurse? You're always disturbing me. There was nothing
wrong with the pillows. And I don't want you in here now anyway. Go
and sit with Ada."</p>

<p>The nurse drew a long, patient breath, and went silently from
the room, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene reverted to her former ingratiating manner.</p>

<p>"No one understands my needs the way Ada does, Mr. Markham. What
a relief it will be when the dear child gets well enough to care
for me again! But I mustn't complain. The nurse does the best she
knows how, I suppose. Please sit down, gentlemen ...yet what
wouldn't I give if I could only stand up the way you can. No one
realizes what it means to be a helpless paralytic."</p>

<p>Markham did not avail himself of the invitation, but waited
until she had finished speaking and then said "Please believe that
you have my deepest sympathy, madam...You sent for me, Doctor Von
Blon said."</p>

<p>"Yes!" She looked at him calculatingly. "I wanted to ask you a
favour."</p>

<p>She paused, and Markham bowed but did not answer.</p>

<p>"I wanted to request you to drop this investigation. I've had
enough worry and disturbance as it is. But I don't count. It's the
family I'm thinking of&mdash;the good name of the Greenes." A note
of pride came into her voice. "What need is there to drag us
through the mire and make us an object of scandalous gossip for the
<i>canaille</i>? I want peace and quiet, Mr. Markham. I won't be
here much longer; and why should my house be overrun with policemen
just because Julia and Chester have&mdash;suffered their just
deserts for neglecting me and letting me suffer here alone? I'm an
old woman and a cripple, and I'm deserving of a little
consideration."</p>

<p>Her face clouded, and her voice became harsh.</p>

<p>"You haven't any right to come here and upset my house and annoy
me in this outrageous fashion! I haven't had a minute's rest since
all this excitement began, and my spine is paining me so I can
hardly breathe." She took several stertorous breaths, and her eyes
flashed indignantly. "I don't expect any better treatment from my
children&mdash;they're hard and thoughtless. But you, Mr.
Markham&mdash;an outsider, a stranger: why should you want to
torture me with all this commotion? It's
outrageous&mdash;inhuman!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry if the presence of the officers of the law in your
house disturbs you," Markham told her gravely; "but I have no
alternative. When a crime has been committed it is my duty to
investigate, and to use every means at my disposal to bring the
guilty person to justice."</p>

<p>"Justice!" The old lady repeated the word scornfully. "Justice
has already been done. I've been avenged for the treatment I've
received these many years, lying here helpless."</p>

<p>There was something almost terrifying in the woman's cruel and
unrelenting hatred of her children, and in the cold-blooded
satisfaction she seemed to take that two of them had been punished
by death. Markham, naturally sympathetic, revolted against her
attitude.</p>

<p>"However much gratification you may feel at the murder of your
son and daughter, madam," he said coldly, "it does not release me
from my duty to find the murderer. Was there anything else you
wished to speak to me about?"</p>

<p>For a while she sat silent, her face working with impotent
passion. The gaze she bent on Markham was almost ferocious. But
presently the vindictive vigilance of her eyes relaxed, and she
drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"No; you may go now. I have nothing more to say. And, anyway,
who cares about an helpless woman like me? I should have learned by
this time that nobody thinks of my comfort, lying here all alone,
unable to help myself&mdash;a nuisance to everyone..."</p>

<p>Her whining, self-pitying voice followed us as we made our
escape.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," said Vance, as we came into the lower hall,
"the Empress Dowager is not entirely devoid of reason. Her
suggestion is deserving of consideration. The clarion voice of duty
may summon you to this quest, but&mdash;my word!&mdash;whither
shall one quest? There's nothing sane in this house&mdash;nothing
that lends itself to ordin'ry normal reason. Why not take her
advice and chuck it? Even if you learn the truth, it's likely to
prove a sort of Pyrrhic vict'ry. I'm afraid it'll be more terrible
than the crimes themselves."</p>

<p>Markham did not deign to answer; he was familiar with Vance's
heresies, and he also knew that Vance himself would be the last
person to throw over an unsolved problem.</p>

<p>"We've got something to go on, Mr. Vance," submitted Heath
solemnly, but without enthusiasm. "There's those foot-tracks, for
instance; and we've got the missing' gun to find. Dubois is
upstairs now taking finger- prints. And the reports on the
servants'll be coming along soon. There's no telling what'll turn
up in a few days. I'll have a dozen men working on this case before
night."</p>

<p>"Such zeal, Sergeant! But it's in the atmosphere of this old
house&mdash;not in tangible clues&mdash;that the truth lies hidden.
It's somewhere in these old jumbled rooms; it's peering out from
dark corners and from behind doors. It's here&mdash;in this very
hall, perhaps."</p>

<p>His tone was fraught with troubled concern, and Markham looked
at him sharply.</p>

<p>"I think you're right, Vance," he muttered. "But how is one to
get at it?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, I don't know. How does one get at spectres,
anyway? I've never had much intimate intercourse with ghosts, don't
y' know."</p>

<p>"You're talking rubbish!" Markham jerked on his overcoat, and
turned to Heath. "You go ahead, Sergeant; and keep in touch with
me. If nothing develops from your inquiries, we'll discuss the next
step."</p>

<p>And he and Vance and I went out to the waiting car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII - A MOTOR RIDE</h2>

<p><b>(November 12th-November 25th.)</b>
</p>

<p>THE inquiry was pushed according to the best traditions of the
Police Department. Captain Carl Hagedorn, the fire-arms expert,
made a minute scientific examination of the bullets.* (*Captain
Hagedorn was the expert who supplied Vance with the technical data
in the Benson murder case, which made it possible for him to
establish the height of the murderer.) The same revolver, he found,
had fired all three shots: the peculiar rifling told him this; and
he was able to state that the revolver was an old Smith &amp;
Wesson of a style whose manufacture had been discontinued. But,
while these findings offered substantiation to the theory that
Chester Greene's missing gun was the one used by the murderer, they
added nothing to the facts already established or suspected. Deputy
Inspector Conrad Brenner, the burglar-tools expert, had conducted
an exhaustive examination of the scene for evidential signs of a
forced entrance, but had found no traces whatever of a
housebreaker.* (*It was Inspector Brenner who examined and reported
on the chiselled jewel-box in the "Canary" murder case.)</p>

<p>Dubois and his assistant Bellamy&mdash;the two leading
finger-print authorities of the New York Police
Department&mdash;went so far as to take finger-prints of every
member of the Greene household, including Doctor Von Blon; and
these were compared with the impressions found in the hallways and
in the rooms where the shootings had occurred. But when this
tedious process was over not an unidentified-print remained; and
all those that had been found and photographed were logically
accounted for.</p>

<p>Chester Greene's galoshes were taken to Head-quarters and turned
over to Captain Jerym, who carefully compared them with the
measurements and the patterns made by Snitkin. No new fact
concerning them, however, was discovered. The tracks in the snow,
Captain Jerym reported, had been made either by the galoshes given
him or by another pair of the exact size and last. Beyond this
statement he could not, he said, conscientiously go.</p>

<p>It was established that no one in the Greene mansion, with the
exception of Chester and Rex, owned galoshes; and Rex's were number
seven&mdash;three sizes smaller than those found in Chester's
clothes-closet. Sproot used only storm-rubbers, size eight; and
Doctor Von Blon, who affected gaiters in winter, always wore rubber
sandals during stormy weather.</p>

<p>The search for the missing revolver occupied several days. Heath
turned the task over to men trained especially in this branch of
work, and supplied them with a search-warrant in case they should
meet with any opposition. But no obstacle was put in their way. The
house was systematically ransacked from basement to attic. Even
Mrs. Greene's quarters were subjected to a search. The old lady had
at first objected, but finally gave her consent, and even seemed a
bit disappointed when the men had finished. The only room that was
not gone over was Tobias Greene's library. Owing to the fact that
Mrs. Greene never let the key go out of her possession, and had
permitted no one to enter the room since her husband's death, Heath
decided not to force the issue when she refused point-blank to
deliver the key. Every other nook and corner of the house, however,
was combed by the sergeant's men. But no sign of the revolver
rewarded their efforts.</p>

<p>The autopsies revealed nothing at variance with Doctor Doremus's
preliminary findings. Julia and Chester had each died
instantaneously from the effects of a bullet entering the heart,
shot from a revolver held at close range. No other possible cause
of death was present in either body; and there were no indications
of a struggle.</p>

<p>No unknown or suspicious person had been seen near the Greene
mansion on the night of either murder, although several people were
found who had been in the neighbourhood at the time; and a
bootmaker, who lived on the second floor of the Narcoss Flats in
53rd Street, opposite to the house, stated that he had been sitting
at his window, smoking his bedtime pipe, during the time of both
shootings, and could swear that no one had passed down that end of
the street.</p>

<p>However, the guard which had been placed over the Greene mansion
was not relaxed. Men were on duty day and night at both entrances
to the estate, and everyone entering or leaving the premises was
closely scrutinized. So close a watch was kept that strange
tradesmen found it inconvenient and at times difficult to make
ordinary deliveries.</p>

<p>The reports that were turned in concerning the servants were
unsatisfactory from the standpoint of detail; but all the facts
unearthed tended to eliminate each subject from any possible
connection with the crimes. Barton, the younger maid, who had
quitted the Greene establishment the morning after the second
tragedy, proved to be the daughter of respectable working people
living in Jersey City. Her record was good, and her companions all
appeared to be harmless members of her own class.</p>

<p>Hemming, it turned out, was a widow who, up to the time of her
employment with the Greenes, had kept house for her husband, an
iron-worker, in Altoona, Pa. She was remembered even there among
her former neighbours as a religious fanatic who had led her
husband sternly and exultantly in the narrow path of enforced
rectitude. When he was killed by a furnace explosion she declared
it was the hand of God striking him down for some secret sin. Her
associates were few; they were in the main members of a small
congregation of East Side Anabaptists.</p>

<p>The summer gardener of the Greenes&mdash;a middle-aged Pole
named Krimski&mdash;was discovered in a private saloon in Harlem,
well under the benumbing influence of synthetic whisky&mdash;a
state of beatific lassitude he had maintained, with greater or
lesser steadfastness, since the end of summer. He was at once
eliminated from police consideration.</p>

<p>The investigation into the habits and associates of Mrs.
Mannheim and Sproot brought nothing whatever to light. Indeed, the
habits of these two were exemplary, and their contacts with the
outside world so meagre as to be regarded as almost non-existent.
Sproot had no visible friends, and his acquaintances were limited
to an English valet in Park Avenue and the trades-people of the
neighbourhood. He was solitary by nature, and what few recreations
he permitted himself were indulged in unaccompanied. Mrs. Mannheim
had rarely left the premises of the Greene house since she had
taken up her duties there at the time of her husband's death, and
apparently knew no one in New York outside of the household.</p>

<p>These reports dashed whatever hopes Sergeant Heath may have
harboured of finding a solution to the Greene mystery by way of a
possible accomplice in the house itself.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to give up the idea of an inside job," he
lamented one morning in Markham's office a few days after the
shooting of Chester Greene.</p>

<p>Vance, who was present, eyed him lazily.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say that, don't y' know, Sergeant. On the contrary,
it was indubitably an inside job, though not just the variety you
have in mind."</p>

<p>"You mean you think some member of the family did it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps: something rather along that line."</p>

<p>Vance drew on his cigarette thoughtfully. "But that's not
exactly what I meant. It's a situation, a set of
conditions&mdash;an atmosphere, let us say&mdash;that's guilty. A
subtle and deadly poison is responsible for the crimes. And that
poison is generated in the Greene mansion."</p>

<p>"A swell time I'd have trying to arrest an atmosphere&mdash;or a
poison either, for the matter of that," snorted Heath.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a flesh-and-blood victim awaiting your manacles
somewhere, Sergeant&mdash;the agent, so to speak, of the
atmosphere."</p>

<p>Markham, who had been conning the various reports of the case,
sighed heavily, and settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish to Heaven," he interposed bitterly, "that he'd
give us some hint as to his identity. The papers are at it hammer
and tongs. There's been another delegation of reporters here this
morning."</p>

<p>The fact was that rarely had there been in New York's
journalistic history a case which had so tenaciously seized upon
the public imagination. The shooting of Julia and Ada Greene had
been treated sensationally but perfunctorily; but after Chester
Greene's murder an entirely different spirit animated the newspaper
stories. Here was something romantically sinister&mdash;something
which brought back forgotten pages of criminal history.* (*Among
the famous cases mentioned as being in some manner comparable to
the Greene shootings were the mass murders of Landru, Jean-Baptiste
Troppmann, Fritz Haarmann and Mrs. Belle Gunness; the tavern
murders of the Benders; the Van der Linden poisonings in Holland;
the Bela Kiss tin-cask stranglings; the Rugeley murders of Doctor
William Palmer; and the beating to death of Benjamin Nathan.)
Columns were devoted to accounts of the Greene family history.
Genealogical archives were delved into for remote tit-bits. Old
Tobias Greene's record was raked over, and stories of his early
life became the common property of the man in the street. Pictures
of all the members of the Greene family accompanied these
spectacular tales; and the Greene mansion itself, photographed from
every possible angle, was used regularly to illustrate the
flamboyant accounts of the crimes so recently perpetrated
there.</p>

<p>The story of the Greene murders spread over the entire country,
and even the press of Europe found space for it. The tragedy, taken
in connection with the social prominence of the family and the
romantic history of its progenitors, appealed irresistibly to the
morbidity and the snobbery of the public.</p>

<p>It was natural that the police and the District Attorney's
office should be hounded by the representatives of the press; and
it was also natural that both Heath and Markham should be sorely
troubled by the fact that all their efforts to lay hands on the
criminal had come to naught. Several conferences had been called in
Markham's office, at each of which the ground had been carefully
reploughed; but not one helpful suggestion had been turned up. Two
weeks after the murder of Chester Greene the case began to take on
the aspect of a stalemate.</p>

<p>During that fortnight, however, Vance had not been idle. The
situation had caught and held his interest, and not once had he
dismissed it from his mind since that first morning when Chester
Greene had applied to Markham for help. He said little about the
case, but he had attended each of the conferences; and from his
casual comments I knew he was both fascinated and perplexed by the
problem it presented.</p>

<p>So convinced was he that the Greene mansion itself held the
secret to the crimes enacted there that he had made it a point to
call at the house several times without Markham. Markham, in fact,
had been there but once since the second crime. It was not that he
was shirking his task. There was, in reality, little for him to do;
and the routine duties of his office were particularly heavy at
that time.* (*The famous impure-milk scandal was then to the fore,
and the cases were just appearing on the court calendar. Also, at
that time, there was an anti-gambling campaign in progress in New
York; and the District Attorney's office had charge of all the
prosecutions.)</p>

<p>Sibella had insisted that the funerals of Julia and Chester be
combined in one service, which was held in the private chapel of
Malcomb's Undertaking Parlours. Only a few intimate acquaintances
were notified (though a curious crowd gathered outside the
building, attracted by the sensational associations of the
obsequies); and the interment at Woodlawn Cemetery was strictly
private. Doctor Von Blon accompanied Sibella and Rex to the chapel,
and sat with them during the services. Ada, though improving
rapidly, was still confined to the house; and Mrs. Greene's
paralysis of course made her attendance impossible, although I
doubt if she would have gone in any case, for when the suggestion
was made that the services be held at home she had vetoed it
emphatically.</p>

<p>It was on the day after the funeral that Vance paid his first
unofficial visit to the Greene mansion. Sibella received him
without any show of surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come," she greeted him, almost gaily. "I
knew you weren't a policeman the first time I saw you. Imagine a
policeman smoking R&eacute;gie cigarettes! And I'm dying for
someone to talk to. Of course, all the people I know avoid me now
as they would a pestilence. I haven't had an invitation since Julia
passed from this silly life. Respect for the dead, I believe they
call it. And just when I most need diversion!"</p>

<p>She rang for the butler and ordered tea.</p>

<p>"Sproot makes much better tea than he does coffee, thank
Heaven!" she ran on, with a kind of nervous detachment. "What a
sweet day we had yesterday! Funerals are hideous farces. I could
hardly keep a straight face when the officiating reverend doctor
began extolling the glories of the departed. And all the
time&mdash;poor man&mdash;he was eaten up with morbid curiosity.
I'm sure he enjoyed it so much that he wouldn't complain if I
entirely forgot to send him a cheque for his kind words..."</p>

<p>The tea was served, but before Sproot had withdrawn Sibella
turned to him pettishly.</p>

<p>"I simply can't stand any more tea. I want a Scotch high-ball."
She lifted her eyes to Vance inquiringly, but he insisted that he
preferred tea; and the girl drank her high-ball alone.</p>

<p>"I crave stimulation these days," she explained airily. "This
moated grange, so to speak, is getting on my young and fretful
nerves. And the burden of being a celebrity is quite overwhelming.
I really have become a celebrity, you know. In fact, all the
Greenes are quite famous now. I never imagined a mere murder or two
could give a family such positively irrational prominence. I'll
probably be in Hollywood yet."</p>

<p>She gave a laugh which struck me as a trifle strained. "It's
just too jolly! Even mother is enjoying it. She gets all the papers
and reads every word that's written about us&mdash;which is a
blessing, let me tell you. She's almost forgotten to find fault;
and I haven't heard a word about her spine for days. The Lord
tempers the wind&mdash;or is it something about an ill wind I'm
trying to quote? I always get my classical references
confused..."</p>

<p>She ran on in this flippant vein for half an hour or so. But
whether her callousness was genuine or merely a brave attempt to
counteract the pall of tragedy that hung over her I couldn't make
out. Vance listened, interested and amused. He seemed to sense a
certain emotional necessity in the girl to relieve her mind; but
long before we went away he had led the conversation round to
commonplace matters. When we rose to go Sibella insisted that we
come again.</p>

<p>"You're so comforting, Mr. Vance," she said. "I'm sure you're
not a moralist; and you haven't once condoled with me over my
bereavements. Thank Heaven, we Greenes have no relatives to swoop
down on us and bathe us in tears. I'm sure I'd commit suicide if we
had."</p>

<p>Vance and I called twice more within the week, and were received
cordially. Sibella's high spirits were always the same. If she felt
the horror that had descended so suddenly and unexpectedly upon her
home, she managed to hide it well. Only in her eagerness to talk
freely and in her exaggerated efforts to avoid all sign of mourning
did I sense any effects on her of the terrible experience she had
been through.</p>

<p>Vance on none of his visits referred directly to the crimes; and
I became deeply puzzled by his attitude. He was trying to learn
something&mdash;of that I was positive. But I failed to see what
possible progress he could make by the casual methods he was
pursuing. Had I not known him better I might have suspected him of
being personally interested in Sibella; but such a notion I
dismissed simultaneously with its formulation. I noticed, however,
that after each call he became unaccountably pensive; and one
evening, after we had had tea with Sibella, he sat for an hour
before the fire in his living-room without turning a page of the
volume of da Vinci's "Trattato della Pittura" which lay open before
him.</p>

<p>On one of his visits to the Greene mansion he had met and talked
with Rex. At first the youth had been surly and resentful of our
presence; but before we went away he and Vance were discussing such
subjects as Einstein's general-relativity theory, the
Moulton-Chamberlin planetesimal hypothesis, and Poincar&eacute;'s
science of numbers, on a plane quite beyond the grasp of a mere
layman like myself. Rex had warmed up to the discussion in an
almost friendly manner, and at parting had even offered his hand
for Vance to shake.</p>

<p>On another occasion Vance had asked Sibella to be permitted to
pay his respects to Mrs. Greene. His apologies to her&mdash;which
he gave a semi- official flavour&mdash;for all the annoyance caused
by the police immediately ingratiated him in the old lady's good
graces. He was most solicitous about her health, and asked her
numerous questions regarding her paralysis-the nature of her spinal
pains and the symptoms of her restlessness. His air of sympathetic
concern drew from her an elaborate and detailed jeremiad.</p>

<p>Twice Vance talked to Ada, who was now up and about, but with
her arm still in a sling. For some reason, however, the girl
appeared almost <i>farouche</i> when approached by him. One day
when we were at the house Von Blon called, and Vance seemed to go
out of his way to hold him in conversation.</p>

<p>As I have said, I could not fathom his motive in all this
apparently desultory social give-and-take. He never broached the
subject of the tragedies except in the most indirect way; he
appeared, rather, to avoid the topic deliberately. But I did notice
that, however casual his manner, he was closely studying everyone
in the house. No nuance of tone, no subtlety of reaction, escaped
him. He was, I knew, storing away impressions, analyzing minute
phases of conduct, and probing delicately into the psychological
mainsprings of each person he talked to.</p>

<p>We had called perhaps four or five times at the Greene mansion
when an episode occurred which must be recounted here in order to
clarify a later development of the case. I thought little of it at
the time, but, though seemingly trivial, it was to prove of the
most sinister significance before many days had passed. In fact,
had it not been for this episode there is no telling to what awful
lengths the gruesome tragedy of the Greenes might have gone; for
Vance&mdash;in one of those strange mental flashes of his which
always seemed wholly intuitive but were, in reality, the result of
long, subtle reasoning&mdash;remembered the incident at a crucial
moment, and related it swiftly to other incidents which in
themselves appeared trifling, but which, when co-ordinated, took on
a tremendous and terrible importance.</p>

<p>During the second week following Chester Greene's death the
weather moderated markedly. We had several beautiful clear days,
crisp, sunshiny, and invigorating. The snow had almost entirely
disappeared, and the ground was firm, without any of the slush that
usually follows a winter thaw. On Thursday Vance and I called at
the Greene mansion earlier than on any previous visit, and we saw
Doctor Von Blon's car parked before the gate.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance observed. "I do hope the family Paracelsus is not
departing immediately. The man lures me; and his exact relationship
to the Greene family irks my curiosity."</p>

<p>Von Blon, as a matter of fact, was preparing to go as we entered
the hallway. Sibella and Ada, bundled in their furs, stood just
behind him; and it was evident that they were accompanying him.</p>

<p>"It was such a pleasant day," explained Von Blon, somewhat
disconcertedly, "I thought I'd take the girls for a drive."</p>

<p>"And you and Mr. Van Dine must come with us," chimed in Sibella,
smiling hospitably at Vance. "If the doctor's temperamental driving
affects your heart action, I promise to take the wheel myself. I'm
really an expert chauffeur."</p>

<p>I surprised a look of displeasure on Von Blon's face; but Vance
accepted the invitation without demur; and in a few moments we were
riding across town, comfortably installed in the doctor's big
Daimler, with Sibella in front, next to the driver's seat, and Ada
between Vance and me in the tonneau.</p>

<p>We went north on Fifth Avenue, entered Central Park, and,
emerging at the 72nd Street entrance, headed for Riverside Drive.
The Hudson River lay like a sheet of blue-grass below us, and the
Jersey palisades in the still clear air of early afternoon were as
plainly etched as a Degas drawing. At Dyckman Street we went up
Broadway, and turned west on the Spuyten Duyvil Road to Palisade
Avenue overlooking the old wooded estates along the water. We
passed through a private roadway lined with hedges, turned inland
again to Sycamore Avenue, and came out on the Riverdale Road. We
drove through Yonkers, up North Broadway into Hastings, and then
skirted the Longue Vue Hill. Beyond Dobbs Ferry we entered the
Hudson Road, and at Ardsley again turned west beside the Country
Club golf- links, and came out on the river level. Beyond the
Ardsley Station a narrow dirt road ran up the hill along the water;
and, instead of following the main highway to the east, we
continued up this little-used road, emerging on a kind of plateau
of wild pasture-land.</p>

<p>A mile or so farther on&mdash;about midway between Ardsley and
Tarrytown&mdash;a small dun hill, like a boulder, loomed directly
in our path. When we came to the foot of it, the road swung sharply
to the west along a curved promontory. The turn was narrow and
dangerous, with the steep upward slope of the hill on one side and
the precipitous, rocky descent into the river on the other. A
flimsy wooden fence had been built along the edge of the drop,
though what possible protection it could be to a reckless or even
careless driver I could not see.</p>

<p>As we came to the outermost arc of the little detour Von Blon
brought the car to a stop, the front wheels pointing directly
toward the precipice. A magnificent vista stretched before us. We
could look up and down the Hudson for miles. And there was a sense
of isolation about the spot, for the hill behind us completely shut
off the country inland.</p>

<p>We sat for several moments taking in the unusual view. Then
Sibella spoke. Her voice was whimsical, but a curious note of
defiance informed it.</p>

<p>"What a perfectly ripping spot for a murder!" she exclaimed,
leaning over and looking down the steep slope of the bluff. "Why
run the risk of shooting people when all you have to do is to take
them for a ride to this snug little shelf, jump from the car, and
let them topple&mdash;machine and all&mdash;over the precipice?
Just another unfortunate auto accident&mdash;and no one the wiser!
...Really, I think I'll take up crime in a serious way."</p>

<p>I felt a shudder pass over Ada's body, and I noticed that her
face paled. Sibella's comments struck me as particularly heartless
and unthinking in view of the terrible experience through which her
sister had so recently passed. The cruelty of her words evidently
struck the doctor also, for he turned toward her with a look of
consternation.</p>

<p>Vance glanced quickly at Ada, and then attempted to banish the
embarrassment of the tense silence by remarking lightly:</p>

<p>"We refuse to take alarm, however, Miss Greene; for no one, d'ye
see, could seriously consider a criminal career on a day as perfect
as this. Taine's theory of climatic influences is most comfortin'
in moments like this."</p>

<p>Von Blon said nothing, but his reproachful eyes did not leave
Sibella's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us go back!" cried Ada pitifully, nestling closer under
the lap- robe, as if the air had suddenly become chill.</p>

<p>Without a word Von Blon reversed the machine; and a moment later
we were on our way back to the city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII - THE THIRD TRAGEDY</h2>

<p><b>(November 28th and November 30th)</b>
</p>

<p>THE following Sunday evening, November 28th, Markham invited
Inspector Moran and Heath to the Stuyvesant Club for an informal
conference. Vance and I had dined with him and were present when
the two police officials arrived. We retired to Markham's favourite
corner of the club's lounge- room; and soon a general discussion of
the Greene murders was under way.</p>

<p>"I'm rather amazed," said the inspector, his voice even quieter
than usual, "that nothing has turned up to focus the inquiry. In
the average murder case there are numerous lines to be explored,
even if the right one is not hit upon immediately. But in this
affair there appears to be nothing whatever on which to
concentrate."</p>

<p>"That fact in itself, I should say," rejoined Vance,
"constitutes a distinguishing characteristic of the case which
shouldn't be overlooked, don't y' know. It's a clue of vital
importance, and if only we could probe its significance I think
we'd be on our way toward a solution."</p>

<p>"A fine clue that is!" grumbled Heath. "'What clue have you got,
Sergeant?' asks the inspector. 'Oh, a bully clue,' says I. 'And
what is it?' asks the inspector. 'The fact that there ain't
<i>nothing</i> to go on!' says I."</p>

<p>Vance smiled.</p>

<p>"You're so literal, Sergeant! What I was endeavouring to
express, in my purely laic capacity, was this: when there are no
clues in a case&mdash;no <i>points de d&eacute;part</i>, no
telltale indications&mdash;one is justified in regarding everything
as a clue&mdash;or, rather, as a factor in the puzzle. To be sure,
the great difficulty lies in fitting together these apparently
inconsequential pieces. I rather think we've at least a hundred
clues in our possession; but none of them has any meaning so long
as it's unrelated to the others. This affair is like one of those
silly word- puzzles where all the letters are redistributed into a
meaningless jumble. The task for the solver is to rearrange them
into an intelligible word or sentence."</p>

<p>"Could you name just eight or ten of those hundred clues for
me?" Heath requested ironically. "I sure would like to get busy on
something definite."</p>

<p>"You know 'em all, Sergeant." Vance refused to fall in with the
other's bantering manner. "I'd say that practically everything that
has happened since the first alarm reached you might be regarded as
a clue."</p>

<p>"Sure!" The sergeant had lapsed again into sullen gloom. "The
footprints, the disappearance of the revolver, that noise Rex heard
in the hall. But we've run all those leads up against a blank
wall."</p>

<p>"Oh, those things!" Vance sent a ribbon of blue smoke upward.
"Yes, they're clues of a kind. But I was referring more
specifically to the conditions existing at the Greene
mansion&mdash;the organisms of the environment there&mdash;the
psychological elements of the situation."</p>

<p>"Don't get off again on your metaphysical theories and esoteric
hypotheses," Markham interjected tartly. "We've either got to find
a practical <i>modus operandi</i>, or admit ourselves beaten."</p>

<p>"But, Markham old man, you're beaten on the face of it unless
you can put your chaotic facts into some kind of order. And the
only way you'll be able to do that is by a process of prayerful
analysis."</p>

<p>"You give me some facts that've got some sense to 'em,"
challenged Heath, "and I'll put 'em together soon enough."</p>

<p>"The sergeant's right," was Markham's comment. "You'll admit
that as yet we haven't any significant facts to work with."</p>

<p>"Oh, there'll be more."</p>

<p>Inspector Moran sat up, and his eyes narrowed. "What do you mean
by that, Mr. Vance?" It was obvious that the remark had struck some
chord of agreement in him.</p>

<p>"The thing isn't over yet." Vance spoke with unwonted
sombreness. "The picture's unfinished. There's more tragedy to come
before the monstrous canvas is rounded out. And the hideous thing
about it is that there's no way of stopping it. Nothing now can
halt the horror that's at work. It's got to go on."</p>

<p>"You feel that, too!" The inspector's voice was off its normal
pitch. "By God! This is the first case I've ever had that
frightened me."</p>

<p>"Don't forget, sir," argued Heath, but without conviction, "that
we got men watching the house day and night."</p>

<p>"There's no security in that, Sergeant," asserted Vance. "The
killer is already in the house. He's part of the deadly atmosphere
of the place. He's been there for years, nourished by the toxins
that seep from the very stones of the walls."</p>

<p>Heath looked up.</p>

<p>"A member of the family? You said that once before."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But someone who has been tainted by the
perverted situation that grew out of old Tobias's patriarchal
ideas."</p>

<p>"We might manage to put some one in the house to keep an eye on
things," suggested the Inspector. "Or, there's a possibility of
prevailing upon the members of the family to separate and move to
other quarters."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"A spy in the house would be useless. Isn't everyone there a spy
now, watching all the others, and watching them with fear and
suspicion? And as for dispersing the family: not only would you
find old Mrs. Greene, who holds the purse-strings, an adamantine
obstacle, but you'd meet all manner of legal complications as a
result of Tobias's will. No one gets a dollar. I understand, who
doesn't remain in the mansion until the worms have ravaged his
carcass for a full quarter of a century. And even if you succeeded
in scattering the remnants of the Greene line, and locked up the
house, you wouldn't have stamped out the killer. And there'll be no
end of this thing until a purifying stake has been driven through
his heart."</p>

<p>"Are you going in now for vampirism, Vance?" The case had
exacerbated Markham's nerves. "Shall we draw an enchanted ring
around the house and hang garlic on the door?"</p>

<p>Markham's extravagant comment of harassed discouragement seemed
to express the hopeless state of mind of all of us, and there was a
long silence. It was Heath who first came back to a practical
consideration of the matter in hand.</p>

<p>"You spoke, Mr. Vance, about old man Greene's will. And I've
been thinking that, if we knew all the terms of that will, we might
find something to help us. There's millions in the estate, all of
it left, I hear, to the old lady. What I'd like to know is, has she
a full right to dispose of it any way she likes? And I'd also like
to know what kind of a will the old lady herself has made. With all
that money at stake, we might get on to a motive of some kind."</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;quite!" Vance looked at Heath with undisguised
admiration. "That's the most sensible suggestion that's been made
thus far. I salute you, Sergeant. Yes, old Tobias's money may have
some bearing on the case. Not a direct bearing, perhaps; but the
influence of that money&mdash;the subterranean power it
exerts&mdash;is undoubtedly tangled up in these crimes.&mdash;How
about it, Markham? How does one go about finding out about other
people's wills?"</p>

<p>Markham pondered the point.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there'd be any great difficulty in the present
instance. Tobias Greene's will is a matter of record, of course,
though it might take some little time to look it up in the
Surrogate's files; and I happen to know old Buckway, the senior
partner of Buckway &amp; Aldine, the Greene solicitors. I see him
here at the club occasionally, and I've done one or two small
favours for him. I think I could induce him to tell me
confidentially the terms of Mrs. Greene's will. I'll see what can
be done to-morrow."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the conference broke up and we went home.</p>

<p>"I fear those wills are not going to help much," Vance remarked,
as he sipped his high-ball before the fire late that night. "Like
everything else in this harrowin' case, they'll possess some
significance that can't be grasped until they're fitted into the
final picture."</p>

<p>He rose and, going to the bookshelves, took down a small
volume.</p>

<p>"And now I think I'll erase the Greenes from my mind <i>pro
tempore</i>, and dip into the 'Satyricon.' The fusty historians
pother frightfully about the reasons for the fall of Rome, whereas
the eternal answer is contained in Petronius's imperishable classic
of that city's decadence."</p>

<p>He settled himself and turned the pages of his book. But there
was no concentration in his attitude, and his eyes wandered
constantly from the text.</p>

<p>Two days later&mdash;on Tuesday, November 30th&mdash;Markham
telephoned Vance shortly after ten o'clock in the morning, and
asked him to come at once to the office. Vance was preparing to
attend an exhibition of negro sculpture at the Modern Gallery, but
this indulgence was postponed in view of the District Attorney's
urgent call; and in less than half an hour we were at the Criminal
Courts Building.* (*The Modern Gallery was then under the direction
of Marius de Zayas, whose collection of African statuette-fetiches
was perhaps the finest in America.)</p>

<p>"Ada Greene called up this morning, and asked to see me without
delay," explained Markham. "I offered to send Heath out and, if
necessary, to come myself later on. But she seemed particularly
anxious that I shouldn't do that, and insisted on coming here: said
it was a matter she could speak of more freely away from the house.
She seemed somewhat upset, so I told her to come ahead. Then I
phoned you and notified Heath."</p>

<p>Vance settled himself and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder she'd grasp at any chance to shake the
atmosphere of her surroundings. And, Markham, I've come to the
conclusion that girl knows something that would be highly valuable
to our inquiry. It's quite possible, don't y' know, that she's now
reached a point where she'll tell us what's on her mind."</p>

<p>As he spoke the sergeant was announced, and Markham briefly
explained the situation to him.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Heath gloomily, but with interest, "like
it was our only chance of getting a lead. We haven't learned
anything ourselves that's worth a damn, and unless somebody spills
a few suggestions we're up against it."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ada Greene was ushered into the office. Though
her pallor had gone and her arm was no longer in a sling, she still
gave one the impression of weakness. But there was none of the
tremulousness or shrinking in her bearing that had heretofore
characterized her.</p>

<p>She sat down before Markham's desk, and for a while frowned up
at the sunlight, as if debating how to begin.</p>

<p>"It's about Rex, Mr. Markham," she said finally. "I really don't
know whether I should have come here or not&mdash;it may be very
disloyal of me..." She gave him a look of appealing indecision.
"Oh, tell me: if a person knows something&mdash;something bad and
dangerous&mdash;about someone very close and very dear, should that
person tell, when it might make terrible trouble?"</p>

<p>"That all depends," Markham answered gravely. "In the present
circumstances, if you know anything that might be helpful to a
solution of the murder of your brother and sister, it's your duty
to speak."</p>

<p>"Even if the thing were told me in confidence?" she persisted.
"And the person were a member of my family?"</p>

<p>"Even under those conditions, I think." Markham spoke
paternally. "Two terrible crimes have been committed, and nothing
should be held back that might bring the murderer to
justice&mdash;whoever he may be."</p>

<p>The girl averted her troubled face for a moment. Then she lifted
her head with sudden resolution.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you... You know you asked Rex about the shot in my
room, and he told you he didn't hear it. Well, he confided in me,
Mr. Markham; and he <i>did</i> hear the shot. But he was afraid to
admit it lest you might think it funny he didn't get up and give
the alarm."</p>

<p>"Why do you think he remained in bed silent, and pretended to
everyone he was asleep?" Markham attempted to suppress the keen
interest the girl's information had roused in him.</p>

<p>"That's what I don't understand. He wouldn't tell me. But he had
some reason&mdash;I know he did!&mdash;some reason that terrified
him. I begged him to tell me, but the only explanation he gave was
that the shot was not all he heard..."</p>

<p>"Not all!" Markham spoke with ill-concealed excitement. "He
heard something else that, you say, terrified him? But why
shouldn't he have told us about it?"</p>

<p>"That's the strange part of it. He got angry when I asked him.
But there's something he knows&mdash;some awful secret; I feel sure
of it... Oh, maybe I shouldn't have told you. Maybe it will get Rex
into trouble. But I felt that you ought to know because of the
frightful things that have happened. I thought perhaps you could
talk to Rex and make him tell you what's on his mind."</p>

<p>Again she looked beseechingly at Markham, and there was the
anxiety of a vague fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do wish you'd ask him&mdash;and try to find out," she
went on, in a pleading tone. "I'd feel&mdash;safer
if&mdash;if..."</p>

<p>Markham nodded and patted her hand.</p>

<p>"We'll try to make him talk."</p>

<p>"But don't try at the house," she said quickly. "There are
people&mdash; things&mdash;around; and Rex would be too frightened.
Ask him to come here, Mr. Markham. Get him away from that awful
place, where he can talk without being afraid that someone's
listening. Rex is home now. Ask him to come here. Tell him I'm
here, too. Maybe I can help you reason with him... Oh, do this for
me, Mr. Markham!"</p>

<p>Markham glanced at the clock and ran his eye over his
appointment-pad. He was, I knew, as anxious as Ada to have Rex on
the carpet for a questioning; and, after a momentary hesitation, he
picked up the telephone-receiver and had Swacker put him through to
the Greene mansion. From what I heard of the conversation that
ensued, it was plain that he experienced considerable difficulty in
urging Rex to come to the office, for he had to resort to a veiled
threat of summary legal action before he finally succeeded.</p>

<p>"He evidently fears some trap," commented Markham thoughtfully,
replacing the receiver. "But he has promised to get dressed
immediately and come."</p>

<p>A look of relief passed over the girl's face.</p>

<p>"There's one other thing I ought to tell you," she said
hurriedly: "though it may not mean anything. The other night, in
the rear of the lower hall by the stairs, I picked up a piece of
paper&mdash;like a leaf torn from a notebook. And there was a
drawing on it of all our bedrooms upstairs with four little crosses
marked in ink-one at Julia's room, one at Chester's, one at Rex's,
and one at mine. And down in the corner were several of the
queerest signs, or pictures. One was a heart with three nails in
it; and one looked like a parrot. Then there was a picture of what
seemed to be three little stones with a line under them..."</p>

<p>Heath suddenly jerked himself forward, his cigar halfway to his
lips.</p>

<p>"A parrot, and three stones! ...And say, Miss Greene, was there
an arrow with numbers on it?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she answered eagerly. "That was there, too."</p>

<p>Heath put the cigar in his mouth and chewed on it with vicious
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That means something, Mr. Markham," he proclaimed, trying to
keep the agitation out of his voice. "Those are all
symbols&mdash;graphic signs, they're called&mdash;of Continental
crooks, German or Austrian mostly."</p>

<p>"The stones, I happen to know," put in Vance, represent the idea
of the martyrdom of Saint Stephen, who was stoned to death. They're
the emblem of Saint Stephen, according to the calendar of the
Styrian peasantry."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that, sir," answered Heath. "But I
know that European crooks use those signs."</p>

<p>"Oh, doubtless. I ran across a number of 'em when I was looking
up the emblematic language of the gipsies. A fascinatin' study."
Vance seemed uninterested in Ada's discovery.</p>

<p>"Have you this paper with you, Miss Greene?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>The girl was embarrassed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," she apologized. "I didn't think it was
important. Should I have brought it?"</p>

<p>"Did you destroy it?" Heath put the question excitedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have it safely. I put it away..."</p>

<p>"We gotta have that paper, Mr. Markham." The sergeant had risen
and come toward the district attorney's desk. "It may be just the
lead we're looking for."</p>

<p>"If you really want it so badly," said Ada, "I can 'phone Rex to
bring it with him. He'll know where to find it if I explain."</p>

<p>"Right That'll save me a trip." Heath nodded to Markham. "Try to
catch him before he leaves, sir."</p>

<p>Taking up the telephone, Markham again directed Swacker to get
Rex on the wire. After a brief delay the connection was made and he
handed the instrument to Ada.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Rex dear," she said. "Don't scold me, for there's
nothing to worry about... What I wanted of you is this: in our
private mail-box you'll find a sealed envelope of my personal blue
stationery. Please get it and bring it with you to Mr. Markham's
office. And don't let anyone see you take it... That's all, Rex.
Now, hurry, and we'll have lunch together downtown."</p>

<p>"It will be at least half an hour before Mr. Greene can get
here," said Markham, turning to Vance; "and as I've a waiting-room
full of people, why don't you and Van Dine take the young lady to
the Stock Exchange and show her how the mad brokers disport
themselves. How would you like that, Miss Greene?"</p>

<p>"I'd love it!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"Why not go along too, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Me!" Heath snorted. "I get excitement enough. I'll run over and
talk to the Colonel for a while."* (*Colonel Benjamin Hanlon, one
of the Department's greatest authorities on extradition, was then
the commanding officer of the Detective Division attached to the
District Attorney's office, with quarters in the Criminal Courts
Building.)</p>

<p>Vance and Ada and I motored the few blocks to 18, Broad Street,
and, taking the elevator, passed through the reception-room (where
uniformed attendants peremptorily relieved us of our wraps), and
came out upon the visitors' gallery overlooking the floor of the
Exchange. There was an unusually active market that day. The
pandemonium was almost deafening, and the feverish activity about
the trading-posts resembled the riots of an excited mob. I was too
familiar with the sight to be particularly impressed; and Vance,
who detested noise and disorder, looked on with an air of bored
annoyance. But Ada's face lighted up at once. Her eyes sparkled and
the blood rushed to her cheeks. She gazed over the railing in a
thrall of fascination.</p>

<p>"And now you see, Miss Greene, how foolish men can be," said
Vance.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's wonderful!" she answered. "They're alive. They
feel things. They have something to fight for."</p>

<p>"You think you'd like it?" smiled Vance.</p>

<p>"I'd adore it. I've always longed for something
exciting&mdash;something... like that..." She extended her hand
toward the milling crowds below.</p>

<p>It was easy to understand her reaction after her years of
monotonous service to an invalid in the dreary Greene mansion.</p>

<p>At the moment I happened to look up, and, to my surprise, Heath
was standing in the doorway scanning the group of visitors. He
appeared troubled and unusually grim, and there was a nervous
intentness in the way he moved his head. I raised my hand to
attract his attention, and he immediately came to where we
stood.</p>

<p>"The Chief wants you at the office right away, Mr. Vance." There
was an ominousness in his tone. "He sent me over to get you."</p>

<p>Ada looked at him steadily, and a pallor of fear overspread her
face.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Vance shrugged in mock resignation.</p>

<p>"Just when we were getting interested in the sights. But we must
obey the Chief&mdash;eh, what, Miss Greene?"</p>

<p>But, despite his attempt to make light of Markham's unexpected
summons, Ada was strangely silent; and as we rode back to the
office she did not speak but sat tensely, her unseeing eyes staring
straight ahead.</p>

<p>It seemed an interminable time before we reached the Criminal
Courts Building. The traffic was congested; and there was even a
long delay at the elevator. Vance appeared to take the situation
calmly; but Heath's lips were compressed, and he breathed heavily
through his nose, like a man labouring under tense excitement.</p>

<p>As we entered the District Attorney's office Markham rose and
looked at the girl with a great tenderness.</p>

<p>"You must be brave, Miss Greene," he said, in a quiet,
sympathetic voice. "Something tragic and unforeseen has happened.
And as you will have to be told it sooner or later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's Rex!" She sank limply into a chair facing Markham's
desk.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said softly; "it's Rex. Sproot called up a few minutes
after you had gone..."</p>

<p>"And he's been shot&mdash;like Julia and Chester!" Her words
were scarcely audible, but they brought a sense of horror into the
dingy old office.</p>

<p>Markham inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Not five minutes after you telephoned to him someone entered
his room and shot him."</p>

<p>A dry sob shook the girl, and she buried her face in her
arms.</p>

<p>Markham stepped round the desk and placed his hand gently on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"We've got to face it, my child," he said. "We're going to the
house at once to see what can be done; and you'd better come in the
car with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to go back," she moaned. "I'm afraid-<i>I'm
afraid</i>! ..."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV - FOOTPRINTS ON THE CARPET</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 30th; noon)</b>
</p>

<p>MARKHAM had considerable difficulty in persuading Ada to
accompany us. The girl seemed almost in a panic of fright.
Moreover, she held herself indirectly responsible for Rex's death.
But at last she permitted us to lead her down to the car.</p>

<p>Heath had already telephoned to the Homicide Bureau, and his
arrangements for the investigation were complete when we started up
Centre Street. At Police Headquarters Snitkin and another Central
Office man named Burke were waiting for us, and crowded into the
tonneau of Markham's car. We made excellent time to the Greene
mansion, arriving there in less than twenty minutes.</p>

<p>A plain-clothes man lounged against the iron railing at the end
of the street a few yards beyond the gate of the Greene grounds,
and at a sign from Heath came forward at once.</p>

<p>"What about it, Santos?" the sergeant demanded gruffly. "Who's
been in and out of here this morning?"</p>

<p>"What's the big idea?" the man retorted indignantly. "That old
bimbo of a butler came out about nine and returned in less than
half an hour with a package. Said he'd been to Third Avenue to get
some dog-biscuits. The family sawbones drove up at quarter past
ten&mdash;that's his car across the street." He pointed to Von
Blon's Daimler, which was parked diagonally opposite. "He's still
inside. Then, about ten minutes after the doc arrived, this young
lady"&mdash;he indicated Ada&mdash;"came out and walked toward
Avenue A, where she hopped a taxi. And that's every man, woman, or
child that's passed in or out of these gates since I relieved
Cameron at eight o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"And Cameron's report?"</p>

<p>"Nobody all night."</p>

<p>"Well, someone got in some way," growled Heath. "Run along the
west wall there and tell Donnelly to come here <i>pronto</i>."</p>

<p>Santos disappeared through the gate, and a moment later we could
see him hurrying through the side yard toward the garage. In a few
minutes Donnelly&mdash;the man set to watch the postern
gate&mdash;came hurrying up.</p>

<p>"Who got in the backway this morning?" barked Heath.</p>

<p>"Nobody, Sergeant. The cook went marketing about ten o'clock,
and two regular deliverymen left packages. That's every one who's
been through the rear gate since yesterday."</p>

<p>"Is that so!" Heath was viciously sarcastic. "I'm telling
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, all right." The sergeant turned to Burke. "You
get up on this wall and make the rounds. See if you can find where
anyone has climbed over. And you, Snitkin, look over the yard for
footprints. When you guys finish, report to me. I'm going
inside."</p>

<p>We went up the front walk, which had been swept clean, and
Sproot admitted us to the house. His face was as blank as ever, and
he took our coats with his usual obsequious formality.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to your room now, Miss Greene," said Markham,
placing his hand kindly on Ada's arm. "Lie down, and try to get a
little rest. You look tired. I'll be in to see you before I
go."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed submissively without a word.</p>

<p>"And you, Sproot," he ordered; "come in the living-room."</p>

<p>The old butler followed us and stood humbly before the
centre-table, where Markham seated himself.</p>

<p>"Now, let's hear your story."</p>

<p>Sproot cleared his throat and stared out of the window.</p>

<p>"There's very little to tell, sir. I was in the butler's pantry,
polishing the glass-ware, when I heard the shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go back a little further," interrupted Markham. "I understand
you made a trip to Third Avenue at nine this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir: Miss Sibella bought a Pomeranian yesterday, and she
asked me to get some dog-biscuits after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Who called at the house this morning?"</p>

<p>"No one, sir&mdash;that is, no one but Doctor Von Blon."</p>

<p>"All right. Now tell us everything that happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing happened, sir&mdash;nothing unusual, that
is&mdash;until poor Mr. Rex was shot. Miss Ada went out a few
minutes after Doctor Von Blon arrived; and a little past eleven
o'clock you telephoned to Mr. Rex. Then shortly afterward you
telephoned a second time to Mr. Rex; and I returned to the pantry.
I had only been there a few minutes when I heard the
shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What time would you say that was?"</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes after eleven, sir."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"I dried my hands on my apron and stepped into the dining-room
to listen. I was not quite sure that the shot had been fired inside
the house, but I thought I'd better investigate. So I went upstairs
and, as Mr. Rex's door was open, I looked in his room first. There
I saw the poor young man lying on the floor with the blood running
from a small wound in his forehead. I called Doctor Von
Blon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where was the doctor?" Vance put the question. Sproot
hesitated, and appeared to think.</p>

<p>"He was upstairs, sir; and he came at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;upstairs! Roaming about vaguely, I presume&mdash;a
little here, a little there, what?" Vance's eyes bored into the
butler. "Come, come, Sproot. Where was the doctor?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir, he was in Miss Sibella's room."</p>

<p>"<i>Cogito, cogito</i>... Well, drum your encephalon a bit and
try to reach a conclusion. From what sector of space did the
corporeal body of Doctor Von Blon emerge after you had called
him?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir, he came out of Miss Sibella's door."</p>

<p>"Well, well. Fancy that! And, such being the case, one might
conclude&mdash; without too great a curfuffling of one's
brains&mdash;that, preceding his issuing from that particular door,
he was actually in Miss Sibella's room?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, sir."</p>

<p>"Dash it all, Sproot! You know deuced well he was there."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And now suppose you continue with your odyssey."</p>

<p>"It was more like the <i>Iliad</i>, if I may say so. More
tragic-like, if you understand what I mean; although Mr. Rex was
not exactly a Hector. However that may be sir, Doctor Von Blon came
immediately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had not heard the shot, then?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not, for he seemed very much startled when he saw
Mr. Rex. And Miss Sibella, who followed him into Mr. Rex's room,
was startled, too."</p>

<p>"Did they make any comment?"</p>

<p>"As to that I couldn't say. I came downstairs at once and
telephoned to Mr. Markham."</p>

<p>As he spoke Ada appeared at the archway, her eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Someone's been in my room," she announced, in a frightened
voice. "The French doors to the balcony were partly open when I
went upstairs just now, and there were dirty snow-tracks across the
floor... Oh, what does it mean? Do you think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Markham had jerked himself forward.</p>

<p>"You left the French doors shut when you went out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she answered. "I rarely open them in
winter."</p>

<p>"And were they locked?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, but I think so. They must have been
locked&mdash;though how could anyone have got in unless I'd
forgotten to turn the key?"</p>

<p>Heath had risen and stood listening to the girl's story with
grim bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Probably the bird with those galoshes again," he mumbled. "I'll
get Jerym himself up here this time." Markham nodded and turned
back to Ada.</p>

<p>"Thank you for telling us, Miss Greene. Suppose you go to some
other room and wait for us. We want your room left just as you
found it until we've had time to examine it."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the kitchen and stay with cook. I&mdash;I don't want
to be alone." And with a catch of her breath she left us.</p>

<p>"Where's Doctor Von Blon now?" Markham asked Sproot.</p>

<p>"With Mrs. Greene, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell him we're here and would like to see him at once."</p>

<p>The butler bowed and went out.</p>

<p>Vance was pacing up and down, his eyes almost closed.</p>

<p>"It grows madder every minute," he said. "It was insane enough
without those foot-tracks and that open door. There's something
devilish going on here, Markham. There's demonology and witchcraft
afoot, or something strangely close to it. I say, is there anything
in the Pandects or the Justinian Code relating to the proper legal
procedure against diabolic possession or spiritism?"</p>

<p>Before Markham could rebuke him Von Blon entered. His usual
suavity had disappeared. He bowed jerkily without speaking, and
smoothed his moustache nervously with an unsteady hand.</p>

<p>"Sproot tells me, doctor," said Markham, "that you did not hear
the shot fired in Rex's room."</p>

<p>"No!" The fact seemed both to puzzle and disturb him. "I can't
make it out either, for Rex's door into the hall was open."</p>

<p>"You were in Miss Sibella's room, were you not?" Vance had
halted, and stood studying the doctor. Von Blon lifted his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I was. Sibella had been complaining about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A sore throat or something of the kind, no doubt," finished
Vance. "But that's immaterial. The fact is that neither you nor
Miss Sibella heard the shot. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>The doctor inclined his head. "I knew nothing of it till Sproot
knocked on the door and beckoned me across the hall."</p>

<p>"And Miss Sibella accompanied you into Rex's room?"</p>

<p>"She came in just behind me, I believe. But I told her not to
touch anything, and sent her immediately back to her room. When I
came out into the hall again I heard Sproot phoning the District
Attorney's office, and thought I'd better wait till the police
arrived. After talking over the situation with Sibella I informed
Mrs. Greene of the tragedy, and remained with her until Sproot told
me of your arrival."</p>

<p>"You saw no one else upstairs, or heard no suspicious
noise?"</p>

<p>"No one&mdash;nothing. The house, in fact, was unusually
quiet."</p>

<p>"Do you recall if Miss Ada's door was open?"</p>

<p>The doctor pondered a moment. "I don't recall&mdash;which means
it was probably closed. Otherwise I would have noticed it."</p>

<p>"And how is Mrs. Greene this morning?" Vance's question, put
negligently, sounded curiously irrelevant. Von Blon gave a
start.</p>

<p>"She seemed somewhat more comfortable when I first saw her, but
the news of Rex's death disturbed her considerably. When I left her
just now she was complaining about the shooting pains in her
spine."</p>

<p>Markham had got up and now moved restlessly toward the
archway.</p>

<p>"The Medical Examiner will be here any minute," he said; "and I
want to look over Rex's room before he arrives. You might come with
us, doctor.&mdash;And you, Sproot, had better remain at the front
door."</p>

<p>We went upstairs quietly: I think it was in all our minds that
we should not advertise our presence to Mrs. Greene. Rex's room,
like all those in the Greene mansion, was spacious. It had a large
window at the front and another at the side. There were no
draperies to shut out the light, and the slanting midday sun of
winter poured in. The walls, as Chester had once told us, were
lined with books; and pamphlets and papers were piled in every
available nook. The chamber resembled a student's workshop more
than a bedroom.</p>

<p>In front of the Tudor fire-place in the centre of the left
wall&mdash;a duplication of the fire-place in Ada's
room&mdash;sprawled the body of Rex Greene. His left arm was
extended, but his right arm was crooked, and the fingers were
tightened, as if holding some object. His domelike head was turned
a little to one side; and a thin stream of blood ran down his
temple to the floor from a tiny aperture over the right eye.</p>

<p>Heath studied the body for several minutes.</p>

<p>"He was shot standing still, Mr. Markham. He collapsed in a heap
and then straightened out a little after he'd hit the floor."</p>

<p>Vance was bending over the dead man with a puzzled
expression.</p>

<p>"Markham, there's something curious and inconsistent here," he
said. "It was broad daylight when this thing happened, and the lad
was shot from the front-there are even powder marks on the face.
But his expression is perfectly natural. No sign of fear or
astonishment&mdash;rather peaceful and unconcerned, in fact... It's
incredible. The murderer and the pistol certainly weren't
invisible."</p>

<p>Heath nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"I noticed that too, sir. It's damn' peculiar." He bent more
closely over the body. "That wound looks to me like a thirty-two,"
he commented, turning to the doctor for confirmation.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Von Blon. "It appears to have been made with the
same weapon that was used against the others."</p>

<p>"It was the same weapon," Vance pronounced sombrely, taking out
his cigarette-case with thoughtful deliberation. "And it was the
same killer who used it." He smoked a moment, his troubled gaze
resting on Rex's face. "But why was it done at just this
time&mdash;in the daylight, with the door open, and when there were
people close at hand? Why didn't the murderer wait until night? Why
did he run such a needless risk?"</p>

<p>"Don't forget," Markham reminded him, "that Rex was on the point
of coming to my office to tell me something."</p>

<p>"But who knew he was about to indulge in revelations? He was
shot within ten minutes of your call&mdash;" He broke off and
turned quickly to the doctor. "What telephone extensions are there
in the house?"</p>

<p>"There are three, I believe." Von Blon spoke easily. "There's
one in Mrs. Greene's room, one in Sibella's room, and, I think, one
in the kitchen. The main phone is, of course, in the lower front
hall."</p>

<p>"A regular central office," growled Heath. "Almost anybody
coulda listened in." Suddenly he fell on his knees beside the body
and unflexed the fingers of the right hand.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you won't find that cryptic drawing, Sergeant,"
murmured Vance. "If the murderer shot Rex in order to seal his
mouth the paper will surely be gone. Anyone overhearing the phone
calls, d'ye see, would have learned of the envelope he was to fetch
along."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, sir. But I'm going to have a look."</p>

<p>He felt under the body and then systematically went through the
dead man's pockets. But he found nothing even resembling the blue
envelope mentioned by Ada. At last he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"It's gone, all right."</p>

<p>Then another idea occurred to him. Going hurriedly into the
hall, he called down the stairs to Sproot. When the butler appeared
Heath swung on him savagely.</p>

<p>"Where's the private mail-box?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I exactly understand you." Sproot's answer
was placid and unruffled. "There is a mail-box just inside the
front door. Do you refer to that, sir?"</p>

<p>"No! You know damn' well I don't. I want to know where the
private&mdash;get me?&mdash;<i>private</i> mail-box is, <i>in the
house</i>."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are alluding to the little silver pyx for outgoing
mail on the table in the lower hall."</p>

<p>"'Pyx,' is it!" The sergeant's sarcasm was stupendous. "Well, go
down and bring me everything that's in this here pyx.&mdash;No!
Wait a minute&mdash;I'll keep you company... <i>Pyx</i>!" He took
Sproot by the arm and fairly dragged him from the room.</p>

<p>A few moments later he returned, crestfallen. "Empty!" was his
laconic announcement.</p>

<p>"But don't give up hope entirely just because your cabalistic
diagram has disappeared," Vance exhorted him. "I doubt if it would
have helped you much. This case isn't a rebus. It's a complex
mathematical formula, filled with moduli, infinitesimals, quantics,
faciends, derivatives, and coefficients. Rex himself might have
solved it if he hadn't been shoved off the earth so soon." His eyes
wandered over the room. "And I'm not at all sure he hadn't solved
it."</p>

<p>Markham was growing impatient.</p>

<p>"We'd better go down to the drawing-room and wait for Doctor
Doremus and the men from Head-quarters," he suggested. "We can't
learn anything here."</p>

<p>We went out into the hall, and as we passed Ada's door Heath
threw it open and stood on the threshold surveying the room. The
French doors leading to the balcony were slightly ajar, and the
wind from the west was flapping their green chintz curtains. On the
light beige rug were several damp discoloured cracks leading round
the foot of the bed to the hall door where we stood. Heath studied
the marks for a moment, and then drew the door shut again.</p>

<p>"They're footprints, all right," he remarked. "Someone tracked
in the dirty snow from the balcony and forgot to shut the glass
doors."</p>

<p>We were scarcely seated in the drawing-room when there came a
knocking on the front door; and Sproot admitted Snitkin and
Burke.</p>

<p>"You first, Burke," ordered the sergeant, as the two officers
appeared.</p>

<p>"Any signs of an entry over the wall?"</p>

<p>"Not a one." The man's overcoat and trousers were smudged from
top to bottom. "I crawled all round the top of the wall, and I'm
here to tell you that nobody left any traces anywheres. If any guy
got over that wall, he vaulted."</p>

<p>"Fair enough.&mdash;And now you, Snitkin."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> got news for you." The detective spoke with overt
triumph. "Somebody's walked up those outside steps to the stone
balcony on the west side of the house. And he walked up 'em this
morning after the snowfall at nine o'clock, for the tracks are
fresh. Furthermore, they're the same size as the ones we found last
time on the front walk."</p>

<p>"Where do these new tracks come from?" Heath leaned forward
eagerly.</p>

<p>"That's the hell of it, Sergeant. They come from the front walk
right below the steps to the front door; and there's no tracing 'em
farther back because the front walk's been swept clean."</p>

<p>"I mighta known it," grumbled Heath. "And the tracks are only
going one way?"</p>

<p>"That's all. They leave the walk a few feet below the front
door, swing round the corner of the house, and go up the steps to
the balcony. The guy who made 'em didn't come down that way."</p>

<p>The sergeant puffed disappointedly on his cigar.</p>

<p>"So he went up the balcony steps, entered the French doors,
crossed Ada's room to the hall, did his dirty work, and
then&mdash;disappeared! A sweet case this is!" He clicked his
tongue with disgust.</p>

<p>"The man may have gone out by the front door," suggested
Markham.</p>

<p>The sergeant made a wry face and bellowed for Sproot, who
entered immediately.</p>

<p>"Say, which way did you go upstairs when you heard the
shot?"</p>

<p>"I went up the servants' stairs, sir."</p>

<p>"Then someone mighta gone down the front stairs at the same time
without your seeing him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; it's quite possible."</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>Sproot bowed and again took up his post at the front door.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks like that's what happened, sir," Heath commented
to Markham. "Only how did he get in and out of the grounds without
being seen? That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>Vance was standing by the window gazing out upon the river.</p>

<p>"There's something dashed unconvincing about those recurrent
spoors in the snow. Our eccentric culprit is altogether too
careless with his feet and too careful with his hands. He doesn't
leave a finger-print or any other sign of his presence except those
foot-tracks&mdash;all nice and tidy and staring us in the face. But
they don't square with the rest of this fantastic business."</p>

<p>Heath stared hopelessly at the floor. He was patently of Vance's
opinion; but the dogged thoroughness of his nature asserted itself,
and presently he looked up with a forced show of energy.</p>

<p>"Go and phone Captain Jerym, Snitkin, and tell him I wish he'd
hustle out here to look at some carpet-tracks. Then make
measurements of those footprints on the balcony steps.&mdash;And
you, Burke, take up a post in the upper hall, and don't let anyone
go into the two front west rooms."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV - THE MURDERER IN THE HOUSE</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 30th; 12.30 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>WHEN Snitkin and Burke had gone Vance turned from the window and
strolled to where the doctor was sitting.</p>

<p>"I think it might be well," he said quietly, "if the exact
whereabouts of everyone in the house preceding and during the
shooting was determined.&mdash; We know, doctor, that you arrived
here at about quarter past ten. How long were you with Mrs.
Greene?"</p>

<p>Von Blon drew himself up and gave Vance a resentful stare. But
quickly his manner changed and he answered courteously:</p>

<p>"I sat with her for perhaps half an hour; then I went to
Sibella's room&mdash;a little before eleven, I should say&mdash;and
remained there until Sproot called me."</p>

<p>"And was Miss Sibella with you in the room all the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes-the entire time."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Vance returned to the window, and Heath, who had been watching
the doctor belligerently, took his cigar from his mouth and cocked
his head at Markham.</p>

<p>"You know, sir, I was just thinking over the inspector's
suggestion about planting someone in the house to keep an eye on
things. How would it be if we got rid of this nurse that's here
now, and put in one of our own women from Head-quarters?"</p>

<p>Von Blon looked up with eager approval.</p>

<p>"An excellent plan!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Very well, Sergeant," agreed Markham. "You attend to it."</p>

<p>"Your woman can begin to-night," Von Blon told Heath. "I'll meet
you here whenever you say, and give her instructions. There's
nothing very technical for her to do."</p>

<p>Heath made a notation in a battered notebook.</p>

<p>"I'll meet you here, say, at six o'clock. How's that?"</p>

<p>"That will suit me perfectly." Von Blon rose. "And now, if I can
be of no more service..."</p>

<p>"That's quite all right, doctor," said Markham. "Go right
ahead."</p>

<p>But instead of immediately leaving the house Von Blon went
upstairs, and we heard him knock on Sibella's door. A few minutes
later he came down again and passed on to the front door without a
glance in our direction.</p>

<p>In the meantime Snitkin had come in and informed the sergeant
that Captain Jerym was leaving Police Headquarters at once and
would arrive within half an hour. He had then gone outside to make
his measurements of the footprints on the balcony steps.</p>

<p>"And now," suggested Markham, "I think we might see Mrs. Greene.
It's possible she heard something..."</p>

<p>Vance roused himself from apparent lethargy.</p>

<p>"By all means. But first let us get a few facts in hand. I long
to hear where the nurse was during the half-hour preceding Rex's
demise. And I could bear to know if the old lady was alone
immediately following the firing of the revolver.&mdash;Why not
have our Miss Nightingale on the tapis before we brave the
invalid's imprecations?"</p>

<p>Markham concurred, and Heath sent Sproot to summon her.</p>

<p>The nurse came in with an air of professional detachment; but
her roseate cheeks had paled perceptibly since we last saw her.</p>

<p>"Miss Craven"&mdash;Vance's manner was easy and
businesslike&mdash;"will you please tell us exactly what you were
doing between half-past ten and half-past eleven this morning?"</p>

<p>"I was in my room on the third floor," she answered. "I went
there when the doctor arrived a little after ten, and remained
until he called me to bring Mrs. Greene's <i>bouillon</i>. Then I
returned to my room and stayed until the doctor again summoned me
to sit with Mrs. Greene while he was with you gentlemen."</p>

<p>"When you were in your room, was the door open?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I always leave it open in the daytime in case Mrs.
Greene calls."</p>

<p>"And her door was open, too, I take it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you hear the shot?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"That will be all, Miss Craven." Vance accompanied her to the
hall. "You'd better return to your room now, for we're going to pay
a visit to your patient."</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene eyed us vindictively when we entered after having
knocked and been imperiously ordered to come in.</p>

<p>"More trouble," she complained. "Am I never to have any peace in
my own house? The first day in weeks I've felt even moderately
comfortable&mdash;and then all this had to happen to upset me!"</p>

<p>"We regret, madam&mdash;more than you do apparently&mdash;that
your son is dead," said Markham. "And we are sorry for the
annoyance the tragedy is causing you. But that does not relieve me
from the necessity of investigating the affair. As you were awake
at the time the shot was fired, it is essential that we seek what
information you may be able to give us."</p>

<p>"What information can I give you&mdash;a helpless paralytic,
lying here alone?" A smouldering anger flickered in her eyes. "It
strikes me that you are the one to give me information."</p>

<p>Markham ignored her barbed retort.</p>

<p>"The nurse tells me your door was open this morning..."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't it have been? Am I expected to be entirely
excommunicated from the rest of the household?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I was merely trying to find out if, by any
chance, you were in a position to hear anything that went on in the
hall."</p>

<p>"Well, I heard nothing&mdash;if that's all you want to
know."</p>

<p>Markham persisted patiently.</p>

<p>"You heard no one, for instance, cross Miss Ada's room, or open
Miss Ada's door?"</p>

<p>"I've already told you I heard nothing." The old lady's denial
was viciously emphatic.</p>

<p>"Nor anyone walking in the hall, or descending the stairs?"</p>

<p>"No one but that incompetent doctor and the impossible Sproot.
Were we supposed to have had visitors this morning?"</p>

<p>"Someone shot your son," Markham reminded her coolly.</p>

<p>"It was probably his own fault," she snapped. Then she seemed to
relent a bit. "Still, Rex was not as hard and thoughtless as the
rest of the children. But even he neglected me shamefully." She
appeared to weigh the matter. "Yes," she decided, "he received just
punishment for the way he treated me."</p>

<p>Markham struggled with a hot resentment. At last he managed to
ask, with apparent calmness:</p>

<p>"Did you hear the shot with which your son was punished?"</p>

<p>"I did not." Her tone was again irate. "I knew nothing of the
disturbance until the doctor saw fit to tell me."</p>

<p>"And yet Mr. Rex's door, as well as yours, was open," said
Markham. "I can hardly understand your not having heard the
shot."</p>

<p>The old lady gave him a look of scathing irony.</p>

<p>"Am I to sympathize with your lack of understanding?"</p>

<p>"Lest you be tempted to, madam, I shall leave you." Markham
bowed stiffly and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>As we reached the lower hall Doctor Doremus arrived.</p>

<p>"Your friends are still at it, I hear, Sergeant," he greeted
Heath, with his usual breezy manner. Handing his coat and hat to
Sproot, he came forward and shook hands with all of us. "When you
fellows don't spoil my breakfast you interfere with my lunch," he
repined. "Where's the body?"</p>

<p>Heath led him upstairs, and after a few minutes returned to the
drawing- room. Taking out another cigar he bit the end of it
savagely. "Well, sir, I guess you'll want to see this Miss Sibella
next, won't you?"</p>

<p>"We might as well," sighed Markham. "Then I'll tackle the
servants and leave things to you. The reporters will be along
pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it! And what they're going to do to us in the
papers'll be aplenty!"</p>

<p>"And you can't even tell them 'it is confidently expected that
an arrest will be made in the immediate future,' don't y' know,"
grinned Vance. "It's most distressin'."</p>

<p>Heath made an inarticulate noise of exasperation and, calling
Sproot, sent him for Sibella.</p>

<p>A moment later she came in carrying a small Pomeranian. She was
paler than I had ever seen her, and there was unmistakable fright
in her eyes. When she greeted us it was without her habitual
gaiety.</p>

<p>"This thing is getting rather ghastly, isn't it?" she remarked
when she had taken a seat.</p>

<p>"It is indeed dreadful," returned Markham soberly. "You have our
very deepest sympathy..."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks awf'ly." She accepted the cigarette Vance offered
her. "But I'm beginning to wonder how long I'll be here to receive
condolences." She spoke with forced lightness, but a strained
quality in her voice told of her suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>Markham regarded her sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I do not think it would be a bad idea if you went away for a
while&mdash;to some friend's house, let us say&mdash;preferably out
of the city."</p>

<p>"Oh, no." She tossed her head with defiance. "I shan't run away.
If there's anyone really bent on killing me, he'll manage it
somehow, wherever I am. Anyway, I'd have to come back sooner or
later. I couldn't board with out-of-town friends
indefinitely.&mdash;Could I?" She looked at Markham with a kind of
anxious despair. "You haven't any idea, I suppose, who it is that's
obsessed with the idea of exterminating us Greenes?"</p>

<p>Markham was reluctant to admit to her the utter hopelessness of
the official outlook; and she turned appealingly to Vance.</p>

<p>"You needn't treat me like a child," she said spiritedly. "You,
at least, Mr. Vance, can tell me if there is anyone under
suspicion."</p>

<p>"No, dash it all, Miss Greene!&mdash;there isn't," he answered
promptly. "It's an amazin' confession to have to make; but it's
true. That's why, I think, Mr. Markham suggested that you go away
for a while."</p>

<p>"It's very thoughtful of him and all that," she returned. "But I
think I'll stay and see it through."</p>

<p>"You're a very brave girl," said Markham, with troubled
admiration. "And I assure you everything humanly possible will be
done to safeguard you."</p>

<p>"Well, so much for that." She tossed her cigarette into a
receiver, and began abstractedly to pet the dog in her lap. "And
now, I suppose, you want to know if I heard the shot. Well, I
didn't. So you may continue the inquisition from that point."</p>

<p>"You were in your room, though, at the time of your brother's
death?</p>

<p>"I was in my room all morning," she said. "My first appearance
beyond the threshold was when Sproot brought the sad tidings of
Rex's passing. But Doctor Von shooed me back again; and there I've
remained until now. Model behaviour, don't you think, for a member
of this new and wicked generation?"</p>

<p>"What time did Doctor Von Blon come to your room?" asked
Vance.</p>

<p>Sibella gave him a faint whimsical smile.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad it was you who asked that question. I'm sure Mr.
Markham would have used a disapproving tone&mdash;though it's quite
<i>au fait</i> to receive one's doctor in one's boudoir.&mdash;Let
me see. I'm sure you asked Doctor Von the same question, so I must
be careful... A little before eleven, I should say."</p>

<p>"The doc's exact words," chimed in Heath suspiciously.</p>

<p>Sibella turned a look of amused surprise upon him.</p>

<p>"Isn't that wonderful! But then, I've always been told that
honesty is the best policy."</p>

<p>"And did Doctor Von Blon remain in your room until called by
Sproot?" pursued Vance.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He was smoking his pipe. Mother detests pipes, and he
often sneaks into my room to enjoy a quiet smoke."</p>

<p>"And what were you doing during the doctor's visit?"</p>

<p>"I was bathing this ferocious animal." She held up the
Pomeranian for Vance's inspection. "Doesn't he look nice?"</p>

<p>"In the bath-room?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. I'd hardly bathe him in the
<i>poudri&egrave;re</i>."</p>

<p>"And was the bath-room door closed?"</p>

<p>"As to that I couldn't say. But it's quite likely. Doctor Von is
like a member of the family, and I'm terribly rude to him
sometimes."</p>

<p>Vance got up.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Miss Greene. We're sorry we had to trouble
you. Do you mind remaining in your room for a while?"</p>

<p>"Mind? On the contrary. It's about the only place I feel safe."
She walked to the archway. "If you do find out anything you'll let
me know&mdash;won't you? There's no use pretending any longer. I'm
dreadfully scared." Then, as if ashamed of her admission, she went
quickly down the hall.</p>

<p>Just then Sproot admitted the two finger-print
experts&mdash;Dubois and Bellamy&mdash;and the official
photographer. Heath joined them in the hall and took them upstairs,
returning immediately.</p>

<p>"And now what, sir?"</p>

<p>Markham seemed lost in gloomy speculation, and it was Vance who
answered the sergeant's query.</p>

<p>"I rather think," he said, "that another verbal bout with the
pious Hemming and the taciturn Frau Mannheim might dispose of a
loose end or two."</p>

<p>Hemming was sent for. She came in labouring under intense
excitement. Her eyes fairly glittered with the triumph of the
prophetess whose auguries have come to pass. But she had no
information whatever to impart. She had spent most of the forenoon
in the laundry, and had been unaware of the tragedy until Sproot
had mentioned it to her shortly before our arrival. She was
voluble, however, on the subject of divine punishment, and it was
with difficulty that Vance stemmed her oracular stream of
words.</p>

<p>Nor could the cook throw any light on Rex's murder. She had been
in the kitchen, she said, the entire morning except for the hour
she had gone marketing. She had not heard the shot and, like
Hemming, knew of the tragedy only through Sproot. A marked change,
however, had come over the woman. When she had entered the
drawing-room fright and resentment animated her usually stolid
features, and as she sat before us her fingers worked nervously in
her lap.</p>

<p>Vance watched her critically during the interview. At the end he
asked suddenly:</p>

<p>"Miss Ada has been with you in the kitchen this past
half-hour?"</p>

<p>At the mention of Ada's name her fear was perceptibly
intensified. She drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, little Ada has been with me. And thank the good God she
was away this morning when Mr Rex was killed, or it might have been
her and not Mr. Rex. They tried once to shoot her, and maybe
they'll try again. She oughtn't to be allowed to stay in this
house."</p>

<p>"I think it only fair to tell you, Frau Mannheim," said Vance,
"that someone will be watching closely over Miss Ada from now
on."</p>

<p>The woman looked at him gratefully.</p>

<p>"Why should anyone want to harm little Ada?" she asked, in an
anguished tone. "I also shall watch over her."</p>

<p>When she had left us Vance said:</p>

<p>"Something tells me, Markham, that Ada could have no better
protector in this house than that motherly German.&mdash;And yet,"
he added, "there'll be no end of this grim carnage until we have
the murderer safely gyved." His face darkened: his mouth was as
cruel as Pietro de' Medici's. "This hellish business isn't ended.
The final picture is only just emerging. And it's
damnable&mdash;worse than any of the horrors of Rops or
Dor&eacute;."</p>

<p>Markham nodded with dismal depression.</p>

<p>"Yes, there appears to be an inevitability about these tragedies
that's beyond mere human power to combat." He got up wearily and
addressed himself to Heath. "There's nothing more I can do here at
present, Sergeant. Carry on, and phone me at the office before
five."</p>

<p>We were about to take our departure when Captain Jerym arrived.
He was a quiet, heavy-set man, with a grey, scraggly moustache and
small, deep-set eyes. One might easily have mistaken him for a
shrewd, efficient merchant. After a brief hand-shaking ceremony
Heath piloted him upstairs.</p>

<p>Vance had already donned his ulster, but now he removed it.</p>

<p>"I think I'll tarry a bit and hear what the captain has to say
regarding those footprints. Y'know, Markham, I've been evolving a
rather fantastic theory about 'em; and I want to test it."</p>

<p>Markham looked at him a moment with questioning curiosity. Then
he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I'll wait with you," he said.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Doctor Doremus came down, and paused long
enough on his way out to tell us that Rex had been shot with a .32
revolver held at a distance of about a foot from the forehead, the
bullet having entered directly from the front and embedded itself,
in all probability, in the midbrain.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour after Doremus had gone Heath re-entered the
drawing- room. He expressed uneasy surprise at seeing us still
there.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vance wanted to hear Jerym's report," Markham
explained.</p>

<p>"The captain'll be through any minute now." The sergeant sank
into a chair. "He's checking Snitkin's measurements. He couldn't
make much of the tracks on the carpet, though."</p>

<p>"And finger-prints?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"Nothing yet."</p>

<p>"And there won't be," added Vance. "There wouldn't be footprints
if they weren't deliberately intended for us."</p>

<p>Heath shot him a sharp look, but before he could speak, Captain
Jerym and Snitkin came downstairs.</p>

<p>"What's the verdict, Cap?" asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Those footprints on the balcony steps," said, Jerym, "were made
with galoshes of the same size and markings as the pattern turned
over to me by Snitkin a fortnight or so ago. As for the prints in
the room, I'm not so sure. They appear to be the same, however; and
the dirt on them is sooty, like the dirt on the snow outside the
French doors. I've several photographs of them; and I'll know
definitely when I get my enlargements under the microscope."</p>

<p>Vance rose and sauntered to the archway.</p>

<p>"May I have your permission to go upstairs a moment,
Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath looked mystified. His instinct was to ask a reason for
this unexpected request, but all he said was: "Sure. Go ahead."</p>

<p>Something in Vance's manner&mdash;an air of satisfaction
combined with a suppressed eagerness&mdash;told me that he had
verified his theory.</p>

<p>He was gone less than five minutes. When he returned he carried
a pair of galoshes similar to those that had been found in
Chester's closet. He handed them to Captain Jerym.</p>

<p>"You'll probably find that these made the tracks."</p>

<p>Both Jerym and Snitkin examined them carefully, comparing the
measurements and fitting the rough patterns to the soles. Finally,
the captain took one of them to the window, and affixing a
jeweller's glass to his eye, studied the riser of the heel.</p>

<p>"I think you're right," he agreed. "There's a worn place here
which corresponds to an indentation on the cast I made."</p>

<p>Heath had sprung to his feet and stood eyeing Vance. "Where did
you find 'em?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Tucked away in the rear of the little linen-closet at the head
of the stairs."</p>

<p>The sergeant's excitement got the better of him. He swung about
to Markham, fairly spluttering with consternation.</p>

<p>"Those two guys from the Bureau that went over this house
looking for the gun told me there wasn't a pair of galoshes in the
place; and I specially told 'em to keep their eyes peeled for
galoshes. And now Mr. Vance finds 'em in the linen-closet off the
main hall upstairs!"</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," said Vance mildly, "the galoshes weren't there
when your sleuths were looking for the revolver. On both former
occasions the johnny who wore 'em had plenty of time to put 'em
away safely. But to- day, d' ye see, he had no chance to sequester
them; so he left 'em in the linen-closet for the time being."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" Heath growled vaguely. "Well, what's the
rest of the story, Mr. Vance?"</p>

<p>"That's all there is to date. If I knew the rest I'd know who
fired the shots. But I might remind you that neither of your
<i>sergents-de-ville</i> saw any suspicious person leave here."</p>

<p>"Good God, Vance!" Markham was on his feet. "That means that the
murderer is in the house this minute."</p>

<p>"At any rate," returned Vance lazily, "I think we are justified
in assuming that the murderer was here when we arrived."</p>

<p>"But nobody's left the place but Von Blon," blurted Heath.</p>

<p>Vance nodded. "Oh, it's wholly possible the murderer is still in
the house, Sergeant."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI - THE LOST POISONS</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 30th; 2 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>MARKHAM and Vance and I had a late lunch at the Stuyvesant Club.
During the meal the subject of the murder was avoided as if by
tacit agreement; but when we sat smoking over our coffee Markham
settled back in his chair and surveyed Vance sternly.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "I want to hear how you came to find those
galoshes in the linen-closet. And, damn it! I don't want any
garrulous evasions or quotations out of Bartlett."</p>

<p>"I'm quite willing to unburden my soul," smiled Vance. "It was
all so dashed simple. I never put any stock in the burglar theory,
and so was able to approach the problem with a virgin mind, as it
were."</p>

<p>He lit a fresh cigarette and poured himself another cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>"Perpend, Markham. On the night that Julia and Ada were shot a
double set of footprints was found. It had stopped snowing at about
eleven o'clock, and the tracks had been made between that hour and
midnight, when the sergeant arrived on the scene. On the night of
Chester's murder there was another set of footprints similar to the
others; and they too had been made shortly after the weather had
cleared. Here, then, were tracks in the snow, approaching and
retreating from the front door, preceding each crime; and both sets
had been made after the snow had stopped falling <i>when they would
be distinctly visible and determinable</i>. This was not a
particularly striking coincidence, but it was sufficiently
arresting to create a slight strain on my <i>cortex cerebri</i>.
And the strain increased perceptibly this morning when Snitkin
reported his discovery of fresh footprints on the balcony steps;
for once again the same meteorological conditions had accompanied
our culprit's passion for leaving spoors. I was therefore driven to
the irresistible inference, as you learned Solons put it, that the
murderer, so careful and calculating about everything else, had
deliberately made all these footprints for our special edification.
In each instance, d' ye see, he had chosen the only hour of the day
when his tracks would not be obliterated by falling snow or
confused with other tracks... Are you there?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Markham. "I'm listening."</p>

<p>"To proceed, then. Another coincidence attached to these three
sets of footprints. It was impossible, because of the dry, flaky
nature of the snow, to determine whether the first set had
originated in the house and returned there, or had first approached
the house from the street and then retreated. Again, on the night
of Chester's demise, when the snow was damp and susceptible to
clear impressions, the same doubt arose. The tracks to and from the
house were on opposite sides of the front walk: not a single
footstep overlapped! Accidental? Perhaps. But not wholly
reasonable. A person walking to and from a door along a
comparatively narrow pathway would almost certainly have doubled on
some of his tracks. And even if he had failed to superimpose any of
his footprints, the parallel spoors would have been close together.
But these two lines of prints were far apart: each clung to the
extreme edge of the walk, as if the person who made them was
positively afraid of overlapping. Now, consider the footprints made
this morning. There was a single line of them entering the house,
but none coming out. We concluded that the murderer had made his
escape via the front door and down the neatly swept walk; but this,
after all, was only an assumption."</p>

<p>Vance sipped his coffee and inhaled a moment on his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"The point I'm trying to bring out is this: there is no proof
whatever that all these footprints were not made by someone in the
house who first went out and then returned for the express purpose
of leading the police to believe that an outsider was guilty. But,
on the other hand, there is evidence that the footprints actually
did originate in the house; because if an outsider had made them he
would have been at no pains to confuse the issue of their origin,
since, in any event, they could not have been traced back farther
than the street. Therefore, as a tentative starting- point, I
assumed that the tracks had, in reality, been made by someone in
the house.&mdash;I can't say, of course, whether or not my layman's
logic adds lustre to the gladsome light of
jurisprudence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your reasoning is consistent as far as it goes," cut in Markham
tartly. "But it is hardly complete enough to have led you directly
to the linen- closet this morning."</p>

<p>"True. But there were various contribut'ry factors. For
instance, the galoshes which Snitkin found in Chester's
clothes-closet were the exact size of the prints. At first I toyed
with the idea that they were the actual instruments of our
unknown's vestigial deception. But when, after they had been taken
to Head-quarters, another set of similar tracks appeared&mdash;to
wit, the ones found this morning&mdash;I amended my theory
slightly, and concluded that Chester had owned two pairs of
galoshes&mdash;one that had perhaps been discarded but not thrown
away. That was why I wanted to wait for Captain Jerym's report: I
was anxious to learn if the new tracks were exactly like the old
ones."</p>

<p>"But even so," interrupted Markham, "your theory that the
footprints emanated from the house strikes me as being erected on
pretty weak scaffolding. Were there any other indicants?"</p>

<p>"I was coming to them," replied Vance reproachfully. "But you
will rush me so. Pretend that I'm a lawyer, and my summation will
sound positively breathless."</p>

<p>"I'm more likely to pretend that I'm a presiding judge, and give
you <i>sus. per coll</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, well." Vance sighed and continued. "Let us consider the
hypothetical intruder's means of escape after the shooting of Julia
and Ada. Sproot came into the upper hall immediately after the shot
had been fired in Ada's room; yet he heard nothing&mdash;neither
footsteps in the hall nor the front door closing. And, Markham old
thing, a person in galoshes going down marble steps in the dark is
no midsummer zephyr for silence. In the circumstances Sproot would
have been certain to hear him making his escape. Therefore, the
explanation that suggested itself to me was that <i>he did not make
his escape</i>."</p>

<p>"And the footprints outside?"</p>

<p>"Were made beforehand by someone walking to the front gate and
back.&mdash;And that brings me to the night of Chester's murder.
You remember Rex's tale of hearing a dragging noise in the hall and
a door closing about fifteen minutes before the shot was fired, and
Ada's corroboration of the door- shutting part of the story? The
noise, please note, was heard after it had stopped snowing&mdash;in
fact, after the moon had come out. Could the noise not easily have
been a person walking in galoshes, or even taking them off, after
having returned from making those separated tracks to and from the
gate? And might not that closing door have been the door of the
linen-closet where the galoshes were being temporarily cached?"</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "Yes, the sounds Rex and Ada heard might be
explained that way."</p>

<p>"And this morning's business was even plainer. There were
footprints on the balcony steps, made between nine o'clock and
noon. But neither of the guards saw anyone enter the grounds.
Moreover, Sproot waited a few moments in the dining-room after the
shot had been fired in Rex's room; and if anyone had come down the
stairs and gone out the front door Sproot would certainly have
heard him. It's true that the murderer might have descended the
front stairs as Sproot went up the servants' stairs. But is that
likely? Would he have waited in the upper hall after killing Rex,
knowing that someone was likely to step out and discover him? I
think not. And anyway, the guards saw no one leave the estate.
<i>Ergo</i>, I concluded that <i>no one came down the front stairs
after Rex's death</i>. I assumed again that the footprints had been
made at some earlier hour. This time, however, the murderer did not
go to the gate and return, for a guard was there who would have
seen him; and, furthermore, the front steps and the walk had been
swept. So our track-maker, after having donned the galoshes,
stepped out of the front door, walked round the corner of the
house, mounted the balcony steps, and re-entered the upper hall by
way of Ada's room."</p>

<p>"I see." Markham leaned over and knocked the ashes from his
cigar. "Therefore, you inferred that the galoshes were still in the
house."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But I'll admit I didn't think of the linen-closet at
once. First I tried Chester's room. Then I took a look round
Julia's chamber; and I was about to go up to the servants' quarters
when I recalled Rex's story of the closing door. I ran my eye over
all the second-story doors, and straightway tried the
linen-closet-which was, after all, the most likely place for a
transient occultation. And lo! there were the galoshes, tucked
under an old drugget. The murderer had probably hidden them there
both times before, pending an opportunity of secreting them more
thoroughly."</p>

<p>"But where could they have been concealed so that our searchers
didn't run across them?"</p>

<p>"As to that, now, I couldn't say. They may have been taken out
of the house altogether."</p>

<p>There was a silence for several minutes. Then Markham spoke.</p>

<p>"The finding of the galoshes pretty well proves your theory,
Vance. But do you realize what confronts us now? If your reasoning
is correct, the guilty person is someone with whom we've been
talking this morning. It's an appalling thought. I've gone over in
my mind every member of that household; and I simply can't regard
any one of them as a potential mass- murderer."</p>

<p>"Sheer moral prejudice, old dear." Vance's voice assumed a note
of raillery. "I'm a bit cynical myself, and the only person at the
Greene mansion I'd eliminate as a possibility would be Frau
Mannheim. She's not sufficiently imaginative to have planned this
accumulative massacre. But as regards the others, I could picture
any one of 'em as being at the bottom of this diabolical slaughter.
It's a mistaken idea, don't y' know, to imagine that a murderer
looks like a murderer. No murderer ever does. The only people who
really look like murderers are quite harmless. Do you recall the
mild and handsome features of the Reverend Richeson of Cambridge?
Yet he gave his inamorata cyanide of potassium. The fact that Major
Armstrong was a meek and gentlemanly-looking chap did not deter him
from feeding arsenic to his wife. Professor Webster of Harvard was
not a criminal type; but the dismembered spirit of Doctor Parkman
doubtless regards him as a brutal slayer. Doctor Lamson, with his
philanthropic eyes and his benevolent beard, was highly regarded as
a humanitarian; but he administered aconitine rather cold-bloodedly
to his crippled brother- in-law. Then there was Doctor Neil Cream,
who might easily have been mistaken for the deacon of a fashionable
church; and the soft-spoken and amiable Doctor Waite... And the
women! Edith Thompson admitted putting powdered glass in her
husband's gruel, though she looked like a pious Sunday-school
teacher. Madeleine Smith certainly had a most respectable
countenance. And Constance Kent was rather a beauty&mdash;a nice
girl with an engaging air; yet she cut her little brother's throat
in a thoroughly brutal manner. Gabrielle Bompard and Marie Boyer
were anything but typical of the <i>Donna Delinquente</i>; but the
one strangled her lover with the cord of her dressing-gown, and the
other killed her mother with a cheese-knife. And what of Madame
Fenayrou&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Enough!" protested Markham. "Your lecture on criminal
physiognomy can go over a while. Just now I'm trying to adjust my
mind to the staggering inferences to be drawn from your finding of
those galoshes." A sense of horror seemed to weigh him down. "Good
God, Vance! There must be some way out of this nightmare you've
propounded. What member of that household could possibly have
walked in on Rex Greene and shot him down in broad daylight?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, I don't know." Vance himself was deeply affected
by the sinister aspects of the case. "But someone in that house did
it&mdash;someone the others don't suspect."</p>

<p>"That look on Julia's face, and Chester's amazed
expression&mdash;that's what you mean, isn't it? They didn't
suspect either. And they were horrified at the
revelation&mdash;when it was too late. Yes, all those things fit in
with your theory."&mdash;</p>

<p>"But there's one thing that doesn't fit, old man." Vance gazed
at the table perplexedly. "Rex died peacefully, apparently unaware
of his murderer. Why wasn't there also a look of horror on his
face? His eyes couldn't have been shut when the revolver was
levelled at him, for he was standing, facing the intruder. It's
inexplicable&mdash;mad!"</p>

<p>He beat a nervous tattoo on the table, his brows contracted.</p>

<p>"And there's another thing, Markham, that's incomprehensible
about Rex's death. His door into the hall was open; but nobody
upstairs heard the shot&mdash;nobody <i>upstairs</i>. And yet
Sproot&mdash;who was downstairs, in the butler's pantry behind the
dining-room&mdash;heard it distinctly."</p>

<p>"It probably just happened that way," Markham argued, almost
automatically. "Sound acts fantastically sometimes."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nothing has 'just happened' in this case. There's a terrible
logic about everything&mdash;a carefully planned reason behind each
detail. Nothing has been left to chance. Still, this very
systematization of the crime will eventually prove the murderer's
downfall. When we can find a key to any one of the ante-rooms,
we'll know our way into the main chamber of horrors."</p>

<p>At that moment Markham was summoned to the telephone. When he
returned his expression was puzzled and uneasy.</p>

<p>"It was Swacker. Von Blon is at my office now&mdash;he has
something to tell me."</p>

<p>"Ah! Very interestin'," commented Vance.</p>

<p>We drove to the District Attorney's office, and Von Blon was
shown in at once.</p>

<p>"I may be stirring up a mare's nest," he began apologetically,
after he had seated himself on the edge of a chair. "But I felt I
ought to inform you of a curious thing that happened to me this
morning. At first I thought I would tell the police, but it
occurred to me they might misunderstand; and I decided to place the
matter before you to act upon as you saw fit."</p>

<p>Plainly he was uncertain as to how the subject should be
broached, and Markham waited patiently with an air of polite
indulgence.</p>

<p>"I phoned the Greene house as soon as I made
the&mdash;ah&mdash;discovery," Von Blon went on hesitantly. "But I
was informed you had left for the office; so, as soon as I had
lunched, I came directly here."</p>

<p>"Very good of you, doctor," murmured Markham. Again Von Blon
hesitated, and his manner became exaggeratedly ingratiating.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Mr. Markham, I am in the habit of carrying a
rather full supply of emergency drugs in my medicine-case..."</p>

<p>"Emergency drugs?"</p>

<p>"Strychnine, morphine, caffeine, and a variety of hypnotics and
stimulants. I find it often convenient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it was in connection with these drugs you wished to see
me?"</p>

<p>"Indirectly&mdash;yes." Von Blon paused momentarily to arrange
his words. "To- day it happened that I had in my case a fresh tube
of soluble quarter- grain morphine tablets, and a Parke-Davis
carton of four tubes of strychnine-thirtieths..."</p>

<p>"And what about this supply of drugs, doctor?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, the morphine and the strychnine have
disappeared."</p>

<p>Markham bent forward, his eyes curiously animated.</p>

<p>"They were in my case this morning when I left my office," Von
Blon explained; "and I made only two brief calls before I went to
the Greenes'. I missed the tubes when I returned to my office."</p>

<p>Markham studied the doctor a moment.</p>

<p>"And you think it improbable that the drugs were taken from your
case during either of your other calls?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. At neither place was the case out of my sight
for a moment."</p>

<p>"And at the Greenes'?" Markham's agitation was growing
rapidly.</p>

<p>"I went directly to Mrs. Greene's room, taking the case with me.
I remained there for perhaps half an hour. When I came
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did not leave the room during that hall-hour?"</p>

<p>"No..."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, doctor," came Vance's indolent voice; "but the nurse
mentioned that you called to her to bring Mrs. Greene's
<i>bouillon</i>. From where did you call?"</p>

<p>Von Blon nodded. "Ah, yes. I did speak to Miss Craven. I stepped
to the door and called up the servants' stairs."</p>

<p>"Quite so. And then?"</p>

<p>"I waited with Mrs. Greene until the nurse came. Then I went
across the hall to Sibella's room."</p>

<p>"And your case?" interjected Markham.</p>

<p>"I set it down in the hall, against the rear railing of the main
stairway."</p>

<p>"And you remained in Miss Sibella's room until Sproot called
you?"</p>

<p>"That is right."</p>

<p>"Then the case was unguarded in the rear of the upper hall from
about eleven until you left the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes. After I had taken leave of you gentlemen in the
drawing-room I went upstairs and got it."</p>

<p>"And also made your adieux to Miss Sibella," added Vance.</p>

<p>Von Blon raised his eyebrows with an air of gentle surprise.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"What amount of these drugs disappeared?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"The four tubes of strychnine contained in all approximately
three grains-three and one-third, to be exact. And there are
twenty-five tablets of morphine in a Parke-Davis tube, making six
and one-quarter grains."</p>

<p>"Are those fatal doses, doctor?"</p>

<p>"That's a difficult question to answer, sir." Von Blon adopted a
professional manner. "One may have a tolerance for morphine and be
capable of assimilating astonishingly large doses. But, <i>ceteris
paribus</i>, six grains would certainly prove fatal. Regarding
strychnine, toxicology gives us a very wide range as to lethal
dosage, depending on the condition and age of the patient. The
average fatal dose for an adult is, I should say, two grains,
though death has resulted from administrations of one grain, or
even less. And, on the other hand, recovery has taken place after
as much as ten grains have been swallowed. Generally speaking,
however, three and one-third grains would be sufficient to produce
fatal results."</p>

<p>When Von Blon had gone Markham gazed at Vance anxiously.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't like it&mdash;I don't at all like it." Vance shook his
head despairingly. "It's dashed queer&mdash;the whole thing. And
the doctor is worried, too. There's a panic raging beneath his
elegant facade. He's in a blue funk&mdash;and it's not because of
the loss of his pills. He fears something, Markham. There was a
strained, hunted look in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it strike you as strange that he should be carrying
such quantities of drugs about with him?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. Some doctors do it. The Continental M.D.'s
especially are addicted to the practice. And don't forget Von Blon
is German- trained..." Vance glanced up suddenly. "By the by, what
about those two wills?" There was a look of astonished
interrogation in Markham's incisive stare, but he said merely:</p>

<p>"I'll have them later this afternoon. Buckway has been laid up
with a cold, but he promised to send me copies to-day."</p>

<p>Vance got to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm no Chaldean," he drawled; "but I have an idea those two
wills may help us to understand the disappearance of the doctor's
pellets." He drew on his coat and took up his hat and stick. "And
now I'm going to banish this beastly affair from my
thoughts.&mdash;Come, Van. There's some good chamber-music at
Aeolian Hall this afternoon, and if we hurry we'll be in time for
the Mozart 'C-Major.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII - THE TWO WILLS</h2>

<p><b>(Tuesday, November 30th; 8 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>EIGHT o'clock that night found Inspector Moran, Sergeant Heath,
Markham, Vance, and me seated about a small conference-table in one
of the Stuyvesant Club's private rooms. The evening papers had
created a furore in the city with their melodramatic accounts of
Rex Greene's murder; and these early stories were, as we all knew,
but the mild forerunners of what the morning journals would
publish. The situation itself, without the inevitable impending
strictures of the Press, was sufficient to harry and depress those
in charge of the official investigation; and, as I looked round the
little circle of worried faces that night, I realized the
tremendous importance that attached to the outcome of our
conference.</p>

<p>Markham was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I have brought copies of the wills; but before we discuss them
I'd like to know if there have been any new developments."</p>

<p>"Developments!" Heath snorted contemptuously. "We've been going
round in a circle all afternoon, and the faster we went the quicker
we got to where we started. Mr. Markham, not one damn' thing turned
up to give us a line of inquiry. If it wasn't for the fact that no
gun was found in the room, I'd turn in a report of suicide and then
resign from the force."</p>

<p>"Fie on you, Sergeant!" Vance made a half-hearted attempt at
levity. "It's a bit too early to give way to such gloomy pessimism.
I take it that Captain Dubois found no finger-prints."</p>

<p>"Oh, he found finger-prints, all right&mdash;Ada's, and Rex's,
and Sproot's, and a couple of the doctor's. But that don't get us
anywheres."</p>

<p>"Where were the prints?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere&mdash;on the door-knobs, the centre-table, the
window-panes; some were even found on the woodwork above the
mantel."</p>

<p>"That last fact may prove interestin' some day, though it
doesn't seem to mean much just now.&mdash;Anything more about the
footprints?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I got Jerym's report late this afternoon; but it don't
say anything new. The galoshes you found made the tracks."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Sergeant. What did you do with the
galoshes?"</p>

<p>Heath gave him a sly, exultant grin.</p>

<p>"Just exactly what you'd have done with 'em, Mr. Vance.
Only&mdash;I thought of it first."</p>

<p>Vance smiled back.</p>

<p>"<i>Salve</i>! Yes, the idea entirely slipped my mind this
morning. In fact, it only just occurred to me."</p>

<p>"May I know what was done with the galoshes?" interjected
Markham impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why, the sergeant returned them surreptitiously to the
linen-closet, and placed them under the drugget whence they
came."</p>

<p>"Right!" Heath nodded with satisfaction. "And I've got our new
nurse keeping an eye on 'em. The minute they disappear she's to
phone the Bureau."</p>

<p>"You had no trouble installing your woman?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"A cinch. Everything went like clockwork. At a quarter to six
the doc shows up; then at six comes the woman from the Central
Office. After the doc has put her wise to her new duties, she gets
into her uniform and goes in to Mrs. Greene. The old lady tells the
doc she didn't like Miss Craven anyway, and hopes the new nurse
will show her more consideration. Things couldn't have gone
smoother. I hung around until I got a chance to tip our woman off
about the galoshes; then I came away."</p>

<p>"Which of our women did you give the case to, Sergeant?" Moran
asked.</p>

<p>"O'Brien&mdash;the one who handled the Sitwell affair. Nothing
in that house will get by O'Brien; and she's as strong as a
man."</p>

<p>"There's another thing you'd better speak to her about as soon
as possible." And Markham related in detail the facts of Von Blon's
visit to the office after lunch. "If those drugs were stolen in the
Greene mansion, your woman may be able to find some trace of
them."</p>

<p>Markham's account of the missing poisons had produced a profound
effect on both Heath and the inspector.</p>

<p>"Good heavens" exclaimed the latter. "Is this affair going to
develop into a poisoning case? It would be the finishing touch."
His apprehension went much deeper than his tone implied.</p>

<p>Heath sat staring at the polished table-top with futile
consternation.</p>

<p>"Morphine and strychnine There's no use looking for the stuff.
There's a hundred places in the house where it could be hid; and we
might search a month and not find it. Anyway, I'll go out there
to-night and tell O'Brien to watch for it. If she's on the look-out
she maybe can spot any attempt to use it."</p>

<p>"What astounds me," remarked the inspector, "is the security
felt by the thief. Within an hour of the time Rex Greene is shot
the poison disappears from the upper hall. Good gad! That's
cold-bloodedness for you! And nerve, too!"</p>

<p>"There's plenty of cold-bloodedness and nerve in this case,"
answered Vance. "A relentless determination is back of these
murders&mdash;and calculation no end. I wouldn't be surprised if
the doctor's satchel had been searched a score of times before.
Perhaps there's been a patient accumulation of the drugs. This
morning's theft may have been the final raid. I see in this whole
affair a carefully worked-out plot that's been in preparation
perhaps for years. We're dealing with the persistency of an
<i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>, and with the demoniacal logic of insanity.
And&mdash;what is even more hideous&mdash;we're confronted with the
perverted imagination of a fantastically romantic mind. We're
pitted against a fiery, egocentric, hallucinated optimism. And this
type of optimism has tremendous stamina and power. The history of
nations has been convulsed by it. Mohammed, Bruno, and Jeanne
d'Arc&mdash;as well as Torquemada, Agrippina, and
Robespierre&mdash;all had it. It operates in different degrees, and
to different ends; but the spirit of individual revolution is at
the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"Hell, Mr. Vance!" Heath was uneasy. "You're trying to make this
case something that ain't&mdash;well, natural."</p>

<p>"Can you make it anything else, Sergeant? Already there have
been three murders and an attempted murder. And now comes the theft
of the poisons from Von Blon."</p>

<p>Inspector Moran drew himself up and rested his elbows on the
table.</p>

<p>"Well, what's to be done? That, I believe, is the business of
to-night's conclave." He forced himself to speak with
matter-of-factness. "We can't break up the establishment; and we
can't assign a separate bodyguard for each remaining member of the
household."</p>

<p>"No; and we can't give 'em the works at the police station,
either," grumbled Heath.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't help you if you could, Sergeant," said Vance.
"There's no third degree known that could unseal the lips of the
person who is executing this particular <i>opus</i>. There's too
much fanaticism and martyrdom in it."</p>

<p>"Suppose we hear those wills, Mr. Markham," suggested Moran. "We
may then be able to figure out a motive.&mdash;You'll admit, won't
you, Mr. Vance, that there's a pretty strong motive back of these
killings?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt as to that. But I don't believe it's
money. Money may enter into it&mdash;and probably does&mdash;but
only as a contribut'ry factor. I'd say the motive was more
fundamental&mdash;that it had its matrix in some powerful but
suppressed human passion. However, the financial conditions may
lead us to those depths."</p>

<p>Markham had taken from his pocket several legal-sized sheets of
closely typed paper, and smoothed them on the table before him.</p>

<p>"There's no necessity to read these <i>verbatim</i>," he said.
"I've gone over them thoroughly and can tell you briefly what they
contain." He took up the top sheet and held it nearer to the light.
"Tobias Greene's last will, drawn up less than a year before his
death, makes the entire family, as you know, the residuary
devisees, with the stipulation that they live on the estate and
maintain it intact for twenty-five years. At the end of that time
the property may be sold or otherwise disposed of. I might mention
that the domiciliary stipulation was particularly strict: the
legatees must live in the Greene mansion <i>in esse</i>-no
technicality will suffice. They are permitted to travel and make
visits; but such absences may not exceed three months in each
respective year..."</p>

<p>"What provision was made in case one of them should marry?"
asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"None. Even marriage on the part of any of the legatees did not
vitiate the restrictions of the will. If a Greene married, he or
she had to live out the twenty-five years on the estate just the
same. The husband or wife could share the residence, of course. In
event of children the will provided for the erection of two other
small dwellings on the 52nd Street side of the lot. Only one
exception was made to these stipulations. If Ada should marry, she
could live elsewhere without losing her inheritance, as she
apparently was not Tobias's own child and could not, therefore,
carry on the blood line of the Greenes."</p>

<p>"What penalties attached to a breaking of the domiciliary terms
of the will?" Again the inspector put the question.</p>

<p>"Only one penalty&mdash;disinheritance, complete and
absolute."</p>

<p>"A rigid old bird," murmured Vance. "But the important thing
about the will is, I should say, the manner in which he left the
money. How was this distributed?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't distributed. With the exception of a few minor
bequests, it was left in its entirety to the widow. She was to have
the use of it during her lifetime, and could, at her death, dispose
of it to the children&mdash;and grandchildren, if any&mdash;as she
saw fit. It was imperative, however, that it all remain in the
family."</p>

<p>"Where do the present generation of Greenes get their living
expenses? Are they dependent on the old lady's bounty?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. A provision was made for them in this way: each of
the five children was to receive from the executors a stipulated
amount from Mrs. Greene's income, sufficient for personal needs."
Markham folded up the paper. "And that about covers Tobias's
will."</p>

<p>"You spoke of a few minor bequests," said Vance. What were
they?"</p>

<p>"Sproot was left a competency, for instance&mdash;enough to take
care of him comfortably whenever he wished to retire from service.
Mrs. Mannheim, also, was to receive an income for life beginning at
the end of the twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"Ah! Now, that's most interestin'. And in the meantime she
could, if she chose, remain as cook on a liberal salary."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the arrangement."</p>

<p>"The status of Frau Mannheim fascinates me. I have a feeling
that some day ere long she and I will have a heart-to-heart
talk.&mdash;Any other minor bequests?"</p>

<p>"A hospital, where Tobias recovered from typhus fever contracted
in the tropics; and a donation to the chair of criminology at the
University of Prague. I might mention too, as a curious item, that
Tobias left his library to the New York Police Department, to be
turned over to them at the expiration of the twenty-five
years."</p>

<p>Vance drew himself up with puzzled interest.</p>

<p>"Amazin'!"</p>

<p>Heath had turned to the inspector.</p>

<p>"Did you know anything about this, sir?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me I've heard of it. But a gift of books a quarter
of a century in the future isn't apt to excite the officials of the
force."</p>

<p>Vance, to all appearances, was smoking with indolent unconcern;
but the precise way he held his cigarette told me that some unusual
speculation was absorbing his mind.</p>

<p>"The will of Mrs. Greene," Markham went on, "touches more
definitely on present conditions, though personally I see nothing
helpful in it. She has been mathematically impartial in doling out
the estate. The five children&mdash;Julia, Chester, Sibella, Rex,
and Ada&mdash;receive equal amounts under its terms&mdash;that is,
each gets a fifth of the entire estate."</p>

<p>"That part of it don't interest me," put in the sergeant. "What
I want to know is, who gets all this money in case the others pass
outa the picture?"</p>

<p>"The provision covering that point is quite simple," explained
Markham. "Should any of the children die before a new will is
drawn, their share of the inheritance is distributed equally among
the remaining beneficiaries."</p>

<p>"Then when any one of 'em passes out, all the others benefit.
And if all of 'em, except one, should die, that one would get
everything&mdash;huh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So, as it stands now, Sibella and Ada would get
everything&mdash;fifty-fifty&mdash;provided the old lady
croaked."</p>

<p>"That's correct, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"But suppose both Sibella and Ada, as well as the old lady,
should die: what would become of the money?</p>

<p>"If either of the girls had a husband, the estate would pass to
him. But, in event of Sibella and Ada dying single, everything
would go to the State. That is to say, the State would get it
provided there were no relatives alive&mdash;which I believe is the
case."</p>

<p>Heath pondered these possibilities for several minutes.</p>

<p>"I can't see anything in the situation to give us a lead," he
lamented. "Everybody benefits equally by what's already happened.
And there's three of the family still left&mdash;the old lady and
the two girls."</p>

<p>"Two from three leaves one, Sergeant," suggested Vance
quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, sir?"</p>

<p>"The morphine and the strychnine."</p>

<p>Heath gave a start and made an ugly face.</p>

<p>"By God!" He struck the table with his fist. "It ain't coming to
that if I can stop it!" Then a sense of helplessness tempered his
outraged resolution, and he became sullen.</p>

<p>"I know how you feel." Vance spoke with troubled discouragement.
"But I'm afraid we'll all have to wait. If the Greene millions are
an actuating force in this affair, there's no way on earth to avert
at least one more tragedy."</p>

<p>"We might put the matter up to the two girls and perhaps induce
them to separate and go away," ventured the inspector.</p>

<p>"That would only postpone the inevitable," Vance returned. "And
besides, it would rob them of their patrimony."</p>

<p>"A court ruling might be obtained upsetting the provisions of
the will," submitted Markham dubiously. Vance gave him an ironical
smile.</p>

<p>"By the time you could get one of your beloved courts to act the
murderer would have had time to wipe out the entire local
judiciary."</p>

<p>For nearly two hours ways and means of dealing with the case
were discussed; but obstacles confronted nearly every line of
activity advocated. Finally it was agreed that the only practicable
tactics to be pursued were those of the routine police procedure.
However, before the conference broke up, certain specific decisions
had been taken. The guard about the Greene estate was to be
increased, and a man was to be placed on the upper floor of the
Narcoss Flats to keep a close watch on the front door and windows.
On some pretext or other a detective was to be kept inside of the
house as many hours as possible during the day; and the
telephone-line of the Greenes was to be tapped.</p>

<p>Vance insisted, somewhat against Markham's inclination, that
everyone in the house and every person who called
there&mdash;however seemingly remote his connection with the
case&mdash;should be regarded as a suspect and watched vigilantly;
and Heath was ordered by the inspector to convey this decision to
O'Brien, lest her instinctive partiality should result in the
relaxation of her scrutiny of certain persons. The sergeant, it
seemed, had already instituted a thorough investigation into the
private affairs of Julia, Chester, and Rex; and a dozen men were at
work on their associates and activities outside of the Greene
mansion, with special instructions to gather reports of
conversations which might have contained some hint or reference
indicating a foreknowledge or suspicion of the crimes.</p>

<p>Just as Markham rose to terminate the discussion Vance again
leaned forward and spoke.</p>

<p>"In case there is to be a poisoning we should, I think, be
prepared. Where overdoses of either morphine or strychnine are
administered immediate action will sometimes save the victim. I
would suggest that an official physician be placed in the Narcoss
Flats with the man set to watch the Greene windows; and he should
have at hand all the necessary apparatus and antidotes used in
combating morphine and strychnine poisoning. Furthermore, I would
suggest that we arrange some sort of signal with Sproot and the new
nurse, so that, should anything happen, our doctor can be summoned
without a moment's delay. If the victim of the attempted poisoning
were saved, we might be able to ascertain who administered the
drug."</p>

<p>The plan was readily agreed to. The inspector took it upon
himself to arrange the matter that night with one of the official
police surgeons; and Heath went at once to the Narcoss Flats to
secure a room facing the Greene mansion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII - IN THE LOCKED LIBRARY</h2>

<p><b>(Wednesday, December 1st; 1 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>VANCE, contrary to his custom, rose early the next morning. He
was rather waspish, and I left him severely alone. He made several
desultory attempts at reading, and once, when he put his book down,
I glanced at the title&mdash;he had chosen a life of Genghis Khan!
Later in the forenoon he attempted to busy himself with cataloguing
his Chinese prints.</p>

<p>We were to have lunch with Markham at the Lawyers Club at one
o'clock and at a little after twelve Vance ordered his powerful
Hispana-Suiza. He always drove himself when engaged on a problem:
the activity seemed to steady his nerves and clarify his brain.</p>

<p>Markham was waiting for us, and it was only too plain from his
expression that something of a disturbing nature had occurred.</p>

<p>"Unburden, old dear," invited Vance, when we were seated at our
table in a corner of the main dining-room. "You look as serious as
Saint John of Patmos. I'm sure something wholly to be expected has
happened. Have the galoshes disappeared?"</p>

<p>Markham looked at him with some wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes! The O'Brien woman called the Bureau at nine o'clock this
morning and reported that they had been removed from the
linen-closet during the night. They were there, however, when she
went to bed."</p>

<p>"And, of course, they have not been found."</p>

<p>"No. She made a pretty careful search before phoning."</p>

<p>"Fancy that. But she might have saved herself the trouble. What
does the doughty sergeant opine?"</p>

<p>"Heath reached the house before ten o'clock, and made an
investigation. But he learned nothing. No one admitted hearing any
sound in the hall during the night. He researched the house
himself, but without result."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Von Blon this morning?"</p>

<p>"No; but Heath saw him. He came to the house about ten and
stayed nearly an hour. He appeared very much upset over the stolen
drugs, and immediately asked if any trace of them had been found.
He spent most of the hour with Sibella."</p>

<p>"Ah, welladay! Let us enjoy our <i>truffes gastronome</i>
without the intrusion of unpleasant speculations. This Madeira
sauce, by the by, is very good." Thus Vance dismissed the
subject.</p>

<p>However, that luncheon was to prove a memorable one; for toward
the end of the meal Vance made a suggestion&mdash;or, rather,
insisted upon an action&mdash;that was eventually to solve and
explain the terrible tragedies at the Greene mansion. We had
reached our dessert when, after a long silence, he looked up at
Markham and said:</p>

<p>"The Pandora complex has seized and mastered me. I simply must
get into Tobias's locked library. That sacred adytum has begun to
infest my slumbers; and ever since you mentioned the legacy of
those books I've had no rest. I yearn to become acquainted with
Tobias's literary taste, and to learn why he should have selected
the police for his beneficiaries."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Vance, what possible connection?"</p>

<p>"Desist! You can't think of a question I have not already put to
myself; and I'm unable to answer any of them. But the fact remains,
I must inspect that library even if you have to get a judicial
order to batter down the door. There are sinister undercurrents in
that old house, Markham; and a hint or two may be found in that
secret room."</p>

<p>"It will be a difficult proceeding if Mrs. Greene stands firm on
her refusal to deliver the key to us." Markham, I could see, had
already acquiesced. He was in a mood to accede to any suggestion
that even remotely promised a clarification of the problem posed by
the Greene murders.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o'clock when we reached the house. Heath had
already arrived, in answer to a telephone call from Markham; and we
at once presented ourselves to Mrs. Greene. Following an ocular
sign from the sergeant the new nurse left the room; and Markham
went directly to the point. The old lady had eyed us suspiciously
as we came in, and now sat rigidly against her pile of pillows, her
gaze fixed on Markham with defensive animosity.</p>

<p>"Madam," he began, somewhat severely, "we regret the necessity
of this call. But certain things have arisen which make it
imperative that we visit Mr. Greene's library&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shan't" she broke in, her voice rising in an infuriated
crescendo. "You shan't put your foot in that room! Not for twelve
years has anyone passed the threshold, and no policeman now shall
desecrate the place where my husband spent the last years of his
life."</p>

<p>"I appreciate the sentiment that actuates your refusal," replied
Markham; "but graver considerations have intervened. The room will
have to be searched."</p>

<p>"Not if you kill me!" she cried. "How dare you force your way
into my house?"</p>

<p>Markham held up his hand authoritatively.</p>

<p>"I am not here to argue the matter. I came to you merely to ask
for the key. Of course, if you prefer to have us break down the
door..." He drew a sheaf of papers from his pocket. "I have secured
a search-warrant for that room; and it would cause me deep regret
to have to serve it on you." (I was amazed at his aggressive
daring, for I knew he had no warrant.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene broke forth with imprecations. Her anger became
almost insensate, and she was changed into a creature at once
repulsive and pitiful. Markham waited calmly for her paroxysm of
fury to pass; and when, her vituperation spent, she beheld his
quiet, inexorable bearing, she knew that she had lost. She sank
back, white and exhausted.</p>

<p>"Take the key," she capitulated bitterly, "and save me the final
infamy of having my house torn down by ruffians... It's in the
ivory jewel-case in the top drawer of that cabinet." She pointed
weakly to the lacquered high-boy.</p>

<p>Vance crossed the room and secured the key&mdash;a long,
old-fashioned instrument with a double bit and a filigreed bow.</p>

<p>"Have you always kept the key in this jewel-case, Mrs. Greene?"
he asked, as he closed the drawer.</p>

<p>"For twelve years," she whined. "And now, after all that time,
it is to be taken from me by force&mdash;and by the police, the
very police who should be protecting an old, helpless paralytic
like me. It's infamy! But what can I expect? Everyone takes delight
in torturing me."</p>

<p>Markham, his object gained, became contrite, and endeavoured to
pacify her by explaining the seriousness of the situation. But in
this he failed; and a few moments later he joined us in the
hall.</p>

<p>"I don't like this sort of thing, Vance," he said.</p>

<p>"You did remarkably well, however. If I hadn't been with you
since lunch I'd have believed you really had a search-warrant. You
are a veritable Machiavelli. <i>Te saluto</i>!"</p>

<p>"Get on with your business, now that you have the key," ordered
Markham irritably. And we descended to the main hall.</p>

<p>Vance looked about him cautiously to make sure we were not
observed, and led the way to the library.</p>

<p>"The lock works rather easily, considering its twelve years of
desuetude," he remarked, as he turned the key and gently pushed
open the massive oak door. "And the hinges don't even creak.
Astonishin'."</p>

<p>Blackness confronted us, and Vance struck a match.</p>

<p>"Please don't touch anything," he admonished, and, holding the
match high before him, he crossed to the heavy velour draperies of
the east window. As he drew them apart a cloud of dust filled the
air.</p>

<p>"These curtains, at least, have not been touched for years," he
said.</p>

<p>The grey light of mid-afternoon suffused the room, revealing an
astonishing retreat. The walls were lined with open book-shelves
which reached from the floor nearly to the ceiling, leaving only
space enough for a row of marble busts and squat bronze vases. At
the southern end of the room was a massive flat-topped desk, and in
the centre stood a long carved table laden with curious and
outlandish ornaments. Beneath the windows and in the corners were
piles of pamphlets and portfolios; and along the moulding of the
bookcases hung gargoyles and old prints yellow with age. Two
enormous Persian lamps of perforated brass depended from the
ceiling, and beside the centre-table stood a Chinese sconce eight
feet high. The floor was covered with overlapping Oriental rugs
laid at all angles; and at each end of the fire-place was a hideous
painted totem-pole reaching to the beams. A thick coating of dust
overlay everything.</p>

<p>Vance returned to the door and, striking another match, closely
examined the inner knob.</p>

<p>"Someone," he announced, "has been here recently. There's no
sign of dust on this knob."</p>

<p>"We might get the finger-prints," suggested Heath.</p>

<p>Vance shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not even worth trying. The person we're dealing with knows
better than to leave sign manuals."</p>

<p>He closed the door softly and threw the bolt. Then he looked
about him. Presently he pointed beneath a huge geographical globe
beside the desk.</p>

<p>"There are your galoshes, Sergeant. I thought they'd be
here."</p>

<p>Heath almost threw himself upon them, and carried them to the
window.</p>

<p>"They're the ones, all right," he declared.</p>

<p>Markham gave Vance one of his annoyed, calculating stares.</p>

<p>"You've got some theory," he asserted, in an accusing tone.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than I've already told you. The finding of the
galoshes was wholly incidental. I'm interested in other
things&mdash;just what, I don't know."</p>

<p>He stood near the centre-table and let his eyes roam over the
objects of the room. Presently his gaze came to rest on a low
wicker reading-chair, the right arm of which was shaped into a
book-rest. It stood within a few feet of the wall opposite to the
fire-place, facing a narrow section of book-shelves that was
surmounted by a replica of the Capitoline Museum bust of
Vespasian.</p>

<p>"Most untidy," he murmured. "I'm sure that chair wasn't left in
that position twelve years ago."</p>

<p>He moved forward, and stood looking down at it musingly.
Instinctively Markham and Heath followed him; and then saw the
thing that he had been contemplating. On the table-arm of the chair
was a deep saucer in which stood the thick stub of a candle. The
saucer was almost filled with smoky wax drippings.</p>

<p>"It took many candles to fill that dish," commented Vance; "and
I doubt if the departed Tobias did his reading by candle-light." He
touched the seat and the back of the chair, and then examined his
hand. "There's dust, but nowhere near a decade's accumulation.
Someone has been browsing in this library rather recently; and he
was dashed secretive about it. He didn't dare draw the shades or
turn on the lights. He sat here with a single candle, sampling
Tobias's brand of literature. And it apparently appealed to him,
for this one saucer contains evidence of many bookish nights. How
many other saucers of paraffin there were we don't know."</p>

<p>"The old lady could tell us who had a chance to put the key back
this morning after hiding the galoshes," offered Heath.</p>

<p>"No one put the key back this morning, Sergeant. The person who
was in the habit of visiting here wouldn't have stolen it and
returned it on each occasion when he could have had a duplicate
made in fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right." The sergeant was sorely perplexed. "But
as long as we don't know who's got the key, we're no better off
than we were."</p>

<p>"We're not quite through yet with our scrutiny of the library,"
rejoined Vance. "As I told Mr. Markham at lunch, my main object in
coming here was to ascertain Tobias's taste in literature."</p>

<p>"A lot of good that'll do you!"</p>

<p>"One can never tell. Tobias, remember, bequeathed his library to
the Police Department...Let's see with what tomes the old boy
whiled away his inactive hours."</p>

<p>Vance took out his monocle and, polishing it carefully, fitted
it to his eye. Then he turned to the nearest bookshelves. I stepped
forward and looked over his shoulder; and, as my glance ran over
the dusty titles, I could scarcely suppress an exclamation of
amazement. Here was one of the most complete and unusual private
libraries of criminology in America&mdash;and I was familiar with
many of the country's famous collections. Crime in all its phases
and ramifications was represented. Rare old treatises, long out of
print and now the delight of bibliophiles, shouldered one another
in compact tiers on Tobias Greene's shelves.</p>

<p>Nor were the subjects of these books limited to a narrow
interpretation of criminology. All the various allied branches of
the subject were represented. There were entire sections devoted to
insanity and cretinism, social and criminal pathology, suicide,
pauperism and philanthropy, prison reform, prostitution and
morphinism, capital punishment, abnormal psychology, legal codes,
the argot of the underworld and code writing, toxicology, and
police methods. The volumes were in many languages&mdash;English,
French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Dutch, and
Latin.*</p>

<p>Vance's eyes sparkled as he moved along the crowded shelves.
Markham also was deeply interested; and Heath, bending here and
there towards a volume, registered an expression of bewildered
curiosity.</p>

<p>"My word!" murmured Vance. "No wonder your department, Sergeant,
was chosen as the future custodian of these tomes. What a
collection! Extr'ordin'ry! Aren't you glad, Markham, you wangled
the old lady into relinquishing the key?"</p>

<p>Suddenly he stiffened and jerked his head toward the door, at
the same time lifting his hand for silence. I, too, had heard a
slight noise in the hall, like someone brushing against the
woodwork of the door, but had thought nothing of it. For a few
moments we waited tensely. But no further sound came to us, and
Vance stepped quickly to the door and drew it open. The hall was
empty. He stood on the threshold for a while listening. Then he
closed the door, and turned again to the room.</p>

<p>"I could have sworn someone was listening in the hall."</p>

<p>"I heard a rustle of some kind," Markham corroborated him. "I
took it for granted it was Sproot or the maid passing by."</p>

<p>"Why should anybody's hanging round the hall worry us, Mr.
Vance?" Heath asked.</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say, don't y' know. But it bothers me,
nevertheless. If someone was at the door listening, it shows that
our presence here has produced a state of anxiety in the person
privy to the fact. It's possible, d' ye see, that someone is
desirous of ascertaining what we have found out."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see that we've found out enough to make anybody
lose any sleep," mumbled Heath.</p>

<p>"You're so discouraging, Sergeant." Vance sighed and went to the
book- shelves in front of the wicker reading-chair. "There may be
something in this section to cheer us. Let us see if there's a glad
tiding or two written in the dust."</p>

<p>He struck match after match as he carefully inspected the tops
of the books, beginning at the highest shelf and systematically
scrutinizing the volumes of each row. He had reached the second
shelf from the floor when he bent over curiously and gave a second
long look at two thick grey volumes. Then, putting out the match,
he took the volumes to the window.</p>

<p>"The thing is quite mad," he remarked, after a brief
examination. "These are the only books within arm's reach of the
chair that have been handled recently. And what do you think they
are? An old two-volume edition of Professor Hans Gross's 'Handbuch
f&uuml;r Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik,'
or&mdash;to claw the title loosely into the vulgate&mdash;'A
Handbook on the Criminal Sciences for Examining Magistrates.'" He
gave Markham a look of facetious reproach. "I say, you haven't, by
any chance, been spending your nights in this library learning how
to ballyrag suspects?"</p>

<p>Markham ignored his levity. He recognised the outward sign of
Vance's inner uneasiness.</p>

<p>"The apparently irrelevant theme of the book," he returned,
"might indicate a mere coincidence between the visits of some
person to this room and the crimes committed in the house."</p>

<p>Vance made no answer. He thoughtfully returned the books to
their place and ran his eyes over the remaining volumes of the
bottom shelf. Suddenly he knelt down and struck another match.</p>

<p>"Here are several books out of place." I detected a subdued note
of eagerness in his voice. "They belong in other sections; and
they've been crowded in here a little out of alignment. Moreover,
they're innocent of dust... 'Pon my soul, Markham, here's a
coincidence for your sceptical legal mind! Lend an ear to these
titles: 'Poisons: Their Effects and Detection,' by Alexander Wynter
Blyth,* (*Dr. Blyth was one of the defence witnesses in the Crippen
trial) and 'Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence, Toxicology, and
Public Health,' by John Glaister, Professor of Forensic Medicine at
the University of Glasgow. And here we have Friedrich
Br&uuml;gelmann's 'Ueber hysterische Dammerzustande,' and
Schwarzwald's 'Ueber Hystero-Paralyse and Somnambulismus.' I say!
That's deuced queer..."</p>

<p>He rose and walked up and down, agitated.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; absolutely not," he muttered. "It simply can't
be... Why should Von Blon lie to us about her?"</p>

<p>We all knew what was in his mind. Even Heath sensed it at once,
for, though he did not speak German, the titles of the two German
books&mdash;especially the latter &mdash;needed no translation to
be understood. Hysteria and twilight sleep! Hysterical paralysis
and somnambulism! The gruesome and terrible implication in these
two titles, and their possible relation to the sinister tragedies
of the Greene mansion, sent a chill of horror over me.</p>

<p>Vance stopped his restless pacing and fixed a grave gaze on
Markham.</p>

<p>"This thing gets deeper and deeper.&mdash;Something unthinkable
is going on here.&mdash;Come, let us get out of this polluted room.
It has told us its gibbering, nightmarish story. And now we will
have to interpret it&mdash;find some glimmer of sanity in its black
suggestions.&mdash;Sergeant, will you draw the curtains while I
straighten these books? We'd best leave no evidence of our
visit."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX - SHERRY AND PARALYSIS</h2>

<p><b>(Wednesday, December 1st; 4.30 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>WHEN we returned to Mrs. Greene's room the old lady was
apparently sleeping peacefully and we did not disturb her. Heath
gave the key to Nurse O'Brien with instructions to replace it in
the jewel-case, and we went downstairs.</p>

<p>Although it was but a little past four o'clock, the early winter
twilight had already descended. Sproot had not yet lighted the
lamps, and the lower hall was in semidarkness. A ghostly atmosphere
pervaded the house. Even the silence was oppressive, and seemed
fraught with the spirit of commination. We went straight to the
hall-table where we had thrown our coats, eager to get out into the
open air.</p>

<p>But we were not to shake the depressing influence of the old
mansion so quickly. We had scarcely reached the table when there
came a slight stirring of the porti&egrave;res of the archway
opposite to the drawing-room, and a tense, whispered voice
said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Vance&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>We turned, startled. There, just inside of the reception-room,
hiding behind the heavy draperies, stood Ada, her face a patch of
ghastly white in the gathering gloom. With one finger placed on her
lips for silence, she beckoned to us; and we stepped softly into
the chill, unused room.</p>

<p>"There's something I must tell you," she said, in a
half-whisper&mdash; "something terrible! I was going to telephone
you to-day, but I was afraid..." A fit of trembling seized her.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Ada," Vance encouraged her soothingly. "In
a few days all these awful things will be over.&mdash;What have you
to tell us?"</p>

<p>She made an effort to draw herself together, and when the tremor
had passed she went on hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Last night&mdash;it was long after midnight&mdash;I woke, and
felt hungry. So I got up, slipped on a wrap, and stole downstairs.
Cook always leaves something in the pantry for me..." Again she
stopped, and her haunted eyes searched our faces. "But when I
reached the lower landing of the stairs I heard a soft, shuffling
sound in the hall&mdash;far back, near the library door. My heart
was in my mouth, but I made myself look over the banister. And just
then-someone struck a match..."!</p>

<p>Her trembling began afresh, and she clutched Vance's arm with
both hands. I was afraid the girl was going to faint, and I moved
closer to her; but Vance's voice seemed to steady her.</p>

<p>"Who was it, Ada?"</p>

<p>She caught her breath and looked about her, her face the picture
of deadly fear. Then she leaned forward.</p>

<p>"It was mother... <i>And she was walking</i>!"</p>

<p>The dread significance of this revelation chilled us all into
silence. After a moment a choked whistle escaped Heath; and Markham
threw back his head like a man shaking himself out of an
encroaching spell of hypnosis. It was Vance who first recovered
himself sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>"Your mother was near the library door?"</p>

<p>Yes; and it seemed as though she held a key in her hand."</p>

<p>"Was she carrying anything else?" Vance's effort at calmness was
only half successful.</p>

<p>"I didn't notice&mdash;I was too terrified."</p>

<p>"Could she, for instance, have been carrying a pair of
galoshes?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"She might have been. I don't know. She had on her long Oriental
shawl, and it fell down about her in folds. Maybe under the
shawl... Or she might have put them down when she struck the match.
I only knew I saw her&mdash;moving slowly... there in the
darkness."</p>

<p>The memory of that unbelievable vision completely took
possession of the girl. Her eyes stared, trance-like, into the
deepening shadows.</p>

<p>Markham cleared his throat nervously.</p>

<p>"You say yourself it was dark in the hall last night, Miss
Greene. Perhaps your fears got the better of you. Are you sure it
might not have been Hemming or the cook?"</p>

<p>She brought her eyes back to Markham with sudden resentment.</p>

<p>"No!" Then her voice took on its former note of terror. "It was
mother. The match was burning close to her face, and there was a
terrible look in her eyes. I was only a few feet from
her&mdash;looking straight down on her."</p>

<p>Her hold on Vance's arm tightened, and once more her agonized
gaze turned to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it mean? I thought&mdash;I thought mother could
never walk again."</p>

<p>Vance ignored her anguished appeal.</p>

<p>"Tell me this, for it's very important: did your mother see
you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know." Her words were scarcely audible. "I drew
back and ran softly up the stairs. Then I locked myself in my
room."</p>

<p>Vance did not speak at once. He regarded the girl for a moment,
and then gave her a slow, comforting smile.</p>

<p>"And I think your room is the best place for you now," he said.
"Don't worry over what you saw; and keep what you have told us to
yourself. There's nothing to be afraid of. Certain types of
paralytics have been known to walk in their sleep under the stress
of shock or excitement. Anyway, we'll arrange for the new nurse to
sleep in your room to-night." And with a friendly pat on her arm he
sent her upstairs.</p>

<p>After Heath had given Miss O'Brien the necessary instructions,
we left the house and walked toward First Avenue.</p>

<p>"Good God, Vance!" said Markham huskily. "We've got to move
quickly. That child's story opens up new and frightful
possibilities."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get a commitment for the old woman to some
sanatorium to- morrow, sir?" asked Heath.</p>

<p>"On what grounds? It's a pathological case, pure and simple. We
haven't a scrap of evidence."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't attempt it, in any event," interposed Vance. "We
mustn't be hasty. There are several conclusions to be drawn from
Ada's story; and if the thing that all of us is thinking should be
wrong, we'd only make matters worse by a false move. We might delay
the slaughter for the time being; but we'd learn nothing. And our
only hope is to find out&mdash;some way&mdash;what's at the bottom
of this atrocious business."</p>

<p>"Yeh? And how are we going to do that, Mr. Vance?" Heath spoke
with despair.</p>

<p>"I don't know now. But the Greene household is safe for
to-night, anyway; and that gives us a little time. I think I'll
have another talk with Von Blon. Doctors&mdash;especially the
younger ones&mdash;are apt to give snap diagnoses."</p>

<p>"It can certainly do no harm," agreed Markham. "And it might
bring forth something suggestive. When will you tackle him?"</p>

<p>Heath had hailed a taxicab, and we were headed down-town along
Third Avenue.</p>

<p>Vance was gazing out of the window.</p>

<p>"Why not at once?" Suddenly his mood had changed. "Here we are
in the Forties. And tea-time! What could be more opportune?"</p>

<p>He leaned over and gave the chauffeur an order.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the taxicab drew up to the kerb before Von
Blon's brown- stone residence.</p>

<p>The doctor received us apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, I hope?" he asked, trying to read our faces.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Vance answered easily. "We were passing and thought
we'd drop in for a dish of tea and a medical chat."</p>

<p>Von Blon studied him with a slight suspicion.</p>

<p>"Very well. You gentlemen shall have both." He rang for his man.
"But I can do even better. I've some old Amontillado
sherry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My word!" Vance bowed ceremoniously and turned to Markham. "You
see how fortune favours her punctual children?"</p>

<p>The wine was brought and carefully decanted.</p>

<p>Vance took up his glass and sipped it. One would have thought,
from his manner, that nothing in the world at that moment was as
important as the quality of the wine.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear doctor," he remarked, with some ostentation, "the
blender on the sunny Andalusian slopes unquestionably had many rare
and valuable butts with which to glorify this vintage. There was
little need for the addition of <i>vino dulce</i> that year; but,
then, the Spaniards always sweeten their wine, probably because the
English object to the slightest dryness. And it's the English, you
know, who buy all the best sherries. They have always loved their
'sherris-sack'; and many a British bard has immortalized it in
song. Ben Jonson sang its praises, and so did Tom Moore and Byron.
But it was Shakespeare&mdash;an ardent lover of sherry
himself&mdash;who penned the greatest and most passionate panegyric
to it. You remember Falstaff's 'apostrophe?&mdash;'It ascends me
into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy
vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive,
full of nimble, fiery and delectable shapes...' Sherry, you
probably know, doctor, was once regarded as a cure for gout and
other <i>malaises</i> of faulty metabolism." He paused and put down
his glass.</p>

<p>"I wonder that you haven't prescribed this delicious sherry for
Mrs. Greene long ago. I'm sure she would serve you with a writ of
confiscation if she knew you had it."</p>

<p>"The fact is," Von Blon returned, "I once took her a bottle, and
she gave it to Chester. She doesn't care for wine. I remember my
father's telling me she objected violently to her husband's
well-stocked cellar."</p>

<p>"Your father died, did he not, before Mrs. Greene became
paralyzed?" Vance asked incuriously.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;about a year."</p>

<p>"And was yours the only diagnosis made of her case?"</p>

<p>Von Blon looked at him with an air of gentle surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw no necessity of calling in any of the bigwigs. The
symptoms were clear-cut and conformed with the ananmesis.
Furthermore, everything since then has confirmed my diagnosis."</p>

<p>"And yet, doctor"&mdash;Vance spoke with great
deference&mdash;"something has occurred which, from the layman's
point of view, tends to cast doubt on the accuracy of that
diagnosis. Therefore, I feel sure you will forgive me when I ask
you quite frankly if it would not be possible to place another, and
perhaps less serious, interpretation on Mrs. Greene's
invalidism."</p>

<p>Von Blon appeared greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>"There is," he said, "not the slightest possibility that Mrs.
Greene is suffering from any disease other than an organic
paralysis of both legs&mdash; a paraplegia, in fact, of the entire
lower part of the body."</p>

<p>"If you were to see Mrs. Greene move her legs, what would be
your mental reaction?"</p>

<p>Von Blon stared at him incredulously. Then he forced a
laugh.</p>

<p>"My mental reaction? I'd know my liver was out of order, and
that I was having hallucinations."</p>

<p>"And if you knew your liver was functioning perfectly&mdash;then
what?"</p>

<p>"I'd immediately become a devout believer in miracles."</p>

<p>Vance smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope it won't come to that. And yet so-called
therapeutic miracles have happened."</p>

<p>"I'll admit that medical history is filled with what the
uninitiated call miraculous cures. But there is sound pathology
beneath all of them. In Mrs. Greene's case, however, I can see no
loophole for error. If she should move her legs, it would
controvert all the known laws of physiology."</p>

<p>"By the by, doctor"&mdash;Vance put the question
abruptly&mdash;"are you familiar with Brugelmann's 'Ueber
hysterische D&auml;mmerzust&auml;nde'?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can't say that I am."</p>

<p>"Or with Schwarzwald's 'Ueber Hystero-Paralyse und
Somnambulismus'?"</p>

<p>Von Blon hesitated, and his eyes were focused intently like
those of a man who is thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>"I knew Schwarzwald, of course," he answered. "But I'm ignorant
of the particular work you mention..." Slowly a look of amazement
dawned on his face. "Good heavens You're not trying to connect the
subjects of these books with Mrs. Greene's condition, are you?"</p>

<p>"If I were to tell you that both of these books are in the
Greene mansion, what would you say?"</p>

<p>"I'd say their presence is no more relevant to the situation
there than would be a copy of 'Die Leiden des jungen Werther' or
Heine's 'Romanzero.'"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't agree with you," returned Vance politely.
"They are certainly relevant to our investigation, and I had hoped
you might be able to explain the connection."</p>

<p>Von Blon appeared to ponder the matter, his face the picture of
perplexity.</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you," he said, after several moments. Then
he glanced up quickly; a new light had come into his eyes. "Permit
me to suggest, sir, that you are labouring under a misapprehension
as to the correct scientific connotation of the words in the titles
of these two books. I have had occasion to do considerable reading
along psycho- analytic lines; and both Freud and Jung use the terms
'<i>Somnambulismus</i>' and '<i>D&auml;mmerzust&auml;nde</i>' in an
entirely different sense from our common use of the terms
'somnambulism' and 'twilight sleep. '<i>Somnambulismus</i>,' in the
terminology of psychopathology and abnormal psychology, is employed
in connection with ambivalence and dual personality: it designates
the actions of the submerged, or subconscious, self in cases of
aphasia, amnesia, and the like. It does not refer to one's walking
in one's sleep. For instance, in psychic hysteria where one loses
one's memory and adopts a new personality, the subject is called a
<i>Somnambule</i>.' It is the same as what the newspapers commonly
refer to as an 'amnesia victim.'"</p>

<p>He rose and went to a bookcase. After a few moments' search he
took down several volumes.</p>

<p>"Here we have, for example, an old monograph by Freud and
Breuer, written in 1893 and entitled 'Ueber den psychischen
Mechanismus der hysterischen Phenomene.' If you care to take the
trouble to read it, you will see that it is an exposition of the
application of the term '<i>Somnambulismus</i>' to certain
temporary neurotic derangements.&mdash;And here also is Freud's
'Traumdeutung,' published in 1894, in which this terminology is
explained and amplified.&mdash;In addition to these, I have here
'Nerv&ouml;se Angstzust&auml;nde,' by Stekel, who, though he leads
one of the most important schisms in the Freudian school, uses the
same nomenclature in referring to split personality." He laid the
three books on the table before Vance. "You may take them along if
you like. They may throw some light on the quandary you are
in."</p>

<p>"You are inclined to believe, then, that both Schwarzwald and
Brugelmann refer to waking psychic states rather than the more
common type of somnambulism?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am inclined to that belief. I know Schwarzwald was a
former lecturer at the Psychopatisches Institut, in constant
contact with Freud and his teachings. But, as I told you, I am not
familiar with either of the books."</p>

<p>"How would you account for the term 'hysteria' in both
titles?"</p>

<p>"Its presence there is in no way contradictory. Aphasia,
amnesia, aphonia&mdash;and often anosmia and apnoea&mdash;are
symptoms of hysteria. And hysterical paralysis is quite common.
There are many cases of paralytics who have been unable to move a
muscle for years, as a result of sheer hysteria."</p>

<p>"Ah, exactly!" Vance picked up his glass and drained it. "That
brings me to a rather unusual request I desire to make.&mdash;As
you know, the papers are waxing severe in their criticism of the
police and the District Attorney's office, and are accusing of
negligence everyone connected with the investigation of the Greene
case. Therefore Mr. Markham has decided that it might be advisable
for him to possess a report of Mrs. Greene's physical condition
which would carry the very highest expert authority. And I was
going to suggest that, merely as a matter of formal routine, we get
such a report from, let us say, Doctor Felix Oppenheimer."*
(*Doctor Felix Oppenheimer was then the leading authority on
paralysis in America. He has since returned to Germany, where he
now holds the chair of neurology at the University of
Freiburg.)</p>

<p>Von Blon did not speak for several minutes. He sat toying
nervously with his glass, his eyes fixed with intent calculation on
Vance.</p>

<p>"It might be well for you to have the report," he acceded at
last, "if only to dispel your own doubts on the subject.&mdash;No,
I have no objection to the plan. I will be very glad to make the
arrangements."</p>

<p>Vance rose.</p>

<p>"That's very generous of you, doctor. But I must urge you to
attend to it without delay."</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly. I will get in touch with Doctor
Oppenheimer in the morning and explain to him the official
character of the situation. I'm sure he will expedite matters."</p>

<p>When we were again in the taxicab Markham gave voice to his
perplexity.</p>

<p>"Von Blon strikes me as a particularly able and trustworthy man.
And yet he has obviously gone woefully astray in regard to Mrs.
Greene's illness. I fear he's in for a shock when he hears what
Oppenheimer has to say after the examination."</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," said Vance sombrely, "I'll feel infinitely
bucked if we succeed in getting that report from Oppenheimer."</p>

<p>"Succeed! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, I don't know what I mean. I only know that
there's a black terrible intrigue of some kind going on at the
Greene house. And we don't yet know who's back of it. But it's
someone who's watching us, who knows every move we make, and is
thwarting us at every turn."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX - THE FOURTH TRAGEDY</h2>

<p><b>(Thursday, December 2nd; forenoon)</b>
</p>

<p>THE following day was one that will ever remain in my memory.
Despite the fact that what happened had been foreseen by all of us,
nevertheless when it actually came it left us as completely stunned
as if it had been wholly unexpected. Indeed, the very horror that
informed our anticipation tended to intensify the enormity of the
event.</p>

<p>The day broke dark and threatening. A damp chill was in the air;
and the leaden skies clung close to the earth with suffocating
menace. The weather was like a symbol of our gloomy spirits.</p>

<p>Vance rose early, and, though he said little, I knew the case
was preying on his mind. After breakfast he sat before the fire for
over an hour sipping his coffee and smoking. Then he made an
attempt to interest himself in an old French edition of "Till
Ulenspiegel," but, failing, took down volume seven of Osler's
"Modern Medicine" and turned to Buzzard's article on myelitis. For
an hour he read with despairing concentration. At last he returned
the book to the shelves.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven Markham telephoned to inform us that he was
leaving the office immediately for the Greene mansion and would
stop <i>en route</i> to pick us up. He refused to say more, and
hung up the receiver abruptly.</p>

<p>It wanted ten minutes of being noon when he arrived; and his
expression of grim discouragement told us more plainly than words
that another tragedy had occurred.</p>

<p>We had on our coats in readiness and accompanied him at once to
the car.</p>

<p>"And who is it this time?" asked Vance, as we swung into Park
Avenue.</p>

<p>"Ada." Markham spoke bitterly through his teeth.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that, after what she told us
yesterday.&mdash;With poison, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the morphine."</p>

<p>"Still, it's an easier death than strychnine-poisoning."</p>

<p>"She's not dead, thank God!" said Markham. "That is, she was
still alive when Heath phoned."</p>

<p>"Heath? Was he at the house?"</p>

<p>"No. The nurse notified him at the Homicide Bureau, and he
phoned me from there. He'll probably be at the Greenes' when we
arrive."</p>

<p>"You say she isn't dead?"</p>

<p>"Drumm&mdash;he's the official police surgeon Moran stationed in
the Narcoss Flats&mdash;got there immediately, and had managed to
keep her alive up to the time the nurse phoned."</p>

<p>"Sproot's signal worked all right, then?"</p>

<p>"Apparently. And I want to say, Vance, that I'm damned grateful
to you for that suggestion to have a doctor on hand."</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Greene mansion Heath, who had been
watching for us, opened the door.</p>

<p>"She ain't dead," he greeted us in a stage whisper; and then
drew us into the reception-room to explain his secretive manner.
"Nobody in the house except Sproot and O'Brien knows about this
poisoning yet. Sproot found her, and then pulled down all the front
curtains in this room&mdash;which was the signal agreed on. When
Doc Drumm hopped across Sproot was waiting with the door open, and
took him upstairs without anybody seeing him. The doc sent for
O'Brien, and after they'd worked on the girl for a while he told
her to notify the Bureau. They're both up in the room now with the
doors locked."</p>

<p>"You did right in keeping the thing quiet," Markham told him.
"If Ada recovers we can hush it up and perhaps learn something from
her."</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking, sir. I told Sproot I'd wring his
scrawny neck if he spilled anything to anybody."</p>

<p>"And," added Vance, "he bowed politely and said 'Yes, sir.'"</p>

<p>"You bet your life he did!"</p>

<p>"Where is the rest of the household at present?" Markham
asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Sibella's in her room. She had breakfast in bed at
half-past ten and told the maid she was going back to sleep. The
old lady's also asleep. The maid and the cook are in the back of
the house somewhere."</p>

<p>"Has Von Blon been here this morning?" put in Vance.</p>

<p>"Sure he's been here&mdash;he comes regular. O'Brien said he
called at ten, sat with the old lady about an hour, and then went
away."</p>

<p>"And he hasn't been notified about the morphine?"</p>

<p>"What's the use? Drumm's a good doctor, and Von Blon might blab
about it to Sibella or somebody."</p>

<p>"Quite right." Vance nodded his approval.</p>

<p>We re-entered the hall and divested ourselves of our wraps.</p>

<p>"While we're waiting for Doctor Drumm," said Markham, "we might
as well find out what Sproot knows."</p>

<p>We went into the drawing-room, and Heath yanked the bell-cord.
The old butler came directly and stood before us without the
slightest trace of emotion. His imperturbability struck me as
inhuman.</p>

<p>Markham beckoned him to come nearer.</p>

<p>"Now, Sproot, tell us exactly what took place."</p>

<p>"I was in the kitchen resting, sir"&mdash;the man's voice was as
wooden as usual&mdash;"and I was just looking at the clock and
thinking I would resume my duties, when the bell of Miss Ada's room
rang. Each bell, you understand, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that! What time was it?"</p>

<p>"It was exactly eleven o'clock. And, as I said, Miss Ada's bell
rang. I went right upstairs and knocked on her door; but, as there
was no answer, I took the liberty of opening it and looking into
the room. Miss Ada was lying on the bed; but it was not a natural
attitude&mdash;if you understand what I mean. And then I noticed a
very peculiar thing, sir. Miss Sibella's little dog was on the
bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was there a chair or stool by the bed?" interrupted Vance.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I believe there was. An ottoman."</p>

<p>"So the dog could have climbed on the bed unassisted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good. Continue."</p>

<p>"Well, the dog was on the bed, and he looked like he was
standing on his hind legs playing with the bell-cord. But the
peculiar thing was that his hind legs were on Miss Ada's face, and
she didn't seem to even notice it. Inwardly I was a bit startled;
and I went to the bed and picked up the dog. Then I discovered that
several threads of the silk tassel on the end of the cord had got
caught between his teeth; and-would you believe it, sir?-it was him
who had really rung Miss Ada's bell..."</p>

<p>"Amazin'," murmured Vance. "What then, Sproot?"</p>

<p>"I shook the young lady, although I had little hope of waking
her after Miss Sibella's dog had been trampling over her face
without her knowing it. Then I came downstairs and drew the
curtains in the reception-room as I had been instructed to do in
case of an emergency. When the doctor arrived I showed him to Miss
Ada's room."</p>

<p>"And that's all you know?"</p>

<p>"Everything, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sproot." Markham rose impatiently.</p>

<p>"And now you might let Doctor Drumm know that we are here."</p>

<p>It was the nurse, however, who came to the drawing-room a few
minutes later. She was a medium-sized, well-built woman of
thirty-five, with shrewd brown eyes, a thin mouth, and a firm chin,
and a general air of competency. She greeted Heath with a
companionable wave of the hand and bowed to the rest of us with
aloof formality.</p>

<p>"Doc Drumm can't leave his patient just now," she informed us,
seating herself. "So he sent me along. He'll be down
presently."</p>

<p>"And what's the report?" Markham was still standing.</p>

<p>"She'll live, I guess. We've been giving her passive exercise
and artificial breathing for half an hour, and the doc hopes to
have her walking before long."</p>

<p>Markham, his nervousness somewhat abated, sat down again.</p>

<p>"Tell us all you can, Miss O'Brien. Was there any evidence as to
how the poison was administered?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but an empty bouillon cup." The woman was ill at ease.
"I guess you'll find remains of morphine in it, all right."</p>

<p>"Why do you think the drug was given by means of the
bouillon?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and shot Heath an uneasy look.</p>

<p>"It's this way. I always bring a cup of bouillon to Mrs. Greene
a little before eleven in the morning; and if Miss Ada's around I
bring two cups&mdash; that's the old lady's orders. This morning
the girl was in the room when I went down to the kitchen, so I
brought up two cups. But Mrs. Greene was alone when I returned, so
I gave the old lady hers and put the other cup in Miss Ada's room
on the table by the bed. Then I went into the hall to call her. She
was downstairs&mdash;in the living-room, I guess. Anyhow, she came
up right away, and, as I had some mending to do for Mrs. Greene, I
went to my room on the third floor..."</p>

<p>"Therefore," interpolated Markham, "the bouillon was on Miss
Ada's table unprotected for a minute or so after you had left the
room and before Miss Ada came up from the lower hall."</p>

<p>"It wasn't over twenty seconds. And I was right outside the door
all the time. Furthermore, the door was open, and I'd have heard
anyone in the room." The woman was obviously defending herself
desperately against the imputation of negligence in Markham's
remark.</p>

<p>Vance put the next question.</p>

<p>"Did you see anyone else in the hall besides Miss Ada?"</p>

<p>"No one except Doctor Von Blon. He was in the lower hall getting
into his coat when I called down."</p>

<p>"Did he leave the house at once?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You actually saw him pass through the door?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o. But he was putting on his coat, and he had said
good bye to Mrs. Greene and me..."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Not two minutes before. I'd met him coming out of Mrs. Greene's
door just as I brought in the bouillon."</p>

<p>"And Miss Sibella's dog&mdash;did you notice it in the hall
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No; it wasn't around when I was there."</p>

<p>Vance lay back drowsily in his chair, and Markham again took up
the interrogation.</p>

<p>"How long did you remain in your room, Miss O'Brien, after you
had called Miss Ada?"</p>

<p>"Until the butler came and told me that Doctor Drumm wanted
me."</p>

<p>"And how much later would you say that was?"</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes&mdash;maybe a little longer."</p>

<p>Markham smoked pensively a while.</p>

<p>"Yes," he commented at length; "it plainly appears that the
morphine was somehow added to the bouillon.&mdash;You'd better
return to Doctor Drumm now, Miss O'Brien. We'll wait here for
him."</p>

<p>"Hell!" growled Heath, after the nurse had gone upstairs. "She's
the best woman for this sort of a job that we've got. And now she
goes and falls down on it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say she'd fallen down exactly, Sergeant." dissented
Vance, his eyes fixed dreamily on the ceiling. "After all, she only
stepped into the hall for a few seconds to summon the young lady to
her matutinal broth. And if the morphine hadn't found its way into
the bouillon this morning it would have done so to-morrow, or the
day after, or some time in the future. In fact, the propitious gods
may actually have favoured us this morning as they did the Grecian
host before the walls of Troy."</p>

<p>"They will have favoured us," observed Markham, "if Ada recovers
and can tell us who visited her room before she drank the
bouillon."</p>

<p>The silence that ensued was terminated by the entrance of Doctor
Drumm, a youthful, earnest man with an aggressive bearing. He sank
heavily into a chair and wiped his face with a large silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"She's pulled through," he announced. "I happened to be standing
by the window looking out&mdash;sheer chance&mdash;when I saw the
curtains go down&mdash;saw 'em before Hennessey* did. (*Hennessey
was the detective stationed in the Narcoss Flats to watch the
Greene mansion.) I grabbed up my bag and the pulmotor, and was over
here in a jiffy. The butler was waiting at the door, and took me
upstairs. Queer crab, that butler. The girl was lying across the
bed, and it didn't take but one look to see that I wasn't dealing
with strychnine. No spasms or sweating or risus sardonicus, you
understand. Quiet and peaceful; shallow breathing; cyanosis.
Morphine evidently. Then I looked at her pupils. Pinpoints. No
doubt now. So I sent for the nurse and got busy."</p>

<p>"A close call?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"Close enough." The doctor nodded importantly. "You can't tell
what would have happened if somebody hadn't got to her in a hurry.
I figured she'd got all six grains that were lost, and gave her a
good stiff hypo of atropine&mdash;a fiftieth. It reacted like a
shot. Then I washed her stomach out with potassium permanganate.
After that I gave her artificial respiration&mdash;she didn't seem
to need it, but I wasn't taking any chances. Then the nurse and I
got busy exercising her arms and legs, trying to keep her awake.
Tough work, that. Hope I don't get pneumonia sweating there with
the windows all open... Well, so it went. Her breathing kept
getting better, and I gave her another hundredth of atropine for
good measure. At last I managed to get her on her feet. The nurse
is walking her up and down now." He mopped his face again with a
triumphant flourish of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"We're greatly indebted to you, doctor," said Markham. "It's
quite possible you have been the means of solving this
case.&mdash;When will we be able to question your patient?"</p>

<p>"She'll be loggy and nauseated all day&mdash;kind of general
collapse, you understand, with painful breathing, drowsiness,
headache, and that sort of thing&mdash;no fit condition to answer
questions. But to-morrow morning you'll be able to talk to her as
much as you like."</p>

<p>"That will be satisfactory. And what of the bouillon cup the
nurse mentioned?"</p>

<p>"It tasted bitter&mdash;morphine, all right."</p>

<p>As Drumm finished speaking Sproot passed down the hall to the
front door. A moment later Von Blon paused at the archway and
looked into the drawing-room. The strained silence which followed
the exchange of greetings caused him to study us with growing
alarm.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened?" he finally asked.</p>

<p>It was Vance who rose and, with quick decision, assumed the
r&ocirc;le of spokesman.</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor. Ada has been poisoned with morphine. Doctor Drumm
here happened to be in the Narcoss Flats opposite and was called
in."</p>

<p>"And Sibella&mdash;is she all right?" Von Blon spoke
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite."</p>

<p>A relieved sigh escaped him, and he sank into a chair. "Tell me
about it. When was the&mdash;the murder discovered?"</p>

<p>Drumm was about to correct him when Vance said quickly:</p>

<p>"Immediately after you left the house this morning. The poison
was administered in the bouillon the nurse brought from the
kitchen."</p>

<p>"But... how could that be?" Von Blon appeared unbelieving. "I
was just going when she brought the bouillon. I saw her enter with
it. How could the poison&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That reminds me, doctor." Vance's tone was almost dulcet. "Did
you, by any hap, go upstairs again after you had donned your
coat?"</p>

<p>Von Blon looked at him with outraged astonishment. "Certainly
not! I left the house immediately."</p>

<p>"That would have been just after the nurse called down to
Ada."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes. I believe the nurse did call down; and Ada went
upstairs at once&mdash;if I recall correctly."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment, his gaze resting curiously on the
doctor's troubled face.</p>

<p>"I would suggest, without any intention of being impertinent,
that your present visit follows rather closely upon your former
one."</p>

<p>Von Blon's face clouded over, but I failed to detect any
resentment in his expression.</p>

<p>"Quite true," he rejoined, and shifted his eyes. "The fact is,
sir, that ever since those drugs disappeared from my case I've felt
that something tragic was impending, and that I was in some way to
blame. Whenever I'm in this neighbourhood I can't resist the
impulse to call here and&mdash;and see how things are going."</p>

<p>"Your anxiety is wholly understandable." Vance's tone was
non-committal. Then he added negligently: "I suppose you will have
no objection to Doctor Drumm continuing with Ada's case."</p>

<p>"Continuing?" Von Blon brought himself up straight in his chair.
"I don't understand. You said a moment ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That Ada had been poisoned," finished Vance. "Quite. But d'ye
see, she didn't die."</p>

<p>The other looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" he exclaimed, rising nervously.</p>

<p>"And," added Markham, "we are making no mention whatever of the
episode. You will, therefore, be guided by our decision."</p>

<p>"Of course.&mdash;And is it permitted that I see Ada?"</p>

<p>Markham hesitated, and Vance answered:</p>

<p>"If you care to&mdash;certainly." He turned to Drumm. "Will you
be so good as to accompany Doctor Von Blon?"</p>

<p>Drumm and Von Blon left the room together.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder he's on edge," commented Markham. "It's not
pleasant to learn of people being poisoned with drugs lost through
one's own carelessness."</p>

<p>"He wasn't worrying as much over Ada as he was over Sibella,"
remarked Heath.</p>

<p>"Observin' fella!" smiled Vance. "No, Sergeant; Ada's demise
apparently bothered him far less than Sibella's possible state of
health... Now, I wonder what that means. It's an inveiglin' point.
But&mdash;dash it all&mdash;it everts my pet theory."</p>

<p>"So you have a theory." Markham spoke rebukingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, any number of 'em. And, I might add, they're all pets."
Vance's lightness of tone meant merely that he was not ready to
outline his suspicions; and Markham did not push the matter.</p>

<p>"We won't need any theories," declared Heath, "after we've heard
what Ada's got to tell us. As soon as she talks to us to-morrow
we'll be able to figure out who poisoned her"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," murmured Vance.</p>

<p>Drumm returned alone a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"Doctor Von Blon has stepped into the other girl's room. Said
he'd be down right away."</p>

<p>"What did he have to say about your patient?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Nothing much. She put new energy into her walking the minute
she saw him, though. Smiled at him, too, by Jove! A good sign,
that. She'll come through fast. Lot of resistance in her."</p>

<p>Drumm had hardly ceased speaking when we heard Sibella's door
close and the sound of descending footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>"By the by, doctor," said Vance to Von Blon as the latter
re-entered the drawing-room, "have you seen Oppenheimer yet?"</p>

<p>I saw him at eleven. The fact is, I went direct to him after
leaving here this morning. He has agreed to make an examination
to-morrow at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"And was Mrs. Greene agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I spoke to her about it this morning; and she made no
objection whatever."</p>

<p>A short while later we took our departure. Von Blon accompanied
us to the gate, and we saw him drive off in his car.</p>

<p>"We'll know more by this time to-morrow, I hope," said Markham
on the way down-town. He was unwontedly depressed, and his eyes
were greatly troubled. "You know, Vance, I'm almost appalled by the
thought of what Oppenheimer's report may be."</p>

<p>No report was ever made by Doctor Oppenheimer, however. At some
time between one and two the next morning Mrs. Greene died in
convulsions as a result of strychnine poisoning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI - A DEPLETED HOUSEHOLD</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, December 3rd; forenoon)</b>
</p>

<p>MARKHAM brought us the news of Mrs. Greene's death before ten
o'clock the next morning. The tragedy had not been discovered until
nine, when the nurse brought up her patient's morning tea. Heath
had notified Markham, and Markham had stopped on his way to the
Greene mansion to apprise Vance of the new development. Vance and I
had already breakfasted, and we accompanied him to the house.</p>

<p>"This knocks out our only prop," Markham said despondently, as
we sped up Madison Avenue. "The possibility that the old lady was
guilty was frightful to contemplate; though all along I've been
trying to console myself with the thought that she was insane. Now,
however, I almost wish our suspicions had proved true, for the
possibilities that are left seem even more terrible. We're dealing
now with a cold-blooded calculating rationality."</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're confronted with something far worse than mania. I
can't say, though, that I'm deeply shocked by Mrs. Greene's death.
She was a detestable woman, Markham&mdash;a most detestable woman.
The world will not bemoan her loss."</p>

<p>Vance's comment expressed exactly the sentiment I had felt when
Markham informed us of Mrs. Greene's death. The news had of course
shaken me, but I had no pity for the victim. She had been vicious
and unnatural; she had thrived on hatred, and had made life a hell
for everyone about her. It was better that her existence was
over.</p>

<p>Both Heath and Drumm were waiting for us in the drawing-room.
Excitement and depression were mingled in the Sergeant's
countenance, and the desperation of despair shone in his china-blue
eyes. Drumm revealed only a look of professional disappointment:
his chief concern apparently was that he had been deprived of an
opportunity to display his medical skill.</p>

<p>Heath, after shaking hands absently, briefly explained the
situation.</p>

<p>"O'Brien found the old dame dead at nine this morning, and told
Sproot to wigwag to Doc Drumm. Then she phoned the Bureau, and I
notified you and Doc Doremus. I got here fifteen or twenty minutes
ago, and locked up the room."</p>

<p>"Did you inform Von Blon?" Markham asked.</p>

<p>"I phoned him to call off the examination he'd arranged for ten
o'clock. Said I'd communicate with him later, and hung up before he
had time to ask any questions."</p>

<p>Markham indicated his approval and turned toward Drumm.</p>

<p>"Give us your story, doctor."</p>

<p>Drumm drew himself up, cleared his throat, and assumed an
attitude calculated to be impressive. "I was downstairs in the
Narcoss dining-room eating breakfast when Hennesey came in and told
me the curtains had gone down in the reception-room here. So I
snatched my outfit and came over on the run. The butler took me to
the old lady's room, where the nurse was waiting. But right away I
saw I was too late to be of any good. She was dead&mdash;contorted,
blue and cold&mdash;and <i>rigor mortis</i> had set in. Died of a
big dose of strychnine. Probably didn't suffer
much&mdash;exhaustion and coma came inside of half an hour, I'd
say. Too old, you understand, to throw it off. Old people succumb
to strychnine pretty swiftly..."</p>

<p>"What about her ability to cry out and give the alarm?"</p>

<p>"You can't tell. The spasm may have rendered her mute. Anyway,
no one heard her. Probably passed into unconsciousness after the
first seizure. My experience with such cases has taught
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What time would you say the strychnine was taken?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, you can't tell exactly." Drumm became oracular. "The
convulsions may have been prolonged before death supervened, or
death may have supervened very shortly after the poison was
swallowed."</p>

<p>At what hour, then, would you fix the time of death?"</p>

<p>"There again you can't say definitely. Confusion between
<i>rigor mortis</i> and the phenomenon of cadaveric spasm is a
pitfall into which many doctors fall. There are however, distinct
points of dissimilarity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt." Markham was growing impatient with Drumm's
sophomoric pedantries. "But leaving all explanation to one side,
what time do you think Mrs. Greene died?"</p>

<p>Drumm pondered the point.</p>

<p>"Roughly, let us say, at two this morning."</p>

<p>"And the strychnine might have been taken as early as eleven or
twelve?"</p>

<p>"It's possible."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we'll know about it when Doc Doremus gets here,"
asserted Heath with brutal frankness. He was in vicious mood that
morning.</p>

<p>"Did you find any glass or cup by which the drug might have been
administered, doctor?" Markham hastened to ask, by way of covering
up Heath's remark.</p>

<p>"There was a glass near the bed with what appeared to be
sulphate crystals adhering to the sides of it."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't a fatal dose of strychnine make an ordin'ry drink
noticeably bitter?" Vance had suddenly become alert.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. But there was a bottle of citrocarbonate&mdash;a
well-known antacid&mdash;on the night-table; and if the drug had
been taken with this, the taste would not have been detected.
Citrocarbonate is slightly saline and highly effervescing."</p>

<p>"Could Mrs. Greene have taken the citrocarbonate alone?"</p>

<p>"It's not likely. It has to be carefully mixed with water, and
the operation would be highly awkward for anyone in bed."</p>

<p>"Now, that's most interestin'." Vance listlessly lighted a
cigarette. "We may presume, therefore, that the person who gave
Mrs. Greene the citrocarbonate also administered the strychnine."
He turned to Markham. "I think Miss O'Brien might be able to help
us."</p>

<p>Heath went at once and summoned the nurse.</p>

<p>But her evidence was unilluminating. She had left Mrs. Greene
reading about eleven o'clock, had gone to her own room to make her
toilet for the night, and had returned to Ada's room half an hour
later, where she had slept all night, according to Heath's
instructions. She had risen at eight, dressed, and gone to the
kitchen to fetch Mrs. Greene's tea. As far as she knew, Mrs. Greene
had drunk nothing before retiring&mdash;certainly she had taken no
citrocarbonate up to eleven o'clock. Furthermore, Mrs. Greene never
attempted to take it alone.</p>

<p>"You think, then," asked Vance, "that it was given to her by
someone else?"</p>

<p>"You can bank on it," the nurse assured him bluntly. "If she'd
wanted it, she'd have raised the house before mixing it
herself."</p>

<p>"It's quite obvious," Vance observed to Markham, "that someone
entered her room after eleven o'clock and prepared the
citrocarbonate."</p>

<p>Markham got up and walked anxiously about the room.</p>

<p>"Our immediate problem boils down to finding out who had the
opportunity to do it," he said. "You, Miss O'Brien, may return to
her room..." Then he went to the bell-cord and rang for Sproot.</p>

<p>During a brief interrogation of the butler the following facts
were brought out:</p>

<p>The house had been locked up, and Sproot had retired, at about
half-past ten.</p>

<p>Sibella had gone to her room immediately after dinner and had
remained there.</p>

<p>Hemming and the cook had lingered in the kitchen until shortly
after eleven, at which time Sproot had heard them ascend to their
rooms.</p>

<p>The first intimation Sproot had of Mrs. Greene's death was when
the nurse sent him to draw the reception-room shades at nine that
morning.</p>

<p>Markham dismissed him and sent for the cook. She was, it
appeared, unaware of Mrs. Greene's death and of Ada's poisoning as
well; and what evidence she had to give was of no importance. She
had, she said, been in the kitchen or in her own room practically
all of the preceding day.</p>

<p>Hemming was interviewed next. From the nature of the questions
put to her she became suspicious almost at once. Her piercing eyes
narrowed, and she gave us a look of shrewd triumph.</p>

<p>"You can't hoodwink me," she burst out. "The Lord's been busy
with his besom again. And a good thing, too! 'The Lord preserveth
all them that love him: but all the wicked shall he destroy.'"</p>

<p>"Will,'" corrected Vance. "And seeing that you have been so
tenderly preserved, perhaps we had better inform you that both Miss
Ada and Mrs. Greene have been poisoned."</p>

<p>He was watching the woman closely, but it took no scrutiny to
see her cheeks go pale and her jaw sag. The Lord had evidently been
too precipitously devastating even for this devout disciple; and
her faith was insufficient to counteract her fear.</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave this house," she declared faintly. "I've
seen enough to bear witness for the Lord."</p>

<p>"An excellent idea," nodded Vance. "And the sooner you go the
more time you'll have to give apocryphal testimony."</p>

<p>Hemming rose, a bit dazed, and started for the archway. Then she
quickly turned back and glared at Markham maliciously.</p>

<p>"But let me tell you something before I pass from the den of
iniquity. That Miss Sibella is the worst of the lot, and the Lord
is going to strike her down next&mdash;mark my words! There's no
use to try and save her. She's&mdash;<i>doomed</i>!"</p>

<p>Vance lifted his eyebrows languidly.</p>

<p>"I say, Hemming, what unrighteousness has Miss Sibella been up
to now?"</p>

<p>"The usual thing." The woman spoke with relish. "She's nothing
but a hussy, if you ask me. Her carryings-on with this Doctor Von
Blon have been scandalous. They're together, as thick as thieves,
at all hours." She nodded her head significantly. "He came here
again last night and went to her room. There's no telling what time
he left."</p>

<p>"Fancy that, now. And how do you happen to know about it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I let him in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you did? What time was this?&mdash;And where was
Sproot?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sproot was eating his dinner, and I'd gone to the front
door to take a look at the weather when the doctor walks up.
'Howdy-do, Hemming?' he says with his oily smile. And he brushes
past me, nervouslike, and goes straight to Miss Sibella's
room."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Sibella was indisposed, and sent for him,"
suggested Vance indifferently.</p>

<p>"Huh!" Hemming tossed her head contemptuously, and strode from
the room.</p>

<p>Vance rose at once and rang again for Sproot.</p>

<p>"Did you know Doctor Von Blon was here last night?" he asked
when the butler appeared.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I was quite unaware of the fact."</p>

<p>"That's all, Sproot.&mdash;And now please tell Miss Sibella we'd
like to see her."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>It was fifteen minutes before Sibella put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"I'm beastly lazy these days," she explained, settling herself
in a large chair. "What's the party for this morning?"</p>

<p>Vance offered her a cigarette with an air half quizzical and
half deferential.</p>

<p>"Before we explain our presence," he said, "please be good
enough to tell us what time Doctor Von Blon left here last
night?"</p>

<p>"At a quarter of eleven," she answered, a hostile challenge
coming into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank you. And now I may tell you that both your mother and Ada
have been poisoned."</p>

<p>"Mother and Ada poisoned?" She echoed the words vaguely, as if
they were only half intelligible to her; and for several moments
she sat motionless, staring stonily out of flintlike eyes. Slowly
her gaze became fixed on Markham.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take your advice," she said. "I have a girl chum
in Atlantic City... This place is really becoming too&mdash;too
creepy." She forced a faint smile. "I'm off for the seashore this
afternoon." For the first time the girl's nerve seemed to have
deserted her.</p>

<p>"Your decision is very wise," observed Vance. "Go, by all means;
and arrange to stay until we have settled this affair."</p>

<p>She looked at him in a spirit of indulgent irony.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't stay so long," she said; then added: "I
suppose mother and Ada are both dead."</p>

<p>"Only your mother," Vance told her. "Ada recovered."</p>

<p>"She would!" Every curve of her features expressed a fine
arrogant contempt. "Common clay has great resistance, I've heard.
You know, I'm the only one standing between her and the Greene
millions now."</p>

<p>"Your sister had a very close call," Markham reprimanded her.
"If we had not had a doctor on guard, you might now be the sole
remaining heir to those millions."</p>

<p>"And that would look frightfully suspicious, wouldn't it?" Her
question was disconcertingly frank. "But you may rest assured that
if <i>I</i> had planned this affair, little Ada would not have
recovered."</p>

<p>Before Markham could answer she switched herself out of the
chair.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm going to pack. Enough is enough."</p>

<p>When she had left the room, Heath looked with doubtful
inquisitiveness at Markham.</p>

<p>"What about it, sir? Are you going to let her leave the city?
She's the only one of the Greenes who hasn't been touched."</p>

<p>We knew what he meant; and this spoken suggestion of the thought
that had been passing through all our minds left us silent for a
moment.</p>

<p>"We can't take the chance of forcing her to stay here," Markham
returned finally. "If anything should happen..."</p>

<p>"I get you, sir." Heath was on his feet. "But I'm going to see
that she's tailed&mdash;believe me! I'll get two good men up here
who'll stick to her from the time she goes out that front door till
we know where we stand." He went into the hall, and we heard him
giving orders to Snitkin over the telephone.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Doctor Doremus arrived. He was no longer
jaunty, and his greeting was almost sombre. Accompanied by Drumm
and Heath he went at once to Mrs. Greene's room, while Markham and
Vance and I waited downstairs. When he returned at the end of
fifteen minutes he was markedly subdued, and I noticed he did not
put on his hat at its usual rakish angle.</p>

<p>"What's the report?" Markham asked him.</p>

<p>"Same as Drumm's. The old girl passed out, I'd say, between one
and two."</p>

<p>"And the strychnine was taken when?"</p>

<p>"Midnight, or thereabouts. But that's only a guess. Anyway, she
got it along with the citrocarbonate. I tasted it on the glass."*
(*It will be remembered that in the famous Molineux poisoning case
the cyanide of mercury was administered by way of a similar
drug&mdash;to wit: Bromo- Seltzer.)</p>

<p>"By the by, doctor," said Vance, "when you do the autopsy can
you let us have a report on the state of atrophy of the leg
muscles?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing." Doremus was somewhat surprised by the request.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Markham addressed himself to Drumm.</p>

<p>"We'd like to talk to Ada now. How is she this morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fine!" Drumm spoke with pride. "I saw her right after I'd
looked at the old lady. She's weak and a bit dried up with all the
atropine I gave her, but otherwise practically normal."</p>

<p>"And she has not been told of her mother's death?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"She will have to know," interposed Vance; "and there's no point
in keeping the fact from her any longer. It's just as well that the
shock should come when we're all present."</p>

<p>Ada was sitting by the window when we came in, her elbows on the
sill, chin in hands, gazing out into the snow-covered yard. She was
startled by our entry, and the pupils of her eyes dilated, as if
with sudden fright. It was plain that the experiences she had been
through had created in her a state of nervous fear.</p>

<p>After a brief exchange of amenities, during which both Vance and
Markham strove to allay her nervousness, Markham broached the
subject of the bouillon.</p>

<p>"We'd give a great deal," he said, "not to have to recall so
painful an episode, but much depends on what you can tell us
regarding yesterday morning.&mdash;You were in the drawing-room,
weren't you, when the nurse called down to you?"</p>

<p>The girl's lips and tongue were dry, and she spoke with some
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mother had asked me to bring her a copy of a magazine, and
I had just gone downstairs to look for it when the nurse
called."</p>

<p>"You saw the nurse when you came upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was just going toward the servants' stairway."</p>

<p>"There was no one in your room when you entered?" She shook her
head. "Who could have been there?"</p>

<p>"That's what we're trying to find out, Miss Greene," replied
Markham gravely. "Someone certainly put the drug in your
bouillon."</p>

<p>She shuddered, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Did anyone come in while you were there?" Markham
continued.</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>Heath impatiently projected himself into the interrogation.</p>

<p>"And say; did you drink your soup right away?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not right away. I felt a little chilly, and I went
across the hall to Julia's room to get an old Spanish shawl to put
round me."</p>

<p>Heath made a disgusted face, and sighed noisily.</p>

<p>"Every time we get going on this case," he complained,
"something comes along and sinks us.&mdash;If Miss Ada left the
soup in here, Mr. Markham, while she went to get a shawl, then
almost anybody coulda sneaked in and poisoned the stuff."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," Ada apologized, almost as though she had taken
Heath's words as a criticism of her actions.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault, Ada," Vance assured her. "The Sergeant is
unduly depressed. But tell me this: when you went into the hall did
you see Miss Sibella's dog anywhere around?"</p>

<p>She shook her head wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Why, no. What has Sibella's dog to do with it?"</p>

<p>"He probably saved your life." And Vance explained to her how
Sproot had happened to find her.</p>

<p>She gave a half-breathless murmur of amazement and incredulity,
and fell into abstracted reverie.</p>

<p>"When you returned from your sister's room, did you drink your
bouillon at once?" Vance asked her next.</p>

<p>With difficulty she brought her mind back to the question.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And didn't you notice a peculiar taste?"</p>

<p>Not particularly. Mother always likes a lot of salt in her
bouillon."</p>

<p>"And then what happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing happened. Only, I began to feel funny. The back of my
neck tightened up, and I got very warm and drowsy. My skin tingled
all over, and my arms and legs seemed to get numb. I was terribly
sleepy, and I lay back on the bed. That's all I remember."</p>

<p>"Another washout," grumbled Heath.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and Vance drew his chair nearer.</p>

<p>"Now, Ada," he said, "you must brace yourself for more bad
news... Your mother died during the night."</p>

<p>The girl sat motionless for a moment, and then turned to him
eyes of a despairing clearness.</p>

<p>"Died?" she repeated. "How did she die?"</p>

<p>"She was poisoned&mdash;she took an overdose of strychnine."</p>

<p>"You mean... she committed suicide?"</p>

<p>This query startled us all. It expressed a possibility that had
not occurred to us. After a momentary hesitation, however, Vance
slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I hardly think so. I'm afraid the person who poisoned you
also poisoned your mother."</p>

<p>Vance's reply seemed to stun her. Her face grew pale, and her
eyes were set in a glassy stare of terror. Then presently she
sighed deeply, as if from a kind of mental depletion.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's going to happen next? ...I'm&mdash;afraid!"</p>

<p>"Nothing more is going to happen," said Vance with emphasis.
"Nothing more can happen. You are going to be guarded every minute.
And Sibella is going this afternoon to Atlantic City for a long
visit."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go away," she breathed pathetically.</p>

<p>"There will be no need of that," put in Markham. "You'll be
safer in New York. We are going to keep the nurse here to look
after you, and also put a man in the house day and night until
everything is straightened out. Hemming is leaving to-day, but
Sproot and the cook will take care of you." He rose and patted her
shoulder comfortingly. "There's no possible way any one can harm
you now."</p>

<p>As we descended into the lower hall Sproot was just admitting
Doctor Von Blon.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed, hastening toward us. "Sibella just
phoned me about Mrs. Greene." He looked truculently at Markham, his
suavity for the moment forgotten. "Why wasn't I informed, sir?"</p>

<p>"I saw no necessity of bothering you, doctor," Markham returned
equably. "Mrs. Greene had been dead several hours when she was
found. And we had our own doctor at hand."</p>

<p>A quick flame leaped in Von Blon's eyes.</p>

<p>"And am I to be forcibly kept from seeing Sibella?" he asked
coldly. "She tells me she is leaving the city to-day, and has asked
me to assist with her arrangements."</p>

<p>Markham stepped aside.</p>

<p>"You are free, doctor, to do whatever you desire," he said, a
perceptible chill in his voice.</p>

<p>Von Blon bowed stiffly, and went up the stairs.</p>

<p>"He's sore," grinned Heath.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," Vance corrected. "He's worried&mdash;oh, deuced
worried."</p>

<p>Shortly after noon that day Hemming departed forever from the
Greene mansion; and Sibella took the three-fifteen o'clock train
for Atlantic City. Of the original household, only Ada and Sproot
and Mrs. Mannheim were left. However, Heath gave orders for Miss
O'Brien to remain on duty indefinitely and keep an eye on
everything that happened; and, in addition to this protection, a
detective was stationed in the house to augment the nurse's
watch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII - THE SHADOWY FIGURE</h2>

<p><b>(Friday, December 3rd; 6 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>AT six o'clock that evening Markham called another informal
conference at the Stuyvesant Club. Not only were Inspector Moran
and Heath present, but Chief Inspector O'Brien dropped in on his
way home from the office.* (*Chief Inspector O'Brien, who was in
command of the entire Police Department, was, I learned later, an
uncle of the Miss O'Brien who was acting officially as nurse at the
Greene mansion.)</p>

<p>The afternoon papers had been merciless in their criticism of
the police for its unsuccessful handling of the investigation.
Markham, after consulting with Heath and Doremus, had explained the
death of Mrs. Greene to the reporters as "the result of an overdose
of strychnine&mdash;a stimulant she had been taking regularly under
her physician's orders." Swacker had typed copies of the item so
there would be no mistake as to its exact wording; and the
announcement ended by saying: "There is no evidence to show that
the drug was not self-administered as the result of error." But
although the reporters composed their news stories in strict accord
with Markham's report, they interpolated subtle intimations of
deliberate murder, so that the reader was left with little doubt as
to the true state of affairs. The unsuccessful attempt to poison
Ada had been kept a strict official secret. But this suppressed
item had not been needed to inflame the public's morbid imagination
to an almost unprecedented degree.</p>

<p>Both Markham and Heath had begun to show the strain of their
futile efforts to solve the affair; and one glance at Inspector
Moran, as he sank heavily into a chair beside the District
Attorney, was enough to make one realize that a corroding worry had
undermined his habitual equanimity. Even Vance revealed signs of
tensity and uneasiness; but with him it was an eager alertness,
rather than worry, that marked any deviation from normality in his
attitude.</p>

<p>As soon as we were assembled that evening Heath briefly
epitomized the case. He went over the various lines of
investigation, and enumerated the precautions that had been taken.
When he had finished, and before anyone could make a comment, he
turned to Chief Inspector O'Brien and said:</p>

<p>"There's plenty of things, sir, we might've done in any ordinary
case. We could've searched the house for the gun and the poison
like the narcotic squad goes through a single room or small
apartment&mdash;punching the mattresses, tearing up the carpets,
and sounding the woodwork&mdash;but in the Greene house it would've
taken a coupla months. And even if we'd found the stuff, what good
would it have done us? The guy that's tearing things wide open in
that dump isn't going to stop just because we take his dinky
thirty-two away from him, or grab his poison. After Chester or Rex
was shot we could've arrested all the rest of the family and put
'em through a third degree. But there's too much noise in the
papers now every time we give anybody the works; and it ain't
exactly healthy for us to grill a family like the Greenes. They've
got too much money and pull; they'd have had a whole battalion of
high-class lawyers smearing us with suits and injunctions and God
knows what. And if we'd just held 'em as material witnesses, they'd
have got out in forty-eight hours on <i>habeas-corpus</i> actions.
Then, again, we might've planted a bunch of huskies in the house.
But we couldn't keep a garrison there indefinitely, and the minute
they'd have been called off, the dirty work would've begun. Believe
me, Inspector, we've been up against it good and plenty."</p>

<p>O'Brien grunted and tugged at his white cropped moustache.</p>

<p>"What the Sergeant says is perfectly true," Moran remarked.
"Most of the ordinary methods of action and investigation have been
denied us. We're obviously dealing with an inside family
affair."</p>

<p>"Moreover," added Vance, "we're dealing with an extr'ordin'rily
clever plot&mdash;something that has been thought out and planned
down to the minutest detail, and elaborately covered up at every
point. Everything has been staked-even life itself&mdash;on the
outcome. Only a supreme hatred and an exalted hope could have
inspired the crimes. And against such attributes, d'ye see, the
ordin'ry means of prevention are utterly useless."</p>

<p>"A family affair!" repeated O'Brien heavily, who apparently was
still pondering over Inspector Moran's statement. "It don't look to
me as though there's much of the family left. I'd say, on the
evidence, that some outsider was trying to wipe the family out." He
gave Heath a glowering look. "What have you done about the
servants? You're not scared to monkey with them, are you? You could
have arrested one of 'em a long time ago and stopped the yapping of
the newspapers for a time, anyway."</p>

<p>Markham came immediately to Heath's defence.</p>

<p>"I'm wholly responsible for any seeming negligence on the
Sergeant's part in that regard," he said with a noticeable accent
of cold reproach. "As long as I have anything to say about this
case no arrests are going to be made for the mere purpose of
quieting unpleasant criticism." Then his manner relaxed slightly.
"There isn't the remotest indication of guilt in connection with
any of the servants. The maid Hemming is a harmless fanatic, and is
quite incapable mentally of having planned the murders. I permitted
her to leave the Greenes' to-day..."</p>

<p>"We know where to find her, Inspector," Heath hastened to add by
way of forestalling the other's inevitable question.</p>

<p>"As to the cook," Markham went on; "she, too, is wholly outside
of any serious consideration. She's temperamentally unfitted to be
cast in the r&ocirc;le of murderer."</p>

<p>"And what about the butler?" asked O'Brien acrimoniously.</p>

<p>"He's been with the family thirty years, and was even remembered
liberally in Tobias Greene's will. He's a bit queer, but I think if
he had had any reason for destroying the Greenes he wouldn't have
awaited till old age came on him." Markham looked troubled for a
moment. "I must admit, however, that there's an atmosphere of
mysterious reserve about the old fellow. He always gives me the
impression of knowing far more than he admits."</p>

<p>"What you say, Markham, is true enough," remarked Vance. "But
Sproot certainly doesn't fit this particular saturnalia of crime.
He reasons too carefully; there's an immense cautiousness about the
man, and his mental outlook is highly conservative. He might stab
an enemy if there was no remote chance of detection. But he lacks
the courage and the imaginative resiliency that have made possible
this present gory debauch. He's too old&mdash;much too old... By
Jove!"</p>

<p>Vance leaned over and tapped the table with an incisive
gesture.</p>

<p>"That's the thing that's been evading me! Vitality! That's what
is the bottom of this business&mdash;a tremendous, elastic,
self-confident vitality: a supreme ruthlessness mingled with
audacity and impudence&mdash;an intrepid and reckless
egoism&mdash;an undaunted belief in one's own ability. And they're
not the components of age. There's youth in all this&mdash;youth
with its ambition and venturesomeness&mdash;that doesn't count the
cost, that takes no thought of risk... No. Sproot could never
qualify."</p>

<p>Moran shifted his chair uneasily, and turned to Heath. "Whom did
you send to Atlantic City to watch Sibella?"</p>

<p>"Guilfoyle and Mallory&mdash;the two best men we've got." The
Sergeant smiled with a kind of cruel satisfaction. "She won't get
away. And she won't pull anything, either." * (*I recalled that
Guilfoyle and Mallory were the two men who had been set to watch
Tony Skeel in the Canary murder case.)</p>

<p>"And have you extended your attention to Doctor Von Blon, by any
chance?" negligently asked Vance. Again Heath's canny smile
appeared.</p>

<p>"He's been tailed ever since Rex was shot."</p>

<p>Vance regarded him admiringly.</p>

<p>"I'm becoming positively fond of you, Sergeant," he said; and
beneath his chaffing note was the ring of sincerity.</p>

<p>O'Brien leaned ponderously over the table and brushing the ashes
from his cigar, fixed a sullen look on the District Attorney.</p>

<p>"What was this story you gave out to the papers, Mr. Markham?
You seemed to want to imply that the old woman took the strychnine
herself. Was that hogwash, or was there something in it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there was nothing in it, Inspector." Markham spoke
with a sense of genuine regret. "Such a theory doesn't square with
the poisoning of Ada&mdash;or with any of the rest of it, for that
matter."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," retorted O'Brien. "Moran here has told me
that you fellows had an idea the old woman was faking her
paralysis." He rearranged his arms on the table and pointed a
short, thick finger at Markham. "Supposing she shot three of the
children, using up all the cartridges in the revolver, and then
stole the two doses of poison&mdash;one for each of the two girls
left; and then supposing she gave the morphine to the younger one,
and had only one dose left..." He paused and squinted
significantly.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," said Markham. "Your theory is that she
didn't count on our having a doctor handy to save Ada's life, and
that, having failed to put Ada out of the way, she figured the game
was up and took the strychnine."</p>

<p>"That's it!" O'Brien struck the table with his fist. "And it
makes sense. Furthermore, it means we've cleared up the
case&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it unquestionably makes sense." It was Vance's quiet,
drawling voice that answered. "But forgive me if I suggest that it
fits the facts much too tidily. It's a perfect theory, don't y'
know; it leaps to the brain, almost as though someone had planned
it for our benefit. I rather fancy that we're intended to adopt
that very logical and sensible point of view. But really now,
Inspector, Mrs. Greene was not the suicidal type, however murderous
she may have been."</p>

<p>While Vance was speaking, Heath had left the room. A few minutes
later he returned and interrupted O'Brien in a long, ill-natured
defence of his suicide theory.</p>

<p>"We haven't got to argue any more along that line," he
announced. "I've just had Doc Doremus on the phone. He's finished
the autopsy; and he says that the old lady's leg muscles had wasted
away&mdash;gone plumb flabby&mdash;and that there wasn't a chance
in the world of her moving her legs, let alone walking on 'em."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Moran was the first to recover from the amazement
this news had caused us. "Who was it, then, that Ada saw in the
hall?"</p>

<p>"That's just it!" Vance spoke hurriedly, trying to stem his
rising sense of excitation. "If only we knew! That's the answer to
the whole problem. It may not have been the murderer; but the
person who sat in that library night after night and read strange
books by candle light is the key to everything..."</p>

<p>"But Ada was so positive in her identification," objected
Markham, in a bewildered tone.</p>

<p>"She's hardly to be blamed in the circumstances," Vance
returned. "The child had been through a frightful experience and
was scarcely normal. And it is not at all unlikely that she, too,
suspected her mother. If she did, what would have been more natural
than for her to imagine that this shadowy figure she saw in the
hall long after midnight was the actual object of her dread? It is
not unusual for a person under the stress of fright to distort an
object by the projection of a dominating mental image."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Heath, "that she saw somebody else, and
imagined it was her mother because she was thinking so hard of the
old woman?"</p>

<p>"It's by no means improbable."</p>

<p>"Still, there was that detail of the Oriental shawl," objected
Markham. "Ada might easily have mistaken the person's features, but
her insistence on having seen that particular shawl was fairly
definite."</p>

<p>Vance gave a perplexed nod.</p>

<p>"The point is well taken. And it may prove the Ariadne's clue
that will lead us out of this Cretan labyrinth. We must find out
more about that shawl."</p>

<p>Heath had taken out his note-book and was turning the pages with
scowling concentration.</p>

<p>"And don't forget, Mr. Vance," he said, without looking up,
"about that diagram Ada found in the rear of the hall near the
library door. Maybe this person in the shawl was the one who'd
dropped it, and was going to the library to look for it, but got
scared off when she saw Ada."</p>

<p>"But whoever shot Rex," said Markham, "evidently stole the paper
from him, and therefore wouldn't be worrying about it."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," Heath admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Such speculation is futile," commented Vance. "This affair is
too complicated to be untangled by the unravelling of details. We
must determine, if possible, who it was that Ada saw that night.
Then we'll have opened a main artery of inquiry."</p>

<p>"How are we going to find that out," demanded O'Brien, "when Ada
was the only person who saw this woman in Mrs. Greene's shawl?"</p>

<p>"Your question contains the answer, Inspector. We must see Ada
again and try and counteract the suggestion of her own fears. When
we explain that it couldn't have been her mother, she may recall
some other point that will put us on the right track."</p>

<p>And this was the course taken. When the conference ended,
O'Brien departed, and the rest of us dined at the club. At
half-past eight we were on our way to the Greene mansion.</p>

<p>We found Ada and the cook alone in the drawing-room. The girl
sat before the fire, a copy of Grimms' "Fairy Tales" turned face
down on her knees; and Mrs. Mannheim, busy with a lapful of
mending, occupied a straight chair near the door. It was a curious
sight, in view of the formal correctness of the house, and it
brought forcibly to my mind how fear and adversity inevitably level
all social standards.</p>

<p>When we entered the room Mrs. Mannheim rose, and gathering up
her mending, started to go. But Vance indicated that she was to
remain, and without a word she resumed her seat.</p>

<p>"We're here to annoy you again, Ada," said Vance, assuming the
r&ocirc;le of interrogator. "But you're about the only person we
can come to for help." His smile put the girl at ease, and he
continued gently: "We want to talk to you about what you told us
the other afternoon..."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide, and she waited in a kind of awed
silence.</p>

<p>"You told us you thought you had seen your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did see her&mdash;I did!"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head. "No; it was not your mother. She was
unable to walk, Ada. She was truly and helplessly paralyzed. It was
impossible for her even to make the slightest movement with either
leg."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I don't understand." There was more than bewilderment
in her voice: there was terror and alarm as one might experience at
the thought of supernatural malignancy. "I heard Doctor Von Blon
tell mother he was bringing a specialist to see her this morning.
But she died last night&mdash;so how could you know? Oh, you must
be mistaken. I saw her&mdash;I <i>know</i> I saw her."</p>

<p>She seemed to be battling desperately for the preservation of
her sanity. But Vance again shook his head.</p>

<p>"Doctor Oppenheimer did not examine your mother," he said. "But
Doctor Doremus did&mdash;to-day. And he found that she had been
unable to move for many years."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The exclamation was only breathed. The girl seemed
incapable of speech.</p>

<p>"And what we've come for," continued Vance, "is to ask you to
recall that night, and see if you cannot remember
something&mdash;some little thing&mdash;that will help us. You saw
this person only by the flickering light of a match. You might
easily have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"But how could I? I was so close to her."</p>

<p>"Before you woke up that night and felt hungry, had you been
dreaming of your mother?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and shuddered slightly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I've dreamed of mother
constantly&mdash;awful, scarey dreams&mdash;ever since that first
night when somebody came into my room..."</p>

<p>"That may account for the mistake you made." Vance paused a
moment and then asked: "Do you distinctly remember seeing your
mother's Oriental shawl on the person in the hall that night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, after a slight hesitation. "It was the
first thing I noticed. Then I saw her face..."</p>

<p>A trivial but startling thing happened at this moment. We had
our back to Mrs. Mannheim and, for the time being, had forgotten
her presence in the room. Suddenly what sounded like a dry sob
broke from her, and the sewing-basket on her knees fell to the
floor. Instinctively we turned. The woman was staring at us
glassily.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make who she saw?" she asked in a dead,
monotonous voice. "She maybe saw me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Gertrude," Ada said quickly. "It wasn't you."</p>

<p>Vance was watching the woman with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>Do you ever wear Mrs. Greene's shawl, Frau Mannheim?"</p>

<p>"Of course she doesn't," Ada cut in.</p>

<p>"And did you ever steal into the library and read after the
household is asleep?" pursued Vance.</p>

<p>The woman picked up her sewing morosely, and again lapsed into
sullen silence. Vance studied her a moment and then turned back to
Ada.</p>

<p>"Do you know of anyone who might have been wearing your mother's
shawl that night?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know," the girl stammered, her lips
trembling.</p>

<p>"Come; that won't do." Vance spoke with some asperity. "This
isn't the time to shield anyone. Who was in the habit of using the
shawl?"</p>

<p>"No one was in the habit..." She stopped and gave Vance a
pleading look; but he was obdurate.</p>

<p>"Who, then, besides your mother ever wore it?"</p>

<p>"But I would have known if it had been Sibella I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sibella? She sometimes borrowed the shawl?"</p>

<p>Ada nodded reluctantly. "Once in a great while. She&mdash;she
admired the shawl... Oh, why do you make me tell you this!"</p>

<p>"And you have never seen anyone else with it on?"</p>

<p>"No; no one ever wore it except mother and Sibella."</p>

<p>Vance attempted to banish her obvious distress with a whimsical
reassuring smile.</p>

<p>"Just see how foolish all your fears have been," he said
lightly. "You probably saw your sister in the hall that night, and,
because you'd been having bad dreams about your mother, you thought
it was she. As a result, you became frightened, and locked yourself
up and worried. It was rather silly, what?"</p>

<p>A little later we took our leave.</p>

<p>"It has always been my contention," remarked Inspector Moran, as
we rode down-town, "that any identification under strain or
excitement is worthless. And here we have a glaring instance of
it."</p>

<p>"I'd like a nice quiet little chat with Sibella," mumbled Heath,
busy with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't comfort you, Sergeant," Vance told him. "At the end
of your <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> you'd know only what
the young lady wanted you to know."</p>

<p>"Where do we stand now?" asked Markham, after a silence.</p>

<p>"Exactly where we stood before," answered Vance dejectedly, "in
the midst of an impenetrable fog.&mdash;And I'm not in the least
convinced," he added, "that it was Sibella whom Ada saw in the
hall."</p>

<p>Markham looked amazed.</p>

<p>"Then who, in Heaven's name, was it?"</p>

<p>Vance sighed gloomily. "Give me the answer to that one question,
and I'll complete the saga."</p>

<p>That night Vance sat up until nearly two o'clock writing at his
desk in the library.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII - THE MISSING FACT</h2>

<p><b>(Saturday, December 4th; 1 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>SATURDAY was the District Attorney's "half-day" at the office,
and Markham had invited Vance and me to lunch at the Bankers Club.
But when we reached the Criminal Courts Building he was swamped
with an accumulation of work, and we had a tray-service meal in his
private conference room. Before leaving the house that noon Vance
had put several sheets of closely-written paper in his pocket, and
I surmised&mdash;correctly, as it turned out&mdash;that they were
what he had been working on the night before.</p>

<p>When lunch was over Vance lay back in his chair languidly and
lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Markham, old dear," he said, "I accepted your invitation to-day
for the sole purpose of discussing art. I trust you are in a
receptive mood."</p>

<p>Markham looked at him with frank annoyance.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Vance, I'm too confounded busy to be bothered with
your irrelevancies. If you feel artistically inclined, take Van
here to the Metropolitan Museum. But leave me alone."</p>

<p>Vance sighed, and wagged his head reproachfully.</p>

<p>"There speaks the voice of America! 'Run along and play with
your aesthetic toys if such silly things amuse you; but let me
attend to my serious affairs.' It's very sad. In the present
instance, however, I refuse to run along; and most certainly I
shall not browse about that mausoleum of Europe's rejected corpses,
known as the Metropolitan Museum. I say, it's a wonder you didn't
suggest that I make the rounds of our municipal statuary."</p>

<p>"I'd have suggested the Aquarium&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. Anything to get rid of me." Vance adopted an injured
tone. "And yet, don't y' know, I'm going to sit right here and
deliver an edifying lecture on aesthetic composition."</p>

<p>"Then don't talk too loud," said Markham, rising; "for I'll be
in the next room working."</p>

<p>"But my lecture has to do with the Greene case. And really you
shouldn't miss it."</p>

<p>Markham paused and turned.</p>

<p>"Merely one of your wordy prologues, eh?" He sat down again.
"Well, if you have any helpful suggestions to make, I'll
listen."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," he began, assuming a lazy, unemotional air,
"there's a fundamental difference between a good painting and a
photograph. I'll admit many painters appear unaware of this fact;
and when colour photography is perfected&mdash;my word! What a
horde of academicians will be thrown out of employment! But none
the less there's a vast chasm between the two; and it's this
technical distinction that's to be the burden of my lay. How, for
instance, does Michelangelo's 'Moses' differ from a camera study of
a patriarchal old man with whiskers and a stone tablet? Wherein lie
the points of divergence between Rubens's 'Landscape with
Ch&acirc;teau de Stein' and a tourist's snapshot of a Rhine castle?
Why is a C&eacute;zanne still life an improvement on a photograph
of a dish of apples? Why have the Renaissance paintings of Madonnas
endured for hundreds of years whereas a mere photograph of a mother
and child passes into artistic oblivion at the very click of the
lens shutter? ..."</p>

<p>He held up a silencing hand as Markham was about to speak.</p>

<p>"I'm not being futile. Bear with me a moment. The difference
between a good painting and a photograph is this: the one is
arranged, composed, organized; the other is merely the haphazard
impression of a scene, or a segment of realism, just as it exists
in nature. In short, the one has form; the other is chaotic. When a
true artist paints a picture, d' ye see, he arranges all the masses
and lines to accord with his preconceived idea of
composition&mdash;that is, he bends everything in the picture to a
basic design; and he also eliminates any objects or details that go
contr'ry to, or detract from, that design. Thus he achieves a
homogeneity of form, so to speak. Every object in the picture is
put there for a definite purpose, and is set in a certain position
to accord with the underlying structural pattern. There are no
irrelevancies, no unrelated details, no detached objects, no
arbitr'ry arrangement of values. All the forms and lines are
interdependent; every object&mdash;indeed, every brush
stroke&mdash;takes its exact place in the pattern and fulfils a
given function. The picture, in fine, is a unity."</p>

<p>"Very instructive," commented Markham, glancing ostentatiously
at his watch. "And the Greene case?"</p>

<p>"Now, a photograph, on the other hand," pursued Vance, ignoring
the interruption, "is devoid of design or even of arrangement in
the aesthetic sense. To be sure, a photographer may pose and drape
a figure&mdash;he may even saw off the limb of a tree that he
intends to record on his negative; but it's quite impossible for
him to compose the subject-matter of his picture to accord with a
preconceived design, the way a painter does. In a photograph there
are always details that have no meaning, variations of light and
shade that are harmonically false, textures that create false
notes, lines that are discords, masses that are out of place. The
camera, d' ye see, is deucedly forthright&mdash;it records whatever
is before it, irrespective of art values. The inevitable result is
that a photograph lacks organization and unity; its composition is,
at best, primitive and obvious. And it is full of irrelevant
factors&mdash;of objects which have neither meaning nor purpose.
There is no uniformity of conception in it. It is haphazard,
heterogeneous, aimless, and amorphous&mdash;just as is nature."</p>

<p>"You needn't belabour the point." Markham spoke impatiently. "I
have a rudimentary intelligence.&mdash;Where is this elaborate
truism leading you?"</p>

<p>Vance gave him an engaging smile.</p>

<p>"To East 53rd Street. But before we reach our destination permit
me another brief amplification.&mdash;Quite often a painting of
intricate and subtle design does not at once reveal its composition
to the spectator. In fact, only the designs of the simpler and more
obvious paintings are immediately grasped. Generally the spectator
has to study a painting carefully&mdash;trace its rhythms, compare
its forms, weigh its details, and fit together all its
salients&mdash;before its underlying design becomes apparent. Many
well-organized and perfectly balanced paintings&mdash;such as
Renoir's figure-pieces, Matisse's interiors, Cezanne's
water-colours, Picasso's still lifes, and Leonardo's anatomical
drawings&mdash;may at first appear meaningless from the standpoint
of composition; their forms may seem to lack unity and cohesion;
their masses and linear values may give the impression of having
been arbitrarily put down. And it is only after the spectator has
related all their integers and traced all their contrapuntal
activities that they take on significance and reveal their
creator's motivating conception&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Markham. "Paintings and photographs
differ; the objects in a painting possess design; the objects in a
photograph are without design; one must often study a painting in
order to determine the design.&mdash;That, I believe, covers the
ground you have been wandering over desultorily for the past
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"I was merely trying to imitate the vast deluge of repetitive
verbiage found in legal documents," explained Vance. "I hope
thereby to convey my meaning to your lawyer's mind."</p>

<p>"You have succeeded with a vengeance," snapped Markham. "What
follows?"</p>

<p>Vance became serious again.</p>

<p>"Markham, we've been looking at the various occurrences in the
Greene case as though they were the unrelated objects of a
photograph. We've inspected each fact as it came up; but we have
failed to analyze sufficiently its connection with all the other
known facts. We've regarded this whole affair as though it were a
series, or collection, of isolated integers. And we've missed the
significance of everything because we haven't yet determined the
shape of the basic pattern of which each of these incidents is but
a part.&mdash;Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!"</p>

<p>"Very well.&mdash;Now, it goes without saying that there is a
design at the bottom of this whole amazin' business. Nothing has
happened haphazardly. There has been premeditation behind each
act&mdash;a subtly and carefully concocted composition, as it were.
And everything has emanated from that central shape. Everything has
been fashioned by a fundamental structural idea. Therefore, nothing
important that has occurred since the first double shooting has
been unrelated to the predetermined pattern of the crime. All the
aspects and events of the case, taken together, form a
unity&mdash;a co-ordinated, interactive whole. In short, the Greene
case is a painting, not a photograph. And when we have studied it
in that light&mdash;when we have determined the inter-relationship
of all the external factors, and have traced the visual forms to
their generating lines-then, Markham, we will know the composition
of the picture; we will see the design on which the perverted
painter has erected his document'ry material. And once we have
discovered the underlying shape of this hideous picture's pattern,
we'll know its creator."</p>

<p>"I see your point," said Markham slowly. "But how does it help
us? We know all the external facts; and they certainly don't fit
into any intelligible conception of a unified whole."</p>

<p>"Not yet, perhaps," agreed Vance. "But that's because we haven't
gone about it systematically. We've done too much investigating and
too little thinking. We've been side-tracked by what the modern
painters call documentation&mdash;that is, by the objective appeal
of the picture's recognizable parts. We haven't sought for the
abstract content. We've overlooked the 'significant form'&mdash;a
loose phrase; but blame Clive Bell for it."* (*Vance was here
referring to the chapter called "The Aesthetic Hypothesis" in Clive
Bell's "Art." But, despite the somewhat slighting character of his
remark, Vance was an admirer of Bell's criticisms, and had spoken
to me with considerable enthusiasm of his "Since Cezanne.")</p>

<p>"And how would you suggest that we set about determining the
compositional design of this bloody canvas? We might dub the
picture, by the way, 'Nepotism Gone Wrong.'" By this facetious
remark, he was, I knew, attempting to counteract the serious
impression the other's disquisition had made on him; for, though he
realized Vance would not have drawn his voluminous parallel without
a definite hope of applying it successfully to the problem in hand,
he was chary of indulging any expectations lest they result in
further disappointments.</p>

<p>In answer to Markham's question, Vance drew out the sheaf of
papers he had brought with him.</p>

<p>"Last night," he explained, "I set down briefly and
chronologically all the outstanding facts of the Greene
case&mdash;that is, I noted each important external factor of the
ghastly picture we've been contemplating for the past few weeks.
The principal forms are all here, though I may have left out many
details. But I think I have tabulated a sufficient number of items
to serve as a working basis."</p>

<p>He held out the papers to Markham.</p>

<p>"The truth lies somewhere in that list. If we could put the
facts together&mdash;relate them to one another with their correct
values&mdash;we'd know who was at the bottom of this orgy of crime;
for, once we determined the pattern, each of the items would take
on a vital significance, and we could read clearly the message they
had to tell us."</p>

<p>Markham took the summary and, moving his chair nearer to the
light, read through it without a word.</p>

<p>I preserved the original copy of the document; and, of all the
records I possess, it was the most important and far-reaching in
its effects. Indeed, it was the instrument by means of which the
Greene case was solved. Had it not been for this recapitulation,
prepared by Vance and later analyzed by him, the famous mass murder
at the Greene mansion would doubtless have been relegated to the
category of unsolved crimes.</p>

<p>Herewith is a verbatim reproduction of it:</p>

<p>GENERAL FACTS</p>

<p>1. An atmosphere of mutual hatred pervades the Greene
mansion.</p>

<p>2. Mrs. Greene is a nagging, complaining paralytic, making life
miserable for the whole household.</p>

<p>3. There are five children&mdash;two daughters, two sons, and
one adopted daughter&mdash;who have nothing in common, and live in
a state of constant antagonism and bitterness toward one
another.</p>

<p>4. Though Mrs. Mannheim, the cook, was acquainted with Tobias
Greene years ago and was remembered in his will, she refuses to
reveal any of the facts in her past.</p>

<p>5. The will of Tobias Greene stipulated that the family must
live in the Greene mansion for twenty-five years on pain of
disinheritance, with the one exception that, if Ada should marry,
she could establish a residence elsewhere, as she was not of the
Greene blood. By the will Mrs. Greene has the handling and
disposition of the money.</p>

<p>6. Mrs. Greene's will makes the five children equal
beneficiaries. In event of death of any of them the survivors share
alike; and if all should die the estate goes to their families.</p>

<p>7. The sleeping-rooms of the Greenes are arranged thus: Julia's
and Rex's face each other at the front of the house; Chester's and
Ada's face each other in the centre of the house; and Sibella's and
Mrs. Greene's face each other at the rear. No two rooms
intercommunicate, with the exception of Ada's and Mrs. Greene's;
and these two rooms also give on to the same balcony.</p>

<p>8. The library of Tobias Greene, which Mrs. Greene believes she
has kept locked for twelve years, contains a remarkably complete
collection of books on criminology and allied subjects.</p>

<p>9. Tobias Greene's past was somewhat mysterious, and there were
many rumours concerning shady transactions carried on by him in
foreign lands.</p>

<p>FIRST CRIME</p>

<p>10. Julia is killed by a contact shot, fired from the front, at
11.30 p.m.</p>

<p>11. Ada is shot from behind, also by a contact shot. She
recovers.</p>

<p>12. Julia is found in bed, with a look of horror and amazement
on her face.</p>

<p>13. Ada is found on the floor before the dressing-table.</p>

<p>14. The lights have been turned on in both rooms.</p>

<p>15. Over three minutes elapse between the two shots.</p>

<p>16. Von Blon, summoned immediately, arrives within half an
hour.</p>

<p>17. A set of footprints, other than Von Blon's, leaving and
approaching the house, is found; but the character of the snow
renders them indecipherable.</p>

<p>18. The tracks have been made during the half-hour preceding the
crime.</p>

<p>19. Both shootings are done with a .32 revolver.</p>

<p>20. Chester reports that an old .32 revolver of his is
missing.</p>

<p>21. Chester is not satisfied with the police theory of a
burglar, and insists that the District Attorney's office
investigate the case.</p>

<p>22. Mrs. Greene is aroused by the shot fired in Ada's room, and
hears Ada fall. But she hears no footsteps or sound of a door
closing.</p>

<p>23. Sproot is half-way down the servants' stairs when the second
shot is fired, yet he encounters no one in the hall. Nor does he
hear any noise.</p>

<p>24. Rex, in the next room to Ada's, says he heard no shot.</p>

<p>25. Rex intimates that Chester knows more about the tragedy than
he admits.</p>

<p>26. There is some secret between Chester and Sibella.</p>

<p>27. Sibella, like Chester, repudiates the burglar theory, but
refuses to suggest an alternative, and says frankly that any member
of the Greene family may be guilty.</p>

<p>28. Ada says she was awakened by a menacing presence in her
room, which was in darkness; that she attempted to run from the
intruder, but was pursued by shuffling footsteps.</p>

<p>29. Ada says a hand touched her when she first arose from bed,
but refuses to make any attempt to identify the hand.</p>

<p>30. Sibella challenges Ada to say that it was she (Sibella) who
was in the room, and then deliberately accuses Ada of having shot
Julia. She also accuses Ada of having stolen the revolver from
Chester's room.</p>

<p>31. Von Blon, by his attitude and manner, reveals a curious
intimacy between Sibella and himself.</p>

<p>32. Ada is frankly fond of Von Blon.</p>

<p>SECOND CRIME</p>

<p>33. Four days after Julia and Ada are shot, at 11.30 p.m.,
Chester is murdered by a contact shot fired from a .32
revolver.</p>

<p>34. There is a look of amazement and horror on his face.</p>

<p>35. Sibella hears the shot and summons Sproot.</p>

<p>36. Sibella says she listened at her door immediately after the
shot was fired, but heard no other sound.</p>

<p>37. The lights are on in Chester's room. He was apparently
reading when the murderer entered.</p>

<p>38. A clear double set of footprints is found on the front walk.
The tracks have been made within half an hour of the crime.</p>

<p>39. A pair of galoshes, exactly corresponding to the footprints,
is found in Chester's clothes-closet.</p>

<p>40. Ada had a premonition of Chester's death, and, when informed
of it, guesses he has been shot in the same manner as Julia. But
she is greatly relieved when shown the footprint patterns
indicating that the murderer is an outsider.</p>

<p>41. Rex says he heard a noise in the hall and the sound of a
door closing twenty minutes before the shot was fired.</p>

<p>42. Ada, when told of Rex's story, recalls also having heard a
door close at some time after eleven.</p>

<p>43. It is obvious that Ada knows or suspects something.</p>

<p>44. The cook becomes emotional at the thought of anyone wanting
to harm Ada, but says she can understand a person having a reason
to shoot Julia and Chester.</p>

<p>45. Rex, when interviewed, shows clearly that he thinks someone
in the house is guilty.</p>

<p>46. Rex accuses Von Blon of being the murderer.</p>

<p>47. Mrs. Greene makes a request that the investigation be
dropped.</p>

<p>THIRD CRIME</p>

<p>48. Rex is shot in the forehead with a .32 revolver, at 11.20
a.m., twenty days after Chester has been killed and within five
minutes Ada phones him from the District Attorney's office.</p>

<p>49. There is no look of horror or surprise on Rex's face, as was
the case with Julia and Chester.</p>

<p>50. His body is found on the floor before the mantel.</p>

<p>51. A diagram which Ada asked him to bring with him to the
District Attorney's office has disappeared.</p>

<p>52. No one upstairs hears the shot, though the doors are open;
but Sproot, downstairs in the butler's pantry, hears it
distinctly.</p>

<p>53. Von Blon is visiting Sibella that morning; but she says she
was in the bath-room bathing her dog at the time Rex was shot.</p>

<p>54. Footprints are found in Ada's room coming from the balcony
door, which is ajar.</p>

<p>55. A single set of footprints is found leading from the front
walk to the balcony.</p>

<p>56. The tracks could have been made at any time after nine
o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>57. Sibella refuses to go away on a visit.</p>

<p>58. The galoshes that made all three sets of footprints are
found in the linen-closet, although they were not there when the
house was searched for the revolver.</p>

<p>59. The galoshes are returned to the linen-closet, but disappear
that night.</p>

<p>FOURTH CRIME</p>

<p>60. Two days after Rex's death Ada and Mrs. Greene are poisoned
within twelve hours of each other&mdash;Ada with morphine, Mrs.
Greene with strychnine.</p>

<p>61. Ada is treated at once and recovers.</p>

<p>62. Von Blon is seen leaving the house just before Ada swallows
the poison.</p>

<p>63. Ada is discovered by Sproot as a result of Sibella's dog
catching his teeth in the bell-cord.</p>

<p>64. The morphine was taken in the bouillon which was, as a rule,
given to Ada in the mornings by Mrs. Greene.</p>

<p>65. Ada states that no one visited her in her room after the
nurse had called her to come and drink the bouillon; but that she
went to Julia's room to get a shawl, leaving the bouillon unguarded
for several moments.</p>

<p>66. Neither Ada nor the nurse remembers having seen Sibella's
dog in the hall before the poisoned bouillon was taken.</p>

<p>67. Mrs, Greene is found dead of strychnine-poisoning the
morning after Ada swallowed the morphine.</p>

<p>68. The strychnine could have been administered only after 11
p.m. the previous night.</p>

<p>69. The nurse was in her room on the third floor between 11 and
11.30 p.m.</p>

<p>70. Von Blon was calling on Sibella that night, but Sibella says
he left her at 10.45.</p>

<p>71. The strychnine was administered in a dose of
citro-carbonate, which, presumably, Mrs. Greene would not have
taken without assistance.</p>

<p>72. Sibella decides to visit a girl chum in Atlantic City, and
leaves New York on the afternoon train.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTABLE FACTS</p>

<p>73. The same revolver is used on Julia, Ada, Chester, and
Rex.</p>

<p>74. All three sets of footprints have obviously been made by
someone in the house for the purpose of casting suspicion on an
outsider.</p>

<p>75. The murderer is someone whom both Julia and Chester would
receive in their rooms, in neglig&eacute;e, late at night.</p>

<p>76. The murderer does not make himself known to Ada, but enters
her room surreptitiously.</p>

<p>77. Nearly three weeks after Chester's death Ada comes to the
District Attorney's office, stating that she has important news to
impart.</p>

<p>78. Ada says that Rex has confessed to her that he heard the
shot in her room and also heard other things, but was afraid to
admit them; and she asks that Rex be questioned.</p>

<p>79. Ada tells of having found a cryptic diagram, marked with
symbols, in the lower hall near the library door.</p>

<p>80. On the day of Rex's murder Von Blon reports that his
medicine-case has been rifled of three grains of strychnine and six
grains of morphine&mdash; presumably at the Greene mansion.</p>

<p>81. The library reveals the fact that someone has been in the
habit of going there and reading by candle-light. The books that
show signs of having been read are: a handbook of the criminal
sciences, two works on toxicology, and two treatises on hysterical
paralysis and sleep-walking.</p>

<p>82. The visitor in the library is someone who understands German
well, for three of the books that have been read are in German.</p>

<p>83. The galoshes that disappeared from the linen-closet on the
night of Rex's murder are found in the library.</p>

<p>84. Someone listens at the door while the library is being
inspected.</p>

<p>85. Ada reports that she saw Mrs. Greene walking in the lower
hall the night before.</p>

<p>86. Von Blon asserts that Mrs. Greene's paralysis is of a nature
that makes movement a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>87. Arrangements are made with Von Blon to have Doctor
Oppenheimer examine Mrs. Greene.</p>

<p>88. Von Blon informs Mrs. Greene of the proposed examination,
which he has scheduled for the following day.</p>

<p>89. Mrs. Greene is poisoned before Doctor Oppenheimer's
examination can be made.</p>

<p>90. The post-mortem reveals conclusively that Mrs. Greene's leg
muscles were so atrophied that she could not have walked.</p>

<p>91. Ada, when told of the autopsy, insists that she saw her
mother's shawl about the figure in the hall, and, on being coerced,
admits that Sibella sometimes wore it.</p>

<p>92. During the questioning of Ada regarding the shawl Mrs.
Mannheim suggests that it was she herself whom Ada saw in the
hall.</p>

<p>93. When Julia and Ada were shot there were, or could have been,
present in the house: Chester, Sibella, Rex, Mrs. Greene, Von Blon,
Barton, Hemming, Sproot, and Mrs. Mannheim.</p>

<p>94. When Chester was shot there were, or could have been,
present in the house: Sibella, Rex, Mrs. Greene, Ada, Von Blon,
Barton, Hemming, Sproot, and Mrs. Mannheim.</p>

<p>95. When Rex was shot there were, or could have been, present in
the house: Sibella, Mrs. Greene, Von Blon, Hemming, Sproot, and
Mrs. Mannheim.</p>

<p>96. When Ada was poisoned there were, or could have been,
present in the house: Sibella, Mrs. Greene, Von Blon, Hemming,
Sproot, and Mrs. Mannheim.</p>

<p>97. When Mrs. Greene was poisoned there were, or could have
been, present in the house: Sibella, Von Blon, Ada, Hemming,
Sproot, and Mrs. Mannheim.</p>

<p>When Markham had finished reading the summary, he went through
it a second time. Then he laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"Yes, Vance," he said, "you've covered the main points pretty
thoroughly." But I can't see any coherence in them. In fact, they
seem only to emphasize the confusion of the case."</p>

<p>"And yet, Markham, I'm convinced that they only need
rearrangement and interpretation to be perfectly clear. Properly
analyzed, they'll tell us everything we want to know."</p>

<p>Markham glanced again through the pages.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for certain items, we could make out a case
against several people. But no matter what person in the list we
may assume to be guilty, we are at once confronted by a group of
contradictory, and insurmountable facts. This pr&eacute;cis could
be used effectively to prove that everyone concerned is
innocent."</p>

<p>"Superficially it appears that way," agreed Vance. "But we first
must find the generating line of the design, and then relate the
subsidi'ry forms of the pattern to it."</p>

<p>Markham made a hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>"If only life were as simple as your aesthetic theories!"</p>

<p>"It's dashed simpler," Vance asserted. "The mere mechanism of a
camera can record life; but only a highly developed creative
intelligence, with a profound philosophic insight, can produce a
work of art."</p>

<p>"Can you make any sense&mdash;aesthetic or otherwise&mdash;out
of this?" Markham petulantly tapped the sheets of paper.</p>

<p>"I can see certain traceries, so to speak&mdash;certain
suggestions of a pattern; but I'll admit the main design has thus
far eluded me. The fact is, Markham, I have a feeling that some
important factor in this case&mdash;some balancing line of the
pattern, perhaps&mdash;is still hidden from us. I don't say that my
resume is insusceptible of interpretation in its present state; but
our task would be greatly simplified if we were in possession of
the missing integer."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, when we had returned to Markham's main
office, Swacker came in and laid a letter on the desk.</p>

<p>"There's a funny one, Chief," he said.</p>

<p>Markham took up the letter and read it with a deepening frown.
When he had finished, he handed it to Vance. The letter-head read,
"Rectory, Third Presbyterian Church, Stamford, Connecticut"; the
date was the preceding day; and the signature was that of the
Reverend Anthony Seymour. The contents of the letter, written in a
small, precise hand, were as follows:</p>

<p>THE HONOURABLE JOHN F.-X. MARKHAM,</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;As far as I am aware, I have never
betrayed a confidence. But there can arise, I believe, unforeseen
circumstances to modify the strictness of one's adherence to a
given promise, and indeed impose upon one a greater duty than that
of keeping silent.</p>

<p>I have read in the papers of the wicked and abominable things
that have happened at the Greene residence in New York; and I have
therefore come to the conclusion, after much heart-searching and
prayer, that it is my bounden duty to put you in possession of a
fact which, as the result of a promise, I have kept to myself for
over a year. I would not now betray this trust did I not believe
that some good might possibly come of it, and that you, my dear
sir, would also treat the matter in the most sacred confidence. It
may not help you&mdash;indeed, I do not see how it can possibly
lead to a solution of the terrible curse that has fallen upon the
Greene family&mdash;but since the fact is connected intimately with
one of the members of that family, I will feel better when I have
communicated it to you.</p>

<p>On the night of August 29th, of last year, a machine drove up to
my door, and a man and a woman asked that I secretly marry them. I
may say that I am frequently receiving such requests from runaway
couples. This particular couple appeared to be well-bred dependable
people, and I concurred with their wishes, giving them my
assurances that the ceremony would, as they desired, be kept
confidential.</p>

<p>The names that appeared on the licence&mdash;which had been
secured in New Haven late that afternoon&mdash;were Sibella Greene,
of New York City, and Arthur Von Blon, also of New York City.</p>

<p>Vance read the letter and handed it back.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, I can't say that I'm astonished&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he broke off, his eyes fixed thoughtfully before him.
Then he rose nervously and paced up and down.</p>

<p>"That tears it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Markham threw him a look of puzzled interrogation. "What's the
point?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" Vance came quickly to the District Attorney's
desk. "My word! That's the one fact that's missing from my
tabulation." He then unfolded the last sheet and wrote:</p>

<p>98. Sibella and Von Blon were secretly married a year ago.</p>

<p>"But I don't see how that helps," protested Markham. "Neither do
I at this moment," Vance replied. "But I'm going to spend this
evening in erudite meditation."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV - A MYSTERIOUS TRIP</h2>

<p><b>(Sunday, December 5th)</b>
</p>

<p>THE Boston Symphony Orchestra was scheduled that afternoon to
play a Bach Concerto and Beethoven's C-Minor Symphony; and Vance,
on leaving the District Attorney's office, rode direct to Carnegie
Hall. He sat through the concert in a state of relaxed receptivity,
and afterward insisted on walking the two miles back to his
quarters&mdash;an almost unheard-of thing for him.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner Vance bade me good night and, donning his
slippers and house-robe, went into the library. I had considerable
work to do that night, and it was long past midnight when I
finished. On the way to my room I passed the library door, which
had been left slightly ajar, and I saw Vance sitting at his
desk&mdash;his head in his hands, the summary lying before
him&mdash;in an attitude of oblivious concentration. He was
smoking, as was habitual with him during any sort of mental
activity; and the ash- receiver at his elbow was filled with
cigarette-stubs. I moved on quietly, marvelling at the way this new
problem had taken hold of him.</p>

<p>It was half-past three in the morning when I suddenly awoke,
conscious of footsteps somewhere in the house. Rising quietly, I
went into the hall, drawn by a vague curiosity mingled with
uneasiness. At the end of the corridor a panel of light fell on the
wall, and as I moved forward in the semi-darkness I saw that the
light issued from the partly-open library door. At the same time I
became aware that the footsteps, too, came from that room. I could
not resist looking inside; and there I saw Vance walking up and
down, his chin sunk on his breast, his hands crammed into the deep
pockets of his dressing-gown. The room was dense with cigarette-
smoke, and his figure appeared misty in the blue haze. I went back
to bed and lay awake for an hour. When finally I dozed off it was
to the accompaniment of those rhythmic footfalls in the
library.</p>

<p>I rose at eight o'clock. It was a dark, dismal Sunday, and I had
my coffee in the living-room by electric light. When I glanced into
the library at nine Vance was still there, sitting at his desk. The
reading- lamp was burning, but the fire on the hearth had died out.
Returning to the living-room, I tried to interest myself in the
Sunday newspapers; but after scanning the accounts of the Greene
case I lit my pipe and drew up my chair before the grate.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock when Vance appeared at the door. All
night he had been up, wrestling with his self-imposed problem; and
the devitalizing effects of this long, sleepless concentration
showed on him only too plainly. There were shadowed circles around
his eyes; his mouth was drawn; and even his shoulders sagged
wearily. But, despite the shock his appearance gave me, my dominant
emotion was one of avid curiosity. I wanted to know the outcome of
this all-night vigil; and as he came into the room I gave him a
look of questioning expectancy.</p>

<p>When his eyes met mine he nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"I've traced the design," he said, holding out his hands to the
warmth of the fire. "And it's more horrible than I even imagined."
He was silent for some minutes. "Telephone Markham for me, will
you, Van? Tell him I must see him at once. Ask him to come to
breakfast. Explain that I'm a bit fagged."</p>

<p>He went out, and I heard him calling to Currie to prepare his
bath.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in inducing Markham to breakfast with us
after I had explained the situation; and in less than an hour he
arrived. Vance was dressed and shaved, and looked considerably
fresher than when I had first seen him that morning; but he was
still pale, and his eyes were fatigued.</p>

<p>No mention was made of the Greene case during breakfast, but
when we had sought easy chairs in the library, Markham could
withhold his impatience no longer.</p>

<p>"Van intimated over the phone that you had made something out of
the summary."</p>

<p>"Yes." Vance spoke dispiritedly. "I've fitted all the items
together. And it's damnable! No wonder the truth escaped us."</p>

<p>Markham leaned forward, his face tense, unbelieving. "You know
the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," came the quiet answer. "That is, my brain has
told me conclusively who's at the bottom of this fiendish affair;
but even now&mdash; in the daylight&mdash;I can't credit it.
Everything in me revolts against the acceptance of the truth. The
fact is, I'm almost afraid to accept it... Dash it all, I'm getting
mellow. Middle-age has crept upon me." He attempted to smile, but
failed.</p>

<p>Markham waited in silence.</p>

<p>"No, old man," continued Vance; "I'm not going to tell you now.
I can't tell you until I've looked into one or two matters. You
see, the pattern is plain enough, but the recognizable objects, set
in their new relationships, are grotesque&mdash;like the shapes in
an awful dream. I must first touch them and measure them to make
sure that they're not, after all, mere abortive vagaries."</p>

<p>"And how long will this verification take?" Markham knew there
was no use to try to force the issue. He realized that Vance was
fully conscious of the seriousness of the situation, and respected
his decision to investigate certain points before revealing his
conclusions.</p>

<p>"Not long, I hope." Vance went to his desk and wrote something
on a piece of paper, which he handed to Markham. "Here's a list of
the five books in Tobias's library that showed signs of having been
read by the nocturnal visitor. I want those books,
Markham&mdash;immediately. But I don't want anyone to know about
their being taken away. Therefore, I'm going to ask you to phone
Nurse O'Brien to get Mrs. Greene's key and secure them when no one
is looking. Tell her to wrap them up and give them to the detective
on guard in the house with instructions to bring them here. You can
explain to her what section of the book-shelves they're in."</p>

<p>Markham took the paper and rose without a word. At the door of
the den, however, he paused.</p>

<p>"Do you think it wise for the man to leave the house?"</p>

<p>"It won't matter," Vance told him. "Nothing more can happen
there at present."</p>

<p>Markham went on into the den. In a few minutes he returned.</p>

<p>"The books will be here in half an hour."</p>

<p>When the detective arrived with the package Vance unwrapped it
and laid the volumes beside his chair.</p>

<p>"Now, Markham, I'm going to do some reading. You won't mind,
what?" Despite his casual tone, it was evident that an urgent
seriousness underlay his words.</p>

<p>Markham got up immediately; and again I marvelled at the
complete understanding that existed between these two desperate
men.</p>

<p>"I have a number of personal letters to write," he said, "so
I'll run along. Currie's omelette was excellent.&mdash;When shall I
see you again? I could drop round at tea-time."</p>

<p>Vance held out his hand with a look bordering on affection.</p>

<p>"Make it five o'clock. I'll be through with my perusings by
then. And thanks for your tolerance." Then he added gravely:
"You'll understand, after I've told you everything, why I wanted to
wait a bit."</p>

<p>When Markham returned that afternoon a little before five Vance
was still reading in the library; but shortly afterward he joined
us in the living- room.</p>

<p>"The picture clarifies," he said. "The fantastic images are
gradually taking on the aspect of hideous realities. I've
substantiated several points, but a few facts still need
corroboration."</p>

<p>"To vindicate your hypothesis?"</p>

<p>"No, not that. The hypothesis is self-proving. There's no doubt
as to the truth. But&mdash;dash it all, Markham! I refuse to accept
it until every scrap of evidence has been incontestably
sustained."</p>

<p>"Is the evidence of such a nature that I can use it in a court
of law?"</p>

<p>"That is something I refuse even to consider. Criminal
proceedings seem utterly irrelevant in the present case. But I
suppose society must have its pound of flesh, and you&mdash;the
duly elected Shylock of God's great common people&mdash;will no
doubt wield the knife. However, I assure you I shall not be present
at the butchery."</p>

<p>Markham studied him curiously.</p>

<p>"Your words sound rather ominous. But if, as you say, you have
discovered the perpetrator of these crimes, why shouldn't society
exact punishment?"</p>

<p>"If society were omniscient, Markham, it would have a right to
sit in judgment. But society is ignorant and venomous, devoid of
any trace of insight or understanding. It exalts knavery, and
worships stupidity. It crucifies the intelligent, and puts the
diseased in dungeons. And, withal, it arrogates to itself the right
and ability to analyze the subtle sources of what it calls 'crime,'
and to condemn to death all persons whose inborn and irresistible
impulses it does not like. That's your sweet society,
Markham&mdash;a pack of wolves watering at the mouth for victims on
whom to vent its organized lust to kill and flay."</p>

<p>Markham regarded him with some astonishment and considerable
concern.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are preparing to let the criminal escape in the
present case," he said with the irony of resentment.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Vance assured him. "I shall turn your victim over to
you. The Greene murderer is of a particularly vicious type, and
should be rendered impotent. I was merely trying to suggest that
the electric chair&mdash;that touchin' device of your beloved
society&mdash;is not quite the correct method of dealing with this
culprit."</p>

<p>"You admit, however, that he is a menace to society."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. And the hideous thing about it is that this
tournament of crime at the Greene mansion will continue unless we
can put a stop to it. That's why I am being so careful. As the case
now stands, I doubt if you could even make an arrest."</p>

<p>When tea was over Vance got up and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"By the by, Markham," he said off-handedly, "have you received
any report on Sibella's activities?"</p>

<p>"Nothing important. She's still in Atlantic City, and evidently
intends to stay there for some time. She phoned Sproot yesterday to
send down another trunkful of her clothes."</p>

<p>"Did she, now? That's very gratifyin'." Vance walked to the door
with sudden resolution. "I think I'll run out to the Greenes' for a
little while. I shan't be gone over an hour: Wait for me here,
Markham&mdash;there's a good fellow; I don't want my visit to have
an official flavour. There's a new <i>Simplicissimus</i> on the
table to amuse you till I return. Con it and thank your own special
gods that you have no Thony or Gulbranssen in this country to
caricature your Gladstonian features."</p>

<p>As he spoke he beckoned to me, and, before Markham could
question him, we passed out into the hall and down the stairs.
Fifteen minutes later a taxicab set us down before the Greene
mansion.</p>

<p>Sproot opened the door for us, and Vance, with only a curt
greeting, led him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that Miss Sibella phoned you yesterday
from Atlantic City and asked to have a trunk shipped to her."</p>

<p>Sproot bowed. "Yes, sir. I sent the trunk off last night."</p>

<p>"What did Miss Sibella say to you over the phone?" "Very little,
sir&mdash;the connection was not good. She said merely that she had
no intention of returning to New York for a considerable time and
needed more clothes than she had taken with her."</p>

<p>"Did she ask how things were going at the house here?"</p>

<p>"Only in the most casual way, sir."</p>

<p>"Then she didn't seem apprehensive about what might happen here
while she was away?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. In fact&mdash;if I may say so without
disloyalty&mdash;her tone of voice was quite indifferent, sir."</p>

<p>"Judging from her remarks about the trunk, how long would you
say she intends to be away?"</p>

<p>Sproot considered the matter.</p>

<p>"That's difficult to say, sir. But I would go so far as to
venture the opinion that Miss Sibella intends to remain in Atlantic
City for a month or more."</p>

<p>Vance nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"And now, Sproot," he said, "I have a particularly important
question to ask you. When you first went into Miss Ada's room on
the night she was shot and found her on the floor before the
dressing-table, was the window open? Think! I want a positive
answer. You know the window is just beside the dressing-table and
overlooks the steps leading to the stone balcony. <i>Was it open or
shut</i>?"</p>

<p>Sproot contracted his brows and appeared to be recalling the
scene. Finally he spoke, and there was no doubt in his voice.</p>

<p>"The window was open, sir. I recall it now quite distinctly.
After Mr. Chester and I had lifted Miss Ada to the bed, I closed it
at once for fear she would catch cold."</p>

<p>"How far open was the window?" asked Vance with eager
impatience.</p>

<p>"Eight or nine inches, sir, I should say. Perhaps a foot."
"Thank you, Sproot. That will be all. Now please tell the cook I
want to see her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mannheim came in a few minutes later, and Vance indicated a
chair near the desk-light. When the woman had seated herself he
stood before her and fixed her with a stern, implacable gaze.</p>

<p>"Frau Mannheim, the time for truth-telling has come. I am here
to ask you a few questions, and unless I receive a straight answer
to them I shall report you to the police. You will, I assure you,
receive no consideration at their hands."</p>

<p>The woman tightened her lips stubbornly and shifted her eyes,
unable to meet Vance's penetrating stare.</p>

<p>"You told me once that your husband died in New Orleans thirteen
years ago. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>Vance's question seemed to relieve her mind, and she answered
readily.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Thirteen years ago."</p>

<p>"What month?"</p>

<p>"In October."</p>

<p>"Had he been ill long?"</p>

<p>"About a year."</p>

<p>"What was the nature of his illness?"</p>

<p>Now a look of fright came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know&mdash;exactly," she stammered. "The doctors
didn't let me see him."</p>

<p>"He was in a hospital?"</p>

<p>She nodded several times rapidly. "Yes&mdash;a hospital."</p>

<p>"And I believe you told me, Frau Mannheim, that you saw Mr.
Tobias Greene a year before your husband's death. That would have
been about the time your husband entered the
hospital&mdash;fourteen years ago."</p>

<p>She looked vaguely at Vance, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"And it was exactly fourteen years ago that Mr. Greene adopted
Ada."</p>

<p>The woman caught her breath sharply. A look of panic contorted
her face.</p>

<p>"So when your husband died," continued Vance, "you came to Mr.
Greene, knowing he would give you a position."</p>

<p>He went up to her and touched her filially on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have suspected for some time, Frau Mannheim," he said kindly,
"that Ada is your daughter. It's true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>With a convulsive sob the woman hid her face in her apron.</p>

<p>"I gave Mr. Greene my word," she confessed brokenly, "that I
wouldn't tell anyone&mdash;not even Ada&mdash;if he let me stay
here&mdash;to be near her."</p>

<p>"You haven't told anyone," Vance consoled her. "It was not your
fault that I guessed it."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mannheim left us a little later Vance had succeeded in
allaying her apprehension and distress. He then sent for Ada.</p>

<p>As she entered the drawing-room the troubled look in her eyes
and the pallor of her cheeks told clearly of the strain she was
under. Her first question voiced the fear uppermost in her
mind.</p>

<p>"Have you found out anything, Mr. Vance?" She spoke with an air
of pitiful discouragement. "It's terrible alone here in this big
house&mdash;especially at night. Every sound I hear..."</p>

<p>"You mustn't let your imagination get the best of you, Ada,"
Vance counselled her. Then he added: "We know a lot more now than
we did, and before long, I hope, all your fears will be done away
with. In fact, it's in regard to what we've found out that I've
come here to-day. I thought perhaps you could help me again."</p>

<p>"If only I could! But I've thought and thought..."</p>

<p>Vance smiled.</p>

<p>"Let us do the thinking, Ada.&mdash;What I wanted to ask you is
this: do you know if Sibella speaks German well?" The girl appeared
surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. And so did Julia and Chester and Rex. Father insisted
on their learning it. And he spoke it too&mdash;almost as well as
he spoke English. As for Sibella, I've often heard her and Doctor
Von Blon talking in German."</p>

<p>"But she spoke with an accent, I suppose."</p>

<p>"A slight accent&mdash;she'd never been long in Germany. But she
spoke German very well."</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to be sure of."</p>

<p>"Then you do know something!" Her voice quavered with eagerness.
"Oh, how long before this awful suspense will be over? Every night
for weeks I've been afraid to turn out my lights and go to
sleep."</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid to turn out your lights now," Vance
assured her. "There won't be any more attempts on your life,
Ada."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment searchingly, and something in his
manner seemed to hearten her. When we took our leave the colour had
come back to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Markham was pacing the library restlessly when we arrived
home.</p>

<p>"I've checked several more points," Vance announced. "But I've
missed the important one&mdash;the one, that would explain the
unbelievable hideousness of the thing I've unearthed."</p>

<p>He went directly into the den, and we could hear him
telephoning. Returning a few minutes later, he looked anxiously at
his watch. Then he rang for Currie and ordered his bag packed for a
week's trip.</p>

<p>"I'm going away, Markham," he said. "I'm going to
travel&mdash;they say it broadens the mind. My train departs in
less than an hour; and I'll be away a week. Can you bear to be
without me for so long? However, nothing will happen in connection
with the Greene case during my absence. In fact, I'd advise you to
shelve it temporarily."</p>

<p>He would say no more, and in half an hour he was ready to
go.</p>

<p>"There's one thing you can do for me while I'm away," he told
Markham, as he slipped into his overcoat. "Please have drawn up for
me a complete and detailed weather report from the day preceding
Julia's death to the day following Rex's murder."</p>

<p>He would not let either Markham or me accompany him to the
station, and we were left in ignorance of even the direction in
which his mysterious trip was to take him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV - THE CAPTURE</h2>

<p><b>(Monday, December 13th; 4 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>IT was eight days before Vance returned to New York. He arrived
on the afternoon of Monday, December 13th, and, after he had had
his tub and changed his clothes, he telephoned Markham to expect
him in half an hour. He then ordered his Hispano-Suiza from the
garage; and by this sign I knew he was under a nervous strain. In
fact, he had spoken scarcely a dozen words to me since his return,
and as he picked his way down-town through the late afternoon
traffic he was gloomy and preoccupied. Once I ventured to ask him
if his trip had been successful, and he had merely nodded. But when
we turned into Centre Street he relented a little, and said:</p>

<p>"There was never any doubt as to the success of my trip, Van. I
knew what I'd find. But I didn't dare trust my reason; I had to see
the records with my own eyes before I'd capitulate unreservedly to
the conclusion I'd formed."</p>

<p>Both Markham and Heath were waiting for us in the District
Attorney's office. It was just four o'clock, and, the sun had
already dropped below the New York Life Building which towered
about the old Criminal Courts structure a block to the
south-west.</p>

<p>"I took it for granted you had something important to tell me,"
said Markham; "so I asked the sergeant to come here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've much to tell." Vance had thrown himself into a chair,
and was lighting a cigarette. "But first I want to know if anything
has happened in my absence."</p>

<p>"Nothing. Your prognostication was quite accurate. Things have
been quiet and apparently normal at the Greene mansion."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," interposed Heath, "we may have a little better chance
this week of getting hold of something to work on. Sibella returned
from Atlantic City yesterday, and Von Blon's been hanging round the
house ever since."</p>

<p>"Sibella back?" Vance sat up, and his eyes became intent.</p>

<p>"At six o'clock yesterday evening," said Markham. "The newspaper
man at the beach ferreted her out and ran a sensational story about
her. After that the poor girl didn't have an hour's peace; so
yesterday she packed up and came back. We got word of the move
through the men the sergeant had set to watch her. I ran out to see
her this morning, and advised her to go away again. But she was
pretty thoroughly disgusted, and stubbornly refused to quit the
Greene house&mdash;said death was preferable to being hounded by
reporters and scandal-mongers."</p>

<p>Vance had risen and moved to the window, where he stood scanning
the grey skyline.</p>

<p>"Sibella's back, eh?" he murmured. Then he turned round. "Let me
see that weather report I asked you to prepare for me."</p>

<p>Markham reached into a drawer and handed him a typewritten sheet
of paper.</p>

<p>After perusing it, he tossed it back on the desk.</p>

<p>"Keep that, Markham. You'll need it when you face your twelve
good men and true."</p>

<p>"What is it you have to tell us, Mr. Vance?" The sergeant's
voice was impatient despite his effort to control it. "Mr. Markham
said you had a line on the case. For God's sake, sir, if you've got
any evidence against any one, slip it to me and let me make an
arrest. I'm getting thin worrying over this damn business."</p>

<p>Vance drew himself together.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know who the murderer is, Sergeant; and I have the
evidence&mdash; though it wasn't my plan to tell you just yet.
However"&mdash;he went to the door with grim resolution&mdash;"we
can't delay matters any longer now. Our hand has been
forced.&mdash;Get into your coat, Sergeant&mdash;and you, too,
Markham. We'd better get out to the Greene house before dark."</p>

<p>"But, damn it all, Vance!" Markham expostulated. "Why don't you
tell us what's in your mind?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain now&mdash;you'll understand why
later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you know so much, Mr. Vance," broke in Heath, "what's
keeping us from making an arrest?"</p>

<p>"You're going to make your arrest, Sergeant&mdash;inside of an
hour." Though he gave the promise without enthusiasm, it acted
electrically on both Heath and Markham.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the four of us were driving up West Broadway
in Vance's car.</p>

<p>Sproot as usual admitted us without the faintest show of
interest, and stood aside respectfully for us to enter.</p>

<p>"We wish to see Miss Sibella," said Vance. "Please tell her to
come to the drawing-room&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but Miss Sibella is out."</p>

<p>"Then tell Miss Ada we want to see her."</p>

<p>"Miss Ada is out also, sir." The butler's unemotional tone
sounded strangely incongruous in the tense atmosphere we had
brought with us.</p>

<p>"When do you expect them back?</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir. They went out motoring together. They
probably won't be gone long. Would you gentlemen care to wait?"</p>

<p>Vance hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll wait," he decided, and walked toward the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>But he had barely reached the archway when he turned suddenly
and called to Sproot, who was retreating slowly toward the rear of
the hall.</p>

<p>"You say Miss Sibella and Miss Ada went motoring together? How
long ago?"</p>

<p>"About fifteen minutes&mdash;maybe twenty, sir." A barely
perceptible lift of the man's eyebrows indicated that he was
greatly astonished by Vance's sudden change of manner.</p>

<p>"Whose car did they go in?"</p>

<p>"In Doctor Von Blon's. He was here to tea&mdash;" And who
suggested the ride, Sproot?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say, sir. They were sort of debating about it
when I came in to clear away the tea things."</p>

<p>"Repeat everything you heard!" Vance spoke rapidly and with more
than a trace of excitement.</p>

<p>"When I entered the room the doctor was saying as how he thought
it would be a good thing for the young ladies to get some fresh
air; and Miss Sibella said she'd had enough fresh air."</p>

<p>"And Miss Ada?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember her saying anything, sir."</p>

<p>"And they went out to the car while you were here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I opened the door for them."</p>

<p>"And did Doctor Von Blon go in the car with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I believe they were to drop him at Mrs. Riglander's,
where he had a professional call to make. From what he said as he
went out I gathered that the young ladies were then to take a
drive, and that he was to call here for the car after dinner."</p>

<p>"What!" Vance stiffened, and his eyes burned upon the old
butler. "Quick, Sproot! Do you know where Mrs. Riglander
lives?"</p>

<p>"On Madison Avenue in the Sixties, I believe."</p>

<p>"Get her on the phone&mdash;find out if the doctor has
arrived."</p>

<p>I could not help marvelling at the impassive way in which the
man went to the telephone to comply with this astonishing and
seemingly incomprehensible request. When he returned his face was
expressionless.</p>

<p>"The doctor has not arrived at Mrs. Riglander's, sir," he
reported.</p>

<p>"He's certainly had time," Vance commented, half to himself.
Then: "Who drove the car when it left here, Sproot?"</p>

<p>I couldn't say for certain, sir. I didn't notice particularly.
But it's my impression that Miss Sibella entered the car first as
though she intended to drive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, Markham!" Vance started for the door. "I don't like this
at all. There's a mad idea in my head... Hurry, man! If something
devilish should happen..."</p>

<p>We had reached the car, and Vance sprang to the wheel. Heath and
Markham, in a daze of incomprehension but swept along by the
other's ominous insistence, took their places in the tonneau; and I
sat beside the driver's seat.</p>

<p>"We're going to break all the traffic and speed regulations,
Sergeant," Vance announced, as he manoeuvred the car in the narrow
street; "so have your badge and credentials handy. I may be taking
you chaps on a wild- goose chase, but we've got to risk it."</p>

<p>We darted toward First Avenue, cut the corner short, and turned
up-town. At 59th Street we swung west and went toward Columbus
Circle. A surface car held us up at Lexington Avenue; and at Fifth
Avenue we were stopped by a traffic officer. But Heath showed his
card and spoke a few words, and we struck across Central Park.
Swinging perilously round the curves of the driveways, we came out
into 81st Street and headed for Riverside Drive. There was less
congestion here, and we made between forty and fifty miles an hour
all the way to Dyckman Street.</p>

<p>It was a nerve-racking ordeal, for not only had the shadows of
evening fallen, but the streets were slippery in places where the
melted snow had frozen in large sheets along the sloping sides of
the Drive. Vance, however, was an excellent driver. For two years
he had driven the same car, and he understood thoroughly how to
handle it. Once we skidded drunkenly, but he managed to right the
traction before the rear wheels came in contact with the high
kerbing. He kept the siren horn screeching constantly, and other
cars drew away from us, giving us a fairly clear road.</p>

<p>At several street intersections we had to slow down; and twice
we were halted by traffic officers, but were permitted to proceed
the moment the occupants of the tonneau were recognized. On North
Broadway we were forced to the kerb by a motor-cycle policeman, who
showered us with a stream of picturesque abuse. But when Heath had
cut him short with still more colourful vituperation, and he had
made out Markham's features in the shadows, he became ludicrously
humble, and acted as an advance-guard for us all the way to
Yonkers, clearing the road and holding up traffic at every
cross-street.</p>

<p>At the railroad tracks near Yonker's Ferry we were obliged to
wait several minutes for the shunting of some freight-cars, and
Markham took this opportunity of venting his emotions.</p>

<p>"I presume you have a good reason for this insane ride, Vance,"
he said angrily. "But since I'm taking my life in my hands by
accompanying you, I'd like to know what your objective is."</p>

<p>"There's not time now for explanations," Vance replied
brusquely. "Either I'm on a fool's errand, or there's an abominable
tragedy ahead of us." His face was set and white, and he looked
anxiously at his watch. "We're twenty minutes ahead of the usual
running time from the Plaza to Yonkers. Furthermore, we're taking
the direct route to our destination&mdash;another ten minutes'
saving. If the thing I fear is scheduled for to-night, the other
car will go by the Spuyten Duyvil Road and through the back lanes
along the river&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the crossing-bars were lifted, and our car jerked
forward, picking up speed with breathless rapidity.</p>

<p>Vance's words had set a train of thought going in my mind. The
Spuyten Duyvil Road&mdash;the back lanes along the river...
Suddenly there flashed on my brain a memory of that other ride we
had taken weeks before with Sibella and Ada and Von Blon; and a
sense of something inimical and indescribably horrifying took
possession of me. I tried to recall the details of that
ride&mdash;how we had turned off the main road at Dyckman Street,
skirted the palisades through old wooded estates, traversed private
hedge-lined roadways, entered Yonkers from the Riverdale Road,
turned again from the main highway past the Ardsley Country Club,
taken the little-used road along the river toward Tarrytown, and
stopped on the high cliff to get a panoramic view of the Hudson...
That cliff overlooking the waters of the river!&mdash;Ah, now I
remembered Sibella's cruel jest&mdash;her supposedly satirical
suggestion of how a perfect murder might be committed there. And on
the instant of that recollection I knew where Vance was
heading&mdash;I understood the thing he feared! He believed that
another car was also heading for that lonely precipice beyond
Ardsley&mdash;a car that had nearly half an hour start...</p>

<p>We were now below the Longue Vue hill, and a few moments later
we swung into the Hudson Road. At Dobbs Ferry another officer
stepped in our path and waved frantically; but Heath, leaning over
the running-board, shouted some unintelligible words, and Vance,
without slackening speed, skirted the officer and plunged ahead
toward Ardsley.</p>

<p>Ever since we had passed Yonkers, Vance had been inspecting
every large car along the way. He was, I knew, looking for Von
Blon's low-hung yellow Daimler. But there had been no sign of it,
and, as he threw on the brakes preparatory to turning into the
narrow road by the Country Club golf- links, I heard him mutter
half aloud:</p>

<p>"God help us if we're too late!"* (*This was the first and only
time during my entire friendship with Vance that I ever heard him
use a Scriptural expletive.)</p>

<p>We made the turn at the Ardsley station at such a rate of speed
that I held my breath for fear we would upset; and I had to grip
the seat with both hands to keep my balance as we jolted over the
rough road along the river level. We took the hill before us in
high gear, and climbed swiftly to the dirt roadway along the edge
of the bluff beyond.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we rounded the hill's crest when an exclamation
broke from Vance, and simultaneously I noticed a flickering red
light bobbing in the distance. A new spurt of speed brought us
perceptibly nearer to the car before us, and it was but a few
moments before we could make out its lines and colour. There was no
mistaking Von Blon's great Daimler.</p>

<p>"Hide your faces," Vance shouted over his shoulder to Markham
and Heath." Don't let anyone see you as we pass the car ahead."</p>

<p>I leaned over below the panel of the front door, and a few
seconds later a sudden swerve told me that we were about circling
the Daimler. The next moment we were back in the road, rushing
forward in the lead.</p>

<p>Half a mile farther on the road narrowed. There was a deep ditch
on one side and dense shrubbery on the other. Vance quickly threw
on the brakes, and our rear wheels skidded on the hard frozen
earth, bringing us to a halt with our car turned almost at
right-angles with the road, completely blocking the way.</p>

<p>"Out, you chaps!" called Vance.</p>

<p>We had no more than alighted when the other car drove up and,
with a grinding of brakes, came to a lurching halt within a few
feet of our machine. Vance had run back, and as the car reached a
standstill he threw open the front door. The rest of us had
instinctively crowded after him, urged forward by some undefined
sense of excitement and dread foreboding. The Daimler was of the
sedan type with small high windows, and even with the lingering
radiance of the western sky and the dashboard illumination I could
barely make out the figures inside. But at that moment Heath's
pocket flashlight blazed in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>The sight that met my straining eyes was paralyzing. During the
drive I had speculated on the outcome of our tragic adventure, and
I had pictured several hateful possibilities. But I was wholly
unprepared for the revelation that confronted me.</p>

<p>The tonneau of the car was empty; and, contrary to my
suspicions, there was no sign of Von Blon. In the front seat were
the two girls. Sibella was on the farther side, slumped down in the
corner, her head hanging forward. On her temple was an ugly cut,
and a stream of blood ran down her cheek. At the wheel sat Ada,
glowering at us with cold ferocity. Heath's flash-light fell,
directly on her face, and at first she did not recognize us. But as
her pupils became adjusted to the glare her gaze concentrated on
Vance, and a foul epithet burst from her.</p>

<p>Simultaneously her right hand dropped from the wheel to the seat
beside her, and when she raised it again it held a small glittering
revolver. There was a flash of flame and a sharp report, followed
by a shattering, of glass where the bullet had struck the
wind-shield. Vance had been standing with one foot on the
running&mdash;board leaning into the car, and, as Ada's arm came up
with the revolver, he had snatched her wrist and held it.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," came his drawling voice, strangely calm, and
without animosity; "you shan't add me to your list. I was rather
expecting that move, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Ada, frustrated in her attempt to shoot him, hurled herself upon
him with savage fury. Vile abuse and unbelievable blasphemies
poured from her snarling lips. Her wrath, feral and rampant,
utterly possessed her. She was like a wild animal, cornered and
conscious of defeat, yet fighting with a last instinct of hopeless
desperation. Vance, however, had secured both her wrists, and could
have broken her arms with a single twist of his hands; but he
treated her almost tenderly, like a father subduing an infuriated
child. Stepping back quickly he drew her into the roadway, where
she continued her struggles with renewed violence.</p>

<p>"Come, Sergeant!" Vance spoke with weary exasperation. "You'd
better put handcuffs on her. I don't want to hurt her."</p>

<p>Heath had stood watching the amazing drama in a state of
bewilderment, apparently too nonplussed to move. But Vance's voice
awakened him to sharp activity. There were two metallic clicks, and
Ada suddenly relaxed into a listless attitude of sullen
tractability. She leaned panting against the side of the car as if
too weak to stand alone.</p>

<p>Vance bent over and picked up the revolver which had fallen to
the road. With a cursory glance at it he handed it to Markham.</p>

<p>"There's Chester's gun," he said. Then he indicated Ada with a
pitying movement of the head. "Take her to your office,
Markham&mdash;Van will drive the car. I'll join you there as soon
as I can. I must get Sibella to a hospital."</p>

<p>He stepped briskly into the Daimler. There was a shifting of
gears, and with a few deft manipulations he reversed the car in the
narrow road.</p>

<p>"And watch her, Sergeant!" he flung back, as the car darted away
toward Ardsley.</p>

<p>I drove Vance's car back to the city. Markham and Heath sat in
the rear seat with the girl between them. Hardly a word was spoken
during the entire hour-and-a-half's ride. Several times I glanced
behind me at the silent trio. Markham and the sergeant appeared
completely stunned by the surprising truth that had just been
revealed to them. Ada, huddled between them, sat apathetically with
closed eyes, her head forward. Once I noticed that she pressed a
handkerchief to her face with her manacled hands; and I thought I
heard the sound of smothered sobbing. But I was too nervous to pay
any attention. It took every effort of my will to keep my mind on
my driving.</p>

<p>As I drew up before the Franklin Street entrance of the Criminal
Courts Building and was about to shut off the engine, a startled
exclamation from Heath caused me to release the switch.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother o' God!" I heard him say in a hoarse voice. Then he
thumped me on the back. "Get to the Beekman Street
Hospital&mdash;as quick as hell, Mr. Van Dine. Damn the traffic
lights! Step on it!"</p>

<p>Without looking round I knew what had happened. I swung the car
into Centre Street again, and fairly raced for the hospital. We
carried Ada into the emergency ward, Heath bawling loudly for the
doctor as we passed through the door.</p>

<p>It was more than an hour later when Vance entered the District
Attorney's office, where Markham and Heath and I were waiting. He
glanced quickly round the room and then looked at our faces.</p>

<p>"I told you to watch her, Sergeant," he said, sinking into a
chair; but there was neither reproach nor regret in his voice.</p>

<p>None of us spoke. Despite the effect Ada's suicide had had on
us, we were waiting, with a kind of conscience-stricken anxiety,
for news of the other girl whom all of us, I think, had vaguely
suspected.</p>

<p>Vance understood our silence and nodded reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Sibella's all right. I took her to the Trinity Hospital in
Yonkers. A slight concussion&mdash;Ada had struck her with a
box-wrench which was always kept under the front seat. She'll be
out in a few days. I registered her at the hospital as Mrs. Von
Blon, and then phoned her husband. I caught him at home, and he
hurried out. He's with her now. Incidentally, the reason we didn't
reach him at Mrs. Riglander's is because he stopped at the office
for his medicine-case. That delay saved Sibella's life. Otherwise,
I doubt if we'd have reached her before Ada had run her over the
precipice in the machine."</p>

<p>He drew deeply on his cigarette for a moment. Then he lifted his
eyebrows to Markham.</p>

<p>"Cyanide of potassium?"</p>

<p>Markham gave a slight start.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or so the doctor thinks. There was a bitter-almond
odour on her lips." He shot his head forward angrily. "But if you
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't have stopped it in any case," interrupted Vance.
"I discharged my wholly mythical duty to the State when I warned
the sergeant. However, I didn't know at the time. Von Blon just
gave me the information. When I told him what had happened I asked
him if he had ever lost any other poisons&mdash;you see, I couldn't
imagine anyone planning so devilish and hazardous an exploit as the
Greene murders without preparing for the eventuality of failure. He
told me he'd missed a tablet of cyanide from his dark room about
three months ago. And when I jogged his memory he recalled that Ada
had been poking round there and asking questions a few days before.
The one cyanide tablet was probably all she dared take at the time;
so she kept it for herself in case of an emergency."* (*As I
learned later, Doctor Von Blon, who was an ardent amateur
photographer, often used half-gramme tablets of cyanide of
potassium and there had been three of them in his dark-room when
Ada had called. Several days later, when preparing to redevelop a
plate, he could only find two, but had thought little of the loss
until questioned by Vance.)</p>

<p>"What I want to know, Mr. Vance," said Heath, "is how she worked
this scheme. Was there anyone else in on the deal?"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant. Ada planned and executed every part of it."</p>

<p>"But how, in God's name&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Vance held up his hand.</p>

<p>"It's all very simple, Sergeant&mdash;once you have the key.
What misled us was the fiendish cleverness and audacity of the
plot. But there's no longer any need to speculate about it. I have
a printed and bound explanation of everything that happened. And
it's not a fictional or speculative explanation. It's actual
criminal history, garnered and recorded by the greatest expert on
the subject the world has yet known&mdash;doctor Hans Gross, of
Vienna."</p>

<p>He rose and took up his coat.</p>

<p>"I phoned Currie from the hospital, and he has a belated dinner
waiting for all of us. When we have eaten, I'll present you with a
reconstruction and exposition of the entire case."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI - THE ASTOUNDING TRUTH</h2>

<p><b>(Monday, December 13th; 11 p.m.)</b>
</p>

<p>"AS you know, Markham," Vance began, when we were seated about
the library fire late that night, "I finally succeeded in putting
together the items of my summary in such a way that I could see
plainly who the murderer was.* Once I had found the basic pattern,
every detail fitted perfectly into a plastic whole. The technique
of the crimes, however, remained obscure; so I asked you to send
for the books in Tobias's library&mdash;I was sure they would tell
me what I wanted to know. First, I went through Gross's 'Handbuch
fur Untersuchungsrichter,' which I regarded as the most likely
source of information. It is an amazing treatise, Markham. It
covers the entire field of the history and science of crime; and,
in addition, is a compendium of criminal technique, citing specific
cases and containing detailed explanations and diagrams. Small
wonder it is the world's standard cyclopaedia on its subject. As I
read it, I found what I was looking for. Ada had copied every act
of hers, every method, every device, every detail, from its
pages&mdash;<i>from actual criminal history</i>! We are hardly to
be blamed for our inability to combat her schemes; for it was not
she alone who was deceiving us; it was the accumulated experience
of hundreds of shrewd criminals before her, plus the analytic
science of the world's greatest criminologist Doctor Hans Gross."*
(*I later asked Vance to rearrange the items for me in the order of
his final sequence. The distribution, which told him the truth, was
as follows: 3, 4, 44, 92, 9, 2, 47, 1, 5, 32, 31, 98, 8, 81, 84,
82, 7, 10, 11, 61, 15, 16, 93, 33, 94, 76, 75, 48, 17, 38, 55, 54,
18, 39, 56, 41, 42, 28, 43, 58, 59, 83, 74, 40, 12, 34, 13, 14, 37,
22, 23, 35, 36, 19, 73, 26, 20, 21 45. 25, 46, 27, 29, 30, 57, 77,
24, 78, 79, 51, 50, 52, 53, 49, 95, 80, 85, 86, 87, 88, 60, 62, 64,
63, 66, 65, 96, 89, 67, 71, 69, 68, 70, 97, 90, 91, 72.)</p>

<p>He paused to light another cigarette.</p>

<p>"But even when I had found the explanation of her crimes," he
continued, "I felt that there was something lacking, some
fundamental <i>penchant</i>&mdash; the thing that made this orgy of
horror possible and gave viability, so to speak, to her operations.
We knew nothing of Ada's early life or of her progenitors and
inherited instincts; and without that knowledge the crimes, despite
their clear logic, were incredible. Consequently, my next step was
to verify Ada's psychological and environmental sources. I had had
a suspicion from the first that she was Frau Mannheim's daughter.
But even when I verified this fact I couldn't see its bearing on
the case. It was obvious, from our interview with Frau Mannheim,
that Tobias and her husband had been in shady deals together in the
old days; and she later admitted to me that her husband had died
thirteen years ago, in October, at New Orleans after a year's
illness in a hospital. She also said, as you may recall, that she
had seen Tobias a year prior to her husband's death. This would
have been fourteen years ago&mdash;just the time Ada was adopted by
Tobias. I thought there might be some connection between Mannheim
and the crimes, and I even toyed with the idea that Sproot was
Mannheim, and that a dirty thread of blackmail ran through the
situation. So I decided to investigate. My mysterious trip last
week was to New Orleans; and there I had no difficulty in learning
the truth. By looking up the death records for October thirteen
years ago, I discovered that Mannheim had been in an asylum for the
criminally insane for a year preceding his death. And from the
police I ascertained something of his record. Adolph
Mannheim&mdash;Ada's father&mdash;was, it seems, a famous German
criminal and murderer, who had been sentenced to death, but had
escaped from the penitentiary at Stuttgart and come to America. I
have a suspicion that the departed Tobias was, in some way, mixed
up in that escape. But whether or not I wrong him, the fact remains
that Ada's father was homicidal and a professional criminal. And
therein lies the explanat'ry background of her actions..."</p>

<p>"You mean she was crazy like her old man?" asked Heath.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant. I merely mean that the potentialities of
criminality had been handed down to her in her blood. When the
motive for the crimes became powerful, her inherited instincts
asserted themselves."</p>

<p>"But mere money," put in Markham, "seems hardly a strong enough
motive to inspire such atrocities as hers."</p>

<p>"It wasn't money alone that inspired her. The real motive went
much deeper. Indeed, it was perhaps the most powerful of all human
motives&mdash;a strange, terrible combination of hate and love and
jealousy and a desire for freedom. To begin with, she was the
Cinderella in that abnormal Greene family, looked down upon,
treated like a servant, made to spend her time caring for a nagging
invalid, and forced&mdash;as Sibella put it&mdash;to earn her
livelihood. Can you not see her for fourteen years brooding over
this treatment, nourishing her resentment, absorbing the poison
about her, and coming at length to despise everyone in that
household? That alone would have been enough to awaken her
congenital instincts. One almost wonders that she did not break
forth long before. But another equally potent element entered the
situation. She fell in love with Von Blon&mdash;a natural thing for
a girl in her position to do&mdash;and then learned that Sibella
had won his affections. She either knew or strongly suspected that
they were married; and her normal hatred of her sister was
augmented by a vicious and eroding jealousy...</p>

<p>"Now, Ada was the only member of the family who, according to
the terms of old Tobias's will, was not compelled to live on the
estate in event of marriage and in this fact she saw a chance to
snatch all the things she craved and at the same time to rid
herself of the persons against whom her whole passionate nature
cried out in deadly hatred. She calculated to get rid of the
family, inherit the Greene millions, and set her cap for Von Blon.
There was vengeance, too, as a motivating factor in all this; but
I'm inclined to think the amatory phase of the affair was the
prim'ry actuating force in the series of horrors she later
perpetrated. It gave her strength and courage; it lifted her into
that ecstatic realm where everything seemed possible, and where she
was willing to pay any price for the desired end. And there is one
point I might recall parenthetically&mdash;you remember that
Barton, the younger maid, told us how Ada sometimes acted like a
devil and used vile language. That fact should have given me a
hint; but who could have taken Barton seriously at that stage of
the game? ...</p>

<p>"To trace the origin of her diabolical scheme we must first
consider the locked library. Alone in the house, bored, resentful,
tied down&mdash;it was inevitable that this pervertedly romantic
child should play Pandora. She had every opportunity of securing
the key and having a duplicate made; and so the library became her
retreat, her escape from the gruelling, monotonous routine of her
existence. There she ran across those books on criminology. They
appealed to her, not only as a vicious outlet for her smouldering,
repressed hatred, but because they struck a responsive chord in her
tainted nature. Eventually she came upon Gross's great manual, and
thus found the entire technique of crime laid out before her, with
diagrams and examples&mdash;not a handbook for examining
magistrates, but a guide for a potential murderer! Slowly the idea
of her gory orgy took shape. At first perhaps she only imagined, as
a means of self- gratification, the application of this technique
of murder to those she hated. But after a time, no doubt, the
conception became real. She saw its practical possibilities; and
the terrible plot was formulated. She created this horror, and
then, with her diseased imagination, she came to believe in it. Her
plausible stories to us, her superb acting, her clever
deceptions&mdash;all were part of this horrible fantasy she had
engendered. That book of Grimms' 'Fairy Tales'!&mdash;I should have
understood. Y' see, it wasn't histrionism altogether on her part;
it was a kind of demoniac possession. She lived her dream. Many
young girls are like that under the stress of ambition and hatred.
Constance Kent completely deceived the whole of Scotland Yard into
believing in her innocence."</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It's curious how we instinctively close our eyes to the truth
when history is filled with substantiating examples of the very
thing we are contemplating. The annals of crime contain numerous
instances of girls in Ada's position who have been guilty of
atrocious crimes. Besides the famous case of Constance Kent, there
were, for example, Marie Boyer, and Madeliene Smith, and Grete
Beyer. I wonder if we'd have suspected them."* (*An account of the
cases of Madeleine Smith and Constance Kent may be found in Edmund
Lester Pearson's "Murder at Smutty Nose"; and a record of Marie
Boyer's case is included in H. B. Irving's "A Book of Remarkable
Criminals." Grete Beyer was the last woman to be publicly executed
in Austria.)</p>

<p>"Keep to the present, Vance," interposed Markham impatiently.
"You say Ada took all her ideas from Gross. But Gross's handbook is
written in German. How did you know she spoke German well
enough&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That Sunday when I went to the house with Van I inquired of Ada
if Sibella spoke German. I put my questions in such a way that she
could not answer without telling me whether or not she, too, knew
German well. Incidentally, I wanted her to think that I suspected
Sibella, so that she would not hasten matters until I returned from
New Orleans. I knew that as long as Sibella was in Atlantic City
she was safe from Ada."</p>

<p>"But what I want to know," put in Heath, "is how she killed Rex
when she was sitting in Mr. Markham's office."</p>

<p>"Let us take things in order, Sergeant," answered Vance. "Julia
was killed first because she was the manager of the establishment.
With her out of the way, Ada would have a free hand. And, another
thing, the death of Julia at the start fitted best into the scheme
she had outlined; it gave her the most plausible setting for
staging the attempted murder on herself. Ada had undoubtedly heard
some mention of Chester's revolver, and after she had secured it
she waited for the opportunity to strike the first blow. The
propitious circumstances fell on the night of November 8th; and at
half past eleven, when the house was asleep, she knocked on Julia's
door. She was admitted, and doubtless sat on the edge of Julia's
bed telling some story to explain her late visit. Then she drew the
gun from under her dressing-gown and shot Julia through the heart.
Back in her own bedroom, with the lights on, she stood before the
large mirror of the dressing-table, and, holding the gun in her
right hand, placed it against her left shoulder-blade at an oblique
angle. The mirror and the lights were essential, for she could thus
see exactly where to point the muzzle of the revolver. All this
occupied the three-minute interval between the shots. Then she
pulled the trigger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But a girl shooting herself as a fake!" objected Heath. "It
ain't natural."</p>

<p>"But Ada wasn't natural, Sergeant. None of the plot was natural.
That was why I was so anxious to look up her family history. But as
to shooting herself; that was quite logical when one considers her
true character. And, as a matter of fact, there was little or no
danger attaching to it. The gun was on a hair-trigger, and no
pressure was needed to discharge it. A slight flesh wound was the
worst she had to fear. Moreover, history is full of cases of
self-mutilation where the object to be gained was far smaller than
what Ada was after. Gross is full of them..."</p>

<p>He took up Volume I of the "Handbuch f&uuml;r
Untersuchungsrichter," which lay on the table beside him, and
opened it at a marked page.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, Sergeant. I'll translate the passage roughly as
I read: 'It is not uncommon to find people who inflict wounds upon
themselves; such are, besides persons pretending to be the victims
of assaults with deadly weapons, those who try to extort damages or
blackmailers. Thus it often happens that, after an insignificant
scuffle, one of the combatants shows wounds which he pretends to
have received. It is characteristic of these voluntary mutilations
that most frequently those who perform them do not quite complete
the operation, and that they are for the most part people who
manifest excessive piety, or lead a solitary life.'*
(*"Selbstverletzungen kommen nicht selten vor; abgesehen von
solchen bei fingierten Raubanf&auml;llen, st&ouml;sst man auf sie
dann, wenn Entsch&auml;digungen erpresst werden sollen; so
geschicht es, dass nach einer harmlosen Balgerie einer der
K&auml;mpfenden mit Verletzungen auftritt, die er damals erlitten
haben will. Kenntlich sind solche Selbstverst&uuml;mmelungen daran,
dass die Betreffenden meistens die Operation wegen der grossen
Schmerzen nicht ganz zu Ende f&uuml;hren, und dass es meistens
Leute mit uebertrieben pietistischer F&auml;rbung und meter
einsamen Lebenswandels sind."&mdash;H. Gross, "Handbuch f&uuml;r
Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik," I, pp. 32-34.)
...And surely, Sergeant, you are familiar with the self- mutilation
of soldiers to escape service. The most common method used by them
is to place their hand over the muzzle of the gun and blow their
fingers off."</p>

<p>Vance closed the book.</p>

<p>"And don't forget that the girl was hopeless, desperate, and
unhappy, with everything to win and nothing to lose. She would
probably have committed suicide if she had not worked out the plan
of the murders. A superficial wound in the shoulder meant little to
her in view of what she was to gain by it. And women have an almost
infinite capacity for self- immolation. With Ada, it was part of
her abnormal condition. No, Sergeant; the self-shooting was
perfectly consistent in the circumstances..."</p>

<p>"But in the back!" Heath looked dumbfounded. "That's what gets
me. Whoever heard&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Just a moment." Vance took up Volume II of the "Handbuch" and
opened it to a marked page. "Gross, for instance, has heard of many
such cases&mdash;in fact, they're quite common on the Continent.
And his record of them indubitably gave Ada the idea for shooting
herself in the back. Here's a single paragraph culled from many
pages of similar cases: 'That you should not be deceived by the
seat of the wound is proved by the following two cases. In the
Vienna Prater a man killed himself in the presence of several
people by shooting himself in the back of the head with a revolver.
Without the testimony of several witnesses nobody would have
accepted the theory of suicide. A soldier killed himself by a shot
with his military rifle through the back, by fixing the rifle in a
certain position and then lying down over it. Here again 'the
position of the wound seemed to exclude the theory of suicide.'"*
(*"Dass man sich durch den Sitz der Wunde niemals t&auml;uschen
lassen darf, beweisen zwei F&auml;lle. Im Wiener Prater hatte sich
ein Mann in Gegenwart mehrerer Personen get&ouml;tet, indem er sich
mit einem Revolver in den Hinterkopf schoss. W&auml;ren nicht die
Aussagen der Zeugen vorgelegen, h&auml;tte wohl kaum jemand an
einen Selbstmord geglaubt. Ein Soldat t&ouml;tete sich durch einen
in den R&uuml;cken gehenden Schuss aus einem Milit&auml;rgewehr,
ueber das er nach entsprechender Fixierung sich gelegt hatte; auch
her ware aus dem Sitz der Wunde wohl haum auf Selbstmord
geschlossen worden."&mdash;Ibid., II, p. 843.)</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Heath heaved himself forward and shook his
cigar at Vance. "What about the gun? Sproot entered Ada's room
right after the shot was fired, and there wasn't no sign of a
gun!"</p>

<p>Vance, without answering, merely turned the pages of Gross's
"Handbuch" to where another marker protruded, and began
translating:</p>

<p>"'Early one morning the authorities were informed that the
corpse of a murdered man had been found. At the spot indicated the
body was discovered of a grain merchant, A. M., supposed to be a
well-to-do man, face downward with a gunshot wound behind his ear.
The bullet, after passing through the brain, had lodged in the
frontal bone above the left eye. The place where the corpse was
found was in the middle of a bridge over a deep stream. Just when
the inquiry was concluding and the corpse was about to be removed
for the post-mortem, the investigating officer observed quite by
chance that on the decayed wooden parapet of the bridge, almost
opposite to the spot where the corpse lay, there was a small but
perfectly fresh dent which appeared to have been caused by a
violent blow on the upper edge of the parapet of a hard and angular
object. He immediately suspected that the dent had some connection
with the murder. Accordingly he determined to drag the bed of the
stream below the bridge, when almost immediately there was picked
up a strong cord about fourteen feet long with a large stone at one
end and at the other a discharged pistol, the barrel of which
fitted exactly the bullet extracted from the head of A. M. The case
was thus evidently one of suicide. A. M. had hung the stone over
the parapet of the bridge and discharged the pistol behind his ear.
The moment he fired he let go the pistol, which the weight of the
stone dragged over the parapet into the water.'* (*"Es wurde
zeitlich morgens dem UR. die Meldung von der Auffindung eines
Ermordeten ueberbracht. An Ort und Stelle fand sich der Leichnam
eines f&uuml;r wohlhabend geltenden Getreideh&auml;ndlers M., auf
dem Gesichte liegend, mit einer Schusswunde hinter dem rechten
Ohre. Die Kugel war ueber dem linken Auge in Stinknochen stecken
geblieben, nachdem sie das Gehirn durchdrungen hatte. Die
Fundstelle der Leiche befand sich etwa in der Mitte einer weber
einen ziemlich tiefen Fluss f &uuml;hrenden Br&uuml;cke. Am
Schiusse der Lokalerhebungen und als die Leiche eben zur Obduktion
fortgebracht werden sollte, fiel es dem UR. zuf&auml;llig auf dass
das (h&ouml;lzerne und wettergraue) Br&uuml;ckengel&auml;nder an
der Stelle, wo auf dem Boden der Leichnam lag, eine kleine und
sichtlich ganz frische Besch&auml;digung aufwies, so als ob man
dort (am oberen Rande) mit einem harten, kantigen K&ouml;rper
heftig angestossen ware. Der Gedanke, dass dieser Umstand mit dem
Morde in Zusammenhang stehe, war nicht gut von der Hand zu weisen.
Ein Kahn war bald zur Stelle und am Br&uuml;ckenjoche befestige;
nun wurde vom Kahne aus (unter der fraglichen Stelle) der
Flussgrund mit Rechen an langen Stielen sorgf&auml;ltig abgesucht.
Nach kurzer Arbeit kam wirklich etwas Seltsames zutage: eine etwa 4
m lange starke Schnur, an deren einem Ende ein grosser Feldstein,
an deren anderem Ende eine abgeschossene Pistole befestigt war, in
deren Lauf die sp&auml;ter aus dem Kopfe des M. genommene Kugel
genau passte. Nun war die Sache klarer Selbstmord; der Mann hatte
sich mit der aufgefundenen Vorrichtung auf die Br&uuml;cke begeben,
den Stein ueber das Br&uuml;ckengel&auml;nder geh&auml;ngt und sich
die Kugel hinter dem rechten Ohre ins Him gejagt. Als er getroffen
war, liess er die Pistole infolge des durch den Stein bewirkten
Zuges aus und diese wurde von dem schweren Steine an der Schnur
ueber das Gel&auml;nder und in das Wasser gezogen. Hierbei hatte
die Pistole, als sie das Gel&auml;nder passierte, heftig dieses
angeschlagen und die betreffende Verletzung erzeugt."&mdash;Ibid.,
pp. 834-836.) ... Does that answer your question, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath stared at him with gaping eyes.</p>

<p>"You mean her gun went outa the window the same like that guy's
gun went over the bridge?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt about it. There was no other place for
the gun to go. The window, I learned from Sproot, was open a foot,
and Ada stood before the window when she shot herself. Returning
from Julia's room she attached a cord to the revolver with a weight
of some kind on the other end, and hung the weight out of the
window. When her hand released the weapon it was simply drawn over
the sill and disappeared in the drift of soft snow on the balcony
steps. And there is where the importance of the weather came in.
Ada's plan needed an unusual amount of snow; and the night of
November 8th was ideal for her grisly purpose."</p>

<p>"My God, Vance" Markham's tone was strained and unnatural. "This
thing begins to sound more like a fantastic nightmare than a
reality."</p>

<p>"Not only was it a reality, Markham," said Vance gravely, "but
it was an actual duplication of reality. It had all been done
before and duly recorded in Gross's treatise, with names, dates,
and details."</p>

<p>"Hell No wonder we couldn't find the gun." Heath spoke with awed
disgust. "And what about the footprints, Mr. Vance? I suppose she
faked 'em all."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant&mdash;with Gross's minute instructions and the
footprint forgeries of many famous criminals to guide her, she
faked them. As soon as it had stopped snowing that night she
slipped downstairs, put on a pair of Chester's discarded galoshes,
and walked to the front gate and back. Then she hid the galoshes in
the library."</p>

<p>Vance turned once more to Gross's manual.</p>

<p>"There's everything here that one could possibly want to know
about the making and detection of footprints, and&mdash;what is
more to the point&mdash;about the manufacturing of footprints in
shoes too large for one's feet.&mdash;Let me translate a short
passage: 'The criminal may intend to cast suspicion upon another
person, especially if he foresees that suspicion may fall upon
himself. In this case he produces clear footprints which, so to
speak, leap to the eyes, by wearing shoes which differ essentially
from his own. One may often in this way, as has been proved by
numerous experiments, produce footprints which deceive perfectly.'*
(*Die Absicht kann dahin gehen, den Verdacht von sich auf jemand
anderen zu w&auml;lzen, was namentlich dann Sinn hat, wenn der
T&auml;ter schon im voraus annehmen durfte, dass sich der Verdacht
auf ihn lenken werde. In diesem Falle erzeugt er recht auffallende,
deutliche Spuren and zwar mit angezorgenen Schuhen, die von den
seinigen sich wesentlich unterscheiden. Man kann, wie angestellte
Versuche beweisen, in dieser Weise recht gute Spuren
erzeugen."&mdash;Ibid., II, p. 667.) ... And here at the end of the
paragraph, Gross refers specifically to galoshes* (*"Ueber
Gummiueberschuhe and Galoschen s. Loock; Chem. u. Phot. bei Krim.
Forschungen: D&uuml;sseldorf, II, p. 56."&mdash;Ibid., II, p.
668.)&mdash;a fact which very likely gave Ada her inspiration to
use Chester's overshoes. She was shrewd enough to profit by the
suggestions in this passage."</p>

<p>"And she was shrewd enough to hoodwink all of us when we
questioned her," commented Markham bitterly.</p>

<p>"True. But that was because she had a <i>folie de grandeur</i>,
and lived the story. Moreover, it was all based on fact; its
details were grounded in reality. Even the shuffling sound she said
she heard in her room was an imaginative projection of the actual
shuffling sound she made when she walked in Chester's huge
galoshes. Also, her own shuffling, no doubt, suggested to her how
Mrs. Greene's footsteps would have sounded had the old lady
regained the use of her legs. And I imagine it was Ada's original
purpose to cast a certain amount of suspicion on Mrs. Greene from
the very beginning. But Sibella's attitude during that first
interview caused her to change her tactics. As I see it, Sibella
was suspicious of little sister, and talked the situation over with
Chester, who may also have had misgivings about Ada. You remember
his <i>sub-rosa</i> chat with Sibella when he went to summon her to
the drawing-room. He was probably informing her that he hadn't yet
made an accusation against Ada, and was advising her to go easy
until there was some specific proof. Sibella evidently agreed, and
refrained from any direct charge until Ada, in telling her
grotesque fairy-tale about the intruder, rather implied it was a
woman's hand that had touched her in the dark. That was too much
for Sibella, who thought Ada was referring to her; and she burst
forth with her accusation, despite its seeming absurdity. The
amazing thing about it was that it happened to be the truth. She
named the murderer and stated a large part of the motive before any
of us remotely guessed the truth, even though she did back down and
change her mind when the inconsistency of it was pointed out to
her. And she really did see Ada in Chester's room looking for the
revolver."</p>

<p>Markham nodded.</p>

<p>"It's astonishing. But after the accusation, when Ada knew that
Sibella suspected her, why didn't she kill Sibella next?"</p>

<p>"She was too canny. It would have tended to give weight to
Sibella's accusations. Oh, Ada played her hand perfectly."</p>

<p>"Go on with the story, sir," urged Heath, intolerant of these
side issues.</p>

<p>"Very well, Sergeant." Vance shifted more comfortably into his
chair. "But first we must revert to the weather; for the weather
ran like a sinister motif through all that followed. The second
night after Julia's death it was quite warm, and the snow had
melted considerably. That was the night chosen by Ada to retrieve
the gun. A wound like hers rarely keeps one in bed over forty-eight
hours; and Ada was well enough on Wednesday night to slip into a
coat, step out on the balcony, and walk down the few steps to where
the gun lay hidden. She merely brought it back and took it to bed
with her&mdash;the last place anyone would have thought to look for
it. Then she waited patiently for the snow to fall
again&mdash;which it did the next night, stopping, as you may
remember, about eleven o'clock. The stage was set. The second act
of the tragedy was about to begin...</p>

<p>"Ada rose quietly, put on her coat, and went down to the
library. Getting into the galoshes, she again walked to the front
gate and back. Then she went directly upstairs so that her tracks
would show on the marble steps, and hid the galoshes temporarily in
the linen-closet. That was the shuffling sound and the closing door
that Rex heard a few minutes before Chester was shot. Ada, you
recall, told us afterwards she had heard nothing; but when we
repeated Rex's story to her she became frightened and conveniently
remembered having heard a door close. My word! That was a ticklish
moment for her. But she certainly carried it off well. And I can
now understand her obvious relief when we showed her the pattern of
the footprints and let her think we believed the murderer came from
outside... Well, after she had removed the galoshes and put them in
the linen-closet, she took off her coat, donned a dressing-gown,
and went to Chester's room&mdash;probably opened the door without
knocking, and went in with a friendly greeting. I picture her as
sitting on the arm of Chester's chair, or the edge of the desk, and
then, in the midst of some trivial remark, drawing the revolver,
placing it against his breast, and pulling the trigger before he
had time to recover from his horrified astonishment. He moved
instinctively, though, just as the weapon exploded&mdash;which
would account for the diagonal course of the bullet. Then Ada
returned quickly to her own room and got into bed. Thus was another
chapter written in the Greene tragedy."</p>

<p>"Did it strike you as strange," asked Markham, "that Von Blon
was not at his office during the commission of either of the
crimes?"</p>

<p>"At first&mdash;yes. But, after all, there was nothing unusual
in the fact that a doctor should have been out at that time of
night."</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to see how Ada got rid of Julia and Chester,"
grumbled Heath. "But what stops me is how she murdered Rex."</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Sergeant," returned Vance, "that trick of hers
shouldn't cause you any perplexity. I'll never forgive myself for
not having guessed it long ago&mdash;Ada certainly gave us enough
clues to work on. But, before I describe it to you, let me recall a
certain architectural detail of the Greene mansion. There is a
Tudor fire-place, with carved wooden panels, in Ada's room, and
another fire-place&mdash;a duplicate of Ada's in Rex's room; and
these two fire-places are back to back on the same wall. The Greene
house, as you know, is very old, and at some time in the
past&mdash;perhaps when the fire-places were built&mdash;an
aperture was made between the two rooms, running from one of the
panels in Ada's mantel to the corresponding panel in Rex's mantel.
This miniature tunnel is about six inches square&mdash;the exact
size of the panels&mdash;and a little over two feet long, or the
depth of the two mantels and the wall. It was originally used, I
imagine, for private communication between the two rooms. But that
point is immaterial. The fact remains that such a shaft
exists&mdash;I verified it to-night on my way down-town from the
hospital. I might also add that the panel at either end of the
shaft is on a spring hinge, so that when it is opened and released
it closes automatically, snapping back into place without giving
any indication that it is anything more than a solid part of the
woodwork&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I get you!" exclaimed Heath, with the excitement of
satisfaction. "Rex was shot by the old man-killing safe idea: the
burglar opens the safe door and gets a bullet in his head from a
stationary gun."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And the same device has been used in scores of
murders. In the early days out West an enemy would go to a
rancher's cabin during the tenant's absence, hang a shot-gun from
the ceiling over the door, and tie one end of a string to the
trigger and the other end to the latch. When the rancher
returned&mdash;perhaps days later&mdash;his brains would be blown
out as he entered his cabin; and the murderer would, at the time,
be in another part of the country."</p>

<p>"Sure!" The sergeant's eyes sparkled. "There was a shooting like
that in Atlanta two years ago&mdash;Boscomb was the name of the
murdered man. And in Richmond, Va."</p>

<p>"There have been many instances of it, Sergeant. Gross quotes
two famous Austrian cases, and also has something to say about this
method in general."</p>

<p>Again he opened the "Handbuch."</p>

<p>"On page 943 Gross remarks: 'The latest American safety devices
have nothing to do with the safe itself, and can in fact be used
with any receptacle. They act through chemicals or automatic firing
devices, and their object is to make the presence of a human being
who illegally opens the safe impossible on physical grounds. The
judicial question would have to be decided whether one is legally
entitled to kill a burglar without further ado or damage his
health. However, a burglar in Berlin in 1902 was shot through the
forehead by a self-shooter attached to a safe in an exporting
house. This style of self-shooter has also been used by murderers.
A mechanic, G. Z., attached a pistol in a china-closet, fastening
the trigger to the catch, and thus shot his wife when he himself
was in another city. R. C., a merchant of Budapest, secured a
revolver in a humidor belonging to his brother, which, when the lid
was opened, fired and sent a bullet into his brother's abdomen. The
explosion jerked the box from the table, and thus exposed the
mechanism before the merchant had a chance to remove it.'* (*"Die
neuesten amerikanischen Schutzvorrichtungen haben direkt mit der
Kasse selbst nichts zu tun und k&ouml;nnen eigentlich an jedem
Beh&auml;ltnisse angebracht werden. Sie bestchen aus chemischen
Schutzmitteln oder Selbstsch&uuml;ssen und wollen die Anwesenheit
eines Menschen, der den Schrank unbefugt ge&ouml;ffnet hat, aus
sanit&auml;ren oder sonst physischen Gr&uuml;nden unm&ouml;glich
machen. Auch die juristische Seite der Frage ist zu erw&auml;gen,
da man den Einbrecher doch nicht ohne weiteres t&ouml;ten oder an
der Gesundheit sch&auml;digen darf. Nichtsdestoweniger wurde in
Jahre 1902 ein Einbrucher in Berlin durch einen solchen
Selbstschuss in die Stirne getoetet, der an die Panzertuere einer
Kasse befestigt war. Derartige Selbstschuesse wurden such zu Morden
verwendet; der Mechaniker G. Z. stellte einen Revolver in einer
Kredenz auf, verband den Druecker mit der Tuere durch einer Schnur
und erschoss auf diese Art seine Frau, waehrend er tatsaechlich von
seinem Wornorte abwesend war. R. C. ein Budapester Kaufmann
befestigte in einem, seinem Bruder gehoerigen Cigarrenkasten, eine
Pistole, die helm Oeffnen des Deckels seinen Bruder durch einen
Unterleibsschuss toetlich verletzte. Der Rueckschlag warf die Kiste
von ihrem Standort, sodass der Moerdermechanismus zu Tage trat, ehe
R. C. denselben bei Seite schaffen konnte."-Ibid., II, p. 943.) ...
In both these latter cases Gross gives a detailed description of
the mechanisms employed. And it will interest you,
Sergeant&mdash;in view of what I am about to tell you&mdash;to know
that the revolver in the china-closet was held in place by a
<i>Stiefelknecht</i>, or bootjack."</p>

<p>He closed the volume, but held it on his lap.</p>

<p>"There, unquestionably, is where Ada got the suggestion for
Rex's murder. She and Rex had probably discovered the hidden
passage-way between their rooms years ago. I imagine that as
children&mdash;they were about the same age, don't y'
know&mdash;they used it as a secret means of correspondence. This
would account for the name by which they both knew it&mdash;'our
private mailbox.' And, given this knowledge between Ada and Rex,
the method of the murder becomes perfectly clear. To-night I found
an old-fashioned boot-jack in Ada's clothes-closet&mdash;probably
taken from Tobias's library. Its width, over-all, was just six
inches, and it was a little less than two feet long&mdash;it fitted
perfectly into the communicating cupboard. Ada, following Gross's
diagram, pressed the handle of the gun tightly between the tapering
claws of the bootjack, which would have held it like a vice; then
tied a string to the trigger, and attached the other end to the
inside of Rex's panel, so that when the panel was opened wide the
revolver, being on a hair trigger, would discharge straight along
the shaft and inevitably kill anyone looking into the opening. When
Rex fell with a bullet in his forehead the panel flapped back into
place on its spring hinge; and a second later there was no visible
evidence whatever pointing to the origin of the shot. And here we
also have the explanation for Rex's calm expression of unawareness.
When Ada returned with us from the District Attorney's office, she
went directly to her room, removed the gun and the bootjack, hid
them in her closet, and came down to the drawing-room to report the
foot-tracks on her carpet&mdash;foot-tracks she herself had made
before leaving the house. It was just before she came downstairs,
by the way, that she stole the morphine and strychnine from Von
Blon's case."</p>

<p>"But, my God, Vance!" said Markham. "Suppose her mechanism had
failed to work. She would have been in for it then."</p>

<p>"I hardly think so. If, by any remote chance, the trap had not
operated or Rex had recovered, she could easily have put the blame
on someone else. She had merely to say she had secreted the diagram
in the chute and that this other person had prepared the trap later
on. There would have been no proof of her having set the gun."</p>

<p>"What about that diagram, sir?" asked Heath.</p>

<p>For answer Vance again took up the second volume of Gross and,
opening it, extended it toward us. On the right-hand page were a
number of curious line-drawings.</p>

<p>"There are the three stones, and the parrot, and the heart, and
even your arrow, Sergeant. They're all criminal graphic symbols;
and Ada simply utilized them in her description. The story of her
finding the paper in the hall was a pure fabrication, but she knew
it would pique our curiosity. The truth is, I suspected the paper
of being faked by someone, for it evidently contained the signs of
several types of criminal, and the symbols were meaninglessly
jumbled. I rather imagined it was a false clue deliberately placed
in the hall for us to find&mdash;like the footprints; but I
certainly didn't suspect Ada of having made up the tale. Now,
however, as I look back at the episode it strikes me as deuced
queer that she shouldn't have brought so apparently significant a
paper to the office. Her failure to do so was neither logical nor
reasonable; and I ought to have been suspicious. But&mdash;my
word!&mdash;what was one illogical item more or less in such a
<i>m&eacute;lange</i> of inconsistencies? As it happened, her decoy
worked beautifully, and gave her the opportunity to telephone Rex
to look into the chute. But it didn't really matter. If the scheme
had fallen through that morning, it would have been successful
later on. Ada was highly persevering."</p>

<p>"You think, then," put in Markham, "that Rex really heard the
shot in Ada's room that first night, and confided in her?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. That part of her story was true enough. I'm
inclined to think that Rex heard the shot and had a vague idea Mrs.
Greene had fired it. Being rather close to his mother
temperamentally, he said nothing. Later he voiced his suspicions to
Ada; and that confession gave her the idea for killing
him&mdash;or, rather, for perfecting the technique she had already
decided on; for Rex would have been shot through the secret
cupboard in any event. But Ada now saw a way of establishing a
perfect alibi for the occasion; although even her idea of being
actually with the police when the shot was fired was not original.
In Gross's chapter on alibis there is much suggestive material
along that line."</p>

<p>Heath sucked his teeth wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't run across many of her kind," he remarked.</p>

<p>"She was her father's daughter," said Vance. "But too much
credit should not be given to her, Sergeant. She had a printed and
diagrammed guide for everything. There was little for her to do but
follow instructions and keep her head. And as for Rex's murder,
don't forget that, although she was actually in Mr. Markham's
office at the time of the shooting, she personally engineered the
entire <i>coup</i>. Think back. She refused to let either you or
Mr. Markham come to the house, and insisted upon visiting the
office. Once there, she told her story and suggested that Rex be
summoned immediately. She even went so far as to plead with us to
call him by phone. Then, when we had complied, she quickly informed
us of the mysterious diagram, and offered to tell Rex exactly where
she had hidden it, so he could bring it with him. And we sat there
calmly, listening to her send Rex to his death! Her actions at the
Stock Exchange should have given me a hint; but I confess I was
particularly blind that morning. She was in a state of high nervous
excitement; and when she broke down and sobbed on Mr. Markham's
desk after he had told her of Rex's death, her tears were quite
real&mdash;only, they were not for Rex; they were the reaction from
that hour of terrific tension."</p>

<p>"I begin to understand why no one upstairs heard the shot," said
Markham. "The revolver detonating in the wall, as it were, would
have been almost completely muffled, But why should Sproot have
heard it so distinctly downstairs?"</p>

<p>"You remember there was a fire-place in the living-room directly
beneath Ada's&mdash;Chester once told us it was rarely lighted
because it wouldn't draw properly&mdash;and Sproot was in the
butler's pantry just beyond. The sound of the report went downward
through the flue and, as a result, was heard plainly on the lower
floor."</p>

<p>"You said a minute ago, Mr. Vance," argued Heath, "that Rex
maybe suspected the old lady. Then why should he have accused Von
Blon the way he did that day he had a fit?"</p>

<p>"The accusation primarily, I think, was a sort of instinctive
effort to drive the idea of Mrs. Greene's guilt from his own mind.
Then, again, as Von Blon explained, Rex was frightened after you
had questioned him about the revolver, and wanted to divert
suspicion from himself."</p>

<p>"Get on with the story of Ada's plot, Vance." This time it was
Markham who was impatient.</p>

<p>"The rest seems pretty obvious, don't y' know. It was
unquestionably Ada who was listening at the library door the
afternoon we were there. She realized we had found the books and
galoshes; and she had to think fast. So, when we came out, she told
us the dramatic yarn of having seen her mother walking, which was
sheer moonshine. She had run across those books on paralysis, d' ye
see, and they had suggested to her the possibility of focusing
suspicion on Mrs. Greene&mdash;the chief object of her hate. It is
probably true, as Von Blon said, that the two books do not deal
with actual hysterical paralysis and somnambulism, but they no
doubt contain references to these types of paralysis. I rather
think Ada had intended all along to kill the old lady last and have
it appear as the suicide of the murderer. But the proposed
examination by Oppenheimer changed all that. She learned of the
examination when she heard Von Blon apprise Mrs. Greene of it on
his morning visit; and, having told us of that mythical midnight
promenade, she couldn't delay matters any longer. The old lady had
to die&mdash;<i>before Oppenheimer arrived</i>. And half an hour
later Ada took the morphine. She feared to give Mrs. Greene the
strychnine at once lest it appear suspicious..."</p>

<p>"That's where those books on poisons come in, isn't it, Mr.
Vance?" interjected Heath. "When Ada had decided to use poison on
some of the family, she got all the dope she needed on the subject
outa the library."</p>

<p>"Precisely. She herself took just enough morphine to render her
unconscious-probably about two grains. And to make sure she would
get immediate assistance she devised the simple trick of having
Sibella's dog appear to give the alarm. Incidentally, this trick
cast suspicion on Sibella. After Ada had swallowed the morphine,
she merely waited until she began to feel drowsy, pulled the
bell-cord, caught the tassel in the dog's teeth, and lay back. She
counterfeited a good deal of her illness; but Drumm couldn't have
detected her malingering even if he had been as great a doctor as
he wanted us to believe; for the symptoms for all doses of morphine
taken by mouth are practically the same during the first half-hour.
And, once she was on her feet, she had only to watch for an
opportunity of giving the strychnine to Mrs. Greene..."</p>

<p>"It all seems too cold-blooded to be real," murmured
Markham.</p>

<p>"And yet there has been any number of precedents for Ada's
actions. Do you recall the mass murders of those three nurses,
Madame Jegado, Frau Zwanzigger, and Vrouw Van der Linden? And there
was Mrs. Belle Gunness, the female Bluebeard; and Amelia Elizabeth
Dyer, the Reading baby-farmer; and Mrs. Pearcey. Cold-blooded? Yes!
But in Ada's case there was passion too. I'm inclined to believe
that it takes a particularly hot flame&mdash;a fire at white heat,
in fact&mdash;to carry the human heart through such a Gethsemane.
However that may be, Ada watched for her chance to poison Mrs.
Greene, and found it that night. The nurse went to the third floor
to prepare for bed between eleven and eleven-thirty; and during
that half-hour Ada visited her mother's room. Whether she suggested
the citro- carbonate or Mrs. Greene herself asked for it, we'll
never know. Probably the former, for Ada had always given it to her
at night. When the nurse came downstairs again Ada was already back
in bed, apparently asleep, and Mrs. Greene was on the verge of her
first&mdash;and, let us hope, her only&mdash;convulsion."</p>

<p>"Doremus's <i>post-mortem</i> report must have given her a
terrific shock," commented Markham.</p>

<p>"It did. It upset all her calculations. Imagine her feelings
when we informed her that Mrs. Greene couldn't have walked! She
backed out of the danger nicely, though. The detail of the Oriental
shawl, however, nearly entangled her. But even that point she
turned to her own advantage by using it as a clue against
Sibella."</p>

<p>"How do you account for Mrs. Mannheim's actions during that
interview?" asked Markham. "You remember her saying it might have
been she whom Ada saw in the hall."</p>

<p>A cloud came over Vance's face.</p>

<p>"I think," he said sadly, "that Frau Mannheim began to suspect
her little Ada at that point. She knew the terrible history of the
girl's father, and perhaps had lived in fear of some criminal
outcropping in the child."</p>

<p>There was a silence for several moments. Each of us was busy
with his own thoughts. Then Vance continued:</p>

<p>"After Mrs. Greene's death, only Sibella stood between Ada and
her blazing goal; and it was Sibella herself who gave her the idea
for a supposedly safe way to commit the final murder. Weeks ago, on
a ride Van and I took with the two girls and Von Blon, Sibella's
venomous pique led her to make a foolish remark about running one's
victim over a precipice in a machine; and it no doubt appealed to
Ada's sense of the fitness of things that Sibella should thus
suggest the means of her own demise. I wouldn't be at all surprised
if Ada intended, after having killed her sister, to say that
Sibella had tried to murder <i>her</i>, but that she had suspected
the other's purpose and jumped from the car in time to save
herself; and that Sibella had miscalculated the car's speed and
been carried over the precipice. The fact that Von Blon and Van and
I had heard Sibella speculate on just such a method of murder would
have given weight to Ada's story. And what a neat ending it would
have made&mdash; Sibella, the murderer, dead; the case closed; Ada,
the inheritor of the Greene millions, free to do as she chose!
And&mdash;'pon my soul, Markham!&mdash;it came very near
succeeding."</p>

<p>Vance sighed, and reached for the decanter. After refilling our
glasses, he settled back and smoked moodily.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long this terrible plot had been in preparation.
We'll never know. Maybe years. There was no haste in Ada's
preparations. Everything was worked out carefully; and she let
circumstances&mdash;or, rather, opportunity&mdash;guide her. Once
she had secured the revolver, it was only a question of waiting for
a chance when she could make the footprints and be sure the gun
would sink out of sight in the snow-drift on the balcony steps.
Yes, the most essential condition of her scheme was the snow!
...Amazin'!"</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>There is little more to add to this record. The truth was not
given out, and the case was "shelved." The following year Tobias's
will was upset by the Supreme Court in Equity&mdash;that is, the
twenty-five-year domiciliary clause was abrogated in view of all
that had happened at the house; and Sibella came into the entire
Greene fortune. How much Markham had to do with the decision,
through his influence with the Administration judge who rendered
it, I don't know; and naturally I have never asked. But the old
Greene mansion was, as you remember, torn down shortly afterward,
and the estate sold to a realty corporation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mannheim, broken-hearted over Ada's death, claimed her
inheritance&mdash;which Sibella generously doubled&mdash;and
returned to Germany to seek what comfort she might among the nieces
and nephews with whom, according to Chester, she was constantly
corresponding. Sproot went back to England. He told Vance before
departing that he had long planned a cottage retreat in Surrey
where he could loaf and invite his soul. I picture him now, sitting
in an ivied porch overlooking Kew Gardens, reading his beloved
Martial.</p>

<p>Doctor and Mrs. Von Blon, immediately after the court's decision
relating to the will, sailed for the Riviera and spent a year's
belated honeymoon there. They are now settled in Vienna, where the
doctor has become a <i>Docent</i> at the University&mdash;his
father's Alma Mater. He is, I understand, making quite a name for
himself in the field of neurology.</p>

<p>One domestic item may be appended. Several months ago a friend
of mine, returning from Vienna, brought me the news that Sibella
had given birth to a son and heir. The fact, I admit, struck me as
somewhat incongruous. It is difficult for me to picture Sibella in
the r&ocirc;le of mother. But, as one of our leading sociologists
recently assured us, the modern girl harbours beneath her callous
and highly sophisticated exterior an intense, age-old maternalism.
"Indeed," added this eminent sociologist, "the modern girls make
the best mothers." Let us sincerely hope that Sibella will confirm
his generous optimism.</p>
