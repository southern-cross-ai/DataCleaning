AFFECTIONS OF A FATHER.</blockquote>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>The work which follows is submitted with great deference and some
doubt to the reader. It is an experiment; and the style and spirit
are, it is believed, something out of the beaten track. The events
are of real occurrence, and, to the judgment of the author, the
peculiarities of character which he has here drawn--if they may be
considered such, which are somewhat too common to human society--are
genuine and unexaggerated. The design of the work is purely moral,
and the lessons sought to be inculcated are of universal application
and importance. They go to impress upon us the necessity of proper
and early education--they show the ready facility with which the best
natural powers may be perverted to the worst purposes--they stimulate
to honorable deeds in the young,--teach firmness under defeat and
vicissitude, and hold forth a promise of ultimate and complete
success to well directed perseverance. By exhibiting, at the same
time, the injurious consequences directly flowing from each and every
aberration from the standard of a scrupulous morality, they enjoin
the strictest and most jealous conscientiousness. The character of
Martin Faber, not less than that of William Harding, may be found
hourly in real life. The close observer may often meet with them.
They are here put in direct opposition, not less with the view to
contrast and comparison, than incident and interest. They will be
found to develope, of themselves, and by their results, the nature of
the education which had been severally given them. When the author
speaks of education he does not so much refer to that received at the
school and the academy. He would be understood to indicate that which
the young acquire at home in the parental dwelling--under the
parental eye--in the domestic circle--at the family fireside, from
those who, by nature, are best calculated to lay the guiding and the
governing principles. It is not at the university that the affections
and the moral faculties are to be tutored. The heart, and--les
petites morales--the manners, have quite another school and other
teachers, all of which are but too little considered by the guardians
of the young. These are--the father and the mother and the
friends--the play-mates and the play-places.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>This is a fearful precipice, but I dare look upon it. What,
indeed, may I not dare--what have I not dared! I look before me, and
the prospect, to most men full of terrors, has few or none for me.
Without adopting too greatly the spirit of cant which makes it a
familiar phrase in the mouths of the many, death to me will prove a
release from many strifes and terrors. I do not fear death. I look
behind me, and though I may regret my crimes, they give me no
compunctious apprehensions. They were among the occurrences known to,
and a necessary sequence in the progress of time and the world's
circumstance. They might have been committed by another as well as by
myself. They must have been committed! I was but an instrument in the
hands of a power with which I could not contend.</p>

<p>Yet, what a prospect, does this backward glance afford! How full
of colors and characters--How variously dark and bright. I am dazzled
and confounded at the various phases of my own life. I wonder at the
prodigious strides which my own feet have taken--and as I live and
must die, I am bold to declare,--in half the number of instances,
without my own consciousness. Should I be considered the criminal, in
deeds so committed? Had not my arm been impelled--had not my mood
been prompted by powers and an agency apart from my own, I had not
struck the blow. The demon was not of me, though presiding over, and
prevailing within, me. Let those who may think, when the blood is
boiling in their temples, analyze its throbs and the source of its
impulses. I cannot. I am a fatalist. Enough for me that it was
written!</p>

<p>My name is Martin Faber. I am of good family--of German
extraction--the only son. I was born in M--village, and my parents
were recognized as among the first in respectability and fortune of
the place. The village was small--numbering some sixty families; and
with a naturally strong and shrewd, and a somewhat improved mind, my
father, Nicholas Faber, became the first man in it. The village of
M--was one of those that always keep stationary. The prospect was
slight, therefore, of our family declining in influence. My father,
on the contrary, grew every day stronger in the estimation of the
people. He was their oracle--their counsellor--his word was law, and
there were no rival pretensions set up in opposition to his
supremacy. Would this had been less the case! Had Nicholas Faber been
more his own, than the creature of others, Martin, his son, had not
now obliterated all the good impressions of his family, and been
called upon, not only to recount his disgrace and crime, but to pay
its penalties. Had he bestowed more of his time in the regulation of
his household, and less upon public affairs, the numberless vicious
propensities, strikingly marked in me from childhood up, had, most
probably been sufficiently restrained. But why speak of this? As I
have already said--it was written!</p>

<p>The only child, I was necessarily a favorite. The pet of mama, the
prodigy of papa, I was schooled to dogmatize and do as I pleased from
my earlier infancy. I grew apace, but in compliance with maternal
tenderness, which dreaded the too soon exposure of her child's
nerves, health and sensibilities, I was withheld from school for
sometime after other children are usually put in charge of a tutor.
When sent, the case was not very greatly amended. I learned nothing,
or what I learned was entirely obliterated by the nature of my
education and treatment at home. I cared little to learn, and my
tutor dared not coerce me. His name was Michael Andrews. He was a
poor, miserable hireling, who having a large and depending family,
dared not offend by the chastisement of the favorite son of a person
of so much consequence as my father. Whatever I said or did,
therefore, went by without notice, and with the most perfect
impunity. I was a truant, and exulted in my irregularities, without
the fear or prospect of punishment. I was brutal and boorish--savage
and licentious. To inferiors I was wantonly cruel. In my connexion
with superiors, I was cunning and hypocritical. If, wanting in
physical strength, I dared not break ground and go to blows with my
opponent, I, nevertheless, yielded not, except in appearance. I
waited for my time, and seldom permitted the opportunity to escape,
in which I could revenge myself with tenfold interest, for
provocation or injustice. Nor did I discriminate between those to
whom this conduct was exhibited. To all alike, I carried the same
countenance. To the servant, the schoolmaster, the citizen, and even
to my parents, I was rude and insolent. My defiance was ready for
them all, and when, as sometimes, even at the most early stages of
childhood, I passed beyond those bounds of toleration, assigned to my
conduct, tacitly, as it were, by my father and mother, my only rebuke
was in some such miserably unmeaning language as this--'Now, my
dear--now Martin--how can you be so bad'--or, 'I will be vexed with
you, Martin, if you go on so.'</p>

<p>What was such a rebuke to an overgrown boy, to whom continued and
most unvarying deference, on all hands, had given the most
extravagant idea of his own importance. I bade defiance to threats--I
laughed at and scorned reproaches. I ridiculed the soothings and the
entreaties of my mother; and her gifts and toys and favors, furnished
in order to tempt me to the habits which she had not the courage to
compel, were only received as things of course, which it was her duty
to give me. My father, whose natural good sense, sometimes made him
turn an eye of misgiving upon my practices, wanted the stern sense of
duty which would probably have brought about a different habit; and
when, as was occasionally the case, his words were harsh and his look
austere, I went, muttering curses, from his presence, and howling
back my defiance for his threats. I was thus brought up without a
sense of propriety--without a feeling of fear. I had no respect for
authority--no regard for morals. I was a brute from education, and
whether nature did or not, contribute to the moral constitution of
the creature which I now appear, certain, I am, that the course of
tutorship which I received from all around me, would have made me so.
You will argue from this against my notion of the destinies, since I
admit, impliedly, that a different course of education, would have
brought about different results. I think not. The case is still the
same. I was fated to be so tutored.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>There was at the school to which I went, a boy about twelve, the
same age with myself. His name was William Harding--he was the only
child of a widow lady, living a retired life--of blameless character,
and a disposition the most amiable and shrinking. This disposition
was inherited by her son, in the most extravagant degree. He had been
the child of affliction. His father had been murdered in a night
affray in a neighbouring city, and his body had been brought home to
the house and presence of his lady, when she was far advanced in
pregnancy. The sudden and terrible character of the shock brought on
the pains of labour. Her life was saved with difficulty, and,
seemingly by miraculous interposition, the life of her infant was
also preserved. But he was the creature of the deepest sensibility.
His nervous organization was peculiarly susceptible. He was affected
by circumstances the most trifling and casual--trembled and shrunk
from every unwonted breeze--withered beneath reproach, and pined
under neglect. So marked a character, presenting too, as it did, a
contrast, so strikingly with my own, attracted my attention, at an
early period of our school association. His dependence, his weakness,
his terrors--all made him an object of a consideration which no other
character would have provoked. I loved him--strange to say--and with
a feeling of singular power. I fought his battles--I never permitted
him to be imposed upon:--and he--could he do less?--he assisted me in
my lessons, he worked my sums, he helped my understanding in its
deficiencies, he reproved my improprieties--and I--I bore with and
submitted patiently on most occasions to his reproofs. William
Harding was a genius, and one of the first order; but his nervous
susceptibilities left him perfectly hopeless and helpless. Collision
with the world of man would have destroyed him; and, as it was, the
excess of the imaginative quality which seemed to keep even pace with
his sensibilities, left him continually struggling--and as
continually to the injury and overthrow of the latter--with the calm
suggestions of his judgment. He was a creature to be loved and
pitied; and without entertaining, at this period, a single sentiment
savoring of either of these, for any other existing being, I both
loved and pitied him.</p>

<p>One day, to the surprize of all, William Harding appeared in his
class, perfectly ignorant of his lesson. The master did not punish
him with stripes, but, as the school was about to be dismissed,
commanding the trembling boy before him, he hung about his neck a
badge made of card, on which was conspicuously printed, the word
'idler.'--With this badge he was required to return home,
re-appearing at school with it the ensuing afternoon.</p>

<p>A more bitter disgrace could not, by any ingenuity, have been put
upon the proud and delicate spirit of this ambitious boy. I never saw
dismay more perfectly depicted upon any countenance. His spirit did
not permit him to implore. But his eye--it spoke volumes of
appeal--it was full of entreaty. The old man saw it not. The school
was dismissed, and, in a paroxysm of grief which seemed to prostrate
every faculty, my companion threw himself upon the long grass in the
neighbourhood of the school-house, and refused to be comforted. I
sought him out, and curious to know the cause of an omission which in
him was remarkable, and should therefore have been overlooked by our
tutor, I enquired of him the reason. The cruelty of his punishment
was now more than ever, apparent to my eyes. His mother had been ill
during the whole previous night, and he had been keeping watch and
attending upon her. I was indignant, and urged him to throw aside the
card beneath the trees, and resume it upon his return to the school.
But he would not descend to the meanness of such an act, and
resolutely determined to bear his punishment. I was of a different
temper. Grown bold and confident by the frequent indulgencies which
had so often sanctioned my own aberrations, I had already assumed the
burdens of my comrades, escaping myself, while effecting their
escape. Should I now hesitate, when a sense of justice, and a feeling
of friendly sympathy coalesced towards the same end, both calling
upon me for action. I did not. I seized upon the accursed tablet. I
tore it from his bosom, and hacking it to pieces of the smallest
dimensions, I hurled them to the winds, declaring, at the same time,
his freedom, with a shout. He would have resisted, and honestly and
earnestly endeavored to prevent the commission of the act. But in
vain, and with a feeling of the truest satisfaction, I beheld him
return home to his suffering parent. But my turn was to come. I had
no fears for the consequence, having been accustomed to violate the
rules of school, with impunity. Harding appearing without his badge,
was questioned, and firmly refused to answer. I boldly pronounced my
handiwork, no one else venturing to speak, fearing my vengeance,
though several in the school, had been cognizant of the whole affair.
At the usual hour of dismissal, I was instructed to remain, and when
all had departed, I was taken by the master, into a small adjoining
apartment, in which he usually studied and kept his books, and which
formed the passage way from his school-room to his dwelling-house.
Here I was conducted, and wondering and curious, at these
preliminaries, here I awaited his presence. I had been guilty of
insubordination and insurrection, and was not altogether sure that he
would not proceed to flog me. But not so. He spoke to me like a
father--as my father had never spoken to me--his words were those of
monitorial kindness and regard. He described the evil consequences to
his authority if such conduct were tolerated; and contented himself
with requiring from me a promise of apology before the assembled
school on the ensuing morning. I laughed in his face. He was
indignant, as well he might be, and, under the momentary impulse, he
gave me a smart blow with his open hand upon my cheek. I was but a
boy--some thirteen or fourteen years of age,--but, at that moment, I
measured with my eye the entire man before me, and though swelling
with fury, coolly calculated the chances of success in a physical
struggle. Had there been a stick or weapon, of any description at
hand, I might not have hesitated. As it was, however, prudence came
to my counsel. I submitted, though my heart rankled, and my spirit
burned within me for revenge;--and I had it--years afterwards I had
it--a deep, a dreadful revenge. For the time, however, I contented
myself with one more congenial with the little spirit of a bad and
brutal boy. In school-boy phrase, he kept me in--he took from me my
freedom, locking me up safely in the little study, into which I had
been conducted.</p>

<p>While in that room shut up, what were my emotions! The spirit of a
demon was working within me, and the passions acting upon my spirit
nearly exhausted my body. I threw myself upon the floor, and
wept--hot, scalding and bitter tears. I stamped, I raved, I swore. On
a sudden I heard the voice of Harding mournfully addressing me
through the partition which separated the school room from my
dungeon. He had come to sympathize, and, if possible, to assist me.
But I would not know--I would not hear him. The gloomy frend was
uppermost, and I suddenly became silent. I would not answer his
inquiries--I was dumb to all his friendly appeals. In vain did the
affectionate boy try every mode of winning me to hear and to reply. I
was stubborn, and, at length, as the dusk came on, I could hear his
departing footsteps, as he had slowly and sorrowfully given up his
object in despair. He was gone, and I rose from the floor, upon which
I had thrown myself. The first paroxysms of my anger had gone off,
and their subdued expression gave me an opportunity more deeply to
investigate my injuries, and meditate my revenge. I strode up and
down the apartment for sometime, when, all of a sudden, I beheld the
two large, new and beautiful globes, which my teacher had but a
little while before purchased at a large price, and not without great
difficulty, from his little savings. He was a philosopher, and this
study was one of his greatest delights. My revenge stood embodied
before me. I felt that I too could now administer pain and
punishment. Though small in proportion to what, it appeared to me, my
wrongs required, I well knew that to injure his globes, would be
almost the severest injury I could inflict upon their owner. I did
not pause--the demon was impatient. I seized the jug of ink that
stood upon the shelf below them, and carefully poured its contents
upon the beautifully varnished and colored outlines of the celestial
regions. They were ruined--irreparably ruined; and where the ink, in
its course, had failed to obliterate the figures, I took care that
the omission should be amended by employing a feather, still further
to complete their destruction. This, you may say, is quite too
trifling an incident for record. No such thing. "The child's the
parent of the man." In one sense, the life of the child is made up of
trifles; but the exercises of his juvenile years will at all times
indicate what they will be when he becomes old. The same passions
which prompted the act just narrated, would move the grown incendiary
to the firing of his neighbor's dwelling. The same passions prompted
me in after years to exaggerated offences. How could it be otherwise?
They were my fate!</p>

<p>Vainly would I endeavor to describe the rage, the agony of wrath,
which came over the face of my tutor upon discovering what I had
done. It is fresh in my memory, as if the occurrence had taken place
but yesterday. I was in the study, where he had left me, upon his
return. Indeed, I could not effect my escape, or I had certainly done
so. The room was dark, and for some time, walking to and fro, and
exhorting me in the most parental manner as he walked, he failed to
perceive his globes or the injury they had sustained. In this way, he
went on, speaking to me, in a way, which, had not my spirit been
acted on by the arch enemy of man, must have had the effect of
compelling me to acknowledge and to atone, by the only mode in my
power, for my errors and misconduct. I had, indeed, begun to be
touched. I felt a disposition to regret my act, and almost inclined
to submission and apology. But on a sudden, he paused--the globes
caught his eye--he approached and inspected them narrowly. Passing
his hands over his eyes, he seemed to doubt the correctness of his
vision; but when he ascertained, for a truth, the extent of the evil,
tears actually started from the decaying orbs, and rolled as freely
as from the eyes of childhood, down his lean and wrinkled face. Then
was my triumph. I gloated in his suffering, and, actually, under the
most involuntary impulse, I approached, and keenly watched his
suffering. He beheld my approach--he saw the demon look of exultation
which I wore; and human passion triumphed. He turned shortly upon me,
and with a severe blow of his fist, he smote me to the ground. I was
half stunned, but soon recovered, and with a degree of
unconsciousness, perfectly brutish, I rushed upon him. But he was too
much for me. He held me firmly with one hand, and, his anger now more
fully provoked by my attack, he inflicted upon me a very severe
flogging--almost the only one which I had ever received. It was
certainly most richly deserved; but I thought not so then. I looked
upon myself as the victim of a most unjustifiable--a most wanton
persecution. I did not, for a moment, consider the vast robbery I had
made from that poor old man's small stock of happiness and enjoyment.
My feelings were all concentrated in self; and my ideas of justice,
where my own interests or emotions were concerned, were in no degree
abstract. I knew but one being in the world, whose claims were to be
considered, and that individual, was, of course, myself.</p>

<p>I was now dismissed, and sore and smarting in body and mind, I
returned to my home. I showed my bruises; I fabricated a story of
greater wrongs and injuries. I dwelt upon the unprovoked aggression;
taking care to suppress all particulars which might have modified the
offence of my teacher. The flogging he had given me, had been a most
severe one--and, the cause not being heard, would seem to have been
most brutal. This was another part of my revenge, and it had its
consequences. A solemn convocation of the chief men of the village,
of whom my father was the dictator, incensed at the indignity, as it
met their senses, and relying upon my ex parte representation,
determined, without further hearing, upon the offence. Michael
Andrews lost his school with every circumstance of ignominy; and in a
most pitiable condition of poverty, in a few weeks, was compelled to
leave the place. I was yet unsatisfied--my revenge was not altogether
complete--boy as I was--unless I could actually survey it. I went to
see him depart. I watched him, as in a miserable wagon, containing
all his household gear, he drove into the adjacent country, attended
by a wife and four young children. I exulted in the prospect; as,
from a little hillock which overlooked the road they were compelled
to travel, I looked down upon their departure. They beheld me, and
the faces of all were immediately turned away. There is a dignified
something in decent sorrow, and suffering borne in silence, which
places it above, while it forbids anything like the spoken taunt or
triumph;--I had otherwise shouted my cry of victory in their ears. As
it was, they proceeded on their way into the country. I was, at
length, satisfied with my revenge, and did not care to follow
them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Under the direction of a more supple tutor than the first, I
finished my education, if so we may call it. William Harding was
still my associate. He was still the same nervous, susceptible,
gentle youth; and though, as he grew older, the more yielding points
of his character became modified in his associations with society, he
nevertheless did not vary in his mental and moral make, from what I
have already described him. Though disapproving of many of my habits
and propensities, and continually exhorting me upon them, he yet felt
the compliment which my spirit, involuntarily, as it were, rendered
to his; and he was not at any time averse to the association which I
tendered him. Still he was like me in few respects, if any. It is the
somewhat popular notion that sympathy in pursuit, and opinions and
sentiments in common, bring about the connexions of friendship and
love. I think differently. Such connexions spring from a thousand
causes which have no origin in mutual sympathies. The true source of
the relationship is the dependence and weakness on the one hand--the
strength and protection on the other. This, I verily believe, was the
fact in our case.</p>

<p>With little other society than that of William Harding, years
glided away, and if they brought little improvement to my moral
attributes--they, at least, bringing no provocation, left in abeyance
and dormancy, many of those which were decidedly immoral. My physical
man was decidedly improved in their progress. My features underwent
considerable change for the better--my manners were far less
objectionable--I had suppressed the more rude and brutal features,
and, mingling more with society--that particularly of the other
sex--I had seen and obeyed the necessity of a gentlemanly demeanor.
But my heart occupied the same place and character--there was no
change in that region. There, all was stubborness and selfishness--a
scorn for the possessions and claims of others--a resolute and
persevering impulse which perpetually sought to exercise and elevate
its own. The spell of my fate was upon it--it seemed seared and
soured--and while it blighted, and sought to blight the fortunes and
the feelings of others, without any sympathy, it seemed nevertheless,
invariably, to partake of the blight. In this respect, in the
vexation of my spirit at this strange inconsistency of character, I
used to curse myself, that I was not like the serpent--that I could
not envenom my enemy, without infecting my own system, with the
poison meant only for his. To this mood, the want of employment gave
activity if not exercise and exhibition. The secretions of my
malignity, having no object of development, jaundiced my whole moral
existence; and a general hostility to human nature and the things of
society, at this stage of my being, vented itself in idle curses, and
bitter but futile denunciations. I lived only in the night time--my
life has been a long night, in which there has been no starlight--in
which there have been many tempests. Talk not of Greenland darkness,
or Norwegian ice. The moral darkness is the most solid--and what cold
is there like that, where, walled in a black dungeon of hates and
fears and sleepless hostility, the heart broods in bitterness and
solitude, over its own cankering and malignant purposes.</p>

<p>Many years had now elapsed since my adventure with Michael
Andrews, my old school-master. I had grown up to manhood, and my
personal appearance, had been so completely changed by the forming
hand of time, that I had not the same looks which distinguished me at
that period. One morning, pursuing a favorite amusement, I had
wandered with my gun for some distance, into a part of the country,
which was almost entirely unknown to me. The game, though plentiful,
was rather shy, and in its pursuit, I was easily seduced to a greater
distance from our village, and on the opposite side of a stream,
which though not a river, was yet sufficiently large, particularly
when swollen by freshets,--a not unfrequent event--to make something
like a barrier and dividing line between two divisions of the
country. The day was fine, and without being at all conscious of the
extent of my wanderings, I proceeded some fourteen or fifteen miles.
My way led through a close and umbrageous forest. A grove of dwarf or
scrub oaks, woven about with thick vines and sheltering foliage, gave
a delightful air of quietness to the scene, which could not fail
altogether in its effect on a spirit as discontented and querulous
even as mine. Wandering from place to place in the silent and
seemingly sacred haunt of the dreamy nature, I perceived, for the
first time, a clear and beautifully winding creek, that stole in and
out, half sheltered by the shrubbery growing thickly about it--now
narrowing into a thin stream, and almost lost among the leaves, and
now spreading itself out in all the rippling and glassy beauty of a
sylvan and secluded lake. I was won with its charms, and pursued it
in all its bendings. The whole scene was unique in loveliness. The
hum of the unquiet breeze, now resting among, and now flying from the
slowly waving branches above, alone broke, at intervals, the solemn
and mysterious repose of that silence, which here seemed to have
taken up its exclusive abode. Upon a bank that jutted so far into the
lake by a winding approach, as almost to seem an island, the trees
had been taught to form themselves into a bower; while the grass,
neatly trimmed within the enclosure, indicated the exercise of that
art, whose hand has given life to the rock, and beauty to the
wilderness. I was naturally attracted by the prospect, and
approaching it from the point most sheltered, came suddenly into the
presence of a tall and beautiful girl, about fifteen years of age,
sitting within its shade, whose eyes cast down upon some needlework
which she had in her hands, enabled me to survey, for sometime before
she became conscious of my presence, the almost singular loveliness
of feature and person which she possessed. She started, and trembled
with a childish timidity at my approach, which not a little enhanced
the charm of her beauty in my eyes. I apologized for my intrusion;
made some commonplace inquiry and remark, and we soon grew familiar.
The cottage in which her parents resided, was but a little way off,
and I was permitted to attend her home. What was my surprize to
discover in the person of her father, my old tutor. But, fortunately
for me, he was not in a condition to recognize me. His mind and
memory were in great part gone. He still contrived, mechanically as
it were, to teach the 'accidence' to three white-headed urchins,
belonging to the neighborhood, and in this way, with the industry of
his daughters, the family procured a tolerable livelihood. I was
treated kindly by the old people, and had certainly made some slight
impression on Emily--the maiden I had accompanied. I lingered for
some hours in her company--and, though timid, uneducated and girlish
in a great degree, I was fascinated by her beauty, her gentleness,
and the angelic smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>It was late in the day when I left the house of old Andrews. He
had heard my name, and showed no emotion. He had evidently forgotten
all the circumstances of my boyhood in connexion with himself. I
could then venture to return--to repeat my visits--to see once more,
and when I pleased, the sweet object, whose glance had aroused in my
bosom an emotion of sense and sentiment entirely unknown to it
before. We did meet, and each returning day found me on the same
route. Our intimacy increased, and she became my own--she was my
victim.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>That girl was the most artless--the most innocent of all God's
creatures. Strange! that she should be condemned as a sacrifice to
the wishes of the worst and wildest. But, it was her fate, not less
than mine! Need I say that I--whose touch has cursed and contaminated
all whose ill fortunes doomed them to any connexion with me--I
blighted and blasted that innocence, and changed the smile into the
tear, and the hope into the sorrow, of that fond and foolishly
confiding creature. We were both, comparatively, children.--She was,
indeed, in all respects a child--but I--I had lived years--many years
of concentrated wickedness and crime. To do wrong was to be
myself--it was natural. That I should deceive and dishonor, is not
therefore matter of surprize; but that there should be no guardian
angel--no protecting shield for the unwary and the innocent, would
seem to manifest an unwise improvidence in the dispenser of things. A
few months of our intimacy only had elapsed. In the quiet and
secluded bower where we had first met, she lay in my arms. I had
wrought her imagination to the utmost. With a stern sense and
consciousness, all the while, of what I was doing, I had worked
industriously upon the natural passions of her bosom. Her lips were
breathing and burning beneath my own. Her bosom was beating violently
against mine. My arm encircled and clasped her closely. There was a
warm languor in the atmosphere--the trees murmured not--the winds
were at repose--no warning voice rose in the woods--no tempest
blackened in the sky--the shrill scream of a solitary bird at that
moment might have broken the spell--might have saved the victim. But
the scream came not--the fates had decreed it--body and soul, the
victim was mine. She was no longer the pure, the glad, the innocent
and unstained angel I had first known her. Her eyes were now downcast
and fearful--her frame trembled with all the consciousness of guilt.
She gave up all to her affection for one so worthless--so undeserving
as myself: yet had she not my affections, though loving me, even as
the young and morning flower may be seen to link and entwine itself
with and about the deadly and venomous nightshade?</p>

<p>Our intercourse was continued in this way for several months. The
consequences now began to threaten Emily with exposure, and she
hourly besought me to provide against them by our marriage, as I had
already frequently promised her to do. But I had no idea of making
any such sacrifice. The passion which had prompted me at first, had
no longer a place in my bosom. I did not any longer continue to
deceive myself with the belief that she either was or could be any
thing to me. She had few attractions now in my sight, and though
still beautiful, more touchingly so, indeed, from an habitual sadness
which her features had been taught to wear, than ever,--I had learned
to be disgusted and to sicken at the frequency of her complaints, and
the urgency and extravagance of her reproved none with me. I was not
unwilling, for many reasons, that the marriage should take place. It
will be sufficient to name one of these reasons. Though liberal, the
allowance of money for my own expenditure, which I received from my
father, had, for a long time past, been inadequate to the wants which
my excesses necessarily occasioned. I had got largely into debt. I
was harrassed by creditors; and had been compelled to resort to
various improper expedients, to meet my exigencies. My more recent
habits rendered a still further increase of stipend essential, for
though, for some months, I had given my time chiefly to Emily, I had
not yet so entirely divested myself of my old associates as to do
with less money. My pride too, would not permit her to want for many
things, and I had contributed, not a little towards the improvement
of the condition of her family. It is well perhaps, that, in a
chronicle of crime, almost unvarying, I should not altogether
overlook those instances of conduct, which, if not praiseworthy,
were, at least, not criminal. The marriage was therefore determined
upon. Constance was an obedient child, and, without an affection
existing, she consented to become my wife. Still, though making up my
determination, without scruple on the subject, I confess I was not
altogether at ease when my thoughts reverted to the condition of the
poor girl I had dishonored. But what was that condition. In pecuniary
matters, I could make her better off than ever--and, so far as caste
was concerned--she could suffer no loss, for she had known no
society. I never thought of the intrinsic value and necessity of
virtue. My considerations were all selfish, and tributary to
conventional estimates. With regard to our connexion, I saw no
difficulty in marrying the heiress, and still enjoying, as before,
the society of Emily. Matrimonial fidelity was still less a subject
of concern; and, adjusting, in this way, the business and relations
of the future, I hurried the arrangements and prepared assiduously
for the enjoyments of the bridal.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>A sense of caution--or it may be of shame--determined me to keep
the marriage, as long as I well could, from the knowledge of the one
being whom it most injured. A few days before that assigned for the
event, I proceeded to the place of usual rendezvous. I had not seen
her for several days before; and her looks indicated sickness and
suspicion. The latter appearance, I did not seem to observe, but her
indisposition called forth my enquiries and regrets. I still strove
to wear the guise of affection, but my words were cold, and my
manner, I feel assured, wore all the features of the most confirmed
indifference. "You look unwell, Emily," I observed, putting my arms
around her--"you have not been so, have you?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask," was her reply, as her eyes were mournfully riveted
upon my own; "could I continue well, and not see you for three days?
alas! Martin, you little know how long a period in time is three
whole days to me in your absence. Where have you been--have you been
sick--you look not as you are wont to look. You are troubled and
something afflicts you."</p>

<p>Her manner was tender in the extreme--the suggestion even by
herself of indisposition as a cause of my absence, seemed to awaken
all her solicitude, and to make her regret her own implied
reproaches.</p>

<p>"I have been slightly unwell, Emily," was my reply, in a tone
gravely adapted to indicate something of continued indisposition; and
the possibility that this was the case, brought out all her fondness.
How like a child--a sweet confiding child she then spoke to me. With
what deep and fervid devotion--and, yet, at the very moment that the
accents of her voice were most touching and tender, I had begun to
hate her. She was in my way--I saw how utterly impossible it was,
that, feeling for me as she did, she could ever tolerate a connexion
with me, shared at the same time with another.</p>

<p>"But--there is one thing, Martin--one thing of which I would
speak--and, hear me patiently, and be not angry, if in what I say, I
may do you injustice and may not have heard rightly. Say, now, that
you will not be angry with your Emily--that you will forgive her
speech if it seem to call in question your integrity, for, as I live,
Martin, I think you intend me no wrong."</p>

<p>And as she spoke, her hand grasped my arm convulsively, while one
of her own, as if with a spasmodic effort, wound itself about my
neck. I saw that the time for stern collision was at hand--that busy
tongues had been about her, and I steeled myself stubbornly for the
struggle and the strife.</p>

<p>"And, what do they say, Emily--and who are they that say, that
which calls for such a note of preparation? Speak out--say on!"</p>

<p>"I will, Martin--but look not so upon me. I cannot bear your
frown--any thing but that."</p>

<p>"Now then--what is said. What would you have, Emily?"</p>

<p>"There have been those to my mother, Martin--who have doubted your
love for me, and, ignorant of how much importance it is to me now,
who say, you are only seeking to beguile and to mislead me."</p>

<p>"They do me wrong, Emily--they speak false, believe me, as I
live."</p>

<p>"I knew it, Martin--I knew that they did you wrong, and I told
them so, but they sneered and laughed, and so they left me. But,
Martin--they will speak to others, when I shall not be there to
defend you, and we shall both suffer under their suspicions."</p>

<p>She paused here, and her eye sunk under the penetrating gaze of
mine, but suddenly recovering, and hurrying herself, as if she feared
the loss of that momentary impulse which then came to sustain
her--she proceeded--</p>

<p>"I knew that I should suffer from you no injustice--I could not
think it possible that you could wrong the poor girl, who had
confided to you so far;--but Martin--do not smile at my folly--a
something whispers me I have not long, not very long, to live, and I
would be your wife--your married wife--before the time comes when my
sin shall stand embodied before me. Let me have the peace--the peace,
Martin, which our lawful union will bring with it; for now I have
none. You have promised me frequently--say now that we shall be
married this week--say on Thursday, Martin--on Thursday next that it
shall take place."</p>

<p>I started as she concluded the sentence, as if I had been stung
with an adder. Thursday was the day appointed for my marriage with
Constance. Had she heard of this. I fixed my eyes attentively and
searchingly upon her own; but though filled with tears, they quailed
not beneath my glance. On the contrary her gaze was full of
intenseness and expression. They conveyed, in dumb language the
touching appeal of her subdued and apprehensive, though seemingly
confident and assured, spirit. Disappointment, and the hope deferred
that maketh the heart sick, had worn her into meagreness. Her cheeks
were pale--her look was that of suppressed wretchedness, but these
things touched me not. I had no notion of compliance, and my only
thought was how to break off a connexion that promised to be so
excessively troublesome. I had now become completely tired of her,
and told her peremptorily that it was impossible, for a variety of
reasons, to grant her request. She implored--she made a thousand
appeals to every supposed impulse and emotion of manhood and
affection; to my pride, to my honor, to my love. I was inflexible;
and finally, when she continued to press the matter with a warmth and
earnestness natural to one in her situation, particularly as I had
given no reason for my refusal, I grew brutally stern in my replies.
I repulsed her tendernesses, and peevishly at length, uttered some
threat, I know not what--of absence, or indifference, or anger.</p>

<p>She retreated from me a pace, and drawing her hands over her eyes,
seemed desirous of shutting out the presence of a character so
entirely new and unexpected, as I now appeared to her. For a moment
she preserved this attitude in silence--then suddenly again
approaching, in subdued accents, she spoke as at first.</p>

<p>"Your words and look, Martin, just now were so strange and
unnatural that I was almost afraid of you. Do not speak so again to
your Emily, but oh, grant her prayer--her last prayer. I do not pray
for myself, for though I could not live without your affections, I
shall not need them long, but I pray you to give a name, an honorable
name, to the little innocent of this most precious burthen. Let it
not, if it lives, curse the mother for the boon of a life which its
fellows must despise, and speak of with scorn and ignominy."</p>

<p>I stood even this appeal. My heart was steeled within me, and,
though I spoke to her less harshly, I spoke as hypocritically as
ever. She saw through the thin veil which I had deemed it necessary
to throw over my dishonesty, and a new expression took the place of
tenderness in her features.</p>

<p>"It is all true then, as they have said," she exclaimed
passionately. "Now, O God, do I feel my infirmity--now do I know my
sin. And this is the creature I have loved--this is the
thing--wanting in the heart to feel, and mean enough in soul to utter
falsehood and prevaricate--this is the creature for whom I have
sacrificed my heart--for whom I have given up, hopelessly and
haplessly, my own soul. Oh, wretched fool--oh, miserable, most
miserable folly. Yet think not," and as she turned upon me, she
looked like the Priestess upon the tripod, influenced with
inspiration--"Think not, mean traitor, as thou art--think not to
triumph in thy farther seduction. Me thou hast destroyed,--I am thy
victim, and I feel the doom already. But thou shalt go no farther in
thy way. I will seek out this lady, for whose more attractive person,
mine and my honor and affections, alike, are to be sacrificed. She
shall hear from me all the truth. She shall know whether it be
compatible with her honor and happiness, or the dignity of her
character, to unite herself, in such bonds with a man who has proved
so deadly, so dishonorable to her sex. And, oh, God"--she exclaimed,
sinking fervently on her knee--"if it shall so happen that I save one
such as I, from such a folly as mine, may it not expiate in thy
sight, some portion of the sad offence of which I have been
guilty."</p>

<p>She rose firmly and without a tear. Her eyes were red, her cheeks
were burning with the fever of her whole frame, and she seemed, in
all respects, the embodiment of a divine, a glorious inspiration. I
was awed--I was alarmed. I had never before seen her exhibit any
thing like daring or firmness of purpose. She was now the striking
personification of both. She approached and sought to pass by me. I
seized her hand. She withdrew it quickly and indignantly.</p>

<p>"Begone" she exclaimed--"I scorn, I despise you. Think not to keep
me back. You have brought death and shame among my people in devoting
me to both. You shall pollute me no more. Nay, speak not. No more
falsehood, no more falsehood, for your own soul's sake. I would not
that you should seem meaner in my sight, than you already are."</p>

<p>I seized her hand, and retained it by a fierce grasp.--</p>

<p>"Emily," I exclaimed, "what would you do--why is this? I ask but
for delay, give me but a month, and all will be well--you shall then
have what you ask--you shall then be satisfied."</p>

<p>"False--false! These assurances, sir, deceive me not now--they
deceive me no more. My hope is gone, forever gone, that you will do
me justice. I see through your hypocrisy--I know all your villainy,
and Constance Claiborne shall know it too. Ha! do you start when her
name is but mentioned. Think you, I know it not all--know I not that
you have been bought with money--that, vile and mercenary as you are,
you have not only sold me, and this unborn pledge of your dishonesty
and my dishonor, but you have sold yourself. Seek not to keep me
back. She shall hear it all from these lips, that thenceafter shall
forever more be silent."</p>

<p>She struggled to free herself from my grasp, and endeavored to
pass by me, with a desperate effort--her strength was opposed to
mine, and in the heat of the struggle I forgot that victory in such a
contest would be the heaviest shame. Yet, I only sought, at first, to
arrest her progress. As I live, I had then no other object beyond. I
certainly did not intend violence, far less further crime. But the
fate was upon me;--she persisted in her design, and in the effort to
prevent her passage, I hurled her to the ground. I paused, in a
deadly stupor, after this. I was no longer a reasoning--a conscious
being. She looked up to me imploringly--the desperate feeling which
heretofore had nerved and strengthened her, seemed utterly to have
departed. The tears were in her eyes, and, at that moment, she would
have obeyed as I commanded--she would have yielded to all my
requisitions--she would have been my slave. She met no answering
gentleness in my eyes, and with a choking and vain effort at speech,
she turned her face despairingly upon the still dewy grass, and
sobbed, as if the strings of her heart were breaking in unison with
each convulsion of her breast. At that moment, I know not what demon
possessed me. There was a dead--a more than customary silence in all
things around me. I felt a fury within me--a clamorous anxiety about
my heart--a gnawing something that would not sleep, and could not be
silent; and, without a thought of what I was to do, or what had been
done, I knelt down beside her. My eyes wandered wildly around the
forest, but at length, invariably settled, in the end, upon her.
There was an instinct in all this. She had the look of an enemy to
the secret and impelling nature within me, and, without uttering a
single word, my fingers with an infernal gripe, were upon her throat.
She could not now doubt the desperate character of my design, yet did
she not struggle--but her eyes, they spoke, and such a language! A
chain which I myself had thrown about her neck--that neck all symetry
and whiteness--was in my way. I sought, but vainly, to tear it apart
with my hands, and could only do so--with my teeth. In stooping for
this, she writhed her head round and lifted her lips to mine. I
shrunk, as from the fang of a serpent. They had a worse sting, at
that moment, in my eyes. Mournfully, as she saw this, she implored my
mercy.--</p>

<p>"Spare, forgive, dearest Martin, I will never vex you again--spare
me this time, and I will be silent. Kill me not--kill me not"--more
wildly she exclaimed as my grasp became more painful--"I am too young
to die--I am too bad to perish in my sins. Spare me--spare me. I will
not accuse you--I--God! Oh, God!"--and she was dead--dead beneath my
hands!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>I breathed not--I lived not for a minute. My senses were gone--my
eyes were in the air, in the water, in the woods, but I dared not
turn them, for an instant, to the still imploring glance of that now
fixed and terrifying look of appeal. Still it pursued me, and I was
forced to see--it was impossible that I could turn from the horrible
expression--the dreadful glare, which shot from them through every
muscle of my frame. The trees were hung with eyes that depended from
them like leaves. Eyes looked at me from the water that gushed by us;
and, as in a night of many stars, the heavens seemed clustering with
gazing thousands, all bent down terrifically upon me. I started to my
feet in desperation; and by a stern impulse I could not withstand, I
pronounced audibly the name of my crime.</p>

<p>"Murder!"</p>

<p>Ten thousand echoes gave me back the sound. Tongues spoke it in
every tree, and roused into something like demoniac defiance, I again
shouted it back to them with the energies of a Stentor--then leaned
eagerly forth to hear the replication. But this mood lasted not long.
I was a murderer! I whispered it, as if in terror, to myself. I
desired some assurance of the truth.</p>

<p>"I am a murderer!"</p>

<p>Spoken, however low, it still had its echo.</p>

<p>"Murderer!"--was the response of the trees, which had now tongues,
as well as eyes. The agony grew intolerable, and a lethargic stupor
came to my aid. I approached the corpse of my victim. Resolutely I
approached it. How different was the aspect which her features now
bore. She looked forth all her sweetness, and there was something--so
I fancied--like forgiveness on her lips. Was it I that had defiled so
pure an image--was it my hand, that, penetrating the sanctuary of
life, had stolen the sacred fire from the altar? Oh, strange! that
man should destroy the beauty which charms--the life that cheers and
gladdens--the affection which won and nourishes him.</p>

<p>Deep in the centre of that forest stood an ancient rock. It was
little known to the neighborhood, and its discouraging aspect and
rude and difficult access had preserved it from frequent intrusion.
I, however, whom no sterility could at any time deter, had explored
its recesses, and it now suggested itself to my mind, as the place
most calculated to keep the secret of my crime. A large natural
cavity in one of its sides, difficult of approach, and inscrutable to
research, seemed to present a natural tomb, and the suggestion was
immediately seized upon. I took her in my arms--I pressed her to my
heart--but in that pressure I maddened. I had not yet destroyed, in
her death, the distinct principle of life which she carried within
her. I felt the slight but certain motion of her child--of my
child--struggling as it were for freedom. I closed my eyes--I
suppressed the horrible thoughts which were crowding upon my brain,
and hurrying on my way, sought out the cavity assigned for her
repose. But a single plunge, and she was gone from sight, from reach.
The rock was silent as the grave--it had no echoes--for, at that
place and moment, I had no speech.</p>

<p>Will it be believed, the stride I had taken in crime, contributed
largely to the sense of my own importance. I had never before doubted
my capacity for evil--but I now felt--for I had realized--I had
exercised--this capacity. There is something elevating--something
attractive to the human brute, in being a destroyer. It was so with
me. There was an increased vigor in my frame--there was new strength
and elasticity in my tread--I feel assured that there was a loftier,
a manlier expression in my look and manner. But, all was not so in my
thought. There every thing was in uproar. There was a strange
incoherence, an insane recklessness about my heart, where, if I may
so phrase it, the spirit seemed prone to wandering about precipices
and places of dread and danger. I kept continually repeating to
myself, the name of my crime. I caught myself muttering over and over
the word "Murder," and that, too, coupled with my own name.
"Murderer," and "Martin Faber," seemed ever to my imagination the
burden of a melody; and its music, laden with never ceasing echoes,
heard by my own ears, was forever on my own lips.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>I left the rock, slowly and frequently looking behind me.
Sometimes my fancies confirmed to my sight the phantom of the
murdered girl, issuing from the gaping aperture, and with waving
arms, threatening and denouncing me. But I sternly put down these
weak intruders. Though the first crime, of so deep a dye, which I had
ever committed, I felt that the thoughts and feelings which came with
the act, had been long familiar to my mind. The professional assassin
could hardly look upon his last murder, with more composure, than I
now surveyed the circumstances of my first. I was indeed a veteran,
and in a past condition of society, I should have been a hero--the
savior or the destroyer of a nation.</p>

<p>To be precipitate, was to be weak; so thought I even in that
moment of fearful circumstances. I went back with all possible
composure to the spot in which the crime had been committed. I
examined the spot carefully--took with my eye the bearing and
distances of all the surrounding objects in their connexion with the
immediate spot on which the deed had been done. In this examination,
I found the pocket handkerchief of Emily, with her name written in
Indian ink upon it. I carefully cut it into shreds, dividing each
particular letter, with my pen-knife, and distributing the several
pieces at slow intervals upon the winds. Where our feet together had
pressed the sands, with a handful of brush, I obliterated the traces;
and in the performance of this task, I drew off my own shoes,
leaving, only, as I proceeded, the impression of a naked foot. While
thus engaged, I perceived for the first time, that I had lost a rich,
and large cameo, from my bosom. The loss gave me no little concern,
for, apart from the fact of its being generally known for mine, the
intials of my name were engraven on the gold setting. How and where
had it been lost. This was all important, and with indefatigable
industry, I examined the grass and every spot of ground which I had
gone over in the recent events. But in vain--it was not to be found,
and with a feeling of uneasiness--not to describe my anxiety by a
stronger epithet--I proceeded on my way home.</p>

<p>The poverty of Emily's family; the insulated position which they
held in society; their inability to press an inquiry--were all so
many safeguards and securities in my favor. There was some little
stir, it is true--but I had so arranged matters that I passed
unsuspected. The inquiry was confined to the particular part of
country in which she resided--a lonely and almost uninhabited
region--and, but a distant rumor of the crime reached our village--in
which, the connexion existing between us was almost entirely unknown.
The family had but few claims upon society, and but little interest
was excited by their loss. In a little while all inquiry ceased; and
with a random and general conclusion that she had fallen into the
river, the thought of Emily Andrews gradually passed from the
memories of those who had known her.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>The night came, appointed for my marriage with the beautiful and
wealthy Constance Claiborne. Attended by William Harding, who,
strange to say, in spite of the manifest and radical differences of
character existing between us, was yet my principal companion, I was
punctual to the hour of appointment. Every preparation had been made
by which the ceremony should be attractive. A large company had been
assembled. Lights in profusion--rich dresses--gayly dressed and
decorated apartments, and the most various music, indicated the
spirit of joy and perfect harmony with which our mutual families
contemplated our union. I have already said, the bride was beautiful.
Words cannot convey an idea of her beauty. She was emphatically a
thing of light and love--</p>

<p>"Which seen, becomes a part of sight."</p>

<p>In grace, one knew not with what, save herself, to institute a
comparison. In expression, there were volumes of romantic, and
interesting poetry, embodied in each feature of her face; and the
steel of my affections, stern as it was, wherever she turned, even as
the dutiful needle to the pole, turned intuitively along with her.
Such was the maiden,--so much after the make and mould of heaven,
whom a cruel destiny was about to link with one formed in spirit
after the fashion of hell.</p>

<p>The ceremony was begun. We stood up with linked hands at the
altar. The priest went on with his formula. The bride's hand trembled
in mine, and her eyes were commercing only with the richly carpeted
floor. I was about to answer the question which should have made us
one, when a cold wind seemed to encircle my body. My bones were
numbed, and a freezing chill went through my whole system. My tongue
refused its office, and, instinctively, as it were, bending to the
opposite quarter of the apartment, my eyes fell upon a guest whom
none had invited. There, palpable as when I had last seen her, stood
the form of Emily Andrews. A pale and melancholy picture, and full of
a terrible reproach. I was dumb, and for a moment, had eyes only for
her. She was motionless, as when I had borne her to the unhallowed
grave in which she did not rest. I felt that all eyes were upon
me--the bride's hand was slowly withdrawn from mine, and that motion
restored me. Mine were terrible energies. I seized her hand with a
strong effort, and with a voice of the sternest emphasis, my eye
firmly fixed upon the obtrusive phantom, I gave the required
affirmative. With the word, the figure was gone.--I had conquered.
You will tell me, as philosophers have long since told us, that this
was all the work of imagination--a diseased and excited fancy, and in
this you are probably right. But what of that? Is it less a matter of
supernatural contrivance, that one's own spirit should be made to
conjure up the spectres which haunt and harrow it, than that the dead
should actually be made to embody themselves, as in life, for the
same providence? The warning sound that chatters in my ear of
approaching death may be, in fact, unuttered; but if my spirit, by an
overruling fate, is calculated for the inception of such a sound,
shall we hold it as less the work of a superior agency? Is it less an
omen for that?</p>

<p>This was not all. At midnight, as I approached my chamber, the
same ghastly spectre stood at the door as if to guard it against my
entrance. For a moment I paused and faltered; but thought came to my
relief. I knew that the energies of soul, immortal and from the
highest as they are, were paramount, and I advanced. I stretched
forth my hand to the key, and all was vacancy again before me. If my
fancies conceived the ghost, my own energies were adequate to its
control. In this I had achieved a new conquest, and my pride was
proportionately increased and strengthened. I was thus taught how
much was in my own power, in making even destiny subservient to my
will!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>I need not say that no happiness awaited me in my marriage. Still
less is it necessary that I should tell you of the small amount of
happiness that fell to the lot of my wife. I did not ill-treat
her--that is to say, I employed neither blows nor violence; but I was
a wretched discontent, and when I say this I have said all. She
suffered with patience, however, and I sometimes found it impossible,
and always difficult, to drive her beyond the boundary of yielding
and forgiving humility. She loved me not from the first, and only
became my bride from the absence of sufficient firmness of character,
to resist the command. The discovery of this fact, which I soon made,
offended my pride. I did not distrust, however--I hated her; and,
with a strange perversity of character, which, let philosophers
account for as they may--when I found that she could love, and that
feelings were engendered in her bosom for another, hostile to her
affection for me, though not at variance with her duties--I
encouraged their growth. I nursed their developement. I stimulated
their exercise; and strove, would you believe it, to make her the
instrument of my own dishonor. But her sense of pride and propriety
was greater than mine. Though conscious that her heart was another's,
she unerringly held her faith to her husband, and my anger and
dislike were exaggerated, when I discovered that my vice, even when
allied to and assisted by her own feelings, could gain no ascendancy
over her virtue.</p>

<p>She was won by the gentleness, the talent, the high character of
my old friend, William Harding. She listened to his language with
unreluctant and unconcealed pleasure. She delighted in his society;
and with a feeling which she had never dared to name to herself, she
gave him a preference, in every thought, in every emotion of her
being. Nor--boy as he was--sensitive and easily wrought upon by
respect and kindness--was he at all insensible to her regards. He
became, as an acquaintance, almost an inmate of our house. He was
always with us--and with the openness of heart common to such a
character, he unreservedly sought for the society of Constance. I
soon discovered their mutual propensities, for, at an early period, I
had learned, with singular felicity, to analyze character. At first,
and while she was yet a charming creation in my sight, and before I
had learned to disregard and be indifferent to the admiration which
she excited in others, this predilection gave me not a little
concern. I was for a season the victim of a jealous doubt--not so
much the result of a fear of offended honor, as of a weak pride and
vanity, that was vexed at the preference given to him over myself, in
the bosom of one, I strove to have exclusively my own. But this
feeling went with the season. I grew indifferent at first, then
pleased with their association, and finally it became an object with
me, so to encourage it, as to give me a sufficient excuse and
opportunity for a dreadful and overwhelming revenge. But they were
both honest--honest as I had never been--as I never expected man or
woman to have been! Twining and intermingling, hourly in spirit, the
most jealous scrutiny, the most bitter hate and hostility, could
never detect the slightest feature of impropriety in their conduct.
Many were the modes which I chose to stimulate their passions--to
influence their desires--to put their spirits into flame; and many
were the opportunities with which I sought, in hurrying them to
crime, to provide myself with victims. They went through the ordeal
like angels--without one speck of earth; and pining with suppressed
and strong affections, I beheld the cheek of Constance grow paler,
day by day, and saw, at every visit--the increased wildness of
look--the still exaggerated emotions struggling for utterance and
life, in the bosom of the young and susceptible Harding.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>Some months had now elapsed since our marriage; and in this time,
my house and young wife had lost most of their attractions. My
favorite habit, and one which contributed not a little to my mood of
sternness, was to take long walks into the neighboring country; and
with my fowling-piece on my shoulder as apologetic for my idle
wanderings, the neighboring forests for ten or fifteen miles round,
soon became familiar to my survey. Sometimes, on these occasions,
Harding would become my companion; and as he was highly contemplative
in character, his presence did not at all interfere with the
gloominess of my mood. It was on one of these occasions, while
traversing a dense wood, thickly sown with undergrowth, and
penetrable with difficulty, that we sat down together upon the trunk
of a fallen tree, and fell into conversation. Our dialogue was
prompted by the circumstances of our situation, and unconsciously I
remarked--</p>

<p>"Harding, this is just such a spot, which one would choose in
which to commit a murder!"</p>

<p>"Horrible!" was his reply, "what could put such a thought into
your head? This, is just the spot now which I should choose for the
inception of a divine poem. The awful stillness--the solemn
gloom--the singular and sweet monotony of sound, coming from the
breeze through the bending tree tops, all seem well calculated to
beget fine thoughts,--daring fancies--bold and striking
emotions."</p>

<p>"You talk of taking life, as if it were the crowning crime--it
appears to me an error of society by which the existence of a being,
limited to a duration of years, is invested with so much importance.
A few years lopt from the life of an individual is certainly no such
loss, shortening as it must, so many of his cares and troubles; and
the true standard by which we should determine upon a deed, is the
amount of good or evil which it may confer upon the person or persons
immediately interested."</p>

<p>"That is not the standard," was his reply--"since that would be
making a reference to varying and improper tribunals, to determine
upon principles which should be even and immutable. But, even by such
a standard, Martin, it would be a crime of the most horrible
complexion, for, leave the choice to the one you seek to murder, and
he will submit, in most cases, to the loss of all his worldly
possessions, and even of his liberty, in preference to the loss of
life."</p>

<p>"What would you say, William if you knew I had been guilty of this
crime?"</p>

<p>"Say!" he exclaimed, as his eyes shot forth an expression of the
deepest horror--"say!--I could say nothing--I could never look upon
you again."</p>

<p>I looked at him with close attention for a moment, then, placing
my hands upon his shoulder with a deliberation which was significant
of the deepest madness, I spoke:</p>

<p>"Look--you shall look upon me again. I have been guilty of this
same crime of taking life. I have been, and am, a murderer."</p>

<p>He sprung upon his feet with undisguised horror. His face was
ashen pale--his lips were parted in affright; and while I held one of
his hands, the other involuntarily was passed over, entirely
concealing his eyes. What prompted me to the narration I know not. I
could not resist the impulse--I was compelled to speak. It was my
fate. I described my crime--I dwelt upon all its particulars; but
with a caution, strangely inconsistent with the open confidence I had
manifested, I changed the name of the victim--I varied the period,
and falsified, in my narrative, all the localities of the crime;
concluding with describing her place of burial beneath a tree, in a
certain ground which was immediately contiguous, and well known to us
both.</p>

<p>He heard me out with wonder and astonishment. His terror shook his
frame as with an ague, and at the conclusion he tried to laugh, and
his teeth chattered in the effort.</p>

<p>"It is but a story," he said chokingly, "a horrible story, Martin,
and why do you tell it me? I almost thought it true from the earnest
manner in which you narrated it."</p>

<p>"It is true, William--true as you now stand before me. You doubt,
I will swear--"</p>

<p>"Oh, swear not--I would rather not believe you--say no more, I
pray you--tell me no more."</p>

<p>With a studied desperation--a malignant pleasure, increasing in
due proportion with the degree of mental torture which he appeared to
undergo, I went again over the whole story as I had before told
it--taking care that my description of each particular should be made
as vivid as the solemn and bold truth certainly made it.</p>

<p>"I am a murderer! William Harding!"</p>

<p>"May God forgive you, Martin--but why have you told me this--would
you murder me, Martin? Have I done any thing to offend you?"</p>

<p>His excessive nervousness, at length, grew painful, even to
myself. "Nay, fear not, I would not harm you, William, for the world.
I would rather serve and save you. But keep my secret--I have told it
you in confidence, and you will not betray me."</p>

<p>"Horrible confidence!" was his only reply, as we took our way from
the forest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>Several days had passed since this conference, and, contrary to
his custom, Harding, in all this time, had kept out of my sight. His
absence was felt by both Constance and myself. He had been, of late,
almost the only companion known to either of us. Why I liked him I
knew not. His virtues were many, and virtues were, at no time, a
subject of my admiration. That he was loved by Constance, I had no
question; that he loved her I felt equally certain--but it was the
passion of an angel on the part of both; and it may be that knowing
the torture which it brought with it to both of them, my malignant
spirit found pleasure in bringing them together. It was not a
charitable mood, I am satisfied, that made me solicitous that he
should be as much as possible an inmate of my dwelling.</p>

<p>He came at last, and I was struck with his appearance. The change
for the worse was dreadfully obvious. He looked like one, who had
been for many nights without sleep. He was pale, nervous in the last
degree, and awfully haggard.</p>

<p>"I am miserable," said he, "since you breathed that accursed story
in my ears. Tell me, I conjure you, Martin, as you value my quiet,
that you but jested with me--that the whole affair was but a
fabrication--a fetch of the nightmare--a mere vision of the
fancy."</p>

<p>Will it be believed, that having thus an opportunity, even then,
of undoing the impression I had created, I took no advantage of it. I
persisted in the story--I was impelled to do so, and could not
forbear. There was an impulse that mastered the will--that defied the
cooler judgment--that led me waywardly, as it thought proper. You
have read that strange poem of Coleridge, in which the "Auncient
Marinere" is made, whether he will or no, and in spite of every
obstacle, to thrust his terrible narrative into the ears of the
unwilling listener. It was so with me; but though I was thus
compelled to denounce my crime, the will had still some exercise, and
I made use of it for my security. I changed the particulars so
materially from the facts, as they really were, that inquiry must
only have resulted in my acquittal. The state of mind under which
Harding labored, was of melancholy consequence, to him, at least, if
not to me. Sad and disappointed, he left me without a word, and for
some days more I saw him not. At length he came to me looking worse
than ever.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad, Faber, with this infernal secret. It keeps me
awake all night. It fills my chamber with spectres. I am haunted with
the presence of the girl, you accuse yourself of having murdered.</p>

<p>"Go to--will you be a child all your life. Why should she haunt
you?--it is not you who have murdered her--she does not trouble
me.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, she does. She calls upon me to bring you to
justice. I awake and she is muttering in my ears. She implores--she
threatens--she stands by my bed side in the darkness--she shakes the
curtains--I hear the rustling of her garments--I hear her words; and
when I seek to sleep, her cries of 'Murder,! Murder! Murder!' are
shouted, and ring through all my senses, as the sound of a sullen,
swinging bell in the wilderness. Save me, Martin--from this
vision--save me from the consequence of your own imprudence in
telling me this story. Assure me that it is untrue, or I feel that I
shall be unable to keep the secret. It is like a millstone around my
neck--it makes a hell within my heart."</p>

<p>"What! and would you betray me--would you bring me to punishment,
for an offence which I have told you was involuntary, and which I
unconsciously committed? Your sense of honor, apart from your feeling
of friendship, alone, should be sufficient to restrain you. I cannot
believe that you would violate your pledge--that you can betray the
confidence reposed in you."</p>

<p>Silenced, but not satisfied, and far more miserable than ever, the
poor youth, whose nerves were daily become more and more unsteady and
sensitive under these exciting influences, went away;--but the next
day, he came again--his look was fixed and resolute, and an air of
desperate decision marked every feature.</p>

<p>"I am about to go to the Justice, Martin, to reveal all this
story, precisely as you have told it to me--I cannot bear a
continuance of life, haunted as I have been, by innumerable terrors,
ever since I heard it. But last night, I heard the distinct
denunciations of the murdered girl, couched in the strongest
language, emphatically uttered in my ears. The whole scene was before
me, and the horrors of the damned, could not exceed those which
encompassed my spirit. I fled from the chamber--from the house. In
the woods I have passed the whole night in the deepest prayer. My
determination is the result of the soundest conviction of its
necessity. I can keep your secret no longer."</p>

<p>I paused for a moment, and having prepared myself for all
difficulties by a consideration of all the circumstances, I simply
bade him--"Go then--if he was determined upon the betrayal of his
friend and the forfeiture of his honor."</p>

<p>"Reproach me not thus, Martin"--was his reply. "Forgive me, but I
must do so. I must either disclose all or commit self-murder. I
cannot keep within my bosom that which makes it an &AElig;tna--which
keeps it forever in flame and explosion. Forgive--forgive me!" Thus
speaking, he rushed from my presence.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>I was cited before the Justice, and the testimony of William
Harding delivered with the most circumstantial minuteness, was taken
down in my presence. Never did I see a more striking instance of
conscience struggling with feeling--never had I conceived of so
complete a conquest of one over the other. I denied all. I denied
that I had ever made him such a statement--that we had ever had any
such conversation; and with the coolness and composure of veteran
crime, wondered at the marvellous insanity of his representations. He
was dumb, he looked absolutely terrified. Of course, however, in such
an examination, my own statements were unavailing; and his were to be
sustained by a reference to the localities and such of the details
which he had made, as might ostensibly contribute to its sustenance
or overthrow. Search was made under the tree where my victim was
alledged to have been buried. The earth appeared never to have been
disturbed from the creation--upon digging, nothing was found. So,
with all other particulars. Harding's representations were confuted.
He was regarded by all as a malignant wretch, who envied the
felicity, and sought to sting the hand of him who had cherished and
befriended him. The public regard feel away from him, and he was
universally avoided. I affected to consider him the victim of
momentary hallucination, and the christian charity thus manifested,
became the admiration of all. I almost dreaded that I should be
deified--made a deacon in life, and a saint after death.</p>

<p>Poor Harding sunk silently to his den. Sensitively alive to public
opinion, as well as private regard, his mind reeled to and fro, like
a storm troubled vessel, beneath a shock so terrible and unexpected.
He had lived upon the breath of fame--he was jealous of high
reputation--he was tremblingly alive to those very regards of the
multitude, which were now succeeded by their scorn and hisses. What a
blow had I given him--but he was not yet to escape me. I suffered a
day or two to elapse, and then sought him out in his chamber. I
entered, and looked upon him for several minutes unobserved. His head
was between his hands, and his chin rested upon the table. His air
was that of the most woful abandon. The nature of his feelings might
be inferred, along with his personal appearance, from the nature of
the companions beside, and the general condition of things around
him. One boot was thrown off, and lay upon the floor--the other, as
if he had grown incapable of further effort, was permitted to remain
upon his foot. The mirror lay in the smallest pieces about the room;
the contemplation of his own features, blasted as they had been with
the shame of his situation, having prompted him, as he came from the
place of trial, to dash his hand through it. On the table, and on
each side of him, lay--strangely associated--his bible and his
pistols. He had been about to refer to one or to the other of them
for consolation. It was in this situation, that I found him out. I
brought increased tortures--while the people, who saw and wondered,
gave me credit for christian benevolence. How many virtues would put
on the most atrocious features, could their true motives be pursued
through the hive of venomous purposes that so frequently swarm and
occupy the secret cells and caverns of the human heart!</p>

<p>He saw me at length, and, as if the associations which my presence
had called up, were too terrible for contemplation, he buried his
head in his hands, and again thrust them on the table. As I
approached, however, he started from this position--a mood entirely
new, appeared to seize upon him, and snatching the pistol which lay
before him upon the table, he rushed to meet me. He placed it upon my
bosom, and deliberately cocked it, placing his finger at the same
moment upon the trigger. A glare of hellish desperation, flowed out
from his eyes, as with words that seemed rather shrieked than
articulated, he exclaimed--"And what is there that keeps me from
destroying you? What should stay my hand--what should interpose to
protect you from my just revenge--what should keep you from the
retributive wrath, which you have roused into fury?"</p>

<p>I made no movement--precipitation, or any act or gesture, on my
part, at that moment, would have been instant death. He would have
felt his superiority. I maintained my position, and without raising a
finger, I replied with the utmost deliberation:--</p>

<p>"What should keep you from taking my life! What a question! Would
you be answered?--Your own fears.--You know that I would haunt
you."</p>

<p>The pistol dropped from his hands, and he trembled all over. I
proceeded.</p>

<p>"You should have no peace--no moment of repose secure from my
intrusion--no single hour you should call your own. I should link
myself to you, as Mezentius' dead, to his condemned and living
victim. I would come between you and your dearest joys, nor depart
for a solitary moment from a share in all the unavoidable duties and
performances of life. We should sit, side by side, at the same
table--sleep in the same couch,--dwell in the same dwelling. Would
you rise to speak in the council, I should prompt your words--I
should guide your action. Would you travel, I would mount the box and
impel in the direction of my caprice. Would you love, I would figure
in your courtship--go between yourself and mistress, and assist in
your bridal. Your own wife should not have one half of the communion
I should enjoy with you!"</p>

<p>He was paralyzed with his agony.</p>

<p>"Terrible man!" he exclaimed, "What would you do with me; why am I
made your victim--why do you persecute me? I have not wronged; I have
not sought to wrong you. You, on the contrary, have destroyed me, and
yet would pursue me further. You have been my evil genius."</p>

<p>"I know it--I deplore it!"</p>

<p>"You deplore it! Horrible mockery! How shall I believe your speech
after what has happened. Why deny the story, yourself poured into my
ears as the truth."</p>

<p>"It was the truth!"</p>

<p>"Yet you swore it was false!"</p>

<p>"Life is sweet--life is necessary, if not to human joys, at least,
to the opportunities of human repentance. Would you have me give
myself to an ignominious death upon the scaffold--disgracing my
family, dishonoring myself, and dooming all who shared in my
communion to a kindred dishonor with myself?"</p>

<p>"Why then did you tell me of this crime?"</p>

<p>"I could not help it. The impulse was native and involuntary, and
I could not disobey it. It would not be resisted. It burned in my
bosom as it has done in yours, and, until I had revealed it, I could
hope for no relief."</p>

<p>"Dreadful alternative! Hear me, Martin Faber--hear me and pity me.
You know my history--you know my hopes--my pretensions--my ambition.
You know that for years, from my boyhood up, in despite of poverty,
and the want of friends and relatives, I have been contending for
glory--for a name. You know that the little world in which we live,
had begun to be friendly to my aspirations--that they looked on my
progress with sympathy and encouragement--that they pointed to me as
one likely to do them honor--to confer a name upon my country as well
as upon myself. You know that for years, in solitude, and throughout
the long hours of the dark and wintery night, I have pursued my
solitary toil for these objects. That I have shrunk from the society
that has been wooing me--that I have denied myself all the enjoyments
which are the life of other men--that I have, in short, been
sacrificing the present for the future existence--the undying memory
of greatness, which it had been my hope, to leave behind me. This you
knew--this you know. In one hour, you--without an object--to satisfy
a wanton caprice--you have overthrown all these hopes--you have made
all these labors valueless--you have destroyed me. Those who loved,
hate me--those who admired, contemn--those who praised, now curse and
denounce me as a wanton and malicious enemy, seeking the destruction
of my friend! I am not only an exile from my species--I am banished
from that which has been the life-blood of my being--the possession
of a goodly, of a mighty name! I have no further use in life."</p>

<p>"All is true--you have said but the truth. I am conscious of it
all."</p>

<p>"Oh, speak not, I conjure you--I need not your assurances in my
confirmation. I do not ask your voice. Hear me in what I shall say,
and if you can, heal as far as you may heal, the wounds you have
inflicted."</p>

<p>"Speak on!"</p>

<p>"I will seek to reconcile myself to the condition--to the exile to
which you have driven me. I will struggle to give up the high hopes
which have prompted and cheered me, through the unalleviated and
unlighted labors of my life--I will struggle to be--nothing! All I
ask is that you should give me peace--permit me to sleep once more.
Say that you have not committed the crime, of which you have accused
yourself. Give me this assurance, and free me from this gibbering and
always present spectre, that, roused for ever by my fancies, refuses
to be gone!"</p>

<p>How easy to have granted this request! How impossible, indeed,
would it appear, to have refused an appeal, urged under such
circumstances. But I did refuse--I reiterated the story of my crime,
as I had uttered it before, without any variation, and the nervously
susceptible youth sunk down before me, in despair, upon the floor. In
a moment, however, he arose, and--smile was upon his lips. There was
a fearful energy in his eye, which had never marked it before, and
which it surprised me not a little to survey. With a strong effort,
he approached me.</p>

<p>"I will be no longer a child--I will shake off this fever of
feeling which is destroying me. I will conquer these fancies--I will
not be their slave. Shall I possess a mind, so soaring and absolute,
to bow down to the tyrant of my own imaginings? I will live for
better things. I will make an effort!"</p>

<p>I applauded his determination, and persuaded him to go with me, as
before, to my residence. This, though good policy with me, was the
height of bad policy with him. The world looked upon me as the most
forgiving and foolishly weak philanthropist--a benevolent creation of
the very finest water. The readiness with which Harding again sought
my hospitality, after his charges against me, was, of course, still
further in evidence, against the honesty of his intentions. They
looked upon his depravity as of the most heinous character, and
numberless were the warnings which I hourly received, of the thousand
stings which the--so-called--serpent was treasuring up for my bosom.
But, I affected to think differently. I put all in his conduct down
to a momentary aberration of intellect, and urged the beauty and
propriety of christian forgiveness. Was I not of a most saint-like
temper? They thought so.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>It is strange, that, with my extended and perfect knowledge of
human character, and my great love of mental and moral analysis, I
should have suffered myself to be taken in by these external shows on
the part of my victim. Strange, that so sudden--so unlooked for, an
alteration from his wonted habit had not aroused my jealousy--my
suspicion of some hidden motive. But, my blindness was a part of my
fate, or, how should it have been that a creature so weak, so utterly
dependent as Harding had ever been, should have deceived a spirit so
lynx-eyed as mine. Led to consider him too greatly the victim of the
nervous irritability, boy which, indeed, his every action and impulse
was distinguished, I had not looked for the exercise, in his mind, of
any of that kind of energy, which would carry him undeviatingly and
perseveringly to the attainment of any remote or difficult object, or
to the accomplishment of a far and foreign purpose. I had neglected
entirely to allow for the stimulating properties of a defeat, to a
mind which had only lived for a single object. I had refused to count
upon the decision of character, which, might, by probability, arise
in a mind, however in all other respects, variable and vascillating,
when concentrating itself upon the attainment of a single end, and
that, too, of a kind, so absorbing, so all impelling as the
attainment of fame. I did not recollect that Harding had himself
acknowledged the existence of one only passion, in his bosom; or, I
should have seen that his present change of manner, was but a thin
veil disguising and concealing some ulterior project, subservient to
the leading passion of his spirit. I failed, therefore,--fool that I
was--to perceive the occult design, which of a sudden had so
completely altered all the obvious characteristics of my
companion--his habits, his temper, and his hopes. Folly to suppose,
that with the loss of public estimation, he would be content with
life unless with a desperate effort to regain his position. And how
could he regain that position? How, but by establishing my guilt, and
his innocence of all malevolent intention. And such was his design.
Assured, as he now was, that I was in truth a criminal--that I had
committed the murder of which I had accused myself, and that I had
only so varied the statement of its particulars as to mislead and
defeat enquiry--and looking forward to the one single object,--that
of restoring himself to the popular regards of which I had deprived
him--he was determined, of himself, to establish my crime--to trace
the story from the very imperfect data I had myself given him, and by
perpetual associations with myself, and a close examination into my
moral make, to find out the materials of evidence which should
substantiate his now defeated accusations. How blind was I not to
have perceived his object--not to see through his unaccustomed
artifices! The genius--the gigantic genius of his mind, will be best
comprehended from this curious and great undertaking, and from the
ingenuity and indefatigable industry with which he pursued it. Nor,
from this fact, alone, but coupled, as under existing circumstances
was the pursuit adopted, his strength of character and firmness of
mind, are of the most wonderful description. The task was attended
with an association, which, for a protracted period of time, still
further exposed him to the scornful execrations and indignation of
those, for whose good opinion, alone, he was voluntarily about to
undergo all this additional load of obloquy. Under these aspects the
effort was a highsouled and sublime one, and furnished one of the
best proofs of the moral elevation of his genius. I regard it now,
when too late to arrest its exercise and progress, with a sentiment
little short of wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>All these occurrences, had, of course, been made known to my wife;
and shocked and terrified as she had been--torn and distracted
between a sense of duty to myself, and a feeling of deep, but
unexpressed regard for my accuser--when, for the first time after the
trial, I brought him to the house, with a highly proper
spirit--seeing the affair as she had seen it--she declined making her
appearance. I insisted upon it:--</p>

<p>"How can you require such a thing?" was her very natural inquiry.
"Whatever may have been his motive, has he not sought your life. Has
he not brought a foul and false accusation against you, making you a
criminal of the darkest dye?"</p>

<p>"Look at me, Constance," I said in reply, as I took one of her
hands in mine--"I am the criminal--I committed the crime he charged
upon me, and which I myself had revealed to him. His accusation, so
far as he was concerned, was neither foul nor false!"</p>

<p>And wherefore did I tell her this? Why should I have multiplied
the evidence against me--why put myself at the mercy of another? It
might be enough to say that I did not fear that Constance would
betray me. As she was a pure and delicate woman, her love for
him--treasured up in secret, and a source of trembling and
self-reproach, as I knew it must be, to her heart--was my sufficient
security. She would not have linked her testimony with his, however
she might have hated me and loved him, fearing that her motives might
be subject to the suspicion of others, as she herself would have
suspected them. This consideration would have left me without fear,
in that quarter, but this was not a consideration with me, in telling
her the story. I could not refrain from telling it--in spite of
myself I was compelled to do so--it was my fate.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to describe her horror. She was dumb, and in
silence descended with me to the apartment in which Harding had been
left. To him this was a moment of fearful ordeal. The woman he loved,
though hopelessly, he had struck, through her husband. He was not to
know that I had most effectually acquitted him, to her, of the
offence, for which he anticipated her scorn and hatred. His anxiety
and wretchedness were again manifest until she relieved him, as with
a boldness of spirit which I had never before seen her manifest, she
walked forward, took his hand, and welcomed him as if nothing had
happened. He looked first to me, then to her and silently, with a
tearful eye, and frame violently agitated, he carried her hand to his
lips. She retreated, and was deeply confused by this act. I saw her
inmost soul, at that moment in her face. Why had she not loved me as
she loved him? Why, oh, why?</p>

<p>That night, in my chamber, I said to her--"You love this
youth--speak not--I would not have you deny it. I will tell you
more--would you know it?--he loves you too, and there are few persons
in the world more deserving the love of one another. Were I dead
to-morrow you would most probably make the discovery, and--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Martin Faber, I see not why you should torment me in this
manner. For heaven's sake, let me have peace. Make not all miserable
about you; or, if you are bent on making me so, let not your malice
exercise itself on this unhappy youth, whose life you have already
embittered, whose prospects you have blighted--and to whom every hour
of association with yourself, must work additional evil. Persuade
him, for the repose of all, to leave the country."</p>

<p>"Would you fly with him! Beware, woman! Think not to deceive me--I
see into your heart, and understand all its sinuosities. Look that
your interest in this enthusiast gets not the better of your
duty."</p>

<p>She turned her head upon the pillow, and sobbed bitterly:--yet,
how wantonly had I uttered these reproaches. The angels were not more
innocent in spirit than was she at that moment when I had inflicted
upon her the tortures of the damned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>I am now rather to narrate the labors of another than of myself,
and to record the progress of Harding in the newly assumed duties of
his life, of which, to their termination, I had little, if any
suspicion.</p>

<p>In accordance with his design, and in this respect, my own habits
and disposition favored him largely, he was with me at all hours--we
were inseparable. He pretended a taste for gunning, and though a poor
sportsman, provided with the usual accoutrements, he would sally
forth with me, day after day, in the pursuit of the game, in which
the neighboring country was plentifully supplied. Day by day, at all
hours, in all places, we were still together, and seemingly in the
same pursuit; yet, did we not always hunt. We chose fine
rambles--pleasant and devious windings of country, secluded roads,
hills and dales and deep forests, in which a moody and reflective
spirit might well indulge in its favorite fancies. Of this make were
we both. To-day we were in one direction--to-morrow in another, until
the neighboring world and woods, for an extent in some quarters of
twenty miles, became familiar to us in our excursions. I was struck
with Harding's new habit of observation. In our rambles before he had
seen, or appeared to see, nothing. Now nothing escaped his notice and
attention. Tree and stump--hill and vale--wood and water--all grew
familiar, and a subject of large and narrow examination. He seemed
particularly solicitous of the true relations of things--of parallel
distances--objects of comparative size, and the dependencies of a
group, in the compass of his survey. Having great fondness for
landscape drawing and some skill in the art, I put these
peculiarities down to the account of this propensity, and gave myself
no concern about it; but not unfrequently, turning suddenly, would I
detect the fixed gaze of his eye, fastened inquiringly upon my own.
On such occasions he would turn aside with a degree of confusion,
which, did not, however, provoke my suspicions. There was no object
in these wanderings that seemed too humble for his survey. He peered
into every cup of the hills--into hollow trees--groped his way
through the most thickly spread and seemingly impervious undergrowth,
and suffered no fatigue, and shrunk back from no difficulty. Having
hit upon a new spot, which looked impervious or dark, he would,
before its examination, closely watch my progress--the direction
which I took and the peculiar expression of my face. These practices
were not unseen by me then, but I regarded them as having no
object--I was certainly blind to their true one. It is only now that
the mystery of his mind is unveiled--that his new-born daring is
accounted for--that he now appears the rational and strong spirit I
had not then regarded him.</p>

<p>We had now, in these rambles, taken, with the exception of a
single one, every possible route, leading into the neighboring
country. Bold and daring as I was, I had always avoided the path
which led to the little islet and the scenes of my crime, though,
certainly without exception, the most beautiful and attractive among
them. This had not escaped his attention--though he had so contrived
it, as not to appear to have a care or even to be conscious, what
route we were to pursue. It now happened, however, that we were
called upon to retread spots which had grown familiar, and more than
once my companion would exclaim--</p>

<p>"Have we not been here before--can we not take some new
direction?"</p>

<p>Still I avoided the route too well known to me, and still he had
not ventured to propose taking it. He would not alarm me by a
suggestion, though one which would have been so perfectly natural. He
took another mode to effect his purpose, and one day, just as we were
about to pass the little hollow in the woods, which led directly upon
the path I so much wished to avoid, he saw, or pretended to see, some
game upon which to exercise his skill, and, without saying more, he
darted into the avenue. I was compelled to follow, and, slowly, and
with feelings I was ashamed to possess, but could not control, I
prepared to call up the whole history of crime and terror, already
sufficiently vivid to the eye of memory. We pursued the devious
route, and once more I found myself retracing a region, which though
for months untrodden, was still as freshly in my recollections, as
when I made it the field of exercise for all the black and blasting
passions running then riot in my soul. On we went from point to
point, of all the places in my memory, each of which had its distinct
association, and spoke audibly to my spirit of some endearment or
reproach, some sorrow or delight. Here was the little lake,--here the
islet where I first discovered her. Here the scene of her dishonor
and of my triumph--here the place of our usual meeting, and here--the
spot upon which she perished under my hands. I strove not to look. I
felt all things too vividly in my soul, and though I closed my eyes,
I could not shut out the images of terror which were momentarily
conjured up by my imagination. I strove to look in all quarters but
in that which witnessed our struggle and my crime, but my eyes
invariably turned at last and settled down on the one spot, where, I
beheld, at length, the distinct outline of her figure, as it had, at
the time, appeared before me. Slowly it seemed to rise from its
recumbent posture, and, while I breathed not, I beheld it proceed
along the road which I had taken, when bearing the inanimate burden
from which that now guiding spirit had forever departed, to its place
of final slumber in the body of the rock, which stood rigidly in the
distance. I followed it, unconsciously, with my eyes. My respiration
had utterly ceased--my hair was moist and active--my lips were
colorless and cold, and my cheeks were ashen. A palsying wind seemed
to penetrate my bones, and though not a joint trembled, yet they were
all powerless. I became conscious at last of my condition and
appearance, from discovering the eyes of Harding anxiously bent upon
mine and following the direction of their gaze. There was something
so expressive--so earnest in his look, that, though yet utterly
unsuspicious of his design, I was nevertheless not a little offended
at his seeming curiosity. I recovered myself on the instant of making
this discovery, and turned round abruptly upon him. As if detected in
some impropriety, his eyes fell from the look which I gave him in
evident confusion; and, without a word, we prepared to proceed in our
ramble. Not willing to suggest a solitary movement while in this
region, which should prompt doubt or inquiry, I left the choice of
road to himself, and saw with some concern that we were now taking
the direct route to the cottage of old Andrews, the father of Emily.
I had no fear of exposure from any such interview, for, I had so
contrived it, that all suspicion was diverted from myself in the
minds of the family. I had busied myself in the little inquiries that
had been made into her fate--had pretended not a small portion of
sorrow and regret--had made sundry presents, which in the depressed
condition in which they lived, had readily contributed still more to
their blindness; and never having been recognized, in the dotage of
the old man, as the boy who had contributed to his first great
misfortune, I had escaped all imputations on the subject of the
second. Besides, I had taken care to visit them frequently, though
privately, for a short period of time after the event, and felt
secure that I had no other position in their regard, than that of
confiding and friendly consideration. But the subject had become
irksome, and, in addition to this fact, I had, for the first time,
perceived in my mind the possibility that my companion, coupling the
conversation of the family, which would most probably turn upon the
fate of their daughter, with my own story, might be enabled to gather
from the particulars such information as would open the trail, and
prepare the way for further evidence. But the cautious policy of
Harding silenced my alarm, and indeed, my great error from the first,
consisted in the humble estimate I had been taught to make of his
character for firmness. There is no greater mistake, than in
despising him to whom you have given a reason to become an enemy.
Where there is mind, contempt will engender malice, and where there
is malice, there is a ceaseless prompter, which one day will couple
the venom with the sting. Self-esteem in exaggerating my own strength
to myself, had also taught me to undervalue that of others--in this
way, I assisted his pursuit, and helped him to his object.</p>

<p>We came soon upon the cottage. The old man sat glowering in
idiotic abstraction in a corner chair, which he kept in a continual
rocking motion. His mind seemed utterly gone, and though he spoke to
both, he appeared to recognize neither of us. His wife was glad to
see me, and thanked me repeatedly for some articles of dress which I
had sent her some months before, since which period, until then, I
had not seen her. An unavoidable association called up the memory of
Emily, and the tears of the old woman were again renewed. Harding
with an air of common-place inquiry, and a manner of the most perfect
indifference, almost amounting to unconsciousness, inquired into the
story to which she had referred, and while she told it as far as it
was known to herself, busied himself in plaiting into something like
form, the remains of a handful of osiers which he had plucked on the
way. His very indifference, had not my fate otherwise ordained,
should have alarmed my watchfulness, so utterly different did it
appear from the emotion which he usually expressed when called to
listen to a narrative so sorrowful and touching. But he heard it, as
if in a dream. His mind seemed wandering, and I was lulled into the
most complete security. Never was indifference so well enacted--never
had mortal been more attentive to a history than Harding to this. All
its details had been carefully treasured up, and where the old lady
had associated me with the adventures of her daughter, his mind had
taken deep note, and the record in his memory was ineradicably
written. Over the chimney place stood a rude portrait of the murdered
girl, to which, when the old lady called for his attention to her
beautiful features, he scarcely gave a glance; and he, whom destiny
selected to bring the murderer of her child to punishment, provoked
openly the anger of the mother, by his glaring inattention to the
story of her supposed fate. We left the cottage after a somewhat
protracted visit. I had no concern--not the slightest apprehension,
so completely had my companion played his part in the
transaction--but he had not lost a word, not a look not an action, in
all the events of that morning. His eye was forever upon me--his
thoughts were dissecting mine, and the most distant association of
cause and effect, drawn vividly together by his intellect, quickened
into sleepless exercise and energy by the influences acting upon it,
supplied him with the materials for commencing the true history of my
crime.</p>

<p>We passed the rock on our return. I could not keep my eyes from
it; and his eyes were on mine. He saw the same ashy paleness of my
cheek and look, and he saw that this rock had something to do with my
history. In the analysis of a story like mine--so terribly romantic
as it was--his imagination became a prime auxiliar, and with its aid,
where a dull man would have paused for fact, with the felicity of
truth, it supplied them, and he grew confident and strong in each
hour of progression in his labor.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>A week from this had not gone by, when, while under the hands of
our village hair-dresser, I beheld a picture crowded among the
hundred upon his walls, which filled me with astonishment, and
awakened in my mind some moving apprehensions. I beheld the scene of
my crime truly done to nature, and just by the little copse upon
which the deed had been committed, stood a female form, pale and
shadowy, and with a sufficient resemblance to Emily, to have been
considered a portrait. You may guess my emotion. Having recovered
from the first shock, I inquired, as if without the desire for an
answer, where he got and who had painted it, and was told in reply
that an old lady had brought it there for sale--the lady was unknown.
Finding the price low--merely nominal, indeed, he had readily bought
it; relying on the merits of the piece to insure it a ready sale. I
affected to be pleased with it and paid him his price. Having secured
it in possession, I examined it closely, and was confirmed in the
opinion that the whole was copied from events in my own history.
Beyond this I could perceive nothing farther. The preparation of the
piece was a mystery, and I had not the courage to seek its
developement. I cut up the tell-tale fabric with my knife, and
witnessed its destruction, fragment by fragment, in the flames. Fool
that I was, I did not dream that the artist had yet other copies. And
so it was--another and another, to the number of three, appeared in
the crowded shop of the hair-dresser. I was too sagacious, however,
to purchase any more. I had begun to tremble! Still I had not the
slightest suspicion of the author, and though my thoughts were
restlessly employed upon the subject, they wandered to all persons
and conjectured all things but the right. Still, daily, did Harding
and myself pursue our rambles, and, each day, through his adroit
ingenuity, yielded something more to the stock of that evidence which
was to overwhelm me. By degrees, he had penetrated in all directions
of that fatal wood; and, at length, our footsteps were bent, as in
the most casual manner, up the steep sides of the rock, and over the
very path, which, burdened with the dead body of Emily Andrews, I had
once journeyed alone. My eyes were again riveted upon that fearful
chasm--I heard the dead fall of her delicate form, as it struck from
side to side in its passage down--I heard the clattering of the
loosened stones which had accompanied and followed her; and, at
length, the same subtle imagination which had revived all the
circumstances vividly before one sense, arrayed her reanimated form
as vividly before another. I saw her arise from the chasm, pale and
ghastly as when I had seen her descend. For a moment the spell of
terror fixed every faculty, and in that moment, the searching glance
of my companion, had gathered much towards the formation of his
testimony. He had followed the direction of my glance, and the chasm,
half concealed in the umbrage, and not very obvious to the gaze, grew
distinctly before him. I recovered from the trance which had for a
time stupified me, and we returned to the village. In a few days
more, and another scene, to me full of fearful meaning was in the
shop of my hair-dresser. There was the rock--there the chasm, and
just above, in a dim haze that made vague the expression and outline,
but did not impair the features, stood the phantom person of Emily,
as my imagination had borne it to my sight but a few days before. Who
was it, that, with so much felicity, could embody my imaginings. I
was thunderstruck, and, through the means of an agent, I secured this
new accuser, and destroyed it in like manner with the former. But
another self made its appearance, and, in despair, I gave up the hope
of arresting, in this way, the progress of that inquiry, which,
taking so equivocal a form, and pursuing a course so mysterious, was
doubly terrible. But Harding, for he was the artist, did not alone
content himself with probing the secrets of my soul, by exercising my
fears and fancies. He privately took his way to the family of the
murdered girl. He ascertained the day and date of her absence--he
took careful note of our association--of the expectations that had
been formed in their minds, not less than in the mind of Emily
herself, from the attentions I had paid her; and though the true
nature of our connexion had been totally unsuspected by the parents,
our intimacy had been such as to warrant a belief, that, in the
progress of events, something must necessarily grow out of it. He
found that we had been almost in the daily habit of meeting, and in
the very wood in which he had first perceived my terrors. He learned,
that, in dragging the stream in its neighborhood, no traces had been
found of the victim--that a search, made shortly after she had been
missing, and on the same day, throughout the country, for many miles,
had been ineffectual. He was conscious that few places of concealment
offered themselves in the circuit so examined, except in the cavity
of rock to which his mind had already adverted; and, associating the
ill disguised apprehension and horror which I had exhibited while
upon it, he came to the rapid conclusion that the mystery was to be
developed there. Yet how was he now to proceed? There was still
something wanting to unite together the several links in the chain of
testimony which he had so assiduously and singularly woven. The
circumstances, though strong, were not at all conclusive against me;
and, having succeeded so poorly in the first instance, and with the
public prejudice so strongly against him, he might well dread the
overthrow of his design, in the event of any premature and partial
development. Though perfectly satisfied that the chasm contained the
remains of the murdered girl, he was yet well convinced how little
the mere development of the body would avail, unless with some
identifying circumstance, fixing the crime upon me. Accordingly, he
devoted himself busily to the task of tracing in the details of the
mother, all the particulars of my intimacy with the daughter. In this
scrutiny he happened upon, read carefully, and copied a single note
having my initials, merely, but without date, which I had sent her,
enclosing some ornaments for her person and engaging to meet her on
some day in the ensuing week. The style of expression was guarded in
the extreme, and indicated the feelings of one who esteemed the
individual he addressed, with a respectful consideration, which
though not love itself, might in time, become so. The absence of a
date, alone, presented a difficulty, which was only overcome, by a
single passage which the note contained. It spoke of pressing
engagements for a term of some weeks which would so occupy the
attention of the writer as to leave him no opportunity of seeing her
for that period unless that which the note suggested was embraced.
What engagements were there of so pressing a character upon me?
Harding knew as well as myself the nature of my employments, and felt
assured that the assertion was either false, or that the note had
been written at the time, when my marriage arrangements had been
made; the only circumstance he conceived likely to have been looked
to in my mind, as calculated to interfere with the pursuit of any
humbler object. This was conjectural, however, yet the conjecture
furnished him with an additional clue which he suffered not to escape
him. The old lady could say nothing as to the period when the note
had been received--but the jewels were shown him, and carefully
noting down their kinds and qualities, he proceeded to the several
shops of our village in which such articles were sold. He inspected
all of corresponding description, and submitting those in question,
he at length found out to whom and when they were sold. The dates
were supplied, and were so far found to correspond with events, that
it was indubitable that but four days after their purchase by myself,
Emily Andrews had been lost to her family. The circumstances were now
almost embodied in the estimation of the law; and assured, but still
unprecipitate, Harding prepared calmly and quietly the whole
narrative, and awaited impatiently the operation of looked for
events, to unfold the entire history. And the time came!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>Fate had me in its power, and I was blind. If I were not weak
enough, of myself, to reveal the secrets of my soul, and its crimes,
I was not less the creature of a destiny, which, in the end, set at
nought my profoundest cunning, and proved my wisdom to be the
arrantest folly. I look back now with wonder at my own stupidity. A
single survey into existing things, as in all other concerns I had
certainly made it, and I should have laughed all inquisition to
scorn. Now, I am its victim--the shallow victim of a most shallow
design. Thus it is, however, that the wisest suffer defeat through a
self-esteem which leads them into wrong, not merely in their estimate
of themselves, but in their estimate of others. Thus was it with me;
and well, from my own experience, may I exclaim with the ancient,
"fata viam invenient."</p>

<p>Yet was I not unwarned--unthreatened. I had a presentiment that
something was to happen--I was uneasy, discontented--wandering. My
spirits were dreadfully depressed, and but half conscious, I took my
way to the secluded cottage of Harding. Unannounced, I entered his
study, and found him--on his knees, at prayer. A strange feeling
possessed me, and I was almost tempted to kneel down beside him. But
I dared not--I had never been taught to worship--I had never been
taught to bend the knee, and tones of supplication were foreign to my
sense and unfamiliar to my lips. Could I have knelt at that moment
and fervently prayed for the grace I had not, I feel satisfied the
heart of my companion would have relented of all its purposes. He
would not, at that moment, have arrested the new-born exercises of a
spirit so redeeming and atoning. The moment of indulgence was
permitted to escape, and the fiat had gone forth. The doom was upon
me!</p>

<p>We sallied forth, as had been, for so long a period, our morning
custom. A grave solemnity marked the expression of Harding's
countenance, mixed, at intervals, as we grew more and more
communicative, with a faltering hesitation of manner, indicating a
relaxing of purpose. I can now comprehend all his feelings and
emotions. His position was, indeed, a strange and sad one. Under a
sense of duty the most sacred, not merely to the community, but to
himself, he had undertaken the punishment of a criminal with whom he
was in the daily habit of close communion--to whom, in worldly
matters, he was somewhat indebted, and in whose welfare, he had at
heart, and sincerely, a deep interest. The task of hypocrisy which he
assumed, sufficiently painful to a mind like his, was doubly irksome
under the operation of such circumstances; and, I am assured that
could he, at that moment, have been persuaded of a change of heart in
me--had I given him the slightest reason to believe that my crimes
were regretted, and that it was my fixed purpose to become a better
man,--he would, even then, just as the curtain was about to be drawn,
which would unveil the whole catastrophe, have stayed his uplifted
hand--he would have rather suffered the tortures of his imagination,
and the rebukes of his ambition, than have cut off the penitent in
his first approaches to pardon and atonement. But, at this moment, I
uttered some vile jest--discreditable to manhood and morality,
alike--and the spell was broken. He was strengthened in his purpose,
and solemnly he led the way, I following, unconsciously, to my own
sacrifice.</p>

<p>A sudden turn brought us directly upon the scene of my crime, and
there, to my surprise, a goodly company were assembled.</p>

<p>"What is this!" was my exclamation. "Why are so many of the
villagers here. Know you what is meant by this assemblage?"</p>

<p>"We shall see!" was his somewhat sudden and stern reply, as we
continued to approach. My heart trembled, and leapt convulsively to
my mouth--my knees faltered, but there was no retreat. We came up to
the company before whom my appearance had scarcely been made, when,
wildly from the group, rushed forth the mother of Emily--she seized
me by my arm.</p>

<p>"Give me back my daughter" was her frenzied exclamation--"you will
not keep her from me. My daughter--my poor sweet Emily."</p>

<p>They dragged her back to the spot, where, feebly and with an
expression of subdued idiocy, old Andrews incessantly shook his stick
in the direction where I stood, while his palsied head maintained a
corresponding motion. I recovered myself, but my tones were husky and
thick, and I am satisfied not so coherent as I could have wished
them.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean, my friends; why this charge upon me--why
this gathering--" was my inquiry.</p>

<p>"This gentleman will explain" said the Justice, pointing to
Harding who had by this time taken a place midway between the company
and myself, "you are charged," continued the officer, "with having
first seduced, then spirited away the daughter of these old people,
one Emily Andrews; and for your sake, Mr. Faber, I sincerely hope
that you may be able to establish your innocence in spite of the
strong circumstances which will be brought against you."</p>

<p>I looked to Harding--I sought to crush him with that look--but he
was untroubled, unappalled beneath it; and, though trembling with
emotion, as seemingly determined in intention, as the martyr,
fortifying if not establishing his faith, by the free offering of his
blood. He proceeded, modestly, but confidently to his narration. He
recounted the history of our intimacy--described once more the
circumstances of the revelation which I had made, in his ears, of my
crime. How it had burned in his heart like so many living coals. How
he had come in his agony to me, and how finally, in order to escape
from the suggestions of torture inflicted by conscience and
imagination, he had revealed it as it had before been heard, to the
officers of justice. He showed how he had been overthrown by the
search made in accordance with the story--how, writhing under the
reproaches of the public and crushed in their opinion, he had been on
the verge of madness and suicide--how I had sought him out in his
closet--repeated my story, and how he had again believed it. A
certain something, he said, assured him that I had told the truth,
but not the whole truth--that I had suppressed and altered, so as to
defeat inquiry; but that, though the causes which had led me to
disclose so much unnecessarily, were unknown and unaccountable, he
was taught to believe in the commission of the crime. A desire to
regain his station in society--to show that nothing of malice had
prompted him in the first instance, inspired him with the design,
which, carried out perseveringly and properly, had resulted in his
being able, he thought, most satisfactorily to prove the murder of
Emily Andrews by Martin Faber, and accordingly, he proceeded to the
development of his particulars. How did I wonder at my own blindness
as he proceeded in his narration. How did I wonder at the ingenuity
with which, without any clue, he had unravelled, as with my own
fingers, all my secret. He had watched all my motions--all my
looks--all my words. He had suffered not a glance--not a whisper to
escape him. With the assistance of his mother, who, herself, in
disguise had sold them to the barber, he had carried on the affair of
the pictures--he discovered who had bought them, and conjecturing for
what purpose, he defied me to produce them. He described the
involuntary terrors which my face had exhibited on approaching the
spot upon which we stood--how the same emotion, so exhibited, had led
him to suspect that the rock to which he pointed had also some
connexion with the transaction. The facts gathered from the
conversations with the family, leading to the final, and, as he
thought, conclusive proof, in reference to the jewelry he next dwelt
upon; and, with a brief but compact summary, he so concentrated the
evidence, that, though strictly speaking, still inconclusive, there
was not an individual present but was persuaded of my guilt.</p>

<p>"And now," said he, "there is but one more witness for
examination, and this is the rock of which I have spoken. I am
persuaded that the body of Emily Andrews lies there. The expression
of Faber's eye--the whole look with which he surveyed the chasm,
could not have come from nothing. That rock, in some way or other, is
associated with his crime. I have made arrangements for its
examination and we shall soon judge."</p>

<p>Placing a little ivory whistle to his lips, a shrill sound went
through the forest, and after the lapse of a moment, a sudden flash
illuminated, and a loud explosion shook the earth around us. We
proceeded to the spot, and when the smoke had cleared away, a shout
from those who traversed the fragments, torn from the fissure which
had been split by gun-powder, announced the discovery of the victim,
and in her hands--conclusive evidence against me--torn from my bosom
without my knowledge, while in the last convulsion of death,--lay the
large brooch, the loss of which had given me so much concern at the
time, and, on its back, chased finely in the gold setting, were the
initials of my name.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p>He came to me in my dungeon--he, my accuser--my enemy--my friend.
In the first emotions of my wrath, I would have strangled him, and I
shook my chains in his face, and I muttered savage curses and deep
threats in his ears. He stood patiently and unmoved. His hands were
clasped, and his eyes were dim, and for a while he had no language,
no articulations.</p>

<p>"Think not," at last he spoke--"think not I have come to this work
with a feeling of satisfaction. I have suffered more agony in its
progress than I can well describe or you understand--I will not
attempt it. If you cannot, from what you know of my character,
conceive the grief and sickness of heart which must have come over
me, during the long period and regular and frequent succession of
hours, in which I was required to play the hypocrite--I cannot teach
it you. I come not for this. I come to ask your forgiveness--to
implore your better opinion--and that you may attribute to a
necessity which gave me no other alternatives than death or shame,
the whole of this painful episode in my life!"</p>

<p>He was a noble creature, and so I could not but think at that very
moment; but, I was of the earth, earthy! I was a thing of
comprehensive malignity, and my impulses were perpetually warring
with the suggestions of my sense.</p>

<p>"My death be upon your head--my ignominy be yours--the curses of
all of mine be on you--may all things curse you. Talk of my being a
murderer, are you less so? Have you not hurried me to death--a
shameful death--dishonoring myself, dishonoring my family, when I
might have atoned for the error of my youth, in the progress and
better performances of my age? Hypocrite, that you are, begone! Come
not falsely now to extenuate what you may not excuse--your priestly
cant about forgiveness does not deceive me. Away--I curse you to the
last!"--and his head sunk upon his breast, and his hands were clasped
in agony, and I exulted in the writhing and gnawing of that heart,
whose over-delicate structure, I well knew, could never sustain such
reproaches.</p>

<p>"Spare me, spare me! As I live you do me wrong. Be not so
merciless--so unforgiving. Fame, and the world's good opinion, were
to me the breath of life. I could not have done other than I did and
lived--I could not."</p>

<p>"Looked you then to me to do it? Was the world's good opinion
nothing to me? Had I nothing to live for? Had I no aim in life?
Oh--away! I sicken but to see you!"</p>

<p>Patiently, amidst all my reproaches, he persisted in the endeavour
to conciliate my fiendish mood, suggesting a thousand excuses and
reasons, for the obvious duty which I myself felt he had done to
himself and to society--but I rejected them all, and, in despair, he
was about to retire, when a sudden thought came over me.</p>

<p>"Stay, Harding--there is one thing--there is one way in which I
can be assured that your motive was not malicious, and that you have
been stimulated as you say, solely by a belief in the necessity of
what you have done!"</p>

<p>"Speak--say, any thing, but grant me your forgiveness--give me
your good opinion!"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous! the good opinion of a murderer--the hated, the
despised of the community;--of what good is it to you or to any
body?"</p>

<p>"True--true!--but even with the murderer I would be at peace--I
would not have him die with an ill feeling towards me. But there is
yet another thought which prompts the desire in his case. It is from
my associate and companion that I would have forgiveness, for the
violation of that confidence which grew out of that association. For
this I would have your forgiveness!"</p>

<p>"The distinction is somewhat nice, but you shall have what you
ask--cheerfully have it--upon one condition!"</p>

<p>"What is that, say on--I will gladly serve you."</p>

<p>"Justice demands a victim and I must die; but it is not necessary
to justice that I should die in a particular manner. I would not die
by the rope, in the presence of a gaping multitude--you must provide
me with a dagger--a knife, any thing by which I may free myself from
the ignominy of such a death."</p>

<p>"Impossible! that will be wrong--it will be criminal. Justice, it
is true, may not care whether the rope or the steel shall serve her
purposes, but she requires that her officer, at least, shall do it;
otherwise it is not her act. It is your will, not hers, that would be
performed--her claim would be defeated."</p>

<p>"Shallow sophistry!--this then is your friendship--but I knew it
would be so--away, and may--"</p>

<p>He stopped me in my curse.--</p>

<p>"Stay!"--he exclaimed hurriedly, and with terror--"any thing but
that. I will do as you require."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p>The day of retribution--of a fearful trial, is come!--Horrible
mockery!--the sunlight streams through the iron grating, and falls
upon the straw of this accursed dungeon. How beautifully--how
wooingly it looks--lovelier than ever, about to be forever lost! Do I
tremble--would I yet live and linger out the years in a life of
curses, among those who howl their denunciations forever in my ears?
Could I survive this exposure, this infamy, and cherish life on any
terms and at all hazards! I would not die--not thus, not thus--on
that horrible scaffolding, I shudder but to think on. Yet what hope
would I rely upon? I have none to whom in this perilous hour, I would
turn in expectation. No fond spirit now labors, unsleepingly, for my
relief. I have not lived for such an interest--I have not sought to
enlist such affections--none hope--none seek my escape--none would
assist in its consummation! I am alone--I must die!--and
what,--horrible thought!--if he should not bring the weapon?--if his
shrinking and woman-like conscience should scruple, thus, to
interfere with the decree of justice, and I should be led out in the
accursed cart, through the jeering multitude, and go through all the
trials of that death of shame and muscular agony!--let me not think
of it. Let me not think!--</p>

<p>And I closed my eyes as if to shut out thought, and rushed to the
extremest corner of my cell, despairing of the appearance of Harding
with the dagger he had promised. But a few hours were left, and the
sharp and repeated strokes of the hammer, at a little distance,
indicated the rapid progress of the executioner in his preparations
for the terrible performance of his office. I groaned in my agony of
thought, and buried my head still deeper in the meshes of my
couch.--Thanks, thanks--the fates be praised--he comes--the bolts
shoot back--the doors are unbarred--he is here! I live again--I shall
not stand then on that fearful fabric. He brings me that which shall
enable me to give it my defiance, and disappoint the gaping
multitude, already beginning to assemble. I shall defeat them
still!</p>

<p>"Oh, Harding--I had almost given you up--I had begun to
despond--to despair. I dreaded that the weakness of your spirit had
yielded to your conscience, and that you had forgotten your pledge.
God of terror! what a horrible agony the thought brought along with
it. It is well you came; I had else cursed you with spectres that
would have fastened on you like wolves. They would have drained the
blood, at the same moment, from all the arteries in your system. Give
me the knife."</p>

<p>"It is here, and, oh, Martin--I have had a terrible struggle with
my own sense of what is right in the performance of this office. I
have resisted the suggestions of conscience--I have overcome the
rebukes of my own mind--I have done wrong, and do not seek to excuse
myself--but I have brought you what you desired. Here, take it, take
it at once and quickly before I repent me of having so weakly yielded
in the struggle."</p>

<p>"I have it--I have it!" I shouted wildly--shaking the naked blade
as if in defiance, in the direction of the scaffold. "I am secure
from that shame--I shall not be the capped and culprit thing of
ignominy which they would make me, in the eyes of that morbid rabble.
I am free from the dishonor of such a death. Ah, Harding, thou hast
almost redeemed thy fault--thou hast almost taught me to forgive thee
for thy offending. Nay--I could almost forbear to howl my curses in
thy ears, and avoid saying to thee, as I do--may the furies tug at
thy vitals, like snakes, in all hours--"</p>

<p>"Forbear, forbear!" he shrieked--"oh, cruel; wantonly cruel as
thou art--where is thy promise, Martin--where is thy honor--wilt thou
deceive me?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!--fool that thou art--didst thou not deceive and
betray me? Where was thy honor, false hypocrite--where was thy
forbearing mercy? Wert thou not cruel, wantonly cruel then? Hell's
curses be upon thee--I would have thee live forever to enjoy
them--thou shouldst have an eternity of torment--thou shouldst have
an exaggerated sense of life for its better appreciation.
Forbearance, indeed! No--I would invent a curse for thee that--and
ha! thou art come in season, at the fit moment, to be my help in
imprecation. Come forward--thou has lips would make an oath tell--and
tell to the quick. Come hither, come hither, my Constance!"</p>

<p>And he dragged forward the young and terrified wife, who had just
then made her appearance in the dungeon, and forcing her upon her
knees before him, he stood over her, waving the gleaming dagger in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt kneel, Constance!--it is a solemn moment, and thou
hast that to perform which requires that word and action should well
suit its solemnity. Ay, fold thy hands upon thy breast--yet I ask
thee not to pray--thou must curse and not pray. Speak then as I tell
thee--speak and palter with me not, for, doomed as I am to death, and
hopeless of escape, as I have nothing now to hope, I have nothing now
to apprehend from man. Speak after me, then, as thou hast a love for
life--as thou hast a leading and a lasting terror of a horrible
death!"</p>

<p>Agonized with the situation of Constance, Harding advanced to
interfere, but with a giant-like strength, the criminal hurled him
back with a single arm, while he threatened, if he again approached,
to bury the weapon in the bosom of the kneeling and terror-stricken
woman. On a sudden, she recovered her energies, and in coherent but
feeble tones, she called upon her husband to proceed.</p>

<p>"It is well thou art thus docile. Thou art wise, Constance--thou
art obedient, as thou hast ever been. Keep thy hands folded, and
speak after me--say, in thy wonted manner to thy God--bid him hearken
to thy prayer--bid him, in tenderness and love for thee, to grant it
as thou makest it. Promise him largely of thy increased love and
obedience for this. Promise him thy exclusive devotion--say thou wilt
live only for him; and strive to forget all the other attractions,
whatever they may be, of life and society. I care not if thou keepest
these pledges, it is enough for me that thou makest them."</p>

<p>She did as she was required. She implored the Father, fervently to
sanction the prayer she was about to make--she vowed her whole love
and duty, in return, so far as her poor capacities would permit,
entirely to him. She spoke in the fullness of accumulated feelings,
and with a devotion as deep and touching, as it was tearless and
dignified.</p>

<p>"Well--that is enough. Thou hast been as liberal in promises, as I
could well desire thee; and now for the prayer and petition thou hast
to offer. Look on this man--the murderer of thy husband--the wretch,
who, wouldst thou believe it, my Constance, has the audacity to have
a love even for thee, in his cruel heart--the wretch, whom--thou wilt
be slow to think so, my Constance, but it is true--whom thou dost
love--"</p>

<p>She looked up to him, as he proceeded, with a most imploring
expression--but he had no touch of pity in his soul. He
proceeded--</p>

<p>"It is true, and you dare not deny it, my Constance. You love the
wretch who has murdered your husband, and, perhaps, when my bloody
grave, which his hands have dug, has been well covered over, you will
take shelter in his bosom--"</p>

<p>The wretched woman shrieked in agony, and fell at length upon the
floor--but he allowed her no respite. After a few moments, making her
resume her position upon her knees, he continued--</p>

<p>"Him, thou must curse! Say after me--God of heaven and earth, if
thou be, as thou art said to be, just in thy provisions--Say on!"</p>

<p>She repeated: He went on.--</p>

<p>"If the power be in thee, as I believe, to do the will of thy
creatures on earth--"</p>

<p>She repeated.</p>

<p>"If thou canst curse and bless--build up and destroy--yield
pleasure or pain--make happy or miserable--"</p>

<p>She repeated.</p>

<p>"I call upon thee, with thy agents and ministering powers to curse
with thy eternal wrath--to blister with thy unceasing severities--to
torture with thy utmost varieties of pain--to make sore the body--to
make bitter the life--to make wretched the spirit--to pursue at all
seasons and in all lands, with thy unceasing and most aggravated
asperities, this bloody man, the destroyer of my husband."</p>

<p>The youth, upon whom this imprecation was to fall, rushed
forward--</p>

<p>"Speak it not! oh, speak it not, lady!--in charity speak it not. I
can bear with the curse from his lips--from any lips--but thine.
Sanction not, I pray you, this wantoness of cruelty--pardon rather,
and forgive me that I have been the unwilling, and, in all times, the
sad instrument of Providence in this proceeding."</p>

<p>"Back, back, William Harding--the curse must be uttered--it must
be felt--it must be borne. Speak on, Constance Faber--speak on--as I
have told it thee." She looked up in his face with the calm
resignation of a saint--and, as one entering upon the pilgrimage of
martyrdom, she proceeded regularly in the formula, sentence after
sentence, which he had prescribed; while he, standing above, muttered
his gratification as every added word seemed to arouse new agonies in
the bosom of the denounced. But, as she reached the part assigned to
the application of the curse, she entreated these curses upon the
head of Constance Faber, if she should ever teach her lips to invoke
other than blessings upon any being of the human family, whatever, in
the sight of heaven or of earth, his offence might be! The glare from
the eyes of the disappointed criminal was that of a hyena, robbed of
his prey. A malignant shriek burst from his lips, as, with uplifted
arm and furious stroke, he aimed the weapon at her bosom. Harding
sprang forward, but the weapon, as she swooned away from the blow,
had penetrated her side. The youth, with unlooked for power, tore her
from his grasp, before his blow could be repeated, and bore her out
of his reach to the opposite part of the cell. The keeper and his
assistants rushed in upon the prisoner. As they approached, he aimed
the bloody dagger at his own bosom, but, at that instant, fear came
over his heart--the fates had paralyzed him--he was a coward! he
shrunk back from the stroke and the dagger fell from his hands.
Without difficulty he was in a moment secured. Constance was but
slightly wounded, yet happily, enough so, to be entirely ignorant of
the horrors of the scene so malignantly forced upon her. In his cell,
the wretch howled over the unperforming weakness of his hand, which
had not only failed to secure him his victim, but had left him
without the ability to defeat his doom.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>"The hour is come! O cursed weakness, that I should fail at that
moment of escape--But the fates had written it--I must fulfil my
destiny. My eyes grow dim--I fail to see any longer the crowd--all is
confused and terrible. What spectres are these that surround me? It
is Emily,--and why does the old father shake his palsied hand in my
face--will no one keep off the intruders?--they have no concern here.
I have raved--but now all is before me. What a multitude--does this
suffering of a fellow creature give them pleasure! Should I ask--I
who have lived in that enjoyment! Would I had also been weak; I
should have escaped this exposure--this pain. It is but for a moment,
however--but a momentary thrill; and then--fate will have no secrets.
I shall no longer be its blind victim--its slave. There is an old man
at the foot of the scaffold, that I would not see there! It is old
Andrews. Would he were gone--or that I could look elsewhere. But no
matter--it will soon be over. I would I had a God at this
moment--better to have believed--on earth there is nothing for
me--such a faith, though folly, had been grateful. But now--now it is
too late. The hour is come!--The sunlight and the skies are
gone--gone--gone--gone."</p>
