<h1>No 11 Welham Square</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Herbert Stephen</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>We were sitting in the drawing-room of our house at Bayswater one
evening after dinner, in high good-humour. I had that day been
appointed to a certain post at the British Museum which would afford
me ample opportunity for the studies in which I was most interested,
and put me in possession of what I expected to find an ample
competence. We had been talking over my prospects, and the only cloud
I could discern upon the horizon was that I should have to be at my
post at an earlier hour in the morning than was comfortably
compatible with the three-mile walk from our house to the Museum.</p>

<p>"What a pity," said my youngest sister Patricia, "that we don't
still live in the dear old house in Welham Square! You could have got
to the Museum from there in five minutes."</p>

<p>I was born after we left Welham Square, but Patricia was six years
my senior, and could remember her nursery days there.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said my father, very abruptly; "the walk will do you
all the good in the world."</p>

<p>As the old gentleman had been, to all appearance, fast asleep for
at least ten minutes, I was rather surprised at the energy with which
he spoke. Looking up, I saw my mother making anxious signals to
Patricia, which she followed up by instantly changing the
subject.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, as I descended reluctantly into the bowels
of the earth at the Edgware Road Metropolitan Station, on the way to
my new work for the first time, this episode recurred to my mind, and
I began to speculate upon what might be the reasons that made the
mention of Welham Square distasteful to my parents. I determined to
consult my eldest sister Ellen on the subject, and from her, and some
other sources, I gradually accumulated the facts which I will present
here in the form of a continuous narrative.</p>

<p>No. 11 Welham Square has always been the freehold property of my
family. It was built, together with several adjoining houses, about
the beginning of the eighteenth century by the owner of a plot of
land in which the houses stand, a retired attorney, who had two
nephews.</p>

<p>These were Andrew Masey, my great-great-great-grandfather, and his
cousin, Ronald Masey.</p>

<p>Ronald, who was generally thought to be his uncle's favourite, and
probable heir, was an exceedingly tall and powerful young man, with a
forbidding and melancholy expression of coun-tenance.</p>

<p>As a boy he was singularly backward, and his incapacity for mental
exertion seemed to develop, as he grew up, into something not far
removed from downright idiocy. His weakness of mind caused him to be
remarkably subject to the influence of those with whom he lived, and
in particular his cousin Andrew, my ancestor, was supposed to
exercise over him an influence almost amounting to fascination, and
to be able to mould him to all the purposes of an exceptionably
vigorous will. Shortly after the building of the houses in what is
now Welham Square, the uncle of these young men died, and Andrew took
possession of all his property under the provisions, as he asserted,
of a will, the existence of which no one except Ronald had any
interest in disputing, and which no one except Andrew, the sole
executor and devisee, ever saw.</p>

<p>Shortly before his uncle's death, Ronald had become engaged to a
young lady named Lettice White, to whom he was passionately attached,
and it was generally supposed among the neighbours that upon his
accession to the avuncular wealth the marriage would take place. But
when a barely decent interval had occurred since the old gentleman's
obsequies, the fair Lettice was led to the altar, not by the
impecunious Ronald, but by his more fortunate cousin Andrew.</p>

<p>The newly married pair took up their residence in No. 11, and
Ronald came to live with them.</p>

<p>When it was represented to Andrew by some of his few intimate
acquaintances that this arrangement was so singular as almost to be
thought improper, he curtly gave them to understand that Ronald's
mental condition was not such as to permit of his only living
relation allowing him to live alone, and that he was compelled by the
merest considerations of family affection to take the unfortunate
young man into his own household. So the three lived on in the
stately and somewhat gaunt mansion, Andrew collecting his rents with
methodical regularity, and otherwise giving his neighbours but little
concern. As for Ronald, there soon came to be little doubt in
anyone's mind of his confirmed imbecility. He appeared seldom, and
when he did, was for the most part silent, regarding his cousin and
former betrothed with an expression of the profoundest submission,
which at times merged into a look of wild and hardly human
apprehension, "like a terrified brute-beast," as it was put by an old
lady who was one of the few friends occasionally privileged to
partake of the gloomy hospitality of this uncomfortable
establishment. Nothing more was ever known of the condition in which
my ancestor, his wife, and his cousin lived, and no one was specially
interested when, about six years after the marriage, Ronald, who had
not been seen for many months, died, and was buried in a frugal
manner.</p>

<p>Before he had been dead a year, Andrew and Lettice suddenly left
their house and took up their abode elsewhere, and after a while a
tenant was found for No. 11 Thirty years later, the lease of the
house having expired, Andrew's son, who had succeeded to his father's
property, came to reside there, but not for long. He left the house
suddenly after a few years, and a rumour went abroad that it was
haunted, probably by the ghost of the unfortunate Ronald. From this
time No.</p>

<p>11 descended from father to son, the adjoining property being sold
piecemeal as the family necessities dictated. Occasionally the
successive freeholders made attempts to live there, but they never
stayed more than a few months, and on each occasion of their removal
the rumours of ghostly possession were renewed. These, however, would
die away, and tenants would after a time be found, who never suffered
from any inconvenience. The last occupation by the owner was that of
my father, who moved into the house when my sister Patricia was a
little girl. After living there a year he left precipitately, but
Ellen could give me no particulars of his reasons for doing so, and
knew only that he disliked any reference to the house, and never
mentioned it himself. The house was now let to a stockbroker with a
family.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>Five years had elapsed since the conversation I related at the
beginning of the previous chapter.</p>

<p>My parents had both died, and Patricia was married and living with
her husband in a provincial town. My career at the Museum had been a
prosperous one, and I was now entrusted with a more responsible and
better paid office. The tenant of No. 11 Welham Square had just given
me notice of his intention to depart from it, and it occurred to me
that it would be interesting to follow what seemed to be the family
destiny, and try living in the house myself, to say nothing of the
fact that it was admirably suited to my requirements. I felt fully
capable of confronting any number of ghosts, and my wife was neither
timid nor superstitious. Accordingly at the beginning of the new year
we established ourselves, with our two babies, and my sister Ellen,
who lived with us, in Welham Square, greatly delighted with the
proximity of my work, with the solid masonry, spacious apartments,
and roomy passages of our new abode, and with the remnant of
eighteenth-century fashion and grandeur which seemed to pervade the
neighbourhood. And in Welham Square we lived prosperously, without
any kind of disturbance, for upwards of six months.</p>

<p>In the course of July my wife and the children left home to spend
a couple of months at the seaside. I intended to join them when the
time came to take my holiday, and in the meantime I stayed in London,
going daily to my work. Ellen stayed on with me to keep house in the
absence of her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>One evening, four or five days after my wife's departure, I was
sitting in my study, a large room with a door leading into the
drawing-room, and a heavy curtain hung over my side of the door. It
was past eleven; my sister had retired half an hour before, and the
two maids who were left in the house were presumably in bed and
asleep. I was therefore surprised to hear heavy and somewhat slow
footsteps, apparently those of a large man, ascending the stairs from
the ground-floor.</p>

<p>The front door I knew was locked and chained, nor had I heard
anyone ring. The steps paused for a moment on the landing outside my
door, and then I heard the intruder proceed to go up the next flight
of stairs leading to the bedrooms on the second floor. I sprang up,
seized a candle, and opened the door. As I stood on the threshold of
my room I seemed to hear footsteps, as of a man heavily mounting the
stairs at the top of the flight leading up from my door. But, though
I held the light above my head, I could see no one. Everything wore
its usual aspect. I walked quickly up the stairs, but nobody was
visible. I searched all the empty rooms, but with no result. I called
up Ellen and the maids, but none of them had seen or heard anything.
I am ashamed to say that I made a specially rigorous investigation of
a large room at the back of the house, which we used for a night
nursery, and which tradition declared to have been the abode of my
ill-fated kinsman Ronald Masey. I then went downstairs and completed
my search of the entire premises. Everything was in order, and at the
end of an hour I went back to my study and my book, rather annoyed
with myself for having spent so much time in so fruitless an
exploration, and determined to think nothing more about the
matter.</p>

<p>It was the next night after this that I suddenly started up very
wide awake with a conviction that somebody was in my bedroom. I
seemed to hear still ringing in my ears the sound of a long-drawn
human sigh. I sat up, trembling with excitement, and looked about in
the dim twilight of dawn in late July. I could see no one, but I did
not feel alone. The feeling of suspense became unbearable. I jumped
out of bed, and walked with nervous determination to the window,
where I turned round and faced the room, such light as there was
being behind me. I saw no one. Again I walked across the room, and as
I did so I felt unmistakably that wave of air that meets one walking
in the streets when someone on foot passes close to him in the
opposite direction. I seemed to feel the light graze of a passing
substance against my nightgown. I was dimly conscious of a faint,
indescribable odour, calling up recollections of a time of life long
but indefinitely past. And while I stood fixed to the spot with
surprise and horror, my heart beating violently, I heard distinctly
four long heavy steps passing from me towards the window. The floor
creaked under their weight. The next instant I felt that I was alone.
But it was not until long after the morning was as light as noon that
I fell asleep again.</p>

<p>I awoke much troubled in mind, and doubting whether I should not,
like my fathers, be compelled to leave this uncanny dwelling; but
when in some measure restored by breakfast, I determined to say
nothing to my sister at present, but to wait and see whether the
situation would in any way develop itself. My resolution was fated to
be put to the test sooner than I expected.</p>

<p>I did not get home that evening till close upon dinner-time. When
I entered the drawing-room Ellen greeted me with, "Oh, Edward! What
do you think has happened? Sikes is dead!".Now Sikes was a grey
parrot belonging to my wife. He was so called because when he first
came to us it was affirmed of him, perhaps rather libellously, that,
like the hero of Mr.</p>

<p>Calverley's poem, he "habitually swore." He certainly did from
time to time blaspheme somewhat unreservedly.</p>

<p>I was secretly not altogether sorry to hear of his demise. So I
answered with much composure, "Did the cat eat him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ellen, "he died in the most horrible convulsions."</p>

<p>I went up to get ready for dinner, thinking more of how to prevent
my wife from replacing Sikes by another clamorous bird than of the
manner of the lost one's death, but in the course of our meal it
occurred to me that his fate was an odd one.</p>

<p>"How did Sikes come to have convulsions?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, it was most curious," answered Ellen. "I was going to tell
you about it. I was in the drawing-room writing letters, and suddenly
I heard a tremendous screaming and flapping, and I looked up, and
there was Sikes turning over and over in the air, and pecking, and
clawing, and flapping his wings, and screaming, and before I could
get to him he suddenly twisted his head right round two or three
times, and tumbled down dead on the floor."</p>

<p>"But do you mean," I said, "that he was carrying on these
gymnastics up in the air?"</p>

<p>"Yes; when I saw him he was quite up above his cage, which was on
the little table, and in his struggles he must have wrung his own
neck."</p>

<p>"That seems rather remarkable."</p>

<p>"Yes; and another remarkable thing was that he must have opened
the door of his cage and got out all by himself, which I never heard
of his doing before, because I had been feeding him with cake after
lunch, and I know the door was fastened then. I found it open when he
was dead."</p>

<p>"Had he been out long?"</p>

<p>"No. He must have been seized almost directly he got out, because
it so happened that about five minutes before he began to scream, I
fancied I heard the door open, and looked up to see if anyone was
coming in, and no one was there, but I happened to see the parrot,
and he was in his cage just as usual."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I suppose he's dead, and there's an end of it;
but it is a very singular catastrophe. I hope Marion won't be
inconsolable."</p>

<p>During the rest of dinner I was conscious of being rather poor
company. Following close upon the mysterious occurrences I have
described, Sikes's unhappy fate troubled me. My suspicions were,
however, so undefined, and seemed even to me, when I tried to
contemplate them from an impartial point of view, so ridiculous, that
I could not bring myself to communicate them to Ellen, and incur the
contempt which would be the deserved portion of a grown-up man who
confessed to being seriously disturbed by an odd sound in an empty
house, and by a commonplace nightmare. I have no hesitation in
revealing these sentiments now that subsequent events have justified
them. But that evening I again determined to wait. I did not have to
wait long.</p>

<p>It was a cold evening, and, after bidding good-night to my sister,
I lighted a fire in my study and sat down to enjoy a new novel I had
long been wishing to read. I was about halfway through my volume when
I suddenly felt a sensation of cold. I looked up. The fire was
burning brightly, but I did not feel its warmth. It was as though
some opaque body, or a large glass screen, had been interposed
between me and it. A moment afterwards I felt the heat fall on my
face again.</p>

<p>Had I heard the muffled sound of a footstep on the hearth-rug
close to me? I put out my hand and felt nothing but the warmth of the
fire. As I gazed about the room in surprise my eye fell on an
armchair standing on the other side of the fire. It was a nearly new
chair, which I had bought shortly after coming to Welham Square. It
had a leather seat, smooth and unworn, with particularly good and
yielding springs. Hung upon its back was an antimacassar, worked
aesthetically in crewels. As I looked at this chair it struck me that
the seat was considerably depressed, as though some one had recently
sat down upon it, and the seat had failed to resume its ordinary
level. This surprised me, for I had sat in the chair that morning and
felt sure the springs had then been in good order. I looked at the
antimacassar. Towards the top it was pushed up in wrinkles. As I
looked, it occurred to me that it was impossible for it to hang in
such a manner by itself. It looked for all the world as if an
invisible but substantial human frame was then actually sitting in
the chair. When this notion occurred to me, I sat dazed with an
indescribable horror, staring stupidly at the chair, which did not
move. In an access of frenzied terror, I hurled the book I was
reading at the chair. Did it strike the seat, or did it glance away a
few inches from the edge and fall on the hearth-rug? The next instant
the seat of the chair rose up audibly to its normal level, and the
antimacassar fell out into its usual folds, still preserving,
however, the traces of its previous wrinkles. I started up, and
rushing to the chair, began to prod it. I could discover nothing
unusual in its condition. As I was doing so I felt a hand, beyond all
doubt, laid steadily on my shoulder. I faced round and saw nothing.
"Who are you?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" But no answer came. I was alone.</p>

<p>I sat cogitating till one o'clock, and then I went to bed. Just as
I was getting into bed it occurred to me that perhaps I might be
annoyed in the dark, and though I had not yet seen anything, the
prospect seemed rather awful, and with a slightly trembling hand I
lighted a night-light.</p>

<p>When I had done so, and got into bed, I was rather disposed to be
ashamed of myself, and thought I would put it out, but, partly no
doubt from a disinclination to get out of bed, I determined that in
any case it would do no harm, and that I would leave it as it was. It
occurred to me what an odd thing it is that one feels safer in bed
than anywhere else, whereas in fact one is never in a more
defenceless situation. Then I went to sleep.</p>

<p>I do not know what time I woke. It seemed to me that the air was
blowing in upon my chest where the bedclothes should have covered me
up. And--yes, certainly there was an odd depression in my pillow,
close in front of my face, as if some heavy weight were pressing it
down. I put up my hand to investigate. I touched something on the
pillow. I caught hold of it, and turned cold with terror. For I held
tightly in my hand, another hand, neither cold nor warm, but large
and solid. My light was still burning, and there was no one to be
seen. The hand was suddenly jerked away from me. I sprang out of bed,
and rushed to the fireplace with a despairing feeling that someone
followed close behind me. I seized the poker, turned round, and
struck wildly at the air. Whether I hit anything or not I do not
know. I remember only that as I was recovering myself from a frantic
lunge at nothing, I received a sharp and stunning blow on the back of
my head. When I came to myself it was six in the morning, and I was
lying on the floor where I had fallen. The night-light was out, and
the morning sunlight was streaming in at my window. There was a very
large and painful bruise where I had been struck.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>I felt that this was getting beyond a joke. It was all very well
to frighten me, but when my ghostly enemy took to knocking me down
like a ninepin, I was not going to keep it to myself any longer. I
had no intention of surrendering, for the blood of the Maseys was up,
and the fact that each of my ancestors since the house was built had
sooner or later evacuated the premises made me all the more
determined not to be driven away without making some further
resistance. So I revealed to my sister Ellen the whole of my
experience in the matter. She was decidedly sceptical about the
ghost, if ghost it could be called, and suggested that I was not
well. I vowed that I was as well as any man with a great hole in the
back of his head could be, and she consented to the arrangement that
I proposed--that she should sit up for a night or two in the
drawing-room, while I was in my study, with the door open between us,
and that if any remarkable incident occurred, I should call her in.
In order not to be wholly without male assistance in case I should be
attacked, I invited a college friend of mine named Prescott, a
strong, sensible, and energetic young doctor who lived near us, to
keep my sister company in the drawing-room. He, when he heard my
story, was, as befitted a scientific young professional man,
exceedingly facetious at my expense, but he willingly consented to
share our watch, and to sleep in the house. That evening I sat up as
usual in my study, while Prescott and Ellen beguiled the hours in the
drawing-room with light literature, until about half-past two, when,
nothing having occurred, we settled to go to bed, and separated;
Prescott divided between high spirits at the temporary triumph of
incredulity, and a tinge of disappointment at the non-occurrence of
anything in the shape of a row, and Ellen rather indignant with me
for having kept her up so long to no purpose. After the stormy
experiences of the two preceding nights I thoroughly enjoyed an
unbroken sleep.</p>

<p>I prevailed upon my sister and my friend to give the ghost one
more chance, and the next evening saw us again comfortably
established in the two rooms, separated only by the curtain which
hung over the door of communication.</p>

<p>It may have been eleven o'clock when I heard a board creak just
behind my chair. Uttering a shout, I sprang up, and dashed at the
spot from which the noise had come. I came into heavy contact with
what felt like a gigantic human figure. Prescott and Ellen hurried
into the room and beheld me wildly grappling, apparently with nothing
at all. "By Jove!" said Prescott, "he has got them." "Them" I believe
meant some kind of hallucinations upon which Prescott professed to be
an authority, but I was struggling furiously with my unseen
antagonist, and had no breath for explanations.</p>

<p>"Seize him! seize him!" I cried.</p>

<p>At that moment my prey burst from me, hurling me with prodigious
violence across the room.</p>

<p>Prescott rushed forward, and as he did so was tripped up by what
he afterwards described as a heavy kick from an unseen foot, and sent
sprawling on the floor. Fortunately I was prostrate at the other end
of the room, and could not be suspected of having had a hand, or a
foot, in this outrage.</p>

<p>As we struggled to our feet, while Ellen stared wildly about, we
all heard two or three hurried steps, as of a man running; there was
a tremendous crash, and all was still. But the curtains had swung
violently back into the window, and the window itself, plate-glass,
frame, and all, was burst clean away outwards.</p>

<p>Prescott was as white as a sheet, and the sensible and
strong-minded Ellen was actually crying, which impressed me more than
anything else in the scene.</p>

<p>"Let us leave this horrible house," she said; "something worse
will happen if we stay."</p>

<p>But I was filled with an unreasonable kind of courage at having,
as it seemed, put our inexplicable visitor to flight; and I was
besides conscious of a certain degree of pride in the assurance that
Prescott had been converted, and would hardly talk again about my
having "got them."</p>

<p>"We can't go tonight," I said, "and as our gentleman seems to have
taken himself off for the present, we had better consider what's to
be done next. I am sure Prescott wants to stay and investigate the
phenomenon."</p>

<p>We shut the shutters over the wreck of the window, and sat talking
over the event until late at night. By degrees I contrived to infuse
into my companions some of my courage, and at last, no further
disturbance having taken place, we all went to bed in pretty good
spirits. I placed a loaded double-barrelled pistol on the table by my
bedside, thinking that if a ghost could be struggled with, he ought
to be able to be shot, and Prescott placed within reach a large
bowie-knife, which he had brought back from America, and had long
been wishing for an opportunity to make use of.</p>

<p>When I woke I thought my last hour had come. My throat was tightly
grasped by two extremely strong hands. A crushing weight was on my
chest. I tried to shout, but could not. I was rapidly being
strangled. And as I lay writhing, my eyes, forced half out of their
sockets, glared through the light of the night-light at the opposite
wall, which looked precisely as usual, except that, as the squeezing
of my throat grew more and more intolerable, my view of the room
slowly darkened. But of the horrible and only too palpable from that
was killing me I could see no trace.</p>

<p>In unavailing despair I clutched at the iron wrists that held me
down. In another moment I believe I should have become unconscious.
Then, a last gleam of hope, the thought of my pistol, flashed through
my mind. I stretched out my hand, and as I lay I could just reach the
end of the barrel. I drew it towards me, and with an expiring effort
pushed the muzzle of it close against what I took to be the invisible
body of my tormentor, and fired. We never found the bullet, or any
trace of it afterwards. Instantly the hands relaxed their grip on my
throat a little, and with a violent effort I wrenched my neck away;
then a heavy body fell sideways from my bed to the ground, and I fell
too, grappling with it. At that moment Ellen and Prescott, who had
been aroused by the sound of the shot, burst into the room. There
they saw me struggling, partly on the floor, and partly kneeling
apparently on space. They rushed to my assistance. Both of them felt
the thing, both of them grappled with it. The struggles of our enemy
became fainter.</p>

<p>Managing to get one hand free I repossessed myself of the pistol,
which had fallen on the floor, and emptied the second barrel into
what I judged to be the breast of the spectre. I fired straight
downwards, apparently at the floor, but of that bullet we saw no more
than of the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prescott stabbed furiously with the bowie-knife, and
each time he dashed the blade down its progress was arrested before
it reached the carpet. Then the struggles ceased, and nothing was
heard except our rapid panting. We were all kneeling on and holding
down what looked like space, and felt like the form of a tall and
athletic man.</p>

<p>"We've done for it, whatever it is," said I hoarsely.</p>

<p>Prescott burst into a foolish giggle. "By Jove!" he said, "we'll
make a cast of it and see what it's like."</p>

<p>As he spoke the form of our victim was agitated by a desperate
convulsion, which shook us all off. Before we could seize it again a
deep groan burst from the place where we had held it, and the word
"Lettice!" rang through the room in a tone of sepulchral melancholy.
Then there was silence.</p>

<p>I threw myself on the floor--not, as I had intended, on the
prostrate figure. We searched the room, and then the house, but we
could find absolutely nothing. Nor from that day to this has anyone,
to the best of my knowledge, seen, heard, or felt anything whatever
of this ghastly being.</p>

<p>After much consideration we determined to keep the adventure to
ourselves, for a time at any rate. Indeed, it was only last summer,
when we had lived in the house for a good number of years without any
kind of ghostly interruption, that I described the circumstances
herein narrated to my wife. She doesn't believe them, and I am sorry
I told her.</p>

<p>Was it the ghost of Ronald Masey? Did it voluntarily depart and
leave us alone because it considered that the annoyances it had
inflicted upon my ancestors and me were sufficient, and that the tale
of its vengeance upon our house, for the wrongs, whatever they were,
inflicted upon Ronald in his lifetime by Andrew and Lettice, was
complete? Or did we actually kill it? Perhaps we did. He was a poor
weak creature when he was alive.</p>
