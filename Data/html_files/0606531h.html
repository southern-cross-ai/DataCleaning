<h2>Robert Louis Stevenson</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>'Now,' said the doctor, 'my part is done, and, I may say, with
some vanity, well done. It remains only to get you out of this cold
and poisonous city, and to give you two months of a pure air and an
easy conscience. The last is your affair. To the first I think I can
help you. It fells indeed rather oddly; it was but the other day the
Padre came in from the country; and as he and I are old friends,
although of contrary professions, he applied to me in a matter of
distress among some of his parishioners. This was a family--but you
are ignorant of Spain, and even the names of our grandees are hardly
known to you; suffice it, then, that they were once great people, and
are now fallen to the brink of destitution. Nothing now belongs to
them but the residencia, and certain leagues of desert mountain, in
the greater part of which not even a goat could support life. But the
house is a fine old place, and stands at a great height among the
hills, and most salubriously; and I had no sooner heard my friend's
tale, than I remembered you. I told him I had a wounded officer,
wounded in the good cause, who was now able to make a change; and I
proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger. Instantly the
Padre's face grew dark, as I had maliciously foreseen it would. It
was out of the question, he said. Then let them starve, said I, for I
have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride. There-upon we separated,
not very content with one another; but yesterday, to my wonder, the
Padre returned and made a submission: the difficulty, he said, he had
found upon enquiry to be less than he had feared; or, in other words,
these proud people had put their pride in their pocket. I closed with
the offer; and, subject to your approval, I have taken rooms for you
in the residencia. The air of these mountains will renew your blood;
and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the medicines
in the world.'</p>

<p>'Doctor,' said I, 'you have been throughout my good angel, and
your advice is a command. But tell me, if you please, something of
the family with which I am to reside.'</p>

<p>'I am coming to that,' replied my friend; 'and, indeed, there is a
difficulty in the way. These beggars are, as I have said, of very
high descent and swollen with the most baseless vanity; they have
lived for some generations in a growing isolation, drawing away, on
either hand, from the rich who had now become too high for them, and
from the poor, whom they still regarded as too low; and even to-day,
when poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest, they
cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation. You are to
remain, they say, a stranger; they will give you attendance, but they
refuse from the first the idea of the smallest intimacy.'</p>

<p>I will not deny that I was piqued, and perhaps the feeling
strengthened my desire to go, for I was confident that I could break
down that barrier if I desired. 'There is nothing offensive in such a
stipulation,' said I; 'and I even sympathise with the feeling that
inspired it.'</p>

<p>'It is true they have never seen you,' returned the doctor
politely; 'and if they knew you were the handsomest and the most
pleasant man that ever came from England (where I am told that
handsome men are common, but pleasant ones not so much so), they
would doubtless make you welcome with a better grace. But since you
take the thing so well, it matters not. To me, indeed, it seems
discourteous. But you will find yourself the gainer. The family will
not much tempt you. A mother, a son, and a daughter; an old woman
said to be halfwitted, a country lout, and a country girl, who stands
very high with her confessor, and is, therefore,' chuckled the
physician, 'most likely plain; there is not much in that to attract
the fancy of a dashing officer.'</p>

<p>'And yet you say they are high-born,' I objected.</p>

<p>'Well, as to that, I should distinguish,' returned the doctor.
'The mother is; not so the children. The mother was the last
representative of a princely stock, degenerate both in parts and
fortune. Her father was not only poor, he was mad: and the girl ran
wild about the residencia till his death. Then, much of the fortune
having died with him, and the family being quite extinct, the girl
ran wilder than ever, until at last she married, Heaven knows whom, a
muleteer some say, others a smuggler; while there are some who uphold
there was no marriage at all, and that Felipe and are bastards. The
union, such as it was, was tragically dissolved some years ago; but
they live in such seclusion, and the country at that time was in so
much disorder, that the precise manner of the man's end is known only
to the priest--if even to him.'</p>

<p>'I begin to think I shall have strange experiences,' said I.</p>

<p>'I would not romance, if I were you,' replied the doctor; 'you
will find, I fear, a very grovelling and commonplace reality. Felipe,
for instance, I have seen. And what am I to say? He is very rustic,
very cunning, very loutish, and, I should say, an innocent; the
others are probably to match. No, no, senor commandante, you must
seek congenial society among the great sights of our mountains; and
in these at least, if you are at all a lover of the works of nature,
I promise you will not be disappointed.'</p>

<p>The next day Felipe came for me in a rough country cart, drawn by
a mule; and a little before the stroke of noon, after I had said
farewell to the doctor, the innkeeper, and different good souls who
had befriended me during my sickness, we set forth out of the city by
the Eastern gate, and began to ascend into the Sierra. I had been so
long a prisoner, since I was left behind for dying after the loss of
the convoy, that the mere smell of the earth set me smiling. The
country through which we went was wild and rocky, partially covered
with rough woods, now of the cork-tree, and now of the great Spanish
chestnut, and frequently intersected by the beds of mountain
torrents. The sun shone, the wind rustled joyously; and we had
advanced some miles, and the city had already shrunk into an
inconsiderable knoll upon the plain behind us, before my attention
began to be diverted to the companion of my drive. To the eye, he
seemed but a diminutive, loutish, well-made country lad, such as the
doctor had described, mighty quick and active, but devoid of any
culture; and this first impression was with most observers final.
What began to strike me was his familiar, chattering talk; so
strangely inconsistent with the terms on which I was to be received;
and partly from his imperfect enunciation, partly from the sprightly
incoherence of the matter, so very difficult to follow clearly
without an effort of the mind. It is true I had before talked with
persons of a similar mental constitution; persons who seemed to live
(as he did) by the senses, taken and possessed by the visual object
of the moment and unable to discharge their minds of that impression.
His seemed to me (as I sat, distantly giving ear) a kind of
conversation proper to drivers, who pass much of their time in a
great vacancy of the intellect and threading the sights of a familiar
country. But this was not the case of Felipe; by his own account, he
was a home--keeper; 'I wish I was there now,' he said; and then,
spying a tree by the wayside, he broke off to tell me that he had
once seen a crow among its branches.</p>

<p>'A crow?' I repeated, struck by the ineptitude of the remark, and
thinking I had heard imperfectly.</p>

<p>But by this time he was already filled with a new idea; hearkening
with a rapt intentness, his head on one side, his face puckered; and
he struck me rudely, to make me hold my peace. Then he smiled and
shook his head.</p>

<p>'What did you hear?' I asked.</p>

<p>'O, it is all right,' he said; and began encouraging his mule with
cries that echoed unhumanly up the mountain walls.</p>

<p>I looked at him more closely. He was superlatively well-built,
light, and lithe and strong; he was well-featured; his yellow eyes
were very large, though, perhaps, not very expressive; take him
altogether, he was a pleasant-looking lad, and I had no fault to find
with him, beyond that he was of a dusky hue, and inclined to
hairyness; two characteristics that I disliked. It was his mind that
puzzled, and yet attracted me. The doctor's phrase--an innocent--came
back to me; and I was wondering if that were, after all, the true
description, when the road began to go down into the narrow and naked
chasm of a torrent. The waters thundered tumultuously in the bottom;
and the ravine was filled full of the sound, the thin spray, and the
claps of wind, that accompanied their descent. The scene was
certainly impressive; but the road was in that part very securely
walled in; the mule went steadily forward; and I was astonished to
perceive the paleness of terror in the face of my companion. The
voice of that wild river was inconstant, now sinking lower as if in
weariness, now doubling its hoarse tones; momentary freshets seemed
to swell its volume, sweeping down the gorge, raving and booming
against the barrier walls; and I observed it was at each of these
accessions to the clamour, that my driver more particularly winced
and blanched. Some thoughts of Scottish superstition and the river
Kelpie, passed across my mind; I wondered if perchance the like were
prevalent in that part of Spain; and turning to Felipe, sought to
draw him out.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?' I asked.</p>

<p>'O, I am afraid,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Of what are you afraid?' I returned. 'This seems one of the
safest places on this very dangerous road.'</p>

<p>'It makes a noise,' he said, with a simplicity of awe that set my
doubts at rest.</p>

<p>The lad was but a child in intellect; his mind was like his body,
active and swift, but stunted in development; and I began from that
time forth to regard him with a measure of pity, and to listen at
first with indulgence, and at last even with pleasure, to his
disjointed babble.</p>

<p>By about four in the afternoon we had crossed the summit of the
mountain line, said farewell to the western sunshine, and began to go
down upon the other side, skirting the edge of many ravines and
moving through the shadow of dusky woods. There rose upon all sides
the voice of falling water, not condensed and formidable as in the
gorge of the river, but scattered and sounding gaily and musically
from glen to glen. Here, too, the spirits of my driver mended, and he
began to sing aloud in a falsetto voice, and with a singular
bluntness of musical perception, never true either to melody or key,
but wandering at will, and yet somehow with an effect that was
natural and pleasing, like that of the of birds. As the dusk
increased, I fell more and more under the spell of this artless
warbling, listening and waiting for some articulate air, and still
disappointed; and when at last I asked him what it was he sang--'O,'
cried he, 'I am just singing!' Above all, I was taken with a trick he
had of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals; it
was not so monotonous as you would think, or, at least, not
disagreeable; and it seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment with
what is, such as we love to fancy in the attitude of trees, or the
quiescence of a pool.</p>

<p>Night had fallen dark before we came out upon a plateau, and drew
up a little after, before a certain lump of superior blackness which
I could only conjecture to be the residencia. Here, my guide, getting
down from the cart, hooted and whistled for a long time in vain;
until at last an old peasant man came towards us from somewhere in
the surrounding dark, carrying a candle in his hand. By the light of
this I was able to perceive a great arched doorway of a Moorish
character: it was closed by iron-studded gates, in one of the leaves
of which Felipe opened a wicket. The peasant carried off the cart to
some out-building; but my guide and I passed through the wicket,
which was closed again behind us; and by the glimmer of the candle,
passed through a court, up a stone stair, along a section of an open
gallery, and up more stairs again, until we came at last to the door
of a great and somewhat bare apartment. This room, which I understood
was to be mine, was pierced by three windows, lined with some
lustrous wood disposed in panels, and carpeted with the skins of many
savage animals. A bright fire burned in the chimney, and shed abroad
a changeful flicker; close up to the blaze there was drawn a table,
laid for supper; and in the far end a bed stood ready. I was pleased
by these preparations, and said so to Felipe; and he, with the same
simplicity of disposition that I held already remarked in him, warmly
re-echoed my praises. 'A fine room,' he said; 'a very fine room. And
fire, too; fire is good; it melts out the pleasure in your bones. And
the bed,' he continued, carrying over the candle in that
direction--'see what fine sheets--how soft, how smooth, smooth;' and
he passed his hand again and again over their texture, and then laid
down his head and rubbed his cheeks among them with a grossness of
content that somehow offended me. I took the candle from his hand
(for I feared he would set the bed on fire) and walked back to the
supper-table, where, perceiving a measure of wine, I poured out a cup
and called to him to come and drink of it. He started to his feet at
once and ran to me with a strong expression of hope; but when he saw
the wine, he visibly shuddered.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' he said, 'not that; that is for you. I hate it.'</p>

<p>'Very well, Senor,' said I; 'then I will drink to your good
health, and to the prosperity of your house and family. Speaking of
which,' I added, after I had drunk, 'shall I not have the pleasure of
laying my salutations in person at the feet of the Senora, your
mother?'</p>

<p>But at these words all the childishness passed out of his face,
and was succeeded by a look of indescribable cunning and secrecy. He
backed away from me at the same time, as though I were an animal
about to leap or some dangerous fellow with a weapon, and when he had
got near the door, glowered at me sullenly with contracted pupils.
'No,' he said at last, and the next moment was gone noiselessly out
of the room; and I heard his footing die away downstairs as light as
rainfall, and silence closed over the house.</p>

<p>After I had supped I drew up the table nearer to the bed and began
to prepare for rest; but in the new position of the light, I was
struck by a picture on the wall. It represented a woman, still young.
To judge by her costume and the mellow unity which reigned over the
canvas, she had long been dead; to judge by the vivacity of the
attitude, the eyes and the features, I might have been beholding in a
mirror the image of life. Her figure was very slim and strong, and of
a just proportion; red tresses lay like a crown over her brow; her
eyes, of a very golden brown, held mine with a look; and her face,
which was perfectly shaped, was yet marred by a cruel, sullen, and
sensual expression. Something in both face and figure, something
exquisitely intangible, like the echo of an echo, suggested the
features and bearing of my guide; and I stood awhile, unpleasantly
attracted and wondering at the oddity of the resemblance. The common,
carnal stock of that race, which had been originally designed for
such high dames as the one now looking on me from the canvas, had
fallen to baser uses, wearing country clothes, sitting on the shaft
and holding the reins of a mule cart, to bring home a lodger. Perhaps
an actual link subsisted; perhaps some scruple of the delicate flesh
that was once clothed upon with the satin and brocade of the dead
lady, now winced at the rude contact of Felipe's frieze.</p>

<p>The first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait, and,
as I lay awake, my eyes continued to dwell upon it with growing
complacency; its beauty crept about my heart insidiously, silencing
my scruples one after another; and while I knew that to love such a
woman were to sign and seal one's own sentence of degeneration, I
still knew that, if she were alive, I should love her. Day after day
the double knowledge of her wickedness and of my weakness grew
clearer. She came to be the heroine of many day-dreams, in which her
eyes led on to, and sufficiently rewarded, crimes. She cast a dark
shadow on my fancy; and when I was out in the free air of heaven,
taking vigorous exercise and healthily renewing the current of my
blood, it was often a glad thought to me that my enchantress was safe
in the grave, her wand of beauty broken, her lips closed in silence,
her philtre spilt. And yet I had a half-lingering terror that she
might not be dead after all, but re-arisen in the body of some
descendant.</p>

<p>Felipe served my meals in my own apartment; and his resemblance to
the portrait haunted me. At times it was not; at times, upon some
change of attitude or flash of expression, it would leap out upon me
like a ghost. It was above all in his ill tempers that the likeness
triumphed. He certainly liked me; he was proud of my notice, which he
sought to engage by many simple and childlike devices; he loved to
sit close before my fire, talking his broken talk or singing his odd,
endless, wordless songs, and sometimes drawing his hand over my
clothes with an affectionate manner of caressing that never failed to
cause in me an embarrassment of which I was ashamed. But for all
that, he was capable of flashes of causeless anger and fits of sturdy
sullenness. At a word of reproof, I have seen him upset the dish of
which I was about to eat, and this not surreptitiously, but with
defiance; and similarly at a hint of inquisition. I was not
unnaturally curious, being in a strange place and surrounded by
string people; but at the shadow of a question, he shrank back,
lowering and dangerous. Then it was that, for a fraction of a second,
this rough lad might have been the brother of the lady in the frame.
But these humours were swift to pass; and the resemblance died along
with them.</p>

<p>In these first days I saw nothing of any one but Felipe, unless
the portrait is to be counted; and since the lad was plainly of weak
mind, and had moments of passion, it may be wondered that I bore his
dangerous neighbourhood with equanimity. As a matter of fact, it was
for some time irksome; but it happened before long that I obtained
over him so complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest.</p>

<p>It fell in this way. He was by nature slothful, and much of a
vagabond, and yet he kept by the house, and not only waited upon my
wants, but laboured every day in the garden or small farm to the
south of the residencia. Here he would be joined by the peasant whom
I had seen on the night of my arrival, and who dwelt at the far end
of the enclosure, about half a mile away, in a rude out--house; but
it was plain to me that, of these two, it was Felipe who did most;
and though I would sometimes see him throw down his spade and go to
sleep among the very plants he had been digging, his constancy and
energy were admirable in themselves, and still more so since I was
well assured they were foreign to his disposition and the fruit of an
ungrateful effort. But while I admired, I wondered what had called
forth in a lad so shuttle-witted this enduring sense of duty. How was
it sustained? I asked myself, and to what length did it prevail over
his instincts? The priest was possibly his inspirer; but the priest
came one day to the residencia. I saw him both come and go after an
interval of close upon an hour, from a knoll where I was sketching,
and all that time Felipe continued to labour undisturbed in the
garden.</p>

<p>At last, in a very unworthy spirit, I determined to debauch the
lad from his good resolutions, and, way-laying him at the gate,
easily pursuaded him to join me in a ramble. It was a fine day, and
the woods to which I led him were green and pleasant and
sweet-smelling and alive with the hum of insects. Here he discovered
himself in a fresh character, mounting up to heights of gaiety that
abashed me, and displaying an energy and grace of movement that
delighted the eye. He leaped, he ran round me in mere glee; he would
stop, and look and listen, and seem to drink in the world like a
cordial; and then he would suddenly spring into a tree with one
bound, and hang and gambol there like one at home. Little as he said
to me, and that of not much import, I have rarely enjoyed more
stirring company; the sight of his delight was a continual feast; the
speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart; and I
might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these
wants, had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure.
By some swiftness or dexterity the lad captured a squirrel in a tree
top. He was then some way ahead of me, but I saw him drop to the
ground and crouch there, crying aloud for pleasure like a child. The
sound stirred my sympathies, it was so fresh and innocent; but as I
bettered my pace to draw near, the cry of the squirrel knocked upon
my heart. I have heard and seen much of the cruelty of lads, and
above all of peasants; but what I now beheld struck me into a passion
of anger. I thrust the fellow aside, plucked the poor brute out of
his hands, and with swift mercy killed it. Then I turned upon the
torturer, spoke to him long out of the heat of my indignation,
calling him names at which he seemed to wither; and at length,
pointing toward the residencia, bade him begone and leave me, for I
chose to walk with men, not with vermin. He fell upon his knees, and,
the words coming to him with more cleanness than usual, poured out a
stream of the most touching supplications, begging me in mercy to
forgive him, to forget what he had done, to look to the future. 'O, I
try so hard,' he said. 'O, commandante, bear with Felipe this once;
he will never be a brute again!' Thereupon, much more affected than I
cared to show, I suffered myself to be persuaded, and at last shook
hands with him and made it up. But the squirrel, by way of penance, I
made him bury; speaking of the poor thing's beauty, telling him what
pains it had suffered, and how base a thing was the abuse of
strength. 'See, Felipe,' said I, 'you are strong indeed; but in my
hands you are as helpless as that poor thing of the trees. Give me
your hand in mine. You cannot remove it. Now suppose that I were
cruel like you, and took a pleasure in pain. I only tighten my hold,
and see how you suffer.' He screamed aloud, his face stricken ashy
and dotted with needle points of sweat; and when I set him free, he
fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned over it like a baby.
But he took the lesson in good part; and whether from that, or from
what I had said to him, or the higher notion he now had of my bodily
strength, his original affection was changed into a dog-like, adoring
fidelity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I gained rapidly in health. The residencia stood on the
crown of a stony plateau; on every side the mountains hemmed it
about; only from the roof, where was a bartizan, there might be seen
between two peaks, a small segment of plain, blue with extreme
distance. The air in these altitudes moved freely and largely; great
clouds congregated there, and were broken up by the wind and left in
tatters on the hilltops; a hoarse, and yet faint rumbling of torrents
rose from all round; and one could there study all the ruder and more
ancient characters of nature in something of their pristine force. I
delighted from the first in the vigorous scenery and changeful
weather; nor less in the antique and dilapidated mansion where I
dwelt. This was a large oblong, flanked at two opposite corners by
bastion-like projections, one of which commanded the door, while both
were loopholed for musketry. The lower storey was, besides, naked of
windows, so that the building, if garrisoned, could not be carried
without artillery. It enclosed an open court planted with pomegranate
trees. From this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to an open
gallery, running all round and resting, towards the court, on slender
pillars. Thence again, several enclosed stairs led to the upper
storeys of the house, which were thus broken up into distinct
divisions. The windows, both within and without, were closely
shuttered; some of the stone-work in the upper parts had fallen; the
roof, in one place, had been wrecked in one of the flurries of wind
which were common in these mountains; and the whole house, in the
strong, beating sunlight, and standing out above a grove of stunted
cork--trees, thickly laden and discoloured with dust, looked like the
sleeping palace of the legend. The court, in particular, seemed the
very home of slumber. A hoarse cooing of doves haunted about the
eaves; the winds were excluded, but when they blew outside, the
mountain dust fell here as thick as rain, and veiled the red bloom of
the pomegranates; shuttered windows and the closed doors of numerous
cellars, and the vacant, arches of the gallery, enclosed it; and all
day long the sun made broken profiles on the four sides, and paraded
the shadow of the pillars on the gallery floor. At the ground level
there was, however, a certain pillared recess, which bore the marks
of human habitation. Though it was open in front upon the court, it
was yet provided with a chimney, where a wood fire would he always
prettily blazing; and the tile floor was littered with the skins of
animals.</p>

<p>It was in this place that I first saw my hostess. She had drawn
one of the skins forward and sat in the sun, leaning against a
pillar. It was her dress that struck me first of all, for it was rich
and brightly coloured, and shone out in that dusty courtyard with
something of the same relief as the flowers of the pomegranates. At a
second look it was her beauty of person that took hold of me. As she
sat back--watching me, I thought, though with invisible eyes--and
wearing at the same time an expression of almost imbecile good-humour
and contentment, she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet
nobility of attitude that were beyond a statue's. I took off my hat
to her in passing, and her face puckered with suspicion as swiftly
and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze; but she paid no heed to
my courtesy. I went forth on my customary walk a trifle daunted, her
idol-like impassivity haunting me; and when I returned, although she
was still in much the same posture, I was half surprised to see that
she had moved as far as the next pillar, following the sunshine. This
time, however, she addressed me with some trivial salutation, civilly
enough conceived, and uttered in the same deep-chested, and yet
indistinct and lisping tones, that had already baffled the utmost
niceness of my hearing from her son. I answered rather at a venture;
for not only did I fail to take her meaning with precision, but the
sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me. They were unusually
large, the iris golden like Felipe's, but the pupil at that moment so
distended that they seemed almost black; and what affected me was not
so much their size as (what was perhaps its consequence) the singular
insignificance of their regard. A look more blankly stupid I have
never met. My eyes dropped before it even as I spoke, and I went on
my way upstairs to my own room, at once baffled and embarrassed. Yet,
when I came there and saw the face of the portrait, I was again
reminded of the miracle of family descent. My hostess was, indeed,
both older and fuller in person; her eyes were of a different colour;
her face, besides, was not only free from the ill-significance that
offended and attracted me in the painting; it was devoid of either
good or bad--a moral blank expressing literally naught. And yet there
was a likeness, not so much speaking as immanent, not so much in any
particular feature as upon the whole. It should seem, I thought, as
if when the master set his signature to that grave canvas, he had not
only caught the image of one smiling and false-eyed woman, but
stamped the essential quality of a race.</p>

<p>From that day forth, whether I came or went, I was sure to find
the Senora seated in the sun against a pillar, or stretched on a rug
before the fire; only at times she would shift her station to the top
round of the stone staircase, where she lay with the same nonchalance
right across my path. In all these days, I never knew her to display
the least spark of energy beyond what she expended in brushing and
re-brushing her copious copper-coloured hair, or in lisping out, in
the rich and broken hoarseness of her voice, her customary idle
salutations to myself. These, I think, were her two chief pleasures,
beyond that of mere quiescence. She seemed always proud of her
remarks, as though they had been witticisms: and, indeed, though they
were empty enough, like the conversation of many respectable persons,
and turned on a very narrow range of subjects, they were never
meaningless or incoherent; nay, they had a certain beauty of their
own, breathing, as they did, of her entire contentment. Now she would
speak of the warmth, in which (like her son) she greatly delighted;
now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees, and now of the white
doves and long-winged swallows that fanned the air of the court. The
birds excited her. As they raked the eaves in their swift flight, or
skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind, she would sometimes
stir, and sit a little up, and seem to awaken from her doze of
satisfaction. But for the rest of her days she lay luxuriously folded
on herself and sunk in sloth and pleasure. Her invincible content at
first annoyed me, but I came gradually to find repose in the
spectacle, until at last it grew to be my habit to sit down beside
her four times in the day, both coming and going, and to talk with
her sleepily, I scarce knew of what. I had come to like her dull,
almost animal neighbourhood; her beauty and her stupidity soothed and
amused me. I began to find a kind of transcendental good sense in her
remarks, and her unfathomable good nature moved me to admiration and
envy. The liking was returned; she enjoyed my presence
half-unconsciously, as a man in deep meditation may enjoy the
babbling of a brook. I can scarce say she brightened when I came, for
satisfaction was written on her face eternally, as on some foolish
statue's; but I was made conscious of her pleasure by some more
intimate communication than the sight. And one day, as I set within
reach of her on the marble step, she suddenly shot forth one of her
hands and patted mine. The thing was done, and she was back in her
accustomed attitude, before my mind had received intelligence of the
caress; and when I turned to look her in the face I could perceive no
answerable sentiment. It was plain she attached no moment to the act,
and I blamed myself for my own more uneasy consciousness.</p>

<p>The sight and (if I may so call it) the acquaintance of the mother
confirmed the view I had already taken of the son. The family blood
had been impoverished, perhaps by long inbreeding, which I knew to be
a common error among the proud and the exclusive. No decline, indeed,
was to be traced in the body, which had been handed down unimpaired
in shapeliness and strength; and the faces of to-day were struck as
sharply from the mint, as the face of two centuries ago that smiled
upon me from the portrait. But the intelligence (that more precious
heirloom) was degenerate; the treasure of ancestral memory ran low;
and it had required the potent, plebeian crossing of a muleteer or
mountain contrabandista to raise, what approached hebetude in the
mother, into the active oddity of the son. Yet of the two, it was the
mother I preferred. Of Felipe, vengeful and placable, full of starts
and shyings, inconstant as a hare, I could even conceive as a
creature possibly noxious. Of the mother I had no thoughts but those
of kindness. And indeed, as spectators are apt ignorantly to take
sides, I grew something of a partisan in the enmity which I perceived
to smoulder between them. True, it seemed mostly on the mother's
part. She would sometimes draw in her breath as he came near, and the
pupils of her vacant eyes would contract as if with horror or fear.
Her emotions, such as they were, were much upon the surface and
readily shared; and this latent repulsion occupied my mind, and kept
me wondering on what grounds it rested, and whether the son was
certainly in fault.</p>

<p>I had been about ten days in the residencia, when there sprang up
a high and harsh wind, carrying clouds of dust. It came out of
malarious lowlands, and over several snowy sierras. The nerves of
those on whom it blew were strung and jangled; their eyes smarted
with the dust; their legs ached under the burthen of their body; and
the touch of one hand upon another grew to be odious. The wind,
besides, came down the gullies of the hills and stormed about the
house with a great, hollow buzzing and whistling that was wearisome
to the ear and dismally depressing to the mind. It did not so much
blow in gusts as with the steady sweep of a waterfall, so that there
was no remission of discomfort while it blew. But higher upon the
mountain, it was probably of a more variable strength, with accesses
of fury; for there came down at times a far-off wailing, infinitely
grievous to hear; and at times, on one of the high shelves or
terraces, there would start up, and then disperse, a tower of dust,
like the smoke of in explosion.</p>

<p>I no sooner awoke in bed than I was conscious of the nervous
tension and depression of the weather, and the effect grew stronger
as the day proceeded. It was in vain that I resisted; in vain that I
set forth upon my customary morning's walk; the irrational,
unchanging fury of the storm had soon beat down my strength and
wrecked my temper; and I returned to the residencia, glowing with dry
heat, and foul and gritty with dust. The court had a forlorn
appearance; now and then a glimmer of sun fled over it; now and then
the wind swooped down upon the pomegranates, and scattered the
blossoms, and set the window shutters clapping on the wall. In the
recess the Senora was pacing to and fro with a flushed countenance
and bright eyes; I thought, too, she was speaking to herself, like
one in anger. But when I addressed her with my customary salutation,
she only replied by a sharp gesture and continued her walk. The
weather had distempered even this impassive creature; and as I went
on upstairs I was the less ashamed of my own discomposure.</p>

<p>All day the wind continued; and I sat in my room and made a feint
of reading, or walked up and down, and listened to the riot overhead.
Night fell, and I had not so much as a candle. I began to long for
some society, and stole down to the court. It was now plunged in the
blue of the first darkness; but the recess was redly lighted by the
fire. The wood had been piled high, and was crowned by a shock of
flames, which the draught of the chimney brandished to and fro. In
this strong and shaken brightness the Senora continued pacing from
wall to wall with disconnected gestures, clasping her hands,
stretching forth her arms, throwing back her head as in appeal to
heaven. In these disordered movements the beauty and grace of the
woman showed more clearly; but there was a light in her eye that
struck on me unpleasantly; and when I had looked on awhile in
silence, and seemingly unobserved, I turned tail as I had come, and
groped my way back again to my own chamber.</p>

<p>By the time Felipe brought my supper and lights, my nerve was
utterly gone; and, had the lad been such as I was used to seeing him,
I should have kept him (even by force had that been necessary) to
take off the edge from my distasteful solitude. But on Felipe, also,
the wind had exercised its influence. He had been feverish all day;
now that the night had come he was fallen into a low and tremulous
humour that reacted on my own. The sight of his scared face, his
starts and pallors and sudden harkenings, unstrung me; and when he
dropped and broke a dish, I fairly leaped out of my seat.</p>

<p>'I think we are all mad to-day,' said I, affecting to laugh.</p>

<p>'It is the black wind,' he replied dolefully. 'You feel as if you
must do something, and you don't know what it is.'</p>

<p>I noted the aptness of the description; but, indeed, Felipe had
sometimes a strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations
of the body. 'And your mother, too,' said I; 'she seems to feel this
weather much. Do you not fear she may be unwell?'</p>

<p>He stared at me a little, and then said, 'No,' almost defiantly;
and the next moment, carrying his hand to his brow, cried out
lamentably on the wind and the noise that made his head go round like
a millwheel. 'Who can be well?' he cried; and, indeed, I could only
echo his question, for I was disturbed enough myself.</p>

<p>I went to bed early, wearied with day-long restlessness, but the
poisonous nature of the wind, and its ungodly and unintermittent
uproar, would not suffer me to sleep. I lay there and tossed, my
nerves and senses on the stretch. At times I would doze, dream
horribly, and wake again; and these snatches of oblivion confused me
as to time. But it must have been late on in the night, when I was
suddenly startled by an outbreak of pitiable and hateful cries. I
leaped from my bed, supposing I had dreamed; but the cries still
continued to fill the house, cries of pain, I thought, but certainly
of rage also, and so savage and discordant that they shocked the
heart. It was no illusion; some living thing, some lunatic or some
wild animal, was being foully tortured. The thought of Felipe and the
squirrel flashed into my mind, and I ran to the door, but it had been
locked from the outside; and I might shake it as I pleased, I was a
fast prisoner. Still the cries continued. Now they would dwindle down
into a moaning that seemed to be articulate, and at these times I
made sure they must be human; and again they would break forth and
fill the house with ravings worthy of hell. I stood at the door and
gave ear to them, till at, last they died away. Long after that, I
still lingered and still continued to hear them mingle in fancy with
the storming of the wind; and when at last I crept to my bed, it was
with a deadly sickness and a blackness of horror on my heart.</p>

<p>It was little wonder if I slept no more. Why had I been locked in?
What had passed? Who was the author of these indescribable and
shocking cries? A human being? It was inconceivable. A beast? The
cries were scarce quite bestial; and what animal, short of a lion or
a tiger, could thus shake the solid walls of the residencia? And
while I was thus turning over the elements of the mystery, it came
into my mind that I had not yet set eyes upon the daughter of the
house. What was more probable than that the daughter of the Senora,
and the sister of Felipe, should be herself insane? Or, what more
likely than that these ignorant and half--witted people should seek
to manage an afflicted kinswoman by violence? Here was a solution;
and yet when I called to mind the cries (which I never did without a
shuddering chill) it seemed altogether insufficient: not even cruelty
could wring such cries from madness. But of one thing I was sure: I
could not live in a house where such a thing was half conceivable,
and not probe the matter home and, if necessary, interfere.</p>

<p>The next day came, the wind had blown itself out, and there was
nothing to remind me of the business of the night. Felipe came to my
bedside with obvious cheerfulness; as I passed through the court, the
Senora was sunning herself with her accustomed immobility; and when I
issued from the gateway, I found the whole face of nature austerely
smiling, the heavens of a cold blue, and sown with great cloud
islands, and the mountain-sides mapped forth into provinces of light
and shadow. A short walk restored me to myself, and renewed within me
the resolve to plumb this mystery; and when, from the vantage of my
knoll, I had seen Felipe pass forth to his labours in the garden, I
returned at once to the residencia to put my design in practice. The
Senora appeared plunged in slumber; I stood awhile and marked her,
but she did not stir; even if my design were indiscreet, I had little
to fear from such a guardian; and turning away, I mounted to the
gallery and began my exploration of the house.</p>

<p>All morning I went from one door to another, and entered spacious
and faded chambers, some rudely shuttered, some receiving their full
charge of daylight, all empty and unhomely. It was a rich house, on
which Time had breathed his tarnish and dust had scattered
disillusion. The spider swung there; the bloated tarantula scampered
on the cornices; ants had their crowded highways on the floor of
halls of audience; the big and foul fly, that lives on carrion and is
often the messenger of death, had set up his nest in the rotten
woodwork, and buzzed heavily about the rooms. Here and there a stool
or two, a couch, a bed, or a great carved chair remained behind, like
islets on the bare floors, to testify of man's bygone habitation; and
everywhere the walls were set with the portraits of the dead. I could
judge, by these decaying effigies, in the house of what a great and
what a handsome race I was then wandering. Many of the men wore
orders on their breasts and had the port of noble offices; the women
were all richly attired; the canvases most of them by famous hands.
But it was not so much these evidences of greatness that took hold
upon my mind, even contrasted, as they were, with the present
depopulation and decay of that great house. It was rather the parable
of family life that I read in this succession of fair faces and
shapely bodies. Never before had I so realised the miracle of the
continued race, the creation and recreation, the weaving and changing
and handing down of fleshly elements. That a child should be born of
its mother, that it should grow and clothe itself (we know not how)
with humanity, and put on inherited looks, and turn its head with the
manner of one ascendant, and offer its hand with the gesture of
another, are wonders dulled for us by repetition. But in the singular
unity of look, in the common features and common bearing, of all
these painted generations on the walls of the residencia, the miracle
started out and looked me in the face. And an ancient mirror falling
opportunely in my way, I stood and read my own features a long while,
tracing out on either hand the filaments of descent and the bonds
that knit me with my family.</p>

<p>At last, in the course of these investigations, I opened the door
of a chamber that bore the marks of habitation. It was of large
proportions and faced to the north, where the mountains were most
wildly figured. The embers of a fire smouldered and smoked upon the
hearth, to which a chair had been drawn close. And yet the aspect of
the chamber was ascetic to the degree of sternness; the chair was
uncushioned; the floor and walls were naked; and beyond the books
which lay here and there in some confusion, there was no instrument
of either work or pleasure. The sight of books in the house of such a
family exceedingly amazed me; and I began with a great hurry, and in
momentary fear of interruption, to go from one to another and hastily
inspect their character. They were of all sorts, devotional,
historical, and scientific, but mostly of a great age and in the
Latin tongue. Some I could see to bear the marks of constant study;
others had been torn across and tossed aside as if in petulance or
disapproval. Lastly, as I cruised about that empty chamber, I espied
some papers written upon with pencil on a table near the window. An
unthinking curiosity led me to take one up. It bore a copy of verses,
very roughly metred in the original Spanish, and which I may render
somewhat thus--</p>

<p>Pleasure approached with pain and shame, Grief with a wreath of
lilies came. Pleasure showed the lovely sun; Jesu dear, how sweet it
shone! Grief with her worn hand pointed on, Jesu dear, to thee!</p>

<p>Shame and confusion at once fell on me; and, laying down the
paper, I beat an immediate retreat from the apartment. Neither Felipe
nor his mother could have read the books nor written these rough but
feeling verses. It was plain I had stumbled with sacrilegious feet
into the room of the daughter of the house. God knows, my own heart
most sharply punished me for my indiscretion. The thought that I had
thus secretly pushed my way into the confidence of a girl so
strangely situated, and the fear that she might somehow come to hear
of it, oppressed me like guilt. I blamed myself besides for my
suspicions of the night before; wondered that I should ever have
attributed those shocking cries to one of whom I now conceived as of
a saint, spectral of mien, wasted with maceration, bound up in the
practices of a mechanical devotion, and dwelling in a great isolation
of soul with her incongruous relatives; and as I leaned on the
balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the bright close of
pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent woman, who just
then stretched herself and delicately licked her lips as in the very
sensuality of sloth, my mind swiftly compared the scene with the cold
chamber looking northward on the mountains, where the daughter
dwelt.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, as I sat upon my knoll, I saw the Padre enter
the gates of the residencia. The revelation of the daughter's
character had struck home to my fancy, and almost blotted out the
horrors of the night before; but at sight of this worthy man the
memory revived. I descended, then, from the knoll, and making a
circuit among the woods, posted myself by the wayside to await his
passage. As soon as he appeared I stepped forth and introduced myself
as the lodger of the residencia. He had a very strong, honest
countenance, on which it was easy to read the mingled emotions with
which he regarded me, as a foreigner, a heretic, and yet one who had
been wounded for the good cause. Of the family at the residencia he
spoke with reserve, and yet with respect. I mentioned that I had not
yet seen the daughter, whereupon he remarked that that was as it
should be, and looked at me a little askance. Lastly, I plucked up
courage to refer to the cries that had disturbed me in the night. He
heard me out in silence, and then stopped and partly turned about, as
though to mark beyond doubt that he was dismissing me.</p>

<p>'Do you take tobacco powder?' said he, offering his snuff-box; and
then, when I had refused, 'I am an old man,' he added, 'and I may be
allowed to remind you that you are a guest.'</p>

<p>'I have, then, your authority,' I returned, firmly enough,
although I flushed at the implied reproof, 'to let things take their
course, and not to interfere?'</p>

<p>He said 'yes,' and with a somewhat uneasy salute turned and left
me where I was. But he had done two things: he had set my conscience
at rest, and he had awakened my delicacy. I made a great effort, once
more dismissed the recollections of the night, and fell once more to
brooding on my saintly poetess. At the same time, I could not quite
forget that I had been locked in, and that night when Felipe brought
me my supper I attacked him warily on both points of interest.</p>

<p>'I never see your sister,' said I casually.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' said he; 'she is a good, good girl,' and his mind
instantly veered to something else.</p>

<p>'Your sister is pious, I suppose?' I asked in the next pause.</p>

<p>'Oh!' he cried, joining his hands with extreme fervour, 'a saint;
it is she that keeps me up.'</p>

<p>'You are very fortunate,' said I, 'for the most of us, I am
afraid, and myself among the number, are better at going down.'</p>

<p>'Senor,' said Felipe earnestly, 'I would not say that. You should
not tempt your angel. If one goes down, where is he to stop?'</p>

<p>'Why, Felipe,' said I, 'I had no guess you were a preacher, and I
may say a good one; but I suppose that is your sister's doing?'</p>

<p>He nodded at me with round eyes.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' I continued, 'she has doubtless reproved you for
your sin of cruelty?'</p>

<p>'Twelve times!' he cried; for this was the phrase by which the odd
creature expressed the sense of frequency. 'And I told her you had
done so--I remembered that,' he added proudly--'and she was
pleased.'</p>

<p>'Then, Felipe,' said I, 'what were those cries that I heard last
night? for surely they were cries of some creature in suffering.'</p>

<p>'The wind,' returned Felipe, looking in the fire.</p>

<p>I took his hand in mine, at which, thinking it to be a caress, he
smiled with a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming my
resolve. But I trod the weakness down. 'The wind,' I repeated; 'and
yet I think it was this hand,' holding it up, 'that had first locked
me in.' The lad shook visibly, but answered never a word. 'Well,'
said I, 'I am a stranger and a guest. It is not my part either to
meddle or to judge in your affairs; in these you shall take your
sister's counsel, which I cannot doubt to be excellent. But in so far
as concerns my own I will be no man's prisoner, and I demand that
key.' Half an hour later my door was suddenly thrown open, and the
key tossed ringing on the floor.</p>

<p>A day or two after I came in from a walk a little before the point
of noon. The Senora was lying lapped in slumber on the threshold of
the recess; the pigeons dozed below the eaves like snowdrifts; the
house was under a deep spell of noontide quiet; and only a wandering
and gentle wind from the mountain stole round the galleries, rustled
among the pomegranates, and pleasantly stirred the shadows. Something
in the stillness moved me to imitation, and I went very lightly
across the court and up the marble staircase. My foot was on the
topmost round, when a door opened, and I found myself face to face
with . Surprise transfixed me; her loveliness struck to my heart; she
glowed in the deep shadow of the gallery, a gem of colour; her eyes
took hold upon mine and clung there, and bound us together like the
joining of hands; and the moments we thus stood face to face,
drinking each other in, were sacramental and the wedding of souls. I
know not how long it was before I awoke out of a deep trance, and,
hastily bowing, passed on into the upper stair. She did not move, but
followed me with her great, thirsting eyes; and as I passed out of
sight it seemed to me as if she paled and faded.</p>

<p>In my own room, I opened the window and looked out, and could not
think what change had come upon that austere field of mountains that
it should thus sing and shine under the lofty heaven. I had seen
her--! And the stone crags answered, Olalla! and the dumb,
unfathomable azure answered, Olalla! The pale saint of my dreams had
vanished for ever; and in her place I beheld this maiden on whom God
had lavished the richest colours and the most exuberant energies of
life, whom he had made active as a deer, slender as a reed, and in
whose great eyes he had lighted the torches of the soul. The thrill
of her young life, strung like a wild animal's, had entered into me;
the force of soul that had looked out from her eyes and conquered
mine, mantled about my heart and sprang to my lips in singing. She
passed through my veins: she was one with me.</p>

<p>I will not say that this enthusiasm declined; rather my soul held
out in its ecstasy as in a strong castle, and was there besieged by
cold and sorrowful considerations. I could not doubt but that I loved
her at first sight, and already with a quivering ardour that was
strange to my experience. What then was to follow? She was the child
of an afflicted house, the Senora's daughter, the sister of Felipe;
she bore it even in her beauty. She had the lightness and swiftness
of the one, swift as an arrow, light as dew; like the other, she
shone on the pale background of the world with the brilliancy of
flowers. I could not call by the name of brother that half-witted
lad, nor by the name of mother that immovable and lovely thing of
flesh, whose silly eyes and perpetual simper now recurred to my mind
like something hateful. And if I could not marry, what then? She was
helplessly unprotected; her eyes, in that single and long glance
which had been all our intercourse, had confessed a weakness equal to
my own; but in my heart I knew her for the student of the cold
northern chamber, and the writer of the sorrowful lines; and this was
a knowledge to disarm a brute. To flee was more than I could find
courage for; but I registered a vow of unsleeping circumspection.</p>

<p>As I turned from the window, my eyes alighted on the portrait. It
had fallen dead, like a candle after sunrise; it followed me with
eyes of paint. I knew it to be like, and marvelled at the tenacity of
type in that declining race; but the likeness was swallowed up in
difference. I remembered how it had seemed to me a thing
unapproachable in the life, a creature rather of the painter's craft
than of the modesty of nature, and I marvelled at the thought, and
exulted in the image of . Beauty I had seen before, and not been
charmed, and I had been often drawn to women, who were not beautiful
except to me; but in Olalla all that I desired and had not dared to
imagine was united.</p>

<p>I did not see her the next day, and my heart ached and my eyes
longed for her, as men long for morning. But the day after, when I
returned, about my usual hour, she was once more on the gallery, and
our looks once more met and embraced. I would have spoken, I would
have drawn near to her; but strongly as she plucked at my heart,
drawing me like a magnet, something yet more imperious withheld me;
and I could only bow and pass by; and she, leaving my salutation
unanswered, only followed me with her noble eyes.</p>

<p>I had now her image by rote, and as I conned the traits in memory
it seemed as if I read her very heart. She was dressed with something
of her mother's coquetry, and love of positive colour. Her robe,
which I know she must have made with her own hands, clung about her
with a cunning grace. After the fashion of that country, besides, her
bodice stood open in the middle, in a long slit, and here, in spite
of the poverty of the house, a gold coin, hanging by a ribbon, lay on
her brown bosom. These were proofs, had any been needed, of her
inborn delight in life and her own loveliness. On the other hand, in
her eyes that hung upon mine, I could read depth beyond depth of
passion and sadness, lights of poetry and hope, blacknesses of
despair, and thoughts that were above the earth. It was a lovely
body, but the inmate, the soul, was more than worthy of that lodging.
Should I leave this incomparable flower to wither unseen on these
rough mountains? Should I despise the great gift offered me in the
eloquent silence of her eyes? Here was a soul immured; should I not
burst its prison? All side considerations fell off from me; were she
the child of Herod I swore I should make her mine; and that very
evening I set myself, with a mingled sense of treachery and disgrace,
to captivate the brother. Perhaps I read him with more favourable
eyes, perhaps the thought of his sister always summoned up the better
qualities of that imperfect soul; but he had never seemed to me so
amiable, and his very likeness to , while it annoyed, yet softened
me.</p>

<p>A third day passed in vain--an empty desert of hours. I would not
lose a chance, and loitered all afternoon in the court where (to give
myself a countenance) I spoke more than usual with the Senora. God
knows it was with a most tender and sincere interest that I now
studied her; and even as for Felipe, so now for the mother, I was
conscious of a growing warmth of toleration. And yet I wondered. Even
while I spoke with her, she would doze off into a little sleep, and
presently awake again without embarrassment; and this composure
staggered me. And again, as I marked her make infinitesimal changes
in her posture, savouring and lingering on the bodily pleasure of the
movement, I was driven to wonder at this depth of passive sensuality.
She lived in her body; and her consciousness was all sunk into and
disseminated through her members, where it luxuriously dwelt. Lastly,
I could not grow accustomed to her eyes. Each time she turned on me
these great beautiful and meaningless orbs, wide open to the day, but
closed against human inquiry--each time I had occasion to observe the
lively changes of her pupils which expanded and contracted in a
breath--I know not what it was came over me, I can find no name for
the mingled feeling of disappointment, annoyance, and distaste that
jarred along my nerves. I tried her on a variety of subjects, equally
in vain; and at last led the talk to her daughter. But even there she
proved indifferent; said she was pretty, which (as with children) was
her highest word of commendation, but was plainly incapable of any
higher thought; and when I remarked that seemed silent, merely yawned
in my face and replied that speech was of no great use when you had
nothing to say. 'People speak much, very much,' she added, looking at
me with expanded pupils; and then again yawned and again showed me a
mouth that was as dainty as a toy. This time I took the hint, and,
leaving her to her repose, went up into my own chamber to sit by the
open window, looking on the hills and not beholding them, sunk in
lustrous and deep dreams, and hearkening in fancy to the note of a
voice that I had never heard.</p>

<p>I awoke on the fifth morning with a brightness of anticipation
that seemed to challenge fate. I was sure of myself, light of heart
and foot, and resolved to put my love incontinently to the touch of
knowledge. It should lie no longer under the bonds of silence, a dumb
thing, living by the eye only, like the love of beasts; but should
now put on the spirit, and enter upon the joys of the complete human
intimacy. I thought of it with wild hopes, like a voyager to El
Dorado; into that unknown and lovely country of her soul, I no longer
trembled to adventure. Yet when I did indeed encounter her, the same
force of passion descended on me and at once submerged my mind;
speech seemed to drop away from me like a childish habit; and I but
drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to the margin of a gulf.
She drew back from me a little as I came; but her eyes did not waver
from mine, and these lured me forward. At last, when I was already
within reach of her, I stopped. Words were denied me; if I advanced I
could but clasp her to my heart in silence; and all that was sane in
me, all that was still unconquered, revolted against the thought of
such an accost. So we stood for a second, all our life in our eyes,
exchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting; and then,
with a great effort of the will, and conscious at the same time of a
sudden bitterness of disappointment, I turned and went away in the
same silence.</p>

<p>What power lay upon me that I could not speak? And she, why was
she also silent? Why did she draw away before me dumbly, with
fascinated eyes? Was this love? or was it a mere brute attraction,
mindless and inevitable, like that of the magnet for the steel? We
had never spoken, we were wholly strangers: and yet an influence,
strong as the grasp of a giant, swept us silently together. On my
side, it filled me with impatience; and yet I was sure that she was
worthy; I had seen her books, read her verses, and thus, in a sense,
divined the soul of my mistress. But on her side, it struck me almost
cold. Of me, she knew nothing but my bodily favour; she was drawn to
me as stones fall to the earth; the laws that rule the earth
conducted her, unconsenting, to my arms; and I drew back at the
thought of such a bridal, and began to be jealous for myself. It was
not thus that I desired to be loved. And then I began to fall into a
great pity for the girl herself. I thought how sharp must be her
mortification, that she, the student, the recluse, Felipe's saintly
monitress, should have thus confessed an overweening weakness for a
man with whom she had never exchanged a word. And at the coming of
pity, all other thoughts were swallowed up; and I longed only to find
and console and reassure her; to tell her how wholly her love was
returned on my side, and how her choice, even if blindly made, was
not unworthy.</p>

<p>The next day it was glorious weather; depth upon depth of blue
over-canopied the mountains; the sun shone wide; and the wind in the
trees and the many falling torrents in the mountains filled the air
with delicate and haunting music. Yet I was prostrated with sadness.
My heart wept for the sight of , as a child weeps for its mother. I
sat down on a boulder on the verge of the low cliffs that bound the
plateau to the north. Thence I looked down into the wooded valley of
a stream, where no foot came. In the mood I was in, it was even
touching to behold the place untenanted; it lacked Olalla; and I
thought of the delight and glory of a life passed wholly with her in
that strong air, and among these rugged and lovely surroundings, at
first with a whimpering sentiment, and then again with such a fiery
joy that I seemed to grow in strength and stature, like a Samson.</p>

<p>And then suddenly I was aware of drawing near. She appeared out of
a grove of cork-trees, and came straight towards me; and I stood up
and waited. She seemed in her walking a creature of such life and
fire and lightness as amazed me; yet she came quietly and slowly. Her
energy was in the slowness; but for inimitable strength, I felt she
would have run, she would have flown to me. Still, as she approached,
she kept her eyes lowered to the ground; and when she had drawn quite
near, it was without one glance that she addressed me. At the first
note of her voice I started. It was for this I had been waiting; this
was the last test of my love. And lo, her enunciation was precise and
clear, not lisping and incomplete like that of her family; and the
voice, though deeper than usual with women, was still both youthful
and womanly. She spoke in a rich chord; golden contralto strains
mingled with hoarseness, as the red threads were mingled with the
brown among her tresses. It was not only a voice that spoke to my
heart directly; but it spoke to me of her. And yet her words
immediately plunged me back upon despair.</p>

<p>'You will go away,' she said, 'to-day.'</p>

<p>Her example broke the bonds of my speech; I felt as lightened of a
weight, or as if a spell had been dissolved. I know not in what words
I answered; but, standing before her on the cliffs, I poured out the
whole ardour of my love, telling her that I lived upon the thought of
her, slept only to dream of her loveliness, and would gladly forswear
my country, my language, and my friends, to live for ever by her
side. And then, strongly commanding myself, I changed the note; I
reassured, I comforted her; I told her I had divined in her a pious
and heroic spirit, with which I was worthy to sympathise, and which I
longed to share and lighten. 'Nature,' I told her, 'was the voice of
God, which men disobey at peril; and if we were thus humbly drawn
together, ay, even as by a miracle of love, it must imply a divine
fitness in our souls; we must be made,' I said--'made for one
another. We should be mad rebels,' I cried out--'mad rebels against
God, not to obey this instinct.'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'You will go to-day,' she repeated, and then
with a gesture, and in a sudden, sharp note--'no, not to-day,' she
cried, 'to-morrow!'</p>

<p>But at this sign of relenting, power came in upon me in a tide. I
stretched out my arms and called upon her name; and she leaped to me
and clung to me. The hills rocked about us, the earth quailed; a
shock as of a blow went through me and left me blind and dizzy. And
the next moment she had thrust me back, broken rudely from my arms,
and fled with the speed of a deer among the cork-trees.</p>

<p>I stood and shouted to the mountains; I turned and went back
towards the residencia, waltzing upon air. She sent me away, and yet
I had but to call upon her name and she came to me. These were but
the weaknesses of girls, from which even she, the strangest of her
sex, was not exempted. Go? Not I, --O, not I, Olalla, my Olalla! A
bird sang near by; and in that season, birds were rare. It bade me be
of good cheer. And once more the whole countenance of nature, from
the ponderous and stable mountains down to the lightest leaf and the
smallest darting fly in the shadow of the groves, began to stir
before me and to put on the lineaments of life and wear a face of
awful joy. The sunshine struck upon the hills, strong as a hammer on
the anvil, and the hills shook; the earth, under that vigorous
insulation, yielded up heady scents; the woods smouldered in the
blaze. I felt the thrill of travail and delight run through the
earth. Something elemental, something rude, violent, and savage, in
the love that sang in my heart, was like a key to nature's secrets;
and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive and
friendly. Olalla! Her touch had quickened, and renewed, and strung me
up to the old pitch of concert with the rugged earth, to a swelling
of the soul that men learn to forget in their polite assemblies. Love
burned in me like rage; tenderness waxed fierce; I hated, I adored, I
pitied, I revered her with ecstasy. She seemed the link that bound me
in with dead things on the one hand, and with our pure and pitying
God upon the other: a thing brutal and divine, and akin at once to
the innocence and to the unbridled forces of the earth.</p>

<p>My head thus reeling, I came into the courtyard of the residencia,
and the sight of the mother struck me like a revelation. She sat
there, all sloth and contentment, blinking under the strong sunshine,
branded with a passive enjoyment, a creature set quite apart, before
whom my ardour fell away like a thing ashamed. I stopped a moment,
and, commanding such shaken tones as I was able, said a word or two.
She looked at me with her unfathomable kindness; her voice in reply
sounded vaguely out of the realm of peace in which she slumbered, and
there fell on my mind, for the first time, a sense of respect for one
so uniformly innocent and happy, and I passed on in a kind of wonder
at myself, that I should be so much disquieted.</p>

<p>On my table there lay a piece of the same yellow paper I had seen
in the north room; it was written on with pencil in the same hand, 's
hand, and I picked it up with a sudden sinking of alarm, and read,
'If you have any kindness for Olalla, if you have any chivalry for a
creature sorely wrought, go from here to-day; in pity, in honour, for
the sake of Him who died, I supplicate that you shall go.' I looked
at this awhile in mere stupidity, then I began to awaken to a
weariness and horror of life; the sunshine darkened outside on the
bare hills, and I began to shake like a man in terror. The vacancy
thus suddenly opened in my life unmanned me like a physical void. It
was not my heart, it was not my happiness, it was life itself that
was involved. I could not lose her. I said so, and stood repeating
it. And then, like one in a dream, I moved to the window, put forth
my hand to open the casement, and thrust it through the pane. The
blood spurted from my wrist; and with an instantaneous quietude and
command of myself, I pressed my thumb on the little leaping fountain,
and reflected what to do. In that empty room there was nothing to my
purpose; I felt, besides, that I required assistance. There shot into
my mind a hope that Olalla herself might be my helper, and I turned
and went down stairs, still keeping my thumb upon the wound.</p>

<p>There was no sign of either or Felipe, and I addressed myself to
the recess, whither the Senora had now drawn quite back and sat
dozing close before the fire, for no degree of heat appeared too much
for her.</p>

<p>'Pardon me,' said I, 'if I disturb you, but I must apply to you
for help.'</p>

<p>She looked up sleepily and asked me what it was, and with the very
words I thought she drew in her breath with a widening of the
nostrils and seemed to come suddenly and fully alive.</p>

<p>'I have cut myself,' I said, 'and rather badly. See!' And I held
out my two hands from which the blood was oozing and dripping.</p>

<p>Her great eyes opened wide, the pupils shrank into points; a veil
seemed to fall from her face, and leave it sharply expressive and yet
inscrutable. And as I still stood, marvelling a little at her
disturbance, she came swiftly up to me, and stooped and caught me by
the hand; and the next moment my hand was at her mouth, and she had
bitten me to the bone. The pang of the bite, the sudden spurting of
blood, and the monstrous horror of the act, flashed through me all in
one, and I beat her back; and she sprang at me again and again, with
bestial cries, cries that I recognised, such cries as had awakened me
on the night of the high wind. Her strength was like that of madness;
mine was rapidly ebbing with the loss of blood; my mind besides was
whirling with the abhorrent strangeness of the onslaught, and I was
already forced against the wall, when ran betwixt us, and Felipe,
following at a bound, pinned down his mother on the floor.</p>

<p>A trance-like weakness fell upon me; I saw, heard, and felt, but I
was incapable of movement. I heard the struggle roll to and fro upon
the floor, the yells of that catamount ringing up to Heaven as she
strove to reach me. I felt clasp me in her arms, her hair falling on
my face, and, with the strength of a man, raise and half drag, half
carry me upstairs into my own room, where she cast me down upon the
bed. Then I saw her hasten to the door and lock it, and stand an
instant listening to the savage cries that shook the residencia. And
then, swift and light as a thought, she was again beside me, binding
up my hand, laying it in her bosom, moaning and mourning over it with
dove-like sounds. They were not words that came to her, they were
sounds more beautiful than speech, infinitely touching, infinitely
tender; and yet as I lay there, a thought stung to my heart, a
thought wounded me like a sword, a thought, like a worm in a flower,
profaned the holiness of my love. Yes, they were beautiful sounds,
and they were inspired by human tenderness; but was their beauty
human?</p>

<p>All day I lay there. For a long time the cries of that nameless
female thing, as she struggled with her half-witted whelp, resounded
through the house, and pierced me with despairing sorrow and disgust.
They were the death-cry of my love; my love was murdered; was not
only dead, but an offence to me; and yet, think as I pleased, feel as
I must, it still swelled within me like a storm of sweetness, and my
heart melted at her looks and touch. This horror that had sprung out,
this doubt upon , this savage and bestial strain that ran not only
through the whole behaviour of her family, but found a place in the
very foundations and story of our love--though it appalled, though it
shocked and sickened me, was yet not of power to break the knot of my
infatuation.</p>

<p>When the cries had ceased, there came a scraping at the door, by
which I knew Felipe was without; and went and spoke to him---I know
not what. With that exception, she stayed close beside me, now
kneeling by my bed and fervently praying, now sitting with her eyes
upon mine. So then, for these six hours I drank in her beauty, and
silently perused the story in her face. I saw the golden coin hover
on her breaths; I saw her eyes darken and brighter, and still speak
no language but that of an unfathomable kindness; I saw the faultless
face, and, through the robe, the lines of the faultless body. Night
came at last, and in the growing darkness of the chamber, the sight
of her slowly melted; but even then the touch of her smooth hand
lingered in mine and talked with me. To lie thus in deadly weakness
and drink in the traits of the beloved, is to reawake to love from
whatever shock of disillusion. I reasoned with myself; and I shut my
eyes on horrors, and again I was very bold to accept the worst. What
mattered it, if that imperious sentiment survived; if her eyes still
beckoned and attached me; if now, even as before, every fibre of my
dull body yearned and turned to her? Late on in the night some
strength revived in me, and I spoke:-</p>

<p>',' I said, 'nothing matters; I ask nothing; I am content; I love
you.'</p>

<p>She knelt down awhile and prayed, and I devoutly respected her
devotions. The moon had begun to shine in upon one side of each of
the three windows, and make a misty clearness in the room, by which I
saw her indistinctly. When she rearose she made the sign of the
cross.</p>

<p>'It is for me to speak,' she said, 'and for you to listen. I know;
you can but guess. I prayed, how I prayed for you to leave this
place. I begged it of you, and I know you would have granted me even
this; or if not, O let me think so!'</p>

<p>'I love you,' I said.</p>

<p>'And yet you have lived in the world,' she said; after a pause,
'you are a man and wise; and I am but a child. Forgive me, if I seem
to teach, who am as ignorant as the trees of the mountain; but those
who learn much do but skim the face of knowledge; they seize the
laws, they conceive the dignity of the design--the horror of the
living fact fades from their memory. It is we who sit at home with
evil who remember, I think, and are warned and pity. Go, rather, go
now, and keep me in mind. So I shall have a life in the cherished
places of your memory: a life as much my own, as that which I lead in
this body.'</p>

<p>'I love you,' I said once more; and reaching out my weak hand,
took hers, and carried it to my lips, and kissed it. Nor did she
resist, but winced a little; and I could see her look upon me with a
frown that was not unkindly, only sad and baffled. And then it seemed
she made a call upon her resolution; plucked my hand towards her,
herself at the same time leaning somewhat forward, and laid it on the
beating of her heart. 'There,' she cried, 'you feel the very footfall
of my life. It only moves for you; it is yours. But is it even mine?
It is mine indeed to offer you, as I might take the coin from my
neck, as I might break a live branch from a tree, and give it you.
And yet not mine! I dwell, or I think I dwell (if I exist at all),
somewhere apart, an impotent prisoner, and carried about and deafened
by a mob that I disown. This capsule, such as throbs against the
sides of animals, knows you at a touch for its master; ay, it loves
you! But my soul, does my soul? I think not; I know not, fearing to
ask. Yet when you spoke to me your words were of the soul; it is of
the soul that you ask--it is only from the soul that you would take
me.'</p>

<p>',' I said, 'the soul and the body are one, and mostly so in love.
What the body chooses, the soul loves; where the body clings, the
soul cleaves; body for body, soul to soul, they come together at
God's signal; and the lower part (if we can call aught low) is only
the footstool and foundation of the highest.'</p>

<p>'Have you,' she said, 'seen the portraits in the house of my
fathers? Have you looked at my mother or at Felipe? Have your eyes
never rested on that picture that hangs by your bed? She who sat for
it died ages ago; and she did evil in her life. But, look--again:
there is my hand to the least line, there are my eyes and my hair.
What is mine, then, and what am I? If not a curve in this poor body
of mine (which you love, and for the sake of which you dotingly dream
that you love me) not a gesture that I can frame, not a tone of my
voice, not any look from my eyes, no, not even now when I speak to
him I love, but has belonged to others? Others, ages dead, have wooed
other men with my eyes; other men have heard the pleading of the same
voice that now sounds in your ears. The hands of the dead are in my
bosom; they move me, they pluck me, they guide me; I am a puppet at
their command; and I but reinform features and attributes that have
long been laid aside from evil in the quiet of the grave. Is it me
you love, friend? or the race that made me? The girl who does not
know and cannot answer for the least portion of herself? or the
stream of which she is a transitory eddy, the tree of which she is
the passing fruit? The race exists; it is old, it is ever young, it
carries its eternal destiny in its bosom; upon it, like waves upon
the sea, individual succeeds to individual, mocked with a semblance
of self-control, but they are nothing. We speak of the soul, but the
soul is in the race.'</p>

<p>'You fret against the common law,' I said. 'You rebel against the
voice of God, which he has made so winning to convince, so imperious
to command. Hear it, and how it speaks between us! Your hand clings
to mine, your heart leaps at my touch, the unknown elements of which
we are compounded awake and run together at a look; the clay of the
earth remembers its independent life and yearns to join us; we are
drawn together as the stars are turned about in space, or as the
tides ebb and flow, by things older and greater than we
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'Alas!' she said, 'what can I say to you? My fathers, eight
hundred years ago, ruled all this province: they were wise, great,
cunning, and cruel; they were a picked race of the Spanish; their
flags led in war; the king called them his cousin; the people, when
the rope was slung for them or when they returned and found their
hovels smoking, blasphemed their name. Presently a change began. Man
has risen; if he has sprung from the brutes, he can descend again to
the same level. The breath of weariness blew on their humanity and
the cords relaxed; they began to go down; their minds fell on sleep,
their passions awoke in gusts, heady and senseless like the wind in
the gutters of the mountains; beauty was still handed down, but no
longer the guiding wit nor the human heart; the seed passed on, it
was wrapped in flesh, the flesh covered the bones, but they were the
bones and the flesh of brutes, and their mind was as the mind of
flies. I speak to you as I dare; but you have seen for yourself how
the wheel has gone backward with my doomed race. I stand, as it were,
upon a little rising ground in this desperate descent, and see both
before and behind, both what we have lost and to what we are
condemned to go farther downward. And shall I--I that dwell apart in
the house of the dead, my body, loathing its ways--shall I repeat the
spell? Shall I bind another spirit, reluctant as my own, into this
bewitched and tempest-broken tenement that I now suffer in? Shall I
hand down this cursed vessel of humanity, charge it with fresh life
as with fresh poison, and dash it, like a fire, in the faces of
posterity? But my vow has been given; the race shall cease from off
the earth. At this hour my brother is making ready; his foot will
soon be on the stair; and you will go with him and pass out of my
sight for ever. Think of me sometimes as one to whom the lesson of
life was very harshly told, but who heard it with courage; as one who
loved you indeed, but who hated herself so deeply that her love was
hateful to her; as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to
keep you for ever; who had no dearer hope than to forget you, and no
greater fear than to be forgotten.'</p>

<p>She had drawn towards the door as she spoke, her rich voice
sounding softer and farther away; and with the last word she was
gone, and I lay alone in the moonlit chamber. What I might have done
had not I lain bound by my extreme weakness, I know not; but as it
was there fell upon me a great and blank despair. It was not long
before there shone in at the door the ruddy glimmer of a lantern, and
Felipe coming, charged me without a word upon his shoulders, and
carried me down to the great gate, where the cart was waiting. In the
moonlight the hills stood out sharply, as if they were of cardboard;
on the glimmering surface of the plateau, and from among the low
trees which swung together and sparkled in the wind, the great black
cube of the residencia stood out bulkily, its mass only broken by
three dimly lighted windows in the northern front above the gate.
They were 's windows, and as the cart jolted onwards I kept my eyes
fixed upon them till, where the road dipped into a valley, they were
lost to my view forever. Felipe walked in silence beside the shafts,
but from time to time he would cheek the mule and seem to look back
upon me; and at length drew quite near and laid his hand upon my
head. There was such kindness in the touch, and such a simplicity, as
of the brutes, that tears broke from me like the bursting of an
artery.</p>

<p>'Felipe,' I said, 'take me where they will ask no questions.'</p>

<p>He said never a word, but he turned his mule about, end for end,
retraced some part of the way we had gone, and, striking into another
path, led me to the mountain village, which was, as we say in
Scotland, the kirkton of that thinly peopled district. Some broken
memories dwell in my mind of the day breaking over the plain, of the
cart stopping, of arms that helped me down, of a bare room into which
I was carried, and of a swoon that fell upon me like sleep.</p>

<p>The next day and the days following the old priest was often at my
side with his snuff-box and prayer book, and after a while, when I
began to pick up strength, he told me that I was now on a fair way to
recovery, and must as soon as possible hurry my departure; whereupon,
without naming any reason, he took snuff and looked at me sideways. I
did not affect ignorance; I knew he must have seen . 'Sir,' said I,
'you know that I do not ask in wantonness. What of that family?'</p>

<p>He said they were very unfortunate; that it seemed a declining
race, and that they were very poor and had been much neglected.</p>

<p>'But she has not,' I said. 'Thanks, doubtless, to yourself, she is
instructed and wise beyond the use of women.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said; 'the Senorita is well-informed. But the family has
been neglected.'</p>

<p>'The mother?' I queried.</p>

<p>'Yes, the mother too,' said the Padre, taking snuff. 'But Felipe
is a well-intentioned lad.'</p>

<p>'The mother is odd?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Very odd,' replied the priest.</p>

<p>'I think, sir, we beat about the bush,' said I. 'You must know
more of my affairs than you allow. You must know my curiosity to be
justified on many grounds. Will you not be frank with me?'</p>

<p>'My son,' said the old gentleman, 'I will be very frank with you
on matters within my competence; on those of which I know nothing it
does not require much discretion to be silent. I will not fence with
you, I take your meaning perfectly; and what can I say, but that we
are all in God's hands, and that His ways are not as our ways? I have
even advised with my superiors in the church, but they, too, were
dumb. It is a great mystery.'</p>

<p>'Is she mad?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I will answer you according to my belief. She is not,' returned
the Padre, 'or she was not. When she was young--God help me, I fear I
neglected that wild lamb--she was surely sane; and yet, although it
did not run to such heights, the same strain was already notable; it
had been so before her in her father, ay, and before him, and this
inclined me, perhaps, to think too lightly of it. But these things go
on growing, not only in the individual but in the race.'</p>

<p>'When she was young,' I began, and my voice failed me for a
moment, and it was only with a great effort that I was able to add,
'was she like ?'</p>

<p>'Now God forbid!' exclaimed the Padre. 'God forbid that any man
should think so slightingly of my favourite penitent. No, no; the
Senorita (but for her beauty, which I wish most honestly she had less
of) has not a hair's resemblance to what her mother was at the same
age. I could not bear to have you think so; though, Heaven knows, it
were, perhaps, better that you should.'</p>

<p>At this, I raised myself in bed, and opened my heart to the old
man; telling him of our love and of her decision, owning my own
horrors, my own passing fancies, but telling him that these were at
an end; and with something more than a purely formal submission,
appealing to his judgment.</p>

<p>He heard me very patiently and without surprise; and when I had
done, he sat for some time silent. Then he began: 'The church,' and
instantly broke off again to apologise. 'I had forgotten, my child,
that you were not a Christian,' said he. 'And indeed, upon a point so
highly unusual, even the church can scarce be said to have decided.
But would you have my opinion? The Senorita is, in a matter of this
kind, the best judge; I would accept her judgment.'</p>

<p>On the back of that he went away, nor was he thenceforward so
assiduous in his visits; indeed, even when I began to get about
again, he plainly feared and deprecated my society, not as in
distaste but much as a man might be disposed to flee from the
riddling sphynx. The villagers, too, avoided me; they were unwilling
to be my guides upon the mountain. I thought they looked at me
askance, and I made sure that the more superstitious crossed
themselves on my approach. At first I set this down to my heretical
opinions; but it began at length to dawn upon me that if I was thus
redoubted it was because I had stayed at the residencia. All men
despise the savage notions of such peasantry; and yet I was conscious
of a chill shadow that seemed to fall and dwell upon my love. It did
not conquer, but I may not deify that it restrained my ardour.</p>

<p>Some miles westward of the village there was a gap in the sierra,
from which the eye plunged direct upon the residencia; and thither it
became my daily habit to repair. A wood crowned the summit; and just
where the pathway issued from its fringes, it was overhung by a
considerable shelf of rock, and that, in its turn, was surmounted by
a crucifix of the size of life and more than usually painful in
design. This was my perch; thence, day after day, I looked down upon
the plateau, and the great old house, and could see Felipe, no bigger
than a fly, going to and fro about the garden. Sometimes mists would
draw across the view, and be broken up again by mountain winds;
sometimes the plain slumbered below me in unbroken sunshine; it would
sometimes be all blotted out by rain. This distant post, these
interrupted sights of the place where my life had been so strangely
changed, suited the indecision of my humour. I passed whole days
there, debating with myself the various elements of our position; now
leaning to the suggestions of love, now giving an ear to prudence,
and in the end halting irresolute between the two.</p>

<p>One day, as I was sitting on my rock, there came by that way a
somewhat gaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle. He was a stranger, and
plainly did not know me even by repute; for, instead of keeping the
other side, he drew near and sat down beside me, and we had soon
fallen in talk. Among other things he told me he had been a muleteer,
and in former years had much frequented these mountains; later on, he
had followed the army with his mules, had realised a competence, and
was now living retired with his family.</p>

<p>'Do you know that house?' I inquired, at last, pointing to the
residencia, for I readily wearied of any talk that kept me from the
thought of .</p>

<p>He looked at me darkly and crossed himself.</p>

<p>'Too well,' he said, 'it was there that one of my comrades sold
himself to Satan; the Virgin shield us from temptations! He has paid
the price; he is now burning in the reddest place in Hell!'</p>

<p>A fear came upon me; I could answer nothing; and presently the man
resumed, as if to himself: 'Yes,' he said, 'O yes, I know it. I have
passed its doors. There was snow upon the pass, the wind was driving
it; sure enough there was death that night upon the mountains, but
there was worse beside the hearth. I took him by the arm, Senor, and
dragged him to the gate; I conjured him, by all he loved and
respected, to go forth with me; I went on my knees before him in the
snow; and I could see he was moved by my entreaty. And just then she
came out on the gallery, and called him by his name; and he turned,
and there was she standing with a lamp in her hand and smiling on him
to come back. I cried out aloud to God, and threw my arms about him,
but he put me by, and left me alone. He had made his choice; God help
us. I would pray for him, but to what end? there are sins that not
even the Pope can loose.'</p>

<p>'And your friend,' I asked, 'what became of him?'</p>

<p>'Nay, God knows,' said the muleteer. 'If all be true that we hear,
his end was like his sin, a thing to raise the hair.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean that he was killed?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Sure enough, he was killed,' returned the man. 'But how? Ay, how?
But these are things that it is sin to speak of.'</p>

<p>'The people of that house...' I began.</p>

<p>But he interrupted me with a savage outburst. 'The people?' he
cried. 'What people? There are neither men nor women in that house of
Satan's! What? have you lived here so long, and never heard?' And
here he put his mouth to my ear and whispered, as if even the fowls
of the mountain might have over-heard and been stricken with
horror.</p>

<p>What he told me was not true, nor was it even original; being,
indeed, but a new edition, vamped up again by village ignorance and
superstition, of stories nearly as ancient as the race of man. It was
rather the application that appalled me. In the old days, he said,
the church would have burned out that nest of basilisks; but the arm
of the church was now shortened; his friend Miguel had been
unpunished by the hands of men, and left to the more awful judgment
of an offended God. This was wrong; but it should be so no more. The
Padre was sunk in age; he was even bewitched himself; but the eyes of
his flock were now awake to their own danger; and some day--ay, and
before long--the smoke of that house should go up to heaven.</p>

<p>He left me filled with horror and fear. Which way to turn I knew
not; whether first to warn the Padre, or to carry my ill-news direct
to the threatened inhabitants of the residencia. Fate was to decide
for me; for, while I was still hesitating, I beheld the veiled figure
of a woman drawing near to me up the pathway. No veil could deceive
my penetration; by every line and every movement I recognised ; and
keeping hidden behind a corner of the rock, I suffered her to gain
the summit. Then I came forward. She knew me and paused, but did not
speak; I, too, remained silent; and we continued for some time to
gaze upon each other with a passionate sadness.</p>

<p>'I thought you had gone,' she said at length. 'It is all that you
can do for me--to go. It is all I ever asked of you. And you still
stay. But do you know, that every day heaps up the peril of death,
not only on your head, but on ours? A report has gone about the
mountain; it is thought you love me, and the people will not suffer
it.'</p>

<p>I saw she was already informed of her danger, and I rejoiced at
it. ',' I said, 'I am ready to go this day, this very hour, but not
alone.'</p>

<p>She stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray, and
I stood by and looked now at her and now at the object of her
adoration, now at the living figure of the penitent, and now at the
ghastly, daubed countenance, the painted wounds, and the projected
ribs of the image. The silence was only broken by the wailing of some
large birds that circled sidelong, as if in surprise or alarm, about
the summit of the hills. Presently rose again, turned towards me,
raised her veil, and, still leaning with one hand on the shaft of the
crucifix, looked upon me with a pale and sorrowful countenance.</p>

<p>'I have laid my hand upon the cross,' she said. 'The Padre says
you are no Christian; but look up for a moment with my eyes, and
behold the face of the Man of Sorrows. We are all such as He
was---the inheritors of sin; we must all bear and expiate a past
which was not ours; there is in all of us--ay, even in me--a sparkle
of the divine. Like Him, we must endure for a little while, until
morning returns bringing peace. Suffer me to pass on upon my way
alone; it is thus that I shall be least lonely, counting for my
friend Him who is the friend of all the distressed; it is thus that I
shall be the most happy, having taken my farewell of earthly
happiness, and willingly accepted sorrow for my portion.'</p>

<p>I looked at the face of the crucifix, and, though I was no friend
to images, and despised that imitative and grimacing art of which it
was a rude example, some sense of what the thing implied was carried
home to my intelligence. The face looked down upon me with a painful
and deadly contraction; but the rays of a glory encircled it, and
reminded me that the sacrifice was voluntary. It stood there,
crowning the rock, as it still stands on so many highway sides,
vainly preaching to passers-by, an emblem of sad and noble truths;
that pleasure is not an end, but an accident; that pain is the choice
of the magnanimous; that it is best to suffer all things and do well.
I turned and went down the mountain in silence; and when I looked
back for the last time before the wood closed about my path, I saw
still leaning on the crucifix.</p>
