<p class="first">IT was after nine o'clock when the bell rang,
and descending to the dimly lighted hall I opened the front door,
at first on the chain to be sure of my visitor. Seeing, as I had
hoped, the face of our friend, Ralph Quentin, I took off the
chain and he entered with a blast of sharp November air for
company. I had to throw my weight upon the door to close it
against the wind.</p>

<p>As he removed his hat and cloak he laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"You're very cautious, Santallos. I thought you were about to
demand a password before admitting me."</p>

<p>"It is well to be cautious," I retorted. "This house stands
somewhat alone, and thieves are everywhere."</p>

<p>"It would require a thief of considerable muscle to make off
with some of your treasures. That stone tomb-thing, for instance;
what do you call it?"</p>

<p>"The Beni Hassan sarcophagus. Yes. But what of the gilded
inner case, and what of the woman it contains? A thief of
judgment and intelligence might covet that treasure and strive to
deprive me of it. Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>He only laughed again, and counterfeited a shudder.</p>

<p>"The woman! Don't remind me that such a brown, shriveled,
mummy-horror was ever a woman!"</p>

<p>"But she was. Doubtless in her day my poor Princess of Naarn
was soft, appealing; a creature of red, moist lips and eyes like
stars in the black Egyptian sky. 'The Songstress of the House'
she was called, ere she became Ta-Nezem the Osirian. But I keep
you standing here in the cold hall. Come upstairs with me. Did I
tell you that Beatrice is not here tonight?"</p>

<p>"No?" His intonation expressed surprise and frank
disappointment. "Then I can't say good-by to her? Didn't you
receive my note? I'm to take Sanderson's place as manager of the
sales department in Chicago, and I'm off tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Congratulations. Yes, we had your note, but Beatrice was
given an opportunity to join some friends on a Southern trip. The
notice was short, but of late she has not been so well and I
urged her to go. This November air is cruelly damp and
bitter."</p>

<p>"What was it&mdash;a yachting cruise?"</p>

<p>"A long cruise. She left this afternoon. I have been sitting
in her boudoir, Quentin, thinking of her, and I'll tell you about
it there&mdash;if you don't mind?"</p>

<p>"Wherever you like," he conceded, though in a tone of some
surprise. I suppose he had not credited me with so much
sentiment, or thought it odd that I should wish to share it with
another, even so good a friend as he. "You must find it fearfully
lonesome here without Bee," he continued.</p>

<p>"A trifle." We were ascending the dark stairs now. "After
tonight, however, things will be quite different. Do you know
that I have sold the house?"</p>

<p>"No! Why, you are full of astonishments, old chap. Found a
better place with more space for your tear-jars and
tombstones?"</p>

<p>He meant, I assumed, a witty reference to my collection of
Coptic and Egyptian treasures, well and dearly bought, but so
much trash to a man of Quentin's youth and temperament.</p>

<p>I opened the door of my wife's boudoir, and it was pleasant to
pass into such rosy light and warmth out of the stern, dark cold
of the hall. Yet it was an old house, full of unexpected drafts.
Even here there was a draft so strong that a heavy velour curtain
at the far side of the room continually rippled and billowed out,
like a loose rose-colored sail. Never far enough, though, to show
what was behind it.</p>

<p>My friend settled himself on the frail little chair that stood
before my wife's dressing-table. It was the kind of chair that
women love and most men loathe, but Quentin, for all his weight
and stature, had a touch of the feminine about him, or perhaps of
the feline. Like a cat, he moved delicately. He was blond and
tall, with fine, regular features, a ready laugh, and the clean
charm of youth about him&mdash;also its occasional blundering
candor.</p>

<p>As I looked at him sitting there, graceful, at ease, I wished
that his mind might have shared the litheness of his body. He
could have understood me so much better.</p>

<p>"I have indeed found a place for my collections," I observed,
seating myself near by. "In fact, with a single
exception&mdash;the Ta-Nezem sarcophagus&mdash;the entire lot is
going to the dealers." Seeing his expression of astonished
disbelief I continued: "The truth is, my dear Quentin, that J
have been guilty of gross injustice to our Beatrice. I have been
too good a collector and too neglectful a husband. My 'tear-jars
and tombstones,' in fact, have enjoyed an attention that might
better have been elsewhere bestowed. Yes, Beatrice has left me
alone, but the instant that some few last affairs are settled I
intend rejoining her. And you yourself are leaving. At least,
none of us three will be left to miss the others'
friendship."</p>

<p>"You are quite surprising tonight, Santallos. But, by Jove,
I'm not sorry to hear any of it! It's not my place to criticize,
and Bee's not the sort to complain. But living here in this
lonely old barn of a house, doing all her own work, practically
deserted by her friends, must have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hard, very hard," I interrupted him softly, "for one so young
and lovely as our Beatrice. But if I have been blind at least the
awakening has come. You should have seen her face when she heard
the news. It was wonderful. We were standing, just she and I, in
the midst of my tear-jars and tombstones&mdash;my 'chamber of
horrors' she named it. You are so apt at amusing phrases, both of
you. We stood beside the great stone sarcophagus from the
Necropolis of Beni Hassan. Across the trestles beneath it lay the
gilded inner case wherein Ta-Nezem the Osirian had slept out so
many centuries. You know its appearance. A thing of beautiful,
gleaming lines, like the quaint, smiling image of a golden
woman.</p>

<p>"Then I lifted the lid and showed Beatrice that the one-time
songstress, the handmaiden of Amen, slept there no more, and the
case was empty. You know, too, that Beatrice never liked my
princess. For a jest she used to declare that she was jealous.
Jealous of a woman dead and ugly so many thousand years!
Or&mdash;but that was only in anger&mdash;that I had bought Ta-Nezem with what would have given her, Beatrice, all the pleasure
she lacked in life. Oh, she was not too patient to reproach me,
Quentin, but only in anger and hot blood.</p>

<p>"So I showed her the empty case, and I said, 'Beloved wife,
never again need you be jealous of Ta-Nezem. All that is in this
room save her and her belongings I have sold, but her I could not
bear to sell. That which I love, no man else shall share or own.
So I have destroyed her. I have rent her body to brown, aromatic
shreds. I have burned her; it is as if she had never been. And
now, dearest of the dear, you shall take for your own all the
care, all the keeping that Heretofore I have lavished upon the
Princess of Naam.'</p>

<p>"Beatrice turned from the empty case as if she could scarcely
believe her hearing, but when she saw by the look in my eyes that
I meant exactly what I said, neither more nor less, you should
have seen her face, my dear Quentin&mdash;you should have seen
her face!"</p>

<p>"I can imagine." He laughed, rather shortly. For some reason
my guest seemed increasingly ill at ease, and glanced continually
about the little rose-and-white room that was the one luxurious,
thoroughly feminine corner&mdash;that and the cold, dark room
behind the curtain&mdash;in what he had justly called my "barn of
a house."</p>

<p>"Santallos," he continued abruptly, and I thought rather
rudely, "you should have a portrait done as you look tonight. You
might have posed for one of those stern old hidalgos
of&mdash;which painter was it who did so many Spanish dons and
donesses?"</p>

<p>"You perhaps mean Velasquez," I answered with mild courtesy,
though secretly and as always his crude personalities displeased
me. "My father, you may recall, was of Cordova in southern Spain.
But&mdash;must you go so soon? First drink one glass with me to
our missing Beatrice. See how I was warming my blood against the
wind that blows in, even here. The wine is Amontillado, some that
was sent me by a friend of my father's from the very vineyards
where the grapes were grown and pressed. And for many years it
has ripened since it came here. Before she went, Beatrice drank
of it from one of these same glasses. True wine of Montilla! See
how it lives&mdash;like fire in amber, with a glimmer of blood
behind it."</p>

<p>I held high the decanter and the light gleamed through it upon
his face.</p>

<p>"Amontillado! Isn't that a kind of sherry? I'm no connoisseur
of wines, as you know. But&mdash;Amontillado."</p>

<p>For a moment he studied the wine I had given him, liquid flame
in the crystal glass. Then his face cleared.</p>

<p>"I remember the association now. 'The Cask of Amontillado.'
Ever read the story?"</p>

<p>"I seem to recall it dimly."</p>

<p>"Horrible, fascinating sort of a yarn. A fellow takes his
trustful friend down into the cellars to sample some wine, traps
him and walls him up in a niche. Buries him alive, you
understand. Read it when I was a youngster, and it made a deep
impression, partly, I think, because I couldn't for the life of
me comprehend a nature&mdash;even an Italian
nature&mdash;desiring so horrible a form of vengeance. You're
half Latin yourself, Santallos. Can you elucidate?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if you would ever understand," I responded slowly,
wondering how even Quentin could be so crude, so tactless. "Such
a revenge might have its merits, since the offender would be a
long time dying. But merely to kill seems to me so pitifully
inadequate. Now I, if I were driven to revenge, should never be
contented by killing. I should wish to follow."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;beyond the grave?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "Why not? Wouldn't that be the very apotheosis of
hatred? I'm trying to interpret the Latin nature, as you asked me
to do."</p>

<p>"Confound you, for an instant I thought you were serious. The
way you said it made me actually shiver!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I observed, "or perhaps it was the draft. See, Quentin,
how that curtain billows out."</p>

<p>His eyes followed my glance. Continually the heavy, rose-colored curtain that wag hung before the door of my wife's
bedroom bulged outward, shook and quivered like a bellying sail,
as draperies will with a wind behind them.</p>

<p>His eyes strayed from the curtain, met mine and fell again to
the wine in his glass. Suddenly he drained it, not as would a man
who was a judge of wines, but hastily, indifferently, without
thought for its flavor or bouquet. I raised my glass in the toast
he had forgotten.</p>

<p>"To our Beatrice," I said, and drained mine also, though with
more appreciation.</p>

<p>"To Beatrice&mdash;of course." He looked at the bottom of his
empty glass, then before I could offer to refill it, rose from
his chair.</p>

<p>"I must go, old man. When you write to Bee, tell her I'm sorry
to have missed her."</p>

<p>"Before she could receive a letter from me I shall be with
her&mdash;I hope. How cold the house is tonight, and the wind
breathes everywhere. See how the curtain blows, Quentin."</p>

<p>"So it does." He set his glass on the tray beside the
decanter. Upon first entering the room he had been smiling, but
now his straight, fine brows were drawn in a perpetual, troubled
frown, his eyes looked here and there, and would never meet
mine&mdash; which were steady. "There's a wind," he added, "that
blows along this wall&mdash;curious. One can't notice any draft
there, either. But it must blow there, and of course the curtain
billows out."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Of course it billows out."</p>

<p>"Or is there another door behind that curtain?"</p>

<p>His careful ignorance of what any fool might infer from mere
appearance brought an involuntary smile to my lips. Nevertheless,
I answered him.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course there is a door. An open door."</p>

<p>His frown deepened. My true and simple replies appeared to
cause him a certain irritation.</p>

<p>"As I feel now," I added, "even to cross the room would be an
effort. I am tired and weak tonight. As Beatrice once said, my
strength beside yours is as a child's to that of a grown man.
Won't you close that door for me, dear friend?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes, I will. I didn't know you were ill. If that's
the case, you shouldn't be alone in this empty house. Shall I
stay with you for a while?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he walked across the room. His hand was on the
curtain, but before it could be drawn aside my voice checked
him.</p>

<p>"Quentin," I said, "are even you quite strong enough to close
that door?"</p>

<p>Looking back at me, chin on shoulder, his face appeared
scarcely familiar, so drawn was it in lines of bewilderment and
half-suspicion.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? You are very odd tonight. Is the door so
heavy then? What door is it?"</p>

<p>I made no reply.</p>

<p>As if against their owner's will his eyes fled from mine, he
turned and hastily pushed aside the heavy drapery.</p>

<p>Behind it my wife's bedroom lay dark and cold, with windows
open to the invading winds.</p>

<p>And erect in the doorway, uncovered, stood an ancient gilded
coffin-case. It was the golden casket of Ta-Nezem, but its
occupant was more beautiful than the poor, shriveled Songstress
of Naam.</p>

<p>Bound across her bosom were the strange, quaint jewels which
had been found in the sarcophagus. Ta-Nezem's amulets&mdash;heads
of Hathor and Horus the sacred eye, the uroeus, even the heavy
dull-green scarab, the amulet for purity of heart&mdash;there
they rested upon the bosom of her who had been mistress of my
house, now Beatrice the Osirian. Beneath them her white, stiff
body was enwrapped in the same crackling dry, brown linen bands,
impregnated with the gums and resins of embalmers dead these many
thousand years, which had been about the body of Ta-Nezem.</p>

<p>Above the white translucence of her brow appeared the winged
disk, emblem of Ra. The twining golden bodies of its supporting
uraeii, its cobras of Egypt, were lost in the dusk of her hair,
whose soft fineness yet lived and would live so much longer than
the flesh of any of us three.</p>

<p>Yes, I had kept my word and given to Beatrice all that had
been Ta-Nezem's, even to the sarcophagus itself, for in my will
it was written that she be placed in it for final burial.</p>

<p>Like the fool he was, Quentin stood there, staring at the
unclosed, frozen eyes of my Beatrice&mdash;and his. Stood till
that which had been in the wine began to make itself felt. He
faced me then, but with so absurd and childish a look of surprise
that, despite the courtesy due a guest, I laughed and
laughed.</p>

<p>I, too, felt warning throes, but to me the pain was no more
than a gage&mdash;a measure of his sufferings stimulus to point
the phrases in which I told him all I knew and had guessed of him
and Beatrice, and thus drive home the jest.</p>

<p>But I had never thought that a man of Quentin's youth and
strength could die so easily. Beatrice, frail though she was, had
taken longer to die.</p>

<p>He could not even cross the room to stop my laughter, but at
the first step stumbled, fell, and in a very little while lay at
the foot of the gilded case.</p>

<p>After all, he was not so strong as I. Beatrice had seen. Her
still, cold eyes saw all. How he lay there, his fine, lithe body
contorted, worthless for any use till its substance should have
been cast again in the melting-pot of dissolution, while I who
had drunk of the same draft, suffered the same pangs, yet stood
and found breath for mockery.</p>

<p>So I poured myself another glass of that good Cordovan wine,
and I raised it to both of them and drained it, laughing.</p>

<p>"Quentin," I cried, "you asked what door, though your thought
was that you had passed that way before, and feared that I
guessed your, knowledge. But there are doors and doors, dear,
charming friend, and one that is heavier than any other. Close it
if you can. Close it now in my face, who otherwise will follow
even whither you have gone&mdash;the heavy, heavy door of the
Osiris, Keeper of the House of Death!"</p>

<p>Thus I dreamed of doing and speaking. It was so vivid, the
dream, that awakening in the darkness of my room I could scarcely
believe that it had been other than reality. True, I lived, while
in my dream I had shared the avenging poison. Yet my veins were
still hot with the keen passion of triumph, and my eyes filled
with the vision of Beatrice, dead&mdash;dead in Ta-Nezem's
casket.</p>

<p>Unreasonably frightened. I sprang from bed, flung on a
dressing-gown, and hurried out. Down the hallway I sped, swiftly
and silently, at the end of it unlocked heavy doors with a
tremulous hand, switched on lights, lights and more lights, till
the great room of my collection was ablaze with them, and as my
treasures sprang into view I sighed, like a man reaching home
from a perilous journey.</p>

<p>The dream was a lie.</p>

<p>There, fronting me, stood the heavy empty sarcophagus; there
on the trestles before it lay the gilded case, a thing of
beautiful, gleaming lines, like the smiling image of a golden
woman.</p>

<p>I stole across the room and softly, very softly, lifted the
upper half of the beautiful lid, peering within. The dream indeed
was a lie.</p>

<p>Happy as a comforted child I went to my room again. Across the
hall the door of my wife's boudoir stood partly open.</p>

<p>In the room beyond a faint light was burning, and I could see
the rose-colored curtain sway slightly to a draft from some open
window.</p>

<p>Yesterday she had come to me and asked for her freedom. I had
refused, knowing to whom she would turn, and hating him for his
youth, and his crudeness and his secret scorn of me.</p>

<p>But had I done well? They were children, those two, and
despite my dream I was certain that their foolish, youthful
ideals had kept them from actual sin against my honor. But what
if, time passing, they might change? Or, Quentin gone, my lovely
Beatrice might favor another, young as he and not so
scrupulous?</p>

<p>Every one, they say, has a streak of incipient madness. I
recalled the frenzied act to which my dream jealousy had driven
me. Perhaps it was a warning, the dream. What if my father's
jealous blood should some day betray me, drive me to the insane
destruction of her I held most dear and sacred.</p>

<p>I shuddered, then smiled at the swaying curtain. Beatrice was
too beautiful for safety. She should have her freedom.</p>

<p>Let her mate with Ralph Quentin or whom she would, Ta-Nezem
must rest secure in her gilded house of death. My brown, perfect,
shriveled Princess of the Nile! Destroyed&mdash;rent to brown,
aromatic shreds&mdash;burned&mdash;destroyed&mdash;and her
beautiful coffin-case desecrated as I had seen it in my
vision'.</p>

<p>Again I shuddered, smiled and shook my head sadly at the
swaying, rosy curtain.</p>

<p>"You are too lovely, Beatrice," I said, "and my father was a
Spaniard. You shall have your freedom!"</p>

<p>I entered my room and lay down to sleep again, at peace and
content.</p>

<p>The dream, thank God, was a lie.</p>
