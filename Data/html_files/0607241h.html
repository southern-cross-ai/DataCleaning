<h1>The Romance of a Station</h1>

<p>Prefatory Note.</p>

<p>"THE Romance of a Station" begins on the solid earth of experience,
and wanders across the border-line into the misty cloud-region of Fancy
and Fiction.</p>

<p>The opening chapters picture faithfully enough the scene of one of
my own early homes, and describe life on an island which may be found
marked on any map of Australia. Almost all the incidents are real, and
even the most romantic of the episodes have their foundation in
fact.</p>

<p>R. M. PRAED.</p>

<h3>Chapter I. Across the Narrows.</h3>

<p>"THERE'S a fire at the South End, Mrs. Ansdell. Your husband is
signalling for Rame's boat. You'll see him this evening."</p>

<p>I ran out to the verandah of the Police Magistrate's house. Yes,
there was the beacon light shining like a big red star, low down in the
heavens, far off across Gundabine Bay. I heard one of the pilots
shouting at the verandah of the wooden public-house opposite:</p>

<p>"Rame, I say! Hurry up with your nobbler. There's Ansdell on the
Island signalling to be brought over." Then I saw Rame slouch out of
the bar, wiping his mouth on the sleeve of his Crimean shirt, and trot
down to the wharf; and I knew that in two or three hours' time my
husband would be with me, and I was glad, for I was a bride, and this
had been our first week of separation.</p>

<p>"I shall go back with my husband to-morrow," I declared
resolutely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis, the Police Magistrate's wife, shook her head
remonstrantly.</p>

<p>"It will be much wiser to wait a little longer. The house isn't
ready for you: I fancy the carpenters are at work still."</p>

<p>"I'll help the carpenters," I replied.</p>

<p>"There are no servants, and you aren't used to roughing it in the
bush."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am. Why, I have lived all my life in the bush, and I
love it. If you had ever seen dear old Bungroopim, Mrs. Jarvis, you
wouldn't wonder that I am glad to have married a squatter instead of a
townsman."</p>

<p>We both laughed, for we both knew that that wouldn't have made any
difference; and Captain Jarvis put in--</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I know what your 'bush' was like--cool verandahs covered
with roses and Cape jasmine and grape-vines, mountains in the distance,
good buggy roads, and plenty of neighbours--lots of girls and young
men, and races and picnics, and good times all round. That was
kid-glove roughing it, Mrs. Ansdell, and you'll find life on the Island
a different sort of thing."</p>

<p>"The roses and the Cape jasmine will cover the verandah in time," I
answered; "and as for the girls and the young men and the good times, I
don't care about all that now."</p>

<p>"But the mosquitoes, Mrs. Ansdell?" said his wife. "You can't
imagine how bad they are on the Island at this time of the year. Don't
you think it would be wiser to wait till the plague has lessened?"</p>

<p>"The mosquitoes could not be worse than they are here," I returned;
for as we sat in the verandah the air was full of the buzzing of
insects, and we flourished whisks of horsehair while we talked.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb your calm resignation," said Captain Jarvis,
"but I am afraid they will if I do not. The Island mosquito is a
peculiarly ferocious beast. Let me give you a bit of advice, Mrs.
Ansdell. Buy up all the gauze netting and all the Persian insect-powder
in Gundabine before you go over. It's a fact that Lambert and his hands
always went out mustering with their heads in bags."</p>

<p>Lambert was the former owner of the Island, from whom my husband had
a few months before bought the station and the cattle which ran upon
it.</p>

<p>In spite of Captain Jarvis's warnings, and Mrs. Jarvis's gentle
dissuasion--in spite also of a certain sinister suggestiveness in the
compassionate interest which was shown in me by every inhabitant of
Gundabine, from the postmistress to the storekeeper's assistant, my
resolution, fixed some days before, had not wavered. I was determined
to brave all discomfort--to brave even my husband's opposition, and to
insist upon returning with him.</p>

<p>I had been married only a month. I was longing to start on my new
life, and to settle into my new home, the blue shores of which were
tantalisingly visible across the bay; and here I was, imprisoned in
this dreary coast township in sight of the Promised Land, and forbidden
to pass the strip of water that separated me from it. I liked the idea
of living on an island. This stretch of country, forty miles long by
fourteen broad, was to be our kingdom--my husband's and mine. There was
no one to dispute possession except a little colony of pilots who lived
at the lighthouse and telegraph station quite at the north end, and
with whom I determined to make friends--they had already sent me
wedding presents of coral and mother-of-pearl from the nautilus
shell.</p>

<p>The undulating outlines of our Island gave promise of picturesque
scenery. It was all interesting and romantic. There was something
fascinating in the thought that only at full or new moon, when the tide
was lowest, could man or beast swim across the Narrows to the mainland.
I liked the idea of being separated from the world by that long,
lonely, man-grove-fringed strait which, no broader than a river at its
neck, widened out some twenty miles lower into the beautiful Gundabine
harbour that had filled me with admiration as we had entered it in the
coasting steamer. In calm weather the bay was blue and smiling; but
when a south-east gale blew, and the waves dashed on the little islets
that stood like a row of sentinels between the great island and the
mainland, and the sea-horses chased each other, it was no pleasant
passage to make on a dark night in Rame's skiff or the Island boat. But
I did not let myself foresee possible storms and terrors, and I would
not dwell upon practical difficulties and inconveniencies such as the
carriage of household goods and stores, and having to send to Gundabine
for our mail. Neither Alec nor I had realized these as yet.</p>

<p>I broached my daring project to Alec that night, but it was a long
time before I could win his consent. The mosquitoes were awful, he
said; then the carpenters had only just finished their work; and there
was no one to clean the place except the stockman's wife, whom Alec
described as "an ill-tempered shrew." Nothing was ready for me. The
place had a bad name, and all Alec's efforts to get a servant in
Gundabine had been unavailing. We must wait for the next emigrant ship,
and then he would go to Stonehampton and bring back a tidy girl. In the
meantime I had better stay where I was. He did not think I should ever
like the Island. He had not dreamed that mosquitoes could be so bad; he
had bought the station in the winter--had he inspected it in the summer
he would have known that it was not a fit place for a lady to live in.
He was anxious and disheartened, in short; and this made me only the
more determined to go at once and share the discomforts of which I
thought but lightly. He gave in when he saw I was resolute, but it was
not till the last moment, and not till I had drawn a doleful picture of
my suffering and loneliness at Gundabine. It could only be a question
of number and degree between mosquitoes and sandflies here and
mosquitoes and sandflies there. I had two hands, I urged, and no
discomfort could be more unendurable than the stuffy squalor of Sykes's
hotel, with the noise of the bar always going on beneath my room.</p>

<p>We were sitting in the balcony of this, the only decent inn in
Gundabine, and overlooked the one long straggling street of the
township. Opposite was the square-verandahed red-brick building where
the Police Magistrate lived, and which contained all the Government
Offices. A little lower stood a large weather-boarded shanty placarded
in big letters, "A. Bell &amp; Sons, Agents for the A. S. N. Co.,"
which twice a week was the scene of brief activity when the passenger
steamboats put in from north and south. A wooden pier extended some
fifty yards into the muddy inlet upon which Gundabine was built. Here a
pair of Chinamen were gesticulating over the unpacking of a boatload of
vegetables, and three or four half-naked gins, with their piccaninnies
slung on their tattooed backs, whined piteous entreaties for tobacco to
an angler perched on one of the log bulwarks of the pier. Further back
lay a mud flat fringed with mangroves, and inland upon the crest of a
rise stood a public-house, a wooden chapel, and a general store,
outside which a variety of heterogeneous wares lay exposed, from a
side-saddle to a sausage machine. There was an air of utter stagnation
about the place, and it was quite a relief to the monotony when a
bushman in his Crimean shirt and cabbage-tree hat, with the pannikin
rattling at his saddle-bow, and his valise strapped before him,
cantered down the road and dismounted at Sykes's, exchanging a greeting
with Captain Jarvis as he passed: "Who's down? Come over and have a
nip"--the common salutation in Gundabine; and I used sometimes to
wonder how many "nips" it was possible for a Gundabinian to swallow in
the twenty-four hours without getting seriously drunk.</p>

<p>Sykes's itself was a wooden two-storeyed building with verandahs
above and below, the lower one screened from the road by several
flowering oleanders, and the bar opening upon it, while its edge formed
a convenient lounge for the tipplers who frequented it. Two or three
gaunt Papaw apple-trees, with their tall bare stems, feathery tips, and
clusters of yellow fruit growing out from beneath the leafy crown,
overshadowed our balcony and gave a sort of Oriental look to the place;
a creeping passion-fruit twined round the wooden pilasters; already,
though it was hardly dusk, the hum of millions of insects had begun.
The air was hot and clammy, with that curious sense of teeming life
which a tropical evening brings. But for the light breeze which swept
up from the sea it would have been unbearably oppressive. Our boat lay
at anchor beside the pier, and just then a short, squat man--he whom I
had watched the previous night, with his flannel shirt open at the
breast, and a bowie knife stuck at his belt, staggered out of the bar,
though he had kept his senses sufficiently to touch his hat to us in
the balcony.</p>

<p>"Rame is half seas over already," said Alec. "We must be off
to-night. He will be too far gone to manage the boat to-morrow."</p>

<p>Rame, otherwise a fairly useful member of Gundabine society--for he
was always ready for an odd job--shared the local weakness for a "nip,"
only he called it a "nobbler."</p>

<p>"How is the wind, Rame?" shouted Alec.</p>

<p>"S.S.E., and be damned to it," replied Rame.</p>

<p>"You idiot!" returned Alec. "Can't you answer a civil question
without swearing? Go and sober yourself, and bail out the boat. The
tide serves at midnight; and, mind you, if I find a dram in the locker,
overboard it goes."</p>

<p>Rame lurched along to the pier, and Alec went out to satisfy himself
as to the condition of the two black boys.</p>

<p>We embarked a little after midnight. It was still very warm, and
perfectly clear, and the steady breeze from the south did not deserve
Rame's anathema, for it was bearing us swiftly towards our destination.
A bright moon shone in the cloudless heavens, which were of that deep
unfathomable blue that suggests infinity. There were myriads of
stars--"God's candles," as we children used to call them--all the
glittering Southern constellations, the Cross and its pointers high
above us, and Aldebaran and Orion and the flaming tail of the
Scorpion.</p>

<p>Alec steered, and Rame and the two black boys managed the sails. The
currents were dangerous here and there, and we were obliged to tack
often. I sat at the stern wrapped in my cloak, with my face bared to
the wind, and my pulses stirred by the beauty of the night and the
loneliness and immensity of the scene. All was silent; even the men
seemed awed, and I did not hear Rame swear once during the trip. We
soon got away from the noises of the shore and the humming of insects,
and there was no sound except that which the waves made against the bow
of the boat as she glided through the phosphorescent water. As we got
out into the Bay, however, we could hear the roar of the ocean beyond,
and Rame remarked that it was "blowing pretty stiff out there." The
islets seemed to sleep peacefully in the moonlight, all but one, from
which curled up the smoke of a watch fire. The lights of Gundabine
faded gradually as we sailed up the now narrowing strait. On our right
the undulating contour of the Island; on our left the low bank of
mangroves which marked the line of mainland. The tide was low, and the
snake-like withes of the mangrove roots looked uncanny in the
moonlight. Occasionally we passed a white beacon, which rose up like a
grotesque ghost, its long arms casting flickering shadows on the water,
or a red buoy wabbling above a sunken reef. Now we rounded a rocky
point where stood a deserted cluster of Chinamen's huts, the remains of
a b&ecirc;che-de-mer fishing station; now we tacked across the Narrows
to a little sandy bay which the waves lapped with a monotonous
swash.</p>

<p>The passage of seventeen miles occupied us about four hours. The
dawn broke, and a grey tender light crept softly over sea and land;
then it flushed to delicate pink, and the sun rose round and red behind
the straggling gum-trees on the Island. We had entered a tiny inlet
bordered on each side with mangroves, of which the waxen green branches
were level with the rising water. Rame unshipped the oars and rowed us
to a pier of slabs built out into the creek, on one side of which was a
rude boat-house made of saplings laid transversely. Alec let go the
tiller and sprang on shore.</p>

<h3>Chapter II. My Kingdom.</h3>

<p>ALEC held out his hands to me, and I stepped with a feeling of
elation on to my new territory. Here, I am bound to confess, it
disappointed me. The shore was barren-looking and stony, and the grass
rank and withered. Lanky unhealthy gum-trees, with whiteybrown bark
peeling off like scales, as if they were afflicted with some nasty
disease, reared their lean heads above stunted wattles and spiked
dried-up grass trees. As I looked inland I could see nothing but vistas
of these melancholy white gums--a genuine red ironbark dropping
stalactites of gum would have been a refreshment to the eyes. Presently
I became aware that the air was alive with mosquitoes--grey,
long-legged, ferocious monsters of the breed which infests the
sea-shore. No, Captain Jarvis had not exaggerated their voracity! They
offered a palpable resistance to one's hand, and their noise was as the
roar of distant machinery, while at the same time I was conscious of
severe prickings in every part of my body that was not guarded by
double and treble layers of clothing. Alec watched me with anxiety.</p>

<p>"There, I told you," he said. "I ought not to have let you come. But
they are not as bad as this at the house, and they are always worst in
the early morning."</p>

<p>"Where is the house, Alec?" I said. "Let us go there at once."</p>

<p>"It is five miles off," he replied; "and the mosquitoes would eat
you alive going through the swamp. Here, Charlie," he called to one of
the black boys, "yan along a head station; murra, make haste.* Tell
Tillidge to put Smiler in the cart and come for missus. You won't mind
the cart," he added; "the new buggy isn't put together yet."</p>

<p>Charlie ran off as fast as his legs would carry him. Rame calmly lit
his pipe and began to bail out the boat. Island Billy, the other black
boy, took his tomahawk and cut off slabs from a neighbouring grasstree,
while Alec collected twigs and sticks. Together they made a fire, Billy
remarking compassionately to me: "Mine think it, missus, make em corbon
big fellow smoke. That make mosquito plenty sleep."</p>

<p>I felt grateful to Billy. If the smoke did not make the mosquitoes
"plenty sleep," it kept them away a little. I sat down on a stone
beside the fire, tucked my feet under my gown, and with watering eyes
bent my head forward, while with a wisp of blady grass I switched at
the mosquitoes behind. Meanwhile Rame joined the group, smoking like a
philosopher; and Alec and the black boy lit their pipes too, and kept
up a desultory conversation in blacks' vernacular about a certain
"poley" cow which was missing from one of the camps. By-and-by there
was a crack of a stockwhip behind us, and Tillidge, the stockman,
appeared on horseback, the black boy behind him driving a rough dray on
two huge wheels, with iron chains and girders, and a board placed
crosswise doing duty for a seat. Tillidge was the stockman, and a
head-stockman never, if he can avoid it, drives or walks.</p>

<p>Tillidge was the typical Australian stockman--long, loosely-made,
lean and disjointed-looking, sitting his horse magnificently as far as
the saddle, but with his legs dangling anyhow in his stirrups, and a
shortnecked spur on one foot. His face was red and burntup in
appearance--a queer jumble of features, none of which seemed to belong
to the other, and with an expression as stolid as that of a dummy. He
was dressed in tight moleskin trousers turned up at the ends, and
elastic-sided boots--a stockman always turns up his trousers at the
ends; and he doesn't, as a rule, and unless he is inclined to be
"flash," wear breeches and gaiters. These he leaves to his master. He
wore a grey flannel shirt, the sleeves rolled up to the elbow, a silk
handkerchief tied diagonally across his chest, a cabbage-tree hat
ornamented with a strap round the crown, and a bit of greasy string,
held by his front teeth, keeping the hat in a tilted position on the
back of his head. He had a broader strap round his waist, to which was
slung a small leather watch--pocket and a large pouch containing his
clasp-knife, tobacco, a bit of old silk for crackers, and such-like
etcaeteras. His stockwhip was coiled round like a snake, and hung on
his left shoulder, with the handle dangling in front. He jogged along
in an unconcerned way, his pipe in his mouth, till he got close to us;
then he pulled up, nodding to Alec's "Good-day, Tillidge," and replying
in a short, morose manner, running his words one into the other, as a
bushman does, "G'd-day, sir."</p>

<p>Alec had already explained to me that Tillidge's wife--our only
woman-servant on the Island at present--was a shrew. Tillidge bore her
ratings in philosophical silence; and the habit had so grown upon him
that he rarely opened his lips, except when it was actually necessary.
But he was an admirable stockman, and, to use an Australian expression,
could "put his legs over the worst buck-jumper that ever was foaled."
His knowledge of the run was so valuable just now, while a mob of store
cattle was being collected, that Alec begged me as a favour to
interfere with the sweet will of Mrs. Tillidge as little as possible,
and to put up with her bad temper, lest she should insist upon her
husband throwing up his place at a day's notice. As I had come over on
my own responsibility and in face of Alec's disapproval, I was quite
prepared to be meek and submissive in my behaviour to the
Tillidges.</p>

<p>"All been going on well at the station, Tillidge?" Alec asked.</p>

<p>"Four heifers square-tailed yesterday, sir; and the strawberry cow's
calf died last night," replied Tillidge, and relapsed into
monosyllables, till Alec said cheerfully, "You see, I have brought Mrs.
Ansdell over, Tillidge. I hope your wife will be equal to the extra
cooking and all that," when the stockman maintained a silence which I
felt to be ominous.</p>

<p>Our portmanteaus were put into the back of the dray; Tillidge rode
on ahead. Rame and the black boys set off walking by a short cut across
the bush. Alec helped me up to the board and then mounted himself, and
shook the whip over Smiler's back, thus dispersing a cloud of
mosquitoes which the poor animal had been vainly trying to whisk off
with its tail. As a parting attention, Island Billy had handed me a
branch of wattle, and while we jogged along in the springless vehicle
over stones and stumps and fallen logs, the iron chains and staples
clattering as we went, I waved the wattle-branch among the mosquitoes
at my back with one hand, while with the other I held tight to the
girders to prevent myself from being shaken out. But when we came to a
hill, the wattle-branch had to be thrown away, and I bent backwards to
clutch the portmanteaus, which were in danger of slipping between the
girders on to the road; and then the mosquitoes settled in a dense
black swarm about our heads, and but for something comic about the
whole situation, and for Alec's distress, I could have cried with
fatigue and irritation.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens now, and brooded with a moist,
clammy heat. There was no sea-breeze among the thick gum-trees, and the
she-oaks in the swampy ground were strangely still. I used to like the
faint quivering sound which the she-oaks on the Ubi made, and it would
have been home-like to hear it now. The birds had wakened, and there
were little inarticulate twitterings in the boughs overhead, and the
parrots called shrilly to each other, but I missed the crack of the
whip-bird, and the soft cooing note of the Wonga-Wonga pigeon, and the
sweet familiar chirp of my old friend the willy-wagtail. Suddenly I was
startled by a demoniacal "Ha-ha-ha," caught up and echoed by a chorus
of invisible imps. They were only laughing jackasses, and I had heard
their harsh merriment often enough, but it sounded drear and uncanny on
this bridal home-coming.</p>

<p>By-and-by we reached a sliprail and entered the station paddock,
where the milkers were browsing peacefully, and the horses whinnied as
we drove by. They looked lean and harassed, poor things; and I did not
wonder at it, if they had to pass their days and nights in waging war
with their tails against the mosquitoes. One or two of them were cobs,
and had no tails; and I raged then and afterwards against the
inhumanity of former owners, who had deprived these poor beasts of
their only weapon of defence.</p>

<p>We could see the house high above us, on a steep hill too
precipitous to be ascended at this point any way but on foot. Deep
gullies furrowed the hill, and it was covered with thick tussocks of
long-bladed grass and gum saplings, with here and there a big ironbark
gum. There was a cleared space on the top, where the house was built.
It was bare except for the grey gaunt skeletons of some dozen or so of
white gums which had been "rung," and had bleached and withered. Alas,
for my visions of the pretty cottage with its verandah and garden and
its creeping roses and bouganvillea! The sun beat pitilessly upon a
commonplace, new-looking wooden building, with a verandah, it is true,
but a verandah unsheltered by trellis or drooping eaves. The house
stood upon log piles, through which daylight shone conspicuously, and
which were high enough almost for a grown-up person to stand upright
beneath them; and, as I prophetically foresaw, to give shelter to a
flock of goats that bleated by the stockyard fence. I could make out no
garden, no greenery of any kind--all was bleak, glaring and desolate,
beyond description.</p>

<p>We drove round by a waterhole pleasant to look upon, with the
she--oaks round it, and the blue and yellow lilies on its surface. The
stockyard lay close by at the foot of the hill. Alec was proud of the
stockyard, and pointed out to me the height and impregnability of the
great grey corner posts and rails, and the superior construction of the
"crush," or branding lane, and the bailing-up pen. I was quite
bushwoman enough to appreciate these advantages, and rejoiced
accordingly; but my eye wandered to a wilderness of a garden beside the
milking-yard, where two or three tall papaw apples towered above a mass
of promiscuous vegetation; and I sighed when I saw that the greenstuff
was mostly fat--hen--though I consoled myself a moment later by
remembering that on the Ubi I had seen the free selectors use the
fat-hen for spinach, and that we should not, therefore, die of scurvy;
but I could not help exclaiming, at the discovery that there seemed
nothing else eatable. "Oh, Alec, I thought pumpkins grew everywhere!"
and Alec answered remorsefully, "Well, you see, Rachel, they don't grow
wild; and I suppose when we were busy taking delivery of the cattle
nobody thought of planting them. But never mind; as soon as I have
cleared off this mob of store cattle, I'll set all hands to work, and
we'll grow vegetables as fast as a Chinaman."</p>

<p>Alec was collecting a mob of bullocks for which a purchaser had
offered, and a sale of which was absolutely necessary to pay off the
mortgage on the station, and free us from the bank that had advanced us
money for our start in life. We both had a horror of debt, and a dread
of being sold up, like many an Australian station-buyer, who can only
pay down a third of his purchase money, and who, in bad times of
drought or pleura-pneumonia, is obliged to hand over his home to the
obliging bank which has backed him. We weren't afraid of drought on the
Island, and from our isolated position we had little cause to dread
pleuro-pneumonia, and our debt was not a very large one; still, we
wanted "to start fair." So Alec and I were of one mind about leaving
everything else to take care of itself till the store cattle had been
safely crossed over the Narrows; and I quite agreed with him that it
would be advisable to make any sacrifice of pride to keep Tillidge, who
knew every nook and corner of the Island, and would bring cattle into
the mustering-yard whose existence we could not have suspected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tillidge did not belie her reputation. She looked a shrew; and
as she came out into the yard when the dray drove up, and gave me a
surly sort of greeting, I quite decided that I had better make no
attempt to assert my authority as mistress of the place, for I saw that
it would certainly be disputed. I did not feel disposed to resent her
want of cordiality then. I was so hot, so tired, so cramped by my
uncomfortable drive, so glad to have reached "home," so glad to be no
longer enveloped in that buzzing, pricking cloud. It felt fresh and
comparatively cool up here on the brow of the hill. The wind blew
straight up from the ocean; and I began to understand why the late
proprietor of the Island had perched his dwelling-place so high, and
why green things wouldn't grow, and why the dead trees and even the
grass tussocks curved in one particular direction.</p>

<p>The yard, into which we had driven, was enclosed on one side by the
house, on the opposite one by the kitchen, and some rude slab buildings
in line with it--the meat-store, and carpenter's shop, and such-like;
and on the other two by a rough fence of perpendicular palings. There
was a covered pathway across the yard, connecting the house and
kitchen. A pair of ancient gins with skinny arms and hideous wealed
faces sat there smoking short clay pipes. They were clad in red
blankets slung over one shoulder and under the other. Several naked
piccaninnies sprawled at their feet, uttering funny inarticulate
sounds, and playing with the dogs, of which a tribe lay round--kangaroo
hounds, mongrels from the camp, and some of a nobler breed, who kept a
little apart on the sunny boards, as if they resented the proximity of
the blacks. A flight of log steps led to the causeway; and out of the
crevices lizards nimbly darted, their bright eyes and copper scales
glittering in the sunlight. Two corrugated zinc tanks, one at each end
of the front building, caught the sun also, and seemed to radiate heat.
A low waterbutt close by one of them was evidently used for the washing
of horses' backs when they came in hot from the run, to judge by the
hoof-marks on the damp gravel, the dinted quart-pots, and the saddles
and bridles and straps hurled promiscuously on the verandah, at one end
of which the tub stood. On the low verandah--roof of one of the
outbuildings two or three bullock-skins were stretched out, and hung
conveniently over the eaves, so that a strip of green-hide could always
be cut when wanted, and the spiked palings of the fence supported junks
of salted beef set forth to dry. A little covey of hawks swooped and
swirled in the air above, but did not dare to pounce down upon prey so
well guarded; for whenever the carrion birds came a little nearer, the
gins removed their pipes and began a loud crooning yell, "Wirra-wurra!"
winding up with a fierce discordant "Wa-ah!" and I now understood why
they sat there, and how they earned their tobacco.</p>

<p>All these little things imprinted themselves on my mind in a
curious, vivid way. I suppose this is because it was my first home, and
I was very young then and a bride. Girlhood is like a voyage on some
soft hazy sea, where there are beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and
balmy breezes which waft one onward, and storms too that never bring
shipwreck, and islets where one may linger and dream of the Land of
Possibilities at the end.</p>

<p>And then the land is reached, the possibilities become living
experience, and there is a glamour over the first sights and sounds
that greet one in that land which never grows dim or is forgotten. I
can see the whole scene as distinctly now as though it were before me
in actual reality--the untidy yard, and the blear-eyed gins, and the
swart, shiny piccaninnies tumbling off the causeway, and the dogs
lazily lifting their heads to bark in a perfunctory fashion. Beaufort
the big stately buckhound, who, though he was selfish and indolent, and
too much of a fine gentleman to be of any use, was a credit to the
establishment, and too well-bred to do a mean action; then the
goggle-eyed bull-pup, who was so hideous that it was a distinction to
be his owner, though he was a dog whose education had been neglected,
and who never acquired the manners of good society; and there was Rose,
the pointer, who put me in mind somehow of Mrs. Micawber--she was
always surrounded by a brood of puppies, either in the infantine or the
gambolling stage; and she had a worn, draggled appearance, and a pair
of melancholy brown eyes, and at the same time an air of gentle,
ladylike protest, as if to say that hard circumstances had placed her
in a position of life for which by birth she was not fitted, but that
she meant to do her duty all the same. Poor Rose! she had a way of
beating a tattoo on the floor with her tail, and looking at one with
her sympathetic bleared eyes; and that was the mode in which her
emotions expressed themselves. When I was without servants, and had to
cook the salt junk and make bread for the men, and wash up the plates
and dishes in the kitchen, Rose, in the intervals of licking her
puppies, would thus dumbly show her appreciation of the state of
affairs, and I am sure that she wished to convey a sense of similarity
between my position and her own.</p>

<p>Then Alec called out, "Monte! Christo!" and there bounced from the
house a big black retriever, which jumped on to his master, and an
Angora goat, with matted fleece that touched the ground, and a funny
little knowing head and tiny horns like those of a child's toy lamb.
Monte was a retriever which Alec had got out from England at a great
expense, with a view to duck shooting on the Island, but who could
never be brought to adjust his instincts to sport in Australia, and who
was otherwise a bad dog, addicted to lying on the beds and to
misbehaving himself generally. As for Christo, Alec had imported him
also, with the idea of starting an Angora goat farm, and selling the
hair for the manufacture of shawls at a fabulous price; but it fell
through somehow, and by-and-by Christo became an inconvenient pet, for
he took up his quarters in the pantry by day, and made his couch in the
bath by night, and he had to be banished at last Perhaps I had better
mention here that the bath-room, which sounds an unwonted luxury for
the bush, was a bit of the back verandah next the tank partitioned off,
and in which a zinc--lined bath had been built. There was always a
bucket near the tank, so that we could fill the bath for ourselves; and
its great advantage was that it had a hole in the bottom stopped up
with a wooden bung, and that the water could be let off through the
floor, and would meander under the house among the log piles and down
the hill into one of the gullies--you had only to look through one of
the wide cracks in the boards to see its course. Nevertheless, the
bath-room had a great deal to do with the sale of the station, and had
caught more than one intending purchaser. It was noticeable that the
Island often changed hands, and that such transfers usually took place
in the winter, when the mosquito larvae had their existence hidden in
the grass tussocks and under the leaves of the lilies in the
water-hole. There was as yet no record of a deed of purchase having
been signed between the months of November and April, when the
mosquitoes were in full force.</p>

<p>Alec had certainly been right when he described the house as dirty.
It was very dirty. I don't think the bare wooden floors had been washed
for months; and the carpenters had left plentiful debris, both in the
rooms and the verandah. On the whole, however, it was rather a
pretentious sort of house for the bush. It was built of sawn wood, and
lined with well--planed boards; it was shingled, and it had not only a
bath-room, but a pantry as well. There were three good-sized rooms in a
line looking on to the verandah, which went round three sides, and was
a long way from the ground and fenced with a light railing; then there
were four smaller ones behind; and there was a tiny excrescence built
out into the yard, called the office. It was in the office that all
important interviews were held, agreements signed, brands entered, and
the mustering roll of cattle made. There was a fireproof safe in which
the station ledgers were kept, and a copying press, though to the best
of my knowledge it was never once used; and the great Island seal, and
the firearms and ammunition, and the big map of the station and the
library, consisting of a dozen or so yellow--backed novels, "Spooner on
Sheep," and "The Diseases of Cattle," "The Art of Horse-breaking," and
"The Family Physician." Here also the medicine-chest was kept, and the
supply of diachylon plaster, and in "pleuro time" the virus for
inoculation. It would have been a cosy room if it had not been so
dirty, and if the rafters had not been infested by bloated tarantulas,
and an uncanny species of lizard of a sickly spotted white, which had
the curious habit of unfastening its tail when pursued, and of making
off on its stump. These lizards inspired me with a superstitious
terror. I have never solved the mystery of that movable tail--whether
the reptile came back in the dead of night and recovered its property,
or whether it had the power of growing a new tail whenever it
pleased.</p>

<p>On the office side, which was the most sheltered, there was a wee
enclosed patch--an abortive attempt at a flower garden. It was
overgrown with rank grass, and there was an aloe in the middle, and one
stunted poinsettia shrub, which threw out a branch or two of crimson
leaves when winter came on. I had high hopes of this bit of garden, and
planted verbenas, and Indian shot, and other hardy plants; but nothing
would ever grow in the dreary, sun-scorched, stony plat. All round
about the other end of the house was perfectly bare and wind-swept. The
easterly side of the verandah was the only spot where on summer
evenings there was a chance of being free from mosquitoes; and for that
reason I chose for ourselves the bedroom and dressing-room which looked
upon it. No hill rose between this exposed plateau and the open ocean
seven miles distant. The south-east gales raged furiously round it,
making the skeleton gum-trees quake and shiver bursting open the French
windows, and sometimes blowing down the canvas ceiling. On such nights,
above the wind, we could distinctly hear the roar of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The view from the verandah was extensive and pleasant to look upon.
There was nothing to break it except the tall gum-trees which grew on
the hump of the hill behind. In every other direction we looked out
upon grey-green undulating slopes. We could not see the ocean or the
Narrows, but across the strait on the mainland a blue-peaked mountain
cut the horizon line. The mountain was called Mount Akobaora, which is
the native name for the laughing jackass.</p>

<p>This was my home. Within, it was crude and rough; but that could be
remedied. Captain Jarvis had promised to bring over our furniture in
the pilot schooner, which would carry it all at once. The Island boat
had gone on a special trip for the piano. The instrument stood
forlornly in the bachelor parlour, its silk facings and crewel-worked
back sadly out of keeping with walls painted the crudest and most
offensive blue, and with the coloured prints from the Illustrated News
which adorned them. Grosvenor Gallery art canons did not prevail in the
Australian wilds. I felt very despondent at the sight of those walls,
and the cheap mahogany chiffonier and horsehair covered sofa and
armchair. Mrs. Tillidge came sulkily in and laid the table for lunch
while I was pondering the possibility of softening down that terrible
aniline blue. The sun poured through the uncurtained windows, and I
discovered to my horror that I was doomed to a western aspect. Mrs.
Tillidge placed a piece of dry salt beef on the table, and flanked it
with an equally impenetrable-looking three-cornered junk of
bread--evidently the section of a camp-oven loaf--and a tin teapot and
three iron cups. I wondered who was going to use the third cup.
Presently Alec came in, followed by a short, weather--beaten, bearded
man, whom he introduced as Mr. Kempsey, the second pilot at the North
End. There wasn't much to be seen of Mr. Kempsey's features, he was so
covered with shaggy hair; but his eyes gleamed benevolently, and I took
a fancy to him at once. He was very shy at meeting a lady, but when he
saw our meagre fare and our untidy condition, and glanced up at the
white canvas ceiling, which was speckled with mosquitoes waiting for
dusk to come down and settle on their victims, his compassion got the
better of his shyness.</p>

<p>"You'll have to fetch in a good load of grass-tree, Mr. Ansdell,"
said he. "Lambert kept it burning day and night, all along the
verandah." Then he produced a dilly-bag carefully lined with
newspapers, and emptied from it a dozen rosy-cheeked apples. "Polly--my
girl--sent these," he went on. "If she'd ha' known that you were over,
Mrs. Ansdell--and her mother would have worked the telegraph for a day
or two--she'd ha' come over to help you put things straight." Polly, I
learned, was Mr. Kempsey's daughter, who was also telegraph-mistress at
the Pilot Station. When we had admired the apples, Mr. Kempsey took
from the capacious pocket of his blue blouse a pot of strawberry jam,
explaining that when a Tasmanian brig came by he always did a bit of
smuggling, for it didn't harm any one, and they'd be badly off at the
Pilot Station if it wasn't for these bits of relishes. "I didn't
suppose your store was rigged up yet," he said; "and anyway you
wouldn't have thought of fetching apples from Gundabine, Mr. Ansdell,"
and then he regretted that he hadn't known that I was "along from
Gundabine" too, for the missus had been saving some pots of apricot jam
to send me; and if "I'd ha' thought, now," he added, looking at the
uninviting piece of beef, "those Tasmanian walnuts that Polly puts in
pickle--they are a relish you couldn't get in Gundabine--and there was
a whole sack of fresh onions." But he brightened up, and exclaimed, as
Alec came in with a bottle of grog he had just opened, "It'll be of no
consequence, though, Mr. Ansdell, for there's the horse you'll be
sending for your brother; and Billy can put the onions in his
pack."</p>

<p>Alec's brother, who was a lieutenent on board H.M.S. Alecto, just
arrived on the Sydney Naval Station! I wondered what Mr. Kempsey meant.
Alec gave me a comical look, and laid a blue telegraph paper beside my
plate. The salt beef choked me as I read--</p>

<p>"From LOFTUS ANSDELL, H.M.S. Alecto, Sydney.</p>

<p>"To ALEC ANSDELL, Pilot Station, Moonbago Island.</p>

<p>"Got leave. Coming to see you. Charlotte Corday will drop me at the
Pilot Station."</p>

<p>I had not met my husband's brother. I had an impression that he
would be fine and superior and English, and accustomed to seeing life
from the "Government House" point of view (all naval officers who came
to Leichardstown were asked to stay at Government House), and that his
idea of bush hospitality would mean riding parties, and kangaroo hunts,
and dances, and fare which, if homely, would be of its kind sumptuous.
My heart sank within me as I thought of the salt beef, and of the
limited supply of mosquito curtains, and of Mrs. Tillidge's sour face,
and of the dirt everywhere.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Alec. "We can't put him off now, seeing that the
Charlotte Corday is due the day after to-morrow. We must make the best
of it. Loftus won't mind. He has been cruising about the South Sea
Islands, and he is used to roughing it."</p>

<p>This did not console me, for roughing it on a man-of-war is a
different thing from roughing it on an island and being devoured by
still, as Alec said, we had to make the best of it; and as soon as Mr.
Kempsey had gone, I went into the spare room and inspected the mosquito
curtains, which I found sadly the worse for wear. Mending them gave me
occupation for some hours. The room certainly did not look comfortable.
The floor, like all the other floors in the house, was bare, except for
the accumulation of dirt which had been brought in by the muddy boots
of its late occupant. There was a bed, and there was a washing-basin on
a chair, and a looking-glass against the wall, and that was all. To be
sure, our own room--which for a moment I magnanimously thought of
resigning to the dreaded brother-in-law--was not much better. The floor
was quite as dirty, and the washing apparatus stood on a board placed
across two chairs; but then it had a magnificent mahogany
looking-glass, and the mosquito curtains were in slightly better
condition. On reflection, however, I decided that the looking-glass
would be thrown away on Loftus, who, Alec informed me, did not shave. I
wondered if it would be possible to set the black gins to work with a
scrubbing brush; but when I went out late in the afternoon to try and
put this bright idea into execution, I found that the gins and their
lords, beguiled by certain information which Mr. Kempsey had
unthinkingly imparted, concerning the whereabouts of another camp of
blacks near the Pilot Station, had dismantled their gunyas, packed
their dilly-bags, shouldered their piccaninnies, and were already on
their way to the North End. Mr. Kempsey had taken away the junks of
beef for the consumption of the pilots; the hawks were on the search
for prey elsewhere; and the gins' occupation was gone. It was a bitter
disappointment. I did not dare to appeal to Mrs. Tillidge. Alec had
ridden out to look for the poley cow; and so I employed the remaining
hours of light in unpacking my portmanteaus, and ruefully contemplating
my pretty frilled petticoats and trousseau oddments, and in wondering
how long the supply would last, and who would starch and iron my frills
when it had come to an end.</p>

<p>*"Go to the head station; make great haste."</p>

<p>"I think, missus, we will make a great smoke."</p>

<h3>Chapter III. The Coming of Loftus.</h3>

<p>THE sun set over Mount Akobaora, and I sat on the steps of the
verandah watching it go down across the Narrows. The air was very still
and warm, and there were bush-fires about; a smoky haze shrouded the
forest wolds, turning them to a soft bluish-grey, which, while the sun
lingered, had the faintest flush of rose. Then that died out. The night
insects came out of their hiding-places, and curious indistinct chirps
and noises mingled with the hoarse croak of the frogs in the water-hole
at the bottom of the hill. Above it all there was a low definite and
continuous roar. At first I thought the wind had risen, only the heads
of the grass--tussocks did not bend. Then I realized that the air was
thick and black, and angry buzzings sounded close to my ear, and sharp
pricks on my bare hands and neck made me wince. It was the sudden rush
and onslaught which the mosquitoes, in hiding during the glare and stir
of the day, always made at nightfall, when there was not sufficient
wind to blow them back into sheltered corners. I wrapped myself round
as best I could. When Alec came in from the run, he and the black boys,
following Mr. Kempsey's advice, set buckets filled with burning
grass-tree all about the verandah and sitting-room. We ate with such
appetite as we had from the same beef and bread which Mrs. Tillidge had
furnished forth for our luncheon, and munched Mr. Kempsey's apples, and
mournfully reflected that this was only early December, and that
mosquitoes might reasonably be supposed to rage till March. It was not
a cheerful prospect, but we were determined not to take the dark view
of things, and Alec impressed upon me that this was really the first
evening he had known upon the Island when there was no breeze.</p>

<p>"It is generally enough to knock a fellow down, let alone the
mosquitoes," said Alec; and we planned how we would dispose of our
knick-knacks and wedding presents, and how we would curtain in a corner
of the verandah, and how we would cultivate the arid patch of garden,
and, after a little time, revel in roses; and how, as soon as the
cattle were across the Narrows, we would get rid of the Tillidges, and
have a hard-working, cheerful "married couple," who would rear poultry,
and curry the salt junk, and accommodate themselves to circumstances
generally; and how at the end of all things we would sell the Island
when the cattle had multiplied--and they multiplied in our imaginations
after the fashion of the ring-straked and speckled cattle in the herds
of Laban, the son of Nahor, which Jacob tended--"You know that's one
advantage in an island," said Alec, persuasively, "there's no one to
brand our calves, and the cattle can't stray away, and so the stock are
bound to increase more quickly than they could on a mainland
station"--and how then we would invest our rapidly-made fortune, and
set sail for England. That was how we talked; and Rose beat her
sympathetic tattoo on the floor all the while; and we were not at all
cast down, considering how our skins smarted with the mosquito bites,
and how the smoke from the burning grass-tree got into our eyes and up
our noses, and made us cough with its pungent aromatic odour.</p>

<p>"As soon as we get settled down a bit, we must have Lina Sabine
over," said Alec; "she will be a nice companion for you; and she must
be dull too, for Sabine has to be a good deal away at his reef now that
he has gone in for gold-mining."</p>

<p>I knew all about the Sabines, though I had only seen Mrs. Sabine
once when she had come into Gundabine for the day with her husband. She
was very pretty, and she was very young, and she had only been married
a few months. I wondered why she had married Mr. Sabine, who was
loutish and stupid, and had the reputation of taking more brandy than
was good for him. But then so many people in the Gundabine district did
that, and Mr. Sabine, who was a squatter, over from Mount Akobaora, had
struck on a rich reef, and was going to be a millionaire, it was said.
Mrs. Sabine had been one of the northern belles, and Alec told me that
she had had more offers than she could count, and before she married
she had been considered a flirt. I wondered sometimes if she had
flirted with Alec, and if that was the secret of his interest in her;
but he never would tell me anything about that, and only said that he
and Lina had always been first-rate friends, and that Sabine wasn't
half a bad fellow; and that she was a clever girl and a lady, which was
more than he could say for all the Gundabine young women. On the whole
I was disposed to like Mrs. Sabine, and I was disposed not to be
jealous; and I didn't press Alec as to whether he had ever had any
tender passages with Lina. I think that young wives who question their
husbands closely on these points have a very undeveloped sentiment of
honour as regards other women. In fact, though I do not like to say
hard things of my own sex, I cannot help feeling that the
unsatisfactory condition of social machinery is in a great measure due
to this want of loyalty between woman and woman. Sitting over our
conjugal tete-&agrave;-tete in the verandah, we could hear Mr. and Mrs.
Tillidge indulging in a conjugal wrangle in the kitchen over their pan
of burning grass-tree. That is to say, we could hear Mrs. Tillidge; for
Tillidge seemed to keep true to his philosophic principle of silence.
Mrs. Tillidge wasn't going to wait on people that ought to have been
brought up to wait on themselves, and that were no better than she was
herself, and that should have the sense to stop over in Gundabine till
they could persuade a servant, as was a servant, and used to muck, to
come and let herself be eaten alive by insects. If Tillidge thought
that Mrs. Tillidge meant to stand it he was very much mistaken, and if
he thought that soda scones and milk puddings and starched muslin
skirts were necessary for people that chose to settle themselves in an
island that--let alone women--wasn't fit for beasts to live in, why he
might make them, and starch them, and iron them,
and--viciously--gauffre them, too, if he pleased; but she wasn't going
to, that was all. Mrs. Tillidge had been hired to cook for a master,
but she hadn't been hired to cook for a mistress; and she wasn't going
to set two lunches in the day for anybody; and if people were hungry,
they might wait till the gentlemen came in from the run, or else help
themselves. Then the wrathful monologue became inarticulate, and seemed
to have moved to a little distance, being diversified with sundry
clattering and snapping noises. Mrs. Tillidge was evidently settling
the fire for the night. After a bit, Tillidge's voice sounded for the
first time, slow and rasping, but with a quaver in it which we felt
boded ill. "Now, look here, Louisa, I ain't going to be bossed into
doing a nasty trick; and I tell you I mean to see those store cattle
across the Narrows; and you may jaw as much as you please, but I won't
go off till the whole lot are mustered; then I'll clear out as fast as
you please, for I don't like being eaten alive any more than you do."
And we heard the back kitchen door bang, and concluded that the
discussion was closed for the present. Alec and I drew a deep breath,
and looked at each other and laughed uneasily. The situation was
critical. Mrs. Tillidge might succeed in "bossing" Tillidge, to our
serious inconvenience, perhaps to the loss of our great sale; and it
would be all my fault.</p>

<p>"We must get through the muster as quickly as possible," said Alec
mournfully; "and you must do the best you can with Loftus, and keep out
of that vixen's way. I believe she is right, Rachel, and the Island
isn't fit for beasts to live in, let alone human beings. Look at those
poor wretches of horses."</p>

<p>Indeed, I had been pitying the horses for some time, though I hadn't
called Alec's attention to their misery. A dozen or more had gathered
round the verandah railings, and were poking their heads into the smoke
and whinnying piteously. They couldn't get under the curtains, poor
brutes! and their garment of hair was small protection against the
savage assaults of the Island breed. "Oh, Alec," I cried, "you must
send away those miserable things without any tails. How could any one
have been so barbarous!"</p>

<p>I wanted him to put out the buckets of smouldering grass-tree, so
that the horses might gather round the smoke; but he was afraid to do
that, lest the buckets should be kicked over, and the grass round the
house, and perhaps the fence, set alight; so we went to bed and lay in
comparative peace within the netting, listening to the whirr of the
insects, which was like that of machinery in motion, and the melancholy
snorts outside. I stayed awake a long time, suffering as Abraham might
have suffered had he known of the tortures of Dives. Those horses got
on my nerves, and kept me awake many a night afterwards.</p>

<p>I did the best I could the next day to make ready for the English
brother-in-law, but that best did not amount to much. The poley cow,
which was a valuable beast, still absorbed Alec's attention, and he
went out on the run with Tillidge and the black boys, so that I was
left to my own devices. Mrs. Tillidge kept to the kitchen, or passed
stolidly to and fro in the yard as she fetched water from the tanks,
true to her determination to ignore my presence in the establishment;
and I was too shy and too proud to disturb her by asking questions or
favours. I made my bed and put things as tidy as I could in the
sitting-room and the chamber destined for our coming guest, and
rummaged about till I found a broom and a duster; but the floor was too
ingrained with dirt for the broom to be of much use. It was very hot--a
still brooding heat, with smoke on the horizon telling of bush fires
across the Narrows, and a cloud hanging over Mount Akobaora. I hoped
there might be a thunderstorm by-and-by, and gave a few minutes to
memories of the delicious freshness, the damp fragrance of earth and
flowers, the louder gurgle of running river, the sense of renewed life
in man and beast and bird and insect, which have been wont to follow a
summer storm among my dear Ubi mountains. But, alas! there was the
mournful reflection that here dampness and drip would mean an increased
activity in the mosquito world.</p>

<p>There was a great deal else to be thought of, however. As I took
stock of our accommodation, I wished with all my heart that Captain
Jarvis and the pilot schooner, with our furniture and crockery and
groceries, were now on their way up the Narrows. But this was not to be
yet, and in the meantime we must all--English brother-in-law
included--submit to rough it, with the best grace in our power.</p>

<p>I thought it possible, in spite of the meagre fare set before us on
the previous evening, that there might be resources in the commissariat
with which Mrs. Tillidge had not chosen to make herself acquainted.
After some search I found the store keys hanging on a nail in the
office, and went resolutely across the back yard, under the eyes of
Mrs. Tillidge, to explore the slab outbuilding with its earthen-floored
verandah, and the hides drooping over its bark roof. One of the doors
had a great rusty padlock, into which my largest key fitted, and I
found myself in a dim cobweb-hung room, with gaping apertures in the
slab walls, and bloated tarantulas enjoying themselves in the dusty
corners, and the traces of my dreaded white lizard visible in the
rafters above. There was a stack of flour bales reaching nearly to the
wall-plate, and a smaller one of sticky mats of ration sugar; beside it
there was a chest of coarse tea, and under the window a sort of counter
with scales and weights and tin scoops upon it that sorely needed
scouring. I found a tub of caked tobacco, and clay pipes in plenty, and
kegs of rum, a case of whisky, and soap and soda, and turpentine, and
bluestone for horses' backs, and tar, and such-like necessaries of
existence on a cattle station; but I found no tinned delicacies, nor
any of the small luxuries with which a bush store is usually so
liberally furnished. It was evident that no comfort was to be gained
here.</p>

<p>Then I went to the meat-store, which was unsavoury and distinctly
suggestive of bachelor housekeeping, and where there were only cakes of
pickled beef and piles of corned junk and heaps of large-grained salt.
I left the place sadly, and wandered about. It occurred to me that I
had heard the crowing of a cock, and that where there were cocks there
must be hens, and that a dilapidated fowl-house at the back of the
kitchen, which I had certainly observed when driving up, might furnish
forth fresh eggs; but the hens, if there were any, seemed, like other
inhabitants of the Island, untrained in the ways of civilization, and
preferred apparently to make their nests among the grass tussocks.
Anyhow, there were no traces of occupation in the fowl-house, which I
decided would, when lime-washed and provided with straw and boxes, make
a very comfortable domicile for respectably brought-up hens. Clearly
the Island poultry, for want of improving companionship, had fallen
into nomadic habits, and a condition of barbarism which it would take
an importation of barn-door missionaries to improve.</p>

<p>I walked back towards the house in a depressed frame of mind, making
a little detour to the front, through rank blady grass and over the
fallen bodies of dead gum-trees, rather than go across the yard and
allow Mrs. Tillidge to triumph over my discomfiture. As I approached
the verandah I heard a queer defiant cackle, and a lean, leggy,
ferocious-looking hen walked out from under the house, and at sight of
me flew in a scared manner down the hill. She was not a prepossessing
hen. There was nothing comfortable or clucking or domestic or hen-like
about her. She seemed rather to resemble a tamed eagle. But still she
had evidently laid an egg, and I felt pleasantly disposed to that hen,
and anxious to encourage her to be sociable. So I called "Chuck, chuck,
chuck!" in a persuasive crescendo, and threw out a handful of weevily
rice which I had brought from the store; and presently I had the
satisfaction of seeing her return in company with two other hens,
gaunter and more savage than herself, but with a certain air of birth,
for these were of a hybrid Spanish breed, and had black feathers and
red eyes; whereas my hen had come of lowly speckled parents. With them
was a cock which had lost its comb and most of its tail feathers. They
were good enough to gobble up the rice, however, and then with shrill
screeches darted into the gully again. Presently I made my way among
the log piles under the house, and sure enough I found a nest--just
such an uncomfortable nest as that hen would have made, a hole
scratched in the damp soil at the edge of the channel which the bath
water had worked for itself. There were half--a-dozen eggs in the nest,
and one of them was pink and thin-shelled, and evidently new-laid. I
was as pleased at the sight of those eggs as if I had discovered a
treasure, and grubbed about till I got right under the bung--hole of
the bath, but without coming upon any more. Determined to pursue my
investigations, I crept into the garden patch, and, duly mindful of
snakes, poked carefully in the dry grass and round about the aloe and
poinsettia shrub, where I was rewarded by finding two more nests, each
with several eggs in it. I strewed some rice close to the nest, so that
the hens might see that they were to be rewarded for doing their duty.
By this time it was long past the luncheon hour; and I began to see
that Mrs. Tillidge meant to be as good as her word, and did not intend
to set two luncheons in the day. I felt that I hated Mrs. Tillidge. I
should have liked to go boldly to the kitchen and demand that a meal
should be served. I should have delighted to order fresh scones and
fried junk. I would even have sent her to the stockyard to gather
fat-hen, to do duty as cabbage for bubble-and-squeak. But I thought of
Alec's perplexities, and of those store cattle, and of Tillidge and the
debt, so I relinqished the idea of "bossing" Mrs. Tillidge, and meekly
searched in the pantry for a piece of the three-cornered loaf, and
breaking one of my fresh eggs into a tumbler with a spoonful of Alec's
brandy, lunched with grim satisfaction in the thought that at any rate
I was not going to be starved out by the enemy. I lunched in the same
way--with the addition of a slice of salt beef which I would secrete at
breakfast when Alec was not looking--all the time Mrs. Tillidge was
with us. She never would serve anything till the sound of cracking
stockwhips and lowing cattle was heard, about four o'clock, when the
men came in from the run, and Alec was in too great a hurry to get to
the yards again to ask any questions. I had every reason to be grateful
to those hens for providing me with a relish to my meagre repasts.</p>

<p>There was no thunderstorm that day, and the mosquitoes were not
quite so bad in the evening. The next day Alec went up himself with the
spare horse, and brought back his brother from the pilot station. I
felt very nervous when I heard Loftus's decidedly British voice in the
yard; and my Australian shyness of the travelled English visitor--who
is hold in very different estimation from the ordinary "new chum" about
to serve his Colonial apprenticeship--prevented me from going out to
welcome him as I might otherwise have done. The voice was very hearty
and good-humoured, but it had a round, imperious ring in it, I thought;
and the polite but formal way in which he requested Mrs. Tillidge to
give him a glass of water made my soul shrink.</p>

<p>"You haven't got any beer, have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Alec. "You don't often get beer in the bush. It's an
expensive luxury--the carriage and all that, you know. But there's
plenty of grog inside."</p>

<p>Loftus did not seem to care about the grog. "By Jove!" I heard him
cry, "what's that? I declare it's a mosquito; and I never saw such a
big 'un, even at the Solomons." And then I heard him tell how, when
they were cruising along the South Sea Islands, where mosquitoes were
troublesome, they always put to sea when dusk fell, so as to get away
from them.</p>

<p>"We haven't got a man-of-war here to put out to sea in," rejoined
Alec; "and I may as well tell you straight off, old fellow, the
mosquitoes are a caution on this Island."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can stand them if Rachel can," replied Loftus; and by
this time he had got into the sitting-room and we had made
acquaintance. I began to think that I need not be so much in awe, after
all, of my English brother-in-law, though he was of quite a different
type from the ordinary colonial young man, and even from Alec, who had
rubbed off a little of his polish, and took rather a pride sometimes in
being more bushman than the bushmen. Loftus was very good-looking,
bright, cheery, and gracious, with a sailor's ease of manner and a
sailor's compact figure and somewhat rolling walk. He was clear and
fresh-complexioned, and I thought with a sigh how the mosquitoes would
love him. He had not been in the house ten minutes before he had made
himself quite at home. First of all, he made us tell him all about our
marriage, and what we had paid for the station, and whether "the
governor had come down handsomely," and then what sort of a wedding
present I would like best, and what was the pedigree of the bull pup;
and what yield of wool we hoped to get from the Angora goat, Christo;
and where our supplies came from, and how much it would cost to start a
steam-launch between the Island and Gundabine. He insisted on being
taken into every room, declared the office to be as cozy a den as any
one could desire, if only it were cleaned up a bit; inspected the
station ledgers, took down "Spooner on Sheep," resolved to glean all
the information possible about Australian rural life, and was much
disappointed at learning that there were no sheep on the Island.</p>

<p>He was most anxious to investigate the peculiar customs of the white
lizard, and would have tried then and there to hunt one out and get
hold of a tail if the tarantulas had not set him off on a new tack. It
seemed to me that there never was any one with such an inquiring mind
as Loftus. He did not object at all to the accommodation we offered
him, and seemed to regard the chair washstand and the dirty floor as
part of the business. He grasped the situation at once, entering into
our difficulties about Captain Jarvis and the pilot schooner, and soon
it became a joke of his to demand truffles, caviare, a spring mattress,
or a Turkish bath with the most lordly assurance, and then to exclaim,
"Oh, of course; it's in the pilot schooner!"</p>

<p>He was wont to declare that the pilot schooner must be as big as
Noah's ark to contain all the things we said were in it.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV. The Battle of the Shirt.</h3>

<p>WE did not let Loftus into all the secrets of our establishment. We
did not tell him about the trouble with Mr. and Mrs. Tillidge, lest he
should feel strained in his relations with her; and we were certain
that she would not allow herself to be embarrassed by them. Fortunately
Loftus seemed to share Mr. Micawber's views as to dramatic fitness in
regard to emigration. He quite revelled in the iron cups, and preferred
his clasp knife to the horn-handled one laid for him, as being more
appropriate to a settler's condition. He did, however, think it a
little hard that a young woman who had been brought up to a milder form
of bush life, and presumably was not sustained by any idea of the
dramatic, should be condemned to salt junk as hard as nails and
camp-oven bread. As for himself, it was of no consequence; he was
accustomed to junk. But, having already learned from the blacks that
there was wild duck to be had for the shooting, he announced his
intention of going out the next day with his gun, and giving us a treat
at to-morrow's dinner. We got on very well, on the whole, at the first
meal. We had it early, before the mosquito onslaught had fairly begun,
and our pans of grass-tree were set alight at sundown in the verandah.
Loftus bore the attacks of the foe with equanimity, only every now and
then ejaculating, "By Jingo! this does beat the flies in Honolulu!" Mr.
Kempsey had sent us the apricot jam and pickles, and I had boiled some
eggs in my etna, disdaining to apply to Mrs. Tillidge, who eyed the
addition to our party with sullen resentment; and I related my
adventures in search of the eggs, and my plan for Christianizing the
poultry.</p>

<p>But as we sat on the verandah afterwards among our smoking pans, the
men with their pipes, I waving about a palmetto-leaf fan, and the
brothers, who had not met for many years, comparing notes and talking
over reminiscences of their youth, Loftus grew gradually more and more
uneasy under the attacks of the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>He slapped himself and wriggled about, and then got up and tied his
trousers tight round his ankles with handkerchiefs, wondering where in
the name of fortune they all came from, and lurched up and down the
verandah as if it were the deck of a man-of-war, haranguing and
slapping all the time; while Alec kept on asseverating that it was all
because of the muggy weather, and that when a breeze sprang up our
enemies would vanish, and tried to divert Loftus's thoughts by tempting
suggestions of pig-sticking. There were some pigs on the Island which
had gone wild, and with regard to which my housewifely imagination was
already working and picturing rashers of streaky bacon and nice brown
hams. Loftus took very kindly to the idea of pig-sticking, and also to
that of stock-riding, though he stipulated that he should not be sent
out on a run on a buck-jumper, and that he should be allowed to carry
his gun with him. The mosquitoes roared that night like Pacific
breakers on the Great Barrier Reef, and it was with some trepidation
that I prepared to meet Loftus in the morning. I wondered if I could
have left any holes unmended in the mosquito curtains. Apparently I had
left a good many, or he had not tucked them in properly. Poor Loftus
was a shocking spectacle. I found him wrapped in dismal contemplation
of a black velvety patch at one of the corners of the canvas coiling,
where myriads of mosquitoes, stupefied by their debauch, had huddled
one upon another, to sleep off the effects of their orgie. "If one
could run a needle here and there through them, what would be the
colour of the ceiling?" darkly suggested Loftus. He told me that he had
spent the night in waging war against his tormenters with a towel, and
in pondering how he might best make himself an object of repulsion to
them. "I think kerosene might do it," he said. "You see, after living
for so long on horses and natives--for you and Alec are a little stale,
you know--my blood is a variety to them, and they like it." Accordingly
he anointed himself with paraffin oil, and for a while was quite
jubilant over the success of his experiment. He went out early with
Island Billy and shot some ducks, which he took round to the kitchen
and delivered to Mrs. Tillidge, with polite instructions as to how they
ought to be dressed. I heard his remarks from the sitting-room, and
knew that Mrs. Tillidge had received them in grim silence.</p>

<p>After that Loftus betook himself to the stockyard, where
square-tailing was going on. I had to explain to him first that
"square-tailing" meant chopping the ends off the tails of those animals
which were drafted through the crush into the mob destined for sale.
Loftus was very much interested in the process, and we walked down
together in the full heat of the day to the stockyard, where a small
herd was being manipulated by Alec and Tillidge and the black boys.</p>

<p>There was a cloud of dust over the yards; and below it a confusion
of heaving red and yellow backs and tossing horns. Through the dust
Alec appeared, seated on the thick top rail of one of the inner fences,
while Tillidge jumped hither and thither, poking up the animals with a
long pole, and every now and then making a rush for the rails as a pair
of horns came dangerously near. Above the bellowing of the cattle rose
the shouts of the men--now Alec calling out, as he waved his stick
towards one or other of the yards, "Milker over here," or "Store mob!"
or "That one to the Fats"; and then Tillidge would wrathfully adjure
the black boys stationed in the corners to open and shut the gates upon
the beasts which were drafted through. "Now then, Billy, be smart with
that gate"; or "Look out for that baldy bullock,"--or, to the dogs,
"S'ool him, Bleuey!" "Heel him up, Spider!" It was quite surprising to
see the taciturn Tillidge so energetic and ejaculatory.</p>

<p>The scene was really rather exciting, and, though I had often beheld
such an one, I could not help taking up my stand for a little while at
the outer rails, well away from man or beast, and watching it with my
head craned round the corner post. Loftus sprang up to the cap of the
fence, and from thence commanded the situation. I observed him every
now and then make a lurch down the other side into an empty yard, when
the horns came close under him; and he soon saw that it would not do to
keep his legs dangling, but drew them up to the top rail, so that his
knees and his chin were on a level, and it was a wonder how he
contrived to maintain his balance.</p>

<p>Luncheon--if any special name can be given to meals which were all
exactly the same--was over, and Loftus smoking his pipe in the
verandah, when Alec drew me aside with consternation and amusement on
his face.</p>

<p>"I'm in a fix," he said. "Loftus hasn't got any clean shirts. He
wants a shirt washed at once. I didn't like to tell him that Mrs.
Tillidge would see him to Jericho before she washed a shirt for him;
and that anyhow I couldn't ask her, for fear that she should boss
Tillidge to the extent of making him pack his swag and go off. What are
we to do?"</p>

<p>"Lend him one of yours," I suggested.</p>

<p>"No use at all," said Alec. "His shoulders are six inches broader
across than mine. He'd split any one of my Crimeans. It's showing up
the nakedness of the land," he went on; "and Loftus is such a good
fellow, but he is a bit sensitive about things, and it would make him
downright uncomfortable to think he was putting us to inconvenience. He
would rather wear his shirt grimy than that."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't want starching, would it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear, no," replied Alec. "It's one of those silk and wool
affairs--no trouble at all if Mrs. Tillidge wasn't such a wretch."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if it will save the credit of the establishment, I
don't see why I shouldn't wash the shirt. Only you must never let him
know."</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Loftus's shirt was smuggled into my bedroom, and
as soon as he and Alec had gone back again to their square-tailing I
set myself to my task, which was less easy of accomplishment without
sacrifice of dignity than I had imagined. In the first place, there was
nothing to wash it in but my basin; for though I had seen zinc tubs and
a bluebag, and irons, and sundry washing apparatus on a shelf at the
back of the kitchen, I had gleaned that all this was Mrs. Tillidge's
private and personal property, and I could not, of course, demean
myself by borrowing from her. Then, too, I had to fetch the water I
wanted in a bucket from the tank right under Mrs. Tillidge's eyes. I
hoped, however, that she might account for my two or three journeys on
the supposition that I had taken it into my head to water the aloe and
the poinsettia shrub. I found that the piece of soap in my bedroom was
quite insufficient for the undertaking, and had to make an excursion to
the store, thus further provoking Mrs. Tillidge's curiosity. Thence I
conveyed across the yard, and partially concealed in the folds of my
dress, a half bar of yellow soap, and some blue, and a flat iron, which
treasure I rummaged out of a box of odds and ends hidden away under the
flour bin. I am a little ashamed to write of my shifts and contrivances
to save my dignity, but perhaps if I had not been a bride, and shorn of
all the glories of bridehood through Mrs. Tillidge's evil disposition,
I might not have felt so anxious to preserve in her sight the little
remnant of superior circumstance that was left to me. I made a blue-bag
out of a sock of Alec's and lighted a fire against a stump outside for
my iron to heat at, and at last set to work on the shirt. The water in
the basin had to be changed a great many times before it was rinsed
clean. I dried it on the grass, ironed it on a shawl which I spread
upon the ground, and when all was done, laid it neatly folded upon
Loftus's bed.</p>

<p>I was changing my dress for dinner, and Mrs. Tillidge in the next
room was laying the table, when through the wooden partition I heard
Loftus say in a gracious manner--</p>

<p>"I'm so much obliged to you, Mrs. Tillidge, for getting up my shirt
so nicely. I shall have another for you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I didn't wash your shirt!" rejoined Mrs. Tillidge, defiantly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you? Then I've got to thank somebody else, it seems," said
Loftus, pleasantly; "but I made sure it was you, Mrs. Tillidge."</p>

<p>"I wasn't engaged to do washing," said Mrs. Tillidge, loftily. "I
don't undertake service. It was Mrs. Ansdell that washed your shirt, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Alec told the tale. I could hear the brothers laughing. When I came
into the sitting-room, Loftus cried--</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Rachel, I'm going to set-up a laundry for myself,
at my own end of the verandah, and I don't want to be interfered
with."</p>

<p>We explained the position of affairs, and Loftus agreed that any
sacrifice of pride must be made rather than that Mrs. Tillidge should
"boss" Tillidge into spoiling the sale. It was hard, however, for
Loftus to repress his indignation when Mrs. Tillidge set down the
inevitable lump of gutta-percha-like beef and the three-cornered loaf.
"I say," he ejaculated; "what about my ducks?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tillidge," said Alec, in a tone of gentle insinuation, "I
thought Mr. Loftus had shot some wild duck?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tillidge was stolidly indifferent.</p>

<p>"I believe so," she observed, without a smile.</p>

<p>"Two brace, and as fine birds as you ever set eyes on," put in
Loftus.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tillidge," said Alec, "it's too late to-night, but might we
not have those ducks for dinner tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, they're there," assented Mrs. Tillidge, sulkily--"if anybody
likes to pluck them. And I am sure I don't know who will like to pluck
them. The black boys are camping out, and there ain't a odd-job man on
this station."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tillidge," said Loftus, "if you will permit me, I will pluck
the ducks." Loftus was deeply moved by this miscarriage of his attempt
to improve our bill of fare. "I will be odd-job man to-morrow," he
declared; "I will put off my first experience of mustering. To-morrow,
Rachel, I will wash my shirts; and then I will pluck the four
ducks--and then--I will scrub out the office."</p>

<p>We ate a peripatetic meal that evening, and came to the conclusion
that perhaps after all it was as well that our enjoyment of the ducks
was postponed, since Alec still insisted that there must be a wind
to-morrow which would settle the mosquitoes. Loftus found that the
paraffin oil was of little avail when night closed in. "Nothing does it
but smoke," he exclaimed dejectedly, "and it must be green smoke, I
see."</p>

<p>He went outside and cut some long wisps of the grass-tree heads. He
bound the withes round till they stiffened, and when lighted smoked
like smouldering torches; then taking one himself, he gave one each to
Alec and me. A stranger would have laughed to see us as we walked
rapidly round the table, holding what seemed like green tapers, the
smoke of which, as we moved, kept our persecutors at bay; and every now
and then pausing to eat a mouthful, or cracking some dismal joke at the
comical appearance we presented, Loftus haranguing all the time, and
poor Alec looking as miserable as though he were personally responsible
for our discomfort.</p>

<p>But the next night a storm of wind did rise, and such a storm! It
began with thunder and hail, and ended in what Alec called a real
south-easterly burster. The canvas ceilings bulged like a stage sea,
hailstones rattled on the roof, and rain beat in torrents under the
ill-fitting French windows. The next day all was clear, only a heavenly
coolness followed the hail, and for several days the south-east gale
blew strong and clear, bringing us respite from our petty warfare, and
filling us with renewed vigour and cheerfulness. The horses, poor
beasts, welcomed the change as joyfully as we did ourselves. They, too,
enjoyed life once more. They no longer congregated at evening round the
verandah, but kept down in the rich pasture of the flat, whence, above
the soughing of the wind and the eerie cries of the curlews and howls
of native dogs, we could sometimes hear them whinnying to each other,
as if in mutual congratulation. Loftus set up his laundry, as he had
announced he would, and openly washed his shirts at one end of the
verandah, and dried them on the railings. He also plucked the ducks,
and brought me the feathers to stuff a cushion with, for he said he was
determined Mrs. Tillidge shouldn't score on those birds. He took them
round to the kitchen when they were all prepared, and politely insisted
that they should be cooked for dinner. In very shame she was obliged to
agree; and I may as well mention here that for the rest of Loftus's
stay we feasted upon ducks, hot and cold, which he shot and always
plucked himself. He talked a good deal about fishing excursions to the
Narrows, and worked himself into an enthusiasm over the preparation of
tackle; but an hour's experience of the mosquitoes and sand-flies down
among the mangroves at the landing quenched his ardour, and we did not
hear anything more about fried bream and dressed crab. The mosquitoes
were the only things that seriously affected Loftus's energy.</p>

<p>After he had plucked the first lot of ducks and had announced to me
the truce with Mrs. Tillidge, Loftus went off again, and presently I
heard a considerable commotion in the yard--a sound of much drawing of
water and loud requests for scrubbing-brushes, to which Mrs. Tillidge
responded not over promptly. When I went out I found that the office
had been cleared of all its furniture, and that a raid had been made on
Mrs. Tillidge's tubs, which, filled with water, stood in a row on the
back verandah. Loftus was surveying them with the air of Nelson on the
deck of the Victory.</p>

<p>"I mean to scrub it out, Rachel," he declared, in a tone of fierce
determination; "I shall get rid of those beasts of spiders and lizards,
and make a cosy smoking den out of it; and then it strikes me that if
we could manage a curtain of mosquito netting to fit down over the
doorway, we might have peace in the evenings. This wind won't last for
ever. But, look here, don't you come round and open the door, for I
shall probably take off my clothes to this job."</p>

<p>I left him to his undertaking, in which he was still engaged when
Alec and the men came home from their day's muster. As I sat in the
verandah, at work on a piece of cheese-cloth which I had unearthed in
the saddle--room, and which I thought might serve the purpose of a
curtain better than mosquito netting, I could see rivulets straining
down from under the house, which testified to the thoroughness of
Loftus's cleansing operations. By-and-by he came out, very red and very
hot, and looking as if he had only just got into his garments, but
extremely triumphant. He showed me the mangled corpses of three large
tarantulas and a centipede. But, to his infinite regret, he had not
solved the mystery of the white lizard and its movable tail, for he had
not been able to investigate the rafters satisfactorily.</p>

<p>"You could eat your dinner off every single square inch of the
place," he exclaimed, and there was no doubt about the advantages we
reaped from that scrubbing bout of Loftus's. Instead of the bare
glaring, blindless, western sitting-room, with its horrible blue walls
and aggressive oilcloth, in which there was certainly not one square
inch on which the eye could rest without being affronted, we now had a
sweet--smelling, cosy little parlour, the walls of their soft native
brown, shaded from the sun, and into which penetrated every cool
south-eastern breath that blew. Loftus's plan of the cheese-cloth
curtain answered admirably by dint of a little contrivance. We tied it
round the lintel and kept it dropped all day, and at night, when the
mosquitoes were roaring and buzzing outside, we sat in comparative
immunity from their assaults behind our protecting barrier; and, but
for the small drawback of directly facing the kitchen window, and the
painful consciousness that we might at any moment hear some home-truths
from the lips of Mrs. Tillidge, our evening chats and Loftus's and
Alec's family reminiscences would have been very enjoyable.</p>

<p>Loftus after this abandoned housekeeping operations, and took to
going out on the run. He particularly requested that the quietest horse
on the station might be given him, and at Tillidge's suggestion King
Cole was brought saddled into the yard. King Cole was long-legged and
scraggy, with a huge head and resigned expression which reminded me of
Rose, the pointer. His tail was lopped, he had suffered much from the
mosquitoes, and he was covered with bald spots where the girth had
chafed him, or a crack from a stockwhip had caught him, or some other
mishap had caused the hair to fall away. Loftus forthwith changed his
name to Lazarus, and it certainly seemed to suit him better than the
somewhat ironical appellation of King Cole. Loftus and Lazarus had
sundry adventures together; but though they were not always of the same
mind, they seemed to understand each other, and while he was on the
Island Loftus would not mount any other animal. Upon one occasion, when
Loftus was duck-stalking, Lazarus broke his bridle, which was fastened
to the bough of a ti-tree, and refused to be caught, marching on
serenely in front of his master, deaf to blandishments and
objurgations, and stopping to gaze back in amiable derision at a
distance of twenty yards, then trotting forward again. Loftus had a
ten-mile walk with his gun, in the full heat of the day, and had to go
back to the head station for Tillidge's assistance that the saddle
might be saved, as Lazarus showed every intention of bolting to the
bush. Another time a native dog, suddenly surprised, snapped at
Lazarus's heels, and Lazarus perpetrated a mild buck-jump, and landed
Loftus on the ground. He did not, however, run away this time, and
Loftus, nothing daunted, mounted again and chased the native dog, which
he shot and skinned, bringing the tan hide to me as a trophy. Then
there was a very terrible encounter with a wild pig, in which Lazarus
distinguished himself by bolting into a morass and getting bogged, and
when Loftus was for some moments in a perilous position, but managed to
escape up a gum-tree with only the loss of his shoes in the swamp.</p>

<p>While Alec was short-handed during the muster, Loftus undertook to
carry rations to the pilot station, and accordingly set off on Lazarus,
with his swag of salt beef in front of the saddle, and armed with full
directions and a pocket compass. But though he carefully followed the
track of the line of trees which had been blazed, Loftus lost his way.
He told us that a kangaroo had got up just under Lazarus's nose and set
them both wrong. The two wandered about all day along gullies and hills
and scrubs, and then night fell, and Loftus in despair determined to
put his trust in Lazarus, and giving the horse his bridle, let him go
whither he would. Lazarus was a horse of cool judgment. He stopped and
browsed reflectively, while Loftus, not to be outdone in philosophy,
lighted his pipe and waited. Presently Lazarus, having reviewed the
situation, and having decided upon the best course to pursue, pricked
up his ears, turned his head in a sideward direction and jogged on
cheerfully, in the end proving himself worthy of complete confidence.
Loftus, however, owned that he did not altogether feel comfortable, as
Lazarus, forsaking the faintest vestige of track, forced his way
through reak-neck gullies, at the imminent risk of dislodging both the
swag of meat and Loftus himself, who had not been trained to
bush-riding.</p>

<p>Alec and I were sitting in the office behind our mosquito screen
when a chorus, composed of Monte's aggressive bark, the bull-pup's
cantankerous whine, Rose's deprecatory yap and tail-tattoo, and
Beaufort's big contemptuous growl, told us that Loftus had come back.
It was a feature of Island life that, except at new and full moon, when
the Narrows were crossable, we need never be under any alarm and
uncertainty as to late visitors, for we knew that the only possible
arrivals must be from the pilot station. Loftus was just a little
crestfallen, but determined not to be beaten. There never was anybody
so energetic as Loftus. He at once declared his intention of setting
forth again the first thing next morning, and of delivering that meat
or dying in the attempt. He begged the unwonted treat of a supper of
corn for Lazarus, and went down himself with a tin colander to the bin
where our crushed Indian corn was kept, and measured out a substantial
feed.</p>

<h3>Chapter V. A Message of Deliverance.</h3>

<p>IT was the 23rd of December. Loftus had bidden me good-bye. His
good-bye was mournful and compassionate--like the farewell of one who
is seeing the last of a doomed comrade. Loftus said that he should be
surprised to find that the mosquitoes had left anything of me when he
came back from his two years' cruise in the South Seas. It was quite
certain that the mosquitoes had eaten a good deal of Loftus. He made us
observe his shrunken proportions, and declared that he should now find
no difficulty in getting into one of Alec's shirts. His bones stood
out. He was pale, except where his skin showed red inflamed patches.
His sufferings were acute. He said they reminded him of a certain mode
of torture prevalent among the Red Indians, in which the victim is left
by an ant-bed and gradually bitten to death. He said that though I was
native--born and uninviting on that account, and though Alec was
well-hardened, he had a presentiment that he was leaving us both to be
slowly devoured. He implored that we would take immediate steps to sell
the Island. On the last night of his stay, after deep consultation with
Alec, during which he learned all about the mortgage to the bank, and
how much depended upon our muster and sale of cattle, he wrote a
telegram to Alec's father in England, couched somewhat after the terms
in which a beleaguered garrison might supplicate immediate relief from
the commander of the army. This desperate idea had, indeed, occurred to
us before. We had spoken of it with bated breath, and had shuddered in
awesome prevision of the outburst of paternal wrath which such an
audacious step would certainly call forth. But Loftus's intrepid spirit
knew no fears. He said that the Island mosquitoes were the only things
in the world that had ever made him quail. So he wrote out the
telegram--I had a notion then that he meant to send a pathethic message
on his own account, telling of the mosquito plague--and Alec rode with
him to the North End to see him put off in the pilot boat to the mail
steamer, which was due to pass on the 24th, and also to make quite sure
that the telegram was sent safely. There seemed something sacrilegious
in the idea of entrusting that telegram, like an ordinary message, into
the hands of Polly Kempsey, who, however, though she was only sixteen,
was a dear little girl and an excellent operator--that telegram which,
in wild moments of elated hope, we ventured to fancy might bring about
the reduction of our debt and lift us above anxiety over the number of
cattle we could muster for sale, and the propitiation of Mr. and Mrs.
Tillidge's temper.</p>

<p>The lonely little pilot station jutting out into the Pacific was our
closest connecting link with the great world. Its lighthouse marked on
one side the entrance to Stonehampton Harbour, as may be seen in any
map of the Australian coast, for, like the ostrich burying its head in
the sand, my localities hide themselves under thin disguises. Every
steamer that passed within the Great Barrier Reef northwards to the
Equator, or southwards towards the Antarctic zone, was sighted from the
Cape. Sometimes, when they were signalled, the steamers would slacken
speed and wait for the pilot boat, and except when we had business at
Gundabine which obliged us to cross the Narrows, we always chose to be
dropped off the Island in this way, so that at a few minutes' notice we
might have found ourselves bound for the Loochoo Islands, or the
Persian Gulf, or any other place in either hemisphere. It seemed so
strange that we were able to flash our little message from this
desolate headland right into the very heart of Suffolk, and to get an
answer back in a few hours--that we could, by spreading our wings, as
it were, fly from our rock in the Pacific to any quarter of the globe.
There was a thrill of freedom in the mere thought.</p>

<p>Our muster was at a standstill; the men were to have their Christmas
holidays, and they were all going that day to the South End to meet
Rame's boat, which was to take them across to Gundabine for a "spree."
Rame brought our mail over from Gundabine once a week, or thereabouts,
as weather, inclination, and his condition of ebriety dictated, and
left it in an old boathouse at the South End, whence Black Charlie or
Island Billy fetched it, also as circumstances allowed. Sometimes, when
the hands were busy, or it was blowing a south-easter, we would be for
several weeks together without any mail; but that was not of much
consequence, since we could always telegraph from the pilot
station.</p>

<p>I went out to the yard to give Island Billy directions about this
same mail--which, by the way, owing to the festive occasion, Rame
forgot to bring--and, to my surprise, saw Mrs. Tillidge dressed in a
riding habit, with a bandbox slung on to the pommel of her saddle, in
the act of mounting Tillidge's own "lady's horse."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Tillidge," I said, faintly, "I didn't know that you were
going to Gundabine, too?"</p>

<p>"I am going to spend my Christmas with my papa and mamma on their
selection, Mrs. Ansdell," replied Mrs. Tillidge, with an air of sour
patronage; then she added, with more asperity, "As I hadn't undertaken
a general utility situation, I didn't suppose that I was to stand on
ceremony and ask permission."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!" I answered, vaguely. I was a little awed by the
intelligence that Mrs. Tillidge was the daughter of a Free Selector. I
wondered if he were an agricultural Selector or a bucolic Selector,
which last, as everybody knows, ranks next in the Australian social
system to the aristocratic squatter. I was relieved when Mrs. Tillidge,
with an ungracious inclination of her head, rode out of the yard and
waited outside while Tillidge fastened the straps of his swag in a
somewhat shamefaced manner. In truth, after the first shock, a sense of
wild exultation seized me. To have the Island all to myself for three
days without Mrs. Tillidge! To be able to scour, sweep, and poke about
the premises undeterred by the consciousness that Mrs. Tillidge was
gloating triumphantly over my humiliations! The prospect seemed at the
moment little short of perfect bliss. If only Island Billy were left
me--Black Charlie had departed to join his tribe--or if by the fortune
of Heaven there should be a blackgin anywhere close handy, why I might
revolutionise the island before Mrs. Tillidge came back.</p>

<p>"Island Billy," I called out, detaining him as the rest rode down
towards the stockyard, "suppose it budgery (good) blackgin sit down
close up humpey?" I said insinuatingly, in the queer vernacular which
intercourse with the Ubi blacks had made familiar to me.</p>

<p>"Baal (no) mine think it, missus," returned Island Billy,
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Island Billy," I went on persuasively, "what for you go spree to
Gundabine? What for you no stop and spree along a Island? Plenty mine
give you grog, tobacco, plum-pudding, dried apples, pickles, sardines";
and with a reckless disregard of all moral responsibility I piled up
the list of delicacies tempting to the aboriginal palate, and of which,
alas! I well knew the store was barren. Probably Island Billy knew it
too. Anyhow, he shook his head, uttering a gruff "Baal, missus," at
each pause that I made. At last, evidently visited by some faint qualms
of remorse at leaving me alone to my fate, he remonstrated with me upon
not having brought a "white Mary" across from Gundabine to cook. "I
believe, baal, that fellow come back," he announced darkly, waving his
arm in the direction of Mrs. Tillidge; and then he went on to explain
that he himself was under solemn obligations to go over to the
mainland. "You see, missus," he said, his bright black eyes growing
bigger and more glassy, and the tattoo weals standing out on his ebony
face as he pulled down his lower jaw after the manner of a black when
he alludes to "Debil-debil"--"My word that fellow brother belonging to
me corbon coolla (very angry). Altogether black fellow coolla. Suppose
me baal go corroboree close-up Gundabine where black fellow camp, I
believe that fellow pialla (entreat) Debil-debil and make me bong
(dead)," which, being interpreted, means that Island Billy would incur
the wrath of his tribe if he did not join their war-dance, and that
they would probably pray to the Debil-debil to kill him.</p>

<p>There was no standing out against Debil-debil, and I desisted from
my arguments. Island Billy stuck his heels into his horse's sides, and,
with the odd guttural "J-ch-k," which the black makes when he is
starting off, began to gallop down the hill. But an inspiration seemed
to strike him, and he pulled up and wheeled round, saying, in a
consolatory manner, "I believe old St. Helena"--pronounced
Sentilena--"sit down along a Narrows. Budgery gin Sentilena. Plenty
that fetch crab. Mine look out Sentilena"; and uttering another hoarse
cry, he darted away again, and disappeared over the crest of the
hill.</p>

<p>Alec was not coming home until the next day. Thus there was not a
soul on the head station but myself, and I own that my first anxiety
was to ascertain that I could make fast the doors of my bedroom when
night came. Not that I was really frightened. I had been brought up in
the bush, and was accustomed to its loneliness; and, besides, I knew
that in settled districts, where bushrangers do not prowl, there is
nothing to be alarmed at. Still it was a relief to find that the
carpenters had put inside bolts to the French windows.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe all the mighty works that I did that
day--how, emulating Loftus's energy, I carried buckets of water into my
bedroom, and scoured and mopped the floor; how I disinterred a piece of
chintz from the depths of one of my trunks and manufactured a draped
dressing-table out of it and this same trunk; how I tidied the pantry,
and rummaged about the kitchen, and began my mission among the poultry,
and did a little laundry work on my own account; and finally went to
bed, to sleep the sound, sweet sleep of fatigue. But not for long. I
awoke with a start, and sat up in bed, feeling a sensation of alarm.
The ground seemed to tremble beneath me. Something was knocking
violently against the wooden floor of my room. Above the roar of the
mosquitoes there was a tinkling of cracked bells, and a sound of
melancholy bleating. What had happened? I got up and looked out, for as
long a time as the dense buzzing, pricking crowd in which I was
enveloped would allow. It was bright starlight. The Southern Cross was
sinking. I saw the vast dark forest stretched out before me, with the
few gaunt, skeleton gum trees standing like sentinels on the bald patch
close to the house. There were two or three white unshapen forms lying
beneath the gums; and then I remembered the flock of goats, and that it
was Island Billy's duty to drive them each night into their fold. They
had taken refuge under the house to-night, and it was their horns
beating up against the boards and the bells they wore round their necks
which had aroused me from my dreamless slumber. I did not sleep any
more that night, but drew aside the blinds and waited and watched the
dawn creep slowly up over the Narrows. Gradually the darkness
lightened. The blackness of the forest became a soft smoky-grey, and
Mount Akobaora in the distance defined itself more and more clearly
against the sky. Then there stole along the eastern horizon a wonderful
pink glow, which grew and deepened till it reached the mountain. It
tinged the folds of vapour rolling back from the Narrows, and came
gliding on over the blue-grey tops of the gum trees, till they too
melted into the exquisite rosy flush. It was very beautiful. Many a
time afterwards that view helped to console me for the discomforts of
Island life.</p>

<p>The animals and feathered creatures in my kingdom greeted me that
morning as if in sympathetic endeavour to atone for Mrs. Tillidge's
desertion. The crows and parrots seemed to caw and chatter louder than
usual. The lean, scared-looking Spanish hens came with evidently
friendly intention and pecked the corn I threw them; the goats browsed
sociably close to the kitchen--ill-kempt, scraggy quadrupeds, with
running eyes and sores on their bodies, where the mosquitoes and
marsh--flies had bitten them. They bleated plaintively when I called to
them, and scampered a little way, then looked back as if in doubt
whether to accept my overtures. All the dogs were on the causeway. Rose
brought her puppies in, one by one, and laid them down upon the kitchen
floor, gazing at me with her great pathetic eyes, and drumming with her
tail while I raked out the open fireplace and set the kettle on to
boil. I was eating a meagre breakfast at the kitchen table, and
ruefully contemplating the remains of Mrs. Tillidge's last
three-cornered loaf, when a shrill whining voice called outside--</p>

<p>"White Mary, missus!"--and then there was a strange discordant,
monotonous shriek--"Ya-ah woo--ra! Corbon, me sick. Corbon, me old.
Ba--al husband belonging to me. Budgery eli. Yah! Ya--ah!
Sentile-na!"</p>

<p>There was a clatter, and five or six great slimy crabs, or "eli," as
Sentilena called them, crawled out of a dilly-bag, which had been
thrown in at the door, and which was immediately followed by Sentilena
herself.</p>

<p>Sentilena was very old; she looked as if she might be a hundred. She
was shrivelled and emaciated; her hair was snow-white, and her
complexion was two or three shades lighter in ground tint than that of
the generality of blacks, for she was a half-caste. She had the most
hideous face possible to conceive, covered with a lattice-pattern of
blue weals and tattoo marks. She was blind of one eye, and had lost
half an arm. A ragged red blanket was slung over one shoulder. She
stretched out her remaining arm, bony and corrugated like her face and
breast, while she went on howling, "Woo-ra! Woo-ra! Baal, me catch
possum. Poor fellow me! Missus, gib ole Sentilena breakfast. Corbon,
Sentilena hungry."</p>

<p>I handed her a piece of bread, and poured some tea for her into a
pint pot. When she had eaten and refreshed herself, she chased the
crabs, which were crawling about the kitchen, greatly to the discomfort
of Rose and her puppies, penned them into a corner, and offered to make
a fire outside and boil them if I would give her some "chimbacco."
Sentilena's services were not to be despised. She put the crabs down to
boil; then I made her clean the frying-pan. Afterwards we chopped some
wood between us; and then, while I baked a batch of soda bread, which I
am bound to confess turned out a failure, Sentilena squatted in the
doorway and enlivened my labours by the recital of her friendly
relations with various former owners of the Island. Her reminiscences
were somewhat of the nature of chroniques scandaleuses, for Sentilena's
career, as I learned, had had its romantic, not to say tragic
episodes.</p>

<p>Sentilena had once been young and beautiful. In the days of the
first settlers on the Island she had reigned a dusky Helen at the head
station. She had lost her eye from the cut of a tomahawk inflicted by
her third husband, King Tommy, from whom the white man had beguiled
her. Then she broke with her tribe, and now she lived alone in fallen
majesty. She had the reputation of an Atalanta-like fleetness, and when
her charms failed her, and she ceased to find favour in the sight of
master or stockman, she took a contract to run the mail to the
mainland, swimming the Narrows, and never once failing in her
engagement. But a shark bit off her hand, and she swam the Narrows no
more. Now all her powers of running had gone from her.</p>

<p>"No good, Sentilena!" she whined, rocking herself to and fro, and
striking her scarred old breast with a gesture of desolation. "Plenty
soon bong Sentilena!"</p>

<p>Alec's "Coo--ee" sounded cheerfully at dusk as he came within sight
of the station. He was very wrath when he heard of Mrs. Tillidge's
departure.</p>

<p>"Let her rip!" he cried, flourishing a blue telegraph form before my
eyes. "Here's good news for Christmas. The governor has turned up
trumps. Loftus is a brick! Mrs. Tillidge may boss Tillidge into doing
what she pleases, but she shan't boss us any longer. It won't matter
now if we do muster a hundred head short of the mob we counted on. I'll
get all the beasts we have collected over the Narrows next moon; so
cheer up, old girl, and don't knuckle under any more to Mrs. Tillidge.
Just you read that."</p>

<p>Sure enough, on that stiff blue paper was inscribed what seemed to
me the fairy legend that a certain solid sum would shortly be lodged to
Alec's credit in our Sydney bank. By what telegraphic magic had Loftus
worked this miracle? We felt certain that it was his doing, but how? We
could not conjecture then. Afterwards we learned that Loftus had, as I
suspected, enriched the treasury of the North End telegraph station to
the extent of some seven pounds, and had wired that it was a case of
ruin and death, and that if the paternal coffers were kept closed, he
himself would advance us the necessary sum.</p>

<p>Alec and I dined joyfully on cold crab, and did not have bad dreams
or indigestion. It blew a hurricane that Christmas Eve--one of Rame's
south-easterly bursters; but it was a glad and welcome hurricane, for
Christmas morning rose cool and clear, and the mosquitoes, driven by
the wind, settled in a thick black velvety patch in the remotest
westerly corner of the most sheltered verandah room. It was our first
married Christmas, and how Alec and I laughed as he went out to drive
in the milkers, and I accompanied him as far as the wood heap to gather
sticks for the fire, greatly exercised in my mind as to our Christmas
fare! Our commissariat was low. Pending the slaughter of a bullock on
the men's return, there was only one tiny piece of beef as hard as a
bullet in the meat cask. The bread, too, had run out; and though I
could make fairly good scones with thick milk and carbonate of
soda--what the Americans call saleratus bread--the baking of them in a
camp oven was for me no easy matter. I began to understand why Mrs.
Tillidge's bread was so heavy, and why it was always burnt black at the
bottom, while it remained dough on the top. The camp oven was a round
pan with a lid, standing on three legs, heated by a fire on the ground
underneath, and another fire on the lid, and as the lid had to be
lifted very often in order that one might ascertain how the baking was
getting on, and as, in so doing, the top fire always tumbled off--to
say nothing of the risk of letting it fall in upon the dough--it will
be seen that our daily bread was a luxury not to be had without some
trouble.</p>

<p>Our Christmas dinner was not exactly a sumptuous repast. I tried to
make rissoles out of the salt junk, but the fat in the frying-pan
caught fire, and the result was not appetizing. It ended in our dining
off cold crab again, supplemented by a couple of eggs which the lean
Spanish hens had been so obliging as to lay in the aloe. I never knew
such uncomfortable hens. They obstinately refused to enter the downy
nest made for them and baited every day with Indian corn, but persisted
in laying under the bunghole of the bath or in the aloe. Each morning
Sentilena brought a fresh dillyful of live crabs, and always emptied it
at the kitchen door, so that we had an exciting chase after the crabs,
some of which got away altogether, and came to a lingering end among
the grass tussocks. In fact, we lived mostly upon crabs during that
Christmas week when Alec and Sentilena and I kept house together.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI. The Island Mail.</h3>

<p>CONTRARY to Island Billy's predictions, Mrs. Tillidge did come back;
but before she had been many days upon the Island the long-sealed
phials of Alec's wrath burst upon her, and one morning he came in,
looking very pale and determined, to tell me that he had given Mrs.
Tillidge her choice of moving into the empty hut near the stockyard or
of going to Gundabine that very day. In any case, it was settled that
she was to clear out of the kitchen. Alec told me that she had tried to
"boss" Tillidge into throwing up the situation, but that Tillidge, with
more firmness than might have been expected of him, had declined to be
"bossed," and had assured Alec that he meant to see the cattle across
the Narrows. Alec insisted that under this condition of affairs I must
go back to Sykes's and wait there until he had got the capable "married
couple," of whose curries and creams, vegetables, poultry, punctuality,
and civility we dreamed in our sanguine moments. The tide would serve
about mid-day. Weare--a bush carpenter who had come over from Gundabine
to finish a new calf-pen in the stockyard--knew how to handle the boat
which, with Alec himself and Brown, the second stockman, would be
sufficiently manned; and, though it was blowing a head wind now, and
Weare shook his head and prophesied a regular south-easter before
nightfall, Alec was convinced that we could get to Gundabine in one
tide, and that, as a south-easter always blew for forty--eight hours,
we had better try and get across before it was at its worst. So after
an early lunch, for which we foraged resolutely ourselves, Alec and I
rode down to the landing, Weare and Brown having gone on ahead to bail
out the boat and make her ready for the start. At the last moment Mrs.
Tillidge gave us to understand that she considered the discomforts of
the hut preferable to even so short a voyage in my company, and I had
the ignominious feeling that I had been forced to beat a retreat. Could
Alec have been induced to consent, I would gladly have taken possession
of the kitchen, with Island Billy and Sentilena as subordinates.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we glided out of the little creek into the middle
of the Narrows, there was comfort in the thought that mosquitoes and
sandflies were for the time left behind. The tide, now at its full,
lapped the waxen branches of the mangroves, which lay like tiny green
islands a little distance from the shore. The strait was gently heaving
and rippling, its waters a clear and intense blue. The sky was blue,
and the sun shone brightly, but the southern horizon had a lowering
look, and there were smoke-like clouds scudding fast to the north-west.
It would have been overpoweringly hot but for the flying clouds that
every now and then veiled the sun, and the breeze which blew up freshly
from Gundabine Bay--nothing much now, but swelling with every mile we
made.</p>

<p>The wind was too far ahead for sailing, and we had before us the
prospect of a twenty miles' row. The men chatted cheerily at first, but
after awhile, when pulling became harder work, relapsed into meditative
silence. As the afternoon waned and the Narrows widened, the wind
freshened steadily. The sea became almost indigo-blue. Great ridges of
waves faintly whitened came rolling towards us, angrily buffeting the
boat, which raised herself laboriously over them. Every now and then a
fierce surge would spit out foam and send its spray sharply upon our
faces, and upon the backs of the men rowing. We were keeping under the
lee of the Island. Currents and mudbanks did not allow a boat to cross
high up the Narrows, as would have seemed the natural proceeding, for
thus we should have skirted the mainland, and would have avoided the
rough and often dangerous passage across Gundabine Bay, which was in
reality the open sea at the mouth of the harbour. By-and-by we could
see it stretching out close before us, a dark, turbulent waste seething
and tossing with white moony patches leaping up in points of milky
light and melting into leaden greyness, where they touched the vaporous
sky, when the horizon closed in, and the sea was merged in gathering
dusk. The mainland on our right was getting farther and farther. One
felt something of consternation in watching its receding outlines grow
greyer and more indistinct. The sun had set. Great brassy-red streaks
splashed the swelling body of dun cloud, and shed a savage lurid glow
on the black weltering waters. The tide had turned. We had passed the
b&ecirc;che--de-mer fishery and the deserted Chinamen's huts. It seemed
hours while we rounded a point of low-lying treacherous rocks over
which the breakers swirled and hissed. The boat seemed to struggle
sullenly against the seas which struck her bows, and lifted them
dripping out of the water, causing a sort of recoil in her, and making
her start like a live thing, so that a frightened sort of tremor went
all through her frame.</p>

<p>I love that shock and thrill with which a ship in a storm meets the
giant force of the sea, leaping up as if in frenzy, and lunging through
the great green mountains, then swooping down into the valley, closed
in by glassy precipices, and plunging headlong forward, to mount
triumphantly once more.</p>

<p>But in an open boat, on a dark night, upon a rough sea, one feels
nothing of this excitement and exultation. There is only the sense of
powerlessness, loneliness, and desolation. It makes one think of a soul
let loose in space. I have a vivid remembrance of that scene--the
deepening night, starless, with a thin, wet moon and rushing murky
clouds, from out which at intervals the pallid light would stream
forth, and as suddenly go in again, as if the orb were diving in an
upper ocean. I can see the dark outline of the boat slant-wise, as she
heaved and bounded, the black fork now swept by misty spray, while the
steely white-topped waves and the inky hollows went rushing by. It
seemed as though sea and sky were racing. I can see the men in their
wet clinging shirts, Weare, broad and brawny, the muscles of his arms
and shoulders showing; Brown, sinewy and lanky--the stockrider's
build--both straining doggedly over the oars; and Alec squarely
gripping the tiller, keeping it straight and rigid, while our bows met
full the blow of each advancing surge that hurled itself upon us, and
for the moment hid sea and sky. As it came one saw nothing but the
curved crystalline ebon wall, luminous here and there with
phosphorescent gleams, and the coiling wreath of foam which, cut by our
stem, would part asunder with a crash, slinging the spume-like shot
against us, and scattering opalescent whiteness upon the gloom around.
Then, as we heaved upward, the lamps of Gundabine far off on our
starboard side would quiver like spectral candles for a second, and go
out as we sank again into the trough.</p>

<p>As the boat fell off from the sea, the tops of the waves washed on
board her, drenching us through.</p>

<p>"We can't do it, sir," said Weare. "We must get her bows round, and
put into the South End bight."</p>

<p>Watching his time, when the next black hill had come and dissolved
beneath us, Alec wrenched the tiller hard over. "Pull," he shouted. The
men were bent double. The boat groaned and trembled. As she swung round
a wave dashed up and caught us on our beam, half filling her, and
making its cold stickiness felt to our skins. Before another wave could
strike us we had turned. The dark configuration of the Island spread an
indefinite mass in front of us. Instead of wrestling with the sea the
boat now seemed to fly before it, darting up on the crest of a surge
and leaping down as if in a wild effort to escape from the oncoming
wave behind. This only lasted for a minute or so. We had no sooner got
under the lee of the South End Cape than, apparently by a miracle, we
were in smooth water. Presently our keel grated upon shingle. Weare and
Brown jumped out and hauled up the boat through the surf, and Alec
lifted me out on to the Island again.</p>

<p>We were very like shipwrecked people, soaked hrough, hungry, and
forlorn. The shore seemed bleak and inhospitable--a curving strip of
stony beach with black rocks, against which the breakers roared,
jutting out at each end, and a few thin scant-leaved mangroves, unhappy
out of their native mud, sheltering a rough log boat-shed that ran down
almost to the water's edge. Behind rose the grey-brown dunes of the
Island, and close to the shore was a ragged brigalow scrub. In the
faint moonlight we could see the black shadows of the trees upon the
rank grass, and we could hear the howl of the native dogs blending with
the rumble of the surf and the peal of the wind.</p>

<p>We took shelter in the boat-shed, and Alec and the men collected
sticks and dead branches, and made a fire on the gravelled floor. We
tried to toast a few wet sandwiches we had brought with us, and
bemoaned our want of forethought in not providing ourselves ourselves
with tea, and a billy in which to boil some water. The night wore on,
and I fell into an uneasy sleep, with my head upon a log. It must have
been near morning when I was awakened by a gruff "Coo-ee," the swash of
oars, and the crunching of a boat on the beach. Then came a volley of
oaths, and a leather mail-bag was pitched unceremoniously into the
shed, and fell, scattering the embers of our fire.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Rame?" called Alec, still half asleep.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, and a d----d rough time of it I've had," shouted Rame;
"and a hell of a row there'll be when I get back, for the steamer's
signalled and I'm wanted at Bell's wharf." As he bailed his boat, Rame
poured forth a torrent of half-tipsy profanity, directed at the folks
that lived on an island and expected to have a mail contract kept with
a south--easter blowing. He cursed the wind, he cursed the sea; it was
a sort of reversed song of the Three Children, for he seemed to curse
all things in heaven and earth, and never ceased, notwithstanding
Weare's stern injunction to hold his jaw if he couldn't sweeten it, for
ladies were present. Rame made off at last, delivering a Parthian-like
charge and a general notice that he wasn't going to risk his life in
Gundabine Bay, and the loss of his job ashore for the sake of any more
anathematised Island mail-bags. Weare observed apologetically that
Gundabine was a place that got most chaps into a way of liquoring up
and cussin', and that it wanted a deal of character in a man to stand
agin it. Alec cut open the mail-bag, which was heavy with the delayed
Christmas literature, and then Weare brought in some dry sticks and
made a blaze, by the sputtering light of which we read our letters and
looked at our Christmas cards. One of Alec's letters--he explained that
it was from a Stonehampton pal--seemed to rouse in him no little
interest. "By Jove!" he cried, "Lyndon is cleared all right. Well, I am
glad of that." He looked at me alertly, as if he were eager to
communicate some pleasing piece of intelligence, and had begun, "You
remember my telling you about Tom Lyndon, Rachel," then stopped,
checked by the presence of Weare and Brown. He waited till the men had
gone out. "What do you think?" he said; "those vouchers have been
found, and the missing money has been accounted for. It was a case of
sheer muddle and negligence on the part of one of the subordinates. I
always said that the Government jumped at conclusions without taking
any pains to have the matter investigated, and that it would come
straight when they went out of office. Anyhow, Tom Lyndon is cleared,
and the new Minister has put him back on to the Stonehampton and Balloo
Railway."</p>

<p>I was as much pleased as Alec, though I had never seen Tom Lyndon,
and did not know all the ins and outs of the affair. It had never been
actually made public, and little scandals and peculations in Government
offices up North were, alas! not of such infrequent occurrence as to
occasion a violent stir when they did happen. Tom Lyndon was a
handsome, clever young Government official, whom the Ministry of
Progress had put in charge of a branch railway that was being
constructed between Stonehampton and a township up country. The
progressive Ministry went out, however, before the works were well
under weigh, and the new Ministry, whose rallying cry was retrenchment,
put a sudden stop to the railway, wound up accounts in a casual manner,
and dismissed young Lyndon with a small compensation. Ministries in
Leichartsland are rather apt to do things in a casual way, and official
responsibilities are perhaps not quite so clearly defined by
departmental limits as in the commonwealths of older civilizations. Tom
Lyndon left Stonehampton and went on private business to Singapore. It
was not till after he had gone that vouchers, representing certain
moneys for which he was responsible, were discovered to be missing. It
was at once assumed than Lyndon, instead of paying out these sums, had
himself made use of them, and this assumption was strengthened by the
fact that he had taken upon himself the payment of his father's debts.
He was the eldest son of a spendthrift superannuated Government
official, who, after living for a good many years on his sons'
earnings, had lately died, leaving them a legacy of liabilities.
Possibly the filial motive weighed with the Minister for Works.
Possibly he knew himself guilty of a scarcely official haste in
settling up the financial affairs of the unlucky railway. At any rate
the Government did not prosecute young Lyndon. He stayed away from the
colony--his name there, at least, under a cloud. His friends affirmed
his innocence, though they blamed him for his proud apathy in not
insisting upon having the charge disproved. His enemies declared him
guilty, and outsiders showed but a anguid interest in the whole matter,
which was gradually being forgotten, when, in accordance with the usual
vicissitudes of Leichardtstonian politics, the parsimonious Government
ended a brief and inglorious reign, the progressive one came back, and
in the general rout which followed, the Lyndon mystery was cleared up,
the missing money accounted for, and now Alec read out to me that Mr.
Lyndon had received a handsome apology, and was triumphantly reinstated
in his old appointment.</p>

<p>Alec had known Mr. Lyndon in Stonehampton, and had told me the first
part of the story more than a year ago, in the early days of our
engagement. I had wondered much concerning it, and lamented the blight
which had fallen upon a promising career, though then I had no
expectation of living near Stonehampton, or of being brought into any
sort of association with Mr. Lyndon. The story was connected somehow
with my own little drama, and it seemed strange to hear its sequel now,
under these adventurous conditions, in the lonely boat-shed on this
wild night. It seemed stranger still when Alec said thoughtfully--</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Lina Sabine has heard this, and if she is sorry
now that she didn't trust him and wait?"</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked eagerly, scenting a romance. "Were they in love with
each other?"</p>

<p>"He was in love with her," answered Alec; "and I think she was as
much in love with him as any one so shallow and emotional could be.
Yes, I believe she cared for him, but I'm afraid it wasn't in her to be
staunch."</p>

<p>If Alec knew any more, he did not seem inclined to betray
confidence. He said he didn't think it fair to rake up people's ashes,
and that Lina was one of those impressionable, many-sided, dramatic
people who can imagine themselves into any part they please, and that
when she married she had probably imagined herself into love with Mr.
Sabine and complete forgetfulness of former romantic episodes.</p>

<p>I was intensely interested in Lina Sabine--I always called her to
myself by her Christian name--though I had only seen her for a few
minutes one evening in the dim light of Mrs. Jarvis's verandah at
Gundabine. My interest was partly owing to a vague fancy that Alec had
once been in love with her, but principally because all that I knew and
heard of her wrought on me in a curious manner like a spell. There are
people who affect one in that way, even on the slightest acquaintance,
or, indeed, on none at all. And then I have a kind of theory that the
social system is kept working by certain magnetic currents which drive
the human atoms into combination, according to subtle laws of
attraction. Possibly in future enlightened ages these laws may regulate
our social relationships. I could not help fancying that Lina Sabine
and Mr. Lyndon and I had just got into one of these currents, and that
we were bound to be drawn together very shortly. Perhaps it has
something to do with what they call odic force. No doubt occultists
would give some sort of ready explanation of this and other mysteries.
I don't know how otherwise to account for many strange coincidences
such as have certainly come within the experience of most persons. One
hears a name mentioned casually which one has never heard before, and,
lo, it is as though a psychological chain had been forged, for all
manner of trivial incidents lead to a relation with that unknown person
till one becomes enmeshed in the very web of his or her personality.
Why should it be that person and no other? Why should it be that
particular incident and no other? Why should one choose to go to the
loft fork of the Y and not the right?</p>

<p>But as we sat watching the dawn spread over the sea and pale our
fire of dried leaves and twigs, I made Alec tell me all that he could
or would about Lina Sabine and her marriage. Everybody had been in love
with Lina Trass, Alec said, Lyndon among the rest. She had been the
show beauty of the North ever since she was sixteen. She had spent her
winters mostly in Stonehampton, though her people didn't belong exactly
to Stonehampton society. Her father kept a store on the road to the
diggings, and her mother had served in a shop; but Lina had been
educated at a boarding-school in Sydney, and, moreover, she was one of
Nature's ladies, "and just as pretty as you can make 'em," said Alec,
enthusiastically. It was not surprising that when she came to stay with
a married school-fellow at Stonehampton all the best people should take
her up, and should forget about her father the store-keeper, and the
mother the milliner's assistant. But, of course, it was an understood
thing that she must marry well, and Lina fulfilled her mission by
marrying Mr. Sabine some six months after the Lyndon episode. Mr.
Sabine, according to Alec, was a lout. He was bad-tempered and
boastful, he was unpopular with men. In every respect, except in birth
and money, he was Lina's inferior. When he first came to Gundabine
several years ago, everyone had laughed at him. He could not get a
woman to marry him. It was a joke in the district that he had proposed
to every good-looking barmaid and free selector's daughter, and that
all had refused him. But he went home to England for a year or two and
got polished up. He came out again with money, made a splash, and
finally struck gold close to Mount Akobaora, and then the matrons and
maids, instead of spurning, looked kindly on him--for, as Alec said,
human nature is much the same in Gundabine as it is in Belgravia--and
the end of it was, that he fell in love with Lina Trass, and married
her after a few weeks' engagement.</p>

<p>"I'd like you to be nice to Mrs. Sabine, Rachel, when you come
across her," Alec said. "We might get her over to the Island when the
mosquitoes have gone off a bit. Poor Lina! There are some people one
always associates the idea of tragedy with, somehow. Lina Sabine is
one, and old Daniel Liss is another.</p>

<p>"Who is old Daniel Liss?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you haven't come across him?--a queer miserly old
misanthrope--quite a character. He has stations along the coast, and he
was after the Island, but I bought it over his head. I almost wish Liss
had it now, Rachel," Alec added ruefully. "It's not the place a married
man should have gone in for."</p>

<p>I asked Alec if Mr. Liss had been in love with Mrs. Sabine too.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no," said Alec, laughing; "he never was in love with
any one, or if he was, he has managed to keep it dark. All the same,
Lina Trass had better have married Dan Liss, who never in his life
bounced man, woman, or child, than an ill-conditioned braggart like
Sabine."</p>

<p>Weare came to tell us that the boat was ready, and that we had
better be putting off. The wind had lulled, as it does in the early
hours, and Weare said that we should nip across in no time. The sea was
swelling and troublous still, and had a leaden, treacherous look. The
sun had not yet risen. The breeze when we got out blew keen and fresh,
and seemed to put new energy into our tired and aching bodies. Weare
set the sail, and we raced before the waves. There was something
deliciously exhilarating in the speed and the bounding motion of the
boat. A big steamer had just moored at Bell's wharf. It was the boat
from Leichardtstown. All was bustle. Goods were being landed. The
narrow pier was crowded with busy people and loafers. Newspapers were
being handed about. The police-magistrate was there, and the
telegraph-master and store-keepers, to say nothing of Sykes's crew. In
fact, all Gundabine seemed to have turned out, and I felt rather shy of
encountering the gaze of the township in my draggled and battered
condition. A row of faces peered down over the parapet of the pier as
Weare made the boat fast, and Captain Jarvis held out his hand to help
me up, saying, with a laugh, "Thought we should soon see you back
again, Mrs. Ansdell. Ain't the mosquitoes cannibals now?"</p>

<p>A great slouching giant of a man, with a heavy jaw, loose lips, big
dark eyes, and cantankerous expression, dressed in a well-made tweed
suit, that contrasted with the careless get-up of the bushmen round,
accosted Alec crossly: "I say, Ansdell, it is too bad of you people to
let yourselves be put upon. I want you to stand in with me, and make a
row with the A.S.N. Co. I'm not going to let these captains cheek me.
Here am I getting tons of stuff up by them every week, and they can't
put in at Cooranga to oblige me. The fact is, they are so accustomed to
roughs, they don't know how to treat a gentleman. What do I care about
that fellow Lyndon, or whether he catches the Colonial Secretary at
Stonehampton? Why should my business give way to his? I shall bring an
action against the Company, and force them to pay me my expenses for
going back overland to Cooranga from Stonehampton."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that Lyndon is on board?" cried Alec. "By
George, I must see him--only got my mail an hour or two ago. Tell you
what, Sabine, I'll join in bringing an action against Sykes, for
letting Rame get drunk and forgetting my mail. Good-day to you, Sabine.
Look here, Rachel, I'll just settle you in at Sykes's, and then come
back to the steamer"; and he hurried me off.</p>

<p>"That was Sabine," he said, as we turned in between the papaw trees
at the hotel. "I wonder if his wife's here. He is always wanting to
make a row about something."</p>

<p>I felt quite a thrill of excitement. There were dramatic
possibilities even in Gundabine. Wasn't this just one of the
coincidences that give ground for my theory of magnetic currents and
attractions? But I was too tired and hungry and sticky with salt water
to indulge in philosophical reflections just then. Alec ordered me some
hot coffee, and saw me with my damp portmanteau into a bedroom that
opened on to the upstairs parlour. I was sitting there a little later,
refreshed by my toilet, once more presentable, and enjoying the
unwonted luxury of a moderately civilized breakfast, when the door
opened and Mrs. Sabine came in. She said, "How do you do?" to me, in a
nervous, hurried manner. "I heard of your coming over this morning,"
she said. "There's only this one sitting-room. You don't mind my being
here too? My husband has to go on to Cooranga, and I--I couldn't stop
by myself--I had to come along here."</p>

<p>Of course I told her how glad I was of her company, and how pleased
at the opportunity of seeing something of her. "The steamer is in," she
said suddenly. "I suppose you don't know. .... It isn't gone yet?
There's always a great fuss here when the steamer comes in. It's the
only excitement they've got here, except sampling. Do you know what
sampling means?"</p>

<p>I confessed my ignorance. "Stonehampton is a better place to
'sample' in than Gundabine," she said. "The street is longer and there
are more public-houses. Sampling means starting at one end of the
street and taking a nip at each inn or handy private house all the way
down. They seem to sample a good deal here, beginning at the Captain's
at the top of the hill," and she laughed a little hysterically, and
went restlessly to the window and back again. All the time that we
talked generalities I could see that her attention was straying. I
could not turn my eyes from her, she was so pretty. I had not seen Miss
Ellen Terry in those days, but I have since often thought that Lina
Sabine as she was then bore a great resemblance to her. Lina had
something of the same sweet sensitiveness and grace of gesture. Her
face seemed all exquisite shadows melting into each other. There was a
touch of emotion in everything she said or did. She had a little
tremulous way of clasping and unclasping her hands as she talked, and
an appealing, surprised expression in her large eyes, which were as
blue as lobelia flowers. She was much more than pretty. She had what
the French mean by charm.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of noise in the bar below, where "sampling"
must have been going on pretty freely. Distant tones floated up too
from the pier. I thought I could recognise Mr. Sabine's rasping voice,
which at its best must have been disagreeable to hear. In my mind I
pitied the woman who had to live with that voice. We stood in the
balcony and looked out. We could see the tops of the steamer's funnels,
and a trail of smoke rising from them. The verandah of the post-office
opposite was almost as crowded as the verandah of Sykes's beneath us. I
noticed that Mrs. Sabine sheltered herself behind the screen of passion
creepers, and that her delicate flush deepened into two vivid red
patches as she gazed intently outward. Suddenly her face became quite
pale, and, following the direction of her eyes, I saw that they rested
upon a group of gentlemen walking up from Bell's shanty--my husband,
Captain Jarvis, Mr. Sabine, and one or two others. among whom I noticed
a tall, dark, good-looking man with whom Alec was talking, and whom I
guessed at once to be Mr. Lyndon. They were making straight for
Sykes's. I heard Alec say as they stepped on to the verandah, "No, I
can't stand that rowdy place. Come up to the sitting-room, Lyndon, and
have a parting drink for good luck--coffee, if you like, with a 'stick'
in it. I want to introduce you to my wife."</p>

<p>Lina Sabine turned abruptly and gazed at me with the wild look of a
creature that finds itself entrapped. She put out her hand impulsively
and clutched my wrist, drawing me back to the parlour. The footsteps
and voices sounded distinctly in the passage below. Her grasp
tightened. She was trembling like a frightened child. As our eyes met
straightly, I knew that there were to be no flimsy conventionalities
between us. Her eyes said that she meant to trust me, and that she was
appealing to me for sympathy and help, and my heart went out to her as
woman's heart will go out to woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do? They mustn't see me. You don't know. I
couldn't see him like this. Mrs. Ansdell, what can I do? My room is
ever so far away; and I can't see them."</p>

<p>"My dear," I exclaimed, "it is very easy. Come into my room." I led
her within and locked the door. I had hardly done so when the men came
into the parlour. The partition was of wood, and we could hear every
sound. Lina and I stood close together, not speaking. Her hand still
clasped my wrist. When I moved it tightened as if to enforce silence;
and when Alec tapped softly at the door and called "Rachel," she turned
on me in a fierce, scared way, and made an imperative gesture
forbidding me to answer.</p>

<p>We heard Alec apologise for my absence, and tell the tale of our
adventures, adding that I was probably sleeping after my wakeful and
exciting night. "Better luck in Stonehampton, Lyndon," he said. "I am
going to bring Mrs. Ansdell up, and I suppose you'll be there, off and
on, till the railway is finished."</p>

<p>"I hope that I may make Mrs. Ansdell's acquaintance somehow, but I
shall be camping at the Works all the time, and Stonehampton won't see
much of me," answered a very pleasant voice with, I thought, something
of bitterness and melancholy in its cadence.</p>

<p>I felt a shiver run through Lina's frame as she heard the voice of
the man she loved--oh, I was sure that she loved him. She stood very
still, bending a little forward, as if every nerve were straining. Her
grasp upon me may have caused some electric thrill of sympathy to pass
from one to the other. I seemed to know that every word Lyndon uttered
was like a knife-stab to her. The grating of her husband's tones must
have been even keener torture. Mr. Sabine still harped wrathfully upon
his grievances against the A. S. N. Company, but in rather a more
conciliatory manner, as if he had discovered that Mr. Lyndon was a
person of some importance, and not to be ridden over roughshod. I was
certain that Mr. Sabine was a bully. Mr. Lyndon's answers dropped as
politely and coldly as ice-water. Did Mr. Sabine realize the position
of affairs? Had he the least idea that his wife and Lyndon had once
loved each other? Apparently not. He said something about fetching Mrs.
Sabine and having his valise taken down to the steamer, and went out of
the parlour. We could hear Alec and Mr. Lyndon talking to each other.
Alec congratulated him on his reappointment, and Mr. Lyndon answered
drearily--</p>

<p>"The Government thought they were bound to do something for me,
though they need not have bothered themselves. I wish they had put me
anywhere else but in Stonehampton. I hate the place, and the whole
thing. It's rather like the triumphant return of the persecuted hero in
the melodrama, isn't it?--only there's no villain in this piece. In the
melodrama the wronged hero always comes back to marry his true and
faithful love, the also persecuted and virtuous heroine, and that's not
in this play either. I suppose," he added with an abrupt laugh, "a good
many nasty reasons were found for my keeping out of the colony?"</p>

<p>"Well, I almost wonder you didn't come back and fight it out," said
Alec.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should if I had been guilty. The truth is, that I didn't
care. What satisfaction would there have been in throwing up a good
billet at Singapore to come back here and defend myself against the
braying of contemptible asses? There was one person who I thought would
have believed in me; whose faith I wouldn't have insulted by writing a
line of denial. When that person doubted--well, one didn't trouble
oneself about the rest."</p>

<p>Lina made no movement while he was speaking, only a deep, long
indrawing of her breath, as a woman does when in great pain. Then she
seemed to become suddenly nerveless; her hand dropped from my arm. She
sank noiselessly upon the bed, and sat limp and huddled up, her face
only tense and strained, the eyebrows drawn together, the lips parted,
the blue eyes wide. There was something very dramatic in the whole
situation--the unconsciousness of the man, the agony of the
woman--nothing but that thin wooden wall, and the tragedy of a ruined
faith between them--the commonplace sounds and incidents as the waiter
brought in coffee and cognac, and Alec joked about the "stick"--which
is Australian for a petit verre--at that early hour in the morning. Mr.
Sabine, who had come back, did not see that it was a joke, and
resentfully maintained the benefit to be derived from a dose of rum and
milk before breakfast. Mr. Sabine's fractiousness was allayed somewhat
by the mention of races which were to be held at a bush-place near
Stonehampton, and for which he wanted to get up a Corinthian with
gentleman riders. He had a racer about whose speed he bragged loudly.
Then the warning bell rang on the steamer, and Mr. Sabine began to fuss
and to grumble that he could find his wife nowhere. All the time Lina
sat perfectly motionless and indifferent to what he was saying, as
though she had got past the stage of caring for that.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll keep your wife in better order than I can mine, when
you've got a wife, Lyndon," said Mr. Sabine, with noisy familiarity. "I
don't know where Mrs. Sabine has got to--gadding up to the Judge's, or
gossiping over with Mrs. Jarvis, I suppose. Anyhow, I can't hunt for
her. The steamer will be off presently. Are you fellows coming? Get
your wife to teach mine her duty. Ansdell." And he went out. We heard
him down below in the bar calling out something to Captain Jarvis, and
bidding Sykes look after Mrs. Sabine till he came back. Then the
steamer bell rang again loudly. Alec and Mr. Lyndon hurried off, too,
and Lina and I were alone. Chapter VII. Lina's Story.</p>

<p>I WAITED a little while for Lina to speak, but she sat still on the
foot of the bed, her eyes fixed on vacancy, her hands loosely clasping
her knees, never looking at me nor saying a word. I went up to her and
kissed her silently. "My dear," I said. I was not much older than Lina
in reality, but I felt then as if I had been her mother. She took no
notice of me for a minute or two, then said, in a harsh, quavering
voice, "Well--you heard, Mrs. Ansdell."</p>

<p>"Call me Rachel, Lina."</p>

<p>"Well, Rachel, you heard. I was the woman he counted on to believe
in him. I was the woman whose faith he wouldn't insult by writing to
tell her he wasn't a thief. Oh, why didn't he write? Why didn't he
write? Why did he believe in me?</p>

<p>"You didn't doubt him, Lina?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. I loved him, and yet I thought it might be true--true
that he was a thief. I'm not a lady, you know. I didn't understand the
way gentlemen take these things. I was set on marrying a gentleman,
Rachel, you see--and I have married a gentleman! You mightn't think,
perhaps, that Mr. Sabine was an English gentleman; but it's true. It's
printed in the Baronetage of Great Britain. I heard it before he
proposed to me; and Milly Robinson, whom I stayed with in Stonehampton,
she read it too. And we talked over everything together--it never was
my way not to talk over things; and we settled that a man who was
falsely accused would have written at once to tell the girl he loved
that he was innocent. That was the way we argued. We didn't know,
either of us, that sometimes a gentleman is too proud to deny a base
charge--to the woman he loves."</p>

<p>"Lina," I said, "I don't quite understand; for if you were engaged
to Mr. Lyndon, surely he would have written."</p>

<p>Lina altered her position a little. She looked at me questioningly
for a moment, then away again.</p>

<p>"No? You don't know? Your husband didn't tell you about me?"</p>

<p>"Alec never told me any of your secrets, Mrs. Sabine."</p>

<p>"I like Alec Ansdell for that. I always liked him. I think it was
because he didn't make love to me." Oh, Alec!--my heart gave a little
bound. "But he must have known," Lina went on. "I wanted a letter taken
to--to Mr. Lyndon at the very last." Her voice lowered and quavered
again. "I was a little beside myself. I couldn't let him go, and not
make him understand that I--that there was a bond between us, and that
I meant to be true to it--I did mean to be true, then. I wrote, and
there was nobody I could trust with the letter but Alec Ansdell--I
trusted him."</p>

<p>I felt a glow at the thought that Alec had been true to poor Lina's
trust. That seemed to bring us two women very near together. I sat down
on the bed beside her, and stroked her hand, and told her all I felt;
and I asked her to try and look upon me as her sister, and confide in
me.</p>

<p>Lina turned on me the dreariest and most heart-rending look, and
then in her odd flighty way she laughed a harsh little laugh, and made
a sudden tragicomic gesture.</p>

<p>"'I'd rather be a toad and bay the moon, than keep a corner in the
thing I love for daws to peck at,'" she cried. "That's how Mr. Sandy
Macbean quoted Shakespeare when in a very tragic mood he proposed to
me. Did you ever meet Sandy Macbean--the man whose 'forte is tragedy'?
My forte is tragedy; but I will confide in you, Rachel, for all that,
and here's my heart to peck at."</p>

<p>Presently, in a broken, simple way, she told me her story. It was a
very common story--only that of a girl who had been educated above her
surroundings--a susceptible, artistic girl with a natural dramatic
capacity for making situations, and with a certain depth of feeling
below an outward shallowness and impressionability. "You wouldn't
believe how sensitive I am," the poor thing said, "though I have got no
'born call' to be sensitive, as they say about here. It is horrible.
Everything always jarred upon me. My father and mother and brothers and
sisters jar upon me. My husband jars upon me--though he is a
gentleman--my whole life is a jar. And it has always seemed to me so
wrong and so unjust. I have always felt that I was meant to be happy. I
was determined that I would make myself happy, and do what I wanted.
That was my undoing. I wanted to make Mr. Lyndon fall in love with me;
at first just because I saw that he didn't want to fall in love, and
had put his whole mind on other things. I did all I could to make him
fond of me, and I succeeded. But I was punished for it, Rachel. I fell
in love with him myself. And do you know what being in love with a man
is? It's giving him the right to torture you. He doesn't mean to do it;
but he does it all the same. Oh, I did love him! I have never in my
whole life loved any one like that. And yet"--again she laughed in that
miserable fashion--"I didn't love him well enough to believe he could
be honest." She was silent for a few moments, her gaze fixed drearily
on the wooden wall. "I'd give a great deal to take that year out of my
life," she exclaimed passionately. "Why aren't we allowed the power of
rubbing a sponge over bits of our slates? There's no good in
remembering. It doesn't make one better; it makes one worse. I haven't
even the poor satisfaction of thinking that he treated me badly," she
went on. "When his appointment was done away with, he would have gone
without saying a word--without telling me that he cared for me, or
getting any promise from me--he was very strong. But one night, the
very last, I made him tell me. He wouldn't take any promise. He
wouldn't let me speak, lest, he said, I should say something that it
might be better for me were left unsaid. He told me that he had made a
vow to himself not to think of love or marriage till his father's debts
were paid, and his mother and sisters provided for. He said that even
if there were no pressing duty he would not involve a girl in a long,
unsatisfactory engagement, or drag her into a poor marriage--he had
seen enough of that. And so he wouldn't even let me say that I cared
for him. He said that he had given himself two years for his task, and
that then if I was unmarried he would come to me. I saw that he was
struggling against himself. I saw that he didn't believe in me. ..."
Lina stopped and put her hands to her face for an instant, as if she
were shutting in something. "It was the very last night," she resumed,
almost in a whisper, "and we were alone in Milly Robinson's
verandah--oh, I can see it all now!--the little thin moon, and the
paddock with the holes where we went craw fishing, and the shrubs in
the garden. I can smell the stephanotis--it was all in bloom at the end
of the verandah--and the verbena that I was crumpling in my hands while
he talked, and I looked up at his side face, all stern and rigid. He
wouldn't look at me, not even when he said that he loved me. Oh, I
loathe and I love the scent of verbena--we've got a bush of it at
Akobaora." Her voice flamed out and sank once more. "He wouldn't let me
speak. He only took the bit of verbena from my hand and put it in his
breast, and he was gone, and I've never seen him since, till to-day. I
saw him, but he didn't see me." The despair in her tone was
poignant.</p>

<p>"But you wrote to him?" I urged.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wrote to him. I couldn't let him go like that. I wrote to
him. I said that I loved him, and that I would wait. I don't know what
I said. I grow hot sometimes when I think of it. I gave the letter to
Alec Ansdell, and he gave it to him just as the steamer was going. This
was his answer."</p>

<p>She held out her right hand. On the third finger was a guard ring,
with an Eastern arabesque pattern upon it. "He took that off his little
finger," she said, "and sent it to me. He told Alec to tell me that it
was his pledge. There was no time to write then; but I got a little
letter from him from Cape York, the only letter he ever wrote to me. He
said in it that though the ring pledged him, I was completely free. He
said he had learned my dear letter"--she dwelt pathetically on the
phrase--"by heart, and had kissed it and burned it, and that I must not
let him be a clog on my life, or turn away because of him from anyone I
thought I could love better--anyone who would make me happier. Well,
Rachel, that's all. In a month after he had gone it came out about the
defalcations. Everybody was against him, and he didn't write. I know I
am a weak, easily--persuaded girl. I must always fly before the wind.
The wind drove me from him. I wasn't strong enough to stand still and
face it. I'm not strong like him, in that kind of way. I am strong in
some ways, and I won't let myself be crushed now. I've got the sort of
nature, Rachel, that makes people commit suicide to be out of a
trouble. My love was a trouble to me, and I tried to kill it by
marrying Mr. Sabine."</p>

<p>There was a little silence between us. I did not know what to
say.</p>

<p>"I suppose you couldn't have done that," Lina said suddenly. "You
can't understand it. But you would if you'd been me. If you'd had to
live at Coolibah Flat, you'd have hated it just as I did. And you'd
have got tired of waiting and wondering and lying awake at night,
crying and aching here." She pressed her hand tragically upon her
bosom. "It's such a real pain that I often fancy there's something the
matter with my heart. No; you'd have said to yourself, 'I won't let my
life be spoiled. I'll get away from it all and forget.' It doesn't take
me long to forget. That's part of my disposition. I had almost
forgotten. And then, when I heard that he was in the steamer,
and--and--to see him and hear him speak like that--oh, it hurts. I
can't bear it. And they laugh; they're laughing outside and drinking!
and that's life--and we've got to bear it; and to laugh, too."</p>

<p>She had broken into sobs. She flung herself forward on the bed, and
lay, her head buried, her body shaking. I could only look on. There was
no use in trying to comfort her; and I felt that it was better the
storm should spend itself. After a few minutes it passed over. She
lifted herself like a lily that rises when it has been beaten down by
wind and rain. She pushed her pretty fair hair away from her face, and
wiped the wet from her drowned eyes, laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>"I have made a nice exhibition of myself, haven't I? Don't you
despise me? But you shall see that I have got some pride, though I am
not a lady. No, I know what you are going to say." She stopped me as I
began to protest against her estimate of herself. "It's quite true. I'm
not genuine mahogany. I'm only iron-bark grown at Coolibah, and
veneered at a Sydney manufactory of manners, don't you see? You needn't
think, though, that I'm going to make a fool of myself. I'm too proud
for that. I mean to forget. I mean to be happy. I mean to get my
money's worth out of life. We are going home, you know, as soon as Mr.
Sabine has settled his affairs. Then it will be easy to forget. So few
girls have the chance of marrying a rich man, and of being taken to
England--into a baronet's family."</p>

<p>She had got up, and was standing before the looking-glass, smoothing
her ruffled hair, and then dabbing her eyes with a wet handkerchief.
Presently she turned to me, making one of her pretty quick gestures,
and saying, with a kind of half-mournful, half-playful vivacity--</p>

<p>"Will you unlock the door for me and let me out now? I think we have
had enough of tragedy for one morning. I'm going to be gay, for a
change. I abolish the past--grim, grisly spectre, it may go and make
other people miserable. I'll not have it near me. Good-bye. You shall
rest, and I will go up to the Judge's and eat grapes."</p>

<p>I unlocked the door for her. I could not help kissing her as she
went out. She warmly returned the kiss.</p>

<p>"Now we have made a compact of friendship," she said; "and you won't
tell tales on me. I wish you'd soon ask me over to the Island. I don't
mind the mosquitoes, and I know how to efface myself when you and Alec
want to honeymoon."</p>

<p>She was an odd creature. Her moods puzzled me. Sometimes I wondered
what had been the meaning of this wild ebullition of feeling. It was
almost impossible to believe that it had been quite real when I heard
her talking brightly with Alec, laughingly recalling episodes of her
Stonehampton visits, and even composedly asking a question or two about
Mr. Lyndon. Alec said that she was a born actress, and had begun to
imagine herself into a new part. I suspected, however, that it might
mean something more than this, and gave her credit for repenting of her
hysterical outburst, and for an effort to prove herself capable of
self--control.</p>

<p>During the week we were together at Sykes's, she did not again speak
of her poor little love-story. Her mind seemed feverishly set upon
leaving Australia, and breaking all the links with her old life. She
was always talking of how they would sail immediately Mr. Sabine had
settled the affairs of his reef, and how she meant to enjoy herself in
England. She had evidently determined, as she phrased it, to get her
money's worth out of life. I admired her for her spirit. I pitied her
as one might pity a brave child, struggling against tears, and
determined not to show it had been beaten. I was touched inexpressibly
to see how the poor thing withered up when Mr. Sabine came back, and
how all her vivacity was quenched, under the influence of her husband's
quarrelsome, braggart manner. She had a certain sensitiveness, physical
as well as moral, which made her shrink away when he snubbed her, as
was a way of his less from unkindness than from desire to show his
importance. He was a bully, and never lost an opportunity of asserting
himself over his weaker brethren. Perhaps the Gundabinian tendency to
"sample," which was exemplified to a remarkable degree in Mr. Sabine,
contributed to intensify his fractiousness. He had his good points,
however; he was liberal with his money, and he very often did
good-natured things. I have known him in the midst of a cantankerous
disputation, in which he was doing his best to offend everybody, go out
and give three or four sovereigns to some man who came to him with a
pitiful tale about a sick wife; then he would come back, snap at his
own wife, and snarl at us all in his resentive, choleric fashion. He
liked to be king of his company, and would curry favour with the
selectors and storekeepers by introducing Lina to them. He was very
proud of her, and would trot her out for the admiration of his friends
as if she had been the chief attraction of a travelling show of which
he was the master. He would bid her wear this dress or that; would
decorate her with jewellery; would tell her to be amusing, and then, if
his mood changed, would contemptuously snuff out her small sallies by
advising her not to make a fool of herself. Certainly, but for the
incontrovertible testimony of Burke, no one would have imagined Mr.
Sabine to be a man of patrician descent. He took Lina back to Akobaora
before Alec would allow me to return to the Island. My exile, however,
was not a very long one. By good luck, a well-recommended "married
couple" in want of a situation turned up at Gundabine, and we engaged
them forthwith. Mrs. McGilray was a huge, ungainly Scotchwoman, so
tough and dry that when conscientiously putting before her the
inconveniences she might have to suffer on the Island, we did not think
it necessary to lay great stress upon the onslaughts of the mosquitoes.
Mrs. McGilray courageously expressed it as her opinion that all the
talk against the Island was nothing but a pack of havers, and what she
told us of her capabilities in the matter of pickled rounds of cream
cheeses, "singit head," and oatmeal cakes made our mouths water. I felt
that we should be safe with Mrs. McGilray; perhaps I had better say
here that, on the whole, she justified my confidence, and that
McGilray, a short, dapper man, with a perky, encouraging way of saying
after everything, "And why not, sir?" who had been a ship's carpenter,
and knew how to sail a boat as well as understanding the culture of
vegetables, would wipe from the Island the stigma of having no "odd-job
man."</p>

<p>Altogether things looked brighter. At full moon the big mob was
crossed to the mainland, and though Alec's graphic description of the
scene at the Narrows--of the heaving, tossing, roaring mass of cattle
urged into the sea by the cracking of stock-whips, the breaks away and
furious gallops into the bush, the excited horses with dripping sides
and reddened nostrils, spurred by their riders in and out the water,
plunging this way and that, and swimming up and down stream in pursuit
of some fugitive beast--made me sorry that I had not been there to see;
still I was rejoiced at the thought of finding the Island cleared of
"extra hands," free from the bustle of the muster, and, above all, quit
of Mrs. Tillidge.</p>

<p>The pilot schooner, freighted with our long-delayed furniture, all
the goods and chattels over which Loftus had made merry, took us and
our married couple up the Narrows; and, though when we reached the
landing the mosquitoes were as ferocious as ever, the new buggy was
waiting, and my second entry into my kingdom seemed far less
ignominious than the first.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII. The Great Fire.</h3>

<p>DOMESTIC affairs at the Island, which in the beginning were chaos,
resolved themselves before long into order, under the light and leading
of Mr. and Mrs. McGilray. Undoubtedly, Providence had had a finger in
the selection of this peerless "married couple." The McGilrays seemed
to combine all the virtues and to exhibit none of the vices which had
distinguished one or other of each "married couple" of my previous
experience. I could write an essay on Bush married couples--but I
forbear. Let the Tillidges suffice for one example; the McGilrays for
another. McGilray was the perfect type of a handy odd-job man; and, as
for Mrs. McGilray, I only wished that Loftus could make her
acquaintance. I felt sure that if anything could reconcile Loftus to
the thought of our fate on the Island, it would be Mrs. McGilray's way
of stewing salt junk. To her Brunton Stephens, the Australian poet,
might have addressed his panegyric upon his Chinee cook:--</p>

<pre>
"There was nothing in creation that he didn't put to use.
And the less he got to cook with, all the more he did produce;
All nature was his kitchen range, likewise his cookery book--
Neither Soyer nor Meg Dod could teach that knowing Chinee cook."
</pre>

<p>Alec and I sometimes consulted together in alarmed foreboding as to
whether there might not be some dark secret of the law behind Mrs.
McGilray's tragic contentment and incomparable rago&ucirc;ts, and
whether Alec, too, in his character of Justice of the Peace, might not
find himself moaning in the words of the narrator of the poem:--</p>

<p>"Oh, art, and taste, and piquancy, my happy board forsook.<br>
When I came the J.P. over my lamented Chinee cook."</p>

<p>After our return from Gundabine, our first aim was to put things to
rights at the head station, and to make ourselves comfortable. Now that
the big mob of cattle had crossed the Narrows, there was no need to
take much trouble about stockkeeping. Brown, the lanky Australian
youth, was kept on as being equal to all present emergencies, while
Alec wrote letters to agencies and cast about the district for a worthy
successor to Tillidge. The horses--most of them having sore backs and
girth-galls after the muster--were turned out to "spell" in the bush.
Island Billy was set to break in new milkers--so far, cream and butter
had been unknown luxuries, and the supply of milk not to be depended
upon. Weare, the carpenter, who had come back with us in the pilot
schooner, was taken off the stockyard job, and turned into the kitchen,
where he fixed up an open range, and built in a Colonial oven, welcome
indeed after our previous difficulties in the matter of baking. Alec
and McGilray began operations in the garden, cleaned out and remodelled
the meat--store and dairy, and whitewashed the fowl-house--certain
barn-door missionaries, comfortable clucking domestic speckled hens,
which we had bought in Gundabine, being turned out to preach morals and
manners among the lawless Spanish brood--while Mrs. McGilray and Black
Charlie mopped, swept, and scrubbed within doors. Mrs. McGilray put me
in mind of Loftus in her untiring energy, only she set to work in a
much more solemn and portentous manner than had been Loftus's wont. She
stalked about like a grim, gaunt destiny, five-foot-ten high, in
bird's--eye cotton, wearing a mushroom hat, to the brim of which a
frill of mosquito-netting was fastened and gathered in round her neck.
This was the only sign she gave of being troubled by the mosquitoes.
Perhaps they found her too tough a morsel to be pleasant eating, and
left her alone. At any rate, she made no complaint, and listened in
sublime contempt to McGilray's half-jocular, half-pathetic grumblings,
which floated across the yard to us in the office.</p>

<p>"I'm just put beside my understanding, Janet, for I'm thinking that
these beasties are the Lord's way of telling us that the blacks are no
more than the lost tribes of Israel turned up in Australia, and that we
are not treating them as we ought. I wouldn't mind so much if they'd
got the length of making bricks for the forge chimney," pursued
McGilray, ruminatively; "but if we're to be afflicted with the seven
plagues of Egypt, I'd rather they went on in the Bible order. I'd be
glad, for the sake of variety, to take a spell at frogs and
darkness."</p>

<p>Mrs. McGilray was a woman of heroic nature as well as of heroic
size. She had a genius for organization, and in a very short time had
accomplished wonders, apportioning to each of us the task best suited
to his or her strength and capacity. She even utilised old Sentilena,
who still hung about the place, brought up crabs, scared away hawks,
and looked, it seemed to me, a grotesque ghost of my courtship days,
for she had discarded the tattered red blanket for an old pink gown,
which I had worn when Alec proposed to me. It is true that, for
sentimental reasons, I had cherished this gown even though it was no
longer wearable; but as I was unpacking my trunks at the edge of the
verandah and shaking out the cockroaches from my clothes--they had got
in at Bell's warehouse--Sentilena sidled up insinuatingly to inspect
the finery, her one eye gleaming, her toothless jaws expanding in
aboriginal ejaculations of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>"Tsch! Tsch! My word! Budgery that, missus!" Then, some ancient
instinct of coquetry reviving, she snatched up the pink dress, slipped
it over her head, and holding it against her waist, executed a
corroboree "pas seul" on the grass. Finally, she declared that if I
would give her the gown, and a whole fig of tobacco, she would "sit
down one moon along a humpey, make altogether tin pot plenty clean, and
fetch up eli* every morning"; whereas if I refused, she would
immediately yan (go away) and--awful threat!--take Black Charlie with
her. I thought Sentilena's "eli" were worth buying--to say nothing of
Charlie, and the cleaning of the tin-pots, into which Mrs. McGilray had
as yet vainly tried to persuade her, so I threw sentiment to the wind,
and presented her with the sacred gown, which, I may remark, was, after
contact with Sentilena's person, redolent of other associations than
those of a hallowed past. It gave Alec quite a start and qualm, when he
came up from the yard, to see Sentilena, her hideous wealed face and
bony extremities protruding from this garment of romance, as she
squatted on the kitchen doorstep, her pipe in her mouth, filled as per
contract, surrounded by an array of greasy tin--dishes, soot-caked
frying-pans, and dirty saucepans, which Mrs. McGilray had collected
from various parts of the establishment, and had bidden her scrape
clean with a broken-bladed knife.</p>

<p>Before many days had passed we had greatly changed our mode of
living and the aspect of the house. The floors were spotless; canvas
lounges stood invitingly in the breezy south-east end of the verandah;
glass and china were ranged on the pantry shelves; snowy mosquito
curtains draped all the beds, and old boxes had been turned into
dressing--tables with muslin flounces. The terrible blue of the
sitting-room walls had been softened by engravings and wooden brackets;
the aggressive oilcloth was partly covered with rugs; flowered chintz
veiled the horse--hair sofa, and the pickings of Loftus's ducks had
stuffed cushions for the wooden arm-chairs. Our wedding presents were
set about on small tables of McGilray's manufacture, and dark blinds at
the French windows subdued the awful glare of the western sun. Christo,
the Angora goat, was banished from his quarters in the bath and penned
in the fold with the plebeian goats, and we found that, by
extemporising a screen and leaving open the bath-room door, we could
let in the south-east breeze without bad result to ourselves, and make
a draught that was decidedly unpleasant for the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>But now a wonderful event happened, which was as memorable in the
annals of the Island as the Hegira in those of the Caliphate. It was
scorching weather, even for February. There had not been a thunderstorm
for weeks. A burning sun had withered up every blade of grass; the
leaves of the gum-trees gave forth a peculiar dry rustle as a faint
wind stirred them. All day a terrible heat brooded and stilled every
sound of bird or insect life except the metallic whirring of the
cicadoe which reached the house from the wattle thicket on the ridge.
As one looked over the country to the ocean on one side, and to the
Narrows on the other, the low, wooded ridges showed a dull grey-brown
instead of the usual blue-green of the eucalyptus foliage. There were
fires on the mainland, and the outlines of Mount Akobaora loomed dimly
through the smoke. Every breath was as if it came from a furnace, and
the beasts on the near camps lolled with protruding tongues, and could
hardly be got away from the water-holes.</p>

<p>Alec was a little anxious, and watched the clouds eagerly for a sign
of rain. Island Billy was sent to scout, and to warn away any blacks
who might be camping near the fences, and whose fires might spread and
set light to the grass, which, in such weather as this, would burn like
tinder. Island Billy reported that, if there were any blacks, they must
be camped on the coast, and, unless a south-easterly gale sprang up,
there was not much fear of their doing damage. Alec congratulated
himself once more upon being the possessor of an island run, where
there were no boundaries to guard, and, having some important business
in Gundabine, set off one afternoon with Brown for the South End,
intending to cross that night in a skiff which we now kept in the
boathouse, and which made us independent of Rame and of head-winds in
the Narrows.</p>

<p>When I went to bed that night, the heat was still intense, the air
close and muggy, the horizon to the westward smoke-obscured, and the
mosquitoes swarming in myriads. Buckets of burning grass-tree were set
along the verandah, and in the sitting-room and my bed-room I had
lighted pans of Persian insect powder, the smoke of which had a
soporific effect on the mosquitoes, and though we ourselves suffered
from it as if we had been narcotised, this was preferable to the
attacks of our tormentors. About the small hours I was awakened from a
heavy sleep by the banging of the French windows as they crashed
backwards and forwards, the roaring of a gale round the exposed corner
of the house, and a strange flapping above my head, which I soon
discovered was caused by the canvas ceiling having been torn from its
fastenings by the wind penetrating beneath the caves, and having
partially fallen, so that it was blown to and fro in the most uncanny
manner. I got up, made fast the window as best I could, struck a light,
and looked at my watch. My heart stood still at the thought that at
about this time the tide would serve for Alec, and that unless deterred
by the gale--which I felt to be unlikely, for he was in a hurry to get
back--he would now be crossing that dangerous Gundabine Bay. I went
back to bed, and lay awake for a long time listening to the wind, and
haunted by the remembrance of that black, tossing sea, and the thought
of the little boat racing before the blast and pursued by those great
hungry, foam-tipped waves, that seemed to my excited memory like awful
monsters springing greedily towards their prey. I dozed off, but woke
again, shivering with dread and with fateful conviction, from a dream
vivid as reality, in which I saw a strip of shingly beach standing out
distinct in the gloom of night, with black rocks jutting out into a
milky sea, and breakers dashing over them; and Alec himself, his face
white and his hair streaming with wet, borne up on the curve of a
glassy wave, flinging out his arms and clinging to a rock as the wave
roared on.</p>

<p>I looked again at my watch; it was four o'clock. I did not need to
reason with myself. I knew as well as though I had been at Alec's side
that his boat had been capsized near the Chinaman's Island, half-way
across Gundabine Bay, I knew, too, that Alec was safe. After the first
shuddering terror there came to me indeed a sensation of relief. Alec
was not drowned; nothing more could happen that night. I knew that he
was safe. He would remain on the Chinaman's deserted island till
daybreak, and then he would signal, and Rame would take him off.</p>

<p>I can't account for this "ghostly" experience of mine. The psychical
scientists would say that it was an instance of telepathic
communication. Perhaps centuries hence an enlightened generation will
have acquired the art of communicating telepathically at will. It is
quite clear to me that my soul was with Alec that night. It has been
equally clear to me several times in my life, that while I lay asleep
my soul flew over miles of intervening space, and made itself known to
one dear to me. Sometimes the soul of that other one has visited me,
and long afterwards we two, in the flesh, have compared times and
conditions and feelings, and have told each other that this thing
certainly was.</p>

<p>I did not stay in bed any longer, but got up, a new fear striking
me. The wind shrieked and wailed, making the wooden building shake on
its piles, and hurling the canvas seats against the palisading of the
verandah. The ceiling flapped like some giant bat; and the goats, which
had a way of escaping from their fold on stormy nights and collecting
under the house, made strange noises with their scraping horns and
tinkling bells and melancholy bleating, which heightened the uproar of
the wild night. When I had put on my clothes I went out into the
verandah and stood at the corner which jutted out upon the bald brow of
the hill. It was like being on the deck of a ship. I saw a curious
sight. To the right and to the left of me, as I faced south, the
horizon was lurid. On the mainland, Mount Akobaora was like a volcano
belching flame. The fire was blazing on its summit, and spread down the
deep gullies along its sides in zigzag rifts, giving the appearance of
streams of molten lava. Right down to the shore were vivid patches and
wavy lines of light. There was nothing to be alarmed at in this. The
Narrows lay between us, and I only wondered vaguely if Lina Sabine was
at home to enjoy the sight. But to my left, oceanward, there climbed
swiftly over the rocky ridge what seemed like an array of strange fiery
forms advancing in scattered ranks, extending to the width, perhaps, of
half a mile. I remembered having noticed a thin curl of smoke against
the sky late that afternoon; but it had given me no anxiety, for the
air was so still, and what wind there was came from the north-west. But
now the gale was blowing straight in my face. The bush was on fire.
Alec was away; and what was to save the stockyard--the pride of the
island--and our paddock fences? On the top of that distant ridge, which
for a space was arid and stony, I could see the tall gum-trees standing
out at the edge of the bush, and the fire twisting up their limbs like
red-hot serpents. Even as I watched, the flames--blown over the
intervening rocky patch--caught the tops of the gum-trees, and spread
down the ridge till it seemed a sheet of fire. Dawn broke and paled the
illumination. I knew that below the ridge lay a morass some miles in
extent, green with she-oak, and probably retaining moisture enough to
offer a check to the fire. In this morass dwelt a number of wild pigs,
those which had afforded sport to Loftus and Lazarus. After the
inconsequent fashion of such fancies, I thought of Elia's essay, and
the possible gastronomical discovery of an aboriginal Bo-bo, and I
wondered whether the origin of bush fires might not be traced, like the
Chinese epidemic of conflagration, to roast pig.</p>

<p>But it was not a time for airy speculation. I roused up the
McGilrays, who, in their turn, called the black boys. At daybreak we
were all standing on the highest part of the hill, gazing in
consternation at the fire, which, apparently having met with a barrier
at the morass, had divided, but was creeping round to south and north,
and would ere long meet again in the dry gum forest on the other
side.</p>

<p>I asked McGilray helplessly whether it was not possible to do
something by which the fences and the stockyard might be secured. The
stockyard lay at the foot of the hill, and had no barrier between it
and the oncoming fire except a range of broken, unconnected
water-holes.</p>

<p>"And what for no, mem?" replied McGilray, perking up his chin after
the usual formula; but he collapsed immediately, and remarked weakly
that he and the two black boys, and all the green wattle boughs they
could carry would be very little use in beating out such a fire as
that; while Island Billy could only suggest darkly, "Mine think it
Bunyip sit down alongee swamp," as though that fabulous monster of
aboriginal legend must be in some way responsible for the whole
business, and McGilray added that he judged it might be a good thing to
collect our valuables and the station ledgers and make for the
boat.</p>

<p>Mrs. McGilray had said nothing as yet, but now she turned upon
McGilray with a scorn that is indescribable, and uttered the one
syllable--"Man!" "I'm thinking," she said to me, after a moment's
pause, "that if we could burn the grass all along the waterholes before
the fire gets near, we might save the stockyard; but there's no time to
lose."</p>

<p>Mrs. McGilray mustered the available hands, six of us, counting
Sentilena and the black boys. She despatched McGilray and the boys to
cut wattle boughs and commence operations; then, directing me to put on
a stuff kirt and veil and my thickest boots, she dressed herself in
like manner, and before sunrise we two were tearing down the hill
towards the spot, a little way from the stockyard, where McGilray had
already started a thickly-spreading patch of smoke. The big water-hole
lay quite close to the stockyard; the little ones, some distance apart
from each other, describing a broken backward curve. Our object was to
burn the grass for a good many yards between them, so that when the
fire reached this point it would have nothing to feed upon.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down a little, and here it was much more sheltered
than on our exposed hill; nevertheless, the fires we kindled spread
rapidly, and in a few minutes had gained the line where we were placed
at intervals prepared with green branches to beat out the flames. It
was hard work, but to me by no means new. I had helped before now to
beat down a bush fire. The dead leaves and dry grass crackled and
spluttered; we were enveloped in a cloud of thick smoke, and the wind
blew a shower of fine ashes against our breasts and faces. Fortunately,
here the timber was scant, and there was less danger of the fire
getting the better of us. We were too excited to think of reptiles
lurking in the long grass and undergrowth. Once a black snake glided
past my feet, and another time, Island Billy, shouting "death adder,"
flung away his bough, snatched up a stick, and began to belabour what
at first sight seemed a short, stumpy bit of log lying on an ant track.
Now and then, a startled opossum would leap up, uttering its queer
guttural "gr-r-r"; or a jew lizard, routed off a fallen tree, would
elevate its extraordinary ruff, stand still and hiss for a minute, and
then move on; or an iguana would scurry ahead of the smoke and make for
the handiest gum tree. We fancied that we could hear the roar of the
more distant fire above the screeching of the parrots and cockatoos
which, disturbed by the commotion, circled in noisy flights overhead.
By nine o'clock a broad black belt stretched away on each side from the
big water-hole, and we felt that the stockyard was safe.</p>

<p>Grimy and weary, we were turning back to the house, when Island
Billy cried, "Look, look, missus. Plenty fire; sit down along hill,
close-up humpy!"</p>

<p>The smouldering portion first set alight had broken out again,
unnoticed by us in the ardour of our task, and the fire was fast
climbing the hill on the Narrows side, where the long-bladed grass grew
rank in the steep gullies, and the ascent was too difficult to be made
except in cases of haste or emergency. I glanced with dismay at the
dead skeleton gums close to the house, and thought how readily they
would burn in this wind-swept spot, and how easily a spark might be
carried to the shingled roof, and destroy our dwelling. There was
nothing for it but to try and beat out the flames as they mounted the
brow of the hill.</p>

<p>Not in our success, but in our failure, lay the great achievement
which must for ever stand out in Island history. Nearly all the
vegetation on the plateau was burnt to tinder. I could almost have
cried at the blackness of the desolation. With difficulty we saved the
aloe and the poinsettia. Nothing but charred stubble remained of the
fat, tall grass tussocks, heaped up with the withered refuse of many a
summer, and the larvae of countless myriads of mosquitoes. There was
the secret. I began to realize it dimly when dusk came unaccompanied by
the low roar and the dense, brown, pricking swarm to which we had grown
accustomed. In burning those ancient grass tussocks, we had burned the
mosquitoes. It was indeed a blessed fact. Each succeeding night proved
its reality.</p>

<p>The fire raged nearly all that day. We watched it creep up to our
black barrier and slowly draw off sideways like a baffled foe, till its
course was hidden by the hills to the north of the head station. But we
could tell by the volumes of smoke and the look of the sky that it was
spreading; and, though the gale had fallen, I began to tremble for the
cattle and the winter supply of grass. At four o'clock the sky
darkened. Lightning flashed from the black masses of cloud on the
western horizon, which banked up till the gloom was of night. Thunder
pealed angrily. The stillness was like the holding of a world's breath.
Then the heavens burst, and rain and hail fell for the space of half an
hour. When the storm ceased, there was no more smoke. A delicious
coolness revived man and beast; the naked gullies gurgled with running
water, and birds and reptiles rejoiced.</p>

<p>*"Eli," crabs.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX. Lina's Fancies.</h3>

<p>IT was a great surprise when, the next morning, at the time of high
tide, Brown came up on foot from the Narrows, appearing by the short
cut up the charred hill-side, whence he shouted to me that he had
orders to put Smiler in the buggy at once, and go down to the landing
for Alec and Mrs. Sabine. I was sorry that Lina's arrival had not been
delayed till the green grass had had time to spring up, but glad that,
at least after she left the landing, she would not be devoured by
mosquitoes. I wondered within myself whether Mr. Sabine was of the
party, and devoutly hoped that he had remained at Gundabine. All was
explained when the buggy drove up. Lina, looking fragile, nervous, and
lovely, told me that Mr. Sabine had gone up to the north on business,
leaving her in Gundabine, and that she and Alec had made a plan between
them, and he had brought her over in Rame's boat, and that she was
going to keep me company while Alec was in Sydney. For Alec had
received letters in Gundabine referring to the clearing off in part of
our mortgage, and the remittance which his father had sent out from
England, and was obliged to start for Sydney with the least possible
delay. He explained all this to me as soon as we were alone. There was
something more than the emotion of an ordinary greeting and imminent
leave-taking in his manner. I knew what it meant, and I knew that he
would try to keep from me the danger he had run in crossing the bay, so
as to save me anxiety in the future.</p>

<p>"Oh! Alec," I cried, breaking down, "I might as well be a sailor's
wife at once. I shall never know a moment's peace when you are away,
and there is a south-easter blowing. Let us sell this place as soon as
we can, and go and live on the mainland."</p>

<p>Alec reasoned with me gently, assuring me that since the Island had
been inhabited by white men, there had hardly been one serious boating
accident. But when I said to him, gravely, "Alec, I want to know what
was happening to you about four o'clock in the early morning of
yesterday," he looked at me in a startled manner; and I told him the
story of my dream. It was all quite true. The gale had caught them as
they were sailing across the bay, and had upset the boat, fortunately
close to the Chinaman's Island. Alec and Brown had managed to swim
ashore, and in the morning they had signalled for Rame to take them
off. But the boat was lost for ever.</p>

<p>Alec went to Sydney by way of the pilot station, and Lina Sabine and
I were left alone. During Alec's last hours we two were selfishly
occupied with ourselves and with station business. Alec had a great
many directions to give--how I was to write up the station log
regularly; how Brown was to report to me each day's operations on the
run; near what particular camps the tailing mob was to be pastured, and
so on. Mrs. Sabine showed, too, that she had the faculty of effacing
herself, so that I did not notice at first how pale and delicate she
had become, what a depressed, frightened way she had, and how nervously
she started at the sudden sound of a footstep or the slamming of a
door.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Kempsey, the pilot, who seriously called my attention to
the change in Lina, since once he had travelled with her, in the
steamer from the Cape to Stonehampton, when she was bright, beautiful
Lina Trass. Mr. Kempsey rode down from the pilot station to buy meat,
the day after Alec went, bringing back the pack-horse laden with more
Tasmanian apples and smuggled jam. Mr. Kempsey, in his rough sailor
blouse, with his weather-beaten face and kindly eyes, was always a
welcome sight. He took the deepest interest in our affairs, and, as
most of our important business was transacted by telegraph, he and
Polly were in nearly all our secrets. His delight in the extirpation of
the mosquitoes was almost more than he could express. It would find
vent in spasmodic congratulations jerked into every pause in the
conversation. But I could see that his eyes were constantly wandering
to Lina, and just before he left, when I was weighing out the meat for
him in the store, he said anxiously and confidentially--</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansdell, you'll have your hands full presently, I'm afraid,
with that pretty piece of white and gold chaney in there. She ain't
fitted for being left to herself in the bush with a husband like that
Mr. Sabine, who is never happy unless he is making a row. She is one of
the laughing--crying sort, all nerves and fancies, that as like as not
will go melancholy if they ain't always cottered. She's that 'unked'
now, that I shouldn't wonder if she did go melancholy; and if she does,
you just take my advice and bring her up to the pilot station, and I'll
ship you to Stonehampton to the doctor."</p>

<p>There was a good deal of truth in what Mr. Kempsey said. He had some
odd phrases, and his "unked," which meant sick, sorry, and something of
what the Scotch call "fey," somehow expressed Lina's condition. She was
certainly very much altered. I was able to observe the dreary
expression of her face when it was in repose; she had grown terribly
thin. Her pretty, vivacious manner of gesticulation seemed to have
become a travesty of itself. Her large, bright, blue eyes had a
pathetic, startled, at times frightened, look. She alternated between a
hysterical kind of gaiety and listless depression. Though she would sit
silent for ever so long at a time, she could not bear to be alone, and
would follow me about the house, among the chickens, and into the
kitchen, apologising with her joyless little laugh, and saying that she
had been almost entirely by herself at Akobaora of late, and that it
had got upon her nerves.</p>

<p>Something had undoubtedly got upon her nerves. I wondered whether it
was Mr. Lyndon's return, and regret for her want of faith in him; or
whether, as I suspected, her marriage had turned out a miserable
mistake. I felt certain that she was most unhappy; but I did not know
how to approach her with sympathy. Since that wild burst of confidence
at Gundabine, she had drawn in within herself; and now, except for an
occasional bitter speech, she made no allusion to her own private
sorrows and disappointments.</p>

<p>One night, after I had gone to bed, she came to my room, wrapped in
her dressing-gown, and looking very pale and wild.</p>

<p>"Rachel," she said, "would you mind my staying here with you? I
don't know what has come to me. I can't bear to be by myself. My nerves
have gone all to pieces." And then she added, hesitatingly, and almost
in a whisper, "I have such horrible fancies."</p>

<p>I made her lie down on the bed, and took her hands in mine. Though
the night was quite hot, they were as cold as stones, and she was
shivering. I covered her with blankets and brought her some hot brandy
and water to drink, and gradually she got warm again.</p>

<p>"Lina," I asked, "what sort of fancies?"</p>

<p>She did not answer at once, and then she said abruptly, in a
resentful tone--</p>

<p>"It is a great mistake to suppose that people are not punished in
this world for having given others pain. The pain comes back on
oneself. A girl who behaves heartlessly is always paid out. That's
justice, but it is hard upon her when judgment comes."</p>

<p>"Lina," I said, "you are thinking of Mr. Lyndon, and there's no good
in that."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," she replied. "I'm thinking about myself." She was
silent for awhile, then said, in a very low voice, "Rachel, do you
think one could ever get to hate a man so much that one would really
want him to die? Do you remember Gwendolen--in Daniel Deronda, you
know--and the dagger she locked away in her dressing-case? I feel like
Gwendolen. I'm frightened--frightened of myself."</p>

<p>She turned away from me, shuddering. I could not get her to tell me
anything more that night. By-and-by she seemed to sleep. It was not
till two or three nights afterwards, when the poor thing had another
nervous crisis, and woke up cold and trembling, and clinging to me,
beseeching me to save her from her bad thoughts, that I drew from her
what her trouble was.</p>

<p>Once she had begun, her confidence poured forth unchecked; and it
seemed a relief to her to open her heart. The trouble was what I had
guessed all along, intensified by ill-health, want of companionship,
and a naturally morbid tendency. She was very wretched. She had been
trying to make a brave fight, but Mr. Sabine frightened and cowed her
by his masterful, quarrelsome ways, his jeers, and his violent temper.
He did not mean to be cruel, she put in pathetically. He was only like
a schoolboy who pulls off flies' legs to show his superiority. It was
his nature. She described her lonely life at Akobaora: Mr. Sabine was
often at the mine; and when he was at home she wished, for peace sake,
that he would go away. She had no one to talk to. She was obliged to
bottle up her thoughts and all her gloomy imaginings. Mr. Sabine was
very angry with her if she seemed unhappy. Sometimes, when she felt
that she must cry, she would go out into the bush and hide herself
among the gum-trees and sob till her misery had for the time spent
itself. It was only the hope of soon leaving Australia that helped her
to endure. She felt that she had sold herself and had not yet been paid
the price. It was terrible; she hated herself, and she hated him worse
than she hated herself. If she lived that life much longer, she knew
that she must die or go mad. Now he said that he could not settle up
the affairs of his reef, and that they would not be able to go to
England, and then what could she do? How could she bear it? Did I
believe in people being under the influence of evil spirits? Sometimes
she fancied that it was an evil spirit which put wicked thoughts into
her mind--thoughts about her husband. The confession halted, and her
words came brokenly and with difficulty; it was because she was ill and
nervous. Oh, she knew that, she was always telling herself that; and
she would see a doctor when she went to Stonehampton. But knowing that,
didn't make the thoughts less dreadful; they frightened her. What kind
of thoughts? She did not like to tell me. I would think she was mad.
One kind was about a little pistol which Mr. Sabine kept loaded in her
bed-room. She was always seeing herself pulling the trigger of that
pistol. And another was about a Malay knife he had brought from
Singapore. She had locked away that knife, because she was afraid of
it. She was afraid of other things too. But all this was less terrible
than an awful feeling of dread--of spiritual desolation--dread, she
didn't know of what; she couldn't explain or describe. It seized her
suddenly at times--mostly when she was alone, but very often when she
was laughing and talking. It would come all in a moment; it was like
nothing I could imagine.</p>

<p>There was another fit of nervous trembling. I dosed her with sal
volatile, and playfully scolded her, making light of her revelations. I
told her that she needed rousing up, and cheering and tonicking; that
her blood didn't nourish her brain properly; that her nerves had run
down; that she had been reading too many sensational novels, and had
allowed her imagination to become morbid, and to get the better of her
good sense; and that a trip to town and a few bottles of steel wine
would set her all right again.</p>

<p>I felt more strongly, however, than I would let Lina see, and in my
heart shrank from the responsibility of keeping her for a fortnight in
the bush in her present shaky and nervous condition. I felt sure that
she ought to have medical advice and a change of scene from the eternal
gum-trees, and I determined that I would act on Mr. Kempsey's
suggestion, and take her to Stonehampton, where I had been told that
there was a clever and sympathetic doctor. Accordingly I summoned Brown
and McGilray, and after a consultation with them, decided upon trusting
to the pilots to put us on to a passing steamer. I felt that I could
not brave the Narrows again in a south-east wind, and without Alec;
and, besides, we should have to wait nearly a week for the steamer, as
so few called in at Gundabine. Brown was told to get in the quietest
horse in the paddock which would carry a lady. Lazarus was chosen for
me, and my own hack given to Mrs. Sabine. McGilray was put in charge at
the head--station during my absence, and it was arranged that we should
start that afternoon.</p>

<p>Lina took very kindly to the project. She got quite gay over the
packing of our saddle-bags; but I had no reason to regret my
resolution, for she relapsed again mentally and physically before we
had come to the end of our twenty miles ride.</p>

<p>I never saw a place so lonely as the pilot station. Except the faint
blue outline of the coast, on the other side of the Stonehampton
Harbour, there was nothing to be seen from it but sky and ocean. It was
a humped, treeless, swelling promontory covered with short grass, that
made it look as if it had been shorn, which stretched out from the
dense forest of the Island into the vast Pacific. There was a red
lighthouse at the point, with brown rocks sticking out like teeth below
it, and a little cluster of wooden houses seemed to grow like mushrooms
on the cliff. A few goats browsed on the green humps, and the tall,
bare telegraph poles stood out against the sky.</p>

<p>The chief pilot was away with his family on leave at this time. None
of the other men but Mr. Kempsey were married, and when we got down to
Mr. Kempsey's house--easily distinguished as the terminus of the
telegraph wires--Polly Kempsey appeared to be the only representative
of feminine humanity on the station. Polly was a shy, odd little woman
of sixteen, reminding one somehow of a scrub kangaroo or a native bear,
brought in and tamed, with her short, shaggy, brown mane, her bright,
black eyes, and her startled way. She looked as if the wind had
interfered with her growth, and perhaps it had, for she had never been
away from the Island in her life, and had bent before the gales.
Polly's knowledge of the world was chiefly derived from the telegraphic
messages which were incessantly clicking through the house, and which
practice from infancy enabled her to read by sound as they ran. In this
way Polly must have acquired a mass of miscellaneous information, for
the Cape was a through station, and all messages, political,
departmental, European, and otherwise, flashed along the line. Polly
got twenty pounds a year as telegraph mistress, and I believe it would
have been impossible to find a more expert operator. The needle clicked
all the time, as we sat in the little parlour making friends over the
cup of tea Polly prepared for us. It was very hard to get Polly to
talk, though when set going on her own subject, her sentences were
jerked out with an extraordinary rapidity. She had got into the way of
making long and short pauses on her words, as if she were keeping time
to the telegraph needle; and her face wore, when she was silent, an
abstracted listening look, such as I have seen on the faces of mediums
who were supposed to be carrying on communication with an unseen world.
Once, when the needle stopped for a minute, Polly announced in her
abrupt manner: "Mr. Gladstone has announced to the House of Commons
that, in consequence of the vote on the Irish University Bill, Her
Majesty's Ministers have tendered their resignations."</p>

<p>"Why, Polly!" I exclaimed, "how do you know that?"</p>

<p>"It's just gone through," answered Polly; "and there"--she waited as
the needle recommenced--"The attitude of the Sultan of Zanzibar is
unconciliatory; and Sir Bartle Frere's mission is a failure."</p>

<p>Lina went off into a fit of hysterical laughter, and Polly looked
surprised, but supposed that it must seem queer to a person not
accustomed to it. She told us that I was to have her bed, which was in
the operating room, and said she hoped the instrument wouldn't keep me
awake. "You won't understand it," Polly continued, warming to her
theme; "so I dare say it will seem like any other noise. But it do go
on so at nights, when I'm half asleep and half awake, with its mort of
news" (Polly had picked up some of her father's expressions, which I
learned long afterwards were old Northamptonshire), "its Fenian plots,
and earthquakes, and poisonings, and treaties, and folks worrying at
each other over things with long queer names; that when I get up in the
morning, it's like as if I'd been dreaming the world had turned
crazy."</p>

<p>Mr. Kempsey, who had been out with the pilots in the boat, came in
by-and-by, and, saying that he would relieve Polly at the instrument,
told her to take us to the beach and show us about, to look in at the
lighthouse at the same time, and see that the lamp was all right, and
to fetch up the goats, so that we might have some fresh milk for
supper. Polly's duties seemed multifarious. Mr. Kempsey gazed
compassionately at Lina, observing that she didn't "look deadly well,"
and that there was bound to be a steamer next day, or the day after,
and he'd keep on the look-out for smoke. We sent telegrams to Alec and
to Mr. Sabine, up north, also to a hotel at Stonehampton, and then we
went down to the beach, where Polly waded about among the rocks and
broke off oysters for us. The fresh sea air and new surroundings did
Lina good, and she slept soundly that night. I lay awake for a long
time in Polly's bed--a wooden crib with a mattress exhaling the
peculiar odour of dried seaweed--the roar of the sea almost drowning
the tick of the telegraph instrument, while every now and then the
warning bell would jingle, and Polly or Mr. Kempsey would come in and
take down a message, reading off the tape as if to reassure me lest I
should imagine some awful European disaster had taken place. "Only the
Mary Ann barque, Twofold Bay, sighted off Beacon Point"; or "Taralpa,
A. S. N. Co., signalled Cooktown. No good for you"; or--one of the
last--"Big floods coming down Stoney River I doubt if the Stonehampton
steamer will get up" and so the night wore away.</p>

<h3>Chapter X. The House of Memories.</h3>

<p>STONEHAMPTON is some forty miles up from the harbour, and the
telegraphic report of big floods was curiously corroborated on the
morrow by the washing ashore of the carcases of several drowned sheep
and cattle. Such floods are frequent enough without any previous
warning. A river will often "come down" in this way, there having been
tremendous rain high up in the ranges, and none at all in the country
near its mouth.</p>

<p>Contrary to Mr. Kempsey's prognostications, however, we did get up
the river. In the grey of our second morning at the pilot station,
smoke was sighted to seaward, and Lina and I were hurried,
half-dressed, down to the beach, carried through the surf on Mr.
Kempsey's back to the boat, and finally received on board a mail
steamer bound north, which was putting into Stonehampton.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the first person who stretched out his hand to help us
on board was Mr. Robinson, the husband of Lina's schoolfellow, and also
a friend of Alec's, though as yet I had never met him. He was a
good--looking, quiet, middle-aged squatter, who had a house in
Stonehampton, where his wife was now staying--the house of poignant
memories to Lina. When he heard our plans, he insisted, in the genial
bush fashion, upon our giving up all idea of going to a hotel. There
wasn't a decent one in Stonehampton, he said. They were all rowdy
places, only fit for Never-never new chums down on a spree. We must go
with him to his house. Milly would never forgive him if he didn't bring
us along; and so on.</p>

<p>I fancied that Lina, shrinking from the revival of painful
associations, would refuse his invitation; but, to my surprise, she
seemed to wish to accept it, and when I agreed, grew quite excited at
the prospect, her brilliant colour coming and going, and giving her an
even more fragile appearance than when she was pale and listless, her
soft laugh tinkling, and all her pretty little play of gesture starting
anew. Lina was a great puzzle. I really think that, in a sort of way,
she enjoyed being harrowed. At any rate, she thoroughly enjoyed being
the heroine of a situation. We were a long time getting up the river.
The flood was coming down--a turbid, yellow torrent, which, as it
reached the bar, seemed to make a distinct path of its own, like that
of the Rhone where it falls into Lake Leman. Great quantities of
driftwood floated with the current, and many bodies of dead beasts.
There were living ones, too, their heads above water, still swimming,
and being fast carried out to sea. It was a melancholy and curious
sight. We passed a little island in mid-stream, a low mangrove-covered
mud-bank, which was packed with animals that had taken refuge
there--cattle, sheep, horses, as well as kangaroos, opossums, emus, and
many wild creatures, all crowded together in a dense mass, half
drowned, and completely tamed with fright.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the day when we got to Stonehampton, among the
low wharves and wooden warehouses, which stood along the flat banks,
jumbled up with streets and ferries, queer one-storied shops and
verandahed dwelling-houses, closed in with yellow alamandas, passion
fruit, and orange begonias. The banana plantations, the feathery
bamboos, the gorgeous creepers, the different sorts of cactus, and the
hibiscus trees, with their pink and red flowers, gave the place a
tropical look; but otherwise it was crude, unpicturesque, and steamy,
and we were glad to drive off in Mr. Robinson's buggy to the higher
ground, a little way from the river, where lived most of the Government
officials and the better-class residents.</p>

<p>Lina gave an odd involuntary sigh, casting back a pathetic, meaning
look at me, which seemed to say, "Do you remember?" as we stepped on to
the verandah--the scene of her parting with Mr. Lyndon. There was the
stephanotis drooping its waxen trails, and the scented verbena
clambering up the wooden pilasters, and stretching out in the dusk, the
paddock with its cida-retusa shrubs and little water-holes, "where they
used to go craw-fishing"--all the background of poor Lina's romance.
Milly Robinson was a gay, affected little woman, who said smart, silly
things, and was, perhaps, the worst guide and monitor which could have
been found for Lina Trass. She was very kind to us, however, making us
effusively welcome, setting to work immediately to plan all manner of
diversions, and refusing to believe that there was anything the matter
with Lina, till the poor girl herself settled the question by going off
into one of her hysterical shivering fits, and finally subsiding into a
dead faint.</p>

<p>Lina was very ill for several days. The doctor said that she had
narrowly escaped a severe nervous malady, and commended my wisdom in
bringing her away from the bush, which undoubtedly had had the worst
effect upon her sensitive organization. As soon as she got better, he
said that she must have plenty of cheerful society, gentle exercise,
and all the distractions that could be devised, a prescription that
fitted admirably with Mrs. Robinson's views and suggestions. The
Stonehamptonites all called upon us, and we assisted at a series of
mild after-dinner festivities, at which Lina and I wore our trousseau
gowns, and the men mostly dressed in white duck or thin alpaca suits.
We lounged in the verandah, flourishing mosquito-whisks and fans, or
strolled about the garden in pairs, while somebody made music in the
drawing-room; then all came in at ten or thereabouts to eat cake and
melons and strawberry-guavas, and imbibe iced drinks. It was arranged
that we were to remain with the Robinsons till our husbands joined
us--Alec from Sydney and Mr. Sabine from the north. Mr. Sabine wrote
fussy letters to the doctor and to his wife, which last were a jumble
of bad spelling, scolding, exhortations to spend as much money as she
liked, and not to let Mrs. Robinson "boss the show"; but on no account
to wear her smartest dresses till he came down--bluster, conceit, and
general anxiety. Alec wrote that he was delighted I was having a
pleasant change, and making acquaintance with Stonehampton, that I was
to be sure and not worry about the Island, and that he would come to me
as soon as he could, and, if possible, arrange to stay for some
up-country races which were to be held shortly near Mr. Robinson's
station, and at which he proposed to run one of the Island horses.
These were the races in which Mr. Sabine had so greatly interested
himself. He had succeeded in getting up a Corinthian for gentleman
riders, and meant to ride himself a horse about which he had bragged
considerably when we were staying at Sykes's in Gundabine.</p>

<p>The uneasiness which I felt at first on the score of a meeting
between Lina and Mr. Lyndon gradually subsided, for I heard of him as
being very hard at work on his railway, and not at all likely to visit
Stonehampton while Lina was there. But my theory of magnetic currents
comes into play again. Destiny seemed to have ordained that they were
to be brought together. This was how it happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson had organized a visit to the bachelor manager of a
great meat-preserving establishment, who had very pretty and roomy
quarters some distance up the river. It was settled that we were to go
there one afternoon, in the company's steamer, dine, dance, and stay
the night, returning the next day to Stonehampton.</p>

<p>Lina was in unusually high spirits. The manager of the
meat-preserving place was an old admirer of hers--not in any serious or
melodramatic fashion, but sufficiently so to impart piquancy to the
excursion.</p>

<p>"I feel like a prisoner in the Conciergerie, or one of those places
during the French Revolution, Rachel," she said, laughing. "Any night
now I may hear my name in the list of the condemned. Mr. Sabine is on
his way down, and I'm expecting to see his steamer signalled; and I'm
going to dance and make merry before my execution."</p>

<p>I never saw Lina look prettier than she did that day, in a soft
falling black dress, with her yellow hair escaping from under her
little hat. We took down fichus and evening shoes, as the way is at
these primitive entertainments, and gave a festive appearance to our
toilettes generally by decking ourselves before dinner with such
flowers as the garden offered. The verandah was, like many others at
this time, festooned with stephanotis in full bloom, and Lina gathered
great withes of the waxen green leaves and snowy flowers, and hung them
about her bodice, her waist, and in her hair, in a manner that would
have seemed utterly fantastic in anyone else, but which suited her to
perfection.</p>

<p>We were in the middle of dinner, which was served in a somewhat
impromptu fashion, with a good deal of laughter over the shifts and
contrivances of a bachelor m&eacute;nage, when a tall good-looking man,
whom I felt sure at a glance was Mr. Lyndon, appeared from the
verandah, stopping at the end of the table where our host was seated,
with Lina at his right hand and me at his left. Lina was placed with
her back to the window as Mr. Lyndon came in, and I don't think for the
moment he knew who she was. Certainly his manner was quite
unembarrassed, as he said, "How do you do, Kelmarsh? I'm awfully sorry
to come in so late; but when I heard that you had a party, I stopped at
the foreman's quarters to make myself respectable. I found that I was
obliged to be in Stonehampton to-morrow, and I thought my easiest way
of getting there was to ride over here from the Works and trust to your
sending me down the river in your steamer. No, don't trouble to make
room. I'll find myself a seat somewhere," as Mr. Kelmarsh, with a noisy
welcome, was rising to fetch another chair.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of room here," said Mr. Kelmarsh, "if Mrs. Sabine
doesn't mind moving a little nearer me and letting you sit next her.
You know Mrs. Sabine, Lyndon?" And thus the two met.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment, and I think Mrs. Robinson felt uneasy, for
she bent markedly across the table and drew everyone's attention to
herself by attacking Mr. Lyndon with some flippant banter about the
dusky daughter of a Malayan Maharajah with whom rumour had connected
his stay in Singapore.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyndon gave one look at Lina, as he held out his hand, saying
quietly, "How do you do, Mrs. Sabine?" then turned to Milly Robinson
and jestingly parried her thrusts. I don't think that anyone not
noticing him very closely would have observed the momentary spasm which
came over his face, the tight setting of his lips, and the stiffening
of his features, as if he were nerving himself to bear some sharp
pain.</p>

<p>As for Lina, she said not a word. She only looked fixedly at her
plate for a moment or two after the greeting, and presently went on
talking to Mr. Kelmarsh as if nothing had happened. She was a little
more subdued, that was all. I saw that she flushed up suddenly once
when she became aware that Mr. Lyndon's eyes glanced down at her right
hand and rested upon the little curiously wrought ring of which she had
told me the history, and which she still wore. But, on the whole, she
showed more dignity than I had expected from her. It is quite true that
the weakest and most emotional women can, upon occasions, be the
bravest and most self-controlled.</p>

<p>"Don't get into a funk about me, Rachel," she whispered a little
later, when we were together in the verandah. "It's all right. I'm
strung up to it now. I shan't make a fool of myself, as I did that day
in Gundabine. Only promise that you won't go far away from me. If you
see me on the edge of a precipice--I like playing on the edge of
precipices--don't try to pull me back, but keep near and just prevent
me from toppling over."</p>

<p>The music struck up, and Mr. Kelmarsh came to ask her to dance
before she could say any more. I watched her as she whirled round. I
had never seen her dance before. She was like a sylph, or like some
laughing Undine, and for the moment seemed soulless and light-hearted.
Mr. Lyndon disappeared. She danced now with one and now with another;
and I too, allowed myself to be led off, and so had less opportunity of
observing her. The dancing, however, was somewhat desultory and
spiritless. The floor was bad, and it was too hot for much exertion.
Very soon the little company broke up into knots and couples. By way of
rallying it, Mr. Kelmarsh asked Lina to sing. I forget whether I have
ever mentioned Lina's singing. She had a voice of no great power or
compass; but its tones were like those of a bird--they were so sweet
and true; and she had a plaintive, totally unconventional way of
singing negro melodies and wild little bush songs, that was like
nothing else I have ever heard. Lina's singing was as distinctly a part
of her own self as her yellow hair and blue eyes, and the strange thing
about it was its mournfulness. Her voice seemed to come from a long way
off, and at times there was a tremble in it that somehow always brought
tears near to my eyes.</p>

<p>Milly Robinson sat down to the piano to play the accompaniment. Lina
never made a fuss about her singing. She stood up now without any
preliminary flutter, her hands folded simply before her, looking, as
she stood, in her soft black dress and all the stephanotis flowers, and
with her hair a little tossed and her eyes gazing over everybody away
beyond the room, like a figure in a child's fairy story. She sang from
memory a little nigger song of which she was very fond. I didn't know
then where it came from--it has become popular and hackneyed since that
time; but I never can hear it now without wanting to go away and cry. I
used to feel a little like that even then, Lina made it so pathetic. I
find myself always using that word in relation to Lina, but it comes
more naturally than any other. She was not very heroic, nor very true,
nor very good, but she was pathetic.</p>

<p>I went out into the verandah when Lina began, and took possession of
a squatter's chair in the darkest corner, at the end where there were
no windows shedding light from the drawing-room. It was a little bowery
place, closed in with ferns and an ancient grape-vine, that cast odd
shadows on the bit of grassy bank leading up to the boards. A clump of
bamboos rustled and quivered close by, making strange human noises.
Outside, the garden was all dark and shadowy, with here and there a
cluster of great white datura bells, showing like ghostly patches. Lina
was singing--</p>

<pre>
"So it's good-bye, children, I'm gwine to go
Where de rain doan fall and de win doan blow.
And your ulster coats you will not need
When we ride up in the chariot in de morn.
But your golden slippers must be nice and clean.
An' your age must just be sweet sixteen.
An' your white kid gloves you will hab to wear.
When we ride up in de chariot in de morn."
</pre>

<p>We all know the chorus to each verse!--</p>

<pre>
"Ah, dem golden slippers! Ah, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I'm gwine to wear bekase dey look so neat!
Ah, dem golden slippers! Ah, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I'm gwine to wear, to walk in de golden street."
</pre>

<p>But when Lina had finished singing this last verse, and paused for
several moments, no one took up the chorus, as some had done with the
other verses. Then Mr. Kelmarsh called, "Chorus, chorus," and asked
loudly, "Where's Lyndon? He hasn't joined. Come on, Lyndon."</p>

<p>There was no answer, and the chorus died away. Lina did not wait,
but stepped out in the verandah, and came round towards where I was
sitting. I was going to get up to show myself, when suddenly a figure
rose quite close to me from the edge of the verandah, where it had been
all the time, its back towards me, indistinguishable in the shadow of
the grape-vine.</p>

<p>"Lina!" the man said, then added, "Mrs. Sabine," in a hesitating,
half--bitter way, and advanced to meet her. It was Mr. Lyndon.</p>

<p>Lina gave a little cry, and came forward too. She stood leaning
against the verandah pillar, and he stood facing her.</p>

<p>"Will you let me speak to you for a few minutes?" he said. "I should
like to congratulate you on your marriage. I should like to ask if you
are happy."</p>

<p>Lina did not answer. I sat quite still; there was no use in getting
up now, and making them feel uncomfortable. I hated the idea of playing
the caves-dropper, even involuntarily; but after what Lina had said a
few moments ago, there was less need for me to feel compunction. I felt
that it might be better for her if I were near, and that at any rate
this was what she herself wished.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyndon waited for her to speak. She was still silent, her head
drooped, and he said abruptly, "If you would tell me that you were
happy I should mind less."</p>

<p>Lina looked up at him, clasping her hands before her impulsively
after a way she had.</p>

<p>"I never told you anything that wasn't true," she said simply, "and
I can't tell you that."</p>

<p>"You never told me anything that wasn't true?" he said in a quiet
tone, as if he expected the other part of her answer. "Are you quite
sure of that? When you wrote to me on the steamer, and told me that you
loved me, was that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said very low, but very distinctly, and there was silence
for a minute.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?" he broke out. "Not because of me. I never asked
you to give me your promise. I wouldn't take it from you--but for your
own sake? Why didn't you wait a little and let the old fancy die? It
couldn't have been more than a fancy, Lina. If you had loved me you
would have believed in me."</p>

<p>"And you?" she exclaimed passionately. "Oh, you shouldn't be hard on
me. You were hard then. If you had only sent one line--one word! If
you'd said to me before you went away even--'Lina, be true to me,' that
would have been something to hold by."</p>

<p>"Did you want that? Didn't you know that it was because I loved you
so?" he said with an infinite tenderness, and a keen reproach in his
voice. "I wanted to give you a chance, dear; I knew how frail and how
impulsive you were. I wanted you to be sure of yourself. I knew that at
the best it must be a long time before I could come to you, and that
then I couldn't give you money and position and all that. I couldn't
look forward then and see that by now I should have finished the work I
had set myself--and for what? I did write to you--it was a relief to
pour out my love for you in that way; but I never sent the letters. I
said to myself that it wouldn't be fair on you, and so I burned them
all."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Lina shuddered as if he had been telling her the fate of a
live thing. She half stretched out her hand to him and let it fall
again. "I wanted you to tell me. I wanted to know that you loved me. I
always wanted a great deal of telling for me to feel sure that anyone
really loved me; I couldn't believe that people could go on caring for
a girl like me who had nothing but her prettiness, and not so much of
that. And then it was all so terrible and bewildering."</p>

<p>"You mean," he said sternly, "that you wanted me to tell you that I
wasn't a thief."</p>

<p>Lina uttered a sort of groan.</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on me," she said again; "I wasn't made to stand
out against things."</p>

<p>"My dear," he said very gently, "I'm not hard on you, I've no right
to be hard. You were not my promised wife; I'd left you to yourself,
and you couldn't stand alone. My poor little Lina!"</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke for a little while. Presently Lina said--</p>

<p>"Why did I do it? I don't know. Why did I try to make you care for
me at first? Why did I send you that letter--on the steamer? It's all
the same thing; I've no stability or proper pride; I threw myself at
you, and Alec Ansdell knew it; and then I began to feel doubtful and
ashamed."</p>

<p>"I gave you my pledge," he interrupted quickly.</p>

<p>She held up her hand and looked sadly at the ring on her finger.</p>

<p>"Ah! It ended there."</p>

<p>"What makes you wear that?" he asked almost roughly. "There's no
meaning in it now--there was then. Take it off and give it back to
me."</p>

<p>She put up her other hand as if to obey him; then seemed to change
her mind, and held out the hand with the ring on it suddenly to
him.</p>

<p>"Will you take it off," she said, "if you think it's wrong for me to
wear it? Nobody knows except--except Rachel Ansdell. It can't matter
now; and it has a meaning still--for me."</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his and kissed them.</p>

<p>"Be it so!" he said; "in memory of the might have been. It was a
near miss, Lina;" and he gave a harsh, short laugh. "It only meant a
little faith and a year's waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, why am I turned this way and that--like a reed shaken by the
wind?" Lina cried impetuously. "That's how it is; I am a reed. It's my
nature; all I am fit for is to laugh and sing, and look pretty, and be
gay when the sun is shining and people are kind; but when the clouds
gather over and a storm comes, and there are harsh words, I can't stand
up against them."</p>

<p>He drew closer to her, and bending over her, said in a deep moved
voice--</p>

<p>"There's a different look in your eyes--like the look of a child
that has been beaten. Lina, do you mean that he is unkind to you? By
God! if I thought that, I'd say to you now--this very night--'Lina, my
darling, come.'"</p>

<p>The passion with which he said these words thrilled me to the very
heart as I listened--guiltily. It seemed a sort of sacrilege--a wrong
to him to remain there hearing such an entreaty. My impulse was to
start forward and throw my arms round Lina and hold her back from that
precipice. I had the dread lest in a gust of feeling she should be
borne off her feet. But Lina was not so weak as for a moment I feared.
I bent myself anxiously, straining my eyes to watch her every gesture,
and to try and read her thoughts on her face. In the dim light I could
see her look change; she seemed to look back a little, and her eyes
turned upon him in a questioning, startled manner. Her agitation
subsided; her voice was more collected and had a rebuking ring.</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk like that," she said. "I oughtn't to have said
what I did; everything is different now, and the past is past--only a
'might have been.' But I wanted to tell you the truth; I wanted you to
know that I did care for you, and that I wasn't quite so bad as I
seemed. Now you know; and you must not make it harder for me; you must
never say words like that again.</p>

<p>"Then," he said doggedly, "I must never see you any more."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said firmly; "it's better like that. Don't come
anywhere that I am going to be; don't come to the races at Balloo. Mr.
Sabine will be there--and I couldn't bear it. We are going to England
soon, I hope, and that will make things easier. There's nothing for me
but to live the life I've made for myself. I've got to pull my nerves
and my spirits together, and get the best out of the world that I
can--that's what I've been telling myself the last week or two. I've
been running down and getting morbid. You know I never was one of the
plucky ones; I had a feeling that I shouldn't do much till you and I
had met once again. Now it's over, and you understand; and Mr. Sabine
is coming to-morrow. Tell me that you forgive me; and then do what you
did before--go away and leave me to myself."</p>

<p>Her appeal seemed completely to take the passion out of the man. He
spoke very gently and sadly:</p>

<p>"It is you who have to forgive me," he said. "There's nothing in my
heart, Lina, but love and pity and respect for you. I'll do what you
want; I'll not say one more word that can distress you--only,
good-bye."</p>

<p>He gave one long look at her; then, without taking her hand, he
stepped down into the garden, and was lost in the darkness.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI. Lina's Presentiment.</h3>

<p>I DID not make my presence known to Lina then. I felt that the time
to tell her of it would come later. She stood quite still. For a moment
I thought she must be in pain, for suddenly she gave a little cry and
staggered against the verandah post, where she leaned with hands
tightly pressing her bosom, and her eyes closed.</p>

<p>"Lina!" I called, but she took no notice. I sprang to her side, and
put my arms round her, and my hand on hers, which were deadly cold.
Presently she looked at me in a bewildered way, and heaved a sigh of
relief, straightening herself once more.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Rachel? Something came over me--a pain like a knife in
my heart--just for a minute It's all right now."</p>

<p>I questioned her anxiously; but she made light of the attack.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing! I've felt the same sort of thing before, only not
so bad; it was a kind of spasm. Well, that isn't wonderful. I have been
having a scene--a bad scene. I used to fancy I liked scenes. I don't
think now that I shall want a scene ever--ever again in my life." She
paused, and added after a long silence, "I'll tell you about it some
day, Rachel. When one sees the precipice, one doesn't want after all to
fall over it. I didn't need you to hold me back. It's all nonsense
saying that the heart isn't the seat of the emotions," she went on,
looking at me with her wide--open eyes, and speaking with tragi-comic
earnestness. "Why, I could disprove that theory from my own experience.
My heart has ached--ached, when I have been unhappy; and I stabbed my
heart to-night, Rachel, just as surely as if I had driven a dagger into
it. Come along, let us go in."</p>

<p>We none of us saw anything more of Mr. Lyndon. The next morning he
had gone. Mr. Kelmarsh told us at breakfast of his disappearance in the
night, and how they supposed he had taken it into his head to kill his
"Government screw," by riding it straight to Stonehampton, instead of
waiting for the steam launch.</p>

<p>I suppose Milly Robinson guessed the reason; but she had the
discretion to say nothing, which I felt to be a little surprising.</p>

<p>We went back to Stonehampton in the steam launch, and, when we
reached the Robinsons' house, to our surprise found Mr. Sabine lying in
a long chair in the verandah, calmly drinking a brandy and soda. His
steamer had come in some hours before it was expected. After the first
greetings, during which he discovered that Mrs. Sabine was looking
uncommonly well, and that the doctor had been trying to take advantage
of a man who owned a paying gold-reef, Mr. Sabine relapsed into his
normal condition of argumentativeness, falling foul of certain bland
statements of Mr. Robinson's about the forthcoming Corinthian at
Balloo. It soon became very evident that Mr. Sabine's trip had not
improved his temper. Perhaps he had been "sampling" extensively up
North. Certainly he was even more fractious and unreasonable than he
had shown himself at Gundabine; he snapped and bickered about
everything, and with a want of logic in his contradictoriness that was
intensely aggravating. I have a conviction, strengthened by little
things I have heard since, that his brain was partly turned. Lina sat
all the evening in a state of apathy, answering him submissively when
he spoke to her, but taking no notice of his ill-humour. Her flickering
vivacity seemed quenched as effectually as if his captious snarls had
been patent fire extinctors. He insisted upon knowing what gowns she
had been wearing, taking exception to this one and that, and giving
orders that a magnificent pink silk was to be reserved for a rowdy
dance at the Balloo public-house, which, Mr. Robinson said warmly, was
not fit for a lady to go to, but to which Mr. Sabine declared that he
meant to take his wife. He didn't know but that, instead of going to
England, he might stand for the district, and so he would make himself
popular, and give a treat to the free selectors, who he'd be bound
would appreciate Lina's condescension. Milly Robinson was annoyed,
because she wanted Lina to wear the famous pink silk first at a bush
ball she herself was going to give at their station on the first night
of the races, and there was a good deal of cantankerous discussion upon
the whole subject.</p>

<p>There was not room at the Robinsons' for us all, and the next day
Mr. Sabine carried Lina off to the hotel, where, at an enormous
expense, he had engaged all the available accommodation. Alec made his
appearance a few days later, and took me to stay with some friends of
his own. The Robinsons went up to Balloo to prepare for the reception
of their guests at the races. So it happened that we were all more or
less engrossed with our own affairs, and Lina and I did not see much of
each other in the short time that we remained at Stonehampton before
the bush festivities, inwhich everybody was to take part.</p>

<p>Alec just now was deeply exercised in his mind over the engagement
of a stockman for the Island. He had already interviewed several
specimens of the brisk, spry, second-rate stockman--for the Island as a
place of abode was not in favour with the first-rate ones--but none had
taken his fancy so much as a man called Balfour, an ex-gentleman who
had been ruined in squatting, but was otherwise, according to all
accounts, "a thundering smart chap," and an embodiment of all the
virtues connected with the bucolic profession. He was a splendid rider;
would save his wages in breaking in buck-jumpers; a thoroughly knowing
hand among stock, accustomed to managing a coast station, with his head
well screwed on his shoulders, and presumably with class proclivities
which would ensure his siding with the master against the man in the
case of collision, which would, in fact, make him see things generally
from the master's point of view. So Alec reasoned. Flash, perhaps! What
stockman was worth his grub who wasn't a bit flash? Of course there are
always a few shady stories about a fellow who has been sold up; and, by
the way, it wasn't a square and orthodox selling up by a respectable
bank, but a case of mortgage to a rascally Melbourne firm of Jew
money-lenders. Tried to make a fraudulent settlement on his wife, and
to sneak some cattle off the run on the sly while his wife was singing
to the men who were taking delivery at the head station! Well, Watts of
Tarrabilla--and there couldn't be a more honest old fellow between this
and the Gulf of Carpentaria--said the stories were all lies, that
Balfour's wife was a lady, and that it was a moral impossibility for a
Balfour of Kilcummin to run otherwise than straight.</p>

<p>Odd, importing the noblesse oblige principle into the stockmen's
huts; but Alec admitted that he had a lurking belief in "noblesse
oblige," and in the efficacy of the chivalric code even under the
trying conditions of a square-tail muster; by which, in
contradistinction to a "book-muster," is understood the selling of a
station at the rate of so much for every beast actually brought into
the yard, and in such case the temptation on the part of the seller to
pass the same beast twice is obvious.</p>

<p>I felt a little shy of Mrs. Balfour, "the lady" domiciled in the
mud--floored slab hut half-way between the house and the stock-yard. I
foresaw certain difficulties of etiquette which might arise from such
delicate relationship between the hut and the head-station, but Alec
pooh-poohed all trivial considerations; and the end of it was that,
after a good deal of consultation, Balfour of Kilcummin was engaged as
stockman at seventy pounds a year and the usual rations.</p>

<p>Balloo is about forty miles from Stonehampton, and is the township
to which Mr. Lyndon's railway was then in process of being run. We
stopped our buggy at the works, and Mr. Lyndon came to us looking, I
thought, very worn and haggard. He chatted for a little with Alec,
bringing him out a drink, and made me go into his tent and have some
biscuits and tea. He said that he was not going to the races, though he
had given some of his men a holiday that they might attend. Alec and I
knew his reasons for staying away, and we did not ask any questions or
mention the Sabines. When Alec said something jokingly about a
pleasure-trip to Sydney as soon as the railway was finished, Mr. Lyndon
shook his head and looked at us both rather sadly. "No, I'm going to
work hard, and scrunch all the nonsense out of me," he answered. "I
mean to cut the district directly I have done here; and if I can get
the Government to give me a job that will keep me a long time away up
north, right out of the track of civilization, I shall accept it
gladly. I think they owe me something, and I shall ask that
favour."</p>

<p>Why Balloo should have been chosen as the terminus of a railway,
puzzled me immensely when we passed through it that evening on our way
to Balloo Vale--the Robinson's station--which was five miles farther
on. There was a racecourse, to be sure--just now the scene of tipsy
preparations for the morrow's merry-making. We had a view of it as we
drove by--a treeless flat, with some dreary-looking prospectors' holes,
old claims, and mounds of earth in the middle, the visible sign of an
abortive attempt to find gold. It was surrounded by a dense gum forest,
and facing a sort of Tattenham Corner and straight run in was a rickety
wooden stand roofed with boughs and flanked by a seedy refreshment bar,
on which was profanely inscribed in large letters, "Ho, every one that
thirsteth! Come and try Thackwaite's reviving Rum Relish," and by a
booth where a stuffed alligator was advertised as an attraction to
sightseers. The course was marked by poles and little flags. Several of
the rough grass-fed horses were being exercised on it, and Mr.
Thackwaite was evidently already doing a thriving business. Most of the
population of Balloo appeared to have migrated to the racecourse. A
bullock dray loaded with wool bales was drawn up at one side of the
refreshment bar, and a cluster of blacks' gunyahs close by sent up
smoke through the gum-trees and added some elements of excitement to
the scene in the shape of a few naked piccaninnies and frolicsome
gins.</p>

<p>As for Balloo itself, three or four low bush public-houses, each
with a small mob of shepherds and stock-hands on the spree, sprawling
in the verandah, a miserable bark-roofed store in which diggers' tools,
tin billies, zinc buckets, saddle-straps, coloured blankets, and a
variety of such miscellaneous merchandise was exposed for sale,
half-a-dozen tents and a tribe of barking mongrels, and the township's
claims to commercial distinction are fully enumerated. Alec told me
that one of the members of the progressive ministry had a vast
sheep-station a little distance from Balloo, and that it was to
facilitate the carriage of his wool to port that the "railway dodge"
had been accomplished.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when we passed through the sliprails at Balloo
Vale. We did not need to inquire if the Sabines had arrived, for we
could distinctly hear Mr. Sabine's rasping voice in the yard abusing
his men for not taking proper care of the famous racer, which, it
appeared, was "dicky on its legs," but which Mr. Sabine was vowing to
ride all the same, and to win the race with, unless it dropped beneath
him.</p>

<p>We found Lina in the parlour with Mrs. Robinson. She looked pale and
nervous, and was very subdued all the evening. She would not play
cards, and declined to sing when Mr. Sabine came in from the verandah,
where he had been having a noisy discussion with some of the other
gentlemen over the merits of their respective horses, and ordered her
to the piano. Mr. Sabine had a way of making his wife show off before
his friends which Lina resented. She looked at him with a gleam of
spirit when he scolded her, and said in a low tone, "It's a mistake to
throttle a bird if you want it to sing prettily."</p>

<p>He went away crossly, but by-and-by came to me and questioned me
anxiously as to what I thought of Lina. Did I find her looking ill? Did
I know what made her so queer? Was there anything he could buy for her
which would cheer her up? Had I noticed the opal bracelet she was
wearing and which he had ordered for her from Sydney? Certainly Mr.
Sabine was a very odd man.</p>

<p>Later on, when I went to my room, Lina followed me.</p>

<p>"I've had a bad time, Rachel," she said. "Ask Milly Robinson how she
likes Mr. Sabine on closer acquaintance. When Milly comes to marry her
own daughter, I don't think she will pin her faith so entirely on
Debrett as she used. I am sure that Milly begins to doubt the prudence
of investing all one's capital in a gold-reef and an English
gentleman."</p>

<p>Lina's laugh was very pitiful. But she wouldn't let me pity her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter, Rachel. Now I am preaching to you not to be
morbid. And let me tell you, dear, that I'm not afraid of myself any
longer. I was ill and nervous, and now I am better again. You know I've
got such a light nature that trouble doesn't weigh upon me after I've
got used to it. You needn't think that I shall give way under Mr.
Sabine's system of breaking the bruised reed and quenching the smoking
flax. It's his way to have tantrums; he isn't really bad at heart. I
always fancy he would be quite different if he were away from all these
dreadful Australian surroundings. I shall get some good out of my
investment. I always said that I would. I was always determined,
somehow or other, that I would be happy. Besides, I know that this
isn't going to last. Rachel, did you ever have a strong presentiment?
Do you believe in such things?"</p>

<p>She looked at me quite gravely and earnestly. I told her that I did
believe in such things, and asked her what she meant.</p>

<p>"Only that I have a presentiment which all the reasoning in the
world wouldn't shake. It isn't a miserable one at all--quite the
contrary. I've had it the last week or two. I know that some great
change is coming in my life--a good change. I feel like a child that
has been in punishment, don't you know--locked up in a dark closet, and
who has been told that it will be forgiven to-morrow, and taken away to
some new beautiful place where it is to begin all afresh. That's my
presentiment. It means, I think, that we are going away--to England, I
suppose, and that I shall begin a new life there."</p>

<p>We talked on for a while. Lina was in a softened mood. She said no
more bitter things, and when I told her of Mr. Sabine's conversation
with me she seemed touched, and repeated, "He isn't really bad at
heart. You know, Rachel, one reason why I want so to get away is
because I think the heat here--and everything--has a bad effect upon
him. He told me the other day that he had a sunstroke once, and that
his head often feels queer still. And he drinks too much brandy. It
will all be different in England."</p>

<p>Presently Lina said good-night to me. She had not been gone many
minutes when Alec came in. There was an excited look on his face, and
he held an open telegram in his hand.</p>

<p>"They have just brought this over from Balloo," he said; "it has
been passed through from the pilot station. Rachel, what do you think?
The people through whom I bought the Island have telegraphed that
there's a chance of selling it well. I'll be bound that it's old Daniel
Liss who is after the place again. Read."</p>

<p>I took the telegram and read:</p>

<p>"From BURNETT AND NEAME, Stock and Station Agents, Sydney.</p>

<p>"To ALEC ANSDELL, Moonbago Island.</p>

<p>"Wire if still disposed to sell. Have got good offer for the Island
of four pounds ten per head by yard muster. Cattle will not rise higher
at present. We advise you to entertain the offer."</p>

<p>"Well, Rachel," said Alec, "when I was in Sydney I told Burnett and
Neame to be on the look-out for a good purchaser; but I didn't say
anything to you lest nothing should come of it and you might be
disappointed. Now, however, we must make up our minds."</p>

<p>We consulted together late into the night. Alec put before me that,
even under the most advantageous conditions of sale, he would not have
sufficient capital to reinvest in a large station in civilized regions,
and that, though we should probably make our fortune in a very few
years if he took up a run as he would propose in the unsettled district
out west, we might there have to encounter discomforts greater than any
we had as yet faced on the Island. But it was the thought of Gundabine
Bay and the south-easters which decided me. Before we went to bed Alec
wrote out two telegrams which were to be sent from Balloo on the
morrow, on our way to the races.</p>

<p>First--</p>

<p>"From ALEC ANSDELL. "To BURNETT AND NEAME, Sydney.</p>

<p>"Am prepared to entertain offer." Second--</p>

<p>"From ALEC ANSDELL. "To COLIN BALFOUR, Gundabine.</p>

<p>"Arrange to begin work at Island in ten days' time. Important that
you should learn the run as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>Chapter XII. The Tragedy of the Races.</h3>

<p>THE next day rose cool and clear--an unusually favourable day for
bush races. From early dawn Balloo Vale was in a flutter of excitement.
Stockwhips were cracking, blackboys scurrying to and fro, and shouting
to each other in their own language; horses being run into the yard,
and racers being sent off so as to get over the five miles' journey
between the station and the course before the sun was risen. All we in
the house were up betimes too, for the verandah had to be closed in for
the dance in the evening, great heaps of ferns and creepers from the
scrub were lying about, and must be put up for decorations, and there
were the supper and ever so many other domestic details to be seen
to.</p>

<p>Alec went off early, with the sober old Island horse he meant to
ride in the hurdle race, and with the telegrams, one of which was to
decide our fate. Mr. Sabine fussed and grumbled over his own champion
racer, which every one said was in anything but fit condition to run,
and which we all tried to dissuade him from riding that day. But he was
in a state of curious and quite unreasonable excitement, and our
expostulations only made him more obstinate and more rampant still. It
had been settled that he was to drive his wife and me to the course in
his own buggy, and with a pair of horses he had lately bought from a
squatter near. Milly Robinson and her husband started off just before
us in the station waggonette, taking their other guests; and I must own
I felt some keen pangs of regret that Lina and I were not of that
party, when I noticed how restive our horses were and in what an
ungovernable mood Mr. Sabine appeared to be. Nothing happened during
the drive, however, for which the mercy of Providence has to be
thanked, and certainly not Mr. Sabine's coachmanship.</p>

<p>Lina took the front seat beside him and made me go behind, where,
she said, I should feel more comfortable. Her face looked white and a
little agitated as she turned round to me and said, in a low tone,
"Don't be nervous, Rachel. The horses are quite quiet. I want to try
and get Mr. Sabine to promise me that he will not ride in the
hurdle-race, for I am sure it would be better not."</p>

<p>I could hear her pleading, "I wish you wouldn't, Richard. Give it
up, just to please me; I am so afraid of an accident."</p>

<p>He answered her roughly, bidding her hold her tongue and not be a
fool; and he whipped the horses, swearing at them for being "lazy
brutes," though we were jolting over the uneven bush road at a pace
that was extremely alarming. Lina desisted from her entreaties, and sat
very still until we reached the racecourse, when Mr. Sabine pulled up
beside the Robinsons' waggonette, and, after seeing the horses
unharnessed, prepared to leave us for more congenial company.</p>

<p>Lina bent forward. "You will be careful?" she said.</p>

<p>"Look here, Lina," he answered, turning angrily back upon her,
"remember I won't have any scene here. I can take care of myself. You
are to behave like a well-bred woman. If I am thrown I am thrown, and
there's an end to it."</p>

<p>"Did you learn your manners in England or in Australia, Mr. Sabine?"
cried little Mrs. Robinson, flaring up. "If you expect us to behave
like wellbred people, you should set us the example."</p>

<p>I find it quite impossible to write of the humours of those races.
There were some odd people present--types of the life and the country,
and several comic little incidents occurred; but somebody else must be
their chronicler, not I. All the time a feeling of gloom and foreboding
oppressed me. I had no mind for laughter, no appetite for farce. It
seemed strange that Lina should rally me upon my low spirits. As the
day wore on, she herself recovered her elasticity. Mr. Sabine did not
come round again, and there were plenty of people to distract her
thoughts. She had much of the careless irresponsibility of a child
Given sunshine, amusing companions, and gay surroundings--it must be
added also, the absence of her husband--and all her pretty little
gestures and light-hearted sallies came out like opening buds.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such an odd girl as Lina?" said Milly Robinson
aside to me. "I've been perfectly miserable about her, thinking her
heart was broken, and abusing myself for having helped on that
marriage; and now you wouldn't imagine she had been crying in my room
for an hour yesterday, and telling me that she wished that she was
dead."</p>

<p>The great hurdle-race with gentleman riders took place immediately
after luncheon was over. After all the fuss, it was a very poor affair.
Most of the horses, being raw and untrained, balked or bolted--Alec's
among them--and it ended, contrary to all anticipations, in Mr. Sabine
winning the Corinthian Cup. He was noisily jubilant, and brought his
prize to the buggy, making us all drink his health out of it. Then the
cup was filled again and again with champagne and passed round among
the jockeys and the people on the course. It seemed to me that Mr.
Sabine was entering into lively competition with Thackwaite, and that
he made up for the custom his champagne drew away from the bar by
patronizing the rum relishes largely himself. He was to ride again in
the last race but one of the day, and after that we were to put to and
hurry back to Balloo Vale, so that there might be a little time for
resting before the dance. When the horses came out for the race, Milly
Robinson had already gone, Alec driving the waggonette; and, at a
private request of mine, Mr. Robinson engaged to take the reins in our
buggy, and to depose Mr. Sabine to a back seat.</p>

<p>There was nothing much to interest us in this race, for it soon
became evident that Mr. Sabine had not the remotest chance of coming in
among the first. He did not even seem to be trying, for when the other
horses rushed past the winning-post, he was cantering quietly at the
farther side of the course. We were watching the winner being led
round, and collecting our belongings, in preparation for the start
home, when a confused murmur sounded in front of the refreshment bar,
and in a minute or two a small crowd had gathered some little distance
below it. None of our party paid attention to the crowd, which might
very naturally have been attracted by the spectacle of a black fellow
belabouring his gin, or of two chiefs practising with their
boomerangs.</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson and the men buckled the traces. We were all ready.
Somebody called out, "Where's Sabine?" and it was not till Mr.
Robinson's overseer came galloping across towards the buggy that any of
us suspected an accident might have happened to him.</p>

<p>Lina seemed to guess at once. "Mr. Sabine has been thrown!" she
exclaimed, and was hastily moving, when the overseer stopped her.</p>

<p>"No; don't be frightened. Mr. Sabine has come a nasty cropper, but
there doesn't seem to be much amiss. That horse wasn't fit to run
again. He dropped clean down and rolled over, and the cantle of the
saddle has caught your husband and hurt him. He is cut about the face
and shaken, but there are no bones broken."</p>

<p>Mr. Sabine, half carried, half supported, came presently upon the
scene. He was bleeding from a cut on the forehead, and his great
loose--limbed form looked strangely helpless and tottery, but he
appeared to be in as full possession of his senses as could be expected
in a man who had been largely imbibing Balloo champagne and
Thackwaite's rum relish, and who, moreover, had come a nasty
cropper.</p>

<p>"D----the brute!" was all the explanation he gave, as he sank
heavily on the ground, still supported by the men on either side of
him, and then added gruffly to his wife, who bent over him, "I won't
have any scene, mind, Lina; just keep quiet, will you?" and went off
into a dead faint.</p>

<p>The overseer said there was a "sort of doctor" somewhere on the
course, and went to find him, returning after a minute or two with a
cheerful redfaced person, who was, in fact, a retired auctioneer, but
who, having had some training as a veterinary surgeon, and keeping a
supply of various drugs always on stock, physicked impartially the
inhabitants of the township and their horses. The wits of this
gentleman, also, were perhaps not quite so fully collected just now as
they might have been without Thackwaite's agency. Mr. Sabine was soon
brought-to again, though he seemed weak and dazed. It was decided in
consultation with "the sort of doctor" that we ought not to risk the
rough ride back to Balloo Vale till it was quite certain that Mr.
Sabine had received no internal injury, and that it would be better to
take him, for the night at all events, to the nearest house that would
afford accommodation. This proved to be the house of the telegraph
master of Balloo--a swan-wood cottage with two rooms and a skillion.
Thither Mr. Sabine was carried, Lina and I, the doctor, as for
convenience he may be called--his name was Todd--Mr. Robinson and the
overseer following. The telegraph master's wife was away, so he gave us
possession of the bed-room and sitting-room, and took up his quarters
in the skillion.</p>

<p>Mr. Sabine was put to bed, and on examination was pronounced by Mr.
Todd to have nothing the matter with him except a severe shaking. Mr.
Todd had more confidence in himself than we felt in him. He wanted us
to leave his patient entirely in his charge, and was emphatic in his
assurance that it was the simplest case in the world; that there wasn't
the least occasion for us to concern ourselves. If Mrs. Sabine liked to
stay, he wasn't the one for going against a wife's duty, but as for Mr.
Robinson and me, it would be nonsense for us to give up the dance. He'd
bring round embrocations and a cooling draught, and fix up Mr. Sabine
comfortably for the night; and would give his word that he'd be all
right, so to speak, in the morning.</p>

<p>I determined that I would keep Lina company, and bade Mr. Robinson
explain things to Alec, and not let him be uneasy or think of coming to
me that night. I was very anxious that Alec, who thoroughly enjoyed a
dance, should not be deprived of his fun by the untoward occurrence.
Mr. Todd seemed to know what he was about, and we had none of us the
slightest suspicion of there being anything seriously wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson was reluctant to leave, but the thought of his duties
as host weighed upon him; and he knew that his wife would be vexed if
he did not turn up. So he had a little talk to the telegraph master,
got us what comforts he could for the night, and, giving the overseer
directions to remain within hail, drove off.</p>

<p>Mr. Todd brought his embrocations, bound up the sufferer's hurts,
administered the draught, and departed, serenely declaring that all was
well. Mr. Sabine by now seemed very much himself again. He would not
let Lina out of his sight, and was a little more ill-tempered than
usual; which, however, I thought, on the whole, an encouraging
sign.</p>

<p>The night was strange and dreary. A drizzling rain fell. The wind
got up and blew in melancholy gusts round the rickety cottage, making
the ill-fitting windows rattle, and tossing the boughs of the gum-trees
outside. A public-house was not very far off, and with the rain and the
wind came the sound of the men singing and shouting over their liquor.
Lina stayed mostly in the inner room with her husband, who tossed about
restlessly, and who seemed still in a queer, excited frame of mind, now
abusing this person and now that one, and now the horse which had
thrown him, vowing that as soon as he could get up he would go out and
put a bullet through the animal. The partition was only of wood, and
when he spoke loudly I could not help hearing what he said. The parlour
in which I sat was a bare, comfortless sort of apartment, with a
stretcher--like couch, cushioned in red blanketing, a square table
covered with a terrible flowered oilcloth, a rocking-chair, and a few
horse-hair seats, some flaring prints, and a guttering kerosene lamp.
There were no books or anything to distract one's thoughts. Lina came
in several times and sat on the rocking-chair; but every time she did
so Mr. Sabine called her back with querulous imperativeness, or perhaps
an oath. About ten o'clock the telegraph master brought us in some tea
and a coarse loaf, and laid a roll of red blanketing on the stretcher,
saying that he would not come in again to disturb us, but would settle
himself in the skillion, and that if we wanted anything we were to call
him. He was a long, gaunt--looking man, with hollow cheeks, a scrubby
iron-grey beard, and a sepulchral way of speaking. He did not seem able
to grasp the situation, or the fact that Lina was the wife of the man
who had been thrown from his horse. He evidently found it impossible to
believe that she was a married woman at all, for he kept calling her
"Missy," and addressing me when there was a question of Mr. Sabine's
wants.</p>

<p>By-and-by I lay down on the stretcher, and covered myself with a red
blanket. I did not mean to go to sleep, but I suppose I must have
dropped off. Even then the echo of Mr. Sabine's imprecations mingled
with my dreams. Then there came an odd fancy that Lina and Mr. Lyndon
and I were sailing down some wonderful Eastern river, through towns
where the houses were of ivory glittering with precious stones, and the
trees dropped golden fruit, and Lina was singing--</p>

<p>"Ah, dem golden slippers!--golden slippers!<br>
I'se gwine to wear to walk in de golden street."</p>

<p>Yes, Lina was singing. I sat up and listened, wide awake, and there
came over me that feeling of exquisite melancholy which her voice
always brought. When she had finished the song, I knocked at the door,
and she came out, her yellow hair loosened about her face, and her blue
eyes heavy and dim.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I awoke you, Rachel; but I can't help going off myself,
I am so tired, and Mr. Sabine gets cross if I don't answer him. I
thought that if I sang it might send him to sleep."</p>

<p>He called her in while she was speaking, telling her crossly to go
on, and adding that it wasn't often he asked her to keep awake, and
that she might for once do something to oblige him. So she went back
and sang on--negro melodies, and "Wallabi Jo," and "The Stockman's
Whistle," and all her quaint, simple things, till at dawn he dropped
asleep, and she came and laid down on the stretcher and slumbered out
of utter weariness.</p>

<p>The telegraph master brought in our breakfast. Then the overseer
came and went in to see Mr. Sabine, talking with him several minutes.
Presently he returned to Lina and me, as we stood by the window,
watching for any sign of the buggy from Balloo Vale or of Alec riding
down, and said to her, "Mr. Sabine thinks he would like to get up and
dress himself a bit. I'll call in the old man, and we'll see to him.
Mrs. Sabine, you just go and take a little turn outside; it'll do you
good after your wakeful night."</p>

<p>Lina and I went out and wandered up the Balloo road a little way. We
were not many minutes absent. When we came back to the parlour, the
door into the bedroom was shut, and we could hear the overseer and the
telegraph master talking in a low tone. Lina observed carelessly that
Mr. Sabine must certainly be shaving, he was so quiet; and seating
herself in the rocking-chair began to swing to and fro, while she
softly hummed a waltz tune.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the dance went off last night," she said. "I'm sorry
we missed it. Perhaps I shall never have the chance of being at a bush
dance again. Rachel, I was quite right about my presentiment. Mr.
Sabine's mood has entirely changed. He is as eager now to get away as I
am. He's like that, you know. He had a freak for staying, and now
that's passed suddenly, and he says that he will not stop a day longer
in the country than he need, and that he is going straight down from
here to put the superintendent in charge at Akobaora, and will take our
passages for the next mail boat. He talks of stopping in Japan,
America, Italy--all kinds of places. I thought of my presentiment last
night when he was talking and I was singing, and the rain was pattering
down on the roof. It is really--</p>

<p>"Good-bye, children, I'm gwine to go</p>

<p>Where the rain doan fall and the win doan blow."</p>

<p>She caught up the refrain with her little light laugh. "But that's a
long way farther than the other side of the world, Rachel. I don't mind
how much it rains and blows so that I am on that side and not on this
one."</p>

<p>Just then, while she was still rocking herself to and fro, the door
of the inner room opened, and the telegraph master came forward
carefully and slowly, closing the door again behind him. He stood
looking at us silently for a minute, a grim herald of evil tidings,
gaunt, solemn, and with a shocked, hesitating expression, as if he were
under a painful responsibility which he knew not how to discharge.</p>

<p>His face frightened us both. Lina stopped short in her swaying
motion, and rose from the chair.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said. "Why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>The man turned blundering and helpless from Lina to me, and then
back to Lina again. "Mrs. Sabine," he began--"Missey. Which of you is
Mrs. Sabine? The overseer said I must break it to you. They're in
there, the overseer and Mr. Todd. Todd came just as you were gone. He
is awfully cut up. He thinks you'll blame him for being so cock-sure.
But it's a dispensation from the Lord, Mrs. Sabine, and that's what I
told Todd."</p>

<p>Lina waved the man impatiently aside. "Mr. Sabine is worse," she
said, quietly. "You needn't beat about the bush. Let me go in to
him."</p>

<p>She was moving to the door; but the telegraph master stretched out
his arms and barred her passage. "They said I mustn't let you go in,
Mrs. Sabine. You can't do any good. He's dead--your husband's dead.
He'll never speak to you again. He was more hurt yesterday than Todd
knew. There's been a bleeding inside. When he tried to get up, it broke
out afresh; and all of a sudden, while we were dressing him, he dropped
back and died."</p>

<p>As, with unconscious brutality, the man jerked out his blunt
statement, Lina seemed to stiffen to the rigidity of stone. It was as
if she had been petrified, or suddenly frozen with horror. She uttered
no word, but only gazed at him with eyes that were wide and glassy. I
sprang to her and called her name. Suddenly she gave a sharp, piercing
cry. A spasm of extreme pain distorted her face, her hands clutched
wildly at her bosom as on that night in the verandah at Mr. Kelmarsh's,
when I in my foolish thoughtlessness did not suspect that she might be
suffering the agony of mortal disease. She staggered forward away from
my supporting arms, and fell in a heap to the ground. My scream called
Mr. Todd and the overseer from the bedroom, where the cowards had been
waiting for this bungling idiot to break the news they did not dare to
tell. We lifted Lina up and laid her on the sofa. We tried in vain to
restore her to consciousness. She neither stirred nor breathed. Her
heart was quite pulseless.</p>

<p>I could not believe for a long time that Lina was dead. I kneeled by
her and chafed her hands, and put my lips to her lips, which were cold
already. Her blue eyes gazed back into mine, soulless and unknowing.
Her yellow hair lay like a web of gold on the coarse red blanket. The
look of pain had gone as if by a miracle from her face. There was
nothing but those unanswering eyes to tell me that her spirit had
fled.</p>

<p>Horses' hoofs and the clattering of the buggy sounded outside. Alec
came in and drew me away. Mr. Robinson and Milly followed. It was
Milly's frantic sobs and questions that made me realise the truth.</p>

<p>Yes, Lina was dead. The husband and wife had gone upon their
journey. She who in life had withered in his harsh presence was bidden
to follow him in death. But they had gone to that furthermost country
in which jibes and bickering cease, and where there is no marrying nor
giving in marriage.</p>

<p>I wish that I were not telling a true story. If I were writing a
romance, there should be no inappropriate double tragedy, there should
be no loose threads, no irrelevant episode, no anticlimax to this
rambling tale of our Island days. The order of Lina's release from her
irksome bonds should not be her death signal. She should live and be
happy as Tom Lyndon's wife, and I would drop the curtain upon this
Island play to the sound of wedding bells. ... But I am only telling
the things that happened. I am not writing a romance--and Lina is
dead.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII. Balfour of Kilcummin.</h3>

<p>I will not dwell any more on the sad story of Lina Sabine. It was a
shadow which came upon us and made us very melancholy; but, after a
little while, the blackness of the shadow passed, and we began to live
our own life again, and were happy in each other, and deeply interested
in the new turn of fortune and the prospects for the future. The Island
looked very home-like when we saw it once more, and I confess that for
the moment I forgot the terrors of Gundabine Bay and the mosquitoes,
and that I felt a queer little pang at the thought of leaving our first
married home when we had as yet barely taken root in the soil. I think
it was a long letter from Loftus which we got at Stonehampton that
almost confirmed our wavering decision.</p>

<p>Brown was waiting for us with horses at the pilot station, so we did
not stop there, but rode down home at once; besides, Alec wanted to
look about him, and to get things in order for Colin Balfour, the
gentleman stockman. Alec intended to make a proviso that the new
purchaser should keep him on if he proved satisfactory. The grass was
all green and high where the fire had laid the country waste; the old
charred tussocks round the house had sprouted afresh, and the scorched
gum-trees had put forth new suckers. Everybody and everything seemed
glad to see us; Christo, the Angora goat, ran up bleating from the
herd; Monte and Beaufort and the bull-pup came out leaping and barking,
and Rose, surrounded by puppies, now in advanced stage of gambolling,
beat her tattoo of welcome on the boards of the causeway; gaunt Mrs.
McGilray stood by a brand-new hen-coop placed conspicuously under the
kitchen window, and pointed with a grim smile to the first brood of
Christianized chickens which the Island had in our time produced, while
dapper little Mr. McGilray, when questioned by Alec as to whether
"things had gone all right," replied with his perky formula, "And what
for no, sir?"</p>

<p>There were letters awaiting us from Burnett and Neame, the stock and
station agents, to whom Alec had in the meantime written fully. As he
had suspected, Mr. Daniel Liss was the would-be buyer. He was willing
to agree in the main to Alec's terms, and even to a "yard muster," and
the agents suggested that he should pay Alec a visit, in which the sale
might be definitely arranged.</p>

<p>We talked it all over that night as we sat in the verandah. Alec
explained to me the pros and cons of the situation. There was the
certainty of his being able to clear out of the Island at a
considerable profit, for he had bought when prices were much lower, and
moreover he had bought by book muster, and was sure that there were
many more cattle on the station than the nominal number of the herd.
Then there was the superiority of an inland run over a coast one--coast
country being proverbially bad for fattening beasts, and the
probability of squatting property falling in the market, and many other
considerations, all of which had been weighed by us over and over again
since the arrival of Messrs. Burnett and Neame's proposal; but we
always came to the same conclusion, and so Alec wrote a telegram
inviting Mr. Liss to come over when he pleased, and sent Brown off with
it on the following morning.</p>

<p>Alec himself went to the South End to meet the new stockman, and I
watched with some anxiety for his return with the descendant of the
Balfours of Kilcummin, the embodiment of the noblesse oblige
principle.</p>

<p>He was undoubtedly a very handsome man, this Colin Balfour; but I
did not think that he showed any distinct traces of ancient lineage, or
of high civilization, being rather the splendid animal type than that
of the Bayard--firm-knit, athletic frame, deep-set bold black eyes,
large rather coarse features, curling whiskers, and a general look of
devilry and self--assurance--altogether more suggestive of backwoods
adventure than feats of chivalry. He took off his hat to me with a
flourish, and when Alec said to him, "You must make yourself as
comfortable as you can at the hut, Balfour, and I advise you to get
your feed from the kitchen till you've settled down a bit," the kind of
military salute he gave, and the proud but cheerful humility of his
"All right, sir," were both effective and touching.</p>

<p>"A dash of the swell about him; but I think he's going to do,
Rachel," said Alec. "He has a magnificent hand on a horse--I put him on
that half-broken chestnut colt--and there's no doubt that he knows what
he is about with stock. I gave him a hint that there was a chance of my
selling the station, but he did not seem at all dissatisfied; in fact,
rather took to the idea of a muster--I gave him to understand, of
course, that I would make it worth his while to scour the gullies for
stray calves. He is keen as mustard about learning the run at once. I
shall start him on Monday, and I think, Rachel, that to-morrow you
might just go down to the hut, and see if anything can be done to make
it a little more comfortable for his wife. Rame is going to bring her
over as soon as the wind changes."</p>

<p>The next day, which was Sunday, Alec and I went down to the hut.
Before knocking we stood a minute or two, and looked at Mrs. Balfour's
future abode. It was a rough slab building, with chinks between the
slabs wide enough to let in a good deal of daylight--two rooms and a
lean-to, and a verandah, with a mud floor supported by gum-saplings
which had the bark still upon them. At the back there was a bark shed
and a primitive fireplace, with a boiler and a camp oven standing in
it, each raised upon two stones.</p>

<p>Balfour opened the door for us. He looked handsomer than ever in his
loose crimson Crimean shirt and riding breeches. He had evidently been
preparing his Sunday dinner, for there was a piece of smoking salt beef
in a tin dish on the table, and a damper baking in the ashes of the
wide wooden fireplace. Alec talked to him in a friendly unceremonious
way, as if he had been any ordinary stockman; but I found it impossible
to be unconstrained with him. I could not find any fault with the
man--he was respectful, good-tempered, and apparently most anxious to
accommodate himself to circumstances; but, nevertheless, from the first
I took a dislike to him, and I felt that his wife was to be
compassionated.</p>

<p>The hut looked quite as uninviting within as it did externally. A
rude bunk was fixed underneath the unglazed window; there was a table
of iron-bark wood standing upon two stumps in the centre of the room,
two or three fixtures of slab, a bench, some tools, a squatter's chair
of crude design, some tin and iron cooking utensils, and some other
necessaries completed the visible furniture of the place. We ventured
to hope that Mrs. Balfour would bring a few small comforts over with
her from Gundabine, and that she would not be disheartened at the sight
of the hut.</p>

<p>"It is a very good hut, as huts go," said Mr. Balfour, in an
off-hand way, "and, if a man has come down to be a stockman, he must
take stockman's fare. My wife has got used to roughing it, Mrs.
Ansdell, and knows what to expect; she lived in a tent on the diggings
for six months. What matters most to her is the being with me. You
wouldn't think it, perhaps, but though I've brought her nothing but
misfortune, I honestly believe that if she had it all to do over again,
she'd choose me before any man in the world."</p>

<p>I pitied Mrs. Balfour more than ever.</p>

<p>Alec offered to let McGilray take a day or two at the hut, to put up
some canvas lining and knock together a cupboard for Mrs. Balfour's
convenience, and we went away, after a little talk on station matters,
in which Balfour delighted Alec still more by his readiness,
understanding, and regard for his master's interest.</p>

<p>"That's the man I've been wanting for years," said Alec,
enthusiastically, and he poured forth an eulogium on Balfour's virtues
and qualifications, which I silently hoped that experience would
justify.</p>

<p>After this I did not see much of Balfour, though I heard a great
deal about his various excellences. He went off exploring the run,
camping out and making acquaintance with the cattle under the guidance
of Alec and Brown. We at the head station turned our attention to Mrs.
Balfour's comfort, which did not appear to weigh heavily upon the mind
of her husband, and I warmed Mrs. McGilray to a grim enthusiasm, and
got her to consent to the removal of some small pieces of furniture,
and of some pots and pans and so forth, and to help in cleaning up the
place and making it habitable. Altogether, the hut presented a much
more pleasant appearance than might have been expected when the day
came for Mrs. Balfour's arrival.</p>

<p>She was a worn, thin woman, who had once had a second-rate
prettiness--clear, grey eyes, a sharp nose, a full-lipped slightly
coarse mouth, high cheek-bones, and a sallow brown skin. Probably she
had once been fair and plump, but that was all gone now. When she
dressed in the afternoon she had a look of faded smartness, and her
manner to me was portentously formal and fine, and so aggressively
resentful of patronage that after a while I dropped my well-meant
attentions, which I found were ungraciously received. Mrs. Balfour was
a disappointment, and Alec was obliged to own that, however admirable
Balfour might be as a stockman, socially speaking I should not derive
much benefit from his wife. We began to have doubts as to Mrs.
Balfour's claims to gentility; indeed, it must be owned a vague
distrust had crept up in our minds about the Balfours of Kilcummin
generally; but we reflected that perhaps Mr. Balfour had left home when
he was a boy, and had married beneath him. At any rate, we did not
openly give vent to our suspicions.</p>

<p>One thing was quite clear: Mrs. Balfour, sulky, morose, and
third-rate as she was, cherished a genuine, almost slavish devotion for
her handsome husband. I am sure that he was not kind to her. There was
a look in her eye when he was by which made me fancy that she was
afraid of him; but for all that, I believe that she would have gone
through fire and water to do his bidding.</p>

<p>There was another inmate of the hut who from the first roused my
interest. On the morning after Mrs. Balfour's arrival, I was skimming
my milk-pans in the dairy, when an indistinct sound caused me to look
round at the slit in the slabs, over which a loose cheese-cloth blind
usually hung, and which had been cut in the wall of the dairy for the
purposes of ventilation. There I saw poked forward under the
cheese-cloth a queer little brown face with two bright melancholy eyes,
a fringe of wiry black curls, a pinched little mouth, and a look at
once anxious, alert, wobegone, and monkeyish. The face was tiny enough
to have been that of a baby, but it was old enough for the face of an
old, old woman.</p>

<p>I asked the apparition who it was, and what it wanted, and bade it
come round to the door. The cheese-cloth waved over the aperture again,
and in a minute there stood in front of me, with two tin billies in her
hand, a wee old-woman-child, who, from her height and make, I might
have guessed to be six years old, but whose demure and experienced air
gave me the impression that she must be quite grown up. She was dressed
in a coarse linsey frock, very much mended, her hair was brushed as
neatly as its fuzzy nature would permit, and her face was clean, but
her little hands were horny and rough with hard work, her boots were
going to pieces, and her spindle legs were bare.</p>

<p>The child held out her billies.</p>

<p>"Please, I'm come for milk. I'm Wunkie Blake, Balfour's kid."</p>

<p>I filled the billies, and then I asked the child how, if Mr. and
Mrs. Balfour were her father and mother, she came to be called
Blake.</p>

<p>"They ain't my father and mother," she cried fiercely; "I haven't
got no father nor mother, and I wouldn't have Bully Balfour for my dad,
not if you was to whop me all day and night." She set her little teeth
savagely together, and tossed her black mane.</p>

<p>"And so you don't like Mr. Balfour?" I asked. The child gave her
head a queer little solemn shake.</p>

<p>"My word! I believe you," she said. "It's this way, you see. Mrs.
Balfour was married to my dad afore he died, and afore she married
Balfour. She ain't nothing to me, and I ain't nothing to her. He jes
gev me up to her, did my dad, and she's got to keep me till I can go
out to service, 'less somebody 'ud 'dopt me."</p>

<p>A few questions elicited further particulars of Wunkie's
history.</p>

<p>"Her 'born' name was 'Lizabeth. Didn't know how she came by Wunkie.
'Spected she got it at the diggings and it stuck. Lived at the diggings
when she was a little kid, and till Duffey cracked up. Duffey took
charge of her while Mom went out governessing. Mom had never taught her
nothing. Duffey taught her to cook and clean and make pie--melon
jam--was there any pie-melons on the Island? No. That was a bad job.
Pie-melons kept Balfour pretty sweet--for him. When Duffey cracked up
she was took to Balfour's, and, my word, weren't they fine! A deal too
fine for her; she liked the blacks' camp better. Then Balfour cracked
up too." In poor Wunkie's experience it seemed a law of nature that her
protectors must "crack up." Since that epoch it appeared that she had
been acting as a sort of drudge to Mr. and Mrs. Balfour. "'Twas she
that cooked the meat and bread. Lor, she could make splendid bread.
Duffey had done the baking for the diggings, and she scrubbed Bully
Balfour's moleskins and made and mended her own poor little
garments--when they gev her any stuff. She 'spected she was
thirteen--wasn't anyway fixed on it. She wished somebody 'ud 'dopt her
and get her learned something. There was a man on the diggings as said
he'd 'dopt her and send her to school whenever he hit on a nugget; but
he cracked up too, and then he went off in a rush to the new diggings.
And now she must go down with the milk, or Bully Balfour would whop
her. No; she wasn't whopped such a great lot--only when the devil got
inside her and she cheeked Mr. Balfour. She 'spected the devil got
inside most folks when they was kids, and whopping once in a way wasn't
much odds to anybody"; and, with this philosophica sentiment, Wunkie
departed.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of the philosopher about Wunkie. She took life
as she found it. When it was her fate to be whopped, she accepted it
with stoical fortitude, and, I am afraid, whopping was not unfrequently
her portion. The ruder responsibilities of the household appeared to
rest upon Wunkie's tiny shoulders. As far as I could make out, Mrs.
Balfour put her hand to none of the rough work, but confined herself to
the concoction of tasty dishes for her husband's dinner, and general
attendance upon him, which, as Balfour was often camping out and at all
times never home till the evening, did not amount to much. It was
Wunkie who scoured and swept, scrubbed, baked, and boiled. My
indignation was roused one day by seeing her at the wood heap outside
the hut trying to wield an axe which her utmost effort could scarcely
lift to the level of her tiny head, and I went within and remonstrated
with her guardian upon the tasks which were laid upon one so feeble.
Mrs. Balfour, who was lounging in the squatter's chair reading a Family
Herald, received my expostulation with frigid dignity. She was obliged
to me for troubling about Wunkie; and if I could make Wunkie obey her
she would be still more obliged. Wunkie knew perfectly well that she
wasn't asked to chop wood or to do anything that was beyond her
strength; but, out of sheer perverseness, Wunkie always wanted to
meddle with what she was told to let alone; and she'd rather chop up a
tree than sit down quietly and do her sewing. Wunkie had been bred up
to defy her by some people called Duffey, who were relations of
Wunkie's mother, and who she had expected would provide for the child.
Mrs. Balfour proceeded to tell me how Mr. Blake, her first husband, had
been employed in a Government office, and how an unjust ministry had
denied his widow's claim to a pension, and how Wunkie, who was not even
of her blood, had been left on her hands without a sixpence. I
suggested that this was not poor Wunkie's fault, and delicately
deplored her forlorn condition and want of education, to which Mrs.
Balfour replied that Wunkie was a child of low tastes, and that when,
in the day of their prosperity, they had treated her like a lady, she
had run off into the bush and had actually been found in the blacks'
camp. I did not dare to allude to the whoppings, for Wunkie had bound
me over to silence; but when I diplomatically hinted at Mr. Balfour's
sentiments towards the child, Mrs. Balfour flushed, and exclaimed in
energetic defence of her husband that it could not be supposed a man
would feel affection for a cross-grained creature who was no kin to him
and repaid all his kindness with insolence. So there was nothing to be
done for poor Wunkie but to encourage her to come up to the house when
she could, and to try and civilize her by dint of precept and example.
The child had instincts of tidiness, and her gratitude was intense when
I presented her with a pair of boots and some stockings, and when
between us we manufactured a substitute for the dirty, torn linsey
frock. She would steal up over the brow of the hill when she had done
the work required of her at the hut, and would sit on the edge of the
verandah, silently watching me as I sewed, and every now and then
uttering a solemn ejaculation on the subject nearest her heart, "Lor, I
wish I could get holt of somebody as 'ud 'dopt me."</p>

<p>The Balfours had been with us several weeks before anything was
settled as to the sale of the station. Balfour learned the run with
extraordinary quickness, and nothing could have been more satisfactory
than his zeal as a stockman. Alec declared that he knew already to
which particular camp a stray beast belonged, and was on quite intimate
terms with a mob of "scrubbers" which had resisted all Tillidge's
attempts to bring them into the yard. Extensive operations were being
carried on among the stock in view of the impending "yard muster." Our
mail was now fetched regularly across, for who could tell what it might
not contain? and the pilot station did a brisk business in telegrams
between Alec, Mr. Liss, and Burnett and Neame. Mr. Liss was a long time
in making his appearance at the Island, and seemed to prefer letting
the agents write reams of stipulations to settling matters by an
interview. Alec was certain that his objection to visiting the Island
arose from his horror of meeting me. Mr. Liss's aversion to women was a
stock joke in the district. He had been heard to assert solemnly that
he had never tasted wine or spirits, had never smoked tobacco, and had
never kissed a woman. Alec had several stories of Mr. Liss and his
queer ways. He had come out a boy emigrant, had worked his way from
nothing, and money--making was his passion. Little by little he had
bought stations everywhere. They returned him good interest, and he was
always on the look-out for paying investments. He never spent an
unnecessary halfpenny upon himself, and though he had been known,
unsolicited, to subscribe liberally in charity, he invariably refused
when pressed to do so, on the plea that women and babies and folks that
hadn't the gumption to save or earn, were nought to a hard-working,
honest fellow like himself. He was the terror of his various
superintendents, for he had an inconvenient way of sneaking up and down
between his different stations as a steerage passenger in the steamer,
and of pouncing upon his managers unawares. It was related how, upon
one occasion, when he came up north to take delivery of a station for
which he had paid a large sum in cash, the agents, anxious to do honour
to so wealthy a client, went to the steamer to receive him; and how,
after vainly searching among the cabin passengers, they found him at
last in the steerage, very shabbily clad, and disputing with the
steward over some trifling overcharge.</p>

<p>He turned up at last on the Island, giving us no previous warning.
It was full moon, and he swam the Narrows by himself on horseback.
Early one morning I was churning, and Alec had come himself with the
milk to see how I was getting on, when McGilray looked in to say that
Mr. Liss was in the yard and wanted to speak to the master. Alec went
out, and I heard him welcoming the new-comer and pressing hospitality
upon him, which, however, Mr. Liss stolidly declined.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, in a dogmatic, nasal voice, "I'm willing to go
over the station-books and to look about the run with you, and I'll
come up by--and-by and have a talk over business. But I'm not going
inside parlouring. I don't care about going in among women. I don't
care about 'if you please' and 'thankye' and company manners and
rubbish. Conduct your business on commercial principles and let the
women alone, that's been my rewle through life."</p>

<p>I could not help taking a peep through the cheese-cloth at the
master of our fate. I saw a short, square, stumpy man in drab moleskins
and tan gaiters, with a loose "jumper" coat buttoned over a collarless
Crimean shirt. He might have been sixty years of age, but was hale and
well preserved. His face was large for his frame, shrewd, slightly
humorous, with small ferret-like eyes closely set together, a coarse
iron-grey beard standing out like a fringe, a long, smooth, upper-lip,
and a narrow-lipped mouth turned down at the corners. Alec still urged
him to enter, rallying him good-naturedly on his misogynist tendencies,
and promising him that if he would stay with us, he should have his
meals served separately in the office, and should not be required to do
any "parlouring." But Mr. Liss shook his head doggedly.</p>

<p>"Well, sir!" He put out his hand, and, as if to emphasize his words,
tapped Alec three times on the shoulder with his short, thick fingers.
"It ain't my fault if you and your missus don't know old Dan'l Liss's
some folk call 'em cranks--I don't. Many's the time I've camped outside
a cultivation paddock fence and made my dinner off roasted corn because
I wouldn't go 'parlouring.' If you say any more I'll just swim over the
Narrows again, and we're off the sale. I'm going to camp down by the
stockyard, and I've just come up to buy a bit of meat and a pound or
two of flour, and now good-day for the present."</p>

<p>Mr. Liss had his way and walked off, having first seen the flour and
meat weighed, and having paid for them on the spot. Alec came back
laughing and half annoyed, but there was nothing to be done. Mr. Liss
camped out and baked his own damper and boiled his own beef. He came up
later in the day, and I retired into the background lest his
sensibilities should be jarred by the presence of a woman. He had his
talk with Alec in the office, and after some haggling they came to
terms, and he virtually bought the Island. Very soon the muster began.
Extra hands were got over from the mainland, and the place became a
scene of bustle and excitement. Every day about four o'clock there
sounded in the distance a confused roar like that of the sea, which, as
it came nearer, resolved itself into the bellowing of beasts, the
shouting of men, and the cracking of stockwhips. Every day when the
noise began I saw Mr. Liss mount on the brow of the hill and gaze
eagerly towards the moving wave of heaving backs and tossing horns;
then he would scurry down to the stockyard, take up his position on the
top rail, calculate the number of cattle, and note the sum of money it
represented. It was an anxious time--those first few days of the
muster. If there were fewer cattle on the Island than we supposed, we
might have good reason to repent our bargain. Every hundred calves
meant the addition of &pound;450 to our modest capital. No wonder that
I listened excitedly to the distant murmur of the incoming mob, and
felt my heart rise and sink in proportion to the volume of sound.
Wunkie Blake, who happened to be seated on the edge of the verandah on
the first of these critical occasions, readily divined the situation.
"Lor, I know all about it. It's like fishing for craws, you don't know
how many are coming up. Haven't I heard Bully Balfour talk! He says
you'll have a big sale. I heard him say that there was such a lot of
dry gullies and queer corners in this 'ere run that you could plant a
mob of beasts and nobody be none the wiser. Look here," pursued Wunkie,
solemnly, "you look out for Bully Balfour, or he'll be up to one of his
tricks. You bet he will."</p>

<p>Wunkie would not explain her warning, which I duly reported to Alec.
But Alec was highly elated, and Balfour's capacity and energy even
surpassed his hopes. He seemed to have a perfect instinct as to the
whereabouts of "cleanskins," or unbranded calves, so Alec said. All was
going well. Each day Wunkie, who was on the look-out, would rush up
with the intelligence that there was a "whacking mob" coming. "Old Liss
is beginning to look a little blue," Alec said. "He'll have to fork out
more than he expected, and it goes against the grain with him to pay
&pound;4 10s. for a calf toddling by its mother. He's sorry now that he
didn't insist on a book muster. By Jove, I'd no idea the Island was
such a good breeding run."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV. The Adoption of Wunkie.</h3>

<p>THE mustering had been going on for a fortnight, when there came two
or three days of heavy rain, and the damp brought on Mr. Liss a severe
attack of lumbago. He refused even still, however, to leave his tent,
and would have no one to attend on him, though he allowed us now to
send him down cooked food and an occasional delicacy in the shape of
pudding or an egg, grimly observing that we were taking it out of him
in the price of calves.</p>

<p>One day all the men and blackboys were out, Mrs. McGilray was busy
with her week's wash, and there was no one but myself to take the
little custard pudding and fresh loaf which had been prepared for Mr.
Liss. I started down the hill in fear and trembling, not knowing how I
should summon courage to approach the lion in his lair. Half-way down,
however, an idea struck me, and seeing Wunkie alone in the verandah of
the hut, I called to her and bade her come with me.</p>

<p>Wunkie looked very much more prepossessing now than she had done on
her arrival. The milk and abundance of food had filled out her pinched
cheeks and made her seem more child-like. Her new frock and tidy boots
added considerably to her appearance, and though she had lost none of
her quaintness, her frequent visits to the house and Mrs. McGilray's
and my exhortations had tended somewhat to civilize her. As we walked
along, I could not help thinking of a little conversation between Alec
and Mr. Liss which had taken place a short time before they had
compared their respective tallies of the day's square-tailing. Alec had
duly repeated the conversation, and it was somewhat after this
fashion:--</p>

<p>"And how are you getting on with your stations generally, Liss?"
Alec asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir; just keeping my head above water in these bad times,"
said Mr. Liss.</p>

<p>"I only wish that I could keep my head as well above water," said
Alec. "But now tell me, Mr. Liss, don't you find life very lonely? I
often wonder how it was you never got married."</p>

<p>"Well, sir"--and Mr. Liss's three fingers tapped Alec's
shoulder--"the mistake of my life. sir."</p>

<p>"But you're a fine man yet," said Alec, "and you've got lots of
money. You don't give yourself a chance. There are plenty of nice girls
would be only to ready to say yes to you."</p>

<p>"Too late, sir; too late," replied Mr. Liss, mournfully. "When I was
a youngster I hadn't got the education or opportunity or the
inclination for parlouring, and now I haven't got the courage to tackle
women. Never was used to 'em, sir. Never had any of my own to speak of.
I started out here on an outside sheep station at ten shillings a week,
and didn't speak to a white woman for twenty-five years. Too late to
begin now."</p>

<p>"Try it, Liss," said Alec. "I'll lay the Island that I could find
you a wife."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I dessay. Marry me for my money and for what they could
get out of me. That's about it."</p>

<p>"But what the deuce are you going to do with your money?" said Alec.
"Even you can't last for ever, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, sir; I've not made up my mind, sir. There's a little girl I
once met when I was knocking about. I wanted to buy a lot of bulls--no
one at home when I asked for the boss--all away at the races, not
expected back till to-morrow. I didn't want to go inside parlouring,
and I was wishing little missy good-day; but, bless you, no, sir; she
wouldn't hear of that. She was no more than twelve or thirteen--such a
sweet, pretty little maid. She made me come inside, and nothing would
do but she must show me her garden and her cats, and I must have a game
at b&eacute;zique with her--so nice and fetching. I wished I had a
dozen like her. You see I was used to big rough ones in my young days.
And I stayed with the little maid and spent such an evening as I've
dreamed of, but never had the like before nor since. I've often thought
of little Jane. She's married now, with a squad of youngsters--married
to a flash chap that chucks away his money, and would chuck away mine,
too, if he had the chance. I go to see her sometimes--always pleasant
she is, no humbug; she never asked me to lend or to hand over. Some
day, perhaps, she'll find a nice little balance at the banker's, all
tied up on herself--not too much, for the flash husband to pitch about,
but enough to make her remember old Dan'l Liss. If I could come across
a child like that one--a little thing, mind you--Janie's size--and one
that I could keep from marrying a flash chap, why, there's no
saying--there's no saying, sir."</p>

<p>And then I thought of Wunkie.</p>

<p>I sent Wunkie into the tent and strolled along to the garden, where
I occupied myself in gathering rosellas for the morrow's tart. It was
quite a long time before Wunkie came back; and I waited in some anxiety
to hear her report of the interview.</p>

<p>"I gev him the pudding," Wunkie said, solemnly, "and he eat it all.
He arst me if I made it, and I said no, 'twur you that made it; but I
were pretty good at making puddings myself. And while I was washing the
dish, he got a crink in his back, and, my word! he did screw himself
up. And I arst him if he'd got any pain-killer, and he said yes; and I
rubbed him like I used Sam Duffey when he had the crinks with lumbager.
Then he arst me 'bout Sam Duffey, and I told him how Duffey cracked up
and what a bad job it were for me, cos I never had nobody since, that
were as kind to me as them Duffeys and the other chap that didn't
strike a nugget, as was going to 'dopt me. And I said I'd come and rub
him every day if he liked, and he arst me how much I 'spected to be
paid for rubbing him; and when he said that I up and bolted."</p>

<p>"And is that all, Wunkie?"</p>

<p>"No; he hollered for me and I went back, cos I'd forgotten to put
the cork in the pain-killer, and then he made me stop, and he arst me a
lot of things, and what I'd like best in the world if I was gev a
choice; and I said nothing would be no good to me as long as I stopped
with Bully Balfour and Mom"--this was Wunkie's compromise for the more
tender appellation, "Mother"--" 'less somebody ud 'dopt me; then I'd
like to be learned to talk like other folks and to behave. 'Spect it ud
be pretty hard work to learn me anything."</p>

<p>"Teach, Wunkie," I corrected. I may mention that I frequently
corrected Wunkie's errors of pronunciation; but habit was strong, and
she made no great advance towards the acquirement of polished
English.</p>

<p>"'Taint no use," said Wunkie, despairingly. "It's schooling that I
want to get holt of. Bothered, now, if I didn't hammer my nail with the
tommyhawk a purpose to fix that in my head, and there it's gone
again."</p>

<p>I tried to glean indirectly from Wunkie how Mr. Liss had received
her innocent suggestion in regard to 'doption, but all I could get out
of her was that the old man was a "rum 'un," and had "arst" her a lot
of things; and then Wunkie's demure little face rippled over in an odd
way, and she laughed, a rare occurrence with her. It appeared that Mr.
Liss had endeavoured to repair Wunkie's educational deficiencies, and
that, taking an old Bible from under his pillow, he had instructed her
in reading aloud a chapter of Genesis. But though Wunkie's literary
attainments were decidedly elementary, she had frankly informed Mr.
Liss of her opinion that he would be the better, too, for schooling,
and had puzzled him by the theological difficulties she propounded.
With a practical scepticism worthy of Colonel Ingersoll, Wunkie had
expressed her doubts as to the carrying capabilities of the Ark, and
had put Mr. Liss through a catechism which brought him at last to the
humiliating confession that he had never been to school; whereupon
Wunkie gravely informed him that he wasn't the sort of chap she wanted
to get hold of to 'dopt her.</p>

<p>After this I made a point of sending Wunkie down every day during
Mr. Liss's sickness. She carried his pudding to him, arranged his tent,
made his tea, rubbed him with the pain-killer, and one afternoon Alec
came in, highly amused, to tell me that he had found Mr. Liss and
Wunkie absorbed in a game of knuckle-bones, otherwise "fives," Mr. Liss
laboriously driving his pigs to market between his first four fingers,
making cubby-house with his horny hand, and, while he adroitly tossed
up the knuckle-bones, repeating after Wunkie--</p>

<p>"Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.<br>
Jack jump over the candlestick."</p>

<p>Mr. Liss's lumbago got better very soon, thanks to Wunkie and the
pain-killer, and, perhaps, to such innocent recreations, and he was
able to mount on to the top rail of the stockyard again, to watch the
square--tailing, and to moan over the swelling total and the increasing
herd of bleating calves, which last was a sore trial to his
parsimonious mind. The muster ended at last. Luck had gone with us. The
number of cattle which Alec and Balfour brought into the yard nearly
doubled that of the book valuation, by which he had bought. It was
evident that no previous owner had possessed such an energetic stockman
as Balfour of Kilcummin, and Alec was exultant over the working of the
noblesse oblige principle. The sale w&aacute;s a grand stroke for us.
Prices had gone up since Alec's purchase, and in one short year he had
trebled his capital.</p>

<p>One evening I was in the sitting-room, writing all this good news to
Loftus, while Alec and Mr. Liss were having their business talk in the
office. I never went near them when they were so engaged. Indeed, I
strove to spare Mr. Liss's feelings, though I made a point of always
greeting him when we met by chance about the place, and day by day
warily increased my advances as if he had been a wild animal I was
trying to tame. I am bound to say that Mr. Liss took much more kindly
to the taming process than I expected, especially after he had made
friends with Wunkie. I think he softened when he found that
"parlouring" was not expected of him, and we really had quite a
confidential talk one day in the henhouse over the mangled body of a
respectable barn-door missionary pullet which the savage Spanish cock
had pecked to death.</p>

<p>It was very dark that night. There was a new moon, and I remember a
south-easter was blowing which made the ceilings shake and the French
windows rattle, and deadened the sound of a footstep on the verandah
and a little tap against the glass. I heard the tap, but did not say
"Come in," for I thought it was only the blind knocking the pane.
Presently, however, the door opened, and Wunkie appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>She was quite breathless. Her little face was white, except for an
angry red weal across the cheek, and there was another red mark upon
the small brown hand.</p>

<p>I made her come nearer to me, and asked her what had happened. I
could not at once believe that Balfour had been beating her. She had
talked so casually of her "whoppings" that without direct evidence I
had not been ready to attach importance to the statement; and then I
knew that this very morning he had asked for leave to go to the pilot
station, and stay the night, on the plea that he wanted to send a
telegram on some private business, and wait for an answer. But Wunkie's
first words settled the doubt.</p>

<p>"He's whopped me," she panted; "but I don't care about that. I've
run up as hard as I could to tell you that Bully Balfour was up to his
tricks. Didn't I say you'd got to look out? I want you to tell master.
Give me your sacred word and honour that you'll never let Balfour know
as 'twas I that peached. He'll whop me dead if you do."</p>

<p>I assured Wunkie that no harm should befall her. Then I slipped out
into the office where Alec and Mr. Liss were in friendly confabulation
over station matters. Alec was saying--</p>

<p>"He is a first-rate man with stock; hard working, and plenty of
gumption. I don't think you can do better than keep him on. I never
knew a fellow pick up a run so quickly."</p>

<p>"Alec," I said, "I want you and Mr. Liss to come at once into the
sitting-room. Wunkie is there. Balfour has done something wrong, and
she has come to tell you."</p>

<p>They followed me into the parlour. Wunkie was standing by the table.
She was trembling all over, and shaking her little fist at an imaginary
foe, so agitated that she did not seem to notice the two men, who hung
back at the door.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" she cried defiantly. "He may whop me dead if he
likes. I'd sooner be dead than let him cheat you that have tried to
learn me how to behave. You may just tell the master. I ain't going to
let you be thieved, nor that old rum 'un that I rubbed with the crinks
in the lumbager. I like him, that I do; and I ain't going to see his
cattle took away, nor yours either."</p>

<p>"Wunkie," said Alec, coming forward, "just speak out and say what's
up. Don't you be afraid that we shall let anything happen to you. Only
take care and not tell me any lies."</p>

<p>Wunkie looked up at him out of her big black eyes, and tossed her
mane back from her little resolute face.</p>

<p>"I never tell no lies--'cept to Bully Balfour, and I wouldn't tell
him none only for his whoppings. There's a big mob of unbranded calves
planted down in the yard by the Narrows. I heard him telling all about
it. They're going to sneak 'em across to-night. Balfour, he never went
to the pilot station. He's got two of his pals on the other side. He
just sneaked up hisself on foot to have a talk with Mom and get some
grub; and I hadn't got a bit of beef boiled, and so he swore at me, and
then I cheeked him, and he up with his stockwhip and caught me a crack,
and I just bolted, and here I be."</p>

<p>"And here you shall stay," said Alec, in deep, wrathful tones. "He
shall not strike you again. You're a brave, honest little girl. Look
after her, Rachel, and keep her to-night. I'm going quietly down with
Brown to the Narrows, Liss. We'll be beforehand with the rogues."</p>

<p>Alec went off. Mr. Liss said nothing, but lingered awkwardly while I
tried to soothe and console Wunkie. Now that the fervour of her effort
had subsided she flung herself on the floor, and went into a fit of
crying and sobbing, ejaculating brokenly, "I wish I was dead, that I
do. I hate Bully Balfour and Mom; and they wished I was dead. I heard
'em say it. What's the good o' living? Nobody wants Wunkie."</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Liss, who, as the child sobbed, had been standing still
looking at her with a strange expression on his face, stepped close to
us, and said abruptly, "Wunkie, I want you."</p>

<p>Wunkie raised her face, all wet and stained with tears, the red mark
upon it showing cruelly, and stared at him wide-eyed. The idea was new
to her. She evidently did not grasp it.</p>

<p>"You!" she said. "I can do nothing for you. You're all right now.
You ain't got no crinks."</p>

<p>"But I shall have 'em agen," replied Mr. Liss--"always get the
lumbago in the rainy season. Look here. I've got something to say----"
He paused awkwardly. "Do ye like old man Dan'l Liss, Wunkie?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do," returned Wunkie, promptly. "You ain't the sort like
Duffey and the chap as was going to strike a nugget and 'dopt me, and
cracked up i'stead--not so slap-up sharp and free with the tin; but, my
word! you and I get on first-rate together; don't we, now? I knows your
ways."</p>

<p>A smile of genuine pleasure came over Mr. Liss's face at this
statement of Wunkie's. But the gleam in the child's eyes went out, and
she burst into sobs once more. "What's the good? I've gone and peached,
'cos I wouldn't see you thieved; and now I'll have to go off to Bully
Balfour and be whopped again."</p>

<p>"No; I'm not going to stand that," exclaimed Mr. Liss, with fierce
energy. "I'm d----d if I do. Wunkie--Well----" He hesitated, and tapped
her tiny shoulder with his three stumpy fingers, as his way was when he
meant a thing. "You said that you wanted to get hold of somebody that
'ud adopt you and send you to school. I'll adopt you, Wunkie. I'll give
you your grub and schooling; and then, after you've grown a big girl
and I'm a crawler, you shall come and stop with me and rub me when I've
got the crinks."</p>

<p>The child jumped to her feet. She turned to me in a bewildered way,
and then to him. I said not a word. I think Mr. Liss had forgotten that
I was there; he was looking so earnestly at the child.</p>

<p>All of a sudden she flung up her arms round his neck and kissed
him.</p>

<p>"I will," she cried. "I'll be a good girl. You shan't never have to
whop me. I'll keep the devil outside. I'll make your puddings and mend
your clothes, and I'll rub you in the lumbager, and I'll never tell you
no lies, nor cheek you, and I'll learn you all the things I learn
myself, and when you're a crawler I'll take care of you."</p>

<p>There was something at once comic and pathetic in the manner in
which Mr. Liss accepted the child's ombrace. He gave a little start as
if he were frightened, but she only clung to him the more, holding back
her head, her tiny face glowing as she panted forth again, "I'll be
good, I'll be good. I'll do everything for you. I'll never belong to no
one but you."</p>

<p>Then he put up his hand timidly and stroked her rough hair. "Very
well, my dear," he said simply. "It's a bargain between us; and missus
there is witness of it. From this night you're my 'dopted daughter; and
old man Dan'l Liss 'ull deal fair by you--so help him God!" And he
stooped down and solemnly kissed her.</p>

<p>I went away and left them together. The horses were already saddled
out in the yard, and Alec, Brown, and one of the spare hands mounted
noiselessly and rode off in the direction of the Narrows. When I went
back to the parlour, after having prepared a bed for Wunkie in one of
the verandah rooms, Mr. Liss was sitting on a low chair, and Wunkie, on
the floor beside him, had fallen asleep, with her head against his
knees. The sight of these two touched me curiously. I felt a lump rise
in my throat, and my heart thrilled. "You have done a good deed, and
God will make her a blessing to you," I said to him.</p>

<p>"Amen!" Mr. Liss answered reverently.</p>

<p>And that was how Wunkie got 'dopted.</p>

<p>When Alec and the men reached the Narrows, they found, as Wunkie had
predicted, a mob of steers in the yard by the crossing, all ready to be
swum over when the tide should be out. Balfour's horse, saddled and
bridled, was there too; but he himself never appeared. Probably he
skulked down in the dark, and seeing that the game was up, returned to
his hut, determined to brave the matter. Alec let the cattle loose and
drove them back a little way, then leaving the men to watch, rode home.
He waited till the next morning, knowing that the approaches to the
crossing were guarded, and that Balfour would not dare to swim without
his horse, on account of the sharks. Anyhow, it would be impossible for
his wife to leave the Island without applying to us.</p>

<p>But Balfour did not make any attempt to bolt. In obedience to Alec's
and Mr. Liss's command, he appeared defiantly at the office accompanied
by Mrs. Balfour. He was discharged, and, Alec told me, received as
severe a moral drubbing as could have been administered by any judge on
the bench. "You should have heard Liss," said Alec. "I couldn't have
believed the old fellow had so much fire in him. By Jove! he did pitch
into Balfour for flogging Wunkie. We threatened to prosecute the rogue
for cattle-stealing, but I thought to myself that, after all, I owed
him a good deal of the success of the sale; though I see now why he was
so uncommon sharp at learning the run. Mrs. Balfour flung herself on
her knees and implored us to spare her husband; and the end of it is,
that McGilray is to take them in the boat to Gundabine this afternoon's
tide; and they signed a paper, drawn up in proper magistrate's form,
giving up all claim to Wunkie. She is Liss's adopted daughter now, and
who knows but what in years to come the Island may be part of her
marriage portion? Well, I wish she may do as well with it as we have
done."</p>

<p>Wunkie and her guardian were standing hand-in-hand on the little
slab landing-place when we rowed down the creek and out into the
Narrows. It was a beautiful May day, with a touch of winter chill in
the westerly breeze. Sky and sea were of a soft dreamy blue. Tiny
wavelets leapt up and kissed the green waxen mangroves. All nature was
smiling and wishing us God-speed.</p>

<p>We put the boat broadside to the creek when we reached its mouth,
and waited, taking a last look at the figures on the shore. We all in
the boat, Alec leading, gave forth a long-drawn plaintive "Coo-ee." It
was our farewell to the Island. There came an answering good-bye from
those we had left, and little Wunkie ran forward to the end of the
pier, and stretched out her tiny arms to us across the sun-tipped
water.</p>

<h3>Chapter XV. A New Departure.</h3>

<p>WE did not buy another station for a good many months after our sale
of the Island. In the meantime my little baby-girl came, and Alec
travelled over many miles out West before he took up new country.</p>

<p>Gunyan was almost at the end of civilization. There was a very
primitive township some ninety miles distant from it, to which Mr.
Lyndon had extended the Balloo and Stonehampton Railway. Neighbours
were few and far between. The climate in summer was atrocious, and in
the Never-Never land drought is the squatter's bogie. But Gunyan
possessed the best water supply in the district, which made it
exceptionally valuable as a property, and Alec had a plan by which all
its residential disadvantages were to be overcome.</p>

<p>A little way from Stonehampton, branching off from the Balloo
Railway, was a pretty seaside resort much patronized by rich free
selectors and Western squatters, whose wives wished to be within reach
of their husbands, and yet avoid the worst hardships of the bush. Alec
decided that Wombo should be our summer abode, and that during the
winter months only, when heat, sandflies, and blight had no existence,
should baby and I live at Gunyan. The scheme involved certain weeks, if
not months, of separation; but then, as Alec explained, we could rough
it up there together from April to November, and there was always the
prospect, barring drought, of making a fortune in a few years, and
settling down in Melbourne or Sydney--or, better still, taking that
much-talked-of trip to England.</p>

<p>The sea was a soft poetic lavender, and the outlines of the islands
were blurred by the heat-mist on that February afternoon when we took
possession of our cottage at Wombo. The bay had sheltered cliffs and a
sandy beach, strewn with sea-eggs and stranded jelly-fish and
d&eacute;bris of shells; and along its margin grew a sort of fat-leaved
mesembryanthemum, and clumps of bread-fruit trees, looking battered and
odd with their reedy, ragged blades of leaf, their great yellow cones,
and queer roots spreading out from half-way up the stem, something like
the spikes of a huge umbrella turned inside out. At one end of the bay
stretched out a high wooded promontory, and within its shelter lay a
little rocky knoll overgrown with creepers, pink hibiscus, and
tropical-looking vegetation--a vestige of the old scrub, which had been
almost cleared away. The other horn was formed by a line of bold bare
rocks, riddled with fissures and beaten by wind and waves into strange
fantastic shapes, beneath which the sea made a sudden narrow sweep
inland, so that at high tide the village was cut off on one side as by
a river.</p>

<p>It was low tide now. Alec, nurse, baby and I got out of the coach
with our clocks, birdcages, and portable valuables, and while the
vehicle went on its regular way round by road, we prepared to take the
shorter cut and wade across the inlet to our homestead exactly
opposite. As we took off our shoes, and I kilted up my skirts, we could
look across and see in the curve of the bay the cluster of wooden
houses with their plots of banana and pineapple, a family hotel, the
ultimate destination of the coach, a public-house or two, and, further
back, scattered selections with gardens and paddocks, forming a
foreground to the rising wolds of grey-green bush that touched the
horizon line.</p>

<p>The most imposing of these dwellings was built on a hill at the head
of the inlet--a big, rambling, verandahed house, with a great many
outbuildings and a very large, luxuriant-looking garden, in which were
some fine clumps of bamboo. This was Barradean, Mr. Wilson's selection,
and the show-place of the settlement. Mr. Wilson owned several stations
up north, and was a person of importance, but he was not nearly so much
talked about as his daughter Weeta, generally known by the fancy title
of "The Veiled Princess."</p>

<p>It was rather pleasant stepping over the wet, soft sand, feeling it
close over one's naked feet, and hearing the swish and gurgle the water
made when, out of idle sport, we displaced a shiny wet rock lying in
our path, and set the young crabs scuttling away in terror. We had
reached the opposite bank, and were preparing to climb the slope on
which our new cottage was built, when a woman's voice, shrill,
energetic, and yet kindly, stopped us.</p>

<p>"My word! if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Ansdell! Oh, I must just see the
baby."</p>

<p>The lady, one of a party of three leisurely descending the hill,
rushed forward and seized Alec's and my hand at the same time.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Wilson!" said Alec.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, out of breath; "I've been to the cottage. I hope
you'll find things pretty straight. It came across me that perhaps
there wouldn't be curtains ready for baby's cot; for though there arn't
any mosquitoes to speak of, Mrs. Ansdell, still we know what one
buzzing round will do for a baby. Sweet little darling, how old?"
etc.</p>

<p>Here came certain unveilings and some parenthetical baby-talk, at
the close of which Mrs. Wilson remarked with emphasis, "Now, Mrs.
Ansdell, they call me the manager of the district, and if you want to
know your way about, you come to me. They all do--young men and young
women, as you'll find, and I just say to them, 'My dear, tell me all
about it,' and I take them in hand and turn them round, and set them
right face foremost. Don't I, Mr. Thurston?"</p>

<p>She appealed to a handsome, English-looking young man, who, with a
slim, veiled girl, had come towards us.</p>

<p>"Uncommonly obliged we ought to feel, Mrs. Wilson," replied the
young man. "You're a mother to us loafers about Stonehampton, and
Barradean's a regular home for incurables, and a refuge for the
impecunious and unemployed."</p>

<p>"No, no," protested Mrs. Wilson. "I know what I'm about, and I don't
give loafers the run of my house. My young men must be gentlemen, and
have money to invest. That's my mission--to keep you young fellows of
good family out of the way of sharks. There are plenty of sharks in
Stonehampton--with their 'sampling' and their unlimited loo, and their
bogus companies and their salted gold-mines. My daughter, Mrs. Ansdell,
and Mr. Thurston. Perhaps your husband knows Lord Belmont, Mr.
Thurston's father?"</p>

<p>"I should think I did," said Alec, shaking the young man warmly by
the hand. "My people are in the same county. Archie, old boy, the last
I heard of you was that you were going up for the army."</p>

<p>"So I did, but I got plucked--always got plucked. Science and facts
ain't my strong point. They tried the Church, but it was no go.
Squatting is about my form--when I've got Mrs. Wilson to give me good
advice."</p>

<p>"Well, you might have let me have a chance of earning a hundred a
year by teaching you colonial experience," said Alec.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, old chap, Loftus wrote home such stories about your
island and the mosquitoes, that I thought I'd rather go somewhere else
for my colonial experience."</p>

<p>"And how are all the Suffolk folk?" asked Alec.</p>

<p>"First-rate. I haven't seen anything of your people since the last
Bury ball. Your sisters were there, and--and----" The young man stopped
short and got rather red.</p>

<p>"Isabel Cave! Oh, I heard all about it," put in Alec. Mr. Thurston
laughed rather consciously, and turned away from Mrs. Wilson's sharp
glance. I felt certain that he was afraid of Mrs. Wilson, and that he
had not told her anything about Isabel Cave. Mrs. Wilson looked quite a
person to inspire awe in the breast of a weak young man, and, for all
his physical manliness and his undeniable good looks, I suspected Mr.
Thurston of lacking force of character.</p>

<p>The lady of Barradean was large and angular. She had quite a
majestic presence. Her dress was of rich stuff and fashionable make.
Her face was well preserved. A fringe of iron-grey hair, carefully
curled, showed beneath her feathered hat. Her false teeth were perfect,
and she wore a massive ch&acirc;telaine, with an armoury of silver
weapons that rattled with every gesture.</p>

<p>The introduction to Miss Wilson had not been altogether a success. A
sweet muffled voice said, "How do you do?" in answer to my salutation,
and I could only imagine the smile with which presumably my further
remarks were greeted, for she spoke absolutely nothing, but stood as
still as a statue, and as graceful. The Veiled Princess gave a good
deal of play to the imagination. She was very tall and beautifully
proportioned. I never saw finer sweep of shoulder and set of neck. Her
face, closely covered with several folds of grey gauze, remained a
mystery, but through the gauze there shot a gleam of deep, dark eyes,
and where it was gathered up behind I saw a coil of the most wonderful
red-gold hair, which gave promise of gratifying possibilities.</p>

<p>Presently baby began to cry, but not even the fretful wail and the
little commotion which ensued disturbed Miss Weeta's serenity. Mrs.
Wilson bade us good-bye. She said they had left the buggy up at the
township, and were going round by the rocks to get some oysters which
were to be scalloped for Mr. Wilson's dinner. Mr. Thurston was carrying
a basket and Miss Weeta dangled a black's dilly-bag. I wondered if she
would unvcil in the ardour of the occupation. Mrs. Wilson gave us a
good many parting injunctions as to the method of dealing with Wombo
tradesmen, and extracted a promise on our part that we would dine at
Barradean the following evening. Alec and Mr. Thurston arranged to have
"a real old Suffolk yarn." The veiled girl said nothing, but atoned for
the omission by a farewell bow of statuesque grace. We walked up along
the prickly--pear hedge which bordered our garden.</p>

<p>"She is like the Venus of Milo," said Alec, reverting to Miss Weeta;
"if you could fancy the Louvre Venus on an Australian cattle selection.
I'm sure that not all Jupiter's magic could make that Venus talk."</p>

<p>"Doesn't Miss Wilson ever talk?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; but she looks and she smiles, and that's quite good enough. I
can't make out," pursued Alec reflectively, "whether she is very stupid
or very clever."</p>

<p>"Is she never seen unveiled?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, after dusk and in a darkened room. It's her complexion.
But you will soon find out all her peculiarities, and in the meantime
here we are."</p>

<p>We stepped into the enclosure, scantily stocked with some hibiscus
shrubs, a native tree covered with brilliant pink flowers, two or three
baby bamboos, and a few creepers and annuals. The cottage had a wide
verandah built in at the back and sides, thus forming several small
rooms in addition to the four main ones. It all looked remarkably
homelike and we allowed, as the Americans say, that if Mrs. Wilson's
passion for managing her friends' affairs always led to such happy
results, she must have added considerably to the comfort of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Alec, "the table ready laid--cold chicken and
trifle, and the celebrated Barradean cream junket! She is not a bad
sort, after all." But he went on to express an ungrateful hope that she
didn't mean to go on "bossing our show," because he shouldn't be able
to stand it for a permanency.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Rachel, whose show she is doing her best to boss,"
Alec continued later on, as we sat in the verandah, and he smoked his
pipe and I watched the moon shining over the sea, and enjoyed the soft
breeze and the faint mingled odours of gum-trees and brine. "She has
got the Honourable Archie in her clutches; he is a soft chap, and will
do anything she tells him, down to buying a partnership or marrying her
daughter."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he marry her daughter?" I said.</p>

<p>"Because I suspect very shrewdly that he is as good as engaged to
Isabel Cave. I know from what my sisters have told me that he proposed
to her and that she was not unwilling, but her guardian refused his
consent, and she doesn't come into her money for some months yet."</p>

<p>Isabel Cave, hitherto only a name which had occurred several times
in Alec's letters from his sisters, now acquired a new and living
interest. I made Alec instruct me upon the situation, which, briefly,
was this. The Belmonts were the great people in Alec's part of Suffolk.
Miss Cave was the only daughter of a successful Manchester man who had
bought a place in the neighbourhood, and Isabel had grown upon intimate
terms with Alec's sisters. Archie Thurston was, as Alec put it, "since
his time," having been still at college when Alec left England--a
younger son, and, so far, somewhat of a disappointment to his
relatives. Old Mr. Cave died, confiding Isabel to the guardianship of a
brother, who, like the uncles in the melodramas, wanted to make up a
match between the heiress and his own son, and who looked with great
disfavour upon the boy-and-girl lovemaking between Isabel and Archie.
So, in a milder degree, did the Belmonts themselves, and the result
seemed to be Archie's exile to Australia.</p>

<p>It was not long before we heard further particulars about Mr.
Thurston's romance. The next morning his handsome head appeared above
the prickly pear bushes, and his voice was heard calling, "I say, where
can a fellow hitch up his horse out of the way of these confounded
thorns?" Alec went to his aid, and presently the two came to the
verandah, and settled themselves in long canvas chairs, with tumblers
of what Mr. Thurston called the "Barradean swizzle" on the wooden arms
of their lounges. "Ginger-beer, ration sugar, a drop of bitters, and a
decent dash of rum. It's the old lady's compromise with Wilson,"
explained M. Thurston. "The old chap likes his glass, and if the
cellaret was left open, he would be pegging all day. But the Major, as
we call Mrs. Wilson, keeps the keys, and humours him by standing a
large jug of this stuff on the sideboard, so that he can't complain of
thirst."</p>

<p>There was an English mail in, and, like ourselves, Mr. Thurston had
received letters. He was dying to know what Etta Ansdell had told us
concerning Isabel Cave. "The fact is, Mrs. Ansdell, we're engaged," he
said, sheepishly, "but it is to be kept a secret till we're out of our
difficulties."</p>

<p>"Have you taken the Major into your confidence?" asked Alec.</p>

<p>"Why, no! But Weeta--Miss Wilson knows all about it. She is an
awfully sympathetic girl, though people do laugh at her about her
complexion. I know that if I had a skin like hers--it's beautiful, Mrs.
Ansdell--and if I freckled all over with a ray of sunshine, I'd wear a
veil too, and so would you. Isabel used to freckle," he added
reflectively.</p>

<p>I agreed as to the veil, and praised the colour of Miss Weeta's
hair.</p>

<p>"It's glorious!" he rejoined with enthusiasm--"like a Tintoretto,
you know. It puts me in mind of Miss Cave; her hair is just that
golden-red, and she has the same kind of eyes. Don't you think there's
a likeness, Ansdell?"</p>

<p>Alec promised to make his observations that evening. "And how about
Miss Cave? When are you going to be married?"</p>

<p>"As soon as she is her own mistress. What do you think? She has made
up her mind to come out to me. She is delicate, you know--lungs, and
all that--and the doctors have recommended a long sea-voyage of two or
three years in a warm climate. We've settled it between ourselves. She
comes of age this year. I have had a letter this morning, and I'm
rather excited--naturally," he added, with a boyish frankness that was
very taking.</p>

<p>"Oh, it has gone as far as that?" said Alec. "So she writes to you,
does she?"</p>

<p>"Only now and then. You see, she is a very honourable girl and
wouldn't do anything underhand; but we think that when there's a crisis
it is right of us to let each other know, and so she has written to
tell me that she has made up her mind."</p>

<p>"Well, look out for squalls with the Major," said Alec. "My
impression is, young fellow, that Mrs. Wilson would like to see Miss
Weeta the Honourable Mrs. Thurston."</p>

<p>"Come, that's all bosh," replied Archie, getting suddenly red.
"Besides, it's a sort of insult to Miss Wilson. We are splendid
friends, and she often asks me about Isabel. She is awfully
sympathetic," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Expresses her sympathy by gesture, I suppose?" said Alec.</p>

<p>"Don't chaff, Alec. She talks when we are by ourselves and the Major
is out of the way. And you should hear her play the violin! She was
educated in Melbourne, you know. I can tell you her playing is
first--class. That puts me in mind of Isabel, too. I suppose you don't
remember how she used to play The Kreutzer to your sister's
accompaniment?"</p>

<p>"No," said Alec. "She wasn't so far advanced when I knew her."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Wilson plays The Kreutzer, too, and I accompany her. I
told her, the other day, that I could almost fancy I was accompanying
Isabel."</p>

<p>"And what did Miss Weeta say to that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she--" young Thurston stammered, confusedly, "she--why, she
said--nothing."</p>

<h3>Chapter XVI. The Veiled Princess.</h3>

<p>Mr. Wilson came himself and drove us over to Barradean with his
tandem. He was a large, red, burly man, with a fat voice and a casual
laugh. "Yep, yep!" he shouted to the horses at the pitch of his strong
lungs. The buggy flew along, and a pack of kangaroo-hounds, with red
tongues hanging out, barking as they ran, seemed to have some
difficulty in keeping up to our speed. The tails of Mr. Wilson's white
coat bulged out in the wind, and he held the string of his cabbage-tree
hat between his teeth to prevent its being blown off.</p>

<p>Evidently Mr. Wilson was popular among the Wombo selectors. He had a
nod and a word for everyone who passed, from the Chinaman, with his
load of vegetables, to a party of footsore fencers coming in from the
bush, and from a German woman stumping by her cart to a "flash"
squatter driving his four-in-hand. His running fire of greeting was
diversified by parenthetical remarks to me. "Billy Barlow--the biggest
blower in the district. How are you, Billy? Turn up at Barradean
to--morrow and do a swizzle. Put him on the wrong side of the
brandy--bottle, and he'll beat even my stories into fits, and that's
saying a good deal. ... Good-day, Wiggins," to a clerical-looking
person; "the grinders working better, eh? Stonehampton parson come down
here to get accustomed to a new set of false teeth. ... I say,
Humphreys, you're wanted at Barradean to-night. Janie Stern says you're
a stunner at the polka. Turn round and come along. Humphreys, of the
Union Bank, awfully gone on my girl; but &pound;200 a year and a shanty
in a bush township isn't her style. She's mighty hard to please, is
Weeta, she and her mother together: nothing short of an English swell
will satisfy them. Shouldn't wonder if they got the crooked stick after
all," pursued Mr. Wilson. "I tell Weeta she reads too much poetry.
Lord, the amount of trash that girl does get through is
astonishing!"</p>

<p>By this time we had swung into the gates of Barradean. There was a
bachelors' quarters at the back, and I saw several men in white coats
lounging about, who, I presume, were Mrs. Wilson's
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. The place was a queer mixture of roughness and
luxury. The stockyard, which lay a little beyond the cultivated
enclosure, was surrounded by a small plantation of castor-oil plants,
and two huge boiling-down pots had attracted a covey of very noisy
crows. I soon discovered Mr. Wilson had a genius for disorder, and that
outside Mrs. Wilson's jurisdiction, Barradean did not sustain the
reputation which her housekeeping had earned indoors. The garden was
lovely. There were trellises of vines and passion-fruit, and one arcade
covered with the granadilla creeper: the fruit hanging inside like
great golden blobs filled me with admiration. The bamboos made a
melancholy soughing noise, and the air was laden with perfume. It was
the kind of garden in which to dream away summer evenings of languorous
delight. The thought flashed across me that it would not be difficult
for Mr. Thurston to forget Isabel Cave if a beautiful Veiled Princess
wove mysterious spells that chained him to her side in such a bower as
this.</p>

<p>At one end of the house grew a poinciana-tree, now a canopy of
gorgeous flame-coloured blossom. Young Thurston was gathering sprays of
the flowers and giving them to a most curious and attractive-looking
woman, who stood in a statuesque attitude against a background of
orange and green. She herself was a harmony of green and orange. I
suppose her sense of colouring was intuitive, for none of us there had
studied the modern mysteries of "tone." Perhaps Mr. Thurston had
instructed her; he was a sort of dilettante in art. In any case, she
must have found it a difficult matter to achieve the soft, clinging,
"Liberty--looking" dress which was draped from her shoulders, and
seemed to be caught at her waist by a girdle of poinciana flowers. She
had a wreath of the same flowers on her head, and they were just two
tones more vivid than her hair. I never beheld such hair. It hung to
her waist in a natural ripple, and each strand seemed to fall by
itself. In colour it was simply magnificent. She wore it parted in the
middle and standing out from her forehead as it does in some Venetian
portraits.</p>

<p>Her face was one of the most peculiar I have ever seen. It was very
long. The forehead was too high, the mouth heavy, the eyes blue, full
lidded, and with pupils that dilated readily. Certainly her complexion
was worth taking care of. The petals of a white rose could hardly have
been more smooth, and were scarcely more pale. One could only feel
grateful to the veil that had preserved it in such immaculate
purity.</p>

<p>"What a pity it is that Rossetti couldn't have painted your
daughter," Alec remarked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Mrs. Wilson, in an innocent manner; then added, "Oh, of
course. That's what Mr. Thurston says. He says the London painters
would go wild about her, and he ought to know. He is a very cultivated
young man, Mr. Thurston."</p>

<p>"I don't think it needs much cultivation to appreciate Miss Wilson's
beauty," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, now," observed Mr. Wilson, who had joined us, "you'd be
surprised to hear that till she was fifteen we thought her downright
plain, and called her 'Carrots.' Red hair seems to have come into
fashion since my young days. Lucky, ain't it, that we don't all want to
be in the fashion?" and he turned with a guffaw to one of the men near
him.</p>

<p>He was followed by quite a small army from the bachelors' quarters,
Mr. Humphreys, the hopeless adorer, among them--a lean, shy, straggling
creature, who gave a general impression of having run up quickly in a
moist soil. The others I took to be squatters and sugar--planters, and
there were two or three fresh-faced new chums, whose clothes had an
English cut, and of whom one wore evening dress, and was being
mercilessly chaffed by the younger Wilson fry.</p>

<p>We were outside the drawing-room, to which there were so many
windows that it hardly seemed separated from the verandah. Within were
more young ladies, whose type was the eternal commonplace, and their
mission--to giggle. Nobody made any attempt to go down to the pair
under the flame-coloured tree, nor did they come forward and greet us.
Apparently it was the custom to regard Miss Weeta as a goddess to be
worshipped, or a picture to be admired, but from whom neither
conversation nor social conventions were to be expected. I am bound to
say that there did not seem to be many social conventions of any kind
at Barradean, and probably that was why everybody liked the place so
much. Just now Mr. Thurston seemed to be doing all the talking; Weeta
stood in her quiescent manner, only stretching out her arm every now
and then to take the flowers he offered her, and which she held in a
loose bunch against her skirts.</p>

<p>"Pa doesn't know anything about it," said Mrs. Wilson, after a
minute's contemplation of her daughter, and then reverting to Mr.
Wilson's statement. "We should none of us have known, if the Prince
hadn't spotted her in church with Miss Bellhayes's girls, and been
struck all of a heap with her hair and her complexion."</p>

<p>"That settled me," said Mr. Wilson; "I saw what a fool I'd been. If
anybody can take his pick of the best of everything it's a prince, and
his opinion is not to be argued against."</p>

<p>By dint of a few questions I elicited the fact that Miss Weeta had
been looked upon as an ugly duckling till a certain royal personage,
touring in Australia, convinced the world of Melbourne that a rare swan
had been hatched in a hen's nest. If Miss Weeta had been a few years
older, there is no knowing whether she might not have been then and
there translated to a higher sphere, for the Prince had been
accompanied by a fashionable painter and a peer of literary and
artistic proclivities, both of whom did their best to immortalise her.
The peer had put her into his journal, which was afterwards published,
and of which a copy, bound in vellum, was kept under glass in the
Barradean drawing-room.</p>

<p>The painter had painted her portrait for his royal patron. "And I
have no doubt it hangs in one of the royal palaces now," added Mr.
Wilson, with a heave of satisfaction; "and that it frequently makes the
Princess jealous."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Mrs. Wilson, waiving the question of the
Princess's jealousy, "it was a mercy we made the discovery before she
went on freckling. There were two big spots on the left side of her
nose. It took years to get rid of them."</p>

<p>"But now we know her value, and we take care of her accordingly,"
said Mr. Wilson. "I had a room built, with windows fixed expressly for
her complexion."</p>

<p>"Really! The windows----"</p>

<p>"Raised close up to the eaves, and on the north side where there
ain't much sun."</p>

<p>"It must be a great responsibility," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Buttermilk and glycerine carry us through," answered Mrs. Wilson,
quite seriously; "and fortunately Weeta don't mind staying indoors
during the heat of the day. She's fond of reading and playing--the
hours she practises her violin would astonish you--and then she designs
dresses. She'll take a leaf or a flower and mix up her Judson's dyes
till she has got a colour that nobody would ever dream of putting on
their backs, but that seems somehow to fit her to a T. She dyed that
dress she has got on to the shade of a withered granadilla leaf."</p>

<p>I was very much interested in the particulars the Major gave me of
Miss Weeta's accomplishments, and in Mrs. Wilson's views as to the
paragon's ultimate destiny. The upper stratum of English society
appeared to be the final goal of both mother and daughter's ambition.
They had hoped that "Pa" might have sold out of his stations before
now, and that they might have gone to London and cut a dash, and that
Miss Weeta might have been re-introduced to the Prince, and that she
might at least have had the chance of marrying an earl or a duke. And
if it hadn't been for drought and for Pa's good-nature in taking shares
in salt-mines that went smash, to oblige a friend, all these desirable
objects might have been attained. "Weeta was born to be among the
aristocracy," concluded Mrs. Wilson, emphatically, "and into the
aristocracy she shall go."</p>

<p>"Tell you what it is, Ma, I was born to drink when I felt thirsty,
and as the swizzle is clean done, and if you have your keys handy,"
insinuated Mr. Wilson, "Ansdell would eat his dinner all the better for
a peg of rum."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson frowned on the hint, and fortunately just then the bell
rang, and Mr. Wilson offered me his arm. Mr. Thurston and Weeta were
already in the dining-room, and he was laying the sprays of poinciana
on the table. She gave me her hand with a dreamy smile. When I
complimented her upon her taste in the arrangement of the dinner-table,
she said, "Yes," merely, and smiled again. There was something
inscrutable in that smile.</p>

<p>I asked her what she had been doing all day.</p>

<p>"Oh, reading and practising," she answered.</p>

<p>I told her that I had heard a great deal about her playing from Mr.
Thurston.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said again, and paused. Her eyes rested on my face in
a slow, questioning way, and she opened her lips as if she were going
to ask me something. I felt expectant, but she turned away as Mrs.
Wilson came up and settled me in the place of honour, and I noticed
that with quite unconscious magnetism Weeta seemed to draw Mr. Thurston
with her, and that he placed himself beside her at the other end of the
table.</p>

<p>We were a large party. There were the four commonplace young ladies
in muslin frocks and gay ribbons, and there were twice as many
gentlemen. Then, after we had begun dinner, a buggy drove up in front
of the windows, and a neighbouring squatter and his sister--the Janie
Stern already mentioned--got down, and, giving the buggy and horses
into a blackboy's charge, joined us at table without further ceremony.
Miss Janie Stern, who was short and sharp of speech and eyes, and
rather pretty, hoped there was going to be some dancing that evening,
and said that she and "Artie" had come to stay over the muster, and
that she meant to wake up Barradean before she went home again. The
dinner was very well cooked, and gave testimony to the excellence of
Mrs. Wilson's housekeeping, but the service was of a most casual kind,
and people got up and helped themselves and each other without
reference to the sequence of courses. It was all very free-and-easy and
unpremeditated, and the life and bustle seemed to me strange after our
quiet, unsocial Island life. Outside, in the shadow of the creepers,
several dusky beings lounged and watched the repast. One white-haired
veteran perched himself on the edge of the verandah and poured forth a
sort of chant, of which "Wombeen" was the burden.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson threw him a bone, whereat the tribe of piccaninnies
gathered like a flock of hungry crows. Mrs. Wilson complained that Mr.
Wilson encouraged the blacks about the house, so that there was no
holding them within bounds, but no further notice was taken till I
became unpleasantly conscious of the effluvium of the gunya, and the
veteran's gaunt tattooed frame, scantily clad in an old white shirt,
with a big mother-of-pearl medallion in its wealed breast, leaned over
the host's chair. "Come along, Wilson," it said, "I been wait plenty
long time."</p>

<p>"Go away, Billy," answered Mr. Wilson, laughing. "Me come
directly."</p>

<p>"Ba'al," stolidly declared Billy, "me want him tobacco for that
fellow wombeen."</p>

<p>"He has been catching 'wombeen'--that's what they call crabs
hereabouts," explained Mr. Wilson--"and he's bothering to be paid. All
right, Billy," and Mr. Wilson got up, fetched a fig of tobacco, and
pacified Billy, who retired again to the verandah.</p>

<p>It was quite evening when we left the dining-room, but there was the
most beautiful moon rising out at sea. As it mounted behind the clumps
of bamboos and cast flickering shadows on the gravel walks, the garden
seemed more than ever a place of enchantment. Here in the open lay a
patch of brightness, and there, where some dense foliage hung, were
indefinite vistas and strange alleys of impenetrable gloom. The
magnolias and trumpet-flowers gleamed like white stars, and night had
robbed the great orange begonias of their gold. Miss Janie Stern
suggested that it would be "jolly" to go out and gather cheremoyas, and
ran down the grassy slope with a kind of "who loves me, follows me"
air.</p>

<p>Several of the young men did follow her, though Mrs. Wilson called
out, "Look out for snakes"; but cheremoyas, flavoured with flirtation,
appeared an irresistible bait to all but Weeta and Mr. Thurston.</p>

<p>"Nothing short of a rousing dance tune will bring back Janie Stern
and that young Humphreys," observed the Major, and she got up and went
to the piano in the drawing-room, leaving me in a deep canvas chair not
far from the young people.</p>

<p>"Won't you come out?" pleaded Mr. Thurston.</p>

<p>"No," she answered.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you let me ride with you this afternoon?" he went
on.</p>

<p>"When are you going back north?" she counter-questioned, and there
was a note of eagerness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Why, you know," he said, hesitatingly, "I'm going to help with the
muster. Mrs. Wilson says your father wants me."</p>

<p>"Wants you!" she repeated. "Goodness! what do you know about
stock-keeping?"</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "you said yourself I'd better learn, so that I
might be able to take charge of a station of my own."</p>

<p>"I think you had much better go and get your station," she said. "I
can't think why you keep hanging about here."</p>

<p>"I like talking to you."</p>

<p>"About Miss Cave, and playing on the piano and accompanying my
violin, as you accompanied her, and, because we have both got red hair,
making me into a sort of peg to hang your raptures on."</p>

<p>"I don't call your hair red," he said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't you? What do you call it, then?"</p>

<p>"The colour of the rising sun and the symbol of worship," replied
he, promptly.</p>

<p>"Did you tell Miss Cave that?" she asked. He did not answer, and she
said, "It is prettier hair than hers, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," he said.</p>

<p>"You got English letters to-day--didn't you, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you were dying to tell me all about them, and that's why you
tried so hard to ride with me?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go and make a confidant of someone else--Mrs.
Ansdell?"</p>

<p>"Please forgive my interrupting you," I interposed, "but you put me
under the necessity of changing my seat."</p>

<p>"No, don't go," exclaimed Mr. Thurston. "Mrs. Ansdell knows all
about it," he added, and moved away. Weeta drew her chair closer to
mine. She looked at me seriously for a minute, and unfastened a
poinciana spray at her waist, then drew it reflectively along her
dress, as if she were trying an effect before she spoke. "You will make
a better confidant than I shall," she said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall make a safer one," I answered, and was sorry a
moment after the words had escaped me, for I saw even in the dim light
that she flushed deeply.</p>

<p>"Why did you say that?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>I took my courage in both hands and rushed head-long at the fence
which I had built up for myself.</p>

<p>"If you were engaged to be married to a man on the other side of the
world, should you not think there was a danger in his making a
confidant of beautiful young woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she began, "I must say you do speak what you mean."</p>

<p>I felt convicted of an impertinence, and told her so.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it," she replied. "I could get on with you if you would
always say what you mean. Do you mean----" she added impulsively, and
paused. "Am I really beautiful?"</p>

<p>"The Prince seems to have settled that question," I said.</p>

<p>"The Prince!" She laughed--a ghostly sort of laugh which had no real
merriment. "It's funny, isn't it--like being canonized for a practical
joke? Perhaps all the time the Prince was only trying to get a rise out
of the Melbourne people. I dare say it might be an amusing experience
to create a new standard of beauty among a set of savages. But, anyhow,
it was a very fortunate thing for me."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see? Now, I am a person of consideration. There are two
things about my childhood which always stand out in my mind," she went
on rather sadly. "One was a saying, half in chaff, half in earnest,
among the people about me, that 'Weeta had a shingle loose,' and I was
pitied and laughed at in consequence. The other was my mother's
vehement lamentation that I was so ugly. I used to feel very sorry for
my mother, and often I have cried myself to sleep because she found me
so unpleasant to look at. It was out of sheer sorrow and not spite, for
I don't think I resented my elder sister being always brought forward
and shown off. She is married now. She is like my mother, and had black
ringlets that hung like corkscrews round her head."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said, for she had stopped.</p>

<p>"Well, then the Prince came and made them believe that instead of a
worthless pebble they had got a precious stone. They accepted the idea
on his authority. I don't know whether I am the pebble or the jewel;
but I have often thought what a beautiful and satisfying thing it would
have been if the mother's love had proved a true touchstone--if she had
loved me for myself, and not for what the Prince thought of my
complexion and my hair. That sort of love would be a diamond worth
having, and after all, you see, it is I who have to make the best of a
sham. But it is pleasant to be admired and flattered, and allowed to be
as lazy as I please--I always had a horror of glare and heat and active
exertion--and so I say nothing, and am thankful."</p>

<p>The girl's unconscious cynicism touched me to the heart. Was this,
then, the clue to her odd demeanour, and were there concealed fires
beneath the outward snow?</p>

<p>"It is funny!" she repeated.</p>

<p>I could not help saying that to me there was far more pathos than
comedy in the situation.</p>

<p>All this time the Major was within, strumming the Corricolo Galop.
She had not played in vain: Janie Stern and Mr. Humphreys were whirling
round the empty part of the verandah. Some of the others followed their
example in a more languid fashion, but it was, in truth, too hot for
dancing. Nobody pressed Weeta to galop. She seemed outside all that
boisterous commonplace life. Archie Thurston was smoking with Mr.
Wilson and Alec. I felt instinctively that his poetic speech about
Weeta's hair had brought about a reactionary mood, which found vent in
cattle and horse talk. Every now and then conversational scraps floated
towards us. "Have a nip, Thurston," in Mr. Wilson's deep fat tones; and
then, "As fine a lot of horses as ever ran into yard." Allusions to a
certain "slashing chestnut" followed, and later an animated discussion
on the advantage of sending "fats" to the southern market, over the
simpler business of supplying the Stonehampton Meat Preserving
establishment.</p>

<p>Weeta had relapsed into one of her long silences. After a while she
said abruptly, "If I had loved Mr. Thurston, I would not have acted as
Miss Cave did. I would have married him straight away."</p>

<p>"She was not her own mistress. She could not act in defiance of her
guardian."</p>

<p>"Couldn't she! I don't suspect her guardian would have taken ship
after her if she had run away to Australia."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," I said, "Miss Cave will be her own mistress in
a few months, and then she is coming out to Australia."</p>

<p>"Coming out to Australia!" Weeta gave a violent start, and leaned
eagerly forward. "Coming out to be married?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Did he hear that this morning?"</p>

<p>I told her of his call at the cottage and all that I had
learned.</p>

<p>"Coming out to be married!" she repeated, and sank back in the chair
with an indescribable resignation and drooping of limb and voice. It
will be all over then--for him."</p>

<p>"Not all over," I said. "It will be the beginning."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in the same stifled way; "it will be the beginning.
I wonder of what!"</p>

<p>"Of happiness, it is to be hoped," I said lightly.</p>

<p>She did not answer. Mr. Thurston himself came to her a minute or two
later, and asked if she would play. "I want Mrs. Ansdell to hear you,"
he said.</p>

<p>She got up. "Mrs. Ansdell and I have been making friends," she said.
"I think I shall get on with her."</p>

<p>"That is satisfactory, at all events," he replied, and they went
together into the drawing-room, where, though "Il Corricolo" had come
to an end, the Major was still fluttering over the piano. She put the
music for Mr. Thurston on the desk, and got out Weeta's violin. The
girl put herself into one of her attitudes. The sitting-room wall was
of cedar, and its rich brown made an effective background for her
red-gold and green, and her odd mediaeval style of beauty. She seemed
absorbed in the tuning of her violin, and young Thurston, striking a
few chords for keynote, with his head turned sideways towards her,
became absorbed in the contemplation of the picture. Mrs. Wilson, like
a showman, watched his eyes.</p>

<p>She was not admiring Weeta: she was admiring the impression Weeta
produced, and her look at Mr. Thurston had in it something shrewd and
calculating, as if she were reflecting upon the possibilities of his
accession to the family honours. Mr. Thurston was also in his way a
study. I don't think I have done full justice to his good looks and a
charm of frankness, sympathy, and intelligence which he possessed. He
may have been plucked for the army, but he was nevertheless a very
agreeable talker, had an extensive acquaintance with light literature,
and had various artistic gifts. More than this, he had that hall-mark
of birth and breeding and old civilization which is so high a
recommendation to the aspiring Australian.</p>

<p>The young man and the young girl seemed strangely out of keeping
with their unaesthetic surroundings--she perhaps the more so of the
two. It was all odd and inconsistent, but intensely interesting. The
violin in itself was an incongruous feature. Who could expect to see a
young woman handling a fiddle-bow in a bush-parlour? Certainly, no one
could expect that such music would be the result. Weeta played with
great delicacy and execution, and with that rarer thing, soul. There
was a wail of indescribable woe in the adagio of the Kreutzer Sonata
with which they led off. It gave one that exquisite ache of the senses,
that yearning after the impossible, which is the peculiar effect of
some kinds of music. When they came to the presto movement, the notes
were like moonbeams zigzagging on the waves--like the shadows of leaves
dancing on a sunlit verandah.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to imagine that the common passion for music
might create a very strong bond between the two. Is there any more
perfect mode of expressing the harmony of souls? Mr. Thurston's soul
was evidently just then very much in harmony with that of Miss Wilson.
His handsome face was quite poeticized by artistic emotion, as with his
head tilted a little backward he turned his glowing eyes towards her
and claimed her sympathy.</p>

<p>She had come nearer the piano. Her violin seemed to have taken life
from her, and to be a part of her own being. I don't know how to
express the abandonment which her play of feature and arm suggested.
The curve of her elbow was full of unconscious grace. One dreaded the
closing chords. They came at last. She shrivelled in an instant into
stiffness and apathy. With an abrupt gesture she put down the
instrument, and gave a curt refusal to all ontreaties that she would
play once more.</p>

<p>It was time to say good-night, and I drove away with the feeling
that I had been witnessing the opening scene of a promising piece; but
whether it was to be comedy or tragedy, I could not determine.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVII. The Major's Little Game.</h3>

<p>MY diaries of that time, which are sufficiently copious--for when
Alec was away or baby asleep, I had little to do but diarise--confirm
my impression that, dramatically speaking, life at Wombo resolved
itself into Weeta Wilson.</p>

<p>Certainly, we saw a good deal of Mr. Thurston, but that young man,
in spite of his undeniable attractions, in spite also of his expansive
confidences concerning his feelings and experiences generally,
resembled the lover in a certain class of novel in that he was more or
less of a lay figure. Now, Weeta could not be called an expansive young
lady; but even in her taciturn moods she gave food for conjecture.
After her little outburst on the verandah that night, I got nothing for
a long time but "Yes" and "No." It was true that I only saw her in the
evenings--she was shut up in her own rooms till five o'clock--and then
Mr. Thurston was always hanging round. I noticed, however, that her
manner with him was quite incalculable; at some times she scarcely
answered his remarks, and at others she appeared conversational and
even brilliant.</p>

<p>I asked him once what she talked to him about on these latter
occasions.</p>

<p>"Oh, she chaffs me in a kind of fashion," he answered vaguely. "Not
in the regular rough Australian way--you know what that is--but much
more cleverly."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean----" he began, disconcerted. "You know you are
only one quarter colonial, Mrs. Ansdell. You've got light and shade.
That's the Antipodean deficiency--want of shading. It's in
everything--scenery, sky, manners, morals, women especially. They are
all--how shall I say it?--provincial. They want tone--atmosphere. Now,
she has plenty of atmosphere. It's a puzzle to me where she gets
it."</p>

<p>"She" meaning Miss Wilson, I suppose. "But her manners!" I
suggested; "aren't they a little wanting in tone too?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no. She's so beautifully natural. Her manners would
be perfection if she were a duchess. It's her indifference that's so
sublime. But I'm convinced that's only a crust. I believe she is
capable of feeling intensely. In fact, I have a theory that she has an
immensely passionate and romantic nature, and that she knows it, and is
afraid of it, and has put an extinguisher upon herself."</p>

<p>I advised him not to try and remove the extinguisher.</p>

<p>"Whoever succeeds in doing that will run a chance of being
scorched," he said seriously. "But I shall not be that man. You see,
Mrs. Ansdell, Isabel is to me like the mask which chemists put on when
they are pursuing dangerous investigations into the nature of
drugs."</p>

<p>I remarked that his metaphors were a little mixed, and that I had
heard of occasional accidents, in spite of extinguisher and mask; he
laughed, however, and turned the conversation.</p>

<p>It was Alec who took upon himself to inform the Major of Mr.
Thurston's engagement. He drove me over to Barradean a few days before
his departure for Gunyan, with the intention of making his farewell,
and, as he expressed it, "of putting things on the square."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson was seated in the shady end of the verandah, working her
sewing-machine, with the youngest of the Wilson family playing at her
feet. She stopped the treadle, greeted us with effusion, and sent the
child for a cool drink for me, and some of the famous swizzle for Alec.
Weeta was out riding, she told us, and Barradean was almost deserted.
Janie Stern was gone home for a few days, and the two other young
ladies, whose names were respectively Maggie and Clara--I never rightly
got at their surnames--were in Stonehampton for a ball, and had taken
all the young men--the beaux, Mrs. Wilson called them--in
attendance.</p>

<p>"Weeta declared it was much too hot for dancing, and, besides, she
would have had to start this morning, and run the risk of the glare,"
Mrs. Wilson explained. "As for Mr. Thurston," she added, "he didn't
want to go, but those girls chaffed him into it. He doesn't seem to
care about bush larks."</p>

<p>"I suppose that, naturally, an engaged young man is not so keen
after larks as an unattached new chum," said Alec gravely, "especially
when the thermometer is over ninety."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson looked at Alec keenly. "I was not aware that Mr.
Thurston was engaged," she said in a serious tone.</p>

<p>"It's a sufficiently old affair to be taken for granted," said Alec.
"I believe the young lady is coming out to be married."</p>

<p>"If this is true," said Mrs. Wilson, with dignity, "I think Mr.
Thurston ought to have informed us before the partnership was decided
upon."</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that, acting on the Major's advice, Mr.
Thurston had joined his capital to Mr. Wilson's experience, and had
become a partner in one of the latter's northern stations.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Wilson," said Alec, "a deed of partnership is not
invalidated by marriage, like a last will and testament."</p>

<p>"But a working partner who spends his time dangling after a
fine-lady English wife is not likely to increase the profits of the
firm," rejoined the Major with asperity.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Mrs. Wilson," said Alec; "everyone knows that you are the
kindest woman in the world, and surely you would never be hard on two
lovers who have had to bear up against a lot of worry."</p>

<p>"Oh! so there has been some opposition to the match--on Lord
Belmont's part, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, not altogether; you see, Miss Cave--the young lady--is an
heiress, and her guardian had other views. Miss Cave is a friend of my
sister's, and that's how I come to know what has been going on."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," drily observed Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>"It's all over now, though," Alec went on. "Miss Cave will be of age
this very month, and her own mistress. The first use she makes of her
liberty will be to come out to Australia."</p>

<p>"Most indelicate," snapped Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is delicate," said Alec, serenely--"weak lungs. The
doctors have ordered her a sea voyage."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ansdell," began the Major, majestically, "by your own
admissions I gather that this has been a clandestine engagement. I have
a horror of anything underhand, and I should certainly not encourage a
young man for whom I felt partially responsible to keep a promise made
no doubt under pressure, and against the wishes of his relatives."</p>

<p>"I assure you that you are mistaken," exclaimed Alec, warmly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but if Mr. Thurston was not ashamed of his conduct, if he
did not regret this entanglement, why--why did he not confide in me,
his best friend?" Mrs. Wilson broke her thread viciously, and laid the
garment she had been sewing back on the sewing machine, which she
pushed away from her as she half rose in her excitement. "I consider
that the position has been a most unfair one," she went on
angrily--"unfair to me, unfair to himself, unfair to----" She stopped
suddenly. Somebody had appeared in the doorway behind where we sat,
and, before we had time to look round, another voice had taken up her
unfinished sentence. "Unfair to whom, mamma?" The clear, peremptory
tone, thrilling with suppressed feeling, was quite unlike Weeta's usual
unemotional utterance. "Unfair to whom?" she repeated, coming forward,
and recognising our presence only by a sweeping glance, at once frank,
indignant, and appealing. She was in her riding-habit, and had taken
off her hat with its cloud of veils. There was something of a noble
scorn in her air and attitude as she stood balancing herself against
the verandah post.</p>

<p>"Weeta!" cried her mother. "Where have you left Mr. Thurston?"</p>

<p>"Up at the bachelors' quarters," she answered, her voice hardening;
"so you needn't mind speaking out, mamma. I don't suppose it matters
about me if I'm only a doll, as you seem to think, with no brains and
no pride, except pride in my complexion," and she gave an odd, harsh
little laugh.</p>

<p>"Weeta!" again cried Mrs. Wilson, with a scandalized gesture. "Well;
I do think you must be going crazy."</p>

<p>"Not faster than usual," replied Miss Weeta, laughing again. "I know
what you meant to say, mamma--that it wasn't fair on me, Mr. Thurston
keeping back his engagement; but you are doing him an injustice. He
told me he was engaged."</p>

<p>"Oh! He told you!" ejaculated Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>"I dare say it was a measure of precaution," Weeta went on. She had
relapsed now into her ordinary manner. "I dare say he saw, as everybody
else does, that you wanted to catch him as a husband for me."</p>

<p>"Well! How can you!" ineffectually exclaimed the Major. "And before
Mr. and Mrs. Ansdell!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter. They must be very dull not to have seen
through us. It's so stupid pretending when everybody knows it's all
pretence. If I wanted to play any game, I'd play it square. There's
some merit in that. I don't mind at all your knowing my game." She
turned to us with a candour that was mystifying. Mrs. Wilson applied
herself to her buttonholes, and appeared to resign herself to the
inevitable. "It's only the way that I mind. You see, Mrs. Ansdell,
mother and all of us think a great deal of family because we haven't
got it. My grandfather was a shepherd who died knocking down his cheque
in a bush public-house."</p>

<p>"Weeta! be silent!"</p>

<p>"I want to explain to Mrs. Ansdell why we feel it a duty to raise
ourselves, mamma." She began to walk along the verandah.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Wilson," said Alec, "I assure you that we don't want
any explanation."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to have it. You can tell Mr. Thurston, if you
like."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't matter," said Weeta, stopping and gathering some
blossoms from an allamada which festooned the verandah post. "You see,
I'm quite as ambitious as mamma. I'd like to marry into an English
family of lords, or that sort of thing. But we've got no opportunities
here. Pa can't leave his station."</p>

<p>"No, that's it," interjected Mrs. Wilson. "If it hadn't been for
those salt mines!"</p>

<p>"Well, we can't help it," continued Weeta; "and, anyhow, when a lord
comes along in Sydney or Melbourne he's always snapped up by the
Government House set. It was quite natural of mamma to catch on to Mr.
Thurston, who is quite our best opportunity. Only her mistake is that
she makes me too cheap."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure it's you who are making yourself cheap now," said
Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>Weeta did not at once reply. I was watching her, and saw a change
pass over her face. She blenched and coloured as if she were hurt and
ashamed. But she recovered herself directly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered slowly, "it is when girls are foolish enough to
care for a man that they make themselves cheap. How do you know that I
am not laughing at you all in my sleeve? Suppose it's only a matter of
business, and that I'm bent on making the best bargain that
offers?"</p>

<p>She paused and looked at us steadily after she had made this curious
statement.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Alec, "I can only beg you to respect Miss
Cave's right of possession."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked coolly. "Distance should imply a statute of
limitations, I think. If Miss Cave was not prepared to run the risk,
she shouldn't have let him go. Besides, Miss Cave's right, as you call
it, is a question between Mr. Thurston and herself. I have nothing to
do with it. I take things as they come to me, and I don't see that it's
my duty to be bound by other people's first causes. That's what I call
playing a square game."</p>

<p>"It might be suggested that crooked results are an occasional
consequence of your theories, and perhaps one might also venture the
question, Is such a game worth playing?"</p>

<p>"Only under certain conditions," she answered. "I admit that. I
think that Mr. Thurston's elder brother is unmarried, is he not?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Wilson, Thurston's elder brother has the constitution
of an elephant. For goodness sake don't sacrifice Miss Cave's happiness
upon a chance like that."</p>

<p>"I see, you are Miss Cave's knight," she said. "Well, at any rate,
if it comes to battle we shall be fighting in the open. But," she
laughed again, "I should want to be sure that I had something worth
fighting for. Now we all understand each other, don't we?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you in the least," said Alec.</p>

<p>"Do you?" She turned to me, asking the question with a slight tremor
in her softened voice, and a wistful look in her eyes.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Well, you may some day." She left us, passing abruptly into the
drawing-room, and we saw her no more that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson got up from her chair with an embarrassed laugh. We rose
too.</p>

<p>"Well, they always used to say that Weeta had a shingle loose,"
remarked the poor lady, feebly. "Now, does she strike you as being very
eccentric?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Alec, "I admire her worldly wisdom."</p>

<p>"Oh! but she didn't mean what she said," Mrs. Wilson went on in a
puzzled way. "I am sure she doesn't feel like that about Mr. Thurston.
Just think if her affections had been trifled with! There was the
danger."</p>

<p>"It is a danger against which Miss Wilson seems quite able to guard
herself," said Alec. "I confess that I think more of the danger to Miss
Cave. It was in her interests that I asked your good offices."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, she is not married to Mr. Thurston yet. There'll be time
enough to think of her when she comes out," replied Mrs. Wilson,
oracularly, and drew away from the subject. She pressed Alec for
information as to the cattle-carrying capabilities of Gunyan, and then
she commiserated my loneliness, and urged me to take up my abode at
Barradean while Alec was away. "There'll be some fun going on during
the muster," she said. "I suppose you know that Mr. Wilson has made a
sale of twelve hundred store cattle, and a lot of the young men round
are going to help get them in. An excuse for riding parties and dancing
in the evening, I say; but, bless you, I don't mind. It keeps the place
alive."</p>

<p>I promised to spend a week at Barradean while the muster was in
swing, and then we took our leave declining Mrs. Wilson's invitation to
stay for dinner.</p>

<p>On the way home, Alec and I discussed the scene in the verandah. "It
was perfectly shamefaced," said Alec. "By George! talk of a new
civilization. That girl might have gone through a dozen London
seasons--unless, as her mother suggested, her extraordinary honesty was
sheer silliness," and once more he fell to wondering whether Miss Weeta
was very stupid or very clever.</p>

<p>"If she really cares for Mr. Thurston, and took that way of sparing
her pride, she is certainly very clever," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the problem," Alec answered.</p>

<p>Yes, there was the problem. Did she care for Mr. Thurston? On that
supposition only could one forgive her cynical effrontery. It was
impossible to forget that wistful expression of her eyes when she had
asked me if I understood her. I remembered, too, several other small
indications of depths beneath the glassy surface. Was there going to be
a battle between these two women? In this case I had an instinctive
feeling that Isabel Cave would get worsted, and yet I was almost
ashamed to own to myself another instinctive feeling, that were Fate to
decree in favour of her just claim, my sympathies would certainly go
with Weeta. Why? I don't know, unless it is that we are always
attracted by the mysterious, and Weeta was certainly mysterious. There
seemed a kind of analogy between the gauzy folds with which she wrapped
her face and the curious reserve in which she hid her real self.</p>

<p>Alec had an idea that he ought to warn Mr. Thurston. I was much more
certain that it would be utterly dishonourable to repeat what he had
heard in Mrs. Wilson's verandah. Finally, Alec was brought to agree
with me, but he could not help saying, chaffingly, to Mr. Thurston the
next day, "Look here, old fellow, you'll have to be careful about
compromising yourself with Miss Wilson. The Major means business. She
declines to accept the fact that you are already appropriated."</p>

<p>Young Thurston looked discomposed. "Hang the Major!" he said
gloomily; "I wish you wouldn't talk like that. And you are quite
mistaken. Why, she congratulated me only this morning, and asked me
whether I wished my engagement to be made public."</p>

<p>"And what did you answer?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course. I said that I had no right as yet to speak of
it as an engagement."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Alec, profoundly, and murmured as he passed me on his way
to the back verandah to interview one of the hands, "I think I guess
the Major's little game."</p>

<p>Mr. Thurston looked still more uncomfortable when Alec had gone. He
gave me the impression of a man wanting to say something and being
unable to say it. At last he burst out--</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansdell, I don't want you to think me a cad."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," he said vaguely; "only----" He got up and stood by
the fireplace, which just now was a stack of pineapples, his handsome
profile turned towards me. "I wish I knew if--if Miss Cave's coming out
has anything to do with--if it's the cause of her--of Weeta's anger
against me."</p>

<p>"Is she angry with you?" I asked. It struck me as odd that he should
speak of "Miss Cave" and call Weeta by her Christian name.</p>

<p>"I don't know. We had a scene last night. She was so distant and
cold--like a piece of marble. She seemed offended with me about
something. I was hurt; and I--in short, Mrs. Ansdell, I suppose I had
better confess that I made a fool of myself."</p>

<p>"Do you mean----" I began, and stopped, uncertain how to frame the
darting suspicion.</p>

<p>"No, no," he interrupted eagerly. "You don't suppose there was any
actual disloyalty to--why, all my heart belongs to Miss Cave; but I
suppose a fellow can be honestly in love with one woman and yet have a
great regard for another."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"It was her manner. She flared round on me--it was after something I
said about Isabel. I didn't think she had it in her. She asked me what
claim I had upon her sympathy, why I should expect her to hold out her
arms to my future wife. I didn't expect it. I don't know what I
expected. The fact is," he concluded, lamely, "I suppose I'm a fool. I
think I had better go away altogether."</p>

<p>I could not help saying that I agreed with him, at which he seemed
annoyed. "That's nonsense, of course. It would be assuming what is
unwarrantable. You have every right to think me a cad," he exclaimed,
with a sudden burst of self-accusation. "I think myself one while I
speak. Besides," he went on, in a different tone, "I should be
neglecting my business if I were to go. I am her father's partner now,
and there's this muster. We have got to collect cattle for the northern
station as well. I must stay for that."</p>

<p>I was puzzled, and began to be sorrier than ever for Weeta.</p>

<p>"I wish she would take you into her confidence," he said
impulsively. "I wish you would tell me if there's anything I could
do."</p>

<p>"Or leave undone," I could not help saying. "Perhaps you have done
too much already."</p>

<p>"She was flirting with that young man from the bank all the evening
afterwards," Mr. Thurston went on dejectedly.</p>

<p>"I thought she never flirted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in her way."</p>

<p>"And I thought he was devoted to Janie Stern?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's only a pis aller. Everybody knows she refused him."</p>

<p>He fidgeted about for a minute or two, then looked uneasily at his
watch. "I ought to go. I promised to ride with them. They are going to
the beach to get oysters."</p>

<p>He went away, and I saw nothing of him for several days. Alec
started to Gunyan next morning and I was left alone with baby. For the
first week I repulsed Mrs. Wilson's offers of companionship, and
continued to evade her invitations to Barradean. Late one afternoon
Weeta herself called. I was struck anew with the marvellous beauty of
her complexion when she put up her veils, but her face looked, I
thought, a little pale and anxious, and she talked a great deal more
than was usual with her, though I had already observed that it was when
her mother was present that she was most silent.</p>

<p>"It's the heat," she said, in reply to my comment upon her
appearance, "and I am rather tired. They are such a noisy set. The men
are out all day; but there are the girls and mother and the children.
As for the men, being out all day doesn't tire them. At any rate, they
always want to dance in the evenings."</p>

<p>"Who are with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual set--young Stern and some of the people round. And
Mr. Humphreys--though he has other things than the muster to think
of--comes down about sundown. You don't know how I hate them all."</p>

<p>"But you did not always hate them?"</p>

<p>"No. The old thing is that once I rather liked one of them. I was
half--inclined to marry him--I dare say should have married him if his
luck had come to him when he first asked me."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean, and what is his luck?"</p>

<p>"I mean Mr. Humphreys. Haven't you heard of Mount Jessop? They are
all terribly excited about it at home."</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, there was a great gold craze up in Stonehampton a few years
ago; nobody was happy unless they were in some mine--or in
half-a--dozen--there were mines being taken up everywhere. Scarcely one
of them turned out any good, and I should think that unfortunate Mr.
Sabine, who was killed at the races, was the only person who made money
out of them. So much was lost that people got disgusted, and dropped
the whole thing. Good gracious! I'm telling you quite a history; but
now I've got to Mr. Humphreys. He and some of the Stonehampton people
bought up Mount Jessop, and have been working it in a languid fashion,
losing steadily till just lately, when they struck a wonderful yield;
and now it is said that the mine promises to be one of the richest in
the world."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Humphreys may blossom into a millionaire! Isn't Miss Janie
Stern very happy?"</p>

<p>"He will not marry Janie Stern," said Weeta, shortly. "He has given
her the cold shoulder this week, and she is very unhappy."</p>

<p>"That means, I suppose, that he hopes now he is rich to marry
you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she answered. "What do you think, Mrs. Ansdell?
Which pays best, rank or riches? You know I told you the other day that
I was bent on making the best bargain that I could."</p>

<p>"You said a great many foolish things which you didn't mean in the
least, and which I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"No, you have not forgotten, nor have I. I meant every word of them.
However, Mr. Humphreys' riches are not quite a reliable quantity yet. I
think I had better wait a little while and see how Mount Jessop turns
out, and in the meantime Miss Cave may have arrived. There would be
some excitement in that." She rose and stood irresolutely. "Oh, I hate
them all!" she cried.</p>

<p>She looked as if she were struggling with some emotion which
threatened to break forth, and put out her hand involuntarily towards
me. It seemed an appeal for sympathy. Then she recovered herself, and
half drew it back. "Good-bye," she said.</p>

<p>I kept her hand. "I wish I could help you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. I almost think that I could talk to you, if you would
not be horrified at all my mercenary and base ideas. Come and stay at
Barradean. Mother sent me over to ask you to come to-morrow. Father
will bring the buggy for you. There's a crib all ready for the baby.
Say you will come. I want you. You may not think it possible, but I
do."</p>

<p>"Then I will come," and the matter was arranged.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVIII. Mr. Thurston's Accident.</h3>

<p>BUT when I got to Barradean, Weeta was in one of her strangest and
most taciturn moods, and showed no particular pleasure at seeing me.
She spent the greater part of the day in her own room, except meal
times and late in the afternoon, when the horses were brought round and
she came out veiled and dressed for her ride. Afterwards she changed
her habit for one of her fantastic evening costumes, and allowed
herself to be adored till bedtime. Weeta's room was large, cool, and
dark, and was situated on the most shady side of the house. The windows
were so high and so well blinded, that it would have been difficult for
the glare to penetrate, and the venetians of the door opening on the
verandah were always kept closed. The walls were of cedar, and were
curiously ornamented with the stuffed skins of parrots and the
harp-like plumage of the lyre-bird--her trophies, she called them. She
had once had a mania for such collections, and they had been supplied,
presumably, by her various suitors. The room was furnished partly as a
parlour, with a sofa, a large bookcase, a writing-table, and even a
piano, but she played most often on the violin, to which she devoted
several hours of the day. It was the custom in the drowsy part of the
afternoon for those who liked music to gather at that end of the
verandah and listen to her practising. She took no notice of our
presence, often going over the same passage a dozen times as
conscientiously as though she were a pupil in a musical academy. I
noticed that when Mr. Humphreys came over from Saturday till Monday, he
would in a furtive way make for this corner and sit ruminatively
smoking until Janie Stern routed him out to help her gather pineapples
or melons. Mr. Thurston, too, was frequently to be found at that
corner, but never at the same time as Mr. Humphreys. He always looked
guilty when I came upon him on these occasions, and very speedily made
some excuse for leaving his position. Then it sometimes happened that
Weeta would call me into her room and ask me if I would like to look
over her books, or she would beg me to listen to some particular air
and would make me lie on the sofa while she played to me, but she never
spoke of Mr. Thurston or made any allusion to her burst of
confidence--if, indeed, as I sometimes suspected, she had not been all
the while playing a part.</p>

<p>She was certainly a curious girl. Her room showed traces of a
variety of employments. Had she been brought up amid artistic
surroundings, she would probably have been a painter or sculptor. As it
was, she was fond of modelling little figures in the soft clay from the
creek, and had them arranged on a shelf over her writing-table, in
constantly varying combinations and groups, which suggested the idea
that she was carrying out some drama of her own imagining, and these
were the marionette performers. Her sense of colour, which was
extraordinary, seemed to find its satisfaction by means of Judson's
dyes. She spent a good deal of time in copying tints of flowers and
leaves, and in adapting them to those wonderful evening costumes, which
she wore with an entire absence of self-consciousness, and of the
girlish vanity so evident, for example, in Janie Stern's arrangements
of starched muslin and fluttering ribbons.</p>

<p>There was something tempestuous in the Barradean atmosphere which
was not a consequence of the stir and bustle of the muster. That was
easy to be seen. The Major was more than usually fussy, and, it must be
owned, extremely ill-tempered. Her ostentatious benevolence to her
guests had even a flavour of vinegar. Her bangles and the ornaments of
her ch&acirc;telaine clinked in an aggressive manner. Her black eyes
and her artificial teeth seemed to vie with each other in lustre. She
scolded the servants, was sharp to the children, and treated Thurston
with a far less maternal solicitude, and snubbed Mr. Wilson in wrathful
majesty when he ventured to complain that she had put a smaller
quantity of rum in the swizzle. I don't know whether he contrived to
gain private access to the cellaret, or whether the sun was to blame,
but certainly as the day advanced his face grew more and more fiery,
his manners more free and jovial, and his domestic revelations more
indiscreet. He told me that Mr. Thurston's engagement had been a blow
to the "Missus," but that for his own part, if Mount Jessop turned out
all that was expected, he should consider it a providential
arrangement. "For, I tell you what it is, Mrs. Ansdell," he said, "the
Missus is just cracked on the aristocracy; but, to my thinking, it's
better any day to be the wife of a millionaire than the daughter-in-law
of an earl. Not that Humphreys is a millionaire," he added, "but there
is no knowing when he may be."</p>

<p>As for Mr. Humphreys, there could be no doubt as to his sentiments
about Weeta. He was not a clever young man, nor was he particularly
fascinating. He was of the Australian type--tall, lean, angular,
good--looking, but distinctly crude. He was probably a much finer
fellow in essentials than Archie Thurston, but he sadly lacked the
graces of an old--world civilization. His musical attainments were
limited to a comic song, and a solo on the concertina which made Weeta
shudder. He read a great deal, and, like most persons who have learned
life from books, referred often to his favourite authors. Yet all his
cultivation was elementary, and the shores of the Pacific bounded his
horizon. He had no background, whereas that seemed the most important
ingredient in Archie Thurston's personality. He was frank, simple, and
sincere, boyishly elated at his prospect of fortune, and evidently a
little embarrassed by his relations with Miss Janie Stern, which his
manner seemed to convey were entirely unpremeditated and merely the
result of disappointed affection. He was doing his best to draw out of
them in a manly way, and to make it clear to all that he had no
intention of serious entanglement in that direction. Probably Janie was
piqued, and wanted to show him that she did not care, for she helped
him a good deal by starting a flirtation with one of the "mustering"
young men. It was certain that something had occurred lately to revive
Mr. Humphreys' hopes in regard to Weeta. He hung upon her words and
looks. It was almost touching to see his eager delight when she singled
him out to ride with her--Weeta had a royal way of indicating her
preferences. This often happened, though Mr. Thurston generally
contrived to come home early from the run, and make one of the party.
When Mr. Humphreys was there he fell with a bad grace to me; but on the
afternoons when Mr. Humphreys remained at Stonehampton he rode beside
Weeta, though as far as I could see they interchanged scarcely a word.
Our rides were usually along the sandy shore. We would gallop over the
crisp wet beach, the salt wind blowing in our faces; and then a mad
spirit would sometimes seize Weeta, and, all veiled as she was, she
would turn her horse straight into the sea, and ride out breasting the
waves till they wetted her habit, and dashed spray as high as her head.
One day a memorable thing happened. It was Saturday. We were a large
party, which, however, did not include Mr. Humphreys. Mr. Thurston was
with us, Mr. Wilson also, and most of the young men staying at the
bachelors' quarters. Mr. Thurston was riding a young horse, and later
Weeta gave this as a reason for forbidding him to come near her. I
fancy they had had a quarrel, for when we started they rode behind
together. We had not got far when both galloped up. He was savagely
tearing at the bit, and the horse had its head down, as if it were
inclined to buck.</p>

<p>"Take care, Thurston," called out Mr. Wilson, "you'll have an
accident."</p>

<p>"We have had one already," said Weeta, composedly. "I don't want Mr.
Thurston to come within six yards of me. Our horses don't like each
other."</p>

<p>Mr. Thurston pulled back beside me.</p>

<p>"You're not afraid, Mrs. Ansdell? The brute is all right. It was
only that I dug my spurs into him, and he lashed out. She made me
angry."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what galling things she can say in that soft,
indifferent voice," he exclaimed. "She goads me into forgetting myself,
and making speeches that I'd rather bite my tongue out than utter."</p>

<p>"What sort of things?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Things that are unwomanly and abominable. She talks as if she were
ready to sell herself to the highest bidder, Humphreys or any one else.
And yet--you know," he added excitedly, "she has the face of an angel.
I don't believe--I will not believe that she is so hard and
mercenary."</p>

<p>"Why should it matter to you? If all that Alec tells me is true you
have, at any rate, managed to secure an angel for yourself."</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and gave a little start. "Yes, that is true--I
have managed to get hold of an angel, little as I deserve it. It ought
not to matter to me whether that girl is one or not. I am the happiest
man in the world. Do you know that she sails this month?"</p>

<p>"You have heard?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has an opportunity of coming out with some friends who are
going round the world--Australia, China, Japan, America, and the rest
of it. I don't think she will go round the world--just yet. I am to
meet them at Stonehampton. Only think of it, Mrs. Ansdell--never to
have changed--it is four years since we parted--and now to meet
again!"</p>

<p>But there was nothing rapturous in his tone; and while he spoke his
eyes were following Weeta as she rode ahead, her graceful form swaying
to the motion of her horse, her right hand holding a great bough of
wild hibiscus against her veiled cheek. She had a knack of
attitudinizing picturesquely with her bits of blossom and greenery.
This served her instead of a whip.</p>

<p>"She is like Isabel," he said, as if pursuing a train of thought. "I
suppose that is why it jars upon me when she says such things. Yes, she
does remind me of Isabel, though there's no real resemblance. It is
quite tantalizing at times, when she has her face covered and I see
only the turn of her head and the coils of her hair. I keep fancying
that Isabel is under the veil. Of course, it's nonsense; but one can't
help fancies, or the way in which fancies influence us. If she were not
like Isabel, I suppose I shouldn't care."</p>

<p>Was it only the influence of fancy? I wondered. He became silent,
and his horse, which was very restive and uncomfortable, gave excuse
for the breaking of conversation.</p>

<p>We rode to the end of the rocky point which closed one side of Wombo
Bay. It was low tide, and from the cliff a long, narrow strip of
shingle and rock stretched a long way into the sea. Many of the party
dismounted, and began to knock off oysters from the cliff, and there
was some suggestion of a fire and of tea. Weeta declined to assist in
the entertainment. "You know that I hate gathering oysters," she
replied, rather peevishly, to Janie Stern's invitation. "I shall stay
on my horse."</p>

<p>I was one of those who dismounted; but I left the shade of the cliff
and walked along the line of rocks, jagged, wet, and slippery, with
periwinkles and sea-weed clinging to their black surface, till I had
got too far out to be quite comfortable. I turned back a little, and
stood looking out to sea, ready to lose myself in a dream. The day was
still, and the waves only lapped the rocks. It was sundown, and the
ocean took a faint pink tinge as it spread out in unbroken loneliness
to the horizon. There was something melancholy in the vastness and
loneliness of the Pacific. I thought of Isabel Cave speeding across its
bosom to the arms of her lover. Was he, in very truth and heart, her
lover? There was a sound of horses' feet on the shingle. Weeta, after
her fashion, was riding out to sea. She had her veils up, and her face
was like that of a spirit in its paleness. She looked down at me for a
moment as she passed. The beach was so narrow that her habit brushed my
shoulder. "I think this is the end of the world," she said, "and that
is the beginning of another one. I've always longed, ever since I was a
little child, to ride to another world." She struck her horse with the
hibiscus branch till it broke into a canter. I called after her to be
careful, but she only laughed. Then there was a rush of other horses'
feet past me, and I saw that Mr. Thurston was following her. He rode
right into the sea by her side.</p>

<p>"For God's sake," he said, "don't be so foolhardy."</p>

<p>She stopped and looked round at him quite quietly. I could hear
distinctly what was said.</p>

<p>"What is there foolhardy about this? There's not wind enough to blow
me away."</p>

<p>"No, but there are currents, and suppose your horse were to take
fright and to throw you on to those rocks?"</p>

<p>"You had far better take care of your own horse; it is much more
likely to do something desperate. Mine is quiet enough. I advise you to
go back." His horse was indeed plunging and shying and dashing up the
spray. He succeeded, however, in quieting it for the moment.</p>

<p>"And give up the only chance I've had to-day of being near you. No,
if you choose to run into danger, I'll stop there with you."</p>

<p>"That is nonsense. Why don't you go back? I told you to keep away
from me."</p>

<p>"You've been telling me that every day for the last fortnight," he
said sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you obey me?"</p>

<p>"Because you don't mean what you say."</p>

<p>"Oh! You think I want you to stay beside me. Again, why?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered slowly, "you don't hate me as much as you try
to make me believe."</p>

<p>She turned upon him this time with a kind of suppressed fury in her
look and voice. "Ah! you play a manly part, truly--a part that is
likely to confirm me in my admiration for English gentlemen. Your
vanity won't allow you to let yourself be dropped. You don't like to
think I was only amusing myself, experimentalizing, or, if you like to
put it that way, judging of my value in the English market. I think I
prefer the Australian one, and that galls you. You have been trying all
these days to entrap me into a confession that I am piqued, that I care
for you. Should I be likely to make that confession to the promised
husband of another woman, even if it were true? You are quite right: I
don't hate you. I don't care for you enough to hate you. I only despise
you. Now, will you leave me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I must go where you cannot follow me." She urged her horse on
to the very point of the spur till its feet slipped on the wet rocks
and the waves washed up against its forelegs. I was frightened, and
cried out, entreating them to turn. But he stuck spurs into his horse,
and pursued her, it seemed into the ocean. The two horses, with their
riders, were outlined against the reddened sea and sky. His snorted and
reared. It was a dramatic scene. He laid his hand upon her bridle. "You
shall come with me," he said, with an almost brutal determination. His
words and action appeared to incense her. I saw her lift the hibiscus
bough and strike at his horse as she wrenched herself free.</p>

<p>"You go too far," she exclaimed. "What right have you over me?"</p>

<p>There was wild confusion for a moment. It was a struggle in the sea.
He gave a reproachful cry.</p>

<p>"What right? None. But, if you will have it--I love you." The words
broke from him as though he were incapable of holding them in any
longer. As she struck his horse it swerved, kicked, and, putting its
head down, bucked furiously. The spray which it raised obscured them
both. I shrieked to those under the cliff. It was all over in a moment.
I saw that Mr. Thurston had been thrown. The horse's hoofs seemed to
trample on his head, as the maddened animal freed itself from the
saddle, and, with a frantic dash, made for the cliff. A second or two
later Weeta's horse followed, riderless also.</p>

<p>There was a rush of people behind me along the strip of shingle.
When I reached the place where Mr. Thurston had been thrown, I saw that
Weeta was unhurt. She was slowly lifting herself up from the rocks. Her
hat had fallen into the sea; her hair was loose. I shall never forget
the agony of her face. "Look!" she said, pointing to her habit. It was
streaked and spotted with blood, and with something more horrible than
blood. "I have killed him," she said, with unnatural calm. "It is I who
have done it--and he loved me!"</p>

<p>He lay perfectly still. There was a frightful gash on his head; his
face and hair were bathed in blood. It spattered the rocks, and a pool
had gathered and was trickling into the sea. The sight was too
sickening. I could not look. But Weeta's eyes were fixed with a
terrible fascination on all that remained of the man she loved. Yes, I
felt sure in that awful moment she loved him. "I have killed him," she
repeated, still in that quiet voice.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Mrs. Ansdell, take her away," whispered Mr. Wilson,
who had reached the spot. "This comes of that damned fooling with young
horses. The poor fellow's brains are dashed out. Go, all of you," he
shouted to the others who were crowding and pressing forward--"all
except some of the men. And let someone ride to the station for a
stretcher and linen bandages, and another to Wombo--quick!--for the
doctor."</p>

<p>I don't know how we reached home. Some of us forded the inlet, and
clambered up by my cottage to Wombo, and I ran in and collected linen
and such restoratives as occurred to me, and gave them to the blackboy
who was with us, bidding him hasten back to the scene of the accident;
while others galloped on to the house of Mr. Gill, the doctor. He was
at home, fortunately. We met him riding down as for his life, with his
case of instruments strapped before him, as Weeta and I turned out of
the cottage gate. She had helped me to tear a sheet into strips, but
had never spoken a word. Her face was like that of one petrified in an
act of horror.</p>

<p>"They will take him to Barradean by the lower road," I said. "It is
smoother than this. Courage, Weeta, there may be hope yet."</p>

<p>"There is none," she said. "I have killed him. Don't speak to me.
Let me go home and hide myself."</p>

<p>I obeyed. We cantered back in silence. The others had already
reached Barradean. Janie Stern was crying in the verandah. Mr.
Humphreys had arrived from Stonehampton on his usual visit from
Saturday till Monday. He was evidently watching for us, and looked pale
and shocked. He went immediately to Weeta and held out his arms to lift
her from her horse; but she shuddered and motioned him off. "No, go
away. Let me be," she said, in a stifled voice, and walked straight
through to her own room.</p>

<p>Mr. Humphreys caught my hand eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ansdell, have pity on me. Does she care?"</p>

<p>"Is that all you think of?" I cried indignantly--"only if she cares?
You don't mind whether he is living or dead."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he answered humbly. "I would bring him back to life at
the risk of my own if I could. But she is all the world to me, and what
she feels is the only thing I can think of now."</p>

<p>"And he is all the world to her," I said, "and that is all she can
think of now."</p>

<p>I did not mean to be cruel. The words broke from me involuntarily,
and I was sorry when I saw how they had hurt him. He left me without
speaking, and just then Mrs. Wilson came out, deeply agitated.</p>

<p>She drew me along the verandah towards Weeta's room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ansdell, this is awful!" she cried. "We have sent to
Stonehampton for another doctor and for a nurse. Have you heard? Young
Stern has just come to tell us what Gill said. They are carrying him on
a stretcher. He is alive, but there is very little hope. He must be
nursed day and night, and Gill has ordered us to get ready the coolest
room in the house."</p>

<p>"Then he must be put into mine," said Weeta. She had come out while
her mother was speaking. "Let us get it ready at once; don't waste
time."</p>

<p>The news that he was alive seemed to have roused her. She lost her
stony look, and with feverish energy dragged things from the wardrobes
and drawers, and helped to prepare the chamber for his occupation. It
was all ready when the measured tread of the bearers sounded on the
verandah. Then Weeta slunk away, as if she dreaded the sight, to the
room next mine which she had taken.</p>

<p>We could hear the sound of his being carried in, and the voices of
Mrs. Wilson and the doctor, as things were got ready and orders given.
Then there was silence. They were waiting for the Stonehampton doctor.
Darkness fell. It was long past the hour for dinner. All the life and
movement of the house seemed stopped. Weeta stood motionless at the
foot of the bed, still in her disordered habit. At last she became
conscious of the stains upon it, and gave a moan of horror. "Take it
away," she said hoarsely. "Give me something to put on."</p>

<p>I undressed and re-clothed her as if she had been a child, and
brushed and coiled up her beautiful hair. There was relief in the
occupation.</p>

<p>When it was done, baby awoke and cried, and I took her in my arms to
soothe her, and we three waited for the verdict.</p>

<p>It came at length. There was the faintest shadow of hope that he
might live; but there was the awful probability that his brain would be
permanently injured.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIX. Dreams.</h3>

<p>MR. THURSTON lay unconscious for many days, and the doctors could
not tell if he would live or die. The house party at Barradean was
broken up, and the muster carried on as quietly as could be, from the
bachelors' quarters. The Sterns went back to their own station, and Mr.
Humphreys ceased to come over from Stonehampton. I would have gone home
also, but that Mrs. Wilson pressed me so urgently to remain, and I
thought that perhaps I might be of use to Weeta.</p>

<p>I was disappointed in that hope, however; her reserve was
unconquerable. She never alluded to that wild avowal which I had
overheard. Perhaps in the agitation of after events she had forgotten
that I had been a listener. Then I had felt sure that she loved Archie
Thurston. Now, again, I was doubtful. If she loved him, would it not be
natural that she should speak? Yet that she suffered deeply, I was
certain. Night after night I heard her walking up and down her room,
unable to sleep. Her face was pale and worn, and had a tortured
expression. I could not help thinking how more than ever Archie would
pronounce it like that of an afflicted mediaeval angel. She seemed even
to have lost care of her complexion, and would sit for hours unveiled
and unoccupied in the granadilla-covered arcade. I think she may have
missed the outlet of music. In these days her violin was silent, and
indeed all sound in the house was kept as much as possible hushed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gill stayed in the house, and the Stonehampton doctor rode out
once a day. The weather got cooler, out of consideration, one might
fancy, to the sick man, and there came at last a day when he woke out
of his stupor. He was still dazed and very weak, but in a dim kind of
way he recognised the people round him. It was a marvellous recovery,
they all said. "When one thinks," Mrs. Wilson observed, "that part of
his brain was actually scattered on the ground!" But I have noticed
that recoveries in the Australian bush are often marvellous. Perhaps it
is the pure air; perhaps it is--in most cases--the temperate way of
living; perhaps it is the absence of skilled surgeons and the necessity
for leaving much to Nature--anyhow, Nature does what science in other
countries seems totally unable to accomplish.</p>

<p>Once Mr. Thurston began to mend, he got well, physically speaking,
with amazing rapidity. At the end of six weeks he could be moved into a
lounging-chair in the verandah outside his room. The first two days he
lay without speaking, content, it seemed, to watch the shadows of the
vine leaves flicker on the verandah, and the darting lizards as they
played about the wooden steps. He looked very gaunt and thin, and there
was a curious dazed expression in his eyes. His beard had grown while
he had been lying ill, and the baldness of his head where that great
seam crossed it was covered by a skull-cap. It was uncertain still how
much he realized of what had happened, and of what was going on around
him.</p>

<p>When I first went near him he only smiled, but did not pronounce my
name, though later I saw that he knew who I was. Mrs. Wilson he
recognised always, but then she had been constantly in and out of his
room. Weeta refused to see him. I don't know whether this was from
nervous shrinking, or whether she was really afraid that he would
upbraid her. There is no doubt that his brain was in a confused and
cloudy state, and by-and-by it became clear that a veil had fallen, as
it were, between the accident and all that had gone before, and that
the further back he forced his memory, the more distant became the
images. I wondered if he knew that Isabel Cave was actually on her way
out. A letter from Alec's sisters had mentioned the time of her
approaching departure, and had begged me to take her under my
protection, as it was not probable that her friends would care to
remain at Stonehampton, though she might, if she wished, join them
later in Sydney or Melbourne. I speculated within myself as to whether
she would or would not complete her tour of the world with them. By my
calculations, her steamer would be due just six weeks from now.</p>

<p>At this time a strange and unexpected event happened, which
completely changed the aspect of Mr. Thurston's affairs. One morning
Mrs. Wilson came into the darkened drawing-room where Weeta and I were
sitting, in a state of perturbation in which there was an odd mingling
of exultancy and disappointment. She had a newly-arrived newspaper in
one hand, and a bundle of letters surmounted by the blue envelope of a
telegraphic message in the other.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansdell, what ought I to do? Here are all Mr. Thurston's
letters, and a telegram has just come for him from England. I know it
is bad news. Should it be given to him?"</p>

<p>Weeta rose agitatedly. "What bad news? Of course he should not be
told. Do you want to drive away his reason?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson turned to her with an expression of deep dejection. "Ah!
if things had been different--if only you had played your cards as you
might, this would have meant great news for you."</p>

<p>"What in the name of goodness do you mean, mamma? The news? I know
what other thought is in your mind. You mean if I had been engaged to
Mr. Thurston."</p>

<p>"If you had been engaged to Mr. Thurston, you would have had the
certainly of becoming Countess of Belmont. Mr. Thurston's brother is
dead. It is in the telegraphic summary." She held out the newspaper and
pointed to a paragraph, which we both read, and which told of the
death, by an accident in the hunting-field, of Lord Colworth, eldest
son of the Earl of Belmont.</p>

<p>I could not help exclaiming at the strange coincidence by which,
almost at the same time, one of the two brothers had been killed, and
the other nearly so, in an accident on horseback. Weeta stood very
thoughtful and silent.</p>

<p>"Then there are these letters," continued Mrs. Wilson. "Some are by
the last English mail. I have kept them back. It is impossible to say,
in the present state of Mr. Thurston's mind, how much he remembers, and
what the effect of a shock might be on his brain."</p>

<p>"Give me the letters," said Weeta, suddenly. "I want to look at
them."</p>

<p>She took the packet from her mother and carefully examined each
envelope.</p>

<p>"Are they all here?" she asked, fixing her penetrating eyes upon
Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>I fancied that Mrs. Wilson hesitated. "All! Yes. Why--why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to be sure whether there was a letter from Miss Cave."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Wilson, "that would agitate him. Is there one among
them?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do that there is not," answered Weeta. "Both
these English letters have the Belmont stamp on the envelope. Are you
sure that you have not kept one back?"</p>

<p>"Weeta! Well, I declare, this is abominable--that my own child
should doubt my word!" cried Mrs. Wilson indignantly.</p>

<p>I suspected then, however--a fact of which I became certain
later--that Isabel Cave had written, and that Mrs. Wilson, for purposes
of her own, had purloined the letter.</p>

<p>"I know that you like to manage other people's affairs, mamma," said
Weeta, coolly, "and I thought you might want to manage Mr. Thurston's.
Never mind, there are the letters. I think you had better keep them and
the telegram till you have got Dr. Hayllar's authority."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Wilson, "that seems reasonable, and it takes the
responsibility from my shoulders. Mrs. Ansdell, will you come out and
see Mr. Thurston? I can't think why you don't come, Weeta."</p>

<p>"I will come when he asks for me," she said, and sat down again with
her book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson locked up the letters in her writing-table, and then
drew me out to the verandah. But she paused at the door, and went back
to draw one of the venetians closer. Then she crossed to her daughter,
and looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"I declare," she said, "that freckle is coming back again. I don't
know how you are to get on if you lose your complexion." She spoke in
an aggrieved tone, as if she were not altogether satisfied with some
work of art of which she had become the possessor. "I think you might
do something to help me," she continued, in a low, angry voice, "when I
am working for your good, instead of sitting like a stock or
stone."</p>

<p>I waited for her no longer, but made my way to the end of the
verandah where Mr. Thurston was sitting. He looked stronger and a
little more alert to-day, but his face had a puzzled expression as if
he were trying to find the clue to a problem which baffled him.</p>

<p>In reply to my questions he said that he was better--much better. "I
have walked to the end of the verandah," he added. "I should be quite
well if I did not feel so confoundedly dazed and stupid."</p>

<p>"You must remember that you had a very bad blow on your head."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it, I suppose. There seems a sort of mist over a mist
like the spray of the sea. It hides one face that I want to remember,
and I can't see it--I can't see it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I suggested, "it is because the person you are thinking
of is very far away, and you have not seen her for a long time--four
years it may be?"</p>

<p>I watched him in some anxiety as to how the shot would tell, but he
only looked at me helplessly. "Is that it? You may be right. I don't
know. I can't think, I can't even recollect her name. If I could but
see her face, everything would become clear."</p>

<p>I did not dare to venture further then. Presently he asked abruptly,
"What room did they put me into? I never was there before."</p>

<p>"The doctor said that you were to have the coolest room in the
house, and Miss Wilson gave you up hers."</p>

<p>The name did not seem to convey any definite personal idea to his
mind. "Miss Wilson," he repeated vaguely. "Yes, I know, the Veiled
Princess. They told me about her. Do you know," he went on, "what has
been haunting me all this time? It is the adagio movement in the
Krcutzer Sonata. She used to play it long ago on her violin."</p>

<p>"Miss Wilson plays it," I said; "but she has not touched her violin
since you have been ill."</p>

<p>"But I am not ill any longer," he said eagerly. "I wish she would
play it to me. I think it would make me remember her."</p>

<p>"Would you like Miss Wilson to come and play to you?" I said. "Are
you quite sure that you are strong enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he answered, impatiently. "Ask her to come."</p>

<p>I went back to the drawing-room to find Weeta. As I approached it, I
heard the sound of Mrs. Wilson's voice raised angrily, and then the
slamming of a door. Weeta was alone when I entered. She was leaning
back in her chair, with two hands pressed against her forehead, and I
saw that her frame was convulsed with sobs.</p>

<p>"Weeta," I said.</p>

<p>She took away her hands. Her face had a nervous, frightened
expression: it was evident that she was quite unstrung. I had already
guessed that, in spite of her composure and extreme reserve, she was of
a sensitive, impressionable temperament, with a physical terror of
anything like rough speech or action. This was the secret of Mrs.
Wilson's influence over her.</p>

<p>"You see," said Weeta, as if interpreting my thoughts, "I am shaken
to pieces and ready to do or promise anything. Mamma can turn me as she
chooses so long as she scolds hard enough. Well, never mind."</p>

<p>I told her that I did mind, and tried to make her open her
heart.</p>

<p>But she was obstinate and hard. "What does it matter? Mamma is
disappointed that I am never to be Lady--what is it?"</p>

<p>"Colworth," I suggested.</p>

<p>"So he is Lord Colworth now. How strange it seems! Who would have
been Lord Colworth, I wonder, if I had really killed him?" She
shuddered. "You think I did not feel it much. I have been down into
hell since that day."</p>

<p>"I know it," I said.</p>

<p>"But not for the reason that you think," she exclaimed fiercely. "Or
was it in heaven? I am not sure. I think that for one little moment I
was in heaven." She got up and walked to the fireplace, and looked at
herself in the glass above it. "Mamma does not know that I have it in
my power even still," she murmured, then pulled herself together with a
hysterical laugh. "I'm talking great nonsense. I want a safety-valve. I
shall take my violin away into the bush and worry it all out with
myself and it there."</p>

<p>"You need not do that," I answered. "I came in to tell you Mr.
Thurston is very anxious that you should play to him--The Krcutzer
Sonata."</p>

<p>She made an eager movement. "He has asked for me, then?"</p>

<p>"He has asked for music. It is an experiment. I am half afraid of
it. He wants to hear the adagio because he thinks that it may bring to
him a face that he wants to remember--a woman's face; and he does not
connect it with you, for he spoke of you composedly as Miss Wilson and
the Veiled Princess."</p>

<p>She flushed. "I will play to him," she said, "and at first he shall
not see my face."</p>

<p>She took her violin from its case, and followed me along the
verandah; but, instead of going round to the side, she went into a
room, the French windows of which looked out on the place where he was
sitting.</p>

<p>She opened the venetians and gazed out at him unseen. He was lying
back wearily, but the weariness seemed more of mind than of body. He
looked very handsome and very helpless. It was a sight that might well
have touched the heart of a woman who loved him. Weeta's breast heaved,
and a wave of tenderness swept her face--a mingling of remorse and
affection--the look that one might fancy on the face of a mother as she
gazed at a child whom she herself had maimed. She placed herself behind
the half-open venetian and began to string her violin. He stirred at
the sound, and turned inquiringly to Mrs. Wilson, who was sewing near
him. She seemed surprised, but an expression of triumphant exultation
softened her hard features.</p>

<p>"She is going to play," Mr. Thurston said. "Ah, now I shall
know."</p>

<p>"Know what?" Mrs. Wilson asked vaguely; but, before he answered,
Weeta played the opening bars. Everyone knows the melody. I have always
thought it exquisitely pathetic, but now the player's very soul seemed
to have gone into the strain. It was full of melancholy passion, of
regret, of yearning. This was the language which she and Archie
Thurston understood. He raised himself in his chair and sat listening
intently, his face rapt, and a bright, clear light in his eyes, such as
had not visited them since his accident.</p>

<p>The movement came to an end, and the last notes of the violin died
away. Mr. Thurston rose to his feet and put his arms out with an
excited gesture. "I know it all now," he said. "Where is she? Why does
she not come? Why will she not let me see her face?"</p>

<p>"Weeta," said Mrs. Wilson, rising too. "Weeta, come."</p>

<p>"Weeta!" he repeated again, with that slightly puzzled look and
intonation, as if he did not clearly connect the name with what was in
his own mind. "Will she not come? I want to tell her all I feel. I have
no doubt now. That is what has been tormenting me all this time. I
could not make it clear to my mind. And now I know. The music has
brought it all back. Oh, tell her that I must see her face--that I must
say to her what is in my heart!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson crossed rapidly to the door of the room within which we
stood. She pushed back the venetians, and drew her daughter forth into
the verandah. "You hear," she said. "It is for you that he cares."</p>

<p>The whole scene seems like one in a play. Weeta stood with her
violin still held against her neck, her wonderful red hair framing her
face, which was all alive and tremulous with emotion, her lips parted
slightly, her eyes shining, and a faint pink flush suffusing her
transparent cheek. Archie Thurston gazed at her as though she had been
an angel visitant long-expected and desired. She made a step towards
him, and he took her hand in his.</p>

<p>"At last," he said, "after so long! I knew when I should see your
sweet face, and hear the old music that we used to play together, it
would all come back clear, and tender, and beautiful. And now I know. I
know that you are the woman I love--the woman I want to be my
wife."</p>

<p>Weeta gave a little stifled cry. It was like a moan of pain. She
shrank back, and turned imploringly to her mother, who was standing in
the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Mamma, oh, go away! There is a mistake. He thinks I am----"</p>

<p>"There can be no mistake," said Mrs. Wilson, firmly. "It is a
mother's place to stand by and guard her child at such a time as
this."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away!" again cried Weeta.</p>

<p>"It is no matter," said Thurston. "Why should we mind now?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston is right," said Mrs. Wilson. "Of course I shall remain
here, and so will Mrs. Ansdell." She put out her hand, and held my arm
tightly. "There must be a clear understanding. Mr. Thurston feels with
me. It is my duty to insist that things shall be placed upon a proper
footing. Mr. Thurston, is it true that you love my daughter, and that
you ask her to be your wife?"</p>

<p>He did not reply to Mrs. Wilson, but stood holding Weeta's hand, and
gazing at her with the utmost tenderness. "You know that is true," he
said, addressing her only. "It was settled long ago. Did I not tell you
that I loved you?"</p>

<p>She glanced at him wildly. "Yes--you did tell me--that you loved
me." Her voice faltered and dropped. "Are you sure," she cried--"sure
that it is I--I, Weeta Wilson, whom you love?"</p>

<p>"You, and you only. I love your face, I love your eyes, I love your
beautiful hair. You are the one woman in the world for me."</p>

<p>"Is that all you love in me?" she asked, with eager wistfulness.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I love your voice, I love your music, I love your
soul!"</p>

<p>A struggle seemed to be passing in Weeta's bosom. She did not answer
for a minute. I knew by the quick gasps she gave, and by the trembling
of her limbs, that she was deeply agitated. Mrs. Wilson watched her
with intense anxiety. "Weeta," she cried, "don't belie yourself for
some foolish fancy; you know that you love him. You know what you have
been brought up for--what has been always your ambition. Think of your
pride, of what people will say of us--of what they are saying already,
if he leaves you."</p>

<p>Still Weeta stood irresolute.</p>

<p>"Speak to me," he urged.</p>

<p>Their eyes met. That look decided her.</p>

<p>"Why should I hesitate?" she said defiantly, for the first time
turning to me. "Other people's happiness is no concern of mine. Why
should I not take what is offered me? It has been a fair fight."</p>

<p>"No, no," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she rejoined quickly. "He told me that he loved me, that day
by the sea. You heard him say it. It was the truth then; it is the
truth now." Her breathing was stilled, and she held herself erect, and
faced him, with her hand in his. "Since you are sure, Archie, it shall
be as you say. You have been ill; you have suffered. It was I who hurt
you. I will make up for it to you. I will nurse you, care for you, be
everything to you. We will stand together, you and I, and none shall
separate us."</p>

<p>I was thrilled by the subdued passion in her voice and manner, and
yet I had the strange feeling that I had been helping at a murder.</p>

<p>Not so Mrs. Wilson. "Now, at last, I have gained my purpose in
life," she murmured. "Let us leave them, Mrs. Ansdell."</p>

<p>It seemed a fitting moment for the curtain to drop on the scene.</p>

<h3>Chapter XX. "Do You Love Her Best?"</h3>

<p>I COULD not stay at Barradean now. The murder had been
committed--the murder of Isabel Cave's happiness. She was Alec's
friend; she was to be my guest. How should I break this news to her? I
could not divest myself of a sense of treachery. At times my heart
revolted against Weeta, when I thought of that poor girl coming across
the sea to find a faithless lover; at others it had a curious and
unreasoning sympathy for Weeta's case. I assured myself at such moments
that it was love, and not ambition, which had tempted her. As a matter
of fact it was not Weeta, but Mrs. Wilson who drove me from Barradean.
I could not stand the Major's triumphant delight at her daughter's
brilliant match. The engagement was duly announced the following day;
it was all over the country before the week was out. Mrs. Wilson would
not now hear a suggestion of any injury to Mr. Thurston's brain. In
truth, as far as his engagement was concerned, it appeared healthy
enough. He accepted the position with radiant satisfaction, appeared
devoted to Weeta, whom he contemplated adoringly, and enacted his part
of invalid lover in the most becoming fashion. Weeta was now installed
by right as attendant-in--chief, and Mr. Thurston would walk about the
garden on her arm, and even accompany her, as of old, when she played
the violin. Except for that dazed look which was still noticeable, and
for the fact that, to him, life before the accident seemed blotted out,
he was much as he always had been.</p>

<p>All this I saw only as an outsider during my occasional visits to
Barradean, for I had now no intimate companionship with Weeta. She
avoided me, and took up the attitude of having done something of which
I must necessarily disapprove, and which it was impossible to discuss.
Yet so great was the fascination she exercised over me that I could not
make up my mind to stay away altogether, and usually yielded when Mrs.
Wilson sent one of her pressing invitations to luncheon or to dinner.
Mr. Wilson himself would often come over to fetch me, and would take no
denial. He also was very happy about the engagement, never, I fancied,
having been fully enlightened as to the state of affairs, and not being
troubled with any nice scruples as to Isabel's Cave's rights. It was
quite enough for him that Thurston was in love with and had proposed
for his girl. "The other one" was not any affair of his. "The missus
was always in a good temper now," he told me; and as they had the
misfortune to have a beauty for a daughter--why, it was a comfort to
think she was taking her place in tip-top society. "She'll be Lady
Colworth, you know," he added, "and my grandchildren will be little
lords and ladies! Think of that! By Jove! if only her old grandfather
could have known that when he was knocking down his cheque at the
'Coffin Lid' public-house, it might have kept him from his coffin a bit
longer. Lord! it's enough to make the old chap turn in his grave to
think of the disgrace he has put on the British aristocracy."</p>

<p>The odd thing was that, though everyone knew of Mr. Thurston's
accession to rank, he himself was unconscious of the fact till several
weeks had elapsed. Dr. Hayllar forbade any abrupt disclosure, and
advised that matters relating to his English life should not at present
be referred to. Mrs. Wilson, I could see, was greatly relieved at this
decision. She would have liked to hurry on the marriage, and have it
over before Miss Cave's appearance, but Mr. Wilson would not listen to
this suggestion, which he called taking a mean advantage. I believe it
was made to him only, and he, in a burst of confidence, informed me of
it. I felt deeply troubled. About three weeks hence Miss Cave's steamer
would be due at Stonehampton. In my perplexity I took Dr. Hayllar into
counsel, though he was a wiry, unromantic little man, wrapped up in his
profession, from whom I could expect but little sympathy. In this case
I got none.</p>

<p>"Surely," I said, "Mr. Thurston ought to be made to understand that
the young lady he was engaged--is engaged to, as far as she knows--is
actually on her way out."</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. "What good will that do? He has
changed his mind, and is now engaged to Miss Wilson, and there is not
the smallest doubt that he is very much in love with her. The other
young lady must go to the wall."</p>

<p>"But, doctor," I urged, "think of the dishonour of it!"</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he said, "if you go bothering my patient with
questions of honour I won't answer for the consequences. His brain is
in a ticklish state still. It will come all right if he is left alone,
and allowed to be happy. These lapses of memory generally do come right
when the brain gets properly nourished again."</p>

<p>"But when he remembers everything, and knows too late what he has
done?"</p>

<p>"And what has he done? Only made certain of marrying the woman he
loves. He was madly in love with her before the accident--that was as
plain as a pikestaff; but a sense of honour, I suppose, obliged him to
hold his tongue about it. I tell you what it is, Mrs. Ansdell, honour
goes a long way in peopling lunatic asylums, and if you go wakening Mr.
Thurston's sense of honour just now, you may find that you have helped
to put him in one."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it possible," I said, "that all this time he may,
in his cloudy brain, be confusing Weeta Wilson with the girl he was
engaged to? He always thought them alike--he used to tell me so. They
have both the same kind of hair, and both play the violin. At first, I
think that was what attracted him to her."</p>

<p>The doctor fairly laughed. "That is a funny idea of yours, Mrs.
Ansdell. I am afraid it's a question of the lips which are nearest, for
it is clear which personality is uppermost in his mind now. He is about
as far gone in love with Weeta Wilson as a man can be. I don't admire
his taste. It beats me what the fellows can see to rave about in that
girl, who is half--cracked, has red hair, never speaks, and keeps her
face covered. But that's not my business; she's curing my patient,
which is all that I have got to think about. Take my advice, Mrs.
Ansdell--let things alone, and do you meet the young lady in
Stonehampton Harbour, and break the news to her as kindly as you can.
If she is a sensible young woman, she will feel that she has had a
lucky escape, and will go quietly on round the world with her
friends."</p>

<p>It seemed the only course to pursue. There was no possibility of
hearing from Alec, and I imagined that on the whole this was what he
would wish me to do. I wrote to the agents of the steamer, asking them
to telegraph to me when she was signalled a day from Stonehampton, and
resolved to take upon myself the unpleasant duty of meeting Isabel
Cave. I had a faint hope that in the meantime the fog might clear from
Mr. Thurston's memory, and allow him to face the position as a man
should.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this was brought about. Now that Mr. Thurston
was going about much as usual, it became difficult for Mrs. Wilson to
superintend the delivery of his letters. Although, except at English
mail times, she had no serious cause for anxiety, still there was
always the probability of his people telegraphing, and of the message
reaching him in the ordinary course. This, in fact, did happen. I was
present on the occasion. We were sitting in the verandah shortly before
dinner--Mrs. Wilson, Weeta, and I, and Mr. Thurston had just strolled
up to the bachelors' quarters. He and Weeta had been practising in the
drawing--room, and it was only a few minutes before that she joined us.
I was struck by the improvement in her. If Mr. Thurston appeared quite
content, she looked no less happy. Her face had gained in softness and
womanly charm, and her watchfulness of him and care for his comfort
were to me--in spite of my revolt from the whole business--curiously
interesting and pathetic. She was not at all demonstrative, taking the
whole situation in a perfectly matter-of-fact way, and I was not yet
certain whether this arose from the fear of agitating him, or because
she was, in truth, indifferent to his love. There was a feverish light
in her eyes, and sometimes a look of uneasiness on her face, which
showed that she, too, had her moments of apprehension. She turned
deadly pale now, as Mr. Thurston was seen approaching with the ominous
blue paper in his hand. He had stopped the messenger on his way to the
house, and had taken it from him. He looked pale and bewildered, and
staggered a little, as though some sudden news had shaken him.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" Mrs. Wilson ejaculated. "They have telegraphed to
him again."</p>

<p>Weeta ran down the steps to meet him.</p>

<p>"What is it, Archie?" she said.</p>

<p>He put the paper in her hand without a word, and she read it aloud:
"Received no reply to message. Colworth killed. Accident in
hunting--field. Come home. Reply at once."</p>

<p>There was a pause, in which we all waited, our eyes fixed on
him.</p>

<p>"Archie," Weeta cried, "you understand? It has not done you harm?
Oh, Archie, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," he answered, in a groping sort of way; "I know
what has happened. Colworth is my brother. He is dead; they want me at
home. What message do they mean?" he asked suddenly, turning to Mrs.
Wilson. "You have kept something from me."</p>

<p>"Archie," she answered--she, too, called him Archie now--"it was
done by Dr. Hayllar's commands. We saw about the--the accident in the
telegraphic news from England, and of course we guessed what was in the
telegram. We should not have ventured to keep back your letters except
on the doctor's authority, and it was not as if you could have done
anything. You were helpless, you were very ill, you had forgotten many
things. The shock of this terrible news might have been fatal to
you."</p>

<p>He did not seem to pay any heed to her explanations. A troubled
light broke over his face, a look of terrified comprehension, as though
some chord in his brain had been touched which for a moment startled
him into horror. "My God!" he said, "I had forgotten!" Then the horror
partly died away, and the baffled expression came back. He took the
telegraph paper from Weeta's hand and read it slowly to himself.
"Colworth dead! My poor mother! I am the only one now," he murmured
brokenly. The full realization of this present trouble seemed to come
upon him. "Colworth dead!" he repeated, and sank upon the edge of the
verandah and buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Weeta went up to him and put her hands upon his shoulders in a
gentle, protective way. "Archie, you must try not to grieve too much.
You must remember that you have others."</p>

<p>"Others!" he cried, and looked up at her wildly: the look of horror
had again come into his face. "Yes, there are others. God forgive me, I
have not thought of them. I have only looked forward, I have never
looked back."</p>

<p>He got up, and her loosened arms dropped from him. She, too,
straightened herself.</p>

<p>Involuntarily we glanced at each other, Mrs. Wilson and I--Weeta's
eyes were fixed upon her lover. The same thrill of expectation moved us
both. Had the moment of revelation come?</p>

<p>"Archie," Weeta said, almost with an agony of pleading, "there is no
need for you to make yourself wretched by looking back. You are
thinking of--of that other woman."</p>

<p>"Of that saint on earth whose shoestring I am not worthy to so much
as touch. It has all come back to me now."</p>

<p>"It had to come," she answered. "Since you are strong enough, it is
best for you to face it. I am ready to give you up--if you wish
it."</p>

<p>"Weeta!" cried Mrs. Wilson. "What are you saying? It was no
engagement. I have Mr. Thurston's own authority for that. He said it
was not an engagement."</p>

<p>"It was what--what he chooses," said Weeta. "Be silent, mamma; you
have no part in this."</p>

<p>"No part in the ruin of my own child's happiness?" melodramatically
interjected Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>"It is between him and me," Weeta went on calmly. "Archie, you have
to say what you wish--what is most for your happiness."</p>

<p>"My happiness!" he cried. "Will that atone to her for the
insult--the--oh, it is horrible!"</p>

<p>"To her or to me? Your happiness should be dearer than her own to a
woman who loves you. It is for you to decide."</p>

<p>"Ay," he said bitterly, "I know. I must decide between honour and
dishonour; no, that is done already. There must be dishonour, always.
It is too late."</p>

<p>"It is not too late," she said. "Listen! I'm a proud woman; I will
not marry you unless you love me best. If you had not told me that you
loved me before--before your illness, I would not have let you bind
yourself to me. You are free as air. Say that you love her best, and
all is over between us, and there shall be no blame to you; but tell me
that I am dearest to you, and then I will cleave to you--no one shall
take you from me. Look at me, Archie. Say, do you love her best?"</p>

<p>He did look at her, devouring her, it seemed, with his eyes. She
looked perfectly beautiful as she stood facing him, her head a little
thrown back, her eyes glowing upon his, the odd fascination she
possessed intensified tenfold. I think there must have been something
magnetic about her which made him powerless to resist her.</p>

<p>"Speak," she said imperiously; "I tell you that you are free. You
have only to let your own heart decide. Choose between us. Take the one
who is dearest to you. Say that you love her best."</p>

<p>He caught her hands. "I cannot say it; it is not true. You have
bewitched me. You are my heart--my life. If it is to be dishonour, it
shall be dishonour with you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson drew a deep breath of relief. I had been sorry for her
in a grotesque, contemptuous way; but I could not keep silence any
longer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston," I said, "you must face the position fairly. Do you
not know that Isabel Cave, who believes herself your promised wife, is
on board the Urania, and will be at Stonehampton in a very few days? Do
you not know that she has come out expecting to be married to you? How
are you goin to meet her?"</p>

<p>"I cannot meet her; I dare not meet her," he said, helplessly.</p>

<p>"You will meet her," said Weeta, facing me. "You will tell her what
you have heard from his own lips."</p>

<p>"You give me a pleasant task," I said; "though truly Mr. Thurston's
way of facing this difficulty should make it easy for a woman to
despise him."</p>

<p>"I am a coward and a traitor," he broke in. "Yes, I know it. You
can't think too hardly of me; but I--I am not myself. I haven't the
power to face things like a man."</p>

<p>"Do you not see," Weeta flamed round fiercely at me, "you are doing
him harm? He is ill. He is not fit for this."</p>

<p>"And yet," I replied, "you have put on him the strain of a life's
choice between honour and dishonour."</p>

<p>"Oh, honour! That is false reasoning--all conventional cant! Isn't
it the worst dishonour to marry one woman, caring more for another? He
has only to act as his heart orders. That is what I take my stand
upon--his love. If he had said that he loved her best, you might have
taken him with you to Stonehampton. I would have stood aside. But as it
is, Archie, I will be strong for you and for myself. Come, you want
rest."</p>

<p>She put her arm within his, and led him away to a little verandah
room, which the lovers had appropriated as a sitting-room. They did not
again appear. It was a very uncomfortable evening. Mrs. Wilson was
resentful of what she called my interference, and made no scruple in
telling me what she thought of my conduct. I felt hurt and wretched,
and begged Mr. Wilson, who was to drive me home to order the buggy
round as soon as dinner was over.</p>

<p>He had drunk just enough to make him ramble on confidentially.
"You'll have to knock under to the Missus, Mrs. Ansdell, like the rest
of us; and though I feel for you--upon my word, now, I do feel for
you--the other young woman being a friend of your husband's, makes it
deucedly unpleasant for you--I wouldn't be in your shoes, going to meet
her, for something; still, I mean to stand by the Missus and her
opinions; and you couldn't expect me to throw over the chance of making
my girl 'My Lady.' The other young woman ought to be able to look after
herself. She had first go in at him, and why didn't she stick to him
and keep him from making a fool of himself and other people? Let the
best man win, say I, or the best woman; it comes to the same thing.
Queer, isn't it, to see two women quarrelling over one man--three, if
you throw the Missus in? To my thinking, Thurston ain't worth it. I
like a fellow that knows his own mind. Although he's a lord, I'd just
as soon it had been Humphreys. Poor Humphreys! he's awfully cut up. He
thought he had a chance. If Thurston chucks her up, he's ready to marry
Weeta any day, and say, thank you, on his knees. And Mount Jessop is
turning up trumps. He's safe to be a millionaire, is Humphreys, and he
has offered to put me in for a good spec. I tell you what it is, Mrs.
Ansdell, if you bring the other young woman up here, and help her to
fight it out, and she gets the best of it--why, I'm not so sure that
you'll make an enemy of me. Remember that."</p>

<p>When, two days later, I got a telegram from the agents to the effect
that the Urania was expected in Stonehampton Bay two days later, I
wrote at once to Weeta the following note:--</p>

<p>"MY DEAR WEETA,--I think it right to tell you that I am going to
Stonehampton to-morrow, to meet Miss Cave. I think, too, that Mr.
Thurston ought to be made aware of this, and that you should both
understand that I mean to tell Miss Cave everything that I know of the
circumstances of your engagement to him. Of course, it is impossible
for me to say what she will do; but, if she should choose to stay here,
she will be my guest. Please don't think I have no sympathy with you.
Though I can't approve of what you are doing, I wish sincerely that I
could help you.</p>

<p>"Yours affectionately.</p>

<p>"RACHEL ANSDELL."</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Weeta answered the note in person. She came
alone into the sitting-room, having ridden over with one of the younger
children.</p>

<p>"Do you know what has brought me?" she asked, as she threw up her
veil and sat down. "It was the last sentence in your letter. The first
part only made me harder, but the last showed that you had some kindly
feeling for me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, that is true, Weeta," I said. I was deeply touched by the
manner and expression of the girl. She looked intensely wretched. "I
wish I could understand you," I added impulsively.</p>

<p>"It is not likely that you could do that. I don't understand myself.
But perhaps if you knew exactly how I have been brought up and all that
I have felt and suffered, you would not be hard on me now."</p>

<p>"I am not hard on you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are. You have said that you disapproved of my conduct. It
seems to you shameless and unwomanly. Your letter is, in fact, a
declaration of war. You have gone over to the enemy--I suppose I am
justified in calling Miss Cave my enemy," she went on, with a harsh
little laugh. "She has everything that I have not got. She has been
brought up among the surroundings which I covet. She is rich, and her
own mistress. The only point in which we are equal is that we both want
intensely the same valuable property--Archie Thurston."</p>

<p>"How do you know that she will want him when she hears the truth?
She will probably have too much pride to go on caring about a man who
no longer cares for her."</p>

<p>"I don't know in the least," answered Weeta, calmly. "If you ask my
candid opinion, I should say that it would be very easy for her to
regain her influence over Archie Thurston. His love for me is only a
passing madness."</p>

<p>"And yet you can hold him to you?"</p>

<p>"It is a very real madness when I am with him, and if I were to
marry him, it would most likely always last; but I am quite sure that
if I were out of his way, he would discover that he had never really
cared for me. You are surprised that I can talk about it so coolly. I
think you have been under the impression that it was I who was madly in
love with him. I assure you I never encouraged him. He made advances to
me."</p>

<p>"You meant to try and win him," I said. "You admitted as much to
Alec and me, and the excuse I made for you then was that you cared for
him."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "some day, perhaps, you will know whether you were
right in your conjecture."</p>

<p>"No," I said angrily. "I can't even give you that claim to
respect."</p>

<p>She gave me one of her long, curious looks. "Ah!" she said again,
with a little deep-drawn sigh. "Well, I didn't expect you would respect
me. I don't respect myself. But I have judged Archie correctly," she
went on. "I have had to think the matter out in order to calculate my
chances--if you take that view of it, and I can't blame you, seeing
that out of my own mouth I have condemned myself. His temperament was
the important factor in the business. He is not a man whom you can
admire all round, and I must say that just now he cuts a rather
unheroic figure."</p>

<p>I think she took a sort of perverse pleasure in puzzling and
annoying me.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should have come over to tell me this," I
said.</p>

<p>"I did not," she answered. "I came over to tell you that Archie has
written to Miss Cave. I haven't seen the letter. I didn't dictate it.
At any rate, it relieves you from a disagreeable responsibility. He has
sent it to the care of the pilot, so that she will probably receive it
before you see her."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I replied. "That, at least, was considerate of Mr.
Thurston."</p>

<p>"I came over to tell you something else," she went on. "It is that I
value your good wishes, and that I am sorry you have turned against me.
I want to try and make you see a little from my point of view, even
though it be ever so dimly. Think how lonely I have been all my life--a
sensitive child; nobody guessed how sensitive--the butt of the family,
because of my odd ways, and because they thought I was ugly. I had no
love of any kind. My mother never cared for me. She was always
punishing me for some trivial fault. I used to yearn for love, even
that I might feel it for my mother; but I could feel nothing but fear.
You can't imagine how imperious she is, and how her will carries
everything before it. Even now, when I pretend to be mos indifferent, I
am in reality cowed by her. Then my father's manners and habits jarred
upon me. He used to laugh at me, and call me 'Carrots,' and it was his
joke, I told you, that I had a shingle 'loose.' None of them understood
me, none of them cared for me. They treat me differently now because
they have been told that I am good-looking, though they cannot
understand that either. And they see that men fall in love with me, and
they have set their hearts on my making a fine marriage. That was
always my mother's craze. It is a kind of mania. I dare say I have
inherited it. I have never allowed myself to be in love with any of
those Australian men who have wanted to marry me. I knew that was not
my destiny. I have always fancied that I had a destiny. I am horribly
romantic, though I seem stupid. I delight in imagining myself into
dramatic positions. When I am sitting silent I am thinking them out. I
should talk if there was anything worth talking about. I have an idea
that if I were among clever, cultivated people, I should be clever too,
and talk brilliantly. I suppose all this seems to you very conceited
and ridiculous, but it's how I feel. I long, at times, with the longing
of an imprisoned soul, to escape from this mean, narrow life, from the
talk about cattle, and the rough, commonplace bush people. I am very
ambitious--I want power. Now, do you see? Mr. Thurston can give me all
this. He can put me into the position for which I fancy that I am
fitted. He is the only person that I have ever known who has shown me
what life might really be. He represents a different order of things.
He can make me a great lady, one of those of whom one reads in books.
And he loves me. You heard him say so. You heard him say it when he had
his full senses, and knew as well as you and I that he was bound to
Miss Cave. He threw her off that day. He was false to her when he told
me by the shore that he loved me. Is it in human nature that I should
not take advantage of such an opportunity? I told you I meant it to be
a fair fight. I have left it to himself. You heard me offer to free
him. He has chosen me deliberately. Well, why should I concern myself
about that other girl? Why should I give him up out of Quixotic
generosity to a woman who is less than nothing to me?"</p>

<p>She poured all this out with rapid, low-toned utterance.</p>

<p>"You have not pleaded the one thing which would make me give you my
heart's sympathy," I said.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You have never said that you love him. Everything you have put
forth would only lead one to believe that your motives were selfish and
worldly."</p>

<p>"If you are not clever enough to find out for yourself whether or
not I love him, I shall not tell you," she answered slowly. "You must
think what you please." She got up. "I have said all that I had to say,
and now I will go."</p>

<p>I stopped her. "Stay. Is there no way of escaping from this life
which you dislike, and gaining the things you want, without marrying
Mr. Thurston?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "I might marry Mr. Humphreys. He will be far richer
than Archie Thurston, though he cannot give me rank. He would take me
to England or anywhere that I liked, and they say that money will do
anything in society. I am not sure that this would not be the best way
out of the fix."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you take it? If some one is to be sacrificed, by all
means let it be Mr. Humphreys."</p>

<p>"Now, you are not fair to him. As far as solid, manly goodness goes,
he is worth a dozen of Archie. Why should he be sacrificed? It is not
his fault that outwardly he is not attractive."</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say," I exclaimed, exas perated.</p>

<p>"Well!--nor I. Good-bye, Mrs. Ansdell. Heaven save you in your
mission!" And she went away.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXI. Isabel Cave.</h3>

<p>IT was with a sinking heart that I went down the river in the
steam-tug which was to bring off the passengers and mails from the
Urania. I comforted myself, however, with the reflection that the time
of trial would not last long, for that of a certainty, on receiving Mr.
Thurston's letter, Miss Cave would decide to go on to Sydney with her
travelling companions.</p>

<p>But I was mistaken. When I got on board the Urania, a very pretty
little lady, dressed in a smart white serge yachting dress and
coquettish sailor hat, came straight to me.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansdell, I feel sure it's you; Isabel asked me to look out for
you. I'm Mrs. Bingham, her friend, and I want to speak to you before
you see her. She has had a letter by the pilot this morning, and I feel
certain that it is from Mr. Thurston, and that it has bad news."</p>

<p>I saw at once that Miss Cave had not communicated the fact of Mr.
Thurston's faithlessness to her friend, and that I must be guarded in
what I said.</p>

<p>"She is in her cabin," pursued Mrs. Bingham; "I've hardly seen her
since she got Mr. Thurston's letter--I suppose I ought to say Lord
Colworth. They telegraphed the news to us at Singapore. What is the
matter? Why isn't he here?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston has had a bad accident; he was thrown from his horse,
and for a time his mind was affected," I answered.</p>

<p>"Is that all? I was afraid it was something much more serious. For,
of course, he is all right now, or he could not have written."</p>

<p>"He is much better; he is able to walk about."</p>

<p>"But not up to meeting his lady-love. I must say I thought him an
odd sort of lover when she told me she was not expecting him. I can't
help thinking it's something more than that, Mrs. Ansdell. Isabel
looked as if she had had a great shock."</p>

<p>"I suppose that she will tell you if there is anything more," I
replied, constrainedly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bingham did not look quite satisfied; but clearly she was not a
person who worried herself about troubles that did not concern her. I
turned the subject by explaining Alec's absence, and his sister's
request that I would receive Isabel Cave.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Bingham. "Frankly, it was a great relief to me when
Mima Ansdell--of course you know that we live close to your husband's
people--when Mima promised in your name that you would act matron to
Isabel. For, you see, my husband's time is limited, and we don't want
to waste it at Stonehampton, where they tell me there is absolutely
nothing to see this time of year but mosquitoes. Since you will take
charge of Isabel, we propose to go on to Sydney, where she can join us
after a bit if she likes; but I don't suppose the young man will agree
to that."</p>

<p>"Then she means to come back with me?" I exclaimed in some surprise;
but, perceiving Mrs. Bingham's questioning look, hastened to add, "Of
course I am only too delighted, and have come here to get her to stay
with me; but I did not know if Mr. Thurston's letter----" and I stopped
uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't imagine he has thrown her over," laughed Mrs.
Bingham; "and, short of that, she is bound to go to him. Dear old
Isabel! She is just the sweetest girl in the world, and, though I am
dreadfully sorry to lose her, of course her heart is with Mr. Thurston,
and I do so want her to be happy. She asked me to take you down to her
cabin when you came. My husband is seeing after her boxes and
things."</p>

<p>We went together to the saloon, and Mrs. Bingham knocked at the door
of one of the staterooms. A voice said, "Come in."</p>

<p>"It's Mrs. Ansdell," said Mrs. Bingham, "and I shall leave you to
make acquaintance, and go and find out when the steam-tug starts back."
She motioned me to enter, and with a little nod ran away again.</p>

<p>A very tall, slender girl, with hair something the colour of
Weeta's, was standing before me. She took my two hands in hers. "It was
kind of you to come," she said agitatedly. "I wanted to see you first
alone. Will you sit here?" She put me beside her on the cushioned berth
beneath the porthole, and I was able to look at her.</p>

<p>Yes, she was a little like Weeta. The colouring and the "Rossetti"
look were the same, only that Miss Cave's skin was much less clear,
being freckled here and there, as the complexion which goes with such
hair is apt to be; and she was, in truth, far less beautiful than
Weeta. She lacked Weeta's distinctive originality and perplexing charm.
Perhaps her dress had something to do with this, and gave her the
conventional air, of which the total absence was Weeta's peculiarity.
She wore a tight-fitting tailor-made gown, very neat, but not the least
"aesthetic," as it is phrased; her hair was parted in the middle, and
braided as smoothly as its natural ripple would allow. She was just
like many a charming and well--bred girl from an English country-house;
with all this, she was extremely pretty, and most refined and
delicate-looking. She gave me the impression of being deeply moved. The
tears welled in her eyes when she put aside, as it were, some poor
little commonplaces of greeting with which I tried to cover my own
sense of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansdell," she said, "I am not going to treat you as a
stranger, for I have read what Alec has written about you to his
sisters, and I know that you will be kind and true to me. I want you to
be true above all things--nothing else matters."</p>

<p>I begged her to believe that she might trust me, and that I would
act towards her as if she were Alec's sister.</p>

<p>"That's good of you," she answered. "I know Alec Ansdell, and what
he has been to his sisters, and I know he would be a brother to me if
he were here now. You know all about that letter--yes, for he told me
that you understood everything."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," I exclaimed; "but at least I have seen most
of what has happened."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me it all, then, exactly? This has been a blow to me,
for I----" her voice faltered, "I have loved Archie Thurston dearly.
But his letter is unlike him, so strange, and wild, and incoherent. He
speaks of an accident. I feel that there must be some explanation he
has not given me. Will you tell me about--about this girl for whom he
has forsaken me? Is she a good girl? Is she a lady? Forgive me; but I
don't understand much about Australian people. Does she love him? How
is it that she has taken my place? Will you tell me the whole truth,
the very truth? Don't be afraid of hurting me."</p>

<p>I did tell her the whole truth, as far as I knew it. I felt that it
was my duty to gloss over nothing, and yet, as I described the scenes I
had witnessed, it was with a sense of shame and compunction, and of
treachery towards Weeta, as I had before felt a sense of treachery to
Isabel Cave. She asked me many questions about Weeta, among them that
one which I could not answer, whether Weeta loved Archie Thurston.</p>

<p>"I think I understand better now," she said, when I had finished,
"Oh, my poor Archie, my poor Archie!" She put her hands over her face
for a minute; then went on hurriedly, at first without any show of
emotion: "It was too hard a trial for any man, and Archie is weak; I
always knew that, but it made no difference in my feeling for him.
Weakness sometimes only makes the person one loves dearer. She is very
beautiful, and her playing--he is so fond of music, it rouses all that
is emotional in him. Yes, I understand, I understand. I don't blame
him, and his brain was confused, and he was not able in his mental and
bodily weakness to cope with a feeling of that kind. That is what
troubles me so. Suppose he were under the influence of a sort of
delusion."</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said helplessly; "I'm afraid he cared for her
before."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she interrupted; "you told me. I am glad you did not
spare me that. If she were a good girl and loved him for himself, and
he really loved her--if I were sure of that, I would go on now, and he
should not be troubled with me any more. But if she is heartless and
worldly, and it is only ambition--his position is changed, you know,
and you yourself say that she has been brought up badly, and her mother
is a designing woman--oh, he should be saved from that. His mother and
father should be saved that trial; it would hurt them grievously. You
know once they objected to me because I am not so well born; but that
is all passed now, and I should have come to Archie with his mother's
blessing. How sad it is now--now when it is too late!" Again she nearly
broke down. "Think what it would be to Lady Belmont to have a
daughter-in-law who was unworthy! And poor Archie! when the glamour was
past! Mrs. Ansdell," she said appealingly, and looking at me with her
frank, sincere eyes, "tell me if you think me wanting in dignity and
self-respect--tell me frankly. But I feel that I must see Archie and
judge for myself. I feel that it would be a false kind of pride that
would turn me away and let me be carried for ever out of his life. If I
could save him! It is worth a sacrifice. Not for myself, but for his
mother's sake--for his own sake and for the sake of the love we had for
each other. Something is owing surely to a love which was strong enough
to bring me here--strong enough to live through opposition and absence
and long silence for nearly five years. Tell me that you do not think
me contemptible and unwomanly."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't," I interposed abruptly, for I began to find myself
quite carried away by the girl's frank impetuosity. "I don't think it
unwomanly of any woman not to give up her love and her happiness and
her life, and perhaps the happiness and the life of the man she loves,
without making a fair fight for it."</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled. "You, too, think I ought to see him? You, too,
think I have a right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I am sure you have," I answered. Something of hope within
me began for the first time to tremble and respond to her appeal.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, and there seemed a positive passion of
conviction in her look and her tone; "you said yourself that you
couldn't understand this thing. Well, I can't understand it, either;
but we may believe without understanding, and this I do believe--that,
however all this horrible confusion has come about, Archie is true to
me, and that the sight of my face, and the sound of my voice, and the
touch of my hand will bring my lover back to me."</p>

<p>She smiled a fearless, flashing smile, like that of one determined
to go in for a last ordeal. All the same, there were tears in her eyes,
and, indeed, there were tears in my eyes as well. Odd memories came up
in my mind of stories I had read about sorceries and bewitched young
men, and redemptions by the pure, courageous faith of pure and
conquering love.</p>

<p>"Go to him," I said. "God show the right."</p>

<p>So I told Mrs. Bingham that I would take charge of Miss Cave, and
that she might go her way to Sydney without further sense of
responsibility.</p>

<p>I wish I could have said to myself that I had no further sense of
responsibility, but I did not feel by any means so well assured as to
the wisdom of the step I was allowing poor Miss Cave to take. If it
should prove a disappointment, what a humiliating disappointment it
would be! The poor, forlorn girl would only have published her love and
her desertion in vain; and I was by no means sure that Miss Weeta would
not be quite capable of openly exulting in her rival's defeat and
humiliation--it is not only women who are capable of doing such
things--they have learned the way to do them from at least as far back
as the days when the god-like heroes of the Iliad jibed over and
exulted over and insulted their wounded and dying enemies. It would be
hardly fair to expect more magnanimity from Miss Weeta than from one of
Homer's heroes. After all, Weeta was certainly not a sorceress, and
Archie appeared to know what he was talking about when he allowed us
all to believe that he loved Weeta best of all girls in the world.
Still, it was idle to think of all that now. I had given my word to
Isabel that she should have her chance of redeeming her spell-bound
lover--if he were spell-bound--and so far as I was concerned she should
have her chance. But I could not help wondering what people would say
of me; perhaps especially what Alec would say of me when he came to
know all about it. That married woman must indeed be a very heroine of
self-assurance whose spirit never sinks at the thought that something
she has done, which at the time she thought highly magnanimous, may
cause her husband to think her, and perhaps even to call her, a
fool.</p>

<p>We spent that night at one of the hotels in Stonehampton, and went
on our journey next day. I had certainly great reason to admire the
self--control and strength of mind displayed by my poor Isabel. I could
read between the lines of her talk without the least trouble. She had
made up her mind evidently that she was not to display her anxiety all
over the place; that she would not impose any of her burden
unnecessarily upon others, upon any other. She asked me all sorts of
questions about Australia and its ways, and about the local society, of
which she was about to have a passing glimpse; and she said never a
word about the people or the subject which, as I knew full well, must
be eating into her heart. Sometimes I asked myself to what use this
heroic suppression, this almost suicidal trampling down of the
feelings? Why not trust me, woman to woman, and let herself go, and let
me share her anguish of anxiety in open words, as she must well know
that I already share it in feeling and in sympathy? Why should heroism
play the part of hypocrisy and hide its real features behind a mask?
All the same I respected her resolve and her proud patience.</p>

<p>As we were getting near the end of our journey. I thought it well to
bring her back in open speech to its very anxious and, to my mind,
dismal purpose, and I took her hand in mine. It is, I suppose, a law of
our being that compassion must touch with its living hand the object of
its sympathy. I said, "My dear Miss Cave, suppose this fails; shall you
be able to go through with it?"</p>

<p>"What can I do?" she asked simply, opening her eyes and then letting
fall the curtain of her lids again. "It is no more than happens to many
girls who deserve a better fate than I do. And then, Mrs. Ansdell, I
don't believe that any harm will come, for I believe in him."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear child," I exclaimed, almost losing all self-control,
"the other girl believes in him, too; one or other of you must
suffer."</p>

<p>"If she loves him really, truly, for himself, as I do; and if she
has to give him up--oh, I shall be so sorry for her that I shall take
her to my very heart, and cry tears of sympathy over her. I shan't
exult, I promise you. Mrs. Ansdell, if she really loves him fondly--in
that true sort of way, you know; and if she has won him really--well, I
shall say good--bye, and go my way without one word of reproach, and I
shall feel some better hope for his happiness than I did when first I
heard of this strange thing. But then--then--then--I shall feel
sorry--for her!"</p>

<p>"For her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, for her! What hold could any woman have on a heart that
could be given and taken away, and given away again like that? He did
love me, as surely as I loved him; and, if he has changed so soon for
any cause--why, then, so much the worse for the girl he takes, and not
for the girl he leaves."</p>

<p>There was a resolute toss of her prettily-set head as she spoke
these words, but I could see that her lips trembled all the while.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are so brave, my dear," I said.</p>

<p>"Brave!" she answered, and she now let her tears have their way. "I
don't believe I am a bit brave. I am only confident. I know he loves
me."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXII. The Old Love and the New.</h3>

<p>ISABEL preserved her heroic attitude, even when we had reached
Wombo, and she found herself in the very scenes and surroundings amid
which the tragedy of Archie Thurston's desertion had been played. She
bade me show her the spur of shingle where he had been thrown from his
horse, and shuddered as she looked out to sea, and saw the waves
breaking over the bristling rocks. She asked me if Barradean were
visible from the knoll where we were standing, and gazed for several
minutes with melancholy interest on the pretty low house with its wide
verandahs, its romantic garden, and clustering outbuildings, all
embowered in bamboos. The place had great natural beauty, and showed to
advantage from this point.</p>

<p>"I did not think it was like that," she said, with a little catching
of her breath. "It is something like a villa that I know in Italy."</p>

<p>I could see that this association of her rival with picturesqueness
and luxuriance of vegetation, and, indeed, an almost tropical charm,
produced an uneasy feeling in her mind, and made her more distrustful
of her own influence.</p>

<p>As upon the occasion of my own home-coming, we left the coach to
proceed by the longer road, and waded across the inlet, it being, on
the whole, the most private way in which Isabel could make her entry
into the township. I had, for her sake, a nervous dread of the gossip
which would certainly fly round the district, if it got to be known who
she was, and why she had come. I hated the idea of the false position
in which she might find herself, and wished, more than ever, for Alec's
strong support. I began even to doubt the wisdom of the course we had
pursued. In any case, the only hope was to keep her arrival as quiet as
possible, and when the momentous interview was over, to take her back
to Stonehampton, and consign her to the Binghams' care in Sydney.</p>

<p>I was a little afraid that we might meet some of the Barradean party
on the beach or riding down the hill on which our cottage stood. I felt
sure that the Major was quite capable of bearing down on Isabel, and
trying to intimidate her into retreat from the field. But this time
none of the Wilsons appeared, and Isabel reached the shelter of our
cottage undetected. Once in her own room, I thought she would have
given way, but she was brave still, and when she came out to dinner
seemed interested in the new life to which she had been introduced,
asked many questions about Alec and our personal concerns, found a
likeness to her grandmother in baby, and told me a great deal about
Alec's people, and their ways and doings. She was determined,
apparently--for the moment, at any rate--to put aside her own griefs
and anxieties.</p>

<p>The next morning I had my pony harnessed, and set out for Barradean.
I had hope that I might get speech of Weeta or Mr. Thurston without Mr.
Wilson's intervention, and so, instead of driving up to the usual
entrance, I gave the cart in charge of a blackboy who was lounging
about the slip--rails, and made my way to the granadilla trellis, where
the lovers often spont their early morning hours. Weeta had grown so
careless of her complexion during these days of her engagement that I
wondered sometimes whether that care had not also been affectation, or
whether she was going through such exciting phases of emotion that her
former vanities had ceased to have any hold over her.</p>

<p>Her face was unveiled now, though it was shaded by a broad straw
hat, curiously trimmed with the grey-green moss which hangs from the
gum trees, and of which a long trail fell over the brim and mingled
with her red-gold locks. She wore her hair brushed back, and tied with
a piece of yellow ribbon, so that it hung in a rippling mass far below
her shoulders, and she had on a simple white gown of the clinging stuff
she liked, falling straight to her feet, and gathered in at the waist
with a broad yellow sash. I thought I had never seen a more striking
figure, as she stood leaning against the wall of greenery, her eyes
bent down upon her lover, who half lay in a squatter's chair looking up
ardently at her. Yet in the faces of both there was a troubled
expression, a sort of restless, dissatisfied passion, as though
elements in the natures of both were warring, and only held in check by
the fascination that bound each to the other. This was my fancy. They
were not doing anything, though a book lay on the ground beside them;
but there was nothing in their attitude which suggested the idle repose
of a lovers' tete-&agrave;-tete. Weeta was the first to perceive my
approach. She knew that I had been to Stonehampton since our last
meeting, and what had been my errand there, yet she greeted me as
unconcernedly as though I had driven over merely to while away a dull
morning. Her moods certainly were quite incalculable.</p>

<p>"Here is Mrs. Ansdell, Archie," she said.</p>

<p>I saw instantly that a change came over his face. He rose and said,
"How do you do?" to me with as much awkwardness as was possible in one
so habitually at his ease.</p>

<p>I, too, felt awkward enough. "I have come to tell you," I began
bluntly, "that I have brought Miss Cave home with me to Wombo."</p>

<p>The announcement startled Weeta. "Ah!" she exclaimed nervously; then
seemed to make a resolute effort to force down her agitation. She moved
a little farther off, folded her hands before her, and waited perfectly
silent. The news affected Mr. Thurston deeply. He turned very pale, and
for a moment or two did not speak. I felt, though I was not looking at
her, that Weeta's eyes were fixed steadily upon him.</p>

<p>"She has come?" he said at last, in a shocked, groping way.</p>

<p>"She has come to see you," I answered, boldly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed passionately; "this is worse than everything. I
can bear to know myself a cur; I can't bear that she should upbraid me
for my baseness."</p>

<p>"She will not upbraid you," I said; "she has no thought of reproach.
She----"</p>

<p>"Stay!" interrupted Weeta, imperiously. "I will go away if you wish
it. Do you want to speak to Mr. Thurston alone?"</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed; "that can make no difference."</p>

<p>"There is no need," I said. "I have not much to say, and perhaps you
had better hear it."</p>

<p>"Very well." She sat down on a bench, her hands lying still in her
lap, maintaining an air of armed neutrality.</p>

<p>"Miss Cave only wished to hear the truth from your own lips," I went
on. "She thinks this is due to you and to herself, and to the love you
once had for one another. She thinks it due also to your parents."</p>

<p>"Oh, my parents!" he burst out impetuously. "What have they to do
with it? If they had sided with me at the beginning, and had welcomed
Isabel, and fought with me against her guardian, it would all have been
different. I might never have----" He stopped himself with a sudden
eager look at Weeta. "What am I saying? It is the wrong to her that
hurts me, and that I would undo almost with my life, if I could. It
would be a wrong to her, even if----How could I pretend? When once a
thing is done, it is done for ever. We were talking of that now--before
you came. We were reading Browning, you know," and he quoted--</p>

<p>"As earth lies bare to heaven above;</p>

<p>How is it under our control</p>

<p>To love or not to love?"</p>

<p>"That's the way with me. But it is not for my people to
interfere--now. They have learned to appreciate Isabel too late."</p>

<p>"No, Archie," Weeta said calmly; "I have told you it is not too
late. Miss Cave herself thinks it is not too late, or she would not
come she would not have asked you to go to her. It is to be a struggle
between us two women for you, my poor Archie; and in good truth I don't
know which of the three is the most humiliated by the struggle. You
see," she added, looking towards me, "it was scarcely fair of you to
blame me, and to hint that I was indelicate for taking up the line I
did. If I was indelicate in refusing to give him up unless he himself
told me that he did not love me, then how would you describe Miss
Cave's conduct? I am not saying anything against it, mind. It's what I
would have done myself, and I admire her and respect her for being
above your petty standard of conventionality."</p>

<p>It jarred upon me inexpressibly to hear her thus applauding poor
Isabel. I wondered how he could bear it, and that the bad taste of her
speech did not annoy him; but apparently he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston," I said, not answering her, "will you come with me
now to see Miss Cave?"</p>

<p>He seemed to reflect for a moment. "Yes," he answered slowly, and
with a greater show of manliness than he had as yet appeared capable
of; "since she asks it of me. God knows I have done her harm enough,
and the least I can do now is to obey her wishes."</p>

<p>"You must understand that it is with no thought of influencing you
that Miss Cave is here," I said, anxious to guard Isabel against any
imputation of want of self-respect. "She has come in the noblest,
frankest way, putting all care for herself aside. You must not think
that she could stoop----"</p>

<p>"I could think nothing of her but what is highest and most
honourable. You need not tell me what Isabel Cave's motives are," he
said, with fervid impressiveness. "Don't I know that she is the
proudest woman--proud in the noblest sense--as well as the truest and
sweetest? Whatever she does must be right, and no one would ever dare
to misinterpret it. I will come, Mrs. Ansdell."</p>

<p>Weeta moved when he did, and walked before us to the end of the
trellis. "You have a place to spare in your pony cart," she said. "I
should like to come, too."</p>

<p>"You are coming!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes; why not? You won't be so inhospitable as to forbid me your
house, Mrs. Ansdell? It's like waiting for my death-warrant, you know.
Think of my suspense while those two decide upon my sentence."</p>

<p>"Weeta, you pain me!" he exclaimed, with indignant reproach.</p>

<p>"I'm only putting facts in a straight way, Archie; and it seems to
me that we have got down to the bed-rock, as they say. Why should we be
afraid of standing face to face--you and she and I? I shall not wrangle
and scratch and try to tear out her eyes. I am not quite indelicate
enough for that. In heaven's name, let us be honest, all of us, and say
what we feel; let us fight in the open, now that it has come to a
battle." She laughed in her odd, soft way. "Besides, it is really a
dramatic situation, and that's what I've always longed for. And
besides, again, how do you know that I may not have something to
say--some decision of my own to announce which will change the whole
state of affairs?"</p>

<p>I did not try to dissuade her from her plan. Indeed, I had a faint
hope that she might, as she said, say or do something which would
entirely alter the position. We drove almost in silence to the
cottage.</p>

<p>I took them into the dining-room, which was separated from the
parlour by folding-doors and a heavy curtain. I knew that Isabel would
be either in the parlour or the front verandah.</p>

<p>"Will you stay here while I tell Miss Cave?" I said, and left
them.</p>

<p>I was not long absent. When I came back, I saw a strange sight--a
sight that set all my sympathies vibrating again for Weeta, and gave me
the feeling of being torn in two. Archie was seated at the table, his
elbows resting upon it, his hand supporting his head, and he was
looking down at Weeta with something of agony in his eyes. She was
kneeling beside him, her hand clutching his arm, her face upturned to
his, transfigured in its passion of yearning.</p>

<p>"Archie," I heard her say, and no words can convey the tender
cadence of her voice. Oh, she loved him! I was certain of that now.
"Archie, my darling, if you leave me you will take my heart's blood
with you. Archie, listen. It would kill me if you were sorry afterwards
and made me feel so--if you were ashamed of me, or of my people; if I
lost my hold on you, and you looked back to this day with hatred of me.
Oh, Archie, let me suffer now, rather than that. Go, my darling, if you
have one shadow of regret, if you have one heart-throb that is for her,
and not for me."</p>

<p>He caught her to him and kissed her wildly. "I can't give you up. No
one can ask that--she least of all. Oh, my love! my love!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again. Weeta broke from him, and pointed to where I
stood.</p>

<p>"They have come for you," she cried, hysterically. "It is the
executioner. Go, Archie, and remember."</p>

<p>"Miss Cave would like to see you alone," I said, coming forward to
him. "She is in the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Go, Archie," Weeta repeated. Her glamour seemed upon him at that
moment more irresistibly than ever before. His eyes were scarcely able
to tear themselves away from her face as he left the room, and while
she bade him go her whole look and attitude gave the impression of some
uncanny syren who was exercising all her power of fascination to keep
him her slave. I wondered then that these two women, who were both so
strong, should care so much for one so weak.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind him Weeta sank into the chair from
which he had risen, and leaning her arms on the table, buried her face
in her hands. She had taken off her hat, and her beautiful hair covered
her form, which was shaken with sobs. I went to her and tried to show
her that I felt for her sorrow.</p>

<p>"Go away, Rachel Ansdell," she exclaimed hoarsely. "It's you who
have done this--you who have brought that girl here. What right had
you? What business was it of yours? Why could you not let things
be?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are afraid then?" I said, uttering the thought which was
uppermost.</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked at me, her eyes shining brightly
through her tears, such force and vitality in her bearing that I could
not but compare her with the woman I had left and tell myself that it
would go hard with Isabel. It was too much to expect that any man would
give Weeta up willingly.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" she repeated angrily. "No, I am not afraid--not of what
you think. Do you suppose I don't know my power over him? Do you think
I don't know that by looking at him I can make it impossible for him to
throw me over? I won't give you the satisfaction of thinking that I do
it out of love." She seemed to take a perverse pride in upsetting my
theories. "You haven't any idea what a good actress I am. I tell you he
shall belong to me, though he doesn't love me--not in his heart of
heart. Oh, I know that. He is only bewitched, mesmerised, anything you
like to call it. But he is mine for all that, and no one shall take him
from me."</p>

<p>She had got up from her chair, and was pacing the room like a mad
creature. I did not try to reason with her, but stood waiting. The low
murmur of voices from the drawing-room reached me, and must have
reached Weeta also. It seemed to still her rage. She paused in her
walk, which resembled that of a beast in its cage, and, putting herself
into the motionless attitude she could assume even when feeling
threatened to overmaster her, waited, as I did, till the interview
between Archie and Isabel was over. I don't think either of us could
have told afterwards how long we stood in our suspense. It might have
been minutes; it might almost have been hours. In reality I believe it
was only a very little while. Suddenly the tension was broken. The
handle of the door turned. There was a moment's pause, and then, to my
great surprise, Isabel entered, followed by Mr. Thurston.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment uncertainly, her eyes fixed upon her rival.
She was very pale; but, in her appearance and demeanour, there was a
certain simple and delicate propriety which contrasted with Weeta's
fantastic dress and disordered hair, and with the evident signs of that
storm of passion which had gone over her. Isabel seemed, in her brief
glance, to be weighing the nature and claims of her antagonist. She
gazed at her searchingly, with wistful wonder and admiration. Weeta
stood erect, resentful but defiant; but, above all, surprisingly
beautiful. At last Isabel crossed to her, and said simply, "I wanted to
see you; I wanted to tell you that I hope you may be happy."</p>

<p>Weeta gave her a full glance, bright and unrelenting. "Why do you
wish that?" And then she added, as if no longer able to bear the
strain, "Tell me what it is to be. If I am to be happy, it must be at
your cost."</p>

<p>"Yes," Isabel answered, still in that simple way; "but I am glad
that I have seen you. I shall always be glad. Will you not shake hands
with me?"</p>

<p>She put out her hand, and Weeta took it, and thus the two girls
stood. At that moment Weeta seemed the most moved. "It was for him to
decide," she said brokenly. "I don't know what you have said to each
other."</p>

<p>"We have said good-bye," Isabel answered. "Good-bye without
bitterness or reproach. He has chosen you. He loves you. I do not
wonder that he should love you best. You are very beautiful--not what I
expected. His people will admire you, and you will win their affection.
And you must pray that he may never change to you," she added, with a
touch of irony that I think must surely have been unconscious.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Weeta, taking away her hand, and shrinking back. "You do
well to say that."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to hurt you," said Isabel, gently. "I cannot doubt
he loves you, but he loved me only a few short months ago; or, at
least, he told me so." For the first time in the scene her voice shook.
"It's all over," she said hurriedly, turning to Mr. Thurston, who stood
crushed and shamed against the fireplace. "When we meet again,
Archie--for I suppose we shall meet some time in England--you will be
married, and we shall have lived down this trouble. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him with a little queenly movement. He took
it in his, and reverently kissed it. Isabel shuddered, as though the
touch had hurt her. She did not look at him again, but turned and put
her hand in mine. "Come, Rachel," she said, and I took her away.</p>

<p>I did not see her again until the day was nearly over. The door of
her room was fastened, and no answer was given when I knocked. I could
hear her stified sobs within, and I longed to force an entrance and
take her in my arms and weep over her, as a mother might weep over her
child; but I knew that I could bring her no comfort now, and so I went
away sorrowfully, and left her to fight out her battle alone.</p>

<p>When she came out her face had a worn, pinched look, and her eyes
were red and swollen, but she was quite calm.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be alone," she said. "I wanted to look my fate in the
face. When a great shock like this comes and changes all one's life, it
is hard at first to accustom oneself to it. Ever since I got his letter
I have had to tell myself, over and over again, that this thing is
true; that it is real. It seems impossible sometimes to believe that
Archie--my Archie, as he used to be--loves another woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you certain that he really loves her?" I exclaimed. "Isn't
it all glamour?"</p>

<p>She shook her head mournfully. "I suppose all love is glamour--more
or less," she said. "Perhaps he will wake up by-and-by from his dream,
and then it will be bad for him and for her. Perhaps the dream will
last as long as they both shall live. For their sakes I hope it may. My
dream is over. It was a strange thing," she went on, "for him to tell
me of his wild passion for her--those were the words he used. They were
like a knife in one's heart. But the truth was what I had come here to
learn, and, that being the truth, there is nothing for me now but to go
my way and live it down as best I can."</p>

<p>That very night she sent a telegram to Mrs. Bingham, which she
showed me. "My engagement is broken off. I shall join you in Sydney.
Will wire the date."</p>

<p>It was settled that we should leave Wombo on the morrow, and wait in
Stonehampton for the next steamer. It seemed too dreary to let her go
alone.</p>

<p>A happy project occurred to me, and I decided to accompany her part
of her way south; to get off the steamer at Brisbane, and pay a short
visit to my own people on the Ubi. Thus I came to be Isabel's companion
in the darkest hours of her life; and, while my heart ached with pity
for her, I felt an occasional pang for Archie Thurston, as I grew to
realize what a treasure this was which, in his folly and blindness, he
had thrown away.</p>

<p>I had written a little note to Weeta Wilson, telling her of my
plans. She sent no answer then, and I never saw her again. A month
later, to my intense astonishment, I received from her the following
telegram, which was dated from Stonehampton:--</p>

<p>"Try to respect me. I was married privately to Mr. Humphreys
this</p>

<p>morning. We leave for Europe to-night. "WEETA."</p>

<p>Why did she do it? Nobody knew. Her marriage, like everything else
about her, was an enigma. I have never been able to answer to myself
the question, "Did she, or did she not, love Archie Thurston?"</p>

<p>I never saw him again either. He, too, had started for England
before my return to Wombo, where, shortly afterwards, Alec joined me.
The Barradean people were not disposed to be friendly any longer. The
Major blamed me for the catastrophe of her daughter's marriage, as she
persisted in regarding it, though she must certainly have found some
consolation in the reflection that Mr. Humphreys was one of the richest
men in Australia.</p>

<p>A year later, I heard of the marriage of Isabel Cave to Archie
Thurston--Lord Colworth, as I suppose I ought to call him. I wonder if
the glamour of Weeta had quite faded!</p>
