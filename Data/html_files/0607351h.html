<h1>Elf Trap</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Francis Stevens</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>IN THIS our well-advertised, modern world, crammed with engines,
death-dealing shells, life-dealing serums, and science, he who
listens to "old wives' tales" is counted idle. He who believes them,
a superstitious fool. Yet there are some legends which have a
strange, deathless habit of recrudescence in many languages and
lands.</p>

<p>Of one such I have a story to tell. It was related to me by a
well-known specialist in nervous diseases, not as an instance of the
possible truth behind fable, but as a curious case in which--I quote
his words--"the delusions of a diseased brain were reflected by a
second and otherwise sound mentality."</p>

<p>No doubt his view was the right one. And yet, at the finish, I had
the strangest flash of feeling. As if, somewhere, some time, I, like
young Wharton, had stood and seen against blue sky--Elva, of the
sky-hued scarf and the yellow honeysuckles.</p>

<p>But my part is neither to feel nor surmise. I will tell the story
as I heard it, save for substitution of fictitious names for the real
ones. My quotations from the red notebook are verbatim.</p>

<p>Theron Tademus, A.A.S., F.E.S., D.S., et cetera, occupied the
chair of biology in a not-unfamed university. He was the author of a
treatise on cytology, since widely used as a textbook, and of several
important brochures on the more obscure infusoria. As a boy he had
been--in appearance--a romantically charming person. The age of
thirty-seven found him still handsome in a cold, fine-drawn manner,
but almost inhumanly detached from any save scientific interests.</p>

<p>Then, at the height of his career, he died. Having entered his
class-room with intent to deliver the first lecture of the fall term,
he walked to his desk, laid down a small, red note-book, turned,
opened his mouth, went ghastly white and subsided. His assistant,
young Wharton, was first to reach him and first to discover the
shocking truth.</p>

<p>Tademus was unmarried, and his will bequeathed all he possessed to
the university.</p>

<p>The little red book was not at first regarded as important.
Supposed to contain notes for his lecture, it was laid aside. On
being at last read, however, by his assistant in course of arranging
his papers, the book was found to contain not notes, but a diary
covering the summer just passed.</p>

<p>Barring the circumstances of one peculiar incident, Wharton
already knew the main facts of that summer.</p>

<p>Tademus, at the insistence of his physician--the specialist
aforesaid--had spent July and August in the Carolina Mountains not
far north from the famous resort, Asheville. Dr. Locke was friend as
well as medical adviser, and he lent his patient the use of a
bungalow he owned there.</p>

<p>It was situated in a beautiful, but lonely spot, to which the
nearest settlement was Carcassonne. In the valley below stood a tiny
railroad station, but Carcassonne was not built up around this, nor
was it a town at all in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>A certain landscape painter had once raised him a house on that
mountainside, at a place chosen for its magnificent view. Later, he
was wont to invite thither, for summer sketching, one or two of his
more favored pupils. Later still, he increased this number. For their
accommodation other structures were raised near his mountain studio,
and the Blue Ridge summer class became an established fact, with a
name of its own and a rather large membership.</p>

<p>Two roads led thither from the valley. One, that most in use by
the artist colonists, was as good and broad as any Carolina mountain
road could hope to be. The other, a winding, narrow, yellow track,
passed the lonely bungalow of Dr. Locke, and at last split into two
paths, one of which led on to further heights, the second to
Carcassonne.</p>

<p>The distance between colony and bungalow was considerable, and
neither was visible to the other. Tademus was not interested in art,
and, as disclosed by the red book, he was not even aware of
Carcassonne's existence until some days after his arrival at the
bungalow.</p>

<p>Solitude, long walks, deep breathing, and abstinence from work or
sustained thought had been Dr. Locke's prescription, accepted with
seeming meekness by Tademus.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, but a short time passed till Wharton received a
telegram from the professor ordering him to pack and send by express
certain apparatus, including a microscope and dissecting stand. The
assistant obeyed.</p>

<p>Another fortnight and Dr. Locke in turn received an urgent wire.
It was from Jake Higgins, the Negro caretaker whom he had "lent" to
Tademus along with the bungalow.</p>

<p>Leaving his practice to another man's care, Dr. Locke fled for the
Carolina Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>He found his caretaker and his bungalow, but no Tademus.</p>

<p>By Jake's story, the professor had gone to walk one afternoon and
had not returned. Having wired Locke, the caretaker had otherwise
done his best. He notified the county sheriff, and search parties
scoured the mountains. At his appeal, too, the entire Carcassonnian
colony, male and female, turned out with enthusiasm to hunt for
Tademus. Many of them carried easel and sketch-box along, and for
such it is to be feared that their humane search ended with the
discovery of any tempting "tit" in the scenic line.</p>

<p>However, the colony's efforts were at least as successful as the
sheriff's or indeed those of anyone else.</p>

<p>Shortly before Tademus' vanishment, a band of gypsies had settled
themselves in a group of old, empty, half-ruined shacks, about a mile
from Locke's bungalow.</p>

<p>Suspicion fell upon them. A posse visited the encampment, searched
it and questioned every member of the migrant band. They were a
peculiarly ill-favored set, dirty and villainous of feature. Nothing,
however, could be found of either the missing professor or anything
belonging to him.</p>

<p>The posse left, after a quarrel that came near to actual fighting.
A dog--a wretched, starved yellow cur--had attacked one of the
deputies and set its teeth in his boot. He promptly shot it. In their
resentment, the dog's owners drew knives.</p>

<p>The posse were more efficiently armed, and under threat of the
latter's rifles and shotguns, the gypsies reconsidered. They were
warned to pack up and leave, and following a few days' delay, they
obeyed the mandate.</p>

<p>On the very morning of their departure, which was also the eighth
day after Tademus' disappearance, Dr. Locke sat down gloomily to
breakfast. The search, he thought, must be further extended. Let it
cover the whole Blue Ridge, if need be. Somewhere in those mountains
was a friend and patient whom he did not propose to lose.</p>

<p>At one side of the breakfast room was a door. It led into the
cleared-out bedroom which Locke had, with indignation, discovered to
have been converted into a laboratory by the patient he had sent here
to "rest."</p>

<p>Suddenly this door opened. Out walked Theron Tademus.</p>

<p>He seemed greatly amazed to find Locke there, and said that he had
come in shortly after midnight and been in his laboratory ever
since.</p>

<p>Questioned as to his whereabouts before that, he replied
surprisingly that throughout the week he had been visiting with
friends in Carcassonne.</p>

<p>Dr. Locke doubted his statement. And reasonably.</p>

<p>Artists are not necessarily liars, and every artist and
near-artist in the Carcassonne colony had not only denied knowledge
of the professor, but spent a good part of the week helping hunt for
him.</p>

<p>Later, after insisting that Locke accompany him to Carcassonne and
meet his friends there, Tademus suddenly admitted that he had not
previously been near the place. He declined, however, either to
explain his untruthful first statement, or give any other account of
his mysterious absence.</p>

<p>One week ago Tademus had left the bungalow, carrying nothing but a
light cane, and wearing a white flannel suit, canvas shoes, and a
Panama. That was his idea of a tramping costume. He had returned,
dressed in the same suit, hat and shoes. Moreover, though white, they
looked neat as when he started, save for a few grass stains and the
road's inevitable yellow clay about his shoe-soles.</p>

<p>If he had spent the week vagrant-wise, he had been remarkably
successful in keeping his clothes clean.</p>

<p>"Asheville," thought the doctor. "He went by train, stopped at a
hotel, and has returned without the faintest memory of his real
doings. Lame, overtaxed nerves can play that sort of trick with a
man's brain."</p>

<p>But he kept the opinion to himself. Like a good doctor, he soon
dropped the whole subject, particularly because he saw that Tademus
was deeply distressed and trying to conceal the fact.</p>

<p>On plea of taking a long-delayed vacation of his own, Locke
remained some time at the bungalow, guarded his friend from the
curiosity of those who had combed the hills for him, and did all in
his power to restore him to health and a clear brain.</p>

<p>He was so far successful that Tademus returned to his classes in
the fall, with Locke's consent.</p>

<p>To his classes--and death.</p>

<p>Wharton had known all this. He knew that Tademus' whereabouts
during that mysterious week had never been learned. But the diary in
the red book purported to cover the summer, including that week.</p>

<p>To Wharton, the record seemed so supremely curious that he took a
liberty with what was now the university's property. He carried the
book to Dr. Locke.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the latter was about to retire after a day's
work that began before dawn.</p>

<p>"Personal, you say?" Locke handled the book, frowning
slightly.</p>

<p>"Personal. But I feel--when you've finished reading that. I have a
rather queer thing to tell you in addition. You can't understand till
you've read it. I am almost sure that what is described here has a
secret bearing on Professor Tademus' death."</p>

<p>"His heart failed. Overwork. There was no mystery in that."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, doctor. And yet--won't you please read?"</p>

<p>"Run through it aloud for me," said the doctor. "I couldn't read
one of my own prescriptions tonight, and you are more familiar with
that microscopic writing of his."</p>

<p>Wharton complied.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Monday, July 3.</p>

<p>Arrived yesterday. Not worse than expected, but bad enough. If
Locke were here, he should be satisfied. I have absolutely no
occupation. Walked and climbed for two hours, as prescribed. Spent
the rest of day pacing up and down indoors. Enough walking, at least.
I can't sit idle. I can't stop thinking. Locke is a fool!</p>

<p>Thursday, July 6.</p>

<p>Telegraphed Wharton today. He will express me the Swift binocular,
some slides, cover-glasses, and a very little other apparatus. Locke
is a fool! I shall follow his advice, but within reason. There is a
room here lighted by five windows. Old Jake has cleared the bedroom
furniture out. It has qualities as a laboratory. Not, of course, that
I intend doing any real work. An hour or so a day of micrological
observation will only make "resting" tolerable.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 11.</p>

<p>Jake hitched up his "ol' gray mule" and has brought my three cases
from the station' I unpacked the old Stephenson-Swift and set it up.
The mere touch of it brought tears to my eyes. Locke's "rest-cure"
has done that to my nerves!</p>

<p>After unpacking, though, I resolutely let the microscope and other
things be. Walked ten miles up-hill and down. Tried to admire the
landscape, as Locke advised, but can't see much in it. Rocks, trees,
lumpy hills, yellow roads, sky, clouds, buzzards. Beauty! What beauty
is there in this vast, clumsy world that is the outer husk for
nature's real and delicate triumphs?</p>

<p>I saw a man painting today. He was swabbing at a canvas with huge,
clumsy brushes. He had his easel set up by the road, and I stopped to
see what any human being could find hereabout worth picturing.</p>

<p>And what had this painter, this artist, this lover of beauty
chosen for a subject? Why, about a mile from here there is a clump of
ugly, dark trees. A stream runs between them and the road. It is
yellow with clay, and too swift. The more interesting microorganisms
could not exist in it. A ram-shackle, plank bridge crosses it,
leading to the grove, and there, between the trees, stand and lean
some dreary, half-ruined huts.</p>

<p>That scene was the one which my "artist" had chosen for his
subject.</p>

<p>For sheer curiosity I got into conversation with the fellow.</p>

<p>Unusual gibberish of chiaroscuro, flat tones, masses, et cetera.
Not a definite thought in his head as to why he wished to paint those
shacks. I learned one thing, though. He wasn't the isolated specimen
of his kind I had thought him. Locke failed to tell me about
Carcassonne. Think of it! Nearly a hundred of these insane pursuers
of "beauty" are spending the summer within walking distance of the
house I have promised to live in!</p>

<p>And the one who was painting the grove actually invited me to call
on him! I smiled noncommittally, and came home. On the way I passed
the branch road that leads to the place. I had always avoided that
road, but I didn't know why until today. Imagine it! Nearly a
hundred. Some of them women, I suppose. No, I shall keep discreetly
away from Carcassonne.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 15.</p>

<p>Jake informs me that a band of gypsies have settled themselves in
the grove which my Carcassonnian acquaintance chose to paint. They
are living in the ruined huts. Now I shall avoid that road, too. Talk
of solitude! Why, the hills are fairly swarming with artists,
gypsies, and Lord knows who else. One might as well try to rest in a
beehive!</p>

<p>Found some interesting variations of the ciliara living in a
near-by pond. Wonderful! Have recorded over a dozen specimens in
which the macronucleus is unquestionably double. Not lobed, not
pulverate, as in Oxytricha, but double! My summer has not, after all,
been wasted.</p>

<p>Felt singularly slack and tired this morning, and realized that I
have hardly been out of the house in three days. Shall certainly take
a long tramp tomorrow.</p>

<p>Monday, July 17.</p>

<p>Absent-mindedness betrayed me today. I had a very unpleasant
experience. Resolutely keeping my promise to Locke, I sallied forth
this afternoon and walked briskly for some distance. I had, however,
forgotten the gypsies and took my old route.</p>

<p>Soon I met a woman, or rather a girl. She was arrayed in the
tattered, brilliantly colored garments which women of these wandering
tribes affect. There was a scarf about her head. I noticed because
its blue was exactly the same brilliant hue of the sky over the
mountains behind her. There was a stripe of yellow in it, too, and
thrust in her sash she carried a great bunch of yellow flowers--wild
honeysuckle, I think.</p>

<p>Her face was not dark, like the swart faces of most gypsies. On
the contrary, the skin of it had a smooth, firm whiteness. Her
features were fine and delicate.</p>

<p>Passing, we looked at one another, and I saw her eyes brighten in
the strangest, most beautiful manner. I am sure that there was
nothing bold or immodest in her glance. It was rather like the look
of a person who recognizes an old acquaintance, and is glad of it.
Yet we never met before. Had we met, I could not have forgotten
her.</p>

<p>We passed without speaking, of course, and I walked on.</p>

<p>Meeting the girl, I had hardly thought of her as a gypsy, or
indeed tried to classify her in any way. The impression she left was
new in my experience. It was only on reaching the grove that I came
to myself, as it were, and remembered Jake's story of the gypsies who
are camping there.</p>

<p>Then I very quickly emerged from the vague, absurd happiness which
sight of the girl had brought.</p>

<p>While talking with my Carcassonnian, I had observed that grove
rather carefully. I had thought it perfect--that nothing added could
increase the somber ugliness of its trees, nor the desolation of its
gray, ruined, tumbledown old huts.</p>

<p>Today I learned better. To be perfect, ugliness must include
sordid humanity.</p>

<p>The shacks, dreary in themselves, were hideous now. In their
doorways lounged fat, unclean women nursing their filthy offspring.
Older children, clothed in rags, caked with dirt, sprawled and fought
among themselves. Their voices were the snarls of animals.</p>

<p>I realized that the girl with the sky-like scarf had come from
here--out of this filth unspeakable!</p>

<p>A yellow cur, the mere, starved skeleton of a dog, came tearing
down to the bridge. A rusty, jangling bell was tied about its neck
with a string. The beast stopped on the far side and crouched there,
yapping. Its anger seemed to surpass mere canine savagery. The lean
jaws fairly writhed in maniacal but loathsomely feeble ferocity.</p>

<p>A few men, whiskered, dirty-faced, were gathered about a sort of
forge erected in the grove. They were making something, beating it
with hammers in the midst of showers of sparks. As the dog yapped,
one of the men turned and saw me. He spoke to his mates, and to my
dismay they stopped work and transferred their attention to me.</p>

<p>I was afraid that they would cross the bridge, and the idea of
having to talk to them was for some reason inexpressibly
revolting.</p>

<p>They stayed where they were, but one of them suddenly laughed out
loudly, and held up to my view the thing upon which they had been
hammering.</p>

<p>It was a great, clumsy, rough, iron trap. Even at that distance I
could see the huge, jagged teeth, fit to maim a bear--or a man. It
was the ugliest instrument I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I turned away and began walking toward home, and when I looked
back they were at work again.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly, but about the grove there seemed to be a
queer darkness. It was like a place alone and aloof from the world.
The trees, even, were different from the other mountain trees. Their
heavy branches did not stir at all in the wind. They had a strange,
dark, flat look against the sky, as though they had been cut from
dark paper, or rather like the flat trees woven in a tapestry. That
was it. The whole scene was like a flat, dark, unreal picture in
tapestry.</p>

<p>I came straight home. My nerves are undoubtedly in bad shape, and
I think I shall write Locke and ask him to prescribe medicine that
will straighten me up. So far, his "rest-cure" has not been notably
successful.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 19.</p>

<p>I have met her again.</p>

<p>Last night I could not sleep at all. Round midnight I ceased
trying, rose, dressed, and spent the rest of the night with the good
old Stephenson-Swift. My light for night-work--a common oil lamp--is
not very brilliant. This morning I suffered considerable pain behind
the eyes, and determined to give Locke's "walking and open air"
treatment another trial, though discouraged by previous results.</p>

<p>This time I remembered to turn my back on the road which leads to
that hideous grove. The sunlight seemed to increase the pain I was
already suffering. The air was hot, full of dust, and I had to walk
slowly. At the slightest increase of pace my heart would set up a
kind of fluttering, very unpleasant and giving me a sense of
suffocation.</p>

<p>Then I came to the girl.</p>

<p>She was seated on a rock, her lap heaped with wild honeysuckle,
and she was weaving the flower stems together.</p>

<p>Seeing me, she smiled.</p>

<p>"I have your garland finished," she said, "and mine soon will
be."</p>

<p>One would have thought the rock a trysting place at which we had
for a long time been accustomed to meet! In her hand she was
extending to me a wreath, made of the honeysuckle flowers.</p>

<p>I can't imagine what made me act as I did. Weariness and the pain
behind my eyes may have robbed me of my usual good sense.</p>

<p>Anyway, rather to my own surprise, I took her absurd wreath and
sat down where she made room for me on the boulder.</p>

<p>After that we talked.</p>

<p>At this moment, only a few hours later, I couldn't say whether or
not the girl's English was correct, nor exactly what she said. But I
can remember the very sound of her voice.</p>

<p>I recall, too, that she told me her name Elva, and that when I
asked for the rest of it, she informed me that one good name was
enough for one good person.</p>

<p>That struck me as a charmingly humorous sally. I laughed like a
boy--or a fool, God knows which!</p>

<p>Soon she had finished her second garland, and laughingly insisted
that we each crown the other with flowers.</p>

<p>Imagine it. Had one of my students come by then, I am sure he
would have been greatly startled. Professor Theron Tademus, seated on
a rock with a gypsy girl, crowned with wild honeysuckle and adjusting
a similar wreath to the girl's blue-scarfed head!</p>

<p>Luckily, neither the student nor anyone else passed, and in a few
minutes she said something that brought me to my senses. Due to that
inexplicable dimness of memory, I quote the sense, not her words.</p>

<p>"My father is a ruler among our people. You must visit us. For my
sake, the people and my father will make you welcome."</p>

<p>She spoke with the gracious air of a princess, but I rose hastily
from beside her. A vision of the grove had returned--dark,
oppressive--like an old, dark tapestry, woven with the ugly forms and
foliage. I remembered the horrible, filthy tribe from which this girl
had sprung.</p>

<p>Without a word of farewell, I left her there on the rock. I did
not look back, nor did she call after me. Not until reaching home,
when I met old Jake at the door and saw him stare, did I remember the
honeysuckle wreath. I was still wearing it, and carrying my hat.</p>

<p>Snatching at the flowers, I flung them in the ditch and retreated
with what dignity I might into the bungalow's seclusion.</p>

<p>It is night now, and, a little while since, I went out again. The
wreath is here in the room with me. The flowers were unsoiled by the
ditch, and seem fresh as when she gave them to me. They are more
fragrant than I had thought even wild honeysuckle could be.</p>

<p>Elva. Elva of the sky-blue scarf and the yellow honeysuckle</p>

<p>My eyes are heavy, but the pain behind them is gone. I think I
shall sleep tonight.</p>

<p>Friday, July 21.</p>

<p>Is there any man so gullible as he who prides himself on his
accuracy of observation?</p>

<p>I ask this in humility, for I am that man.</p>

<p>Yesterday I rose, feeling fresher than for weeks past. After all,
Locke's treatment seemed worthy of respect. With that in mind, I put
in only a few hours staining some of my binucleate cilia and
finishing the slides.</p>

<p>All the last part of the afternoon I faithfully tramped the roads.
There is undoubtedly a sort of broad, coarse charm in mere landscape,
with its reaches of green, its distant purples, and the sky like a
blue scarf flung over it all. Had the pain of my eyes not returned, I
could almost have enjoyed those vistas.</p>

<p>Having walked farther than usual, it was deep dusk when I reached
home. As if from ambush, a little figure dashed out from behind some
rhododendrons. It seemed to be a child, a boy, though I couldn't see
him clearly, nor how he was dressed.</p>

<p>He thrust something into my hand. To my astonishment, the thing
was a spray of wild honeysuckle.</p>

<p>"Elva--Elva--Elva!"</p>

<p>The strange youngster was fairly dancing up and down before me,
repeating the girl's name and nothing else.</p>

<p>Recovering myself, I surmised that Elva must have sent this boy,
and sure enough, at my insistence he managed to stop prancing long
enough to deliver her message.</p>

<p>Elva's grandmother, he said, was very ill. She had been ailing for
days, but tonight the sickness was worse--much worse. Elva feared
that her grandmother would die, and, "of course," the boy said, "no
doctor will come for our sending!" She had remembered me, as the only
friend she knew among the "outside people." Wouldn't I come and look
at her poor, sick grandmother? And if I had any of the outside
people's medicine in my house, would I please bring that with me?</p>

<p>Well, yes, I did hesitate. Aside from practical and obvious
suspicions, I was possessed with a senseless horror for not only the
gypsy tribe, but the grove itself.</p>

<p>But there was the spray of honeysuckle. In her need, she had sent
that for a token--and sent it to me! Elva, of the sky-like scarf and
laughing mouth.</p>

<p>"Wait here," I said to the boy, rather brusquely, and entered the
house. I had remembered a pocket-case of simple remedies, none of
which I had ever used, but there was a direction pamphlet with them.
If I must play amateur physician, that might help. I looked for Jake,
meaning to inform him of my proposed expedition. Though he had left a
chicken broiling on the kitchen range, he was not about. He might
have gone to the spring for water.</p>

<p>Passing out again, I called the boy, but received no answer. It
was very dark. Toward sunset, the sky had clouded over, so that now I
had not even the benefit of starlight.</p>

<p>I was angry with the boy for not waiting, but the road was
familiar enough, even in the dark. At least, I thought it was, till,
colliding with a clump of holly. I realized that I must have strayed
off and across a bare stretch of yellow clay which defaces the
Mountainside above Locke's bungalow.</p>

<p>I looked back for the guiding lights of its windows, but the trees
hid them. However, the road couldn't be far off. After some stumbling
about, I was sure that my feet were in the right track again.
Somewhat later I perceived a faint, ruddy point of light, to the left
and ahead of me.</p>

<p>As I walked toward it, the rapid rush and gurgle of water soon
apprized me that I had reached the stream with the plank bridge
across it.</p>

<p>There I stood for several minutes, staring toward the ruddy light.
That was all I could see. It seemed, somehow, to cast no illumination
about it.</p>

<p>There came a scamper of paws, the tinkle of a bell, and then a
wild yapping broke out on the stream's far side. That vile, yellow
cur, I thought. Elva, having imposed on my kindness to the extent of
sending for me, might at least have arranged a better welcome than
this.</p>

<p>When I pictured her, crouched in her bright, summer-colored
garments, tending the dreadful old hag that her grandmother must be.
The rest of the tribe were probably indifferent. She could not desert
her sick--and there stood I, hesitant as any other coward!</p>

<p>For the dog's sake I took a firm grip on my cane. Feeling about
with it, I found the bridge and crossed over.</p>

<p>Instantly something flung itself against my legs and was gone
before I could hit out. I heard the dog leaping and barking all
around me. It suddenly struck me that the beast's voice was not like
that of the yellow cur. There was nothing savage in it. This was the
cheerful, excited bark of a well-bred dog that welcomes its master,
or its master's friend. And the bell that tinkled to every leap had a
sweet, silvery note, different from the cracked jangle of the cur's
bell.</p>

<p>I had hated and loathed that yellow brute, and to think that I
need not combat the creature was a relief. The huts, as I recalled
them, weren't fifty yards beyond the stream. There was no sign of a
campfire. Just that one ruddy point of light.</p>

<p>I advanced--</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Wharton paused suddenly in his reading. "Here," he interpolated,
"begins that part of the diary which passed from commonplace to
amazing. And the queer part is that in writing it, Professor Tademus
seems to have been unaware that he was describing anything but an
unusually pleasant experience."</p>

<p>Dr, Locke's heavy brows knit in a frown. "Pleasant!" he snapped.
"The date of that entry?"</p>

<p>"July twenty-one."</p>

<p>"The day he disappeared. I see. Pleasant! And that gypsy
girl--faugh! What an adventure for such a man! No wonder he tried to
lie out of it. I don't think I care to hear the rest, Wharton.
Whatever it is, my friend is dead. Let him rest."</p>

<p>"Oh, but wait," cried the young man, with startled earnestness.
"Good Lord, doctor, do you believe I would bring this book even to
you if it contained that kind of story--about Professor Tademus? No.
Its amazing quality is along different lines than you can possibly
suspect."</p>

<p>"Get on, then," grumbled Locke, and Wharton continued.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Suddenly, as though at a signal, not one, but a myriad of lights
blazed into existence.</p>

<p>It was like walking out of a dark closet into broad day. The first
dazzlement passing, I perceived that instead of the somber grove and
ruined huts, I was facing a group of very beautiful houses.</p>

<p>It is curious how a previous and false assumption--will rule a
man. Having believed myself at the gypsy encampment, several minutes
passed before I could overcome my bewilderment and realize that after
losing my road I had not actually regained it.</p>

<p>That I had somehow wandered into the other branch road, and
reached, not the grove, but Carcassonne!</p>

<p>I had no idea, either, that this artists' colony could be such a
really beautiful place. It is cut by no streets. The houses are set
here and there over the surface of such green lawns as I have never
seen in these mountains of rock and yellow clay.</p>

<p>(Dr. Locke started slightly in his chair. Carcassonne, as he had
himself seen it, flashed before his memory. He did not interrupt, but
from that moment his attention was alertly set, like a man who
listens for the key word of a riddle.)</p>

<p>Everywhere were lights, hung in the flowering branches of trees,
glowing upward from the grass, blazing from every door and window.
Why they should have been turned on so abruptly, after that first
darkness, I do not yet know.</p>

<p>Out of the nearest house a girl came walking. She was dressed
charmingly, in thin, bright-colored silks. A bunch of wild
honeysuckle was thrust in the girdle, and over her hair was flung a
scarf of sky-like blue. I knew her instantly, and began to see a
glimmering of the joke that had been played on me.</p>

<p>The dog bounded toward the girl. He was a magnificent collie. A
tiny silver bell was attached to his neck by a broad ribbon.</p>

<p>I take credit for considerable aplomb in my immediate behavior.
The girl had stopped a little way off. She was laughing, but I had
certainly allowed myself to be victimized.</p>

<p>On my accusation, she at once admitted to having deceived me. She
explained that, perceiving me to be misled by her appearance into
thinking her one of the gypsies, she could not resist carrying out
the joke. She had sent her small brother with the token and
message.</p>

<p>I replied that the boy deserted me, and that I had nearly invaded
the camp of real gypsies while looking for her and the fictitious
dying grandmother.</p>

<p>At this she appeared even more greatly amused. Elva's mirth has a
peculiarly contagious quality. Instead of being angry, I found myself
laughing with her.</p>

<p>By this time quite a throng of people had emerged on the lawns,
and leading me to a dignified, fine-looking old man who she said was
her father, she presented me. In the moment, I hardly noticed that
she used my first name only, Theron, which I had told her when we sat
on the roadside boulder. I have observed since that all these people
use the single name only, in presentation and intercourse. Though
lacking personal experience with artists, I have heard that they are
inclined to peculiar "fads" of unconventionality. I had never,
however, imagined that they could be attractive to a man like myself,
or pleasant to know.</p>

<p>I am enlightened. These Carcassonnian "colonists" are the only
charming, altogether delightful people whom I have ever met.</p>

<p>One and all, they seemed acquainted with Elva's amusing jest at my
expense. They laughed with us, but in recompense have made me one of
themselves in the pleasantest manner.</p>

<p>I dined in the house of Elva's father. The dining-room, or rather
hall, is a wonderful place. Due to much microscopic work, I am
inclined to see only clumsiness--largeness--in what other people
characterize as beauty. Carcassonne is different. There is a minute
perfection about the architecture of these artists' houses, the
texture of their clothes, and even the delicate contour of their
faces, which I find amazingly agreeable.</p>

<p>There is no conventionality of costume among them. Both men and
women dress as they please. Their individual taste is exquisite, and
the result is an array of soft fabrics, and bright colors,
flowerlike, rather than garish.</p>

<p>Till last night I never learned the charm of what is called "fancy
dress," nor the genial effect it may exert on even a rather somber
nature, such as I admit mine to be.</p>

<p>Elva, full of good-natured mischief, insisted that I must "dress
for dinner." Her demand was instantly backed by the whole laughing
throng. Carried off my feet in a way to which I am not at all used, I
let them drape me in white robes, laced with silver embroideries like
the delicate crystallization of hoar-frost. Dragged hilariously
before a mirror, I was amazed at the change in my appearance.</p>

<p>Unlike the black, scarlet-hooded gown of my university, these
glittering robes lent me not dignity, but a kind of--I can only call
it a noble youthfulness. I looked younger, and at the same time
keener--more alive. And either the contagious spirit of my
companions, or some resurgence of boyishness filled me with a sudden
desire to please; to be merry with the merry-makers, and--I must be
frank--particularly to keep Elva's attention where it seemed
temporarily fixed--on myself.</p>

<p>My success was unexpectedly brilliant. There is something in the
very atmosphere of Carcassonne which, once yielded to, exhilarates
like wine. I have never danced, nor desired to learn. Last night,
after a banquet so perfect that I hardly recall its details, I
danced. I danced with Elva--and with Elva--and always with Elva. She
laughed aside all other partners. We danced on no polished floors,
but out on the green lawns, under white, laughing stars. Our music
was not orchestral. Wherever the light-footed couples chose to
circle, there followed a young flutist, piping on his flute of white
ivory.</p>

<p>Fluttering wings, driving clouds, wind tossed leaves--all the
light, swift things of the air were in that music. It lifted and
carried one with it. One did not need to learn. One danced! It seems,
as I write, that the flute's piping is still in my ears, and that its
echoes will never cease. Elva's voice is like the ivory flutels. Last
night I was mad with the music and her voice. We danced--I know not
how long, nor when we ceased.</p>

<p>This morning I awakened in a gold-and-ivory room, with round
windows that were full of blue sky and crossed by blossoming
branches. Dimly I recalled that Elva's father had urged me to accept
his hospitality for the night.</p>

<p>Too much of such new happiness may have gone to my head, I'm
afraid. At least, it was nothing stronger. At dinner I drank only one
glass of wine-sparkling, golden stuff, but mild and with a taste like
the fragrance of Elva's wild honeysuckle blooms.</p>

<p>It is midmorning now, and I am writing this seated on a marble
bench beside a pool in the central court of my host's house. I am
waiting for Elva, who excused herself to attend to some duty or
other. I found this book in my pocket, and thought best to make an
immediate record of not only a good joke on myself, but the only
really pleasant social experience I have ever enjoyed.</p>

<p>I must lay aside these fanciful white robes, bid Elva good-by, and
return to my lonely bungalow and Jake. The poor old man is probably
tearing his hair over my unexplained absence. But I hope for another
invitation to Carcassonne!</p>

<p>Saturday, July 22.</p>

<p>I seem to be "staying on" indefinitely. This won't do. I spoke to
Elva of my extended visit, and she laughingly informed me that people
who have drunk the wine and worn the woven robes of Carcassonne
seldom wish to leave. She suggested that I give up trying to "escape"
and spend my life here. Jest, of course; but I half wished her words
were earnest. She and her people are spoiling me for the common,
workaday world.</p>

<p>Not that they are idle, but their occupations as well as pleasures
are of a delicate, fascinating beauty.</p>

<p>Whole families are stopping here, including the children. I don't
care for children, as a rule, but these are harmless as butterflies.
I met Elva's messenger, her brother. He is a funny, dear little elf.
How even in the dark I fancied him one of those gypsy brats is hard
to conceive. But then I took Elva herself for a gypsy!</p>

<p>My new friends engage in many pursuits besides painting. "Crafts,"
I believe they are called. This morning Elva took me around the
shops--shops like architectural blossoms, carved out of the finest
marble.</p>

<p>They make jewelry, weave fabrics, tool leather, and follow many
other interesting occupations. Set in the midst of the lawns is a
forge. Every part of it, even to the iron anvil, is embellished with
a fernlike inlay of other metals. Several amateur silversmiths were
at work there, but Elva hurried me away before I could see what they
were about.</p>

<p>I have inquired for the young painter who first told me of
Carcassonne and invited me to visit him there. I can't recall his
name, but on describing him to Elva she replied vaguely that not
every "outsider" was permanently welcome among her people.</p>

<p>I didn't press the question. Remembering the ugliness which that
same painter had been committing to canvas, I could understand that
his welcome among these exquisite workers might be short-lived. He
was probably banished, or banished himself, soon after our interview
on the road.</p>

<p>I must be careful, lest I wear out my own welcome. Yet the very
thought of that old, rough, husk of a world that I must return to,
brings back the sickness, and the pain behind my eyes that I had
almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 23.</p>

<p>Elva! Her presence alone is delight. The sky is not bluer than her
scarf and eyes. Sunlight is a duller gold than the wild honeysuckle
she weaves in garlands for our heads.</p>

<p>Today, like child sweethearts, we carved our names on the smooth
trunk of a tree. "Elva--Theron." And a wreath to shut them in. I am
happy. Why--why, indeed should I leave Carcassonne?</p>

<p>Monday, July 24.</p>

<p>Still here, but this is the last night that I shall impose upon
these regally hospitable people. An incident occurred today, pathetic
from one viewpoint, outrageous from another. I was asleep when it
happened, and only woke up at the sound of the gunshot.</p>

<p>Some rough young mountaineers rode into Carcassonne and wantonly
killed Elva's collie dog. They claimed, I believe, that the unlucky
animal attacked one of their number. A lie! The dog was gentle as a
kitten. He probably leaped and barked around their horses and annoyed
the young brutes. They had ridden off before I reached the scene.</p>

<p>Elva was crying, and no wonder. They had blown her pet's head
clean off with a shotgun. Don't know what will be done about it. I
wanted to go straight to the county sheriff, but Elva wouldn't have
that. I pretended to give in but if her father doesn't see to the
punishment of those men, I will. Murderous devils! Elva is too
forgiving.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 26.</p>

<p>I watched the silversmiths today. Elva was not with me. I had no
idea that silver was worked like iron. They must use some peculiar
amalgam, or it would melt in the furnace, Instead of emerging
white-hot, to be beaten with tiny, delicate hammers.</p>

<p>They were making a strange looking contraption. It was all silver,
beaten into floral patterns, but the general shape was a riddle to
me. Finally I asked one of the smiths what they were about. He is a
tall fellow, with a merry, dark face.</p>

<p>"Guess!" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Can't. To my ignorance, it resembles a Chinese puzzle.'</p>

<p>"Something more curious than that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"An--elf-trap!" He laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>"Please!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a trap anyway. See this?" The others had stepped back
good-naturedly. With his hammer he pressed on a lever. Instantly two
slender, jaw-like parts of the queer machine opened wide. They were
set with needlelike points, or teeth. It was all red-hot, and when he
removed his hammer the jaws clashed in a shower of sparks.</p>

<p>"It's a trap, of course." I was still puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a very remarkable one. This trap will not only catch,
but it will recatch."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"If any creature, man, say--" he was laughing again-"walks into
this trap, he may escape it. But sooner or later--soon, I should
think--it will catch him again. That is why we call it an
elf-trap!"</p>

<p>I perceived suddenly that he was making pure game of me. His mates
were all laughing at the nonsense. I moved off, not offended, but
perturbed in another way.</p>

<p>He and his absurd silver trap-toy had reminded me of the gypsies.
What a horrible, rough iron thing that was which they had held up to
me from their forge. Men capable of creating such an uncouthly cruel
instrument as that jag toothed trap would be terrible to meet in the
night. And I had come near blundering in among them--at night!</p>

<p>This won't do. I have been happy. Don't let me drop back into the
morbidly nervous condition which invested those gypsies with more
than human horror. Elva is calling me. I have been too long
alone.</p>

<p>Friday, July 28.</p>

<p>Home again. I am writing this in my bungalow-laboratory. Gray dawn
is breaking, and I have been at work here since midnight. Feel
strangely depressed. Need breakfast, probably.</p>

<p>Last night Elva and I were together in the court of her father's
house. The pool in the center of it is lighted from below to a golden
glow. We were watching the goldfish, with their wide, filmy tails of
living lace.</p>

<p>Suddenly I gave a sharp cry. I had seen a thing in the water more
important than goldfish. Snatching out the small collecting bottle,
without which I never go abroad, I made a quick pass at the pool's
glowing surface.</p>

<p>Elva had started back, rather frightened.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>I held the bottle up and peered closely. There was no mistake.</p>

<p>"Dysteria," I said triumphantly. "Dysteria ciliata. Dysterlus
giganticus, to give a unique specimen the separate name he deserves.
Why, Elva, this enormous creature will give me a new insight on his
entire species!"</p>

<p>"What enormous creature?"</p>

<p>For the first time I saw Elva nearly petulant. But I was filled
with enthusiasm. I let her look in the bottle.</p>

<p>"There!" I ejaculated. "See him?"</p>

<p>"Where? I can't see anything but water--and a tiny speck in
it."</p>

<p>"That," I explained proudly, "is dysterius giganticus. Large
enough to be seen by the naked eye. Why, child, he's a monster of his
kind. A fresh-water variety, too!"</p>

<p>I thrust the bottle in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Home, of course. I can't get this fellow under the microscope any
too quickly."</p>

<p>I had forgotten how wide apart are the scientific and artistic
temperaments. No explanation I could make would persuade Elva that my
remarkable capture was worth walking a mile to examine properly.</p>

<p>"You are all alike!" she cried. "All! You talk of love, but your
love is for gold, or freedom, or some pitiful foolish nothingness
like that speck of life you call by a long name--and leave me
for!"</p>

<p>"But," I protested, "only for a little while. I shall come
back."</p>

<p>She shook her head. This was Elva in a new mood, dark brows drawn,
laughing mouth drooped to a sullen curve. I felt sorry to leave her
angry, but my visit had already been preposterously long. Besides, a
rush of desire had swept me to get back to my natural surroundings. I
wanted the feel of the micrometer adjuster in my fingers, and to see
the round, speckled white field under the lens pass from blurred
chaos to perfect definition.</p>

<p>She let me go at last. I promised solemnly to come to her whenever
she should send or call. Foolish child! Why, I can walk over to
Carcassonne every day, if she likes.</p>

<p>I hear Jake rattling about in the breakfast-room. Conscience
informs me that I have treated him rather badly. Wonder where he
thought I was? Couldn't have been much worried, or he would have
hunted me up in Carcassonne.</p>

<p>August 30.</p>

<p>I shall not make any further entries in this book. My day for the
making of records is over, I think. Any sort of records. I go back to
my classes next month. God knows what I shall say to them! Elva.</p>

<p>I may as well finish the story here.</p>

<p>Every day I find it harder to recall the details. If I hadn't this
book, with what I wrote in it when I was--when I was there, I should
believe that my brain had failed in earnest.</p>

<p>Locke said I couldn't have been in Carcassonne. He stood in the
breakfast-room, with the sunlight striking across him. I saw him
clearly. I saw the huge, coarse, ugly creature that he was. And in
that minute, I knew.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't admit it, even to myself. I made him go with me to
Carcassonne. There was no stream. There was no bridge.</p>

<p>The houses were wretched bungalows, set about on the bare, flat,
yellow clay of the Mountainside. The people--artists, save the
mark!--were a common, carelessly dressed, painting-aproned crowd who
fulfilled my original idea of an artists colony.</p>

<p>Their coarse features and thick skins sickened me. Locke walked
home beside me, very silent. I could hardly bear his company.</p>

<p>He was gross--coarse--human!</p>

<p>Toward evening, managing to escape his company, I stole up the
road to the gypsy's grove. The huts were empty. That queer look, as
of a flat, dark tapestry, was gone from the grove.</p>

<p>I crossed the plank bridge. Among the trees I found ashes, and a
depression where the forge had stood. Something else, too. A dog, or
rather its unburied remains. The yellow cur. Its head had been blown
off by a shotgun. An ugly little bell lay in the mess, tied to a
piece of string.</p>

<p>One of the trees--it had a smooth trunk--and carved in the bark--I
can't write it. I went away and left those two names carved
there.</p>

<p>The wild honeysuckle has almost ceased to bloom. I can leave now.
Locke says I am well, and that I can return to my classes.</p>

<p>I have not entered my laboratory since that morning. Locke admires
my "willpower" for dropping all that till physical health should have
returned. Will-power! I shall never, as long as I live, look into a
microscope again.</p>

<p>Perhaps she will know that somehow, and send or call for me
quickly.</p>

<p>I have drunk the wine and worn the woven robes of her people. They
made me one of them. Is it right that they should cast me out,
because I did not understand what I have since guessed the meaning of
so well?</p>

<p>I can't bear the human folk about me. They are clumsy, revolting.
And I can't work.</p>

<p>God only knows what I shall say to my classes.</p>

<p>Here is the end of my last record--till she calls!</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>There was silence in Locke's private study. At last the doctor
expelled his breath in a long sigh. He might have been holding it all
the time.</p>

<p>"Great-Heavens!" he ejaculated. "Poor old Tademus! And I thought
his trouble in the summer there was a temporary lapse. But he talked
like a sane man. Acted like one, too, by Jove! With his mind in that
condition! And in spite of the posse, he must have been with the
gypsies all that week. You can see it. Even through his delusions,
you catch occasional notes of reality.</p>

<p>"I heard of that dog-shooting, and he speaks of being asleep when
it happened. Where was he concealed that the posse didn't find him?
Drugged and hidden under some filthy heap of rags in one of the huts,
do you think? And why hide him at all, and then let him go? He
returned the very day they left."</p>

<p>At the volley of questions, Wharton shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't even guess about that. He was certainly among the
gypsies. But as for his delusions, to call them so, there is a kind
of beauty and coherence about them which I--well, which I don't
like!"</p>

<p>The doctor eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>"You can't mean that you-"</p>

<p>"Doctor," said Wharton softly, "do you recall what he wrote of the
silversmiths and their work? They were making an elf-trap. Well, I
think the elf-trap--caught him!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Locke's tired eyes opened wide. A look of alarm flashed into them.
The alarm was for Wharton, not himself.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said the latter. "I haven't finished. You know that I was
in the classroom at the moment when Professor Tademus died?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I was the first to reach him. But before that, I stood near
the desk. There are three windows at the foot of that room. Every
other man there faced the desk. I faced the windows. The professor
entered, laid down his book and turned to the class. As he did so, a
head appeared in one of those windows. They are close to the ground,
and a person standing outside could easily look in.</p>

<p>"The head was a woman's. No, I am not inventing this. I saw her
head, draped in a blue scarf. I noticed, because the scarf's blueness
gave me the strangest thrill of delight. It was the exact blue of the
sky behind it. Then she had raised her hand. I saw it. In her fingers
was a spray of yellow flowers--yellow as sunshine. She waved them in
a beckoning motion. Like this.</p>

<p>"Then Tademus dropped.</p>

<p>"And there are legends, you know, of strange people, either more
or less than human, who appear as gypsies, but are not the real
gypsies, that possess queer powers. Their outer appearance is rough
and vile, but behind that, as a veil, they live a wonderful hidden
life of their own.</p>

<p>"And a man who has been with them once is caught--caught in the
real elf-trap, which the smiths' work only symbolized. He may escape,
but he can't forget nor be joined again with his own race, while to
return among them, he must walk the dark road that Tademus had taken
when she called.</p>

<p>"Oh. I've scoffed at 'old wives' tales' with the rest of our
overeducated, modern kind. I can't ever scoff again, you see,
because-</p>

<p>"What's that? A prescription? For me? Why, doctor, you don't yet
understand. I saw her, I tell you. Elva! Elva! Elva, of the wild
honeysuckle and the sky-like scarf!"</p>
