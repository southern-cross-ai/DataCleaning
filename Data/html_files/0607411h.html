  <p class="note">Now this is the creed from the Book of the Bush&mdash;<br>
    Should be simple and plain to a dunce:<br>
  &ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s in a hole you must pass round the hat&mdash;<br>
    Were he jail-bird or gentleman once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is&nbsp;it any harm to wake yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, though it was Sunday
    morning, it was no harm to wake me; but the shearer had mistaken me for a
    deaf jackeroo, who was staying at the shanty and was something like me, and
    had good-naturedly shouted almost at the top of his voice, and he woke the
    whole shanty. Anyway he woke three or four others who were sleeping on beds
    and stretchers, and one on a shake-down on the floor, in the same room. It
    had been a wet night, and the shanty was full of shearers from Big Billabong
    Shed which had cut out the day before. My room mates had been drinking and
    gambling overnight, and they swore luridly at the intruder for disturbing
    them.</p>
  <p>He was six-foot-three or thereabout. He was loosely built, bony, sandy-complexioned
    and grey eyed. He wore a good-humoured grin at most times, as I noticed later
    on; he was of a type of bushman that I always liked&mdash;the sort that seem
    to get more good-natured the longer they grow, yet are hardknuckled and would
    accommodate a man who wanted to fight, or thrash a bully in a good-natured
    way. The sort that like to carry somebody&rsquo;s baby round, and cut wood,
    carry water and do little things for overworked married bushwomen. He wore
    a saddle-tweed sac suit two sizes too small for him, and his face, neck,
    great hands and bony wrists were covered with sunblotches and freckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope I ain&rsquo;t disturbin&rsquo; yer,&rdquo; he shouted, as
    he bent over my bunk, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a cove&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
    deaf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    know I was yellin&rsquo;. I thought you was the deaf feller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
    trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait till them other chaps is done swearin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll
    tell yer,&rdquo;  he said. He spoke with a quiet, good-natured drawl, with
    something of the nasal twang, but tone and drawl distinctly Australian&mdash;altogether
    apart from that of the Americans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, spit it out for Christ&rsquo;s sake, Long&rsquo;un!&rdquo; yelled
    One-eyed Bogan, who had been the worst swearer in a rough shed, and he fell
    back on his bunk as if his previous remarks had exhausted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that there sick jackeroo that was pickin&rsquo;-up at
    Big Billabong,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;He had to knock off the first
    week, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been here ever since. They&rsquo;re sendin&rsquo; him
    away to the hospital in Sydney by the speeshall train. They&rsquo;re just
    goin&rsquo; to take him up in the wagonette to the railway station, an&rsquo; I
    thought I might as well go round with the hat an&rsquo; get him a few bob.
    He&rsquo;s got a missus and kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer always goin&rsquo; round with yer gory hat!&rdquo; growled Bogan. &ldquo;Yer&rsquo;d
    blanky well take it round in hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing, Bogan,&rdquo; muttered Gentleman
    Once, on the shake-down, with his face to the wall.</p>
  <p>The hat was a genuine &ldquo;cabbage-tree,&rdquo; one of the sort that &ldquo;last
    a lifetime.&rdquo; It was well coloured, almost black in fact with weather
    and age, and it had a new strap round the base of the crown. I looked into
    it and saw a dirty pound note and some silver. I dropped in half a crown,
    which was more than I could spare, for I had only been a green-hand at Big
    Billabong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now then, you fellers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep your hat on your head, and your money in
    your pockets and your sympathy somewhere else,&rdquo; growled Jack Moonlight
    as he raised himself painfully on his elbow and felt under his pillow for
    two half-crowns.  &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s two half-carers.
    Chuck &rsquo;em in and let me sleep for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gentleman Once, the gambler, rolled round on his shakedown, bringing his
    good-looking, dissipated face from the wall. He had turned in in his clothes
    and, with considerable exertion he shoved his hand down into the pocket of
    his trousers, which were a tight fit. He brought up a roll of pound notes
    and could find no silver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the Giraffe, &ldquo;I might as well lay a
    quid. I&rsquo;ll chance it anyhow. Chuck it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got rats this mornin&rsquo;, Gentleman Once,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan.  &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a blanky horse race.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I have,&rdquo; said Gentleman Once, and he turned
    to the wall again with his head on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bogan, yer might as well chuck in somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the jackeroo?&rdquo; asked the Bogan,
    tugging his trousers from under the mattress.</p>
  <p>Moonlight said something in a low tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; he has!&rdquo; said Bogan. &ldquo;Well, I pity
    the &mdash;&mdash;! Here, I&rsquo;ll chuck in half a &mdash;&mdash; quid!&rdquo; and
    he dropped half a sovereign into the hat.</p>
  <p>The fourth man, who was known to his face as &ldquo;BarcooRot,&rdquo; and
    behind his back as &ldquo;The Mean Man,&rdquo; had been drinking all night,
    and not even Bogan&rsquo;s stump-splitting adjectives could rouse him. So
    Bogan got out of bed, and calling on us (as blanky female cattle) to witness
    what he was about to do, he rolled the drunkard over, prospected his pockets
    till he made up five shillings (or a &ldquo;caser&rdquo; in bush language),
    and &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; them into the hat.</p>
  <p>And Barcoo-Rot is probably unconscious to this day that he was ever connected
    with an act of charity.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe struck the deaf jackeroo in the next room. I heard the chaps
    cursing &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for waking them, and &ldquo;Deaf-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for
    being, as they thought at first, the indirect cause of the disturbance. I
    heard the Giraffe and his hat being condemned in other rooms and cursed along
    the veranda where more shearers were sleeping; and after a while I turned
    out.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was carefully fixing a mattress and pillows on the floor of
    a wagonette, and presently a man, who looked like a corpse, was carried out
    and lifted into the trap.</p>
  <p>As the wagonette started, the shanty-keeper&mdash;a fat, soulless-looking
    man&mdash;put his hand in his pocket and dropped a quid into the hat which
    was still going round, in the hands of the Giraffe&rsquo;s mate, little Teddy
    Thompson, who was as far below medium height as the Giraffe was above it.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe took the horse&rsquo;s head and led him along on the most level
    parts of the road towards the railway station, and two or three chaps went
    along to help get the sick man into the train.</p>
  <p>The shearing-season was over in that district, but I got a job of house-painting,
    which was my trade, at the Great Western Hotel (a two-story brick place),
    and I stayed in Bourke for a couple of months.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was a Victorian native from Bendigo. He was well known in Bourke
    and to many shearers who came through the great dry scrubs from hundreds
    of miles round. He was stakeholder, drunkard&rsquo;s banker, peacemaker where
    possible, referee or second to oblige the chaps when a fight was on, big
    brother or uncle to most of the children in town, final court of appeal when
    the youngsters had a dispute over a foot-race at the school picnic, referee
    at their fights, and he was the stranger&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The feller as knows can battle around for himself,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d
    say.  &ldquo;But I always like to do what I can for a hard-up stranger cove.
    I was a green-hand jackeroo once meself, and I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always bothering about other people, Giraffe,&rdquo; said
    Tom Hall, the shearers&rsquo; union secretary, who was only a couple of inches
    shorter than the Giraffe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it, you can take
    it from me&mdash;I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s a feller to do?&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    only hangin&rsquo;  round here till shearin&rsquo; starts agen, an&rsquo; a
    cove might as well be doin&rsquo;  something. Besides, it ain&rsquo;t as
    if I was like a cove that had old people or a wife an&rsquo; kids to look
    after. I ain&rsquo;t got no responsibilities. A feller can&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.
    Besides, I like to lend a helpin&rsquo; hand when I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; said Tom, most of whose screw
    went in borrowed quids, etc. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say is that you&rsquo;ll
    get no thanks, and you might blanky well starve in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no fear of me starvin&rsquo; so long as I&rsquo;ve
    got me hands about me; an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a cove as wants thanks,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was always helping some-one or something. Now it was a bit of a  &ldquo;darnce&rdquo; that
    we was gettin&rsquo; up for the girls; again it was Mrs Smith, the woman
    whose husban&rsquo; was drowned in the flood in the Bogan River lars&rsquo; Crismas,
    or that there poor woman down by the Billabong&mdash;her husband cleared
    out and left her with a lot o&rsquo; kids. Or Bill Something, the bullocky,
    who was run over by his own wagon, while he was drunk, and got his leg broke.</p>
  <p>Toward the end of his spree One-eyed Bogan broke loose and smashed nearly
    all the windows of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, and next morning he was fined
    heavily at the police court. About dinner-time I encountered the Giraffe
    and his hat, with two half-crowns in it for a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but One-eyed
    Bogan carn&rsquo;t pay his fine, an&rsquo; I thought we might fix it up for
    him. He ain&rsquo;t half a bad sort of feller when he ain&rsquo;t drinkin&rsquo;.
    It&rsquo;s only when he gets too much booze in him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After shearing, the hat usually started round with the Giraffe&rsquo;s own
    dirty crumpled pound note in the bottom of it as a send-off, later on it
    was half a sovereign, and so on down to half a crown and a shilling, as he
    got short of stuff; till in the end he would borrow a &ldquo;few bob&rdquo;&mdash;which
    he always repaid after next shearing&mdash;&ldquo;just to start the thing
    goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were several yarns about him and his hat. &rsquo;Twas said that the
    hat had belonged to his father, whom he resembled in every respect, and it
    had been going round for so many years that the crown was worn as thin as
    paper by the quids, halfquids, casers, half-casers, bobs and tanners or sprats&mdash;to
    say nothing of the scrums&mdash;that had been chucked into it in its time
    and shaken up.</p>
  <p>They say that when a new governor visited Bourke the Giraffe happened to
    be standing on the platform close to the exit, grinning good-humouredly,
    and the local toady nudged him urgently and said in an awful whisper, &ldquo;Take
    off your hat! Why don&rsquo;t you take off your hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t hard up, is
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they fondly cherish an anecdote to the effect that, when the One-Man-One-Vote
    Bill was passed (or Payment of Members, or when the first Labour Party went
    in&mdash;I forget on which occasion they said it was) the Giraffe was carried
    away by the general enthusiasm, got a few beers in him, &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; a
    quid into his hat, and sent it round. The boys contributed by force of habit,
    and contributed largely, because of the victory and the beer. And when the
    hat came back to the Giraffe, he stood holding it in front of him with both
    hands and stared blankly into it for a while. Then it dawned on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blowed if I haven&rsquo;t bin an&rsquo; gone an&rsquo; took up a
    bloomin&rsquo; collection for meself!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He was almost a teetotaller, but he stood his shout in reason. He mostly
    drank ginger beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a feller that boozes, but I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen
    chaps enjoyin&rsquo; themselves, so long as they don&rsquo;t go too far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was common for a man on the spree to say to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! here&rsquo;s five quid. Look after it for me, Giraffe, will
    yer, till I git off the booze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His real name was Bob Brothers, and his bush names, &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un,&rdquo;  &ldquo;The
    Giraffe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Send-round-the-hat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chuck-in-a-bob,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ginger-ale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some years before, camels and Afghan drivers had been imported to the Bourke
    district; the camels did very well in the dry country, they went right across
    country and carried everythink from sardines to flooring-boards. And the
    teamsters loved the Afghans nearly as much as Sydney furniture makers love
    the cheap Chinese in the same line. They love &rsquo;em even as union shearers
    on strike love blacklegs brought up-country to take their places.</p>
  <p>Now the Giraffe was a good, straight unionist, but in cases of sickness
    or trouble he was as apt to forget his unionism, as all bushmen are, at all
    times (and for all time), to forget their creed. So, one evening, the Giraffe
    blundered into the Carriers&rsquo; Arms&mdash;of all places in the world&mdash;when
    it was full of teamsters; he had his hat in his hand and some small silver
    and coppers in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, you fellers, there&rsquo;s a poor, sick Afghan in the camp
    down there along the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A big, brawny bullock-driver took him firmly by the shoulders, or, rather
    by the elbows, and ran him out before any damage was done. The Giraffe took
    it as he took most things, good-humouredly; but, about dusk, he was seen
    slipping down towards the Afghan camp with a billy of soup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; remarked Tom Hall, &ldquo;that when the Giraffe
    goes to heaven&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the only one of us, as far as I can see,
    that has a ghost of a show&mdash;I believe that when he goes to heaven, the
    first thing he&rsquo;ll do will be to take his infernal hat round amongst
    the angels&mdash;getting up a collection for this damned world that he left
    behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s so much to his credit, after
    all,&rdquo;  said Jack Mitchell, shearer. &ldquo;You see, the Giraffe is
    ambitious; he likes public life, and that accounts for him shoving himself
    forward with his collections. As for bothering about people in trouble, that&rsquo;s
    only common curiosity; he&rsquo;s one of those chaps that are always shoving
    their noses into other people&rsquo;s troubles. And, as for looking after
    sick men&mdash;why! there&rsquo;s nothing the Giraffe likes better than pottering
    round a sick man, and watching him and studying him. He&rsquo;s awfully interested
    in sick men, and they&rsquo;re pretty scarce out here. I tell you there&rsquo;s
    nothing he likes better&mdash;except, maybe, it&rsquo;s pottering round a
    corpse. I believe he&rsquo;d ride forty miles to help and sympathize and
    potter round a funeral. The fact of the matter is that the Giraffe is only
    enjoying himself with other people&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
    it is. It&rsquo;s only vulgar curiosity and selfishness. I set it down to
    his ignorance; the way he was brought up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days after the Afghan incident the Giraffe and his hat had a run of
    luck. A German, one of a party who were building a new wooden bridge over
    the Big Billabong, was helping unload some girders from a truck at the railway
    station, when a big log slipped on the skids and his leg was smashed badly.
    They carried him to the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, which was the nearest hotel,
    and into a bedroom behind the bar, and sent for the doctor. The Giraffe was
    in evidence as usual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It vas not that at all,&rdquo; said German Charlie, when they asked
    him if he was in much pain. &ldquo;It vas not that at all. I don&rsquo;t
    cares a damn for der bain; but dis is der tird year&mdash;und I vas going
    home dis year&mdash;after der gontract&mdash;und der gontract yoost commence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the burden of his song all through, between his groans.</p>
  <p>There were a good few chaps sitting quietly about the bar and veranda when
    the doctor arrived. The Giraffe was sitting at the end of the counter, on
    which he had laid his hat while he wiped his face, neck, and forehead with
    a big speckled &ldquo;sweatrag.&rdquo; It was a very hot day.</p>
  <p>The doctor, a good-hearted young Australian, was heard saying something.
    Then German Charlie, in a voice that rung with pain:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make that leg right, doctor&mdash;quick! Dis is der tird pluddy year&mdash;und
    I must go home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor asked him if he was in great pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neffer mind der pluddy bain, doctor! Neffer mind der pluddy bain!
    Dot vas nossing. Make dat leg well quick, doctor. Dis vas der last gontract,
    and I vas going home dis year.&rdquo; Then the words jerked out of him by
    physical agony: &ldquo;Der girl vas vaiting dree year, und&mdash;by Got!
    I must go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The publican&mdash;Watty Braithwaite, known as &ldquo;Watty Broadweight,&rdquo; or,
    more familiarly, &ldquo;Watty Bothways&rdquo;&mdash;turned over the Giraffe&rsquo;s
    hat in a tired, bored sort of way, dropped a quid into it, and nodded resignedly
    at the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe caught up the hint and the hat with alacrity. The hat went all
    round town, so to speak; and, as soon as his leg was firm enough not to come
    loose on the road German Charlie went home.</p>
  <p>It was well known that I contributed to the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;and
    several other papers. The Giraffe&rsquo;s bump of reverence was very large,
    and swelled especially for sick men and poets. He treated me with much more
    respect than is due from a bushman to a man, and with an odd sort of extra
    gentleness I sometimes fancied. But one day he rather surprised me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said in a shamefaced way. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know as you go in for sportin&rsquo;, but One-eyed Bogan an&rsquo; Barcoo-Rot
    is goin&rsquo; to have a bit of a scrap down the Billybong this evenin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of a what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of fight to a finish,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;An&rsquo; the
    chaps is tryin&rsquo; to fix up a fiver to put some life into the thing.
    There&rsquo;s bad blood between One-eyed Bogan and BarcooRot, an&rsquo; it
    won&rsquo;t do them any harm to have it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a great fight, I remember. There must have been a couple of score
    blood-soaked handkerchiefs (or &ldquo;sweat-rags&rdquo;) buried in a hole
    on the field of battle, and the Giraffe was busy the rest of the evening
    helping to patch up the principals. Later on he took up a small collection
    for the loser, who happened to be Barcoo-Rot in spite of the advantage of
    an eye.</p>
  <p>The Salvation Army lassie, who went round with the War Cry, nearly always
    sold the Giraffe three copies.</p>
  <p>A new-chum parson, who wanted a subscription to build or enlarge a chapel,
    or something, sought the assistance of the Giraffe&rsquo;s influence with
    his mates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Giraffe, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a churchgoer
    meself. I ain&rsquo;t what you might call a religious cove, but I&rsquo;ll
    be glad to do what I can to help yer. I don&rsquo;t suppose I can do much.
    I ain&rsquo;t been to church since I was a kiddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The parson was shocked, but later on he learned to appreciate the Giraffe
    and his mates, and to love Australia for the bushman&rsquo;s sake, and it
    was he who told me the above anecdote.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe helped fix some stalls for a Catholic Church bazaar, and some
    of the chaps chaffed him about it in the union office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taking up a collection for a joss-house down in the
    Chinamen&rsquo;s camp next,&rdquo; said Tom Hall in conclusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen the Roming Carflics,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Father O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s a very decent
    sort of cove. He stuck up for the unions all right in the strike anyway.&rdquo; (&ldquo;He
    wouldn&rsquo;t be Irish if he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; someone commented.) &ldquo;I
    carried swags once for six months with a feller that was a Carflick, an&rsquo; he
    was a very straight feller. And a girl I knowed turned Carflick to marry
    a chap that had got her into trouble, an&rsquo; she was always jes&rsquo;  the
    same to me after as she was before. Besides, I like to help everything that&rsquo;s
    goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall and one or two others went out hurriedly to have a drink. But we
    all loved the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was very innocent and very humorous, especially when he meant to be most
    serious and philosophical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of them bush girls is regular tomboys,&rdquo; he said to me
    solemnly one day. &ldquo;Some of them is too cheeky altogether. I remember
    once I was stoppin&rsquo; at a place&mdash;they was sort of relations o&rsquo; mine&mdash;an&rsquo; they
    put me to sleep in a room off the verander, where there was a glass door
    an&rsquo; no blinds. An&rsquo; the first mornin&rsquo; the girls&mdash;they
    was sort o&rsquo; cousins o&rsquo; mine&mdash;they come gigglin&rsquo; and
    foolin&rsquo; round outside the door on the verander, an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; me
    in bed till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. I had to put me trowsis on under the
    bed-clothes in the end. But I got back on &rsquo;em the next night,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you do that, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I went to bed in me trowsis!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One day I was on a plank, painting the ceiling of the bar of the Great Western
    Hotel. I was anxious to get the job finished. The work had been kept back
    most of the day by chaps handing up long beers to me, and drawing my attention
    to the alleged fact that I was putting on the paint wrong side out. I was
    slapping it on over the last few boards when:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to trouble yer; I always seem to be troublin&rsquo;  yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there woman and them girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked down&mdash;about the first time I had looked down on him&mdash;and
    there was the Giraffe, with his hat brim up on the plank and two half-crowns
    in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Bob,&rdquo; I said, and I dropped in
    half a crown.</p>
  <p>There were shearers in the bar, and presently there was some barracking.
    It appeared that that there woman and them girls were strange women, in the
    local as well as the Biblical sense of the word, who had come from Sydney
    at the end of the shearing-season, and had taken a cottage on the edge of
    the scrub on the outskirts of the town. There had been trouble this week
    in connection with a row at their establishment, and they had been fined,
    warned off by the police, and turned out by their landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a bit too red-hot, Giraffe,&rdquo; said one of the shearers.  &ldquo;Them &mdash;&mdash;s
    has made enough out of us coves. They&rsquo;ve got plenty of stuff, don&rsquo;t
    you fret. Let &rsquo;em go to &mdash;&mdash;! I&rsquo;m blanked if I give
    a sprat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t got their fares to Sydney,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo;,
    what&rsquo;s more, the little &rsquo;un is sick, an&rsquo; two of them has
    kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How the &mdash;&mdash; do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, one of &rsquo;em come to me an&rsquo; told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an involuntary guffaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Bob,&rdquo; said Billy Woods, the rouseabouts&rsquo; secretary,
    kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make a fool of yourself. You&rsquo;ll have
    all the chaps laughing at you. Those girls are only working you for all you&rsquo;re
    worth. I suppose one of  &rsquo;em came crying and whining to you. Don&rsquo;t
    you bother about &rsquo;em. You don&rsquo;t know  &rsquo;em; they can pump
    water at a moment&rsquo;s notice. You haven&rsquo;t had any experience with
    women yet, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t come whinin&rsquo; and cryin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe, dropping his twanging drawl a little. &ldquo;She looked me straight
    in the face an&rsquo;  told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, &ldquo;what have
    you been doin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;ve bin down there on the nod. I&rsquo;m surprised
    at yer, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he pretends to be so gory soft an&rsquo; innocent, too,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan. &ldquo;We know all about you, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Mitchell the shearer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it of you. We all thought you were the only virgin youth
    west the river; I always thought you were a moral young man. You mustn&rsquo;t
    think that because your conscience is pricking you everyone else&rsquo;s
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had anythin&rsquo; to do with them,&rdquo; said the
    Giraffe, drawling again. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a cove that goes in for that
    sort of thing. But other chaps has, and I think they might as well help &rsquo;em
    out of their fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a rotten crowd,&rdquo; said Billy Woods. &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t know them, Bob. Don&rsquo;t bother about them&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    not worth it. Put your money in your pocket. You&rsquo;ll find a better use
    for it before next shearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better shout, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks.</p>
  <p>Now in spite of the Giraffe&rsquo;s softness he was the hardest man in Bourke
    to move when he&rsquo;d decided on what he thought was &ldquo;the fair thing
    to do.&rdquo;  Another peculiarity of his was that on occasion, such for
    instance as &ldquo;sayin&rsquo; a few words&rdquo; at a strike meeting, he
    would straighten himself, drop the twang, and rope in his drawl, so to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    know anything about them women. I s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;re bad, but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose they&rsquo;re worse than men has made them. All I know is that there&rsquo;s
    four women turned out, without any stuff, and every woman in Bourke, an&rsquo; the
    police, an&rsquo; the law agen &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;  the fact that they is
    women is agenst &rsquo;em most of all. You don&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;em to
    hump their swags to Sydney! Why, only I ain&rsquo;t got the stuff I wouldn&rsquo;t
    trouble yer. I&rsquo;d pay their fares meself. Look,&rdquo; he said, lowering
    his voice, &ldquo;there they are now, an&rsquo; one of the girls is cryin&rsquo;.
    Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em see yer lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dropped softly from the plank and peeped out with the rest.</p>
  <p>They stood by the fence on the opposite side of the street, a bit up towards
    the railway station, with their portmanteaux and bundles at their feet. One
    girl leant with her arms on the fence rail and her face buried in them, another
    was trying to comfort her. The third girl and the woman stood facing our
    way. The woman was good-looking; she had a hard face, but it might have been
    made hard. The third girl seemed half defiant, half inclined to cry. Presently
    she went to the other side of the girl who was crying on the fence and put
    her arm round her shoulder. The woman suddenly turned her back on us and
    stood looking away over the paddocks.</p>
  <p>The hat went round. Billy Woods was first, then Box-o&rsquo;Tricks, and
    then Mitchell.</p>
  <p>Billy contributed with eloquent silence. &ldquo;I was only jokin&rsquo;,
    Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, dredging his pockets for a couple
    of shillings. It was some time after the shearing, and most of the chaps
    were hard up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; sighed Mitchell. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for
    it. If the Giraffe would take up a collection to import some decent girls
    to this God-forgotten hole there might be some sense in it. . . . It&rsquo;s
    bad enough for the Giraffe to undermine our religious prejudices, and tempt
    us to take a morbid interest in sick Chows and Afghans, and blacklegs and
    widows; but when he starts mixing us up with strange women it&rsquo;s time
    to buck.&rdquo; And he prospected his pockets and contributed two shillings,
    some odd pennies, and a pinch of tobacco dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind helping the girls, but I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll
    give a penny to help the old&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said Tom Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she was a girl once herself,&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe went round to the other pubs and to the union offices, and when
    he returned he seemed satisfied with the plate, but troubled about something
    else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do for them for to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;None
    of the pubs or boardin&rsquo;-houses will hear of them, an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t
    no empty houses, an&rsquo; the women is all agen &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Alice, the big, handsome barmaid from Sydney.  &ldquo;Come
    here, Bob.&rdquo; She gave the Giraffe half a sovereign and a look for which
    some of us would have paid him ten pounds&mdash;had we had the money, and
    had the look been transferable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bob,&rdquo; she said, and she went in to speak to
    the landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an empty bedroom at the end of the store in the yard,&rdquo;  she
    said when she came back. &ldquo;They can camp there for to-night if they
    behave themselves. You&rsquo;d better tell &rsquo;em, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer, Alice,&rdquo; said the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>Next day, after work, the Giraffe and I drifted together and down by the
    river in the cool of the evening, and sat on the edge of the steep, drought-parched
    bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you saw your lady friends off this morning, Bob,&rdquo; I
    said, and was sorry I said it, even before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they ain&rsquo;t no friends of mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only
    four poor devils of women. I thought they mightn&rsquo;t like to stand waitin&rsquo; with
    the crowd on the platform, so I jest offered to get their tickets an&rsquo; told &rsquo;em
    to wait round at the back of the station till the bell rung. . . . An&rsquo; what
    do yer think they did, Harry?&rdquo; he went on, with an exasperatingly unintelligent
    grin.  &ldquo;Why, they wanted to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; they would have done it, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t been
    so long. . . . Why, I&rsquo;m blessed if they didn&rsquo;t kiss me hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t like to go on the platform
    with them after that; besides, they was cryin&rsquo;, and I can&rsquo;t stand
    women cryin&rsquo;. But some of the chaps put them into an empty carriage.&rdquo; He
    thought a moment. Then:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers in the world,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>I thought so too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a single man. Why don&rsquo;t
    you get married and settle down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no wife an&rsquo; kids,
    that&rsquo;s a fact. But it ain&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He may have been right about the wife. But I thought of the look that Alice
    had given him, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girls seem to like me right enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it
    don&rsquo;t go no further than that. The trouble is that I&rsquo;m so long,
    and I always seem to get shook after little girls. At least there was one
    little girl in Bendigo that I was properly gone on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t she have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I asked her right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said it would be redicilus for her to be seen trotting alongside
    of a chimbley like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t mean that. There are any amount of little
    women who like tall men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought of that too&mdash;afterwards. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she didn&rsquo;t
    mean it that way. I s&rsquo;pose the fact of the matter was that she didn&rsquo;t
    cotton on to me, and wanted to let me down easy. She didn&rsquo;t want to
    hurt me feelin&rsquo;s, if yer understand&mdash;she was a very good-hearted
    little girl. There&rsquo;s some terrible tall fellers where I come from,
    and I know two as married little girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed a hopeless case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes I wish that I wasn&rsquo;t
    so blessed long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that there deaf jackeroo,&rdquo; he reflected presently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    something in the same fix about girls as I am. He&rsquo;s too deaf and I&rsquo;m
    too long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got three
    girls, to my knowledge, and, as for being deaf, why, he gasses more than
    any man in the town, and knows more of what&rsquo;s going on than old Mother
    Brindle the washerwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look at that now!&rdquo; said the Giraffe, slowly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
    have thought it? He never told me he had three girls, an&rsquo; as for hearin&rsquo; news,
    I always tell him anything that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on that I think he doesn&rsquo;t
    catch. He told me his trouble was that whenever he went out with a girl people
    could hear what they was sayin&rsquo;&mdash;at least they could hear what
    she was sayin&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; draw their own conclusions, he said.
    He said he went out one night with a girl, and some of the chaps foxed &rsquo;em
    an&rsquo; heard her sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; put
    it all round town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me that, but I s&rsquo;pose he was kissin&rsquo; her
    or huggin&rsquo; her or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you try the little
    girl in Bendigo a second time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was the use. She was a good little
    girl, and I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to go botherin&rsquo; her. I ain&rsquo;t
    the sort of cove that goes hangin&rsquo;  round where he isn&rsquo;t wanted.
    But somehow I couldn&rsquo;t stay about Bendigo after she gave me the hint,
    so I thought I&rsquo;d come over an&rsquo; have a knock round on this side
    for a year or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never wrote to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. What was the use of goin&rsquo; pesterin&rsquo; her with letters?
    I know what trouble letters give me when I have to answer one. She&rsquo;d
    have only had to tell me the straight truth in a letter an&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done me any good. But I&rsquo;ve pretty well got over it by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days later I went to Sydney. The Giraffe was the last I shook hands
    with from the carriage window, and he slipped something in a piece of newspaper
    into my hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope yer won&rsquo;t be offended,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;but
    some of the chaps thought you mightn&rsquo;t be too flush of stuff&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
    been shoutin&rsquo; a good deal; so they put a quid or two together. They
    thought it might help yer to have a bit of a fly round in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was back in Bourke before next shearing. On the evening of my arrival
    I ran against the Giraffe; he seemed strangely shaken over something, but
    he kept his hat on his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer mind takin&rsquo; a stroll as fur as the Billerbong?&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;I got something I&rsquo;d like to tell yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His big, brown, sunburnt hands trembled and shook as he took a letter from
    his pocket and opened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got a letter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A letter from
    that little girl at Bendigo. It seems it was all a mistake. I&rsquo;d like
    you to read it. Somehow I feel as if I want to talk to a feller, and I&rsquo;d
    rather talk to you than any of them other chaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a good letter, from a big-hearted little girl. She had been breaking
    her heart for the great ass all these months. It seemed that he had left
    Bendigo without saying good-bye to her. &ldquo;Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t bring
    meself to it,&rdquo; he said, when I taxed him with it. She had never been
    able to get his address until last week; then she got it from a Bourke man
    who had gone south. She called him &ldquo;an awful long fool,&rdquo; which
    he was, without the slightest doubt, and she implored him to write, and come
    back to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And will you go back, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! I&rsquo;d take the train to-morrer only I ain&rsquo;t got
    the stuff. But I&rsquo;ve got a stand in Big Billerbong Shed an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
    soon knock a few quid together. I&rsquo;ll go back as soon as ever shearin&rsquo;s
    over. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to write away to her to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was the &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; of Big Billabong Shed that season.
    His tallies averaged a hundred and twenty a day. He only sent his hat round
    once during shearing, and it was noticed that he hesitated at first and only
    contributed half a crown. But then it was a case of a man being taken from
    the shed by the police for wife desertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;Those
    soft, good-hearted fellows always end by getting hard and selfish. The world
    makes  &rsquo;em so. It&rsquo;s the thought of the soft fools they&rsquo;ve
    been that finds out sooner or later and makes &rsquo;em repent. Like as not
    the Giraffe will be the meanest man out back before he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Big Billabong cut out, and we got back to Bourke with our dusty swags
    and dirty cheques, I spoke to Tom Hall:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Tom,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That long fool, the Giraffe,
    has been breaking his heart for a little girl in Bendigo ever since he&rsquo;s
    been out back, and she&rsquo;s been breaking her heart for him, and the ass
    didn&rsquo;t know it till he got a letter from her just before Big Billabong
    started. He&rsquo;s going to-morrow morning. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>That evening Tom stole the Giraffe&rsquo;s hat. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll
    turn up in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    mind a lark,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but it does seem a bit red hot for the
    chaps to collar a cove&rsquo;s hat and a feller goin&rsquo;  away for good,
    p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell started the thing going with a quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to get rid of him. We&rsquo;ll
    have some peace now. There won&rsquo;t be so many accidents or women in trouble
    when the Giraffe and his blessed hat are gone. Anyway, he&rsquo;s an eyesore
    in the town, and he&rsquo;s getting on my nerves for one. . . . Come on,
    you sinners! Chuck &rsquo;em in; we&rsquo;re only taking quids and half-quids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>About daylight next morning Tom Hall slipped into the Giraffe&rsquo;s room
    at the Carriers&rsquo; Arms. The Giraffe was sleeping peacefully. Tom put
    the hat on a chair by his side. The collection had been a record one, and,
    besides the packet of money in the crown of the hat, there was a silver-mounted
    pipe with case&mdash;the best that could be bought in Bourke, a gold brooch,
    and several trifles&mdash;besides an ugly valentine of a long man in his
    shirt walking the room with a twin on each arm.</p>
  <p>Tom was about to shake the Giraffe by the shoulder, when he noticed a great
    foot, with about half a yard of big-boned ankle and shank, sticking out at
    the bottom of the bed. The temptation was too great. Tom took up the hair-brush,
    and, with the back of it, he gave a smart rap on the point of an in-growing
    toe-nail, and slithered.</p>
  <p>We heard the Giraffe swearing good-naturedly for a while, and then there
    was a pregnant silence. He was staring at the hat we supposed.</p>
  <p>We were all up at the station to see him off. It was rather a long wait.
    The Giraffe edged me up to the other end of the platform.</p>
  <p>He seemed overcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers
    in this world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t forgit &rsquo;em,
    Harry, when you make a big name writin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m
    blessed if I don&rsquo;t feel as if I was jist goin&rsquo; to blubber!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was glad he didn&rsquo;t. The Giraffe blubberin&rsquo; would have been
    a spectacle. I steered him back to his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me, Bob?&rdquo; said the Great Western&rsquo;s
    big, handsome barmaid, as the bell rang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind kissin&rsquo; you, Alice,&rdquo; he said,
    wiping his mouth. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be married, yer know.&rdquo; And
    he kissed her fair on the mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like gettin&rsquo; into practice,&rdquo; he
    said, grinning round.</p>
  <p>We thought he was improving wonderfully; but at the last moment something
    troubled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly, with his hand
    in his pocket, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with
    all this stuff. There&rsquo;s that there poor washerwoman that scalded her
    legs liftin&rsquo; the boiler of clothes off the fire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We shoved him into the carriage. He hung&mdash;about half of him&mdash;out
    the window, wildly waving his hat, till the train disappeared in the scrub.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And, as I sit here writing by lamplight at midday, in the midst of a great
    city of shallow social sham, of hopeless, squalid poverty, of ignorant selfishness,
    cultured or brutish, and of noble and heroic endeavour frowned down or callously
    neglected, I am almost aware of a burst of sunshine in the room, and a long
    form leaning over my chair, and:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me for troublin&rsquo; yer; I&rsquo;m always troublin&rsquo; yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there poor woman. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And I wish I could immortalize him!</p>

  <p class="note">Now I often sit at Watty&rsquo;s, when the night is very near,<br>
    With a head that&rsquo;s full of jingles&mdash;and the fumes of bottled beer;<br>
    For I always have a fancy that, if I am over there<br>
    When the Army prays for Watty, I&rsquo;m included in the prayer.<br>
    It would take a lot of praying, lots of thumping on the drum,<br>
    To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for Kingdom Come.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From - <i>When the World
  was Wide.</i></p>
  <p>The&nbsp;Salvation Army does good business in some of the outback towns
    of the great pastoral wastes of Australia. There&rsquo;s the thoughtless,
    careless generosity of the bushman, whose pockets don&rsquo;t go far enough
    down his trousers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with him), and who
    contributes to anything that comes along, without troubling to ask questions,
    like long Bob Brothers of Bourke, who, chancing to be &ldquo;a Protestant
    by rights,&rdquo; unwittingly subscribed towards the erection of a new Catholic
    church, and, being chaffed for his mistake, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;ll matter a hang in the
    end, anyway it goes. I ain&rsquo;t got nothink agenst the Roming Carflicks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the shearer, fresh with his cheque from a cut-out shed, gloriously
    drunk and happy, in love with all the world, and ready to subscribe towards
    any creed and shout for all hands&mdash;including Old Nick if he happened
    to come along. There&rsquo;s the shearer, half-drunk and inclined to be nasty,
    who has got the wrong end of all things with a tight grip, and who flings
    a shilling in the face of out-back conventionality (as he thinks) by chucking
    a bob into the Salvation Army ring. Then he glares round to see if he can
    catch anybody winking behind his back. There&rsquo;s the cynical joker, a
    queer mixture, who contributes generously and tempts the reformed boozer
    afterwards. There&rsquo;s the severe-faced old station-hand&mdash;in clean
    shirt and neckerchief and white moleskins&mdash;in for his annual or semiannual
    spree, who contributes on principle, and then drinks religiously until his
    cheque is gone and the horrors are come. There&rsquo;s the shearer, feeling
    mighty bad after a spree, and in danger of seeing things when he tries to
    go to sleep. He has dropped ten or twenty pounds over bar counters and at
    cards, and he now &ldquo;chucks&rdquo; a repentant shilling into the ring,
    with a very private and rather vague sort of feeling that something might
    come of it. There&rsquo;s the stout, contented, good-natured publican, who
    tips the Army as if it were a barrel-organ. And there are others and other
    reasons&mdash;black sheep and ne&rsquo;er-do-weels&mdash;and faint echoes
    of other times in Salvation Army tunes.</p>
  <p>Bourke, the metropolis of the Great Scrubs, on the banks of the Darling
    River, about five hundred miles from Sydney, was suffering from a long drought
    when I was there in ninety-two; and the heat may or may not have been another
    cause contributing to the success, from a business point of view, of the
    Bourke garrison. There was much beer boozing&mdash;and, besides, it was vaguely
    understood (as most things are vaguely understood out there in the drought-haze)
    that the place the Army came to save us from was hotter than Bourke. We didn&rsquo;t
    hanker to go to a hotter place than Bourke. But that year there was an extraordinary
    reason for the Army&rsquo;s great financial success there.</p>
  <p>She was a little girl, nineteen or twenty, I should judge, the prettiest
    girl I ever saw in the Army, and one of the prettiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen
    out of it. She had the features of an angel, but her expression was wonderfully
    human, sweet and sympathetic. Her big grey eyes were sad with sympathy for
    sufferers and sinners, and her poke bonnet was full of bunchy, red-gold hair.
    Her first appearance was somewhat dramatic&mdash;perhaps the Army arranged
    it so.</p>
  <p>The Army used to pray, and thump the drum, and sing, and take up collections
    every evening outside Watty Bothways&rsquo; Hotel, the Carriers&rsquo; Arms.
    They performed longer and more often outside Watty&rsquo;s than any other
    pub in town&mdash;perhaps because Watty was considered the most hopeless
    publican and his customers the hardest crowd of boozers in Bourke. The band
    generally began to play about dusk. Watty would lean back comfortably in
    a basket easy-chair on his wide veranda, and clasp his hands, in a calm,
    contented way, while the Army banged the drum and got steam up, and whilst,
    perhaps, there was a barney going on in the bar, or a bloodthirsty fight
    in the backyard. On such occasions there was something like an indulgent
    or fatherly expression on his fat and usually emotionless face. And by and
    by he&rsquo;d move his head gently and doze. The banging and the singing
    seemed to soothe him, and the praying, which was often very personal, never
    seemed to disturb him in the least.</p>
  <p>Well, it was about dusk one day; it had been a terrible day, a hundred and
    something startling in the shade, but there came a breeze after sunset. There
    had been several dozen of buckets of water thrown on the veranda floor and
    the ground outside. Watty was seated in his accustomed place when the Army
    arrived. There was no barney in the bar because there was a fight in the
    backyard, and that claimed the attention of all the customers.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed for Watty and his clients; then a reformed drunkard started
    to testify against publicans and all their works. Watty settled himself comfortably,
    folded his hands, and leaned back and dozed.</p>
  <p>The fight was over, and the chaps began to drop round to the bar. The man
    who was saved waved his arms, and danced round and howled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;The publicans, and boozers,
    and gamblers, and sinners may think that Bourke is hot, but hell is a thousand
    times hotter! I tell you &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said Mitchell, the shearer, and he threw a penny
    into the ring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es! I tell you that hell is a million times hotter than Bourke!
    I tell you &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, look here,&rdquo; said a voice from the background, &ldquo;that
    won&rsquo;t wash. Why, don&rsquo;t you know that when the Bourke people die
    they send back for their blankets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The saved brother glared round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear a freethinker speaking, my friends,&rdquo; he said. Then,
    with sudden inspiration and renewed energy, &ldquo;I hear the voice of a
    freethinker. Show me the face of a freethinker,&rdquo; he yelled, glaring
    round like a hunted, hungry man. &ldquo;Show me the face of a freethinker,
    and I&rsquo;ll tell you what he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Watty hitched himself into a more comfortable position and clasped his hands
    on his knee and closed his eyes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ya-a-a-s!&rdquo; shrieked the brand. &ldquo;I tell you, my friends,
    I can tell a freethinker by his face. Show me the face of a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point there was an interruption. One-eyed, or Wall-eyed, Bogan,
    who had a broken nose, and the best side of whose face was reckoned the ugliest
    and most sinister&mdash;One-eyed Bogan thrust his face forward from the ring
    of darkness into the torchlight of salvation. He had got the worst of a drawn
    battle; his nose and mouth were bleeding, and his good eye was damaged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at my face!&rdquo; he snarled, with dangerous earnestness. &ldquo;Look
    at my face! That&rsquo;s the face of a freethinker, and I don&rsquo;t care
    who knows it. Now! what have you got to say against my face, &lsquo;Man-without-a-Shirt?&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
  <p>The brother drew back. He had been known in the northwest in his sinful
    days as &ldquo;Man-without-a-Shirt,&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>alias</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Shirty,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
    Dirty Man,&rdquo; and was flabbergasted at being recognized in speech. Also,
    he had been in a shearing-shed and in a shanty orgie with One-eyed Bogan,
    and knew the man.</p>
  <p>Now most of the chaps respected the Army, and, indeed, anything that looked
    like religion, but the Bogan&rsquo;s face, as representing free-thought,
    was a bit too sudden for them. There were sounds on the opposite side of
    the ring as from men being smitten repeatedly and rapidly below the belt,
    and long Tom Hall and one or two others got away into the darkness in the
    background, where Tom rolled helplessly on the grass and sobbed.</p>
  <p>It struck me that Bogan&rsquo;s face was more the result of free speech
    than anything else.</p>
  <p>The Army was about to pray when the Pretty Girl stepped forward, her eyes
    shining with indignation and enthusiasm. She had arrived by the evening train,
    and had been standing shrinkingly behind an Army lass of fifty Australian
    summers, who was about six feet high, flat and broad, and had a square face,
    and a mouth like a joint in boiler plates.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl stamped her pretty foot on the gravel, and her eyes flashed
    in the torchlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Great
    big men like you to be going on the way you are. If you were ignorant or
    poor, as I&rsquo;ve seen people, there might be some excuse for you. Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any mothers, or sisters, or wives to think of? What sort of a life
    is this you lead? Drinking, and gambling, and fighting, and swearing your
    lives away! Do you ever think of God and the time when you were children?
    Why don&rsquo;t you make homes? Look at that man&rsquo;s face!&rdquo; (she
    pointed suddenly at Bogan, who collapsed and sidled behind his mates out
    of the light). &ldquo;Look at that man&rsquo;s face! Is it a face for a Christian?
    And you help and encourage him to fight. You&rsquo;re worse than he is. Oh,
    it&rsquo;s brutal. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s wicked. Great big men like
    you, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long Bob Brothers&mdash;about six-foot-four&mdash;the longest and most innocent
    there, shrunk down by the wall and got his inquiring face out of the light.
    The Pretty Girl fluttered on for a few moments longer, greatly excited, and
    then stepped back, seemingly much upset, and was taken under the wing of
    the woman with the boiler-plate mouth.</p>
  <p>It was a surprise, and very sudden. Bogan slipped round to the backyard,
    and was seen bathing his battered features at the pump. The rest wore the
    expression of men who knew that something unusual has happened, but don&rsquo;t
    know what, and are waiting vacantly for developments.&mdash;Except Tom Hall,
    who had recovered and returned. He stood looking over the head of the ring
    of bushmen, and apparently taking the same critical interest in the girl
    as he would in a fight&mdash;his expression was such as a journalist might
    wear who is getting exciting copy.</p>
  <p>The Army had it all their own way for the rest of the evening, and made
    a good collection. The Pretty Girl stood smiling round with shining eyes
    as the bobs and tanners dropped in, and then, being shoved forward by the
    flat woman, she thanked us sweetly, and said we were good fellows, and that
    she was sorry for some things she&rsquo;d said to us. Then she retired, fluttering
    and very much flushed, and hid herself behind the hard woman&mdash;who, by
    the way, had an excrescence on her upper lip which might have stood for a
    rivet.</p>
  <p>Presently the Pretty Girl came from behind the big woman and stood watching
    things with glistening eyes. Some of the chaps on the opposite side of the
    ring moved a little to one side and all were careful not to meet her eye&mdash;not
    to be caught looking at her&mdash;lest she should be embarrassed. Watty had
    roused himself a little at the sound of a strange voice in the Army (and
    such a clear, sweet voice too!) and had a look; then he settled back peacefully
    again, but it was noticed that he didn&rsquo;t snore that evening.</p>
  <p>And when the Army prayed, the Pretty Girl knelt down with the rest on the
    gravel. One or two tall bushmen bowed their heads as if they had to, and
    One-eyed Bogan, with the blood washed from his face, stood with his hat off,
    glaring round to see if he could catch anyone sniggering.</p>
  <p>Mitchell, the shearer, said afterwards that the whole business made him
    feel for the moment like he felt sometimes in the days when he used to feel
    things.</p>
  <p>The town discussed the Pretty Girl in the Army that night and for many days
    thereafter, but no one could find out who she was or where she belonged to&mdash;except
    that she came from Sydney last. She kept her secret, if she had one, very
    close&mdash;or else the other S.-A. women were not to be pumped. She lived
    in skillion-rooms at the back of the big weather-board Salvation Army barracks
    with two other &ldquo;lassies,&rdquo; who did washing and sewing and nursing,
    and went shabby, and half starved themselves, and were baked in the heat,
    like scores of women in the bush, and even as hundreds of women, suffering
    from religious mania, slave and stint in city slums, and neglect their homes,
    husbands and children&mdash;for the glory of Booth.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was referred to as Sister Hannah by the Army people, and
    came somehow to be known by sinners as &ldquo;Miss Captain.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    know whether that was her real name or what rank she held in the Army, if
    indeed she held any.</p>
  <p>She sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>, and the circulation doubled in a day. One-eyed
    Bogan, being bailed up unexpectedly, gave her &ldquo;half a caser&rdquo; for
    a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>, and ran away without the paper or the change. Jack Mitchell
    bought a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;for the first time in his life, and read it.
    He said he found some of the articles intensely realistic, and many of the
    statements were very interesting. He said he read one or two things in the&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;that
    he didn&rsquo;t know before. Tom Hall, taken unawares, bought three&nbsp;<i>Crys</i>&nbsp;from
    the Pretty Girl, and blushed to find it fame.</p>
  <p>Little Billy Woods, the Labourers&rsquo; Union secretary&mdash;who had a
    poetic temperament and more than the average bushman&rsquo;s reverence for
    higher things&mdash;Little Billy Woods told me in a burst of confidence that
    he generally had two feelings, one after the other, after encountering that
    girl. One was that unfathomable far-away feeling of loneliness and longing,
    that comes at odd times to the best of married men, with the best of wives
    and children&mdash;as Billy had. The other feeling, which came later on,
    and was a reaction in fact, was the feeling of a man who thinks he&rsquo;s
    been twisted round a woman&rsquo;s little finger for the benefit of somebody
    else. Billy said that he couldn&rsquo;t help being reminded by the shy, sweet
    smile and the shy, sweet &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; of the Pretty Girl in the
    Army, of the shy, sweet smile and the shy, sweet gratitude of a Sydney private
    barmaid, who had once roped him in, in the days before he was married. Then
    he&rsquo;d reckon that the Army lassie had been sent out back to Bourke as
    a business speculation.</p>
  <p>Tom Hall was inclined to reckon so too&mdash;but that was after he&rsquo;d
    been chaffed for a month about the three&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was discussed from psychological points of view; not forgetting
    the sex problem. Donald Macdonald&mdash;shearer, union leader and labour
    delegate to other colonies on occasion&mdash;Donald Macdonald said that whenever
    he saw a circle of plain or ugly, dried-up women or girls round a shepherd,
    evangelist or a Salvation Army drum, he&rsquo;d say &ldquo;sexually starved!&rdquo;  They
    were hungry for love. Religious mania was sexual passion dammed out of its
    course. Therefore he held that morbidly religious girls were the most easily
    seduced.</p>
  <p>But this couldn&rsquo;t apply to Pretty Girl in the Army. Mitchell reckoned
    that she&rsquo;d either had a great sorrow&mdash;a lot of trouble, or a disappointment
    in love (the &ldquo;or&rdquo; is Mitchell&rsquo;s); but they couldn&rsquo;t
    see how a girl like her could possibly be disappointed in love&mdash;unless
    the chap died or got into jail for life. Donald decided that her soul had
    been starved somehow.</p>
  <p>Mitchell suggested that it might be only a craving for notoriety, the same
    thing that makes women and girls go amongst lepers, and out to the battlefield,
    and nurse ugly pieces of men back to life again; the same thing that makes
    some women and girls swear ropes round men&rsquo;s necks. The Pretty Girl
    might be the daughter of well-to-do people&mdash;even aristocrats, said Mitchell&mdash;she
    was pretty enough and spoke well enough. &ldquo;Every woman&rsquo;s a barmaid
    at heart,&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;puts it, said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>But not even one of the haggard women of Bourke ever breathed a suspicion
    of scandal against her. They said she was too good and too pretty to be where
    she was. You see it was not as in an old settled town where hags blacken
    God&rsquo;s world with their tongues. Bourke was just a little camping town
    in a big land, where free, good-hearted democratic Australians, and the best
    of black sheep from the old world were constantly passing through; where
    husband&rsquo;s were often obliged to be away from home for twelve months,
    and the storekeepers had to trust the people, and mates trusted each other,
    and the folks were broad-minded. The mind&rsquo;s eye had a wide range.</p>
  <p>After her maiden speech the Pretty Girl seldom spoke, except to return thanks
    for collections&mdash;and she never testified. She had a sweet voice and
    used to sing.</p>
  <p>Now, if I were writing pure fiction, and were not cursed with an obstinate
    inclination to write the truth, I might say that, after the advent of the
    Pretty Girl, the morals of Bourke improved suddenly and wonderfully. That
    One-eyed Bogan left off gambling and drinking and fighting and swearing,
    and put on a red coat and testified and fought the devil only; that Mitchell
    dropped his mask of cynicism; that Donald Macdonald ate no longer of the
    tree of knowledge and ceased to worry himself with psychological problems,
    and was happy; and that Tom Hall was no longer a scoffer. That no one sneaked
    round through the scrub after dusk to certain necessary establishments in
    weather-board cottages on the outskirts of the town; and that the broad-minded
    and obliging ladies thereof became Salvation Army lassies.</p>
  <p>But none of these things happened. Drunks quieted down or got out of the
    way if they could when the Pretty Girl appeared on the scene, fights and
    games of &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; were adjourned, and weak,
    ordinary language was used for the time being, and that was about all.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, most of the chaps were in love with that Pretty Girl in the
    Army&mdash;all those who didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>worship</i>&nbsp;her privately.
    Long Bob Brothers hovered round in hopes, they said, that she&rsquo;d meet
    with an accident&mdash;get run over by a horse or something&mdash;and he&rsquo;d
    have to carry her in; he scared the women at the barracks by dropping firewood
    over the fence after dark. Barcoo-Rot, the meanest man in the back country,
    was seen to drop a threepenny bit into the ring, and a rumour was industriously
    circulated (by Tom Hall) to the effect that One-eyed Bogan intended to shave
    and join the Army disguised as a lassie.</p>
  <p>Handsome Jake Boreham (<i>alias</i>&nbsp;Bore-&rsquo;em), a sentimental
    shearer from New Zealand, who had read Bret Harte, made an elaborate attempt
    for the Pretty Girl, by pretending to be going to the dogs headlong, with
    an idea of first winning her sorrowful interest and sympathy, and then making
    an apparently hard struggle to straighten up for her sake. He mated his experience
    with the cheerful and refreshing absence of reserve which was characteristic
    of him, and is of most bushmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d had a few drinks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and was having
    a spell under a gum by the river, when I saw the Pretty Girl and another
    Army woman coming down along the bank. It was a blazing hot day. I thought
    of Sandy and the Schoolmistress in Bret Harte, and I thought it would be
    a good idea to stretch out in the sun and pretend to be helpless; so I threw
    my hat on the ground and lay down, with my head in the blazing heat, in the
    most graceful position I could get at, and I tried to put a look of pained
    regret on my face, as if I was dreaming of my lost boyhood and me mother.
    I thought, perhaps, the Girl would pity me, and I felt sure she&rsquo;d stoop
    and pick up my hat and put it gently over my poor troubled head. Then I was
    going to become conscious for a moment, and look hopelessly round, and into
    her eyes, and then start and look sorrowful and ashamed, and stagger to my
    feet, taking off my hat like the Silver King does to the audience when he
    makes his first appearance drunk on the stage; and then I was going to reel
    off, trying to walk as straight as I could. And next day I was going to clean
    up my teeth and nails and put on a white shirt, and start to be a new man
    henceforth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I lay there with my eyes shut, I heard the footsteps come
    up and stop, and heard &rsquo;em whisper, and I thought I heard the Pretty
    Girl say  &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; or something that sounded like that;
    and just then I got a God-almighty poke in the ribs with an umbrella&mdash;at
    least I suppose it was aimed for my ribs; but women are bad shots, and the
    point of the umbrella caught me in the side, just between the bottom rib
    and the hip-bone, and I sat up with a click, like the blade of a pocketknife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The other lassie was the big square-faced woman. The Pretty Girl
    looked rather more frightened and disgusted than sentimental, but she had
    plenty of pluck, and soon pulled herself together. She said I ought to be
    ashamed of myself, a great big man like me, lying there in the dust like
    a drunken tramp&mdash;an eyesore and a disgrace to all the world. She told
    me to go to my camp, wherever that was, and sleep myself sober. The square-jawed
    woman said I looked like a fool sitting there. I did feel ashamed, and I
    reckon I did look like a fool&mdash;a man generally does in a fix like that.
    I felt like one, anyway. I got up and walked away, and it hurt me so much
    that I went over to West Bourke and went to the dogs properly for a fortnight,
    and lost twenty quid on a game of draughts against a blindfold player. Now
    both those women had umbrellas, but I&rsquo;m not sure to this day which
    of &rsquo;em it was that gave me the poke. It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered
    much anyway. I haven&rsquo;t borrowed one of Bret Harte&rsquo;s books since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jake reflected a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it was,&rdquo; he said ruefully, &ldquo;that I wasn&rsquo;t
    sure that the girl or the woman didn&rsquo;t see through me, and that worried
    me a bit. You never can tell how much a woman suspects, and that&rsquo;s
    the worst of &rsquo;em. I found that out after I got married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl in the Army grew pale and thin and bigger-eyed. The women
    said it was a shame, and that she ought to be sent home to her friends, wherever
    they were. She was laid up for two or three days, and some of the women cooked
    delicacies and handed &rsquo;em over the barracks fence, and offered to come
    in and nurse her; but the square woman took washing home and nursed the girl
    herself.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl still sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>&nbsp;and took up collections,
    but in a tired, listless, half shamed-faced way. It was plain that she was
    tired of the Army, and growing ashamed of the Salvationists. Perhaps she
    had come to see things too plainly.</p>
  <p>You see, the Army does no good out back in Australia&mdash;except from a
    business point of view. It is simply there to collect funds for hungry headquarters.
    The bushmen are much too intelligent for the Army. There was no poverty in
    Bourke&mdash;as it is understood in the city; there was plenty of food; and
    camping out and roughing it come natural to the bushmen. In cases of sickness,
    accident, widows or orphans, the chaps sent round the hat, without banging
    a drum or testifying, and that was all right. If a chap was hard up he borrowed
    a couple of quid from his mate. If a strange family arrived without a penny,
    someone had to fix &rsquo;em up, and the storekeepers helped them till the
    man got work. For the rest, we work out our own salvation, or damnation&mdash;as
    the case is&mdash;in the bush, with no one to help us, except a mate, perhaps.
    The Army can&rsquo;t help us, but a fellow-sinner can, sometimes, who has
    been through it all himself. The Army is only a drag on the progress of Democracy,
    because it attracts many who would otherwise be aggressive Democrats&mdash;and
    for other reasons.</p>
  <p>Besides, if we all reformed the Army would get deuced little from us for
    its city mission.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl went to service for a while with the stock inspector&rsquo;s
    wife, who could get nothing out of her concerning herself or her friends.
    She still slept at the barracks, stuck to the Army, and attended its meetings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was Christmas morning, and there was peace in Bourke and goodwill towards
    all men. There hadn&rsquo;t been a fight since yesterday evening, and that
    had only been a friendly one, to settle an argument concerning the past ownership,
    and, at the same time, to decide as to the future possession of a dog.</p>
  <p>It had been a hot, close night, and it ended in a suffocating sunrise. The
    free portion of the male population were in the habit of taking their blankets
    and sleeping out in &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; or town square, in hot weather;
    the wives and daughters of the town slept, or tried to sleep, with bedroom
    windows and doors open, while husbands lay outside on the verandas. I camped
    in a corner of the park that night, and the sun woke me.</p>
  <p>As I sat up I caught sight of a swagman coming along the white, dusty road
    from the direction of the bridge, where the cleared road ran across west
    and on, a hundred and thirty miles, through the barren, broiling mulga scrubs,
    to Hungerford, on the border of Sheol. I knew that swagman&rsquo;s walk.
    It was John Merrick (Jack Moonlight), one-time Shearers&rsquo; Union secretary
    at Coonamble, and generally &ldquo;Rep&rdquo; (shearers&rsquo; representative)
    in any shed where he sheared. He was a &ldquo;better-class shearer,&rdquo; one
    of those quiet, thoughtful men of whom there are generally two or three in
    the roughest of rough sheds, who have great influence, and give the shed
    a good name from a Union point of view. Not quiet with the resentful or snobbish
    reserve of the educated Englishman, but with a sad or subdued sort of quietness
    that has force in it&mdash;as if they fully realized that their intelligence
    is much higher than the average, that they have suffered more real trouble
    and heartbreak than the majority of their mates, and that their mates couldn&rsquo;t
    possibly understand them if they spoke as they felt and couldn&rsquo;t see
    things as they do&mdash;yet men who understand and are intensely sympathetic
    in their loneliness and sensitive reserve.</p>
  <p>I had worked in a shed with Jack Moonlight, and had met him in Sydney, and
    to be mates with a bushman for a few weeks is to know him well&mdash;anyway,
    I found it so. He had taken a trip to Sydney the Christmas before last, and
    when he came back there was something wanting. He became more silent, he
    drank more, and sometimes alone, and took to smoking heavily. He dropped
    his mates, took little or no interest in Union matters, and travelled alone,
    and at night.</p>
  <p>The Australian bushman is born with a mate who sticks to him through life&mdash;like
    a mole. They may be hundreds of miles apart sometimes, and separated for
    years, yet they are mates for life. A bushman may have many mates in his
    roving, but there is always one&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;mate, &ldquo;my mate;&rdquo;  and
    it is common to hear a bushman, who is, in every way, a true mate to the
    man he happens to be travelling with, speak of&nbsp;<i>his mate&rsquo;s mate</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
    mate&rdquo;&mdash;who might be in Klondyke or South Africa. A bushman has
    always a mate to comfort him and argue with him, and work and tramp and drink
    with him, and lend him quids when he&rsquo;s hard up, and call him a b&mdash;&mdash; fool,
    and fight him sometimes; to abuse him to his face and defend his name behind
    his back; to bear false witness and perjure his soul for his sake; to lie
    to the girl for him if he&rsquo;s single, and to his wife if he&rsquo;s married;
    to secure a &ldquo;pen&rdquo; for him at a shed where he isn&rsquo;t on the
    spot, or, if the mate is away in New Zealand or South Africa, to write and
    tell him if it&rsquo;s any good coming over this way. And each would take
    the word of the other against all the world, and each believes that the other
    is the straightest chap that ever lived&mdash;&ldquo;a white man!&rdquo; And
    next best to your old mate is the man you&rsquo;re tramping, riding, working,
    or drinking with.</p>
  <p>About the first thing the cook asks you when you come along to a shearers&rsquo; hut
    is, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo; I travelled alone for a while
    one time, and it seemed to me sometimes, by the tone of the inquiry concerning
    the whereabouts of my mate, that the bush had an idea that I might have done
    away with him and that the thing ought to be looked into.</p>
  <p>When a man drops mateship altogether and takes to &ldquo;hatting&rdquo; in
    the bush, it&rsquo;s a step towards a convenient tree and a couple of saddle-straps
    buckled together.</p>
  <p>I had an idea that I, in a measure, took the place of Jack Moonlight&rsquo;s
    mate about this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jack!&rdquo; I hailed as he reached the corner of the
    park.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Harry!&rdquo; said Jack, as if he&rsquo;d seen me last
    yesterday evening instead of three months ago. &ldquo;How are you getting
    on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We walked together towards the Union Office, where I had a camp in the skillion-room
    at the back. Jack was silent. But there&rsquo;s no place in the world where
    a man&rsquo;s silence is respected so much (within reasonable bounds) as
    in the Australian bush, where every man has a past more or less sad, and
    every man a ghost&mdash;perhaps from other lands that we know nothing of,
    and speaking in a foreign tongue. They say in the bush, &ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s
    only thinking! &ldquo; And they let him think. Generally you want to think
    as much as your mate; and when you&rsquo;ve been together some time it&rsquo;s
    quite natural to travel all day without exchanging a word. In the morning
    Jim says, &ldquo;Well, I think I made a bargain with that horse, Bill,&rdquo; and
    some time late in the afternoon, say twenty miles farther on, it occurs to
    Bill to &ldquo;rejoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I reckon the blank as sold it
    to you had yer proper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I like a good thinking mate, and I believe that thinking in company is a
    lot more healthy and more comfortable, as well as less risky, than thinking
    alone.</p>
  <p>On the way to the Union Office Jack and I passed the Royal Hotel, and caught
    a glimpse, through the open door, of a bed room off the veranda, of the landlord&rsquo;s
    fresh, fair, young Sydney girl-wife, sleeping prettily behind the mosquito-net,
    like a sleeping beauty, while the boss lay on a mattress outside on the veranda,
    across the open door. (He wasn&rsquo;t necessary for publication, but an
    evidence of good faith.)</p>
  <p>I glanced at Jack for a grin, but didn&rsquo;t get one. He wore the pained
    expression of a man who is suddenly hit hard with the thought of something
    that might have been.</p>
  <p>I boiled the billy and fried a pound of steak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been travelling all night, Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I camped at Emus yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t eat. I began to reckon that he was brooding too much for
    his health. He was much thinner than when I saw him last, and pretty haggard,
    and he had something of the hopeless, haggard look that I&rsquo;d seen in
    Tom Hall&rsquo;s eyes after the last big shearing strike, when Tom had worked
    day and night to hold his mates up all through the hard, bitter struggle,
    and the battle was lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack!&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s up, Harry,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;What made you
    think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got yourself into any fix?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    the Hungerford track been doing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. How are you?&rdquo; And
    he pulled some string and papers and a roll of dusty pound notes from his
    pocket and threw them on the bunk.</p>
  <p>I was hard up just then, so I took a note and the billy to go to the Royal
    and get some beer. I thought the beer might loosen his mind a bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take a couple of quid,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You look as
    if you want some new shirts and things.&rdquo; But a pound was enough for
    me, and I think he had reason to be glad of that later on, as it turned out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything new in Bourke?&rdquo; asked Jack as we drank the beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not a thing&mdash;except there&rsquo;s
    a pretty girl in the Salvation Army.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s about time,&rdquo; growled Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Jack,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
    come over you lately at all? I might be able to help you. It&rsquo;s not
    a bit of use telling me that there&rsquo;s nothing the matter. When a man
    takes to brooding and travelling alone it&rsquo;s a bad sign, and it will
    end in a leaning tree and a bit of clothes-line as likely as not. Tell me
    what the trouble is. Tell us all about it. There&rsquo;s a ghost, isn&rsquo;t
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got
    our ghosts for that matter. But never you mind, Harry; I&rsquo;m all right.
    I don&rsquo;t go interfering with your ghosts, and I don&rsquo;t see what
    call you&rsquo;ve got to come haunting mine. Why, it&rsquo;s as bad as kicking
    a man&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo; And he gave the ghost of a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Jack,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is it a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a woman. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it a girl?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>So there was no more to be said. I&rsquo;d thought it might have been a
    lot worse than a girl. I&rsquo;d thought he might have got married somewhere,
    sometime, and made a mess of it.</p>
  <p>We had dinner at Billy Woods&rsquo;s place, and a sensible Christmas dinner
    it was&mdash;everything cold, except the vegetables, with the hose going
    on the veranda in spite of the by-laws, and Billy&rsquo;s wife and her sister,
    fresh and cool-looking and jolly, instead of being hot and brown and cross
    like most Australian women who roast themselves over a blazing fire in a
    hot kitchen on a broiling day, all the morning, to cook scalding plum pudding
    and redhot roasts, for no other reason than that their grandmothers used
    to cook hot Christmas dinners in England.</p>
  <p>And in the afternoon we went for a row on the river, pulling easily up the
    anabranch and floating down with the stream under the shade of the river
    timber&mdash;instead of going to sleep and waking up helpless and soaked
    in perspiration, to find the women with headaches, as many do on Christmas
    Day in Australia.</p>
  <p>Mrs Woods tried to draw Jack out, but it was no use, and in the evening
    he commenced drinking, and that made Billy uneasy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
    Jack&rsquo;s on the wrong track,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>After tea most of us collected about Watty&rsquo;s veranda. Most things
    that happened in Bourke happened at Watty&rsquo;s pub, or near it.</p>
  <p>If a horse bolted with a buggy or cart, he was generally stopped outside
    Watty&rsquo;s, which seemed to suggest, as Mitchell said, that most of the
    heroes drank at Watty&rsquo;s&mdash;also that the pluckiest men were found
    amongst the hardest drinkers. (But sometimes the horse fetched up against
    Watty&rsquo;s sign and lamppost&mdash;which was a stout one of &ldquo;iron-bark&rdquo;&mdash;and
    smashed the trap.) Then Watty&rsquo;s was the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, a union
    pub; and Australian teamsters are mostly hard cases: while there was something
    in Watty&rsquo;s beer which made men argue fluently, and the best fights
    came off in his backyard. Watty&rsquo;s dogs were the most quarrelsome in
    town, and there was a dog-fight there every other evening, followed as often
    as not by a man-fight. If a bushman&rsquo;s horse ran away with him the chances
    were that he&rsquo;d be thrown on to Watty&rsquo;s veranda, if he wasn&rsquo;t
    pitched into the bar; and victims of accidents, and sick, hard-up shearers,
    were generally carried to Watty&rsquo;s pub, as being the most convenient
    and comfortable for them. Mitchell denied that it was generosity or good
    nature on Watty&rsquo;s part, he said it was all business&mdash;advertisement.
    Watty knew what he was doing. He was very deep, was Watty. Mitchell further
    hinted that if&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;was sick he wouldn&rsquo;t be carried
    to Watty&rsquo;s, for Watty knew what a thirsty business a funeral was. Tom
    Hall reckoned that Watty bribed the Army on the quiet.</p>
  <p>I was sitting on a stool along the veranda wall with Donald Macdonald, Bob
    Brothers (the Giraffe) and Mitchell, and one or two others, and Jack Moonlight
    sat on the floor with his back to the wall and his hat well down over his
    eyes. The Army came along at the usual time, but we didn&rsquo;t see the
    Pretty Girl at first&mdash;she was a bit late. Mitchell said he liked to
    be at Watty&rsquo;s when the Army prayed and the Pretty Girl was there; he
    had no objection to being prayed for by a girl like that, though he reckoned
    that nothing short of a real angel could save him now. He said his old grandmother
    used to pray for him every night of her life and three times on Sunday, with
    Christmas Day extra when Christmas Day didn&rsquo;t fall on a Sunday; but
    Mitchell reckoned that the old lady couldn&rsquo;t have had much influence
    because he became more sinful every year, and went deeper in ways of darkness,
    until finally he embarked on a career of crime.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed, and then a thin &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; little woman bobbed
    up in the ring; she&rsquo;d gone mad on religion as women do on woman&rsquo;s
    rights and hundreds of other things. She was so skinny in the face, her jaws
    so prominent, and her mouth so wide, that when she opened it to speak it
    was like a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy and you could almost see the cracks
    open down under her ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m cracked!&rdquo; she screamed in a shrill, cracked
    voice.  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not cracked&mdash;I&rsquo;m only cracked on
    the Lord Jesus Christ! That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m cracked on.&rdquo; And
    just then the Amen man of the Army&mdash;the Army groaner we called him,
    who was always putting both feet in it&mdash;just then he blundered forward,
    rolled up his eyes, threw his hands up and down as if he were bouncing two
    balls, and said, with deep feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord she&rsquo;s got a crack in the right place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall doubled up, and most of the other sinners seemed to think there
    was something very funny about it. And the Army, too, seemed struck with
    an idea that there was something wrong somewhere, for they started a hymn.</p>
  <p>A big American negro, who&rsquo;d been a night watchman in Sydney, stepped
    into the ring and waved his arms and kept time, and as he got excited he
    moved his hands up and down rapidly, as if he was hauling down a rope in
    a great hurry through a pulley block above, and he kept saying, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord!&rdquo; all through the hymn, like a bass accompaniment, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord!&rdquo; and
    the quicker he said it the faster he hauled. He was as good as a drum. And,
    when the hymn was over, he started to testify.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My frens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was once black as der coals in
    der mined! I was once black as der ink in der ocean of sin! But now&mdash;thank
    an&rsquo; bless the Lord!&mdash;I am whiter dan der dribben snow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall sat down on the edge of the veranda and leaned his head against
    a post and cried. He had contributed a bob this evening, and he was getting
    his money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
  <p>Then the Pretty Girl arrived and was pushed forward into the ring. She looked
    thinner and whiter than I&rsquo;d ever seen her, and there was a feverish
    brightness in her eyes that I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is Christmas Day.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
    hear any more for, at the sound of her voice, Jack Moonlight jumped up as
    if he&rsquo;d sat on a baby. He started forward, stared at her for a moment
    as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes, and then said, &ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; short
    and sharp. She started as if she was shot, gave him a wild look, and stumbled
    forward; the next moment he had her in his arms and was steering for the
    private parlour.</p>
  <p>I heard Mrs Bothways calling for water and smelling-salts; she was as fat
    as Watty, and very much like him in the face, but she was emotional and sympathetic.
    Then presently I heard, through the open window, the Pretty Girl say to Jack, &ldquo;Oh,
    Jack, Jack! Why did you go away and leave me like that? It was cruel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you told me to go, Hannah,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t make any difference. Why didn&rsquo;t
    you write?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you never wrote to me, Hannah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that was no excuse!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was so
    k-k-k-cruel of you, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Bothways pulled down the window. A new-comer asked Watty what the trouble
    was, and he said that the Army girl had only found her chap, or husband,
    or long-lost brother or something, but the missus was looking after the business;
    then he dozed again.</p>
  <p>And then we adjourned to the Royal and took the Army with us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; said Donald Macdonald. &ldquo;With
    a woman it&rsquo;s love or religion; with a man it&rsquo;s love or the devil. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or with a man,&rdquo; said Mitchell, presently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    love and the devil both, sometimes, Donald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked at Mitchell hard, but for all his face expressed he might only
    have said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="LordDouglas"></a>&ldquo;Lord Douglas&rdquo;</b></h2>

  <p>The&nbsp;Imperial Hotel was rather an unfortunate name for an out-back town
    pub, for out back is the stronghold of Australian democracy; it was the out-back
    vote and influence that brought about &ldquo;One Man One Vote,&rdquo; &ldquo;Payment
    of Members,&rdquo; and most of the democratic legislation of late years,
    and from out back came the overwhelming vote in favour of Australian as Imperial
    Federation.</p>
  <p>The name Royal Hotel is as familiar as that of the Railway Hotel, and passes
    unnoticed and ungrowled at, even by bush republicans. The Royal Hotel at
    Bourke was kept by an Irishman, one O&rsquo;Donohoo, who was Union to the
    backbone, loudly in favour of &ldquo;Australia for the Australians,&rdquo; and,
    of course, against even the democratic New South Wales Government of the
    time. He went round town all one St Patrick&rsquo;s morning with a bunch
    of green ribbon fastened to his coat-tail with a large fish-hook, and wasn&rsquo;t
    aware of the fact till he sat down on the point of it. But that&rsquo;s got
    nothing to do with it.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel at Bourke was unpopular from the first. It was said that
    the very existence of the house was the result of a swindle. It had been
    built with money borrowed on certain allotments in the centre of the town
    and on the understanding that it should be built on the mortgaged land, whereas
    it was erected on a free allotment. Which fact was discovered, greatly to
    its surprise, by the building society when it came to foreclose on the allotments
    some years later. While the building was being erected the Bourke people
    understood, in a vague way, that it was to be a convent (perhaps the building
    society thought so, too), and when certain ornaments in brick and cement
    in the shape of a bishop&rsquo;s mitre were placed over the corners of the
    walls the question seemed decided. But when the place was finished a bar
    was fitted up, and up went the sign, to the disgust of the other publicans,
    who didn&rsquo;t know a licence had been taken out&mdash;for licensing didn&rsquo;t
    go by local option in those days. It was rumoured that the place belonged
    to, and the whole business was engineered by, a priest. And priests are men
    of the world.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel was patronized by the pastoralists, the civil servants,
    the bank manager and clerks&mdash;all the scrub aristocracy; it was the headquarters
    of the Pastoralists&rsquo; Union in Bourke; a barracks for blacklegs brought
    up from Sydney to take the place of Union shearers on strike; and the new
    Governor, on his inevitable visit to Bourke, was banqueted at the Imperial
    Hotel. The editor of the local &ldquo;capitalistic rag&rdquo; stayed there;
    the pastoralists&rsquo; member was elected mostly by dark ways and means
    devised at the Imperial Hotel, and one of its managers had stood as a dummy
    candidate to split the Labour vote; the management of the hotel was his reward.
    In short, it was there that most of the plots were hatched to circumvent
    Freedom, and put away or deliver into the clutches of law and order certain
    sons of Light and Liberty who believed in converting blacklegs into jellies
    by force of fists when bribes, gentle persuasion and pure Australian language
    failed to convert them to clean Unionism. The Imperial Hotel was called the &ldquo;Squatters&rsquo; Pub,&rdquo; the  &ldquo;Scabbery,&rdquo; and
    other and more expressive names.</p>
  <p>The hotel became still more unpopular after Percy Douglas had managed it
    for a while. He was an avowed enemy of Labour Unionists. He employed Chinese
    cooks, and that in the height of the anti-Chinese agitation in Australia,
    and he was known to have kindly feelings towards the Afghans who, with their
    camels, were running white carriers off the roads. If an excited Unionist
    called a man a &ldquo;blackleg&rdquo; or &ldquo;scab&rdquo; in the Imperial
    bar he was run out&mdash;sometimes with great difficulty, and occasionally
    as far as the lock-up.</p>
  <p>Percy Douglas was a fine-looking man, &ldquo;wid a chest on him an&rsquo; well
    hung&mdash;a fine fee-<i>gure</i>&nbsp;of a man,&rdquo; as O&rsquo;Donohoo
    pronounced it. He was tall and erect, he dressed well, wore small side-whiskers,
    had an eagle nose, and looked like an aristocrat. Like many of his type,
    who start sometimes as billiard-markers and suddenly become hotel managers
    in Australia, nothing was known of his past. Jack Mitchell reckoned, by the
    way he treated his employees and spoke to workmen, that he was the educated
    son of an English farmer&mdash;gone wrong and sent out to Australia. Someone
    called him &ldquo;Lord Douglas,&rdquo; and the nickname caught on.</p>
  <p>He made himself well hated. He got One-eyed Bogan &ldquo;three months&rsquo;  hard&rdquo; for
    taking a bottle of whisky off the Imperial bar counter because he (Bogan)
    was drunk and thirsty and had knocked down his cheque, and because there
    was no one minding the bar at the moment.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas dismissed the barmaid, and, as she was leaving, he had her
    boxes searched and gave her in charge for stealing certain articles belonging
    to the hotel. The chaps subscribed to defend the case, and subsequently put
    a few pounds together for the girl. She proved her gratitude by bringing
    a charge of a baby against one of the chaps&mdash;but that was only one of
    the little ways of the world, as Mitchell said. She joined a Chinese camp
    later on.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas employed a carpenter to do some work about the hotel, and because
    the carpenter left before the job was finished, Lord Douglas locked his tools
    in an outhouse and refused to give them up; and when the carpenter, with
    the spirit of an Australian workman, broke the padlock and removed his tool-chest,
    the landlord gave him in charge for breaking and entering. The chaps defended
    the case and won it, and hated Lord Douglas as much as if he were their elder
    brother. Mitchell was the only one to put in a word for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling it out,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as he sat
    nursing his best leg in the Union Office, &ldquo;and, as far as I can see,
    it all amounts to this&mdash;we&rsquo;re all mistaken in Lord Douglas. We
    don&rsquo;t know the man. He&rsquo;s all right. We don&rsquo;t understand
    him. He&rsquo;s really a sensitive, good-hearted man who&rsquo;s been shoved
    a bit off the track by the world. It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s fault&mdash;he&rsquo;s
    not to blame. You see, when he was a youngster he was the most good-natured
    kid in the school; he was always soft, and, consequently, he was always being
    imposed upon, and bullied, and knocked about. Whenever he got a penny to
    buy lollies he&rsquo;d count &rsquo;em out carefully and divide &rsquo;em
    round amongst his schoolmates and brothers and sisters. He was the only one
    that worked at home, and consequently they all hated him. His father respected
    him, but didn&rsquo;t love him, because he wasn&rsquo;t a younger son, and
    wasn&rsquo;t bringing his father&rsquo;s grey hairs down in sorrow to the
    grave. If it was in Australia, probably Lord Douglas was an elder son and
    had to do all the hard graft, and teach himself at night, and sleep in a
    bark skillion while his younger brothers benefited&mdash;they were born in
    the new brick house and went to boarding-schools. His mother had a contempt
    for him because he wasn&rsquo;t a black sheep and a prodigal, and, when the
    old man died, the rest of the family got all the stuff and Lord Douglas was
    kicked out because they could do without him now. And the family hated him
    like poison ever afterwards (especially his mother), and spread lies about
    him&mdash;because they had treated him shamefully and because his mouth was
    shut&mdash;they knew he wouldn&rsquo;t speak. Then probably he went in for
    Democracy and worked for Freedom, till Freedom trod on him once too often
    with her hob-nailed boots. Then the chances are, in the end, he was ruined
    by a girl or woman, and driven, against his will, to take refuge in pure
    individualism. He&rsquo;s all right, only we don&rsquo;t appreciate him.
    He&rsquo;s only fighting against his old ideals&mdash;his old self that comes
    up sometimes&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what makes him sweat his barmaids and
    servants, and hate us, and run us in; and perhaps when he cuts up extra rough
    it&rsquo;s because his conscience kicks him when he thinks of the damned
    soft fool he used to be. He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;take my word for it.
    It&rsquo;s all a mask. Why, he might be one of the kindest-hearted men in
    Bourke underneath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall rubbed his head and blinked, as if he was worried by an idea that
    there might be some facts in Mitchell&rsquo;s theories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re allers findin&rsquo; excuses for blacklegs an&rsquo; scabs,
    Mitchell,&rdquo;  said Barcoo-Rot, who took Mitchell seriously (and who would
    have taken a laughing jackass seriously). &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;d find a
    white spot on a squatter. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you blacklegged
    yourself in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was an unpardonable insult, from a Union point of view, and the chaps
    half-unconsciously made room on the floor for Barcoo-Rot to fall after Jack
    Mitchell hit him. But Mitchell took the insult philosophically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Barcoo-Rot,&rdquo; he said, nursing the other leg, &ldquo;for
    the matter of that, I did find a white spot on a squatter once. He lent me
    a quid when I was hard up. There&rsquo;s white spots on the blackest characters
    if you only drop prejudice and look close enough. I suppose even Jack-the-Ripper&rsquo;s
    character was speckled. Why, I can even see spots on your character, some
    times, Barcoo-Rot. I&rsquo;ve known white spots to spread on chaps&rsquo; characters
    until they were little short of saints. Sometimes I even fancy I can feel
    my own wings sprouting. And as for turning blackleg&mdash;well, I suppose
    I&rsquo;ve got a bit of the crawler in my composition (most of us have),
    and a man never knows what might happen to his principles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot, &ldquo;I beg yer pardon&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
    that enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you ought to wear a three-bushel
    bag and ashes for three months, and drink water; but since the police would
    send you to an asylum if you did that, I think the best thing we can do is
    to go out and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas married an Australian girl somewhere, somehow, and brought
    her to Bourke, and there were two little girls&mdash;regular little fairies.
    She was a gentle, kind-hearted little woman, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to
    improve him much, save that he was very good to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;When
    a boss gets married and has children he thinks he&rsquo;s got a greater right
    to grind his fellowmen and rob their wives and children. I&rsquo;d never
    work for a boss with a big family&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard enough to keep a
    single boss nowadays in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After one stormy election, at the end of a long and bitter shearing strike,
    One-eyed Bogan, his trusty enemy, Barcoo-Rot, and one or two other enthusiastic
    reformers were charged with rioting, and got from one to three months&rsquo; hard.
    And they had only smashed three windows of the Imperial Hotel and chased
    the Chinese cook into the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to have some hopes for Democracy,&rdquo; commented Mitchell,  &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;ve got none now. How can you expect Liberty, Equality or Fraternity&mdash;how
    can you expect Freedom and Universal Brotherhood and Equal Rights in a country
    where Sons of Light get three months&rsquo; hard for breaking windows and
    bashing a Chinaman? It almost makes me long to sail away in a gallant barque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were other cases in connection with the rotten-egging of Capitalistic
    candidates on the Imperial Hotel balcony, and it was partly on the evidence
    of Douglas and his friends that certain respectable Labour leaders got heavy
    terms of imprisonment for rioting and &ldquo;sedition&rdquo; and &ldquo;inciting,&rdquo; in
    connection with organized attacks on blacklegs and their escorts.</p>
  <p>Retribution, if it was retribution, came suddenly and in a most unexpected
    manner to Lord Douglas.</p>
  <p>It seems he employed a second carpenter for six months to repair and make
    certain additions to the hotel, and put him off under various pretences until
    he owed him a hundred pounds or thereabout. At last, immediately after an
    exciting interview with Lord Douglas, the carpenter died suddenly of heart
    disease. The widow, a strong-minded bushwoman, put a bailiff in the hotel
    on a very short notice&mdash;and against the advice of her lawyer, who thought
    the case hopeless&mdash;and the Lord Douglas bubble promptly burst. He had
    somehow come to be regarded as the proprietor of the hotel, but now the real
    proprietors or proprietor&mdash;he was still said to be a priest&mdash;turned
    Douglas out and put in a new manager. The old servants were paid after some
    trouble. The local storekeepers and one or two firms in Sydney, who had large
    accounts against the Imperial Hotel (and had trusted it, mainly because it
    was patronized by Capitalism and Fat), were never paid.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas cleared out to Sydney, leaving his wife and children, for the
    present, with her brother, a hay-and-corn storekeeper, who also had a large
    and hopeless account against the hotel; and when the brother went broke and
    left the district she rented a two-roomed cottage and took in dressmaking.</p>
  <p>Dressmaking didn&rsquo;t pay so well in the bush then as it did in the old
    diggings days when sewing-machines were scarce and the possession of one
    meant an independent living to any girl&mdash;when diggers paid ten shillings
    for a strip of &ldquo;flannen&rdquo; doubled over and sewn together, with
    holes for arms and head, and called a shirt. Mrs Douglas had a hard time,
    with her two little girls, who were still better and more prettily dressed
    than any other children in Bourke. One grocer still called on her for orders
    and pretended to be satisfied to wait &ldquo;till Mr Douglas came back,&rdquo; and
    when she would no longer order what he considered sufficient provisions for
    her and the children, and commenced buying sugar, etc., by the pound, for
    cash, he one day sent a box of groceries round to her. He pretended it was
    a mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very much obliged if
    you could use  &rsquo;em, Mrs Douglas. I&rsquo;m overstocked now; haven&rsquo;t
    got room for another tin of sardines in the shop. Don&rsquo;t you worry about
    bills, Mrs Douglas; I can wait till Douglas comes home. I did well enough
    out of the Imperial Hotel when your husband had it, and a pound&rsquo;s worth
    of groceries won&rsquo;t hurt me now. I&rsquo;m only too glad to get rid
    of some of the stock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She cried a little, thought of the children, and kept the groceries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll be sold up soon meself if things don&rsquo;t
    git brighter,&rdquo; said that grocer to a friend, &ldquo;so it doesn&rsquo;t
    matter much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The same with Foley the butcher, who had a brogue with a sort of drawling
    groan in it, and was a cynic of the Mitchell school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s as proud as the devil,
    but when I send round a bit o&rsquo; rawst, or porrk, or the undercut o&rsquo; the
    blade-bawn, she thinks o&rsquo; the little gur-r-rls before she thinks o&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; it
    back to me. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the pull on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe borrowed a horse and tip-dray one day at the beginning of winter
    and cut a load of firewood in the bush, and next morning, at daylight, Mrs
    Douglas was nearly startled out of her life by a crash at the end of the
    cottage, which made her think that the chimney had fallen in, or a tree fallen
    on the house; and when she slipped on a wrapper and looked out, she saw a
    load of short-cut wood by the chimney, and caught a glimpse of the back view
    of the Giraffe, who stood in the dray with his legs wide apart and was disappearing
    into the edge of the scrub; and soon the rapid clock-clock-clock of the wheels
    died away in the west, as if he were making for West Australia.</p>
  <p>The next we heard of Lord Douglas he had got two years&rsquo; hard for embezzlement
    in connection with some canvassing he had taken up. Mrs Douglas fell ill&mdash;a
    touch of brain-fever&mdash;and one of the labourers&rsquo; wives took care
    of the children while two others took turns in nursing. While she was recovering,
    Bob Brothers sent round the hat, and, after a conclave in the Union Office&mdash;as
    mysterious as any meeting ever called with the object of downing bloated
    Capitalism&mdash;it was discovered that one of the chaps&mdash;who didn&rsquo;t
    wish his name to be mentioned&mdash;had borrowed just twenty-five pounds
    from Lord Douglas in the old days and now wished to return it to Mrs Douglas.
    So the thing was managed, and if she had any suspicions she kept them to
    herself. She started a little fancy goods shop and got along fairly comfortable.</p>
  <p>Douglas, by the way, was, publicly, supposed, for her sake and because of
    the little girls, to be away in West Australia on the goldfields.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Time passes without much notice out back, and one hot day, when the sun
    hung behind the fierce sandstorms from the northwest as dully lurid as he
    ever showed in a London fog, Lord Douglas got out of the train that had just
    finished its five-hundred-miles&rsquo; run, and not seeing a new-chum porter,
    who started forward by force of habit to take his bag, he walked stiffly
    off the platform and down the main street towards his wife&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>He was very gaunt, and his eyes, to those who passed him closely, seemed
    to have a furtive, hunted expression. He had let his beard grow, and it had
    grown grey.</p>
  <p>It was within a few days of Christmas&mdash;the same Christmas that we lost
    the Pretty Girl in the Salvation Army. As a rule the big shearing-sheds within
    a fortnight of Bourke cut out in time for the shearers to reach the town
    and have their Christmas dinners and sprees&mdash;and for some of them to
    be locked up over Christmas Day&mdash;within sound of a church-going bell.
    Most of the chaps gathered in the Shearers&rsquo; Union Office on New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve and discussed Douglas amongst other things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vote we kick the cow out of the town!&rdquo; snarled One-eyed Bogan,
    viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Bob Brothers (the Giraffe), speaking
    more promptly than usual. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s his wife and youngsters to
    consider, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He something well deserted his wife,&rdquo; snarled Bogan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; now
    he comes crawlin&rsquo; back to her to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, mildly, &ldquo;but we ain&rsquo;t all
    got as much against him as you have, Bogan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made a crimson jail-bird of me!&rdquo; snapped Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t hurt you much,
    anyway; it rather improved your character if anything. Besides, he made a
    jail-bird of himself afterwards, so you ought to have a fellow-feeling&mdash;a
    feathered feeling, so to speak. Now you needn&rsquo;t be offended, Bogan,
    we&rsquo;re all jail-birds at heart, only we haven&rsquo;t all got the pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favour of blanky well tarrin&rsquo; an&rsquo; featherin&rsquo; him
    an&rsquo;  kickin&rsquo; him out of the town!&rdquo; shouted Bogan. &ldquo;It
    would be a good turn to his wife, too; she&rsquo;d be well rid of the &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s fond of him,&rdquo; suggested Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    known such cases before. I saw them sitting together on the veranda last
    night when they thought no one was looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He deserted her,&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan, in a climbingdown tone,  &ldquo;and
    left her to starve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps the police were to blame for that,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You
    know you deserted all your old mates once for three months, Bogan, and it
    wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seems to be a crimson pet of yours, Jack Mitchell,&rdquo; said
    Bogan, firing up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, all I know,&rdquo; said Mitchell, standing up and stretching
    himself wearily, &ldquo;all I know is that he looked like a gentleman once,
    and treated us like a gentleman, and cheated us like a gentleman, and ran
    some of us in like a gentleman, and, as far as I can see, he&rsquo;s served
    his time like a gentleman and come back to face us and live himself down
    like a man. I always had a sneaking regard for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mitchell, I&rsquo;m beginning to think you are a gentleman yourself,&rdquo; said
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I used to have a suspicion once
    that I had a drop of blue blood in me somewhere, and it worried me a lot;
    but I asked my old mother about it one day, and she scalded me&mdash;God
    bless her!&mdash;and father chased me with a stockwhip, so I gave up making
    inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll join the bloomin&rsquo; Capitalists next,&rdquo; sneered
    Oneeyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could, Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take
    a trip to Paris and see for myself whether the Frenchwomen are as bad as
    they&rsquo;re made out to be, or go to Japan. But what are we going to do
    about Douglas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kick the skunk out of town, or boycott him!&rdquo; said one or two. &ldquo;He
    ought to be tarred and feathered and hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do worse than hang him,&rdquo; commented Jake Boreham,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we could,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sitting down, resting his
    elbows on his knees, and marking his points with one forefinger on the other.  &ldquo;For
    instance, we might boil him slow in tar. We might skin him alive. We might
    put him in a cage and poke him with sticks, with his wife and children in
    another cage to look on and enjoy the fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps, who had been sitting quietly listening to Mitchell, and grinning,
    suddenly became serious and shifted their positions uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can tell you what would hurt his feelings more than anything
    else we could do,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Jack?&rdquo; said Tom Hall, rather impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send round the hat and take up a collection for him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;enough to let him get away with his wife and children and
    start life again in some less respectable town than Bourke. You needn&rsquo;t
    grin, I&rsquo;m serious about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a thoughtful pause, and one or two scratched their heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His wife seems pretty sick,&rdquo; Mitchell went on in a reflective
    tone. &ldquo;I passed the place this morning and saw him scrubbing out the
    floor. He&rsquo;s been doing a bit of house-painting for old Heegard to-day.
    I suppose he learnt it in jail. I saw him at work and touched my hat to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Tom Hall, affecting to shrink from Mitchell in
    horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I didn&rsquo;t
    take my hat off. Now I know it&rsquo;s not bush religion for a man to touch
    his hat, except to a funeral, or a strange roof or woman sometimes; but when
    I meet a braver man than myself I salute him. I&rsquo;ve only met two in
    my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who were they, Jack?&rdquo; asked Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;one is Douglas, and the other&mdash;well,
    the other was the man I used to be. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps Douglas thought you were crowing over him when you took
    off your hat to him&mdash;sneerin&rsquo; at him, like, Mitchell,&rdquo; reflected
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Jake,&rdquo; said Mitchell, growing serious suddenly. &ldquo;There
    are ways of doing things that another man understands. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>They all thought for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;supposing we do take up a collection
    for him, he&rsquo;d be too damned proud to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve got the pull on him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, brightening up. &ldquo;I heard Dr Morgan say that Mrs Douglas wouldn&rsquo;t
    live if she wasn&rsquo;t sent away to a cooler place, and Douglas knows it;
    and, besides, one of the little girls is sick. We&rsquo;ve got him in a corner
    and he&rsquo;ll have to take the stuff. Besides, two years in jail takes
    a lot of the pride out of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll give a sprat to help the man
    who tried his best to crush the Unions!&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damned if I will either!&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, One-eyed Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    like to harp on old things, for I know they bore you, but when you returned
    to public life that time no one talked of kicking you out of the town. In
    fact, I heard that the chaps put a few pounds together to help you get away
    for a while till you got over your modesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I passed Douglas&rsquo;s place on my way here from my camp to-night,&rdquo;  Mitchell
    went on musingly, &ldquo;and I saw him walking up and down in the yard with
    his sick child in his arms. You remember that little girl, Bogan? I saw her
    run and pick up your hat and give it to you one day when you were trying
    to put it on with your feet. You remember, Bogan? The shock nearly sobered
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a very awkward pause. The position had become too psychological
    altogether and had to be ended somehow. The awkward silence had to be broken,
    and Bogan broke it.</p>
  <p>He turned up Bob Brothers&rsquo;s hat, which was lying on the table, and  &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; in
    a &ldquo;quid,&rdquo; qualifying the hat and the quid, and disguising his
    feelings with the national oath of the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough of this gory, maudlin, sentimental tommy-rot,&rdquo;  he
    said. &ldquo;Here, Barcoo, stump up or I&rsquo;ll belt it out of your hide!
    I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take yer to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Douglas didn&rsquo;t leave the town. He sent his wife and children to
    Sydney until the heat wave was past, built a new room on to the cottage,
    and started a book and newspaper shop, and a poultry farm in the back paddock,
    and flourished.</p>
  <p>They called him Mr Douglas for a while, then Douglas, then Percy Douglas,
    and now he is well-known as Old Daddy Douglas, and the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Worker</i>,&nbsp;<i>Truth</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>, and other democratic rags are on sale at his shop.
    He is big with schemes for locking the Darling River, and he gets his drink
    at O&rsquo;Donohoo&rsquo;s. He is scarcely yet regarded as a straight-out
    democrat. He was a gentleman once, Mitchell said, and the old blood was not
    to be trusted. But, last elections, Douglas worked quietly for Unionism,
    and gave the leaders certain hints, and put them up to various electioneering
    dodges which enabled them to return, in the face of Monopoly, a Labour member
    who is as likely to go straight as long as any other Labour member.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBlindnessofOneEyedBogan"></a>The Blindness
      of One-Eyed Bogan</b></h2>
  <p class="note">They judge not and they are not judged&mdash;&rsquo;tis their
    philosophy&mdash;<br>
    (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea).<br>
  &mdash;<i>The Ballad of the Rouseabout</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;what became of One-eyed Bogan?&rdquo; I asked Tom Hall when
    I met him and Jack Mitchell down in Sydney with their shearing cheques the
    Christmas before last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask Mitchell, Harry,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He
    can tell you about Bogan better than I can. But first, what about the drink
    we&rsquo;re going to have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We turned out of Pitt Street into Hunter Street, and across George Street,
    where a double line of fast electric tramway was running, into Margaret Street
    and had a drink at Pfahlert&rsquo;s Hotel, where a counter lunch&mdash;as
    good as many dinners you get for a shilling&mdash;was included with a sixpenny
    drink. &ldquo;Get a quiet corner,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I like to
    hear myself cackle.&rdquo; So we took our beer out in the fernery and got
    a cool place at a little table in a quiet corner amongst the fern boxes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, One-eyed Bogan was a hard case, Mitchell,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
    he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, putting down his &ldquo;long-beer&rdquo; glass, &ldquo;he
    was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather a bad egg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a regular bad egg,&rdquo; said Mitchell, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard he got caught cheating at cards,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you!&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Well, I believe he did. Ah,
    well,&rdquo; he added reflectively, after another long pull, &ldquo;One-eyed
    Bogan won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is he dead then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how did that happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lost the other eye,&rdquo; said Mitchell, and he took another
    drink.  &ldquo;Ah, well, he won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more&mdash;unless
    there&rsquo;s cards invented for the blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you see, Harry, it was this way.
    Bogan went pretty free in Bourke after the shearing before last, and in the
    end he got mixed up in a very ugly-looking business: he was accused of doing
    two new-chum jackeroos out of their stuff by some sort of confidence trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confidence trick,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought
    that One-eyed Bogan had the brains to go in for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems he had, or else he used somebody else&rsquo;s brains;
    there&rsquo;s plenty of broken-down English gentlemen sharpers knocking about
    out back, you know, and Bogan might have been taking lessons from one. I
    don&rsquo;t know the rights of the case, it was hushed up, as you&rsquo;ll
    see presently; but, anyway, the jackeroos swore that Bogan had done &rsquo;em
    out of ten quid. They were both Cockneys and I suppose they reckoned themselves
    smart, but bushmen have more time to think. Besides, Bogan&rsquo;s one eye
    was in his favour. You see he always kept his one eye fixed strictly on whatever
    business he had in hand; if he&rsquo;d had another eye to rove round and
    distract his attention and look at things on the outside, the chances are
    he would never have got into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Jack,&rdquo; said Tom Hall. &ldquo;Harry wants to
    hear the yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, to make it short, one of the jackeroos went to the police and
    Bogan cleared out. His character was pretty bad just then, so there was a
    piece of blue paper out for him. Bogan didn&rsquo;t seem to think the thing
    was so serious as it was, for he only went a few miles down the river and
    camped with his horses on a sort of island inside an anabranch, till the
    thing should blow over or the new chums leave Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Constable Campbell, got wind of Bogan&rsquo;s
    camp, and started out after him. He rode round the outside track and came
    in on to the river just below where the anabranch joins it, at the lower
    end of the island and right opposite Bogan&rsquo;s camp. You know what those
    billabongs are dry gullies till the river rises from the Queensland rains
    and backs them up till the water runs round into the river again and makes
    anabranches of &rsquo;em&mdash;places that you thought were hollows you&rsquo;ll
    find above water, and you can row over places you thought were hills. There&rsquo;s
    no water so treacherous and deceitful as you&rsquo;ll find in some of those
    billabongs. A man starts to ride across a place where he thinks the water
    is just over the grass, and blunders into a deep channel&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t
    there before&mdash;with a steady undercurrent with the whole weight of the
    Darling River funnelled into it; and if he can&rsquo;t swim and his horse
    isn&rsquo;t used to it&mdash;or sometimes if he can swim&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a case with him, and the Darling River cod hold an inquest on him, if they
    have time, before he&rsquo;s burried deep in Darling River mud for ever.
    And somebody advertises in the missing column for Jack Somebody who was last
    heard of in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Mitchell, go on,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Campbell knew the river and saw that there was a stiff current
    there, so he hailed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good day, Campbell,&rsquo; shouted Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you, Bogan,&rsquo; said Campbell. &lsquo;Come across
    and bring your horses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I will,&rsquo; says Bogan. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    not going to catch me death o&rsquo; cold to save your skin. If you want
    me you&rsquo;ll have to bloody well come and git me.&rsquo; Bogan was a good
    strong swimmer, and he had good horses, but he didn&rsquo;t try to get away&mdash;I
    suppose he reckoned he&rsquo;d have to face the music one time or another&mdash;and
    one time is as good as another out back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell was no swimmer; he had no temptation to risk his life&mdash;you
    see it wasn&rsquo;t as in war with a lot of comrades watching ready to advertise
    a man as a coward for staying alive&mdash;so he argued with Bogan and tried
    to get him to listen to reason, and swore at him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make
    it damned hot for you, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I have to come over
    for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two can play at that game,&rsquo; says Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Bogan,&rdquo; said Campbell, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. If you give me your word that you&rsquo;ll come
    up to the police station to-morrow I&rsquo;ll go back and say nothing about
    it. You can say you didn&rsquo;t know a warrant was out after you. It will
    be all the better for you in the end. Better give me your word, man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Campbell knew Bogan better than any of us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool.
    Give your word like a sensible man, and I&rsquo;ll go back. I&rsquo;ll give
    you five minutes to make up your mind.&rsquo; And he took out his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Bogan was nasty and wouldn&rsquo;t give his word, so there was
    nothing for it but for Campbell to make a try for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell had plenty of pluck, or obstinacy, which amounts to the
    same thing. He put his carbine and revolver under a log, out of the rain
    that was coming on, saw to his handcuffs, and then spurred his horse into
    the water. Bogan lit his pipe with a stick from his camp-fire&mdash;so Campbell
    said afterwards&mdash;and sat down on his heels and puffed away, and waited
    for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as Campbell&rsquo;s horse floundered into the current Bogan
    shouted to go back, but Campbell thought it was a threat and kept on. But
    Bogan had caught sight of a log coming down the stream, end on, with a sharp,
    splintered end, and before Campbell knew where he was, the sharp end of the
    log caught the horse in the flank. The horse started to plunge and struggle
    sideways, with all his legs, and Campbell got free of him as quick as he
    could. Now, you know, in some of those Darling River reaches the current
    will seem to run steadily for a while, and then come with a rush. (I was
    caught in one of those rushes once, when I was in swimming, and would have
    been drowned if I hadn&rsquo;t been born to be hanged.) Well, a rush came
    along just as Campbell got free from his horse, and he went down-stream one
    side of a snag and his horse the other. Campbell&rsquo;s pretty stout, you
    know, and his uniform was tight, and it handicapped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as he was being washed past the lower end of the snag he caught
    hold of a branch that stuck out of the water and held on. He swung round
    and saw Bogan running down to the point opposite him. Now, you know there
    was always a lot of low cunning about Bogan, and I suppose he reckoned that
    if he pulled Campbell out he&rsquo;d stand a good show of getting clear of
    his trouble; anyway, if he didn&rsquo;t save Campbell it might be said that
    he killed him&mdash;besides, Bogan was a good swimmer, so there wasn&rsquo;t
    any heroism about it anyhow. Campbell was only a few feet from the bank,
    but Bogan started to strip&mdash;to make the job look as big as possible,
    I suppose. He shouted to Campbell to say he was coming, and to hold on.</p>
  <p>Campbell said afterwards that Bogan seemed an hour undressing. The weight
    of the current was forcing down the bough that Campbell was hanging on to,
    and suddenly, he said, he felt a great feeling of helplessness take him by
    the shoulders. He yelled to Bogan and let go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, it happened that Jake Boreham and I were passing away the time
    between shearings, and we were having a sort of fishing and shooting loaf
    down the river in a boat arrangement that Jake had made out of boards and
    tarred canvas. We called her the&nbsp;<i>Jolly Coffin</i>. We were just poking
    up the bank in the slack water, a few hundred yards below the billabong,
    when Jake said, &lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a horse or something in the river.&rsquo; Then
    he shouted,  &lsquo;No, by God, it&rsquo;s a man,&rsquo; and we poked the&nbsp;<i>Coffin</i>&nbsp;out
    into the stream for all she was worth. &lsquo;Looks like two men fighting
    in the water,&rsquo; Jake shouts presently. &lsquo;Hurry up, or they&rsquo;ll
    drown each other.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hailed &rsquo;em, and Bogan shouted for help. He was treading
    water and holding Campbell up in front of him now in real professional style.
    As soon as he heard us he threw up his arms and splashed a bit&mdash;I reckoned
    he was trying to put as much style as he could into that rescue. But I caught
    a crab, and, before we could get to them, they were washed past into the
    top of a tree that stood well below flood-mark. I pulled the boat&rsquo;s
    head round and let her stern down between the branches. Bogan had one arm
    over a limb and was holding Campbell with the other, and trying to lift him
    higher out of the water. I noticed Bogan&rsquo;s face was bleeding&mdash;there
    was a dead limb stuck in the tree with nasty sharp points on it, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d run his face against one of them. Campbell was gasping like a
    codfish out of water, and he was the whitest man I ever saw (except one,
    and he&rsquo;d been drowned for a week). Campbell had the sense to keep still.
    We asked Bogan if he could hold on, and he said he could, but he couldn&rsquo;t
    hold Campbell any longer. So Jake took the oars and I leaned over the stern
    and caught hold of Campbell, and Jake ran the boat into the bank, and we
    got him ashore; then we went back for Bogan and landed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had some whisky and soon brought Campbell round; but Bogan was
    bleeding like a pig from a nasty cut over his good eye, so we bound wet handkerchiefs
    round his eyes and led him to a log and he sat down for a while, holding
    his hand to his eye and groaning. He kept saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m blind,
    mates, I&rsquo;m blind! I&rsquo;ve lost me other eye!&rsquo; but we didn&rsquo;t
    dream it was so bad as that: we kept giving him whisky. We got some dry boughs
    and made a big fire. Then Bogan stood up and held his arms stiff down to
    his sides, opening and shutting his hands as if he was in great pain. And
    I&rsquo;ve often thought since what a different man Bogan seemed without
    his clothes and with the broken bridge of his nose and his eyes covered by
    the handkerchiefs. He was clean shaven, and his mouth and chin are his best
    features, and he&rsquo;s clean limbed and well hung. I often thought afterwards
    that there was something of a blind god about him as he stood there naked
    by the fire on the day he saved Campbell&rsquo;s life&mdash;something that
    reminded me of a statue I saw once in the Art Gallery. (Pity the world isn&rsquo;t
    blinder to a man&rsquo;s worst points.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presently Jake listened and said, &lsquo;By God, that&rsquo;s lucky!&rsquo; and
    we heard a steamer coming up-river and presently we saw her coming round
    the point with a couple of wool-barges in tow. We got Bogan aboard and got
    some clothes on him, and took him ashore at Bourke to the new hospital. The
    doctors did all they knew, but Bogan was blind for life. He never saw anything
    again&mdash;except &lsquo;a sort of dull white blur,&rsquo; as he called
    it&mdash;or his past life sometimes, I suppose. Perhaps he saw that for the
    first time. Ah, well!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Barcoo-Rot, went to see him in the hospital,
    and Bogan said, &lsquo;Well, Barcoo, I reckon we&rsquo;ve had our last fight.
    I owe you a hiding, but I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to pay you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never
    mind that, Bogan, old man,&rsquo; says Barcoo. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take it
    from anyone yer likes to appoint, if that worries yer; and, look here, Bogan,
    if I can&rsquo;t fight you I can fight for you&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you
    forget it!&rsquo; And Barcoo used to lead Bogan round about town in his spare
    time and tell him all that was going on; and I believe he always had an ear
    cocked in case someone said a word against Bogan&mdash;as if any of the chaps
    would say a word against a blind man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s case was hushed up. The police told us to fix it up
    the best way we could. One of the jackeroos, who reckoned that Bogan had
    swindled him, was a gentleman, and he was the first to throw a quid in the
    Giraffe&rsquo;s hat when it went round for Bogan, but the other jackeroo
    was a cur: he said he wanted the money that Bogan had robbed him of. There
    were two witnesses, but we sent &rsquo;em away, and Tom Hall, there, scared
    the jackeroo. You know Tom was always the best hand we had at persuading
    witnesses in Union cases to go home to see their mothers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you scare that jackeroo, Tom?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell you about it some other time,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;Bogan was always a good woolsorter,
    so, next shearing, old Baldy Thompson&mdash;(you know Baldy Thompson, Harry,
    of West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station)&mdash;Baldy had a talk with some of the
    chaps, and took Bogan out in his buggy with him to West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.
    Bogan would sit at the end of the rolling tables, in the shearing-shed, with
    a boy to hand him the fleeces, and he&rsquo;d feel a fleece and tell the
    boy what bin to throw it into; and by and by he began to learn to throw the
    fleeces into the bins himself. And sometimes Baldy would have a sheep brought
    to him and get him to feel the fleece and tell him the quality of it. And
    then again Baldy would talk, just loud enough for Bogan to overhear, and
    swear that he&rsquo;d sooner have Bogan, blind as he was, than half a dozen
    scientific jackeroo experts with all their eyes about them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course Bogan wasn&rsquo;t worth anything much to Baldy, but Baldy
    gave him two pounds a week out of his own pocket, and another quid that we
    made up between us; so he made enough to pull him through the rest of the
    year.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was curious to see how soon he learned to find his way about the
    hut and manage his tea and tucker. It was a rough shed, but everybody was
    eager to steer Bogan about&mdash;and, in fact, two of them had a fight about
    it one day. Baldy and all of us&mdash;and especially visitors when they came&mdash;were
    mighty interested in Bogan; and I reckon we were rather proud of having a
    blind wool-sorter. I reckon Bogan had thirty or forty pairs of eyes watching
    out for him in case he&rsquo;d run against something or fall. It irritated
    him to be messed round too much&mdash;he said a baby would never learn to
    walk if it was held all the time. He reckoned he&rsquo;d learn more in a
    year than a man who&rsquo;d served a lifetime to blindness; but we didn&rsquo;t
    let him wander much&mdash;for fear he&rsquo;d fall into the big rocky waterhole
    there, by accident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after the shearing-season Bogan&rsquo;s wife turned up in Bourke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I never knew
    Bogan was married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither did anyone else,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But he was.
    Perhaps that was what accounted for Bogan. Sometimes, in his sober moods,
    I used to have an idea that there must have been something behind the Bogan
    to account for him. Perhaps he got trapped&mdash;or got married and found
    out that he&rsquo;d made a mistake&mdash;which is about the worst thing a
    man can find out &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except that his wife made the mistake, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom
    Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or that both did,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell. &ldquo;Ah, well!&mdash;never
    mind&mdash;Bogan had been married two or three years. Maybe he got married
    when he was on the spree&mdash;I knew that he used to send money to someone
    in Sydney and I suppose it was her. Anyway, she turned up after he was blind.
    She was a hard-looking woman&mdash;just the sort that might have kept a third-rate
    pub or a sly-grog shop. But you can&rsquo;t judge between husband and wife,
    unless you&rsquo;ve lived in the same house with them&mdash;and under the
    same roofs with their parents right back to Adam for that matter. Anyway,
    she stuck to Bogan all right; she took a little two-roomed cottage and made
    him comfortable&mdash;she&rsquo;s got a sewing-machine and a mangle and takes
    in washing and sewing. She brought a carrotty-headed youngster with her,
    and the first time I saw Bogan sitting on the veranda with that youngster
    on his knee I thought it was a good thing that he was blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the youngster isn&rsquo;t his,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the look of it&mdash;and by the look on her face, once, when she
    caught me squinting from the kid&rsquo;s face to Bogan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And whose was it!&rdquo; I asked, without thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How am I to know?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It might be yours
    for all I know&mdash;it&rsquo;s ugly enough, and you never had any taste
    in women. But you mustn&rsquo;t speak of that in Bourke. But there&rsquo;s
    another youngster coming, and I&rsquo;ll swear that&rsquo;ll be Bogan&rsquo;s
    all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A curious thing about Bogan is that he&rsquo;s begun to be fidgety
    about his personal appearance&mdash;and you know he wasn&rsquo;t a dood.
    He wears a collar now, and polishes his boots; he wears elasticsides, and
    polishes &rsquo;em himself&mdash;the only thing is that he blackens over
    the elastic. He can do many things for himself, and he&rsquo;s proud of it.
    He says he can see many things that he couldn&rsquo;t see when he had his
    eyes. You seldom hear him swear, save in a friendly way; he seems much gentler,
    but he reckons he would stand a show with Barcoo-Rot even now, if Barcoo
    would stand up in front of him and keep yelling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;how did Bogan lose the sight of
    his other eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping out in the rain when he was drunk,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;He
    got a cold in his eye.&rdquo; Then he asked, suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a blind man cry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You know Bogan wears goggles
    to hide his eyes&mdash;his wife made him do that. The chaps often used to
    drop round and have a yarn with Bogan and cheer him up, and one evening I
    was sitting smoking with him, and yarning about old times, when he got very
    quiet all of a sudden, and I saw a tear drop from under one of his shutters
    and roll down his cheek. It wasn&rsquo;t the eye he lost saving Campbell&mdash;it
    was the old wall-eye he used to use in the days before he was called &lsquo;One-eyed
    Bogan.&rsquo; I suppose he thought it was dark and that I couldn&rsquo;t
    see his face. (There&rsquo;s a good many people in this world who think you
    can&rsquo;t see because they can&rsquo;t.) It made me feel like I used to
    feel sometimes in the days when I felt things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had
    enough beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Besides, I promised
    to send a wire to Jake Boreham to tell him that his mother&rsquo;s dead.
    Jake&rsquo;s shearing at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday; shearing won&rsquo;t be over
    for three or four weeks, and Jake wants an excuse to get away without offending
    old Baldy and come down and have a fly round with us before the holidays
    are over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down at the telegraph-office Mitchell took a form and filled it in very
    carefully:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Jacob Boreham. West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station. Bourke. <br>
    Come home at once. Mother is dead. In terrible trouble. Father dying.<br>
  &mdash;MARY&nbsp;BOREHAM.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that will do,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It ought to satisfy
    Baldy, and it won&rsquo;t give Jake too much of a shock, because he hasn&rsquo;t
    got a sister or sister-in-law, and his father and mother&rsquo;s been dead
    over ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, if I was running a theatre,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as we left
    the office, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give five pounds a night for the face Jake&rsquo;ll
    have on him when he takes that telegram to Baldy Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoSundowners"></a>Two Sundowners</b></h2>
  <p>Sheep&nbsp;stations in Australia are any distance from twenty to a hundred
    miles apart, to keep well within the boundaries of truth and the great pastoral
    country. Shearing at any one shed only lasts a few weeks in the year; the
    number of men employed is according to the size of the shed&mdash;from three
    to five men in the little bough-covered shed of the small &ldquo;cockatoo,&rdquo; up
    to a hundred and fifty or two hundred hands all told in the big corrugated
    iron machine shed of a pastoral company.</p>
  <p>Shearing starts early up in northern Queensland, where you can get a &ldquo;January
    shed;&rdquo; and further south, in February, March or April sheds, and so
    on down into New South Wales, where shearing often lasts over Christmas.
    Shearers travel from shed to shed; some go a travel season without getting
    a pen, and an unlucky shearer might ride or tramp for several seasons and
    never get hands in wool; and all this explains the existence of the &ldquo;footman&rdquo; with
    his swag and the horseman with his packhorse. They have a rough life, and
    the Australian shearers are certainly the most democratic and perhaps the
    most independent, intelligent and generous body of workmen in the world.</p>
  <p>Shearers at a shed elect their own cook, pay him so much a head, and they
    buy their rations in the lump from the station store; and  &ldquo;travellers,&rdquo; i.e.
    shearers and rouseabouts travelling for work, are invited, as a matter of
    course, to sit down to the shearers&rsquo; table. Also a certain allowance
    of tea, sugar, flour or meat is still made to travellers at most Western
    station stores; so it would be rather surprising if there weren&rsquo;t some
    who travelled on the game. The swagman loafer, or &ldquo;bummer,&rdquo; times
    himself, especially in bad weather, to arrive at the shed just about sundown;
    he is then sure of &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; shelter for the night, breakfast, and
    some tucker from the cook to take him on along the track. Brummy and Swampy
    were sundowners.</p>
  <p>Swampy was a bummer born&mdash;and proud of it. Brummy had drifted down
    to loaferdom, and his nature was soured and his spirit revengeful against
    the world because of the memory of early years wasted at hard work and in
    being honest. Both were short and stout, and both had scrubby beards, but
    Brummy&rsquo;s beard was a dusty black and Swampy&rsquo;s fiery red&mdash;he
    indulged in a monkey-shave sometimes, but his lower face was mostly like
    a patch of coarse stubble with a dying hedge round it. They had travelled
    together for a long time. They seemed at times to hate each other with a
    murderous hatred, but they were too lazy to fight. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    tramp side by side and growl at each other by the hour, other times they&rsquo;d
    sulk for days; one would push on ahead and the other drop behind until there
    was a mile or two between them; but one always carried the billy, or the
    sugar, or something that was necessary to the comfort of the other, so they&rsquo;d
    come together at sundown. They had travelled together a long time, and perhaps
    that was why they hated each other. They often agreed to part and take different
    tracks, and sometimes they parted&mdash;for a while. They agreed in cadging,
    and cadged in turn. They carried a spare set of tucker-bags, and if, for
    instance, they were out of sugar and had plenty flour and tea, Brummy or
    Swampy would go to the store, boundary-rider&rsquo;s hut, or selector&rsquo;s,
    with the sugar-bag in his hand and the other bags in his shirt front on spec.
    He&rsquo;d get the sugar first, and then, if it looked good enough, the flour-bag
    would come out, then the tea-bag. And before he left he&rsquo;d remark casually
    that he and his mate hadn&rsquo;t had a smoke for two days. They never missed
    a chance. And when they&rsquo;d cadged more tucker than they could comfortably
    carry, they&rsquo;d camp for a day or two and eat it down. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    have as much as a pound of tobacco, all in little &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; bits,
    cut from the sticks or cakes of honest travellers. They never missed a chance.
    If a stranger gave Swampy his cake of tobacco with instructions to &ldquo;cut
    off a pipeful,&rdquo; Swampy would cut off as much as he thought judicious,
    talking to the stranger and watching his eye all the time, and hiding his
    palm as much as possible&mdash;and sometimes, when he knew he&rsquo;d cut
    off more than he could cram into his pipe, he&rsquo;d put his hand in his
    pocket for the pipe and drop some of the tobacco there. Then he&rsquo;d hand
    the plug to his mate, engage the stranger in conversation and try to hold
    his eye or detract his attention from Brummy so as to give Brummy a chance
    of cutting off a couple of pipefuls, and, maybe, nicking off a corner of
    the cake and slipping it into his pocket. I once heard a bushman say that
    no one but a skunk would be guilty of this tobacco trick&mdash;that it is
    about the meanest trick a man could be capable of&mdash;<i>because it spoils
    the chances of the next hard-up swaggy who asks the victim for tobacco</i>.</p>
  <p>When Brummy and Swampy came to a shed where shearing was in full swing,
    they&rsquo;d inquire, first thing, and with some show of anxiety, if there
    was any chance of gettin&rsquo; on; if the shed was full-handed they&rsquo;d
    growl about hard times, wonder what the country was coming to; talk of their
    missuses and kids that they&rsquo;d left in Sydney, curse the squatters and
    the Government, and, next morning, get a supply of rations from the cook
    and depart with looks of gloom. If, on the other hand, there was room in
    the shed for one or both of them, and the boss told them to go to work in
    the morning, they&rsquo;d keep it quiet from the cook if possible, and depart,
    after breakfast, unostentatiously.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, at the beginning of a drought, when the tall dead grass was like
    tinder for hundreds of miles and a carelessly-dropped match would set the
    whole country on fire, Swampy would strike a hard-faced squatter, manager
    or overseer with a cold eye, and the conversation would be somewhat as follows</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Good day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (shortly): &ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Any chance of a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Got all I want and we don&rsquo;t start for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Can I git a bit o&rsquo; meat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw! Don&rsquo;t kill till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Pint o&rsquo; flour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; tea or sugar, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw&mdash;what next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; baccer, boss. Ain&rsquo;t had a smoke for a
    week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Ain&rsquo;t got enough for meself till the wagon comes
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s hot, ain&rsquo;t it, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Country very dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes. Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;A fire &rsquo;ud be very bad just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now I&rsquo;m allers very careful with matches an&rsquo; fire
    when I&rsquo;m on the track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. I never lights a fire near the grass&mdash;allers in
    the middle of the track&mdash;it&rsquo;s the safest place yer can get. An&rsquo; I
    allers puts the fire out afore I leaves the camp. If there ain&rsquo;t no
    water ter spare I covers the ashes with dirt. An&rsquo; some fellers are
    so careless with matches lightin&rsquo;  their pipes.&rdquo; (Reflective
    pause.)</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now, when I lights me pipe on the track in dry weather
    I allers rubs the match head up an&rsquo; drops it in the dust. I never drops
    a burnin&rsquo; match. But some travellers is so careless. A chap might light
    his pipe an&rsquo; fling the match away without thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the
    match might fall in a dry tuft, an&rsquo;&mdash;there yer are!&rdquo; (with
    a wave of his arms). &ldquo;Hundreds of miles o&rsquo;  grass gone an&rsquo; thousands
    o&rsquo; sheep starvin&rsquo;. Some fellers is so careless&mdash;they never
    thinks. . . . An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, they don&rsquo;t care if they
    burn the whole country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (scratching his head reflectively): &ldquo;Ah&mdash;umph!&mdash;You
    can go up to the store and get a bit of tucker. The storekeeper might let
    yer have a bit o&rsquo; tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On one occasion, when they were out of flour and meat; Brummy and Swampy
    came across two other pilgrims camped on a creek, who were also out of flour
    and meat. One of them had tried a surveyors&rsquo; camp a little further
    down, but without success. The surveyors&rsquo; cook had said that he was
    short of flour and meat himself. Brummy tried him&mdash;no luck. Then Swampy
    said&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;go and have a try. As luck would have it,
    the surveyors&rsquo; cook was just going to bake; he had got the flour out
    in the dish, put in the salt and baking powder, mixed it up, and had gone
    to the creek for a billy of water when Swampy arrived. While the cook was
    gone Swampy slipped the flour out of the dish into his bag,&nbsp;<i>wiped</i>&nbsp;the
    dish, set it down again, and planted the bag behind a tree at a little distance.
    Then he stood waiting, holding a spare empty bag in his hand. When the cook
    came back he glanced at the dish, lowered the billy of water slowly to the
    ground, scratched his head, and looked at the dish again in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanked if I didn&rsquo;t think I got that flour out!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, mate?&rdquo; asked Swampy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! I could have sworn I got the flour out in the dish and mixed
    it before I went for the water,&rdquo; said the cook, staring at the dish
    again.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rum what tricks your memory plays on you sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Swampy, showing interest, while the cook got some
    more flour out into the dish from a bag in the back of the tent. &ldquo;It
    is strange. I&rsquo;ve done the same thing meself. I suppose it&rsquo;s the
    heat that makes us all a bit off at times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you cook, then?&rdquo; asked the surveyors&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. I&rsquo;ve done a good bit of it in me time; but it&rsquo;s
    about played out. I&rsquo;m after stragglers now.&rdquo; (Stragglers are
    stray sheep missed in the general muster and found about the out paddocks
    and shorn after the general shearing.)</p>
  <p>They had a yarn and Swampy &ldquo;bit the cook&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; for a &ldquo;bit
    o&rsquo; meat an&rsquo; tea an&rsquo; sugar,&rdquo; not forgetting &ldquo;a
    handful of flour if yer can spare it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said the cook, &ldquo;but I can only let you have about
    a pint. We&rsquo;re very short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Swampy, as he put the stuff
    into his spare bags. &ldquo;Thank you! Good day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the cook.</p>
  <p>The cook went on with his work and Swampy departed, catching up the bag
    of flour from behind the tree as he passed it, and keeping the clump of timber
    well between him and the surveyors&rsquo; camp, lest the cook should glance
    round, and, noticing the increased bulk of his load, get some new ideas concerning
    mental aberration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Nearly every bushman has at least one superstition, or notion, that lasts
    his time&mdash;as nearly every bushman has at least one dictionary word which
    lasts him all his life. Brummy had a gloomy notion&mdash;Lord knows how he
    got it!&mdash;that he should &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone on the boards if his people
    hadn&rsquo;t been so ignorant. He reckoned that he had the face and cut of
    an actor, could mimic any man&rsquo;s voice, and had wonderful control over
    his features. They came to a notoriously &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; station, where
    there was a Scottish manager and storekeeper. Brummy went up to &ldquo;government
    house&rdquo; in his own proper person, had a talk with the storekeeper, spoke
    of a sick mate, and got some flour and meat. They camped down the creek,
    and next morning Brummy started to shave himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever are you a-doin&rsquo; of, Brummy?&rdquo; gasped Swampy in
    great astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; growled Brummy, with awful impressiveness, as
    if he were going to cut Swampy&rsquo;s throat after he&rsquo;d finished shaving.
    He shaved off his beard and whiskers, put on a hat and coat belonging to
    Swampy, changed his voice, dropped his shoulders, and went limping up to
    the station on a game leg. He saw the cook and got some &ldquo;brownie,&rdquo; a
    bit of cooked meat and a packet of baking powder. Then he saw the storekeeper
    and approached the tobacco question. Sandy looked at him and listened with
    some slight show of interest, then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s all right now! But ye needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; troublt
    shavin&rsquo; yer beard&mdash;the cold weather&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on! An&rsquo; yer
    mate&rsquo;s duds don&rsquo;t suit ye&mdash;they&rsquo;re too sma&rsquo;;
    an&rsquo; yer game leg doesn&rsquo;t fit ye either&mdash;it takes a lot o&rsquo; practice.
    Ha&rsquo; ye got ony tea an&rsquo; sugar? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy must have touched something responsive in that old Scot somewhere,
    but his lack of emotion upset Brummy somewhat, or else an old deep-rooted
    superstition had been severely shaken. Anyway he let Swampy do the cadging
    for several days thereafter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But one bad season they were very hard up indeed&mdash;even for Brummy and
    Swampy. They&rsquo;d tramped a long hungry track, and had only met a few
    wretched jackeroos, driven out of the cities by hard times, and tramping
    hopelessly west. They were out of tobacco, and their trousers were so hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  behind
    that when they went to cadge at a place where there was a woman they were
    moved to back and sidle and edge away again&mdash;and neither Brummy nor
    Swampy was over fastidious in matters of dress or personal appearance. It
    was absolutely necessary to earn a pound or two, so they decided to go to
    work for a couple of weeks. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them, and then there was
    the novelty of it.</p>
  <p>They struck West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, and the boss happened to want
    a rouseabout to pick up wool and sweep the floor for the shearers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can put&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;of you on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fix
    it up between yourselves and go to work in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy and Swampy went apart to talk it over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here! Brum, old man,&rdquo; said Swampy, with great heartiness,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    been mates for a long while now, an&rsquo; shared an&rsquo; shared alike.
    You&rsquo;ve allers acted straight to me an&rsquo; I want to do the fair
    thing by you.&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t want to stand in&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;light.
    You take the job an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be satisfied with a pair of pants out
    of it and a bit o&rsquo; tobacco now an&rsquo; agen. There yer are! I can&rsquo;t
    say no fairer than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brummy, resentfully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
    always be throwin&rsquo; it up to me afterwards that I done you out of a
    job!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Swampy, hurriedly. &ldquo;But
    since you&rsquo;re so blasted touchy and suspicious about it,&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;take
    this job an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll take the next that turns up. How&rsquo;ll
    that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy thought resentfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s settle it
    and have done with this damned sentimental tommy-rot. I&rsquo;ll tell you
    what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you the job and take my chance.
    The boss might want another man to-morrow. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Swampy didn&rsquo;t look grateful or happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled Brummy, &ldquo;of all the &mdash;&mdash; I ever
    travelled with you&rsquo;re the &mdash;&mdash;. What do you want anyway?
    What&rsquo;ll satisfy you? That&rsquo;s all I want to know. Hey?&mdash;can&rsquo;t
    yer speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s toss up for it,&rdquo; said Swampy, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Brummy, with a big oath, and he felt in his
    pocket for two old pennies he had. But Swampy had got a suspicion somehow
    that one of those pennies had two heads on it, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure that
    the other hadn&rsquo;t two tails&mdash;also, he suspected Brummy of some
    skill in &ldquo;palming,&rdquo; so he picked up a chip from the wood-heap,
    spat on it, and spun it into the air.  &ldquo;Sing out!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wet
    or dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dry,&rdquo; said Brummy, promptly. He had a theory that the wet side
    of the chip, being presumably heaviest, was more likely to fall downwards;
    but this time it was &ldquo;wet&rdquo; up three times in succession. Brummy
    ignored Swampy&rsquo;s hand thrown out in hearty congratulation; and next
    morning he went to work in the shed. Swampy camped down the river, and Brummy
    supplied him with a cheap pair of moleskin trousers, tucker and tobacco.
    The shed cut out within three weeks and the two sundowners took the track
    again, Brummy with two pounds odd in his pocket&mdash;he having negotiated
    his cheque at the shed.</p>
  <p>But now there was suspicion, envy, and distrust in the hearts of those two
    wayfarers. Brummy was now a bloated capitalist, and proud, and anxious to
    get rid of Swampy&mdash;at least Swampy thought so. He thought that the least
    that Brummy might have done was to have shared the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said reproachfully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    shared and shared alike, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We never shared money,&rdquo; said Brummy, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I want yer blasted money?&rdquo; retorted Swampy, indignantly. &ldquo;When
    did I ever ask yer for a sprat? Tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have got it if you had asked,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    uncompromisingly. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; with vehemence. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
    I keep yer in tobacco and buy yer gory pants? What are you naggin&rsquo; about
    anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Swampy, &ldquo;all I was goin&rsquo; to say was
    that yer might let me carry one of them quids in case you lost one&mdash;yer
    know you&rsquo;re careless and lose things; or in case anything happened
    to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to lose it&mdash;if that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s
    fretting you,&rdquo; said Brummy, &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t nothing going
    to happen to me&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks I get for givin&rsquo; yer my gory job,&rdquo; said
    Swampy, savagely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be sich a soft fool agen, I can tell
    yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy was silent, and Swampy dropped behind. He brooded darkly, and it&rsquo;s
    a bad thing for a man to brood in the bush. He was reg&rsquo;lar disgusted
    with Brummy. He&rsquo;d allers acted straight to him, and Brummy had acted
    like a  &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stand it no longer; but he&rsquo;d
    have some satisfaction. He wouldn&rsquo;t be a fool. If Brummy was mean skunk
    enough to act to a mate like that, Swampy would be even with him; he would
    wait till Brummy was asleep, collar the stuff, and clear. It was his job,
    anyway, and the money was his by rights. He&rsquo;d have his rights.</p>
  <p>Brummy, who carried the billy, gave Swampy a long tramp before he camped
    and made a fire. They had tea in silence, and smoked moodily apart until
    Brummy turned in. They usually slept on the ground, with a few leaves under
    them, or on the sand where there was any, each wrapped in his own blankets,
    and with their spare clothes, or rags rather, for pillows. Presently Swampy
    turned in and pretended to sleep, but he lay awake watching, and listening
    to Brummy&rsquo;s breathing. When he thought it was safe he moved cautiously
    and slipped his hand under Brummy&rsquo;s head, but Brummy&rsquo;s old pocket-book&mdash;in
    which he carried some dirty old letters in a woman&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;was
    not there. All next day Swampy watched Brummy sharply every time he put his
    hands into his pockets, to try and find out in which pocket he kept his money.
    Brummy seemed very cheerful and sociable, even considerate, to his mate all
    day, and Swampy pretended to be happy. They yarned more than they had done
    for many a day. Brummy was a heavy sleeper, and that night Swampy went over
    him carefully and felt all his pockets, but without success. Next day Brummy
    seemed in high spirits&mdash;they were nearing Bourke, where they intended
    to loaf round the pubs for a week or two. On the third night Swampy waited
    till about midnight, and then searched Brummy, every inch of him he could
    get at, and tickled him with a straw of grass till he turned over, and ran
    his hands over the other side of him, and over his feet (Brummy slept with
    his socks on), and looked in his boots, and in the billy and in the tucker-bags,
    and felt in every tuft of grass round the camp, and under every bush, and
    down a hollow stump, and up a hollow log: but there was no pocket-book. Brummy
    couldn&rsquo;t have lost the money and kept it dark&mdash;he&rsquo;d have
    gone back to look for it at once. Perhaps he&rsquo;d thrown away the book
    and sewn the money in his clothes somewhere. Swampy crept back to him and
    felt the lining of his hat, and was running his hand over Brummy&rsquo;s
    chest when Brummy suddenly started to snore, and Swampy desisted without
    loss of time. He crept back to bed, breathing short, and thought hard. It
    struck him that there was something aggressive about that snore. He began
    to suspect that Brummy was up to his little game, and it pained him.</p>
  <p>Next morning Brummy was decidedly frivolous. At any other time Swampy would
    have put it down to a &ldquo;touch o&rsquo; the sun,&rdquo; but now he felt
    a growing conviction that Brummy knew what he&rsquo;d been up to the last
    three nights, and the more he thought of it the more it pained him&mdash;till
    at last he could stand it no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said frankly, &ldquo;where the hell
    do you keep that flamin&rsquo; stuff o&rsquo; yourn? I been tryin&rsquo; to
    git at it ever since we left West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you have, Swampy,&rdquo; said Brummy, affectionately&mdash;as
    if he considered that Swampy had done his best in the interests of mateship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>knowed</i>&nbsp;yer knowed!&rdquo; exclaimed Swampy, triumphantly. &ldquo;But
    where the blazes did yer put it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;head, Swampy, old man,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>Swampy was hurt now. He commented in the language that used to be used by
    the bullock-punchers of the good days as they pranced up and down by their
    teams and lammed into the bullocks with saplings and crow-bars, and called
    on them to lift a heavy load out of a bog in the bed of a muddy creek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Swampy!&rdquo; said Brummy, soothingly, as his mate paused
    and tried to remember worse oaths. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they parted at Bourke. Swampy had allers acted straight ter Brummy&mdash;share &rsquo;n&rsquo; share
    alike. He&rsquo;d do as much for a mate as any other man, an&rsquo;  put
    up with as much from a mate. He had put up with a lot from Brummy: he&rsquo;d
    picked him up on the track and learned him all he knowed; Brummy&mdash;would
    have starved many a time if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Swampy; Swampy had learned
    him how to  &ldquo;battle.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stick to Brummy yet, but he
    couldn&rsquo;t stand ingratitude. He hated low cunnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; suspicion,
    and when a gory mate got suspicious of his own old mate and wouldn&rsquo;t
    trust him, an&rsquo; took to plantin&rsquo; his crimson money&mdash;it was
    time to leave him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASketchofMateship"></a>A Sketch of Mateship</b></h2>
  <p>Bill&nbsp;and Jim, professional shearers, were coming into Bourke from the
    Queensland side. They were horsemen and had two packhorses. At the last camp
    before Bourke Jim&rsquo;s packhorse got disgusted and home-sick during the
    night and started back for the place where he was foaled. Jim was little
    more than a new-chum jackeroo; he was no bushman and generally got lost when
    he went down the next gully. Bill was a bushman, so it was decided that he
    should go back to look for the horse.</p>
  <p>Now Bill was going to sell his packhorse, a well-bred mare, in Bourke, and
    he was anxious to get her into the yards before the horse sales were over;
    this was to be the last day of the sales. Jim was the best  &ldquo;barracker&rdquo; of
    the two; he had great imagination; he was a very entertaining story-teller
    and conversationalist in social life, and a glib and a most impressive liar
    in business, so it was decided that he should hurry on into Bourke with the
    mare and sell her for Bill. Seven pounds, reserve.</p>
  <p>Next day Bill turned up with the missing horse and saw Jim standing against
    a veranda-post of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, with his hat down over his eyes,
    and thoughtfully spitting in the dust. Bill rode over to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Bill. I see you got him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I got him.&rsquo;&rsquo; Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d yer find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout ten mile back. Near Ford&rsquo;s Bridge. He was just
    feedin&rsquo;  along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause. Jim shifted his feet and spat in the dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill at last. &ldquo;How did you get on, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I sold the mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;How much did she fetch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight quid;&rdquo; then, rousing himself a little and showing some
    emotion, &ldquo;An&rsquo; I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid for her if
    I hadn&rsquo;t been a dam&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s good enough,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; waited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo;. Eight quid is good enough.
    Did you get the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They parted all right. If I hadn&rsquo;t been such a dam&rsquo; fool
    an&rsquo; rushed it, there was a feller that would &rsquo;a&rsquo; given
    ten quid for that mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t break yer back about it,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Eight
    is good enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten,&rdquo; said Jim, languidly,
    putting his hand in his pocket.</p>
  <p>Pause. Bill sat waiting for him to hand over the money; but Jim withdrew
    his hand empty, stretched, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, Bill, I done it in. Lend us a couple o&rsquo; notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim had been drinking and gambling all night and he&rsquo;d lost the eight
    pounds as well as his own money.</p>
  <p>Bill didn&rsquo;t explode. What was the use? He should have known that Jim
    wasn&rsquo;t to be trusted with money in town. It was he who had been the
    fool. He sighed and lent Jim a pound, and they went in to have a drink.</p>
  <p>Now it strikes me that if this had happened in a civilized country (like
    England) Bill would have had Jim arrested and jailed for larceny as a bailee,
    or embezzlement, or whatever it was. And would Bill or Jim or the world have
    been any better for it?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OntheTuckerTrack"></a>On the Tucker Track</b><br>
      <b>A Steelman Story</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman&nbsp;and Smith, professional wanderers from New Zealand, took a
    run over to Australia one year to have a look at the country, and drifted
    out back, and played cards and &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; at the
    shearing-sheds (while pretending to be strangers to each other), and sold
    eye-water and unpatented medicine, and worked the tucker tracks. They struck
    a streak of bad luck at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, where they were advised
    (by the boss and about fifty excited shearers) to go east, and not to stop
    till they reached the coast. They were tramping along the track towards Bourke;
    they were very hard up and had to &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for tucker and tobacco
    along the track. They came to a lonely shanty, about two camps west of Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn off into the scrub and strike the track the other
    side of the shanty and come back to it,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;You
    see, if they see us coming into Bourke they&rsquo;ll say to themselves, &lsquo;Oh,
    we&rsquo;re never likely to see these chaps again,&rsquo; and they won&rsquo;t
    give us anything, or, perhaps, only a pinch of tea or sugar in a big lump
    of paper. There&rsquo;s some women that, can never see a tucker-bag, even
    if you hold it right under their noses. But if they see us going out back
    they&rsquo;ll reckon that we&rsquo;ll get a shed likely as not, and we&rsquo;ll
    be sure to call there with our cheques coming back. I hope the old man&rsquo;s
    got the lumbago, or sciatica, or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because whenever I see an old man poking round the place on a stick
    I always make for him straight and inquire about his trouble; and no matter
    what complaint he&rsquo;s got, my old man suffered from it for years. It&rsquo;s
    pretty hard graft listening to an old man with a pet leg, but I find it pays;
    and I always finish up by advising him to try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil. Perhaps
    he&rsquo;s been trying it for years, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter; the consultation
    works out all right all the same, and there&rsquo;s never been a remedy tried
    yet but I&rsquo;ve got another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of Maori and blackfellow remedies in my mind,
    and when they fail I can fall back on the Chinese; and if that isn&rsquo;t
    enough I&rsquo;ve got a list of my grandmother&rsquo;s remedies that she
    wrote down for me when I was leaving home, and I kept it for a curiosity.
    It took her three days to write them, and I reckon they&rsquo;ll fill the
    bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want a shave. You look better with that stubble on.
    You needn&rsquo;t say anything; just stand by and wear your usual expression,
    and if they ask me what&rsquo;s the matter with my mate I&rsquo;ll fix up
    a disease for you to have, and get something extra on your account, poor
    beggar!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a chap with us that could sing a bit and run the gamut
    on a fiddle or something. With a sickly-looking fish like you to stand by
    and look interesting and die slowly of consumption all the time, and me to
    do the talking, we&rsquo;d be able to travel from one end of the bush to
    the other and live on the fat of the land. I wouldn&rsquo;t cure you for
    a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the shanty, and there, sure enough, was an old man pottering
    round with a list to starboard. He was working with a hoe inside a low paling
    fence round a sort of garden. Steelman and Smith stopped outside the fence. &ldquo;Good
    day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far it was satisfactory.</p>
  <p>He was a little man, with a wiry, red beard. He might have been a Scandinavian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be a bit lame,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;Hurt your
    foot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;lumbago, I suppose? My father suffered
    cruel from it for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, moving closer to the fence. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t in me back; the trouble&rsquo;s with me leg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;One a bit shorter than the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. It seems to be wearin&rsquo; a bit shorter. I must see
    to it. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hip disease, perhaps?&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;A brother o&rsquo; mine
    had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw, it&rsquo;s not in the hip,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;My
    leg&rsquo;s gone at the knee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! stiff joint; I know what that is. Had a touch of it once myself.
    An uncle of mine was nearly crippled with it. He used to use St Jacob&rsquo;s
    oil. Ever try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;not that I know of. I&rsquo;ve
    used linseed oil though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Linseed oil!&rdquo; said Steelman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard
    of that for stiff knee. How do you use it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Use it raw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Raw linseed oil; I&rsquo;ve
    rubbed it in, and I&rsquo;ve soaked me leg in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soaked your leg in it!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;And did it do
    it any good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to preserve it&mdash;keeps it from warping, and it
    wears better&mdash;and it makes it heavier. It seemed a bit too light before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman nudged Smith under cover of the palings. The old man was evidently
    a bit ratty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well I hope your leg will soon be all right, boss,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
    there&rsquo;s much hope. I suppose you want some tucker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Steelman, rather taken aback by the old man&rsquo;s
    sudden way of putting it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hard up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, come along to the house and I&rsquo;ll see if I can get yer
    something,&rdquo; said the old man; and they walked along outside the fence,
    and he hobbled along inside, till he came to a little gate at the corner.
    He opened the gate and stumped out. He had a wooden leg. He wore his trouser-leg
    down over it, and the palings had hidden the bottom from Steelman and Smith.</p>
  <p>He wanted them to stay to dinner, but Steelman didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable,
    and thanked him, and said they&rsquo;d rather be getting on (Steelman always
    spoke for Smith); so the old man gave them some cooked meat, bread, and a
    supply of tea and sugar. Steelman watched his face very close, but he never
    moved a muscle. But when they looked back he was leaning on his hoe, and
    seemed to be shaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Took you back a bit, Steely, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; suggested Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; snorted Steelman, turning on him
    suddenly. &ldquo;I knew a carpenter who used to soak his planes in raw linseed
    oil to preserve them and give them weight. There&rsquo;s nothing funny about
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>

  <p>I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I was spifflicated before I ever seen a pub!</p>
  <p>You see, it&rsquo;s this way. Suppose a cove comes along on a blazin&rsquo; hot
    day in the drought&mdash;an&rsquo;&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;ought to know how
    hell-hot it can be out here&mdash;an&rsquo; he dumps his swag in the corner
    of the bar; an&rsquo; he turns round an&rsquo; he ses ter me, &ldquo;Look
    here boss, I ain&rsquo;t got a lonely steever on me, an&rsquo; God knows
    when I&rsquo;ll git one. I&rsquo;ve tramped ten mile this mornin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have ter tramp another ten afore to-night. I&rsquo;m
    expectin&rsquo; ter git on shearin&rsquo; with of Baldy Thompson at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday
    nex&rsquo;  week. I got a thirst on me like a sun-struck bone, an&rsquo;,
    for God sake, put up a couple o&rsquo; beers for me an&rsquo; my mate, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
    fix it up with yer when I come back after shearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s a feller ter do? I bin there meself, an&rsquo;&mdash;I
    put it to you! I&rsquo;ve known what it is to have a thirst on me.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; suppose a poor devil comes along in the jim-jams, with every inch
    on him jumpin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a look in his eyes like a man bein&rsquo; murdered
    an&rsquo; sent ter hell, an&rsquo; a whine in his voice like a whipped cur,
    an&rsquo; the snakes a-chasing of him; an&rsquo; he hooks me with his finger
    ter the far end o&rsquo; the bar&mdash;as if he was goin&rsquo; ter tell
    me that the world was ended&mdash;an&rsquo; he hangs over the bar an&rsquo; chews
    me lug, an&rsquo; tries to speak, an&rsquo; breaks off inter a sort o&rsquo; low
    shriek, like a terrified woman, an&rsquo; he says, &ldquo;For Mother o&rsquo; Christ&rsquo;s
    sake, giv&rsquo; me a drink!&rdquo; An&rsquo; what am I to do? I bin there
    meself. I knows what the horrors is. He mighter blued his cheque at the last
    shanty. But what am I ter do? I put it ter you. If I let him go he might
    hang hisself ter the nex&rsquo;  leanin&rsquo; tree.</p>
  <p>What&rsquo;s a drink? yer might arst&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind a drink or
    two; but when it comes to half a dozen in a day it mounts up, I can tell
    yer. Drinks is sixpence here&mdash;I have to pay for it, an&rsquo; pay carriage
    on it. It&rsquo;s all up ter me in the end. I used sometimes ter think it
    was lucky I wasn&rsquo;t west o&rsquo; the sixpenny line, where I&rsquo;d
    lose a shillin&rsquo; on every drink I give away.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; supposen a sundowner comes along smokin&rsquo; tea-leaves, an&rsquo; ses
    ter me, &ldquo;Look her, boss! me an&rsquo; my mate ain&rsquo;t had a smoke
    for three days!&rdquo; What&rsquo;s a man ter do? I put it ter you! I&rsquo;m
    a heavy smoker meself, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve known what it is to be without
    a smoke on the track. But &ldquo;nail-rod&rdquo; is ninepence a stick out
    here, an&rsquo; I have ter pay carriage. It all mounts up, I can tell yer.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; supposen Ole King Billy an&rsquo; his ole black gin comes round
    at holiday time and squats on the verander, an&rsquo; blarneys an&rsquo; wheedles
    and whines and argues like a hundred Jews an&rsquo; ole Irishwomen put tergether,
    an&rsquo; accuses me o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; his blarsted country from him,
    an&rsquo; makes me an&rsquo; the missus laugh; an&rsquo; we gives him a bottl&rsquo;er
    rum an&rsquo; a bag of grub ter get rid of him an&rsquo; his rotten ole scarecrow
    tribe&mdash;It all tells up. I was allers soft on the blacks, an&rsquo;,
    beside, a ole gin nursed me an&rsquo; me mother when I was born, an&rsquo; saved
    me blessed life&mdash;not that that mounts to much. But it all tells up,
    an&rsquo; I got me licence ter pay. An&rsquo; some bloody skunk goes an&rsquo; informs
    on me for supplyin&rsquo; the haboriginalls with intossicatin&rsquo; liquor,
    an&rsquo; I have ter pay a fine an&rsquo; risk me licence. But what&rsquo;s
    a man ter do?</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; three or four herrin&rsquo;-gutted jackeroos comes along about
    dinner-time, when the table&rsquo;s set and the cookin&rsquo; smellin&rsquo;  from
    the kichen, with their belts done up three holes, an&rsquo; not the price
    of a feed on &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s a man ter do? I&rsquo;ve known what
    it is ter do a perish on the track meself. It&rsquo;s not the tucker I think
    on. I don&rsquo;t care a damn for that. When the shearers come every one
    is free to go inter the kitchin an&rsquo; forage for hisself when he feels
    hungry&mdash;so long as he pays for his drink. But the jackeroos can&rsquo;t
    pay for drinks, an&rsquo; I have ter pay carriage on the flour an&rsquo; tea
    an&rsquo;  sugar an&rsquo; groceries&mdash;an&rsquo; it all tells up by the
    end o&rsquo; the year.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; a straight chap that knows me gets a job to take a flock o&rsquo; sheep
    or a mob o&rsquo; cattle ter the bloomin&rsquo; Gulf, or South Australia,
    or somewheers&mdash;an&rsquo; loses one of his horses goin&rsquo; out ter
    take charge, an&rsquo; borrers eight quid from me ter buy another. He&rsquo;ll
    turn up agen in a year or two an&rsquo; most likely want ter make me take
    twenty quid for that eight&mdash;an&rsquo; make everybody about the place
    blind drunk&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got ter wait, an&rsquo; the wine an&rsquo;  sperit
    merchants an&rsquo; the brewery won&rsquo;t. They know I can&rsquo;t do without
    liquor in the place.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; lars&rsquo; rains Jimmy Nowlett, the bullick-driver, gets bogged
    over his axle-trees back there on the Blacksoil Plains between two flooded
    billerbongs, an&rsquo; prays till the country steams an&rsquo;  his soul&rsquo;s
    busted, an&rsquo; his throat like a lime-kiln. He taps a keg o&rsquo; rum
    or beer ter keep his throat in workin&rsquo; order. I don&rsquo;t mind that
    at all, but him an&rsquo; his mates git flood-bound for near a week, an&rsquo; broach
    more kegs, an&rsquo; go on a howlin&rsquo; spree in ther mud, an&rsquo; spill
    mor&rsquo;n they swipe, an&rsquo; leave a tarpaulin off a load, an&rsquo; the
    flour gets wet, an&rsquo; the sugar runs out of the bags like syrup, an&rsquo;&mdash; What&rsquo;s
    a feller ter do? Do yer expect me to set the law outer Jimmy? I&rsquo;ve
    knowed him all my life, an&rsquo; he knowed my father afore I was born. He&rsquo;s
    been on the roads this forty year, till he&rsquo;s as thin as a rat, and
    as poor as a myall black; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got a family ter keep back
    there in Bourke. No, I have ter pay for it in the end, an&rsquo; it all mounts
    up, I can tell yer.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; suppose some poor devil of a new-chum black sheep comes along,
    staggerin&rsquo; from one side of the track to the other, and spoutin&rsquo; poetry;
    dyin&rsquo; o&rsquo; heat or fever, or heartbreak an&rsquo; home-sickness,
    or a life o&rsquo; disserpation he&rsquo;d led in England, an&rsquo; without
    a sprat on him, an&rsquo;  no claim on the bush; an&rsquo; I ketches him
    in me arms as he stumbles inter the bar, an&rsquo; he wants me ter hold him
    up while he turns English inter Greek for me. An&rsquo; I put him ter bed,
    an&rsquo; he gits worse, an&rsquo; I have ter send the buggy twenty mile
    for a doctor&mdash;an&rsquo; pay him. An&rsquo; the jackeroo gits worse,
    an&rsquo; has ter be watched an&rsquo; nursed an&rsquo; held down sometimes;
    an&rsquo; he raves about his home an&rsquo;  mother in England, an&rsquo; the
    blarsted University that he was eddicated at&mdash;an&rsquo; a woman&mdash;an&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; that
    sounds like poetry in French; an&rsquo; he upsets my missus a lot, an&rsquo; makes
    her blubber. An&rsquo; he dies, an&rsquo; I have ter pay a man ter bury him
    (an&rsquo; knock up a sort o&rsquo; fence round the grave arterwards ter
    keep the stock out), an&rsquo; send the buggy agen for a parson, an&rsquo;&mdash;Well,
    what&rsquo;s a man ter do? I couldn&rsquo;t let him wander away an&rsquo; die
    like a dog in the scrub, an&rsquo; be shoved underground like a dog, too,
    if his body was ever found. The Government might pay ter bury him, but there
    ain&rsquo;t never been a pauper funeral from my house yet, an&rsquo; there
    won&rsquo;t be one if I can help it&mdash;except it be meself.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s the bother goin&rsquo; through his papers to
    try an&rsquo; find out who he was an&rsquo; where his friends is. An&rsquo; I
    have ter get the missus to write a letter to his people, an&rsquo; we have
    ter make up lies about how he died ter make it easier for &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; goin&rsquo; through
    his letters, the missus comes across a portrait an&rsquo; a locket of hair,
    an&rsquo; letters from his mother an&rsquo; sisters an&rsquo; girl; an&rsquo; they
    upset her, an&rsquo; she blubbers agin, an&rsquo; gits sentimental-like she
    useter long ago when we was first married.</p>
  <p>There was one bit of poetry&mdash;I forgit it now&mdash;that that there
    jackeroo kep&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; over an&rsquo; over agen till it buzzed
    in me head; an&rsquo;, weeks after, I&rsquo;d ketch the missus mutterin&rsquo; it
    to herself in the kitchen till I thought she was goin&rsquo; ratty.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; we gets a letter from the jackeroo&rsquo;s friends that puts us
    to a lot more bother. I hate havin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; to do with letters.
    An&rsquo; someone&rsquo;s sure to say he was lambed down an&rsquo; cleaned
    out an&rsquo;  poisoned with bad bush liquor at my place. It&rsquo;s almost
    enough ter make a man wish there was a recorin&rsquo; angel.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the end of it? I got the blazin&rsquo; bailiff in
    the place now! I can&rsquo;t shot him out because he&rsquo;s a decent, hard-up,
    poor devil from Bourke, with consumption or somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    been talkin&rsquo; to the missus about his missus an&rsquo; kids; an&rsquo; I
    see no chance of gittin&rsquo;  rid of him, unless the shearers come along
    with their cheques from West-o&rsquo;-Sunday nex&rsquo; week and act straight
    by me. Like as not I&rsquo;ll have ter roll up me swag an&rsquo; take the
    track meself in the end. They say publicans are damned, an&rsquo; I think
    so, too; an&rsquo; I wish I&rsquo;d bin operated on before ever I seen a
    pub.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearersDream"></a>The Shearer&rsquo;s Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Mitchell&nbsp;and I rolled up our swags after New Year and started to tramp
    west. It had been a very bad season after a long drought. Old Baldy Thompson
    had only shorn a few bales of grass-seed and burrs, so he said, and thought
    of taking the track himself; but we hoped to get on shearing stragglers at
    West-o&rsquo;-Sunday or one of the stations of the Hungerford track.</p>
  <p>It was very hot weather, so we started after sunset, intending to travel
    all night. We crossed the big billabong, and were ploughing through the dust
    and sand towards West Bourke, when a buggy full of city girls and swells
    passed by. They were part of a theatrical company on tour in the Back-Blocks,
    and some local Johnnies. They&rsquo;d been driven out to see an artesian
    bore, or wool-shed, or something. The horses swerved, and jerked a little
    squawk out of one of the girls. Then another said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow-w! Two old swaggies. He! he! he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced at Mitchell to see if he was hit, and caught his head down; but
    he pulled himself up and pretended to hitch his swag into an easier position.</p>
  <p>About a hundred yards further on he gave me a side look and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did that touch you, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, and I laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re more to
    be pitied than blamed. It&rsquo;s their ignorance. In the first place, we&rsquo;re
    not two old tramps, as they think. We are professional shearers; and the
    Australian shearers are about the most independent and intelligent class
    of men in the world. We&rsquo;ve got more genius in one of our little fingers
    than there is in the whole of that wagonette-load of diddle-daddle and fiddle-faddle
    and giggles. Their intellects are on a level with the rotten dramas they
    travel with, and their lives about as false. They are slaves to the public,
    and their home is the pub-parlour, with sickly, senseless Johnnies to shout
    suppers and drink for them and lend their men money. If one of those girls
    is above the average, how she must despise those Johnnies&mdash;and the life!
    She must feel a greater contempt for them than the private-barmaid does for
    the boozer she cleans out. He gets his drink and some enjoyment, anyhow.
    And how she must loathe the life she leads! And what&rsquo;s the end of it
    as often as not? I remember once, when I was a boy, I was walking out with
    two aunts of mine&mdash;they&rsquo;re both dead now. God rest their fussy,
    innocent old souls!&mdash;and one of &rsquo;em said suddenly, &lsquo;Look!
    Quick, Jack! There&rsquo;s Maggie So-and-So, the great actress.&rsquo; And
    I looked and saw a woman training vines in a porch. It seemed like seeing
    an angel to me, and I never forgot her as she was then. The diggers used
    to go miles out of town to meet the coach that brought her, and take the
    horses out and drag it in, and throw gold in her lap, and worship her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last time I was in Sydney I saw her sitting in the back parlour
    of a third-rate pub. She was dying of dropsy and couldn&rsquo;t move from
    her chair. She showed me a portrait of herself as I remembered her, and talked
    quite seriously about going on the stage again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, our home is about two thousand miles wide, and the world&rsquo;s
    our stage. If the worst comes to the worst we can always get tucker and wood
    and water for nothing. If we&rsquo;re camping at a job in a tent there&rsquo;s
    no house-cleaning to bother us. All we&rsquo;ve got to do when the camp gets
    too dirty is to shift the tent to a fresh place. We&rsquo;ve got time to
    think and we&rsquo;re free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, agen,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s
    point of view to be considered. Some day I might be flashing past in a buggy
    or saloon-carriage&mdash;or, the chances are it will be you&mdash;and you
    might look out the window and see an old swaggy tramping along in the dust,
    or camped under a strip of calico in the rain in the scrub. (And it might
    be me&mdash;old Mitchell&mdash;that really wrote your books, only the world
    won&rsquo;t know it.) And then you&rsquo;ll realize what a wretched, miserable
    life it was. We never realize the miseries of life till we look back&mdash;the
    mistakes and miseries that had to be and couldn&rsquo;t be helped. It&rsquo;s
    all luck&mdash;luck and chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But those girls seemed to have gravelled Mitchell, and he didn&rsquo;t seem
    able to talk himself round. He tramped on, brooding for a while, and then
    suddenly he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Harry! Those girls are giving a dance to-night, and if
    I liked to go back to Bourke and tog up and go to the dance I could pick
    out the prettiest, dance with her all the evening, and take her for a stroll
    afterwards, old tramp as they thought me. I&rsquo;ve lived&mdash;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be worth my while now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d seen Jack in a mood like this before, and thought it best to say
    nothing. Perhaps the terrible heat had affected him a little. We walked on
    in silence until we came to the next billabong. &ldquo;Best boil the billy
    here, Harry,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and have some tea before we go
    any further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got some sticks together and made a fire and put the billy on. The country
    looked wretched&mdash;like the ghost of a burnt-out land&mdash;in the moonlight.
    The banks of the creek were like ashes, the thin, gnarled gum-bush seemed
    dry-rotting fast, and in many places the surface of the ground was cracked
    in squares where it had shrunk in the drought. In the bed of the creek was
    a narrow gutter of water that looked like bad milk.</p>
  <p>Mitchell sat on his swag, with his pint of tea on the ground by his foot,
    and chewed his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Have you got the blues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Harry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally dull
    the first day on the track. The first day is generally the worst, anywhere
    or anytime&mdash;except, perhaps, when you&rsquo;re married. . . . I got&mdash;well,
    I got thinking of the time when a woman&rsquo;s word could have hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then one of the &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; who were camped a bit up the
    creek suddenly commenced to sing. It was a song called &ldquo;The Shearer&rsquo;s
    Dream,&rdquo; and I suppose the buggy of girls, or the conversation they
    started, reminded him of it. He started his verses and most of his lines
    with a howl; and there were unexpected howls all through the song, and it
    wailed off, just as unexpectedly, in places where there was no pathos that
    I could see:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, I dreamt I shore in a shearer&rsquo;s shed, and
    it was a dream of joy,<br>
    For every one of the rouseabouts was a girl dressed up as a boy&mdash;<br>
    Dressed up like a page in a pantomime, and the prettiest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had flaxen hair, they had coal-black hair&mdash;and every shade between.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every&rdquo; with sudden and great energy, a long drop on to &ldquo;shade,&rdquo; and
    a wail of intense sadness and regret running on into &ldquo;between,&rdquo; the
    dirge reaching its wailsomest in the &ldquo;tween&rdquo; in every case.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The shed was cooled by electric fans that was over every &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;;<br>
    The pens was of polished ma-ho-gany, and ev&rsquo;rything else to suit;<br>
    The huts was fixed with spring-mattresses, and the tucker was simply grand,<br>
    And every Right by the biller-bong we darnced to a German band.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus, boys!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was short, plump girls, there was tall, slim girls,
    and the handsomest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They was four-foot-five, they was six-foot high, and hevery size between.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Our pay was the wool on the jumbucks&rsquo; backs, so
    we shore till all was blue&mdash;<br>
    The sheep was washed afore they was shore (and the rams was scented too);<br>
    And we all of us cried when the shed cut out, in spite of the long, hot days,<br>
    For hevery hour them girls waltzed in with whisky and beer on tr-a-a-a-ys!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus! you &mdash;&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;They had kind grey eyes, they had coal-black eyes, and
    the grandest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had plump pink hands, they had slim white hands, and hevery shape be-tw-e-e-n.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was three of them girls to every chap, and as
    jealous as they could be&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow! you &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The singer&rsquo;s voice or memory seemed suddenly to have failed him at
    this point, but whether his mates hit him on the back of the head with a
    tomahawk, or only choked him, I do not know. Mitchell was inclined to think,
    from the sound of it, that they choked him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLostSoulsHotel"></a>The Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel</b></h2>
  <p>Hungerford road, February. One hundred and thirty miles of heavy reddish
    sand, bordered by dry, hot scrubs. Dense cloud of hot dust. Four wool-teams
    passing through a gate in a &ldquo;rabbit proof&rdquo; fence which crosses
    the road. Clock, clock, clock of wheels and rattle and clink of chains, crack
    of whips and explosions of Australian language. Bales and every thing else
    coated with dust. Stink of old axle-grease and tarpaulins. Tyres hot enough
    to fry chops on: bows and chains so hot that it&rsquo;s a wonder they do
    not burn through the bullock&rsquo;s hides. Water lukewarm in blistered kegs
    slung behind the wagons. Bullocks dragging along as only bullocks do. Wheels
    ploughing through the deep sand, and the load lurching from side to side.
    Half-way on a &ldquo;dry-stretch&rdquo;  of seventeen miles. Big &ldquo;tank&rdquo; full
    of good water through the scrub to the right, but it is a private tank and
    a boundary-rider is shepherding it. Mulga scrub and sparse, spiky undergrowth.</p>
  <p>The carriers camp for dinner and boil their billies while the bullocks droop
    under their yokes in the blazing heat; one or two lie down and the leaders
    drag and twist themselves round under a dead tree, under the impression that
    there is shade there. The carriers look like Red Indians, with the masks
    of red dust &ldquo;bound&rdquo; with sweat on their faces, but there is an
    unhealthy-looking, whitish space round their eyes, caused by wiping away
    the blinding dust, sweat, and flies. The dry sticks burn with a pale flame
    and an almost invisible thin pale blue smoke. The sun&rsquo;s heat dancing
    and dazzling across every white fence-post, sandhill, or light-coloured object
    in the distance.</p>
  <p>One man takes off his boot and sock, empties half a pint of sand out of
    them, and pulls up his trouser-leg. His leg is sheathed to the knee in dust
    and sweat; he absently scrapes it with his knife, and presently he amuses
    himself by moistening a strip with his forefinger and shaving it, as if he
    were vaguely curious to see if he is still a white man.</p>
  <p>The Hungerford coach ploughs past in a dense cloud of dust.</p>
  <p>The teams drag on again like a &ldquo;wounded snake that dies at sundown,&rdquo; if
    a wounded snake that dies at sundown could revive sufficiently next morning
    to drag on again until another sun goes down.</p>
  <p>Hopeless-looking swagmen are met with during the afternoon, and one carrier&mdash;he
    of the sanded leg&mdash;lends them tobacco; his mates contribute &ldquo;bits
    o&rsquo;&rdquo; tea, flour, and sugar.</p>
  <p>Sundown and the bullocks done up. The teamsters unyoke them and drive them
    on to the next water&mdash;five miles&mdash;having previously sent a mate
    to reconnoitre and see that boundary rider is not round, otherwise, to make
    terms with him, for it is a squatter&rsquo;s bore. They hurry the bullocks
    down to the water and back in the twilight, and then, under cover of darkness,
    turn them into a clearing in the scrub off the road, where a sign of grass
    might be seen&mdash;if you look close. But the &ldquo;bullockies&rdquo; are
    better off than the horse-teamsters, for bad chaff is sold by the pound and
    corn is worth its weight in gold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mitchell and I turned off the track at the rabbit-proof fence and made for
    the tank in the mulga. We boiled the billy and had some salt mutton and damper.
    We were making back for Bourke, having failed to get a cut in any of the
    sheds on the Hungerford track. We sat under a clump of mulga saplings, with
    our backs to the trunks, and got out our pipes. Usually, when the flies were
    very bad on the track, we had to keep twigs or wild-turkey-tail feathers
    going in front of our faces the whole time to keep the mad flies out of our
    eyes; and, when we camped, one would keep the feather going while the other
    lit his pipe&mdash;then the smoke would keep them away. But the flies weren&rsquo;t
    so bad in a good shade or in the darkened hut. Mitchell&rsquo;s pipe would
    have smoked out Old Nick; it was an ancient string-bound meerschaum, and
    strong enough to kill a blackfellow. I had one smoke out of it, once when
    I felt bad in my inside and wanted to be sick, and the result was very satisfactory.</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked through his old pocket-book&mdash;more by force of habit
    than anything else&mdash;and turned up a circular from Tattersall&rsquo;s.
    And that reminded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;d do, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I
    won Tattersall&rsquo;s big sweep, or was to come into fifty or a hundred
    thousand pounds, or, better still, a million?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except to get away to Sydney
    or some cooler place than this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; said Mitchell, talking
    round his pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d build a Swagman&rsquo;s Rest right here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A Swagman&rsquo;s Rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Right here on this very God-forsaken spot. I&rsquo;d build a
    Swagman&rsquo;s Rest and call it the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel, or the Sundowners&rsquo; Arms,
    or the Half-way House to &mdash;&mdash;, or some such name that would take
    the bushmen&rsquo;s fancy. I&rsquo;d have it built on the best plans for
    coolness in a hot country; bricks, and plenty of wide verandas with brick
    floors, and balconies, and shingles, in the old Australian style. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have a sheet of corrugated iron about the place. And I&rsquo;d have old-fashioned
    hinged sashes with small panes and vines round &rsquo;em; they look cooler
    and more homely and romantic than the glaring sort that shove up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d dig a tank or reservoir for surface water as big as
    a lake, and bore for artesian water&mdash;and get it, too, if I had to bore
    right through to England; and I&rsquo;d irrigate the ground and make it grow
    horse-feed and fruit, and vegetables too, if I had to cart manure from Bourke.
    And every teamster&rsquo;s bullock or horse, and every shearer&rsquo;s hack,
    could burst itself free, but I&rsquo;d make travelling stock pay&mdash;for
    it belongs to the squatters and capitalists. All carriers could camp for
    one night only. And I&rsquo;d&mdash;no, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any flowers;
    they might remind some heart-broken, new-chum black sheep of the house where
    he was born, and the mother whose heart he broke&mdash;and the father whose
    grey hairs he brought down in sorrow to the grave&mdash;and break him up
    altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what about the old-fashioned windows and the vines?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I forgot them. On second thought,
    I think I would have some flowers; and maybe a bit of ivy-green. The new
    chum might be trying to work out his own salvation, and the sight of the
    roses and ivy would show him that he hadn&rsquo;t struck such a God-forgotten
    country after all, and help strengthen the hope for something better that&rsquo;s
    in the heart of every vagabond till he dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Puff, puff, puff, slowly and reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until he dies,&rdquo; repeated Mitchell. &ldquo;And, maybe,&rdquo; he
    said, rousing himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a little room fixed up like
    a corner of a swell restaurant, with silver and napkins on the table, and
    I&rsquo;d fix up a waiter, so that when a broken-down University wreck came
    along he might feel, for an hour or so, something like the man he used to
    be. But I suppose,&rdquo; Mitchell reflected, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t feel
    completely his old self without a lady friend sitting opposite to him. I
    might fix up a black gin for him, but I suppose he&rsquo;d draw the colour
    line. But that&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All teamsters and travellers could camp there for one night only.
    I&rsquo;d have shower-baths; but I wouldn&rsquo;t force any man to have a
    bath against his will. They could sit down to a table and have a feed off
    a table-cloth, and sleep in sheets, and feel like they did before their old
    mothers died, or before they ran away from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who? The mothers?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, in some cases,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have
    a nice, cool little summer-house down near the artificial lake, out of earshot
    of the house, where the bullock-drivers could sit with their pipes after
    tea, and tell yarns, and talk in their own language. And I&rsquo;d have boats
    on the lake, too, in case an old Oxford or Cambridge man, or an old sailor
    came along&mdash;it might put years on to his life to have a pull at the
    oars. You remember that old sailor we saw in charge of the engine back there
    at the government tank? You saw how he had the engine?&mdash;clean and bright
    as a new pin&mdash;everything spick-and-span and shipshape, and his hut fixed
    up like a ship&rsquo;s cabin. I believe he thinks he&rsquo;s at sea half
    his time, and shoving her through it, instead of pumping muddy water out
    of a hole in the baking scrubs for starving stock. Or maybe he reckons he&rsquo;s
    keeping her afloat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have fish in this lake of yours?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and any ratty old shepherd
    or sundowner, that&rsquo;s gone mad of heat and loneliness&mdash;like the
    old codger we met back yonder&mdash;he could sit by the lagoon in the cool
    of the evening and fish to his heart&rsquo;s content with a string and a
    bent pin, and dream he&rsquo;s playing truant from school and fishing in
    the brook near his native village in England about fifty years ago. It would
    seem more real than fishing in the dust as some mad old bushmen do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d draw the line somewhere?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;not even at poets. I&rsquo;d try
    to cure them, too, with good wholesome food and plenty of physical exercise.
    The Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would be a refuge for men who&rsquo;d been jail-birds
    once as well as men who were gentlemen once, and for physical wrecks and
    ruined drunkards as well as healthy honest shearers. I&rsquo;d sit down and
    talk to the boozer or felon just as if I thought he was as good a man as
    me&mdash;and he might be, for that matter&mdash;God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sick man would be kept till he recovered, or died; and the boozer,
    suffering from a recovery, I&rsquo;d keep him till he was on his legs again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d have to have a doctor,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that up all right.
    I wouldn&rsquo;t bother much about a respectable medical practitioner from
    the city. I&rsquo;d get a medical wreck who had a brilliant career before
    him once in England and got into disgrace, and cleared out to the colonies&mdash;a
    man who knows what the d.t.&rsquo;s is&mdash;a man who&rsquo;s been through
    it all and knows it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d want a manager, or a clerk or secretary,&rdquo; I
    suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I would,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no
    head for figures. I suppose I&rsquo;d have to advertise for him. If an applicant
    came with the highest testimonials of character, and especially if one was
    signed by a parson, I&rsquo;d tell him to call again next week; and if a
    young man could prove that he came of a good Christian family, and went to
    church regularly, and sang in the choir, and taught Sunday-school, I&rsquo;d
    tell him that he needn&rsquo;t come again, that the vacancy was filled, for
    I couldn&rsquo;t trust him. The man who&rsquo;s been extra religious and
    honest and hard-working in his young days is most likely to go wrong afterwards.
    I&rsquo;d sooner trust some poor old devil of a clerk who&rsquo;d got into
    the hands of a woman or racing men when he was young, and went wrong, and
    served his time for embezzlement; anyway, I&rsquo;d take him out and give
    him another chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about woman&rsquo;s influence?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose there&rsquo;d have to be a woman, if only to keep the
    doctor on the line. I&rsquo;d get a woman with a past, one that hadn&rsquo;t
    been any better than she should have been, they&rsquo;re generally the most
    kind-hearted in the end. Say an actress who&rsquo;d come down in the world,
    or an old opera-singer who&rsquo;d lost her voice but could still sing a
    little. A woman who knows what trouble is. And I&rsquo;d get a girl to keep
    her company, a sort of housemaid, with a couple of black gins or half-castes
    to help her. I&rsquo;d get hold of some poor girl who&rsquo;d been deceived
    and deserted: and a baby or two wouldn&rsquo;t be an objection&mdash;the
    kids would amuse the chaps and help humanize the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what if the manageress fell in love with the doctor?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t provide against love,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    fell in love myself more than once&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d
    have been any worse off if I&rsquo;d have stayed in love. Ah, well! But suppose
    she did fall in love with the doctor and marry him, or suppose she fell in
    love with him and didn&rsquo;t marry him, for that matter&mdash;and suppose
    the girl fell in love with the secretary? There wouldn&rsquo;t be any harm
    done; it would only make them more contented with the home and bind them
    to it. They&rsquo;d be a happy family, and the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would
    be more cheerful and homelike than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing they all fell in love with each other and cleared out,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;d have to clear out for,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell.  &ldquo;But suppose they did. There&rsquo;s more than one medical
    wreck in Australia, and more than one woman with a past, and more than one
    broken old clerk who went wrong and was found out, and who steadied down
    in jail, and there&rsquo;s more than one poor girl that&rsquo;s been deceived.
    I could easily replace &rsquo;em. And the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel might
    be the means of patching up many wrecked lives in that way&mdash;giving people
    with pasts the chance of another future, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d have music and books and pictures?&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have any
    bitter or sex-problem books. They do no good. Problems have been the curse
    of the world ever since it started. I think one noble, kindly, cheerful character
    in a book does more good than all the clever villains or romantic adventurers
    ever invented. And I think a man ought to get rid of his maudlin sentiment
    in private, or when he&rsquo;s drunk. It&rsquo;s a pity that every writer
    couldn&rsquo;t put all his bitterness into one book and then burn it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d have good cheerful books of the best and brightest
    sides of human nature&mdash;Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain, and Bret Harte,
    and those men. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian pictures&mdash;showing the
    brightest and best side of Australian life. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian
    songs. I wouldn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Swannie Ribber,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Home,
    Sweet Home,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo; or any of those old songs
    sung at the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel&mdash;they&rsquo;re the cause of more
    heartbreaks and drink and suicide in the bush than anything else. And if
    a jackeroo got up to sing,  &lsquo;Just before the battle, mother,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Mother
    bit me in me sleep,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d find it was just before the battle
    all right. He&rsquo;d have to go out and sleep in the scrub, where the mosquitoes
    and bulldog ants would bite him out of his sleep. I hate the man who&rsquo;s
    always whining about his mother through his nose, because, as a rule, he
    never cared a rap for his old mother, nor for anyone else, except his own
    paltry, selfish little self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have intellectual and elevating conversation for those
    that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d take charge of that department?&rdquo; I inquired hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;I did have an idea of taking
    it on myself for a while anyway; but, come to think of it, the doctor or
    the woman with the past would have more experience; and I could look after
    that part of the business at a pinch. Of course you&rsquo;re not in a position
    to judge as to my ability in the intellectual line; you see, I&rsquo;ve had
    no one to practise on since I&rsquo;ve been with you. But no matter&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;d
    be intellectual conversation for the benefit of black-sheep new chums. And
    any broken-down actors that came along could get up a play if they liked&mdash;it
    would brighten up things and help elevate the bullock-drivers and sundowners.
    I&rsquo;d have a stage fixed up and a bit of scenery. I&rsquo;d do all I
    could to attract shearers to the place after shearing, and keep them from
    rushing to the next shanty with their cheques, or down to Sydney, to be cleaned
    out by barmaids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have the hero squashed in the last act for a selfish
    sneak, and marry the girl to the villain&mdash;he&rsquo;d be more likely
    to make her happy in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about the farm?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d
    get some expert from the agricultural college to manage that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get some poor drought-ruined
    selector and put him in charge of the vegetation. Only, the worst of it is.&rdquo; he
    reflected, &ldquo;if you take a selector who has bullocked all his life to
    raise crops on dusty, stony patches in the scrubs, and put him on land where
    there&rsquo;s plenty of water and manure, and where he&rsquo;s only got to
    throw the seed on the ground and then light his pipe and watch it grow, he&rsquo;s
    apt to get disheartened. But that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, of course, I&rsquo;d have to have a &lsquo;character&rsquo; about
    the place&mdash;a sort of identity and joker to brighten up things. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    get a man who&rsquo;d been happy and comfortable all his life; I&rsquo;d
    get hold of some old codger whose wife had nagged him till she died, and
    who&rsquo;d been sold off many times, and run in for drowning his sorrows,
    and who started as an undertaker and failed at that, and finally got a job
    pottering round&mdash;gardener, or gatekeeper, or something&mdash;in a lunatic
    asylum. I&rsquo;d get him. He&rsquo;d most likely be a humorist and a philosopher,
    and he&rsquo;d help cheer up the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel. I reckon the lost
    souls would get very fond of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have drink at Lost Souls&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have the best beer and
    spirits and wine to be had. After tea I&rsquo;d let every man have just enough
    to make him feel comfortable and happy, and as good and clever, and innocent
    and honest as any other man, but no more. But if a poor devil came along
    in the horrors, with every inch of him jumping, and snakes, and green-eyed
    yahoos, and flaming-nosed bunyips chasing him, we&rsquo;d take him in and
    give him soothing draughts, and nurse him, and watch him, and clear him out
    with purgatives, and keep giving him nips of good whisky, and, above all,
    we&rsquo;d sympathize with him, and tell him that we were worse than he was
    many a time. We wouldn&rsquo;t tell him what a weak, selfish man he was,
    or harp on his ruined life. We&rsquo;d try to make him out a good deal better
    morally than he really was. It&rsquo;s remorse that hurries most men to hell&mdash;especially
    in the Bush. When a man firmly believes he is a hopeless case, then there&rsquo;s
    no hope for him: but let him have doubts and there&rsquo;s a chance. Make
    him believe that there are far worse cases than his. We wouldn&rsquo;t preach
    the sin of dissipation to him, no&mdash;but we&rsquo;d try to show him the&nbsp;<i>folly</i>&nbsp;of
    a wasted life. I ought to be able to preach that, God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, above all, we&rsquo;d try to drive out of his head the cursed
    old popular idea that it&rsquo;s hard to reform&mdash;that a man&rsquo;s
    got to fight a hard battle with himself to get away from drink&mdash;pity
    drunkards can&rsquo;t believe how easy it is. And we&rsquo;d put it to him
    straight whether his few hours&rsquo; enjoyment were worth the days he had
    to suffer hell for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, likely as not,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;d put him
    on his feet he&rsquo;d take the nearest track to the next shanty, and go
    on a howling spree, and come back to Lost Souls&rsquo; in a week, raving
    and worse than ever. What would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d take him in again, and build him up some more; and a third
    or fourth time if necessary. I believe in going right on with a thing once
    I take it in hand. And if he didn&rsquo;t turn up after the last spree we&rsquo;d
    look for him up the scrub and bring him in and let him die on a bed, and
    make his death as comfortable as possible. I&rsquo;ve seen one man die on
    the ground, and found one dead in the bush. We&rsquo;d bury him under a gum
    and put &lsquo;Sacred to the Memory of a Man who Died. (Let him R.I.P.)&rsquo; over
    him. I&rsquo;d have a nice little graveyard, with gums for tombstones&mdash;and
    I&rsquo;d have some original epitaphs&mdash;I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how much gratitude would you expect to get out of the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Mitchell, promptly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
    a Gratitude Discovery Syndicate. People might say that the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel
    was a den for kidnapping women and girls to be used as decoys for the purpose
    of hocussing and robbing bushmen, and the law and retribution might come
    after me&mdash;but I&rsquo;d fight the thing out. Or they might want to make
    a K.C.M.G., or a god of me, and worship me before they hung me. I reckon
    a philanthropist or reformer is lucky if he escapes with a whole skin in
    the end, let alone his character&mdash;&mdash; But there!&mdash;&mdash; Talking
    of gratitude: it&rsquo;s the fear of ingratitude that keeps thousands from
    doing good. It&rsquo;s just as paltry and selfish and cowardly as any other
    fear that curses the world&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather more selfish than most
    fears, in fact&mdash;take the fear of being thought a coward, or being considered
    eccentric, or conceited, or affected, or too good, or too bad, for instance.
    The man that&rsquo;s always canting about the world&rsquo;s ingratitude has
    no gratitude owing to him as a rule&mdash;generally the reverse&mdash;he
    ought to be grateful to the world for being let live. He broods over the
    world&rsquo;s ingratitude until he gets to be a cynic. He sees the world
    like the outside of a window, as it were, with the blind drawn and the dead,
    cold moonlight shining on it, and he passes on with a sour face; whereas,
    if he took the trouble to step inside he&rsquo;d most likely find a room
    full of ruddy firelight, and sympathy and cheerfulness, and kindness, and
    love, and gratitude. Sometimes, when he&rsquo;s right down on his uppers,
    and forced to go amongst people and hustle for bread, he gets a lot of surprises
    at the amount of kindness he keeps running against in the world&mdash;and
    in places where he&rsquo;d never have expected to find it. But&mdash;ah,
    well! I&rsquo;m getting maudlin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve forgot all about the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that
    up all right. As soon as I&rsquo;d got things going smoothly under a man
    I could trust, I&rsquo;d tie up every penny I had for the benefit of the
    concern; get some &lsquo;white men&rsquo; for trustees, and take the track
    again. I&rsquo;m getting too old to stay long in one place&mdash;(I&rsquo;m
    a lost soul that always got along better in another place). I&rsquo;m so
    used to the track that if I was shut up in a house I&rsquo;d get walking
    up and down in my room of nights and disturb the folk; and, besides, I&rsquo;d
    feel lost and light-shouldered without the swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d put all your money in the concern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;except a pound or two to go on the track with&mdash;for,
    who knows, I might come along there, dusty and tired, and ragged and hard
    up and old, some day, and be very glad of a night&rsquo;s rest at the Lost
    Souls&rsquo; Hotel. But I wouldn&rsquo;t let on that I was old Mitchell,
    the millionaire, who founded Lost Souls&rsquo;. They might be too officious,
    and I hate fuss. . . . But it&rsquo;s time to take the track, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There came a cool breeze with sunset; we stood up stiffly, shouldered our
    swags and tucker-bags, and pushed on, for we had to make the next water before
    we camped. We were out of tobacco, so we borrowed some from one of the bullock-drivers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBoozersHome"></a>The Boozers&rsquo; Home</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;dipsomaniac,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Mitchell, &ldquo;needs sympathy
    and commonsense treatment. (Sympathy&rsquo;s a grand and glorious thing,
    taking it all round and looking at it any way you will: a little of it makes
    a man think that the world&rsquo;s a good world after all, and there&rsquo;s
    room and hope for sinners, and that life&rsquo;s worth living; enough of
    it makes him sure of it: and an overdose of sympathy makes a man&nbsp;<i>feel</i>&nbsp;weak
    and ashamed of himself, and so moves him to stop whining&mdash;and wining&mdash;and
    buck up.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not taking the case of a workman who goes on the spree
    on pay night and sweats the drink out of himself at work next day, nor a
    slum-bred brute who guzzles for the love of it; but a man with brains, who
    drinks to drown his intellect or his memory. He&rsquo;s generally a man under
    it all, and a sensitive, generous, gentle man with finer feelings as often
    as not. The best and cleverest and whitest men in the world seem to take
    to drink mostly. It&rsquo;s an awful pity. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re
    straight and the world&rsquo;s crooked and they can see things too plain.
    And I suppose in the bush the loneliness and the thoughts of the girl-world
    they left behind help to sink  &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now a drunkard seldom reforms at home, because he&rsquo;s always
    surrounded by the signs of the ruin and misery he has brought on the home;
    and the sight and thought of it sets him off again before he&rsquo;s had
    time to recover from the last spree. Then, again, the noblest wife in the
    world mostly goes the wrong way to work with a drunken husband&mdash;nearly
    everything she does is calculated to irritate him. If, for instance, he brings
    a bottle home from the pub, it shows that he wants to stay at home and not
    go back to the pub any more; but the first thing the wife does is to get
    hold of the bottle and plant it, or smash it before his eyes, and that maddens
    him in the state he is in then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. A dipsomaniac needs to be taken away from home for a while. I
    knew a man that got so bad that the way he acted at home one night frightened
    him, and next morning he went into an inebriate home of his own accord&mdash;to
    a place where his friends had been trying to get him for a year past. For
    the first day or two he was nearly dead with remorse and shame&mdash;mostly
    shame; and he didn&rsquo;t know what they were going to do to him next&mdash;and
    he only wanted them to kill him quick and be done with it. He reckons he
    felt as bad as if he was in jail. But there were ten other patients there,
    and one or two were worse than he was, and that comforted him a lot. They
    compared notes and sympathized and helped each other. They discovered that
    all their wives were noble women. He struck one or two surprises too&mdash;one
    of the patients was a doctor who&rsquo;d attended him one time, and another
    was an old boss of his, and they got very chummy. And there was a man there
    who was standing for Parliament&mdash;he was supposed to be having a rest
    down the coast. . . . Yes, my old mate felt very bad for the first day or
    two; it was all Yes, Nurse, and Thank you, Nurse, and Yes, Doctor, and No,
    Doctor, and Thank you, Doctor. But, inside a week, he was calling the doctor &lsquo;Ol&rsquo; Pill-Box&rsquo; behind
    his back, and making love to one of the nurses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he said it was pitiful when women relatives came to visit patients
    the first morning. It shook the patients up a lot, but I reckon it did &rsquo;em
    good. There were well-bred old lady mothers in black, and hard-working, haggard
    wives and loving daughters&mdash;and the expressions of sympathy and faith
    and hope in those women&rsquo;s faces! My old mate said it was enough in
    itself to make a man swear off drink for ever. . . . Ah, God&mdash;what a
    world it is!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me how I once went with the wife of another old mate of mine
    to see him. He was in a lunatic asylum. It was about the worst hour I ever
    had in my life, and I&rsquo;ve had some bad ones. The way she tried to coax
    him back to his old self. She thought she could do it when all the doctors
    had failed. But I&rsquo;ll tell you about him some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old mate said that the principal part of the treatment was supposed
    to be injection of bi-chloride of gold or something, and it was supposed
    to be a secret. It might have been water and sugar for all he knew, and he
    thought it was. You see, when patients got better they were allowed out,
    two by two, on their honour&mdash;one to watch the other&mdash;and it worked.
    But it was necessary to have an extra hold on them; so they were told that
    if they were a minute late for &lsquo;treatment,&rsquo; or missed one injection,
    all the good would be undone. This was dinged into their ears all the time.
    Same as many things are done in the Catholic religion&mdash;to hold the people.
    My old mate said that, as far as the medical treatment was concerned, he
    could do all that was necessary himself. But it was the sympathy that counted,
    especially the sympathy between the patients themselves. They always got
    hold of a new patient and talked to him and cheered him up; he nearly always
    came in thinking he was the most miserable wretch in this world.. And it
    comforts a man and strengthens him and makes him happier to meet another
    man who&rsquo;s worse off or sicker, or has been worse swindled than he has
    been. That&rsquo;s human nature. . . . And a man will take draughts from
    a nurse and eat for her when he wouldn&rsquo;t do it for his own wife&mdash;not
    even though she had been a trained nurse herself. And if a patient took a
    bad turn in the night at the Boozers&rsquo; Home and got up to hunt the snakes
    out of his room, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sworn at, or laughed at, or held down;
    no, they&rsquo;d help him shoo the snakes out and comfort him. My old mate
    said that, when he got better, one of the new patients reckoned that he licked
    St Pathrick at managing snakes. And when he came out he didn&rsquo;t feel
    a bit ashamed of his experience. The institution didn&rsquo;t profess to
    cure anyone of drink, only to mend up shattered nerves and build up wrecked
    constitutions; give them back some will-power if they weren&rsquo;t too far
    gone. And they set my old mate on his feet all right. When he went in his
    life seemed lost, he had the horror of being sober, he couldn&rsquo;t start
    the day without a drink or do any business without it. He couldn&rsquo;t
    live for more than two hours without a drink; but when he came out he didn&rsquo;t
    feel as if he wanted it. He reckoned that those six weeks in the institution
    were the happiest he&rsquo;d ever spent in his life, and he wished the time
    had been longer; he says he&rsquo;d never met with so much sympathy and genius,
    and humour and human nature under one roof before. And he said it was nice
    and novel to be looked after and watched and physicked and bossed by a pretty
    nurse in uniform&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose he told his wife that. And
    when he came out he never took the trouble to hide the fact that he&rsquo;d
    been in. If any of his friends had a drunkard in the family, he&rsquo;d recommend
    the institution and do his best to get him into it. But when he came out
    he firmly believed that if he took one drink he&rsquo;d be a lost man. He
    made a mania of that. One curious effect was that, for some time after he
    left the institution, he&rsquo;d sometimes feel suddenly in high spirits&mdash;with
    nothing to account for it&mdash;something like he used to feel when he had
    half a dozen whiskies in him; then suddenly he&rsquo;d feel depressed and
    sort of hopeless&mdash;with nothing to account for that either&mdash;just
    as if he was suffering a recovery. But those moods never lasted long and
    he soon grew out of them altogether. He didn&rsquo;t flee temptation. He&rsquo;d
    knock round the pubs on Saturday nights with his old mates, but never drank
    anything but soft stuff&mdash;he was always careful to smell his glass for
    fear of an accident or trick. He drank gallons of ginger beer, milk-and-soda,
    and lemonade; and he got very fond of sweets, too&mdash;he&rsquo;d never
    liked them before. He said he enjoyed the novelty of the whole thing and
    his mates amused him at first; but he found he had to leave them early in
    the evening, and, after a while, he dropped them altogether. They seemed
    such fools when they were drunk (they&rsquo;d never seemed fools to him before).
    And, besides, as they got full, they&rsquo;d get suspicious of him, and then
    mad at him, because he couldn&rsquo;t see things as they could. That reminds
    me that it nearly breaks a man&rsquo;s heart when his old drinking chum turns
    teetotaller&mdash;it&rsquo;s worse than if he got married or died. When two
    mates meet and one is drunk and the other sober there is only one of two
    things for them to do if they want to hit it together&mdash;either the drunken
    mate must get sober or the sober mate drunk. And that reminds me: Take the
    case of two old mates who&rsquo;ve been together all their lives, say they
    always had their regular sprees together and went through the same stages
    of drunkenness together, and suffered their recoveries and sobered up together,
    and each could stand about the same quantity of drink and one never got drunker
    than the other. Each, when he&rsquo;s boozing, reckons his mate the cleverest
    man and the hardest case in the world&mdash;second to himself. But one day
    it happens, by a most extraordinary combination of circumstances, that Bill,
    being sober, meets Jim very drunk, and pretty soon Bill is the most disgusted
    man in this world. He never would have dreamed that his old mate could make
    such a fool and such a public spectacle of himself. And Bill&rsquo;s disgust
    intensifies all the time he is helping Jim home, and Jim arguing with him
    and wanting to fight him, and slobbering over him and wanting to love him
    by turns, until Bill swears he&rsquo;ll give Jim a hammering as soon as ever
    he&rsquo;s able to stand steady on his feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose your old boozing mate&rsquo;s wife was very happy when
    he reformed,&rdquo; I said to Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing his head rather ruefully. &ldquo;I
    suppose it was an exceptional case. But I knew her well, and the fact is
    that she got more discontented and thinner, and complained and nagged him
    worse than she&rsquo;d ever done in his drinking days. And she&rsquo;d never
    been afraid of him. Perhaps it was this way: She loved and married a careless,
    good-natured, drinking scamp, and when he reformed and became a careful,
    hard-working man, and an honest and respected fellow-townsman, she was disappointed
    in him. He wasn&rsquo;t the man that won her heart when she was a girl. Or
    maybe he was only company for her when he was half drunk. Or maybe lots of
    things. Perhaps he&rsquo;d killed the love in her before he reformed&mdash;and
    reformed too late. I wonder how a man feels when he finds out for the first
    time that his wife doesn&rsquo;t love him any longer? But my old mate wasn&rsquo;t
    the nature to find out that sort of thing. Ah, well! If a woman caused all
    our trouble, my God! women have suffered for it since&mdash;and they suffer
    like martyrs mostly and with the patience of working bullocks. Anyway it
    goes, if I&rsquo;m the last man in the world, and the last woman is the worst,
    and there&rsquo;s only room for one more in Heaven, I&rsquo;ll step down
    at once and take my chances in Blazes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSexProblemAgain"></a>The Sex Problem Again</b></h2>
  <p>It&nbsp;was Mitchell&rsquo;s habit to take an evening off now and then from
    yarning or reflecting, and proceed, in a most methodical manner, to wash
    his spare shirts and patch his pants. I was in the habit of contributing
    to some Sydney papers, and every man is an editor at heart, so, at other
    times, Mitchell would take another evening off, and root out my swag, and
    go through my papers in the same methodical manner, and make alterations
    and additions without comment or reference to me; and sometimes he&rsquo;d
    read a little thing of my own which didn&rsquo;t meet his views, and accidentally
    drop it into the fire; and at other times he&rsquo;d get hold of some rhyme
    or sketch that was troubling me, and wrap it up and give it to a passing
    mailman unbeknown to me. The unexpected appearance of such articles in the
    paper, as well as the effects of the involuntary collaboration in other pieces,
    gave me several big surprises.</p>
  <p>It was in camp on a fencing contract west of Bourke. We had a book which
    we&rsquo;d borrowed from a library at Bourke for a year or two&mdash;never
    mind the name of it&mdash;it was in ninety-one or ninety-two, and the sex
    problem was booming then.</p>
  <p>I had been surreptitiously tearing some carefully-written slips of manuscript&mdash;leaves
    taken from an old pocket-book&mdash;into small pieces; I dropped them, with
    apparent carelessness, into the fire and stood with my back to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet five pounds,&rdquo; said Mitchell, suddenly, &ldquo;that
    you&rsquo;ve been trying your hand on a sex-problem story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I shifted uneasily and brought my hands from behind me into my pockets. &ldquo;Well,
    to tell you the truth,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be put
    to the expense of sending you to Sydney for medical treatment yet. You&rsquo;ve
    been having too easy times lately, plenty of hard graft and no anxiety about
    tucker or the future. What are the symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, taking a hand out to scratch the back of my
    head, &ldquo;the plot looked all right&mdash;at first sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a plot, is there? Well, in the first place, a plot
    is a problem. Well, what&rsquo;s the plot? . . . Come on, you needn&rsquo;t
    be frightened to tell an old mate like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the yarn looked all right at first sight;
    that article of &lsquo;T&rsquo;s&rsquo; in the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;turned
    me off it; listen and see what you think of it: There was a young fellow,
    a bit of a genius &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so, it&rsquo;s the geniuses that build the sex problems. It&rsquo;s
    an autobiography. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he married a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell (<i>sotto voce</i>): &ldquo;God help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loved her, and she loved him: but after they&rsquo;d been married
    a while he found out that, although he understood her, she didn&rsquo;t and
    couldn&rsquo;t possibly ever understand him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; commented Mitchell, &ldquo;and if he hadn&rsquo;t caught
    the sex problem, nor been reading about it, he would never have found that
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a terrible disappointment,&rdquo; I continued&mdash;I had
    got into the habit of taking Mitchell&rsquo;s interruptions and comments
    as matters of course&mdash;&ldquo;He saw that his life would be a hell with
    her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t strike him that her life would be a hell with
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had no thought in common.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;She was in her right mind then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t leave her because he loved her, and because
    he knew that she loved him and would break her heart if he left her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have been a pretty cocksure sort of a fellow,&rdquo; remarked
    Mitchell, &ldquo;but all geniuses are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he was with her he saw all her obstinacy, unreason, and selfishness;
    but when he was away he only saw her good points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Pity such men don&rsquo;t stop away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought and thought, and brooded over it till his life was a hell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Jes-so: thanks to the problemaniacs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought of killing her and himself, and so taking her with him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;He must have loved her a lot.
    . . . Good Lord! That shows the awful effects of the sex problem on the mind
    of a healthy young man like you;&rdquo; and Mitchell stood up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lay awake by her side at nights thinking and fighting the thing
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been lying awake, thinking, with me and &lsquo;the
    Oracle&rsquo; by your side. We&rsquo;ll have to plant the tommy-hawk, and
    watch you by turns at night till you get over this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One night he rested on his elbow, and watched her sleeping, and tried
    to reconstruct his ideal out of her, and, just when he was getting into a
    happier frame of mind, her mouth fell open, and she snored. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    get any further than the snore,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell,  &ldquo;and
    none of the sex problemers ever will&mdash;unless they get as far as &lsquo;blanky.&rsquo;  You
    might have made the snore cure him; did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it was making things worse in my idea of the yarn. He fell back
    and lay staring at the ceiling in a hopeless kind of a way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he was a fit case for the lunatic asylum. . . . Now, look here,
    Harry, you&rsquo;re a good-natured, soft old fool when you&rsquo;re in your
    right mind; just you go on being a good-natured, soft old fool, and don&rsquo;t
    try to make a problem out of yourself or anybody else, or you&rsquo;ll come
    to a bad end. A pocket-book&rsquo;s to keep your accounts in, not to take
    notes in (you take them in your head and use &rsquo;em in your arms), not
    to write sex-problem rot in&mdash;that&rsquo;s spoilt many a good pocket-book,
    and many a good man. You&rsquo;ve got a girl you&rsquo;re talking about going
    back to as soon as we&rsquo;ve finished this contract. Don&rsquo;t you make
    a problem of her; make a happy wife and mother of her. . . . I was very clever
    when I was young&rdquo;&mdash;and here Mitchell&rsquo;s voice took a tinge
    of bitterness, or sadness. &ldquo;I used to make problems out of things.
    . . . I ain&rsquo;t much to boast of now. . . . Seems to me that a good many
    men want to make angels of their wives without first taking trouble of making
    saints of themselves. We want to make women&rsquo;s ways our ways&mdash;it
    would be just as fair to make our ways theirs. Some men want to be considered
    gods in their own homes; you&rsquo;ll generally find that sort of men very
    small potatoes outside; if they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t bother
    so much about being cocks on their own little dunghills. . . . And again,
    old mates seldom quarrel, because they understand each other&rsquo;s moods.
    Now, if you went brooding round for any length of time I&rsquo;d say to you. &lsquo;Now
    then, Harry, what have I been doing to you? Spit it out, old man.&rsquo; And
    you&rsquo;d do the same by me; but how many men would take even that much
    trouble with their wives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A breeze stirred the mulga and brought the sound of a good voice singing
    in the surveyors&rsquo; camp</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never brought to min&rsquo;?<br>
    Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days of Auld Lang Syne?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&nbsp;damned old tune will upset the Oracle&nbsp;for the rest
    of the night,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell.  &ldquo;He was
    wronged by a woman as few men are wronged; his life was ruined&mdash;but
    he isn&rsquo;t the man to take any stock in sex problems on account of her.
    He thinks he&rsquo;s great on problems, but he isn&rsquo;t. It all amounts
    to this&mdash;that he&rsquo;s sorry for most men and all women and tries
    to act up to it to the best of his ability; and if he ain&rsquo;t a Christian,
    God knows what is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t. No matter what a woman does to you,
    or what you think she does to you, there come times, sooner or later, when
    you feel sorry for her&mdash;deep down in your heart&mdash;that is if you&rsquo;re
    a man. And, no matter what action or course you might take against her, and
    no matter how right or justified you might seem in doing it, there comes
    a time when, deep down in your heart, you feel mean and doubtful about your
    own part. You can take that as a general thing as regards men against women,
    and man against man, I think. And I believe that deep-down feeling of being
    doubtful, or mean, or sorry, that comes afterwards, when you are cooler and
    know more about the world, is a right and natural thing, and we ought to
    act more in accordance with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Came the refrain from the surveyors&rsquo; camp:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;We twa hae run about the braes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; pu&rsquo;d the gowans fine;<br>
    But we&rsquo;ve wandered mony a weary foot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin&rsquo; Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We feel sorry for our quarrels with our worst enemy when we see him
    lying still and quiet&mdash;dead. Why can&rsquo;t we try and feel a bit sorry
    beforehand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For
    Auld Lang Syne.<br>
    We twa ha&rsquo; padl&rsquo;t i&rsquo; the burn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra mornin&rsquo; sun till dine;<br>
    But seas between us braid ha&rsquo; roar&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin&rsquo; Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to feel blazing bitter against things one time but it never
    hurt anybody but myself in the end. I argued and quarrelled with a girl once&mdash;and
    made a problem of the thing and went away. She&rsquo;s married to a brute
    now, and I&rsquo;m what I am. I made a problem of a good home or the world
    once, and went against the last man in God&rsquo;s world that I should have
    gone against, and turned my back on his hand, and left him. His hand was
    very cold the next time I took it in mine. We don&rsquo;t want problems to
    make us more bitter against the world than we get sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s a han&rsquo; my trusty frien&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; gie&rsquo;s a han&rsquo; o&rsquo; thine,<br>
    We&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; kindness yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that song&rsquo;s the answer of all problems,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>

  <p>But it was I who lay awake and thought that night.</p>
