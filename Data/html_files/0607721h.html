  <h3>NOTE.</h3>

  <p class="note">I designed this story, and, indeed, began to write it,
  between the publication of <i>Tales of Mean Streets</i> and that of <i>A
  Child of the Jago,</i> to be read together with those books: not that I
  pretend to figure in all three&mdash;much less in any one of them&mdash;a
  complete picture of life in the eastern parts of London, but because they are
  complementary, each to the two others. &mdash;<span class="smcap">A.

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE afternoon had slumbered in the sun, but now the August
  air freshened with an awakening breath, and Epping Thicks stirred and
  whispered through a myriad leaves. Far away beyond the heaving greenwoods
  distant clouds floated flat on the upper air, and a richer gold grew over the
  hills as the day went westward. This way and that, between and about trees
  and undergrowth, an indistinct path went straggling by easy grades to the
  lower ground by Wormleyton Pits; an errant path whose every bend gave choice
  of green passes toward banks of heather and bracken. It was by this way that
  an old man and a crippled child had reached the Pits. He was a small old man,
  white-haired, and a trifle bent; but he went his way with a sturdy tread,
  satchel at side and butterfly-net in hand. As for the child, she too went
  sturdily enough, but she hung from a crutch by the right shoulder, and she
  moved with a jog and a swing. The hand that gripped the crutch gripped also a
  little bunch of meadowsweet, and the other clasped tight against her pinafore
  a tattered old book that would else have fallen to pieces.</p>

  <p>Once on the heathery slade, the old man lifted the strap over his head and
  put the satchel down by a tree clump at the wood's edge.</p>

  <p>"'Nother rest for you, Bess," he said, as he knelt to open his bag. "I'm
  goin' over the pits pretty close to-day." He packed his pockets with
  pill-boxes, a poison bottle, and a battered, flat tin case; while the child,
  with a quick rejection of the crutch, sat and watched.</p>

  <p>The old man stood, slapped one pocket after another, and then, with a
  playful sweep of the net-gauze across the child's face, tramped off among the
  heather. "Good luck, gran'dad!" she cried after him, and settled on her elbow
  to read.</p>

  <p>The book needed a careful separation, being open at back as at front;
  likewise great heed lest the leaves fell into confusion: for, since they were
  worn into a shape more oval than rectangular, the page numbers had gone, and
  in places corners of text had gone too. But the main body of the matter,
  thumbed and rubbed, stood good for many a score more readings; and the story
  was <i>The Sicilian Romance.</i></p>

  <p>Round about the pits and across the farther ground of Genesis Slade the
  old man pushed his chase. Now letting himself cautiously down the side of a
  pit; now stealing softly among bracken, with outstretched net; and again
  running his best through the wiry heather. Always working toward sun and
  wind, and often standing watchfully still, his eye alert for a fluttering
  spot amid the flood of colour about him.</p>

  <p>Meantime the little cripple conned again the familiar periods of the old
  romance. Few, indeed, of its ragged leaves but might have been replaced, if
  lost, from pure memory; few, indeed, for that matter, of <i>The Pilgrim's
  Progress</i> or of <i>Susan Hopley,</i> or of <i>The Scottish Chiefs:</i>
  worn volumes all, in her grandfather's little shelf of a dozen or fifteen
  books. So that now, because of old acquaintance, the tale was best enjoyed
  with many pauses; pauses filled with the smell of the meadowsweet, and with
  the fantasy that abode in the woods. For the jangle of a herd-bell was the
  clank of a knight's armour, the distant boom of a great gun at Waltham Abbey
  told of the downfall of enchanted castles, and in the sudden plaint of an
  errant cow she heard the growling of an ogre in the forest.</p>

  <p>The western hillsides grew more glorious, and the sunlight, peeping under
  heavy boughs, flung along the sward, gilt the tree-boles whose shadows veined
  it, and lit nooks under bushes where the wake-robin raised its scarlet mace
  of berries. The old man had dropped his net, and for awhile had been
  searching the herbage. It was late in the day for butterflies, but fox-moth
  caterpillars were plenty among the heather; as well as others. Thus Bessy
  read and dreamed, and her grandfather rummaged the bushes till the sunlight
  was gathered up from the turf under the trees, and lifted from the tallest
  spire among the agrimony, as the sun went beyond the hill-tops. Then at last
  the old man returned to his satchel.</p>

  <p>"The flies ain't much," he observed, as Bessy looked up, "but for trade
  it's best not to miss anything: it's always what you're shortest of as sells;
  and the blues was out late to-day. But I've got luck with caterpillars. If
  they go all right I ought to have a box-full o' Rosy Marbled out o'
  these!"</p>

  <p>"Rosy Marbled! It's a late brood then. And so long since you had any!"</p>

  <p>"Two year; and this is the only place for 'em." The old man packed his bag
  and slung it across his back. "We'll see about tea now," he added, as the
  child rose on her crutch; "but we'll keep open eyes as we go."</p>

  <p>Over the slade they took their way, where the purple carpet was patterned
  with round hollows, black with heather-ash and green with star-moss; by the
  edges of the old gravel-pits, overhung with bramble and bush; and so into
  more woods.</p>

  <p>A jay flew up before them, scolding angrily. Now and again a gap among the
  trees let through red light from beyond Woodredon. Again and again the old
  man checked his walk, sometimes but to drop once more into his even tramp,
  sometimes to stop, and sometimes to beat the undergrowth and to shake
  branches. To any who saw there was always a vaguely familiar quality in old
  May's walk; ever a patient plod, and, burdened or not, ever an odd suggestion
  of something carried over shoulder; matters made plain when it was learned
  that the old man had been forty years a postman.</p>

  <p>Presently as they walked they heard shrieks, guffaws, and a discordant
  singing that half-smothered the whine of a concertina. The noise was the
  louder as they went, and when they came where the white of a dusty road
  backed the tree-stems, they heard it at its fullest. Across the way was an
  inn, and by its side a space of open ground whereon some threescore
  beanfeasters sported at large. Many were busy at kiss-in-the-ring, some waved
  branches torn from trees, others stood up empty bottles and flung more
  bottles at them; they stood, sat, ran, lay, and rolled, but each made noise
  of some sort, and most drank. Plainly donkey-riding had palled, for a man and
  a boy had gathered their half-dozen donkeys together, and were driving them
  off.</p>

  <p>The people were Londoners, as Bessy knew, for she had often seen others.
  She had forgotten London herself&mdash;all of it but a large drab room with a
  row of little beds like her own, each bed with a board on it, for toys; and
  this, too, she would have forgotten (for she was very little indeed then) but
  that a large and terrible gentleman had come every day and hurt her bad leg.
  It was the Shadwell Hospital. But these were Londoners, and Bessy was a
  little afraid of them, and conceived London to be a very merry and noisy
  place, very badly broken, everywhere, by reason of the Londoners. Other
  people, also, came in waggonettes, and were a little quieter, and less
  gloriously bedecked. She had seen such a party earlier in the day. Probably
  they were not real Londoners, but folk from parts adjoining. But
  these&mdash;these were Londoners proper, wearing each other's hats, with
  paper wreaths on them.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"Wayo, old 'un!" bawled one, as the old man, net in hand, crossed toward
  the wood opposite; "bin ketchin' tiddlers?" And he turned to his companions
  with a burst of laughter and a jerk of the thumb. "D'year, Bill! 'Ere's yer
  ole gran'father ketchin' tiddlers! Why doncher keep 'im out o' mischief?" And
  every flushed face, doubly reddened by the setting sun, turned and opened its
  mouth in a guffaw. <i>"You'll</i> cop it for gittin' yer trouseys wet!"
  screamed a woman. And somebody flung a lump of crust.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Bessy jogged the faster into the wood, and in its shadow her grandfather,
  smiling doubtfully, said, "They like their joke, some of 'em, don't they? But
  it's always 'tiddlers'!"</p>

  <p>It grew dusk under the trees, and the sky was pale above. They came to
  where the ground fell away in a glen that was almost a trench, and a brook
  ran in the ultimate furrow. On the opposing hill a broad green ride stood
  like a wall before them, a deep moss of trees clinging at each side. Here
  they turned, and, where the glen widened, a cottage was to be seen on sloping
  ground, with a narrow roadway a little beyond it. A whitewashed cottage, so
  small that there seemed scarce a score of tiles on its roof; one of the few
  scattered habitations holding its place in the forest by right of ancient
  settlement. A little tumult of garden tumbled about the cottage&mdash;a
  jostle of cabbages, lavender, onions, wallflowers and hollyhock, confined, as
  with difficulty, by a precarious fence, patched with wood in every form of
  manufacture and in every stage of decay.</p>

  <p>"I expect mother and Johnny finished tea long ago," Bessy remarked, her
  eyes fixed on the cottage. "Why there's a light!"</p>

  <p>The path they went by grew barer of grass as it neared the cottage, and as
  they trod it, men's voices could be heard from within, and a woman's
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like visitors!" the old man exclaimed. "That's odd. I wonder
  who..."</p>

  <p>"There you are then, father!" came a female voice from the door. "Here's
  Uncle Isaac an' a gentleman come to see us." It was Bessy's mother who
  spoke&mdash;a pleasant, fresh, active woman in a print dress, who stood in
  the doorway as the old man set back the gate.</p>

  <p>The door opened into the living-room, where sat two men, while a boy of
  fourteen squeezed, abashed and a trifle sulky, in a corner. There was a smell
  of bad cigar, which had almost, but not quite, banished the wonted smell of
  the room; a smell in some degree due to camphor, though, perhaps, more to
  caterpillar; for the walls were hidden behind boxes and drawers of divers
  shapes and sizes, and before the window and in unexpected places on the floor
  stood other boxes, covered with muslin, nurseries for larvae, pupae, and
  doomed butterflies. And so many were these things that the room, itself a
  mere box, gave scant space to the three people and the little round table
  that were in it; wherefore Bessy's mother remained in the doorway, and Uncle
  Isaac, when he rose, took a very tall hat from the floor and clapped it on
  his head for lack of other safe place; for the little table sustained a load
  of cups and saucers. Uncle Isaac was a small man, though with a large face; a
  face fringed about with grey wisps of whisker, and characterised by wide and
  glassy eyes and a great tract of shaven upper lip.</p>

  <p>"Good evenin', Mr. May, good evenin'!" said Uncle Isaac, shaking hands
  with the air of a man faithful to a friend in defiance of the world. "This is
  my friend Mr. Butson."</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson was a tall, rather handsome man of forty or thereabout, with
  curly hair and whiskers, and he greeted the old man with grum
  condescension.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Butson," Uncle Isaac continued, with a wave of the hand, "is a
  gentleman at present in connection with the steamboat profession, though
  above it by fam'ly and inclination. Mr. Butson an' me 'as bin takin' a day's
  'olludy with a seleck party by name of beanfeast, in brakes."</p>

  <p>"O yes," responded old May, divesting himself of his bag; "we passed some
  of 'em by the Dun Cow, an' very merry they was, too, with concertinas, an'
  kiss-in-the-ring, an' what not&mdash;very gay."</p>

  <p>"O damn, no," growled the distinguished Butson. "Not that low lot. He
  means that coster crowd in vans," he added, for Uncle Isaac's enlightenment.
  "I ain't fell as low as that. Lor, no." He sucked savagely at the butt of his
  cigar, found it extinct, looked vainly for somewhere to fling it, and at last
  dropped it into a teacup.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. May, no; not them lot," Uncle Isaac said, with a touch of grave
  reproof. "As a man of some little property meself, an' in company of Mr.
  Butson, by nature genteel-disposed, I should be far from mixin' with such. We
  come down with the shipwrights an' engineers from Lawsonses. That was prob'ly
  Mr. May's little joke, Mr. Butson. Mr. May is a man of property hisself,
  besides a man of science, as I think I told you. This 'ere land an' residence
  bein' in pint. If any man was to come an' say to Mr. May, 'Git out o' that
  property, Mr. May,' what would the law say to that man? Null-avoid. That's
  what the lawr 'ud say. It 'ud say, 'Git out yerself, your claim's
  nullavoid.'" Uncle Isaac, checking a solemn thump at the table just in time
  to save the tea-cups, took his hat off instead, and put it on again.</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson grunted "Ah!" and Mrs. May, taking the net, squeezed in, with
  Bessy behind her. "I'll put a few o' these boxes on the stairs, an' make more
  room," she said. "The kettle's still boiling in the backhouse, an' I'll make
  some more tea."</p>

  <p>Bessy had a habit of shyness in presence of strangers, and Uncle Isaac
  ranked as one, for it was two years at least since he had been there before.
  Indeed, what she remembered of him then made her the shyer. For he had
  harangued her very loudly on the gratitude she owed her grandfather, calling
  her a cripple very often in course of his argument, and sometimes a burden.
  She knew that she was a cripple and a burden, but to be held tightly by the
  arm and told so, by a gentleman with such a loud voice and such large eyes as
  Uncle Isaac, somehow inclined her to cry. So now, as soon as might be, she
  joined her brother, and the two retreated into the shadowy corner between the
  stairfoot and the backhouse door.</p>

  <p>The old butterfly-hunter, too, was shy in his more elderly way. Beyond his
  widowed daughter-in-law and her two children he had scarce an acquaintance,
  or at least none more familiar than the naturalists in London to whom he sold
  his specimens. So that now, in presence of this very genteel Mr. Butson, who,
  he feared, was already disgusted at the humble character of the
  establishment, he made but a hollow meal. A half-forgotten notion afflicted
  him, that it was proper to drink tea in only one of two possible ways; but
  whether from the cup or from the saucer he could not resolve himself. Mr.
  Butson had finished his tea, so that his example was lacking: though indeed
  the lees in his saucer seemed to offer a hint&mdash;a hint soon triumphantly
  confirmed by Uncle Isaac, who was nothing averse from a supplementary cup,
  and who emptied it straightway into his saucer and gulped ardently, glaring
  fearfully over the edge. Whereat his host drank from the saucer also, and
  took heed to remember for the future. Still he was uncomfortable, and a
  little later he almost blushed at detecting himself inhospitably grateful for
  signs that Mr. Butson began to tire of the visit. Meanwhile he modestly
  contributed little to the conversation.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Butson gloomily after a long pause, and in reply to nothing
  in particular, "<i>I</i> ain't a man of property. I wish I was. If people got
  what they was brought up to&mdash;but there!" He stuck his hands lower in his
  pockets and savagely regarded vacancy.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Butson's uncle," said Uncle Isaac, "is a mayor. A mayor. An' 'is
  other relations is of almost equal aristocracy. But 'e won't 'ave nothin' to
  say to 'em, not a word. It's jist blood&mdash;pride o' breedin'. But what I
  say is, it may be proper self-respeck, but it ain't proper self-justice. It
  ain't self-justice, in my way o' puttin' it. Why 'e won't even name 'em!
  Won't name 'em, Mr. May!"</p>

  <p>"Won't he?" the old man answered, rather tamely, "dear, dear!" Mr. Butson
  laid his head back, jerked his chin, and snorted scorn at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;won't as much as name 'em, such is 'is lawfty contemp'.
  Otherwise, what 'ud be my path of dooty? My path of dooty on behalf of
  self-justice to Mr. Butson would be to see 'em an' put a pint o' argument.
  'Ere, I puts it, is 'im, an' 'ere is me. 'Ere is Mr. 'Enery Butson, your very
  dootiful relation of fash'nable instinks, an' a engineer than which none
  better though much above it, an' unsuitably enchained by worldly
  circumstances in the engine-room of a penny steamer." (Here Mr. Butson
  snorted again.) "Likewise 'ere is me, a elderly man of some small property,
  an' a shipwright of practical experience. Them circumstances bein' the case,
  cons'kently, what more nachral an' proper than a
  partnership&mdash;<i>with</i> capital. That's 'ow I'd put the pint; a
  partnership <i>with</i> capital."</p>

  <p>"Jus' so," said old May. And seeing that the other still paused, he added
  "Of course."</p>

  <p>"But 'e's proud&mdash;proud!" said Uncle Isaac, shaking his head
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>"P'raps I am proud," Mr. Butson admitted candidly, "I s'pose I got my
  faults. But I wouldn't take a penny from 'em&mdash;not if they was to beg me
  on their knees. Why I'd sooner be be'olding to strangers!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that 'e would," sighed Uncle Isaac. "But it ain't self-justice. No,
  it ain't self-justice!"</p>

  <p>"It's self-respect, any'ow," said Mr. Butson sullenly. "If they like to
  treat me unnatural, let 'em."</p>

  <p>"Ah," observed Uncle Isaac, "some fam'lies is unnachral an' some is
  nachral, an' there's a deal o' difference between 'em. Look at Mr. May now.
  'E ain't altogether in my family, though my niece's father-in-law by
  marriage. But what nachralness! His son was a engineer in yer own trade, Mr.
  Butson,&mdash;fitter at Maidment's. 'E left my niece a widder, cons'kence of
  a coat-tail in a cog wheel. What does Mr. May do? Why 'e shows 'is
  nachralness. 'E brings 'er an' 'er children down 'ere on 'is own free'old
  residence, an' cons'kently&mdash;'ere they are. Look at that!"</p>

  <p>It was a principle with Uncle Isaac to neglect no opportunity of reciting
  at large the excellences of any person of the smallest importance with whom
  he might be acquainted; or the excellences which that person might be
  supposed to desire credit for: if in his actual presence, so much the better.
  Nothing could be cheaper, and on the whole it paid very well. At worst, it
  advertised an amiable character; and there remained off-chances of personal
  benefit. Moreover the practice solidified Uncle Isaac's reputation among his
  acquaintances. For here, quoth each in his turn, was plainly a man of
  sagacious discernment. The old postman, however, was merely uneasy. To his
  mind it was nothing but a matter of course that when his son died, the widow
  and children should come under his own roof, and it was as a matter of course
  that he had brought them there. But Bessy's mother said simply:&mdash;"Yes,
  gran'dad's been a good one to us, always." She, as well as the children,
  called him "gran'dad."</p>

  <p>"Yes," proceeded Uncle Isaac, "an' 'im with as much to think about as a
  man of edication too&mdash;wonderful. Why there's nothink as 'e don't know in
  astronomy an'&mdash;an'&mdash;an' insectonomy. Nothink!"</p>

  <p>"No, not astronomy," interjected old May, a little startled by both counts
  of the imputation. "Not astronomy, Mr. Mundy."</p>

  <p>"I say yes," answered Uncle Isaac, with an emphatic slap on the knee.
  "Modesty under a bushel's all very well, Mr. May, all very well, but I
  know&mdash;I know! Astronomy, an' medicamedica an' all the other classics. I
  know! Ah, I'd give best part o' my small property, sich as it is, for 'alf
  your edication, Mr. May!"</p>

  <p>It was generally agreed in the family that Uncle Isaac was very "close" as
  to this small property of his. Nothing could induce him to speak of it with
  any particularity of detail, and opinions varied as to its character. Still,
  whatever it was, it sufficed to gain Uncle Isaac much deference and
  consideration&mdash;the more, probably, because of its mysterious character;
  a deference and a consideration which Uncle Isaac could stimulate from time
  to time by cloudy allusions to altering his will.</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Mr. Butson rising from his chair, "education never done
  me much good."</p>

  <p>"No, unforchnately!" commented Uncle Isaac.</p>

  <p>"An' I'd prefer property meself." Mr. Butson made toward the door, and
  Uncle Isaac prepared to follow.</p>

  <p>At this moment a harsh female voice suddenly screamed from the darkness
  without. "Lor'! I almost fell over a blessed 'ousel," it said, and there was
  a shrill laugh. "We'll ask 'em the way back."</p>

  <p>Old May stepped over the threshold at the sound; but the magnificence was
  stricken from the face of Mr. Batson. His cheeks paled, his mouth and eyes
  opened together, and he shrank back, even toward the stairfoot. Nobody marked
  him, however, but the children, for attention was directed without.</p>

  <p>"Djear! which way to the Dun Cow?"</p>

  <p>"See the lane?" answered the old postman. "Follow that to the right an'
  you'll come to it. It's a bit farther than through the wood, but ye can't go
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Right!" There were two women and a man. The screaming woman said
  something to the others in a quieter tone, in which, however, the word
  "tiddlers" was plain to hear, and there was a laugh. "Good-night, ole chap,"
  she bawled back. "Put 'em in a jam-pot with a bit o' water-creese!"</p>

  <p>"Full o' their games!" remarked the old man with a tolerant smile, as he
  turned toward the door. "That was the person as said I'd catch it for gettin'
  my clothes wet, as we came past the Dun Cow."</p>

  <p>The voices of the beanfeasters abated and ceased, and now Mr. Butson left
  no doubt of his readiness to depart. "Come," he said, with chap-fallen
  briskness, "we'll 'ave to git back to the others; they'll be goin'." He took
  leave with so much less dignity and so much more haste than accorded with his
  earlier manner that Mr. May was a trifle puzzled, though he soon forgot
  it.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Mr. May, I wish you good-night," said Uncle Isaac, shaking
  hands impressively. "I've greatly enjoyed your flow of conversation, Mr.
  May." He made after the impatient Butson, stopped half-way to the gate and
  called gently:&mdash;"Nan!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, uncle," Mrs. May replied, stepping out to him. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac whispered gravely in her ear, and she returned and whispered
  to the old man. "Of course&mdash;certainly," he said, looking mightily
  concerned, as he re-entered the cottage.</p>

  <p>Mrs. May reached a cracked cup from a shelf, and, turning over a few
  coppers, elicited a half-crown. With this she returned to Uncle Isaac.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a note of it," said Uncle Isaac as he pocketed the money, "and
  send a postal-order."</p>

  <p>"O, don't trouble about that, Uncle Isaac!" For Uncle Isaac, with the
  small property, must not be offended in a matter of a half-crown.</p>

  <p>"What? Trouble?" he ejaculated, deeply pained. "To pay my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Ere&mdash;come on!" growled Mr. Butson savagely from the outer gloom.
  "Come on!" And they went together, taking the lane in the direction opposite
  to that lately used by the noisy woman.</p>

  <p>"Well," old May observed, "we don't often have visitors, an' I was glad to
  see your Uncle Isaac, Nan. An' Mr. Butson, too," he added impartially.</p>

  <p>"Yes," returned Bessy's mother innocently. "Such a gentleman, isn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I forgot," the old man said suddenly. "I might ha'
  asked 'em to take a drop o' beer 'fore they went."</p>

  <p>"They had some while they was waitin' for tea. An'&mdash;an' I don't think
  there's much left." She dragged a large tapped jar from under the
  breeding-box at the window, and it was empty.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" was all the old man's comment, as he surveyed the jar
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned into the back-house and emerged with a tin pot and a
  brush. "I'm a goin' treaclin' a bit," he said. "Come, Johnny?"</p>

  <p>The boy pulled his cap from his pocket, fetched a lantern, and was
  straightway ready, while Bessy sat to her belated tea.</p>

  <p>The last pale light lay in the west, and the evening offered up an
  oblation of sweet smells. All things that feed by night were out, and nests
  were silent save for once and again a sleepy twitter. Every moment another
  star peeped, and then one more. The boy and the old man walked up the slope
  among the trees, pausing now at one, now at another, to daub the bark with
  the mixture of rum and treacle that was in the pot.</p>

  <p>"It's always best to be careful where you treacle when there's holiday
  folk about," said Johnny's grandfather. "They don't understand it. Often I've
  treaded a log or a stump and found a couple sittin' on it when I came
  back&mdash;with new dresses, and sich. It's no good explainin'&mdash;they
  think it's all done for practical jokin'. It's best to go on an' take no
  notice. I've heard 'em say:&mdash;'Don't the country smell
  lovely?'&mdash;meanin' the smell o' the rum an' treacle they was a-sittin'
  on. But when they find it&mdash;lor, the language I <i>have</i> heard!
  Awful!"...</p>

  <p>The boy was quiet almost all the round. Presently he said, "Gran'dad, do
  you <i>really</i> like that likeness I made of mother?"</p>

  <p>"Like it, my boy? Why o' course. It's a nobby picture!"</p>

  <p>"Uncle Isaac said it was bad."</p>

  <p>"O!" There was a thoughtful pause while they tramped toward the next tree.
  "That's only Uncle Isaac's little game, Johnny. You mustn't mind that. It's
  <i>a</i> nobby picture."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe Uncle Isaac knows anything about it," said the boy
  vehemently. "I think he's ignorant."</p>

  <p>"Here, Johnny, Johnny!" cried his grandfather. "That won't do, you know.
  Not at all. You mustn't say things like that."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what I <i>think,</i> gran'dad. An' I know he says things
  wrong. When he came before he said that ship I drew was bad&mdash;an'
  I&mdash;I very near cried." (He did cry, but that was in secret, and not to
  be confessed.) "But now," Johnny went on, "I'm fourteen, an' I know better. I
  don't believe Uncle Isaac knows a bit about things."</p>

  <p>They had come again to the tree first treaded, and, leaving the pot and
  brush at its foot, the old man, by help of the lantern, took certain of the
  moths that had been attracted. From this he carried the lantern to the next
  tree in the round and then to the next, filling the intervals between his
  moth-captures with successive chapters of a mild and rather vague lecture on
  respect for elders.</p>

  <p>It was dark night now, and the sky all a-dust with stars. The old man and
  the boy took their way more by use than by sight amid the spectral presences
  of the trees, whose infinite whispering filled the sharpening air. They
  emerged on high ground, whence could be seen, here the lights of Loughton and
  there the lights of Woodford, and others more distant in the flatter country.
  Here the night wind swept up lustily from all Essex, and away from far on the
  Robin Hood Road came a rumble and a murmur, and presently the glare of
  hand-lights red and green, the sign and token of homing beanfeasters.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some while a problem had confronted the inmates of the
  cottage, and now it was ever with them: the choice of a trade for Johnny. The
  situation of the cottage itself made the main difficulty. There was a walk of
  two miles to the nearest railway station, and then London was twelve miles
  off. It was in London that trades were learnt; but to get there? Here the
  family must stay, for here was the cottage, which cost no rent, for the old
  man had bought it with his little savings. Moreover, here also were the
  butterflies and the moths, which meant butter to the dry bread of the little
  pension; and here was the garden. To part with Johnny altogether was more
  than his mother could face, and, indeed, what was to pay for his lodging and
  keep?</p>

  <p>The moths and butterflies could be no living for Johnny. To begin with,
  though he was always ready to help in the hatching, killing, setting, and
  what not, he was no born insect-hunter, like his grandfather; and then the
  old man had long realised that the forest was growing a poorer and poorer
  hunting-ground each year, and must some day (after he was dead, he hoped) be
  no longer worth working. People were hard on the hawks, so that insect-eating
  birds multiplied apace, and butterflies were fewer. And there was something
  else, or so it seemed&mdash;some subtle influence from the great smoky
  province that lay to the south-west. For London grew and grew, and washed
  nearer and still nearer its scummy edge of barren brickbats and clinkers. It
  had passed Stratford long since, and had nearly reached Leyton. And though
  Leyton was eight miles off, still the advancing town sent something before
  it&mdash;an odour, a subtle principle&mdash;that drove off the butterflies.
  The old man had once taken the Emperor Moth at Stratford, in a place long
  covered with a row of grimy little houses; now the Emperor was none too easy
  to find in the thickest of the woodland. And, indeed, when the wind came from
  the south-west the air seemed less clear, in the old man's eyes, than was its
  wont a dozen years back. True, many amateurs came with nets&mdash;boys from
  boarding-schools thereabout, chiefly&mdash;and did not complain. But he, who
  by trade had noted day by day for many years the forest's produce in egg,
  larva, pupa, and imago, saw and knew the change. So that butterflies being
  beyond possibility as Johnny's trade, his grandfather naturally bethought him
  of the one other he himself was familiar with, and spoke of the post-office.
  He knew the postmaster at Longhton, and the postmasters at other of the
  villages about the forest. By making a little interest Johnny might take the
  next vacancy as messenger. But the prospect did not tempt the boy. He
  protested, and it was almost his sole contribution to the daily discussion,
  that he wanted to <i>make</i> something; and there was little doubt, if one
  might judge from the unpleasing ships and figures in coloured chalks
  wherewith he defaced whatever offered a fair surface, that he would most like
  to make pictures. He never urged the choice in plain terms, for that were
  hopeless: but both his mother and his grandfather condemned it in all
  respects as though he did.</p>

  <p>"There's a deal more caterpillar than butterfly in this life for the likes
  of us, my boy," the old man would say, as he laboured at his setting. "Makin'
  pictures an' such is all very well, but we can't always choose our own line.
  I've bin a lucky man in my time, thank God. The insects was my hobby long
  'fore I made any money of 'em. Your poor gran'mother that you never saw, 'A
  lot o' good them moths an' grubs'll be to you,' she used to say. 'Why not
  bees, as you can make somethin' out of?' An' Haskins, that took the next
  round to mine, he kep' bees. But I began sellin' a few specimens to gentlemen
  here an' there, an' then more, an' after that I took 'em to London reg'lar,
  same as now. It ain't as good as it was, an' it's goin' to be worse, but I'm
  in hopes it'll last my time out. It was because I was carryin' letters here
  that I had the chance o' doin' it at all. If you was to carry 'em yourself,
  you'd be able to do something else too&mdash;bees p'raps. A good few mends
  boots, but we're a bit off the villages here. Here's the house&mdash;yours
  an' your mother's when I'm gone, an' I'm sixty-nine; an' it's healthier an'
  cleaner than London. You could put up a little bit o' glass in the garden an'
  grow tomatoes an' cucumbers. Them&mdash;an' fowls&mdash;you could keep
  fowls&mdash;would sell very well to the gentlefolk, an' they all know the
  postman. Wages ain't high, but you live cheap here, with no rent, and there's
  a pension, p'raps. That's your line, depend on it, Johnny."</p>

  <p>"But I should like a trade where I could <i>make</i> something," the boy
  would answer wistfully. "I really should, gran'dad."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"&mdash;with a shake of the head&mdash;"make what? I doubt but you're
  meanin' pictures. You must get that notion out of your head, Johnny. Some of
  them as make 'em may do well, but most's awful. I see 'em in London often,
  drorin' on the pavement; reg'lar clever ones, too, doin' mackerel an' bits o'
  salmon splendid, and likenesses o' the Queen, an' sunsets, with the sky
  shaded beautiful. Beggin'! Reg'lar beggin', with a cap out for coppers, an'
  'Help gifted poverty' wrote in chalk. <i>That</i> won't do, ye know,
  Johnny."</p>

  <p>The boy's mother felt for him an indefinite ambition not to be realised by
  a life of letter-carrying, though picture-making she favoured as little as
  did the old man. But there was the situation of the cottage&mdash;a hindrance
  they could see no way to overcome. This being so, they left it for the time,
  and betook themselves to smaller difficulties. Putting the letter-carrying
  aside for the moment, and forgetting distance as an obstacle, what trades
  were there to choose from? Truly a good many: and that none should be missed,
  Johnny's grandfather took paper and a pencil and walked to Woodford, where he
  begged use of a London Directory and read through all the trades, from
  Absorbent Cotton Wool Manufacturers to Zincographic Printers, making a
  laborious list as he went, omitting (with some reluctance) such items as
  Bankers, Brokers&mdash;Stock and Share&mdash;Merchants, Patentees, and
  Physicians, and hesitating a little over such as Aeronauts and Shive Turners.
  The task filled a large part of three days of uncommonly hard work, and old
  David May finished his list in mental bedevilment. What <i>was</i> a Shive
  Turner? Indeed, for that matter, what was an Ammeter?</p>

  <p>The list did but multiply confusion and divide counsel. Nan May sang less
  at her house-work now, thinking of what she could remember of the trades that
  began with Absorbent Cotton Wool Manufacture and ended with Zincographic
  Printing. Little Bess neglected the bookshelf, and pored over the crabbed
  catalogue with earnest incomprehension. It afflicted Johnny himself with a
  feeling akin to terror, for which he found it hard to account. The arena of
  the struggle for bread was so vast, and he so small a combatant to choose a
  way into the scrimmage! More, it seemed all so unattractive. There could be
  little to envy in the daily life of a Seed Crusher or a Court Plaster Maker.
  But the old man would pin a sheet of the list to the wall and study it while
  he worked within doors: full of patience and simple courage.</p>

  <p>"Bakin' Powder Maker," he would call aloud to whomsoever it might reach.
  "How's that? That's makin' something..."</p>

  <p>Sometimes Bob Smallpiece, the forest keeper, would look in on his way by
  the cottage and be consulted. Bob was an immense being in much leather and
  velveteen, with a face like a long-kept pippin. When he first came to the
  forest, years back, his amiable peeps into the house may have been prompted
  by professional considerations, for it was his habit to keep an eye on
  solitary cottages in his walk: cottages wherein it had once or twice been his
  luck to spy by surprise some furry little heap that a poke of his ash stick
  had separated into dead rabbits. Indeed, had old May's tastes lain that way,
  nothing would have been easier for him than to set a snare or two at night as
  he hunted his moths. But soon the keeper found that this one, at least, of
  the cottagers thereabouts was no poacher, and then his greetings were as
  friendly as they seemed. As to Johnny's trade, he had few ideas beyond one
  that butchers did very well in London: his sister having married one. And
  what a Shive Turner or an Ammeter might be he knew no more than his stick.
  But he knew well enough what a poacher was (as also, perhaps, did the stick,
  if contact could teach it); and he counselled that the boy be kept away from
  certain "lots"&mdash;as the "Blandy lot," the "Honeywell lot," and the "Hayes
  lot"&mdash;who would do him no good. The old butterfly-hunter knew these
  "lots" very well on his own account; and his perpetual gropings about banks
  and undergrowth made him no friends among them. They would scarce believe,
  even after long experience, that grubs alone accounted for his activity; and
  truly, a man with a government pension, who affected scientific tastes, who
  lived a clean life, who was called "Mr. May" by keepers, and who, moreover,
  had such uncommon opportunities of witnessing what passed in the woods, might
  well be an object of suspicion. In simple truth, the village loafers had
  small conception of the old man's knowledge of their behaviour among the
  rabbit burrows. He knew the woods as they knew the inwards of a quart pot,
  and his eyes, aged as they might be, were trained by years of search for
  things well-nigh invisible amid grass, leaves, and undergrowths. He could
  have found their wires blindfold, and he knew Joe Blandy's wires from Amos
  Honeywell's better than Joe and Amos themselves. But of all this he said
  nothing, holding himself a strict neutral, and judging it best never to seem
  too knowing. Still it was the fact that when the "lots" were periodically
  weeded of members caught with disjoinable guns, wire nooses, or dead things
  furred or feathered, those left behind were apt to link circumstances
  together, and to regard the old man with doubt and ill-favour. Once, indeed,
  he hung in doubt for days, much tempted to carry a hint to Bob Smallpiece of
  a peculiarly foul and barbarous manner of deer-stealing, wherein figured a
  tied fawn, an anxious doe, a heavy stone, a broken leg, and a cut throat. But
  it chanced that the keeper was otherwise aware, and old May's doubt was
  determined by news that the thief, waled and gory (for he had made a fight
  for it), had been brought to the police-cells, with a dripping doe on a truck
  behind him. Even now as Bob Smallpiece grinned in at the cottage door one saw
  the gap where two teeth had gone in that "up-and-downer."</p>

  <p>"No," said the keeper, "it won't do the boy no good to let him knock about
  with nothing to do. 'Bout here, specially. Boys that knocks about this part
  mostly gets in wi' them lots as we bin speakin' of, or something about as
  bad. Ain't there no gentleman hereabout 'ud give him a job?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like him to learn a trade," the old man said anxiously, "but I don't
  see how. It's always somethin' to stand by, is a trade, an' it's what he
  wants. Wants to make somethin'&mdash;that's the way <i>he</i> puts it. Else
  I'd say post-office, same as me."</p>

  <p>"His father was in the engineerin'," remarked Mrs. May, who had arrived at
  the door with certain sticks of rhubarb from the garden. "I'd like him to go
  to that, I think; but he can't, from here."</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece knew nothing of engineering, and little more of any other
  of the several trades read out from the list pinned to the window-frame near
  which the old man worked at a setting-stick. And presently be departed on his
  walk. Bessy at the casement above saw him swing away toward the glen, lifting
  his stick in recognition of Johnny, who bore a bundle of dead sticks
  homeward.</p>

  <p>Johnny's mother peeled and cut the rhubarb, revolving impossible
  expedients for bridging the space between them and London: the space that
  looked so small on the map, but was so great an obstacle to their purposes,
  and so wide a division between the two modes of life she knew. Johnny's
  grandfather pinned and strapped deftly, deep in thought. Presently, looking
  up, "It beats me," he said, fearful of ignoring some good thing in trades,
  "to guess what a Shive Turner is!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">SO life went at the cottage. For a little while they looked
  for another visit from Uncle Isaac; since, as he sent no postal order, it was
  felt that he must defer the return of the half-crown merely because he
  contemplated an early payment in person. But weeks passed and nothing was
  heard of him, nor seen. Meantime the problem of Johnny's trade met no
  solution. He had left school nearly three months now, and, the thing seeming
  desperate, he had well-nigh resolved to give in to the post-office. At the
  thought London seemed a far and wondrous place whereto he could never attain;
  and awe of the terrible list his grandfather had compiled from the London
  Directory, became longing for the least inviting trade in the collection. He
  had his memories of London, too, and they were more numerous and more
  pleasant than Bessy's. There he could see, from his bedroom window, the masts
  of many ships, quite close. In the strong winds (and in his remembered London
  the weather was ever cold, brisk, dry, and windy) the masts bent and rocked
  gravely, the ropes bellied, and the blocks whistled aloud. At nights he lay
  and heard the yards groan and the cordage creak and rattle. Just by the
  corner, ships sometimes thrust prying jib-booms clean over the dock wall, as
  if to see what a town was like; and often he had stood in the street to watch
  men climbing the rigging and hanging bent over spars, like earwigs. He had
  gone shopping, too, gripping tight at his mother's skirts, in flaring
  market-streets, where everybody shouted at once, and there were mountains of
  bulls'-eyes and peppermint on barrows. There was a street with shops on one
  side and a blank wall on the other; and over and behind this wall, lifted
  high in the air, was the monstrous skeleton of a great ship. Men swarmed like
  ants about the skeleton, and all day hammers went with a mighty clangour, and
  great lights flared at night. There were big blank walls at all the places
  where they made ships, and he could remember a little door in one such wall,
  a door beyond which he greatly desired to see. But it was rarely opened, and
  then but a little way, by an ill-natured old man, who squeezed through and
  closed it very quickly. So that Johnny believed he must issue thus to prevent
  the escape of some small and active animal, imprisoned within. All that
  Johnny remembered of his father was that he wiped his oily hands on cotton
  waste: a curious stuff&mdash;like a great deal of soft sewing-thread in a
  hopeless tangle&mdash;that he had never seen since. That and the funeral:
  when he rode in a carriage with a crape bow pinned to his new jacket, and his
  mother held his hand very tight at the grave-side. Most of his memories were
  of the streets, and some revived after long oblivion: as when the smell of
  roasted chestnuts brought a vision of a glowing coke fire by the corner of
  the ship-yard wall, with a pock-marked man behind it whom he would know
  anywhere now. And he was not to return to this place of wistful memory after
  all, nor to learn to make a ship nor an engine&mdash;let alone a picture.</p>

  <p>The weeks went, and berries hung where flowers had been. Johnny and Bessy
  made their yearly harvest of blackberries, some for puddings and jam at home,
  some to sell at such kitchen doors as might receive them. Until an afternoon
  in early October: when, with an order from a lady at Theydon, they betook
  themselves in search of sloes.</p>

  <p>Warm colours touched the woods to a new harmony, and seen from high
  ground, they lay like flower-beds in green and red, yellow and brown. The
  honeysuckle bloomed its second time, and toadstools stood in crimson
  companies in the shade of the trees. Sloes were rare this year near home, so
  the children searched their way through the Wake Valley to Honey Lane
  Quarters, and there they found their sloes, though few.</p>

  <p>It was a long and scratchy task; and, when it was finished, they were well
  up in St. Thomas's Quarters, and the sun was setting. They made the best of
  their way back as far as the road near the Dun Cow, and there parted. For
  Bessy was tired and hungry, and though Johnny was little better, he resolved
  to carry his sloes fresh to Theydon and get the money, since he was already a
  little on the way. So Bessy turned up the lane that led to the cottage, and
  Johnny took to the woods again for Theydon, by way to right of Wormleyton
  Pits.</p>

  <p>Dusk was growing to dark, but the boy stepped fearlessly, well knowing his
  path. The last throstle sang his last evensong for the year, and was still.
  The shadowy trees, so living and so silent about him: the wrestling trunks of
  beeches, the reaching arms of oak and hornbeam, all struck at gaze as though
  pausing in their everlasting struggle to watch and whisper as he passed: and
  the black depths between them: might well have oppressed the imagination of
  such a boy from other parts; but Johnny tramped along among them little
  heeding, thinking of the great ship-haunted London he longed for, and
  forecasting nothing of the blow that should fall but in that hour and send
  him the journey sorrowing.</p>

  <p>Presently he was aware of a light ahead. It moved a foot or two from the
  ground, and Johnny knew its swing. Then it stopped, resting by a tree root.
  "You, gran'dad?" called Johnny, and "Hullo!" came the old man's voice in
  answer.</p>

  <p>The old man had cut a leaf, with a caterpillar on it, from a shrub, and
  was packing it in a pill-box. "Out for a few night-feeders," he explained, as
  the boy stopped beside him. "But you ain't been home to tea," he added.
  "Takin' home the sloes? Might ha' left 'em till the morning, John,
  easy,&mdash;now you've got 'em."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I come up from over there"&mdash;Johnny made a vague toss of the
  arm&mdash;"an' I thought I might as well cut across to Theydon first. Bess
  went up the lane. I'll be home 'fore ye now, gran'dad, 'nless you 're goin'
  back straight."</p>

  <p>"I won't be long behind ye; I'm just goin' to the Pits. I can't make
  nothin' o' them I took last night, under the brambles an'
  heather,&mdash;never saw the like before quite; so I'm goin' to see if
  there's more, an' get all I can."</p>

  <p>They walked together a few yards, till the trees thinned. "You'll go
  'cross the Slade," said the old man. "Step it, or you'll be beat!"</p>

  <p>"I'll step it," the boy answered. "I want my tea."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>He was trotting home by the lane from Theydon, with his empty basket on
  his arm, and his hands (and the sixpence) in his trousers pockets, when he
  checked at a sound, as of a cry from the wood. But he heard no more, and
  trotted on. Probably the deer were fighting somewhere; rare fighters were the
  bucks in October.</p>

  <p class="first">JOHNNY had finished his tea, and was lying at his ease in
  the old easy-chair, whistling, rattling his heels on the hearth, and studying
  a crack in the ceiling that suggested an angry face. Mrs. May had put the
  sixpence the sloes had brought into the cracked teacup that still awaited the
  return of Uncle Isaac's half-crown, had washed the tea-things, and was now
  mending the worn collar of gran'dad's great-coat, in readiness for the
  winter. Bessy had fallen asleep over her book, had been wakened, had fallen
  asleep again, and in the end had drowsily climbed the stairs to early bed:
  but still the old man did not return.</p>

  <p>"I wonder gran'dad ain't back yet," Johnny's mother said for the third
  time. "He said he'd be quick, so's to finish that case to-night." This was a
  glass-topped mahogany box, in course of setting with specimens of all the
  Sphinges: a special private order.</p>

  <p>"'Spect he can't find them caterpillars he went for," Johnny conjectured;
  "that's what it is. He's forgot all about racin' me home."</p>

  <p>Mrs. May finished the collar, lifted the coat by the loop, and turned it
  about in search of rents. Finding none, she put it down and stood at the
  door, listening. "Think you're too tired to go an' look for him, Johnny?" she
  asked presently.</p>

  <p>Johnny thought he was. "It's them caterpillars, safe enough," he said. "He
  never saw any before, an' it was just a chance last night. To-night he can't
  find 'em, and he's keepin' on searchin' all over the Pits and the Slade;
  that's about it."</p>

  <p>There was another pause, till Mrs. May remembered something. "The bit o'
  candle he had in the lantern wouldn't last an hour," she said. "He'd ha' had
  to come back for more. Johnny, I'm gettin' nervous."</p>

  <p>"Why, what for?" asked Johnny, though the circumstance of the short candle
  startled his confidence. "He might get a light from somewhere else, 'stead o'
  comin' all the way back."</p>

  <p>"But where?" asked Mrs. May. "There's only the Dun Cow, an' he might
  almost as well come home&mdash;besides, he wouldn't ask 'em."</p>

  <p>Johnny left the chair, and joined his mother at the door. As they listened
  a more regular sound made itself plain, amid the low hum of the trees;
  footsteps. "Here he comes," said Johnny.</p>

  <p>But the sound neared and the steps were long and the tread was heavy. In a
  few moments Bob Smallpiece's voice came from the gloom, wishing them
  good-night.</p>

  <p>Mrs. May called to him. "Have you seen gran'dad anywhere, Mr.
  Smallpiece?"</p>

  <p>The keeper checked his strides, and came to the garden gate, piebald with
  the light from the cottage door. "No," he said, "I ain't run across him, nor
  seen his light anywheres. Know which way he went?"</p>

  <p>"He was just going to Wormleyton Pits an' back, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've just come straight across the Pits, an' as straight here as
  ever I could go, past the Dun Cow; an' ain't seen ne'er a sign of him. Want
  him particular?"</p>

  <p>"I'm gettin' nervous about him, Mr. Smallpiecesomehow I'm frightened
  to-night. He went out about six, an' now it don't want much to nine, an' he
  only had a bit o' candle that wouldn't bum an hour. And he never meant
  stopping long, I know, 'cause of a case he's got to set. I thought p'raps you
  might ha' seen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I see nothin' of him. But I'll go back to the Pits now, if you like,
  an' welcome."</p>

  <p>"I'd be sorry to bother you, but I <i>would</i> like someone to go. Here,
  Johnny, go along, there's a good boy."</p>

  <p>"All right, all right," the keeper exclaimed cheerfully. "We'll go
  together. I expect he's invented some new speeches o' moth, an' he's forgot
  all about his light, thinkin' out the improvements. It ain't the first time
  <i>he's</i> been out o' night about here, anyhow. Not likely to lose himself,
  is Mr. May."</p>

  <p>Johnny had his cap and was at the gate; and in a moment the keeper and he
  were mounting the slope.</p>

  <p>"Mother's worryin' herself over nothing to-night," Johnny grumbled.
  "Gran'dad's been later 'n this many's a time, an' she never said a word. Why,
  when he gets after caterpillars an' things he forgets everything."</p>

  <p>They walked on among the trees. Presently, "How long is it since your
  father died?" Bob Smallpiece asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Nine years, now, and more."</p>

  <p>"Mother might ha' married agen, I s'pose?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. Very likely. Never heard her say nothing."</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece walked on with no more reply than a grunt. Soon a light
  from the Dun Cow twinkled through the bordering coppice, and in a few paces
  they were up at the wood's edge.</p>

  <p>"No light along the road," the keeper said, glancing to left and right,
  and making across the hard gravel.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody," Johnny exclaimed, pointing up the pale road.</p>

  <p>"Drunk," objected the other. And truly the indistinct figure staggered and
  floundered. "An' goin' the wrong way. Chap just out o' the Dun Cow. Come
  on."</p>

  <p>But Johnny's gaze did not shift. "It's gran'dad!" he cried suddenly, and
  started running.</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece sprang after him, and in twenty paces they were running
  abreast. As they neared the old man they could hear him talking rapidly, in a
  monotonous, high-pitched voice; he was hatless, and though they called he
  took no heed, but stumbled on as one seeing and hearing nothing; till, as the
  keeper reached to seize his arm, he trod in a gulley and fell forward.</p>

  <p>The shock interrupted his talk, and he breathed heavily, staring still
  before him, as he regained his uncertain foothold, and reeled a step farther.
  Then Bob Smallpiece grasped him above the elbow, and shouted his name.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, gran'dad?" Johnny demanded. "Ill?"</p>

  <p>The old man glared fixedly, and made as though to resume his course.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's this?" said Bob Smallpiece, retaining the arm, and lifting a
  hand gently to the old man's hair. It was blood, dotted and trickling. "Lord!
  he's had a bad wipe over the head," said Bob, and with that lifted old May in
  his arms, as a nurse lifts a child. "They-don's nearest; run, Johnny
  boy&mdash;run like blazes an' fetch the doctor tantivy!"</p>

  <p>"Take him into the Dun Cow?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;home's best, an' save shiftin' him twice. Run it!"</p>

  <p>"Purple Emperors an' Small Coppers," began the old man again in his shrill
  chatter. "Small Coppers an' Marsh Ringlets everywhere, and my bag full o'
  letters at the beginning of the round, but I finished my round and now
  they're all gone; all gone because o' London comin', an' I give in my empty
  bag&mdash;" and so he tailed off into indistinguishable gabble, while Bob
  Small-piece carried him into the wood.</p>

  <p>To Johnny, scudding madly toward Theydon, it imparted a grotesque horror,
  as of some absurd nightmare, this baby-babble of his white-haired
  grandfather, carried baby-fashion. He blinked as he ran, and felt his head
  for his cap, half believing that he ran in a dream in very truth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. MAY still stood at the cottage door, and the keeper,
  warned by the light, called from a little distance. "Here we are, Mrs. May,"
  he said, as cheerfully as might be. "He's all right&mdash;just had a little
  accident, that's all. So I'm carryin' him. Don't be frightened; get a little
  water&mdash;I think he's got a bit of a cut on the head. But it's nothing to
  fluster about."...And so assuring and protesting, Bob brought the old man
  in.</p>

  <p>The woman saw the staring grey face and the blood. "O-o-o&mdash;my God!"
  she quavered, stricken sick and pale. "He's&mdash;he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no. No, no! Keep steady and help. Shift the table, an' I'll put him
  down on the rug."</p>

  <p>She mastered herself, and said no more. The old man, whose babble had sunk
  to an indistinct mutter, was no sooner laid on the floor than he made a vague
  effort to rise, as though to continue on his way. But he was feebler than
  before, and Bob Smallpiece pressed him gently back upon the new-mended coat,
  doubled to make a pillow.</p>

  <p>Nan May, tense and white, curbed her agitation, ministering and suffering
  in silence. Years before a man had been carried home to her thus, but then
  all was over, and after the first numbness grief could take its vent. Once
  she asked Bob Smallpiece, in a whisper, how it had happened. He told how
  little he knew, and save for passing the words to Bessy, wakened by unwonted
  sounds, Mrs. May said nothing. Bessy, in her nightgown, sat on the stairs,
  hugging her crutch, and sobbing with what quietness she could compel of
  herself.</p>

  <p>There was a little brandy in a quartern bottle, and the keeper thought it
  well to force the spirit between the old man's teeth, while Mrs. May bathed
  the head and washed away the clotted blood. As they did so the wheels of the
  doctor's dog-cart were heard in the lane, and soon the doctor came in at the
  door, pulling off his gloves.</p>

  <p>Johnny stood, pale, helpless, and still almost breathless, behind the
  group, while the doctor knelt at his grandfather's side. There was a contused
  wound at the top of the head, the doctor could see, a little back, not
  serious. But blood still dripped from the ears, and the doctor shook his
  head. "Fracture of the base," he said, as to himself.</p>

  <p>Reviving a little because of the brandy and the bathing, the old man once
  more made a motion as if to rise, his eyes grew brighter, though fixed still,
  and his voice rose distinctly as ever.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;took the bag in, yes. London's comin' fast, London's comin' an'
  a-frightenin' out the butterflies. London's a-drivin' the butterflies out o'
  my round, out o' my round, an' butterflies can't live near it. London's out
  o' my round an' I've done my round an' now I'll give in the empty bag. Take
  the bag: an' look for the pension. That's the 'vantage o' the Pos'-Office,
  John. Some gets pensions but some don', but the butterflies'll last my time I
  hope: an' Haskins he kep' bees, but I'm hopin' to finish my roun'&mdash;" and
  so on and so on till the voice fell again and the muttering was fainter than
  before.</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece stood awkwardly by, unwilling to remain a useless intruder,
  but just as reluctant to desert friends in trouble. Presently he bethought
  himself that work was still to do in inquiry how the old man's hurt had
  befallen, whether by accident or attack; perhaps, indeed, to inform the
  police, and that in good time. So he asked, turning his hat about in his
  hands, if there was anything else he could do.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more, Smallpiece, thanks," the doctor said, with an unmistakable
  lift of the brows and a glance at the door.</p>

  <p>"God bless you for helpin' us, Mr. Smallpiece," Mrs. May said as she let
  him out. "I'll let you know how he is in the mornin' if you can't call." And
  when the door was shut, "Go to bed, Johnny, my boy, and take a rest." But
  Johnny went no farther than the stairs, and sat there with his sister.</p>

  <p>The old man's muttering ceased wholly, and he breathed heavily,
  stertorously. The doctor rose to his feet and turned to Mrs. May.</p>

  <p>"Won't you tell me, sir," she said. "Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is very serious," the doctor said gravely; and added with impressive
  slowness, "very serious indeed."</p>

  <p>The woman took a grip of the table, and caught three quick breaths.</p>

  <p>"You must keep yourself calm, and you must bear up. You must prepare
  yourself&mdash;in case of something very bad indeed."</p>

  <p>Twice she tried to speak, but was mute; and then, "No hope?" she said,
  more to sight than to hearing.</p>

  <p>He put his hand kindly on her shoulder. "It would be wrong of me to
  encourage it," he said. "As for what I can do, it is all over...But you must
  bear up," he went on firmly, as, guided to a chair, she bent forward and
  covered her face. "Drink this&mdash;" He took a small bottle from his bag,
  poured something into a cup and added water. "Drink it&mdash;drink it up; all
  of it...I must go...You've your children to think of, remember. Come to your
  mother, my boy..."</p>

  <p>He was gone, and the children stood with their arms about their mother.
  The old man's breathing, which had grown heavier and louder still, presently
  eased again, and his eyes closed drowsily. At this the woman looked up with
  an impossible hope in her heart. Truly, the breath was soft and natural, and
  the drawn lines had gone from the face: he must be sleeping. Why had she not
  thought to ask Bob Smallpiece to carry him up to bed? And why had the doctor
  not ordered it? Softly she turned the wet cloth that lay over the wound.</p>

  <p>The breath grew lighter and still lighter, and more peaceful the face,
  till one might almost trace a smile. Quieter and quieter, and still more
  peaceful: till all was peace indeed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">BOB SMALLPIECE and a police-inspector busied themselves that
  night at Wormleyton Pits. The pits were none of them deep&mdash;six feet at
  most. At the bottom of the deepest they found old May's lantern, with the
  glass broken and the candle overrun and extinguished; and the gravel was
  spotted with marks which, in the clearer light of the morning, were seen to
  be marks of blood. It was useless to look for foot-prints. The ground was
  dry, and, except in the pits themselves, it was covered with heather, whereon
  no such traces were possible. And this was all the police had to say at the
  inquest, whereat the jury gave a verdict of Accidental Death. For the old man
  had died, as was medically certified after post-mortem examination, of
  brain-laceration produced by fracture of the base of the skull; and the
  fracture was caused by percussion from a blow on the upper part of the
  head&mdash;a blow probably suffered by falling backward into the pit and
  striking the head against a large stone embedded at the bottom. Everything
  suggested such an explanation. Above the steepest wall of the pit, over which
  the fall must have chanced, a narrow ledge of ground ran between the brink
  and a close clump of bramble and bush; and this ledge was grown thick with
  tough heather, as apt, almost, as a tangle of wire, to catch the foot and
  cause a stumble. It was plain that, stooping to his occupation on this ledge,
  and perhaps forgetting his situation in the interest of his search, he had
  fallen backward into the pit with the lantern. He had probably lain there
  insensible for some while, and then, developing a crazed half-consciousness,
  he had crawled out by the easy slope at the farther end, and staggered off
  whithersoever his disjointed faculties might carry him. Nobody had seen him
  but his grandson and the keeper; so that the verdict was a matter of course,
  and the dismal inquiry was soon done with. And indeed the jury knew all there
  was to know, unless it were a trivial matter, of some professional interest
  to Bob Smallpiece, about which the police preferred to have nothing said;
  since it could not help the jury, though it might chance, later, to be of
  some use to themselves. It was simply the fact that several very fresh
  peg-holes were observed about the pits, hinting a tearing away of
  rabbit-snares with no care to hide the marks.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The days were bad dreams to Johnny. He found himself continually repeating
  in his mind that gran'dad was dead, gran'dad was dead; as though he were
  forcing himself to learn a lesson that persistently slipped his memory. Well
  enough he knew it, and it puzzled him that he should find it so hard to
  believe, and, mostly, so easy a grief. As he woke in the morning the thought
  struck down his spirits, and then, with an instant revulsion, he doubted it
  was but the aftertaste of a dream. But there lay the empty half of the bed
  they were wont to share, and the lesson began again. He went about the house.
  Here was a sheet of gran'dad's list of trades, pinned to the wall, there the
  unfinished case of moths for which the customer was waiting. These, and the
  shelves, and the breeding-boxes&mdash;all were as parts of the old man,
  impossible to consider apart from his active, white-headed figure. In some
  odd, hopeless way they seemed to suggest that it was all right, and that
  gran'dad was simply in the garden, or upstairs, or in the backhouse, and
  presently would come in as usual and put them all to their daily uses. And it
  was only by dint of stern concentration of thought that Johnny forced on
  himself the assurance that the old man would come among his cases no more,
  nor ever again discuss with him the list of London trades. Then the full
  conviction struck him sorely, like a blow behind the neck: the heavy stroke
  of bereavement and the sick fear of the world for his mother and sister,
  together. But there&mdash;he was merely torturing himself. He took refuge in
  a curious callousness, that he could call back very easily when he would. So
  the days went, but with each new day the intermissions of full realisation
  grew longer: till plain grief persisted in a leaden ache, rarely broken by a
  spell of apathy.</p>

  <p>His mother and his sister went about household duties silently, not often
  apart. They were comforted in companionship, it seemed, but solitude brought
  tears and heartbreak. Nan May's London upbringing caused her some thought of
  what her acquaintances there would have called a "proper" funeral. But here
  the machinery of such funerals must be brought from a distance, thus becoming
  doubly expensive; and this being the case, cottagers made very little
  emulation at such times, and a walking funeral&mdash;perhaps at best a cab
  from the rank at Loughton station&mdash;satisfied most. Moreover, the old man
  himself had many a time preached strong disapproval of money wasted on
  funerals; had, indeed, prophesied that if any costliness were wasted on him,
  he would rise from his coffin and kick a mute. So now that the time had come,
  a Theydon carpenter made the coffin, and a cab from Loughton was the whole
  show. The old man's relations were not, and of Nan May's most still alive
  were forgotten; for in the forest cottage the little family had been seclnded
  from such connections, as by sundering seas. At first they had seemed too
  near for correspondence, and then they had been found too far for visiting.
  Uncle Isaac came to the funeral, however; and though in the beginning he
  seemed prepared for solemn declamation, something in the sober grief at the
  cottage made him unwontedly quiet.</p>

  <p>It was a short coffin, accommodated under the cabman's seat with no great
  protrusion at the ends; what there was being covered decently with a black
  cloth. And the cab held the mourners easily: Johnny and Bessy in their Sunday
  clothes, their mother in hers (they had always been black since she was first
  a widow) and Uncle Isaac in a creasy suit of lustrous black, oddly bunched
  and wrinkled at the seams: the conventional Sunday suit of his generation of
  artisans, folded carefully and long preserved, and designed to be available
  alike for church and for such funerals as might come to pass.</p>

  <p>A brisk wind stirred the trees, and flung showers of fallen leaves after
  the shabby old four-wheeler as it climbed the lanes that led up to the little
  churchyard; where the sexton and his odd man waited with planks and ropes by
  the new-dug grave. It was a bright afternoon, but a fresh chill in the wind
  hinted the coming of winter. A belated Red Admiral seemed to chase the cab,
  fluttering this way or that, now by one window, now by the other, and again
  away over the hedge-top. Nothing was said. Now and again Johnny took his eyes
  from the open window to look at his companions. His mother, opposite, sat,
  pale and worn, with her hands in her lap, and gazed blankly over his head at
  the front window of the cab. She was commonly a woman of healthy skin and
  colour, but now the skin seemed coarser, and there was no colour but the pink
  about her red eyelids. Uncle Isaac, next her, sat forward, and rubbed his
  chin over and round the knob of his walking stick, a bamboo topped with a
  "Turk's head" of tarred cord. As for Bessy, sitting at the far end of his own
  seat, Johnny saw nothing of her face for her handkerchief and the
  crutch-handle. But she was very quiet, and he scarcely thought she was
  crying. For himself, he was sad enough, in a heavy way, but in no danger of
  tears; and he turned again, and looked out of the window.</p>

  <p>At last the cab stopped at the lych gate. Here Bob Smallpiece unexpectedly
  appeared, to lend a hand with the coffin. So that with the sexton, and the
  carpenter who was the undertaker, Uncle Isaac, and the keeper, the cabman's
  help was not wanted. The cabman lingered a moment, to shift cloths and
  aprons, and to throw a glance or two after the little company as it followed
  the clergyman, and then he hastened to climb to his seat and drive after a
  young couple that he spied walking in the main road; for they were strangers,
  and looked a likely fare back to the station.</p>

  <p>Johnny found church much as it was on Sunday, except that to-day they sat
  near the front, and that he was conscious of a faint sense of family
  importance by reason of the special service, and the coffin so conspicuously
  displayed. A few neighbours&mdash;women mostly&mdash;were there, too; and
  when the coffin was carried out to the grave, they grouped themselves a
  little way off in the background, with Bob Smallpiece farther back still.</p>

  <p>From the grave's edge one looked down over the country-side, green and
  hilly, and marked out in meadows by rows of elms, with hedges at foot. The
  wind came up briskly and set the dead leaves going again and again, chasing
  them among the tombs and casting them into the new red grave. Bessy was quiet
  no longer, but sobbed aloud, and Nan May took no more care to dry her eyes.
  Johnny made an effort that brought him near to choking, and then another; and
  then he fixed his attention on the cows in a meadow below, counted them with
  brimming eyes, and named them (for he knew them well) as accurately as the
  distance would let him. He would scarce trust himself to take a last look,
  with the others, at the coffin below and its bright tin plate, but fell
  straightway to watching a man mending thatch on a barn, and wondering that he
  wore neither coat nor waistcoat in such a fresh wind. And so, except for a
  stray tear or two, which nobody saw overflow from the brimming eyes, he faced
  it out, and walked away with the others under the curious gaze of the
  neighbours, who lined up by the path. And Smallpiece went off in the opposite
  direction with the carpenter, who carried back the pall folded over his arm,
  like a cloak.</p>

  <p>The four mourners walked back by the lanes, in silence. Uncle Isaac bore
  the restraint with difficulty, and glanced uneasily at Nan May's face from
  time to time, as though he were watching an opportunity to expound his
  sentiments at length. But Johnny saw nothing of this, for affliction was upon
  him. Now that gran'dad was passed away indeed&mdash;was buried, and the clods
  were rising quickly over him&mdash;now that even the coffin was gone from the
  cottage, and would never be seen again&mdash;it seemed that he had never
  understood before, and he awoke to the full bitterness of things. More, his
  effort at restraint was spent, and in the revulsion he found he could hold in
  no longer. He peeped into the thickets by the lane-side as he went, questing
  for an excuse to drop behind. Seeing no other, he stooped and feigned to tie
  his bootlace; calling, in a voice that quavered absurdly in trying to seem
  indifferent, "Go on, mother, I'm comin' presently!"</p>

  <p>He dashed among the bushes, flung himself on the grass, and burst into a
  blind fury of tears, writhing as though under a shower of stinging blows. He
  had meant to cry quietly, but all was past control, and any might hear that
  chanced by. He scarce knew whether the fit had endured for seconds, minutes,
  or hours, when he was aware of his mother, sitting beside him and pressing
  his bursting head to her breast. Bessy was there too, and his mother's arms
  were round both alike.</p>

  <p>With that he grew quieter and quieter still. "We mustn't break down,
  Johnny boy&mdash;there's hard struggles before us," his mother said,
  smoothing back his hair. "An' you must be very good to me, Johnny, you're the
  man now!"</p>

  <p>He kissed her, and brushed the last of his tears away. "Yes, mother, I
  will," he said. He rose, calmer, awake to new responsibilities, and felt a
  man indeed. Nothing remained of his outbreak but a chance-coming shudder in
  the breath, and, as he helped Bessy to her feet, he saw, five yards off,
  among the bushes, Uncle Isaac, under his very tall hat, gazing blankly at the
  group, and gently rubbing the Turk's head on his stick among the loose grey
  whiskers that bordered his Iarge face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">NAN MAY rose another woman in the morning; for there was
  work before her. The children marvelled to see her so calm and so busy, so
  full of thought for the business in hand, so little occupied with sorrowful
  remembrance. The old man, prudent ever, had arranged years since for what had
  now befallen. There was a simple little will on a sheet of notepaper. There
  was a great and complicated list, on odd scraps of paper, thickly beset with
  additions, alterations, and crossings-out, of the "specimens" hoarded in the
  cottage; with pencil notes of values, each revised a dozen times, as the
  market changed. There was a Post-Office Savings Bank deposit book, with
  entries amounting to eight pounds ten, and a nomination form whereby Nan May
  might withdraw the money. There was no life-insurance, for the old man had
  surrendered it years ago, to secure the few pounds he needed to make up the
  full price of the cottage.</p>

  <p>The will gave Nan May all there might be to take, and left her to execute.
  Uncle Isaac, on the return to the cottage the day before, had at length
  broken into speech, and by devious approaches, cunningly disguised and
  ostentatiously casual, had reached the will. But he got little by his motion,
  for though his niece told him the will's purport, she protested that till
  to-morrow she should do nothing with it, nor did she even offer to produce
  it. Of course, he had scarcely expected a legacy himself; but still, he was
  Uncle Isaac, profound in experience, learned in the law, and an oracle in the
  family. It seemed, to say the least, a little scandalous that he should not
  have had the handling of this property, the selling, the control, the doling
  out, with such consideration the exertion might earn, and the accidents of
  arithmetic detach.</p>

  <p>"It's an important thing, is a will," said Uncle Isaac sagely. "A thing as
  ought to be seen to by a experienced person. You might jist look an' see 'ow
  it's wrote. If any's wrote in pencil it's nullavoid."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mrs. May, without moving. "It's all in ink."</p>

  <p>Then, after a long pause: "Lawyers comes very expensive with wills," Uncle
  Isaac observed. "They come expensive alwis, an' mostly they rob the property
  accordin' to form o' lawr. It's best to get a man of experience, as you can
  trust, to go straight to Somerset 'ouse in form o' porpus...It's the cheapest
  way, an' safe. 'E takes the will, jist as it might be me, an' 'e goes to the
  'thorities, an' 'e talks to 'em, knowin' an' confidential. 'Ere I am, ses 'e,
  as it might be me, on be'alf o' the last will an' 'oly testament as it might
  be o' Mr. May. An' I've come in form o' porpus, 'avin' objections to lawyers.
  In form o' porpus," Uncle Isaac repeated impressively, tapping a forefinger
  on the table: as was his way of blazoning an erudite phrase that else might
  pass unregarded.</p>

  <p>"Poor gran'dad told me what to do about goin' to Somerset House, an' all
  that," answered Nan May, "in case anything happened. But I'd take it very
  kind if you'd come with me, Uncle Isaac, me not understandin' such things.
  But I can't think about it to-day." And with so much of his finger in the pie
  Uncle Isaac was fain to be content. And soon he left, declining to stay for
  the night&mdash;to Johnny's great relief&mdash;because his cheap
  return-ticket was available for the day and no more.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And now Johnny, having brought sheets of foolscap paper from Loughton, was
  set to work to make a fair copy of the amazing list of specimens; a work at
  great length accomplished in an unstable round hand, but on the whole with
  not so many blots. And Nan May's series of visits to Somerset House was
  begun, saddening her with a cost of one and ninepence each visit for fares in
  train and omnibus. The first, indeed, cost more, for Uncle Isaac's fare from
  Miliwall was also to be paid. But he came no more, for in truth his failure
  as a man of business was instant and ignoble.</p>

  <p>To begin with, the shadow of the awful building fell on him as he neared
  it, extinguishing his confidence and stopping his tongue. In the quadrangle
  the very tall hat distinguished an Uncle Isaac of hushed speech and meek
  docility, and along the corridors it followed Nan May deferentially, in
  unresting pursuit of room No. 37. The room was reached at last, and here
  Uncle Isaac found himself constrained to open the bnsiness. For Nan May
  herself held back now, and the young man in gold-rimmed glasses fixed him
  with his eye. So, taking off his hat with both hands, Uncle Isaac, in a
  humble murmur, began:&mdash;"We've&mdash;good mornin', sir&mdash;we've come
  as it might be in form o' porpus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"As regards to a will," Uncle Isaac explained desperately, dropping his
  technicality like a hot rivet. "As regards to a will an' dyin' testament
  which the late deceased did&mdash;did write out."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Are you the executor?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, not as it might be executor. No. But as uncle to Mr. May's
  daughter-in-law by marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are <i>you</i>?" The gentleman turned abruptly to Nan May, who gave him
  the will. Whereupon Uncle Isaac, in a hopeful way of recovering nerve and
  eloquence, was thrust out of the business, and told that Nan May alone would
  be dealt with. And he retired once more into shadow, with a little relief to
  leaven a great deal of injured dignity.</p>

  <p>So that for the rest Nan May relied on herself alone, and hardened her
  face to the world. When the specimens came to be sold, a smart young man came
  from the London firm of naturalists, to make an offer. He examined the trays
  and cases as hastily and carelessly as was consistent with a privily sharp
  eye to all they held, and with the air of contempt proper for a professional
  buyer. For in such a matter of business the widow and the orphan needing
  money are the weak party, humble and timid, watching small signs with sinking
  hearts, and easy to beat: and a man of business worth the name of one, takes
  advantage of the fact for every penny it will bring. So the smart young man,
  looking more contemptuous than ever, and dusting his fingers with his
  pocket-handkerchief, flung Nan May an offer of five pounds for the lot.</p>

  <p>"No, thank-you, sir," the woman answered with simple decision. "I'm sorry
  you've had the trouble. Good-morning." Which was not the reply the young man
  had looked for, and indeed, not a reply easy of rejoinder. So he was
  constrained to some unbending of manner, and a hint that his firm might
  increase the offer if she would name a sum. And the whole thing ended with a
  letter carrying a cheque for forty pounds. Which was very handsome indeed,
  for the young man's firm would scarce have paid more than eighty pounds for
  the collection In the ordinary way of trade.</p>

  <p>And so the old man's little affairs were gathered up, and the Inland
  Revenue took its bite out of the estate, and there were no more journeys to
  Somerset House. But nobody would buy the cottage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">JUST such a day as Johnny's London memories always brought,
  cold and dry and brisk, found him perched on the cart that was to take him to
  London again. Besides himself, the cart held his mother and his sister, and
  the household furniture from the cottage; while Banks, the carrier, sat on
  the shaft. Bessy was made comfortable in the armchair; her mother sat on a
  bundle of bedding, whence it was convenient to descend when steep hills were
  encountered; and Johnny sat on the tail-board, and jumped off and on as the
  humour took him.</p>

  <p>All through long Loughton village there was something of a triumphal
  progress, for people knew them, and turned to look. Bessy alone remained in
  the cart for the long pull up Buckhurst Hill, while Johnny, tramping beside
  and making many excursions into the thicket, flung up into her lap sprigs of
  holly with berries. Already they had plenty, packed close in a box, but it is
  better to have too much than too little, so any promising head was added to
  the store. For it was December, and Christmas would come in three weeks or
  so. And ere that Nan May was to open shop in London. It was to be a
  chandler's shop, with aspirations toward grocery and butter: chandlery,
  grocery, and butter being things of the buying and selling whereof Nan May
  knew as little as anybody in the world, beyond the usual retail prices at the
  forest villages. But something must be done, and everything has a beginning
  somewhere. So Nan May resolutely set face to the work, to play the world with
  all the rigour of the game; and her figure, as she tramped sturdily up the
  hill beside the cart, was visible symbol of her courage. Always a healthy,
  clear-skinned, almost a handsome woman, active and shapely, she walked the
  hill with something of steadfast fierceness, as one joying in trampling an
  obstacle: her eyes fixed before her, and taking no heed of the view that
  opened to Bessy's gaze as she looked back from under the tilt of the cart;
  but busy with thought of the fight she was beginning, a little fearful, but
  by so much the gamer. Meanwhile, it was a good piece of business to decorate
  a shop with holly at Christmas, and here Johnny found holly ready for the
  work; it would cost money in London.</p>

  <p>The cart crowned the hill-top, and still Nan May regarded not the show
  that lay behind, whereof Bessy took her fill for the moments still left.
  There Loughton tumbled about its green hills, beset with dusky trees, like a
  spilt boxful of toys, with the sad-coloured forest making the horizon line
  behind it. Away to the left, seen between the boughs of the near pines, High
  Beach steeple lifted from the velvety edge, and as far to the right, on its
  own hill, rose the square church tower that stood by gran'dad's grave. And
  where the bold curve of Staples Hill lost itself among the woods, some tall
  brown trees uprose above the rest and gave good-bye. For invisible beyond
  them lay the empty cottage in its patch of garden, grown dank and waste. Then
  roadside trees shut all out, and the cart stopped on the level to take up Nan
  May.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And now the old mare jogged faster along to Woodford wells and through the
  Green, fringed with a wonder of big houses, and many broad miles of country
  seen between them; then, farther, down the easy slope of Rising Sun Road,
  with thick woods at the way's edge on each side, their winter austerity
  softened by the sunlight among the brown twigs. And so on and on, till they
  emerged in bushy Leyton Flats, and turned off for Leytonstone.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And now they were nearing London indeed. Once past the Green Man, they
  were on a tram-lined road, and there were shops and houses with scarce a
  break. Where there was one bricklayers on scaffoldings were building
  shopfronts. The new shops had a raw, disagreeable look, and some of these a
  little older were just old enough to be dirty without being a whit less
  disagreeable and raw. Some were prosperous, brilliant with gilt and
  plate-glass; others, which had started even with them, stood confessed
  failures, poor and mean, with a pathetic air&mdash;almost an
  expression&mdash;of disappointment in every window. Older
  buildings&mdash;some very old&mdash;stood about Harrow Green, but already the
  wreckers had begun to pul a cottage down to make room for something else. And
  then the new shops began again, and lined the road without a check, till they
  were new no longer, but of the uncertain age of commonplace London brick and
  mortar; and Maryland Point Railway Station was passed; and it was town
  indeed, with clatter and smoke and mud.</p>

  <p>Stratford Broadway lay wide and busy, with the church and the town-hall
  imposing and large. But soon the road narrowed and grew fouler, and the
  mouths of unclean alleys dribbled slush and dirty children across the
  pavement. Then there were factories, and the road passed over narrow canals
  of curiously iridescent sludge, too thick, to the casual eye, for the passage
  of any craft, but interesting to the casual nose. And there was a great, low,
  misty waste of the dullest possible rubbish, where grass would not grow; a
  more hopelessly desolate and dispiriting wilderness than Johnny had ever
  dreamed of or Bessy ever read; with a chemical manure-works in a far corner,
  having a smell of great volume and range.</p>

  <p>They topped Bow Bridge, and turned sharply to the left. Now it was London
  itself, London by Act of Parliament. There was a narrow way with a few wharf
  gates, and then an open space, with houses centuries old, fallen on leaner
  years, but still grubbily picturesque. Hence the old mare trotted through a
  long and winding street that led by dirty entries, by shops, by big
  distilleries, by clean, dull houses where managers lived, by wooden inns
  swinging ancient signs, over canal bridges: to a place of many streets lying
  regularly at right angles, all of small houses, all clean, every one a
  counterpart of every other. And then&mdash;the docks and the ships. At least,
  the great dock-gates, with the giant pepper-box and the clock above them, and
  the high walls, with here and there a mast. And at intervals, as the houses
  permitted, the high walls and the masts were visible again and again in the
  short way yet to go, pass Blackwall Cross, till at last the cart stopped
  before a little shut-up shop, badly in want of paint; in a street where one
  gained the house-doors down areas maybe, or up steps, or on the level, from a
  pavement a little more than two feet wide; while the doors themselves, and
  the wooden rails that guarded all the steps, were painted in divers
  unaccustomed and original colours, and had nothing in common but a subtle
  flavour of ship's stores. Over the way was the wall of a ship-yard. And
  wheresoever there might be a view of houses from the back, there were small
  flagstaffs rigged as masts, with gaffs complete.</p>

  <p>The door of the little shop opened, after a short struggle with the rusty
  lock, and Nan May and her children were at home in London.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE shop in Harbour Lane had been a greengrocer's, a
  barber's, a fried-fishmonger's, and a tripe-seller's. But chiefly it had been
  shut up, as it was now. Nobody had ever come into it with much money, it is
  true, but all had gone out of it with less than they brought. It was said,
  indeed, that the greengrocer had gone out with nothing but the clothes he
  wore; but as he went no farther than the end of the street, where he drowned
  himself from a swing bridge, he needed no more, nor even so much. Mr. Dunkin,
  the landlord, had bought the place at a low price, as was his way in buying
  things; but he got very little out of his investment, which was not his way
  at all. It was a novelty that surprised and irritated Mr. Dunkin. He was a
  substantial tradesman, who had long relinquished counter work, for there were
  a dozen assistants in the two departments of his chief shop, eight for
  grocery and butter, and four for oil and saucepans, paint and mousetraps; and
  there were half a dozen branches, some in the one trade and some in the
  other, scattered about in as many neighbouring parishes. He was a large man,
  of vast sympathy. The tone of his voice, the grasp of his wide, pulpy hand,
  told of infinite tenderness toward the sorrows and sins of the world. Even in
  the early days when he had but one shop (a little one) and no shop-man, he
  would weigh out a pound of treacle with so melting a benignity that the
  treacle seemed balm of Gilead, and a bounteous gift at the price. He would
  drive a bargain in a voice of yearning beneficence that left the other party
  ashamed of his own self-seeking, as well as something the poorer by the deal.
  It was a voice wherein a purr had a large part&mdash;a purr that was hoarse
  yet soothing, and eloquent of compassion; so that no man was so happy but a
  talk with Mr. Dunkin would persuade him that the lot was hard indeed, that
  entitled him to such a wealth of sympathy. It was a wealth that Mr. Dunkin
  squandered with no restraint but this, that it carried no other sort of
  wealth with it.</p>

  <p>On the whole, Nan May had counted herself fortunate in falling in with Mr.
  Dunkin. For when, in his fatherly solicitude, he discovered that she had a
  little money in hand, he undertook to supply her with stock, and to give her
  certain hints in the mystery of chandlery. He, also, felt no cause for
  complaint: for he had hoped for a tenant merely, and here was tenant and
  customer in one. More, she was a widow, knowing nothing of trade, so that it
  might be possible to sell her what others would not buy, at a little extra
  profit. As to rent, moreover, he was doing well. For on the day the deposit
  was paid, Mrs. May had found little choice among vacant shops, and this was
  in a situation to suit her plans as to Johnny and his trade; and as she was
  tired and nervous, full of plain anxiety, sympathetic Mr. Dunkin saw his
  chance of trying for an extra shilling a week, and got it. And Nan May was
  left to pay for what painting and cleaning the place might need. It needed a
  good deal, as Mr. Dunkin had ruefully observed two days before, in
  expectation of a decorator's bill if ever a tenant came.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And now Nan May addressed herself to the work. First, the house must be
  cleaned; the paint could be considered after. She had swept one room into a
  habitable state on her last day in town, and here her little store of
  furniture was stacked. Then, her sleeves and her skirt turned back, and a
  duster over her head, she assailed walls and ceilings with a broom, and after
  these the floors. So far Johnny helped, but when scrubbing began he hindered.
  So it was that for a day or so, until it was time for him to help with the
  windows, he had leisure wherein to make himself acquainted with the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>It was a neighbourhood with a flavour distinct from that of the districts
  about it. There the flat rows of six-roomed cottages, characterless all,
  stretched everywhere, rank behind rank, in masses unbroken except by the
  busier thoroughfares of shops. Here each little house asserted its
  individuality by diversity of paint as much as by diversity of shape. It was,
  indeed, the last stronghold of the shipwrights and mast-makers, fallen from
  their high estate since the invasion of iron ships and northern competition.
  In fact, Shipwrights' Row was the name of a short rank of cottages close by,
  with gardens in front, each with its mast and flag complete. In other places,
  where the back-yards were very small, the flagstaff and stays were apt to
  take to their use the whole space: the pole rising from the exact centre, and
  a stay taking its purchase from each extreme corner, so that anybody essaying
  a circuit must perform it with many sudden obeisances. The little streets had
  an air of cleanliness all their own, largely due to the fresh paint that
  embellished whatsoever there was an excuse for painting. Many front-doors
  were reached by two stone steps, always well whitened; and whether there were
  steps or not, the flagstones before each threshold were distinguished by a
  whited semicircle five feet in diameter. Noting this curious fact as he
  tramped along one such street, Johnny was startled by an angry voice close at
  his elbow, a voice so very sudden and irate that he jumped aside ere he
  looked for the source. A red-faced woman knelt within a door.</p>

  <p>"Idle young faggit!" she said. "Stompin' yer muddy boots all over my clean
  step!" And she made so vigorous a grasp at a broom that Johnny went five
  yards at a gallop.</p>

  <p>Now truly there was no step of any sort to the house. And Johnny had but
  crossed the semicircle because he conceived the footpath to be public
  property, and because it was narrow. But he learnt, afterwards, that the
  semicircle was a sacred institution of the place, in as high regard among the
  women as its fellow-fetish, the flagstaff, was among the men; also that none
  but grown people&mdash;and those of low habits or in drink&mdash;dared
  trespass on it; and that it was always called "the step." He learnt much,
  too, in the matter of paint. Every male inhabitant of Harbour Lane,
  Shipwrights' Row, and the neighbouring streets, carried, in his leisure
  moments, a pipe, a pot of paint, and a brush. He puffed comfortably at the
  pipe, and stumped about his back (or front) garden with the paint-pot in one
  hand and the brush in the other, "touching-up" whatever paint would stick to.
  Rails, posts, water-butts, dustbins, clothes-posts, all were treated, not
  because they needed it (for they were scarce dry from the last coat), but
  because there was the paint, and there was the brush, and there was the
  leisure; and this was the only way to use all three. So that most things
  about the gardens took an interesting variety of tints in the run of the
  year, since it was rarely the case that the same colour was used twice in
  succession. When all wooden surfaces were covered, it was customary to take a
  turn at window-sills, rain-water pipes, and the stones or oyster-shells that
  bordered the little flower-beds; and when nothing else was left, then the
  paint-pot and the brush and the pipe were conveyed to the front, and the
  front-door, which had been green, became royal blue, or flaming salmon; as
  did the railings, if there were any, and the window-frames. Two things alone
  were not subject to such changes of complexion: the flagstaffs and the brick
  pavings. For it was a law immutable that the flagstaffs should be speckless
  white, and the bricks a cheerful vermilion; this last a colour frequently
  renewed, because of nailed boots, but done in good oil paint, because of wet
  weather. Everything else took the range of the rainbow, and something beyond;
  so that it was possible, in those houses where two families lived, to tell at
  a glance whether the upstairs family were on terms of intimacy or merely of
  distant civility with the downstairs, by the colours, uniform or diverse, of
  the sills and the model fences that guarded the flower-pots on them. For the
  token and sign of friendship in Harbour Lane was the loan or the exchange of
  paint. It was the proper method of breaking the ice between new
  acquaintances, and was recognised as such by general sanction. The greeting,
  "Bit o' blue paint any use to ye?" and the offer of the pot across the back
  fence, were the Harbour Lane equivalents of a call and cards; and the
  newcomer made early haste with an offer of yellow or green paint in return.
  Indeed, it was in this way that the paint arrived which afterwards made Nan
  May's little shop a bedazzlement to the wayfarer, and furnished Johnny with
  the first painting job he ever grew tired of. But newcomers were rare in the
  neighbourhood, for it was a colony apart, with independent manners and habits
  of thought. True, it had its own divisions and differences: as, foquestione,
  on the question whether or not the association of the paint-pot and brush
  with the Sunday paper were sinful; but these divisions were purely internal,
  and nothing was heard of them beyond the boundaries.</p>

  <p>But paint was something more than a recreation and an instrument of social
  amenity. It furnished the colony with an equivalent of high finance, wherein
  all the operations proper to Money and Credit (as spelt with capital
  initials) were reflected in Paint. For it was a permanent condition of life
  in Harbour Lane and thereabouts, that everybody owed everybody else some
  amount of Paint, and was owed Paint, in his turn, by others. So that a
  complicated system of exchange prevailed, in which verbal bills and cheques
  were drawn. As thus, to make a simple case:</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Bill, what about at pot o' paint?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was goin' to bring it round to-night."</p>

  <p>"All right. But don't bring it to me&mdash;take it to George. Ye see, I
  owe Jim a bit o' paint, an' 'e owes Joe a bit, an' Joe owes George a bit. So
  that '11 make it right all round. Don't forget!"</p>

  <p>With many such arrangements synchronising, crossing and mixing with each
  other, and made intricate by differing degrees and manners of debit and
  credit between Bill and George and Jim and Joe, the unlikely subject of Paint
  became involved in a mathematical web of exceeding interest, a small image of
  the Money Market, a sort of chaos by double entry wherein few operators were
  able to strike a balance at a moment, and most were vaguely uncertain whether
  their accounts inclined toward an affluence of Paint or toward sheer
  bankruptcy. An exciting result attained without the aid of capital, and with
  no serious hurt to anybody.</p>

  <p>But these were things that Johnny learned in the succeeding weeks. In his
  walks while his mother scrubbed floors at home, he observed one or two
  matters. As to costume, he perceived that the men wore blue dungaree jackets
  with large bone buttons, and outside these, now that it was winter, short
  pilot coats of dark blue stuff, thick and stiff, like a board. The trousers
  were moleskins, perhaps once white, all stained with very shiny black
  patches, and all of one cut, which placed the seat (very baggy) a few inches
  above the bend of the knee; and there was a peaked cap, of the same shiny
  black all over that distinguished parts of the trousers. He also saw that
  whereas yesterday the backyards were brisk with fluttering linen, to-day they
  held scarce any. For yesterday was Monday, and it was matter of pride among
  the energetic housewives of the place to get washing done at the beginning of
  the week. For a woman fell in her neighbours' respect the later in the week
  her washing day came.</p>

  <p>So Johnny explored the streets with wide eyes and a full heart. For here
  was London, where they made great things&mdash;ships and engines. There were
  places he fancied he recognised&mdash;great blank walls with masts behind
  them. But now the masts seemed fewer and shorter than in the old days: as in
  truth they were, for now more of the ships were steamships, filling greater
  space for half the show of mast. Then in other places he came on basins
  filled with none but sailing-ships, and here the masts were as tall and fine
  as ever, stayed with much cordage, and had their yards slung at a gallant
  slope, like the sword on Sir Walter Raleigh's hip. And at Blackwall Stairs,
  looking across the river, stood an old, old house that Johnny stared at for
  minutes together: a month or two later he heard the tradition that Sir Walter
  Raleigh himself had lived there. It was first of a row of old waterside
  buildings, the newest of which had looked across, and almost fallen into, the
  river, when King George's ships had anchored off Blackwall&mdash;and King
  Charles's for that matter. There, too, stood the Artichoke Tavern, dean and
  white and wooden, a heap of gables and windows all out of perpendicular: a
  house widest and biggest everywhere at the top, and smallest at the ground
  floor; a house that seemed ready to topple into the river at a push, so far
  did its walls and galleries overhang the water, and so slender were the piles
  that supported them. Here, in the square space on the quay, brown men in blue
  jerseys sold bloaters by the score, stringing them through the gills with
  tarry yarn; and half the brown men wore earrings. Below, on the foreshore,
  lay many boats, and children ran among them, or raked for river-mussels among
  the stones.</p>

  <p>In another place he came on just such market-streets as he remembered to
  have trotted along, at his mother's side, in the old London life; though now,
  indeed, they seemed something dirtier and meaner, and the people seemed less
  cheerful. But this was a place away from Harbour Lane&mdash;a neighbourhood
  of dull and dingy rows of little houses, range on range. And still farther he
  found another street of shops, or rather half a street, for one side was a
  blank wall. But no great skeleton ship lifted its ribs above the bricks, and
  no hammers clanged behind them; for it was a ship-yard abandoned, and a
  painted board, thick with grime, offered the place for sale or hire. Some of
  the shops opposite were abandoned too, and the others were poor and dull.
  Johnny walked a few steps backward, looking at the shops, and when he turned
  about at a corner, he almost scorched himself at a coke fire where chestnuts
  were roasting; and there behind the fire stood the pockmarked man himself,
  not a whit altered! There he stood, with his hands deep in his pockets, and
  tapped the kerb with his clogged boots, just as he had stood when the great
  ship was making, and the lights flared round it, and the shops were all open
  and busy: perhaps the pitted face was a trifle paler, but that was all.</p>

  <p>But Harbour Lane and thereabout were the most interesting parts, and the
  pleasantest for Johnny. Just beyond the Stairs, and the old houses, and the
  Artichoke Tavern, was a dock-inlet, with an extraordinary bridge that halved
  in the middle, and swung back to each of two quays, to let ships through. Men
  worked it quite easily, with a winch, and Johnny could have watched for an
  hour. But just here he caught sight of an acquaintance. For down on the quay
  below the bridge-end, sitting on a mooring-post, was Mr. Butson. A trifle
  seedy and fallen in condition, Johnny fancied, and grumly ill-used as ever.
  As Johnny looked, Mr. Butson took a pipe from his pocket, and a screw of
  paper. The paper yielded nothing. Mr. Butson raked through both
  jacket-pockets, and scowled at his empty hands. In the end, after a gloomy
  inspection of the pipe, he put it away and returned to savage meditation. And
  Johnny went home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was at Maidment and Hurst's, engineers, that Johnny's
  father had met his death; and it was to Maid-ment and Hurst that Nan had
  resolved to take the boy, and beg an apprenticeship for him. True, the firm
  had at the time done more than might have been expected of it, for the
  accident had been largely a matter of heedlessness on the victim's part, and
  the victim was no old hand, but had taken his job only a few months before.
  It had seen that nothing was lacking for the widow's immediate needs, nor for
  a decent funeral; and it had offered to find places in an orphanage for the
  children. But Nan May could not bring herself to part with them: Bessie,
  indeed, was barely out of the hospital at the time. And then the lonely old
  butterfly-hunter had cut matters short by carrying them off all three.</p>

  <p>So that now, if Johnny were to learn a trade, Maid-ment and Hurst's was
  his best chance, for it was just possible that the firm would take him
  apprentice without premium, when it was reminded of his father. In this thing
  Nan May wasted no time. The house once clean within, and something done
  toward stocking the shop, Johnny was made ready, in the best of his clothes,
  for inspection. It was a muddy morning, and Mrs. May had fears for the polish
  on Johnny's boots. Gladly would she have carried him across the miry streets,
  as she had done in the London of years ago, though she knew better than to
  hint at such an outrage on his dignity. So they walked warily, dodging
  puddles with mutual warnings, and fleeing the splashes of passing vans. Truly
  London was changed, even more in Nan May's eyes than in Johnny's. The people
  seemed greyer, more anxious, worse fed, than when she lived among them
  before, a young wife in a smiling world, with the best part of thirty-eight
  shillings to spend every week. The shops were worse stocked, and many that
  she remembered well were shut. True, some flourished signs of prosperity, but
  to her it seemed prosperity of a different and a paltrier sort&mdash;vulgar
  and trumpery. Once out of the Harbour Lane district, the little houses lacked
  the snug, geranium-decked, wire-blinded, rep-curtained comfort of aspect she
  remembered so well&mdash;the air that suggested a red fire within, a shining
  copper kettle, a high fender, and muffins on a trivet. Things were cheap, and
  cold, and grubby. Above all, the silent ship-yards oppressed her fancies.
  Truly, this looked an ill place for new trade! In her hunt for the vacant
  shop she had encountered no old friends, and now, though she walked through
  familiar streets, she had little but fancied recognition, now and again, of
  some face at a shop door.</p>

  <p>Presently they turned a corner and came upon a joyful crowd of boys. They
  ran, they yelled, they flung, and in their midst cursed and floundered a
  rusty rag of a woman, drunk and infuriate, harried, battered and bedeviled.
  Her clothes were of decent black, but dusty and neglected, and one side of
  her skirt dripped with fresh mud. Her hair was draggled about her shoulders,
  and her bonnet hung in it, a bunch of mangled crape, while she staggered
  hither and thither, making futile swipes at the nimble rascals about her. She
  struck out feebly with a little parcel of bacon-rashers rolled in a paper,
  and already a rasher had escaped, to be flung at her head, and flung again by
  the hand that could first snatch it from the gutter.</p>

  <p>"Yah! Old Mother Born-drunk!" shouted the young savages, and two swooped
  again with the stretched skipping-rope that had already tripped their victim
  twice. But she clasped a post with both arms, and cursed at large, hoarse and
  impotent.</p>

  <p>Nan May started and stood, and then hurried on. For she had recognised a
  face at last, grimed and bloated though it had grown. "Law!" she said, "it's
  Emma Pacey! To think&mdash;to think of it!"</p>

  <p>Indeed the shock was great, and the change amazing. It was a change that
  would have baffled recognition by an eye that had less closely noted the Emma
  Pacey of seventeen years ago. But Emma Pacey was a smart girl then (though
  fast and forward, Nan May had always said), and had caused some little
  disturbance in a course of true love which led, nevertheless, to Nan's
  wedding after all. In such circumstances a woman views her rival's face, as
  she views her clothes, with a searching eye, and remembers well. "And to come
  to that!" mused Nan May, perplexed at a shade of emotion that seemed
  ill-turned to the occasion, wherein the simple soul saw nothing of womanish
  triumph.</p>

  <p>But the changes seemed not all for the worse. There were busy factories,
  and some that had been small were now large. Coffee-stalls, too, were set up
  in two or three places, where no such accommodation was in the old time:
  always a sign of increasing trade. But on the whole the walk did nothing to
  raise Nan's spirits.</p>

  <p>Johnny saw little. The excursion was to decide whether he should learn to
  make steam-engines or not, though what manner of adventure he was to
  encounter he figured but vaguely. He was to come into presence of some
  gentlemen, presumably&mdash;gentlemen who would settle his whole destiny
  off-hand, on a cursory examination of his appearance and manner. He must be
  alert to show his best behaviour, though what things the gentlemen might do
  or say, and what unforeseen problems of conduct might present themselves,
  were past guessing; though he guessed and guessed, oblivious of present
  circumstance. Only once before had he felt quite that quality of trepidation,
  and that was three years back, when he trudged along the road to Woodford to
  get a tooth drawn.</p>

  <p>But he came off very well, though the preliminaries were
  solemn&mdash;rather more portentous, he thought, than anything in the
  dentist's waiting-room. There was a sort of counter, with bright brass rails,
  and a ground-glass box with an office-boy inside it. The unprecedented and
  unbusinesslike apparition of Mrs. May, with a timid request to see Mr.
  Maidment or Mr. Hurst (one was dead, and the other never came near the
  place), wholly demoralised the office-boy, who retired upon his supports in
  the depths of the office. Thence there presently emerged a junior clerk, who,
  after certain questions, undertook to see if the acting partner were in. Then
  came a time of stealthy and distrustful inspection on the part of the
  office-boy, who, having regained his box, and gathered up his wits, began to
  suspect Johnny of designs on his situation. But at last Johnny and his mother
  were shown into an inner room, furnished with expensive austerity, where a
  gentleman of thirty or thirty-five (himself expensively austere of mien) sat
  at a writing-table. The gentleman asked Mrs. May one or two rather abrupt
  questions about her dead husband&mdash;dates, and so forth&mdash;and referred
  to certain notes on his table after each answer. Then Nan offered him one of
  three papers which she had been fiddling in her hand since first she passed
  the street door&mdash;her marriage "lines."</p>

  <p>"O, ah, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;of course," said the gentleman with some
  change of manner. "Of course. Quite right. Best to make sure&mdash;can't
  remember everybody. Sit down, Mrs. May. Come here, my boy. So you want to be
  an engineer, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, if you please." He never thought it would be quite so hard to
  get it out.</p>

  <p>"Ah. Plenty of hard work, you know. Not afraid of that, are you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen next month, sir."</p>

  <p>"Get on all right at school? What standard?"</p>

  <p>"Passed seventh, sir."</p>

  <p>Mrs. May handed over her other two papers: a "character" from the
  schoolmaster and another from the rector.</p>

  <p>When the gentleman had read them, "Yes, yes, very good&mdash;very good,
  indeed," he said. "But you've not finished learning yet, you know, my boy, if
  you're to be an engineer. Fond of drawing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>And Nan May chimed in: "O, yes, sir, very fond."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you stick well at your drawing in the evenings, and learn the
  theory, you'll be a foreman some day&mdash;perhaps a manager. It all depends
  on yourself. You shall have a chance to show us what you're made of. That's
  all we can do&mdash;the rest is for yourself, as I've said."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, thank-you, sir&mdash;I'll try." And Mrs. May was audibly
  thankful too, and confident of Johnny.</p>

  <p>"Very well, it's settled." The gentleman rang a bell, and bade the junior
  clerk "Just send for Cottam."</p>

  <p>"I have sent for the foreman," he went on, "whose shop you will be in.
  He'll look after you as long as you behave well and keep up to your work. You
  won't see me very often, but I shall know all about you, remember." And he
  turned to his table, and wrote.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a sudden thump at the door, which opened slowly and
  admitted the foremost partit was the abdomen&mdash;of Cottam the foreman. He
  was of middle height, though he seemed short by reason of his corpulence;
  deliberate in all his movements, yet hard, muscular, and active. He turned,
  as it were on his own axis, at the edge of the door, shut it with one hand,
  while he dangled a marine peaked cap in the other; and looked, with serene
  composure, from over his scrub of <i>grey</i> beard, first at Mrs. May, then
  at Johnny, and last at his employer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Cottam," the gentleman said, writing one more word, and letting drop
  his pen, "this lad's name is John May. I expect you'll remember his father.
  Bad accident, I believe, in the heavy turning shop; died, in fact." This with
  a slight glance at Nan May.</p>

  <p>The foreman turned&mdash;turned his whole person, for his head was set on
  his vast shoulders with no visible neck between&mdash;bent a trifle, and
  inspected Johnny as he would have inspected some wholly novel and
  revolutionary piece of machinery. "Y-u-u-us," he said, with a slowly rising
  inflection, expressive of cautious toleration, as of one reserving a definite
  opinion. "Y-u-u-us!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's to come on as apprentice, and I'd like him to come into your
  shop. There'll be no difficulty about that, will there?"</p>

  <p>"N-o-o-o!" with the same deliberate inflection, similarly expressive.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better take him down, and tell the timekeeper. He may as well
  begin on Monday, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Y-u-u-us!" tuned once more in an ascending scale. And with that the
  acting partner bade Mrs. May good-morning, turned to his writing, and the
  business was over.</p>

  <p>Cottam the foreman put his cap on his head and led the way through the
  outer office, along a corridor, down the stairs and across the yard, with no
  indecent haste. It was a good distance to go, and Johnny was vaguely reminded
  of a circus procession that had once passed through Loughton, and that he had
  followed up for nearly three miles, behind the elephant.</p>

  <p>Half-way across the yard the foreman stopped, and made a half turn, so as
  to face Nan May as she came up. He raised an immense leathery fist, and
  jerked a commensurate thumb over his shoulder. "That's the young guv'nor," he
  said in a hoarse whisper, with a confidential twitch of one cheek that was
  almost a wink. "That's the young guv'nor, that is. Smart young chap. Knowed
  'im so 'igh." He brought down his hand to the level of his lowest waistcoat
  button, twitched his cheek again, nodded, and walked on.</p>

  <p>The timekeeper inhabited a little wooden cabin just within the gates, and
  looked out of a pigeon-hole at all comers. Mr. Cottam put his head into this
  hole&mdash;a close fit&mdash;and when he withdrew it, the timekeeper, a grey
  man, came out of his side door and stared hard at Johnny. Then he growled
  "All right," and went in again.</p>

  <p>"Six o'clock o' Monday mornin,'" Mr. Cottam pronounced conclusively,
  addressing Mrs. May. "Six o'clock o' Monday mornin'. <i>'Ere</i>," with a
  downward jerk of his thumb to make it plain that somewhere else would not do.
  Then, without a glance at Johnny, whom he had disregarded since they left the
  office, he turned and walked off. Johnny and his mother were opening the
  small door that was cut in the great gate, when Mr.</p>

  <p>Cottam stopped and turned. "Mornin!'" he roared, and went on.</p>

  <p>Mother and boy went their way joyously. Here was one of Nan May's troubles
  dissolved in air, and as for Johnny, a world of wonders was before him. Now
  he would understand how steam made engines go, and all day he would see them
  going&mdash;he would make engines himself, in fact. And for this delightful
  pursuit he would be paid. Six shillings a week was what apprentices got in
  their first year&mdash;a shilling for every day of work. Next year he would
  get eight shillings, and then ten, and so on. And at twenty-one he would be a
  man indeed, an engineer like his father before him. More, he was to draw. The
  gentleman had told him to draw in his spare time. The clang of hammers was as
  a merry peal from the works that lined their way, and the hoots of steamships
  on the river made them a moving music.</p>

  <p>Nan May wondered to see such merry faces about the streets on the way
  home. Truly the place was changed; but, perhaps, after all, it was no such
  bad place, even now. The street was quiet where they had seen the drunken
  woman, though two very small boys were still kicking a filthy slice of bacon
  about the gutter. But three streets beyond they saw her for a moment. For the
  blackguard boys had contrived to topple Mother Born-drunk into a hand-barrow,
  which they were now trundling along at such a pace that the bedraggled
  sufferer could do no more than lie and cling to the rails, a gasping,
  uncleanly heap. Truly Emma Pacers punishment was upon her.</p>

  <p>Bessy brightened wonderfully at the news of Johnny's success. For she was
  thoughtful and "old-fashioned" even among the prematurely sage girl-children
  of her class, and she had been fretting silently. Now she hopped about with
  something of her old activity. She reported that the next-door neighbour on
  the left had been persistently peeping over the wall, and that just before
  their arrival the peep had been accompanied by a very artificial cough, meant
  to attract attention. So Mrs. May went into the back-yard.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', mum," said the next-door neighbour, a very red-faced man in a
  dungaree jacket. "Weather's cleared up a bit. I've bin 'avin' 'alf a day auf,
  touchin' up things." He sank with a bob behind the wall, and rose again with
  a paint-pot in his lifted hand. "Bit o' red paint any use to ye?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE red paint-pot, and a blue one from the same quarter,
  together with a yellow one from the neighbours on the other side, a white one
  from an old lighterman in the house behind, and a suitable collection of
  brushes subscribed by all three, were Johnny's constant companions till the
  end of that weary week. The shop-shutters grew to be red, with a blue border.
  The window-frames were yellow, the wall beneath was white, so was the cornice
  above; and the door and the door-posts were red altogether, because the red
  paint went farthest, and the red pot had been fullest to begin with. Not only
  did the length of the job work off Johnny's first enthusiasm, but its
  publicity embarrassed him. Perched conspicuously on a step-ladder, painting a
  shop in such stirring colours as these, he was the cynosure of all wayfaring
  folk, the target of whatever jibes their wits might compass. Three out of
  four warned him that the paint was laid on wrong side out. Some, in unkindly
  allusion to certain chance splashes, reminded him that he hadn't half painted
  the window-panes; and facetious boys, in piteous pantomime, affected to be
  reduced to instant blindness by sudden knowledge of Johnny's brilliant
  performance. But he was most discomforted by those who merely stood and
  stared, invisible behind him. If only he could have seen them it would not
  have been so bad; the oppressive consciousness that some contemptuous grown
  man behind and below&mdash;possibly a painter by trade&mdash;was narrowly
  observing every stroke of the brush, shook his nerve and enfeebled his
  execution. Most of these earnest spectators seemed to have no pressing
  business of their own, and their inspections were prolonged. One critic found
  speech to remark, as he turned to go his way: "Well, you are makin' a
  bloomin' mess up there!" But most, as if at a loss for words by mere
  amazement, sheered off with: "Well, blimy!" It was discouraging to find that
  all these people could have done it so much better, and, long before the job
  was finished, Johnny was sore depressed and very humble, as well as tired.
  Only one of all his witnesses offered help, and he was a surprising person:
  very tall, very thin, and very sooty from work; with splay feet, sloping
  shoulders, a long face of exceeding diffidence, and long arms, which seemed
  to swing and flap irresponsibly with the skirts of his long overcoat, and to
  be a subject of mute apology. He saw Johnny tip-toeing at the very top of the
  steps, making a bad shift to reach the cornice. He stopped, looked about him,
  and then went on a step or two; stopped again, and came back, with a timorous
  glance at the shop window; and when Johnny turned and looked, he said, in a
  voice scarce above a whisper: "Can'tcher reach it?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well."</p>

  <p>"Let's come." And when Johnny descended, the long man, with one more
  glance about the street, went up three steps at a time and laid the paint on
  rapidly, many feet at a sweep. He came down and shifted the steps very easily
  with one hand&mdash;and they were heavy steps&mdash;went up again, and in
  three minutes carried the paint to the very end of the cornice. Then he came
  down, with a sheepish smile at Johnny's thanks, and shambled as far as next
  door, where he let himself in with a latch-key. And on Friday, at
  dinner-time, perceiving Johnny's progress from his window on the upper
  floor&mdash;he was a lodger, it seemed&mdash;he came stealthily down and gave
  the cornice another coat.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>On Saturday morning the shop was opened in form, though Johnny's painting
  was not finished till dusk. Very little happened. A few children stopped on
  their way, and stared in at the door. The first customer was a boy from among
  these, who came in to beg a piece of string; and infested Harbour Lane for
  the rest of the day, swinging a dead rat on the end of it. Hours passed, and
  Nan May's spirits fell steadily. A few pounds, a very few&mdash;they could
  scarce be made to last three weeks&mdash;was all her reserve, and most of her
  scanty stock was perishable. If it spoiled it could never be replaced, and
  unless people bought it, spoil it must. What more could she do? Industry,
  determination, and all the rest were well enough, but when all was said and
  done, nothing could make people come and buy.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Near noon the second customer came&mdash;a little girl this time. She
  wanted a bottle of ink for a halfpenny. There were half-a dozen little
  bottles of ink in a row in the window; but the price was a penny, so the
  little girl went away. It was a dull dinner that day. Bessy invented
  ingenious conjectures to account for the lack of trade, and prophesied a
  change in the afternoon, or the evening, or perhaps next week, or at latest
  the week after. Her mother could not understand. Customers came to other
  shops; why not to this one?<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>She had seen nothing of Uncle Isaac since she had come to Harbour Lane,
  though he knew where to find her. She had hoped he would lend a hand with the
  painting, or with the display of the stock; but no doubt he had been too
  busy. True, Johnny thought he had seen him once from the steps, some way down
  the street, but that must have been a mistake; for Uncle Isaac would not have
  come so near them without calling, nor would he have bolted instantly round
  the nearest corner at sight of the boy and his work, as Johnny had fancied he
  had.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The afternoon began no better than the morning. Nobody came but a child,
  who asked for sixpenn'orth of coppers, till abont four. Then a hurried woman
  demanded a penn'orth of mixed pickles in a saucer, and grumbled at the
  quantity. She wonldn't come into the shop again, at anyrate; a threat so
  discomposing (for was not the woman the first paying customer?) that for
  hours Nan May could not forgive herself for her illiberality; though indeed
  she gained but a weak fraction of a farthing by the transaction.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Half an hour more went, and then there came a truly noble customer. He
  looked like a bricklayer, and he was far from sober: so far, indeed, that
  Johnny, on the steps, spying the mazy sinuosity of his approach, got a step
  lower and made ready to jump, in case of accidents. But the bricklayer,
  conscious of the presence of many ladders, steered wide into the roadway, and
  there stopped, fascinated by the brilliancy before him. Some swaying moments
  of consideration resolved him that this was a shop: and after many steps up
  the curb, and as many back in the gutter, he picked a labyrinthine path among
  the myriad ladders, narrowly missing the real one as he went, shouldered
  against the wet door-post, and stumbled toward the counter. Here he regarded
  a bladder of lard with thoughtful severity, till Nan May timorously asked
  what he wanted.</p>

  <p>"Shumm for kidsh," he replied sternly, to the lard. "Shummforkidsh." For
  some moments his scowl deepened; then he raised his hand and pointed.
  "W&mdash;wha'sha'?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Lard."</p>

  <p>"Tharr'll do." He plunged his hand into his trousers pocket. "Tharr'll do.
  'Ow mush?"</p>

  <p>"Sevenpence halfpenny a pound."</p>

  <p>"Orrigh'? Gi's 'oldovit." He reached an unsteady hand, imperilling
  -bottles; but Nan May was quicker, and took the bladder of lard from its
  perch.</p>

  <p>"How much?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"'Ow much? Thash wha' I wan' know. You give it 'ere, go on." His voice
  rose disputatively, and he fell on the bladder of lard with both hands. "'Ow
  mush?"</p>

  <p>Nan reflected that it weighed more than three pounds, and that she had
  paid Mr. Dunkin eighteenpence for it. "Two shillings," she said.</p>

  <p>"Two shillin'. Orrigh'," and instantly what remained of the new customer's
  week's wages was scattered about the counter. Mrs. May took two shillings and
  returned the rest; which with some difficulty was thrust back into the
  pocket. And the new customer, after looking narrowly about him in search of
  his purchase, and at last discovering it under his arm, sallied forth with a
  wipe against the other door-post, and continued his winding way: a solemn and
  portentous bricklayer, with red paint on his shoulders and whiskers, and a
  bladder of lard that slipped sometimes forward and sometimes backward from
  his embrace, and was a deal of trouble to pick up again.</p>

  <p>Here was a profit of sixpence at a stroke, unlikely as the chance was to
  recur; and it raised Nan's spirits, unreasonably enough. Still, the
  bricklayer brought luck of a sort. For there were three more customers within
  the next hour, two bringing a halfpenny and one a penny. And in the evening
  five or six came, one spending as much as fourpence. This was better,
  perhaps, but poor enough. At ten that night Nan May reckoned her profit for
  the day at ninepence farthing, including the bricklayer's sixpence; and she
  was sick with waiting and faint with fear. At half-past ten Uncle Isaac
  turned up.</p>

  <p>"Ah hum," he said; "bin paintin'. Might 'a' laid it on a bit evener.
  There's right ways o' layin' on paint, an' there's wrong ways, an' one way
  ain't the same as the other." He raised his finger at Johnny instructively.
  "Far from it and contrairy, there's a great difference." Uncle Isaac paused,
  and no further amplification of his proposition occurring to him, he turned
  to Mrs. May. "'Ow's trade?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Nan May shook her head sadly. "Very bad, uncle," she said. "Hardly any at
  all." And she felt nearer crying than ever since the funeral.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Uncle Isaac, sitting on a packing case&mdash;empty, but
  intended to look full; "ah, what you want's Enterprise. Enterprise; that's
  what you want. What is it as stimilates trade an' encourages prosperity
  to&mdash;to the latest improvements? Enterprise. Why is commercial
  opulentness took&mdash;at least, wafted&mdash;commercial opulentness wafted
  round the 'ole world consekince o' what? Consekince o' Enterprise." Uncle
  Isaac tapped the counter with his forefinger and gazed solemnly in Nan May's
  troubled face. "Consekince o' Enterprise," he repeated slowly, with another
  tap. Then he added briskly, with a glance at the inner door: "'Adjer
  supper?"</p>

  <p>"No, uncle," Nan answered. "I never thought of it. But, now you're here,
  p'raps you'll have a bit with us?"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;don't mind if I do," Uncle Isaac responded cheerfully. "That
  looks a nice little bit o' bacon. Now a rasher auf that, an' a hegg&mdash;got
  a hegg? O yus." He saw a dozen in a basin. "A rasher auf that, an' a hegg or
  two, 'ud be just the thing, with a drop o' beer, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>Johnny fetched the beer, and Uncle Isaac had two rashers and four eggs;
  and he finished with a good solid piece of bread, and the first slice&mdash;a
  large one&mdash;out of the Dutch cheese from the counter. Nan May made no
  more than a pretence at eating a little bread and cheese.</p>

  <p>When at last the jug was empty, and Uncle Isaac was full, he leaned back
  in his chair, and for some minutes exercised his lips in strange workings and
  twistings, with many incidental clicks and sucks and fizzes, while he
  benignantly contemplated the angle of the ceiling. When at last the display
  flagged, he brought his gaze gradually lower, till it rested on the
  diminished piece of bacon. "None so bad, that bacon," he observed, putting
  his head aside with a critical regard. "Though p'raps rayther more of a
  breakfast specie than a supper." He laid his head to the other side, as one
  anxious to be impartial. "Yus," he went on thoughtfully, "more of a breakfast
  specie, as you might say." Then after a pause, he added, with the air of one
  announcing a brilliant notion:&mdash;"I b'lieve&mdash;yus, I <i>do</i>
  b'lieve I'll try a bit for breakfast to-morrer mornin'!"</p>

  <p>"If you like, uncle," Nan answered, a little faintly.
  "But&mdash;but&mdash;" timidly&mdash;"I was thinking p'raps it'll make it
  look rather small to&mdash;to put on the counter."</p>

  <p>"So it would&mdash;so it would," Uncle Isaac admitted frankly; and indeed
  the remaining piece was scarce of four rashers' capacity. "Pity to cut it, as
  you say, Nan. Thanks&mdash;I'll just wrop it up as it is. It'll come in for
  Monday too; an' that large bit o' streaky'll look a deal more nobler on the
  counter."</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac's visit swept away the day's profits and a trifle more. But
  certainly, Uncle Isaac must not be offended now that things looked so gloomy
  ahead.</p>

  <p>Bessy lay, and strained her wits far into the night, inventing comfortable
  theories and assurances, and exchanging them with her mother for others as
  hopeful. But in the morning each pillow had its wet spot.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT Monday saw another beginning. Johnny must rise soon
  after five now, to reach his work at six; but on this, the first morning, he
  was awake and eager at half-past four. Early as he was, his mother was before
  him, and as he pulled his new white ducks over his every-day clothes he could
  hear her moving below. Nan May was resolved that the boy should go out to
  begin the world fed and warm at least, and as cheerful as might be.</p>

  <p>For this one morning Johnny felt nothing of the sleepy discomfort of any
  house in pitch dark a little before five. Two breakfasts were ready for him,
  one for the present moment (which he scarce touched, for he was excited), and
  another in a basin and a red handkerchief, for use at the workshop, with a
  new tin can full of coffee. For the half-hour allowed for breakfast would
  scarce suffice for the mere hurrying home and hurrying back again; and the
  full hour at midday would give him bare time for dinner with his mother.</p>

  <p>Bessy was infected with the excitement, and stumped downstairs to honour
  Johnny's setting out. He left the shop-door half an hour too soon, with a
  boot flung after him. The darkness of the street seemed more solid at this
  hour than ever at midnight, and it almost smothered the faint gas-lights. Now
  and again a touch of sleet came down the wind, and a little dirty,
  half-melted snow of yesterday made the ways sloppy. Nobody was about, to view
  the manly glory of Johnny's white ducks, and he was not sorry now that his
  overcoat largely hid them, for the wind was cold. And he reflected with
  satisfaction that the warming of his coffee on a furnace would smoke the
  inglorious newness off the tin can ere he carried it home in the open
  day.</p>

  <p>The one or two policemen he met regarded him curiously, for workmen were
  not yet moving. But the coffee-stall was open by the swing bridge, and here
  the wind came over the river with an added chill. The coffee-stall keeper had
  no customers, and on the bridge and in the straight street beyond it nobody
  was in sight. Till presently a small figure showed indistinctly ahead, and
  crossed the road as though to avoid him. It moved hurriedly, keeping timidly
  to the wall, and Johnny saw it was a girl of something near his own age. He
  tramped on, and the girl, once past, seemed to gather courage, turned, and
  made a few steps after him. At this he stopped, and she spoke from a few
  yards off. She was a decently-dressed and rather a pretty girl, as he could
  see by the bad light of the nearest lamp, but her face was drawn with alarm,
  and her eyes were wet.</p>

  <p>"Please have you seen a lady anywhere?" she asked tremulously. "Ill?"</p>

  <p>Johnny had seen no lady, ill or well, and when he said no, the young girl,
  with a weak "Thank-you," hastened on her way. It was very odd, thought
  Johnny, as he stared into the dark where she vanished. Who should lose a
  lady&mdash;ill&mdash;in Blackwall streets at this time of a pitch dark
  morning? As he thought, there rose in his mind the picture of gran'dad,
  straying and bloody and sick to death, that night that seemed so far away,
  though it was but a month or two since. Maybe the lady had wandered from her
  bed in some such plight as that. Johnny was sorry for the girl's trouble, and
  would have liked to turn aside and join in her search; but this was the hour
  of great business of his own, and he went his way about it.</p>

  <p>The policemen were knocking at doors now, rousing workmen, who answered
  with shouts from within. An old night-watchman, too, scurrying his hardest
  (for he had farther to go than the policemen), banged impatiently at the
  knockers of the more conservative and old-fashioned. And as Johnny neared
  Maidment and Hurst's, the streets grew busy with the earliest
  workmen&mdash;those who lived farthest from their labour.</p>

  <p>Maidment and Hurst's gate was shut fast; he was far too soon. He tried the
  little door that was cut in the great gate, but that was locked. He wondered
  if he ought to knock; and did venture on a faint tap of the knuckles. But he
  might as well have tapped the brick wall. Moreover, a passing apprentice
  observed the act, and guffawed aloud. "Try down the airey, mate," was his
  advice.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So Johnny stood and waited, keeping the new tin can where the gaslight
  over the gate should not betray its unsmoked brightness, and trying to look
  as much like an old hand as possible. But the passing men grinned at each
  other, jerking their heads toward him, and Johnny felt that somehow he was
  known for a greenhorn. The apprentices, immeasurable weeks ahead of him in
  experience, flung ironic advice and congratulation. "Hooray! Extry quarter
  for you, mate!" two or three said; one earnestly advising him to "chalk it on
  the gaffer's 'at, so's 'e won't forget." And still another shouted in tones
  of extravagant indignation:&mdash;"What? On'y jes' come? They bin a-waitin'
  for ye ever since the pubs shut!"<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>At length the timekeeper came, sour and grey, and tugged at a vertical
  iron bell-handle which Johnny had not perceived. The bell brought the
  night-watchman, with a lantern and a clank of keys, and the timekeeper
  stepped through the little door with a growl in acknowledgment. He left the
  door ajar, and Johnny, after a moment's hesitation, stepped in after him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cottam told me to come this morning, sir," he said, 'before the
  timekeeper had quite disappeared into his box. "My name's May."</p>

  <p>The timekeeper turned and growled again, that being his usual manner of
  conversation. "Awright," he continued. "You wait there till 'e comes in
  then." And it was many months ere Johnny next heard him say so much at
  once.</p>

  <p>The timekeeper began hanging round metal tickets on a great board studded
  with hooks, a ticket to each hook, in numbered order. Presently a man came in
  at the door, selected a ticket from the board, and dropped it through a slot
  into what seemed to be a big money-box. Then three came together, and each
  did the same. Then there came a stream of men and boys, and the board grew
  barer of tickets and barer. In the midst came Mr. Cottam, suddenly appearing
  within the impossibly small wicket as by a conjuring trick.</p>

  <p>He tramped heavily straight ahead, apparently unconscious of Johnny. But
  as he came by he dropped his hand on the boy's shoulder, and, gazing steadily
  ahead: "Well, me lad!" he roared, much as though addressing somebody at a
  window of the factory across the yard.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir," Johnny answered, walking at the foreman's side by
  compulsion; for the hand, however friendly, was the heaviest and strongest he
  had ever felt.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cottam went several yards in silence, still gripping Johnny's
  shoulder. Then he spoke again. "Mother all right?" he asked fiercely, still
  addressing the window.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, thank-you."</p>

  <p>They walked on, and entered the factory. "This 'ere," said Mr. Cottam,
  turning on Johnny at last and glaring at him sternly: "this 'ere's the big
  shop. 'Eavy work. There's a big cylinder for the noo Red Star boat." He led
  his prisoner through the big shop, this way and that among the great lathes
  and planers, lit by gas from the rafters; and up a staircase to another
  workshop. "'Ere we are," said Mr. Cottam, releasing Johnny's shoulder at
  last. "Y'ain't a fool, are ye? Know what a lathe is, doncher, an' beltin',
  an' shaftin'? Awright. Needn't do nothin' 'fore breakfast. Look about an' see
  things, an' don't get in mischief. I got me eye on ye."</p>

  <p>The foreman left him, and began to walk along the lines of machines; and
  the nearest apprentice grinned at Johnny, and winked. Johnny looked about, as
  the foreman had advised. This place, where he was to learn to make engines,
  and where he was to work day by day till he was twenty-one, and a man, was a
  vast room with skylights in the roof: though this latter circumstance he did
  not notice till after breakfast, when the gas was turned off, and daylight
  penetrated from above. A confusion of heavy raftering stretched below the
  roof, carrying belted shafting everywhere; and every man bent over his
  machine or his bench, for Cottam was a sharp gaffer. Johnny watched the
  leading hand scribing curves on metal along lines already set out by
  punctured dots. "Lining off," said the leading hand, seeing the boy's
  interest. And then, leaning over to speak, because of the workshop din:
  "Centre-dabs," he added, pointing to the dots. <i>That,</i> at least, Johnny
  resolved not to forget: lining off and centre-dabs.</p>

  <p>For some reason&mdash;perhaps the usual reason, perhaps
  another&mdash;three or four of the men were "losing a quarter" that Monday
  morning, and some of them were men with whom young apprentices had been
  working. Consequently, Cottam, in addition to his general supervision, had to
  keep particular watch on these mentorless lads, and Johnny learned a little
  from the gaffer's remarks.</p>

  <p>"Well, wotjer doin' with that file?" he would ask of one. "You ain't
  a-playin' cat's cradle <i>now,</i> me lad! Look 'ere, keep 'er level, like
  this! It's a file, it ain't a rockin'-'orse!"</p>

  <p>Or he would come behind another who was chipping bye-metal, and using a
  hammer with more zeal than skill. He would watch for a moment, and then break
  out, "Well, you <i>are</i> fond o' exercise, I must say! Good job you're
  strong enough to stand it. <i>I</i> ain't. My constitootion won't allow me to
  'old a 'ammer like this 'ere." This with a burlesque of the lad's stiff grasp
  and whole-arm action. "It 'ud knock me up. Bein' a more delicate sort o'
  person," (his arm was near as thick as the boy's waist) "I 'old a 'ammer like
  this&mdash;see!" And he took the shaft end loosely in his fingers and
  hammered steadily and firmly from the wrist. Johnny saw that and
  remembered.</p>

  <p>Again, half an hour later, stopping at the elbow of another apprentice, a
  little older than the last: "Come," said the foreman, "that's a noo idea,
  that is! Takin' auf the skin from cast iron with a bran' noo file! I 'ope
  you've patented it. An' I 'ope you won't come an' want another file in about
  'alf an hour, 'cos if you do you won't git it!" Whereat Johnny, astonished to
  learn that cast iron had a skin, resolved not to forget that you shouldn't
  take it off with a new file, and made a mental note to ask somebody why.</p>

  <p>Presently, as he came by the long fitting-bench, Johnny grew aware of a
  fitter, immensely tall and very thin, who grinned and nodded in furtive
  recognition. It was, indeed, the next door lodger, who had painted the
  cornice. He was very large, Johnny thought, to be so shy; he positively
  blushed as he grinned. "You come to this shop?" he asked in his odd whisper,
  as he stooped to judge the fit of his work. "I'm beddin' down a junk ring;
  p'raps the gaffer'll put you to 'elp me after breakfast."</p>

  <p>Bedding down a junk ring sounded advanced and technical, and Johnny felt
  taller at the prospect. He would learn what a junk ring was, probably, when
  he had to help bed it down. Meanwhile he watched the tall man, as he brought
  the metal to an exact face.</p>

  <p>"Stop in to breakfast?" the man asked, as he stooped again.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Some o' the boys '11 try a game with ye, p'raps. Don't mind a little
  game, do ye?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I couldn't stand it when I was a lad. Made me mis'rable. When ye go
  in the smiths' shop to git yer breakfast, look about ye, if they're special
  kind find-in' y' a seat. Up above, f'r instance."</p>

  <p>Johnny left the long man, and presently observed that the foreman was not
  in the shop. There was an instant slackness perceivable among the younger and
  less steady men, for the leading hand had no such authority as Cottam. One
  man at a lathe, throwing out his gear examined his work, and, turning to
  Johnny, said, "Look 'ere, me lad; I want to true this 'ere bit. Jes' you go
  an' ask Sam Wilkins&mdash;that man up at the end there, in the serge
  jacket&mdash;jes' you go an' ask 'im for the round square."</p>

  <p>Johnny knew the tool called a square, used for testing the truth of
  finished work, though he had never seen a round one. Howbeit he went off with
  alacrity: but it seemed that Sam Wilkins hadn't the round square. It was Joe
  Mills, over in the far corner. So he tried Joe Mills; but he, it seemed, had
  just lent it to Bob White, at the biggest shaping-machine near the other end.
  Bob White understood perfectly, but thought he had last seen the round square
  in the possession of George Walker. Whereas George Walker was perfectly
  certain that it had gone downstairs to Bill Cook in the big shop. Doubting
  nothing from the uncommonly solemn faces of Sam and Joe and Bob and George,
  Johnny set off down the stone stairs, where he met the ascending gaffer, on
  his way back from the pattern-maker's shop.</p>

  <p>"'Ullo boy," he said, "where you goin'?"</p>

  <p>"Downstairs, sir, for the round square."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cottam's eyes grew more prominent, and there were certain sounds, as
  of an imprisoned bull-frog, from somewhere deep in his throat. But his
  expression relaxed not a shade. Presently he said, "Know what a round
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes sir."</p>

  <p>"Know what a square is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes sir."</p>

  <p>"S'pose somebody wanted a round square drored on paper, what 'ud ye
  do?"</p>

  <p>There was another internal croak, and somehow Johnny felt emboldened. "I
  think," he said, with some sly hesitation, "I think I'd tell 'em to do it
  themselves."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cottam croaked again, louder, and this time with a heave of the chest.
  "Awright," he said, "that's good enough. Better say somethink like that to
  them as sent ye. That's a very old 'ave, that is."</p>

  <p>He resumed his heavy progress up the stairs, turning Johnny round by the
  shoulder, and sending him in front. There were furtive grins in the shop, and
  one lad asked "Got it?" in a voice cautiously subdued. But just then the bell
  rang for breakfast.</p>

  <p>Most of the men and several of the boys made their best pace for the gate.
  These either lived near, or got their breakfasts at coffee-shops, and their
  half-hour began and ended in haste. The few others, more leisurely, stayed to
  gather their cans and handkerchiefs&mdash;some to wipe their hands on cotton
  waste, that curious tangled stuff by which alone Johnny remembered his
  father. As for him, he waited to do what the rest did, for he saw that his
  friend, the long man, had gone out with the patrons of coffee-shops. The boys
  took their cans and clattered down to the smiths' shop, Johnny well in the
  rear, for he was desirous of judging from a safe distance, what form the
  "little game" might take, that the long man had warned him of, in case it
  came soon. But a wayward fate preserved him from booby-traps that
  morning.</p>

  <p>In the first place, he had come in a cap, and so for-fended one ordeal.
  For it was the etiquette of the shop among apprentices that any bowler hat
  brought in on the head of a new lad must be pinned to the wall with the tangs
  of many files; since a bowler hat, ere a lad had four years at least of
  service, was a pretension, a vainglory, and an outrage. Next, his lagging
  saved his new ducks. The first lads down had prepared the customary trap,
  which consisted of a seat of honour in the best place near the fire; a seat
  doctored with a pool of oil, and situated exactly beneath a rafter on which
  stood a can of water taken from a lathe; a string depending from the can,
  with its lower end fastened behind the seat. So that the victim accepting the
  accommodation would receive a large oily embellishment on his new white
  ducks, and, by the impact of his back against the string, induce a copious
  christening of himself and his entire outfit. But it chanced that an elderly
  journeyman from the big shop&mdash;old Ben Cutts&mdash;appeared on the scene
  early, wiping his spectacles on his jacket lining as he came. He knew nothing
  of a fresh 'prentice, saw nothing but a convenient and warm seat, and
  hastened to seize it.</p>

  <p>The lads were taken by surprise. "No&mdash;not there!" shouted one a few
  yards away.</p>

  <p>"Fust come fust served, me lad," chuckled old Ben Cutts, as he dropped on
  the fatal spot. "'Ere I am, an' 'ere I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With that the can fell, and Johnny at the door was astonished to observe a
  grey-headed workman, with a pair of spectacles in his hand and a vast oily
  patch on his white overalls, dripping and dancing and swearing, and smacking
  wildly at the heads of the boys about him, without hitting any.</p>

  <p>There were no more tricks that breakfast-time. For when at length old Ben
  subsided to his meal, he put a little pile of wedges by his side, to fling at
  the first boy of whose behaviour he might disapprove. And as his spectacles
  were now on his nose, and his aim, thus aided, was known to be no bad one,
  and as the wedges, furthermore, were both hard and heavy, breakfasts were
  eaten with all the decorum possible in a smiths' shop.</p>

  <p>Johnny's new can was satisfactorily blackened, and his breakfast was well
  disposed of. Such youths as tried him with verbal chaff he answered as well
  as he might, though he had as yet little of the Cockney boy's readiness. And
  at last the bell rang again, and the break-fasters went back to work.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cottam, casting his glance about the shop in search of the simplest
  possible job for Johnny to begin on, with a steady man at hand to watch him,
  stopped as his gaze reached Long Hicks, and sent Johnny to help him with his
  bolts. And so Johnny found the tall man's surmise verified, and the tall man
  himself received him with another grin a little less shy. He set him to
  running down bolts and nuts, showing him how to fix the bolt in a vice and
  work the nut on it with a spanner. Johnny fell to the task enthusiastically,
  and so the morning went.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Nan May opened shop, she saw that men were pulling down
  as much of the ship-yard wall opposite as stood between two chalk lines. She
  thought no more of the thing at the time, not guessing how nearly it
  concerned her. For this was to be a new workmen's gate to the ship-yard and
  passing workmen might change the fortunes of a shop. For that day, however,
  there was no sign but the demand of a bricklayer's labourer for a penn'orth
  of cheese.</p>

  <p>It was as bad a day as Saturday, in the matter of trade&mdash;indeed there
  was no drunken man to buy lard&mdash;and the woman's heart grew heavier as
  the empty hours went. Bessy stood at the back-parlour door, pale and anxious,
  but striving to lift a brave face. Before one o'clock there was dinner to be
  prepared; not that either Bessy or her mother could eat, but for Johnny. And
  at a quarter past one both met him at the door as cheerfully as they could;
  and indeed they were eager to hear of his fortunes. They wondered to see him
  coming with the long man who lived next door; and the long man, for his part,
  was awkward and nervous when he saw them. At first he hung back, as though to
  let Johnny go on alone; but he changed his mind, and came striding ahead
  hastily, looking neither to right nor to left, and plunged in at his
  door.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Johnny was hungry and in high spirits. He and Long Hicks, it seemed, had
  been bedding down a junk ring for a piston, Johnny easing the bolts and nuts,
  and Long Hicks doing the other work. He said nothing of the round square, but
  talked greatly of slide-valves and cranks, till Bessy judged him a full
  engineer already. Between his mouthfuls he illustrated the proper handling of
  hammer and file, and reprehended the sinful waste of spoiling the surface of
  a new file on the outer skin of a fresh iron casting. It cheered Nan May to
  see the boy taking so heartily to his work, through all her secret dread that
  she might lack the means to keep him at it. Johnny glanced anxiously at the
  clock from time to time, and at last declared that he must knock for Long
  Hicks, who was plainly forgetting how late it was. And in the end he rushed
  away to disturb the tall man ten minutes too soon, and hurried off to
  Maidment and Hurst's, there to take his own new metal ticket from the great
  board, and drop it duly into the box.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The afternoon went busily at the factory, and busy days followed. Johnny
  acquired his first tool, a steel foot-rule, and carried it in public places
  with a full quarter of its length visible at the top of its appointed pocket.
  It was the way of all young apprentices to do this; the rule, they would say,
  thus being carried convenient for the hand. But it was an exact science among
  the observant to judge a lad's experience inversely by scale of the inches
  exposed, going at the rate of half an inch a year. A lad through two years of
  his "time" would show no more of his rule than two inches; by the end of four
  years one of these inches would have vanished; as his twenty-first birthday
  approached, the last inch shrank to a mere hint of bright metal; and nobody
  ever saw the foot-rule of a full journeyman, except he were using it.</p>

  <p>Johnny's christening, postponed by the accident of old Ben Cutts, came
  when he was first put to a small lathe to try his hand at turning bolts. For
  when, returning from breakfast, he belted his lathe, he did not perceive that
  the water-can had been tied to the belt; realising it, however, the next
  instant, when it flew over the shafting and discharged the water on his head.
  Then he was free of the shop; suffering no more than the rest from the
  workshop pranks habitual among the younger lads, and joining in them:
  gammoning newer lads than himself with demands for the round square, and
  oppressing them with urgent messages to testy gaffers&mdash;that a cockroach
  had got in the foo-foo valve, that the donkey-man wanted an order for a new
  nosebag, and the like.</p>

  <p>Grew able, moreover, in workshop policy, making good interest with the
  storekeeper, who might sometimes oblige with the loan of a hammer. For a lost
  hammer meant a fine of three-and-sixpence, and when yours was
  stolen&mdash;everybody stole everybody else's hammer&mdash;a borrowed one
  would tide you over till you could steal another. Making friends, too, with
  the tool-smith, at a slight expense in drinks; though able to punish him also
  if necessary, by the secret bedevilment of his fire with iron borings.
  Learned to manufacture an apparent water-crack by way of excuse for a broken
  file&mdash;a water-crack made with a touch of grease well squeezed between
  the broken ends. In short, became an initiated 'prentice engineer. In the
  trade itself, moreover, he was not slow, and Mr. Cottam had once mentioned
  him (though Johnny did not know it) as "none so bad a boy; one as can work
  'is own 'ead." Until his first enthusiasm had worn off, he never ceased from
  questioning Long Hicks, in his hours of leisure, on matters concerning
  steam-engines; so that the retiring Hicks grew almost out of touch with the
  accordion that had been the solace of his solitude. The tall man had never
  met quite so inquisitive an apprentice; engineering was in the blood, he
  supposed. He had guessed the boy's mother an engineer's wife when first
  Johnny came to his bench, because of the extra button Nan May had been
  careful to sew on his jacket cuff; a button used to tighten the sleeve, that
  it might not catch the driver on a lathe.</p>

  <p>It was early in Johnny's experience&mdash;indeed he had been scarce a
  fortnight at the engine-shop&mdash;when a man coming in from an outdoor job
  just before dinner told Cottam the foreman, that an old friend was awaiting
  him at the gate, looking for a job.</p>

  <p>"An' 'oo's the of friend?" asked Cottam, severely distrustful.</p>

  <p>"Mr. 'Enery Butson, Esquire," the man answered, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"What? Butson?" the gaffer ejaculated, and his eyes grew rounder. "Butson?
  Agen? I'd&mdash;damme, I'd as soon 'ave a brass monkey!" And Mr. Cottam
  stumped indignantly up the shop.</p>

  <p>"Sing'lar, that," observed a labourer who was helping an erector with a
  little yacht engine near Johnny's bench. "Sing'lar like what I 'eard the
  gaffer say at Lumley's when Butson wanted a job there. 'What?' sez 'e.
  'Butson? Why, I'd rayther 'ave a chaney dawg auf my gran'mother's
  mantelpiece,' 'e sez. ''E wouldn't spile castin's,' 'e sez."</p>

  <p>There were grins between the men who heard, for it would seem that Mr.
  Butson was not unknown among them. But when Johnny told his mother at dinner,
  she thought the men rude and ignorant; and she was especially surprised at
  Mr. Cottam.</p>

  <p>For some little while Johnny wondered at the girl who was hunting for a
  sick lady in the street on that dark Monday morning. He looked out for her on
  his way to and from his work, resolved, if he met her, to ask how the search
  had fared, and how the lady was. But he saw nothing of her, and the thing
  began to drop from his mind. Till a Saturday afternoon, when he went to see a
  new "ram" launched; for half-way to the ship-yard he saw a pretty
  girl&mdash;and surely it was the same. In no tears nor trouble now, indeed,
  but most disconcertingly composed and dignified&mdash;yet surely the same.
  Johnny hesitated, and stopped: and then most precipitately resumed his walk.
  For truly this was a very awful young person, icily unconscious of him, her
  casual glance flung serenely through his head and over it...Perhaps it wasn't
  the same, after all; and if not&mdash;well it was lucky he had said
  nothing...Nevertheless his inner feeling was that he had made no mistake;
  more, that the girl remembered him, but was proud and would not own it. It
  didn't matter, he said to himself. But the afternoon went a little flat; the
  launch was less interesting than one might have expected. There was a great
  'iron hull, tricked out with flags; and when men knocked away the dog-shores
  with sledge-hammers, the ship slid away, cradle and all, into the water.
  There wasn't much in that. Of course, if you knocked away the dog-shores, the
  ship was bound to slide: plainly enough. <i>That</i> wasn't very interesting.
  Johnny felt vaguely resentful of the proceedings...But still he wondered
  afresh at the lost lady who was ill out of doors so early in the morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT this launch was when Johnny's 'prentice teeth were cut:
  when the running down of bolts and pins was beneath his notice, and he could
  be trusted with work at a small nibbling machine; when he had turned
  stop-valve spindles more than once, and felt secretly confident of his
  ability to cut a screw.</p>

  <p>Meantime history was making at the shop: very slowly at first, it is true.
  The holly had been made the most of, but it seemed to attract not at all.
  Penn' orths and ha'porths were most of the sales, and even they were few. Nan
  May grew haggard and desperate. Uncle Isaac had called once soon after the
  opening Saturday, but since had been a stranger. He had said that he was
  about to change his lodgings (he was a widower), but Nan knew nothing of his
  new address. In truth, such was Uncle Isaac's tenderness of heart, that he
  disliked the sight or complaint of distress; and, in the manner of many other
  people of similar tenderness, he betook himself as far as possible from the
  scene thereof, and kept there.</p>

  <p>It was within a few days of Christmas when things seemed hopeless. Johnny,
  indeed, had never ceased to hope till now. He had talked of the certainty of
  struggling on somehow till his wages were enough for all; indeed, even the
  six shillings a week seemed something considerable now, though he knew that
  the rent alone came to ten. But even Johnny's cheerfulness 'fell in face of
  the intenser dejection, the more open tears, of his mother and sister, as the
  days wore on. Long Hicks found him a quieter, less inquisitive boy, and a
  duller help than at first; and dinner at home was a sad make-believe. Each
  knew that the other two were contrasting the coming Christmas with the last.
  Then, gran'dad was with them, hale and merry; to look out of window was to
  look through a world of frosty twigs to woody deeps where the deer waited,
  timid and shadowy, for the crusts flung out afar for them from the garden.
  Now...but there!</p>

  <p>But it was just at this desperate time that a change came, as by magic.
  The men who pulled down the wall at the opposite side of the street gave
  place to others who built a mighty brick pier at each side of the opening: a
  pier designed to carry its half of the new gate. But ere the work was near
  complete, men and boys from the yard found it a convenient place to slip out
  and in at, on breakfast-time or dinner-time errands.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced at the time that one of these men was in a domestic
  difficulty; a difficulty that a large part of the eight or nine hundred men
  of the ship-yard encountered in turn at more or less regular intervals. His
  wife inhabited the bedroom in company with a monthly nurse; while he roosted
  sleeplessly at night on a slippery horsehair couch in the parlour, or
  wallowed in a jumble of spare blankets and old coats on the floor; spending
  his home hours by day in desolate muddling in the kitchen, lost and
  incapable, and abject before the tyranny of the nurse. On dark mornings he
  made forlorn attempts at raking together a breakfast to carry with him to
  work; but as he had taken no thought to put anything into the cupboard over
  night, he found it no easy matter to extract a breakfast from it in the
  morning. So it came to pass that on the second day of his affliction this
  bedevilled husband, his hunger merely aggravated by the stale lumps of bread
  he had thought to make shift on, issued forth at the new gate in quest of
  breakfast. There was little time, and most of the shops were a distance off;
  but just opposite was a flaming little chandler's shop, newly opened. It was
  thinly stocked enough, but it would be hard luck indeed if it did not hold
  something eatable. And so Nan May's first customer that day was the starved
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Got anythink t' eat?" he asked, his ravening gaze piercing the bare
  corners of the shop. "Got any bacon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Nan May answered, reaching for the insignificant bit of
  "streaky" that was all she had.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;cooked, I mean. Aincher got any cold boiled 'ock?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Y' ought t' ave some cooked 'ock. Lots 'ud 'ave it in the yard. I can't
  eat <i>that</i>&mdash;the smiths' shop's the other end o' the yard, an' I got
  nothing to toast it with. Aincher got nothing else?"</p>

  <p>Nan May grasped the situation, and conceived an instant notion, for indeed
  she had inborn talent as a shopkeeper, though till now it had had no chance
  to show itself. "Will you wait five minutes?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Yes, he would wait five minutes, but no more: and he sat on the empty
  case, from which Uncle Isaac had delivered his recommendation of Enterprise.
  Nan May cut two rashers and retired to the shop parlour. In three minutes the
  hungry customer was hammering on the counter, declaring that he could wait no
  longer. Pacified by assurances from within, he resigned himself to a minute
  and a half more of patience: when Mrs. May returned with a massive sandwich,
  wherein the two rashers, fresh frizzled, lay between two thick slices of
  bread. Lifting the top slice for a moment, as guarantee of good faith, Nan
  May exchanged the whole ration for threepence.</p>

  <p>"If you'd like any cold boiled bacon, sir," she said, "I shall have some
  at one o'clock."</p>

  <p>He heard, but he was off at a trot with his sandwich. In five minutes Nan
  May's bonnet was on, and in five more Bessy was minding shop alone, while her
  mother hastened to Mr. Dunkin's for a hock of bacon. Here was a possible
  change of fortune, and Nan May was not a woman to waste a chance.</p>

  <p>Boiled and cooled&mdash;or cooled enough for the taste of hungry
  riveters&mdash;the hock stood in a dish on the counter at one o'clock,
  flanked by carving-knife and fork. A card, bearing the best 10 that Bessy
  could draw, advertised the price, and the first quarter-pound of slices was
  duly cut for the desolate husband, who came back, a little later, for two
  ounces more; for he had been ill-fed for two or three days, and the new baby
  made an event wherewith some extra expense was natural. Boys came for two
  other quarter-pounds, so that it was plain that the first customer had told
  others; and a loaf was cut up to go with the bacon.</p>

  <p>Mrs. May announced the new branch of trade to Johnny when he came to
  dinner; and though as yet the returns were small enough, there was a new
  chance, and his mother was hopeful of it; so he went back to the lathe with a
  lighter heart.</p>

  <p>That night the riveters worked overtime, and the bacon was in better
  demand still. More, at night two or three men took home a snack in paper, for
  supper; and from that day things grew better daily. The hock was finished by
  the afternoon of the next day, and the establishment was out of pickles; for
  men and boys who brought their own cold meat with them came now for pickles.
  Trade was better as the days went on, and Christmas, though it found them
  poor enough, was none so sad a festival after all. And in a month, when the
  gate had been formally opened for some time, and the men streamed by in
  hundreds, three large hocks would rarely last two days; and there was an
  average profit of three shillings a hock. More, the bread came in daily in
  batches, at trade price, and cheese and pickles went merrily. But what went
  best, and what increased in sale even beyond this point, was the bacon. Some
  customers called it ham, which pleased Nan May; for indeed her cooking hit
  the popular taste, and she began to feel a pride in it. Men who went home to
  dinner would buy bacon to take home for tea; and as many of these lived in
  Harbour Lane and thereabout, custom soon came from their wives, in soap and
  candles, treacle and pepper and blacking. Nan May's trade instinct grew with
  exercise. She found the particular sort of bacon that best suited her purpose
  and her customers' tastes; she had regular boilings throughout the week; she
  quickly found the trick of judging the quality of whatever she bought; and
  she bought to the best use of her money.</p>

  <p>But here it must be said that Nan May, in her new prosperity, behaved
  toward one benefactor with an undutiful forgetfulness that was near
  ingratitude. For she bought almost nothing of Mr. Dunkin. He was reasonably
  grieved. True, she had begun by getting her first stock of him, but even then
  her critical examination of what was sent showed an unworthily suspicious
  attitude of mind. She even sent back many things and demanded better,
  wilfully blind to the fact that Mr. Dunkin could turn her out of the shop at
  a week's notice if he pleased; though indeed in his own mind he was not
  vindictive, for another new tenant would be hard to find. He even submitted
  to outrage ending in actual loss and humiliation. For a large tin of mustard
  was Mrs. May's first supply, and it was a tin from among those kept for sale
  to small shopkeepers, and not on any account to be sold from retail, across
  Mr. Dunkin's own counter. But something in the feel and taste of this mustard
  did not please Nan May (though indeed <i>she</i> was not asked to eat it),
  and it went back. Now it chanced that Mr. Dunkin had taken on a new shopman
  that week, and this bungling incapable straightway began selling mustard from
  the returned tin. He had served three customers before his blunder was
  perceived, and then the matter came to light purely because the third
  customer chanced to be a food and drug inspector. This functionary gravely
  announced himself as soon as he had good hold of the parcel, and handsomely
  offered the return of a third part of the mustard, in a sealed packet. And
  the upshot was a fine of five pounds and costs for Mr. Dunkin, on the
  opinionative evidence of an analyst, who talked of starch and turmeric and
  ginger&mdash;all very excellent substances, as anybody knows. Truly it was a
  vexatious blow for Mr. Dunkin, and an unjust; for certainly the fault was not
  his, and to sell such an article, retail, was wholly against his principles.
  But he never complained, such was his forbearance: never spoke of his
  hardship to a soul, in fact, except when he "sacked" the new assistant. It
  was even said that he had offered a reporter money to keep it out of the
  papers; and though it <i>did</i> get into the papers (and at good length too)
  yet the effort was kindly meant. For truly it could but give Mrs. May pain to
  learn that she had been the cause of Mr. Dunkin's misfortune, if she were a
  woman of any feeling at all.</p>

  <p>But as time went, he began to doubt if she were, for her custom dropped
  away to nothing. The rate at which bacon was handed in from the cart of a
  firm somewhere in the Borough, was scandalous to behold. Before his very
  eyes, too, when he called for the rent. He employed a collector, but
  presently took to coming for the rent himself, that by his presence and his
  manner he might shame so thankless a tenant into some sense of decency, some
  order for bacon or mustard. He coughed gently and stared very hard at the
  incoming goods, but Nan May was in no wise abashed, and gave the carman his
  directions with shameless composure. With his sympathetic stop full out, Mr.
  Dunkin asked how trade was, and Nan May answered in proper shopkeeper terms,
  that "she mustn't grumble." With hums and purrs, he led back through casual
  questions and answers to the stock he had at first supplied, and asked her
  how she had done with this, and how that had "gone off." But her answers were
  so artlessly direct, so inconsiderately truthful, that good Mr. Dunkin was
  clean baffled, and reduced at last to a desperate hint that if anything were
  wanted he could take the order back with him. But he got no order, so he
  purred and hummed his way into Harbour Lane, and so away; and after a time
  the collector came in his stead.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dunkin resolved to wait. He had some doubts of the permanence of this
  new prosperity in the shop. The place had never brought anybody a living yet,
  and he should not feel convinced till he had seen steady trade there for some
  time. Nan May's activities could always be kept from flagging by judicious
  increases of rent, and <i>if</i> the thing grew well established by her
  exertions, and was certain to continue a paying concern, why, here would be a
  new branch of Mr. Dunkin's business ready made.</p>

  <p>It needed but a week's notice, given unexpectedly, at a properly chosen
  time, when no neighbouring shop was to let, and a good stroke of business was
  happily completed. Mrs. May would vanish, a man would go in to manage at a
  pound or twenty-five shillings a week and his quarters, there would be no
  interruption to trade (for the outgoing tenant would naturally keep at work
  till the last minute, to get what little she could), and Mr. Dunkin would
  have a new branch, paying very excellently, with no trouble to himself. Mr.
  Dunkin had established other branches in the same way, and found it a very
  simple and cheap arrangement. There was no risk of his own capital, no
  trouble in "working-up" the trade, no cost of goodwill, and rent was coming
  regularly while the tenant laboured with the zeal of a man who imagines he is
  working for his own benefit and his children's. The important thing was to
  give nothing but a weekly tenancy; else the tenant might find time to get
  going somewhere near at hand, and so perhaps deprive Mr. Dunkin of the just
  reward of his sagacity, foresight, and patience. But there was little
  difficulty in that matter. Beginners were timid and glad of a weekly tenancy,
  fearing the responsibility of anything longer, at first; and
  afterwards&mdash;well, things were in a groove, and Mr. Dunkin was so very
  kind and sympathetic that it wasn't worth while to bother about a change. And
  by this method Mr. Dunkin, judiciously selecting his purchases in shop
  property, had acquired two or three of his half-dozen branches, and
  flourished exceedingly; which all kindly souls rejoiced to see.</p>

  <p>In the beginning he had no thought of this plan for the Harbour Lane shop,
  being mainly concerned to get a tenant, no matter in what trade; and indeed
  in his eye the place was as little suited for chandlery as for anything. Even
  now he must wait, for he doubted the lasting quality of the new prosperity;
  better a few years of forbearance than a too hurried seizure of a weakening
  concern, to find little more than the same tenantless shop on his hands after
  all. And if it seemed that the trade owed anything to the personal qualities
  and connexions of Mrs. May, well, it would be a simple thing to keep her on
  to manage, instead of a man. It would be an act of benevolence, moreover, to
  an unfortunate widow, and come cheaper. But that was a matter for the
  future.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Nan May, active and confident, filled her shop by purchase from
  whatsoever factor sold best and cheapest, and travellers called for her
  orders. The hungry husband who first came for cooked bacon she always treated
  with particular consideration, finding him good cuts. He ceased his regular
  visits in three weeks or less, and Nan May, taught by experience in her
  earlier London life, well guessed the cause of his coming. In the spring,
  three months or so later, great crowds thronged about the ship-yard to see
  the launch of the battleship that overtime had so long been woked on; and
  when the launch was over, this man and his wife, the man carrying the baby,
  came into the shop for something to celebrate the occasion at tea. The
  parents did not altogether comprehend Nan May's enthusiasm over the baby,
  which she took from its father's arms and danced merrily about the shop,
  while customers waited. But they set it down to admiration of its personal
  beauty, though truly it was an ordinary slobbery baby enough. But it went
  away down the street in great state, triumphantly stabbing at its mouth with
  the sugarstick gripped by one hand, and at its father's whiskers with that
  brandished in the other.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">ON a Saturday afternoon about this time, Uncle Isaac, in his
  best black suit and very tall hat, and with the Turk's-head walking-stick in
  his hand, started out to see a foreman. Work was rather slack just now
  (shipwrights' work was slack everywhere), and the three holidays a week that
  once were the glory and boast of a free and independent shipwright, were now
  apt to be a woeful compulsion. Uncle Isaac had been of late poorer (because
  idler) than he liked, and in such case it was his way to seek the chance of
  meeting his foreman out of hours, in order to a display of rhetoric, oblique
  flattery, and dexterous suggestion, that might influence a distribution of
  short time that would be more favourable to the orator.</p>

  <p>He had wondered much as to the fortunes of Nan and her children, but as it
  has been said, his tenderness of heart kept him as far as possible from what
  he believed must now be a scene of sheer failure and destitution: if, indeed,
  the shop were not abandoned; and he was by no means anxious that his poor
  relations should discover his new lodgings. So now he picked his way with
  circumspection, and with careful cogitation of a mental map of the streets;
  bestraightforwardess straightforward journey would take him much too near to
  Harbour Lane.</p>

  <p>He crossed a swing bridge that gave access to a hundred and fifty yards of
  roadway ending in another swing bridge. But there was a crook in the road,
  and when he passed it he found that the second bridge was open. Now in
  Blackwall an "open" bridge did not mean one that the passenger could cross;
  that was a "shut" bridge. The "open" bridge was one swung aside to let a ship
  through, as a pair of gates is opened for a carriage. So Uncle Isaac resigned
  himself to wait, with an increasingly impatient group, till the bridge should
  swing into place again and give passage. He stood behind the chain that hung
  across the road to check traffic, and meditatively rubbed his nose with the
  Turk's-head. Presently he grew conscious of a rusty figure on his left,
  edging unsteadily a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"'Ow do, Mr. Mundy?" came a hoarse whisper. And Mother Born-drunk, a
  trifle less drunk than usual, but careful to grasp a post, leered a grimy
  leer and waved her disengaged hand in his face, as one saluting a friend at a
  great distance. Uncle Isaac emitted a non-committal grunt&mdash;one that
  might be taken for an accidental cough by the bystanders&mdash;and sidled a
  foot or two away. For he, too, had known Emma Pacey in her more decent days,
  and, with other acquaintances of that time, was sometimes put to shifts to
  avoid her.</p>

  <p>Mother Born-drunk left the post and followed her victim. "Don' run 'way,"
  she ejaculated, unsteadily. "I'm ole pal. Mish' Mundy!" She thrust out a foul
  paw, and dropped her voice coaxingly. "Len'sh twopence!" Uncle Isaac gazed
  uneasily in another direction, and took more ground to the right. The waiting
  passengers, glad of a little amusement, grinned one at another.</p>

  <p>"'J'ear, Mr. Mundy!" This in a loud voice, with an imperious gesture.
  "'J'ear! Can'tche' answer when a lady speaks t'ye?"</p>

  <p>"Go on, guv'nor!" said a boy encouragingly, sitting on a post. "Where's
  yer manners? Take auf yer 'at to the laidy!" And there was a snigger. Uncle
  Isaac shifted farther still, and put a group of men between himself and his
  persecutor. But she was not to be so easily shaken off. Drawing herself up
  with a scornful majesty that was marred by an occasional lurch, and the
  bobbing of the tangled bonnet hanging over one ear, she came after Uncle
  Isaac through the passage readily made by the knot of men.</p>

  <p>"Ho! so it's this, is it," she declaimed, with a stately backward sweep of
  the arm. "If a lady asks a triflin' favour you insult 'er. Ye low, common,
  scoundrel!" This very slowly, with a deep tragedy hiss and a long pause. Then
  with a piercing note of appeal: "Mr. Mundy! I demand an answer! Once more!
  <i>Will</i> you lend me twopence?"</p>

  <p>The people (a small crowd by this time) forgot the troublesome bridge, and
  turned to the new diversion. "Give the laidy twopence!" roared the boy on the
  post, in a deep bass. "'Arf a pint 'ud save 'er life!"</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac looked desperately about him, but he saw no sympathy. Dockmen,
  workmen, boys&mdash;all were agog to see as much fun as possible in the time
  at disposal. The pursuing harpy came a step nearer, and bawled again,
  <i>"Will</i> you lend me twopence?"</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Uncle Isaac, driven to bay at last. "No, I won't! Go away! Go
  away, you&mdash;infamious creacher!"</p>

  <p>"You won't?"</p>

  <p>"No, not by no means. Go away. Y'ought to be ashamed of yerself,
  you&mdash;you&mdash;you opstroperous faggit!"</p>

  <p>"Calls 'isself a gen'leman," she said, lifting her gaze to the clouds.
  "Calls 'isself a gen'leman, an' uses such language to a lady!"</p>

  <p>"Shockin'," said one in the hilarious crowd. "What a wicked ole
  bloke!"</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac gave another unquiet glance about him, and moved another yard.
  The woman brought her eyes to earth again, and: "Won't gimme twopence," she
  proclaimed, "an' I'm a orficer's widow! Never mind, len' me a penny; on'y a
  penny, Mr. Mundy. Do, there'sh a dear! O you <i>are</i> a ole duck!" And
  Mother Born-drunk stumbled toward Uncle Isaac with affectionately extended
  arms.</p>

  <p>The crowd shrieked with joy, but Uncle Isaac turned and ran, one hand
  clapped to the crown of his very tall hat. He would wait for no bridge now,
  but get away as best he could. The boys yelled and whistled, and kept up at
  an easy trot with the quick scuttle of his short legs; behind them came
  Mother Born-drunk, tripping and floundering, spurred to infuriate chase by
  sight and sound of her unchanging enemies, the boys, and growing at every
  step more desirous of clawing at one of them than of catching Uncle
  Isaac.</p>

  <p>As for him, he dropped his hat once, and nearly fell on it, in looking
  behind. So he thrust it under his arm as he scurried past the bend in the
  road; and there despair seized him, for now the other bridge was open too.
  Which escape might he make first? At the end from which he had turned back, a
  great liner was being towed through at a snail's pace, funnels and masts
  scarce seeming to move across the street. But at this end a small coaster
  went out briskly, and her mizzen was more than half over now. The woman was
  less than twenty yards off, but though she still staggered nearer, she was
  engaged with boys. Uncle Isaac put panic aside, and resolved on dignity. He
  took his hat from under his arm, and began to brush it on his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Mother Born-drunk was in the hands of her enemies, though there were fewer
  than usual. She swore and swiped at them, and they flung and yelled and
  danced. But they drew nearer Uncle Isaac, for it was a new variation in the
  sport to involve an old gentleman with his Sunday clothes on. Then shouted
  the woman breathlessly: "P'lice! p'lice! Mish' Mundy, I'll give y' in charge
  for annoyin' me. 'J'ear!" She came very near and made a catch at him, which
  he dodged without regard to dignity. "Mish' Mundy! Stand a drop&mdash;just a
  little drop for ole times! If ye don't stand a drop I'll give y' in
  charge!"</p>

  <p>The coaster was through, and soon the bridge would shut. Uncle Isaac moved
  up toward the chain amid shouts and jibes. "Y'ought to be ashamed o'
  yerself," bawled the woman, "a ole man like you, annoyin' a lady!"</p>

  <p>But the men were at the winch, and the bridge swung. First of all the
  impatient passengers, Uncle Isaac sprang on the moving iron and got across at
  peril of life and limb ere the sections were still. He heard a louder shout
  of laughter from behind, where Mother Born-drunk, forgetting the chain as she
  made for the bridge, had sprawled over it where it hung low in the middle;
  and he quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that Johnny May had been taken that week to his first
  out-door job, on a large steamer; and, full of the wonders of the ship, he
  had made interest with the "shippy" (who was officially called the
  shipkeeper) to bring Bessy on board on Saturday afternoon. The visit was a
  pure delight for both, with more than a spice of danger for Bessy in climbing
  gangways, companions, and greasy engine-room steps; indeed, the "shippy"
  carried her down the lower flights of these last. Johnny explained the
  prodigious engines with all the extreme technicality of a new hand, and with
  much pride pointed out the part whereon he (with the help of three or four
  journeymen) had been at work. Bessy stared and marvelled, and her admiration
  for her brother waxed into reverence. For was he not an engineer, master of
  these massy, shining immensities, so amazingly greater than any engines she
  had dreamed of, so awful in their monstrous stillness? Bessy peeped along the
  tunnel of the great shaft, and then, a minute after, up into the towering
  complexities above, and she was almost afraid&mdash;would have been afraid to
  stay there alone.</p>

  <p>They walked home gay and talkative, and Bessy's face had a light and a
  colour that it had lacked since Johnny and gran'dad had seen it together. For
  she had seen great things, and had walked in passenger saloons more wonderful
  than all her palaces of romance. It struck Johnny, for the first time in his
  life, that Bessy was rather pretty; and as to her lameness though some would
  call it a blemish (as it certainly was a misfortune), yet she carried it
  trimly, and he almost thought it suited her.</p>

  <p>And so they went till at a corner a hurried little man with a moon-face
  ran into them, hat first,&mdash;for he was brushing it again.</p>

  <p>Now both Johnny and Bessy wore their best clothes, and both looked happy
  and well, so at a glance Uncle Isaac guessed that things had gone aright at
  Harbour Lane after all. Just as distress troubled and repelled him, so good
  fortune pleased his amiable genius and attracted his regards. So though he
  was still a little flushed and uneasy, he was glad of the encounter. He had
  been unwell, it seemed, and&mdash;and busy, and all that. But how was trade
  at the shop?</p>

  <p>Johnny and Bessy told the tale of the new ship-yard gate, and of the cold
  bacon and the pickles and the new prosperity. Uncle Isaac was greatly
  pleased. He was sorry, very sorry, he said, that he had not been able to call
  lately, but he would delay no longer&mdash;he would be round that very
  evening. And, indeed, he came, and immensely approved of the bacon. And he
  came again, and approved immensely of the cheese and the pickles and whatever
  else there was for supper, and again after that, and usually carried
  something home for trial in the calmer mood of the morning. And thus family
  ties were made whole, and avuncular love continued.</p>

  <p>"Jest to think," Uncle Isaac would say with a wave of his fork, "what a
  quantity o' blessin's you owe to my advice, Nan! What was my words o' counsel
  to you prefarrotory? `Enterprise,' sez I. 'Enterprise is what you want,' I
  sez; there's alwis money in Enterprise! An' what's the result? Enterprise,
  representin' biled 'ock o' bacon, is done the trick wonderful. But, in
  regards to enterprise, why not call it 'am?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH the spring the steady application of paint in Harbour
  Lane burst into a fury. Everywhere the houses and the flagstaffs and the
  fences took new coats of many colours, changing as the season went, and the
  paint-pot traffic fell into a vaster confusion. As tops were "in" among the
  boys, the smell of paint grew day by day, and when the marble season began
  little else could be smelt. With July came Fairlop Friday, and Bessy wondered
  at the passing of a great model of a rigged ship on wheels, drawn by horses,
  and filled with jubilant shipwrights on their way to Epping Forest, in accord
  with yearly custom. She had grown to consider the forest as a place so far
  off (though indeed she knew the distance in mere miles) that it came almost
  as a surprise to see people starting out to drive there in a few hours with
  so slow a vehicle, and to return the same night.</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece had written once or twice (he kept an eye on the empty
  cottage, and looked out for a tenant), but he had never made a visit, as Nan
  May had asked him. The last news was that his bedridden old mother was worse,
  and not expected to live.</p>

  <p>The trade went well&mdash;better than ever, indeed, and scarce a month
  passed but Nan May put a sovereign or two in the post-office savings bank;
  and Uncle Isaac began secretly to look upon the shop in Harbour Lane as a
  convenient retreat for his later years. Already he took as many meals there
  as possible, for, as he said, he could get no proper attention in his new
  lodgings. Of his old friend Mr. Butson he had seen nothing for months. For
  Butson, he knew, had lost his berth on the steamboat, and had fallen on evil
  times&mdash;and Uncle Isaac never intruded on private griefs of this
  description.</p>

  <p>But late in the year, when the anniversary of Johnny's apprenticeship was
  nearing, and when Johnny himself was near a head taller&mdash;for he grew
  quickly now&mdash;Uncle Isaac saw Butson from afar as he crossed the docks,
  and Butson saw him. There was no escape, but Uncle Isaac, with a grin and a
  wave of the hand, tried to pass on hurriedly, as though urgent business
  claimed his time. But Mr. Butson rose from his bollard&mdash;bollards had
  been his most familiar furniture for months now&mdash;and intercepted
  him.</p>

  <p>"You've 'ad about a year now to git that 'urry over," he said, with
  something not unlike a sneer. "If you're goin' that way, I'll come along too.
  Got any 'bacca?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac, with a bounteous air that scarce covered his reluctance,
  pulled out a screw of paper, and Mr.</p>

  <p>Butson filled his pipe. For some little way he smoked in silence, for
  tobacco was an uncommon luxury with him just now, and he enjoyed a succession
  of puffs with no interruption. Then he said, "Workin' at Turton's now?"</p>

  <p>"No," Uncle Isaac replied, with a slight cough. "I&mdash;no, I ain't
  workin' there."</p>

  <p>"Thought not. Looked out for y' often. An' you moved too." Butson smoked
  again for a space, and then went on. "I've 'ad a pretty awful year," he said.
  "Why I was very near goin' stokin' once or twice." (He had not quite gone,
  because the chief engineer always sent him ashore.) "Nice thing, that, for a
  man o' my bringin'-up."</p>

  <p>They walked on. Truly the bad year had left its marks on Mr. Butson. The
  soles were three-quarters gone from his boots, and the uppers were cracked.
  He wore a mixture of ordinary and working clothes, frayed and greasy and
  torn, and he shivered under a flimsy dungaree jacket, buttoned so close to
  the neck as to hint an absence of shirt. His bowler hat was weather-beaten
  and cracked, and the brim behind was beginning to leave the crown because of
  rain-rot.</p>

  <p>Presently Uncle Isaac, impelled to say something, asked, "Bin out all the
  time?"</p>

  <p>"Very near. Got a job on a 'draulic, but the chap began jawin' me about
  somethin'. I wasn't goin' to stand that, so I just walked out."</p>

  <p>"Nothin' else?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. One or two things I got on to, but they didn't last. Know the
  laundry over the Cut? Well they took me on there to run the engine, an'
  sacked me in a week. Said I was asleep! Measly swine. Much the same at other
  places. Seemed to want to treat me like&mdash;like any common feller. But I
  showed 'em different to that!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" commented Uncle Isaac absently. He was wondering which way to lead
  the walk, and how to take leave of his companion. But his invention was at a
  stand, and presently the other went on.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you ain't got so much to say as you used. Know any job
  you can put me on to?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," replied Uncle Isaac with gloomy simplicity. "Trade's
  bad&mdash;very bad. I bin workin' short time meself, an' standin' auf day
  after day. Stood auf to-day."</p>

  <p>"Well then, lend us a bob."</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac started, and made the space between them a foot wider. "Reely,
  Mr. Butson, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, make it two bob then, if you'd rather. You've 'ad more 'n that
  out o' me one time an' another."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I tell you I'm unfort'net meself. I bin standin' auf day
  after day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Seems to me you're tryin' to stand auf as much as ye can now. Look 'ere."
  Mr. Butson stood and faced Uncle Isaac. "I'm broke, clean broke, an' worse.
  I'm 'ungry."</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's very bad," said Uncle Isaac. "But why not go t' yer rich
  relations?"</p>

  <p>Butson frowned. "Never mind them," he said. "I'd rather try an' tap your
  small property. What am I to do? I'm at the end of me tether, an' I've tried
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;Enterprise is what you want," Uncle Isaac said, being at a loss
  what else to recommend. "Enterprise. I've recommended Enterprise before, with
  wonderful results&mdash;wonderful. An'&mdash;an' 'ow about marryin'? There's
  the lan'lady at the Mariner's Arms. She was alwis very friendly, an'
  <i>that's</i> a life as ought to suit ye."</p>

  <p>"G-r-r-r!" Mr. Butson turned his head with a growl and took to walking
  again, Uncle Isaac by his side. "She'd want to make a potman of me,
  an'&mdash;an'&mdash;well that ain't much catch, any'ow. If you won't lend me
  a bob, stand me a feed o' some sort. Ain't 'ad yer tea, 'ave ye?"</p>

  <p>Plainly something must be sacrificed to Butson, and it struck Uncle Isaac
  that the cheapest article would be some of Nan May's bacon. So he said,
  "Well, I <i>was</i> thinkin' o' poppin' round to my niece's to tea. I'm sure
  she'd make ye very welcome."</p>

  <p>"Awright. Same niece as give us tea over in the Forest that time?"</p>

  <p>"Yus. She's round in 'arbour Lane."</p>

  <p>The lamplighter scuffled past into the thickening dusk, leaving his sparse
  trail of light-spots along the dock wall. The two men came through streets
  where little sitting-rooms, lighted as yet by fires alone, cheered Butson
  with promise of the meal to come; and when at last he stood in Nan May's
  shop, now no place of empty boxes, but ranged close with bacon, cheese,
  candles, sausages, brawn, spiced beef, many eggs and a multitude of sundries,
  there was some shadow of the old strut and sulky swagger, hanging oddly about
  the broken-up Butson of these later days.</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac did it with an air, for an air was an inexpensive
  embellishment that won him consideration. "Good-evenin', Nan. I've took the
  liberty (which I'm sure you'll call it a pleasure) to introduce a of friend
  to tea which we well remember with 'appier circumstances. Mr. Butson is come
  to see you."</p>

  <p>Duller eyes than Nan May's would have seen Butson's fallen condition at a
  glance, and it afflicted her to know that while fortune had favoured her it
  had stricken him so sorely. She led them in, offering Butson a cordiality in
  some sort exaggerated by her anxiety not to seem to see his poor clothes, nor
  to treat him a whit the worse for his ill-luck. As for Mr. Butson, he found a
  fire and a clean hearth, with an armchair beside it, in a better room than he
  had seen for long. Old Mr. May's photograph hung over the mantelpiece, and
  below it was the sole remaining butterfly trophy, a small glass case, set
  when the old man was young. The ragged books that were Bessy's solace stood
  on a sideboard top, and Bessy herself, disturbed in reading, was putting one
  of them carefully in its place. The kettle sang on the hob. And when Johnny
  came from work he was astonished to find a tea-party of great animation.</p>

  <p>Johnny was a big lad now (though he was scarce sixteen years of age), and
  Mr. Butson condescended to shake hands with him, to condole with him on the
  choice of the wretched trade that had so ill supported himself, and to
  exchange a remark or two on the engineering topics of the week.</p>

  <p>But chiefly Mr. Butson attended to the meal. Nan May had never seen two
  men together eat such a meal as his. Plainly he was famished. She was full of
  pity for this unfortunate, so well brought up (thought the simple soul), so
  cruelly neglected by his well-to-do relations. She cut more slices of bacon,
  and more, and still more of bread and butter, quietly placing them to his
  hand, till at last he was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson was refreshed, filled his pipe again from Uncle Isaac's paper,
  and gave some attention to the conversation. But the conversation took to
  itself the property of rarely travelling far from Mr. Butson and his
  troubles. He had no false modesty about them. He had parted with almost all
  his clothes, and hadn't a shirt to his back. His tools were in pawn, and a
  man felt discouraged from looking for a job when his tools were "put away,"
  and he had no money to redeem them. But he would starve sooner than apply to
  his unnatural relations; he would take the help of strangers first.</p>

  <p>When at last Mr. Butson took leave, and went shivering into the gusty
  night, Uncle Isaac was careful to let him go alone, and to remain, himself,
  in the shop parlour till his friend was clear away. But Nan May ran down the
  street after her departed guest. There were a few hurried words of entreaty
  in the woman's voice: "Here, Mr. Butson. Do! you really must!"&mdash;and she
  scurried back breathless and a trifle shamefaced. She reached across the
  counter and shut the till ere she came into the shop parlour.</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac Iooked up sharply in her face as she entered, but went on with
  his pipe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THIS visit was but the first of many from Mr. But-son: until
  after a very few months he came as regularly as Uncle Isaac himself. He
  recovered his old appearance a little at a time, one new article of clothing
  coming after another; but he seemed to have no luck in his quest for a
  job&mdash;or very little. What small success he found was ever brought to
  naught by the captiousness&mdash;even the rudeness&mdash;of those in
  direction, or their unreasonable exactions in the way of work. To simple Nan
  May he seemed the most shamefully ill-used of exemplars.</p>

  <p>Johnny and Bessy were Iess enthusiastic. Bessy said nothing, but avoided
  Mr. Butson as much as possible, sitting in the shop when he was in the back
  parlour. Johnny went for walks in the evening, and grumbled, wondering why
  his mother encouraged this stranger&mdash;"cadging suppers," as he uncivilly
  put it. Nan May was hurt at the expression, and feared that the workshop was
  spoiling Johnny's manners.</p>

  <p>News came from Bob Smallpiece that his poor old mother was dead at last,
  and buried in the high churchyard where Johnny's grandfather Iay. Also that
  Bob would come to London now, for a visit, at the first opportunity. Now it
  was a fact that Bob Smallpiece, for a year or two, had been inclined to
  marry; though it was a thing he might never have thought of if he had seen
  less of Mrs. May. But he was a man of practical temperament, making up in his
  commonsense for a great lack of agility of mind. There were certain
  obstacles, he saw&mdash;obstacles that must remove of themselves or not at
  all. First, his old mother. It would not seem fair to bring a wife to nurse a
  bedridden old woman&mdash;at anyrate it was scarce an attraction. More, the
  old woman herself had a dread of it. She feared the chance of being thought a
  burden by a newcomer, and would often beg Bob not to marry till she were
  gone; sometimes with the assurance that she would not be long now.
  Then&mdash;to say nothing of old Mr. May&mdash;there had been the children,
  who, familiar as he was with them, afflicted him, in this particular matter
  alone, with an odd shyness. Again, when the old man died, the May family must
  needs come to London, if only that Johnny might go to his trade; while Bob
  Smallpiece must stay at the forest. But he was ever patient and
  philosophical.</p>

  <p>Now that some difficulties were gone, another arose. Nan May, all unaware
  of his slow designs, was settled in London, with ties of business. But
  perhaps, after all, the business was not flourishing&mdash;might be a burden
  better laid down. And as to Johnny&mdash;he was earning wages of some sort
  now, and at most his apprenticeship would be out when he was twenty-one.</p>

  <p>Bob Smallpiece had reserved one piece of news till he could deliver it in
  person. This was that at last he had let the cottage, at three-and-sixpence a
  week, to a decent woodman and his wife. And so, wearing a new neckcloth, and
  with three weeks' rent in his pocket, Bob Smallpiece appeared in Harbour Lane
  one spring morning, a vast astonishment of leather and velveteen, such as had
  never before brought a Blackwall housewife to attention in the midst of her
  dusting and sweeping. No name was painted over the shop, but no stranger
  could pass its red and blue and green without stopping to look; least of all
  Bob Smallpiece, in quest of the place itself. Nan May saw him, and ran to the
  door; and Bessy, with her crutch and her book, met him half-way to the
  back-parlour, gay and laughing.</p>

  <p>Bob regarded the well-filled shop, the neat room, with some mixture of
  feelings. Prosperity was excellent in its own way, but it made the new
  obstacle more formidable. Further, Mrs. May, though she was pleased to hear
  that the cottage was let, and grateful enough for his trouble in letting it,
  was not so overjoyed as she might have been if the weekly three-and-sixpence
  had come at a time of pinching; more, she handled the half-sovereign almost
  as disrespectfully as the sixpence, and dropped it into a part of her purse
  where it fell among other gold. Poor Bob saw the obstacle not only bigger,
  but double. Not merely was Nan May tied to London by her trade and by
  Johnny's apprenticeship, but she was a well-to-do tradeswoman, with whom a
  poor forest-keeper could expect no more than respectful acquaintance. He half
  feared she might even offer to pay him for his trouble with the cottage, and
  grew red and hot with the apprehension. But this affliction was spared him
  though Nan did venture to ask if his care of her property had involved
  out-of-pocket expenses; a suggestion which Bob repudiated desperately.</p>

  <p>Neither Bessy nor her mother could understand why their visitor's manner
  was so constrained and awkward, nor why he announced that he "must be going"
  after sitting for twenty minutes. But that, of course, was not to be allowed.
  Johnny would be home in half an hour, and there would be some dinner. So Bob
  Smallpiece, who wanted to get away somewhere by himself and think things
  over, remained, and made his part of the conversation as well as he
  could.</p>

  <p>Johnny came, smudgy and hungry, surprised to find that his old friend, big
  man as he was, seemed to be scarcely so big as when he saw him last, eighteen
  months ago. For Johnny himself was grown surprisingly, and seemed like to
  stand as high as Bob Smallpiece's shoulder by his seventeenth birthday. Bob
  found more to talk of now that Johnny had come, and he ate even better than
  Johnny himself, for nothing spoiled the keeper's appetite. When could they
  all come to the forest again for a day? Nan May shook her head. She had no
  days free but Sundays&mdash;she might come some day, perhaps; some Sunday in
  the vague future. But Johnny might get a day off at a slack time, and he and
  Bessy would come. Bessy brimmed over with delight at the prospect. Every day,
  since she had left it, the forest had seemed a more wonderful and a more
  distant dream; every day some forgotten circumstance, some moment of delight,
  some long-dead bunch of wildflowers, trifles all, and daily commonplaces
  once, had come back to lend one more touch to the fairy picture her memory
  made ever more radiant as the simple facts fell farther into the past. And
  Johnny, little burdened with pictures of fancy (for he put his imagination
  away from him now, as a childishness unworthy an engineer), nevertheless
  thought that as soon as a certain large job was completed at Maidment and
  Hurst's the gaffer would doubtless let him lose a day. So it was settled. And
  when Johnny hurried off to his work, Bob Smallpiece took the opportunity to
  leave too; for he must go and see his sister, he said.</p>

  <p>He went, and saw his sister, and took tea with her; and his sister found
  him even duller than Nan May had done. For in truth Bob Smallpiece was in a
  mire of doubt and hesitation. In a frame of mind so foreign to his simple
  habit he grew fretful, and left things to chance and impulse. With no
  definite design in the world, he wandered back to Harbour Lane after tea, and
  there met, for the first time, Uncle Isaac and Mr. Butson. This company
  proved uncongenial; and indeed the distinguished Butson was indisposed to be
  cordial with an Essex bumpkin in a velveteen uniform. So, though Nan May was
  all kindness, Bob Smallpiece soon took himself off to the train, where his
  savage moodiness might not be seen. The whole thing was past hope now; though
  he might have found it hard to tell precisely what had occurred since midday
  to worsen the look of affairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">NOT for six weeks, at least, Johnny judged, could he beg the
  day's holiday that was to take him and Bessy back to the forest; and it might
  be more. That would be in July&mdash;or even August&mdash;and probably the
  weather would be more trustworthy then. As for Bessy, she counted the days on
  the almanack, and tapped the yellow-faced old barometer that had been
  gran'dad's, a dozen times a day. Johnny laughed at her impatience, and
  invented endless weather prophecies "just from America" putting the weather
  for the whole of July at every possible shade of unpleasantness, from
  blizzards to floods and thunderstorms.</p>

  <p>The days went quietly&mdash;they were even dull. Mr. Butson did what he
  could to make himself agreeable, and several times praised a set of callipers
  that Johnny had made&mdash;a set of calipers that Johnny, in fact, thought
  very well of himself. So that he seemed not such a bad fellow, perhaps, after
  all, though a bit of a sponge.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to cause it, to all seeming, but it was a fact that just
  now Nan May grew thoughtful and absent of manner. She would pause in the
  midst of needlework, as though to think; and more than once at such a time,
  Bessy, looking up from her own work, saw that her mother's troubled gaze was
  fixed on herself. Nan May put away the anxious look as well as she might, and
  bent to her work again; but Bessy wondered.</p>

  <p>Johnny, too, fancied that his mother was scarce so cheerful as was her
  wont, though he thought of it less than Bessy. But one Sunday afternoon,
  meeting her by her bedroom door, he took her cheeks between his palms, and
  looked hard in her face. "Mother," he said, "I believe you've been crying!
  What's up?"</p>

  <p>She put a hand on each of his wrists, and made a shift to smile. "That's
  nonsense," she said, and tried to pull his hands down. "You're gettin' too
  strong for your poor old mother to keep you in order!"</p>

  <p>But she brightened, always, when Mr. Butson came in the evening; though
  Mr. Butson's conversation scarce seemed of so inspiriting a character as to
  account wholly for the change. Still, it interested her. It was mostly about
  his grievances at the hands of the world; and Nan May was a ready
  sympathiser.</p>

  <p>It was very near to the day (at last fixed) for the excursion, when Bessy
  woke in the night at the striking of a match. Her mother was lighting a
  candle, her back toward the bed. She took the candle and passed out, into
  Johnny's room at the back. Bessy listened, but she heard no talk; heard
  nothing, indeed, but Johnny's heavy breathing, so still was the night.
  Presently her mother returned, and stood over her, still with the candle;
  gazing on her face, it seemed to Bessy&mdash;as well as she could see through
  her half-closed eyes&mdash;much as she had gazed when she paused in her
  needlework, though now her cheeks were wet with tears. With that Bessy opened
  wide her eyes, and "Mother!" she said. "What's the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

  <p>Nan May turned and blew out the light. "No, Bess, no; I'm all right," she
  said, and crept into bed. "It's not&mdash;not much. I woke up, that's
  all&mdash;with a bad dream." She kissed the girl, and put her arm about her
  neck. "You've always been a good girl, Bessy," she went on. "You wouldn't
  turn against me, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Why no, mother! But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not whatever happened?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;of course not," she kissed her mother again. "But why?"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing. Only the dream just the dream, Bess. Go to sleep."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE longed-for holiday came with a fine Monday morning, and
  Bessy, in a muslin frock that her mother had helped to make for the occasion,
  was impatient, an hour too soon, because Johnny lingered in bed; enjoying the
  luxury of "losing a quarter" without paying the penalty.</p>

  <p>But Johnny was ready for breakfast before eight, and, seeing the shop-door
  open, ran to take down the shutters, a thing his mother commonly did herself,
  because of his absence at work. "I always put 'em up, and for once I'll take
  'em down," he said, prancing in with the first. "Look out, mother, or I'll
  bowl you over!"</p>

  <p>"O no, Johnny," she said, "leave 'em. I'll only have to&mdash;" and at
  that she stopped.</p>

  <p>"Only have to what?" Johnny asked, going for another. "Only have to serve
  the customers, eh, 'cause the shop's open? Of course you will&mdash;it ain't
  <i>your</i> holiday, you know&mdash;it's ours! Look out again! Shoo!"</p>

  <p>Bessy rattled at the old barometer still, though for half an hour it had
  refused to move its hand a shade; and she asked Johnny for the fiftieth time
  if he were perfectly sure that the proper train wasn't earlier than they were
  supposing. And when at last Johnny admitted that it was time to start, Nan
  May kissed them and bade them good-bye with so wistful an earnestness that
  Johnny was moved to pleasantry. "All right, mother," he said, "we're coming
  back some day you know!"</p>

  <p>They were scarce half-way to the railway-station when Bessy said: "Johnny,
  I don't think mother's been very well lately. There'll be another train soon;
  shall we go back an'&mdash;an' just see if she's all right, first?"</p>

  <p>Johnny laughed. "That's a good idea!" he said. "An' then I s'pose we'd
  better miss the next, an' go back to see how she's getting on <i>then,
  an'</i> the one after that, eh? Mother's all right. She's been thinking a bit
  about&mdash;you know, gran'dad an' all that; and because we're goin' to the
  forest it reminds her of it. Come on&mdash;don't begin the day with
  dumps!"<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>There was interest for both of them in the railway journey. They changed
  trains at Stepney, and after a station or two more came in distant sight of a
  part of the road they had traversed, on Bank's cart, when they came to
  London, two winters back. There was the great, low, desolate wilderness,
  treeless and void of any green thing, seen now from nearer the midst, with
  the road bounding it in the distance; and here was the chemical
  manure-factory, close at hand this time, with its stink at short-hitting
  range, so that every window in the train went up with a bang, and everybody
  in the long third-class carriage coughed, or grimaced, or spat, or swore,
  according to sex and habit.</p>

  <p>Then, out beyond Stratford, through Leyton and Leytonstone, they saw that
  the town had grown much in twenty months, and was still growing. Close,
  regular streets of little houses, all of one pattern, stared in raw brick, or
  rose, with a forlorn air of crumbling sponginess, amid sparse sticks of
  scaffolding. Bessy wondered how the butterflies were faring in the forest,
  and how much farther they had been driven since she left it. Then the wide
  country began to spin past, and pleasant single houses, and patches of wood.
  The hills about Chigwell stood bright and green across the Roding valley, as
  the low ground ran away between, and the high forest land came up at the
  other side of the line. Till the train stood in Loughton Station.</p>

  <p>Through the village Bessy, flushed and eager, stumped and swung at a pace
  that kept Johnny walking his best. Staple Hill was the nearest corner of the
  forest, and for Staple Hill they made direct. Once past the street-end it
  rose before them, round and gay, deep and green in the wood that clothed it.
  Boys were fishing in the pond at its foot, and the stream ran merrily under
  the dusty road.</p>

  <p>"Come, Johnny!" Bessy cried. "Straight over the hill!" Nor did she check
  her pace till the wide boughs shaded them, and her crutch went softly on the
  mossy earth among old leaves. Then she stood and laughed aloud, and was near
  crying. "Smell it, Johnny!" she cried, "smell it! Isn't it heavenly?"</p>

  <p>They went up the slope, across tiny glades, and between thick clumps of
  undergrowth gay with dog-roses, Bessy's eyes and ears alert for everything,
  tree, bird, or flower; now spying out some noisy jay that upbraided their
  intrusion, now standing to hark for a distant woodpecker. Johnny enjoyed the
  walk too, but with a soberer delight; as became an engineer taking a day's
  relaxation amid the scenes of childish play now half forgotten.</p>

  <p>Down the other side of the hill they went, and over the winding stream at
  the bottom. Truly it seemed a tiny stream now, and Johnny wondered that he
  should ever have been proud of jumping it. He found a bend where the water
  rushed through a narrow channel by the side of a bed of clean-washed gravel,
  and got Bess across, though she scrambled down and up with little help, such
  was her enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Then the trees grew sparser, and over the deep-grown flat of Debden Slade
  Bessy stopped again and again to recognise some well-remembered wild-flower;
  and little brown butterflies skimmed over the rushes and tall grass, the sun
  mounted higher, and everything was brisk and bright and sweet-smelling.
  Brother and sister climbed the hill before them slowly, often staying to look
  back over the great prospect of rolling woodland, ever widening as they rose.
  Till at last they stood at the point of the ridge, in the gap through the
  earthwork made by ancient Britons.</p>

  <p>This beyond all others was the spot that Bessy had loved best. This ragged
  ring of crumbling rampart and ditch, grown thick with fantastic hornbeams,
  pollarded out of all common shape; its inner space a crowded wonder of tall
  bracken, with rare patches of heather; its outer angles watching over the
  silent woods below, and dominating the hills that ranked beyond; this was the
  place where best an old book from the shelf would fill a sunny afternoon. For
  the camp was a romance in itself, a romance of closer presence than anything
  printed on paper. Here, two thousand years ago, the long-haired savages had
  stood, in real fact, with spears and axes, brandishing defiance to foes on
  the hillside. Here they had entrenched themselves against the Roman
  legions&mdash;they and their chief, fierce Cassivellaunus: more, to her, than
  a name in an old history-book. For had not she seen the wild prince a hundred
  times in her day-dreams, stalking under the oaks&mdash;with the sheeted
  Druids? Till the wood grew alive with phantoms, and she hid her face in her
  book.</p>

  <p>And now she sat here again, in the green shade, and looked out over the
  thousand tree-tops, merry with the sunlight. How long had she left it all?
  What was that fancy of a ride to London, of ship-yards, and of a
  chandler's-shop? But Johnny whistled to a robin on a twig, and she turned and
  looked at him, to see that here was the engineer, indeed, and the painter of
  the chandler's-shop. Still, which was the dream, that or this?</p>

  <p>Left alone, Bessy would have sat here all the day. But there were other
  places not to be forgotten, as Johnny reminded her. Over the heather they
  went, then, to Monk Wood, where the trees were greater and the flowers were
  more abundant than anywhere else in the forest; and they did not leave it
  till Johnny insisted on dinner. Now this dinner was a great excitement; for
  at setting out Johnny had repelled every suggestion of sandwiches in a bag,
  and now dauntlessly marched into an inn on the main road and ordered whatever
  was ready, with two glasses of beer. Bessy, overwhelmed by the audacity of
  the act, nevertheless preserved her appetite, and even drank a little of the
  beer. And the adventure cost Johnny four shillings.</p>

  <p>"Mother's having her dinner alone," said Bessy in a flutter of timid
  delight. "She doesn't guess we're having ours at the Red Deer!"</p>

  <p>Hence it was not far, by the lanes, to the high churchyard, for the
  flowers gathered in Monk Wood were for gran'dad's grave, and it was a duty of
  the day to mark the condition of the little headstone. All was well with it,
  and it surprised them to find the grass cut neatly, and a little clump of
  pansies growing on the mound. Bessy suspected Bob Smallpiece.</p>

  <p>And so went a perfect day. Their tea they took in Bob Smallpiece's lodge.
  The keeper admitted having "gone over" old Mr. May's grave with the grass
  shears&mdash;just once or twice. He avoided making any definite reply to
  Johnny's and Bessy's invitations to come to Harbour Lane again. Perhaps he'd
  come again, he said, some day. Meanwhile, had they seen the cottage? As they
  had not, they set out all three together, and looked at it.</p>

  <p>The new tenancy had made little change. Down the glen the white walls
  first peeped from among the trunks, and then the red tiles, just as ever. The
  woodman was at work mending the old fence&mdash;it was always being mended
  somewhere. The turbulent little garden still tumbled and surged against it,
  threatening to lay it flat at any moment. Very naturally, the woodman and his
  wife, though perfectly civil, took less personal interest in Johnny and Bessy
  than Johnny and Bessy took in them and the cottage, so that it was not long
  ere a last look was taken at the old fence, and Bob Smallpiece went off
  another way on his walk of duty.</p>

  <p>Shadows grew long, and thickets dark. To revisit every remembered nook had
  been impossible, but they had seen and lingered in all them that had most
  delighted Bessy in old times&mdash;all but Wormleyton Pits. Johnny had turned
  that way once, thoughtlessly; but "No," Bessy said&mdash;almost
  whispered&mdash;with her hand on his arm, "not that way, Johnny!"</p>

  <p>And now they turned their backs on the fast darkening forest and took a
  steep lane for the village below. The sweet smells, that go up at the first
  blink of the evening star, met them on the breeze; and when they turned for
  their last look toward the woods, the trees on the hill-top, tall sentinels
  of the host beyond, barred the red west and nodded them and the sun
  goodbye.</p>

  <p>Out of the stony lane, Loughton was lighted, and at the end of a dusty
  road was a small constellation of gas-lamps and railway signals. Now it was
  plain that both were a little tired&mdash;Bessy perhaps more than a little.
  But the train gave a welcome rest, and there were no passengers to see, even
  if she slept, for they were alone in their compartment. They had passed two
  stations, when Johnny, who had been standing to look out at the opposite
  window, turned and saw that his sister was dozing, with her head bent forward
  and her face hidden by the crutch-handle. It was so wholly her figure as she
  sat in the cab at the old man's funeral, that Johnny started, and sat where
  he stood, though he had never once called the thing to mind since that day.
  And he took the crutch gently away, to look at her face. But it was calm and
  untroubled; and he put his hand at the farther side of it and pressed it to
  his shoulder; for plainly she was tired out, and there were no cushions in
  the carriage.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>It was nearing ten o'clock when at last they turned into Harbour Lane.
  From a back street came the old watchman's cry, "Pa-a-ast nine o'clock!" as
  he went his round in search of orders to wake early risers; and lights in
  bedroom windows told of early risers already seeking sleep. Nobody was in the
  shop, but as they came in, Johnny thought he saw his mother's face vanish
  from beside the muslin curtain that obscured the glass in the back-parlour
  door.</p>

  <p>They passed through the shop, and into the back parlour. Their mother and
  Mr. Butson sat facing them, side by side. Mr. Butson had a new suit of
  clothes, and their mother wore her best, and smiles and tears were in her
  face. Something had happened. What was it? Bessy and Johnny, scarce within
  the door, stood and stared.</p>

  <p>"Johnny&mdash;Bessy&mdash;" Nan faltered, looking from one to the other.
  "Have you&mdash;enjoyed your holiday?...Won't you&mdash;kiss me, Johnny?"</p>

  <p>She rose and made a step toward them. But something struck them still, and
  they looked, wondering, from Nan to Butson, and back to their mother
  again...What was it?</p>

  <p>Johnny moved first, and kissed his mother, absently, gazing at Mr. Butson
  the while. Mr. Butson, who was smoking, said nothing, but lay back in his
  chair and considered the ash of his cigar.</p>

  <p>Nan's anxiety was plain to see. She put a hand on Johnny's shoulder and an
  arm on Bessy's neck. "I,&mdash;we&mdash;you won't be vexed because I didn't
  tell you, will you?" she said, pale, but trying to smile,
  "I&mdash;we&mdash;Mr. Butson...Johnny, Bessy&mdash;don't look so!" Tears ran
  down her cheeks, and she bent her head on Johnny's other shoulder. "We've
  been married to-day!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE shock left Johnny and Bessy numb, and, though Bessy was
  quicker, the change took Johnny two or three days to realise&mdash;even to
  understand. His first distinct impression was one of injury and resentment.
  He had been tricked&mdash;hoodwinked. His mother&mdash;even his mother had
  deceived him and Bessy. Why? Why not tell them first?</p>

  <p>She <i>would</i> have told them, he was sure; she told them everything.
  Butson had persuaded her to keep them in ignorance till the thing was done,
  lest they should rebel, and perhaps bring her to a change of mood. And
  Johnny's guess was a good one...Forthwith his resentment became something
  more; hate, mere hate for this man who had come between him and his
  mother&mdash;this cadger of suppers thrusting himself into their intimate
  life...</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;perhaps this was simple anger at the slight and the
  deception; jealousy at finding a stranger as dear to his mother as himself
  was. Butson might turn out none so bad a fellow. He was very decent over the
  callipers, for instance...Curse the callipers!</p>

  <p>Johnny's anger was not to be reasoned down. On Sunday he had his own
  mother. Now there was nothing but Butson's wife.</p>

  <p>More, the man was his father&mdash;his stepfather; chief authority in the
  house, with respect and obedience due to him. That seemed intolerable. For a
  moment Johnny had mad notions of leaving home altogether, and shifting for
  himself&mdash;going aboard ship, abroad, anywhere. But that would be to leave
  Bess alone&mdash;and his mother; his mother might need him yet.</p>

  <p>He told Long Hicks, as they tramped to work over the locks and bridges in
  the bright morning, early and still; and it surprised him to see Hicks's
  tacit concern at the news. The long man reddened and stuttered, and checked
  himself suddenly at an imminent outburst of speech. But that was all; he
  offered no opinion and made no remark; and as he was given to suppressed
  excitement on small occasion, Johnny presently forgot it.</p>

  <p>As for Bessy, her distress, quiet as it was, was beyond telling. Her
  association with her mother had been so intimate that this change was stark
  bereavement; and for Butson and his coarse pretence her feeling was sheer
  repulsion.</p>

  <p>Neither boy nor girl had the habit of dissimulation, and though they said
  little, it needed small discernment to guess something of their sentiments.
  Poor Nan was dismayed to perceive that they did not take to Butson instant on
  the news of the novel relationship. Indeed, it perplexed her. For in her
  simple view he was a resplendent person of finer mould, sore hit by a cruel
  world, and entitled to the respectful sympathy, at least and coldest, of the
  merest stranger. More, nobody could be more completely devoted than he to the
  interests of Johnny and Bessy; he had most vehemently assured her of it,
  again and again. But after all, the thing was sudden; they must realise his
  true worth soon. Though meantime she was distressed extremely.</p>

  <p>Butson saw plainly enough, but for the present cared not at all. He had
  won his game, and for a little time unwonted plenty and comfort satisfied
  him. Though he was not insensible that this was a place wherein he must do
  something more to make himself absolute master.</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac got the news on Tuesday evening, when he came for supper. For
  a week or ten days he had been little seen at Harbour Lane, because of an
  urgent job involving overtime, a thing not to be neglected in these lean
  years. He had suspected nothing, moreover, supposing Butson to be so often
  attracted to Nan's by the mere prospect of supper.</p>

  <p>Now, when he was told, he was near as astonished as Johnny had been. He
  sat at random&mdash;fortunately on a chair&mdash;and opened mouth and eyes.
  But ere his mouth closed he had resolved on his own course. The thing was
  done, and past undoing.</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet, and seized one of Butson's hands&mdash;the
  nearest&mdash;in both his own. "Mr. Butson!" he said: "Butson! Me ole friend
  'Enery&mdash;me dearest 'opes an' wishes is rewarded. Nan, you're done most
  dootiful the confidentialest o' my intentions. For what was my confidential
  intentions? 'Ere, I says, confidential to meself, 'ere is my niece, a young
  woman as I wish every possible good fortun' to, though I sez it meself: a
  very sootable young woman o' some little property with two children an' a
  business. Two children an' a business was my reflection. What's more, 'ere's
  my very respected friend Butson&mdash;than which none more sofash'nable by
  'abit an' connexions, with no children an' no business. Them considerations
  bein' thus what follers? What's the cause an' pediment to 'oly matrimony? Far
  be it from me, sez I, to dictate. But I'll take 'im in to tea, any'ow. An'
  I'll do whatever else is ne'ssry. Yus, I'll do it, sez I, as is my dooty.
  <i>I'll</i> work it if it's mortal possible. Whether grateful or not
  <i>I'll</i> do it. An' I done it."</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac punched his left palm with his right fist, and looked from
  husband to wife, with the eye of the righteous defying censure. Nan flushed
  and smiled, and indeed she was relieved. No consideration of her unaccustomed
  secrecy had given her more doubt than that it must shut her off from Uncle
  Isaac's advice; loss enough in itself, and probably an offence to him.</p>

  <p>"This," Uncle Isaac went on, taking his chair once more and drawing it up
  to the table: "this is a great an' 'appy occasion, an' as sich it should be
  kep' up. Nan, is there sich a thing as a drop o' sperrits in the 'ouse?"</p>

  <p>There was most of a small jar of whisky&mdash;the first purchase Mr.
  Butson had caused on his change of condition. It was brought, with tumblers,
  and Uncle Isaac celebrated the occasion with full honours and much
  fragmentary declamation. He drank the health of bride and bridegroom, first
  separately and then together. He drank the health of the family, completed
  and adorned by the addition of Butson. He drank success to the shop; long
  life to all the parties concerned; happiness to each of them. And a certain
  forgetfulness ensuing, he began his toast-list afresh, in conscientious
  precaution lest something had been omitted.</p>

  <p>"See there, Bess; see there, me gal," he exclaimed, with some thickness of
  utterance, turning to Bessy (whose one desire was to remain unnoticed), and
  making a semicircular swing of the arm in Butson's direction. "Yer father!
  Noo s-stepfather! Local p'rentis! As a cripple an' a burden it's your dooty
  to be grateful for the c-circumstance. Bein' a widderer o' long ex-experience
  meself I'm grateful for s-surroundin' priv'leges, which it is your Booty t'
  respeck. See? Dooty t' respeck an' obey; likewise honour. 'C-cos if shillun
  don' 'speck an' 'bey whash good C-catechism? Eh?" Uncle Isaac's voice grew
  loud and fierce. "Whash become C-catechishm I say? Nullavoid. Ca'chishm's
  nullavoid." Here, pausing to look round at Mr. and Mrs. Butson, he lost his
  argument altogether, and stared owlishly at the wall..."'Owsomedever, the
  'casion bein' the state an' pediment o' 'oly matrimony, 'cordin' to
  confidential 'tentions, nothin' remains but ashk you all join me 'n
  drinkin'&mdash;d-drinkin'&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;lil' drop more."</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac subsided with his face on the table, and his eyes closed. So
  that it grew necessary for Mr. Butson to shake him and bring him to a
  perpendicular. Whereupon, being duly invested with his hat, he was safely set
  in his way on the narrow pavement of Harbour Lane.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">TWICE or thrice more Uncle Isaac came to supper, though he
  was dimly aware that his visits were in some way less successful than had
  been their wont; insomuch that he took nothing home with him for breakfast,
  nor even went so far as to hint his desire, in Butson's presence. For Butson
  welcomed him not at all, and his manner grew shorter at each meeting, and
  this with full intent. Because Mr. Butson perceived that, as first step
  toward being master in his own house, he must get rid of Uncle Isaac.</p>

  <p>Mere curtness of manner&mdash;even gruffness&mdash;would never drive
  Uncle. Isaac from his prey. It operated only to make him more voluble, more
  strenuously blandiloquent. Till one evening after supper, as he lay back in
  his chair sucking noisily at lips and teeth, he resolved to venture a step in
  the matter of the lapsed grants in aid of breakfast. Johnny and Bessy were
  out of the house (they went out more often now), Nan was serving in the shop,
  and Mr. Butson sat with his back partly turned, and smoked, in uncivil
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" quoth Uncle Isaac, with a side-glance at his ungracious host,
  "that's a uncommon nice tin o' spiced beef we just 'ad a cut auf.
  Uncommon."</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson made no answer.</p>

  <p>"It's a great credit to your business instinks, that tin o' spiced beef. I
  almost wish I 'ad took another slice or so, now." As a fact, Uncle Isaac had
  not been offered a further helping&mdash;perhaps because he had already taken
  three. "I almost wish I 'ad...Never mind. It'll do another time. . . . Come
  now, I've 'alf a mind to get Nan to wrop it up for my breakfast!"</p>

  <p>The suggestion was made as of a novel and striking idea, but Mr. Butson
  showed no flash of enthusiasm. He swung his chair slowly round on one leg
  till he faced Uncle Isaac. Then he put his cigar carefully on the mantelpiece
  and said:&mdash;"Look 'ere, Mr. Mundy!"</p>

  <p>The sudden severity of the voice drew Uncle Isaac's eyes from the ceiling
  and his feet from under the table simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Look 'ere, Mr. Mundy! You're bin so very kind as to celebrate this 'ere
  weddin' o' mine with four good 'eavy suppers an' about a pint o' whisky at my
  expense. I'm very grateful for that, an' I won't trouble you no more. See?
  This is the end o' the celebration. I'm goin' to eat my supper in future, me
  an' my wife, without your assistance; an' breakfast too. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac's feet retreated under his chair, and his eyes advanced to an
  alarming protrusion.</p>

  <p>"See what I mean?" Butson went on, with growing offence in his voice.
  "Jest you buy yer own suppers an' eat 'em at 'ome, or else go without."</p>

  <p>Speech was denied Uncle Isaac. He blinked and choked. What did it mean?
  Was it a dream? Was he Uncle Isaac, respected and deferred to, the man of
  judgment and influence, and was he told, thus outrageously, to buy his own
  supper?</p>

  <p>"Yus," said Butson, as though in answer to his thoughts. "I mean it!"</p>

  <p>Whereat Uncle Isaac, with a gasp and a roll of the eyes, found his tongue.
  "Mr. Butson!" he said, in a voice of dignified but grieved surprise. "Mr.
  Butson! I&mdash;I think I must 'a 'eard wrong. Otherwise I might put it as
  you may be sorry for sich words."</p>

  <p>"P'raps," remarked Butson, cynically laconic.</p>

  <p>"In which case," replied Uncle Isaac the adroit, "it is freely took as
  auffered, an' nothin' more need be said atween of friends after sich 'ansome
  apologies give an' took, and reconciliation resooms its 'armony
  accordin'."</p>

  <p>Butson glared. "G-r-r-r!" he growled. "Apologies! What I say I mean.
  You've done very well at cheap suppers an' what not 'ere, and to-night you've
  'ad yer last. Pm master 'ere now. An' you can git out as soon as ye
  like."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Git out. Y'ought to be ashamed o' yourself," cried the disinterested
  Butson indignantly, "comin' cadgin' suppers!"</p>

  <p>"Git out? Me? Suppers? Why, 'Enery Butson, I brought you 'ere out o' the
  gutter! Out o' the gutter, an' fed ye!"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;a lot you fed me, and mighty anxious to do it, wasn't ye? You
  clear out o' 'ere!"</p>

  <p>"O I'll go! an' I'll see about countermandin' a paper or two 'fore I go to
  bed, too. An' my small property&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yer small property!" put in Butson, with slow scorn. "Yer small property!
  Where is it? What is it?...Want to know my opinion o' you? You're a old
  'umbug. That's what you are. A old 'umbug."</p>

  <p>Uncle Isaac grew furious and purple. "'Umbug?" he said. "'Umbug? Them
  words to me, as saved ye from starvation? 'Umbug yerself. You an' yer
  connexions, an' mayors an' what not! Why, ye dunno yer own trade! I wouldn't
  trust ye to grind a cawfy-mill!"</p>

  <p>With that the shop-door opened, and Nan stood between them. She had heard
  high voices, and at the first cessation of custom she came to see. "Uncle!
  Henry! What is it?" she asked, with alarm in her face.</p>

  <p>"This is what it is," said Butson, now near as purple as Uncle Isaac.
  "This 'ere uncle o' yours, Mrs. Butson, or whatever 'e is, ain't comin' 'ere
  cadgin' 'is grub any more; not so long as I got a say in it 'e ain't. See? So
  now you better say good-bye to 'im if ye want to, 'cos 'e's goin',
  quick."</p>

  <p>"O yus," said Uncle Isaac, speaking to his niece, but glaring at Butson,
  "I'm goin', Mrs. Butson. An' much better may you be for it. After what I done
  for you an' all. Sort o' gratitood I might 'a' expected!"</p>

  <p>"O uncle!" exclaimed the distracted Nan. "Why, whatever's the matter? I
  know you've always been very good. Henry! What's it all about?"</p>

  <p>"About puttin' a end to this 'ere bloodsuckin', that's all!"</p>

  <p>"Bloodsuckin'!" exclaimed Uncle Isaac. "Yus, you know somethin' about
  that! Pity ye don't know yer trade 'alf as well! Then p'raps you'd earn yer
  livin', 'stead o' spongin' on people an' deloodin' a fool of a woman to keep
  ye lazy!"</p>

  <p>"Go on! go on!" commanded Butson, with increasing wrath.</p>

  <p>"No, uncle, stop a minute," entreated poor Nan. "Don't, Henry, don't let's
  quarrel!"</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>"O yus, I'll go. P'raps you'd like to call the p'lice?"</p>

  <p>Butson caught breath at the word, and something crossed his face like a
  chance reflection from a white screen. But he repeated, "Go on!" with a
  gesture toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Yus, yus!" said Uncle Isaac, with his hat on his head. "I'm goin'! An'
  not sorry neither. Ho! You're a bright sort for a local p'rentis, you are!"
  (Uncle Isaac may have been at odds with the phrase in <i>loco parentis).</i>
  "A uncommon neat pattern!" And he walked out into the dark street, a small
  model of offended dignity.</p>

  <p>"O Henry," cried Nan in tears, "what have you done?"</p>

  <p>"I've done," answered Butson, reaching for his cigar, "jist what I meant
  to do. That's all. 'Cos it suited me. See?"</p>

  <p>Nan felt the coarse overbearance of his stare, and dropped her gaze
  beneath it. And with that misgiving fell upon her: the shadow her punishment
  flung before it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. HENRY BUTSON had fallen on good fortune. No more would
  he endure the humiliation of begging a job of an unsympathetic gaffer. In
  future his life would be one of ease, free from ignoble exertion and unshamed
  by dungaree overalls. And he made it so. For a little while, his wife seemed
  to indulge in an absurd expectation that he would resume his search for
  occupation of one sort or another. Once she even hinted it, but he soon
  demolished that fancy, and in terms that prevented any more hints. He had
  little patience with such foolishness, indeed. The matter was simple enough.
  Why did a man work? Merely to get shelter and food and clothes and comfort,
  and hair-oil, whatever he wanted to drink and smoke, and his necessary
  pocket-money. A man who could get these things without working would be a
  fool to work; more, he would behave inhumanly to his fellow man by excluding
  him from a job. As for himself, he got what he needed easily enough, without
  the trouble of even taking down the shop-shutters: a vulgar act repellent to
  his nature.</p>

  <p>So he rose at ten, or eleven, or twelve, as the case might be, and donned
  fine raiment; the most fashionable suit procurable from the most fashionable
  shop in Aldgate. He began at Aldgate; but in time he grew more fastidious,
  and went to a tailor in Leadenhall Street, a tailor whose daily task was to
  satisfy the tastes of the most particular among the ship-brokers' clerks of
  St. Mary Axe. His toilet complete, his curls well oiled, Mr. Butson descended
  to a breakfast of solitary state&mdash;Nan's had been hurried over hours ago.
  The rest of the day was given as occasion prompted. When the weather was
  fine, nothing pleased him better, nor more excellently agreed with his
  genteel propensities, than to go for a stroll up West. When Harbour Lane was
  quiet and empty (he seemed to choose such times for going out) he would slip
  round to the station, and by train and omnibus gain the happy region. He was
  careful to take with him enough money to secure some share of the polite
  gratifications proper to the quarter, and minutely acquainted himself with
  the manners and customs of all the bars in the Strand and about Piccadilly
  Circus. And although he was a little astonished when first he was charged
  eighteenpence for an American drink, he was careful not to show it, and
  afterwards secretly congratulated himself on the refined instinct that had
  pitched on so princely a beverage in the dark, so to speak. He took air, too,
  in Hyde Park, to the great honour of his whiskers, and much improved his
  manner of leaning on a rail and of sitting in a green chair. In the evening
  he tried, perhaps, a music hall, but always some of the bars, and arrived
  home at night rather late, sometimes a trifle unsteady, and usually in a bad
  temper. Bad temper was natural, indeed, in the circumstances; after so many
  hours' indulgence in the delights of fashionable society it revolted his
  elegant nature to have to return at last to a vulgar little chandler's-shop
  in a riverside street, where a wife in a print bodice and a white apron was
  sitting up for him; sometimes even crying&mdash;for nothing at all&mdash;as
  if the circumstances were not depressing enough for him already.</p>

  <p>These little excursions cost money, of course, but then what was the good
  of keeping an ignoble little shop if you couldn't get money out of it? And
  the shop did very well. Mrs. Butson and the girl&mdash;the cripple&mdash;were
  boiling bacon (the smell was disgusting) all day long, and they sold it as
  fast as it was cold. And other things sold excellently too. From the time
  when she took the shutters down in the morning to the time when the lad
  Johnny put them up at night, Mrs. Butson was unceasingly at work
  serving&mdash;unless she were boiling&mdash;and scarce had five minutes for
  her meals; and often the girl had to leave the bacon and help in the shop
  too. Very well&mdash;all that meant profit. The woman couldn't make him
  believe that it didn't, merely because the wretched details of trade failed
  to interest him. That was the way of people in that class of life&mdash;there
  was a touch of the miser about all of them. No matter how the money came in,
  they persisted in their narrow views as to spending it. And there was other
  income, in addition. The lad Johnny&mdash;he was almost a man to look
  at&mdash;brought his mother eight shillings a week at the time of the
  wedding, and then ten shillings, and then twelve; more, it would increase two
  shillings a year; but in truth his mother was unduly extravagant in buying
  him clothes. Still at anyrate there was something, and there might be more if
  only Mrs. Butson would turn the girl out to earn a little, instead of letting
  her waste her time reading, and confirming her in habits of idleness. And
  there was the rent from the cottage. This came every week by postal order
  from Bob Smallpiece, and since it was fitting that a husband should open
  letters sent his wife by a single man, Mr. Butson cashed the orders without
  troubling her in the matter at all.</p>

  <p>So that indeed he was not at all wasteful, considering both his income and
  the society he moved in&mdash;for he was not slow in making acquaintances
  among the affable gentility of the bars. In fact he would have done it
  cheaper still but for the pestilent uncertainty of Spring Handicaps. It would
  seem impossible for him to put half a sovereign on any horse without dooming
  it to something very near the last place. The distinguished society of the
  bars was profoundly astonished, indeed distressed, at his ill-luck; but gave
  him more excellent information for future events; information, however, that
  brought even worse luck with it.</p>

  <p>His wife showed no sympathy for his troubles&mdash;and of course there are
  vexations and disappointments (such as those of the Spring Handicaps) which
  are inseparable from fashionable life&mdash;but rather aggravated them with
  hole-and-corner snivelling, and ridiculous attempts at persuading him to a
  mean and inglorious way of life. She even hinted vulgar suspicion of his
  west-end friends, and suggested that he should associate with a. long fool
  called Hicks, living next door&mdash;a common working man. For a long
  time&mdash;many months in fact&mdash;he bore it with what patience he might,
  retaliating only in such terms as seemed necessary to close her mouth, and to
  convince her of his contempt for her low habit of mind, and indeed, for
  herself; and when at last it grew plain that personal punching was what was
  needed, he was so considerate as not to punch her about the face, where marks
  would advertise the state of his domestic affairs; careful, also, to operate
  not other than quietly, when they were alone, on the same grounds of decency.
  And he knew that she would tell nobody, for at least she had self-respect
  enough for that.</p>

  <p>Of these things Johnny knew nothing, and Bessy only a little. Both were
  glad that their stepfather was so much from home, and though Johnny's
  sentiment toward him was a mere sullen contempt, the lad made no parade of
  the fact,&mdash;rather aimed indeed at keeping things quiet for his mother's
  sake. But Bessyetted in secret.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">JOHNNY'S months went uneventfully. At Maidment and Hurst's
  he applied himself zealously to his trade&mdash;the more because home was a
  dull place now&mdash;and he was as smart a lad as any in the shop of his age,
  or perhaps of a few months older. He could turn back an eyelid, too, and whip
  away an iron filing, or a speck of emery grit, with such address and
  certainty as might astonish a surgeon. The operation was one that every
  engineer's apprentice grew apt at, and exceptional dexterity like Johnny's
  was a matter of pride, a distinction zealously striven for, an accomplishment
  to exercise at every opportunity. Johnny felt that he had passed with honours
  on the memorable day when Cottam, the gaffer, roared to him from the other
  end of the shop to come and attend to his eye, afflicted with a sharp grain
  of brass. "No&mdash;not you," quoth Mr. Cottam, in answer to instant offers
  of help from those hard by. "This 'ere'll stick like a nail in a barn door.
  Where's young May? D'y'ear? Where's young Jack May?"</p>

  <p>Much of his practical knowledge Johnny owed to Long Hicks. That recluse,
  whose sole friend hitherto had been his accordion, now declared for a second
  hobby, which was to turn Johnny into the best workman at Maidment and Hurst's
  before his time was out. "You've got all the chances," said Long Hicks.
  "You're servin' yer time on small work&mdash;alwis best for trainin' a
  first-rate man. I'm reckoned a good fitter, but I served time mostly on big
  work, or I'd 'a' bin better."</p>

  <p>He recommended Johnny to qualify as a marine engineer when his
  apprenticeship was over, even if he intended to live a shore life. "You get
  yer c'tificates, an' then you're all right," he would say. "An' the better
  c'tificates you get the better you'll do, afloat or ashore. So as soon as
  your time's out, off you go an' serve your year at sea as fourth or fifth of
  a good boat, if you can get the job. The rest'll be easy as winkin' to a
  quick young chap like you. You can draw nice an' neat&mdash;I can put a thing
  down acc'rate enough, but I can't draw it neat&mdash;and what with one thing
  an' another I b'lieve you could pass your second now. I ought to 'a' done it,
  p'raps, but I lose me 'ed at any-thin' like a 'xamination. An' I never 'ad
  over-much schoolin'. Them compound multiplications 'ud 'ave me over ev'ry
  time. I s'pose you don't think nothin' of a compound multiplication?"</p>

  <p>Johnny admitted that he had gone a long way beyond that rule of
  arithmetic.</p>

  <p>"Yus," Hicks answered. "I've got beyond it, too, teachin' meself. I know
  'ow to do 'em well enough. But Lord! what a strain they are! Tons,
  'undredweights, quarters, pounds, ounces, an' grains, an' multiply 'em by
  five 'undred an' twenty-seven thousan' six 'undred an' eighty-three. There
  ain't no end to a job like that, an' yer brain on the stretch all the time,
  'cos a tick out'll make it about a million tons wrong in the end. It 'ud send
  me foamin' mad, at a 'xamination an' all, with a chap waitin' for the sum!
  Phew!" And Long Hicks's forehead went clammy at the fancy.</p>

  <p>"But there," he proceeded, <i>"you're</i> all right. You'll knock auf your
  second's examination easy as marbles; an' then you'll do yer chief's 'an
  extry chief's all in one, an' then you'll do the Board o' Trade, an' be a
  guarantee chief or anythin' ye like! You will, by George!" and the lank man
  gazed in Johnny's face (Johnny was sitting on Hicks's bed) with much respect
  and admiration, being fully persuaded, in the enthusiasm of the moment, that
  the lad had already as good as achieved the triumphs he prophesied.</p>

  <p>But there was work to do, and Johnny did it. Mechanical drawing, when its
  novelty had worn off, was less delightful than the fancy-free draughtsmanship
  he had practised as a schoolboy, and it had an arid twang of decimals and
  vulgar fractions. Still, for a time there was a charm in the gradual
  unfolding of the inner principles of his work, and in the disclosure, piece
  by piece, of the cunning complication that stood ministrant on the main
  simplicity of a great steam engine; till the beauty of the thing in its
  completeness came in sight, with something of surprise in it. Though this,
  too, grew a commonplace as familiarity cheapened it, and then his work was
  work merely. And so it went till half the time of his apprenticeship was
  over, and he was eighteen, and a sinewy young fellow.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he drew at home, and sometimes in Hicks's room. Hicks had a few
  books&mdash;editions a little out of date, some of them, but all
  useful&mdash;and these were at Johnny's service: Seaton's <i>Manual,</i>
  Reed's <i>Handbook,</i> Donaldson's <i>Drawing and Rough Sketching,</i> and
  the like. Hicks's room was inconvenient for drawing, but nothing would tempt
  Hicks next door, and once or twice Mr. Butson had come home when Johnny's
  drawing-board and implements littered the table in the shop-parlour, and made
  objections.</p>

  <p>"My eye!" exclaimed Hicks, one evening, in face of a crank-shaft elevation
  and sections, as Johnny held it up on the board; "why that's a drawin' good
  enough to put in a frame! I tell ye what, me lad. With a bit more practice,
  an' a bit o' the reg'lar professional touch, you'll be good enough for a
  draughtsman's job. Lord! you'll be a master some day, an' I'll come an' get a
  job of you! Look 'ere, no more o' this gropin' about alone. Round you go to
  the Institute, an' chip into the Mechanical Drawin' class. That's your game.
  They'll put you up to the reg'lar drawin'-auffice capers."</p>

  <p>Thus urged, Johnny went to the Institute. This was an evening school,
  founded by a ship-builder twenty years earlier. Here a few lads, earnest as
  Johnny, came to work and to learn, and a great many more, differently
  disposed, came to dabble. There was a gymnasium, too, and a cricket-club, and
  plenty of boxing. And girls came, to learn cookery and dressmaking: and there
  were sometimes superior visitors from other parts, oozing with inexpensive
  patronage, who spoke of Johnny and his companions as the Degraded Classes,
  who were to be Raised from the Depths.</p>

  <p>And so in the Institute Johnny drew, and learned the proper drawing-office
  manner of projection. Learned also the muscle-grinder and the long-arm
  balance on the horizontal bar, and more particularly learned to pop in a
  straight left, to duck and counter, and to give and take a furious pounding
  for three minutes on end without losing wind or good-humour. So that his
  attention was diverted from home, and for long he saw nothing of the misery
  his mother suffered in secret, nothing of the meek endurance of Bessy; and
  for the more reason because both studied to keep him ignorant, and to show
  him cheerful faces.</p>

  <p>But there came an evening when his eyes were opened&mdash;in some degree,
  at least. Perhaps something especially perverse had happened in a Spring
  Handicap (Spring Handicaps were just beginning), perhaps it was some other of
  the vexations that beset a gentlemanly career: but certainly Mr. Henry Butson
  came into Harbour Lane in no amiable mood. At the corner, where a
  public-house shed light across the street, he ran into a stout bare-armed
  girl in a faded ultramarine hat, and made to push her roughly aside. But the
  girl stood her ground, and planted an untender elbow near the spot where his
  watch-chain hung resplendent. "Garn!" she cried, "bought the street, 'ave
  yer?" And then as he sought to pass on: "D'y'ear! Ye got yer collar an' yer
  chain; where's yer muzzle?"</p>

  <p>Nowise mollified by this outrage, Mr. Butson came scowling in at the shop
  door, and taking no notice of Nan, who stood at the counter, entered the back
  parlour and slammed the door behind him. It was barely nine o'clock, and so
  early a return was uncommon.</p>

  <p>Bessy sat by the fireside, sewing. Mr. Butson was angry with the world,
  sorely needing someone to bully, and Bessy was providentially convenient. He
  put a cigar into his mouth and strode across to the shelf in the corner,
  shoving the girl and her chair and her crutch out of his way in a heap. The
  shelf carried Bessy's tattered delight of old books; and, dragging a random
  handful of leaves from among them, while a confused bunch fell on the floor,
  he twisted up one leaf and thrust it into the gas flame.</p>

  <p>Bessy seized his arm. "O don't!" she pleaded. "Please don't! Not out of
  the book! There's a lot I made on the mantelpiece! Don't, O don't!"</p>

  <p>Indeed a glass vase stood full of pipe-lights. But he jerked his elbow
  into her face, knocking her backward, and swore savagely. He lit his pipe
  with the precious leaf, and then, because Bessy wept, he took another handful
  from the shelf and pitched it on the fire. At this, pleading the harder, she
  limped forward to snatch them off, but Mr. Butson, with a timely fling of the
  foot, checked her sound leg, and brought her headlong on the fender.</p>

  <p>"Yus," he roared, furious at the contumacy, "you take 'em auf, when I put
  'em on! Go on, an' see what I'll do to ye? Damn lazy skewshanked 'eifer!" He
  took her by the shoulder as she made to rise, and pushed her forward. "Go an'
  earn yer livin', y'idle slut!"</p>

  <p>Nan, in the shop, heard from the beginning, and trembled. Her impulse to
  interfere she checked as she might, for she well knew <i>that</i> would
  worsen Bessy's plight; but it was choking hard.</p>

  <p>In the midst Johnny burst in from the street, whistling. "Why, mother," he
  said, "what's up? Ill? You look&mdash;what's that?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing, Johnny. Don't go in. I'll go. Stay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But there was a cry and a noise of falling. Johnny flung open the parlour
  door and stood aghast.</p>

  <p>...Butson pushed the girl forward. "Go an' earn yer livin', y' idle slut!
  Get out o' this!"</p>

  <p>For a second Johnny stared. Then he reached Butson at a spring and knocked
  him backward with a swing of his right fist. The crutch lay behind the man's
  heels and tripped him, so that he sat backward on the floor, mightily
  astonished. Johnny snatched the poker and waved it close about Butson's
  head.</p>

  <p>"Don't you move!" he cried, white with passion. "Don't you try to get up,
  or I'll beat your head in!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson raised his arm to save his skull, but caught a blow across the
  bone that sent it numb to his side.</p>

  <p>"Johnny&mdash;don't!" cried Nan, snatching at his arm. "O Henry! pray
  don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get away, mother," said Johnny, "or I'll have to hit his head! You
  blackguard coward! You&mdash;you're a meaner hound even than I took you for!
  You'll touch my sister&mdash;a lame girl&mdash;will you?" At the thought he
  struck, but again Nan caught at him, and only Mr. Butson's shoulder
  suffered.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Johnny!" his mother entreated. "Think o' the neighbours! They can
  hear next door!"</p>

  <p>So they could, and for the sake of trade the proprieties of Harbour Lane
  must be respected. To have a row in the house was a scandal unpardonable in
  Harbour Lane. In the height of his anger Johnny remembered, and instinctively
  dropped his voice. "Very well," he said, "then call a p'liceman&mdash;I'll
  lock him up!"</p>

  <p>Johnny's anger kept his reason half astray yet, or he would have
  remembered that to have a member of the household taken off by a policeman
  would be more disgraceful than twenty rows. But Mr. Butson's consternation,
  though momentary, was plain.</p>

  <p>"Johnny, Johnny," pleaded poor Nan, "think of the disgrace! Do let's make
  it up&mdash;for my sake, Johnny!"</p>

  <p>Bessy was crying in a corner, and Nan was choking and sobbing. Johnny
  wavered, and the poker stopped in mid-air. Butson took heart of grace and
  moved to get up, though he kept his eye on the poker. "Better take 'im away,"
  he growled to Nan, "if ye don't want me to smash 'im!"</p>

  <p>Straightway the poker waved again, and Mr. Buston changed his mind as to
  getting up. "Smash me?" Johnny asked. "Smash me, eh? Keep a civil tongue, or
  you shall have it now! See?" and he thrust the point against Mr. Butson's
  nose, leaving a black smear. "Don't think I care for you! If this was
  anywhere else I'd ha' broken your head in twenty places! Now you sit there
  an' listen to me, Mr. Butson. What you are we know. You came here starving,
  with about half a suit o' boiler clothes in the world, and my mother fed
  you&mdash;out o' charity, an' worse luck. She fed you, and she put clothes on
  your lazy carcase, and you cadged and begged as a mongrel dog wouldn't. Stop
  where you are, or you'll have it!" This with another flourish of the poker
  and another smear on the nose. Mr. Butson sat up again, a figure of
  ignominy.</p>

  <p>"You talked my mother over, and you married her, and you've lived on her
  ever since, like a gentleman&mdash;or like what you think's a
  gentleman&mdash;you, not worth boy's pay on a mud-barge! Now see here! I'm
  not a boy now&mdash;or at anyrate I'm not a little one. I'm within half a
  head as tall as you. I'm not so strong as you now perhaps, and I know I'm not
  as big. But some day I shall be stronger, because you're rotting yourself
  with idleness and booze, and then I'll give you a bigger hiding than you can
  carry, for what I saw just now! You look forward to that! Until then, if you
  put your hand within a foot of my sister again, I'll brain you with this
  poker, or I'll stick something into you,&mdash;I'll go for you with whatever
  I can lay hold of! Now you remember that!"</p>

  <p>Johnny's voice was loud again, and once more Nan appealed.</p>

  <p>"All right, mother," he answered, more quietly, "but I'll make him
  understand. I shall keep a little more at home in the evenings now, my fine
  fellow, and I shall take all this table to draw on, whether you like it or
  not, unless my sister or my mother want to use it. I've got more right here
  than you. And if I go out I'll ask about your behaviour when I come in. I've
  kept quiet and knuckled under to you, for the sake of peace, and so as not to
  worry mother. There's been enough o' that. If you want rows you shall have
  'em! I'll make you as frightened of me as you are of the p'lice. Ah! you know
  what I mean!" Johnny had no idea of what he meant himself, but he had been
  sharp enough to observe the effect of his earlier allusion to the police, and
  he followed it up. "You know what I mean! You'd look a deal more at home in
  gaol than here, in a white shirt, eating other people's victuals!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson decided that bluster would not do just at present. He wondered
  if Johnny really did know anything, and how much. But surely not, or he would
  go a good deal farther. Anyway, best be cautious. So Mr. Butson growled, "Oh,
  all right. Damn lot o' fuss to make over nothin'. <i>I</i> don't want no
  words."</p>

  <p>And Bessy, still crying, took hold of her brother's arm and said, "Don't
  say any more, Johnny, please. I&mdash;I&mdash;p'raps I oughtn't to ha' done
  what I did!"</p>

  <p>"What you did!" Johnny answered, not so cheaply appeased. "You do what you
  like, Bess&mdash;I'll see <i>he</i> don't interfere. He says he don't want
  any words&mdash;he shan't have 'em. He'll have something harder if he touches
  you! Let go my arm a minute. Go on, you can get up now!" This to Butson, with
  the black nose. "You'd better go an' wash yourself. But none o' your tricks!
  If you try to lay hold o' me from behind, or anything like that, you'll get
  it, with anything I can catch hold of! So now you know!"</p>

  <p>And Mr. Henry Butson, growling indistinctly, went out to wash his face,
  closely watched by Johnny, poker in hand.</p>

  <p>Next door, on one side, heads were thrust out at the back-door to listen
  to the unwonted noise of quarrelling at the chandler's; and on the other side
  other heads were thrust out at the front door. Because the law of
  irregularity in the building of Harbour Lane decreed a back-garden to the one
  house and a front-garden to the other.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">HIS home in Harbour Lane grew less sufferable than ever to
  Mr. Butson's tastes. His contempt remained for the sordid surroundings, the
  vulgar trade, the simple wife&mdash;for everything about the place in fact,
  with the reasonable exceptions of the money he extracted from it and the food
  he ate there; and now there was the new affliction of an unsubmissive
  stepson. A stepson, moreover, who watched, and who kept alert ears for any
  expedient assertion of authority whereat he might raise mutiny; a most
  objectionable stepson in every way, far too big, and growing bigger every
  day; who would not forget bygones, and who had a nasty, suggestive way of
  handling the poker&mdash;a large poker, an unnecessarily heavy poker for a
  sitting-room. And he seemed to suspect things too, and talked unpleasantly of
  the police; a thing that turned one hot and cold together. So Mr. Butson went
  more up West, and sought longer solace in the society of the bars.</p>

  <p>As for Johnny, finding Butson ceasing, so far as he could see, from active
  offence, he gave thought to other things; though watching still. His drawing
  was among the other matters that claimed his care; but chief of them all was
  a different thing altogether.</p>

  <p>For at the Institute he had found the girl he first saw on the dark
  morning when he set out to be an engineer. He had seen her since&mdash;once
  as he was on his way to a ship-launch, and twice a little later; then not at
  all for eighteen months at least, till he began to forget. But now that he
  saw her again and found her a woman&mdash;or grown as much a woman as he was
  grown a man&mdash;he wondered that he could ever have forgotten for a moment;
  more, when he had seen her twice or thrice, and knew the turn of her head and
  the nearing of her step, he was desperately persuaded that nothing in the
  world, nor time nor tide, could make him forget again. So that he resolved to
  learn to dance.</p>

  <p>But the little society that danced at the Institute saw nothing of her,
  this radiant unforgettable. She came twice a week to the dressmaking class;
  wherein she acted as monitor or assistant to the teacher, being, as Johnny
  later discovered&mdash;by vast exertions&mdash;a dressmaker herself, in her
  daily work. She made no friendships, walked sedately apart, and was in some
  sort a mystery; being for these reasons regarded as "stuck-up" by the girls
  of the class, and so made a target for many small needle-thrusts of spite.
  Johnny had a secret notion that she remembered him; because she would pass
  him with so extreme an unconsciousness in her manner, so very blank an
  unacquaintance in her eyes. Neat and grey in her dress, she had ever a placid
  gravity of air, almost odd by contrast with the unceasing smirk and giggle of
  the rest of the girls of the Institute. And her name&mdash;another happy
  discovery, attained at great expense of artless diplomacy&mdash;was Nora
  Sansom.</p>

  <p>And now for awhile the practice of orthographic projection suffered from
  neglect and abstraction of mind. Long Hicks, all ignorant of the cause, was
  mightily concerned, and expostulated, with a face of perplexed surprise, much
  poking of fingers through the hair, and jerking at the locks thus separated.
  But it was a great matter that tugged so secretly at Johnny's mind, and daily
  harder at his heart-strings, till he blushed in solitude to find himself so
  weak a creature. Nora Sansom did not come to the dancing. She knew nobody
  that he knew. She was unapproachable as&mdash;as a Chinese Empress. How to
  approach Nora Sansom? And at the thought he gulped and tingled, and was more
  than a little terrified. He was not brought to a stand by contemplation of
  any distinct interposing labyrinth of conventional observance, such as he who
  can see can pick his way through in strict form; but by a difficulty palpable
  to instinct rather than figured in mind: an intangible barrier that vexed
  Johnny to madness, so that he hammered the Institute punching-ball with blind
  fury. And again, because the world was now grown so many heavens wider, he
  would sit and dream of things beyond its farthest margin yet. And between
  plan and section, crank-shaft and piston, he would wake to find himself
  designing monograms of the letters N. S. and J. M. Altogether becoming a sad
  young fool, such as none of us ever was in the like circumstances.</p>

  <p>But an angel&mdash;two angels, to be exact, both of them rather
  stout&mdash;came one night to Johnny's aid. They came all unwitting, in a
  cab, being man and wife, and their simple design was to see for themselves
  the Upraising of the Hopeless Residuum. They had been told, though they
  scarce believed, that at the Institute, far East&mdash;much farther East than
  Whitechapel, and therefore, without doubt, deeper sunk in dirt and
  iniquity&mdash;the young men and women danced together under regular
  ball-room conventions, neither bawling choruses nor pounding one another with
  quart pots. It was even said that partners were introduced in proper form
  before dancing&mdash;a thing so ludicrous in its incongruity as to give no
  choice but laughter. So the two doubters from the West End (it was only
  Bayswater, really) took a cab, to see these things for themselves.</p>

  <p>But, having taken no pains to inform themselves of the order of things at
  the Institute, they arrived on an evening when there was no dancing. This was
  very annoying, and they said so, with acerbity. They were, indeed, so very
  indignant at the disconformity of the arrangements to their caprice, and so
  extremely and so obviously important, and the lady waggled her gilt-handled
  lorgnon with such offended majesty, that it was discussed among those in
  direction whether or not something might be done to appease them. And in the
  end, after a few hasty inquiries, the classes were broken up for the evening
  and an off-hand dance was declared, to the music extracted from the Institute
  piano and the fiddle of a blushing young amateur.</p>

  <p>The girls came in gay and chattering from the dressmaking class, and the
  lads rushed to exchange gymnasium-flannels for the clothes they had come
  in&mdash;all unconscious that they were to be made a show of. They who kept
  their dancing-shoes on the premises triumphed in their foresight, and Johnny
  was among them. As for him, he had seen Nora Sansom coming in with the
  others, alone and a little shy, and he resolved to seize occasion with both
  hands.</p>

  <p>And he did so very gallantly, with less trepidation than at a calmer
  moment he would have judged possible. First a quadrille was called, and
  Johnny's courage rose&mdash;for as yet he had no great confidence in his
  dancing in general, but he <i>did</i> know the figures of a quadrille, having
  learned them by rote, as most boys learn Euclid, He laid hands on the mild
  young shopman who had unexpectedly found himself appointed master of
  ceremonies, and in two minutes he was standing in a set with Nora Sansom at
  his side. The sheer pride of it disorganised his memory, so that it was lucky
  they were a side couple, or there would have been a rout in the first figure.
  Johnny's partner knew very little or nothing of dancing, but she was quick to
  learn, and Johnny, a rank beginner himself, had a proud advantage in his
  knowledge of the figures&mdash;unstable as it was. So that the thing went
  very joyfully, and the girl's eyes grew brighter and her face gayer each
  moment to the end. For her life had been starved of merriment, and here was
  merriment in plenty, of the sort a girl loves.</p>

  <p>Four or five dances were all there were, for the place shut at ten. To
  dance them all with Nora Sansom were impossible and scandalous, for everybody
  was very "particular" at the Institute. But Johnny went as far as two and a
  "sit out," and extracted a half-promise that she would come and dance some
  other time. More, he walked two streets of the way home with her, and the way
  was paved with clouds of glory. Why he might go no farther he could not
  guess, but there he was dismissed, quite unmistakably, though pleasantly
  enough.</p>

  <p>Fair, very fair were the poor little streets in the moonlight as Johnny
  walked home, and very sweet the air. It was a good world, a kind world, a
  world as one may see it who has emptied a bottle of good champagne. Johnny
  would have shaken hands with anybody on the way&mdash;probably even with
  Butson if he had met him; but nobody made the offer, and even the
  baked-chestnut man&mdash;he was still there, by the high wall&mdash;growled
  merely when Johnny gave him good night. And so Johnny went to dreams of
  gentle grey eyes in a dimpled face with brown hair about it. For few of the
  song-book beauties were Nora Sansom's. Her hair was neither golden nor black,
  but simple brown like the hair of most other people, and her eyes were mere
  grey; yet Johnny dreamed.</p>

  <p>As for the two angels from Bayswater who caused all these things to come
  to pass, they looked at the dancing from the gallery, and said that it was
  really very creditable, considering; quite surprising, indeed, for people of
  that class, and they hoped it didn't lead to immorality. And they went home
  virtuously conscious of having done their duty toward the Submerged. But the
  lady left her gilt-handled lorgnon in the cab, whereof the gentleman hadn't
  thought to take the number. And the lady said a great many times before they
  went to bed (and after) that it was Just Like a Man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE weeks went, and the time neared when dancing at the
  Institute would end for the season&mdash;would end with a bang and a dazzle
  in a "long night," when dancing would be kept up shamelessly till something
  nearer one o'clock than twelve. Johnny counted, first the weeks, then the
  days, and last the hours. Not because of the dancing, although that was
  amusing, but because he was to take Nora Sansom with his double ticket. For
  herself, she may have counted days and hours, or may not; but true it was
  that she sat up late on several nights, with nun's veiling and ribbons,
  making a dress for the occasion&mdash;the first fine frock that had been
  hers. And every night she hid it carefully.</p>

  <p>Each dressmaking-class night of late it had been Johnny's privilege to
  guard her home-going to the end of that second street&mdash;never farther.
  Twice she had come to dancing, and by that small practice was already
  Johnny's superior at the exercise; for a big-shouldered novice of eleven
  stone two is a slower pupil than any girl of eighteen in the world. And they
  were very welcome one to the other, and acquaintance bettered day by day.
  Once Johnny ventured a question about the adventure of the morning, now more
  than three years ago, but learned little from Miss Sansom's answer. The lady
  who was ill was her relation, she said, and she found her; and then she
  talked of something else.</p>

  <p>And so till the evening before the "long night." It was the rule at the
  Institute to honour the long night with gloves and white ties, by way of
  compromise with evening dress; and Johnny bought his gloves with discretion
  and selected his tie with care. Then he went to the Institute, took a turn or
  two at the bars, climbed up the rope, and gave another member a lesson with
  the gloves. Thus refreshed, he dressed himself in his walking clothes, making
  sure that the tie and the gloves were safe in his pocket, and set out for
  home. There was no dressmaking class that night, so that he need not wait.
  But outside and plainly waiting for him, was Nora Sansom herself. Johnny
  thought she had been crying: as in fact she had.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. May," she said. "I'm very sorry, but&mdash;I thought you might be
  here, and&mdash;and&mdash;I'm afraid I shan't be able to come to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"Not come! But&mdash;but why?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;I'm very sorry, Mr. May; but I can't tell
  you&mdash;really."</p>

  <p>There was a quiver of the lip, and her voice was a little uneven, as
  though there were danger of more tears.</p>

  <p>But Johnny was not disappointed merely; he was also angry, and it was hard
  to conceal the fact. So he said nothing, but turned and walked a few steps by
  her side.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;hope you won't mind," she pursued, uneasy at his silence. "I'm
  very much disappointed&mdash;very much indeed." And it was plain that she
  was. "But there'll be a good many there. And you'll have plenty of partners."
  This last she found a hard thing to say.</p>

  <p>"I don't care how many'll be there," Johnny replied. "I shan't go."</p>

  <p>It was said curtly, almost angrily, but Nora Sansom heard it with an odd
  little tremor of pleasure. Though she merely said, "But why not? There's no
  reason why you should be disappointed too."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, I'm not going," he said; and after a pause added: "Perhaps you
  might ha' gone if I hadn't asked you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shouldn't!" she answered, with tears in eyes and voice. "You know I
  shouldn't! I never go anywhere!"</p>

  <p>Johnny instantly felt himself a brute. "No," he said. "I know you don't. I
  didn't mean anything unkind. But I won't go."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I'm not going without you." He might have said something more,
  but a little group of people came straggling past. And the girl, with her
  eyes on this group, said the first thing that came to her tongue.</p>

  <p>"Where will you go then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh anywhere. I don't know. Walk about, perhaps."</p>

  <p>She looked shyly up in his face, and down again. "I might go for a walk,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>Johnny's heart gave a great beat. "Alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Perhaps."</p>

  <p>But she would be questioned into nothing definite. <i>If</i> she took a
  walk, she <i>might</i> go in such and such a direction, passing this or that
  place at seven o'clock, or half-past. That was all. And now she must hurry
  away, for she had already been too long.</p>

  <p>What mattered the dance to Johnny now? A fig for the dance. Let them dance
  that liked, and let them dance the floor through if it pleased them. But how
  was it that Nora Sansom could take a walk tomorrow evening, yet could not
  come to the Institute? That was difficult to understand. Still, hang the
  dance!</p>

  <p>For Nora it would be harder to speak. Howbeit indeed the destruction of
  the looked-for evening's gladness, in her first fine frock, had been a bitter
  thing.</p>

  <p>But that day her hiding-place had been discovered, and now the dress that
  had cost such thoughtful design and such hopeful labour was lying, rolled and
  ticketed, on a pawnbroker's shelf.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT they must come to Blackwall Pier was assured. For there
  were no streets, no crowds, no rumbling waggons; there were the wide sky and
  the unresting river, the breeze, the ships, and the endless train of
  brown-sailed barges. No unseamanlike garden-seats dishonoured the quay then,
  and strolling lovers sat on bollards or chains, or sat not at all.</p>

  <p>Here came Johnny and Nora Sansom when the shrinking arc of daylight was
  far and yellow in the west, and the Kentish hills away to the left grew dusk
  and mysterious. The tide ran high, and tugs were busy. A nest of them, with
  steam up, lay under the wharf wall to the right of the pier-barge, waiting
  for work; some were already lighted, and, on the rest, men were trimming the
  lamps or running them up, while a cheerful glow came from each tiny cabin and
  engine-room. Rascal boys flitted about the quays and gangways&mdash;the boys
  that are always near boats and water, ever failing to get drowned, and ever
  dodging the pestered men who try to prevent it.</p>

  <p>The first star of the evening steadied and brightened, and soon was lost
  amid other stars. Below, the river set its constellations as silently, one
  after another, trembling and blinking; and meteor tugs shot across its
  firmament, in white and green and red. Along shore the old Artichoke Tavern,
  gables and piles, darkened and melted away, and then lit into a little Orion,
  a bright cluster in the bespangled riverside. Ever some new sail came like a
  ghost up reach out of the gloom, rounded the point, and faded away; and by
  times some distant voice was heard in measured cry over water.</p>

  <p>They said little; for what need to talk? They loitered awhile near the
  locks, and saw the turning Trinity light with its long, solemn wink, heard a
  great steamer hoot, far down Woolwich reach. Now the yellow in the sky was
  far and dull indeed, and a myriad of stars trembled over the brimming river.
  A tug puffed and sobbed, and swung out from the group under the wharf,
  beating a glistering tail of spray, and steaming off at the head of a train
  of lighters. Out from the dark of Woolwich Reach came a sailing-ship under
  bare spars, drawn by another tug. In the middle of the river the ship dropped
  anchor, and the tug fell back to wait, keeping its place under gentle
  steam.</p>

  <p>They walked on the wharf, by the iron cranes, and far to the end, under
  the windows of the abandoned Brunswick Hotel. Here they were quite alone, and
  here they sat together on a broad and flat-topped old bollard.</p>

  <p>Presently said Johnny, "Are you sorry for the dance now&mdash;Nora?" And
  lost his breath at the name.</p>

  <p>Nora&mdash;he called her Nora; was she afraid or was she glad? What was
  this before her? But with her eyes she saw only the twinkling river, with the
  lights and the stars.</p>

  <p>Presently she answered. "I was very sorry," she said slowly..."of
  course."</p>

  <p>"But now&mdash;Nora?"</p>

  <p>Still she saw but the river and the lights; but she was glad; timid, too,
  but very glad. Johnny's hand stole to her side, took hers, and kept
  it..."No," she said, "not sorry&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"Say Johnny."</p>

  <p>What was before her mattered nothing; he sat by her&mdash;held her
  hand..."Not sorry now&mdash;Johnny!"</p>

  <p>Why came tears so readily to her eyes? Truly they had long worn their
  path. But this&mdash;this was joy...He bent his head, and kissed her. The
  wise old Trinity light winked very slowly, and winked again.</p>

  <p>So they sat and talked; sometimes whispered. Vows, promises, nonsense
  all&mdash;what mattered the words to so wonderful a tune? And the eternal
  stars, a million ages away, were nearer, all nearer, than the world of common
  life about them. What was for her she knew now and saw&mdash;she also: a new
  heaven and a new earth.</p>

  <p>Over the water from the ship came, swinging and slow, a stave of the
  chanty:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I'm a flying-fish sailor straight home from
  Hong-Kong&mdash;<br>
  Aye! Aye! Blow the man down!<br>
  Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br>
  O give us some time to blow the man down!</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Ye're a dirty Black-Baller just in from New York&mdash;<br>
  Aye! Aye! Blow the man down!<br>
  Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br>
  O give us some time to blow the man down!"</p><br>

  <p>Time went, but time was not for them. Where the tug-engineer, thrusting up
  his head for a little fresh air, saw but a prentice-lad and his sweetheart on
  a bollard, there sat Man and Woman, enthroned and exultant in face of the
  worlds.</p>

  <p>The ship swung round on the tide, bringing her lights square and her stem
  for the opening lock. The chanty went wailing to its end:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br>
  To my Aye! Aye! Blow the man down!<br>
  Singapore Harbour to gay London town&mdash;<br>
  O give us some time to blow the man down!"</p><br>

  <p>The tug headed for the dock and the ship went in her wake with slow state,
  a gallant shadow amid the blue.</p>

  <p>Soon the tide stood, and stood, and then began its ebb. For a space there
  was a deeper stillness as the dim wharves hung in mid-mist, and water and sky
  were one. Then the air stirred and chilled, stars grew sharper, and the
  Thames turned its traffic seaward.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">HAPPINESS never stayed long with Nora Sansom. Little,
  indeed, had been her portion, and it was a poor sort at best. But this new
  joy was so great that it must needs be short of life; and in truth she saw
  good reason. From the moment of parting with Johnny doubts had troubled her;
  and doubts grew to distress&mdash;even to misery. She saw no end&mdash;no end
  but sorrow. She had been carried away; she had forgotten. And in measure as
  her sober senses awoke she saw that all this gladness could but end in
  heart-break and bereavement. Better, then, end all quickly and have done with
  the pang. But herein she misjudged her strength.</p>

  <p>Doubts and perplexities assailed Johnny also, though for a time they grew
  to nothing sharper. He would have gone home straightway, proud and joyful, if
  a little sheepish, to tell his mother the tale of that evening. But Nora had
  implored him to say nothing yet. She wanted time to think things over, she
  said. And she left him at the familiar corner, two streets beyond the
  Institute, begging him to come no farther, for this time, at anyrate. Next
  evening was the evening of the dressmaking class. He saw her for a few
  minutes, on her way through those two familiar streets, and he thought she
  looked unwell.</p>

  <p>A few nights later he saw her again. Plainly she had been crying. When
  they came to a deserted street of shut-up wharves he asked her why.</p>

  <p>"Only&mdash;only I've been thinking!" she said.</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"About you, Johnny&mdash;about you and me. We&mdash;I think&mdash;we're
  very young, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>That had not struck him as a difficulty. "Well," he said, "I don't know
  about that. I s'pose we are, like others. But I shall be out o' my time in
  two years and a half, or not much more, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, then," she said, catching at the word, "p'raps then it will be
  different&mdash;and&mdash;I mean we shall be older and know better, Johnny.
  And&mdash;now&mdash;we can often see one another and talk like
  friends&mdash;and&mdash;" She looked up to read his eyes, trembling.</p>

  <p>Something cold took Johnny by the throat, and checked his voice.
  "But&mdash;what&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, though it was bitter hard. "It'll be best&mdash;I'm sure,
  Johnny!"</p>

  <p>Johnny gulped, and his voice hardened. "Oh!" he said, "if you want to
  throw me over you might say so, in straight English!"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;don't talk like that, Johnny!" she pleaded, and laid her hand on
  his arm. "It's unkind! You know it's unkind!"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's only plain an' honest. I don't understand this
  half-and-half business&mdash;seeing each other 'like friends' an' all
  that."</p>

  <p>One more effort she made to hold her position&mdash;but her strength was
  near gone. "It'll be better, Johnny&mdash;truly it will! You&mdash;you might
  meet someone you'd like better, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's my look-out; time to talk about that when it comes. The other
  night you let me kiss you, and you kissed me back&mdash;told me you loved me.
  Now you don't. Maybe <i>you've</i> met someone you like better."</p>

  <p>She held out no more. Her head fell on his shoulder, and she broke into an
  agony of tears. "O Johnny, Johnny, that is cruel! You don't know how cruel it
  is! I shall never like anybody better than you&mdash;never half so much.
  Don't be unkind! I've not one friend in the world but you, and I <i>do</i>
  love you more than anything."</p>

  <p>With that Johnny was ready to kick himself for a ruffian. He looked about,
  but nobody else was in the shadowy street. He kissed Nora, he called himself
  hard names, and he quieted her, though she still sobbed. And there was no
  more talk of mere friendship. She had tried her compromise, and had broken
  down. But presently Johnny ventured to ask if she foresaw any difficulty with
  her parents.</p>

  <p>"Father's dead," she said simply. "He's been dead for years." This was the
  first word of her family matters that Johnny had heard. Should he come to see
  her mother? The question struck her like a blow.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, Johnny," she said. "Not yet&mdash;no, you mustn't. I can't
  tell you why&mdash;I can't really; at any-rate not now." Then after a pause,
  "O Johnny, I'm in such trouble! Such trouble, Johnny!" And she wept
  again.</p>

  <p>But tell her trouble she would not. At anyrate not then. And in the end
  she left Johnny much mystified, and near as miserable as herself, because of
  his blind helplessness in this unrevealed affliction.</p>

  <p>Inexpert in mysteries, he was all incomprehension. What was this trouble
  that he must not be told of? He did not even know where Nora lived. Why
  shouldn't she tell him? Why did she never let him see her as far as home?
  This much he knew: that she had a mother, but had lost her father by death.
  And this he had but just learned from her under stress of tears. He was not
  to see her mother&mdash;at least not yet. And Nora was in sore trouble, but
  refused to say what the trouble was. That night he moped and brooded. And at
  Maidment and Hurst's next morning&mdash;it was Saturday&mdash;Mr. Cottam the
  gaffer swore, and made remarks about the expedience of being thoroughly awake
  before dinnertime. More, at one o'clock Johnny passed the pay-box without
  taking his money, and turned back for it, when reminded, amid the chaff of
  his shopmates, many offers of portership, and some suggestions to scramble
  the slighted cash.</p>

  <p>Not far from the yard-gate he saw a small crowd of people about a
  public-house; and as he neared he perceived Mother Born-drunk in the midst of
  it. The publican had refused to serve her&mdash;indeed, had turned her
  out&mdash;and now she swayed about his door and proclaimed him at large.</p>

  <p>"'Shultin' a lady!" she screamed hoarsely. "Can't go in plashe 'thout
  bein' 'shulted. 'Shulted by low common public-'oush. I won't 'ave it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you stand it, ducky!" sang out a boy. "You give 'em what for!"</p>

  <p>For a moment she seemed inclined to turn her wrath on her natural enemy,
  the boy, but her eye fell on a black bottle with a broken neck, lying in the
  gutter. "Gi' 'em what for?" she hiccupped, stooping for the bottle, "Yesh,
  I'll gi' 'em what for!" and with that flung the bottle at the largest window
  in sight.</p>

  <p>There was a crash, a black hole in the midst of the plate glass, and a
  vast "spider" of cracks to its farthest corners. Mother Born-drunk stood and
  stared, perhaps a little sobered. Then a barman ran out, tucking in his
  apron, and took her by the arm. There were yells and screams and struggles,
  and cheers from blackguard boys; and Mother Born-drunk was hauled off,
  screaming and sliding and stumbling, between a policeman and the
  publican.</p>

  <p>Johnny told his mother, when he reached home, that her old acquaintance
  Emma Pacey was like to endure a spell of gaol. But what occupied his mind was
  Nora's trouble, and he forgot Mother Born-drunk for three or four days.</p>

  <p>Then came the next evening of the dressmaking class at the Institute, and
  he went, never doubting to meet Nora as she came away. At the door the
  housekeeper, who was also hall-porter, beckoned, and gave him a letter, left
  earlier in the day. It was addressed to him by name, in a weak and straggling
  female hand, and for a moment he stared at it, not a little surprised. When
  he tore open the envelope he found a blotchy, tear-stained rag of a letter,
  and read this:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Johnny</span>,&mdash;It is
  all over now and I do hope you will forgive me for not telling you before.
  This is to say good-bye and God bless you and pray forget all about me. It
  was wrong of me to let it go so far but I did love you so Johnny, and I could
  not help it and then I didn't know what to do. I can never come to the
  classes again with all this disgrace and everything printed in the newspapers
  and I must get work somewhere where they don't know me. I would rather die,
  but I must look after her as well as I can, Johnny, because she is my mother.
  Burn this at once and forget all about me and some day you will meet some
  nice girl belonging to a respectable family and nothing to be ashamed of.
  Don't try to find me&mdash;that will only make us both miserable. Good-bye
  and please forgive me.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Yours affectionately,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Nora Sansom</span>."</p><br>

  <p>What was this? What did it all mean? He stood in the gymnasium
  dressing-room to read it, and when he looked up, the gaslight danced and the
  lockers spun about him. The one clear thing was that Nora said good-bye, and
  was gone.</p>

  <p>Presently his faculties assorted themselves, and he read the letter again;
  and then once more. It was "all over" and she asked him to forgive her for
  not telling him before. Telling him what? She told him nothing now. She would
  never come to the Institute again, and he didn't know her address, and he
  mustn't try to find her. But then there was "everything printed in the
  newspapers." Of course, he must look at the newspapers; why so long realising
  that? He went to the reading-room and applied himself to the pile of papers
  and magazines that littered the table. One paper after another he searched
  and searched again, but saw nothing that he could connect with Nora, by any
  stretch of imagination. Till he found a stray sheet of the day before, with
  rings of coffee-stain on it. The "police intelligence" lay uppermost, and in
  the midst of the column the name <i>Emma Sansom,</i> in italic letters,
  caught his eye. She was forty-one, and was charged with drunkenness and
  wilful damage. A sentence more, and everything stood displayed, as by a flash
  of lightning; for he had witnessed the offence himself, on Saturday. Emma
  Sansom was the married name of Emma Pacey, whom the boys called Mother
  Born-drunk; and the woman was Nora's mother!</p>

  <p>Now it was plain&mdash;all, from the very beginning, when the child
  wandered in the night seeking her strayed and drunken mother, and inquired
  for her with the shamed excuse that she was ill. This was why he was not to
  call to see Nora's mother; and it was for this that Nora hindered him from
  seeing her home.</p>

  <p>There was the shameful report, all at length. The publican's tale was
  simple and plain enough. He had declined to serve the prisoner because she
  was drunk, and as she refused to leave, he had her turned out, though, he
  said, she made no particular resistance. Shortly afterward he heard a crash,
  and found a broken bottle and a great deal of broken glass in the bar. He had
  gone outside, and saw the prisoner being held by his barman. His plate-glass
  window was smashed, and it was worth ten pounds. There was little more
  evidence. The police told his worship that the prisoner had been fined small
  sums for drunkenness before, but she was usually inoffensive, except for
  collecting crowds of boys. This was the first charge against her involving
  damage.</p>

  <p>She was the widow of a ship's officer lost at sea, and she had a small
  annuity, but was chiefly supported of late by her daughter&mdash;a
  dressmaker&mdash;a very respectable young woman. The daughter was present
  (the reporter called her "a prepossessing young female in great distress"),
  and she wished to be allowed to pay the damage in small instalments. But in
  the end her mother was sent to prison for a month in default of payment of
  fine and damage. For indeed the daughter was a minor, and her undertaking was
  worthless.</p>

  <p>One thing Johnny looked for eagerly, but did not find&mdash;the prisoner's
  address. Whether consideration for the daughter had prompted the reporter to
  that suppression, or whether it was due to accident, Johnny could not guess.
  In other reports in the same column some addresses were given and some not.
  But straightway Johnny went to beg the housekeeper that he might rummage the
  store of old papers for those of the day before. For to desert Nora now, in
  her trouble, was a thing wholly inconceivable; and so far from burning the
  letter, he put it, envelope and all, in his safest pocket, and felt there,
  more than once, to be assured of its safety.</p>

  <p>But the address was in none of the papers. In fact the report was in no
  more than three, and in one of those it was but five lines long. What should
  he do? He could not even write her one line of comfort. And he had been going
  on with his work placidly all Monday while Nora had been standing up in a
  police-court, weeping and imploring mercy for her wretched mother! If he had
  known he could scarce have done anything to aid her. But helplessness was no
  consolation&mdash;rather the cruellest of aggravations.</p>

  <p>Well, there stood the matter, and raving would not help it, nor would
  beating the table&mdash;nor even the head&mdash;with the fist. He must
  somehow devise a way to reach Nora.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">HE resolved, first, to try the Institute. Nora's name and
  address must be on the class registers; but what business had he with the
  girl's class registers? As diplomatist his failure was lamentable. He could
  invent no reasonable excuses, and ignoble defeat was his fate at the hands of
  the rigid lady who managed the girls department of the Institute. Then he
  took to prowling about all the streets that lay beyond that second corner
  that had marked the end of their evening walks, watching for her; searching
  also, desperately, for some impossible sign about a house that might suggest
  that she lived in it. Thus he spent the daylight of two evenings watching a
  little muslin-hung window, because the muslin was tied with a ribbon of a
  sort he remembered her to have worn, and because he chose to fancy a neatness
  and a daintiness about the tying that might well be hers. But on the second
  evening as dusk fell the window opened, and a hairy, red-bearded matt in blue
  shirt sleeves put out his head and leaned on the sill to smoke his pipe and
  watch the red sky. Johnny swung away savagely, and called himself a fool for
  his pains; and indeed, he could ill afford to waste time, for Maid-ment and
  Hurst claimed him till five each day, and a few hours in the evening were all
  that remained; more, Nora would change her lodgings&mdash;perhaps had done so
  already.</p>

  <p>After this he screwed his courage so high as to go to the police-station
  where the charge against Nora's mother must have been taken, and to ask for
  her address. But the cast-iron-faced inspector in charge took <i>his</i> name
  and address instead, as a beginning, and then would tell him nothing. And at
  last, maddened and reckless, he went to the publican, and demanded the
  information of him. Now if Johnny had had a little more worldly experience, a
  little more cunning, and a great deal more coolness, he would have done this
  at first, and, beginning by ordering a drink, he would have opened a casual
  conversation, led it to the matter of the window, and in the end would have
  gained his point quietly and easily. But as it was, he did none of these
  things. He ordered no drink, and he made a blunt request, taking little
  thought of its manner, none of the publican's point of view, and perhaps
  forgetting that the man was in no way responsible for the rebuffs already
  endured. The publican, for his part, was already in a bad temper, because of
  the clumsy tapping of a barrel and ensuing "cheek" of the potman. So he
  answered Johnny's demand by asking if he had come to pay for the window; and
  receiving the negative reply he had expected, he urgently recommended the
  intruder's departure "outside": in such terms as gave no choice but
  compliance.</p>

  <p>So that now, in extremity, Johnny resolved on a last expedient: one that
  had been vaguely in his mind for a day or two, though he had yet scarce had
  courage to consider it seriously. This was, to tell his mother the whole
  thing; and to induce her, if he might, to ask the address at the
  Institute&mdash;perhaps on some pretext of dressmaking business. He was not
  hopeful, for he well knew that any hint of traffic with the family of one
  such as Nora's mother would be a horror to her. But he could see nothing
  else, and to sit still were intolerable. Moreover he guessed that his mother
  must suspect something from his preoccupation, and his neglect of his
  drawing. Though indeed poor Nan was most at pains, just then, to conceal
  troubles of her own.</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson, in fact, began to chafe under the restraints of narrow
  circumstances. Not that he was poorer than had been his habit&mdash;indeed he
  was much better off&mdash;but that his needs had expanded with his prosperity
  and with his successes in society. And it was just now that his wife began to
  attempt retrenchment. Probably she was encouraged by the outrageous revolt of
  her son, a revolt which had made advisable a certain degree of caution on the
  part of himself, the head of the household. She spoke of a rumour that the
  ship-yard opposite might close, as so many other Thames ship-yards had closed
  of late years. That, she said, would mean ruin for the shop, and she must try
  to save what little she might, meantime. An absurdity, of course, in Mr.
  Butson's view. He felt no interest in the rumours of old women about
  ship-yards, and petty measurement of the sordid chances of trade irritated
  him. If his wife found one source of profit running dry, she must look out
  and tap another, that was all. So long as he got what he wanted he troubled
  little about the manner of its getting. But now he ran near having less than
  he wanted, and his wife was growing even less accommodating. She went so far
  as to hint of withholding the paltry sum the lad earned; he should have it
  himself, she thought, to buy his clothes, and to save toward the end of his
  apprenticeship. More than this, Mr. Butson much suspected that Johnny had
  actually had his own money for some while past, and that Mrs. Butson had
  descended to the mean subterfuge of representing as his earnings a sum which
  in reality she extracted each week from the till; an act of pure
  embezzlement. And then there was the cottage in Epping Forest. She wouldn't
  sell it now, though she wanted to sell when she first left it. What good was
  there in keeping it? True there was threeand-sixpence a week of rent, but
  that was nothing; it would go in a round of drinks, or in half a round, in
  any distinguished bar; and there were deductions even from the
  three-and-sixpence. Sold, the cottage might produce a respectable
  sum&mdash;perhaps a hundred pounds&mdash;at anyrate eighty. The figures
  stirred his blood. What a magnificent dash a man might cut with eighty
  pounds! And a fortune might be made out of it, too, if it were used wisely,
  and not buried away in a wretched three-and-sixpenny cottage. Properly
  invested on judicious flat-race Certainties, it would double itself about
  twice a week. So he made it very plain to Nan that the sale of the cottage
  for what it would fetch and the handing over of the proceeds was a plan he
  insisted on. But the stupid woman wouldn't see it. It was plain that she was
  beginning to over-estimate her importance in the establishment, by reason
  that of late she had not been sufficiently sworn at, shoved, thumped, and
  twisted and pinched on the arms. That was the worst of kindness to a
  woman&mdash;she took advantage.</p>

  <p>So that he was obliged to begin to thump again. There was no need to do it
  so that Johnny might know, and so cause a low disturbance. In fact, Johnny
  took little notice of things at home just now, no longer made inquiries, nor
  lifted the poker with so impudent a stare; and he was scarce indoors at all.
  Wherefore Mr. Butson punched and ruffianed&mdash;being careful to leave no
  disreputable marks in visible spots, such as black eyes&mdash;and sometimes
  he kicked; and he demanded more money and more, but all the while insisted on
  the sale of the cottage. The monstrous laws of conveyance made it impossible
  for him to lay hands on the deeds and sell the place himself, or he would
  have done it, of course. And he made it advisable, too, for Bessy to avoid
  him&mdash;and that had a better effect than any direct attack on Nan. Till at
  last the woman was so far reduced that she was near a very dangerous
  rebellion indeed&mdash;nearer than Mr. Butson suspected. For she began to
  think of attempting a separation by magistrate's order, shameful as it would
  be in the neighbourhood. Though she feared greatly.</p>

  <p>So it was when Johnny turned toward home on an evening a little before
  nine o'clock, sick of blind searching, and ready to tell his mother the story
  of Nora Sansom, first to last. At Harbour Lane corner he saw Butson walking
  off, and wondered to see him about Blackwall so early in the evening.</p>

  <p>Nobody was in the shop, and Johnny went through so quietly that he
  surprised his mother and Bessy, in the shop-parlour, crying bitterly. Nan sat
  on a chair and Bessy bent over her, and no concealment was possible. Johnny
  was seized by a dire surmise. "Mother! What's this?" he said. "What's he been
  doing?"</p>

  <p>Nan bent lower, but answered nothing. Johnny looked toward Bessy, almost
  sternly. "He&mdash;he's beaten mother again," Bessy blurted, between
  sobs.</p>

  <p>"Beaten mother! Again!" Johnny's face was white, and his nostrils stood
  wide and round. "Beaten mother! Again!"</p>

  <p>"He's always doing it now," Bessy sobbed. "And wanting more money. I'd a
  good mind to tell you before, but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Beaten mother!" The room swam before Johnny's eyes. "Why&mdash;" rose to
  close the door. "No, Johnny," she said meekly. "Pm a bit upset, but don't let
  it upset you. Don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with your leg? You're limping!"</p>

  <p>"He kicked her! I saw him kick at her ankle!" Bessy burst out, pouring
  forth the tale unrestrained. "I tried to stop him and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then he hit you?" asked Johnny, not so white in the cheeks now, but
  whiter than ever about the mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but it was mother most!" and Bessy wept afresh.</p>

  <p>Perhaps his evenings of disappointment had chastened Johnny's impatience.
  He knew that the man was out of reach now, and he forced his fury down. In
  ten minutes he knew the whole thing, between Bessy's outpourings and Nan's
  tearful admissions.</p>

  <p>"When is he coming back?"</p>

  <p>They did not know&mdash;probably he would be late, as usual. "But don't go
  doing anything hasty, Johnny," Nan implored; "I'm so afraid of you doing
  something rash! It's not much, really&mdash;I'm a bit upset, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll have to think about this," Johnny said, with such calmness that Nan
  felt somewhat reassured, though Bessy was inwardly afraid. "I'm going out for
  an hour."</p>

  <p>He strode away to the Institute, walking by instinct, and seeing nothing
  till he was under the lettered lamp. He went to the dressing-room and hurried
  into his flannels. In the gymnasium the instructor, a brawny sergeant of
  grenadiers, was watching some lads on the horizontal bar. Johnny approached
  him with a hesitating request for a "free spar."</p>

  <p>"Free spar, my lad?" said the sergeant. "What's up? Gettin' cheeky? Want
  to give me a hidin'?"</p>

  <p>"No, sergeant," Johnny answered. "Not such a fool as that. But I never had
  a free spar with a man much heavier than myself, and&mdash;and I just want to
  try, that's all!"</p>

  <p>There was a comprehending twinkle about the sergeant's eyes. "Right," he
  said; "you're givin' me near two stone&mdash;that's if you're a bit over
  eleven. Fetch the gloves."</p>

  <p>At another time Johnny would never have conceived the impudence of asking
  the sergeant&mdash;once champion of the army&mdash;for a free spar. Even a
  "light" spar with the sergeant was something of an undertaking, wherein one
  was apt to have both hands full, and a bit over. But the lad had his reasons
  now.</p>

  <p>He dashed at the professor with a straight lead, and soon the blows were
  going like hail on a window-pane. The sergeant stood like a rock, and
  Johnny's every rush was beaten back as by hammer-blows on the head. But he
  came again fresh and eager, and buzzed his master merrily about the head,
  getting in a very respectable number of straight drives, such as would knock
  an ordinary man down, though the sergeant never winked; and bringing off one
  on the "mark" that <i>did</i> knock out a grunt, much as a punch in that
  region will knock one out of a squeaking doll.</p>

  <p>"Steady," the sergeant called after two long rounds had been sparred.
  "You'll get stiff if you keep on at that rate, my lad, and <i>that's</i> not
  what you want, I reckon!" This last with a grin. "You haven't been boxin'
  regular you know, just lately."</p>

  <p>"But you're all right," he added, as they walked aside. "Your work keeps
  you in good condition. Not quite so quick as you would ha' been if you'd been
  sparrin' every evening, o'course. But quick enough for your job, I expect."
  And again Johnny saw the cunning twinkle.</p>

  <p>It was about closing time, and when Johnny had changed his clothes, he
  found the sergeant leaving also. He thanked him and bade him good-night.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, May," the sergeant called, and turned into the street. But he
  swung back along the footpath after Johnny, and asked, "Is it to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"What, sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I ain't a sergeant&mdash;I'm a stranger. There's a sergeant goes to
  <i>that</i> moral establishment p'raps," with a nod at the Institute, "but he
  behaves strictly proper. I'm just a chap out in the street that would like to
  see the fight, that's all. When is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know that myself," Johnny answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;like that, is it? Hum." The sergeant was thoughtful for a
  moment&mdash;perhaps incredulous. Then he said, "Well, can't be helped, I
  suppose. Anyway, keep your left goin' strong, but don't lead quite so
  reckless, with your head up an' no guard. You're good enough. An' the bigger
  he is, the more to hit!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. BUTSON was perhaps a shade relieved when he returned
  home that night and found all quiet, and Johnny in bed. He had half expected
  that his inopportune return might have caused trouble. But the night after,
  as he came from the railway station, a little earlier than usual, Johnny
  stopped him in the street.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you," he said. "Just come round by the dock wall."</p>

  <p>His manner was quiet and businesslike, but Mr. Butson wondered. "Why?" he
  asked. "Can't you tell me here?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't. There are too many people about. It's money in your pocket
  if you come."</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson went. What it meant he could not imagine, but Johnny usually
  told the truth, and he said it would be money in his pocket&mdash;a desirable
  disposition of the article. The dock wall was just round a corner. A tall,
  raking wall at one side of a sparsely lit road that was empty at night, and a
  lower wall at the other; the road reached by a flight of steps rising from
  the street, and a gateway in the low wall.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it now?" Mr. Butson asked, suspiciously, as Johnny stopped
  under a gas-lamp and looked right and left along the deserted road.</p>

  <p>"Only just this," Johnny replied, with simple distinctness. "You wanted
  mother to give you my money every week, though in fact she's been letting me
  keep it. Well, here's my last week's money"&mdash;he shook it in his
  hand&mdash;"and I'll give it you if you'll stand up here and fight me."</p>

  <p>"What? Fight you? You?" Mr. Butson laughed; but he felt a secret
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, me. You'd rather fight a woman, no doubt, or a lame girl. But Pm
  going to give you a change, and make you fight me&mdash;here." Johnny flung
  his jacket on the ground and his hat on it.</p>

  <p>"Don't be such a young fool," quoth Mr. Butson loftily. "Put on your
  jacket an' come home."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;presently," Johnny replied grimly. "Presently I'll go home, and
  take you with me. Come, you're ready enough to punch my mother, without being
  asked; or my sister. Come and punch me, and take pay for it!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson was a little uncomfortable. "I suppose," he sneered, "you've
  got a knife or a poker or somethin' about you like what you threatened me
  with before!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't even brought a stick. You're the sort o' coward I expected,
  though you're bigger than me and heavier. Come&mdash;" he struck the man a
  heavy smack on the mouth. "Now fight!"</p>

  <p>Butson snarled, and cut at the lad's head with the handle of his walking
  stick. But Johnny's arm straightened like a flash, and Butson rolled
  over.</p>

  <p>"What I thought you'd do," remarked Johnny, seizing his wrist and twisting
  the stick away. "Now get up. Come on!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Butson sat and gasped. He fingered his nose gently, and found it very
  tender, and bleeding. He seemed to have met a thunderbolt in the dark. He
  turned slowly over on his knees, and so got on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Hit me&mdash;come, hit me!" called Johnny, sparring at him. "Fancy I'm
  only my mother, you cur! Come, I'm hitting you&mdash;see! So!" He seized the
  man by the ear, twisted it, and rapped him about the face. The treatment
  would have roused a sheep. Butson sprang at Johnny, grappled with him, and
  for a moment bore him back. Johnny asked nothing better. He broke ground,
  checked the rush with half-arm hits, and stopped it with a quick double left,
  flush in the face.</p>

  <p>It was mere slaughter; Johnny was too hard, too scientific, too full of
  cool hatred. The wretched Butson, bigger and heavier as he might be, was
  flaccid from soft living, and science he had none. But he fought like a rat
  in a corner&mdash;reeking nothing of rule, but kicking, biting, striking,
  wrestling madly; though to small purpose: for his enemy, deadly calm and
  deadly quick, saw every movement ere it was made, and battered with savage
  precision.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you've had enough," said Johnny, as Butson staggered, and leaned
  against the wall, "you can stop it, you know, by calling the p'lice. You like
  the p'lice. There's always one of 'em in the next street, an' you've only to
  shout. I shall hammer you till ye do!"</p>

  <p>And he hammered. A blow on the ear drove Butson's head against the wall,
  and a swing from the other fist brought it away again. He flung himself on
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" cried Johnny. "Get up. What, you won't? All right, you went down
  by yourself, you know&mdash;so's to be let alone. But I'm coming down too!"
  and with that he lay beside Butson and struck once more and struck again.</p>

  <p>"Chuck it!" groaned Butson. "I'm done! Oh! leave me alone!"</p>

  <p>"Leave you alone?" answered Johnny, rising and reaching for his jacket.
  "Not I. You didn't leave my mother alone as soon as she asked you, did you?
  I'll never pass you again without clouting your head. Come home!"</p>

  <p>He hauled the bruised wretch up by the collar, crammed his hat on his head
  and cut him across the calves with his own walking stick. "Go on! March!"</p>

  <p>"Can't you leave me alone now?" whined Butson. "You done enough, ain't
  ye?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not near enough. An' you'll have a lot more if you don't do as I
  tell you. I said I'd take you home, an' I will. Go on!"</p>

  <p>Two or three dark streets led to Harbour Lane, but they wer; short. It was
  past closing time, and when they reached the shop the lights were turned down
  and the door shut. Nan opened to Johnny's knock, and he thrust Butson in
  before him. "Here he is," said Johnny, "not thrashed half enough!"</p>

  <p>Dusty and bleeding, his face nigh unrecognisable under cuts and bruises,
  Butson sat on a box, a figure of shame. Nan screamed and ran to him.</p>

  <p>"I did it where the neighbours wouldn't hear," Johnny explained, "and if
  he'd been a man he'd have drowned himself rather than come here, after the
  way I've treated him. He's a poor cur, an' I'll buy a whip for him. There's
  the money I promised you," he went on, putting it on the box. "It's the first
  you've earned for years, and the last you'll have here, if I can manage
  it!"</p>

  <p>But Nan was crying over that dishonourable head, and wiping it with her
  handkerchief.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

  <p class="first">"WHY what's that?" said Long Hicks on the way to work in the
  morning. "Got cuts all over yer hands!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Johnny answered laconically. "Fighting."</p>

  <p>"Fightin'!" Long Hicks looked mighty reproachful. "Jest you be careful
  what company you're gettin' into," he said severely. "You're neglectin' yer
  drawin' and everything lately, an' now&mdash;fightin'!"</p>

  <p>"I ain't ashamed of it," Johnny replied gloomily. "An' I've got other
  things to think about now, besides drawing."</p>

  <p>Hicks stared, stuttered a little, and rubbed his cap over his head. He
  wondered whether or not he ought to ask questions.</p>

  <p>They went a little way in silence, and then Johnny said: "It's him;
  Butson."</p>

  <p>"No!" exclaimed Hicks, checking in his stride, and staring at Johnny
  again. "What! Bin fightin' Butson?"</p>

  <p>Johnny poured out the whole story; and as he told Hicks's eyes widened,
  his face flushed and paled, his hands opened and closed convulsively, and
  again and again he blew and stuttered incomprehensibly.</p>

  <p>"Job is, to drive the brute away," Johnny concluded wearily. "He'll stop
  as long as he's fed. An' mother thinks it's a disgrace to get a
  separation&mdash;goin' before a magistrate an' all. I'm only tellin' you
  because I know you won't jaw about it among the neighbours."</p>

  <p>That day Long Hicks got leave of absence for the rest of the week,
  mightily astonishing Mr. Cottam by the application, for Hicks had never been
  known to take a holiday before.</p>

  <p>"'Awright," the gaffer growled, "seein' as we're slack. There's one or two
  standin' auf for a bit a'ready. But what's up with <i>you</i> wantin' time
  auf? Gittin' frisky? Runnin' arter the gals?"</p>

  <p>And indeed Long Hicks spent his holiday much like a man who is running
  after something, or somebody. He took a walking tour of intricate plan,
  winding and turning among the small streets, up street and down, but tending
  northward; through Bromley, Bow and Old Ford, and so toward Homerton and the
  marshes.</p>

  <p>Meantime Johnny walked to and from his work alone, and brooded. He could
  not altogether understand his mother's attitude toward Butson. She had been
  willing, even anxious, to get rid of him by any process that would involve no
  disgrace among the neighbours, and no peril to the trade of the shop; he had
  made her life miserable; yet now she tended the brute's cuts and bumps as
  though he didn't deserve them, and she cried more than ever. As for Johnny
  himself, he spared Butson nothing. Rather he drew a hideous solace from any
  torture wherewith he might afflict him.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to clear out?" he would say. "You'd rather be kept
  than work, but you don't like being thrashed, do you? Thrashed by a boy, eh?
  You'll enjoy work a deal better than the life I'll lead you here, I can tell
  you. I'll make you glad to drown yourself, mean funk as you are, before I'm
  done with you! Don't be too careful with that eye: the sooner it's well, the
  sooner I'll bung it up again!"</p>

  <p>Bessy marvelled at this development of morose savagery on her brother's
  part. With her, though he spoke little, he was kinder than ever, but it was
  his pastime to bully Butson: who skulked miserably in the house, being in no
  fit state for public exhibition.</p>

  <p>As to his search for Nora Sansom, Johnny was vaguely surprised to find
  himself almost indifferent. It would have been useless to worry his mother
  about it now, and though he spent an hour or two in aimless tramping about
  the streets, it was with the uppermost feeling that he should rather be at
  home, bullying Butson. He had no notion why, being little given to
  introspection; and he was as it were unconscious of his inner conviction that
  after all Nora could not be entirely lost. While Butson's punishment was the
  immediate concern, and as the thing stood, the creature seemed scarce to have
  been punished at all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">LONG HICKS'S holiday had lasted three days, and Mr. Butson's
  minor bruises were turning green. It was at the stroke of five in the
  afternoon, and Bessy was minding shop. From the ship-yard opposite a score or
  so of men came, in dirty dungaree (for it was Friday), vanguard of the
  tramping hundreds that issued each day, regular as the clock before the
  timekeeper's box. Bessy rose on her crutch, and peeped between a cheese and a
  packet of candles, out of window. Friday was not a day when many men came in
  on their way home, because by that time the week's money was run low, and
  luxuries were barred. Bessy scarce expected a customer, and it would seem
  that none was coming.</p>

  <p>Peeping so, she grew aware of a stout red-faced woman approaching at a
  rapid scuttle; and then, almost as the woman reached the door, she saw Hicks
  at her heels, his face a long figure of dismay.</p>

  <p>The woman burst into the shop with a rasping shriek. "I want my 'usband!"
  she screamed. "Where's my 'us-band?"</p>

  <p>"Come away!" called Hicks, deadly pale, and nervously snatching at her
  shoulder. "Come away! You know what you promised!"</p>

  <p>"Take yer 'and auf me, ye long fool! Where's my 'usband? Is it you what's
  got 'im?" She turned on Bessy and bawled the words in her face.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no it ain't!" cried Hicks, near beside himself. "Come away,
  an'&mdash;an' we'll talk about it outside!"</p>

  <p>"Talk! O yus, I'll give 'im talk!" The woman's every syllable was a harsh
  yell, racking to the brain, and already it had drawn a group about the door.
  "I'll give 'im talk, an' 'er too! Would anyone believe," she went on, turning
  toward the door and haranguing the crowd, that grew at every word, "as 'ow a
  woman calling 'er-self respectable, an' keepin' a shop like any lady, kid
  take away a respectable woman's 'usband&mdash;a lazy good-for-nothin'
  scoundril as run away an' left me thirteen year ago last Whitsun!"</p>

  <p>Boys sprang from everywhere, and pelted in to swell the crowd, drawn by
  the increasing screams. Many of the men, who knew the shop so well, stopped
  to learn what the trouble was; and soon every window in Harbour Lane
  displayed a woman's head, or two.</p>

  <p>"My 'usband! Where's my 'usband? Show me the woman as took my
  'usband!"</p>

  <p>Nan came and stood in the back parlour doorway, frightened but
  uncomprehending. The woman turned. "You! You is it?" she shrieked,
  oversetting a pile of tins and boxes, and clawing the air above her. "Gimme
  back my 'usband, you shameless creechor! Where 'a' ye got 'im? Where's my
  'usband?"</p>

  <p>Hicks put his arm about the woman's waist and swung her back. He was angry
  now. "Get out!" he said, "I didn't bring you to make a row like that! You
  swore you wouldn't!"</p>

  <p>Finding his arm too strong for her, the woman turned on Hicks and set to
  clawing at his face, never ceasing to scream for her husband. And then Johnny
  came pushing in at the door, having run from the far street-corner at sight
  of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Hicks, as well as he could for dodging and catching at the woman's wrists,
  made violent facial signals to Johnny, who stared, understanding none of
  them. But he heard the woman's howls for her husband, and he caught at her
  arm. "Who is your husband?" he said. "What's his name?"</p>

  <p>"What's 'is name? Why Butson&mdash;'enery Butson's 'is name! Gimme my
  'usband! My 'usband! Let me go, you villain!"</p>

  <p>It was like an unexpected blow on the head to Johnny, but, save for a
  moment, it stunned not at all&mdash;rather roused him. "I'll fetch him!" he
  cried, and sprang into the house.</p>

  <p>Here was release&mdash;the man had another wife! He would drag the wretch
  down to her, and then give him to the police. No wonder he feared the police!
  The load was lifted at last&mdash;Butson's punishment was come indeed!
  Fiercely glad, and thinking of nothing but this, Johnny swung into each room
  in turn.</p>

  <p>But there was no Butson. His pipe lay broken on the front bedroom fender,
  and his coat hung behind the door; but there was no other sign.</p>

  <p>Johnny dashed into the back yard. That, too, was empty. But in the yard
  behind, the old lighterman, paint-pot in one hand and brush in the other,
  just as he had broken off in the touching up of his mast, stood, and blinked,
  and stared, with his mouth open. His house-doors, back and front, stood wide,
  because of wet paint, and one could see through to the next street. It was by
  those doorways that Mr. Butson had vanished a minute ago, after scrambling
  over the wall, hatless, and in his shirt sleeves. And the old lighterman
  thought it a great liberty, and told Johnny so, with some dignity.</p>

  <p>Johnny rushed back to the shop. "Gone!" he cried. "Bolted out at the
  back!"</p>

  <p>He might have offered chase, but his mother lay in a swoon, and Bessy hung
  over her, hysterical. "Shove that woman out," he said, and he and Hicks,
  between them, thrust the bawling termagant into the street and closed the
  door.</p>

  <p>Without, she raged still, and grew hoarser, till a policeman came to quiet
  her; and in the end she marched off with him, talking at a loud scream all
  the way. And Harbour Lane flamed with the news of Nan's shameless bigamy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">LONG HICKS raved and tore at his hair, striding about the
  shop, and cursing himself with whatever words he could find. Johnny was
  excited still, but he grew thoughtful. There was more in this business, he
  saw now, than the mere happy riddance of Butson. What of the future? His
  mother was prostrated, and lay moaning on her bed. No one was there to tend
  her but Bessy, and there was no likelihood of help; they had no intimacy with
  neighbours, and indeed the stark morality of Harbour Lane womankind would
  have cut it off if they had. For already poor Nan was tried and condemned (as
  was the expeditious manner of Harbour Lane in such a matter), and no woman
  could dare so much as brush skirts with her.</p>

  <p>"It's my fault&mdash;all of it!" said the unhappy Hicks. "I shouldn't 'a'
  bin such a fool! But how was I to know she'd go on like that, after what
  she'd agreed to? Oh, damme, I shouldn't 'a' meddled!"</p>

  <p>Johnny calmed him as well as he might, pulled him into a chair in the shop
  parlour, and sought to know the meaning of his self-reproaches. "Why not
  meddle?"</p>

  <p>Johnny asked. "When you found her kicking up that row&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I didn't, I didn't!" protested Hicks, rolling his head
  despairingly and punching his thigh. "I brought her here! It's all my fault!
  I thought I was doin' somethin' clever, an' I was silly fool! O, I'd like to
  shoot meself!"</p>

  <p>"Brought her here? Well, tell us about it&mdash;no good punching yourself.
  When did you find out he was married?"</p>

  <p>"Knew it years ago; didn't know the woman was alive, though. Thought she
  must 'a' bin dead when you told me he'd married your mother."</p>

  <p>Some light broke on Johnny. "And you took these days off to look for
  her&mdash;was that it?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. An' I was a fool&mdash;made things wuss instead o'
  better!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that&mdash;anything's better than having that brute
  here. What changed your mind about her being dead?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dunno. I'll tell you all there is to it. Long time ago when I was
  workin' at Bishop's an' lodgin' in Lime'us, my lan'lady she knew Butson an'
  'is wife too, an' she told me they led a pretty cat an' dog life, an' one day
  Butson hops the twig. Well his missus wasn't sorry to lose 'im, an' she sets
  to washin' an' ironin' to keep 'erself an' the kid. But when Butson gets out
  of a job ('e was never in one long) 'e goes snivellin' round to 'er, an'
  wants to go back, an' be kep'. Well the missis makes it pretty 'ot for 'im,
  you may guess; but she stands 'im for a week or two, givin' it 'im pretty
  thick all the time, till Butson 'e cuts away again, an' never comes back. His
  missis never bothered about 'im&mdash;said she was well quit. This was all
  before I went to live at Lime'us, but she used to be pals with my lan'lady. I
  kep' a bottle o' whisky then, case of a friend comin', an' them two give it
  what for, between 'em, on the quiet."</p>

  <p>"And did you know her then&mdash;his wife?"</p>

  <p>"On'y by sight, an' not to say to speak to, me bein' a quiet sort. I knew
  Butson since&mdash;in the shops; most took 'im for a bachelor. Well, I wasn't
  at Lime'us very long; I came away to this part an' see no more of
  'er&mdash;though o' course I see 'im, often. When you told me 'e'd married
  your mother it took me aback a bit at first. But then, thinks I, I expect the
  first one's dead&mdash;must be. But after that, the other day, when you told
  me what a right down bad 'un 'e was, I begun to think wuss of 'im. I knew
  'e'd bin livin' idle, but I didn't guess 'e treated 'er so bad. An' when you
  talked o' wantin' to get rid of 'im, I got a notion. If 'e's bad enough for
  what 'e's done, thinks I, 'e's bad enough for anythink. P'raps 'is fust
  wife's alive after all, an' if she is, why the job's done! Anyway, I puts it,
  I'll risk a day or two auf on it. An' I did, an' 'ere's a nice old bloomin'
  mess I made! Oh, I ought to be poleaxed!"</p>

  <p>"Well of course there's been a row," Johnny said gloomily, "an' I expect
  it'll knock trade to pieces here, an' half kill mother. But you couldn't very
  well help a row in a thing like this."</p>

  <p>"I bin three days findin' 'er. My old lan'lady's dead, an' I 'ad to try
  an' find 'er sister. Nobody knew where the sister was, but after a lot o'
  bother a old woman sends me to a cousin&mdash;in the workus. Cousin in the
  workus thinks the sister's dead too, but tells me to go an' ask at a
  newspaper-shop in Bromley. Newspaper-shop's shut up&mdash;people gone. Find
  the man as moved 'em, an' 'e sends me to Bow&mdash;another newspaper-shop.
  People there send me right back to Poplar; party o' the name o' Bushell.
  Party o' the name o' Bushel very friendly, an' sends me to Old Ford; then I
  went to Bow again, an' so I dodged about, up an' down, till I run across Mrs.
  Butson up on 'Omerton Marshes, keep-in' a laundry. That was to-day, that
  was.</p>

  <p>"Well, she took it mighty cool at first. When I told 'er I knew where 'er
  'usband was, she told me I might keep my knowledge to myself, for she didn't
  want 'im. Very cool she was, till I told 'er 'e'd married again, an' at that
  she shut 'er jaw with a snap, an' glared at me. So I just told 'er what I
  knew, an' 'ow it 'ud be a charity to give 'im a scare on the quiet, an' send
  'im away from 'ere, an' 'All right,' she says. 'Jest you show me where they
  live,' she says; 'I'll give 'im a scare!' 'Right,' says I, but I made
  conditions. She wus to wait at the street-corner, an' I was to send in a
  message for 'im to come out. Then we was to give 'im ten minutes to go an'
  git 'is clo'es, if 'e wanted any, make any excuse 'e liked, an' clear out; so
  as to do it all quiet an' peaceable, an' nobody the wiser. 'All right,' she
  says, 'jest you show me the place, that's all!' So I brought 'er. But when we
  got to the corner an' I told 'er which 'ouse, auf she went at a bolt,
  an'&mdash;an' set up all that row 'fore I could stop 'er! Who'd 'a' thought
  of 'er actin' contradictory like that?"</p>

  <p>It was not altogether so dense a mystery to Johnny as it was to the
  simpler Hicks, twice his age, though more a boy than himself. But he assured
  Hicks that after all he had done a good turn, and no price was too high for
  riddance of Butson. "Mother'll be grateful to you, too, when she's a bit
  quieter, an' knows about it," he said. And presently he added thoughtfully,
  "I think I ought to have guessed something o' the sort, with his sneaking in
  an' out so quiet, an' being afraid o' the p'lice. There's lots o' things I
  see through now, that I ought to have seen through before: not wantin' the
  new name over the door, for one!"</p>

  <p>Till the shutters were up that night, and the door well bolted, Nan May
  was urgent that that horrible woman must be kept out. And when at last she
  slept, in mere exhaustion, she awoke in a fit of trembling and choking,
  beseeching somebody to take the woman away.</p>

  <p>Bessy, like Johnny, had a sense of relief, though she slept not at all,
  and dreaded vaguely. But withal she was conscious of some intangible
  remembrance of that red-faced woman with the harsh voice; and it was
  long&mdash;days&mdash;ere it returned to her that she had heard the voice
  high above the shouts of the beanfeasters in the Forest on the day when Uncle
  Isaac had brought Butson to the cottage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. DUNKIN'S notice to quit arrived early the next morning.
  The service of that notice was a duty he owed to society, morality,
  conscience, virtue, propriety, religion, and several other things, which he
  enumerated without hesitation. He could not have sat in his pew the next day
  with any comfort, knowing that such a duty remained unperformed; he would
  have felt a hypocrite.</p>

  <p>The notice might have come before, for the trade had been good and steady;
  but Mr. Dunkin also had heard the whispers that the ship-yard might be shut,
  and he had hesitated long. Now, however, there was no alternative&mdash;if
  Mrs. May were left to flaunt her infamy the trade must decline under the
  scandal, and the place fall worthless again. More, her expulsion at this time
  would seem less a seizure of the new branch than a popular vindication of
  righteousness.</p>

  <p>Johnny was at home when the notice came. He had sent a message to Mr.
  Cottam, pleading urgent family affairs.</p>

  <p>"Might have expected it," Johnny said, giving the paper to Hicks, whom he
  had called into counsel. "Anyway mother swears she can't show her face in the
  shop again. She seems almost afraid to come out of her bedroom, talks wild
  about disgracing her children, an' wishes she was dead. She's pretty bad, an'
  as to the shop&mdash;that's done up. Question is what to do now."</p>

  <p>Then Hicks rose to his feet, and met the occasior face to face. "We'll do
  this thing between us," he said, "and damn everybody! I ain't a man o'
  business, not special, but I got you all into this 'ere mess an' I'll see you
  out of it, or I'll bust. Fust thing, this 'ere Mr. Dunkin's game's plain
  enough. 'Ere's a very decent business goin' on, an' 'e takes this excuse to
  collar it 'isself. You ain't took the shutters down yet, an' we won't take
  'em down. We'll stick up a big bill 'Business come to a end,' or such other
  words, an' let the customers go where they like an' 'ope they won't come
  back. Then p'raps 'e'll come along in a day or two an' offer to buy the
  stock, thinkin' 'e'll get it for next to nothin', you bein' all at sixes an'
  sevens. We won't sell it&mdash;not one farden candle. But we won't say so.
  No. We'll fight cokum. We'll ask 'im to think over it for another day or two
  an' see if 'e can't make it a quid or two more. 'E'll let it slide all the
  week if we do it right, expectin' to land us at the last minute an' make us
  take anythink. But we'll just be walkin' the stuff all away very quiet in the
  evenin's, in a barrer, an' then 'e'll come into a empty shop unexpected, an'
  'e won't know what the customers is used to, an' that'll give 'im fits for
  another week or two. See?"</p>

  <p>"But where shall we take the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Take it? Lord, anywhere!" replied Hicks, with a sweep of the hand.
  "There's plenty o' empty shops ready to be took everywhere. Why the number
  I've seen these two or three days 'ud surprise ye! Some ain't as good as
  others p'raps, but that we'll settle in the week. It's just beginnin' again,
  that's all, same as what ye did three or four year back! Lord, we'll do it, I
  tell ye&mdash;do it flyin'!" Long Hicks waved his arms enthusiastically. "As
  to the&mdash;the ha'pence," he went on, "p'raps your mother's got some,
  p'raps she ain't&mdash;don't matter either way. I'm a single man, an' bin in
  good work years, an' I got a bit in the savin's bank. All right! I ain't
  goin' to offer no favours, so don't sing out! Sixpence in the pound's all I
  get out o' the Post Office, an' that ain't much. I'm open to make it a bit
  more&mdash;three per cent. if ye like&mdash;on loan; any security, or
  none&mdash;there's plenty in the place in the Forest an' the stock an'
  all&mdash;'ave it yer own way. Business! 'Ard business! That's all it is. An'
  now we'll clear decks. Fust, get your mother an' sister out o' this,
  somewhere out o' Harbour Lane, where they ain't known, an' where they'll quit
  frettin'."</p>

  <p>"Where?" Hicks's impetuosity left Johnny's wits lagging.</p>

  <p>"Temp'ry lodgin's. Needn't be fur; next parish is as good as fifty mile
  auf, in London. Better. An' by George! now I think of it, I see the very
  place when I was goin' round. Party o' the name o' Bushell, in Poplar. 'Ouse
  too big for 'em&mdash;got a furnished bedroom to let; showed it me, case I
  might know anyone an' send 'em, them 'avin' done me a turn sendin' me to Old
  Ford. What's more, there'll be two more rooms, unfurnished, next week, tenant
  goin' out&mdash;young gal, a dressmaker. So we can take them too, if we get
  pushed, an' run the sticks in there. There's luck to begin with! Why,
  things'll go like clockwork!"</p>

  <p>Hicks rushed off to make sure of the lodging, and in half an hour was back
  with a four-wheeled cab.</p>

  <p>"Get 'em down an' pop 'em in sharp," said Hicks. "I've told the cabby
  where to go. You go with 'em an' make 'em comfortable, an' I'll wait 'ere
  till you come back. Mind&mdash;people at the 'ouse on'y know she's in trouble
  'cos 'er 'usband's run away, an' I paid a week in advance. Go on&mdash;I'll
  keep out o' the way in the back till they're clear auf; they don't want to
  see me."</p>

  <p>Nan and Bessy wore veils, and hurried into the cab, while Johnny glowered
  fiercely at every face he could see turned toward them. To Johnny the streets
  seemed unreasonably familiar as the cab jolted through
  them&mdash;unreasonably like what they were a day ago, before this blow fell
  and knocked the world out of shape. They went out through Blackwall Cross, by
  the High Street, and past the Institute, where the familiar
  housekeeper&mdash;the housekeeper who had given him Nora's farewell
  letter&mdash;stood on the steps with a broom; through the two streets, and
  past that corner where they had parted&mdash;it seemed years ago. As to when
  they might meet again, and how&mdash;that was not to be thought of now. His
  head was too full already.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

  <p class="first"><i>"OH, give us some time to blow the man down!"</i> roared
  Mr. Bushell, splashing and puffing amid much yellow soap and cold water in
  the wash-house, whither he had gone for a wash, on coming home from his tug.
  The voice thundered and rolled through the house, and on the first floor,
  strangers not used to it grew muddled in their conversation.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br>
  To my Aye! Aye! Blow the man down!<br>
  Singapore Harbour to gay London town&mdash;<br>
  Oh, give us some time to blow the man down!"</p><br>

  <p>Up on the first floor landing, "A-a-ah! pore dears!" said Mrs. Bushell,
  fat and sympathetic, looking up at Johnny, with her head aside and her hands
  clasped. "Pore dears! No, nobody shan't disturb 'em! Lor, 'ow I do feel for
  'em; an' you too, Mr. May. Lucky you're growed up to be a comfort to yer pore
  mar! There&mdash;I won't say nothin' about yer father! Runnin' away so
  disgraceful an' all. But I can't think what parents is comin' to, some of
  'em. There's the pore gal as is leavin' the other two rooms o' Monday,
  now&mdash;sich a quiet, well-be'aved young lady; we wouldn't 'a' let 'em stop
  a week if it wasn't for 'er sake, bein' so 'ard to find a respectable
  lodgin's with sich a mother. But there&mdash;'er mother worries the pore
  thing's life out&mdash;alwis drinkin'&mdash;an' now she's akchally in gaol
  for breakin' a public-'ouse winder! An' I sez&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Public-house window!" Johnny's breath came short and thick. "What's her
  name?"</p>

  <p>"P'raps I shouldn't 'a' mentioned it to a stranger, but lor, I don't
  s'pose you know 'er, an' it's Sansom. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is she? Show me! In here? Is she in now?" Johnny made dashes at
  divers door-handles with one hand, while Mrs. Bushell, confounded and
  scandalised, restrained him desperately by the opposite arm. It took some
  impatient moments to make it plain to the landlady that he intended no
  violent assault, nor, on consideration, even the rudeness of dashing into a
  lady's rooms unannounced. Whereupon Mrs. Bushell went to a door and knocked,
  Johnny close at her heels. And presently the door opened.</p>

  <p>"Nora!"</p>

  <p>"Oh Johnny, Johnny, I wish you hadn't!...We shall only&mdash;" But with
  that the words died on the breast of Johnny's coat. Mrs. Bushell's eyes
  opened round, and then her mouth; and then Mrs. Bushell went off very quietly
  downstairs&mdash;eyes and mouth and face all round&mdash;and out into the
  wash-house; and "Blow the Man Down" stopped in the middle.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you know what I said, Johnny! We can't&mdash;you know we
  can't!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I shan't let you go now. <i>I've</i> got a disreputable mother
  now&mdash;or so they say. Have you heard of yours&mdash;since?"</p>

  <p>"She's in the infirmary&mdash;very bad. Something's been forming on the
  liver for years, the doctor says; and when she couldn't get anything to drink
  she broke down at once. But what did you say about your mother?"</p>

  <p>Johnny told her the tale. "And now," he added in the end, "she's in there,
  worn out an' broken down, an' not a woman in the world to comfort her but my
  sister. Come in, an' help." And they went in together.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the end of a week Long Hicks stood astounded at his own
  performances. At the end of a year he was still astonished, and proud
  inordinately; and till the end of his life he will never forget the smallest
  particular of that week's exploits. The policeman who came with a warrant for
  Butson, the young man from Mr. Dunkin, who came about the stock, the other
  young man that came the next time&mdash;he polished them all off, and half a
  dozen others, in the most dashing and businesslike manner. He found a new
  shop&mdash;found a score of shops, in fact, so that Nan May was fain to rouse
  herself and choose, lest some hopeless sepulchre of trade were rented without
  her knowledge. And this was good, for it gave her work to do and to think of,
  and once set going, she buckled to her task with all her old energy, and a
  world of riper experience. The shop was not so fortunately placed as that at
  Harbour Lane, and trade was never quite so good as it had been there when at
  its best. More, its place was in a dingy street, out of sight of the river
  and the ships. But it was a fairly busy thoroughfare, and things could be
  sold there, which was the main consideration. And it was Hicks's triumph to
  stock this shop with the stock from Harbour Lane&mdash;conveyed secretly by
  night, on a truck, with many chucklings, after cunning putting-off of Mr.
  Dunkin. The tale whereof he would tell ever after with bashful glee, together
  with the tale of the sad emptiness and disorganisation of Mr. Dunkin's new
  branch at its opening on Monday morning. And Uncle Isaac (who found his
  niece's new shop ere long) assured the listener by frequent proclamation,
  that Mr. Hicks was a gentleman of vast business ability, and a genius at
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>"Yus, a genius, that's what <i>I</i> say, Mr. Cottam&mdash;a genius of
  uncommon talent." It was a wet afternoon, when Cottam and Hicks had taken ten
  minutes' shelter in the round-house by the quay-side: and presently were
  joined by Uncle Isaac, on his way across from the docks.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cottam grunted. He had met Uncle Isaac twice before.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" Uncle Isaac went on, gazing at the uneasy Hicks with steadfast
  admiration, "Lord! If 'e was on'y ambitious' 'e might be anythink! What a
  ornament 'e 'd be to a Diplomatic Corpse! Talk about Enterprise! Why at
  Enterprise an' any sort o' circumventions 'e 's&mdash;'e 's&mdash;why there,
  <i>as</i> I alwis say, 'e might be Ambashador to 'er Majesty's
  possessions!"</p>

  <p>The shower flagged, and men carne out on the quays. Mr. Cottam rose from
  the coil he had been sitting on, took his gaze out of space, and fixed it on
  the wall over Uncle Isaac's head. "Mr. Mundy!" he trumpeted, in the manner of
  a man beginning a speech to an expectant multitude; raising his forefinger to
  his shoulder and lowering it till it rested on Uncle Isaac's chest; "Mr.
  Mundy!"</p>

  <p>Then he paused, and Uncle Isaac said, "Yus, Mr. Cottam."</p>

  <p>The pause endured and grew impressive; till at last the foreman's face
  relaxed, his gaze descended till it met Uncle Isaac's, and he chuckled aloud,
  stabbing him playfully with the forefinger. "Why&mdash;what a windy of kidder
  you are!" said Mr. Cottam; and stamped off along the quay, croaking and
  chuckling all over.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">SO with the days and the months Nan's sorrows fell from her,
  and their harder shapes were lost in her remembrance; and the new days
  brought a new peace&mdash;perhaps even a new dulness. For this was a dull
  place, this street of flat walls, and grime, and anxious passengers. But what
  mattered mere dulness of externals when she had hard work to do, and a son to
  take pride in?</p>

  <p>For Nora's sorrows, who shall speak? There was a hospital bed that she
  knew well, a pillow whereon a slaty face wasted and grew blank of meaning.
  And in the end there was a day of driving wet in a clayey cemetery, a day of
  loneliness, and wonder, and dull calm.</p>

  <p>But that day went with the others, and that year went. The streets grew
  sloppy with winter, dusty with summer: and smoky geraniums struggled into
  bloom on window-sills, and died off. Miles away the Forest gowned itself anew
  in green, in brown and in white; and in green the exiles saw it, once a year:
  but all its dresses were spread for Bessy still, in her dreams.</p>

  <p>Two years were gone, and Johnny was within five months of twenty-one, and
  the end of his apprenticeship, when on a brave August day he walked in the
  Forest alone. There would be no Forest excursion for him next year, for then,
  with good fortune, he would be upon the seas. For the firm had promised him
  the recommendation that would give him a year's voyaging as fourth
  engineer.</p>

  <p>Bessy and Nora were sharing the holiday, but they were left to rest at Bob
  Smallpiece's cottage. Bob, vast, brown, and leathery, was much as ever. He
  had seen Johnny and Bessy once each year, but not their mother,
  since&mdash;well since he had gone to London to see his sister. He was not
  sure whether he should go up to London again soon, or not. Meantime he made
  tea for his visitors.</p>

  <p>They had climbed the hill to gran'dad's grave, and they had found it green
  and neat: they had seen another, fresh-closed, beside it, and wondered who
  was buried there; they had gathered flowers in Monk Wood, and they had stayed
  long in Loughton Camp; they had come again to the cottage on the glen-side,
  and Johnny had had to stoop at the door to save his hat, for indeed he was
  within two inches as big as Bob Smallpiece himself; and now Johnny, being
  alone, took the path to Wormleyton Pits. It was six years since he had gone
  that way last, and he might never go that way again.</p>

  <p>Mainly his way lay as it had lain when he carried the basket of sloes,
  that night when his grandfather had hunted his last moth. Johnny had left
  childish fancies years behind him, and now the trees were trees merely, one
  much as the rest, though green and cheerful in the sunlight. But even as on
  that night his mind had run on London, the longed-for London that was his
  home now, and stale with familiarity, so now he turned over once more the
  mystery of the old man's cutting off: and with as little foreknowledge of the
  next chances in life's hatful.</p>

  <p>Here branched the track by which he had made for Theydon; there was the
  tree under which he had last seen the old man's lantern-light; and then the
  slade opened, glorious with heather. Brambles and bushes about the pits were
  changed&mdash;this grown higher and wider, that withered off; and the
  pits&mdash;the smaller pits, at least, seemed shallow enough holes under the
  eyes of a man of near six feet. The deepest pit&mdash;<i>the</i>
  pit&mdash;was farthest; and Johnny could see a man, whose figure seemed
  vaguely familiar, sitting on its edge.</p>

  <p>He picked his way across the broken ground and came to the pit on the side
  opposite to the stranger. There was the hole where the old man had taken his
  death-blow. Perhaps the bottom had risen an inch or so because of
  gravel-washings; but the big stone in the middle was still plain to see.</p>

  <p>The man opposite was trimming wooden pegs with a pocket-knife. He wore
  corduroys, of a cut that Johnny held in remembrance. Johnny watched for a few
  seconds, and then the man turned up a leathery brown face, and Johnny knew
  him. It was Amos Honeywell, notable as a poacher, and chief of a family of
  poachers. Amos put a peg into his pocket and began on another.</p>

  <p>"Well, Amos!" called Johnny across the pit; "you don't know me!"</p>

  <p>The man looked up, and stared. "No," he said, "I dun't."</p>

  <p>Johnny gave him his name.</p>

  <p>"What?" answered Amos, putting away his peg unfinished. "Johnny May? The
  boy as used to be along o' oad May the butterfly man, as died in a axdent in
  this 'ere very pit?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if it was an accident."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was that all right 'nough. But, why, ye're twice as tall: an'
  'taren't so long, nayther." Amos paused, staring mightily at Johnny, and
  slapped his thigh. "Why," he said, "it's the curiousest thing in natur,
  seein' you now, an' here too. Did ye see e'er a funeral las' Wednesday?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;where?"</p>

  <p>"Up to chu'ch where yer gran'father's buried. But no&mdash;y'aren't livin'
  hereabout now, o' coase. Well it is the rarest conglomeration ever I see, me
  seein' you 'ere at this 'ere very pit, an' 'im buried on'y las' Wednesday,
  an' died in a accident too. Fell off a rick, he did."</p>

  <p>"An' who was he?"</p>

  <p>"Coopersale chap, he was, name o' Stiles. Lived here 'bout six year. But
  coase you wud'n' know 'bout him; 'twere he as did the accident."</p>

  <p>"Did the accident? What d'ye mean?"</p>

  <p>Amos Honeywell got up from his seat, and jerked his thumb toward the
  pit-bottom. "This here one," he said. "Yer gran'father."</p>

  <p>"D' you mean he killed him?"</p>

  <p>"Dun't much matter what ye call it now the chap's dead, but I wouldn't put
  it killed&mdash;not meanin'." Amos Honeywell came slouching along the
  pit-edge, talking as he came. "See, he was a Coopersale chap an' new here,
  an' knowed few. Well, he sees this here's a likely spot for a rabbit or so,
  an' he puts up a few pegs an' a wire or two, just arter dark: you know. In
  the middle of it he sees a strange oad chap comin' with a lantern,
  searchin'&mdash;searchin' what for? Why for wires, he thinks, o' coase. He
  hides in some brambles, but t'oad chap gets nigher an' nigher an' presen'ly
  Stiles he sees he's about caught. So he ups on a sudden an' knocks the oad
  chap over, an' grabs the wires an' then he bolts. Oad chap goes over into pit
  of a lump, an' he falls awk'ard an'&mdash;an' well&mdash;there y'are!"</p>

  <p>"And how long ha' you known this?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Knowed</i> it? Knowed it all time, same as others."</p>

  <p>"An' never said a word of it, nor told the police?"</p>

  <p>"Why no," Amos answered, with honest indignation.</p>

  <p>"Wudn't hey us get the poor chap in trouble, wud ye?"</p>

  <p>And this was the mystery: nothing of wonder at all, nothing but a casual
  crossing of ways: just a chance from the hatful, like all the rest of it. And
  Amos&mdash;well, he was right, too, by such lights as he could see.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">LIGHT was low behind the hills, and dusk dimmed the keeper's
  honest face as he waved his friends goodbye. Yes, he would come to them in
  London, one of these days. Soon? Well, then, soon.</p>

  <p>Together the three went down the scented lanes, where the white
  ghost-moths began to fly, and so into the world of new adventure.</p>
