  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">RONALD STANDISH lay back in his chair with a worried look on
  his usually cheerful face. In his hand he held a letter, which he read over
  for the second time before tossing it across to me.</p>

  <p>"The devil and all, Bob," he said, shaking his head. "From what I saw in
  the papers a clearer case never existed."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the note.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">
  Dear Mr. Standish (it ran),&mdash;I do hope you will forgive a complete
  stranger writing to you, but I am in desperate trouble. You will probably
  remember a very great friend of mine&mdash;Isabel Blount, whom you helped
  some months ago. Well, it was she who advised me to come to you. Would it be
  possible for you to see me tomorrow after noon at three o'clock? I shall
  come, anyway, on the chance of finding you disengaged.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">Katherine Moody.</p>
  <br>

  <p>"Which means today, in a quarter of an hour," he said, as I laid down the
  note.</p>

  <p>"And I fear it's pretty hopeless."</p>

  <p>"You know who she is, then?" I remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely and crossed to a corner of the room where a pile of
  newspapers was lying on a chair. And as I watched him I wondered, not for the
  first time what had made him take up the profession he had. A born player of
  games, wealthy, and distinctly good-looking, he seemed the last person in the
  world to become a detective. And yet that was what he was when one boiled
  down to hard facts. True, he picked and chose his cases, and sometimes for
  months on end he never handled one at all. But sooner or later some crime
  would interest him, and then he would drop everything until he had either
  solved it or was beaten. With the official police he was on excellent terms,
  which was not to be wondered at in view of the fact that on many occasions he
  had put them on the right track. At times some new man was tempted to smile
  contemptuously at the presumption of an amateur pitting himself against the
  official force, but the smile generally faded before long. For there was no
  denying that he had a most uncanny flair for picking out the points that
  mattered from a mass of irrelevant detail.</p>

  <p>"It's bad to prejudge a case," he remarked, coming back with two papers,
  "but this looks pretty damaging on the face of it."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a paragraph, and I ran my eye down it.</p>

  <p class="headline">SHOCKING TRAGEDY IN LEICESTERSHIRE<br>
  BRUTAL MURDER OF YOUNG ARTIST</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"A crime of unparalleled ferocity was committed
  yesterday in the grounds of Mexbury Hall, the home of Mr. John Playfair, who
  has lived there for some years with his ward, Miss Katherine Moody, and her
  companion. Standing amongst the trees, some way from the Hall and out of
  sight of it, there is a summer-house which commands a magnificent view over
  the surrounding country. And it was in this summer-house that the tragedy
  occurred.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"It appears that for some weeks past Mr. Playfair has
  allowed a young artist named Bernard Power to use it as a studio. Yesterday,
  on returning in the afternoon from a motor trip, Mr. Playfair, while taking a
  stroll in the grounds, happened to pass by the summer-house, where he was
  horrified to see a red stream dripping sluggishly down the wooden steps that
  led to the door. He rushed in, to find the unfortunate young man lying dead
  on the floor with his head literally crushed in like a broken egg-shell.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Touching nothing, he rushed back to the house, where he
  telephoned for the police and a doctor, who arrived post-haste.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The doctor stated, after examining the body, that Mr.
  Power had been dead about five hours, which placed the time of the crime at
  ten o'clock that morning. Then, with the help of Inspector Savage, who has
  charge of the case, the body was moved, and instantly the weapon with which
  the deed was done was discovered. A huge stone weighing over fourteen pounds
  was lying on the floor, and adhering to it were blood and several hairs that
  obviously had belonged to the dead man. Mr. Playfair explained that the stone
  had originally come from an old heap which had been left over when the
  foundations of the summer-house had been laid. This particular one, he went
  on to say, had been used as a weight on the floor to prevent the door from
  banging when the artist wanted it open: he had suggested it to him some weeks
  previously.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"It is clear that a particularly brutal murder has been
  committed, as any possibility of accident or suicide can be ruled out. The
  murderer must have approached from behind while the unfortunate young man was
  at work on his picture, and bashed in his head with one blow.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The police are in possession of several clues, and
  sensational developments are expected."</p>

  <p>I looked at the date. It was yesterday's paper. Then I looked at the other
  paragraph he was indicating.</p>

  <p>"These are the sensational developments," said Ronald, "which are
  doubtless responsible for Miss Moody's letter."</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The police have lost no time in following up the clues
  they obtained in the shocking tragedy that occurred the day before yesterday
  at Mexbury Hall. It will be recalled that the body of a young artist named
  Bernard Power was found in the summer house with the head battered in in a
  fashion which proved conclusively that a singularly brutal murder had been
  committed.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Yesterday Inspector Savage arrested a neighbouring
  landowner, Mr. Hubert Daynton, on the charge of being the murderer. It is
  understood that a stick belonging to the accused was found in the summer and
  the butt end of a cigarette of a brand he habitually smokes was discovered
  lying on the floor.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The accused protests his complete ignorance of the
  affair, a further developments are awaited hourly. Needless to say, Mr.
  Playfair, in whose grounds the tragedy occurred, is much upset, as the dead
  man was a protegÚ of his."</p>

  <p>I put down the paper and glanced at my companion.</p>

  <p>"It certainly seems pretty bad for Mr. Hubert Daynton," I said. "He seems
  to have gone out of his way to leave the evidence lying about."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Standish remarked. "Which may be a point in his favour.
  However, there goes the bell. We'll hear what Miss Moody has to say."</p>

  <p>The door opened, and his man ushered in a delightfully pretty girl of
  about twenty-one or two, who looked from one to the other of us with a
  worried expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Miss Moody," said Ronald. "And let me introduce a great pal of
  mine, Bob Miller. You can say anything you like in front of him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know what I've come about, Mr. Standish," cried the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I know what has appeared in the papers," said Ronald, "which summarises
  into the fact that Hubert Daynton has been arrested for the murder of an
  artist called Bernard Power in the summer-house of your guardian's
  place."</p>

  <p>"But he never did it, Mr. Standish," she cried, clasping her hands
  together.</p>

  <p>"So, I gather, he states. At the same time, the police seem to think
  otherwise. Now will you be good enough to fill in all the gaps, as far as you
  can, which have been left by the papers? And one thing I beg of you&mdash;
  don't keep anything back. It is absolutely imperative that I should have all
  the facts, even if they appear to you to be damaging."</p>

  <p>"I will conceal nothing," she said. "You know from the papers that I live
  at Mexbury Hall with my guardian, and Hubert Daynton has the neighbouring
  house, Gadsby. Tower. He was often over with us, and we did the same thing at
  his place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was?" put in Ronald. "Do you imply anything by using the past tense?"</p>

  <p>"During recent months matters have become a little strained," she said, a
  slightly heightened colour coming into her cheeks. "To be brief, he wanted to
  marry me, and my guardian didn't like the idea."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Ronald bluntly. "Was there any particular reason, or just
  general disapproval?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered, "Uncle John&mdash;he's not really any
  relation, of course&mdash;is very old-fashioned in some ways, and has the
  most absurd ideas about what girls ought to be told. But one thing is
  certain: the moment Hubert made it clear that he wanted to marry me, Uncle
  John's manner towards him changed completely."</p>

  <p>"One further point, Miss Moody," said Ronald, with a faint smile. "What
  were your feelings on the subject?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she answered frankly, "I didn't say I would and I didn't say I
  wouldn't. He's rather a dear, and I like him immensely, but I can't say I'm
  in love with him. In addition, I'm terribly fond of Uncle John who has been a
  sort of mother and father to me, and the fact that he disapproved did
  influence me. There was an idea at the back of my mind, I think, that in time
  I might get him to change his mind about Hubert, which would have made a
  difference."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," said Ronald. "And that was the condition of
  affairs between you and Hubert Daynton at the time of his arrest?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it wasn't," she answered slowly. "Two months ago Bernard Power
  came to stay at the village inn. He was an artist, as you know, and in some
  way or other he got to know Uncle John. Now, my guardian is a photographic
  maniac&mdash;it is the one absorbing hobby of his life&mdash;and as Bernard
  went in for landscape work they seemed to find something in common. He was
  continually asking Bernard to dinner; and fitted him up, as you read in the
  papers, in the summer-house as a studio."</p>

  <p>She paused for a moment, and glanced from Ronald to me.</p>

  <p>"The poor man is dead now," she went on, "and if it wasn't for Hubert's
  sake, I'd say nothing. But there's no getting away from the fact that Bernard
  Power was a nasty bit of work. You both of you look thoroughly uman, and
  you'll know what I mean when I say he was always pawing one, touching one's
  arm or something like that&mdash;a thing I loathe. But matters came to a head
  three days ago. I happened to be passing the summer-house when he called out
  to me to come and have a look at his picture.</p>

  <p>"Without thinking, I went in. To do him justice, he was a very clever
  painter. And before I knew where I was, he'd seized me in his arms and was
  trying to kiss me. I was perfectly furious. I'd never given him the slightest
  encouragement. However, after I'd smacked his face as hard as I could, he let
  me go. And then I told him a few home truths and left."</p>

  <p>Again she paused, and bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"I left, Mr. Standish, and, as evil fortune would have it, I ran into
  Hubert paying one of his very infrequent visits, He had come over to see me
  about a spaniel I wanted. If only it had been an hour later it wouldn't have
  mattered; I should have recovered. As it was he saw, of course, that I was
  angry, and realising I'd come from the direction of the summer-house, he
  jumped at once to the correct conclusion.</p>

  <p>"'Has that damned painter been up to his monkey tricks again?' he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"And very foolishly I told him what had happened. He was furious, and
  there's no denying that Hubert has a very nasty temper when roused. I
  regretted having said anything the moment the words were out of my mouth, but
  then it was too late. And it was only with the greatest difficulty that I
  prevented him going on then and there to put it across Bernard Power. I told
  him that I was quite capable of looking after myself, and that the matter was
  over and done with.</p>

  <p>"In the middle of our conversation Uncle John joined us. He saw at once
  that something was up and asked what had happened. Hubert told him and he
  didn't mince his words, which got Uncle John's back up. And finally the two
  of them very nearly had a row.</p>

  <p>"Uncle John's point of view was that he was the proper person for me to go
  to, and that it was no business of Hubert's. Hubert on the contrary said it
  was any decent man's business if some swab of a painter kissed a girl against
  her will. And then he made the damning statement that he personally proposed
  to interview Mr. Bernard Power the following morning."</p>

  <p>"Did anyone else hear that remark besides you and your guardian?" asked
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"No one," she said. "Of that I'm positive."</p>

  <p>"Why did he specify the following morning? Why didn't he go right
  away?"</p>

  <p>"He had people coming to lunch, and it was getting late."</p>

  <p>"And the following morning was the morning of the murder," said Ronald
  thoughtfully. "Now let's hear exactly what Daynton says took place."</p>

  <p>"He says that he started from Gadsby Tower at half-past nine and walked
  over to the summer-house. He found Bernard Power had no yet arrived, so he
  lit a cigarette and waited for him&mdash;a cigarette which he admits he threw
  on the floor and put out with his shoe.</p>

  <p>"Then Bernard Power came in, and apparently Hubert went for him like a
  pickpocket. He called him a leprous mess, and a few more things of that sort,
  and they had a fearful quarrel, in the course of which Hubert put his stick
  up against the wall, because he was afraid he might hit the other with it,
  and he was a much smaller man than Hubert. Then he left, and went back to his
  own house, which he reached at twenty past ten."</p>

  <p>Ronald Standish nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Forgetting all about his stick," he remarked. "A very important point,
  that."</p>

  <p>"He was so excited, Mr. Standish," said the girl. "I know the police think
  as you do, but surely it's understandable"</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Moody," he said with a smile, "you quite mistake my meaning.
  Now that I've heard your full story I think it tells enormously in his
  favour. It is certain that he must have discovered he had left his stick in
  the summer-house on his way back to Gadsby Tower. There is nothing that a man
  notices quicker. If, then, he had murdered Power he would at all costs have
  had to go back to get it. To leave such a damning piece of evidence lying
  about was tantamount to putting a noose round his neck. But what was more
  natural than that he, rather than renew the quarrel, should decide to leave
  it there, and get it some other time?"</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think he did it?" she cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>"What I may think," said Ronald guardedly, "is one thing. What we've got
  to prove is another. If he didn't do it&mdash;who did? The crime, according
  to the doctor's evidence, must have been committed very shortly after Daynton
  left the summer-house. It is, therefore, I think, a justifiable assumption
  that the murderer was near by during the interview, heard the quarrel, and
  seized the opportunity of throwing suspicion on somebody else. So that at any
  rate one line of exploration must be to find out if this man Power had an
  enemy who was so bitter against him that he wouldn't stick at murder. And
  from what you tell me of his manners with you, it would not be surprising if
  he has gone even further with some other girl. In which case there may be a
  man who was not as forbearing as Daynton."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll help Hubert?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Miss Moody," he said. "Now that I've heard the details my
  opinion is quite different. Bob and I will come down with you this afternoon.
  But before we start there are just one or two points I'd like cleared up.
  First&mdash;what were your movements on the day of the murder?"</p>

  <p>"I stayed in the house till lunch; and in the afternoon I played tennis at
  a house five miles away."</p>

  <p>"You had no communication with Daynton of any sort&mdash;over the
  telephone, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Playfair&mdash;what did he do?"</p>

  <p>"He went out on one of his photography expeditions. He started in the car
  about half-past eight in the morning, and was not back till after lunch."</p>

  <p>"One last point. You have already said that no one could have overheard
  the conversation between the three of you on the drive. But did you by any
  chance mention it to anybody afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I said nothing about it. And I'm sure Uncle John didn't
  either, as he was in the whole afternoon fiddling about with his latest
  camera."</p>

  <p>"Then it must either have been an unfortunate coincidence for Bernard
  Power or&mdash;" He broke off and stared out of the window thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said, rousing himself at length. "Let's go down and look
  at this summer-house. I hope your nerves are good, Miss Moody. Bob generally
  drives, and never at less than sixty miles an hour."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">THE grounds of Mexbury Hall were extensive, and the summer-
  house was a good quarter of a mile from the Hall itself. Trees surrounded it
  on three sides, affording admirable cover for anyone who wished to hide. The
  fourth was open, and gave a magnificent view over the country to the south.
  It was simply built of wood, with a sunblind that could be let down over the
  big window.</p>

  <p>A policeman was on guard as we approached, and he looked doubtful when
  Ronald explained his business.</p>

  <p>"Inspector's orders, sir, were that no one was to be allowed in. Still, I
  suppose you're different."</p>

  <p>"Come in yourself, officer, and you'll see that I'm not going to touch
  anything. I take it nothing has been moved except the body?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

  <p>"Were you here yourself when the body was found?"</p>

  <p>"I came with the Inspector, sir."</p>

  <p>Ronald knelt down by the wooden steps leading to the door, and carefully
  examined the ominous red stain. Then, with a shake of his head, he got
  up.</p>

  <p>"Too late," he said, "Nothing to be got out of that now."</p>

  <p>He pushed open the door and stepped inside. Then, according to his
  invariable custom, he stood absolutely motionless, with only his eyes moving
  from side to side as he absorbed every detail. On the easel stood the half-
  finished picture spattered with the dead man's blood. The overturned chair
  still lay where it had fallen as the artist had crashed to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Not much doubt about what happened, sir," remarked the constable. "Never
  seen a clearer case in all ray service. Fair battered to pieces, he was, poor
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of this, Roberts?" said a gruff voice from outside. "I
  ordered you to admit no one."</p>

  <p>Ronald Standish swung round. A choleric looking man in uniform was
  standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Savage, I take it?" Standish said genially. "I have been
  commissioned by Miss Moody to make a few inquiries on behalf of Mr.
  Daynton."</p>

  <p>He held out his card, and the Inspector grunted.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, Mr. Standish," he remarked. "And if I was you I'd wash
  my hands of it. You'll get no credit out of this case."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," agreed Ronald. "Still, when a lady asks one to do something
  for her it is hard to refuse."</p>

  <p>"Kinder in the long run," said the other. "There's no good in raising
  false hopes in her mind. You've seen in the newspapers what we've discovered.
  What you may not know is that Daynton admits to having had a furious quarrel
  with the murdered man at the very time the deed was done."</p>

  <p>"It was that fact, amongst others, my dear Inspector, that caused me to
  take up the case. Surely no one out of a lunatic asylum would go out of his
  way to damn himself so completely if he had done the murder. His stick, I
  admit, he couldn't get over, since he was imbecile enough to leave it here;
  the cigarette stump is awkward. But why he should then add a quarrel which no
  one had heard is really more than one can swallow."</p>

  <p>He was swinging the door backwards and forwards as he spoke, and I saw by
  the glint in his eye that he was hot on something.</p>

  <p>"Very clever, Mr. Standish," laughed the Inspector, "but not quite clever
  enough. Both Miss Moody and Mr. Playfair knew of his intention. So how could
  he deny it? I say, sir, must you go on making that squeaking noise with the
  door?"</p>

  <p>"Both ways, you notice," said Ronald. "It creaks when it opens and it
  creaks when it shuts. Moreover, it shuts of its own accord. Very
  interesting."</p>

  <p>We stared at him in amazement, but he took no notice, and at last the
  Inspector turned to go, with a significant glance at me.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Inspector," said Ronald suddenly, "had the dead man got a
  brush in his hand?"</p>

  <p>"No; but one was lying on the floor beside him."</p>

  <p>"Was there any paint on it?"</p>

  <p>For a moment the Inspector looked nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"I really couldn't tell you at the moment," he said, and Ronald shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he remarked, "you surprise me. Get hold of it and
  examine it. And if there's paint on it, sit down and think things over,
  bearing in mind the fact that the door creaks."</p>

  <p>"And if there isn't paint on it?" said the other with ponderous
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"There will be," answered Ronald quietly.</p>

  <p>"Anything else you can suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but I don't think you're likely to do it."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Release that unfortunate chap, Daynton."</p>

  <p>"Release Daynton?" gasped the other.</p>

  <p>"Why not? For I can assure you that he had no more to do with the murder
  of Bernard Power than you or I had."</p>

  <p>"Then who did do it?"</p>

  <p>"I promise you shall know at the first possible moment," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Well, until I do," grinned the other, "Mr. Daynton remains under lock and
  key."</p>

  <p>Ronald was silent as we strolled back to the house, and I knew him too
  well to interrupt his reverie.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Bob," he said suddenly, as we neared the door, "say
  nothing&mdash;even to Miss Moody&mdash;about our thinking Daynton innocent.
  It might get round to the servants."</p>

  <p>She met us on the drive, and with her was a man of about forty-five, who
  we correctly surmised was her guardian, Mr. Playfair.</p>

  <p>"Well," she cried, after introducing us, "what luck?"</p>

  <p>Ronald shook his head. "Early days yet, Miss Moody," he said gravely.
  "I've seen the Inspector, and I'm bound to confess it doesn't look too
  good."</p>

  <p>"I blame myself very much," said her guardian, "but never in my wildest
  imagination did I dream of such a tragedy occurring."</p>

  <p>"In what way do you blame yourself, Mr. Playfair?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"In going out so early that morning. I ought to have waited here and been
  present at the interview. Hubert is such a hot headed chap."</p>

  <p>"But, Uncle John, he didn't do it!" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said the other sadly, "I wish I could think so. And let us hope
  that Mr. Standish succeeds in proving it. Candidly," he went on as she left
  us, "I wish she hadn't been to you. You understand how I mean it. The case is
  so painfully clear that I fear even you can do no good. And the sooner she
  realises it the better."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," agreed Ronald. "As you say, it's a pity you went out as
  early as you did."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wanted to get to Comber Ness by noon, and it's very nearly a four
  hours' run. I don't know whether my ward has told you," he went on, with a
  faint smile, "but I'm a most enthusiastic photographer. And I have just
  acquired a new toy. Are you by any chance interested?"</p>

  <p>"Very," said Ronald. "I do a bit that way myself."</p>

  <p>"Then come and have a drink, and I will show it to you." He led the way
  into the house and we followed him. "It is a stereoscopic camera," he
  explained, as he took it off a table in the hall. "And doubtless you know the
  principle on which it works. The two lenses are the same distance apart as
  one's eyes, and two negatives are taken at each exposure. Then by making
  positives and holding them in one of those machines that you probably
  remember from your early youth, the whole thing stands out as in real
  life."</p>

  <p>"And you went over to Comber Ness to get a photograph," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the other, and then gave a rueful laugh. "And didn't get
  it&mdash;at least, not what I wanted. I've only just got the machine. In
  fact, it was my first load of plates. Now, if you examine it, you will see a
  little number at one end of the plate-carrier. Every time you change a plate
  after taking a photo the number goes up one, so that you always know how many
  plates are left. The numbers range from one to twelve, and the night before
  Wilkinson, my butler, who is almost as keen as I am on it, happened to
  mention to me that number twelve was showing, which meant that there was only
  one more plate left. And I forgot all about it till I arrived at Comber
  Ness."</p>

  <p>"But one exposure was surely enough?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Quite&mdash;if I hadn't wanted to take two different views. It is, as you
  know, one of the most celebrated beauty spots of England, and I had promised
  an American friend of mine two photographs taken from totally separate
  points. And I had only one plate. So there was nothing for it but to use the
  camera as an ordinary one by covering one lens with a cap and taking one view
  on half the plate, and then covering the other lens and taking the second
  view on the other half. But, of course, it spoiled things from a stereoscopic
  point altogether. However, I'm glad to say they both came out well. I left
  them to be developed that day, and they were sent up this afternoon with the
  other eleven."</p>

  <p>He was examining some of the results as he was speaking, and at moment his
  ward came into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! Uncle John," she cried, "this is hardly the time
  photographs."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, dear," he said contritely. "The matter came up in the course of
  conversation with Mr. Standish. You see, this was the camera I was using that
  day at Comber Ness."</p>

  <p>She seemed sorry at having spoken so sharply, and laid her hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, old 'un," she said "So that's the new toy, is it? Can we
  see the pretty pictures?"</p>

  <p>"I've got to make the positives first," he answered. "These are the
  negatives."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all beyond me. And I thought they were going to be much
  bigger. Each of them seems just the same size as that other camera
  takes&mdash;the little one."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. This camera takes two identical pictures on every plate,
  each of which is the same size as the little one."</p>

  <p>"And when were these very goo views of the grounds here taken?" said
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Let the see. I think I took those the day before I went to Comber
  Ness."</p>

  <p>"A very fine machine," cried Ronald. "They are so clear cut. And these two
  separate ones of Comber Ness. Beautiful! Beautiful! I should very much like
  prints of those myself, if you would be good enough."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said our host. "Delighted. And now I expect you'd like to see
  your rooms."</p>

  <p>He led the way upstairs and, having told us the time of dinner, left us.
  And shortly after Ronald came sauntering into my room and sat on the bed.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Bob?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," I answered. "And though you may be perfectly clear in
  your own mind, old lad, that this man Daynton didn't do it, I don't see that
  you've got much forrader as to who did."</p>

  <p>He made no reply, and was staring out of the window as the butler knocked
  to find out if there was anything we wanted.</p>

  <p>"I hear you're very keen on photography, Wilkinson," said Ronald
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"In a small way I dabble in it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Playfair was telling me it was a great hobby of yours. What do you
  think of that new camera of his?"</p>

  <p>"I've only seen it once, sir. He asked me to tell him the number showing
  at the end. Twelve it was, I remember. That was the night before the tragedy,
  sir. I do hope that you may be able to do something for poor Mr. Daynton.
  Such a nice gentleman, sir."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too, Wilkinson. By the way, Mr. Playfair does most of his
  developing himself, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Invariably, sir," said the butler, looking faintly surprised.</p>

  <p>"But he had this last lot developed for him?" persisted Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He apparently lunched at Barminster on the day of the murder,
  and left them with a chemist there."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Wilkinson. No&mdash;nothing to drink."</p>

  <p>The butler left the room, and I stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You seem very interested in our host's photography," I said.</p>

  <p>"Bob;" he remarked, "if you had just bought a new stereoscopic camera and
  had motored over a hundred miles for a view, would you suddenly be so
  overcome by a promise given to an American friend that you wouldn't use your
  new acquisition as such?"</p>

  <p>"What in the name of fortune are you driving at?" I cried. "Anyway,
  whatever I might or might not do, we have seen what our host did. There's the
  proof in the negative. Why, good Lord, man, you can't suspect him."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say I did. I merely asked a question. You see, Bob, one thing is
  perfectly clear. A man who was at Comber Ness in the morning and arrived at
  Barminster for lunch could not possibly have left here as late as ten
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then?"</p>

  <p>"A perfect alibi. But it would have been an equally good alibi if he had
  carried out the same time-table and taken a stereoscopic picture there
  instead of two separate views. So again I ask&mdash;why those two different
  views?"</p>

  <p>"It must be the American," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Must it? Or is it because he couldn't take a stereoscopic picture?"</p>

  <p>"Then he couldn't have taken the other two?"</p>

  <p>"Sound logic," he grinned. "Well, time to change, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Ronald," I almost shouted, "what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The grin departed, and he looked at me gravely. "It means," he said, "that
  we are dealing with a particularly dangerous and unprincipled man, whose only
  slip up to date is that he did not expend a pennyworth of oil on the hinges
  of the summer-house door."</p>

  <p>And with that he left the room.</p>

  <p>All through the evening his words kept recurring to me, and the more I
  thought of them the more amazing did they become. It seemed to me he must be
  wrong, and yet Ronald Standish was not in the habit of making a definite
  statement without good reason. And when, next morning, he suddenly announced
  his intention of returning to London, I was even more dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The girl was terribly disappointed, and it struck me that his attempts at
  consolation were very half-hearted. He seemed to have lost interest in the
  case, though he gave her a few perfunctory words of hope.</p>

  <p>"I'll be back this evening, Miss Moody," he said, "and perhaps by then I
  may have something to report."</p>

  <p>But I heard him expressing a different opinion to our host when she was
  out of hearing. For some reason he did not want me to go with him, and so I
  spent most of the day with her trying to cheer her up. It was a little
  difficult, since I manifestly could not allude to the amazing hints he had
  dropped the preceding evening. In fact, the more I thought of them the more
  fantastic did they seem. If Ronald had a fault it was that he sometimes
  seemed to go out of his way to find a complicated solution to a thing when a
  simple one fitted the facts. And for the life of me I could not see wherein
  lay the difficulty over our host's explanation of the two different photos on
  the one plate.</p>

  <p>He returned about six, looking weary and dispirited, and my heart
  sank.</p>

  <p>"Waste of time, I fear," he said, as we all met him in the hall. "I'm
  afraid it's a case of going back to London for good."</p>

  <p>"And throwing up the case?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"I fear I was to blame, Miss Moody, in speaking too hopefully in my
  rooms," he said. "So if you could give orders for our things to be packed,
  we'll be getting along. By the way, Mr. Playfair, don't forget those two
  photographs you promised me."</p>

  <p>"I did them for you today," said our host. "I'll see if they are dry."</p>

  <p>He left the hall, and for a moment we were alone.</p>

  <p>"Got him, Bob," he said, and his eyes were blazing with excitement, "by an
  amazing piece of luck."</p>

  <p>But he was his apathetic self when Playfair returned with the prints.</p>

  <p>"Astoundingly good," he remarked, as he examined them. "How did you manage
  to do it, Mr. Playfair?"</p>

  <p>"Do what?" cried the other, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Avoid taking the steam-roller which has been standing idle in the centre
  of this particular view for the last ten days."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was dead silence, and I saw that every atom of colour
  had left our host's face.</p>

  <p>"I did not go to London today," went on Ronald. "I went to Comber Ness,
  where I took this photograph. Not fixed yet&mdash;but look at it."</p>

  <p>He flung it on the table; it was the same as the other. But in the centre
  was a steam-roller with a tarpaulin over it.</p>

  <p>"You devil!" screamed Playfair, and made a dash for the passage leading to
  the back of the house.</p>

  <p>"Hold him, Bob!" roared Ronald, and I collared him. He struggled like a
  maniac, but I kept him till Ronald came running back with the plate in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"He was going to destroy that," he cried. "Well, Mr. Playfair, have you
  any explanation as to why that steam-roller is missing from your photo?" And
  then with a sudden shout&mdash;"Stop him, Bob!"</p>

  <p>But it was too late. I felt his body relax in my arms, almost immediately
  after his hand came away from his mouth. Then he slithered to the
  floor&mdash;dead.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">"I'M blowed if I see how you did it, Mr. Standish."</p>

  <p>It was three hours later, and Inspector Savage was gazing at Ronald in
  undisguised admiration.</p>

  <p>"By starting with a theory diametrically opposed to yours," said Ronald.
  "You were convinced Hubert Daynton had done it; I was convinced he hadn't.
  Then who had? My first idea was that the murderer was some man Power had
  wronged&mdash;probably over some woman. He had been hiding near by, and had
  taken advantage of the quarrel he heard to do the deed and throw the
  suspicion on someone else. Then I suddenly realised the enormous significance
  of the fact that the door creaked, and shut of its own accord.</p>

  <p>"Now, Power was sitting at his easel some four yards from the door.
  Suppose the door was shut when the murderer entered; it would creak as he
  opened it. Suppose it was being kept open by the stone with which the deed
  was done; it would creak as it shut, after the stone was picked up. In either
  event it would creak.</p>

  <p>"Now, what does anybody do who hears a door creak behind him&mdash;
  especially if there has just been a quarrel and the creak may mean that the
  other person has returned? He looks over his shoulder to see who it is. And
  if he sees some enemy of his, someone he has wronged, he does not continue
  his job with his back to the newcomer. But Power went on with his painting.
  There fore the person he saw he did not regard as an enemy, but looked on as
  a friend. So much of a friend, in fact, that he did not object to this new
  arrival walking about behind his back&mdash;always an uncomfortable sensation
  unless your mind is completely at rest. And at once a very different
  complexion was put on the matter.</p>

  <p>"Then came my interview with Mr. John Playfair, and the question of the
  two separate pictures of different views of Comber Ness on the one
  plate&mdash;the point that puzzled you so much, Bob. You remember that when I
  said it might be because he couldn't take a stereoscopic picture, you
  countered by saying that in that case he equally could not have taken the two
  separate views. Which was right, up to a point. He couldn't have taken
  either, but that doesn't prevent a negative appearing on a plate.</p>

  <p>"The man was a skilled photographer, and he was faced with the necessity
  of proving to the world that he had been to Comber Ness. If he could do so he
  was safe. But since he had ho intention of going anywhere near Comber Ness,
  what was he to do? He knew that if you take a negative and make a positive
  from it, you can produce a second negative in a dark room on exactly the same
  principle as you produce a print. But he had no stereoscopic picture of
  Comber Ness; he'd only just bought the machine. What he had got were two
  separate views taken with his smaller camera!</p>

  <p>"So he makes two positives&mdash;you remember Miss Moody told us he was
  fiddling about in the dark room all the afternoon before the murder&mdash;and
  then he takes out his last stereoscopic plate. You see the importance of its
  being the last one; that accounted for his having to put them both on one
  plate. And that was why he took three unnecessary photos of his own grounds.
  On to that last plate he clips the two positives, side by side, exposes it in
  his dark room, and returns the plate to the camera. There is his alibi. He
  need never go near Comber Ness, and, in fact, he never did.</p>

  <p>"He had Wilkinson's evidence that twelve was the number showing&mdash;you
  noticed there, Bob, the slight discrepancy between Playfair's statement and
  the butler's. He had the chemist's evidence that the plates were handed over
  to him to be developed; he had the hotel evidence that he lunched at
  Barminster.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what he did we shall never know. He drove away at eight-thirty,
  and presumably concealed his car in some lane. Then he returned and hid near
  the summer-house. He was taking no risk up to date; if he was found there was
  no reason why he shouldn't be in his own grounds. And everything came off. He
  murdered Power, and drove quietly over to Barminster, where he lunched."</p>

  <p>"But why. this cold-blooded murder of a man he apparently liked?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The usual reason," he answered. "Once or twice after dinner last night I
  caught the look in his eyes as they rested on the girl. He was in love with
  her himself, which can account for many things. Why he took up Power at all I
  can't tell you&mdash;possibly at the beginning he had some idea of choking
  off Daynton by making him jealous. Then he may have feared that instead of
  doing that the artist's attentions to the girl might have the opposite result
  and bring Daynton and the girl closer together. Or perhaps he may have become
  jealous of Power himself. Anyway, he saw his opportunity of getting rid of
  both of them. And but for the astounding piece of luck of my finding that
  steam-roller where it was, he'd have gone darned near doing it. Being a
  clever man, he realised at once that his whole alibi had become worse than
  useless&mdash;it had become a rope round his neck. For what possible reason
  could there be, save the true one, for his saying he'd been to Comber Ness
  when he hadn't? That was why I was so off-hand today. At the first hint of
  suspicion he would have destroyed the plate and never given me the prints,
  trusting to the chemist's evidence that it had been a view of Comber
  Ness."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure I'm much obliged to you, Mr. Standish," said the
  Inspector. "Mr. Daynton has already been released."</p>

  <p>"And doubtless will provide the necessary consolation for Miss Moody,"
  said Ronald, with a smile. "For I don't think we need waste one second's pity
  on that singularly cold-blooded murderer."</p>

  <p>And it wasn't until we were driving into London that he turned to me
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I think the lie was justified, Bob, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"What lie?" I said.</p>

  <p>"That steam-roller only arrived at Comber Ness early this morning."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">II. &mdash; THE MISSING CHAUFFEUR</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was on a morning in late September that, happening to
  drop into Ronald Standish's rooms, I found a man with him whose face seemed
  familiar to me. He was sprawling in one of the easy chairs, smoking a
  cigarette, and he glanced up as I apologised for interrupting.</p>

  <p>"You're doing nothing of the sort, old boy," said Ronald. "In fact, you've
  arrived at a very propitious moment. Do you know the Duke of Dorset, known to
  most of the dear old schoolfellows as Catface? This"&mdash;he waved a hand at
  me&mdash;"is Bob Miller."</p>

  <p>The Duke grinned cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I was up in Town on business," he said, "and I suddenly remembered that
  Ronald sometimes did the sleuth act. So I called round to see him."</p>

  <p>"Not much sleuthing about this," laughed Ronald. "Bob&mdash;we are rising
  in business. We've now become a registry office for servants."</p>

  <p>"If somebody would explain," I murmured mildly, "it might be a little
  easier."</p>

  <p>"Catface has lost his chauffeur," Ronald remarked. "Hence his visit. But
  tell Bob the story. I'd like to hear it again."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a bit absurd, I must admit," said the Duke, "and there is
  probably some quite ordinary explanation. At the same time it's no use
  pretending that I'm not worried. My chauffeur has suddenly and mysteriously
  disappeared. He's been in our service for years; he was with my father. And
  he's vanished into thin air."</p>

  <p>"It's this way, Bob," said Ronald. "The man's name is Williams, and he
  lives with his wife in a cottage on the estate. By the way, are there any
  children?"</p>

  <p>"Two," said the Duke. "A boy and a girl&mdash;about ten and eight years
  old."</p>

  <p>"Well, it appears that the night before last Williams left his cottage
  just after seven o'clock, telling his wife that he was going down to the 'Bat
  and Ball' to have a pint&mdash;the 'Bat and Ball' being the chief pub in
  Medchester, which, as you know, is the village close to Catface's hovel.
  Apparently it was not an unusual thing for him to do, and Mrs. Williams
  thought nothing about it. But, as time went on and nine o'clock came with no
  sign of him, she began to get uneasy. So finally she rang up the 'Bat and
  Ball,' to find to her amazement that he had never been there. She still
  wasn't really alarmed. There was another pub to which he some times went. But
  that wasn't on the telephone, so all she could do was to wait. And wait she
  did until eleven o'clock, when she became genuinely frightened. So she put on
  a hat and went down into the village, a matter of ten minutes' walk. At that
  hour both the pubs were shut, but she beat up the two owners, only to find
  that her husband had not been to either of them that night.</p>

  <p>"By this time, of course, she was in a thorough panic. She could only
  assume that her husband had been taken ill or had had a fit on the way. So
  she got the local constable out of bed, and armed with a lantern the two of
  them searched the road the whole way back to her cottage, without, however,
  finding any trace of him. And that is as far as we go at the moment. Her
  husband did not return during the night. He had not returned when Catface
  left for London yesterday after lunch. And such is the story of the missing
  chauffeur."</p>

  <p>"Possibly he's back by now," I said.</p>

  <p>"I told his wife to wire me at the club if he returned," said the Duke.
  "You see, the extraordinary thing to my mind is that Williams, of all men,
  should act in such a way. It's as if one's butler suddenly stood on his head
  in the dining-room."</p>

  <p>"Probably suffering from loss of memory," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"But in that case surely he'd have been found yesterday!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Not of necessity, by any means," said Ronald. "It doesn't follow that
  he's remained in the neighbourhood. He had money. What was there to stop him
  wandering about all night, and then taking a train for somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"The only station within miles is Croyde Junction," said the Duke. "And
  he's as well known there as I am. Naturally I rang them up to ask, and no
  sign of him had been seen. I'm worried, old boy, not only because I'm
  genuinely attached to the fellow, but also because it's an infernal nuisance
  having to get a temporary chauffeur for the Grand Duke's visit."</p>

  <p>He saw my look of bewilderment and explained.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Duke Sergius is coming to stay with me next week. In the old
  pre-Bolshevik days he was one of the loud noises in Russia, and he was a
  great personal friend of my father's. And he has announced his intention of
  putting in two or three days with inc during his stay in England."</p>

  <p>"But do you think there is any connection between your chauffeur's
  disappearance and the Grand Duke's visit?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Probably I've got the wind up needlessly," he said, "but the possibility
  has occurred to me. He is a leader and mainspring of the Whites, and I know
  that his life has been threatened on several occasions."</p>

  <p>"Still, it is difficult to see how abducting your chauffeur is going to
  help them to carry out their threat. They can't possibly know whom you are
  going to engage in his place. They can't, so to speak, force a man on
  you."</p>

  <p>"I know all that," he agreed. "I've said it to myself over and over again.
  And still I can't get rid of the thought that there may be some
  connection."</p>

  <p>"Have you taken any steps to get another man?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"I told my agent to write about it," he said. "Honestly, old boy, I wish
  you'd come down for a few days." He leaned forward in his chair. "It's
  possible&mdash;perhaps probable&mdash;that I'm talking through the back of my
  neck. But I am uneasy. If it wasn't for the Grand Duke the thing would be
  quite different; I shouldn't have worried you. But I'd never forgive myself
  if anything happened while he was staying with me. Why doesn't Miller come,
  too? I can give you both some shooting. And I'd feel easier if you'd cast
  your eye over things."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled. "I've got no objection to trying to hit a few in the beak,
  old boy," he said. "And I don't suppose Bob has either. But I frankly think
  you are worrying yourself most unnecessarily about this man's disappearance.
  I'm convinced myself you'll find that there is some quite simple
  explanation."</p>

  <p>And at that we left it, after agreeing to motor down that afternoon.</p>

  <p>The Duke had arrived before us, and a glance at his face showed that
  further developments had taken place.</p>

  <p>"I've got Mrs. Williams here, Ronald," he said. "I want you to hear what
  she has to say. I'm terribly afraid there has been foul play."</p>

  <p>We followed him into a small writing-room, where a middle-aged woman, her
  eyes red with weeping, was waiting.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Williams," he went on, "I want you to tell these gentlemen
  exactly what you've told me. They've come down from London especially to see
  if they can do anything to help you."</p>

  <p>"I will, your Grace," she answered; "though I fear my poor Henry is beyond
  human aid. He'd never have gone away like that, without so much as a word to
  me, of his own free will."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you just tell us everything, Mrs. Williams," said Ronald
  gently. "I have already heard from his Grace the bare facts of your husband's
  disappearance. Now I want to hear further details."</p>

  <p>"Show Mr. Standish what you found today," said the Duke. She fumbled in
  her bag, and finally produced a sheet of paper, which she handed to Ronald.
  On it was written the following sentence in block capitals:</p>

  <p>MEET ME CROSS ROADS 7.30</p>

  <p>"And where did you find this?" asked Ronald, holding it up to the
  light.</p>

  <p>"In my husband's livery, sir," she answered. "There was a hole in the top
  pocket, and as I was folding it up and putting it away this morning I felt
  this rustle in the lining."</p>

  <p>"Which cross-roads does it refer to?"</p>

  <p>"There are cross-roads half-way between the cottage and Medchester," said
  the Duke.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ronald. "So for the moment, at any rate, we'll assume that
  that is the spot alluded to. Now, Mrs. Williams, you say you found this in
  your husband's livery. Did he wear it on the day he disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He came in about six o'clock and changed."</p>

  <p>"Was he in his usual spirits, or did he seem at all worried?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly worried, sir, but rather quiet like."</p>

  <p>"In other words, different from what he generally was?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, sir&mdash;he was a little. And yet not enough to make me
  remark on it at the time. Though what with one thing and another and getting
  the children to bed, I didn't have much chance of speaking."</p>

  <p>"And he's said nothing to you in the last few days which could throw any
  light on this note?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir." And then she hesitated. "Well, there was one little thing,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Out with it," said Ronald. "It's the little things we want."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, about four days ago, or perhaps five, he did say to me that
  there was a lot of wicked scoundrels in the world. And he said it as if there
  was something at the back of his mind."</p>

  <p>"Did you ask him what he meant?" cried the Duke.</p>

  <p>"I didn't, your Grace," she said. "He was just going out, and after that
  it slipped my memory."</p>

  <p>"So there's really nothing more you can tell us, Mrs. Williams?" said
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I can't think of anything."</p>

  <p>"And your children noticed nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I haven't told them yet. I've just let them think their daddy
  has gone away for two or three days." She clasped her hands together. "Oh,
  sir&mdash;do you think there's any hope?"</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! yes, Mrs. Williams," cried Ronald cheerfully. "You go back
  to your cottage and keep your spirits up. I shall probably be along that way
  shortly myself. By the way, there is one more question I want to ask you. Has
  your husband got any friends or acquaintances who are not English?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of, sir," she answered. "If he has, he's never mentioned
  it to me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Williams. Now, don't forget what I said: keep
  cheerful."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Ronald?" said the Duke, as the door closed behind
  her.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all at the moment," Ronald answered, "except the one
  significant fact in that note."</p>

  <p>He put it on the table.</p>

  <p>"Look at that seven. Have you ever seen an Englishman make a seven with a
  horizontal line across it? Whereas a lot of Europeans do. I don't say it's
  conclusive, but it's more than likely that the writer has lived a lot abroad.
  Question number two. Is it a man or a woman? No answer possible from what
  we've got at present. From what you tell me, Williams is not the sort of man
  who would play the fool with a girl."</p>

  <p>"Most emphatically not," said the Duke.</p>

  <p>"But, on the other hand, he might be taken in by a sob-stuff story and
  think he could help, someone. So, as I said, we do not know if it's a man or
  a woman. All we can say is that the loss of memory theory is out of court,
  and that he left the house to keep a definite assignation."</p>

  <p>"Which looks bad to me," said the Duke. "For nothing will make me believe
  that he would not have communicated with me if he'd been able to."</p>

  <p>"It has that appearance, Catface," agreed Ronald. "However, we may as well
  go and have a look at the place, though I don't suppose we'll find anything
  after such a lapse of time."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," said the Duke. "There is ample time before
  dinner."</p>

  <p>We strolled across the park, and after we had gone about half a mile he
  pointed to two cottages ahead of us.</p>

  <p>"One of those is Williams's," he remarked; "the other belongs to the head
  keeper."</p>

  <p>"I think we'll start at the cross-roads first," said Ronald. "Has anybody
  except the local constable been over the ground?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you," answered the Duke. "I told my agent to do all he
  could, and to get in touch with the police at Dorchester.
  Incidentally&mdash;talk of the devil&mdash;Well, Johnson, any fresh
  developments?"</p>

  <p>A middle-aged man in riding breeches was coming towards us, and his
  expression was grave.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to say there are, your Grace," he said. "About thirty yards up
  the road leading to Cantrell's farm the undergrowth at one side is all beaten
  down. There is blood on the grass, and every appearance of a desperate
  struggle having taken place."</p>

  <p>The Duke turned to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," he remarked. "That's the spot we're making for."</p>

  <p>He introduced us to the agent, and we all four walked on together.</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to report to you," continued Johnson. "He must have
  been set on by someone in the darkness, and in the struggle gone swaying up
  that side road. That's Inspector Morrison from Dorchester in front of us now.
  It was he who discovered it."</p>

  <p>The Inspector saluted as we came up and led us to the spot. "Pretty clear
  what happened, your Grace," he said. "Though why anyone should want to
  assault Mr. Williams is beyond me. Case of mistaken identity, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Not that, Inspector," remarked Ronald, handing him the note. "This has
  just been found in his coat. He was deliberately decoyed here."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he was peering at the ground carefully.</p>

  <p>"Is this track much used?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very little," answered Johnson, "and mainly by Cantrell."</p>

  <p>"Has Cantrell got a car?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but it's been out of action for the last week. A big end
  went."</p>

  <p>"Well, a car has been standing here comparatively recently. You can see
  the impression on the grass if you look closely."</p>

  <p>He straightened up and his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"Things look much worse than I thought, Catface," he said in a low voice.
  "It's hardly conceivable that the mark of that car at this particular spot
  should have no connection with the struggle. So it boils down to the fact
  that the whole affair was definitely planned. But why the deuce anybody
  should want to kidnap your chauffeur is a bit of a poser."</p>

  <p>He turned to the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"You haven't by any chance heard of any foreigners being in the
  neighbourhood?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Inspector shook his head, but Johnson swung round at once.</p>

  <p>"Funny you should ask that, Mr. Standish. There's been a woman&mdash;
  quite young&mdash;staying at the 'Bat and Ball' recently. And two or three
  days ago she was joined by two men who arrived by car. They all left that
  night. By Jove! it was the very day of this affair, now that I come to think
  of it."</p>

  <p>"But why do you imagine that they were foreigners?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Cheadle&mdash;the landlord&mdash;told me they were," said Johnson.
  "Apparently they all spoke English perfectly, but amongst themselves they
  used some other language."</p>

  <p>"Well, Inspector," said Ronald, "there's something for you to go on. That
  note was almost certainly written by a foreigner, and now we hear that three
  foreigners were staying at the 'Bat and Ball' on the day of Williams's
  disappearance and left in a car that night. Moreover, a car stood here
  recently."</p>

  <p>"Not much proof anywhere, sir," said the Inspector doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"None at all," agreed Ronald. "But if there is no connection, it is an
  extraordinary chain of coincidence. If I were you, I'd try to get a
  description of those people from Cheadle, and put some quiet inquiries on
  foot. It's just within the bounds of possibility that someone might have
  noticed the number of their car."</p>

  <p>He turned to the Duke.</p>

  <p>"And that, it seems to me, is all that we can do. Sorry not to be more
  helpful, old boy, but the business of tracking car and people is beyond me.
  It's a police job pure and simple."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you're right, Ronald, do you think they've killed him?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. I don't know, There's a lot of blood about. The
  struggle was pretty desperate. All that one can do is to hope that he's only
  been laid out."</p>

  <p>"Lord! but I wish I could get to the bottom of this," cried the Duke in a
  worried voice. We were walking back over the park towards the house. "I'm
  infernally sorry for Williams&mdash;poor devil!" he went on&mdash;"but what's
  the object of the thing?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Ronald slowly, "it seems to me that there are two possible
  alternatives which suggest themselves at once. The first one is that they
  made some suggestion to him which he resented so much that they had this
  fight. The second one is rather more sinister. They decoyed him there in
  order to abduct him, so that someone else might be substituted in his
  place&mdash; someone who might prove more amenable to this suggestion."</p>

  <p>The Duke stopped and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What sort of suggestion?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I did not think so at first," said Ronald, "but with these fresh
  developments, old boy, I am bound to admit that I'm beginning to agree with
  your original suspicion that it's got something to do with your visitor of
  next week. Otherwise the whole thing is absolutely incomprehensible."</p>

  <p>"What the devil am I to do?" cried the other. "Shall I make some excuse
  and put him off?"</p>

  <p>"You can hardly do that on what we've got up to date. We may be entirely
  wrong. All you can do is to vet the new man when he comes very thoroughly,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Hallo! a new development. What does Mrs. Williams want?" She was running
  across the grass towards us, waving her arms, and evidently in a state of
  considerable excitement.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace," she gasped as she came up, "this has just come." In her hand
  she held a letter which she brandished in the air. "Steady, Mrs. Williams,"
  he said soothingly. "Let's have a look at it."</p>

  <p>"It's from Henry, sir." She turned to Ronald. "But look at the
  writing."</p>

  <p>And Ronald was looking at the writing with a face grown suddenly grave.
  For its colour was reddish brown, and it looked as if the wrong end of a
  penholder had been used, so thick were the letters. The envelope was
  addressed to "Mrs. Williams, Lilac Cottage, Medchester," and was stained with
  mud and dirt.</p>

  <p>"Read what's inside, sir," she cried.</p>

  <p>The contents consisted of a double sheet of paper on which two words were
  written, also in reddish brown:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Harvey petrol.</p>

  <p>"Harvey!" cried the Duke, who was looking over Ronald shoulder. "Why,
  that's the local garage."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Ronald thoughtfully. "You are sure this is your
  husband's writing, Mrs. Williams?"</p>

  <p>"Positive, sir. Besides, I know the paper. You see that little W in the
  corner, and Henry always carried some in his pocket-book. And envelopes. What
  does it mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Postmark&mdash;Belton. Where's Belton?"</p>

  <p>"Next village to Medchester on the London road," said the Duke</p>

  <p>"Then, your Grace, he must be there," she cried. "But why has he used that
  funny-coloured ink? And why is the envelope so dirty?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you mustn't build on the hope that your husband is at Belton,
  Mrs. Williams," said Ronald gravely. "In fact, I'm sorry to have to tell, you
  some bad news."</p>

  <p>"He's not dead, sir?" she said piteously.</p>

  <p>"No, no. I don't think for a moment he's dead. But I'm afraid he's been
  badly hurt."</p>

  <p>"Can I go to him, sir?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"We don't know where he is, Mrs. Williams."</p>

  <p>"But, look here, Ronald," said the Duke, who had been studying the
  envelope, "the date of the postmark is today."</p>

  <p>"Which shows that it was posted today, but not that it was written today.
  This letter was thrown out of the car in which he was travelling, and fell in
  the mud. Evidently today somebody found it and put it in the post."</p>

  <p>"How on earth can you tell that?" demanded the Duke incredulously.</p>

  <p>But Ronald did not answer. Instead, he turned to the woman. "Will you
  leave this with me, Mrs. Williams? I'll take great care of it. And the
  instant we know anything about your husband we'll let you know."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. I'm sure, sir, you will."</p>

  <p>She curtsied, and went stumbling back to her cottage.</p>

  <p>"Now, Ronald," cried the Duke, when she was out of hearing, "how do you
  know this letter wasn't written today?"</p>

  <p>"Because I recognised at once the ink that had been used. It's blood,
  Catface. And from the colour it's considerably more than one day old."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" gasped the Duke. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure. Somehow or other Williams managed to write this, using his
  own blood as an ink. He knew that if his wife got it she would bring it to
  you. It must be a warning of sorts, but what it means is somewhat
  obscure."</p>

  <p>"We always do get our petrol from Harvey." said the Duke. "His is the only
  garage within miles."</p>

  <p>Ronald put the letter carefully in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"It's one of the most extraordinary cases I've ever struck," he said. "And
  at the moment I don't see one ray of light."</p>

  <p>That state of affairs continued for the next week. The new chauffeur, a
  man by the name of Groves, arrived with the most impeccable references, two
  of them from people known personally to all of us. Harvey, whose garage we
  visited casually, proved to be a typical West Countryman with a jovial face
  and a cheery manner: a man who, if appearances ever count for anything, was
  as honest and straight as could be found in Dorsetshire. Cheadle, with whom
  we had a pint or two, gave us as closely as he could a description of the
  three foreigners, but, as Ronald had anticipated, it proved quite useless. It
  would have fitted a hundred people equally well. And the mystery of
  Williams's whereabouts remained as profound as ever.</p>

  <p>It was not until two days before the Grand Duke's arrival that any further
  development took place. Ronald and I were strolling through the village on
  our way back to lunch, when Johnson, the Duke's agent, came out of the "Bat
  and Ball" and hurried towards us.</p>

  <p>"That woman is back," he said. "Returned this morning."</p>

  <p>"Is she, by Jove?" cried Ronald. "We'll come in and have a drink. I'd like
  to have a look at her without her knowing it."</p>

  <p>"Good morning, gentlemen," cried Cheadle, as we entered the bar. "That
  lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three pints, Mr. Cheadle, please," interrupted Ronald quickly, at the
  same time giving him a warning frown. "And have something yourself."</p>

  <p>The room was full of the usual crowd that gathers in a village inn at
  midday, and after a cursory glance round Ronald dismissed them. At the same
  time, he did not relax his caution.</p>

  <p>"Not a word, please, Mr. Cheadle," he said, in a low voice. "I want to see
  that lady without raising her suspicions. Is she having lunch here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then my friends and I will lunch here, too. Give me a table where I can
  get a good look at her."</p>

  <p>And for half an hour, in the intervals of trying to masticate the so-
  called cold beef, we were able to study the woman at our leisure. And it must
  be admitted that the insult to our digestion was not worth it. Just a
  distinctly pretty young foreigner having lunch by herself in an English
  inn&mdash;that and nothing more. And yet the clue to so much lay under that
  tight-fitting little hat.</p>

  <p>"Bob, I'm flummoxed," said Ronald, as we left the inn. "Absolutely
  flummoxed. Why has she come back? What is the connecting link? There must be
  one. No woman like that is going to stay at the 'Bat and Ball' for fun. But
  we've got no proof: nothing but two or there apparently unconnected facts.
  What is the link? Are we being damned stupid, or is it really something that
  we couldn't know yet?"</p>

  <p>And that night I heard him pacing up and down, his room for hours, until
  at length I fell asleep.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">EVEN now, after the lapse of years, I sometimes wake up
  sweating at the nearness of the thing. But for one tiny slip on their part,
  and Ronald's extraordinary quickness in realising its significance, one of
  the most atrocious crimes of modern times would have succeeded. Many garbled
  accounts have appeared in the Press. Now for the first time I will set down
  the real truth of that amazing plot.</p>

  <p>It occurred on the second day of the Grand Duke's visit. A ceremonial call
  on a former British Ambassador who lived some fifty miles away had been
  arranged, and at eleven o'clock the car drew up at the door. Groves was
  driving, and seated beside him was the man who passed as the Grand Duke's
  secretary, but who was in reality a highly-placed Secret service man. Behind
  sat the Grand Duke and his host. The car rolled away, some of the house party
  watching it depart. Nothing could have been more normal. And then two minutes
  after it had gone a chance remark of Johnson's threw the spark into the
  powder magazine.</p>

  <p>"Never seen the Duke so angry in my life," he said, "as he was with that
  new chauffeur a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"What was the trouble?" asked someone perfunctorily.</p>

  <p>"He'd let the car run practically dry of petrol."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>Ronald's voice came like a pistol shot, and then things moved.</p>

  <p>"Bob&mdash;get the bus. Move, man, move!"</p>

  <p>I raced towards the garage, and was back inside a minute with the Bentley,
  to find Ronald waiting. He boarded her whilst she was still moving, leaving a
  crowd of surprised guests staring after us. He flung himself down in the seat
  beside me, and with a little thrill I felt something hard in his pocket
  pressed against my thigh. Whilst I had got the car, he had got his
  revolver.</p>

  <p>"The tank of Catface's car was full last night, Bob," he said quietly. "I
  had a look at it on purpose. Stamp on the gas, boy."</p>

  <p>And three minutes later we were in the village. In front of us was the
  Rolls outside Harvey's garage, filling up from the petrol pump.</p>

  <p>"Pull up just behind her," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>His eyes were darting in every direction, but at the moment the scene
  looked harmless enough. The village street was almost deserted save for a
  powerful-looking racing car outside the "Bat and Ball," and Harvey and his
  assistant, who were manipulating the pump. The secret service man had
  descended and was standing by the window on the side of the Grand Duke. The
  chauffeur, having watched the filling for a few moments, had returned to the
  driving seat. At length the operation was over; the pipe was held up to let
  the last drops out; the gauze filter of the car was put back in the tank; the
  cap was screwed on. And a moment later they were away.</p>

  <p>"Seems all in order, old boy," I said.</p>

  <p>He did not answer; only stared after the back of the retreating car. And
  suddenly his eyes narrowed, and without a word he raced down the street after
  it. Stopped, picked something up in the road, and came back towards me like a
  madman.</p>

  <p>"Get her going!" he roared. "And chase the Rolls."</p>

  <p>He fell in beside me, and I saw that he held in his hand a gauze filter.
  Even then I didn't get it. Evidently the assistant had forgotten to put it
  back in the tank, and any time would do to return it. And at that moment the
  roar of the racing car behind us drowned our own machine.</p>

  <p>"They're after us," said Ronald, through set teeth. "And they've got our
  legs. Saw the curtains moving in the inn and I knew we were being watched.
  The woman and two men."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" I cried. "Let her all out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, until I tell you otherwise."</p>

  <p>The road was twisty for the first mile, and we swung round corners with
  the other car on our tail. In the glass on the screen I could see their faces
  at times, and suddenly I saw one of them stand up and draw a revolver from
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Look out," I howled. "They're trying gun work."</p>

  <p>"Are they, by gosh?" said Ronald, kneeling up on the seat and facing
  backwards. "Two can play at that game. Swerve about a bit, Bob, till he's
  fired."</p>

  <p>Came a crack and the pilot lamp shattered.</p>

  <p>"Now keep her steady."</p>

  <p>For about a hundred yards the road was straight, and I could see them all
  in the mirror. And then it happened. Ronald fired, and the car behind us
  seemed to swerve like a mad thing across the road. I had a vision in the
  glass of wheels upside down; heard a frightful crash; then silence save for
  the roar of our own engine.</p>

  <p>"I burst their front tyre for them," said Ronald quietly, sitting down
  again. "And now then, Bob, every ounce of juice."</p>

  <p>His face was cold and set, but I could feel the nervous tension of him.
  And still half dazed I drove on&mdash;drove as I have never driven before or
  since&mdash;drove till we saw a minute or two later the Rolls in front of
  us.</p>

  <p>"Keep your horn going," he cried, standing up and waving his arms
  violently.</p>

  <p>At last we saw Catface look round, then turn and give an order to Groves.
  The car slowed down and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Pull up beside 'em, but stand by to move on," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>We reached them, and Ronald yelled his orders.</p>

  <p>"Fall into this car for your lives!" he shouted. "Hurry! For God's sake,
  hurry!"</p>

  <p>They tumbled in a heap into the back of the Bentley.</p>

  <p>"Drive on, Bob. Stamp on it again."</p>

  <p>And I suppose I'd gone fifty yards when it happened. There came a
  deafening explosion, and the Rolls seemed literally to split in two. The
  whole of the back part flew in pieces, and what was left became in half a
  second a raging inferno of flames. For a while we watched it in awe-struck
  silence, and then the Grand Duke lit a cigarette and turned to his host.</p>

  <p>"Cutting it a trifle fine, I think. Do all your cars do that, my dear
  fellow?"</p>

  <p>"How did you find out, Ronald?" said the other shakily.</p>

  <p>But Ronald was staring at Groves, who had turned as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>"Who got at you?" he said sternly. "And how much were you paid for
  emptying the tank?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir," he cried. "Before God, I swear it. It was a lady, your
  Grace, who had never seen his Royal Highness, and she begged me to stop the
  car in the village so that she could have a closer look at him. She wanted to
  take a photograph, and she suggested emptying the tank."</p>

  <p>"You damned scoundrel!" roared the Duke. "How came that infernal bomb or
  whatever it was into the car?"</p>

  <p>"That he is not responsible for, old boy," said Ronald quietly. "Harvey's
  assistant is the man who did it. But whether he knew it was a bomb or not I
  can't say. Turn the car round, Bob. There are one or two little things to be
  cleared up."</p>

  <p>And the first of them was soon done. The car that had pursued us had
  turned clean over and crashed down a steep bank, killing all three
  occupants.</p>

  <p>"They started some shooting practice at us, as you can see," said Ronald,
  pointing to the shattered lamp. "So I retaliated, and was lucky enough to
  burst one of their front tyres."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, Mr. Standish," remarked the Grand Duke, "you seem to be a man
  after my own heart. Though I am still not quite clear why, if you saw the
  bomb being put in, you did not warn us at the time."</p>

  <p>"Because, sir, I did not realise then that it was a bomb. I thought the
  assistant was putting back the gauze filter, and it was not until it fell off
  the back of the car as you drove off that I realised that what he had put in
  was something else. Sheer luck. No skill of mine. Had you gone another thirty
  yards before it slipped off, and rounded the corner out of sight, the death
  roll would have been in our camp, I fear. But&mdash;it did slip off, and I
  saw it. It was a certainty then as to what had happened, confirmed by their
  immediate pursuit of us."</p>

  <p>And that is the true story of one of the most sensational cases of the
  past few years. Harvey's assistant proved to be almost a half-wit who had
  been bribed by one of the men to put the time bomb in the tank, having been
  told by him that it was a patent device for increasing mileage. And Williams,
  who had been kept a close prisoner in a house on the outskirts of London,
  returned to the Duke's service. It transpired that the woman had made the
  same suggestion to him as she did to Groves, and on his refusing indignantly,
  the two men had sprung on him out of the darkness. She had previously pitched
  him some yarn about being persecuted, and he had met her on one or two
  occasions. In fact, the only remaining thing left to chronicle was the
  arrival, a few days later, at Ronald's rooms of a beautiful little clock. And
  on the back of it was engraved:<br></p>

  <p class="sign">"Guaranteed not to explode. Sergius."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">III. &mdash; THE HAUNTED RECTORY</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">THE fact that Ronald Standish was amply provided with this
  world's goods was a great advantage to him in more ways than one. In the
  first place, it allowed him to pick and choose his cases, since the question
  of a fee did not enter into matters. He worked for the sheer interest of the
  thing, and the utmost I have ever known him ask were his out-of-pocket
  expenses. Often, indeed, he dispensed with these if his client was not well
  off. There was one example I remember in which they were considerable, but
  since he was working for a woman whose husband had been killed in the War,
  leaving her extremely poor, he refused to accept a penny.</p>

  <p>But he derived benefit from his pecuniary position in another and not
  quite such an obvious manner. Acting competely on his own as he did, taking
  cases only when he felt like it (I have known periods of six months when he
  hasn't handled one at all), he was not habitually rubbing shoulders with the
  criminal classes in the way his professional confreres had to do. And,
  consequently, he was not known by sight to any large number of the people he
  was up against. Which, in view of the fact that no one looked less like a
  detective than he, was on certain occasions an immense help.</p>

  <p>At the same time, there was but little reciprocity about the matter. It
  was the exact opposite to the old proverb Tom Fool. There were very few of
  the big men that Standish did not know by sight, and his was the type of
  memory that never forgot a face. He made a point of attending, as a casual
  spectator, any trial that promised to be of the slightest interest. But
  unless it justified its promise, he rarely stayed longer than was necessary
  to memorise the features of the prisoner. And so stored away in his brain was
  an immense gallery of portraits that he could inspect at will&mdash;an asset
  of incalculable value on occasions. And one such occasion was the strange
  case of the Haunted Rectory, a case which also illustrated his astounding
  quickness at spotting little things which other people missed. I was one of
  the other people!</p>

  <p>It was early in April when he and I arrived at the small Cornish town of
  St. Porodoc. We were on a golfing holiday, and having sampled Saunton and
  Westward Ho! we wandered farther west till we reached a course which,
  according to its own members, at any rate, was better than either of them.
  And assuredly it was a beautiful piece of golfing country. Moreover, not
  being so widely known as its more illustrious neighbours, there was no crowd.
  In fact, Ronald found a certain amount of difficulty in getting a level game.
  His handicap was scratch, whereas I regret to state that mine has never
  descended into the realms of single figures. And since the Easter crowd had
  not yet arrived the field was a little limited. However, he played the best
  ball of the secretary and myself on two or three occasions, and it was at the
  nineteenth hole after one such match that the incidents I am about to relate
  started.</p>

  <p>The secretary, Maxwell&mdash;a retired Naval officer&mdash;was a man after
  our own hearts. And I remember that he was in the middle of a story when the
  door of the club-house swung open, and he stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Vicar!" he sang out cheerily. "How's the ghost?" The new-comer was
  a charming-looking old man, with the fresh complexion that only years of
  living in the country can preserve. His grey hair was still plentiful; his
  eyes clear and bright, but at the secretary's question his expression clouded
  over.</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse," he said ruefully. "Maguire says he's going."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! That's bad," cried the other, with a whistle of surprise. "By
  the way, let me introduce our vicar&mdash;Mr. Greycourt. This is Mr. Standish
  and Mr. Miller."</p>

  <p>The clergyman bowed and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I think I will have something," he remarked. "I'm so worried I
  don't know what to do. The whole thing seems to me so absurd."</p>

  <p>"It's certainly a pity if Maguire goes," said Maxwell. "And, by the same
  token, Standish, it's unfortunate it's Lent, otherwise you could have had a
  round or two with him. He'd have given you a good game."</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble about Lent?" remarked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Marguire is my curate," explained the vicar, "and the dear fellow won't
  play golf in Lent. He says he'll see me through Easter, Maxwell, and then he
  won't stay any more."</p>

  <p>"Which means he won't get a game on these links at all," said the
  secretary. "Surely something can be done to make him alter his mind,
  Vicar?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse my butting in," said Ronald, with a smile, "but at the moment it's
  all rather confusing."</p>

  <p>"And very boring, too, it must be, to a stranger," said the vicar
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," cried Ronald. "Let's hear all about it, and possibly I might
  be able to suggest something."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I should be eternally grateful if you could," said the other.
  "Well, then, Maguire came to me some weeks ago&mdash;a delightful young
  fellow in every way&mdash;tall, upstanding, a typical British sportsman, and
  exactly the sort of man that we want today in the Church. So much did I feel
  that, in fact, that after he had been with me for two or three days I had a
  very serious conversation with him.</p>

  <p>"'My boy,' I said, 'don't think for a moment that what I am going to say
  to you is inspired by anything but a sense of duty. The only reason that I
  applied for a curate is that with advancing years I find this straggling
  parish too much for my old legs. But I never dreamed that a man of your
  ability and charm of manner would arrive. You are wasted here, Maguire. You
  should be in some big centre, where your talent will not be hidden under a
  bushel.'</p>

  <p>"He smiled and thanked me for the compliment. And then he explained his
  reasons for coming. It appeared that he had had a serious illness, and he
  thought a few months of Cornish air would pull him together.</p>

  <p>"'Moreover, sir,' he went on with a smile, 'I must confess to another
  thing. The fame of the St. Porodoc links has reached as far as London. And
  once Lent is over, I hope to have many a round over the course.'"</p>

  <p>"Is he a very star-turn golfer?" put in Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Apparently he was in the running for his blue," said Maxwell, "so he must
  be fairly hot stuff. But he arrived after the beginning of Lent, so I've
  never seen him play. In fact, I've only seen him once, and then it was in the
  distance."</p>

  <p>"I think he goes on the principle of keeping as far as possible from
  temptation," said the vicar with a smile. "I know nothing about the game
  myself, and so I fear I can't tell you how good he is, but he is certainly
  extraordinarily keen. However, that is only a side issue. To return to the
  main point: you must know, Mr. Standish, that I am unmarried, and the
  vicarage, though very comfortable, is too big for one man. And so when
  Maguire arrived I suggested to him that he should take up his quarters with
  me."</p>

  <p>He paused to sip his drink, and it struck me that I had seldom met a more
  perfectly delightful old man.</p>

  <p>"He fell in with the idea at once," the vicar continued, "and I placed at
  his disposal a sitting-room of his own. Our meals we take together, but I
  considered it essential that he should have his own den to go to when he
  wanted it. And for a week everything went swimmingly. Almost every evening we
  talked together for an hour or two before retiring, and then during the day
  he was out getting In touch with my parishioners.</p>

  <p>"I think it was on the eighth day after he came that I noticed he was
  looking a little worried at breakfast, and asked him if anything was
  wrong.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing, sir&mdash;nothing,' he answered, but I wasn't satisfied.</p>

  <p>"'My dear boy,' I said, 'there's no good saying that. Something has upset
  you. Come now: out with it.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment or two he hesitated; then he looked across the table at
  me.</p>

  <p>"'It seems a ridiculous thing to say, sir,' he said, 'but is this house
  haunted?'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him, speechless. It. was the last thing I expected him to
  say.</p>

  <p>"'God bless my soul!' I cried at length, 'not that I've ever heard of.
  Why?'</p>

  <p>"'Last night,' he said quietly, 'I awoke quite suddenly. The moon was
  shining through a chink in the curtains, and in its light, standing at the
  foot of the bed, I saw a man. At first I thought it was you, and I asked you
  what you wanted. And then, as I became more fully awake, I realised it wasn't
  you, but someone I had never seen. At once the thought of burglars entered my
  mind, and I sprang out of bed. And as I did so, the man vanished. I lit my
  candle to make sure. The room was empty. Then I looked at my watch. It was
  just two o'clock.'</p>

  <p>"He resumed his breakfast, and for a moment or two I felt nonplussed. That
  the thing was merely a dream I felt convinced, but Maguire had spoken so
  quietly, and with such a complete absence of any excitement, that I hesitated
  to say so. And then took the words out of my mouth.</p>

  <p>"'Probably a nightmare, sir,' he remarked 'and yet it was very real.
  Perhaps that second whack of cream with Martha's pastie last night. I mustn't
  fall again.'</p>

  <p>"And so it passed off, and I thought no more about it until three days
  later, when it was my turn to be awakened&mdash;this time by footsteps
  outside my door. I slipped on a dressing-gown, and went into the passage.
  From the hall below me came the flickering light of a candle, and peering
  over the banisters I saw Maguire.</p>

  <p>"'What is it?' I called out, and he looked up and saw me.</p>

  <p>"'No nightmare now, sir,' he said a little shakily. 'I've had my visitor
  again, and this time he didn't vanish. He went through the door, and I
  followed him down here. And then he just disappeared into the wall.'</p>

  <p>"'Come, come, Maguire,' I cried testily, 'this is absurd.'</p>

  <p>"'So would I have said a week ago,' he answered gravely. 'Now I know it is
  not. Mr. Greycourt&mdash;this house is haunted.'</p>

  <p>"'Then why have I never seen anything?' I demanded.</p>

  <p>"He had no answer to that. He couldn't tell me. But I was unable to shake
  his conviction. I suggested he should change his bedroom, and he did
  so&mdash;at first with good results. For three or four nights nothing
  happened. Then the ghostly visitor appeared to him again. I sat up with him,
  but whenever I did so we saw nothing. And last night it came to him once
  more. I was awakened by a noise downstairs that sounded like a window
  shutting. Then I heard his footsteps outside my door. His face was white and
  his agitation was obvious.</p>

  <p>"'It's getting on my nerves, sir!' he cried. 'I don't think I can go on
  much longer. It vanished into the wall again.'</p>

  <p>"'I thought I heard a window bang,' I said, but he shook his head, so it
  was apparently something else that woke me. And, to cut a long story short,
  this morning at breakfast he told me that be felt he couldn't stay. He would
  remain to help me over the Easter celebrations, but after that he must go.
  Naturally I was greatly upset, but what can I do? The poor fellow is going to
  pieces. It is unfair to ask him to remain. But I shall never be able to
  replace him with anyone I like so well. And even if I did get a satisfactory
  successor, how do I know that the same thing won't happen to him?"</p>

  <p>Ronald had listened with the closest attention to the vicar's story, and
  before making any comment he carefully filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"What servants have you, Mr. Greycourt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Old Martha, who has been with me for years, is the cook. And I have a
  younger girl who does the rest of the work."</p>

  <p>"Have either of them ever seen this ghost?"</p>

  <p>"No. And no mention has been made of it to them. You know what servants
  are, and Maguire quite agreed with me that it would be folly to alarm them.
  But do you really believe in such manifestations, Mr. Standish?"</p>

  <p>"Evidently your curate does," said Ronald dryly. "And as far as I myself
  am concerned I keep an open mind. Personally I have never seen one. At the
  same time, so many people of integrity have, at various times, vouched for
  their existence that it would be a bold man who denied their possibility. At
  the same time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He relapsed into thoughtful silence, and I looked at him curiously. The
  story was one of the last that I should have thought would have interested
  his practical brain.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose," said the vicar, rising, "that there is nothing to be
  done."</p>

  <p>"As far as the departure of your curate is concerned, nothing that I can
  see," answered Ronald, "But if it would be of any assistance to you, I should
  be only too delighted to come up to your house and have a look round."</p>

  <p>"Will you both come to lunch tomorrow and discuss it with Maguire?" he
  cried, and Ronald nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," he answered. "We'll be there."</p>

  <p>"What do you really make of it?" said Maxwell as the door closed behind
  the old clergyman.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at the moment," said Ronald. "But there is one possible point of
  interest. I don't profess to be well up in ghostly I lore, but from what I
  have read on the subject I have always believed that a ghost haunted a
  locality and not a person. Now in this case it is Maguire who is haunted. No
  one else has seen it now or ever before. It arrived, so to speak, with the
  curate. I wonder if it will depart with him?"</p>

  <p>And once again he relapsed into silence, which remained unbroken till we
  all three rose to go and dress for dinner.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">THE vicarage, which we found next day without difficulty,
  was a rambling old house about half a mile from the top of the cliffs. A
  well-kept garden lay in front, and as we opened the gate a tall young man
  straightened up from a flower bed where he was working and came towards us
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The vicar told me you were coming," he said; "he'll be in shortly. Excuse
  my not shaking hands, but gardening is not conducive to cleanliness. By the
  way, I'm Maguire."</p>

  <p>"So I guessed," said Ronald genially. "This is a nasty experience of
  yours."</p>

  <p>The curate's face clouded over. "Believe me, Mr. Standish," he remarked,
  "I wouldn't have worried that dear old man for the world. But I can't go on.
  I think my nerves are as strong as most people's, but this thing is wearing
  them to a frazzle. I daren't go to sleep now. I just lie awake wondering
  whether it's coming."</p>

  <p>"Are you by any chance what the Scotch call fey?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen anything of the sort before," he cried. "But after this
  experience, I think I must be. You see, I'm the only person who has seen it.
  And the only conclusion I can come to is that I am what is technically known,
  I believe, as en rapport with this particular earthbound spirit. So that when
  I arrived here it was able to manifest itself for the first time."</p>

  <p>He made a sudden dart at a large snail, and picking it up threw it over
  the wall.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless they fulfil some purpose," he remarked, "but they are a pest in
  a garden."</p>

  <p>"How is your nocturnal visitor dressed?" asked Ronald, as we went into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"As far as I can tell you, in brown," answered the other. "But I've really
  only seen his outline. He always eludes me, and then he vanishes just about
  there."</p>

  <p>We were standing in the hall, and he pointed to a spot on one of the
  walls.</p>

  <p>"Don't let's talk about it, if you don't mind. I try to forget it during
  the day. Come up to my room, and we'll wash our hands."</p>

  <p>We followed him up the stairs into a large, airy bedroom, where he left us
  to get some hot water from the bathroom. And some what curiously I glanced
  round. There was the bed at the foot of which the ghostly visitor appeared;
  there near the window the bag of temptation&mdash;his golf clubs. A cheerful,
  sunny room&mdash;the last one would have associated with the supernatural.
  Then I happened to glance at Ronald's face. And to my amazement I saw on it
  the look I knew only too well, which was replaced by his usual imperturbable
  expression as Maguire entered with the can. He had seen something, but
  what?</p>

  <p>A few minutes later we descended to find the vicar waiting for us in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Welcome!" he cried. "I hope Maguire has done the honours, and that you
  are ready for a real Cornish lunch?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am, Mr. Greycourt," said Ronald. "The links here give one an
  appetite. I understand you play, Mr. Maguire?"</p>

  <p>"I'm frightfully keen on it," answered the curate. "But I don't play in
  Lent." He gave a deprecating smile. "However, I confess that I'm longing to
  loosen my arms again."</p>

  <p>He gave a couple of practice swings as if to illustrate his remark. Then
  we all went into the dining-room and sat down.</p>

  <p>"We must try to fix a round after Easter, if I'm still here," said Ronald,
  and Maguire nodded.</p>

  <p>"By all means," he answered. "Though I fear the same proviso applies to
  me."</p>

  <p>A slightly embarrassed silence settled on the table, which the vicar broke
  by inquiring how we liked the place. And thereafter throughout the meal the
  dangerous topic was safely avoided. No allusion was made to it, in fact,
  until after lunch, when Maguire had left the room to go to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you haven't succeeded in making him change his mind?" said our
  host.</p>

  <p>Ronald shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Greycourt. And I think I can safely say that it is better that he
  should not. The experience is evidently very real to him but I am hopeful
  that when he leaves here he will go somewhere where the manifestation
  will&mdash;er&mdash;cease. Somewhere, perhaps, where the food is not so
  rich."</p>

  <p>His voice was expressionless, and the vicar nodded thoughtfully. "You
  think it's digestion?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so. In which case a change of diet may work the trick."</p>

  <p>"I think it will do him a lot of good," remarked Ronald gravely. "Very
  plain diet: wholesome, of course, and at fixed hours. But don't mention it to
  him, Mr. Greycourt; he might think we were unfeeling."</p>

  <p>"Of course not; of course not!" cried the worthy clergyman. "I shouldn't
  dream of doing so."</p>

  <p>"And while I think of it, Vicar, there is one other thing I would like to
  suggest to you. If, during the few remaining days he is here, you should
  again hear him moving about at night&mdash;take no notice. Remain in your own
  room. It is a case, if I may say so, where the intervention of a third party
  does more harm than good."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right, Mr. Standish. I will do as you say. He must work
  out his own salvation....Ah! my dear boy&mdash;parish matters?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at Maguire, who had just returned.</p>

  <p>"It's my cousin, sir. He is passing through Wadebridge again. Apparently
  the last consignment of cream was so much appreciated that he's going to call
  for some more."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! Splendid! I hope he'll stay for tea. Are you playing golf, Mr.
  Standish?"</p>

  <p>"Not this afternoon," answered Ronald. "Bob and I were thinking of having
  a walk along the cliffs."</p>

  <p>"Good. You'll find them beautiful&mdash;very beautiful. And if you are
  near here, come in for tea also."</p>

  <p>"What the dickens were you driving at?" I asked Ronald as we left the
  house. "Your remarks on Maguire's diet seemed to me to be pretty
  pointed."</p>

  <p>"Getting quite bright, aren't you, Bob?" he said with a grin. And then the
  grin faded, and with compressed brows he swung along over the springy
  turf.</p>

  <p>"I hope that dear old chap follows my advice," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"That was another thing I couldn't understand," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm much mistaken, you will within the next few days," he
  answered. "The vicar has come to no harm as yet, but it's only because he's
  been lucky."</p>

  <p>"You mean he's in danger?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Very grave danger," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>His eyes were roving round the landscape as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"But what from?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"That ghost. It would have been a bad thing for the vicar if he had
  happened to come out one night in time to see it, or rather not to see it.
  Let's walk over to the edge of the cliff there."</p>

  <p>"You are an irritating devil," I said. "Can't you be more explicit? Give
  me some clue to what you are driving at!"</p>

  <p>Once again he grinned faintly.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the snail our friend threw over the wall? A most
  instructive action, old boy, when coupled with that bag of golf clubs."</p>

  <p>We had reached the top of the cliff, and stood peering down. A clearly-
  marked path led to the beach, and he nodded his head as if satisfied.</p>

  <p>"It fits together, Bob," he remarked. "An old, old game, with one or two
  distinctly novel features in it. And, but for the snail, I might never have
  spotted it."</p>

  <p>I refrained from profanity, and inquired mildly what he proposed to do
  next.</p>

  <p>"Admire the beauties of nature, old boy, until the time arrives for us to
  get a look at Maguire's cousin. I feel he might help."</p>

  <p>And not another word could I get out of him on the subject during our two
  hours' walk, a walk which I noticed was so planned that it brought us back to
  the vicarage about four o'clock. A car was standing outside the gate, and as
  we approached two men came down the path carrying a wooden packing-case. One
  was Maguire; the other, presumably, the cousin. And the instant he saw them,
  Ronald went dead lame.</p>

  <p>"Twisted my ankle, I don't think," he muttered, sitting down on the bank.
  "Go on, Bob, and see if that second man has anything wrong with his
  nose."</p>

  <p>I strolled on, and got level with the car just as it was starting. Maguire
  was talking earnestly to his companion, who was in the driver's seat, and as
  I came up to them they both looked at me. And with a queer little thrill I
  noticed that the cousin's nose had an odd kink in it, as if it had been
  broken and not set straight.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the car drove off, and Maguire crossed the road with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Standish?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He gave his ankle a bit of a turn," I said, "and I was just coming to ask
  for a little cold water."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he cried. "We must get him indoors. Here he comes now."</p>

  <p>Ronald was hobbling along the road, and called out cheerily:</p>

  <p>"Quite all right. Don't worry. Thought for a moment I'd twisted it
  properly, but it's nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Sure you won't bathe it?" asked Maguire solicitously.</p>

  <p>"Quite, thank you. I'll get straight on. It's no distance to the
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity my cousin has just gone. He could have given you a lift."</p>

  <p>"Better to walk," said Ronald. "So you got the cream off, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's taken it with him. Well, Mr. Standish, we must try to fix that
  game some time."</p>

  <p>"Sure thing," cried Ronald. "If I'm still here all you've got to do is to
  ring up the hotel."</p>

  <p>With a cheerful wave of his hand, he limped on and the instant we were out
  of earshot he turned to me eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well! Had he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "It looked as if it had been broken."</p>

  <p>"Good," he cried. "I thought I recognised him, even at that distance. Bob,
  the plot thickens, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that it clears
  up."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"The last time he was given free board and lodging at His Majesty's
  expense it was under the name of John Simpson. His real name, I think, is
  Robert Stenway, and he's just about as nasty a customer as you could wish to
  meet."</p>

  <p>"Then what the dickens is he doing in this galley,"&mdash;I
  asked&mdash;"carting Cornish cream about for a curate?"</p>

  <p>Ronald began to shake with laughter</p>

  <p>"Bob," he remarked, "I take off my hat to you. Maguire is no more a curate
  than that Cornish cream is cream. And that being the case we will send a wire
  to my friend Inspector Mclver, which, unless I am much mistaken, will bring
  him down here post-haste."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">"IF 'Snarkie' Stenway is in it, it's dope for a certainty,"
  said McIver.</p>

  <p>We were in our sitting-room the following afternoon, and Ronald
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought so myself," he remarked. "But this fellow Maguire is a new one
  on me, Mac."</p>

  <p>"I can't spot him either from your description. Maybe I'll know him when I
  get a closer look at him. Or perhaps he's a genuine beginner."</p>

  <p>"Then he shows astounding aptitude for it. Incidentally there he is,
  walking towards the post office."</p>

  <p>The Inspector sprang to the window and peered out. Then he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know him. Still, perhaps this is the beginning of an
  acquaintance that is destined to ripen."</p>

  <p>"And no harm will be done by visiting the post office after he's gone,"
  said Ronald. "People have been known to send wires from post offices, the
  imprints of which are left on the next form."</p>

  <p>He strolled out of the room, and the Inspector grinned at me. "No flies on
  him, Mr. Miller. How did he stumble on this?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," I said. "I've been with him the whole time; I've seen
  everything he's seen; and all I can get out of him is that it was through
  seeing this man Maguire throw a snail over the wall."</p>

  <p>McIver roared with laughter, and a few minutes later Ronald returned with
  a telegraph form in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Virtue rewarded," he remarked. "It's to John Cuthbertson, Charing Cross
  Post Office. 'Shall have more cream tomorrow.'"</p>

  <p>He threw the form on the table.</p>

  <p>"A bit quicker than I thought. It means he'll be getting the cream
  tonight. Wherefore, Bob, if you want to see the ghost, a bit of shut-eye
  won't do anyone any harm. It may be an all-night job."</p>

  <p>"I'll just arrange for a couple of men from Wadebridge in case of
  accidents," said McIver, "and then I'm of your way of thinking."</p>

  <p>It was a pitch-dark night when we started at ten o'clock. The two local
  men had already been sent on with instructions to lie up by the road a few
  hundred yards short of the vicarage. And there we found them half an hour
  later.</p>

  <p>"No one has passed, sir," said the sergeant, "and the light downstairs has
  just gone out."</p>

  <p>"Good," said McIver. "Then we'll get closer and wait."</p>

  <p>We approached cautiously, and finally went to ground in some bushes about
  thirty yards from the house. Light was coming from two of the bedrooms, and
  once Maguire came to his window and looked out. Then the lights were
  extinguished and our vigil began.</p>

  <p>The wind had dropped. The only sound was the distant beating of the surf
  on the shore. And after a while I began to feel drowsy. It was a weary
  business waiting, with no possibility of a cigarette. And then, just as my
  head was nodding, I felt Ronald stiffen beside me. From the direction of the
  cliffs had come the call of a sea-bird. It was thrice repeated, and
  immediately the light in Maguire's room went on.</p>

  <p>We waited tensely, our eyes straining into the darkness. And suddenly I
  heard Ronald's whisper in my ear: "There he is."</p>

  <p>A figure was just discernible creeping along the side of the house. Then a
  light began to flicker in one of the downstairs windows. A candle was being
  carried down the stairs. And then the set, white face of Maguire himself came
  towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Now," muttered McIver, and we all rose.</p>

  <p>The window was opened, a bulky parcel was handed through, and at that
  moment we were on them. The man outside was so surprised that he showed no
  struggle at all. Not so Maguire. He fought with a cold ferocity that was
  almost inhuman. And it was not until Ronald knocked him out with a beauty on
  the point of the jaw that McIver got the handcuffs on him.</p>

  <p>We stood breathing a bit heavily, when a plaintive voice from the stairs
  reminded us of the vicar.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he cried, standing there in his dressing-gown. 'What has
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"We've laid your ghost for you, Mr. Greycourt," said Ronald reassuringly.
  "I'm afraid we made a bit of a noise over it."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," said the other, dazedly. "Why is Maguire
  handcuffed?"</p>

  <p>"Because he richly deserves to be," answered Ronald. "So you've come to,
  have you?" He glanced at the prisoner, who was glaring at him with eyes full
  of vindictive hatred. "Now, young man," he went on, sternly, "there's one
  question that you'd better answer, and answer darned quickly. Where is
  Maguire? For on your reply depends whether you're in the running for a
  six-foot drop."</p>

  <p>"He's not croaked; we've got him hidden," snarled the other.
  "But"&mdash;he burst into a flood of hideous blasphemy&mdash;"I'll be even
  with you over this one day, Mr. Meddlesome."</p>

  <p>"If you don't stop that language I'll gag you," snapped McIver. "Take 'em
  both into that room and keep 'em there," he ordered the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," he continued, as the vicar joined us, "somewhat naturally,
  you're a bit surprised. But if you will come and have a look at the contents
  of this parcel you'll understand. You see these packets? Do you know what is
  inside them?"</p>

  <p>He opened one, and the old man stared at the contents
  uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"Snow," went on the Inspector. "Cocaine. Your so-called curate has been
  using your house for smuggling dope."</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it!" cried the vicar. "How did you find it out?"</p>

  <p>"Better ask Mr. Standish," laughed McIver. "He's the wizard in this case.
  And while he's telling you I'll just examine the room upstairs."</p>

  <p>"It must have come as a shock to you, Mr. Greycourt," said Ronald quietly.
  "But once you realise that this man whom you have known as Maguire is not
  Maguire at all, and certainly not a clergyman, it will help. You see, I've
  got rather a suspicious nature, and a severely practical nature, and though I
  don't deny the possibility of ghosts, I'm sceptical about them. And I became
  more sceptical still when I found out that no one else had ever seen or heard
  of this apparition. So out of idle curiosity I asked myself what object would
  be served if there wasn't a ghost at all&mdash;if, in fact, the whole story
  was a lie. And one answer stuck out a yard. It would enable the man who
  invented the yarn to move about at night without incurring your suspicion.
  Which was suggestive, but was only a mere surmise on my part&mdash;a bare
  possibility&mdash;when I came to have lunch with you. Then there occurred one
  of those strange little things on which the best-laid schemes go wrong. The
  man posing as Maguire seemed a delightful fellow: his personality seemed all
  that one would expect in a really sound sporting curate. And when in a moment
  of zeal he flung a snail over the wall, as one gardener to another I took to
  him more. Then we went up to his bedroom to wash. McIver," he sang out,
  "bring those golf clubs down, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Right you are," answered the Inspector. "And I've got a nice pot of cream
  as well."</p>

  <p>He came down the stairs carrying the bag of clubs and a china jar.</p>

  <p>"What do you want the clubs for?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I happened to look at those clubs while he was getting some hot water,"
  went on Ronald. "Try one, Bob; take that mashie."</p>

  <p>Completely mystified, I took the club out of the bag, and then in an
  instant light dawned on me.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord," I cried "it's a left-handed club!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And he'd thrown the snail with his right hand; he poured out the
  water with his right hand; he swung his arms in the hall right-handed. In
  fact, here was a right-handed man, reputed to be a first-class golfer, with
  left-handed clubs. Which, as Euclid said, was absurd. So at once the case had
  to be examined from a fresh angle&mdash;the angle that this so-called Maguire
  was an impostor. And everything began to fit in. His refusal to play golf in
  Lent: obviously the easiest way of avoiding the exposure of his complete
  ignorance of the game. His decision to leave you after Easter, when Lent
  ends, and his excuse would no longer hold water. And then another, more ugly,
  thought arose&mdash;he could not have bought those clubs himself. No dealer
  would have sold a right-handed beginner left-handed clubs. Therefore they
  must belong to the real Maguire; and what had happened to him? And on that
  point, according to what this man says, I'm glad to hear he has not been
  murdered. But I didn't know that then, and so I warned you, Vicar, to let him
  ghost-walk by himself. Quite clearly he was a dangerous customer, a fact
  further proved by the way he fought tonight.</p>

  <p>"The rest was easy. What possible purpose could bring a man of that sort
  down here&mdash;save smuggling? This house lends itself admirably to getting
  contraband from a boat lying off the coast. Moreover, you had been awakened
  on one occasion by a noise that you thought was like a window shutting. And
  when I heard that 'a cousin' was taking Cornish cream to London from here
  instead of buying it for himself, the thing became obvious. When, still
  further, I found that this so-called cousin was a notorious dope smuggler and
  criminal, the case was complete, and I wired for my old friend, Inspector
  McIver, with the result you've seen tonight."</p>

  <p>"Clever trick, this, Mr. Standish," said the Inspector. "Looks like a
  genuine pot of cream, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>He held out the jar: all that could be seen was a layer of the delicious
  stuff with its skin of faint golden yellow. And then with a spoon he scraped
  it away, revealing an inch underneath packet after packet of cocaine.</p>

  <p>"In fact, a very ingenious plot, the memory of which may solace him
  through a few years of seclusion," he went on with a grin. "With your help,
  Vicar, we'll get Snarkie tomorrow, and that will conclude the
  entertainment."</p>

  <p>And with the vicar's help we did. The worthy old gentleman lied as to the
  manner born with regard to where Maguire was when Stenway arrived, and
  personally helped him carry the cream we had made up to the car. And there
  McIver arrested him, while Ronald congratulated Mr. Greycourt on his ready
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Mr. Standish," he answered, with a merry twinkle in his eye.
  "I said that Maguire was visiting one of my parishioners, whether willingly
  or not I saw no reason to state. And it may interest you to know that the
  police station is within the confines of my parish."</p>

  <p>So ended a clever crime which, save for Ronald's quick eye, would never
  have been detected. Stenway got seven years: the other man, who turned out to
  be the son of a wealthy man in the Midlands, and who had been a wrong 'un
  from his birth, got five. It was the first offence that had brought him into
  actual contact with the police, but I shall be surprised if it is his
  last.</p>

  <p>And as for the genuine Maguire, who, to do the scoundrels justice, had
  been quite well treated, he and I beat Ronald and Maxwell in a four-ball
  foursome only last week. After which we all dined with the vicar, concluding
  with a pot of cream. Only the cream was not limited to the top inch.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4">IV. &mdash; A MATTER OF TAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of the most useful assets in Ronald Standish's mental
  equipment was his extraordinary knowledge of out-of-the-way little tips that
  are not known to the man in the street. He seemed to have a positive
  storehouse of them locked away in his brain; in fact, he was a sort of living
  edition of one of those peculiar compendiums called "Do you know?" or some
  such title. An astounding memory had a great deal to do with it. Any new fact
  that struck him as being of interest was locked away and duly docketed in his
  mind ready for immediate production when required. And one of the best
  examples of this gift of his was shown in the case of the Fallconer diamonds.
  And though, as an instance of his powers of detection, it is perhaps not so
  illuminating as many others, it illustrates his quickness on the uptake and
  powers of observation to a very marked degree.</p>

  <p>It was on an afternoon in early June that I wandered round to his rooms to
  find him in the middle of a telephone conversation.</p>

  <p>"I shall expect you round at once," he said as I entered, and then he hung
  up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"A lady visitor, Bob, is on her way," he remarked, "and from what I
  gathered over the telephone she is in a state of considerable agitation. Let
  us, therefore, endeavour to make the darned place a little more presentable
  to the feminine optic before she comes."</p>

  <p>He threw a couple of niblicks into, the corner, and removed his cricket
  bag from a chair where it was in the process of being packed.</p>

  <p>"A nuisance," he said. "I was going to have played tomorrow. But when
  Jumbo Dean has wished her on to us, I can't let him down."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to stay?" I asked. "It may be private."</p>

  <p>"Wait and see, anyway," he said. "Her name is Miss Fallconer, which
  conveys rather less than nothing to me."</p>

  <p>He reached for a copy of "Who's Who" and opened it. "Only one Fallconer
  mentioned," he remarked, "and he has one daughter, so it may be him. A
  widower living at Oxbridge Place in the county of Sussex. He's a J.P., and
  has written two or three books on travel, so that one is not surprised that
  his club is the Travellers'. Age fifty-six. After which," he continued with a
  grin, "we shall probably find he's not our bird at all."</p>

  <p>I strolled over to the window. A girl was just getting out of a taxi in
  the street below.</p>

  <p>"Here she is," I said, "and there's a man with her. Both of 'em
  young."</p>

  <p>A few moments later she came in, followed by her companion. They were a
  striking-looking couple, and I instinctively glanced at her left hand to see
  if they were engaged. They were not; there was no ring on her finger.</p>

  <p>"How d'you do, Miss Fallconer?" said Ronald, going forward with hand
  outstretched. "May I introduce my friend, Bob Miller?"</p>

  <p>She gave me a little nod, and then turned back to Ronald. "Good Heavens!
  Mr. Standish," she cried, "you're not a bit like what I imagined."</p>

  <p>"Sorry about my face," laughed Ronald. "Tis a poor thing, but mine
  own."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that at all," she answered, laughing also, "but it's all
  this."</p>

  <p>She waved a hand round the room generally.</p>

  <p>"Did you expect to find me immersed in a test tube?" said Ronald
  cheerfully. "Or peering at you out of the cupboard with a false nose on?"</p>

  <p>He looked inquiringly at the man, who so far had not spoken.</p>

  <p>"This is my Cousin, Mr. Sanderson," she said, and Ronald pulled forward
  two chairs.</p>

  <p>"Let's get down to it," he remarked. "You're evidently very worried, so
  there's no good wasting time."</p>

  <p>She took a seat facing the window, and I studied her covertly. She was an
  extremely pretty girl, but, as Ronald had said, she looked anxious and
  troubled. One foot was tapping nervously on the floor, and once or twice as
  she talked she bit her lip as if to control her voice.</p>

  <p>"It was Major Dean who advised me to come to you," she said. "You know
  him, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I know Jumbo very well," Ronald assured her. "And anything I can do for a
  pal of his will be a pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Standish, Jack couldn't have done it&mdash;I know," she cried.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to interrupt you, Miss Fallconer," said Ronald quietly, "but
  you must remember that I know absolutely nothing of the matter on which you
  have come to consult me. So may I ask you to begin at the beginning, and
  taking your own time, tell us everything that has happened? Everything,
  please, omitting nothing, however trivial it may seem to you."</p>

  <p>He handed her his cigarette-case, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My father," she began, "is Mr. John Fallconer, and we live at Oxbridge
  Place."</p>

  <p>Ronald glanced at me.</p>

  <p>"It is the one in 'Who's Who' then. Go on."</p>

  <p>"My mother died a few years after I was born, and since then, except for
  the time when I was at school, and one or two other gaps when he has been
  abroad, he and I have lived there by ourselves. He was a very wealthy man.
  Even today, though, of course, he's been hit like everybody else, father is
  still pretty well off."</p>

  <p>"Is the place entailed?" put in Ronald. "I mean, on his death does the
  property go to you, or to the male next of kin?"</p>

  <p>"To me," she said slowly, "unless he chose to make a will leaving it to
  someone else, which I don't think is likely."</p>

  <p>"All right. That's quite clear," said Ronald. "Now we can get down to the
  real business."</p>

  <p>"I say, Beryl, my dear," put in her cousin, "hadn't you better tell Mr.
  Standish something about old Jack before we come to last night? He must get
  it clear, you know, about everybody concerned."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I had," she said. "Half a mile from us, Mr. Standish, there is
  a small chicken farm which is being run by a man called Jack Dalton.
  And"&mdash;she hesitated for a moment&mdash;"well&mdash;he's been the cause
  of the only quarrels father and I have ever had."</p>

  <p>"Leave this bit to me, old thing," said Sanderson quietly. "Jack Dalton is
  a topper, Mr. Standish, but honesty compels me to admit that he's a. damned
  bad chicken farmer. At least, the bally birds don't seem to pay, and as he's
  got practically no money at all of his own he's pretty impecunious. That,
  however, has not prevented what you have probably guessed already: the two of
  'em are in love. But her respected male parent has old-fashioned ideas on the
  subject, and fails to see why his daughter should ante up the boodle for
  Jack's eggs. That's about it, isn't it, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but there's another point," she said. "Jack feels just the same
  himself. He says he won't marry me unless he can make his farm pay."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ronald. "We have now got that relationship taped. Let's get
  on with it."</p>

  <p>"The night before last&mdash;that is to say, Tuesday," she
  continued&mdash;"we had a small dinner-party. Harold was there and
  Jack..."</p>

  <p>"So Jack is invited to the house, is he?" put in Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes," she cried. "Father likes him very much. He often shoots with
  us. It's only when I come in that the trouble arises. Where was I? Harold and
  Jack were there; the Vicar and his wife, and Sir John and Lady Grantfield who
  brought Harold in their car."</p>

  <p>Ronald looked inquiringly at Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"I live about seven miles away, Mr. Standish," he explained. "And my car
  being temporarily out of action Sir John, very kindly, gave me a lift."</p>

  <p>"Carry on, Miss Fallconer," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"After dinner," went on the girl, "father sprang a surprise on us. We were
  all sitting in the room that used to be the billiard-room, but which we have
  now converted into a sort of general living-room, when he suddenly produced
  from his pocket a large case. And inside it was the so-called Fallconer
  tiara. It used to belong to my mother, and it's always been a bit of a joke
  in the family. It's of great value, but perfectly hideous. The diamonds are
  magnificent stones, but the setting has to be seen to be believed. And it
  appeared that he had removed it from the local bank that very afternoon with
  the idea of bringing it up to London today to get it altered for my twenty-
  first birthday. I, of course, had seen it before, but the others hadn't, and
  it was passed round for everyone to have a look at. And then he proceeded to
  lock it up in a drawer in his big writing-desk, which stands in one corner of
  the room.</p>

  <p>"'But surely, Fallconer,' said Sir John, 'you're not going to leave it
  there. Why, a child could open that drawer with a hair pin.'</p>

  <p>"Father laughed.</p>

  <p>"'Possibly,' he agreed, 'if there was any reason for him to try. But since
  we eight and the bank manager are the only people who know it's there, I'm
  not worrying.'</p>

  <p>"And then we started to play bridge."</p>

  <p>"No servant came in while it was being handed round?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"No; of that I'm certain," she said.</p>

  <p>"Is this room on the ground floor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but all the curtains were drawn."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ronald. "So it comes to this&mdash;that on Tuesday night
  your father put away this tiara in a locked drawer in his desk, and so far as
  either of you know no one but the eight people you have mentioned knew of its
  presence there."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"Now we come to yesterday," continued the girl. "Father and I were alone
  after dinner, and we both went to bed before eleven. He had intended to catch
  the early train to London this morning, and I'd been playing tennis and was
  tired. In addition to that&mdash;we'd&mdash;we'd had a row."</p>

  <p>"What about?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two she hesitated and glanced at her cousin. "Cough it up,
  old thing," he said. "There's no good hiding anything."</p>

  <p>"It was about Jack again," she said. "And it was rather a bad one.
  Apparently he'd asked father to lend him some money in the afternoon. I know
  that he wanted more capital to extend his farm with, and I suppose he caught
  father at the wrong moment."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine why the silly ass didn't come to me," put in
  Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Fallconer," said Ronald, "let's hear what happened after you
  and your father went to bed."</p>

  <p>"Just as I was falling asleep," she answered, "I heard what sounded like a
  heavy bump. I listened again, but it was not repeated. And then as I lay in
  bed something unusual struck me. For a while I couldn't make out what it was,
  and then at last I got it. A light was shining on the tree opposite my
  window, which had not been there before. So I got up and looked out. And to
  my amazement I found that the light came from the billiard-room.</p>

  <p>"I looked at my clock. It was just after midnight. I wondered who on earth
  could be in there at such a time. And then I suddenly thought of the
  diamonds. So I put on a dressing-gown and went down."</p>

  <p>"Good for you," cried Ronald approvingly.</p>

  <p>"I opened the door," she continued, "and for a few seconds I thought the
  room was empty. And then happening to look towards the fire-place I saw
  father lying on the floor. I rushed over to him, fearing for one ghastly
  moment that he was dead. But I soon saw he wasn't, but was unconscious.</p>

  <p>"I was too worried about him to think about the diamonds, as I thought
  he'd had some sort of a fit. So I roused the house, and we telephoned for the
  doctor, who came within twenty minutes, He made an examination, and then he
  gave me the biggest shock of all.</p>

  <p>"'This is no fit,' he said. 'Your father has been knocked out with a
  weapon of some sort.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him stupidly. 'Knocked out!' I cried. 'Who by?'</p>

  <p>"'That I can't tell you,' he answered, 'But he is in no danger, though he
  will probably be unconscious for several hours. The only thing to do is to
  get him to bed and make him as comfortable as possible.'</p>

  <p>"And it was then that the diamonds came back to my mind. I rushed over to
  the desk, and found the drawer had been forced and it was empty. Evidently
  father had caught the burglar in the act of stealing the tiara, when the man
  had tunned him and escaped. A window was open. The whole thing seemed clear.
  So we got him upstairs and rang up the police station. There was no good in
  the doctor remaining, as there was nothing to be done till father came round.
  And so, finding myself alone except for the servants, I got on the telephone
  to Jack, to ask him if he'd come round and help me with the police."</p>

  <p>Once again she hesitated, and glanced at her cousin. But he was apparently
  engrossed in the toe of his shoe.</p>

  <p>"He was out," she went on after a while; "at least, I could get no answer.
  So I thought of Harold, forgetting his car was out of action. But he managed
  to raise one in the village and arrived at about the same time as the
  police."</p>

  <p>"Which was at what hour?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes past one," said Sanderson, and Ronald made a note. "And at
  what time did Miss Fallconer telephone to you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As near as makes no odds, twelve-thirty," answered Sanderson. "But it
  took me some little time to get dressed and rouse the owner of the village
  car."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Ronald, then, Miss Fallconer?"</p>

  <p>"The police asked all sorts of questions, and, of course, I could tell
  them nothing," said the girl. "They rushed round the garden looking for
  footmarks; they examined the window-sill for finger prints. And then at four
  o'clock father recovered consciousness."</p>

  <p>Ronald leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know he didn't do it," she cried passionately. "It's all some
  ghastly mistake."</p>

  <p>"Steady, Miss Fallconer," said Ronald quietly. "Let's hear all about
  it."</p>

  <p>"Father accused Jack of having done it," she answered, controlling herself
  with an effort.</p>

  <p>"His exact words, please."</p>

  <p>"He said&mdash;'That damned young swine Dalton did it. He was masked but I
  recognised his coat.' Then he became all muzzy again."</p>

  <p>"Recognised his coat," repeated Ronald thoughtfully. "Is there any
  particular significance in that remark?"</p>

  <p>The girl had risen and gone to the window, and her cousin answered.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately there is, Mr. Standish," he said gravely. "When my uncle
  became coherent again he gave us fuller details. Apparently he had heard a
  noise in the billiard-room and had gone down to find out what it was. And
  there he saw a man bending over the desk in an overcoat which was
  unmistakable. We've all of us pulled Jack's leg about that garment of his,
  but he said it was an old friend. It had a sort of purplish tint about it
  which was like nothing else I've ever seen. In addition to that it was filthy
  dirty."</p>

  <p>"In fact," said Ronald, "as you have just said, an unmistakable
  garment."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"How very peculiar!" remarked Ronald dryly. "I somehow think that if I was
  going to break into a house I should not choose something to wear which would
  inevitably give me away if I was discovered."</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," cried the girl eagerly.</p>

  <p>"What is Dalton's explanation of the matter?"</p>

  <p>"He says that the coat must have been stolen from his house by whoever did
  it."</p>

  <p>"He absolutely denies that it was him?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Where was he when you rang him up, Miss Fallconer?"</p>

  <p>"He says that he couldn't sleep and went out for a walk."</p>

  <p>For a while Ronald was silent as he filled his pipe, and suddenly the girl
  went to him appealingly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Standish," she cried. "I know he didn't do it. Jack would never have
  hit father."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Fallconer," he answered gravely, "whoever it was who stole
  the diamonds never had any intention of hitting your father when he started
  out. That was an entirely secondary thing done on the spur of the moment when
  Mr. Fallconer discovered him. Have they arrested Dalton?"</p>

  <p>"Not when we left," she said. "But father has told the police everything.
  And I know they think he did it."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want me to do, Miss Fallconer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Come down with us, Mr. Standish, and see if you can't find out something
  to help him. Major Dean, who is staying near us, told me this morning that if
  anyone in England could save him you could."</p>

  <p>"Jumbo exaggerates," said Ronald with a faint smile. "But I'll come and
  see what I can do."</p>

  <p>"Thank you a thousand times," she cried. "Will you come in my car or go in
  your own?"</p>

  <p>"In my own, thank you, Miss Fallconer. I'll be at Oxbridge Place as soon
  as possible."</p>

  <p>"I've got to get that stuff from the chemist for father, Harold," she said
  at the door. "Will you be in St. James's Square in ten minutes?"</p>

  <p>"All right, my dear," answered her cousin, picking up his hat as she went
  out. And then he paused, listening to make sure she had gone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Standish," he said gravely, "I fear you're going on a fruitless
  errand. I hadn't the heart to try and dissuade her from coming to you, and
  perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;you may spot some thing which we've missed.
  But since you are, so to speak, acting for Jack, it's only fair that I should
  tell you what I have not mentioned to anybody. I'd been over in the bus
  yesterday, and dropped in on Jack just after his interview with my uncle. And
  he was in a furious rage. As a matter of fact, he's got the devil of a temper
  at times. And he announced not once, but two or three times, his intention of
  making the darned old swab, as he put it, sit up."</p>

  <p>"Threats of that sort may mean a lot or nothing at all," remarked
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"I agree. But I fear you've hit the nail on the head. I don't think for
  one second he meant to strike my uncle, but I do think he intended to steal
  the diamonds. You see, the devil of it is that there are only four men except
  Mr. Fallconer himself who knew where the tiara was. And of those four the
  Vicar and Sir John are obviously out of court, while I was in my house seven
  miles away. It's a hopeless case, I'm afraid. However, let's trust you won't
  think so."</p>

  <p>With a nod he went out, and Ronald turned to me. "What do you make of it,
  Bob?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, old boy, very much what Sanderson does. Pretty black."</p>

  <p>"It was very hot last night," he said enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens&mdash;" I began, but he was already in his bedroom
  throwing things into a bag.</p>

  <p>"Pack a bag, Bob," he said. "I'll come and pick you up."</p>

  <p>The whole way down he hardly spoke, and I wondered at his preoccupation.
  To my mind the thing was obvious. Had someone been lurking outside the window
  on the night of the dinner-party and seen the tiara being handed round,
  surely he would have broken in on the Tuesday, and not waited till
  Wednesday&mdash;I said as much to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Some such idea had occurred to me," he said, with a faint smile. "Which,
  coupled with the fact that the night was hot, raises an interesting
  point."</p>

  <p>"What point?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>The smile grew more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Think it out," he said. "And surely there is Sanderson standing by the
  road?"</p>

  <p>We pulled up as he waved to us.</p>

  <p>"I got off at my house and waited for you," he said. "Will you come and
  have a drink before you go?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard worse ideas," remarked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"And perhaps you'd give me a lift afterwards," continued Sanderson as he
  led the way. "My bus is still out of commission. Confound it," he said,
  peering into the sideboard. "There isn't a siphon. Mrs. Burton," he shouted,
  going to the door, "siphon, please. A dear old woman," he continued as he
  came back, "but as deaf as a post."</p>

  <p>A moment later she entered beaming, and carrying in her hand a small
  bottle done up in white paper.</p>

  <p>"Here it is, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The oil of eucalyptus you wanted this morning. The chemist did say that
  you'd bought some yourself, but I thought I'd get a bottle and make
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you, Mrs. Burton," said Sanderson, "but in the meantime what
  I want is a siphon."</p>

  <p>She bustled away, and he turned to us apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he remarked. "She seems to get deafer every day. Perhaps you'd
  like a whisky and eucalyptus. As a matter of fact I thought I had a bit of a
  cold coming on this morning, and there's nothing like it, in my opinion."</p>

  <p>The housekeeper returned with a siphon, and Sanderson poured out the
  drinks.</p>

  <p>"Here's fortune," he cried. "And may you be able to help poor old Jack. We
  go past his cottage on the way to my uncle's house."</p>

  <p>We finished our glasses and re-entered the car, with Sanderson sitting
  behind.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to go slow over one bit," he said. "They're just tarring, and
  they're doing it damned badly, I think, with a particularly vicious sort of
  yellow grit on top of it."</p>

  <p>We came to the place quite shortly, and though Ronald almost crawled the
  rattle of the tiny fragments on the back of the car was very audible.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he said. "Damned badly. I'll have to&mdash;go even
  slower."</p>

  <p>I glanced at him quickly. The pause in his last sentence had been very
  perceptible. And it was obvious to me that that was not what he had intended
  to say. But his expression was inscrutable and his next question quite
  casual.</p>

  <p>"How long have they been at it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They only started yesterday morning," answered Sanderson. "Now in about a
  mile we come to Jack's place. Are you going to stop there?"</p>

  <p>"We might look in and see what he has to say," said Ronald, "though I fear
  it's not much use. I've been thinking the thing over on the way down, and it
  looks pretty hopeless to me."</p>

  <p>And once again I glanced at him in surprise, though I said nothing.</p>

  <p>"There's the cottage," said Sanderson. "And, by Jove! There's a constable
  there. I know him, too; he's a local fast bowler. Good evening, Paxton," he
  called out as we walked up the path to the house. "Any further
  developments?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid there are, sir," answered the policeman. "They've arrested Mr.
  Dalton."</p>

  <p>"The dickens they have!" said Sanderson, with a significant look at
  Ronald. "When did they do it?"</p>

  <p>"Half an hour ago, sir. You see, we found the coat what the squire was
  talking about&mdash;that there overcoat of Mr. Dalton's. And in the pocket
  was the case what the diamonds had been in."</p>

  <p>"And the diamonds?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't found them, sir. Not a trace."</p>

  <p>"Where was the coat found, officer?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"'Idden away, sir, be'ind one of the 'en 'ouses," answered the man. And
  then he hesitated. "I suppose as 'ow I didn't really ought to, but would you
  gentlemen like to have a look at it? It's in the 'all."</p>

  <p>"I certainly would," said Ronald. "After all I've heard about this garment
  I'm most curious to see it. Great Scott!" he cried as he saw it, "no wonder
  you used to pull his leg over it."</p>

  <p>He had taken it down, and was examining it carefully, and suddenly I saw
  that unmistakable gleam in his eyes which I knew only too well. He was hot on
  something, but no one except me would have noticed it.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," he remarked. "Indeed, a coat of many colours. However, it
  opens up a field for research."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Sanderson incredulously. "That coat does? How?"</p>

  <p>"It has recently been worn by a discharged soldier who has a pronounced
  limp and fair hair," said Ronald quietly. "I am beginning to see daylight.
  Bob," he continued, turning to me, "will you and Sanderson go on to Mr.
  Fallconer's house and wait for me? There are one or two inquiries I've got to
  make, but I hope to get there myself in time for dinner."</p>

  <p>He got into the car and drove off, leaving us staring after him.</p>

  <p>"Is he pulling our legs?" demanded Sanderson. "What's all that bilge about
  a discharged soldier? He couldn't possibly deduce that by looking at an old
  overcoat."</p>

  <p>"It's astounding what he can get at," I answered, though I was wondering a
  bit myself. It seemed welinigh impossible to have made such a deduction, and
  yet his voice had been perfectly serious. "Let's do what he says, anyway," I
  continued, "and wait for him at your uncle's house."</p>

  <p>He took me by a short cut over the fields, and 'all the way he did nothing
  but hark back to Ronald's remark.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are we to tell Beryl?" he said just before we reached our
  destination. "If his remark means anything at all it means that this
  discharged soldier is the criminal. But it would be a shame to raise her
  hopes and then find he was fooling."</p>

  <p>"Let's just say that he's making few inquiries and hopes to join up for
  dinner," I said.</p>

  <p>We found Beryl with her father, and she introduced me to him. "Delighted
  if you'll both stop and dine," he said when I told him about Ronald, "but I'm
  afraid he's wasting his time. The thing is as clear as a pikestaff, though
  I'd never have believed it of young Dalton. No, no, my dear," he continued as
  his daughter began to protest, "we don't want to go over it all again. If he
  had given me back the tiara, and promised to leave the district and never see
  you again, I might have been lenient. But now justice must take its
  course."</p>

  <p>"The police have searched for the diamonds?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered testily. "But what's the good? He wasn't going to
  leave 'em in the middle of the dining-room table. He had the whole night in
  which to hide the tiara. It may be buried anywhere in the country-side, near
  some landmark that he can recognise later."</p>

  <p>And so it went on for an extremely uncomfortable hour. Mr. Fallconer,
  whose head was obviously still hurting him, grew more and more irritable,
  whilst his daughter, with a sort of pathetic faith in Ronald, continually
  stared out of the window down the drive. And at last came the welcome sight
  of the car. Not, frankly, that I hoped for anything, but the situation would
  now be settled one way or the other at any rate.</p>

  <p>We all met him in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Found the discharged soldier?" said Sanderson, with mild sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Ronald genially. "That, I fear, was a little flight of
  fancy indulged in on the spur of the moment. But what I have found is far
  more important."</p>

  <p>And from his pocket he produced the tiara.</p>

  <p>"The diamonds!" shouted Mr. Fallconer. "Where were they?"</p>

  <p>But Ronald did not answer. His eyes, stern and relentless, were fixed on
  Sanderson, who, with an ashen face, plucked ceaselessly at his collar. And
  soon we were all looking at him.</p>

  <p>"Need you ask?" said Ronald gravely. "I found them in your nephew's
  desk."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" muttered Sanderson thickly. "It's a plot."</p>

  <p>"The plot was yours, Sanderson," said Ronald, and his voice cut like a
  knife. "And a pretty rotten one, too. Why you poor fool, it was next door to
  obvious from the word go."</p>

  <p>But the other waited to hear no more and, like a whipped cur, bolted from
  the house.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!" roared his uncle. "Stop the damned young black guard!"</p>

  <p>"Steady, Mr. Fallconer," said Ronald quietly. "You can always get him if
  you want to. But I would suggest your thinking things over calmly first.
  After all, he is your nephew, and the scandal will be considerable. But one
  thing, of course, should be done at once. You must ring up the police and
  tell 'em to let Jack Dalton go immediately. Explain things as you like, but
  he is as innocent as I am."</p>

  <p>"I knew it!" cried the girl. "Though how you found out beats me."</p>

  <p>"A very simple case, Miss Fallconer," he said, "and yet a case which
  showed an extraordinary mixture of skill and stupidity on the part of your
  cousin. The first point of interest was the fact that last night was very
  hot&mdash;the sort of night on which no one would dream of wearing an
  overcoat for warmth. I add those last words advisedly&mdash;for warmth.</p>

  <p>"We now come to that blessed old coat&mdash;a most conspicuous garment; a
  garment about which. Dalton was used to being chaffed; a garment which would
  be instantly recognised by your father or by you. Well, now, it is
  conceivable that if he wanted the coat for warmth he might have chanced
  wearing it; but he didn't. Therefore what possible purpose could there be in
  his putting it on? If he proposed to steal your diamonds, it is the very last
  thing he would have worn. And so the obvious alternative solution was that it
  wasn't Dalton who was wearing the coat at all, but someone who wanted to
  impersonate him. So much was clear before we left London.</p>

  <p>"Came the next question&mdash;who could this be? First, it was some man
  who knew the tiara was in your desk. That boiled us down to the four who
  dined with you, or someone looking through the curtains on the night of the
  party. Second, it was some man who knew Dalton intimately&mdash;so intimately
  that he knew all this jest about the coat. And that was one of the reasons
  which made it improbable that it was a casual burglar who had seen from
  outside. The other reason, as you pointed out, Bob, was that a casual man
  would have gone for it on the night of the party and not waited. So I
  considered your four guests; in fact, Mr. Sanderson considered them for me.
  And somewhat naturally I dismissed the Vicar and Sir John Grantfield.</p>

  <p>"Now we came to the first difficulty, for by this time I was frankly
  wondering about your nephew. On the face of it he had a perfect alibi. Mr.
  Fallconer had been attacked just after midnight. Miss Fallconer rang him up
  at twelve-thirty. His car was out of commission. He couldn't have walked
  seven miles in less than half an hour. He couldn't even have bicycled it
  unless he was a racing champion. He wouldn't have dared to ask for a stray
  lift, or even hire another car. And so if his car was really out of
  commission he was exonerated.</p>

  <p>"Well, we called in on him on our way down. And then we went to Dalton's
  cottage, where we saw the coat. And on that celebrated garment there were
  some interesting marks. Behind the right shoulder were three or four splashes
  of new tar, and adhering to the tar were tiny fragments of yellow grit. Now,
  between Dalton's place and Sanderson's there is a stretch of new tar covered
  with yellow grit which they only commenced work on yesterday. So it appeared
  possible that the driver of an open car might have worn that coat when going
  over that stretch the marks were just where one would expect to find them.
  And the significance of the oil of eucalyptus struck me at once&mdash;a
  bottle of which Mrs. Burton had given him while we were there.</p>

  <p>"Back I went and examined his car. True, it was out of commission, but a
  glance at the trouble showed that half an hour's work was all that was
  necessary to put it right. Then I looked at the back: no trace of tar. Then I
  searched in the rubbish heap and found this."</p>

  <p>He took a blackened old rag out of his pocket and the reek of eucalyptus
  filled the room.</p>

  <p>"The proof I wanted," he continued, and we stared at him in amazement.
  "The whole thing was clear. Your nephew had taken Dalton's coat, probably
  when he saw him yesterday afternoon. He repaired his car and drove to
  somewhere near here, going over the newly-laid tar and getting some on the
  coat. Then, having knocked you out and got the diamonds, he left the coat in
  Dalton's farm and drove back. Mrs. Burton, being deaf, never heard the car at
  all. Came a stroke of luck for him when you rang up, Miss Fallconer. To his
  mind it estabished his innocence. He then came over here in a hired car; went
  back this morning and again took his engine partially down. But a further
  point had to be dealt with: the back of his car was covered with tar
  splashes&mdash;noticeable splashes because of the yellow grit. He realised
  that if they were seen he was for it, since the work only started yesterday.
  And here he was clever. He happened to know a small fact which very few
  people do know. Unfortunately for him, I knew it too, and very nearly gave it
  away in the car, Bob. There is nothing so good for removing tar from
  paint-work as plain oil of eucalyptus. Moreover, no suspicion would be
  aroused by his asking for some, whereas if he bought one of the patent
  mixtures sold for the purpose&mdash;even if he could have got it in the
  village&mdash;questions might have been asked. And so when I found this rag
  in the rubbish beside the garage the whole chain of events was complete, and
  I decided to commit a small burglary myself, which very fortunately was
  successful. I had noticed a big desk in the room he had taken us to, and I
  decided to chance it. Picking locks is a little hobby of mine, and that one
  presented no difficulties."</p>

  <p>"I think it's simply amazing, Mr. Standish," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Honestly&mdash;no, Miss Fallconer. Sheer luck was far too big a factor
  for me to take much credit. For there is no getting away from the fact that
  it was the fresh tar on the road and the eucalyptus being brought in by Mrs.
  Burton that solved the matter."</p>

  <p>"Well, we're extremely grateful to you," said Mr. Fallconer. "Young Jack
  will be here at any moment now and will be anxious to thank you himself. But
  there is one point that occurs to me. What would have happened if I hadn't
  interrupted him? He's a man with a lot of money; he didn't want the diamonds
  for the cash they'd bring."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Solving things that have happened is hard enough without trying one's
  hand at things that haven't. But I think I can hazard a guess. The tiara was
  destined for Dalton's house: taking the first opportunity, Sanderson would
  have planted it there, as the phrase goes."</p>

  <p>"But in Heaven's name&mdash;why?" cried Mr. Fallconer. "What motive had
  he?"</p>

  <p>Ronald's smile grew more pronounced, and he stared at the girl.</p>

  <p>"A singularly charming one, if I may say so," he answered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">V. &mdash; THE HOUSE WITH THE KENNELS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"A YOUNG lady to see you, sir. Here is her card."</p>

  <p>With a frown of annoyance Ronald Standish put down the golf bag he had
  just picked up and took the bit of pasteboard from his man.</p>

  <p>"That's a nuisance, Bob," he said to me, and then he raised his eyebrows.
  "Miss Nancy Millington. I wonder if she is any relation of Tom Millington
  whom I've played cricket with. Show her in, Sayers."</p>

  <p>The butler left the room and a moment later he ushered in a pretty girl of
  about twenty-five, who looked from one to the other "I wonder no longer,"
  said Ronald, with a laugh. "And what can I do for Tom Millington's
  sister?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" she cried, surprised.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Millington&mdash;you're as alike as two peas. How is the old
  lad?"</p>

  <p>"He's very well, Mr. Standish, and it was he who told me to come to you.
  He thinks I'm a half-wit for bothering you at all, and I'm not at all sure I
  don't think the same myself now that I'm here."</p>

  <p>"Take a pew, bless you," said Ronald, "and let's hear all about it.
  Incidentally, this is Bob Miller."</p>

  <p>"It all seems so trivial and stupid," she began, "when one starts, to put
  it into words, that probably you'll laugh at me the same as Tom did. But I
  can't help it. I feel I've got to get it off my chest. He and I, as perhaps
  you know, Mr. Standish, live together. We've got a house down at West
  Bilsington, which is a little village not far from Pulborough, in Sussex. Tom
  does a bit of farming in the intervals of playing cricket, and we've been
  there about four years.</p>

  <p>"Most of the houses round us are small cottages belonging to labourers; in
  fact, the only big one in the neighbourhood is the rectory, which is a great
  barn of a place. And it is about the rectory that I've come to see you. A
  year ago the old vicar died. He was a man with considerable private means,
  and an awfully good sort. He and his wife used to do a lot of entertaining in
  a mild way&mdash;tennis and that sort of thing; and so, when he pegged out,
  we were all of us very concerned as to who was going to take his place.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know how these things are arranged, but the next incumbent,
  or whatever they call it, hadn't got a bean to bless himself with. He's an
  extraordinarily nice man, and his wife is charming, but they found they
  couldn't possibly afford to live in the rectory. You want at least four
  servants, and they simply couldn't run to it. So they put it in the house-
  agent's hands, with no result until two months ago, when a Mrs. Hamilton took
  it, and the vicar and his wife moved into a cottage.</p>

  <p>"Somewhat naturally, as you can guess, we were all very anxious to see the
  lady. The tennis court is the only decent one for miles, and we hoped the old
  rÚgime would start again. Which is where we were disappointed. A week after
  Mrs. Hamilton arrived we discovered she was mad on dogs, and proposed to
  start kennels. She hung up notices all over the place to say that dogs would
  be taken in and boarded, and proceeded to cover the lawn with wired-in runs
  for them. And in addition to that, she actually brought half a dozen dogs of
  all varieties of breeds with her. I'm afraid all this is very boring," she
  added apologetically, "but I must begin at the beginning."</p>

  <p>"Tell it your own way, Miss Millington," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"As you can imagine," she continued, "in a small village like ours
  everybody knows pretty well everything about everybody else. The butcher or
  someone passes things on to the cook and she does the rest. And it soon
  became known that Mrs. Hamilton's mÚnage was rather a funny one. For one
  thing, she had nothing but men servants; for another, two of them, at least,
  were foreigners. Of course, there was nothing in that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just one moment, Miss Millington," interrupted Ronald. "What age is this
  Mrs. Hamilton?"</p>

  <p>"Forty&mdash;forty-five," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"And is she English?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't swear to it," she answered. "She speaks English perfectly, but
  once or twice it has seemed to me that she's got the trace of an accent."</p>

  <p>"Is there a Mr. Hamilton?"</p>

  <p>"If there is, he hasn't been down there, to my knowledge."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ronald. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"Another thing that soon became obvious was that she was a very unsociable
  sort of woman. I gave her a fortnight to settle in and then I went to call.
  She was quite polite and returned it a week later, but one could tell at once
  that it was only because she had to, and that she didn't intend to let it go
  any further. Not that I wanted it to, but she is our next-door neighbour, and
  in a little place like that one naturally wants to be friendly. She is always
  quite pleasant if she is on the lawn and I happen to be passing, but, she
  definitely gives you the impression that it's a case of bare politeness, and
  that she wishes to goodness you'd go away. The trouble is that I'm absolutely
  devoted to dogs, and I never can resist having a look at them when I go past
  the gate. Which is what caused the first thing that has brought me here
  today.</p>

  <p>"Three weeks ago I was going into the village, and looking on to the lawn
  I saw her with a new arrival&mdash;a perfectly topping Irish terrier.</p>

  <p>"'What a beauty!' I cried. 'What's his name?'</p>

  <p>"'Cheaper,' she said. 'Because I got him cheaper than I expected.'</p>

  <p>"The jest, I admit, was feeble, but it was such an extraordinary thing for
  her to make a joke at all that I went in and joined her.</p>

  <p>"He is a good dog,' she went on. 'Quite the best Airedale I've seen for a
  long while.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"'But, Mrs. Hamilton,' I cried, 'he's not an Airedale; he's an Irish
  terrier.'"</p>

  <p>The girl paused for a moment, as if searching for the right words.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to exaggerate, Mr. Standish," she went on, after a while,
  "but the effect was literally amazing. Admittedly, it was an incredible error
  for a dog-lover to make, but one would have expected her to laugh it off, or
  to pretend that she'd been fooling. After all, there is a certain similarity
  between the two breeds. It's not like mistaking a pug for a mastiff.</p>

  <p>"She turned white with fury, and for a moment I actually thought she was
  going to hit me. A look came into her eyes that was positively venomous, and
  I stepped back a pace. And then she recovered herself.</p>

  <p>"'Of course,' she said, with a forced laugh. 'How stupid of me!'</p>

  <p>"I stayed on a few more minutes; then I left. And the more I thought over
  it the more I wondered. How could anyone who is keen on dogs make such a
  mistake? And why the fury when it was pointed out? Because I hadn't imagined
  it, Mr. Standish! I can assure you of that.</p>

  <p>"I talked it over with Tom, and he pooh-poohed the whole thing. He seemed
  to think that the lady had a bad temper naturally and was furious with
  herself at being caught out. Which was all right as far as it went, but it
  didn't answer my difficulty. How could a genuine dog-lover be caught out over
  such a thing?"</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded, and I could see he was interested.</p>

  <p>"And having got as far as that," continued the girl, "I went a bit
  farther. Was she a genuine dog-lover, and if she wasn't, what on earth was
  the object of all this elaborate pretence of kennels? Again Tom laughed at
  me. His contention, and I admit it is difficult to answer, was that no one
  but a congenital idiot would rent the rectory at a place like West Bilsington
  and install dogs all over the lawn unless they were fond of animals. If she
  wanted to bury herself there, why couldn't she do it without the dogs?"</p>

  <p>"I can think of two very good reasons," said Ronald quietly, "but it's
  early days yet. This happened, you say, three weeks ago. I take it something
  further has occurred since?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," she answered promptly. "And it was that that decided me to
  come and see you. It may be all rot. Tom shrieked with laughter when I told
  him, and probably you will too. I was passing the gate of the rectory about
  eleven o'clock in the morning, and I stopped as I nearly always do to have a
  look at the dogs. Suddenly, I don't know why, I happened to glance up at the
  house. And there, pressed against one of the top windows, was a face. The sun
  was shining on the room, and so I could see the features clearly and the
  expression of fear and terror on them. Then in a flash the face had gone,
  almost as if it had been dragged away by someone behind."</p>

  <p>"Man or woman?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"An elderly man," she said. "I stayed there as long as I could, wondering
  if he would reappear, but he didn't."</p>

  <p>Ronald lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Let's get this straight, Miss Millington," he said. "The lawn is between
  the road and the house, so the house must be a considerable distance from
  where you were standing. Now, can you really be sure that the expression on
  this man's face was one of fear and terror?"</p>

  <p>"Just what Tom said," she answered. "In my own mind, Mr. Standish, I am
  perfectly sure. As I told you, the sun was shining on him, and in that
  momentary glimpse he stood out as clear as a photograph. Tom says that it is
  one of the servants who is sick, and, of course, he may be right. But if ever
  a man was appealing for help, that man was; I'm sure of it. So much so, in
  fact, that I very nearly told our local policeman when I got into the
  village. And then I thought I'd better ask Tom's advice first."</p>

  <p>"I don't think the policeman would have been much use," agreed Ronald.
  "Your evidence is a little too thin, isn't it, for official action?"</p>

  <p>"But you do believe me, don't you, Mr. Standish?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly believe all you've told me," answered Ronald. "But what
  interpretation to put on it is a different matter. Terror and great pain
  might look much the same at a distance, and Tom's theory about the sick
  servant is quite possibly correct. Again, Mrs. Hamilton's anger over her
  mistake about the Airedale is also capable of an innocent solution."</p>

  <p>"Which means you think there's nothing in it!" she cried, with keen
  disappointment in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Ronald assured her, "I am merely trying to show you that we
  mustn't he too hasty in jumping to conclusions; which is just what you, bless
  your heart, have done. You are convinced that Mrs. Hamilton is a fraud, to
  put it mildly, and that she and her gang of servants are holding some man
  prisoner, and probably torturing him."</p>

  <p>He laughed, and after a moment she laughed too.</p>

  <p>"Put like that, it does seem a bit absurd," she confessed. "And as Tom
  says, it would be ridiculous if she is a fraud to bother about the dogs."</p>

  <p>"Now that," said Ronald, "is where I entirely disagree with Tom, for two
  reasons, as I said before. Either the whole thing is completely innocent and
  you've made a crashing bloomer, or some thing very like my melodramatic
  picture is the truth. As you rightly remarked, in a tiny place like that
  everybody is intensely curious, and if this Mrs. Hamilton is playing some
  deep game, it is essential for her to have an occupation which will account
  for her being there."</p>

  <p>"But why dogs, if she knows nothing about 'em?" I put in.</p>

  <p>"Reason number two," he answered. "If there are dirty doings going on in
  the house, what better guardians could she possibly find than a bunch of dogs
  that bark the place down if a stranger approaches the door? Especially at
  night."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right, Mr. Standish," said the girl. "They make the most
  awful row. So you do think there's something in it?" she added.</p>

  <p>"'Pon my Sam, Miss Millington, I don't know. I should say it's about a
  fifty-fifty chance. But I'll tell you what I'll do, if you like. Can you put
  Bob and me up for two or three nights?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she cried. "Only too delighted."</p>

  <p>"Good! Then he and I will arrive with golf clubs complete, ostensibly to
  play round those very excellent links near Pulborough. And in the intervals
  of so doing we will cast a discerning eye on the denizens of the
  rectory."</p>

  <p>"How splendid!" she said. "I'm so glad, Mr. Standish! Because I'm certain
  there is something wrong."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think there is anything in it?" I asked when she had
  gone.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"On the one hand we have woman's intuition, which is never a thing to be
  sneezed at; on the other some first-rate golf. So, old lad, we score either
  way."</p>

  <p>There would have been no mistaking the rectory even without the dogs on
  the lawn. The only large house in the village, it stood some forty yards back
  from the road and about the same distance from the church, from which it was
  separated by an old wall with a wicket gate in it. Trees ran along the
  rectory side of the wall; on the other lay part of the churchyard. So much
  was obvious as we drove slowly past, and then, just as we got to the gate,
  Ronald somewhat unexpectedly stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"No time like the present, Bob," he said. "We'll do a bit of acting."</p>

  <p>There was no one in the garden, but he pointed to the notice board for the
  benefit of anybody who might be watching from the house and led the way up to
  the front door. Immediately all the dogs started barking furiously, and I saw
  a curtain shake in one of the end rooms. We were being inspected.</p>

  <p>"I see from the notice on the road," he said to the man who opened the
  door, "that you are prepared to receive dogs and board them. Can I see the
  owner of the place?"</p>

  <p>"I will find out if she is in," answered the man, speaking with a
  pronounced foreign accent. He was a saturnine-looking fellow, dark-skinned
  and swarthy, and I put him down as an Italian.</p>

  <p>He was away some time before he returned to say that Mrs. Hamilton would
  receive us, and to my surprise he seemed considerably agitated. However, we
  followed him through the hall to a room at the back of the house where we
  found the lady sitting at a desk, writing. She rose as we entered.</p>

  <p>"I was just motoring past, madam," said Ronald with a bow, "and I happened
  to catch sight of your notice. I have a terrier in London, for whom I want to
  find a happy home for the next six months while I am abroad. Would you be
  prepared to take him?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she answered. "My terms are half a guinea a week." They
  continued talking details for a time whilst I glanced round the room. It was
  just what one would have expected to find in such a house&mdash;sunny and
  comfortable, and the conviction began to grow on me that Miss Millington had
  made a mistake. Outside was another stretch of lawn with more dogs on it, and
  beyond that lay the kitchen garden.</p>

  <p>"Then that is settled," I heard Ronald say. "I'll send the little chap
  down in a week or ten days."</p>

  <p>She pressed the bell, which was answered by the same man who had let us
  in, and whom we again followed through the hall. We had penetrated the
  fortress, but it did not seem to me that we had gained much by it.</p>

  <p>"Didn't it strike you," I said, as we got into the car, "that that
  blighter who let us in had been ticked off when he went to find out if she
  was at home?"</p>

  <p>"Well done, Bob," said Ronald with a laugh. "You're getting on fine. But
  did it strike you as to why he'd been ticked off?"</p>

  <p>"How on earth can I be expected to know that?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you notice any difference in his appearance when he returned to
  say that Mrs. Hamilton would see me?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I did."</p>

  <p>"Not so good, old boy. When he opened the door to us he was not wearing
  gloves. When he came back he was."</p>

  <p>"One of her rules, I suppose, and he'd forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Did you see his nails?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. What was the matter with them?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer for a time, and when he did it was about, something
  completely different.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," he said, "that anybody could seriously think that a
  terrier eats a pound of dog biscuits twice a day? For that is what I told the
  lady my mythical hound consumed, and she swallowed it hook, bait, and sinker.
  I must say she was at pains to inform me that all practical details were left
  to the kennelman, but even so, Bob&mdash;a terrier, and two pounds of
  biscuits a day is a bit hot."</p>

  <p>"Then you do think the show is crooked?"</p>

  <p>"I said fifty-fifty to Miss Millington. Now..."</p>

  <p>He fell into a brown study, which continued till we reached the
  Millingtons' house.</p>

  <p>"The devil of it," he said as he stopped the engine, "is that we've got no
  excuse for going back there again, and it will be the deuce of a job to
  reconnoitre that house with dogs fore and aft, so to speak. I'd no idea she
  had more at the back."</p>

  <p>Tom Millington came out to greet us grinning all over his face, and Ronald
  introduced me to him.</p>

  <p>"Delighted to see you," he cried, "but I never thought Nancy would catch
  an old bird like you, Ronald, with her mare's nest."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled but said nothing, and we followed Millington into the house,
  where we were joined by his sister.</p>

  <p>"Here are your wretched dupes, Nancy," he said. "The least you can do for
  them is to produce some whisky and soda."</p>

  <p>"What time does the post go out?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Six o'clock," said Millington. "You've plenty of time to catch it."</p>

  <p>"Good. Well, Miss Millington, I've interviewed your girl friend."</p>

  <p>"You've seen Mrs. Hamilton!" she cried. "How did you manage that?"</p>

  <p>"I am sending her a non-existent terrier in a few days which eats two
  pounds of biscuits a day. At least I told her so and she didn't dispute the
  fact."</p>

  <p>For a moment she looked bewildered Then she turned triumphantly on her
  brother.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Tom. I knew she was a fraud."</p>

  <p>"Just because she knows nothing about dogs doesn't prove she's a wrong
  'un," he said obstinately.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't prove it," agreed Ronald. "But from one or two little things I
  saw, I think the betting on it is quite sufficient for me to write to
  Scotland Yard and make a few inquiries on the matter. Only I must beg of you
  to say nothing about it to anyone. If we're wrong it's the most libellous
  thing to do. If we're right we don't want the smallest chance of giving the
  alarm. Which is why I do not propose to post the letter in the village box.
  The local postman would probably die of heart failure."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a round," said Millington, now definitely impressed,
  "and you can post it on the way there. But what on earth can they be up to in
  a place like this?"</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen, old boy," answered Ronald. "Mrs. Hamilton and
  the man who opened the door are both new ones on me, so I've got no ideas as
  to their line of country. But if one of my surmises is correct, I think I
  could hazard a pretty shrewd guess."</p>

  <p>And more than that he refused to say, though we were all itching with
  curiosity. We played golf that evening, and two rounds the next day, and
  never once did he allude to the matter. And then on the following morning
  came the reply from the Yard.</p>

  <p>"Blank," said Ronald after he had read it. "Nothing is known about them.
  And I'm afraid I rather expected it. However, the point that now arises is
  what we're going to do about it&mdash;if anything."</p>

  <p>"We must do something," cried the girl. "If they are criminals we can't
  let them stay on at the rectory."</p>

  <p>"If you can tell me of any method by which we can turn 'em out," laughed
  Ronald, "we'll get down to it. We haven't got a vestige of proof, and if we
  managed to get into the house in search of it, it's we who become the
  criminals. No, Miss Millington, I fear it's no go at present. So I think I
  will go back to London and make a few further inquiries, leaving Bob, if you
  can bear him, to hold the fort at this end."</p>

  <p>"We'd love Mr. Miller to stay on," she said, but I could tell she was
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes skinned, Bob," said Ronald. "See without being seen, and
  don't let 'em suspect you."</p>

  <p>Which was all very fine and large, as I said to the girl after he had
  gone. How on earth was I to see without being seen? I could not stand at the
  front gate, nor could I walk backwards and forwards past it for hours on end.
  A hiding place in the grounds was out of the question because of the dogs, so
  that altogether it seemed a somewhat tall order. And then at lunch she had a
  brain-wave.</p>

  <p>"Do you, by any chance, sketch, Mr. Miller?"</p>

  <p>"Not so that you'd notice it," I said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because if you could, sufficiently well not to make it ridiculous, I
  thought you might sit in the churchyard and draw the church. Then you'd have
  at any rate two sides of the house under observation."</p>

  <p>Now, as a matter of fact, as a schoolboy I had done a certain amount of
  sketching in a mild way, and the advantages of her suggestion were obvious.
  The trouble was that it had been very mild, and my fear was that my effort
  would be so crude that anyone seeing it would know I was an impostor. Still,
  it seemed the only possibility, and after lunch we drove into Horsham for the
  necessary paraphernalia. Then, having obtained permission from the vicar, I
  proceeded to the churchyard.</p>

  <p>One difficulty immediately presented itself. To even the most
  inexperienced eye there was only one feasible spot in which to set up my
  easel, from the point of view of drawing the church, and that spot was
  utterly unsuitable from the point of view of watching the rectory. However,
  undeterred by trifles of that sort, I selected a place which gave me the best
  observation post for the house and commenced work under the rheumy gaze of an
  incredibly old man who was pottering round tending the graves.</p>

  <p>It was a beautifully warm afternoon and I soon began to feel infernally
  sleepy. What little cunning my hand had ever possessed seemed to have
  completely gone, and my preliminary effort looked like a cross between a
  Martello tower and a drunken lighthouse. The old man was immensely
  edified.</p>

  <p>"Have 'e done much in that line, sir?" he mumbled, after he had inspected
  it long and carefully.</p>

  <p>"Not for some time," I answered, with what dignity I could, hoping
  fervently that my audience would not increase.</p>

  <p>He cupped his hand round his ear.</p>

  <p>"What do 'e say?" he remarked. "I be terrible 'ard of 'earing."</p>

  <p>"I said not for some time," I told him in a loud voice, and even as I
  spoke I realised that a man was watching me intently from one of the top
  windows of the rectory. He was not the one who had let Ronald and me in when
  we had called on Mrs. Hamilton, but he also looked like a foreigner. For an
  appreciable time he stood there staring at me. Then as suddenly as he had
  appeared he vanished, and a few moments later I saw him come out of the front
  door and walk towards the wicket gate. Evidently he was going to speak to me,
  which was the last thing I wanted. One glance at the effusion I had produced
  would give the whole show away. There was only one thing to be done, and I
  did it. I tore off the sheet, crumpled it into a ball and threw it away.</p>

  <p>"A fine day for sketching," he remarked, as he came up. "And an excellent
  subject."</p>

  <p>"Which, I fear, I did but scant justice to with my first attempt," I
  answered, lighting a cigarette. "In fact, I have thrown it away."</p>

  <p>"What a pity," he said. "I would have liked to have seen it." He was
  looking round, and my heart sank. What on earth was I going to do if he
  picked it up and opened it? And suddenly, to my amazement, I realised it was
  no longer there. It had fallen between two graves, and now there was no sign
  of it. And then it dawned on me what had happened: the ancient had picked it
  up.</p>

  <p>"Yonder octogenarian has removed the outrage," I said lightly.</p>

  <p>"I really must see it," he remarked with a smile. "I assure you I am no
  mean critic. Hi&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>The old man took not the slightest notice, but continued pottering about
  with his hoe.</p>

  <p>"He's as deaf as a post," I said. "But I am not at all anxious for it to
  be seen; it is altogether too bad."</p>

  <p>"Artistic modesty," he cried, and to my alarm and annoyance he went up to
  the old chap. Which was devilish awkward. We could not have a bellowing match
  in the churchyard.</p>

  <p>"Have you got the sketch the gentleman threw away?" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir, it's a beautiful day," wheezed the other. "Just what we want at
  cherry-picking time."</p>

  <p>"The sketch that you picked up, you old ass."</p>

  <p>"The grass, sir. Maybe that could do with a drop of rain. Which, reminds
  me," he chuckled, "that I could do with a drop of summat myself. 'Tis
  powerful thirsty weather."</p>

  <p>He hobbled away down the path, and I burst out laughing at the other's
  discomfiture. He looked completely nonplussed. And then the more sinister
  aspect struck me. Why was he so keen to inspect this sketch of mine that he
  had even displayed considerable bad taste over the matter? If ever a man had
  been told plainly that I did not want it looked at, he had. And yet he had
  persisted.' If he was so anxious to find out whether I was a genuine artist,
  it followed that he had reasons for fearing I might not be. Which was yet
  another proof that things were going on in the house which he wished to
  conceal. But he had quite recovered himself when he rejoined me.</p>

  <p>"He certainly is a little hard of hearing," he remarked genially.</p>

  <p>"Are you also interested in dogs?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I fear not," he answered. "It is my aunt's hobby. Aren't you going to
  sketch any more?"</p>

  <p>I had risen and started to pack up.</p>

  <p>"Not today," I said. "I'm just beginning to think that our elderly
  friend's idea of a drop of Summat has much to commend it."'</p>

  <p>I did not tell him that as nothing would induce me to draw a line under
  his eye there did not seem much object in prolonging the interview. Mrs.
  Hamilton was walking about amongst the dogs; it seemed unlikely that I should
  find out anything more. And so I left him standing there and started home.
  Did he suspect me? That was the point. Most certainly I suspected him, but
  was the converse true? His attempt to test me had been foiled by the old
  man's deafness. What was the final result in his mind?</p>

  <p>"Aunt!" scoffed Nancy Millington, when I told them about it. "I don't
  believe it."</p>

  <p>"I admit I've seldom seen two people who are less alike," I agreed.
  "Still, I don't see that that has much bearing on it either way!"</p>

  <p>"It's another proof that they're crooked," she cried. "Why should he
  pretend to be her nephew when he isn't?"</p>

  <p>"Hold hard, old soul," said her brother with a grin. "It is just possible,
  you know, that she is his aunt."</p>

  <p>"Any message from Ronald?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," said the girl, and shortly after we all went to dress for
  dinner, a meal at which we endeavoured without conspicuous success to keep
  the conversation off the rectory.</p>

  <p>It was the sudden furious barking of all the dogs at about eleven o'clock
  that gave Tom Millington the idea.</p>

  <p>"What about doing a little observation by night from the churchyard,
  Miller? There's no moon, and it's nice and warm. We might find out
  something."</p>

  <p>"I'm quite on," I said. "Let's go and change into some other clothes. And
  we'd better wear rubber shoes."</p>

  <p>His sister wanted to come too, but with brotherly frankness he informed
  her that she would merely be a damned nuisance. And so half an hour later we
  two men found ourselves crouching amongst the graves as near to the wicket
  gate as we could get. The top rooms of the rectory on the side facing us were
  in darkness, though light was streaming out from two windows in front.</p>

  <p>Not a breath of wind stirred; the night was absolutely still. The village,
  a few hundred yards down the road, was long since asleep. And I was just
  beginning to feel a strong craving for a cigarette, when with disconcerting
  suddenness a light went on in one of the downstairs rooms in front of us. A
  man, clearly visible through some thin curtains, had just come in, and I
  edged nearer Millington.</p>

  <p>"That's my bird of this afternoon," I whispered.</p>

  <p>He crossed to the french windows and flung them open, whilst we shrank
  back, though it was out of the question for him to see us as we were well in
  the shadow. For some time he stood there silhouetted against the light, and
  the smell of his cigar came to us distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much the matter with that weed," breathed Millington in my ear.
  "Why can't the bally man go and smoke it somewhere else? It's making me
  envious."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he swung round. Another man&mdash;the servant who had admitted
  Ronald and me&mdash;had entered the room carrying some thing in his hand. It
  looked like a piece of white paper, and he put it on the table. Then both men
  pored over it in silence for some minutes. At length my acquaintance of the
  afternoon produced a magnifying glass from his pocket, and continued his
  examination through that. And he was just straightening up when there came a
  startling interruption. A man's scream, instantly suppressed, rang through
  the night. And it came from the house.</p>

  <p>With a snarl of rage my acquaintance dropped the magnifying glass and
  sprang to the door, followed by his companion. And in a flash Tom Millington
  was on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Miller," he muttered. "I'm not standing for this. That scream
  was one of mortal terror."</p>

  <p>We rushed through the wicket gate, and into the room. The door was open,
  and heedless of what noise we made we raced up the stairs. The passage was
  lit, and as we passed one of the rooms a pitiful moaning sound came from it.
  And Tom Millington without hesitation walked straight in.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was dead silence, and we took in the whole scene. Lying
  in bed was a dazed man. Standing over him were Mrs. Hamilton and the two who
  had been in the room down stairs. And in the woman's hand was a hypodermic
  syringe. For just a second the sick man's eyes sought ours in an agony of
  supplication. Then they closed wearily and he sank back on the pillows.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this monstrous intrusion?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamilton had at length found her voice.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of that poor devil?" I cried sternly, pointing at the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"By Gosh it's the&mdash;artist," said her so-called nephew softly, getting
  between us and the door and ringing the bell.</p>

  <p>"How dare you break into my house?" cried the woman, white with anger.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," said Millington curtly. "When one hears some poor wretch
  screaming in terror one doesn't stop to ring the front door bell.
  Well&mdash;what explanation have you?"</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of my eye I saw that two more men had entered the room,
  and an ugly-looking couple of customers they were. Then I turned back to the
  woman, and just caught a meaning glance that passed between her and her
  nephew.</p>

  <p>"You are evidently under some delusion, Mr. Millington," she remarked in a
  very different voice from her former one. "I still consider it an outrageous
  thing for you and your friend to come into my house unannounced at this time
  of night. But hearing what you did it is perhaps understandable. This poor
  man is suffering from an agonising and practically incurable complaint, and
  the only thing we can do to help him is to give him continual injections of
  morphia."</p>

  <p>"What doctor is attending him?" said Millington stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Millington! I confess I'm amazed at your question. What
  possible business can it be of yours? But if you wish to know, it is a
  specialist from Brighton. And now I must really request you to go. Otherwise
  I shall have to ask my nephew to ring for the police."</p>

  <p>"Nephew?" came a genial voice from the door, and we all swung round. To my
  astonishment Ronald was standing there with three other men, one of
  whom&mdash;the speaker&mdash;I recognised as Inspector McIver of Scotland
  Yard.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he continued, "one lives and learns. I didn't know you went
  in for aunts. So you're up to your old games again, are you, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the devil you're talking about, McIver," answered the
  other sullenly. "You fellows will never give a man any credit for trying to
  run straight. I'm helping my aunt with her dogs."</p>

  <p>"Are you, now? And do you feed 'em on these?"</p>

  <p>From his pocket McIver produced a piece of paper, which I recognised as
  being similar to the one the two men had been examining downstairs.</p>

  <p>"I've struck some damn fool things in my life, Joe," he continued, "but
  actually to leave one lying about in a sitting-room with the window open wins
  in a canter."</p>

  <p>I looked at the paper more closely. It was a five-pound note. And the next
  moment we were all of us mixed up in it. With a howl of fury the man called
  Joe had hurled himself on the footman.</p>

  <p>"You thrice damned fool!" he screamed. "You've wrecked everything."</p>

  <p>"Not quite," said McIver, when they were finally separated. "But each of
  you thinking the other had it saved me a lot of bother. Put the bracelets on
  all of 'em."</p>

  <p>A sergeant entered the room.</p>

  <p>"I've found the outfit, sir," he announced, but McIver took no notice. He
  had gone to the bed, and was staring at the unconscious man. And suddenly he
  gave a long whistle.</p>

  <p>"Blest if it isn't Mr. Symington, the millionaire! He's supposed to have
  left for Paris three or four days ago. My sainted aunt, Joe, you'll be for it
  this time good and hearty. Forging bank-notes and abduction with violence
  will keep you occupied at the taxpayers' expense till it's time to redeem the
  three and a half per cent War Loan."</p>

  <p>And at that instant the sick man opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Save me," he muttered. "Forging my signature. Stop the cheques."</p>

  <p>"All right, sir," said McIver soothingly. "Don't you worry your head about
  that. We've caught the whole bunch."</p>

  <p>"Came down about my dog," whispered the other. "They must have sent faked
  letters to hotel."</p>

  <p>His eyes shut, he seemed to sleep.</p>

  <p>"What have you done to him?" said McIver sternly.</p>

  <p>The woman shrugged her shoulders, she knew the game was up.</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious," she said. "He's only bung full of morphia. I was
  speaking the truth when I told those guys that."</p>

  <p>And then she stared at Ronald.</p>

  <p>"What put you wise?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Apart from the small matter of Irish terriers and Airedales," he said,
  "the fox terrier has yet to be born that eats two pounds of biscuits a
  day."</p>

  <p>"But you were wise to that before you left London," I remarked. "What made
  you wiser?"</p>

  <p>It was an hour later, and we were having a final nightcap. Mr. Symington
  had been removed to a nursing home, the prisoners to a less comfortable
  destination.</p>

  <p>"When I saw Joe Darlington," he answered. "At least, that was the name
  under which he last enjoyed His Majesty's hospitality. What his real name is
  I doubt if even he himself knows. He has several aliases, speaks four or five
  languages fluently, and is a natural criminal. And to think that he would sit
  in the country on a dog farm was to think the unthinkable. So I knew the show
  was crooked, a thing I had only guessed before.</p>

  <p>"You remember I asked you if you'd noticed that other man's nails when he
  opened the door. Well, I had, and I'd seen they were stained and discoloured
  with acid. Such stains may come quite innocently; they may also come very
  much otherwise. They are almost invariably to be found on a forger's hands,
  and when I saw them I told you that if anything shady was going on I could
  give a pretty shrewd guess as to what it was. Seeing Darlington this
  afternoon made it to my mind a certainty. I don't think he has ever been
  actually in that line himself, but he would be an invaluable help in getting
  the notes distributed, which is more than half the battle. So I got on the
  'phone to McIver, who arrived about two hours ago with his merry men. And the
  rest you know It was luck, of course, each of 'em thinking the other had the
  dud flyer, but we had them in any case."</p>

  <p>"But what I still don't understand," I said, "is about this man Joe
  Darlington. You hadn't seen him before you went to London, so how could you
  'phone McIver?"</p>

  <p>Ronald grinned gently.</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," he said, "I never went to London. I had the very
  greatest faith in your ability to bolt any badger there might be. I was
  tolerably certain you had only to be in the vicinity of the house for half an
  hour for the suspicions of every inmate to be aroused. And I banked on
  it."</p>

  <p>His voice changed suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Oi be terrible 'ard of 'earing," he wheezed, producing my crumpled-up
  sketch from his pocket. "My sainted aunt, Bob, it might be anything from a
  joint of beef to a ship in distress at sea!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6">VI. &mdash; THE THIRD MESSAGE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">"SUSSEX at the Oval; Oxford at Lord's. Which shall it be,
  Bob?"</p>

  <p>Ronald Standish pushed back his chair from the breakfast table and started
  to fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Neither&mdash;unless I'm much mistaken, old boy," I said from the window.
  "A warrior showing traces of excitement has just crossed the street and is
  making for the door. It looks like a job of work!"</p>

  <p>The bell rang furiously, and a moment or two later Ronald's butler ushered
  in a visitor. He was a man of about thirty-five, dark and clean-shaven, and
  he was in a state of considerable agitation.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Standish?" he inquired, looking from one to the other of us.</p>

  <p>"That's me," said Ronald. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I must first of all apologise for coming at such an unearthly hour," he
  remarked, "but a very shocking tragedy has taken place. And remembering that
  a friend of mine, Major Brewster&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim Brewster in the 10th Lancers?" put in Ronald.</p>

  <p>"That's the man."</p>

  <p>"I know him well. Please go on."</p>

  <p>"Remembering, then, that he once told me that you were prepared sometimes
  to take on detective cases, I ventured to come straight away to you. Stavert
  is my name&mdash;Herbert Stavert."</p>

  <p>"Take a chair, Mr. Stavert; and take your time," said Ronald. "But before
  you begin, I'll just have the debris cleared away."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, and while Sayers&mdash;his man&mdash;was removing the
  breakfast things, no more was said.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Ronald, as the door closed, "let's hear all about it."</p>

  <p>"To make things clear, Mr. Standish," began the other, "I must go back
  five months. Does the name Sir James Brackenbury convey anything to you?"</p>

  <p>Ronald knit his brows.</p>

  <p>"Brackenbury! Vaguely&mdash;yes. I know I've heard the name, but at the
  moment I can't connect it with anything. Wait&mdash;didn't he fall over a
  cliff and break his neck?"</p>

  <p>"So I thought until last night," said the other, grimly. "Now I don't
  think that 'fall' is the right word. However, you shall hear the whole story
  and judge for yourself. Sir James Brackenbury was my uncle; he was also, in a
  sense, my employer. I used to live with him at Stalbridge Hall, doing for him
  what little secretarial work he required. But it was really only a nominal
  job; I was more a companion than a secretary. To be quite frank, he never got
  on with either of his sons, and when his wife died, about two years ago, he
  suggested that I should make the place my home.</p>

  <p>"I deliberated for some time as to whether I should accept his offer.
  Again, to be quite frank, my uncle was a somewhat queer-tempered individual,
  and I was doubtful as to how we should get on. But jobs are hard to come by
  these days, and, to cut it short, I went&mdash;an action which was not
  approved of by either of my cousins. They made the most offensive
  insinuations, the more offensive because they were so obviously groundless.
  The property was entailed; the title must pass automatically, so what I was
  expected to get out of it I don't know. But I want to make it clear that the
  family atmosphere was not good.</p>

  <p>"Well, for about fifteen months the arrangement continued. I ran the
  business of the estate; opened my uncle's correspondence, arranged his
  shooting parties, and so on. And, somewhat naturally, my uncle got into the
  habit of expressing himself pretty freely in front of me. Which brings me to
  the next family difference. It has, so far as I can see, no hearing on the
  matter, but I think it better to tell you everything. You must know, then,
  that the principal cause of my uncle's anger with his elder son Harry was
  that he refused to get married. The old man was frightened lest the title
  should ultimately come to Dick, the younger boy, whom he disliked far more
  than he did Harry."</p>

  <p>"It certainly sounds a very happy family," commented Ronald dryly. "Did
  the two brothers dislike one another also?"</p>

  <p>"They got on fairly well together so far as I know. Harry was in the
  Guards; Dick was in some motor business down in Brighton. And it was the old
  man's custom always to allude to him as 'that damned chauffeur'. Harry came
  twice while I was there for the shooting. Dick never entered the house. And
  that was the state of affairs at the beginning of last March, when, on
  opening my uncle's letters one morning, I found an extraordinary
  communication. It was typewritten, evidently on a cheap machine, by someone
  who was not an expert. The spacing was uneven, and some of the letters were
  irregular.</p>

  <p>"'Place the papers on the seat by the summer-house.'</p>

  <p>"That was the message. Just that and nothing more. I looked at the
  envelope; the postmark was a London one."</p>

  <p>"One moment," interrupted Ronald. "Have you got that paper on you?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," said Stavert. "You will understand why shortly. After
  breakfast I showed it to my uncle, commenting on its strangeness. And, to my
  amazement, the old man turned as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>"'Good Lord! Uncle James!' I cried. 'What's the matter?'</p>

  <p>"He slowly recovered his colour, though I could see he was terribly
  shaken.</p>

  <p>"'The devils,' he muttered at length, 'the foul devils! I'll be damned if
  I do. Let them do their worst.'</p>

  <p>"'But who are you talking about?' I cried, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"'Never you mind,' he said, and with that he tore the note into tiny
  pieces and flung them in the paper basket.</p>

  <p>"'But are there any special papers?' I persisted, for I certainly had
  never heard of them.</p>

  <p>"'You mind your own business,' he answered, and stumped out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"The next few days my uncle was unusually silent. Two or three times I
  tried to get him hack on to the subject, but on each occasion he shut up like
  an oyster. And after a while the thing began to fade from my mind, when
  suddenly the tragedy occurred. About two miles from the house is an old
  disused quarry. My uncle was found at the bottom of it with his neck broken.
  It was easy to see what had happened. For some reason or other, he had been
  standing too near the edge; the ground had given way, and he had fallen.
  Death was instantaneous. The thing had happened at dusk, the body being found
  by a passing labourer about eight o'clock at night.</p>

  <p>"Harry, of course, at once motored down, but Dick was out of England on
  business. I immediately told Harry the whole story of the letter. For the
  decision we had to make was whether or not I should allude to it at the
  inquest. And, rightly or wrongly, we decided not to. I felt that it was
  principally for my cousin to say, and he was very averse to mentioning
  anything.</p>

  <p>"'It can't bring the poor old chap back to life,' was the line he took,
  'and we'll have these confounded newspaper men round us like a swarm of bees.
  It is impossible to say that there is any connection between the two things.
  There are no marks indicating violence on the body. It's far better to have a
  verdict of accidental death returned.' And in due course it was, with the
  obvious rider about the danger of the quarry and the need for a more adequate
  fence."</p>

  <p>"One moment, Mr. Stavert," said Ronald. "Was your uncle in the habit of
  taking long walks, and that one in particular?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; it was a favourite direction of his."</p>

  <p>"A fact which would be known or could be easily found out by the writer of
  that message?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably so."</p>

  <p>"Another point. Is the spot from which he fell visible for a long distance
  around?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not. There is a little dip there, and the usual path runs round
  the top of the dip. But it can, of course, be seen from below."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly. It comes to this&mdash;that a man could hide in
  that dip and not be seen by anyone walking along the top of the quarry until
  he was close to him."</p>

  <p>"That is so, Mr. Standish. From your questions I gather you think the
  verdict may have been wrong."</p>

  <p>"I don't say that. But I most certainly think that you and your cousin
  acted wrongly in suppressing a very material piece of evidence."</p>

  <p>"So do I&mdash;now," cried the other bitterly. "And this time it certainly
  won't be suppressed."</p>

  <p>"This time?" said Ronald, staring at him. "You've received another of
  these messages, have you?"</p>

  <p>"That's why I'm here, Mr. Standish. However, to go back. After the
  funeral, Harry and I went through everything in an endeavour to find anything
  which might possibly account for the letter. We found nothing&mdash;
  absolutely nothing. I, of course, knew where most of his papers were, but
  even in a drawer he kept permanently locked there were only a few faded
  letters and the draft of his will."</p>

  <p>"What sort of letters?" demanded Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Love letters&mdash;old ones&mdash;from a lady who did not become his
  wife," said Stavert. "I think you can dismiss the idea at once of their being
  the object of the communication, for the lady involved has been dead some
  years. And so we were forced to the conclusion that he had either destroyed
  these papers, whatever they were, or else that there was some secret hiding-
  place which we had not discovered."</p>

  <p>"Again I must interrupt," said Ronald. "In Sir James's past life had there
  been any periods when he might have got mixed up with such a thing as a
  secret society, let us say, or with any organisation of a political or
  criminal character?"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you asked that question, because it was one of the first things
  we discussed. And beyond our knowledge that he had been pretty wild as a
  young man, and had been a lot in America, we could come to no conclusion. I
  think the correct way of putting it would be that, though we had no proof
  that he had become involved in anything of the sort, neither of us would have
  been surprised to hear that he had."</p>

  <p>"I get you," remarked Ronald. "Please continue."</p>

  <p>"Well, his death, of course, terminated my job and my life at Stalbridge
  Hall. Harry made a half-hearted suggestion that I should continue there, but
  it was clear that he didn't really mean it. And so I returned to London,
  where I have been since then until a week ago, when I got a letter from him
  asking me to go down and see him at once. He met me at the station with a
  peculiar look on his face, and the instant we got into the car he pulled this
  out of his pocket."</p>

  <p>As he spoke Stavert handed an open envelope to Ronald, who took out the
  contents.</p>

  <p>"'Place the papers on the seat by the summer-house.'</p>

  <p>"A facsimile, Mr. Standish, of the message his father had received, even
  to the extent, I should think, of being written on the same machine."</p>

  <p>Ronald held it up to the light; then he examined it carefully through a
  magnifying glass. After which he laid it on the table. "Well&mdash;what
  happened then?"</p>

  <p>"We discussed what was the best thing to do. Clearly we could not comply
  with the request, since there were no papers as far as we knew. Equally
  clearly we could not go to the police, since on the face of it the message
  did not seem one to cause alarm. It was only the fact that it was the second
  one that gave it its significance, and to admit that it was the second one
  was to admit that we had suppressed the first. So we finally decided that we
  would lie up in wait by the summer-house and see what happened. Whoever it
  was who had written the note would have to come and see if the papers were
  there, and we then proposed to nab him."</p>

  <p>Ronald leaned forward expectantly: clearly he was interested.</p>

  <p>"For six nights we waited. Nothing happened; no one came near us. Once I
  thought I heard a movement in the undergrowth a little way off, but it may
  have been a fox. At any rate, our vigil was useless. And then came last
  night."</p>

  <p>He paused and lit a cigarette, and I noticed that his hand was trembling a
  little.</p>

  <p>"It was raining pretty hard after dinner, and Harry said that he'd be
  damned if he was going to get wet to the skin lying about in a damp wood. And
  so for the first time for a week we both went to bed. This morning, at seven
  o'clock, I was awakened by the footman, who was white and shaking.</p>

  <p>"'For God's sake come at once, sir,' he said. 'Sir Harry is dead!'</p>

  <p>"I sprang out of bed and dashed along to his room. He was sprawling on the
  floor, and there was a hole in the back of his head I could have put my fist
  in. When we turned him over it was obvious what had happened. The poor devil
  had been shot through the eye. So I immediately telephoned for the police and
  a doctor, and then, getting into a car, I came straight up to you."</p>

  <p>Ronald raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you waited to see the police, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I left a message as to where I was going, and told the butler to say
  I'd be back by noon. I felt there was nothing I could do at the moment, and I
  desperately wanted your advice. Would it be possible for you to come back
  with me now in the car?"</p>

  <p>"I will certainly do so," said Ronald. "But I think you must be prepared
  for a bit of a tail twisting from the police for bolting off like that. To
  put it mildly, it was a most irregular thing to do."</p>

  <p>"I can't help that, Mr. Standish," said the other. "If I'd waited there,
  there would have been interminable delays and red tape. You know what the
  local police are, and I want the best opinion on the spot at once before half
  the clues are obliterated."</p>

  <p>"What clues are there up to date?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But there must be some. I refuse to believe that a man can
  be murdered without any traces being left. And I want you to find those
  traces."</p>

  <p>Ronald rose.</p>

  <p>"All right, we'll come with you. By the way&mdash;did no one hear the
  shot?"</p>

  <p>"I heard nothing, and none of the servants mentioned it. So, presumably,
  no one did."</p>

  <p>"Strange;" said Ronald thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It's a big rambling house, and the servants' quarters are right at the
  other end."</p>

  <p>"Still, it takes a good deal of nerve to discharge a gun in the middle of
  the night when a house is quiet. However&mdash;we'll see."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">WE reached Stalbridge Hall about midday, to find, as Ronald
  had anticipated, a very ruffled Inspector. And his temper was not improved
  when he learned the reason of Stavert's absence. But after a while, having
  delivered himself of a suitable reprimand, he recovered sufficiently to tell
  us what he had found out.</p>

  <p>"The murderer," he remarked, "entered the house by way of the library
  window. If you care to verify the fact, Mr. Standish, by means of some subtle
  deduction, we can go there and see."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Inspector," said Ronald cheerily, with a wink at me. "I feel
  it will be a waste of time after what you've found out yourself, but still it
  can do no harm."</p>

  <p>The officer led the way to big room in one wing of the house. "If you look
  through the window," he continued, "you will see the marks of his footprints
  in the flower-bed outside. The ground is still damp and they are clearly
  visible. He then stood on the sill, and with a stout knife forced the hasp of
  the window: the damage to the woodwork is plain. In fact, he made no
  endeavour to conceal his mode of entry. There are traces of mud on the
  carpet, those nearest the window being particularly clear."</p>

  <p>He had opened the window as he spoke, and Ronald began to examine
  everything in his usual methodical way while the Inspector, with a barely
  concealed smile, watched him. And I must say that even I was a little
  surprised at the amount of time he took: the thing did indeed look obvious.
  The footprints outside, the mud on the window-sill and carpet, the splintered
  woodwork, all told their own tale.</p>

  <p>"Have you deduced anything fresh?" demanded the Inspector a little
  sarcastically, as Ronald closed the window again.</p>

  <p>"My dear Inspector, I'm sure you've seen everything there is to be seen,"
  answered Ronald mildly. "As you say, he certainly seemed determined that we
  should know how he got in. By the way, was this window shut or open this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Shut, but not bolted," said the other.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ronald. "Well&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"He proceeded to poison the dog&mdash;" continued the officer.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" cried Stavert. "Rollo poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"It was found lying dead in the hall just behind the banisters, and the
  doctor had no hesitation in saying it had been poisoned. You can see the body
  now."</p>

  <p>We followed him into the hall, and there, lying half concealed behind the
  staircase, was a big Airedale. And a glance at the stiff, rigid legs was
  sufficient to confirm the doctor's diagnosis.</p>

  <p>"Was he a good watch-dog?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said Stavert.</p>

  <p>"If he hadn't been, there would have been no necessity to poison him,"
  remarked the Inspector, with a pitying glance at Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Inspector," he answered humbly. "Very stupid of me not to have
  thought of that."</p>

  <p>The officer gave him a suspicious look, but Ronald's face was
  expressionless. And after a moment he led the way upstairs.</p>

  <p>"We are now going to the room where the late baronet was murdered," he
  continued. "Once again the murderer has left traces of mud, which are plainly
  visible on the light carpet."</p>

  <p>He flung open the door, and we walked in. The body, covered by a sheet,
  was lying on the bed, and Ronald lifted a corner and looked at the head. It
  was a ghastly wound, the only merciful thing being that death must have been
  absolutely instantaneous.</p>

  <p>"I see that there's no trace of scorching on the face," he remarked. "Have
  you found the bullet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Inspector "It was embedded in the wall behind the bed. And
  here, I must confess, I am a little nonplussed, for to the best of my belief
  I have never seen such a bullet before."</p>

  <p>He held it out to Ronald, whose face lit up the instant he saw it.</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder, Inspector," he cried. "And this accounts for what was
  puzzling me. This bullet was fired from a weapon which is far more common in
  America than it is here&mdash;a compressed-air rifle. At close range it is as
  deadly as an ordinary gun, and, bar a hiss when fired, it makes no noise.
  That's why you heard nothing, Mr. Stavert, and also why there is no sign of
  scorching."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded portentously.</p>

  <p>"I suspected something of the sort," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"But have you any clue as to the murderer?" cried Stavely.</p>

  <p>"At the moment&mdash;no," answered the Inspector. "And that is where you
  may be of help, and that is the reason your absence this morning was very
  unfortunate. Time has been lost, and in a case like this every moment is of
  value. Now, Mr. Stavert, what we want to find in a case of this sort is the
  motive. It is clear that your cousin was murdered by someone who possessed a
  good working knowledge of the house. Do you know of anyone who had a grudge
  against him?"</p>

  <p>"I knew very little of my cousin's life," said Stavert, "and still less of
  his friends and acquaintances. I know that he was very popular in his
  regiment."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stavert," interrupted Ronald, "I think you should tell the Inspector
  at once what you told me. And while you do so I will have a further look
  round. Come along, Bob. Now," he continued as we went down the stairs, "let's
  go back to the library. I want to have a final look at it unhampered by that
  mutton-headed policeman."</p>

  <p>Once again he studied the window-sill with the utmost care. Then he stood
  on it and examined the marks on the woodwork with his magnifying-glass. Then
  he looked at the flower-bed outside as if measuring its width in his mind's
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Just shut the window, Bob," he said, and I did so, leaving him balanced
  precariously on the sill outside. He paused for a moment; then he jumped,
  landing a good yard short of the grass on the other side of the bed.</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea?" I demanded, opening the window once more.</p>

  <p>"Get up yourself and jump," he said. "Jump as far as you can. Leave the
  window open."</p>

  <p>I did so, and found that I could clear the flower-bed with ease, owing to
  being able to crouch on the sill, while Ronald had had to stand upright.</p>

  <p>"And now," he continued, "we will remove my footmarks, lest the worthy
  Inspector should have a rush of blood to the head."</p>

  <p>He smoothed them over with his stick, and was lighting a cigarette as the
  officer, followed by Stavert, appeared at the window.</p>

  <p>"This is a most important development, Mr. Standish," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd find it so," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"It presents us, of course, at once with the motive: revenge because the
  papers were not forthcoming."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," cried Ronald. "But revenge on whose part?"</p>

  <p>"The man who typed the message. Who else?"</p>

  <p>"So that all you have to do is to lay your hands on him. It seems to me
  that you may find it a little difficult, in view of the fact that nobody
  knows what these papers consisted of."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it gives us one very important point to go on. This
  vendetta was not so much a personal one against the dead man, but it was more
  in the nature of a family feud. It is on Sir James's life, therefore, that we
  must concentrate rather than on his son's."</p>

  <p>"Very true," murmured Ronald. "It is a pleasure and a privilege to work
  with you, Inspector. By the way, Mr. Stavert, was your uncle ever in
  Australia?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, for a considerable time when he was a young man," answered Stavert
  in some surprise. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's a long shot. But I think you'll find that your cousin's
  murderer was a left-handed Australian, at least six feet tall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With red hair and a slight stammer," snorted the Inspector. "Really, Mr.
  Standish, this is hardly the moment for far-fetched jokes."</p>

  <p>"I don't think Mr. Standish is joking, Inspector," said Stavert quietly,
  turning to Ronald. "What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>But Ronald was looking thoroughly annoyed. "I am not in the habit of
  making far-fetched jokes on occasions such as this," he remarked shortly. "As
  I say&mdash;that is my opinion; you can take it or leave it."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel, giving me an imperceptible signal to follow
  him.</p>

  <p>"That will give 'em something to think about," he chuckled. "Hallo! Who is
  this, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>A youngish man was coming rapidly along the path towards us, carrying a
  small suit-case in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Is this true about poor old Harry?" he called out as soon as he saw
  us.</p>

  <p>"Are you his brother?" asked Ronald, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I got a wire this morning to say he was dead."</p>

  <p>"He was murdered last night," said Ronald gravely.</p>

  <p>"But in Heaven's name who wanted to murder the old chap?" cried the new
  baronet.</p>

  <p>"That's what we want to find out," answered Ronald.</p>

  <p>He glanced round. We were out of sight of the house.</p>

  <p>"I would like a few words with you before you go on," he continued. "I am
  going to make a somewhat peculiar request to you, and before I do so it is
  necessary for me to tell you who I am and why I'm here."</p>

  <p>Briefly he explained the situation, and as soon as he mentioned his name
  the other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, Mr. Standish. No need of any further
  introduction."</p>

  <p>"Good. Well, now you know that when your father died he had just received
  a letter telling him to put certain papers on the seat by the summer-
  house."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was told so afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Your brother received a similar notification a week ago."</p>

  <p>The other whistled.</p>

  <p>"The devil he did! So there's a connecting link between the two cases.
  One, too, that makes it look as if my old governor was murdered."</p>

  <p>He was staring at Ronald thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Just so. And now it's going to be your turn."</p>

  <p>He put down his suit-case and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Standish, this seems to me to be getting beyond a joke.
  What are these papers, anyway? Hasn't anybody got an idea?"</p>

  <p>"No one," said Ronald gravely. "But I think if you will do exactly what I
  say we shall be able to solve part of the mystery, at any rate. Are you by
  chance going to be married?"</p>

  <p>We both stared at him in blank amazement. The question was so completely
  unexpected.</p>

  <p>"I am not," the young man answered. "But what the deuce has that got to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"I told you, didn't I, that I was going to make a peculiar request?"
  continued Ronald. "And I'm coming to it now. I must beg of you to trust me,
  and to believe that, strange though it may seem to you, it gives the surest
  and safest way of solving this murder. You are in grave danger, Sir Richard.
  Not, of course, at this moment; but it is there, hanging over you. And I want
  to it remove it as soon as possible. Will you, therefore, remember that you
  are going to be married in a fortnight? That, owing to your brother's death,
  the ceremony will be a quiet one, but that you don't propose to postpone it?
  And that after it is over you will be leaving for a lengthy honeymoon on the
  Continent? Further, and this is the most vital thing of all, you are not to
  tell a single soul that your story is not the truth."</p>

  <p>The young baronet's eyes had been growing rounder and rounder as Ronald
  proceeded.</p>

  <p>"Well I'm damned!" he muttered at length. "Do you really mean it?"</p>

  <p>"Never more serious in my life," said Ronald quietly.</p>

  <p>"But who am I supposed to be marrying?"</p>

  <p>"There must surely be some girl, unknown to your cousin or the members of
  the household, who would fill the bill. Someone you've met at Brighton."</p>

  <p>"All right," said the young man. "I suppose I can invent somebody, if you
  think it is absolutely essential."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," answered Ronald. "And it's still more essential that no one
  should have the faintest suspicion that it is an invention. You are going to
  be married in a fortnight. So get that idea into your head. And there is one
  thing further. Should you receive a similar communication about the papers,
  let me know immediately in London. But do not tell anyone else that you have
  let me know. On that, Sir Richard, your life may depend. The line you must
  take up is that you think the whole thing is rot, and if the writer of the
  message plays any tricks with you, you are quite capable of dealing with him.
  Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly; I'll do it."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Ronald. "And not a word to a soul. Ah! here comes the
  Inspector with your cousin. We'll stroll on."</p>

  <p>"For the love of Pete, Ronald," I said, when we were out of earshot, "what
  is the great idea?"</p>

  <p>"All holders of an old title should be married," he answered, with a grin.
  "Perhaps it will inspire him to do so in reality."</p>

  <p>Then he grew serious again.</p>

  <p>"But there are certainly points about this case, Bob, which render it
  almost unique in my experience. And it's very lucky that we met that
  youngster when we did. Let's pray that he can play his part."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">DURING the next few days I found myself growing more and
  more bewildered over the whole thing. Try as I would, I could think of no
  explanation for this supposed marriage, and Ronald was not communicative. But
  as time went on, and more than a week elapsed since the murder, I noticed
  that he became a little uneasy. He would never go far from the telephone, and
  whenever a post arrived he went eagerly through his letters.</p>

  <p>The verdict at the inquest had been the only one possible in the
  circumstances&mdash;"Murder by some person or persons unknown." The Inspector
  had been congratulated on his reconstruction of the crime, especially his
  discovery of the type of weapon that had been used, and was now, according to
  the papers, hot on a clue.</p>

  <p>It was on the tenth day that the telephone rang while we were at
  breakfast, and Ronald went to it. And I saw at once from his face that it was
  the message he had been waiting for.</p>

  <p>"It's come, has it?" he said. "Excellent. Now listen to me, Sir Richard,
  and obey my instructions literally. You will be quite safe till tonight. I
  want you to be thoroughly bombastic about it the whole of today, and refuse
  point-blank to tell the police. Is your cousin with you? Coming back this
  afternoon? Tell him, of course, that you've received it, but do not let him
  keep watch with you tonight. Tell him that at dinner. You propose to be alone
  in your bedroom. No&mdash;don't tell anyone that you've rung me up. Now,
  there's a big set-in cupboard in your room; you've got to smuggle us into
  that somehow without anybody knowing. You can do that, can you, if we get
  down about nine, All right&mdash;the side door by the shrubbery. I remember
  it. And don't forget that it's vitally important that you should announce at
  dinner in front of the servants your determination to sleep alone."</p>

  <p>"So it's worked, Bob," said Ronald, as he hung up the receiver. "The third
  message has been sent, though I was getting a bit worried. That supposed
  marriage was drawing rather too close."</p>

  <p>"But what would that have had to do with it?" I demanded, scenting a
  chance of finding some ray of light in my mental fog.</p>

  <p>"Well, it would have upset things rather if he'd had to admit he wasn't
  even engaged," said Ronald, with a grin. "Seems such a funny thing to lie
  about, doesn't it? Almost qualifies him for a mental home."</p>

  <p>"Confound you, you know I don't mean that!" I cried.</p>

  <p>But he only grinned the more. "Think it over, Bob. Use the old grey
  matter."</p>

  <p>And I was still pondering at ten o'clock that night as I stood beside
  Ronald in the cupboard of Sir Richard's bedroom. He had got us in safely
  unseen by anyone, and there was nothing for it now but to wait. A footman
  came in to turn the bed down for the night, and at eleven o'clock the baronet
  came upstairs.</p>

  <p>He stopped for a moment or two talking to his cousin outside, and we heard
  the latter begging him to be allowed to share the vigil. But Sir Richard was
  adamant, and after saying good night cheerfully, he came in and shut the
  door. And a few seconds later Stavert's door closed also.</p>

  <p>"All right?" asked the youngster, coming over to the cupboard.</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Ronald, in a low voice. "Get undressed, and go to bed. I
  want you to turn about in it so as to give it the normal appearance of having
  been slept in."</p>

  <p>Ronald crossed the room, and noiselessly locked the door. Then, opening a
  bag he had brought down with him, he took out a life-size wax head and
  shoulders. He looked critically at the colour of the hair; then at the
  baronet's.</p>

  <p>"Not too bad from memory," he muttered. "Now we'll set the scene."</p>

  <p>We watched him as he carefully arranged a bolster and a pair of hunting
  boots under the bed-clothes, moving them this way and that till the result
  was exactly like a body. Then he put the head sideways on the pillow and
  pulled up the sheet around it till only the hair and a bit of the forehead
  were visible. And finally he unlocked the door again and turned out the
  light.</p>

  <p>"It might be better," he said "but it will serve. Into the cupboard with
  you, Sir Richard: all we can do now is to wait."</p>

  <p>The house grew silent, though every crack of the boards sounded like a
  pistol-shot in the stillness. But is was not until the clock in the hall had
  just chimed two that I felt Ronald's hand tighten on my arm. A door had
  opened somewhere. I listened intently, though I could scarcely hear anything
  save the pounding of my own heart. And then quite distinctly came the sound
  of footsteps along the passage. They paused outside the room, and I heard Sir
  Richard draw in his breath sharply.</p>

  <p>There came a low knock; then the door handle was tried. Some one was
  coming in: and tense with excitement I peered over Ronald's shoulder through
  the chink we had left open. I could hear nothing now: the footsteps made no
  sound on the carpet. And for what seemed an eternity we waited.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a beam of light shone on the bed; and then every thing happened
  quickly. There came a sharp whistling hiss, and the splintering noise of the
  wax mould breaking. And then the room was flooded with light. Ronald was
  standing by the switch with a revolver in his hand. Herbert Stavert, his
  teeth snarling like a trapped animal's, leant against the bed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need trouble you any further," said Ronald calmly. "Ah!
  would you?"</p>

  <p>A shot rang out, and Stavert, with an oath, dropped the gun he had raised
  and clutched his shattered wrist.</p>

  <p>"So it was you, you swine," shouted Sir Richard. "By God! I wonder if
  they'll let me be present at the gallows?"</p>

  <p>"There's no crime in shooting a dummy," muttered Stavert at length.</p>

  <p>"From the word go, Stavert, I realised you were a fool," said Ronald
  deliberately. "But I should think that even you can't be such a complete
  imbecile as not to realise how utterly you've damned yourself by this
  performance. One question, and one question only, I would like to ask you
  from a point of academic interest. Did you murder your uncle? You refuse to
  answer? Perhaps you're right. You can only hang once; and your unfortunate
  cousin supplies the necessary evidence for that. Ring, Sir Richard, will you?
  We must get the police."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">"I DON'T think," said Ronald, an hour later, when Stavert
  had been taken away, "that I have ever struck a crime which was in some
  respects so carefully thought out, and in others so incredibly bungled. The
  conception was brilliant; the execution simply puerile. He left so many clues
  lying about that one simply fell over them.</p>

  <p>"Let us take the conception first, as he intended to do it. And for that
  we must go back to your father's death. You heard the question I asked him,
  but we may never know the answer. Was the whole thing an invention on
  Stavert's part, or did your father really receive that message? Stavert says
  he tore it up. It that the truth?</p>

  <p>"My own impression is that it is. There would not seem to have been much
  object in his murdering his uncle, and thereby depriving himself of an easy
  job and a pleasant home. And so I think the balance of probability is that
  his story with regard to your father is correct. He did receive a message,
  and if he was murdered it was not by Stavert.</p>

  <p>"Now come on to your brother. Stavert, finding that life in London was a
  very different proposition from his life here, began to think things over. He
  was hard up, and your brother was wealthy. And gradually the scheme must have
  taken shape in his brain. If he could avert all suspicion from himself by
  supplying a very plausible motive for some unknown person to have committed
  the crime, he was one step nearer the title. And one cannot deny that in
  outline his schemes was good. These mysterious papers, which were inherently
  quite probable, and the clear trail of a forced entry to the house&mdash;what
  more was necessary? And when in addition you realise the invaluable point, as
  far as he was concerned, that it did not throw suspicion on anybody in
  particular who would be able to prove his innocence, but merely on someone
  who could never be found, it must have looked a certainty to him. Then, of
  course, after a suitable lapse of time you would have been the next victim,
  and he steps into the whole shooting-box. Finally, he would send himself a
  similar message, and then by some strange piece of luck discover the papers.
  Faked, naturally, but good enough to end for ever the family tragedy.</p>

  <p>"So sure was he, in fact, after having killed your brother, that he was
  safe, that he took the extra bold step of coming up to me. And he certainly
  told his story so convincingly that when I motored down with him I had not
  the slightest suspicion of the truth. But when I arrived on the scene and
  looked round, a very different aspect of affairs came to light.</p>

  <p>"The first glaring error was the earth-mark on the window-sill. There was
  only one. Ostensibly the man had stood there some time while he worked at the
  catch. Why on earth should he stand on one leg? Then came the question of the
  dog: what was he doing all this while? He was found in the hall: why hadn't
  he barked? He must already have been dead. Who had killed him? Obviously
  someone in the house. And at once a different complexion came over the
  matter. Was it a servant, or who? I couldn't say at that time. But it was
  clear that there was a confederate, who had opened the window, after having
  first monkeyed with the catch as a blind, allowing the murderer to walk
  straight in, putting one foot on the sill. Further, he had then closed the
  window after the crime was committed, a point which I proved by the simple
  experiment of trying to jump the flower-bed. With the window shut no one
  could clear it; with it open it was easy. And there were no outgoing
  footsteps in the earth.</p>

  <p>"So far so good. But now a very pertinent point arose. Why this elaborate
  and obvious trail? Why didn't the confederate inside merely open the front
  door? There could be no reason for it save one&mdash;it was a false trail.
  The error lay in the fact that is was far too obviously false. It was
  condemned as soon as you looked into it. And it knocked out the possibility
  of two people being involved.</p>

  <p>"We were getting warm then. The murderer couldn't get into the house
  without a confederate. If there had been a confederate he would have opened
  the front door. Therefore there was no confederate. So the murderer must have
  been inside the house. How did that fit in? And I soon saw that it fitted
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>"The murderer stood on the inside of the sill before his shoes were muddy,
  and cut the woodwork round the catch. Then he opened the window, cleared the
  flower-bed, came back and shut the window. Then, realising he was supposed to
  be a stranger, he poisoned the dog. Previous to that, in all probability, he
  had murdered your brother, who might otherwise have been aroused by the
  noise. Who was it?</p>

  <p>"Who was most likely to have been able to go into your brother's room in
  the middle of the night without arousing his suspicions? Who was most likely
  to have in his possession an expensive and very rare gun? It was beginning to
  look obvious. So I made a ridiculous statement about a left-handed Australian
  to throw him off the scent; and then luckily met you, when I surprised you by
  my matrimonial suggestion. I saw at once that by that method we could bring
  things to a head. If my suspicions were right, he would have to strike, and
  strike quickly. Which he did, with the result we know."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a minute, Standish," cried Sir Richard. "Why should my supposed
  marriage make him strike quickly?"</p>

  <p>Ronald grinned gently.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "messages ordering papers to be placed in the
  summer-house can be delivered to grown men. But they lose much of their
  efficacy if delivered to the twins in a bassinet."</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">VII. &mdash; MYSTERY OF THE SLIP COACH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, I'll be danged. She's signalled through, and yet
  she's stopping, though she's late already. Be there summat up?"</p>

  <p>The stationmaster of Marley Junction scratched his head, and stared at the
  oncoming express which was now slowing down rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she supposed to stop?" Ronald Standish asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; she ain't. There be a slip coach for here, but main part goes
  through."</p>

  <p>Rows of heads were already protruding from carriage windows as the train
  came to a standstill, and the guard got out.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Joe?" demanded the stationmaster.</p>

  <p>"Murder's the matter," was the unexpected answer; and with a lift of his
  eyebrows Ronald turned to the other member of our little party.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be having a busy time of it, Inspector," he said, and with an
  expression of relief the two railway officials turned round.</p>

  <p>"Are you the police, sir?" cried the guard.</p>

  <p>"I'm Inspector Grantham of Scotland Yard," answered the other, "What's
  that you say? Murder!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. And I'll be pleased if you can come this way, for we're a lot
  behind time. He's in the slip coach."</p>

  <p>We followed him to the rear of the train, paying no attention to the
  excited conjectures of the passengers, several of whom had got out on the
  platform. And as we got to the back carriage an irascible-looking, elderly
  man, who might have been a retired colonel, an old clergyman and his wife,
  and a young man of perhaps thirty, with a worried expression on his face,
  descended.</p>

  <p>The Inspector paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"This coach is separate from the rest of the train, I take it?" he said.
  "There's no connecting corridor?"</p>

  <p>"That's so, sir," said the guard, "as you can see. No one can pass farther
  than my van, which is just in front of it."</p>

  <p>"Then get the coach uncoupled. And all passengers, please, who were in
  this coach must wait."</p>

  <p>He entered, and we followed him along the corridor of the carriage. The
  stationmaster had gone off to give the necessary orders; the guard
  accompanied us.</p>

  <p>"Everything is as it was found, sir," he said. "After the train was
  stopped I travelled in this coach myself."</p>

  <p>"Why did the train stop? I thought this was fast to Downwater?"</p>

  <p>"Communication cord was pulled, sir, by the reverend gentleman."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"We'll go into that later," he said. "Where's the body?"</p>

  <p>For answer, the guard opened the door of the centre compartment. On the
  seat by the opposite window was sprawling the body of a man. One hand hung
  limply downwards, and on the cushion and the carpet lay an ominous red pool.
  A glance was sufficient to show that he was dead, and that the cause of death
  was a wound in the head. The window was shut; his, suit-case littered up the
  rack; and in the opposite corner to the body a pair of wash-leather gloves
  was lying on the seat.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ronald gave a whistle.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he cried, "it's old Samuel Goldberg, the book maker."</p>

  <p>"You know him?" said the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I've betted with him from time to time," Ronald answered. "But all in due
  course, for you'll have to do something about this train, Grantham. Why not
  let it go on with a relief guard and run this coach into a siding."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded, and a few moments later the express was speeding on
  her way, whilst the slip coach, with us still on board, was shunted off the
  main line.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I knew him, Grantham," said Ronald. "He was a bookmaker, and
  quite a decent fellow. Great Scott! What's that mess?"</p>

  <p>He was studying the woodwork of the door with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;it's the remains of a raw egg! Here are bits of the shell on
  the carpet. And there's the place it hit the door. What an extraordinary
  thing to find in a railway carriage. Did you notice it, guard, when you came
  in?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say as 'ow I did, sir. I was so worried and bemused that I didn't
  think of little things like that. When I sees there was nothing to be done
  for the poor gentleman I just shut the door again and started the train off
  after telling the driver to stop her here."</p>

  <p>"And you shut the window, too?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. The window was shut already. Both the window and the door was
  shut when I got here."</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better start our investigation, Mr. Standish," said the
  Inspector. "We can come back again later to the body. Pull down the
  blinds"&mdash;he turned to the stationmaster&mdash;"and lock the carriage up.
  No one is to enter it."</p>

  <p>We found the other occupants of the coach pacing about the platform. The
  young man had joined up with the clergyman and his wife; the irascible
  military man was fuming visibly.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll hurry this business as much as possible," he cried
  irritably. "I'm judging hounds this afternoon, and I shall be late. I may say
  that I knew nothing about it till the train was stopped."</p>

  <p>"Quite, sir, quite," said the Inspector soothingly. "But in view of the
  fact that a man has been found dead in circumstances which preclude natural
  causes, you will appreciate that I must make inquiries. Now, sir," he turned
  to the clergyman, "I understand that it was you who pulled the communication
  cord and stopped the train. Presumably, therefore, it was you who first
  discovered the body. Will you tell me all you know? First&mdash;your name,
  please."</p>

  <p>"I am the Reverend John Stocker," said the old man, "of the parish of
  Meston, not far from here. And really I fear I can tell you but little of
  this terrible affair. I was reading in my carriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which compartment did you occupy, Mr. Stocker?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see&mdash;which was it, my love?" he asked his wife.</p>

  <p>"The third-class one&mdash;two away," she answered promptly.</p>

  <p>"Please proceed," said the Inspector, making a note.</p>

  <p>"It so chanced," continued the clergyman, "that I happened to glance out
  of the window at a passing train. It was travelling in the same direction as
  ourselves, at about the same speed, on the next line. I watched it idly, as
  we very slowly overtook it, when suddenly, to my amazement, I saw some people
  in the train beckoning to me. They were shouting and pointing, and though, of
  course, I could not hear what they said, it seemed to me by their agitation
  that something must be wrong, and that, whatever that something was, it was
  in our train. So I got up and walked along the corridor to find, to my
  horror, the body of that unfortunate man."</p>

  <p>"What did you do then?" said the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I pulled the communication cord."</p>

  <p>"Did you go into the carriage?"</p>

  <p>"No, I did not. The door was shut, and the sight had unnerved me."</p>

  <p>"And what happened then?"</p>

  <p>"This gentleman"&mdash;he indicated the hound judge&mdash;"came out from
  his compartment at the other end of the carriage, and I called to him. He
  came at once, and I showed him what had happened. By that time, of course,
  the train was slowing up."</p>

  <p>"Quite correct," barked the other. "I went&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir, if you please," said the Inspector. "Your name?"</p>

  <p>"Blackton&mdash;Major Blackton. Late of the Gunners."</p>

  <p>"Now, sir. When you saw the dead man what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Opened the door, and went in to make certain, though, when you've seen as
  many men shot through the head as I have, it was obvious to me at first sight
  that he was beyond aid."</p>

  <p>"Did you shut the window?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I did not. The window was already shut. I noticed it
  particularly, because I remember thinking to myself what an odd thing it was
  that a man should be travelling with both door and window shut on a hot day
  like this."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Any more you'd like to say, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, my first thought," continued Major Blackton, "was that it was
  a case of suicide."</p>

  <p>"Why naturally?"</p>

  <p>"Damme, man. I hadn't shot the feller, and it wasn't likely the padre had,
  and at that time I thought we were the only people in the coach. However,
  when I found no sign of any weapon on the floor or the seat I realised it
  couldn't be suicide. That wound caused instantaneous death, or I'm no judge
  of such matters, so that by no human possibility could he have got rid of the
  gun."</p>

  <p>Once again the Inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"You said, sir," he remarked after a pause, "that at that time you thought
  you were the only people on the coach. When did you find you weren't?"</p>

  <p>"Just before the train stopped, when that young man joined us in the
  corridor. And it seems to me that he might be able to tell you something,
  because he'd been talking to the dead man."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Because he said so. 'Good God!' he said, 'what's happened? I was only
  talking to him ten minutes ago.' Then he had another look and said: 'What on
  earth has he done that for?' And by that time the train had stopped and the
  guard took charge."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"That's positively all I can tell you, Inspector, so with your permission
  I'll get away."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir," said the Inspector quietly, "but at the present juncture
  that is quite impossible. You don't seem to realise," he continued a little
  sternly, "that a man has, so far as we know, just been murdered under
  conditions that render it imperative that the other occupants of the coach
  should place themselves unreservedly at the disposal of the police. Other
  points may arise over which I shall want to see you later. And now, before
  interrogate the other gentleman, there is one further question. Did either of
  you two gentlemen hear the sound of a shot?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly didn't," said Major Blackton, "but then I was at the far end
  of the coach."</p>

  <p>"I didn't, either." The clergyman glanced at his wife. "Did you, my
  love?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head decidedly.</p>

  <p>"I heard nothing," she said. "Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, madam." He beckoned to the young man. "Now, sir, will you tell
  me what you know of this affair? First&mdash;your name?"</p>

  <p>"Carter&mdash;Harry Carter."</p>

  <p>"Did you know the dead man?"</p>

  <p>"I did," said Carter quietly.</p>

  <p>"What was his name?"</p>

  <p>"Samuel Goldberg."</p>

  <p>"Had you spoken to him since leaving London?"</p>

  <p>"I had a long talk with him. That's what made it so amazing because he
  seemed his usual self when I left his compartment."</p>

  <p>The Inspector consulted his notebook.</p>

  <p>"You said to Major Blackton: 'What on earth has he done that for?' or
  words to that effect. What did you mean by that remark?"</p>

  <p>Carter stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Just what I said. I couldn't make out why he should commit suicide."</p>

  <p>"Why should you assume it was suicide?"</p>

  <p>Carter stared at him even harder. "What else could it have been? Unless it
  was an accident."</p>

  <p>"It was neither suicide nor an accident, Mr. Carter. Goldberg was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"Murdered? But who by?"</p>

  <p>"That is what we are endeavouring to find out. Now, Mr Carter, am I to
  understand that you didn't hear Major Blackton and the guard talking in the
  corridor after the train started again and saying it was murder?"</p>

  <p>"I did not, and for a very good reason. I returned almost at once to my
  own compartment to try and think out how this very unexpected development was
  going to affect me."</p>

  <p>Ihe Inspector stopped writing and glanced at Standish. Then he looked
  steadily at Carter.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Carter," he said gravely, "it is my duty to say one thing it you. We
  are investigating a case of murder, and everything points to the fact that
  the murderer was one of the people who travelled from London in that slip
  coach. You need not tell me anything that might, in certain eventualities,
  incriminate you."</p>

  <p>Carter stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he burst out at length, "you aren't suggesting that I had
  anything to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"I am suggesting nothing," answered the Inspector shortly. "I am merely
  pointing out your possible future position. And having done so I will now ask
  you in what way Goldberg's death could affect you? You need not answer if you
  don't wish to."</p>

  <p>"But, of course, I wish to. I've got nothing to hide. I owed him money,
  and I was wondering whether his suicide&mdash;as I then thought it
  was&mdash;would wipe out this debt."</p>

  <p>"Had your discussion with him previously concerned this debt?"</p>

  <p>"It had," said Carter.</p>

  <p>"Was it an acrimonious interview?" asked the Inspector mildly.</p>

  <p>"Well, when you ask your bookie not to press for payment and he cuts up
  rough, it's not very pleasant."</p>

  <p>"And it terminated some ten minutes before you found that Goldberg had, as
  you thought, committed suicide?"</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"May I ask how much was the sum involved?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Inspector Grantham tapped his teeth with his pencil. "One final question,
  Mr. Carter. Did you know that Goldberg was going to travel by this
  train?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't an idea of it until I found him in the same coach."</p>

  <p>The inspector rose and closed his notebook with a snap. "That is all for
  the present," he said, and then, for the first time, Ronald spoke.</p>

  <p>"I should like to ask you two or three other questions, Mr. Carter. When
  you had your interview with Goldberg, did you sit by the door?"</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;in the opposite corner to him. By Jove! now I come to think
  of it, I've left my gloves there!"</p>

  <p>"Was the window open?"</p>

  <p>Carter thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It was: wide."</p>

  <p>"And the door?"</p>

  <p>"Shut."</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Carter, I want you to think carefully. Did he throw a raw egg at
  you?"</p>

  <p>Carter stared at Ronald with a look of utter amazement, which changed to
  an angry flush.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to be funny? Because, if so, it seems to me neither the
  time nor the place. A raw egg? Why the devil should he throw one at me?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Ronald. "Why the devil should he? Well Grantham, what do
  you propose to do now?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector, who had frowned slightly at Ronald's last question, again
  took charge.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I must request you three gentlemen, and you, too, madam, to
  remain here for a little while yet. I know, sir, I know about your hound
  show, but this is even more important. Guard, come with me. And you too, Mr.
  Standish&mdash;if you care to."</p>

  <p>We returned to the slip coach and the guard unlocked the door. Then,
  leaving him on the platform, we entered the carriage.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Mr. Standish?" said the Inspectors</p>

  <p>"At the moment, Grantham, remarkably little," said Ronald "There are one
  or two very strange features about the case. Have you come to any conclusion
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Only to the obvious one that Goldberg was murdered by some one who was in
  this coach. Further than that I would not care to go, though it would be idle
  to deny that of the four occupants the most likely is Carter. Of course, it
  is possible that there was someone else in the carriage who escaped when the
  train stopped but there are two grave difficulties to put up against that
  theory. First, it was the clergyman who pulled the communication cord.
  Surely, the murderer would have done it himself. And even if he didn't, but
  had seized on this unlooked-for chance of escaping, he would have been bound
  to be seen by people in the train. I mean, one knows that when a train stops
  unexpectedly everyone's head goes out of the window."</p>

  <p>"And what about the egg?" remarked Ronald thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Confound the egg!" cried Grantham irritably. "You've got it on the
  brain."</p>

  <p>"I have," agreed Ronald, unperturbed. "But before we go any farther, let
  us examine the compartment thoroughly again."</p>

  <p>I watched them from the corridor for ten minutes, and at the end of that
  time the Inspector came out and joined me.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of value; no trace of any weapon."</p>

  <p>"And no trace of any more eggs," said Ronald. "Now, don't get angry,
  Inspector. I'm not fooling. But when an extremely bizarre fact intrudes
  itself on one it is advisable not to overlook it. Now, have you ever heard of
  a man carrying one raw egg about with him? Frequently have I known people to
  take half a dozen or even three in a paper bag, but not one. There isn't even
  a paper bag. Was he, then, carrying this solitary egg in his hand or in his
  pocket? However, let us go on a little further. Assuming for the moment that
  he had got this one egg, why did he throw it at the door? It seems a strange
  pastime."</p>

  <p>"Your second point is easier to answer than your first," said the
  Inspector. "Goldberg was unarmed, and when he looked and saw the murderer
  standing in the carriage he threw the first thing thing that came to
  hand."</p>

  <p>"This solitary egg." Ronald stared at him thoughtfully. "Was he holding
  it, studying its beauty? Or was it on the seat beside him? However, perhaps I
  am over-stressing the point. Where are you off to now?"</p>

  <p>"To get on with the case, Mr. Standish," answered the Inspector tersely.
  "I don't know how or why that egg got there, but I do know that that man was
  murdered. Almost certainly the murderer flung the weapon out of the window,
  but it is just possible he did not. So my first move will be to search the
  baggage of the four people I have detained."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Ronald quietly. "Have I your permission to wait here a
  little longer? There are one or two more points I would like to look into,
  and I will, of course, pass on anything to you."</p>

  <p>With a faint smile the Inspector departed and Ronald turned to me.</p>

  <p>"There's something very rum, Bob&mdash;very rum indeed about this affair.
  Apart from the egg, who shut the window? Did Goldberg, after Carter had left
  him? Did the murderer, either before or after he'd done it? Or is Carter
  lying? I don't think he is."</p>

  <p>Ronald was talking half to himself.</p>

  <p>"To place too much reliance on faces is dangerous, but I don't think he
  is. His evidence has the ring of truth. And I ask you&mdash;would he have
  left his gloves here if he'd done it?"</p>

  <p>He went back into the compartment and stood staring round.</p>

  <p>"The clergyman&mdash;what about him? And our military friend? As things
  are, the clergyman is the more likely, as the other had to pass the door to
  get to this compartment. Moreover, we only have the clergyman's word that he
  saw people beckoning to him from the other train. It's unlikely, of course,
  but it's conceivable that he, too, was in debt to Goldberg, and has staged a
  pretty piece of acting the innocent after killing him. Means his wife is in
  collusion with him, but stranger things have happened. But it's that damned
  egg that beats me."</p>

  <p>"Well, old boy," I said, "I admit it's very peculiar as you say, but it
  seems to me we've got to accept it as a fact that Goldberg was in possession
  of one raw egg. I mean, it isn't likely the murderer came with an egg in one
  hand and a gun in the other."</p>

  <p>Ronald spun round and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! Bob," he cried, "I believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, and dashed into the next compartment, where he
  opened and shut the window several times, while I looked on in blank
  amazement. What on earth there was in my semi-jocular remark that had caused
  this activity was beyond me, butt I knew better than to ask. And then he
  returned to the scene of the murder, and kneeling down on the floor by the
  door he examined the sticky mess of shell and yolk on the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Hopeless," he muttered, "hopeless; but&mdash;ah!"</p>

  <p>He was carefully picking out a piece of shell, which he placed on the
  seat. The search continued: two other pieces were selected, which, after a
  further scrutiny, he roughly joined together.</p>

  <p>"Do you see, Bob?" he cried.</p>

  <p>I did and I didn't. Stamped in violet ink on the fragments were some
  letters. On one piece was written "atch"; on the other, "ways." Presumably
  part of the name of the firm where the egg had been bought, and I said so.
  But what further light that fact threw on the matter was beyond me, and I
  said that, too.</p>

  <p>He put the bits of shell into an empty match-box, as there came the sound
  of people getting into the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right, Bob; we'll see," he said, slipping the box into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Inspector Grantham was coming along the corridor, and with him was a man
  carrying a small black bag. A doctor obviously, but the thing that struck me
  at once was the expression of subdued triumph on the Inspector's face.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, doctor," he said. "And as soon as you've made your
  preliminary examination I'll have the body moved to a waiting-room."</p>

  <p>Then, as the doctor entered the compartment, he joined us in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"I've found the revolver, Mr. Standish," he remarked complacently.</p>

  <p>"You have, have you?" said Ronald. "Where?"</p>

  <p>"In one of Carter's suit-cases."</p>

  <p>"Was it loaded?"</p>

  <p>"No, but there was a half-open packet of ammunition. And that's better
  than your raw egg, I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"How does he account for its being there?" demanded Ronald, ignoring the
  gibe.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't. He simply says he was taking it down to the country with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Which," said Ronald, "is probably the truth."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," agreed the Inspector. "I don't suppose for a moment
  that he brought it on the train to shoot Goldberg, but with Goldberg in the
  same carriage with him he yielded to the temptation. Come, come, Mr.
  Standish," he went on good humouredly, "you're very smart and all that, but
  really there is no good trying to pretend that there is any mystery here.
  Goldberg was shot by someone in this carriage. Carter admits having had a bad
  quarrel with him; Carter is in possession of a revolver and ammunition.
  Moreover, no sign of arms can be found on the other three people concerned.
  The thing is as plain a pikestaff."</p>

  <p>And I saw that Ronald looked worried.</p>

  <p>"Too plain, Grantham," he said. "Altogether too plain. But if you're right
  there's only one place Carter ought to be sent to, and that's a lunatic
  asylum. The man must be crazy. Why on earth didn't he throw the gun out of
  the window?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Like your raw egg, Mr. Standish, I can't tell you," he remarked. "Well,
  doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Killed instantaneously, of course," said the other, joining us. "If you
  will have the body moved, Inspector, I will carry on at once."</p>

  <p>The Inspector bustled off, followed by the doctor, and Ronald turned to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Bad, Bob; damned bad," he said, and I have seldom seen him look so
  grave.</p>

  <p>"You think Carter did it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I am as certain as I can be of anything that he didn't," he answered
  quietly. "But on the face of it, Carter's position is about as serious as it
  could well be."</p>

  <p>And so Carter evidently realised. We found him in the custody of a
  policeman, and the instant he saw us he sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Look here, sir," he cried to Ronald, "I don't know who you gentlemen are,
  but I assume you're something to do with the police. Well, all I can tell you
  is that I swear before Heaven I had no more to do with the death of Samuel
  Goldberg than you had! I often take a revolver with me when I go down to stay
  with my uncle. I'm a very keen shot, and potting at rabbits is marvellous
  practice."</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Carter," said Ronald, holding out his hand. "Bu there's no
  good blinding yourself to the fact that a combination of circumstances has
  put you in a very awkward corner."</p>

  <p>Carter's expression, which h cleared at Ronald's first words, clouded
  again.</p>

  <p>"It's hideous," he cried passionately. "It's like a nightmare. I'm not a
  fool, and I see the gravity of the situation. Someone in the carriage must
  have shot him and I'm found with a gun. But if I'd done it should I have kept
  the revolver?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I said to the inspector," said Ronald, with a grave smile.
  "But you may depend on one thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off.</p>

  <p>"Hallo! Grantham doesn't look too happy."</p>

  <p>The Inspector was coming along the platform with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Carter," he said, "I must apologise."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Carter almost shouted.</p>

  <p>"The bullet doesn't fit your revolver."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two there was dead silence. Then Ronald stepped up to
  Carter and clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations," he said. "Well out of a nasty position."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Carter quietly. "I don't want to go through another half-
  hour like that again. I don't blame you in the slightest degree, Inspector;
  it must have looked a cert to you. But you can imagine my feelings, knowing I
  hadn't done it."</p>

  <p>"I apologise again," said the Inspector. "But, damn it," he burst out,
  "who did? Well, it will be a question of searching the line till we find the
  revolver that that bullet does fit."</p>

  <p>"You never will," remarked Ronald, lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Grantham.</p>

  <p>"Because it isn't there."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're going to tell me next that Goldberg wasn't shot at all,"
  said the Inspector sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"No, not that. But once again I am going to suggest to you that you
  consider in all its aspects the extraordinary phenomenon of the raw egg."</p>

  <p>"Any other points?" asked the Inspector, impressed in spite of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Two," said Ronald. "First&mdash;the strange fact that the window was open
  when Carter's interview with Goldberg finished, and was shut when the body
  was found. Second&mdash;that Carter is certainly not the only person in the
  world who owes Goldberg money."</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" exploded Grantham, "I believe you know who did it."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," said Ronald emphatically. "Moreover, it is quite possible I
  never shall. But we'll see. Once again congratulations, Carter, on a lucky
  escape. If that bullet had fitted your gun you would have been in the soup.
  Come on, Bob; here's our train coming. I've just got time to ask the guard of
  the express one question."</p>

  <p>And the only remark he made to me the whole way up to London added
  considerably to my mental confusion.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Bob," he said. "You solved that in masterly fashion."</p>

  <p>"I solved it!" I spluttered.</p>

  <p>"Of course you did, old boy. When you said the murderer had an egg in one
  hand and a revolver in the other."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR the next few days I did not see him at all. The
  newspapers, naturally, were full of the case, and interviews were published
  with all four of the other occupants of the carriage. In fact, "The Mystery
  of the Slip Coach" appealed immensely to the man in the street, owing to the
  strange circumstances of the crime.</p>

  <p>And it certainly was a baffling affair. As far as the public was
  concerned, it was obvious that one of the four people in the coach was
  guilty, and in most clubs betting on the final result was frequent. And it
  was inevitable that Carter should prove the favourite in spite of the fact
  that the shot did not fit his revolver. The Vicar and his wife were a
  delightful old pair who had lived a blameless life for years at Meston; Major
  Blackton turned out to be an extremely wealthy man who had just returned to
  England after a prolonged absence abroad, and who had never heard of Goldberg
  in his life.</p>

  <p>"You mark my words," said a man one day to me, "young Carter did it, and
  he's a mighty deep 'un. Shall I tell you how? He had a second revolver. D'you
  get me? The gun he shot Goldberg with he bunged out of the window, leaving
  the other one to be found."</p>

  <p>The trouble was that in spite of an army of searchers no trace of another
  gun could be found. A large reward was offered by the police, without
  producing any result, and another theory was started. Carter must have had a
  confederate who picked up the revolver when it was thrown from the train. And
  that held the field for quite a time, till it was conclusively proved that
  Goldberg had only decided to go by that train on the very morning in
  question, and that it was, therefore, utterly impossible for Carter to have
  known about it in time to make any such arrangements.</p>

  <p>Another source of information from which the police had hoped to derive
  some help proved of no assistance. The people in the other train, who had
  first seen the body, could say nothing which threw any more light on matters.
  They were two young men, one of whom was standing up at the window watching
  the express as it gradually overtook them. He had seen the body sprawling on
  the seat and realising that something was amiss, he had, with his companion,
  attracted the Vicar's attention. But of one thing they were positive: the
  window of Goldberg's carriage was shut. And as time went on it began to look
  as if the mystery would prove insoluble, which would have been unpleasant for
  Carter. For there was no doubt that a large percentage of the public believed
  that in some way or other he had done it. And even though that belief was
  only due to the fact that it was most unlikely that any of the other three
  was guilty&mdash;that it was arrived at by a process of elimination, and was
  not the result of any positive evidence&mdash;it made things no better for
  him.</p>

  <p>And then one morning I got a phone message from Ronald, asking me to go
  round to his rooms. He was not in when I got there, but somewhat to my
  surprise, I found Inspector Grantham.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Mr. Miller," he said gloomily. "I hope Mr. Standish has found
  out something, for this case isn't doing me any good."</p>

  <p>"I know he doesn't think it was Carter," I said.</p>

  <p>"Then who could it have been?" he cried. "But I can't arrest him. We
  haven't a shred of evidence. If only we could find the gun it was done
  with."</p>

  <p>The door opened and Ronald entered.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Mr. Meredith," he said, nodding to us. "Here are the other two
  gentlemen who I know will be interested in our little venture."</p>

  <p>A morose-looking individual entered as he was speaking, who contemplated
  us suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"You remember, Bob," Ronald went on, "our ideas about a chicken farm.
  Well&mdash;I've found the very spot, and Mr. Meredith is quite willing to
  sell."</p>

  <p>"Give me my figure, and you can have it tomorrow," said the newcomer. "Not
  that it isn't a good proposition: it is. But I haven't the money to run it.
  I'll have a drop of Scotch, thank you."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the Inspector as Ronald filled a glass, but his face was
  impassive. Only the faintest of winks showed that he realised something was
  up, but I knew he was as much in the dark as I was.</p>

  <p>"Here's how," said Meredith, and drained his drink. "Well, gentlemen, do
  we talk business?"</p>

  <p>"No time like the present," said Ronald cheerfully, ringing the bell.
  "Take away that empty glass, will you, Sayers," he told his man, "and bring
  in some more clean ones. Now, Mr. Meredith, I understand Hatchaways is for
  sale, and that the price you are asking is fifteen hundred pounds?"</p>

  <p>"That is correct," agreed the other, his eyes sparkling greedily.</p>

  <p>"And it is not mortgaged nor encumbered in any way?"</p>

  <p>"No; the property is quite clear."</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Sayers came in carrying some more glasses. And as he
  put them down I saw him nod to Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Have you had to borrow any money on the place, Mr. Meredith?" continued
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"You'll pardon me, Mr. Standish, but I don't see that that has anything to
  do with you," said Meredith truculently.</p>

  <p>"You didn't borrow, for instance, from Samuel Goldberg, who has recently
  been murdered?"</p>

  <p>Meredith gave one uncontrollable start. Then he pulled himself
  together.</p>

  <p>"Never heard of the man till I saw his death in the paper."</p>

  <p>"Strange," said Ronald quietly. "He was a complete stranger to you,
  maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Absolute."</p>

  <p>"Then why, Meredith, did you throw that egg through his open window on the
  Downwater express as his carriage came level with yours?"</p>

  <p>Meredith lurched to his feet and tried to bluster. But there was sick fear
  in his face and Grantham moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"It's a cursed lie," he said thickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it isn't," answered Ronald sternly. "On the shell of the egg you
  threw are fingerprints: on the glass you've just drunk from are fingerprints.
  And those fingerprints are identical. There's your man, Grantham. He murdered
  Samuel Goldberg by shooting him through the head from the other train."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, and then with a roar of rage Meredith
  whipped a revolver out of his pocket. But he was too late. Grantham was on
  him like a flash.</p>

  <p>"And that is the gun, Inspector," continued Ronald, calmly, "that I told
  you you would not find on the permanent way."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I WISH to Heaven you'd elucidate, old boy," I said a few
  minutes later, "for it's the smartest thing I've ever known."</p>

  <p>Ronald filled his pipe thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You may remember, Bob," he said, "that after your illuminating remark I
  went into the next compartment and started monkeying about with the window.
  Now, there are two main types of fitting in trains. The more common has a
  long strap, and with that sort, when the strap has been pulled to the full
  extent, an outward push on the bottom of the window is necessary to keep it
  shut. The other type has no strap, but a slot in the top sash which, when
  pulled up to the full extent, automatically remains there. And that was the
  type used in the slip coach.</p>

  <p>"You may also remember how I harped on the raw egg. I could not place it,
  Bob; every instinct in me rebelled against the thought that Goldberg carried
  one raw egg with him. Then you made the remark about the murderer carrying
  it. Once again it was incredible if the murderer was in the carriage. He
  wouldn't come in, plaster an egg on the door, and then shoot Goldberg. But,
  supposing the murderer hadn't been in the carriage&mdash;what then? For a
  considerable time another train had been running parallel with the express,
  and at about the same speed. Supposing a man in that other train had seen
  Goldberg sitting in his compartment, and to attract his attention had thrown
  an egg through the open window, what would be Goldberg's reaction? He would
  get up to shut the window, to prevent more eggs following. Supposing that
  then the egg-thrower shot him through the brain. Now you and I have seen men
  killed instantaneously in France, and if you cast your mind back you will
  remember that quite a number threw up their arms and fell backwards. What
  would have happened if Goldberg's fingers had been in the notch of the
  window? Just what did happen in this case: he shut the window with his last
  convulsive jerk, thereby making it appear impossible for him to have been
  shot from anywhere except inside the carriage, which was, of course, an
  incredible piece of luck for the murderer.</p>

  <p>"So on that hypothesis I started. You heard me say to Grantham that I
  might never find the man who did it, and but for luck which now turned
  against him I never should have. My starting point, naturally, was the other
  train and its occupants. Now the last station at which it had stopped, before
  the murder had been committed, was Pedlington, and so there I repaired. I
  made inquiries with the utmost caution, because it was essential that nothing
  should get into the papers if we weren't going to alarm our bird, whoever he
  was. And after talking to the stationmaster I and getting in touch with the
  guard of the tram, facts began to accumulate, though it was a slow
  business.</p>

  <p>"The first thing I found out was that the train was comparatively
  empty&mdash;so empty that the guard was able to remember more or less
  accurately how the passengers were seated. And the important thing was to
  ascertain how many compartments had only one occupant. There were only three
  to his certain knowledge: one with a woman, two each with a man. More than
  that he could not say, except that the woman was very old.</p>

  <p>"Now came the wearisome search. I eliminated the woman, arid concentrated
  on the men. I went to every station after Pedlington at which the train
  stopped, and got in touch with the ticket collector. It was still an absolute
  toss-up if I could spot my man. If it was someone carrying a few eggs in a
  paper bag it was hopeless. And then came an astounding stroke of luck. The
  collector at Marlingham&mdash;four stations beyond Pedlington&mdash;
  remembered a man who got out there with a basket of eggs and who asked the
  way to some farm.</p>

  <p>"Bob, I was getting warm. Off to the farm I went, and found that a man
  called Meredith, who owned a chicken farm called Hatchaways, not far from
  Pedlington itself, had been there. And now I knew I'd got him. You remember
  the letters on the broken shell&mdash;'atch' and 'ways.' He was my bird, but
  he was still a long way from the net.</p>

  <p>"So back to Pedlington, where I posed as a man with a certain amount of
  money who was interested in chicken farming. And I met Master Meredith, who
  thought he had found a sucker. Further inquiries revealed the fact that he
  was in bad financial straits, and was only too ready to sell. Further
  inquiries also revealed the very significant and unusual fact that he always
  carried a Colt revolver in his pocket wherever he went&mdash;a habit, he
  said, he got into while out West. So I staged the little performance this
  morning. Marshall, from the Yard, the fingerprint expert, was outside, and
  when Sayers nodded to me I knew that there was no mistake.</p>

  <p>"Just one of those strange crimes that nearly came off. It wasn't
  premeditated, of course. By a mere freak of fate the two trains ran side by
  side for some time, and Meredith saw the chance of getting rid of the man to
  whom he owed money in such a way that no suspicion could fall on him. And
  when Goldberg shut the window as he died, Meredith must have thought himself
  absolutely safe. Which," he concluded, "he would have been if he'd thrown a
  banana and not an egg."</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8">VIII.&mdash; THE SECOND DOG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"ONE of the most dangerous mistakes you can make in any
  investigation is to start with a preconceived idea."</p>

  <p>Thus one of Ronald Standish's favourite maxims, and seldom has its truth
  been better demonstrated than in the case of the murder of Daniel Benton,
  when, but for the lucky chance of Ronald's presence at Croxton Hall for the
  annual cricket match, an innocent man might well have gone to the
  gallows.</p>

  <p>The thing happened on the night of our arrival. The house-party was a big
  one, comprising as it did most of our eleven, and several of the Free
  Foresters whom we were playing next day. Bill Maybury, our host, was in his
  usual good form, and we were just going in to dinner when the butler, looking
  very perturbed, came in and whispered something in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Daniel Benton murdered!" cried Maybury. "Good God! Who did it?"</p>

  <p>The butler hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"There's a rumour, sir," he said, "that Sergeant Johnston is arresting
  young Joe Drury."</p>

  <p>Bill Maybury looked very grave.</p>

  <p>"Young Drury." he repeated. "When did it happen, Parker?"</p>

  <p>"I've just heard the news, sir. The postman brought it."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" said Maybury. "Ronald, this looks like something in your
  line. I don't know any details, but from what Parker says our fast bowler
  tomorrow is on the verge of being arrested for murder. I don't believe he did
  it for a moment," he went on. "He's a hot-tempered boy, and there's no love
  between him and that blackguard Benton." He pulled himself up. "Still, if the
  man's dead, I suppose one oughtn't to call him a blackguard."</p>

  <p>A silence had fallen on the room at the mention of the word 'murder', and
  Ronald broke it.</p>

  <p>"Let's hear a bit more, Bill. Who was the dead man, and who is this young
  Drury?"</p>

  <p>"Daniel Benton," said Maybury, "came to these parts about three years ago,
  and took a small house about a mile from here. And though the poor devil
  seems to be dead there is no use in pretending that he will be the slightest
  loss. In fact, not to mince words, I have seldom in my life met a bigger
  swine. In his early days he was a seafaring man, and what induced him to
  settle in the depths of the country I don't know. However, he took the house
  for five years. He seemed to have a certain amount of money, and his
  principal method of spending it was down his throat. And when he had drink
  oil board that man was a devil incarnate. He was immensely powerful, with a
  great ragged black beard, and about twice a week he used to go round to the
  'Greyhound' and have a bout. The other men loathed him, but they were all
  afraid of him. He'd sit in the corner of the bar speaking to no one till he
  got well sprung: then the trouble would begin. He delighted in picking a
  quarrel. He was a foul-mouthed brute, and the fellows here, though no more
  squeamish than most, were utterly disgusted by him. He couldn't get out a
  sentence without an oath in it, and his stories were invariably connected
  with his own unsavoury past.</p>

  <p>"But even that," he continued, "wouldn't have mattered so much if he could
  have kept his hands to himself. Twice, he's been before the bench for
  inflicting grievous bodily harm on two of the lads. The first time we fined
  him; the second we gave him three months. But each time it was the same
  thing: he started sneering at someone until the victim lost his temper and
  struck him. Then Benton would wade into him and half kill him."</p>

  <p>"What a delightful member of the community," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"You're right, old boy," said Maybury, "and if young Drury has killed him
  it's no more than he deserves. At the same time, that's not going to help the
  boy much."</p>

  <p>"Was there any special animosity between the two?"</p>

  <p>"That's the devil of it," answered our host. "There was. Drury was one of
  the two he laid out. The boy was walking out with little Nellie Seymour, and
  one day they met Benton. And that night Benton came into the bar, and started
  making foul innuendoes about them, Drury, of course, flared up and went for
  him, but it was simply pitiful, I believe. He's quite a well-built, strong
  lad, but he was like a child in that brute's hands. That was the case we gave
  him three months for, because of the provocation.</p>

  <p>"Benton half murdered him, which was damned galling to his pride. And
  that, coupled with what had previously been said about Nellie and him, drove
  him wild, and he started uttering foolish threats&mdash;'he'd do the swine
  in' and that sort of thing. It came to my ears, and when I met him one day I
  told him to quit it and not be an ass. To keep out of Benton's way as much as
  possible; to avoid the fellow. But, from what I understand, it has been
  proving very difficult. Benton, somewhat naturally, regarded Drury as the
  cause of his imprisonment, and has been seizing every opportunity of sneering
  at him and making his life a hell."</p>

  <p>"When did Benton come out of prison?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Two months ago," said Maybury. "And there's no doubt about it, it's made
  him worse."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how he was killed," remarked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"I'll ring for Parker and see if he knows. Parker," he said as the butler
  entered, "what was Benton killed with? Was he shot?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," answered the man. "All the postman said was that the
  room was like a shambles. But I've just heard, sir," he went on, "that young
  Drury turned up at the 'Greyhound' in a terrible condition about an hour ago.
  Bleeding he was, and all muzzy like, but he wouldn't say anything. He just
  had a couple and then stumbled off home."</p>

  <p>"By Gad! that looks bad," said Maybury gravely. And then he looked
  tentatively at Ronald, "I suppose, old man, you wouldn't like to..."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I will," said Ronald. "Let's go and see if there's anything to
  be found out."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Ronald," said Maybury gratefully. "Sergeant Johnston is an
  excellent man, but I'd like that boy to have the very best possible chance.
  You fellows go and have dinner; we'll have something when we get back."</p>

  <p>"Coming, Bob?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"You bet," I cried, and a few minutes later we started off with Maybury in
  his car.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful starlit night. The air was cool after a heavy shower
  that had fallen about six o'clock, and it seemed hard to realise in the
  peaceful countryside that we were on our way to a scene of murder. But as we
  drove along the main road we overtook people in twos and threes hurrying
  along and evidently bound for the same destination as ourselves.</p>

  <p>"There's Benton's house," said Maybury, suddenly pointing ahead; and in
  the glare of the headlights we could see a crowd already gathered in the
  road. They parted as we drew up by the gate, and a stolid policeman on duty
  saluted as he recognised Maybury.</p>

  <p>"Bad business, sir," he said. "The sergeant's hinside now with the
  hinspector. Stand back there," he cried, as two or three of the more daring
  spirits tried to follow us in.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Sergeant Johnston," said Maybury, addressing a stout,
  florid-faced man who was standing in the hall. "This is a bad show."</p>

  <p>"Very bad indeed, sir," answered the sergeant, touching his hat.
  "Inspector Merrifield is here, but it's just one of those obvious cases."</p>

  <p>A tall, thin man in plain clothes came out of one of the rooms and looked
  at us keenly.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Maybury, sir," said the sergeant. "One of our bench of
  magistrates."</p>

  <p>"A terrible affair, Inspector," said Maybury. "And I've taken the liberty
  of bringing Mr. Standish, who is staying with me. He's very well known at
  Scotland Yard: and since I hear there is some talk of young Drury being
  implicated in this business, I hope you'll let him have a look round."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, Mr. Standish," said the Inspector none too graciously.
  "And if you think you're going to get anything out of this business you're
  sadly mistaken! The whole thing is obvious.'</p>

  <p>"For all that, I'd like just to have a look, Inspector," said Ronald
  genially. "Though I'm sure you've spotted everything there is to see."</p>

  <p>The Inspector flung open the door of the room behind him, and we all went
  in.</p>

  <p>"Everything is as it was," remarked the Inspector, "except that I've drawn
  the curtains because of the crowd outside."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded shortly, and we all stood silently looking round. Lying on
  the floor against the wall opposite to us was a huge, black-bearded man. His
  open eyes seemed to glare at us horribly: his mouth had set itself into a
  snarl. One great hairy hand lay outstretched on the carpet: the other was
  clenched round the metal shaft of a spear, which stuck out from his chest.
  Just above him a similar weapon had been half wrenched from the wall and now
  dangled precariously from one support. The blood, which had ceased to flow,
  had collected in a pool by his side, and the whole effect was incredibly
  gruesome.</p>

  <p>"The spear was driven clean through him," said the Inspector. "The point
  is sticking out of his back."</p>

  <p>"You presumably know what sort of a spear that is," remarked Ronald.</p>

  <p>The other raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Whatever sort it is," he answered, "it was sufficient to kill him, and
  that's all that matters to me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Ronald quietly. "Still, it is instructive. I
  think you said, Bill, that the dead man had been a sailor, so that accounts
  for him having harpoons about the room."</p>

  <p>"That's what they get whales with, isn't it?" cried the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Ronald. "And I see that the one with which he was killed was
  hanging by the side of its companion, which is still on the wall."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," remarked the Inspector with a faint smile. "The companion
  which Benton was trying to get down when he was murdered."</p>

  <p>"Ever tried to throw a harpoon, Inspector?" asked Ronald mildly.</p>

  <p>"I can't say I have. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I only wondered," said Ronald still more mildly. "You have a shot at it
  one day and you'll be surprised at the result. However, what's all this about
  young Drury?"</p>

  <p>"Have you seen all you want to see in here?" said the Inspector with a
  touch of sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"For the moment, yes," answered Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Then we might go to another room, and I'll tell you what happened."</p>

  <p>He led the way across the hall, and we followed.</p>

  <p>"See that no one goes into that room," he ordered the constable at the
  door and the man saluted.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "it's one of those cases which solves itself
  automatically. I'm sorry for young Drury, who, Sergeant Johnston tells me, is
  a good lad, and who seems to have had the utmost provocation. However, the
  law is the law, and justice must take its course. It seems, then, that Drury
  has a dog to which he is very attached. It's a mongrel of sorts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know the animal," cried Maybury. "It's an intelligent little
  beast."</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," continued the Inspector, "the dog appears to have been
  out on its own. (I may say, gentlemen, that what I am about to tell you is at
  present only hearsay from the constable, but I shall, of course, have it all
  substantiated.) While the dog was out it met Benton, and whether it barked at
  him or whether he was in a rage and recognised it as belonging to Drury, I
  don't know. What is clear, however, is that he picked up a big stone, threw
  it at the dog and broke one of its legs."</p>

  <p>"The damned swine!" said Maybury.</p>

  <p>"Not content with that," went on the Inspector, "he caught the dog, and
  wrote a note, which he fastened to its collar&mdash;a note which Drury showed
  to several men in the 'Greyhound'. 'Next time I'll break its&mdash;
  head.'</p>

  <p>"That was about six o'clock, for Drury had been away for the afternoon and
  only found out what had happened when he returned. He was in a white
  rage."</p>

  <p>"Somewhat naturally," cried Maybury.</p>

  <p>"And," continued the other, without heeding the interruption, "spent half
  an hour uttering wild threats against Benton. Also, though usually, I
  understand, an abstemious lad, he drank several whiskies, which still further
  inflamed him. Then he left the 'Greyhound' with the avowed intention of
  coming here and having it out. He did come here, arriving at about seven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"You know that for certain?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded. "This man Benton has an old woman called Betsy who
  cooks for him and does the work of the house. We'll send for her in a moment,
  if you like, and she will tell you herself. At any rate, he let him in, and
  he joined Benton in the room opposite, from which shortly after she heard the
  sound of furious quarrelling, followed by blows. She hung about in the hall,
  too frightened to go in, and after a while the noise ceased. So she returned
  to the kitchen to get supper ready.</p>

  <p>"She was there for about a quarter of an hour, and then started to carry
  the meal into the dining-room. And as she was crossing the hall she heard a
  loud voice, which she swears was not Benton's. And the words that she heard
  are, I fear, about as damning to Drury as they could well be.</p>

  <p>"'Three bells in the second dog, you swine.'</p>

  <p>"Of course, she may not have got the sentence absolutely right. It might
  have been three bricks, or something of that sort, but on one point she
  remains absolutely unshaken: the phrase 'the second dog' was used.</p>

  <p>"She waited&mdash;listening&mdash;and a moment or two later heard a sound
  as if something had been thrown against the wall. Then all was silent, and
  she continued with the supper, which was ready at a quarter to eight, when
  she went in to tell Benton, and found what you have seen. She rushed out
  screaming, and fortunately ran straight into Sergeant Johnston, who
  communicated at once with me. And that, gentlemen, is the whole damning story
  in a nutshell. Young Drury arrived just before eight at the 'Greyhound' in a
  state of terrible agitation, and very badly knocked about."</p>

  <p>"By Gad! it looks bad," cried Maybury. "What do you think, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"That I'd like to speak to Betsy," he said.</p>

  <p>"She can't tell you any more than I've already done," snapped the
  Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," remarked Ronald quietly. "But I'd still like to see
  her."</p>

  <p>The Inspector made a sign to the sergeant, who left the room. "So your
  theory, I take it, Inspector," said Ronald, "is some what as follows. Young
  Drury came here at seven o'clock, and proceeded to have a furious row with
  the dead man. Moreover, they came to blows, when presumably Drury was knocked
  about. Then&mdash;well, what happened then?"</p>

  <p>"Drury left in a flaming rage," said the Inspector, "a rage which grew
  more intense with every step he took until it mastered him, and he determined
  to kill Benton. He returned, and managed&mdash;how I can't say&mdash; to get
  one of the harpoons down from the wall. Benton, realising his intention,
  tried to get the other, but was struck down before he could succeed."</p>

  <p>"And then young Drury helped himself to rum," murmured Ronald.</p>

  <p>"So you saw that glass, did you?" grunted the other.</p>

  <p>"Well, Inspector," cried Ronald with a smile, "I am not completely blind.
  And since it is improbable they were drinking together, the rum must have
  been consumed after Benton was killed, as a nerve bracer."</p>

  <p>"What on earth does that signify?" said the other. "It doesn't alter
  facts."</p>

  <p>"It depends on what are facts," said Ronald. "Ah! Betsy," he swung round
  as the door opened and an old woman came in, followed by the sergeant, "there
  are one or two questions I want to ask you: How long have you been in this
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Three years, sir," she mumbled. "Ever since he came." She jerked a thumb
  at the room opposite.</p>

  <p>"And during those three years did he ever have anyone to stay?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; no one."</p>

  <p>"Many visitors by day?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir: he didn't like strangers. He had special bolts fitted to all the
  windows just after he came here," said the old crone. "He used to lock up
  most particular each night: always did it himself."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Betsy. Oh! one more question. This voice that you heard
  shouting about the second dog&mdash;could you recognise whose it was?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I couldn't. But it must have been young Joe Drury."</p>

  <p>"Which shows how singularly dangerous a witness of that sort can be," said
  Ronald as she left the room. "It must have been young Joe Drury. Why?"</p>

  <p>We all stared at him, the Inspector with a barely concealed sneer.</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting that it wasn't young Drury?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Ronald calmly. "You may take it from me that Drury had
  no more to do with Benton's death than I had."</p>

  <p>"But, damn it!" exploded the other, "that remark Betsy overheard
  practically proves it was him."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said Ronald, "it practically proves it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Then who the devil was it?"</p>

  <p>"That is more than I can tell you at this stage of the proceedings,"
  answered Ronald cheerfully. "But I don't think there will be much trouble
  about laying our hands on him when we want him. And I very much doubt,
  Inspector, if you will find that it turns out to be a hanging matter. Now, if
  you don't mind, I would like one more look at the room where he was
  killed."</p>

  <p>We followed him across the passage, the Inspector looking at the sergeant
  and winking significantly. But Ronald, even if he noticed, paid not the
  smallest attention. Quietly and systematically he was examining the wall near
  the door, and at last the Inspector could stand it no longer.</p>

  <p>"Looking for fingerprints?" he inquired</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort," said Ronald. "Ah! here it is, as I thought."</p>

  <p>We crowded round him to look. The paper had been torn away at the spot
  where he was pointing, and the plaster behind was showing. The hole was about
  an inch deep, and looked as if it had been made by the sharp corner of a
  cupboard or desk.</p>

  <p>"I commend that hole to you, Inspector," he remarked. "Also the fact that
  some of the plaster has trickled out on to the floor, a state of affairs
  which I am sure Betsy would have rectified had she noticed it. Now, surely
  with that to go on, and the rum, and the fact that Benton was killed round
  about half-past seven, you ought to be able to lay your hands on your man.
  It's a pity that you've allowed the villagers to obliterate every foot-print
  for miles around, otherwise we might have got some more evidence, but you've
  got enough to go on. And while I think of it&mdash;be careful with the
  gentleman when you get him&mdash;because I think you will find that he is
  quite as powerful as the man he killed."</p>

  <p>The Inspector, who had flushed angrily at Ronald's remarks, controlled
  himself with an effort.</p>

  <p>"What a lovely story it would make, wouldn't it?" he remarked. "Has he
  brown or blue eyes?"</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"That I'm afraid I can't tell you. But he's tanned and weatherbeaten,
  about the same height as myself, walks with a slight roll, and possibly has a
  beard."</p>

  <p>But the Inspector had had enough, and with an angry snort he left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"If you've got the time to play round with this fooling, Mr. Standish, I
  haven't. I wish you good night."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Interview young Drury," snapped the other. "And I wish you luck of your
  bearded, weather-beaten roller."</p>

  <p>"A pig-headed individual," said Ronald as he departed. "A little lesson
  will do him no harm."</p>

  <p>"But are you honestly serious, old boy?" cried Maybury as we walked to the
  car.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bill," answered Ronald quietly, "I can assure you of one thing.
  However big a swine a man was I wouldn't jest in the room where he lay
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Then how the devil you've done it beats me," said our host. "I saw all
  you saw."</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled. "Mustn't ask me to explain the doings just yet, Bill," he
  said. "Besides, we haven't caught our bird. Do you mind if we drive to the
  'Greyhound'? We may as well begin our inquiries there."</p>

  <p>"Can you get it, Bob?" said Maybury as we started.</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly," I confessed. "But then I never have."</p>

  <p>The car pulled up at the "Greyhound" and Ronald got out.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be long," he said and disappeared inside. A minute later he was
  out again with a pleased look on his face. "Luck right in," he remarked.
  "Drive slowly towards Tetterbury," he told the chauffeur, "and stop the
  moment I tell you to."</p>

  <p>"We've landed him quicker than I expected," he said, getting in with us at
  the back. "And if you don't mind we'll take him up to your place and hear his
  story. But don't alarm him till we get him there."</p>

  <p>The car, headlights blazing, drove slowly on. And I suppose we'd gone
  about a mile when suddenly I felt my pulses quicken. In front of us, in the
  middle of the road was a thick-set man walking with a pronounced roll.</p>

  <p>"Our bird," said Ronald quietly. "Stop when you come abreast of him."</p>

  <p>He had a bundle slung over his shoulder, and as the car approached he
  swung round. And I heard Maybury whistle under his breath; the man had a
  beard.</p>

  <p>"Want a lift, mate?" sang out Ronald. "Hop in beside the driver."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, gentlemen," he said. "I'm bound for Tetterbury."</p>

  <p>"We'll send you on there later," said Ronald. "I expect you could do with
  a bit of grub first. To the Hall," he told the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's never been Tom Dixon's way to refuse a good offer. Thank you,
  gents, I don't mind if I do."</p>

  <p>"I told the landlord at the 'Greyhound' to tell that ass Merrifield to
  come up there too," said Ronald in a low voice. "Hope you don't mind,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>"My dear man," answered Maybury, "I'm too puzzled to mind anything. The
  whole thing has me beat."</p>

  <p>Which applied equally to me.</p>

  <p>The house-party was assembled in the hall when we arrived, and Ronald
  jumped out quickly to warn them to say nothing. And so it was a silent group
  which stared curiously at the man who stood blinking a little in the light.
  He was clearly puzzled, and when Ronald shut the front door behind him he
  made a quick movement as if he expected a trap.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Dixon," said Ronald quietly. "What you did this evening has got
  to be explained, you know."</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at, mister?" he growled. "I've done nothing this
  evening."</p>

  <p>And at that moment Inspector Merrifield, looking completely mystified,
  came into the hall.</p>

  <p>"What's this the landlord tells me?" he began, and then he saw Dixon
  standing sullenly in the centre of the group.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he muttered, staring at him foolishly. "Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"The man I was telling you about, Inspector," said Ronald, with a faint
  twinkle in his eyes. "And he is just going to tell us why he killed
  Benton."</p>

  <p>With an oath the man lurched forward.</p>

  <p>"It's a...lie," he shouted. "I don't know who you mean."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Dixon," said Ronald sternly. "Your only chance is to
  make a clean breast of it. And to show you how useless it is to lie I'll tell
  you exactly what took place. This evening you arrived at Benton's house.
  Through the open window you saw him sitting in his room drinking. Then you
  either climbed in through the window or, opening the front door, you walked
  through the hall to his room, where you confronted him with the remark,
  'Three bells in the second dog, you swine!'</p>

  <p>"He recognised you at once, and in some way managed to get at one of the
  harpoons on the wall behind him, which he flung at you. It missed and,
  hitting the wall, fell at your feet. You picked it up, and as he tried to get
  the second you hurled it. And. Dixon, you did not miss. Then you took a
  glass, poured yourself out some rum, drank it, and left the house."</p>

  <p>The man who had been listening with ever increasing amazement and fear
  collapsed limply in a chair.</p>

  <p>"Strike me pink, mister!" he muttered, "were you watching from the road?
  You're plumb right, but it was him or me."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Ronald quietly, "and that's why we want to hear what
  led up to this affair."</p>

  <p>The Inspector stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"I must caution you," he said, "that anything you say will be used in
  evidence against you."</p>

  <p>Dixon looked at him contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Copper, are you? That's all right, mister. If there's any justice in this
  country they'll do nothing to me for killing a black-hearted devil who should
  have been dead this last thirty years. From what I've heard down in the pub
  yonder he made himself pretty well hated round these parts, but you can take
  it from me, gentlemen, I that he was a Sunday school marm compared to what he
  was like in the old days.</p>

  <p>"Bully Benton he was known as, and well did he deserve the nickname. Even
  when he was sober he had the temper of a fiend, but when he was drunk the man
  was uncontrollable. He was as strong as two ordinary men, and the life he
  lived kept him fit in spite of his drinking bouts. He owned a whaler, and
  that's not work for the weakling.</p>

  <p>"I first met Bully Benton in '97 in a low-down joint in Sydney. He'd just
  come back from a cruise and he had money to burn. And from the very first we
  hated one another. I reckon I'm no plaster saint myself, but there are
  limits, gentlemen. And he was over it. Some of the stories I could tell you
  about him you wouldn't believe. Once when he was drunk he soaked a cat in oil
  and set light to it, and there are a score of other things he did which made
  one wonder if the man was sane.</p>

  <p>"We steered clear of one another as much as we could. Though I says it
  myself, I was one of the few men that Bully had a wholesome respect for. We
  never actually came to a scrap, but I was no chicken in those days and the
  result might have surprised him. He knew it too, and that was enough for him,
  though it made him hate me all the more. I suppose, mister, there's not a
  thing as a wet about? I reckon I'm not much of a hand at talking."</p>

  <p>Bill Maybury pressed the bell, and while we waited for the drink to come
  the strange contrast of it all struck me. The ring of men in evening clothes,
  each of them absolutely fit according to our standards, and yet what chance
  would any of us have had against Bully Benton? But there, quietly lowering
  his pint of beer, was the man who, when it came to stark reality, had beaten
  him in the final test&mdash;a man who, but for Ronald, would now be sitting
  in a third-class carriage to all outward appearances a common sailor.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be much longer now, gentlemen," he continued, putting down his
  tankard, "and then you must do with me as you sees fit. You belong to one
  class, I belong to another, but there's one thing where all of us meet on the
  same level&mdash;when we come to love a honest girl. Perhaps you won't
  believe it, that there was a time when Tom Dixon was a bit of a favourite
  with the women, but from the moment I first set eyes on little Alice Preston
  there was never room for another girl in my life. And now I knows it was the
  same with her, though for a time I didn't. God! I thank you for that!"</p>

  <p>His great fists were clenched: the sweat glistened on his forehead: for
  the moment we were nonexistent.</p>

  <p>"No," he repeated, "for a time I didn't. We were pledged, Alice and me,
  though her parents were not too pleased about it. They wanted something
  better for their sweet girl than a rough sailor man. I didn't blame them: she
  was worthy of the highest in the land. But she was true to me, and we were
  going to be wedded when I got back from my next cruise."</p>

  <p>And once again did he forget we were there.</p>

  <p>"I got back to Sydney," he went on a while, "and we round to her house at
  once. And there her father met me.</p>

  <p>"'Tom, lad,' he said, 'I've got some terrible bad news for you.'</p>

  <p>"My heart almost stopped beating.</p>

  <p>"'Not Alice!' I cried. 'Don't say anything's happened to her!'</p>

  <p>"'She's run away,' he said in a rasping voice. 'Run away with Bully
  Benton.'</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I reckons I went crazy. I shook him like a dog shakes a rat;
  told him he was a liar and it was a trick to fool me But at last I understood
  that it was the truth: my Alice had run away to sea with Bully Benton. We
  didn't even know if they was married, but what did that matter? I'd lost her:
  Bully Benton had got her. She'd gone down to his boat happy and
  carefree&mdash;I found that out from one of the watchmen: gone willingly.</p>

  <p>"It broke me up, mister; broke me up utterly. And I went t the devil in my
  own way. I'm not excusing myself; I was young and headstrong. But the finish
  of it was that I got three years. I didn't care; I came out more black-
  hearted than I went in. And the first thing I did was to look round for
  Bully, only to find that he'd quit the game and left Australia.</p>

  <p>"'And the girl,' I said to the man I was talking to. 'Has she gone with
  him?'</p>

  <p>"'Alice Preston?' he cried, looking at me strangely. 'Of course, you
  wouldn't have heard, Tom. The poor child fell overboard and was drowned?</p>

  <p>"So she was dead, and serve her right, was my thoughts. She deserved it
  for playing me false, and I felt no pity for her. Until one day a week later
  when I happened to meet the cook who had been with Bully that trip. I was
  drinking hard, and feeling that I eared neither for God nor man, when he
  altered my life for me.</p>

  <p>"'If only you'd been here, Tom,' he said, 'it would never have
  happened.'</p>

  <p>"'What d'you mean?' I cried. 'I couldn't have stopped her going: wouldn't
  have if she'd wanted to.'</p>

  <p>"'Wanted to, you damned fool!' he shouted. 'Wanted to! You must be mad to
  think such a thing.'</p>

  <p>"And then, gentlemen, I heard the truth. Heard how Bully had lured her on
  board his boat with a cock-and-bull story about me having put back because I
  was ill, and that he would take her to me. How or why she believed it, God
  Almighty only knows. Maybe it was that, with her mind, she was incapable of
  suspecting the devilry of that foul blackguard. Just a few hours' sail, he
  told her; she'd be back before nightfall. So she went with him&mdash;all
  blind trust and confidence."</p>

  <p>He was speaking slowly now, was Tom Dixon, and you could have heard a pin
  drop in the crowded hall. For every one of us there realised that he was
  hearing the simply told story of one of life's stark dramas.</p>

  <p>"Can you realise her feelings, gentlemen, when it first dawned on her that
  she'd been deceived? Can you realise her feelings when she went on her knees
  to that man and he just laughed in her face? Can you realise her feelings
  when he first flung his foul arms round her and soiled her with his lecherous
  kisses? One friend she had&mdash;the cook&mdash;and Bully split his head open
  with a belaying-pin; he showed me the scar.</p>

  <p>"'So it was better that she fell overboard,' I said when he'd
  finished.</p>

  <p>"And then, gentlemen, he looked at me queerly.</p>

  <p>"'She didn't fall, Tom,' he said. 'She jumped.'"</p>

  <p>For a while Tom Dixon was silent, staring in front of him, and seeing the
  ghosts of that tragedy of long ago. Then with a little shake he pulled
  himself together.</p>

  <p>"I guess that's about all, gentlemen. There and then I vowed hat some day,
  at the same hour that my girl went to her death, Bully Benton and I would
  settle accounts. For years I have been seeking him, and quite by chance a
  fortnight ago in Marseille I picked up an English newspaper of several months
  ago. And in it I saw a little paragraph saying that a Daniel Benton had been
  given three months for assault. I had found him at last: there could not be
  two of them.</p>

  <p>"The rest this gentleman knows, though how he found it out can't
  understand, seeing that he wasn't there. I don't know how I stand with the
  law of England; I don't know what they can do to me: I don't care. I killed
  Bully Benton and I guess if they want to hang me for it they can."</p>

  <p>"You take it from me, Dixon," said Ronald quietly, "that the law won't
  hang you for it. You'll have to go with the Inspector and stand your trial,
  of course, but in view of the fact that you went to him unarmed and he flung
  the harpoon at you first, it will only be a formality. And may I say one
  thing more? I don't think there is a single man here who would not be proud
  to have acted as you did."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"IT makes one feel a bit small, doesn't it?" he said ten
  minutes later.</p>

  <p>Dixon had gone with the Inspector; Bill Maybury, Ronald and I were sitting
  down to a belated dinner.</p>

  <p>"Little games of cricket and golf; nice food on nice plates; all the even
  tenor of our lives&mdash;and what we've just listened to."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," grunted Maybury. "But we're still infernally curious,
  Ronald."</p>

  <p>"Little fiddling clues," Ronald laughed shortly. "It was easy, Bill. From
  the word 'go' I was certain it wasn't young Drury. To throw a harpoon
  requires not only enormous strength, but very great skill&mdash;skill it was
  wellnigh impossible that a country lad could possess. Only a man trained to
  the sea could have done it.</p>

  <p>"Then the rum; essentially a sailor's drink, and already I was fairly
  certain in my mind that a sea man was at the bottom of it, a conviction which
  was strengthened by what Betsy told us with regard to Benton's fear of
  strangers. Surely that must date back to his old life. But when we came to
  the remark she overheard I had proof positive.</p>

  <p>"'Three bells in the second dog, you swine!'</p>

  <p>"And there you see the danger of a preconceived idea. The Inspector, his
  mind full of the story of young Drury's dog, seized on the word dog&mdash;in
  a way, a very natural mistake. I, on the other hand, had already arrived in a
  nautical atmosphere and to me the remark had a totally different
  significance. The dog watch on board ship is from four to eight in the
  evening; the first dog from four to six; the second dog is
  seven-thirty&mdash;the time when Dixon entered the room; the time we now know
  when Alice Preston jumped to her death.</p>

  <p>"By now I knew that the man who had killed Benton was a sailor: no
  landsman would have used such a phrase. Moreover, he'd killed him with one of
  Benton's own weapons. How had he got it down from the wall, with its owner
  sitting in the way? Obviously he couldn't have, so it must have been flung at
  him first. The rest was easy. I found the mark on the wall, and realising
  that Benton would have aimed at his chest, deduced that he was about the same
  height as myself. Incidentally, the fact that plaster was still on the floor
  was strong evidence that the mark had been made recently. And finally,
  deep-sea sailors are invariably weatherbeaten, walk with a slight roll, and
  frequently have beards. And when the landlord at the 'Greyhound' told me that
  just such a man had left a few minutes earlier walking to Tetterbury I knew
  we had him."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"But this night a man has talked with us."</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">IX. &mdash; THE MAN IN YELLOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD known little Marjorie Beaumont since she was a child
  of six, but of late years since both her parents had died in one of the
  epidemics I had rather lost sight of her. She was living, I knew, somewhere
  down in Kent with an elderly uncle. Where, exactly, I was not sure till I
  received the letter I now held in my hand.</p>

  <p>Groomley Park, Nr. Ashford.</p>

  <p>Dear Bob (it ran),</p>

  <p>Come and feed with me at the Six Hundred tomorrow (that's today when you
  get this) and meet Bungo. Also there is something I want to ask you about.
  Expect you one o'clock.</p>

  <p>Yours,</p>

  <p>Marjorie.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;You have got a pal who does things, haven't you? You know,
  arrests people, and all that.</p>

  <p>I smiled slightly. As a description of Ronald Standish, the postscript was
  not without humour. But what on earth could she be wanting to see him about?
  And who was Bungo? Points which doubtless would be settled at the Six
  Hundred, where I duly arrived at a little after one.</p>

  <p>I saw her at once in a far corner sitting with a good-looking youngster.
  They were deep in conversation&mdash;so deep, in fact, that I had reached the
  table before she saw me.</p>

  <p>"Bob, you old dear," she cried, jumping up, "it's great of yo to come.
  This is Bungo."</p>

  <p>I shook hands.</p>

  <p>"His real name," she continued, "is Jack Ayrton, but it's used so little
  that he's almost forgotten it himself. And he and I are engaged."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," I said. "All the usual and that sort of rot. But where," I
  remarked, glancing at her left hand, "is the outward and visible sign of this
  happy state of affairs?"</p>

  <p>"That," remarked Bungo gloomily, "is where you butt your head into the
  snag. We are engaged, but Uncle Henry thinks otherwise."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you know him, Bob," put in the girl. "But I've lived with
  him at Groomley Park ever since the poor old parents died. He's been my
  guardian now for ten years."</p>

  <p>"And he doesn't approve of the nuptials?" I said. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows," answered Bungo. "I knew Marjorie has a spot of cash
  belonging to her, but so have I."</p>

  <p>"Ayrton's Fabrics for All," explained the girl. "That's his father."</p>

  <p>"I see where the cash comes," I remarked. "Thanks: I can do another of
  those. Does Uncle Henry give no reason?"</p>

  <p>"Uncle Henry says I'm too young," said the girl, lighting a cigarette. "Of
  course, I know that it will be lonely for the poor old fish when I join up
  with Bungo, and I don't want to hurt his feelings, Bob. He's been awfully
  good to me all these years. A the same time, he's got to get used to the
  idea; and he no understands that when I come of age next November, Bungo and
  I are going to pull it off. But until then I've promised him I won't."</p>

  <p>"But what has this got to do with my pal who arrests people, and all
  that?"</p>

  <p>The girl laughed and then grew serious again.</p>

  <p>"Seems a bit obscure, I must admit," she answered. "What we've been
  telling you up to date has nothing to do with him, but Uncle has&mdash; over
  something completely different. Shall I tell him, Bungo, or will you?"</p>

  <p>"You're in the chair, old soul," he remarked. "Cough it up."</p>

  <p>"It started about three weeks ago," she began. "We were having breakfast,
  just he and I, when the post arrived. Bungo wasn't down, and so he didn't see
  the beginning of it. But I suddenly heard a noise like a pig grunting, and
  there was Uncle Henry, half out of his chair, staring at one of his letters
  as if it was a bomb. He was plucking at his collar with one hand, and clawing
  at the air with the other."</p>

  <p>"That's when I came tottering in," said Bungo, "and I thought the old chap
  was having a fit. At any rate, Marjorie and I clustered round, and when the
  commotion had died down a bit we asked him what had stung him.</p>

  <p>"'They've found me,' he muttered. 'After all these years they've found
  me.'</p>

  <p>"Which didn't convey much to us." The girl took up the story again. "So we
  laid him out to cool, and after a while tried to find out what the trouble
  was. But he wouldn't say anything more, and a few minutes later he left the
  room and went to his study, where he locked himself in, a thing I've never
  known him do before."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the letter that had caused the trouble?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We got the envelope," said Bungo. "Here it is. But we didn't see the
  contents until much later."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the envelope, but it did not seem to point to much. It. was
  addressed to Mr. Henry Beaumont, Groomley Park, Nr. Ashford, in what was a
  childish rather than an illiterate hand. The postmark was Folkestone.</p>

  <p>"Not much there," I said, handing it back. "What happened next?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing till dinner that night," answered the girl. "He remained in his
  study all day, and had his lunch there."</p>

  <p>"Which must have been considerably more liquid than solid," jut in Bungo.
  "When Uncle arrived for dinner he was quite-nicely-thank-you."</p>

  <p>"So would you have been, my lad," she cried, "under the circumstances.
  Anyway, Bob, we tackled him about it again, as this is what we gathered. All
  his early life was spent in the East and it seems that when he was a
  youngster he was pretty hot stuff. At any rate, one night in the dim, dark
  ages&mdash;Swettypore in ninety-four sort of business&mdash;he and some pals
  were making whoopee."</p>

  <p>"And they got gloriously sprung," said Bungo.</p>

  <p>"And having got gloriously sprung," continued Marjorie, "the proceeded to
  raise Cain round some especially sacred Buddhist temple. In fact, according
  to him, they laid out some priests, and concluded the entertainment by
  dancing the Lancers with some of the girls attached to the place."</p>

  <p>"Who were a particularly sacred brand of virgin," explain Bungo.</p>

  <p>"What a dam' fool thing to do," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"So they all realised the next morning," he said. "And so Uncle Henry
  admitted when he told us. The fact remained, however, that it had been done,
  and there was no undoing it. But they were only passing through the place on
  their way home on leave, so at crack of dawn next morning they beat it while
  the going was good. But not before one thing had happened. Pinned to the
  table in the rest house they found a note: 'Vengeance will overtake you
  sooner or later.'"</p>

  <p>"It seems to have been some time on the road," I murmured</p>

  <p>"Just what I said to Uncle," cried Marjorie. "But he didn't agree. He said
  that Time was a totally different thing in the East from what we Westerners
  understood, especially where the religious orders were concerned. Thirty or
  forty years mean nothing to them with their conception of life after
  death."</p>

  <p>"And this was three weeks ago," I said. "Has anything happened since?"</p>

  <p>"For ten days nothing happened at all," she answered. "Bungo had to leave,
  so that Uncle and I were alone except for the servants, who are all women. He
  locked up with the utmost care every night, and always slept with a loaded
  revolver under his pillow, but when I suggested going to the police about it
  he refused point-blank. He seemed to be afraid that if he did he would have
  to tell them about this episode of the temple, which is not a thing he wants
  made public.</p>

  <p>"Ten days ago, Bob, a second letter arrived, this time from Ashford. It
  came at breakfast, like the first, and again Uncle Henry shut himself up in
  his study the whole day. I begged him show me the two notes, but he wouldn't.
  He seemed apathetic, almost resigned, and grew quite irritable when I once
  more suggested the police.</p>

  <p>"'What good would the police be in a case like this?' he snorted. What use
  would they be when pitted against the mysteries of the East? If these men
  mean to get me they will get me even if the whole of Scotland Yard is round
  the house.'</p>

  <p>"So I had to let the matter drop. Uncle is as obstinate as a mule when he
  wants to be; and to make matters worse a few days later he got a bad attack
  of gout which, by the way, he is still suffering from. And then the day
  before yesterday occurred an incident which threw him into a veritable
  panic.</p>

  <p>"I had been sitting with him for about ten minutes in his room before
  dinner, when my maid came in to ask me some question. And when she saw me she
  looked very surprised.</p>

  <p>"'I thought you'd already changed, miss,' she said.' 'I saw you in your
  yellow dress half an hour ago, and going into the master's bedroom."</p>

  <p>"The effect on my uncle was electric.</p>

  <p>"'Yellow dress!' he shouted. 'My God! Search the house, Marjorie Search
  the house! Take my revolver with you?</p>

  <p>"He tried to get up, but his gout was very bad that night. And so, amazed
  beyond measure at this extraordinary outburst, Janet&mdash;that's my
  maid&mdash;and I went into his room. It was empty. There wasn't a sign of
  anyone, or of anything having been moved. And then I sent for the chauffeur,
  who lives in a cottage close by, and with him we went over the house. We
  looked into cupboards; we looked under beds&mdash;not a sign of a soul. And
  having told Uncle Henry I asked him what on earth it was all about, and why
  such a harmless remark as Janet's should have caused such a commotion.</p>

  <p>"'Naturally you wouldn't understand, Marjorie,' he answered heavily.
  'You've never been out East. But that yellow dress of yours is exactly the
  same colour as the robe which the Buddhist priests all wear.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"'You don't mean to say,' I cried, 'that you think that Janet saw a
  Buddhist priest going into your bedroom?'</p>

  <p>"'Then what did she see?' he said. 'It wasn't you. It couldn't have been
  one of the servants.'</p>

  <p>"'But there's no one there,' I assured him.</p>

  <p>"He smiled pityingly."</p>

  <p>"'And you can't expect me to believe,' I cried, 'that they can vanish into
  thin air.'</p>

  <p>"'I don't expect you to believe anything,' he answered quietly. 'Let us
  assume that Janet made a mistake.'</p>

  <p>"But I could see that he did not think so, and that night after dinner I
  stuck in my toes. I took up the line that it wasn't fair to me; and that if
  he wouldn't tell the police the least he could do was to allow me to ask
  someone else for help. And at last he consented, though he obviously
  considered it useless.</p>

  <p>"'Open the top drawer of my desk,' he said, 'and you'll find there the two
  notes that came by post.'</p>

  <p>"I did so, and here they are, Bob."</p>

  <p>She passed them over the table to me, and I examined them curiously. The
  writing was the same as that on the envelope, but the paper was different. It
  was a sort of parchment, about the size of a small luggage label, and it
  looked as if some sort of scratchy pencil had been used by the writer.</p>

  <p>Do you remember Ranapore</p>

  <p>So ran the first one, which had been posted in Folkestone.</p>

  <p>The punishment will fit the crime</p>

  <p>That was the second; which had come from Ashford. I handed them back to
  Marjorie, and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It's beyond me, old thing," I said. "They look as if a child had written
  them when under the influence of drink. Did you uncle explain anything?"</p>

  <p>"Only that that was the paper always used by the Buddhist priests, and
  that it was the leaf of some palm tree.</p>

  <p>"'They're genuine, Marjorie, my dear,' he said. 'Only too well do I know
  it. No one but a priest would possess that paper; no one but a priest would
  understand how to do that writing, which is a special art. Go if you like and
  get anyone you wish to help but it is useless. They've found me, and there's
  no more to be said.'</p>

  <p>"And so, Bob, I thought of you and that friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Whom I will get on the 'phone," I said. "And if he isn't playing golf or
  cricket we'll go along and see him at once."</p>

  <p>Ronald was in, and ten minutes later we were all sitting in his room. He
  was dealing with a rusty niblick when we arrived, but Marjorie Beaumont
  retold her story he ceased operations on the club and listened intently.</p>

  <p>"What's the verdict, Mr. Standish?" said Bungo, when she had finished.</p>

  <p>Ronald was studying the two messages through a magnifying glass. "These
  are undoubtedly genuine," he remarked. "By that I mean that your uncle is
  perfectly right when he says that they are written by someone who has learned
  an art which is generally regarded as the exclusive property of the Buddhist
  priests. They scratch the words with a very fine pointed stylo, and then
  shake a dark powder over the leaf, which fills up the grooves of the letters.
  Then they wipe the rest of it off, leaving the writing showing up
  clearly."</p>

  <p>"Brit do you really think the old dear is in any danger?" asked Marjorie
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, Miss Beaumont, I am inclined to take the whole thing very
  seriously," he answered, "especially now that I have examined these messages.
  If it was just some silly joke they would have been written on paper. You
  see, except in a museum this palm leaf is unprocurable in England; also the
  implement with which the writing was done."</p>

  <p>"What ought we to do about it?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you like, and you don't think your uncle would object, I'll come
  down and look into things on the spot," he said.</p>

  <p>"Mind! I should think he'd kiss you on both cheeks," said Bungo. "When can
  you go?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," answered Ronald. "There are one or two things I must do
  first, and then I'll motor down with Bob."</p>

  <p>"It's awfully good of you, Mr. Standish," said the girl. "And I know my
  uncle will think so too. Especially as even Bungo won't be there."</p>

  <p>"Less of your 'even'," said Bungo, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep the two messages for the time being, if I may," said Ronald.
  "There are a few points I would like to verify. And we'll be with you in time
  for dinner."</p>

  <p>Marjorie smiled at him gratefully and departed with Bungo.</p>

  <p>"Nice children," remarked Ronald, watching them from the window. "What do
  you make of it, Bob?"</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing that has struck me," I said. "If the writing was
  done by a genuine Buddhist priest there oughtn't to be much difficulty in
  putting one's hand on him."</p>

  <p>"A very sapient remark, old boy," he agreed. "The only snag being that
  though the secret of this writing originated with the priests, there are
  other people who know it."</p>

  <p>"You mean it may not be a priest at all, but someone else knows of this
  episode in the old man's past."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he said.</p>

  <p>"But, then, how do you account for what the maid Janet saw?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," he answered quietly. "For that, my dear Bob, is the most
  curious feature of a very curious case. A very curious case." he repeated,
  and seemed on the point of saying something Then he altered his mind and,
  crossing to a cupboard in corner, he took out a small bottle of dusting
  powder. He shook some carefully on to the second of the messages, and
  examined it through his magnifying glass.</p>

  <p>I stared over his shoulder, and even with the naked eye I could see a
  confused medley of finger-prints, which was just what would have expected.
  Several people, including myself, had handled it, and I failed to see what he
  hoped to discover from such a blurred trail. But after a while a rather
  surprising thing occurred. Out of the jumble of marks, two prints began to
  stand out more clearly than the rest; one came directly under the centre of
  the word "punishment", the other midway between the the words "fit the".</p>

  <p>"We progress," he said tersely, "though I hardly expected such a clear
  result. Do you see those two prints, Bob? What do you make of them?"</p>

  <p>"That two people have held the leaf more firmly than others," I answered
  promptly.</p>

  <p>"Very nearly right," he remarked. "But it's one person, not two. Those
  finger-prints are identical. Let's try the other."</p>

  <p>Again, only less clearly, two stood out from the others&mdash;one under
  "you", the other under the last syllable of "remember".</p>

  <p>"Once more the same gentleman," he said. "And so, old lad, we have in our
  possession four perfectly good finger-prints of the left thumb of the writer
  of these messages."</p>

  <p>"How on earth do you know that?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"I know it because I've seen this writing being done," he said. "The
  trouble is that I'm afraid it isn't going to help us much. It is most
  improbable that the writer is an old criminal, so we can't trace him at
  Scotland Yard. And, since we can't trot round the population of Folkestone
  and Ashford asking 'em for prints of their left thumbs, we're not much
  forrader."</p>

  <p>"But if we can find a Buddhist priest," I cried, "that print gives the
  proof."</p>

  <p>"If," he answered cryptically. "At any rate, let's go and look for him.
  You get the bus, Bob, while I go round to the Yard to make absolutely certain
  he's not an old lag."</p>

  <p>I picked him up an hour later at the club, and as soon as he saw me he
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"As I thought," he said. "They can't help us. So we'll have to see what we
  can do on our own."</p>

  <p>We arrived at Groomley Park at half-past six, and it was evident at once
  that there had been further developments. Marjorie was standing on the
  doorstep with News written large on her face.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Henry has found out where they are," she cried.</p>

  <p>"You mean the message writer?" said Ronald, staring at her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "But come on up and see him and he'll tell you
  himself."</p>

  <p>We followed her up the stairs, and I could see that Ronald was surprised,
  though he said no more.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Standish, Uncle Henry," she said, opening the door into a
  room that was obviously his study. "And Bob Miller, whom you've heard me talk
  about."</p>

  <p>I studied Mr. Beaumont covertly. He was sitting in an easy chair with one
  foot well wrapped up, stretched out in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, gentlemen," he said. "Sorry&mdash;but my damned foot prevents
  me getting up to greet you. Well&mdash;I gather Marjorie has told you the
  story."</p>

  <p>"That is so, Mr. Beaumont," said Ronald. "But I now hear that you've
  solved the mystery."</p>

  <p>"Solved it," he cried. "Of course I have. And if the police weren't such
  infernal fools, and this wasn't such a regulation-infested country, I'd have
  the whole lot arrested tonight. Snake charmers&mdash;pah! they're no more
  snake-charmers than I am."</p>

  <p>"At the moment," said Ronald mildly, "it seems a little hard to
  follow."</p>

  <p>"The circus, sir," barked the old man. "One of those cursed things with
  brass bands and merry-go-rounds and things. My fool of a parlourmaid told me
  about it after lunch, and happened to mention there were Indian jugglers
  there. So I sent her out to make inquiries&mdash;they've pitched their show
  in the village a mile way&mdash;and what do you think I've discovered? The
  circus was in Folkestone when the first note was sent, and in Ashford at the
  time of the second. Isn't that proof, sir?"</p>

  <p>He thumped the table at his side and glared at Ronald.</p>

  <p>"A good piece of presumptive evidence, Mr. Beaumont," said quietly, "but,
  I fear, hardly proof."</p>

  <p>"Bosh!" snorted the other. "Do you know anything about Buddhist
  writing?"</p>

  <p>"A little," said Ronald mildly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you've seen those two messages, haven't you, so what more do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," answered Ronald soothingly. "They were most certainly written
  by someone who is conversant with the art and has used the proper implements.
  But that is not to say that one of this snake-charming troupe is of necessity
  the culprit. It certainly a coincidence, and one that is well worth following
  up, but that is as far as we can go at present."</p>

  <p>The old gentleman snorted again. Then he turned to his niece.</p>

  <p>"Go down and see about some drinks, my dear," he cried, "I would like a
  word with Mr. Standish alone."</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on as the girl left the room, "it's the second message
  that worries me, about the punishment fitting the crime. Marjorie has already
  told you what we young fools did, and I am so desperately afraid that these
  devils may try and do something to her by way of revenge. For myself, I'm an
  old man and it doesn't matter, but if they hurt a hair of her head I'd never
  forgive myself."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, Mr. Beaumont," said Ronald gravely. "Some such idea had also
  occurred to me."</p>

  <p>"She's a high-spirited child, and until she comes of age I fell she is my
  charge. Then, of course, she will have her own money and, I gather, proposes
  to desert me for young Ayrton. But until then I feel myself entirely
  responsible. And, if you will forgive my saying so, what I fear is that you
  are up against something you don't understand. Janet is an unimaginative
  girl. What was it then, that she saw? They have powers of which we Europeans
  have no conception. And against those powers ordinary methods are of no
  avail."</p>

  <p>"Then we must try extraordinary methods," said Ronald. "By the way, Mr.
  Beaumont, does that door lead to your bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"It does," said the old man in some surprise. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"That, then, is the room into which Janet saw or thought she saw the
  individual in the yellow dress disappearing."</p>

  <p>"Yes. There is another door to it leading into the passage, and it was
  through that one the man vanished."</p>

  <p>"You were in here at the time?"</p>

  <p>"I was."</p>

  <p>"And you heard nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Not a sound. One doesn't hear these people when they walk, my young
  friend."</p>

  <p>Ronald rose.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, sir. Well, I think I'll just have a look round, and later
  on, Bob, you and I might go to the circus and have a shot at the coconuts.
  We'll report in due course, Mr. Beaumont."</p>

  <p>We left the old gentleman muttering sarcastically to himself, and going
  along the passage encountered a quiet-looking woman of about forty dressed in
  black. Ronald stopped.</p>

  <p>"Are you Janet&mdash;Miss Beaumont's maid?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"Would you please tell me exactly what happened that evening when you saw
  someone in yellow going into Mr. Beaumont's bedroom."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing much to tell, sir," she said. "I was coming up the
  stairs, and I saw someone wearing a yellow dress standing just outside the
  bedroom door. It was exactly the colour of one of Miss Marjorie's evening
  frocks, and when whoever it was opened the door and went in I assumed it was
  her."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Ronald. "And what did you do then?"</p>

  <p>I did some sewing for half an hour, and then as I was returning to Miss
  Marjorie's room I heard her voice in Mr. Beaumont's study. So I went in to
  find out if there was anything she wanted, and I found that she hadn't
  dressed for dinner, so that it couldn't have been her I saw."</p>

  <p>"So during that half-hour the passage, so far as you know, was empty."</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, sir, it was."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Janet," he said. "That's all at the moment."</p>

  <p>"A puzzling point, Bob," he continued as we went downstairs. "She doesn't
  strike me as the sort of woman who would imagine things. And if someone in a
  yellow robe was really there, why did nothing happen? What was the object in
  getting thus far and then going no further?"</p>

  <p>We found Marjorie in the hail, and she waved her hand at the drink
  tray.</p>

  <p>"Help yourselves," she said. "Well, Mr. Standish, what do you I
  think?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think, Miss Beaumont," he answered frankly. "In
  fact, I'm completely nonplussed. I shall go to the circus and see these
  Indian jugglers, and perhaps we may find something. In any event I would not,
  if I were you, go far from the house alone, at any rate while they are in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>He reverted again to Janet's story on the way there.</p>

  <p>"It baffles me," he said. "It seems so absolutely pointless. Clearly there
  was no difficulty over the fellow getting away, but what earthly use was
  there in going there and then doing nothing? If he'd introduced a snake into
  the bedroom, or something of that sort, we should have had a motive. But as
  it is I'm defeated."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE circus turned out to be a small one, and we had no
  difficulty in finding the jugglers. There were four of them, and when had
  paid our shillings and entered their booth we found them in a group of
  staring yokels watching a cobra swaying slowly and fro to the sound of a pipe
  whilst the player squatted on the ground in front of it.</p>

  <p>"They're Tamils," whispered Ronald to me. "Fortunately I can talk a bit of
  their lingo. But we'll have to wait till their show is over. And then by
  means of a little ruse we may get some information. You didn't know I was
  something of a conjurer, did you Bob?"</p>

  <p>We watched the mango tree grow, and all the other tricks familiar to those
  who go East, until at last the show ended and the audience departed.
  Whereupon Ronald, stepped forward and said something in a dialect which
  brought the four natives excitedly to their feet with broad grins on their
  faces. Next he produced from his pocket a pack of cards and I wondered what
  on earth was coming. Evidently he was going to show them some trick, but what
  good he hoped to obtain by that was obscure. And then suddenly the man's
  amazing ingenuity dawned on me, though I could not understand a word he was
  saying. For each of the natives had grasped one of the four corners of the
  pack with their left forefinger and thumb, so that four thumb-prints would be
  obtained on the top card.</p>

  <p>I forgot even to look at the trick, so lost was I in admiration of his
  cleverness. And when a quarter of an hour later we were sitting in the
  neighbouring pub with the vital card in front of us he admitted that the
  trick had been a complete frost.</p>

  <p>"However," he remarked as he sprinkled the dusting powder on the card's
  surface, "I dare say my reputation for sleight of hand survive the failure."
  The four thumb-prints came out perfectly, and from his pocket he produced the
  second message. And a few moments' comparison established the complete
  innocence of the jugglers. None of the four thumb-prints on the card bore the
  smallest resemblance to those on the palm leaf.</p>

  <p>"That settles that once and for all," he said, draining his tankard of
  beer. "So we've got to start all over again, Bob."</p>

  <p>"I feel I'm being a fool," he said at length. "I feel I ought to be able
  to get something out of Janet's evidence. And I can't. Why should this man,
  having got into Beaumont's bedroom, having done all the difficult part
  safely, leave without profiting by it? Making all allowances for times not
  being accurate, the old man was alone after our unknown entered the bedroom.
  Why, Bob, why? Did he hear or see something that scared him? Or did he do
  something in that room which hasn't acted yet, and which sometime will
  function and kill Beaumont? Or..."</p>

  <p>He fell into a deep reverie which lasted for ten minutes; then he beckoned
  to the landlord.</p>

  <p>"How much longer is that circus remaining here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It be going tomorrow morning, sir. Up to Tenterden."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Come on, Bob. Let's be getting back. And since I have a
  feeling that the very walls have ears, say nothing of our little effort in
  conjuring tonight."</p>

  <p>A warning which proved unnecessary, for we found the whole house in a
  turmoil on our return. Another message had arrived. It seemed that Mr.
  Beaumont's gout being a little better, he had gone down to dinner. And on his
  return to his study he had found it lying on the table.</p>

  <p>"There it is, sir," he roared, holding it out to Ronald. "The damned swine
  put there while I was downstairs. Take it, man, take it," he went on testily,
  "I can't hold my arm out the whole night."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Ronald in some surprise, for he was staring at the little
  leaf of paper like a man bereft of his senses. Then in an instant his face
  was as expressionless as usual, and taking the note he read out the
  contents:</p>

  <p>Be at Handel Corner at one tonight</p>

  <p>"Where is Handel Corner?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About three miles from here," said Marjorie.</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do about it?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Do?" shouted the old man. "What the hell can I do with a foot like this?
  But you and your friend can do something. Go Handel Corner and catch this
  devil. Find out who it is, and haul him here for the police to deal
  with."</p>

  <p>"A very good idea, Mr. Beaumont," said Ronald thoughtfully "That should
  settle things once and for all."</p>

  <p>"Take one of my revolvers and shoot the dog on sight." The old gentleman's
  wrath was rising.</p>

  <p>"You had the house searched after you found this, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course!" said Mr. Beaumont testily. "No trace of anyone. He
  vanished the same as he did last time. Don't take your car right up to the
  corner, Standish. Leave it some way off and walk. Then you'll trap the
  blackguard. Damn it!" he exploded, "what are you hesitating about? Surely two
  young men like you aren't frightened, are you?"</p>

  <p>But Ronald did not even smile; I have never seen him look graver.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Beaumont," he said at length, "not frightened, I assure you. Come
  along, Bob," he turned to me abruptly. "We shall have to be leaving
  shortly."</p>

  <p>"And bring him back dead or alive," grunted the old man as we left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You're darned pensive, Ronald," I said as we went downstairs "What's the
  great idea?"</p>

  <p>"Only that I've just solved the mystery of what Janet saw," he answered.
  "Where is Miss Beaumont?"</p>

  <p>"Here she is," said Marjorie, appearing from the drawing&mdash;room. "Do
  you want to speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Beaumont, I do," he said. "I want you please to obey my
  instructions implicitly, and I think we shall catch the gentleman who has
  been causing the trouble. Now, I have the best reasons for believing that the
  note your uncle received tonight is a trap with the sole purpose of getting
  us out of this house. I didn't tell Mr. Beaumont so, as his condition at the
  moment; owing to his gout, he is so excitable that it could do no good. It is
  far better that he should believe that Bob and I have gone to Handel Corner
  or he might spoil the whole thing. Now I come to what I want you to do, and I
  don't want you even to tell Janet. Go upstairs in a few minutes and undress
  in your own room, as usual. When you've dismissed your maid, turn out your
  light and then, without making a sound, go to some other room and stay there.
  Turn out the light there, too, and lock the door. Have you got me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," she said quietly. "I will do just what you say. But what are
  you and Bob going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Just for the moment we'll leave that," he said gravely. "How long will it
  take you before you're ready?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes," she answered, and he glanced at the clock. "That will do
  nicely," he said, and we watched her going up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"The most damnable quandary I've ever been in, Bob," he remarked as she
  disappeared. "However, it's got to be gone through. Let's get to it."</p>

  <p>First he walked, into the billiard-room, where he opened a window
  noiselessly; then he rejoined me in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Time we started," he said. "Let get the car."</p>

  <p>"But," I began, "I thought you said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You drive," he went on, opening the front door, "and I'll take the
  map."</p>

  <p>Completely bewildered, I followed him to the garage, and we started off
  down the drive. But hardly had we turned into the main road, when he told me
  to stop.</p>

  <p>"Now back to the house on foot," he said, "and keep on the grass."</p>

  <p>Skirting the drive, we reached the open window in the billiard-room, and
  he put his lips to my ear.</p>

  <p>"Take off your shoes," he whispered, "and don't make a sound." On tiptoe I
  followed him up the stairs, where the passage was in darkness, and he led the
  way to Marjorie's room. No light was shining through the keyhole, and very
  cautiously he opened the door. The room was empty. She had carried out her
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"And now," he breathed, "we wait."</p>

  <p>Screening his torch he flashed it round until he found a switch by the
  dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"Sit by that, Bob," he whispered, "and for God's sake turn it on when I
  tell you."</p>

  <p>Then he took off his coat and waistcoat, lay down on the bed and put out
  his torch.</p>

  <p>Half-past twelve chimed faintly from the clock below in the hail. The
  house, save for the occasional crack of a floor board, was silent. A quarter
  to one; one, and I could hear the beating of my own heart. What were we
  waiting for? What was going to happen? And then quite suddenly came a much
  louder crack from just outside the door.</p>

  <p>I heard Ronald move slightly on the bed, and with my pulse hammering and
  one hand on the switch I waited. Whatever it was, it was coming now. Old
  Beaumont had been right. It was Marjorie who was in danger.</p>

  <p>The door was opening slowly, and I could see the faint outline of a
  cloaked figure standing there. Then, in a flash, it had disappeared and the
  springs of the bed shook. Came a sudden grunt and a snarl; then Ronald's
  quiet voice.&mdash;"Light, Bob."</p>

  <p>I switched on, and stared in amazement at the scene. Standing by the bed
  was a man in a yellow robe. He was struggling furiously in Ronald's iron
  grasp, but after a time he grew quiet. His features were squat and almost
  Mongolian, but as I got up and went nearer there seemed to be something very
  odd about the face. Until Ronald put up a hand and pulled off&mdash;a
  mask.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Beaumont," said Ronald in a terrible voice, "Have you anything
  to say to excuse yourself for attempting such inconceivable crime as the
  murder of your niece?"</p>

  <p>I stood rooted to the ground. Beaumont&mdash;her uncle. He stood there
  mouthing, helplessly. Then with a sort of strangled cry he bolted from the
  room. I turned to follow him, but Ronald stopped me.</p>

  <p>"There is only one expiation," he said gravely. "Pray Heaven he takes
  it!"</p>

  <p>He did a moment or two later, and the sound of the shot brought Marjorie
  rushing out of her room.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she cried wildly.</p>

  <p>"I will explain things shortly, Miss Beaumont," said Ronald, laying his
  hand on her arm. "Please go downstairs now. Come with me, Bob."</p>

  <p>We went to the study. There was nothing to be done. Ronald bent down and
  picked up a small bottle that was lying on the floor. And having pulled out
  the cork he sniffed it.</p>

  <p>"The vile old devil," he said softly, slipping it into his pocket.
  "Prussic acid."</p>

  <p>And so we went downstairs to the weeping girl through a crowd of
  frightened servants.</p>

  <p>"Get the police and a doctor," said Ronald to the parlourmaid. "And no one
  is to go into the study till they come."</p>

  <p>"It's very bad news I'm afraid, Miss Beaumont."</p>

  <p>He drew her into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt at all that this business has so preyed on your uncle's
  mind," he went on gravely, "that it sent him off his head. And tonight it
  came to a climax and he shot himself."</p>

  <p>Which was the verdict ultimately returned at the coroner's inquest.</p>

  <p>"Far better so, Bob," said Ronald to me after it was all over. "To tell
  the truth would only damage the girl and not hurt him."</p>

  <p>"What made you get it first?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"When he gave me that third note," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I saw you staring at it," I said. "But you couldn't have spotted the
  thumb-print."</p>

  <p>"No; but I spotted the thumb. In doing that writing the leaf is held
  firmly between the thumb and the first finger, and in the thumb-nail a nick
  is cut. Into that nick is put the implement the writer scratches with to keep
  it steady. And when I saw that he had just such a nick in his thumb I was
  completely dumbfounded. Up to that moment the truth had not even remotely
  dawned on me. And then I saw that it all fitted together, and that, at last,
  what Janet had seen became comprehensible. Naturally, nothing had been done
  by the man in yellow if he was Beaumont himself."</p>

  <p>"But what was his idea in being seen?"</p>

  <p>"To establish an atmosphere," he said promptly, "the atmosphere of the
  mysterious East. He started it with the notes and the story of his youth, and
  added to it as he went along. The circus was a golden opportunity to throw
  suspicion on the wrong person, but he overlooked the little matter of finger-
  prints. And since the circus was moving early the next day it was clear he
  would have to act that night. His gout, of course, was a fiction, though a
  very plausible one. In fact, Henry Beaumont was as pretty a damned villain as
  I've ever come across."</p>

  <p>"But the main question is still unanswered," I reminded him. "Why did he
  want to murder Marjorie?"</p>

  <p>"We shall have that proved for certain shortly," he said. "But in the
  meantime I'll hazard a guess. In a few months Beaumont would have been called
  on to give an account of his stewardship of his niece's money. The ultimatum
  had gone forth; she was going to marry Bungo. Doubtless she still will. But
  I'm open to a bet with you, Bob, that a hundred per cent of their combined
  income will come from Ayrton's Fabrics for All."</p>

  <p>"You mean he embezzled Marjorie's money?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he remarked:</p>

  <p>And once again he proved to be right: every penny had gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">X. &mdash; THE MAN WITH SAMPLES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"CAN you spare a few minutes, Bob? Two heads are better than
  one, and, maybe, you'll be able to see a way out."</p>

  <p>I had not seen Ronald Standish for some weeks, and as I put down the
  morning paper I saw he was looking worried.</p>

  <p>"As many as you like," I said. "But if you can't solve the problem I'm not
  likely to be much good."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to do with solving a problem this time, old boy," he
  answered. "At least, not in the way you mean. By Jove!" he burst out
  savagely, "there ought to be a law passed allowing one to shoot a blackmailer
  on sight."</p>

  <p>"So that's it, is it?" I cried. "Nobody getting at you, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Not guilty, Bob," he said with a grin.</p>

  <p>He grew serious again.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Archie Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Archibald Maitland, Bart? Yes, I know him slightly. Just got engaged
  to one of the Sussex girls."</p>

  <p>"That's the bird," said Ronald. "And have you ever heard me speak of a man
  who calls himself Richard Mordon?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Richard Mordon, amongst other things, is one of those kind hearted
  philanthropists who will lend you any sum from five pounds to ten thousand on
  note of hand alone. He trades under the name of John Grant &amp; Co. His real
  name I have forgotten but his parents were foreigners who settled in England,
  where their precious offspring was born. He, therefore, speaks the language
  like a native. He has an office in the City, and lives in a house not far
  from Sevenoaks. I'll tell you more about that house later.</p>

  <p>"To return to Mordon. I said, if you remember, 'amongst other things'. The
  gentleman, besides being the most rapacious blood sucker in London so far as
  his rates of interest are concerned, has a very paying side-line. It is one
  that he handles with great discretion, since a mistake would involve his
  being kept at His Majesty's expense for several years. He conducts it
  entirely from his private house, with the moneylending business quite
  separate And the side-line is this. He is prepared to buy any incriminating
  document which he considers worth his while.</p>

  <p>"Setting to work with, I am bound to say, considerable skill, he let it be
  known amongst valets and ladies' maids that any compromising letters they
  chose to bring to him would be well paid for. And not being a damned fool he
  does pay well; he gets it back a hundred times over. And the result is that
  many a damning letter has found its way into Mordon's safe.</p>

  <p>"Then comes the next step&mdash;blackmail the writers. And here Mordon
  again shows his devilish cunning. He seems to possess an almost uncanny flair
  for squeezing the maximum out of his victims, without overstepping the mark
  and asking the impossible. Knowing human nature, he realises that by so doing
  he is far more likely to get the money. Of course, there have been cases when
  Mordon has suggested the advantages of borrowing money from John Grant &amp;
  Co., and has thereby got it both ways, but as a general rule he touches them
  for just what they can pay and no more."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a good deal about the swine," I said.</p>

  <p>"I do," answered Ronald. "Four or live times he and I have crossed swords,
  and I regret to state he has won on every occasion. You see, the devil of it
  is, Bob, that with a blackmailer one is helpless. The police are helpless.
  Unless the victim will move, nothing can be done. And that's where this
  blackguard is so astute. He never touches a case which concerns one
  individual only; there is always someone else implicated. Since ninety per
  cent. of his cases concern love affairs the man has to think of the woman's
  reputation. What he specialises in is the case where a real scandal would
  ensue if the facts came out. And that is the state of Denmark so far as
  Archie Maitland is concerned. My hat! Bob," he added despairingly, "why are
  people such drivelling half-wits as to write compromising letters, and then
  to qualify still further for a lunatic asylum by leaving them lying about?
  However&mdash;to continue.</p>

  <p>"Two years ago, Archie had a love affair with a girl who must be nameless,
  even to you. He was quite frank about it, and while it lasted it was
  evidently pretty hectic. Then, as has been known to happen before, the thing
  fizzled out, and a year ago the girl got married to a man some fifteen years
  older than herself. They are ideally happy, and a child is expected
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"Now we come to the point. A week ago Mordon rang up Archie as he was
  dressing for dinner. Archie, of course, didn't know from Adam who he was, and
  when Mordon suggested that he should come down and visit him at Sevenoaks
  Archie told him to go to the devil. Then Mordon mentioned the girl's name,
  which gave Archie such a jolt that he could only stutter foolishly. He had
  almost forgotten the affair himself, so how on earth could complete stranger
  know anything about it? However, he evidently did, and so Archie made an
  appointment to go down and see the following evening.</p>

  <p>"He found Mordon in the room in which he always transact his business, and
  at first he thought he'd come to a madhouse. Immediately on his entering, a
  large man of the professional pug type ran his hands over his pockets. But it
  wasn't that which surprised him; in fact, he hardly noticed it in his
  amazement the rest of the preparations. Seated against the farther wall the
  man he had come to see. In front of him was a desk, and set into the wall
  itself was a big safe, the door of which stood open. But the astounding thing
  was that a high openwork grille fenced him in completely, on the same
  principle that one sometimes in banks.</p>

  <p>"'Pardon these small precautions, Sir Archibald,' said the blackguard
  affably, 'but I have a rooted objection to revolver bullets or physical force
  in any form. So I prefer to conduct negotiations from this side of the
  grille. Our business will not take long. Do you recognise this letter?'</p>

  <p>"He held up a sheet of paper and Archie stared at it stupefied. It was in
  the girl's handwriting, and he could see that the address was that of her
  parents' house.</p>

  <p>"'How the devil did you get hold of that?' he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Mordon held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"'I must really beg of you to moderate your voice, Sir Archibald,' he
  said. 'Such lack of control is shockingly bad for digestion.'</p>

  <p>"The genuine Mordon touch, Bob: the swine always talks like that. "'I see
  that you do remember,' he continued. 'I don't wonder, either; it is not the
  sort of letter a man would forget. A little indiscreet, perhaps&mdash;but
  very affectionate. Have you had another week-end in Paris with the lady?'</p>

  <p>"I gather that at that point Archie went mad. He cursed and swore at the
  sneering moneylender behind his desk; he seized the steel bars of the grille
  and shook them, and as he said to me, if he had had a gun he'd have shot
  Mordon dead on the spot. It was perfectly true that he and the girl had spent
  a week-end in Paris, but it had been quite innocent. It had been on the
  occasion of the Davis Cup, and they had decided to go over and see it. She
  had made a fictitious date with a girl friend for the benefit of her parents,
  and had then gone over by the midday boat. He had flown. And they had stayed
  at the same hotel, though on different floors. Which was where the devil of
  it all came in. Whatever it was in reality, it looked, on the face of it,
  just about as certain a cinch as could well be thought of.</p>

  <p>"Archie pulled himself together, and explained the facts to Mordon, who
  began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"'Really, Sir Archibald, you pain me,' he said. 'Perhaps I had better
  refresh your memory as to some of the choicer phrases in the letter. Passing
  lightly over the opening gambit of "My own darling boy," we arrive in a
  slowly increasing crescendo to the illuminating statement that "the memory of
  those two nights will be with me for the rest of my life."'</p>

  <p>"Mordon put down the letter.</p>

  <p>"'Now, Sir Archibald, as a man of the world, what would you understand by
  that sentence? I, of course, am only too relieved to hear that my unworthy
  suspicions are unfounded, but it is just possible that there are other
  people&mdash;to wit, the charming lady's husband&mdash;who will not be so
  trusting.'</p>

  <p>"I gather Archie then went mad again, but Mordon must be used to scenes
  like that.</p>

  <p>"'You can't, man,' Archie yelled, 'you can't! Don't you know she's going
  to have a baby very soon?"</p>

  <p>"'Yes, I was aware of that fact,' said Mordon placidly. 'And it was in
  anticipation of such an occurrence taking place that I have held up this
  letter until now. It has, I think you will admit, a somewhat higher market
  value at the present time than it would have had a few months ago. Any severe
  shock might be very prejudicial to her health. And,' continued this
  super-swine, 'there is one other little point that I would like you to bear
  in mind, Sir Archibald. I realise that matters being as they are at the
  moment it is more than likely that her husband would keep things to
  himself&mdash;at any rate, until it is all over. So that in the regrettable
  necessity of my having to send this letter to him, a copy will go by the same
  post to the lady with a covering note informing her who has the
  original.'</p>

  <p>"To cut a long story short," went on, Ronald, "Archie had by this time
  realised what he was up against and demanded Mordon's price. It was forty
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" I cried. "Forty thousand. It's iniquitous."</p>

  <p>"Mordon is iniquitous."</p>

  <p>"Can Maitland pay it?"</p>

  <p>"He can and will, unless we can think of a way out. It's a sum even for
  him, but he's a wealthy man, and sooner than run the slightest risk of
  upsetting the woman in any way he is going to ante up. He regards the whole
  thing as being his fault for not tearing up the letter."</p>

  <p>"How did this man Mordon get hold of it?"</p>

  <p>"On that point Archie is not sure, though he thinks it must been through a
  valet that he sacked on the spot about a year ago. Anyway, Bob, how he got it
  doesn't really matter: he has got it. And for the life of me I can't think of
  any way out."</p>

  <p>"When has the money to be paid by?"</p>

  <p>"This day week," said Ronald savagely. "God! Bob, I'd give five thousand
  pounds to outwit that devil."</p>

  <p>"Is there any use in going to the police?"</p>

  <p>"Not an earthly. What can they do? In a blackmail case the only way of
  employing the police is for the victim to inveigle by some means the
  blackmailer into a room where the police are hidden. Archie has no chance of
  inveigling Mordon anywhere: all that side of his business is done in his own
  house. There's another thing that makes it impossible, too. Even supposing we
  could get the police to take action, we should be precipitating the very
  catastrophe which Archie wants at all costs to avoid. It might be kept as Mr.
  X. and Mr. Y. in the papers, but the husband bound to find out."</p>

  <p>"Well, my definite advice, old boy, is that Maitland should g at once to
  the husband and make a clean breast of it. You say he's a decent fellow."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite. Though I don't know how he'd take it. He has&mdash;how shall I put
  it?&mdash;distinctly old-fashioned ideas. Anyway, there's no good thinking
  about it, Bob. Archie has absolutely made up his mind on the subject and
  nothing will move him. Sooner than do that he will stump up the forty
  thousand."</p>

  <p>Ronald began pacing up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"I'd do anything," he said, "anything criminal, even, to beat that devil.
  But he's so cursedly clever. I swear that it is easier to get into Buckingham
  Palace than into his house. Every downstairs window is covered with steel
  bars, and at the slightest suspicious sound they let loose a mastiff that is
  the size of a donkey."</p>

  <p>"You have been down there, then?"</p>

  <p>"For the last three nights, trying to see if there's a possible chance of
  breaking in. Though what good one would do if one did I don't know. Even if I
  got into the holy of holies, what then?" said Ronald. "There's this grille to
  get through before you even begin to come to the safe."</p>

  <p>"Pretty risky, old boy. It would be pure and simple burglary."</p>

  <p>He looked me quietly in the face.</p>

  <p>"I'd risk it, Bob: risk it every time, if I thought it had the smallest
  chance of being successful. I'd stick at nothing to do him down.</p>

  <p>"If only there was some way of getting into the house, legitimately, so to
  speak. Through the front door, I mean. Then perhaps one might do something.
  But it's like entering a Masonic Lodge. I was hiding close by last night when
  a visitor arrived&mdash;evidently a manservant with something to sell. He
  rang the bell, and after a time the door, still on the chain, was cautiously
  opened a few inches, and the visitor was inspected. I heard him say: 'I've
  got some samples I want to show your master,' and after another prolonged
  inspection the man was admitted. That is clearly the Open Sesame, but it
  doesn't seem to help much unless you have got some samples. This fellow
  evidently had. I saw him counting notes the lamp-post by the gate after he'd
  come out ten minutes later."</p>

  <p>"Just an idea, Ronald," I said. "Probably perfectly useless. Would it be
  impossible to get a search warrant?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Quite," he answered. "No magistrate would sign one. And even if the
  police did manage to get one, what chance would they have of finding
  anything? Letters are very easily hidden, and they are his stock-in-trade.
  During the delay that would inevitably occur before they reached his room
  anything incriminating would have completely disappeared. No, bluff is the
  only thing. But how can we bluff?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't run him for being in possession of stolen property? After all,
  that letter was stolen from Maitland."</p>

  <p>Ronald stood still and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"It's an amazing thing, Bob," he said at length, "but do you know that
  that aspect of the case had not occurred to me? You're perfectly right. That
  letter is just as much stolen property as diamonds received by a fence.
  But&mdash;does it help us? Even to search a well-known fence's house the
  stolen goods have got to be traced to him. And it would be impossible in the
  case of that letter. Quite impossible. But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and suddenly the most extraordinary change came over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Bob," he yelled, "you blinking genius! And to think that all these long
  years I have misjudged you!"</p>

  <p>He snatched up his hat, and dashed out, hurling a Parthian shaft from the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Make no engagements. Stand by till I ring you up."</p>

  <p>Mr. Richard Mordon was feeling at peace with the world. A sense of well-
  being pervaded his entire system. With one hand he was warming a glass of old
  brandy, in the other he held a Corona Corona. He had dined to his complete
  satisfaction. In honour of the occasion he had allowed himself a pint of
  Perrier Jouet. The shaded lights gleamed on the polished table; the flames
  from a log fire&mdash;it was distinctly chilly for so early in
  September&mdash;flickered in the grate.</p>

  <p>Trade that day had been good: John Grant &amp; Co., the old-established
  Scotch house, had excelled itself. A well-known sporting peer; two ladies of
  title with wealthy but mean husbands; and the heir to a big margarine
  business formed the main catch.</p>

  <p>Not a bad bag, taking it all the way round, especially the margarine
  entrant. It would be many years before that young man got off the hook. But
  if these young idiots would go getting heavily into debt over some wretched
  chorus girl, then they deserved to I taught the error of their ways. In fact,
  as Mr. Mordon sipped his brandy a glow of self-righteousness spread over him.
  He was a public benefactor in teaching this youth and his like a
  well-deserved moral lesson. Only by sound business methods could the welfare
  and prosperity of the Old Country be built up.</p>

  <p>The door opened softly, and Mr. Mordon glanced up. A pimply youth was
  standing in the entrance with an ingratiating smirk on his face.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Mr. Mordon.</p>

  <p>"Following up your instructions, sir," began the youth.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," said Mr. Mordon curtly, "and come in. And be brief."</p>

  <p>The youth obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I again took the housemaid out to tea," he continued. "The nurse has
  already arrived, and the doctor is visiting her ladyship twice a day."</p>

  <p>"You reported that before," said Mr. Mordon irritably. "Anything
  fresh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The youth took a few steps forward and became confidential.
  "Complications, sir: they're afraid of complications. His lordship is
  terribly worried."</p>

  <p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"It's the talk of the servants' hall."</p>

  <p>"When is it expected?"</p>

  <p>"In a week or ten days, sir, but now they don't seem so sure. May be
  earlier."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon examined the ash on his cigar.</p>

  <p>"All right. That will do. Tell Mr. Benjamin to give you five pounds."</p>

  <p>He waved the youth out of the room, and once again contemplated his cigar.
  Complications! excellent. That made his position even stronger, in case Sir
  Archibald attempted to haggle.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch: nine o'clock. In another hour his man would be
  arriving. And then forty thousand pounds to cap the labours of the day.</p>

  <p>He refilled his glass with brandy. Assuredly life was good. Mr. Mordon
  knew it was good. He felt it in every fibre of his being. And why was it
  good? Simply because he possessed the gift of making it so. Other people who
  specialised in his&mdash;er&mdash;line were stupid. They spoiled the ship for
  a ha'porth of tar. They didn't pay their informants well. At least,
  informants was the wrong word: those people who had useful information to
  sell in the interest of public morality&mdash;that was a better way of
  putting it. That man, for instance&mdash;Sir Archibald's valet&mdash;what was
  his name? The man who had brought him the letter. James Fulton: that was it.
  Fifty pounds had been the price he had paid the fellow. A big sum. Some men
  he knew would have tried to foist him off with a flyer. Richard Mordon did
  not do business on those lines. Hence the goods&mdash;the real goods. And it
  paid&mdash; paid every time. None of your messy little suburban scandals for
  him, but the big stuff.</p>

  <p>Again the door opened this time it was Mr. Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"It's O.K. about that flyer, Benjamin," said Mr. Mordon.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Benjamin closed the door and advanced into the room.</p>

  <p>"A man with samples, sir," he said quietly. "He asked me to give you this
  envelope as a proof of his bona fides. He said also that he heard about you
  from Fulton&mdash;Sir Archibald Maitland's late valet."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon took the envelope and glanced at it. It had been opened and was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"The Earl of Bletcheley, Upper Bruton Street, W.," he read out
  thoughtfully. "And a coronet on the back. Where are the contents?"</p>

  <p>"Those, sir, are the samples. Belman&mdash;that is the name of the earl's
  valet&mdash;thinks they may interest you. They are in his pocket at
  present."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met, and Mr. Benjamin nodded. "Very good,
  Benjamin. I will see this man. I will ring when I am ready, as usual, and
  should, by any chance, Sir Archibald Maitland arrive before I have finished,
  ask him to be good enough to wait a few moments."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon made his way in leisurely fashion up the stairs to his office,
  feeling a glow of pleasurable anticipation. He did not know the writing on
  the envelope, but it was clearly feminine. Moreover, since it was in an
  educated hand, the writer, in view of the coronet, presumably belonged to the
  peerage. It was not a question of a servant borrowing notepaper. Which was
  all very, very good. The day was closing in a positive blaze of glory.</p>

  <p>He took his keys from his pocket and opened the door of the grille
  surrounding his desk. Then picking up a copy of Debrett sat down.</p>

  <p>"Bletcheley, Earl of. Arthur George, 10th Earl. b. April 4th, 1900."</p>

  <p>His eye skimmed down the page.</p>

  <p>"m. 1931 Lady Jane Mayhew, dau. of 5th Duke of Wessex." So he was thirty-
  three years old and recently married. "Seat Grantchester Towers, Yorkshire.
  Clubs Marlborough, Turf."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon closed the book. All very satisfactory so far, but there was
  one vital thing to find out&mdash;a thing not mentioned in that august tome.
  How stood Lord Bletcheley's finances?</p>

  <p>From a drawer in his desk he extracted a small black book, which he opened
  at a section marked B. Methodical in all his ways, Mr. Mordon always made a
  note of the real financial condition of any celebrity or well-known man, if
  such information should happen to come his way. (Bitter experience had that
  him that the real condition was frequently very different from the apparent.)
  But in this case all was well. He could not remember when he had entered it
  up, but there it was. "Bletchley quite sound." He replaced the little book,
  and picking up the speaking tube, told Benjamin to bring the man up.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later there entered a man who, to the expert eye of Mr.
  Mordon, was a typical gentleman's gentleman. The new-corner paused at seeing
  the somewhat alarming grille, but Benjamin having closed the door pushed him
  gently forward into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Now, Belman," said Mr. Mordon, in his most affable voice. "That is the
  name, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Well, Belman, I gather that you think that the contents of this envelope
  addressed to Lord Bletcheley may interest me."</p>

  <p>"You can bet your sweet life they will," answered Belman, with a coarse
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"You are Lord Bletcheley's valet?"</p>

  <p>"Was. Got the sack without notice this morning. Me, that's been with him
  five years. For doing a thing, too, that half the valets in London do."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" Mr. Mordon always believed in adding to his store of
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Wearing his evening clothes to go to a dance. Thought he was stayed put
  for the night, and walked straight into him as I came in."</p>

  <p>"And he gave you the sack?"</p>

  <p>"Without notice, and with a character that would keep me out of a
  Salvation Army band. But he didn't know what I'd found in the dress
  clothes."</p>

  <p>He gave a cunning leer, and pointed at the envelope.</p>

  <p>"Was it in the pocket?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. It was not. It was an old suit of his&mdash;one he hadn't worn
  for some time; and it had a hole in the inside breast pocket. I found that
  out as soon as I put my cigarette-case in, because it fell straight through
  into the bottom of the coat. And when I started to push it up again I
  realised that something else had fallen through before. So I got that out
  too. It was that letter."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Mordon. "May I look at it?"</p>

  <p>But now Belman began to get a little restive.</p>

  <p>"Look here, sir," he said. "Fair's fair. You're sitting behind a great
  iron fence. How do I know if I pass this letter through to you that you won't
  keep it and tell me to go to blazes?"</p>

  <p>"Because, my man, I don't do business that way. I gather it was from Sir
  Archibald Maitland's valet that you heard about me?"</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"And didn't he tell you I treated him fairly?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Belman reluctantly. "He did."</p>

  <p>"Then why should I do otherwise with you? This grille is merely a measure
  of precaution for such occasions when I have other types of client to
  interview. However, if you prefer it, I will come to you."</p>

  <p>He rose and came through into the room.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," said Belman sheepishly. "No offence meant. Here's
  the letter."</p>

  <p>14, Delchester Square, W.1 Tuesday</p>

  <p>Bimbo, my pet,&mdash;John has got to go to Berlin for three nights. From
  what Jane told me, she's going to stop with the male parent. What about it?
  The Five Feathers again. Not a chance of meeting anyone there.&mdash;
  TALIE.</p>

  <p>Mr Mordon studied it in silence for a while; then he glanced at
  Belman.</p>

  <p>"Bimbo, I presume, refers to the Earl of Bletcheley?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir. That's his nickname amongst all his friend Jane is, of
  course, her ladyship&mdash;his wife."</p>

  <p>"And who is the writer of this? Who lives at 14, Delchester Square?"</p>

  <p>The faintly contemptuous expression which gentlemen's gentlemen assume
  when dealing with lesser breeds without the law showed for a moment on
  Belman's face. What. social ignorance!</p>

  <p>"14, Delchester Square," he said, "is the London residence of his Grace
  the Duke of Chiltington. He is the John referred to."</p>

  <p>"And who is Talie?"</p>

  <p>Belman permitted himself a smile of triumph.</p>

  <p>"The Duchess. Her real name is Natalie, but her friends call her
  Talie."</p>

  <p>"Then this letter"&mdash;Mr. Mordon's voice was shaking with
  excitement&mdash;"this letter is a suggestion for a clandestine love
  affair?"</p>

  <p>Belman stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What else could it be? An invitation to go bird's-nesting?"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mordon ignored the impertinence. The stupendous nature of his haul
  had almost stunned him. A Duchess and Earl! It was incredible. Sir
  Archibald's mere Baronet seemed very small beer. A Duchess and an Earl! What
  a day! What an amazing day!</p>

  <p>"Where is the 'Five Feathers'?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Belman took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one. "Somewhere
  in the Malvern district," he answered. "Look here, Mr Mordon, it's like this.
  I can put two and two together as well as anybody. If you look at the
  envelope you'll see that half the stamp and the postmark are missing. But it
  doesn't require that to date the letter. I know when her ladyship went to
  stop with her father, and the Duke went to Berlin. It was the middle of July
  last. And it was then that the Earl went away for two nights without me. Now
  I'd had my suspicions for some time&mdash;you see that word 'again' in the
  letter..."</p>

  <p>"What had caused your suspicions?" asked Mr. Mordon.</p>

  <p>Belman smiled&mdash;a faintly contemptuous smile. "You may take it from
  me, Mr. Mordon, that there's precious little goes on amongst that lot that we
  don't know. And though I had no proof like that letter, I'd been wondering
  for quite a while. So when we were staying down in Sussex for Goodwood I put
  a few questions to the Duchess's maid, and found that her Grace had been away
  at the same time, by herself. She'd been staying with a friend near
  Malvern."</p>

  <p>"How did the maid know that?"</p>

  <p>"The Duchess told her so. And there was a Malvern label on her trunk."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon rubbed his hands together. Better and better. This man Belman
  was one after his own heart.</p>

  <p>"So there won't be much difficulty in locating the inn," continued Belman.
  "And then you've got your case complete. Now then, sir, how much?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon hesitated. Even with this crowning gem added to his collection
  he ran true to type. "How much do you want?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds," said Belman promptly. "Not a penny less. And it's
  worth ten times that to you."</p>

  <p>Which was certainly true, though it was five minutes before Mr. Mordon
  finally agreed to the figure.</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother to count them," he said, handing over a wad of notes.
  "They're new, as you can see. All that you've got to do is to look at the
  first and last numbers."</p>

  <p>But Belman was leaving nothing to chance. Slowly and laboriously he turned
  them over while Mr. Mordon watched him with growing irritation. He was in a
  fever of impatience to gloat in secret over his latest purchase.</p>

  <p>At last Belman was satisfied, and pocketing the notes he rose to say "Good
  evening, Mr. Mordon," he said. "And I don't know which of us is the bigger
  scoundrel."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him, leaving the owner of the house frowning at
  such a piece of monstrous insolence. But the frown soon disappeared as he
  once again read the letter in his hand. A Duchess and an Earl! It staggered
  him. Properly handled, this ought to be worth eighty thousand at least&mdash;
  perhaps more. And he was just passing through the door of the grille to go to
  his safe when the sounds of a commotion below made him pause in surprise and
  annoyance. A man of orderly habits, he disliked anything in the nature of a
  scene. Was it Belman making trouble? He thought he recognised his voice. He
  hastily unlocked the safe and deposited the letter inside.</p>

  <p>The noise grew louder. He could hear footsteps on the stairs. And the next
  moment, to his intense indignation, the door was flung open and a positive
  army of people poured into the room. There were a-police-sergeant and three
  constables, two of whom were holding Belman by the arms. There was a good-
  looking young man in plain clothes whose face seemed vaguely familiar to him,
  whilst in the rear of the cavalcade Benjamin hopped about like an agitated
  hen.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the meaning of this?" spluttered Mr. Mordon.</p>

  <p>"Caught him on your very doorstep, sir," said the sergeant cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Caught who?" said Mr. Mordon.</p>

  <p>"Belman. His lordship's valet."</p>

  <p>He nodded towards the young man in plain clothes, and a peculiar empty
  feeling began to assail Mr. Mordon in the pit of his stomach. It was one
  thing to deal with Duchesses and Earls on paper: it was somewhat different to
  have the actual Earl in question in the room with a posse of police.</p>

  <p>"What has he done?" He forced himself to speak casually.</p>

  <p>"Stolen a lot of things from his lordship's house," cried the sergeant.
  "And quite by chance he was seen by his lordship getting into the train at
  Charing Cross. What's the matter, Smith?"</p>

  <p>"Just found these in his pocket, Sergeant," said one of the constables,
  coming forward with the bundle of notes.</p>

  <p>"You precious scoundrel," cried the sergeant. "Something more of yours, my
  lord."</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Give the devil his due," he said, "for he's not guilty on that score. I
  don't know where he got 'em from, but they're not mine."</p>

  <p>"How did you get these notes, Belman?" asked the sergeant sternly. "Come
  on, my lad. It will be better for you in the long run to make a clean breast
  of it."</p>

  <p>And now Mr. Mordon's stomach was positively heaving.</p>

  <p>"If you want to know, Sergeant," he said in a shaking voice, "I gave them
  to him. I wanted the poor fellow to have a fresh start in life."</p>

  <p>He threw an agonised look at Belman. Surely the fool would take his cue.
  But Belman was staring at his late master, and suddenly, to Mr. Mordon's
  speechless horror, he took a step forward.</p>

  <p>"Fresh start be blowed," he said. "I'm sorry, my lord, more sorry than I
  can say that I've done what I have. But I was fed up with being sacked. I got
  this hundred pounds for one of your lordship's letters that I've just sold
  him."</p>

  <p>"You fool," screamed Mr. Mordon. "You blasted fool!"</p>

  <p>But no one paid any attention to him.</p>

  <p>"One of my letters?" said the Earl in a bewildered voice. "What the deuce
  are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"A letter from the Duchess of Chiltington to you, my lord," said Belman in
  a low voice. "I found it in the lining of your coat."</p>

  <p>And at last the Earl seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>"You damned swine!" he roared. "You infernal blackguard! By God! I'll
  murder you for that.'</p>

  <p>"Hold hard, my lord," said the sergeant quietly. "This wants looking
  into." He turned to Mr. Mordon. "Has this man sold you a letter of his
  lordship's?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mordon moistened his dry lips, but seemed unable to speak.</p>

  <p>"Come, sir, come," went on the sergeant sternly. "Yes or no?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," muttered the other at length.</p>

  <p>"And you bought it, knowing it to be stolen property?" He motioned to two
  of the constables. "You'll come along to the station, if you plea and explain
  to the inspector. I shall want you as well as Belman."</p>

  <p>"But, Sergeant," stammered Mr. Mordon, "I assure you I can make the matter
  clear."</p>

  <p>"Then you can do it to the inspector," said the sergeant curtly</p>

  <p>"But I have an important engagement tonight."</p>

  <p>"It must wait. Take him away; I'll be along shortly with Belman. One
  minute, though. He might destroy the letter on the way. Give it to me. I'll
  take charge of it."</p>

  <p>"It's in my safe, Sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Then open your safe. Come, sir, or do you wish me to take your keys from
  you by force?"</p>

  <p>Stumbling like an old man, Mr. Mordon went to the safe and opened it. His
  mind was seething chaos. Stolen property! Police stations! And what was the
  sergeant saying now? Leave it open. Preposterous! Impossible!</p>

  <p>"I will be responsible for all the contents."</p>

  <p>The man's odious voice seemed to come from a great distance Was it all
  some hideous nightmare? He, Richard Mordon, take to the police station. And,
  most dreadful thought of all&mdash;he could not explain. There was no
  explanation; it was stolen property.</p>

  <p>The sergeant watched him as he left the room pinioned between the two
  constables. Then he turned to Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"Clear out," he snapped. "If I want you, I'll send for you."</p>

  <p>The door closed. Mr. Benjamin's footsteps died away. And silence fell on
  the house a strange scene was enacted in Mr. Mordon's private study&mdash;a
  performance which would have caused that gentleman, had he seen it, such a
  rush of blood to the head that death would have been instantaneous. For a
  well-known member of the peerage, a sergeant, a constable, and a
  recently-sacked valet were sobbing gently with laughter in one another's
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Bob," said the Duke of Chiltington, removing his constable's helmet, "you
  were magnificent."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I remarked, with pride, "to what I was during the private
  interview."</p>

  <p>"Well, chaps, we must get on with it," said Ronald, unbuttoning his
  sergeant's tunic, and removing a false moustache.</p>

  <p>"What is the first of the doings?" asked the Earl of Bletcheley.</p>

  <p>"Find Archie's letter. And then burn every other damned blackmailing
  document in that safe."</p>

  <p>"Give me Talie's letter to Bimbo," said the Duke with a grin. "I want to
  have it framed."</p>

  <p>And for those who require the epilogue, I cannot do better than to quote
  verbatim a paragraph from the Daily Observer.</p>

  <p class="headline">OUTRAGE ON CITY MAN<br>
  WELL-KNOWN FINANCIER TARRED AND FEATHERED</p>

  <p class="newspaper">A dastardly outrage was perpetrated the night before
  last on Mr. Richard Mordon, the well-known financier. Mr. Mordon, who is a
  much-respected citizen of Sevenoaks, was discovered early yesterday morning
  wandering through some hop fields not far from Tonbridge completely covered
  from head to foot with tar and feathers. He is still somewhat dazed and
  incoherent, and from inquiries made at his house it was found that he was far
  too indisposed to see anyone. It is understood that the difficulty of finding
  out what happened has been greatly increased by the fact that the miscreants
  removed his false teeth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11">XI. &mdash; THE EMPTY HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONALD STANDISH glanced at the card he held in his hand, and
  then at our visitor.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Sinclair," he said, "and let's hear the trouble. But first
  let me introduce my friend, Mr. Miller."</p>

  <p>I looked at the old gentleman with some curiosity as he carefully
  deposited one of those antiquated hard felt hats, so beloved of our
  forefathers, on a chair. Pink-faced, with a small white beard, he was almost
  bald. He wore an old-fashioned frock-coat, and pepper-and-salt trousers. A
  massive chain adorned his waistcoat, whilst the large gold watch attached to
  it, which he consulted as he sat down, showed that he was certainly no
  pauper, whatever his clothes might be. He looked a typical example of a
  well-to-do retired tradesman who had high tea instead of dinner, called his
  wife "Mother" and handed round the plate in church on Sunday. In short, one
  of the last persons I should have expected to see in the room, and the
  faintest perceptible rise of his eyebrows showed that Ronald was thinking the
  same.</p>

  <p>"I have been told about you, Mr. Standish," Mr. Sinclair began in a
  precise, rather mincing voice, "by a gentleman for whom you acted with some
  success a few months ago&mdash;Mr. Harper. And though I do not approve of
  private detectives&mdash;I consider the police, for whose upkeep I pay,
  should be perfectly adequate to protect me&mdash;I have decided on this
  occasion to consult you. To start with, what is your fee?"</p>

  <p>It was not an auspicious beginning, and I stole a look at Ronald, whose
  face, however, was expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I think that before we trouble you to continue, Mr. Sinclair," he said,
  "we had better understand one another. In the first place, I am not a private
  detective in the accepted sense of the word. If a case amuses me I may look
  into it; if it doesn't, I don't. In the second place, I have no fee. If I
  decide to take up your case, I may, if they are heavy, charge you out-of-
  pocket expenses. But you must get quite clearly into your mind that, as you
  do not contribute towards my upkeep in the same way that you do for the
  police, it is I who am conferring the favour on you, should I act for you,
  and not you on me."</p>

  <p>I suppressed a smile. Rarely have I seen such a rapid change in anyone's
  demeanour as took place in our visitor's. All the pomposity vanished as if by
  magic, and what was left was a little old man, rather pathetically
  frightened.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, Mr. Standish," he stammered, "I didn't mean to offend you. I
  had no idea...I...I..."</p>

  <p>Standish smiled genially.</p>

  <p>"That's all, right, Mr. Sinclair," he said. "Don't think about it any
  more. Now let's hear what has sent you to me."</p>

  <p>"I do hope you will be able to assist me, Mr. Standish," he said
  earnestly. "I have been to the police and they don't seem to take it
  seriously."</p>

  <p>Ronald pushed a box of cigarettes towards him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no. I don't smoke. I suppose I'd better tell you all the facts
  that led up to the present situation."</p>

  <p>"If you please," said Ronald briefly.</p>

  <p>"I am a retired provision merchant, Mr. Standish," he began. "Many years
  ago I started in a small way, and by hard work I succeeded in building up
  what I may fairly claim to be one of the best-known chains of stores in the
  Midlands. I have a branch in almost every decent-sized town within a radius
  of thirty miles from Leamington, and up to a few weeks ago I retained full
  control in my own hands. But we none of us get younger, Mr. Standish, and
  some time ago my doctor warned me that I must take things easier. And so, to
  cut a long story short, I decided to give up active participation in the
  business, and enjoy a little well-earned leisure in the time that is left to
  me."</p>

  <p>His self-assurance was returning to him, and I wondered what on earth this
  distinctly boring preamble could be leading up to.</p>

  <p>"Now, while I was still in harness," he went on, "I had continued to live
  in the same house where I had first started. I had added a bit to it here and
  there, but I had never bothered to move, though my sister, with whom I live,
  had often suggested the advisability of doing so It had become, I admitted,
  hardly suitable in size or position, but you know what it is, Mr. Standish,
  to undertake all the discomfort and upheaval of a move. At any rate, I'd kept
  on putting her off on the plea that it was very convenient for my work, and
  that I hadn't got the time to bother with moving.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, when I finally retired that excuse no longer held water,
  and one day about two months ago she came to me with the announcement that
  she'd found the very thing for us&mdash;a big semi-detached house about two
  miles out of Leamington. The other half was let to an old lady called Miss
  Burton&mdash;who was almost an invalid.</p>

  <p>"So I went and had a look at it, and I must say I quite endorsed my
  sister's opinion. The rooms were large and comfortable, and the house stood
  well back from the main road so that passing traffic would not disturb us. At
  the same time buses passed frequently, which is a very important matter where
  servants are concerned in the country."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Ronald, but his face only expressed polite attention, and I
  remembered his invariable rule of letting people tell their story in their
  own way, however verbose.</p>

  <p>"And so, Mr. Standish, I decided to take it. A lot of work was necessary
  as the house had been empty for some time. It had to be completely repapered,
  and I wanted another bathroom put in. However, I went into the whole question
  with a good architect and plans were prepared.</p>

  <p>"Now, my first intention had been to rent it, and the house agents with
  whom I was doing the business&mdash;Messrs. Manfield and Pretty&mdash; were
  quite agreeable. Miss Burton, I understood, rented her half, and I proposed
  to do the same. And so we agreed provisionally at the figure of two hundred
  and fifty a year. Mark you, Mr. Standish, nothing was signed yet, and not
  deeming it necessary I hadn't even taken the trouble to get the first
  refusal.</p>

  <p>"Judge of my surprise then when one morning Manfield rang me up to say
  that someone else was after the house and would I go round and see him at
  once. I did.</p>

  <p>"'A very strange thing, Mr. Sinclair,' he said as I entered his office.
  'There, has been no one after that house for years, and now, it has suddenly
  become popular. And the trouble is that, as far as you are concerned, it is
  mere popular with my other client than with you.'</p>

  <p>"'You mean he's prepared to pay a higher rent?' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'Exactly, Mr. Sinclair.'</p>

  <p>"'What have you done about it?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"'I haven't closed with him, of course. That wouldn't have been fair
  without first letting you know. But business is business, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>"'Who is this newcomer?' I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Naturally he refused to tell me, but I gathered it was no one I knew. And
  though I was annoyed, I saw that Manfield was, perfectly right. He was acting
  on behalf of his own client, the landlord, and it was up to him to get the
  best terms he could. And then I suddenly had an idea. What about buying
  outright? It was almost certain that the owner would prefer it, and it was
  more than likely it would put my rival out of the running. And so I suggested
  it to Manfield, who jumped at the notion.</p>

  <p>"'I must, of course, inform the other gentleman who is after it,' he said,
  'and I will let you know the result.'</p>

  <p>"The price I had offered was four thousand five hundred pounds, and two
  days later Manfield rang me up to say that it, was mine at that sum. The
  other man wouldn't contemplate buying at all. And so work started right
  away.</p>

  <p>"All this," proceeded our visitor, "must seem very irrelevant, I fear, but
  I thought it best to tell you everything that could have any possible bearing
  on the extraordinary events of the last few weeks. All my life I have
  endeavoured to do my duty as a law-abiding citizen. So far as I know, I have
  not an enemy in the world. And now, just as I am preparing to settle down and
  enjoy a few years of peace, I am subjected to what I can only describe as a
  series of dastardly attacks."</p>

  <p>Ronald leaned forward attentively.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean physical attacks, Mr. Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"I do, sir," said the other individual, "though really those were the
  least annoying. But when it came to my poor sister being subjected to insult
  and rudeness then I decided it was time to consult you, since the police seem
  unable to do anything. This persecution&mdash;for I can call it nothing else,
  Mr. Standish&mdash;started before the workmen even commenced the
  alterations."</p>

  <p>He produced a bulky pocket-book and extracted a slip of paper. "This," he
  remarked, handing it to Ronald, "arrived by the first post one morning."</p>

  <p>I got up and looked over Ronald's shoulder. On the paper, which looked as
  if it was a leaf torn out of a cheap notebook, were scrawled the words:</p>

  <p>As you value your life do not go to Holmlea.</p>

  <p>The writing was illiterate, there was no signature, and for a few moments
  Ronald studied it carefully through a magnifying glass. Then he put it on the
  desk in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Hoimlea," he said, "is presumably the name of your new house?"</p>

  <p>"It is, Mr. Standish. I thought I'd mentioned that."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do on receipt of this?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Standish, to be perfectly frank, I did nothing. I didn't wish
  to alarm my sister unnecessarily, and at first I thought it was some stupid
  hoax, or that someone was trying to get his own back on me. I said a little
  while ago that I had, so far as I know, no enemies, but I ought perhaps to
  qualify that statement a little. You see, I am a magistrate, and in the
  ordinary course I of events it may he that I have incurred the enmity of
  someone who has come before the Bench."</p>

  <p>"Quite, Mr. Sinclair," said Ronald. "One more question before you proceed.
  Did you notice what the postmark was on the envelope?"</p>

  <p>"I did. It was Warwick, which, as you know, is close to Leamington."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded and made a note.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Mr. Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"As I say, I took no notice. I very nearly tore it up, but I finally
  decided to keep it, though I mentioned it to no one. The workmen started next
  day, and the matter had almost slipped from my mind when, happening to go to
  Holmlea to see how they were progressing, I saw an envelope addressed to me
  on the drawing-room mantelpiece. And the writing was the same as before.
  There was no stamp. It had evidently been left by hand. I opened it and found
  this."</p>

  <p>Once again he extracted a piece of paper from his pocket-book and passed
  it across to us. It was the same sort of paper as before, and this time the
  following words were written:</p>

  <p>You will have one more warning. If you don't take that, God help you.</p>

  <p>"I called the foreman," proceeded Mr. Sinclair, "and asked him if he knew
  anything about the note. He was an honest, conscientious man who had done
  work for me in the past, and I am convinced he would have told me if he had
  known anything. But he was just as much in the dark as I was. He said that he
  had seen the note on the mantelpiece when he started work that morning, and
  as it was addressed to me he had thought no more about it. And he was
  positive it had not been there overnight. At my request he got all his men
  together and asked them if they could throw any light on the matter, but they
  one and all professed complete ignorance of it."</p>

  <p>"This grows interesting, Mr. Sinclair," said Ronald thoughtfully. "I
  suppose you didn't think of asking the foreman if he was certain that the
  front and back doors were locked and all the windows bolted when he left the
  night before?"</p>

  <p>"But I did, Mr. Standish," cried the old gentleman triumphantly "You don't
  want to be a celebrated detective to see the importance of that."</p>

  <p>"True," murmured Ronald gravely. "And what did he say?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, nothing helpful. He could swear to both doors being
  locked, but he was not prepared to swear to all the window being bolted."</p>

  <p>"Did you show him the contents of the letter?"</p>

  <p>"No. I thought it better not to. But this time I took it, with the first
  one, and showed them both to the police. I went to Inspector Crawley, whom I
  knew personally from my position on the Bench, and asked him what he thought.
  And he was quite positive that the whole thing was a stupid hoax perpetrated
  by someone who had a grudge against me.</p>

  <p>"'What possible reason can anyone have, Mr. Sinclair,' he said, 'for
  trying to keep you out of the house? It's absurd on the face of it. Depend
  upon it, it's some man of low mentality who hast hit on this way of trying to
  frighten you. It's like the old stories one used to hear of threatening
  letters sent to people, signed with a skull and crossbones.'</p>

  <p>"So at that I left it, until a week later the third thing happened. And
  this time it was not confined to a letter. I was reading my paper after
  breakfast, when the architect was shown in, and I saw at once that something
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"'Will you come at once with me to Holmlea?' he said. 'I've got my car
  outside. I should like you to see the state of affairs for yourself.'</p>

  <p>"He said no more during the drive there, but when we arrived it was
  obvious that things were not going well. The men were all standing about
  doing no work, whilst the foreman, looking very worried, was at the gate.</p>

  <p>"'I've left everything, sir,' he said to my companion, 'for Mr. Sinclair
  to see&mdash;same as you told me.'</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Standish," continued the old gentleman, "to say that I was
  dumbfounded is no more than the literal truth. The place was like a bear
  garden. Pails of distemper had been thrown down the stairs; the new papers
  that they had put up in one or two rooms had been pulled off and hung in
  festoons; rubbish that had been collected into neat little heaps now littered
  the entire house. It looked as if a party of children had been let loose
  indoors with orders to do the maximum amount of wilful damage they could.</p>

  <p>"'It's incredible, Mr. Sinclair,' said the architect. 'In the whole course
  of my career I have never seen anything like it before.'</p>

  <p>"'Nor me,' said the foreman. 'And while I think of it, sir,' he continued,
  'there's another letter for you on the drawing-room mantelpiece.'"</p>

  <p>He passed the third over to us, and this time it was more brief.</p>

  <p>The third warning and the last.</p>

  <p>"Once again it had been left by hand," continued Mr. Sinclair, "and once
  again no one could throw any light on how it had got there."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," cried Ronald. "This is really one of the most intriguing
  stories I have heard for a long while. What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I asked the architect to send his car back to Leamington and get hold of
  Inspector Crawley. This had gone beyond a question of a stupid hoax, and
  something drastic would have to be done about it. He came at once and looked
  at the damage, and though he didn't admit it I could see he was completely
  nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"'I'll have a man on duty here every night,' he said, 'and then we'll see
  if these goings-on continue. Arid, seeing that it's come to this, sir,' he
  continued, 'it's just on the cards that I've solved it. This house has been
  empty for years, and it may be that tramps have been in the habit of dossing
  down in it at night. And now they're angry at losing their shelter.'</p>

  <p>"So at that it was left. The damage was repaired and work started once
  more. But though I had said nothing to the Inspector, an idea had struck me
  and I went off to see Manfield. Was possible that my unsuccessful rival was
  adopting this childish method of getting his own back? But Manfield would
  have none of it.</p>

  <p>"'Out of the question, Mr. Sinclair,' he said emphatically. 'Almost as
  much out of the question as a bishop robbing the poor-box in church. He was a
  perfectly respectable individual who saw Holmlea and happened to like it. But
  beyond a little natural disappointment when I told him you'd bought it, he
  showed no feeling on the matter. I mean there was no sign of any
  resentment."</p>

  <p>"I hope I am making everything clear, Mr. Standish?"</p>

  <p>"I wish everyone who sat in that chair was equally lucid," said
  Ronald.</p>

  <p>"From that day a policeman was on duty every night," continued Mr.
  Sinclair, "and nothing happened. The work proceeded apace and I began to
  think that the Inspector's theory was right. An then one morning about three
  weeks later came the next thing. The new bathroom had been finished except
  that some of the plumbing had still to be done, and unfortunately connecting
  up the waste pipe was one of the uncompleted jobs. Well, Mr. Standish, I
  don't know if you have any idea as to the damage that can be done in a night
  when a tap is left running full on after the bath has overflowed? I certainly
  hadn't until I saw Holmlea. The hall was inches deep in water; the plaster
  had come off the ceilings of most of the rooms, and several of the new
  wallpapers had peeled off.</p>

  <p>"Now, of course, this may have been a genuine accident. The constable on
  duty heard nothing and saw nothing the whole night. And yet I can hardly
  believe that even the most careless plumber would be such a fool as to leave
  the water running into a bath when he finished work. The man naturally swore
  that he hadn't, but I quite realise he would have sworn that in any event.
  And so it is possible that it was an accident."</p>

  <p>"If so, it was a very instructive accident," said Ronald quietly.</p>

  <p>"It was a very costly one," said the old gentleman ruefully.. "It threw
  back the work at least a fortnight. And what was worse, Mr. Standish, the
  workmen began to get jumpy. Thought there was something queer about the
  house, and really, I didn't blame them. In fact, had it not been that I had
  already paid the money, I think I should have backed out of it myself.</p>

  <p>"And now we come to a week ago. This time it was nothing to do with the
  house, and perhaps it had nothing to do with the affair at all. We have at
  one cross-roads an automatic traffic control of the usual red and green light
  variety, and I pass the spot every evening going to the club. Last Tuesday I
  got there as usual, and seeing the green light showing I proceeded to cross
  the road. I was half-way across when a small van drove straight at me, though
  the red light was showing as far as he was concerned.. I give you my word,
  Mr. Standish, he missed me by inches as I jumped for my life. Then,
  absolutely disregarding the traffic signal which still showed STOP, he shot
  over the cross-roads and disappeared, narrowly escaping a collision with
  another car. Unfortunately there was no policeman there&mdash;he has been
  dispensed with since the automatic device was installed&mdash;so there was
  nothing to be done. And I was so upset I could not even get the number of the
  van. But I am convinced, sir, in my own mind," he went on emphatically, "that
  it was a deliberate attempt to murder me."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be at all surprised if you are right," said Standish gravely.
  "Your story grows increasingly interesting, Mr. Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"I reported the matter to the inspector, but he was powerless. Moreover,
  he ridiculed the idea that it was anything more than an ordinary case of
  dangerous driving. And so I had to leave it, since there was no chance of
  catching the blackguard. Might I have a drink of water, Mr. Standish? All
  this talking makes my throat dry."</p>

  <p>I got him a glass from the sideboard, and he took a sip. "Thank you," he
  said. "Because now we are coming to the incident which decided me to come and
  see you. It occurred yesterday morning. I had been for a stroll in town, and
  when I returned for lunch I found my sister in a state of terrible
  agitation&mdash;in fact, she was almost in hysterics, so much so that for
  some time she was unable to tell me what had happened. But at last I got it
  out of her. It appeared that she, too, had been for a walk, and had come back
  by a road which is very little used. Half-way along it she became aware that
  two rough men were following her. Considerably alarmed, she quickened her
  steps, but it was useless. They overtook her&mdash;one on each side, and one
  of them seized her arm.</p>

  <p>"'Listen here, old woman,' he said to her, 'you tell that brother of yours
  to quit the idea of going to Holmlea, or it will be the worse for both of
  you.'</p>

  <p>"Then they disappeared, leaving her half fainting with fright. And nothing
  that I could say pacified her. It had, of course, been impossible to prevent
  her knowing about the damage that had been done to the house, though I had
  told her nothing about the three notes. But when this happened to her she at
  once put two and two together, and refused to accept any more my explanation
  that it had been the work of some irresponsible tramp. In short, Mr.
  Standish, she is thoroughly alarmed and flatly refuses to go to Holmlea at
  all, which means that I lose my money, and, what annoys me more even, these
  scoundrels, whoever they are, have succeeded in doing what they set out to
  do."</p>

  <p>The little man's jaw stuck out, and for a moment one could se the
  underlying character that had built up that chain of stores.</p>

  <p>"Can you help me, Mr. Standish?"</p>

  <p>"I will most certainly try to," said Ronald warmly. "But there are one or
  two questions I would like to ask you. Is that policeman still on duty at
  night?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you a person of fairly fixed habits? For instance, do yo usually go
  to the club at the same time every day?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Generally about half-past four. You mean, that the driver of that van
  might have known that fact?"</p>

  <p>"Not might&mdash;but did know that fact," said Ronald dryly. "Now Mr.
  Sinclair, I want you to obey my instructions implicitly. Tell your architect
  to stop work; say that you've changed your mind about going to live at
  Holmlea; have a FOR SALE board put up in the garden; and, lastly&mdash;and
  this is important&mdash;tell the Inspector you no longer want a policeman
  there at night."</p>

  <p>The old gentleman looked at him with growing indignation. "But that will
  be giving in all along the line," he cried. "I intend to live in
  Holmlea."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Ronald. "But unless you do what I tell you the betting is
  all against your ever doing so. The next time that van won't miss you."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I see, just pretence."</p>

  <p>"Yes." answered Ronald curtly; "but it's got to be pretence that will
  carry conviction that those are your genuine intentions."</p>

  <p>"But what do you make of it, Mr. Standish?" he asked pathetically. "Why on
  earth should I of all people be signalled out for this persecution? Who are
  the scoundrels?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you may take one thing from me, my dear sir," said Ronald gravely,
  "they are not tramps. You have been moving in deep waters, Mr. Sinclair; how
  deep, at the moment, I am not prepared to say. Do not tell anyone that you've
  come to me. Do just what I've said, and we'll see if we can solve your little
  problem. And one other word&mdash;should we by chance meet in Leamington, you
  don't know me. Good day to you."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him, and Ronald rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"We're going to have some fun, Bob," he said. "Put some rubber shoes in
  your bag and a gun. We'll motor down to Leamington this afternoon for a
  preliminary survey of the land."</p>

  <p>"Got any ideas?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Only one," he answered. "And that is that the episode of the bath water
  is singularly instructive."</p>

  <p>And not another word could I get out of him.</p>

  <p>Holmlea proved to be much as I had pictured it, as we drove past that
  afternoon. It stood some forty yards back from the road, and a hedge
  separated its garden from that of Burnlea, which was the other half of the
  house. As yet Mr. Sinclair had not had time to carry out all his
  instructions, and work was still proceeding. But a board had been erected
  facing the road announcing that it was to be Let or Sold, and Ronald returned
  to Leamington in high spirits.</p>

  <p>"I'll just ring up the old boy," he said, "and find out about the
  policeman."</p>

  <p>He returned in a few moments even more pleased than before.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he cried. "The men are going to be discharged this evening,
  and the policeman removed. So it's just possible, Bob, that our vigil tonight
  may produce some result. If it doesn't, we shall have to try again."</p>

  <p>"In Holmlea, presumably." I remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and summoning a waiter ordered two pints.</p>

  <p>"Just so," he said. "And so I fear you will have to entertain yourself
  until it's dark enough to go there."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For a stroll," he answered. "There are one or two little things I wish to
  clear up, and you can't help me."</p>

  <p>He finished his beer, and left the hotel whilst I sat on, puzzling over
  the problem. The whole thing seemed so strange and pointless. What could
  there be about Holmlea, which, so far as I had been able to see, was like
  scores of other houses, that so interested these mysterious individuals?
  Could it be that there was booty hidden somewhere in the house; the proceeds
  perhaps of some old burglary? That the burglars had just completed their
  sentence and now wanted leisure to recover their loot? Or was the Inspector's
  theory of tramps correct in spite of Ronald's statement to the contrary?</p>

  <p>Time dragged by slowly, and at last I went in to dinner. I knew there was
  no use waiting for Ronald: past experience had taught me what "one or two
  little things to clear up" meant in his case. And, sure enough, it was not
  until nearly ten that he appeared again, but a glance at his face showed that
  the clearing up had been successful. He was in a state of barely-suppressed
  excitement, and that for him was pretty remarkable. He was not a man who
  often allowed his feelings to show.</p>

  <p>"A most interesting evening, Bob," he remarked. "And I trust there will be
  no falling off during the rest of the night. Has my good friend McIver
  arrived?"</p>

  <p>"The Scotland Yard fellow?" I cried. "I haven't seen him. So you've found
  out something?"</p>

  <p>"Even more than I anticipated, old boy," he grinned. "Assuredly it was
  lucky in more senses than one that our worthy Mr. Sinclair came to us this
  morning. Hallo! here is McIver at last."</p>

  <p>"Evening, Mr. Standish," said a burly-looking man who had come up to the
  table. "I came as soon as I could. Are you sur you're right?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain, Mac. I went and called this evening, and there was no
  mistaking that deformed hand."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's going to be a damned good night's work if we catch 'em," said
  McIver. "What about the local police?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen Inspector Crawley myself," said Ronald, "and I told him we
  don't want an army of men. The small fry don't count when all is said and
  done, and if we have posses of policemen marching up the road we'll be stung.
  So he's sending half a dozen of his best men by a roundabout route and he's
  coming with himself. In fact&mdash;here he is."</p>

  <p>The two inspectors shook hands, and then Ronald glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Time we went," he said. "Put on your rubbers, Bob, and bring your gun, in
  case it's wanted."</p>

  <p>I rejoined them a few minutes later, and we all got into a waiting
  taxi.</p>

  <p>"Stop half a mile short of Holmlea," Ronald told the driver as we started
  off.</p>

  <p>And now I was beginning to feel excited. That something big was afoot was
  obvious, though what it was I had no idea. But a man in McIver's position
  would not have come post-haste from London for some trifling larceny.</p>

  <p>"'Ere you are, gents," said the driver, pulling up. "'Olmlea's just round
  the bend there in front of you."</p>

  <p>We paid him off, and then Ronald took charge.</p>

  <p>"Got to do a bit of trespassing," he said, "for we can't possibly go along
  the road. Follow me. I. explored the route this evening."</p>

  <p>He turned into some undergrowth, and silently led the way. A slight wind
  was stirring the branches of the trees, and twice during our walk a motor-
  bus rumbled past on the road a few yards away. The night was dark, and there
  was no moon, which made the going difficult, but at length he stopped and we
  closed up on him.</p>

  <p>"There's the house," he whispered, "just in front of us. I've got the key
  of the front door, but the difficulty is going to be in getting over this bit
  of open. They may have scouts round the place."</p>

  <p>"You get the door open, Mr. Standish," muttered McIver "then we'll dodge
  across singly."</p>

  <p>Like a shadow Ronald vanished, and a minute later a faint click told us he
  had been successful. Then one by one we flitted across the lawn and joined
  him in the hall.</p>

  <p>The house was deathly silent. Not even the ticking of a clock could be
  heard.</p>

  <p>"Be careful how you walk," whispered Ronald. "There may still be buckets
  and things about."</p>

  <p>On tiptoe we followed him, until we found ourselves in a small vestibule
  leading off the hail. In front of us were steps going down to the kitchen
  premises, which we could dimly see by the light of a street lamp outside.</p>

  <p>And then commenced an eerie vigil. No one spoke. No one even whispered. We
  merely stood and waited&mdash;I, at any rate, with no idea what for. And it
  was just as very faintly in the distance we heard a church clock chime
  midnight that a sudden sharp click came from below. I felt Ronald stiffen.
  The moment had come.</p>

  <p>Scarcely breathing, we stood there. Stealthy footsteps were coming up the
  stairs. They passed our door, and continued up the next flight. And it was
  then that I became aware for the first time of a peculiar rhythmical noise
  that seemed to shake the whole house. Thump: thump: thunip&mdash;it went on
  without cessation, just as if some big engine was working.</p>

  <p>But another sound distracted my attention. The bath tap had been turned on
  above. The splash of water was clearly audible, though it did not prevent us
  hearing a creak on the stairs as the mysterious visitor descended again.</p>

  <p>"Catch him as he passes us," breathed Ronald. "Silently, if possible."</p>

  <p>But that was not to be. In the dim light we impeded one another, and the
  man as we sprang on him let out one wild shout before a heavy blow on the
  back of his head stunned him.</p>

  <p>"Move!" shouted Ronald. "Before they get the opening closed." We fell down
  the kitchen stairs, and into the scullery. Through a hole in one wall light
  was streaming, and we dashed through to find ourselves in a long passage. And
  the thumping noise had ceased.</p>

  <p>We raced along and burst open a door at the end. And then things happened.
  I had a fleeting vision of a hall with an oil lamp, swinging from the
  ceiling, of two furious-looking men and a wizened-up old woman standing
  underneath it. Then something red-hot seared through my chest, and I felt
  myself falling into blackness, punctuated by the crack of revolver shots.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"MY dear old Bob&mdash;thank God he didn't kill you. The
  bullet missed everything vital."</p>

  <p>Ronald was leaning over the foot of the bed, in a strange room when I
  opened my eyes, and a hospital nurse was hovering around. I was bandaged up
  tightly, 'but otherwise I felt all right.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind explaining what happened?" I said.</p>

  <p>"You got plugged through the chest by one of the most notorious criminals
  in Europe, who is now safely under lock and key with several of his
  associates."</p>

  <p>"But how did you spot it in the first place?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"You are not to tire yourself," said the nurse, coming forward.</p>

  <p>"I promise I won't," I cried. "But I shall start biting the bedclothes
  unless this old scoundrel satisfies my curiosity."</p>

  <p>Ronald grinned.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, nurse. I can do it very quickly. Well, Bob, from the word
  'go' I dismissed the idea of tramps being at the bottom of it. One thing
  alone ruled them out absolutely. Tramps are not in the financial position to
  hire motor cars to kill people with. And so we were confronted with the
  plains bald fact that some person or persons were prepared to go to almost
  any lengths to prevent Holmlea being occupied. Obviously it had nothing to do
  with Sinclair himself. He only came into the matter because he was the
  prospective householder.</p>

  <p>"Now, why do you want to keep a house unoccupied? For one of two reasons:
  either that you wish to use it yourself surreptitiously, or because you're
  afraid the occupier will inconvenience you in some way. And of the two the
  second is the more likely.</p>

  <p>"To carry on again, who were the people most likely to be inconvenienced
  by the tenant of Holmlea? Quite obviously the tenants of Burnlea, and at an
  early stage in the proceedings I determined to have a close look at the
  invalid lady, Miss Burton. Because it seemed well-nigh impossible that a
  genuine old lady, however passionately she desired privacy, would hire a gang
  of hooligans to wreck someone else's property.</p>

  <p>"Then came the episode of the bath, which, as I said, was very
  instructive, because it clinched almost for certain that in Burnlea lay the
  seat of the trouble, and that there was some communication between the two
  houses. While there was no constable on watch it didn't matter what damage
  they did, since it could be attributed to a man entering the house from
  outside. But once the policeman was there that was impossible. He would know
  that no one had got in from outside. And so the only damage they could do was
  what would appear accidental. They couldn't again upset the whitewash, for
  then it would be known that someone had been in the house, and if he hadn't
  come from outside he must have come from inside: that is, from Burnlea. But
  with the bath no one need have been in the house at all. It could be
  attributed to a workman's carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's about all. When I left you that evening at Leamington I made
  a few changes in my personal appearance, and called at Burnlea. I did not see
  Miss Burton, but I did see the butler, and one glance was enough. He had a
  curiously distorted right hand, the result of a knife brawl some years ago,
  and I recognised him at once. It was a gentleman called Galliday whose
  speciality was coining, and the whole thing became clear. Coining is by no
  manner of me a silent job, as you heard yourself last night."</p>

  <p>"You mean that thumping noise," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And they couldn't see old Sinclair and his sister standing for
  that either by day or night. So I got on to McIver, and the rest you know.
  The old invalid lady was one of the most dangerous anarchists alive&mdash;a
  Frenchman called Pierre Martin. In fact, the whole gang was just about as
  pestilential a sore as you'd find anywhere. That they would again try the
  bath trick never occurred to me; I wanted to hear that engine going so as to
  be absolutely certain."</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, a horrified expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"What is it, old boy?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bob," he said, "something has just dawned on me. In the
  excitement of the moment nobody has turned the bath water off!"</p>

  <p>THE TIDAL RIVER</p>

  <p>"The very person I've been wanting to see. I rang up your rooms, and your
  man told me you'd probably be dining in your club."</p>

  <p>I glanced up from my coffee. A man by the name of Mervyn Davidson was
  standing by our chairs. I only knew him slightly, but Ronald Standish had
  shot with him once or twice.</p>

  <p>"Could you possibly come down to my place tomorrow," continued Davidson,
  "or are you too busy?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean professionally?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other, pulling up a chair. "Do you mind, at any rate, if I
  tell you the story?"</p>

  <p>"Fire right ahead," said Ronald, lighting a cigar.</p>

  <p>"The thing happened yesterday," began Davidson, "and at first everybody
  thought it was an accident. However, as you don't know any of the people
  concerned I'd better start by putting you wise to them and to the locality.
  You've been down my way, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Only once," said Ronald. "So take it that I'm quite ignorant."</p>

  <p>"I will," said Davidson. "My house is just five miles from the sea, and as
  you may perhaps remember, the River Ling forms one boundary to the
  property."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I recollect that. Tidal, isn't it, as far as you?"</p>

  <p>"For three or four miles farther up-stream. A muddy bit of water, but
  unfortunately it plays a big part in the tragedy which concerns my next-door
  neighbour, a retired business man named Varrow. Do you want my estimate of
  the gentleman, or would you prefer to keep an open mind?"</p>

  <p>"I want everything that bears on the case," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"His character certainly does that," said Davidson, "but I didn't want to
  bias you in any way. In short, then, he was a most unpleasant
  individual."</p>

  <p>"Was?" Ronald raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that. Yes, he was a most unpleasant man, and one of the
  incomprehensible things of life is how his perfectly charming wife came to
  marry him. She is years younger than him, and an extremely pretty woman. He
  must have been well over fifty, whereas she is on the right side of thirty.
  Exactly what his business was I can't tell you: he was one of the most morose
  and uncommunicative men I've ever met. But it must have been lucrative, as
  there was no shortage of money about the mÚnage. I've dined with them off and
  on, and I know the style they lived in.</p>

  <p>"It was not, however, an entertainment I indulged in more than I could
  help, because the atmosphere of the household was so damnable. He was
  frequently rude to her in front of the servants, and even if he wasn't that
  he had that cold, sarcastic manner that made one long to hit him.</p>

  <p>"He had one hobby, and one hobby only, so far as I know&mdash; fishing in
  the Ling. Everyone to his own taste, and if it appeals to a man to sit on the
  bank of a muddy river fishing for uneatable fish with a worm and a float, by
  all manner of means let him do so. He certainly did, for hours on end. The
  river flowed past his place, but between it and his boundary was a right of
  way. And it was at one particular spot on this path that he always took up
  his position.</p>

  <p>"Now, though the path is a right of way, it is very little used. Probably
  not more than two people go along it a day, though sometimes on Sundays the
  customary loving couples walk there. But on weekdays it is practically
  deserted. Well, it so happened that the day before yesterday I was down near
  the river giving instructions to my gardener about one or two things, when I
  saw a man called Stapleton coming along the path. His trousers were dripping
  with water, and the instant he saw me he gave a shout.</p>

  <p>"'For God's sake come, Davidson. Yarrow has been drowned.'</p>

  <p>"The gardener and I went at once, and sure enough it was so, Wedged
  against a sunken tree by the pressure of the water was his body, and a glance
  was sufficient to show that it was too late to do anything. His hat was on
  the bank, and a campstool and creel.</p>

  <p>"'I tried to get him out,' said Stapleton, 'but he was too heavy for
  me.'</p>

  <p>"'When did you find him?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'Five minutes ago,' he said. 'I was walking from Briggs's farm and as I
  passed I saw that hat, which I recognised as his. So I looked over the edge
  and there he was.'</p>

  <p>"Between us we hoisted the body out and laid it on the bank. I sent my
  gardener back for a hurdle, and while he was away we made an attempt at doing
  some artificial respiration. But it was utterly hopeless, and we both knew
  it.</p>

  <p>"'How on earth did it happen, I wonder?' I said after we had desisted.</p>

  <p>"'The only thing I can think of,' said Stapleton, 'is that he fainted, or
  had a fit, and fell in. The water is comparatively shallow; if he'd been
  conscious he'd have had no difficulty in getting out.'</p>

  <p>"Which was perfectly true, as the bank though steep was not high. No one
  would have had the smallest trouble in scrambling out, and it seemed to me
  that his solution must be the correct one.</p>

  <p>"At last the hurdle arrived, and we put him on it. And then it struck me
  that somebody had better go on in advance to prepare Mrs. Yarrow for the
  news. Stapleton evidently did not want to, so I said I would. I didn't relish
  the job: with a woman, one never knows. He had treated her like a dog during
  his life, but for all that you can't tell how they'll take things. To my
  intense relief she kept perfectly calm. She turned white and swayed a bit;
  then she asked me quite quietly what to do.</p>

  <p>"'I think the best thing would be to put the body in the billiard-room,' I
  said. 'You realise, Mrs. Yarrow, that he'll have to be seen by a doctor, and
  possibly the police may come into it. But, of course, it will be entirely a
  formality. It's obvious what happened.'</p>

  <p>"'I repeated Stapleton's theory, and she listened in silence. And then, in
  view of subsequent developments, she made a rather strange remark: 'My
  husband has never fainted in his life.'</p>

  <p>"At the time I thought nothing of it; they were just carrying in the body,
  and I went to see if I could be of any assistance. We laid it on the floor,
  and Stapleton put the hat and the creel on the table. And then we waited a
  bit awkwardly, nobody quite knowing what to do next. I dismissed the gardener
  and the man who had helped him, and Stapleton and I talked in the hushed
  tones one uses in the presence of death. Little pools of water were forming
  on the floor under him, but it seemed indecent to move him again.</p>

  <p>"'I liked him, you know,' said Stapleton, 'though I know he was not
  popular. But it's a pretty mouldy end! And to think that I took a photograph
  of him on my way out to Briggs this morning. I never thought that the next
  time I saw the poor devil he'd be like this.'</p>

  <p>"Half an hour later Dr. Granger arrived, and Stapleton and I left him to
  do what was necessary. Mrs. Yarrow had gone to her room, and I gave a message
  for her to the butler, to say that if there was anything I could do to help
  she must have no hesitation in ringing me up. Then, since there was nothing
  more to be done, I suggested to Stapleton that he should come over to my
  house and have a drink. I felt I badly needed one.</p>

  <p>"An hour passed when suddenly the telephone rang. I went to it, and heard
  the voice of Sergeant Grayson at the other end. Being on the Bench, I knew
  him very well; a good man, distinctly above the average local policeman in
  intelligence. Would I go up to the Yarrows' house, and take Stapleton with
  me: some startling developments had taken place.</p>

  <p>"We went immediately, wondering what on earth they could be, and the
  butler showed us into the billiard-room. The doctor was still there, with the
  sergeant and a constable, and all their faces were very grave.</p>

  <p>"'Sorry to trouble you, sir,' said Grayson to me, 'but it was unavoidable.
  May I ask both you gentlemen to tell me all you know.'</p>

  <p>"We did so, and when we'd finished he looked significantly at the doctor,
  who nodded.</p>

  <p>"'The fact is, Davidson, said Granger, 'that this is not a simple case of
  drowning. Yarrow was drowned all right, but it was the result of foul play.
  He didn't faint or have a fit, which was what I, too, first thought: he was
  stunned by being hit a heavy blow with some weapon on the base of his skull.
  He then pitched forward into the water, and probably was drowned almost
  instantaneously.'</p>

  <p>"'Good God!' I cried, aghast. 'Are you sure, doctor?'</p>

  <p>"'Quite sure, I'm sorry to say. The bruise is there plain for all to see,
  and by the feel of it I think something is chipped or broken inside. So you
  can guess how fierce the blow was.'</p>

  <p>"'But who did it?' I said, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"'That, sir,' said the sergeant, 'is what we've got to try and find out.
  And we have one very valuable piece of evidence. Mr. Yarrow's watch stopped
  at half-past two. Which proves conclusively that the poor gentleman met his
  end before that hour. Now, sir'&mdash;he turned to Stapleton&mdash;'as you
  seem to have been one of the last people to see him alive, can you add
  anything to what you have already told us?'</p>

  <p>"'I can't, Sergeant,' answered Stapleton. 'I passed Mr. Yarrow just as he
  was packing up for lunch. It must have been about one o'clock, as I reached
  Briggs's house at ten minutes past. I had one film left in my camera, and as
  I wanted to get the roll finished I asked him to pose in the most
  characteristic attitude I could think of&mdash;sitting on his campstool
  fishing. I then had lunch, and the rest you know. I left Briggs's farm
  between five-and-twenty and twenty to three, and found the body in the river.
  I went in and tried to get him out, but I couldn't. And then Mr. Davidson
  came on the scene.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't you think, Sergeant,' I put in, 'that it would be a good thing to
  get hold of the butler and find out about times from him?'</p>

  <p>"So the butler was sent for, and it's his evidence that has brought me to
  you, Standish. I can't believe the boy did it, but I'm bound to say things
  look just about as black as they can be&mdash;Sorry: I'm jumping ahead too
  fast.</p>

  <p>"It appears that Yarrow came in to lunch shortly after one to find a
  youngster called Christopher Stern having a cocktail with Mrs. Yarrow. And
  now comes the part that has got to be told, though naturally the butler said
  nothing about it. He knew, of course&mdash;we all did: you can't keep things
  like that dark in the country. Young Stern is in love with Mrs. Yarrow and
  has been for years, though what her feelings are on the matter I don't
  know.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, it was quite clear from what the butler implied that his
  master was not at all pleased to find Stern there, and when he discovered
  that his wife had asked the boy to lunch he was even less pleased. Looking
  back now I remember having heard from other sources that Yarrow was very
  jealous of his wife, and it was obvious from what the butler said that the
  lunch was not a great success. We pressed him to be more explicit, but he is
  a good servant. And the most we could get out of him was that Yarrow was in a
  bad temper.</p>

  <p>"Now comes the damning part. At a quarter past two Yarrow gathered his
  fishing tackle together, and the butler saw him standing in the hall talking
  to Stern. He was speaking angrily, though the butler did not hear what he
  said. But it ended in the two men leaving the house together and taking the
  direction of the river."</p>

  <p>Davidson paused, and beckoning a waiter, ordered drinks. "More than that,"
  he continued, "the butler could not say, but it was enough to make things
  begin to look ugly for Stern. And the boy's own statement of what happened
  didn't help much. We telephoned for him and he came round at once. And I
  think we all watched him as he came into the room. He saw the body, turned as
  white as a sheet and clutched the table as if he was about to fall.</p>

  <p>"'What's happened?' he muttered.</p>

  <p>"'I want you to tell me, sir' said the sergeant, 'exactly what took place
  this afternoon after you left this house with Mr. Yarrow!'</p>

  <p>"'But I don't understand,' stammered the youngster. 'I know nothing about
  it.'</p>

  <p>"After a while he pulled himself together and his story tallied exactly
  with the butler's. Yarrow and he had had words after lunch&mdash;he refused
  to say what about, but we all of us knew&mdash;and it had finished up with
  Yarrow forbidding him the house. They had gone out together and he had walked
  with Yarrow as far as the river. And there he had left him to his
  fishing.</p>

  <p>"'Where did you go?' asked the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"'Along a path somewhere: I really forget,' said Stern.</p>

  <p>"'And what time did you leave Mr. Yarrow?'</p>

  <p>"This again Stern couldn't remember: he supposed he'd stayed two or three
  minutes.</p>

  <p>"'So, Mr. Stern,' said Grayson gravely, 'you know nothing about Mr.
  Yarrow's death?'</p>

  <p>"'Absolutely nothing.'</p>

  <p>"'You didn't have a struggle with him or strike him with anything?'</p>

  <p>"'Good God! no. Why do you ask?'</p>

  <p>"'Was anyone else there while you were with him?'</p>

  <p>"'I saw no one.'</p>

  <p>"'And you didn't pass anybody as you went along the path?'</p>

  <p>"Again he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Not that I'm aware of,' he said. And then, after a moment, he added:
  'But I was all worked up and I might not have noticed. Anyway,' he cried
  wildly, 'what is it all about? Why are you asking me all these
  questions?'</p>

  <p>"'I am asking you these questions, Mr. Stern,' said Grayson, 'because so
  far as we know at present you are the last person who saw Mr. Yarrow alive.
  And Mr. Yarrow was murdered.'</p>

  <p>"'Murdered!'</p>

  <p>"The word was just breathed&mdash;barely audible, and once again Stern
  clutched the table.</p>

  <p>"'Who by? But&mdash;but, it looks as if he'd been drowned.' And then,
  wildly: 'Great Heavens! you don't suspect me?'</p>

  <p>"Grayson stared at him.</p>

  <p>"'I didn't say I did, Mr. Stern. But you left the house at a quarter past
  two with Mr. Yarrow; you must, therefore, have arrived at the river at about
  twenty past. You tell me you remained talking for two or three minutes.' He
  paused impressively. 'And Mr. Yarrow was murdered before half-past.'</p>

  <p>"'You keep on saying he was murdered,' said Stern. 'How do you know
  that?'</p>

  <p>"'He was hit on the back of the head and stunned,' answered Grayson. 'Then
  he fell into the water and was drowned.'</p>

  <p>"And at that it was left for the time. Whether or not they have actually
  arrested young Stern yet, I don't know, but it's only a question of hours
  before they do so. And I wondered, Standish, if you would come down and run
  your eye over the country, so to speak. I'd like to do everything I can for
  Stern&mdash;he's an extra ordinarily nice boy. But I must confess it looks
  pretty hopeless to me.</p>

  <p>"You think, then, that he did it?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"What else can one think? We know that he was with Yarrow just before it
  happened; we know that they were having a quarrel over Mrs. Yarrow. We know
  also that the place where they were is usually entirely deserted, so that the
  chances of someone else being there are remote."</p>

  <p>Davidson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am quite prepared to believe," he continued, "that Stern didn't even
  know he'd killed him. That in a moment of ungovernable rage he hit Yarrow and
  knocked him out, and that then, after he had gone, Yarrow rolled over and
  fell in the water and was drowned. In which case it might be possible to make
  it a case of manslaughter only."</p>

  <p>"What does Mrs. Yarrow say?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, so far as I know. I gather that she has admitted that her
  husband did not like Stern, but we knew that already. In fact, with regard to
  yesterday, the butler knows far more than she does."</p>

  <p>"Well, there are certainly one or two very significant points," said
  Ronald, lighting a cigarette. "So, if you like, Davidson, Bob and I will come
  down tomorrow. I suppose there's a pub some where handy."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I wouldn't dream of letting you do that. I can put both
  of you up with the greatest of pleasure in the world. But I'm afraid it's
  pretty hopeless for young Stern. There's a good train from Liverpool Street
  at ten. I'll meet you at the other end."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Bob?" said Ronald, as Davidson went off to write
  a letter.</p>

  <p>"Told as he's told it, I must say I agree with him. It looks black for
  Stern. Motive, opportunity, time&mdash;everything seems to fit."</p>

  <p>"Almost too well," said Ronald. "However, we'll see?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">TRUE to his promise, Davidson met us at the station.
  "They've arrested him," were his first words. "I'm afraid it's a waste of
  time for you, Standish."</p>

  <p>"When did they do it?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Immediately after the inquest this morning. Hallo! there's
  Stapleton&mdash;the man who found Yarrow's body."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand, and a good-looking, slightly-built man of about forty,
  who had just come out of a photographer's shop, came over to the car.</p>

  <p>"Bad affair this," he said, "about young Stern. Still, I suppose it was
  only to be expected."</p>

  <p>Davidson introduced us, and Stapleton looked at Ronald with interest.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, Mr. Standish," he said. "Tom Ponsonby, who is a
  distant cousin of mine, is never tired of singing your praises."</p>

  <p>"That's very nice of him," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Have you come down here over this business, or merely to stay with
  Davidson?"</p>

  <p>"A little of both," said Ronald, with a smile. "I hear they've arrested
  Stern."</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how they could avoid it," he replied. "If ever there was an
  obvious case this is it."</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Davidson, I've just had that roll of films developed. Here is
  the last photograph of the poor chap taken an hour and a half before his
  death. Good, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very," said Davidson, passing it to us.</p>

  <p>It showed Yarrow seated on his campstool watching his float. His face was
  in profile; his hat and creel were on the bank beside him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I got it," said Stapleton simply. "It's just the pose I'd like
  to remember him by."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would allow me to keep this," said Ronald "Or perhaps you
  would let me have another print made. My reason is that it helps one to
  visualise the scene in a way that mere imagination can't do."</p>

  <p>"By all manner of means keep it," cried Stapleton. "I can easily have
  another done."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Mr. Stapleton, that you saw no sign of any weapon on the bank
  when you found the body?"</p>

  <p>"It never dawned on me to look for one. I assumed it was a common or
  garden case of drowning. The possibility of foul play never entered my
  head."</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," said Ronald. "It wouldn't."</p>

  <p>We stayed there talking for a few moments; then Stapleton got into his car
  and went off.</p>

  <p>"Have you formed any plan of campaign, Standish?" asked Davidson. "Or do
  you think the thing is too hopeless to worry about?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it," said Ronald.</p>

  <p>Davidson glanced at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you think young Stern has a chance?"</p>

  <p>"I most certainly do," answered Ronald. "But until I've seen one thing I
  can't say more than that."</p>

  <p>"And what is this thing you want to see?" asked Davidson curiously.</p>

  <p>"The dead man's watch," said Ronald. "I take it you can manage that for
  me."</p>

  <p>"I suppose Grayson has it," said Davidson. "It's a vital piece of evidence
  for the prosecution."</p>

  <p>"Or for the defence," remarked Ronald with a faint smile. "However, we'd
  better wait and see."</p>

  <p>"For the defence!" spluttered Davidson. "What on earth are you driving at,
  my dear man?"</p>

  <p>But Ronald refused to elucidate further, or even to discuss the matter
  while we had lunch. But after the meal was over he suggested an immediate
  move.</p>

  <p>"Let's go first to the place where it happened," he said. "And then if
  you'd ring through to him, Davidson, we'll go along and interview Sergeant
  Grayson."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," answered our host. "I'll take you there at once. And I'll
  have the car waiting in the drive so that we'll waste no time."</p>

  <p>He left us to go and telephone, and I tackled Ronald about the watch. But
  he was in one of his uncommunicative moods, and I could get nothing more out
  of him than the illuminating statement that it was damned rum. Then Davidson
  returned and we started for the river.</p>

  <p>"That is where I was when I first saw Stapleton," said our host, pointing
  to a clump of trees in his park. "We've got about another quarter of a mile
  to go."</p>

  <p>We turned into the path that ran along the bank. On our right through the
  bushes which fringed the river we could see the muddy waters of the Ling; on
  our left ran more bushes and a fence.</p>

  <p>"Yarrow's property," remarked Davidson. "You'll be able to see the house
  soon through the trees."</p>

  <p>At length he paused. We had come to a small clearing.</p>

  <p>"Here's the spot," he said. "You can actually see the marks of the legs of
  his campstool in the ground."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded, and stood motionless studying the surroundings. The gap in
  the bushes on the bank measured about ten yards, and the river was some
  thirty yards wide. Behind us the undergrowth was dense. Up and down stream
  the path twisted, so that the place was completely secluded. On the
  right-hand side of the clearing a tree, half waterlogged, stuck out into the
  water, and Davidson pointed to it.</p>

  <p>"It was against that the body had drifted." he said. "The tide was ebbing
  at the time and carried it there."</p>

  <p>Ronald nodded again.</p>

  <p>"I see it's just high tide now," he remarked. "Let's get the depth of the
  water."</p>

  <p>He picked up a long stick and took some soundings.</p>

  <p>"Three or four feet close inshore and a muddy bottom."</p>

  <p>He straightened up and then for nearly half an hour he crept round on his
  hands and knees examining the ground at the bottom of the bushes. He went
  each way along the path, exploring it minutely, while Davidson watched him
  with curiosity tinged with slight impatience. At length he gave it up and
  rejoined us.</p>

  <p>"I can find nothing," he said. "But, of course, the ground is very
  hard."</p>

  <p>"What did you expect to find?" asked Davidson.</p>

  <p>"'Expect' is too strong a word," answered Ronald. "All that can be said is
  that I thought it possible I might."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and we waited.</p>

  <p>"Let us try and size tip the situation," he said. "To start with an
  obvious platitude, either young Stern did it or someone else did. If it was
  young Stern we are wasting our time, because frankly, Davidson, your
  suggestion of manslaughter won't wash. A man who is stunned by a dunt on the
  head sufficient to break a bone lies where he falls. He doesn't wriggle about
  afterwards. Therefore, whoever hit Yarrow saw him fall into the river.</p>

  <p>"So we'll consider the other alternative&mdash;that it was someone else
  who murdered him. Now, from what you have told us Yarrow was an unpopular
  man, so he probably had plenty of enemies. You further stated that fishing
  from this spot was his invariable hobby, a fact which other people must have
  been quite as well aware of as you were. Suppose, then, that this
  hypothetical some one else, desirous of seeing Yarrow, came here knowing that
  he'd find him. Suddenly he hears Yarrow approaching and quarrelling with
  Stern. He hides in the bushes, waits till Stern goes; then seizing his
  opportunity bashes Yarrow on the head and watches him drown."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Davidson. His face expressed polite interest. And I must
  confess that I was a bit disappointed myself. Perhaps I had expected too much
  after such a prolonged examination, but the bald fact remained that an
  intelligent child of ten could have reached the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>"And since," continued Ronald imperturbably, "the betting is four to one
  that that or something like it is what did take place, I thought I might find
  traces of his footprints."</p>

  <p>And now we stared at him: this was a more positive assertion. "How on
  earth can you have arrived at that?" demanded Davidson.</p>

  <p>Ronald smiled.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and see Sergeant Grayson," he said. "And there is only one thing
  more I've got to say at the moment. If my theory is correct we are dealing
  with a very clever man, but one who is not quite clever enough."</p>

  <p>"You'll be telling us you know who it is next," said Davidson, with mild
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"I haven't a notion," said Ronald frankly. "Not the ghost of an idea. But
  it will be something if we can prove it wasn't young Stern."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Grayson was expecting us, and with a genial and tolerant smile he
  produced the watch.</p>

  <p>"I hear you want to see it, sir," he said. "Though what you think you'll
  get from it bar the obvious fact that it stopped at half-past two is beyond
  me."</p>

  <p>"We'll see, Sergeant," said Ronald cheerfully, as he examined it. "By the
  way, it was in his waistcoat pocket, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir: attached to a button-hole by this leather guard."</p>

  <p>The watch was a thin gold one, and the back fitted so tightly that it was
  only with the help of a penknife that Ronald prised it open. And when he had
  done so he sat staring at the works with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"Have you had this open, Sergeant Grayson?" he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have, sir. Why?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think made the watch stop?"</p>

  <p>"Water getting in, sir, of course."</p>

  <p>"Then why is the whole inside bone dry?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant scratched his head. "It's two days ago, sir, you know."</p>

  <p>"Rot, man," cried Ronald. "If enough water had got into that watch to stop
  it, it would still be there after two weeks. It couldn't evaporate."</p>

  <p>He was idly turning the swivel as he spoke, and suddenly a look of keen
  concentration came on his face.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" he almost shouted, "the main spring is broken."</p>

  <p>"Must have happened as Mr. Yarrow fell in," said the sergeant. "So that
  fixes the time exactly."</p>

  <p>"My dear sergeant," remarked Ronald quietly, "I will, if you like, have a
  small bet with you. I will obtain for you a hundred different watches. You
  will go to the bank of the river or any similar spot and fall in a hundred
  times, with a different watch in your waistcoat pocket on each occasion. And
  if one mainspring breaks, I will present you with a bag of nuts."</p>

  <p>"Well, it did this time," said the sergeant stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Grayson," said Ronald, "what makes a mainspring snap? Over-
  winding&mdash;ninety-nine times out of a hundred. Are you going to tell me
  that Mr. Yarrow during a heated interview with young Stern pulled out his
  watch and started to wind it up? It's ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"Not more ridiculous than that someone else did," remarked Davidson.</p>

  <p>"That's just where you're wrong," cried Ronald. "Last night I carried out
  a small experiment. I got into a warm bath wearing a waistcoat&mdash;and
  deuced absurd I looked, too," he added, with a grin. "In my waistcoat pocket
  was a watch. I stopped in the water for twenty minutes, and the watch was
  still going when I got out. It's the point that struck me the instant I heard
  your story, Davidson. This watch stopped too soon. If young Stern had done
  it, a watch that fits as tight as this one would have been still going at
  three."</p>

  <p>No one said a word: we were all too keenly interested. "When I opened the
  back," he continued, "I expected to find it full of water. I was then going
  to suggest that we should have it thoroughly dried and carry out my
  experiment of last night with it. The murderer, however, was evidently unable
  to open it&mdash;you saw the difficulty I had&mdash;and he was in a hurry. So
  instead of filling it with water, he deliberately overwound it, thereby
  breaking the mainspring, and hoped it would not be noticed. Then he set the
  hands at half-past two, and replaced it in Yarrow's pocket."</p>

  <p>"But why should he put them at that hour?" said Grayson.</p>

  <p>"Expressly to incriminate Stern," cried Ronald a little irritably. "That
  surely is obvious."</p>

  <p>But the sergeant had become mulish.</p>

  <p>"Theory&mdash;all theory," he snorted. "You go your way, Mr. Standish, and
  I'll go mine. And when you lay your hands on the man who, having just
  committed a cold-blooded murder, had the nerve to do what you have suggested,
  Mr. Stern will be free within five minutes."</p>

  <p>"It's your funeral, Sergeant," said Ronald quietly. "But I tell you in all
  seriousness that you are barking up the wrong tree. The bit of evidence that
  you think most damning is, in reality, what completely exonerates young
  Stern. Who did it, I don't know; but it wasn't him."</p>

  <p>The trouble of it was that it remained at that. Exhaustive inquiries in
  the neighbourhood failed to reveal the presence of any stranger, and so far
  as the local residents were concerned, it was impossible to single out anyone
  in particular. Moreover, since public opinion was unanimous that Stern was
  the murderer, interest in the case had flagged with his arrest.</p>

  <p>Ronald grew more and more irritable. He spent hours on the river bank
  searching for possible clues without the smallest result. And, at length,
  even he began to give up hope.</p>

  <p>"There absolutely nothing to give one a pointer, Bob," he cried to me in
  despair before lunch one day. "I am as convinced as ever that Stern didn't do
  it, but who the devil did? I feel it's leaving the youngster in the lurch,
  but there doesn't seem much use in our stopping on here. We're doing no
  good."</p>

  <p>And Davidson agreed. Though he pressed us to stay as long as we liked, I
  think, at the bottom of his mind, he had come round to Grayson's opinion,
  that it was just theory. And so we took our departure, though it was like
  getting a dog away from a bone, so far as Ronald was concerned. He had told
  Stern's solicitor to subpoena him as an expert witness, but I knew he felt
  uneasy about the result.</p>

  <p>"Even if he gets off, and I don't think they'll hang him, it's going to be
  a damnable thing for the youngster. If the trial was in Scotland, the utmost
  I should expect would be a verdict of Non Proven. They can't bring that in
  here, but it's what it will practically amount to. Not one person in a
  hundred will believe he is innocent, and he'll be under the stigma for the
  rest of his life."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was the evening before the trial, and I was round with
  him in his rooms. Never have I known him so depressed, and it was not
  difficult to understand. He felt he had failed, and though it was through no
  fault of his, the result was the same. And then, quite suddenly, the most
  amazing change came over his expression.</p>

  <p>"My sainted aunt!" he shouted. "Let me think a moment." I glanced over his
  shoulder: he was studying the snapshot of Yarrow taken by Stapleton.</p>

  <p>"What time was it when you and I and Davidson reached the river that first
  day we were down there?"</p>

  <p>"We left the house at a quarter past three," I said. "So it must I have
  been half-past, as near as makes no odds!'</p>

  <p>"Get Vickers on the 'phone," he cried. "Proof, Bob&mdash;proof under my
  nose all these weeks and I never saw it!"</p>

  <p>Vickers was the K.C. defending Stern, and I got through at once.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm coming round to see him immediately," said Ronald, and
  before I had time to speak he had dashed out, and I heard him shouting for a
  taxi. And that night it was touch and go that I did not find myself arrested
  on a similar charge to young Stern. For the irritating devil would say
  nothing. He kept grinning all over his face and rubbing his hands
  together.</p>

  <p>"Wait till tomorrow, Bob," was all I could get out of him. "And then I can
  promise you the kick of your young life."</p>

  <p>The court was crowded, but through Ronald's influence I got a good seat.
  And a glance at young Stern's face showed that the news, whatever it was, had
  been passed on to him. The atmosphere was tense, as it always is during a
  murder trial, but the prisoner seemed the least concerned person in the
  place. I saw Davidson and Stapleton not far away in the body of the court,
  but Ronald had been given a seat just behind Vickers. And then the trial
  began. Counsel for the Crown outlined the case for the prosecution, and
  though he spoke with studied moderation it was a pretty damning indictment.
  He admitted freely that the case rested on circumstantial evidence, but
  pointed out that ninety per cent. of murder cases did. Then he called his
  first witness&mdash;John Stapleton&mdash;who went into the box and took the
  oath.</p>

  <p>He looked, I thought, strained and pale, but that was not to be wondered
  at. Yarrow had been a friend of his, but apart from that, to be one of the
  principal witnesses when a man's life is at stake is a nerve ordeal. However,
  he gave his evidence in a calm and steady voice, and when Vickers rose to
  cross-examine him, Stapleton gave him a courteous bow.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Stapleton, we have heard that you lunched with Mr. Briggs on the
  day of the murder. What time did you arrive at the house?"</p>

  <p>"Between ten and a quarter-past one."</p>

  <p>"And it is about ten minutes' walk, is it not, from where Mr. Yarrow was
  fishing?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"You therefore left Mr. Yarrow at about one o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Before leaving him, did you take a photograph of him fishing?" Stapleton
  looked surprised, as did everyone else, including the judge; so far the fact
  had not been mentioned.</p>

  <p>"Now you speak of it, I did," said Stapleton. "I'd really forgotten about
  it."</p>

  <p>"But you remember now?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. I had one exposure to complete the roll and I took one of him
  fishing."</p>

  <p>"At about one o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was just before I left him to go to lunch."</p>

  <p>"Is this the photograph you took?"</p>

  <p>Vickers held up the snapshot and Stapleton studied it.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is it."</p>

  <p>"And is that tree that one sees half submerged in the water the one
  against which you found the body?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is."</p>

  <p>Vickers passed the photograph up to the judge.</p>

  <p>"I would ask you to examine it carefully, m'lud. Now, Mr. Stapleton, is
  that tree down-stream or up-stream from the place where Mr. Yarrow was
  fishing?"</p>

  <p>"Down-stream."</p>

  <p>Vickers produced a book and opened it. And suddenly I glanced at
  Stapleton. Ceaselessly he was wetting his lips with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"I have here," continued counsel quietly, "a book which gives the times of
  high and low water for every day of the year in every part of the country.
  Would it surprise you to know, Mr. Stapleton, that on the day Mr. Yarrow was
  murdered, high tide in the River Ling was at one-fifty p.m.?"</p>

  <p>"I will take your word for it," said Stapleton in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, when you took this photograph at one o'clock it was not yet
  high water; the tide was still coming in?"</p>

  <p>"If high water was at one-fifty it must have been."</p>

  <p>"Then why, John Stapleton," cried Vickers in a terrible voice, "is it
  going out in that photograph? You can see the swirl of the water against the
  tree."</p>

  <p>For what seemed an eternity did the man in the box stand there mouthing,
  and one could have heard a pin drop in the court. Then came a sudden shout of
  "Stop him," but it was too late. Stapleton had cheated the hangman. And maybe
  as a point in his favour he confessed before he died.</p>

  <p>"The motive&mdash;who can tell?" said Ronald, as we waited for lunch at
  Davidson's house. "But it was a devilish clever crime, though not quite
  clever enough. Somehow or other Stapleton must have known that Stern and
  Yarrow had had a row. Somehow or other he must have known that Stern left
  Yarrow a little before half-past two. The photograph which sealed his fate
  was probably taken to foster the idea that he and Yarrow were friends. And he
  forgot about high tide. If you remember, Davidson, it was just on the turn
  two days later at three-thirty. Now it gets about fifty minutes later every
  day, so that on the day of the murder high tide was an hour and forty minutes
  earlier&mdash; at one. His one slip. But as to motive..."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and at that moment the butler announced Mr.
  Briggs.</p>

  <p>"Won't keep you a moment, gentlemen," he said, "but there's just one point
  you might like to know. I thought no more about it till the trial today. At
  twenty-past two on the day Mr. Yarrow was murdered, someone rang Stapleton up
  at my house."</p>

  <p>"Who?" said Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Yarrow."</p>
