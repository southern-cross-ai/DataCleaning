<h1>The Ripening Rubies</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Max Pemberton</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>'The plain fact is,' said Lady Faber, 'we are entertaining
thieves. It positively makes me shudder to look at my own guests, and
to think that some of them are criminals.'</p>

<p>We stood together in the conservatory of her house in Portman
Square, looking down upon a brilliant ballroom, upon a glow of
colour, and the radiance of unnumbered gems. She had taken me aside
after the fourth waltz to tell me that her famous belt of rubies had
been shorn of one of its finest pendants; and she showed me beyond
possibility of dispute that the loss was no accident, but another of
those amazing thefts which startled London so frequently during the
season of 1893. Nor was hers the only case. Though I had been in her
house but an hour, complaints from other sources had reached me. The
Countess of Dunholm had lost a crescent brooch of brilliants; Mrs
Kenningham-Hardy had missed a spray of pearls and turquoise; Lady
Hallingham made mention of an emerald locket which was gone, as she
thought, from her necklace; though, as she confessed with a truly
feminine doubt, she was not positive that her maid had given it to
her. And these misfortunes, being capped by the abstraction of Lady
Faber's pendant, compelled me to believe that of all the startling
stories of thefts which the season had known the story of this dance
would be the most remarkable.</p>

<p>These things and many more came to my mind as I held the mutilated
belt in my hand and examined the fracture, while my hostess stood,
with an angry flush upon her face, waiting for my verdict. A moment's
inspection of the bauble revealed to me at once its exceeding value,
and the means whereby a pendant of it had been snatched.</p>

<p>'If you will look closely,' said I, 'you will see that the gold
chain here has been cut with a pair of scissors. As we don't know the
name of the person who used them, we may describe them as
pickpocket's scissors.'</p>

<p>'Which means that I am entertaining a pickpocket,' said she,
flushing again at the thought.</p>

<p>'Or a person in possession of a pickpocket's implements,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>'How dreadful,' she cried, 'not for myself, though the rubies are
very valuable, but for the others. This is the third dance during the
week at which people's jewels have been stolen. When will it
end?'</p>

<p>'The end of it will come,' said I, 'directly that you, and others
with your power to lead, call in the police. It is very evident by
this time that some person is socially engaged in a campaign of
wholesale robbery. While a silly delicacy forbids us to permit our
guests to be suspected or in any way watched, the person we mention
may consider himself in a terrestrial paradise, which is very near
the seventh heaven of delight. He will continue to rob with impunity,
and to offer up his thanks for that generosity of conduct which
refuses us a glimpse of his hat, or even an inspection of the boots
in which he may place his plunder.'</p>

<p>'You speak very lightly of it,' she interrupted, as I still held
her belt in my hands. 'Do you know that my husband values the rubies
in each of those pendants at eight hundred pounds?'</p>

<p>'I can quite believe it,' said I; 'some of them are white as these
are, I presume; but I want you to describe it for me, and as
accurately as your memory will let you.'</p>

<p>'How will that help to its recovery?' she asked, looking at me
questioningly.</p>

<p>'Possibly not at all,' I replied; 'but it might be offered for
sale at my place, and I should be glad if I had the means of
restoring it to you. Stranger things have happened.'</p>

<p>'I believe,' said she sharply, 'you would like to find out the
thief yourself.'</p>

<p>'I should not have the smallest objection,' I exclaimed frankly;
'if these robberies continue, no woman in London will wear real
stones; and I shall be the loser.'</p>

<p>'I have thought of that,' said she; 'but, you know, you are not to
make the slightest attempt to expose any guest in my house; what you
do outside is no concern of mine.'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said I, 'and for the matter of that I am likely to do
very little in either case; we are working against clever heads; and
if my judgment be correct, there is a whole gang to cope with. But
tell me about the rubies.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said she, 'the stolen pendant is in the shape of a rose.
The belt, as you know, was brought by Lord Faber from Burmah. Besides
the ring of rubies, which each drop has, the missing star includes
four yellow stones, which the natives declare are ripening rubies. It
is only a superstition, of course; but the gems are full of fire, and
as brilliant as diamonds.'</p>

<p>'I know the stones well,' said I; 'the Burmese will sell you
rubies of all colours if you will buy them, though the blue variety
is nothing more than the sapphire. And how long is it since you
missed the pendant?'</p>

<p>'Not ten minutes ago,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Which means that your next partner might be the thief?' I
suggested. 'Really, a dance is becoming a capital entertainment.'</p>

<p>'My next partner is my husband,' said she, laughing for the first
time, 'and whatever you do, don't say a word to him. He would never
forgive me for losing the rubies.'</p>

<p>When she was gone, I, who had come to her dance solely in the hope
that a word or a face there would cast light upon the amazing mystery
of the season's thefts, went down again where the press was, and
stood while the dancers were pursuing the dreary paths of a 'square'.
There before me were the hundred types one sees in a London
ball-room&mdash;types of character and of want of character, of age
aping youth, and of youth aping age, of well-dressed women and
ill-dressed women, of dandies and of the bored, of fresh girlhood and
worn maturity. Mixed in the dazzling <i>mel&eacute;e,</i> or swaying
to the rhythm of a music-hall melody, you saw the lean form of boys;
the robust forms of men; the pretty figures of the girls just out;
the figures, not so pretty, of the matrons, who, for the sake of the
picturesque, should long ago have been in. As the picture changed
quickly, and fair faces succeeded to dark faces, and the coquetting
eyes of pretty women passed by with a glance to give place to the
uninteresting eyes of the dancing men, I asked myself what hope would
the astutest spy have of getting a clue to the mysteries in such a
room; how could he look for a moment to name one man or one woman who
had part or lot in the astounding robberies which were the wonder of
the town? Yet I knew that if nothing were done, the sale of jewels in
London would come to the lowest ebb the trade had known, and that I,
personally, should suffer loss to an extent which I did not care to
think about.</p>

<p>I have said often, in jotting down from my book a few of the most
interesting cases which have come to my notice, that I am no
detective, nor do I pretend to the smallest gift of foresight above
my fellow men. Whenever I have busied myself about some trouble it
has been from a personal motive which drove me on, or in the hope of
serving someone who henceforth should serve me. And never have I
brought to my aid other weapon than a certain measure of common
sense. In many instances the purest good chance has given to me my
only clue; the merest accident has set me straight when a hundred
roads lay before me. I had come to Lady Faber's house hoping that the
sight of some stranger, a chance word, or even an impulse might cast
light upon the darkness in which we had walked for many weeks. Yet
the longer I stayed in the ball-room the more futile did the whole
thing seem. Though I knew that a nimble-fingered gentleman might be
at my very elbow, that half-a-dozen others might be dancing
cheerfully about me in that way of life to which their rascality had
called them, I had not so much as a hand-breadth of suspicion; saw no
face that was not the face of the dancing ass, or the smart man about
town; did not observe a single creature who led me to hazard a
question. And so profound at last was my disgust that I elbowed my
way from the ball-room in despair; and went again to the conservatory
where the palms waved seductively, and the flying corks of the
champagne bottles made music harmonious to hear.</p>

<p>There were few people in this room at the moment&mdash;old General
Sharard, who was never yet known to leave a refreshment table until
the supper table was set; the Rev. Arthur Mellbank, the curate of St
Peter's, sipping tea; a lean youth who ate an ice with the relish of
a schoolboy; and the ubiquitous Sibyl Kavanagh, who has been vulgarly
described as a garrison hack. She was a woman of many partialities,
whom every one saw at every dance, and then asked how she got
there&mdash;a woman with sufficient personal attraction left to
remind you that she was <i>pass&eacute;e</i>, and sufficient wit to
make an interval tolerable. I, as a rule, had danced once with her,
and then avoided both her programme and her chatter; but now that I
came suddenly upon her, she cried out with a delicious pretence of
artlessness, and ostentatiously made room for me at her side.</p>

<p>'<i>Do</i> get me another cup of tea,' she said; 'I've been
talking for ten minutes to Colonel Harner, who has just come from the
great thirst land, and I've caught it.'</p>

<p>'You'll ruin your nerves,' said I, as I fetched her the cup, 'and
you'll miss the next dance.'</p>

<p>'I'll sit it out with you,' she cried gushingly; 'and as for
nerves, I haven't got any; I must have shed them with my first teeth.
But I want to talk to you&mdash;you've heard the news, of course!
Isn't it dreadful?'</p>

<p>She said this with a beautiful look of sadness, and for a moment I
did not know to what she referred. Then it dawned upon my mind that
she had heard of Lady Faber's loss.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said I, 'it's the profoundest mystery I have ever
known.'</p>

<p>'And can't you think of any explanation at all?' she asked, as she
drank her tea at a draught. 'Isn't it possible to suspect some one
just to pass the time?'</p>

<p>'If you can suggest any one,' said I, 'we will begin with
pleasure.'</p>

<p>'Well, there's no one in this room to think of, is there?' she
asked with her limpid laugh; 'of course you couldn't search the
curate's pockets, unless sermons were missing instead of rubies?'</p>

<p>'This is a case of "sermons in stones",' I replied, 'and a very
serious case. I wonder you have escaped with all those pretty
brilliants on your sleeves.'</p>

<p>'But I haven't escaped,' she cried; 'why, you're not up to date.
Don't you know that I lost a marquise brooch at the Hayes's dance the
other evening? I have never heard the last of it from my husband, who
will not believe for a minute that I did not lose it in the
crowd.'</p>

<p>'And you yourself believe&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That it was stolen, of course. I pin my brooches too I! well to
lose them&mdash;some one took it in the same cruel way that Lady
Faber's rubies have been taken. Isn't it really awful to think that
at every party we go to thieves go with us? It's enough to make one
emigrate to the shires.'</p>

<p>She fell to the flippant mood again, for nothing could keep her
from that; and as there was obviously nothing to be learnt from her,
I listened to her chatter sufferingly.</p>

<p>'But we were going to suspect people,' she continued suddenly,
'and we have not done it. As we can't begin with the curate, let's
take the slim young man opposite. Hasn't he what Sheridan
calls&mdash;but there, I mustn't say it; you know&mdash;a something
disinheriting countenance?'</p>

<p>'He eats too many jam tarts and drinks too much lemonade to be a
criminal,' I replied; 'besides, he is not occupied, you'll have to
look in the ball-room.'</p>

<p>'I can just see the top of the men's heads,' said she, craning her
neck forward in the effort. 'Have you noticed that when a man is
dancing, either he stargazes in ecstasy, as though he were in heaven,
or looks down to his boots&mdash;well, as if it were the other
thing?'</p>

<p>'Possibly,' said I; 'but you're not going to constitute yourself a
<i>vehmgericht</i> from seeing the top of people's heads.'</p>

<p>'Indeed,' she cried, 'that shows how little you know; there is
more character in the crown of an old man's head than is dreamt of in
your philosophy, as what's-his-name says. Look at that shining roof
bobbing up there, for instance; that is the halo of port and
honesty&mdash;and a difficulty in dancing the polka. Oh! that mine
enemy would dance the polka&mdash;especially if he were stout.'</p>

<p>'Do you really possess an enemy?' I asked, as she fell into a
vulgar burst of laughter at her own humour; but she said:</p>

<p>'Do I possess one? Go and discuss me with the other
women&mdash;that's what I tell all my partners to do; and they come
back and report to me. It's as good as a play!'</p>

<p>'It must be,' said I, 'a complete extravaganza. But your enemy has
finished his exercise, and they are going to play a waltz. Shall I
take you down?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she cried, 'and don't forget to discuss me. Oh, these
crushes!'</p>

<p>She said this as we came to the press upon the corner of the
stairs leading to the ball-room, a corner where she was pushed
desperately against the banisters. The vigour of the polka had sent
an army of dancers to the conservatory, and for some minutes we could
neither descend nor go back; but when the press was somewhat
relieved, and she made an effort to progress, her dress caught in a
spike of the iron-work, and the top of a panel of silk which went
down one side of it was ripped open and left hanging. For a minute
she did not notice the mishap; but as the torn panel of silk fell
away slightly from the more substantial portion of her dress, I
observed, pinned to the inner side of it, a large crescent brooch of
diamonds. In the same instant she turned with indescribable
quickness, and made good the damage. But her face was scarlet in the
flush of its colour; and she looked at me with questioning eyes.</p>

<p>'What a miserable accident,' she said. 'I have spoilt my
gown.'</p>

<p>'Have you?' said I sympathetically, 'I hope it was not my
clumsiness&mdash;but really there doesn't seem much damage done. Did
you tear it in front?'</p>

<p>There was need of very great restraint in saying this. Though I
stood simply palpitating with amazement, and had to make some show of
examining her gown, I knew that even an ill-judged word might undo
the whole good of the amazing discovery, and deprive me of that which
appeared to be one of the most astounding stories of the year. To put
an end to the interview, I asked her laughingly if she would not care
to see one of the maids upstairs; and she jumped at the excuse,
leaving me upon the landing to watch her hurriedly mounting to the
bedroom storey above.</p>

<p>When she was gone, I went back to the conservatory and drank a cup
of tea, always the best promotor of clear thought; and for some ten
minutes I turned the thing over in my mind. Who was Mrs Sibyl
Kavanagh, and why had she sewn a brooch of brilliants to the inside
of a panel of her gown&mdash;sewn it in a place where it was as
safely hid from sight as though buried in the Thames? A child could
have given the answer&mdash;but a child would have overlooked many
things which were vital to the development of the unavoidable
conclusion of the discovery. The brooch that I had seen corresponded
perfectly with the crescent of which Lady Dunholme was
robbed&mdash;yet it was a brooch which a hundred women might have
possessed; and if I had simply stepped down and told Lady Faber, 'the
thief you are entertaining is Mrs Sibyl Kavanagh', a slander action
with damages had trodden upon the heels of the folly. Yet I would
have given a hundred pounds to have been allowed full inspection of
the whole panel of the woman's dress&mdash;and I would have staked an
equal sum that there had been found in it the pendant of the ripening
rubies; a pendant which seemed to me the one certain clue that would
end the series of jewel robberies, and the colossal mystery of the
year. Now, however, the woman had gone upstairs to hide in another
place whatever she had to hide; and for the time it was unlikely that
a sudden searching of her dress would add to my knowledge.</p>

<p>A second cup of tea helped me still further on my path. It made
quite clear to me the fact that the woman was the recipient of the
stolen jewels, rather than the actual taker of them. She, clearly,
could not use the scissors which had severed Lady Faber's pendant
from the ruby belt. A skilful man had in all probability done
that&mdash;but which man, or perhaps men? I had long felt that the
season's robberies were the work of many hands. Chance had now marked
for me one pair; but it was vastly more important to know the others.
The punishment of the woman would scarce stop the widespread
conspiracy; the arrest of her for the possession of a crescent
brooch, hid suspiciously it is true, but a brooch of a pattern which
abounded in every jeweller's shop from Kensington to Temple Bar,
would have been consummate lunacy. Of course, I could have taken cab
to Scotland Yard, and have told my tale; but with no other support,
how far would that have availed me? If the history of the
surpassingly strange case were to be written, I knew that I must
write it, and lose no moment in the work.</p>

<p>I had now got a sufficient grip upon the whole situation to act
decisively, and my first step was to re-enter the ball-room, and take
a partner for the next waltz. We had made some turns before I
discovered that Mrs Kavanagh was again in the room, dancing with her
usual dash, and seemingly in no way moved by the mishap. As we passed
in the press, she even smiled at me, saying, 'I've set full sail
again'; and her whole bearing convinced me of her belief that I had
seen nothing.</p>

<p>At the end of my dance my own partner, a pretty little girl in
pink, left me with the remark, 'You're awfully stupid to-night! I ask
you if you've seen <i>Manon Lescaut,</i> and the only thing you say
is, "The panel buttons up, I thought so".' This convinced me that it
was dangerous to dance again, and I waited in the room only until the
supper was ready, and Mrs Kavanagh passed me, making for the
dining-room, on the arm of General Sharard. I had loitered to see
what jewels she wore upon her dress; and when I had made a note of
them, I slipped from the front door of the house unobserved, and took
a hansom to my place in Bond Street.</p>

<p>At the second ring of the bell my watchman opened the door to me;
and while he stood staring with profound surprise, I walked straight
to one of the jewel cases in which our cheaper jewels are kept, and
took therefrom a spray of diamonds, and hooked it to the inside of my
coat. Then I sent the man up stairs to awaken Abel, and in five
minutes my servant was with me, though he wore only his trousers and
his shirt.</p>

<p>'Abel,' said I, 'there's good news for you. I'm on the path of the
gang we're wanting.'</p>

<p>'Good God, sir!' cried he, 'you don't mean that!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said I, 'there's a woman named Sibyl Kavanagh in it to
begin with, and she's helped herself to a couple of diamond sprays,
and a pendant of rubies at Lady Faber's to-night. One of the sprays I
know she's got; if I could trace the pendant to her, the case would
begin to look complete.'</p>

<p>'Whew!' he ejaculated, brightening up at the prospect of business.
'I knew there was a woman in it all along&mdash;but this one, why,
she's a regular flier, ain't she, sir?'</p>

<p>'We'll find out her history presently. I'm going straight back to
Portman Square now. Follow me in a hansom, and when you get to the
house, wait inside my brougham until I come. But before you do that,
run round to Marlborough Street police-station and ask them if we can
have ten or a dozen men ready to mark a house in Bayswater some time
between this and six o'clock to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>'You're going to follow her home then?'</p>

<p>'Exactly, and if my wits can find a way I'm going to be her guest
for ten minutes after she quits Lady Faber's. They're sure to let you
have the men either at Marlborough Street or at the Harrow Road
station. This business has been a disgrace to them quite long
enough.'</p>

<p>'That's so, sir; King told me yesterday that he'd bury his head in
the sand if something didn't turn up soon. You haven't given me the
exact address though.'</p>

<p>'Because I haven't got it. I only know that the woman lives
somewhere near St Stephen's Church&mdash;she sits under, or on, one
of the curates there. If you can get her address from her coachman,
do so. But go and dress and be in Portman Square at the earliest
possible moment.'</p>

<p>It was now very near one o'clock, indeed the hour struck as I
passed the chapel in Orchard Street; and when I came into the square
I found my own coachman waiting with the brougham at the corner by
Baker Street. I told him, before I entered the house, to expect Abel;
and not by any chance to draw up at Lady Faber's. Then I made my way
quietly to the ball-room and observed Mrs Kavanagh&mdash;I will not
say dancing, but hurling herself through the last figure of the
lancers. It was evident that she did not intend to quit yet awhile;
and I left her to get some supper, choosing a seat near to the door
of the dining-room, so that any one passing must be seen by me. To my
surprise, I had not been in the room ten minutes when she suddenly
appeared in the hall, unattended, and her cloak wrapped round her;
but she passed without perceiving me; and I, waiting until I heard
the hall door close, went out instantly and got my wraps. Many of the
guests had left already, but a few carriages and cabs were in the
square, and a linkman seemed busy in the distribution of unlimited
potations. It occurred to me that if Abel had not got the woman's
address, this man might give it to me, and I put the plain question
to him.</p>

<p>'That lady who just left,' said I, 'did she have a carriage or a
cab ?'</p>

<p>'Oh, you mean Mrs Kevenner,' he answered thickly, 'she's a keb,
she is, allus takes a hansom, sir; 192, Westbourne Park; I don't want
to ask when I see her, sir.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said I,' she has dropped a piece of jewellery in the
hall, and I thought I would drive round and return it to her.'</p>

<p>He looked surprised, at the notion, perhaps, of any one returning
anything found in a London ball-room; but I left him with his
astonishment and entered my carriage. There I found Abel crouching
down under the front seat, and he met me with a piteous plea that the
woman had no coachman, and that he had failed to obtain her
address.</p>

<p>'Never mind that,' said I, as we drove off sharply, 'what did they
say at the station ?'</p>

<p>'They wanted to bring a force of police round, and arrest every
one in the house, sir. I had trouble enough to hold them in, I'm
sure. But I said that we'd sit down and watch if they made any fuss,
and then they gave in. It's agreed now that a dozen men will be at
the Harrow Road station at your call till morning. They've a
wonderful confidence in you, sir.'</p>

<p>'It's a pity they haven't more confidence in themselves&mdash;but
anyway, we are in luck. The woman's address is 192, Westbourne Park,
and I seem to remember that it is a square.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure of it,' said he; 'it's a round square in the shape of an
oblong, and one hundred and ninety two is at the side near Durham
something or other; we can watch it easily from the palings.'</p>

<p>After this, ten minutes' drive brought us to the place, and I
found it as he had said, the 'square' being really a triangle. Number
one hundred and ninety-two was a big house, its outer points gone
much to decay, but lighted on its second and third floors; though so
far as I could see, for the blinds of the drawing-room were up, no
one was moving. This did not deter me, however, and, taking my stand
with Abel at the corner where two great trees gave us perfect
shelter, we waited silently for many minutes, to the astonishment of
the constable upon the beat, with whom I soon settled; and to his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Ah,' said he, 'I knew they was rum 'uns all along; they owe
fourteen pounds for milk, and their butcher ain't paid; young men
going in all night, too&mdash;why, there's one of them there
now.'</p>

<p>I looked through the trees at his word, and saw that he was right.
A youth in an opera hat and a black coat was upon the doorstep of the
house; and as the light of a street lamp fell upon his face, I
recognized him. He was the boy who had eaten of the jam-tarts so
plentifully at Lady Faber's&mdash;the youth with whom Sibyl Kavanagh
had pretended to have no acquaintance when she talked to me in the
conservatory. And at the sight of him, I knew that the moment had
come.</p>

<p>'Abel,' I said, 'it's time you went. Tell the men to bring a short
ladder with them. They'll have to come in by the balcony&mdash;but
only when I make a sign. The signal will be the cracking of the glass
of that lamp you can see upon the table there. Did you bring my
pistol?'</p>

<p>'Would I forget that?' he asked; 'I brought you two, and look out!
for you may want them.'</p>

<p>'I know that,' said I, 'but I depend upon you. Get back at the
earliest possible moment, and don't act until I give the signal. It
will mean that the clue is complete.'</p>

<p>He nodded his head, and disappeared quickly in the direction where
the carriage was; but I went straight up to the house, and knocked
loudly upon the door. To my surprise, it was opened at once by a
thick-set man in livery, who did not appear at all astonished to see
me.</p>

<p>'They're upstairs, sir, will you go up?' said he.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said I, taking him at his word. 'Lead the way.'</p>

<p>This request made him hesitate.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' said he, 'I think I have made a
mistake&mdash;I'll speak to Mrs Kavanagh.'</p>

<p>Before I could answer he had run up the stairs nimbly; but I was
quick after him; and when I came upon the landing, I could see into
the front drawing-room, where there sat the woman herself, a small
and oldish man with long black whiskers, and the youth who had just
come into the room. But the back room which gave off from the other
with folding-doors, was empty; and there was no light in it. All this
I perceived in a momentary glance, for no sooner had the serving-man
spoken to the woman, than she pushed the youth out upon the balcony,
and came hurriedly to the landing, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>'Why, Mr Sutton,' she cried, when she saw me, 'this is a surprise;
I was just going to bed.'</p>

<p>'I was afraid you would have been already gone,' said I with the
simplest smile possible, 'but I found a diamond spray in Lady Faber's
hall just after you had left. The footman said it must be yours, and
as I am going out of town to-morrow, I thought I would risk leaving
it tonight.'</p>

<p>I handed to her as I spoke the spray of diamonds I had taken from
my own show-case in Bond Street; but while she examined it she shot
up at me a quick searching glance from her bright eyes, and her thick
sensual lips were closed hard upon each other. Yet, in the next
instant, she laughed again, and handed me back the jewel.</p>

<p>'I'm indeed very grateful to you,' she exclaimed, 'but I've just
put my spray in its case; you want to give me someone else's
property.'</p>

<p>'Then it isn't yours?' said I, affecting disappointment. 'I'm
really very sorry for having troubled you.'</p>

<p>'It is I that should be sorry for having brought you here,' she
cried. 'Won't you have a brandy and seltzer or something before you
go?'</p>

<p>'Nothing whatever, thanks,' said I. 'Let me apologize again for
having disturbed you&mdash;and wish you "Goodnight".'</p>

<p>She held out her hand to me, seemingly much reassured; and as I
began to descend the stairs, she re-entered the drawing-room for the
purpose, I did not doubt, of getting the man off the balcony. The
substantial lackey was then waiting in the hall to open the door for
me; but I went down very slowly, for in truth the whole of my plan
appeared to have failed; and at that moment I was without the veriest
rag of an idea. My object in coming to the house had been to trace,
and if possible to lay hands upon the woman's associates, taking her,
as I hoped, somewhat by surprise; yet though I had made my chain more
complete, vital links were missing; and I stood no nearer to the
forging of them. That which I had to ask myself, and to answer in the
space of ten seconds, was the question, 'Now, or
to-morrow?'&mdash;whether I should leave the house without effort,
and wait until the gang betrayed itself again; or make some bold
stroke which would end the matter there and then. The latter course
was the one I chose. The morrow, said I, may find these people in
Paris or in Belgium; there never may be such a clue again as that of
the ruby pendant&mdash;there never may be a similar opportunity of
taking at least three of those for whom we had so long hunted. And
with this thought a whole plan of action suddenly leaped up in my
mind; and I acted upon it, silently and swiftly, and with a readiness
which to this day I wonder at.</p>

<p>I now stood at the hall-door, which the lackey held open. One
searching look at the man convinced me that my design was a sound
one. He was obtuse, patronizing&mdash;but probably honest. As we
faced each other I suddenly took the door-handle from him, and banged
the door loudly, remaining in the hall. Then I clapped my pistol to
his head (though for this offence I surmize that a judge might have
given me a month), and I whispered fiercely to him:</p>

<p>'This house is surrounded by police; if you say a word I'll give
you seven years as an accomplice of the woman upstairs, whom we are
going to arrest. When she calls out, answer that I'm gone, and then
come back to me for instructions. If you do as I tell you, you shall
not be charged&mdash;otherwise, you go to jail.'</p>

<p>At this speech the poor wretch paled before me, and shook so that
I could feel the tremor all down the arm of his which I held.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I won't speak, sir,' he gasped. 'I won't, I do assure
you&mdash;to think as I should have served such folk.'</p>

<p>'Then hide me, and be quick about it&mdash;in this room here, it
seems dark. Now run upstairs and say I'm gone.'</p>

<p>I had stepped into a little breakfast-room at the back of the
dining-room, and there had gone unhesitatingly under a round table.
The place was absolutely dark, and was a vantage ground, since I
could see there from the whole of the staircase; but before the
footman could mount the stairs, the woman came half-way down them,
and, looking over the hall, she asked him:</p>

<p>'Is that gentleman gone?'</p>

<p>'Just left, mum,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Then go to bed, and never let me see you admit a stranger like
that again.'</p>

<p>She went up again at this, and he turned to me, asking:</p>

<p>'What shall I do now, sir? I'll do anything if you'll speak for
me, sir; I've got twenty years' kerecter from Lord Walley; to think
as she's a bad 'un&mdash;it's hardly creditable.'</p>

<p>'I shall speak for you,' said I, 'if you do exactly what I tell
you. Are anymore men expected now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, there's two more; the capting and the clergymin, pretty
clergymin he must be, too.'</p>

<p>'Never mind that; wait and let them in. Then go upstairs and turn
the light out on the staircase as if by accident. After that you can
go to bed.'</p>

<p>'Did you say the police was 'ere?' he asked in his hoarse whisper;
and I said:</p>

<p>'Yes, they're everywhere, on the roof, and in the street, and on
the balcony. If there's the least resistance, the house will swarm
with them.'</p>

<p>What he would have said to this I cannot tell, for at that moment
there was another knock upon the front door, and he opened it
instantly. Two men, one in clerical dress, and one, a very powerful
man, in a Newmarket coat, went quickly upstairs, and the butler
followed them. A moment later the gas went out on the stairs; and
there was no sound but the echo of the talk in the front
drawing-room.</p>

<p>The critical moment in my night's work had now come. Taking off my
boots, and putting my revolver at the half-cock, I crawled up the
stairs with the step of a cat, and entered the back drawing-room. One
of the folding doors of this was ajar, so that a false step would
probably have cost me my life&mdash;and I could not possibly tell if
the police were really in the street, or only upon their way. But it
was my good luck that the men talked loudly, and seemed actually to
be disputing. The first thing I observed on looking through the open
door was that the woman had left the four to themselves. Three of
them stood about the table whereon the lamp was; the dumpy man with
the black whiskers sat in his arm-chair. But the most pleasing sight
of all was that of a large piece of cotton-wool spread upon the table
and almost covered with brooches, lockets, and sprays of diamonds;
and to my infinite satisfaction I saw Lady Faber's pendant of rubies
lying conspicuous even amongst the wealth of jewels which the light
showed.</p>

<p>There then was the clue; but how was it to be used? It came to me
suddenly that four consummate rogues such as these would not be
unarmed. Did I step into the room, they might shoot me at the first
sound; and if the police had not come, there would be the end of it.
Had opportunity been permitted to me, I would, undoubtedly, have
waited five or ten minutes to assure myself that Abel was in the
street without. But this was not to be. Even as I debated the point,
a candle's light shone upon the staircase; and in another moment Mrs
Kavanagh herself stood in the doorway watching me. For one instant
she stood, but it served my purpose; and as a scream rose upon her
lips, and I felt my heart thudding against my ribs, I threw open the
folding doors, and deliberately shot down the glass of the lamp which
had cast the aureola of light upon the stolen jewels.</p>

<p>As the glass flew, for my reputation as a pistol shot was not
belied in this critical moment, Mrs Kavanagh ran in a wild fit of
hysterical screaming to her bedroom above&mdash;but the four men
turned with loud cries to the door where they had seen me; and as I
saw them coming, I prayed that Abel might be there. This thought need
not have occurred to me. Scarce had the men taken two steps when the
glass of the balcony windows was burst in with a crash, and the whole
room seemed to fill with police.</p>

<h5>* * *</h5>

<p>I cannot now remember precisely the sentences which were passed
upon the great gang (known to police history as the Westbourne Park
gang) of jewel thieves; but the history of that case is curious
enough to be worthy of mention. The husband of the woman
Kavanagh&mdash;he of the black whiskers&mdash;was a man of the name
of Whyte, formerly a manager in the house of James Thorndike, the
Universal Provider near the Tottenham Court Road. Whyte's business
had been to provide all things needful for dances; and, though it
astonishes me to write it, he had even found dancing men for ladies
whose range of acquaintance was narrow. In the course of business, he
set up for himself eventually; and as he worked, the bright idea came
to him, why not find as guests men who may snap up, in the heat and
the security of the dance, such unconsidered trifles as sprays,
pendants, and lockets. To this end he married, and his wife being a
clever woman who fell in with his idea, she&mdash;under the name of
Kavanagh&mdash;made the acquaintance of a number of youths whose
business it was to dance; and eventually wormed herself into many
good houses. The trial brought to light the extraordinary fact that
no less than twenty-three men and eight women were bound in this
amazing conspiracy, and that Kavanagh acted as the buyer of the
property they stole, giving them a third of the profits, and
swindling them outrageously. He, I believe, is now taking the air at
Portland; and the other young men are finding in the exemplary
exercise of picking oakum, work for idle hands to do.</p>

<p>As for Mrs Kavanagh, she was dramatic to the end of it; and, as I
learnt from King, she insisted on being arrested in bed.</p>
