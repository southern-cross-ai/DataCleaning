<h1>The Assyrian Rejuvenator</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Clifford Ashdown</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>As six o'clock struck the procession of the un-dined began to
stream beneath the electric arcade which graces the entrance to
Cristiani's. The doors swung unceasingly; the mirrors no longer
reflected a mere squadron of tables and erect serviettes; a hum of
conversation now mingled with the clatter of knives and the popping
of corks; and the brisk scurry of waiters' slippers replaced the
stillness of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Although the restaurant had been crowded some time before he
arrived, Mr Romney Pringle had secured his favourite seat opposite
the feminine print after Gainsborough, and in the intervals of
feeding listened to a selection from Mascagni through a convenient
electrophone, price sixpence in the slot. It was a warm night for the
time of year, a muggy spell having succeeded a week of biting
north-east wind, and as the evening wore on the atmosphere grew
somewhat oppressive, more particularly to those who had dined well.
Its effects were not very visible on Pringle, whose complexion (a
small port-wine mark on his right cheek its only blemish) was of that
fairness which imparts to its fortunate possessor the air of youth
until long past forty; especially in a man who shaves clean, and
habitually goes to bed before two in the morning.</p>

<p>As the smoke from Pringle's havana wreathed upwards to an
extractor, his eye fell, not for the first time, upon a diner at the
next table. He was elderly, probably on the wrong side of sixty, but
with his erect figure might easily have claimed a few years' grace,
while the retired soldier spoke in his scrupulous neatness, and in
the trim of a carefully tended moustache. He had finished his dinner
some little time, but remained seated, studying a letter with an
intentness more due to its subject than to its length, which Pringle
could see was by no means excessive. At last, with a gesture almost
equally compounded of weariness and disgust, he rose and was helped
into his overcoat by a waiter, who held the door for him in the
obsequious manner of his kind.</p>

<p>The languid attention which Pringle at first bestowed on his
neighbour had by this time given place to a deeper interest, and as
the swing-doors closed behind the old gentleman, he scarcely
repressed a start, when he saw lying beneath the vacant table the
identical letter which had received such careful study. His first
impulse was to run after the old gentleman and restore the paper, but
by this time he had disappeared, and the waiter being also invisible,
Pringle sat down and read:</p>

<blockquote>'The Assyrian Rejuvenator Co.,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">82, Barbican, E.C. April
5th</span><br>


<p>'Dear Sir&mdash;We regret to hear of the failure of the
"Rejuvenator" in your hands. This is possibly due to your not having
followed the directions for its use sufficiently closely, but I must
point out that we do not guarantee its infallible success. As it is
an expensive preparation, we do not admit the justice of your
contention that our charges are exorbitant. In any case we cannot
entertain your request to return the whole or any part of the fees.
Should you act upon your threat to take proceedings for the recovery
of the same, we must hold your good self responsible for any
publicity which may follow your trial of the preparation.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Yours faithfully,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Henry Jacobs,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Secretary.</span><br>


<p>Lieut.-Col. Sandstream,<br>
272, Piccadilly, W.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To Pringle this businesslike communication hardly seemed to
deserve so much consideration as Colonel Sandstream had given it, but
having read and pondered it over afresh, he walked back to his
chambers in Furnival's Inn.</p>

<p>He lived at No. 33, on the left as you enter from Holborn, and
anyone who, scaling the stone stairs, reached the second floor, might
observe on the entrance to the front set of chambers the legend, 'Mr
Romney Pringle, Literary Agent'. According to high authority, the
reason of being of the literary agent is to act as a buffer between
the ravening publisher and his prey. But although a very fine oak
bureau with capacious pigeon-holes stood conspicuously in Pringle's
sitting-room, it was tenanted by no rolls of MS, or type-written
sheets. Indeed, little or no business appeared to be transacted in
the chambers. The buffer was at present idle, if it could be said to
have ever worked! It was 'resting' to use the theatrical
expression.</p>

<p>Mr Pringle was an early riser, and as nine o'clock chimed the next
morning from the brass lantern-clock which ticked sedately on a
mantel unencumbered by the usual litter of a bachelor's quarters, he
had already spent some time in consideration of last night's
incident, and a further study of the letter had only served
thoroughly to arouse his curiosity, and decided him to investigate
the affair of the mysterious 'Rejuvenator'. Unlocking a cupboard in
the bottom of the bureau, he disclosed a regiment of bottles and
jars. Sprinkling a few drops from one on to a hare's-foot, he
succeeded, with a little friction, in entirely removing the port-wine
mark from his cheek. Then from another phial he saturated a sponge
and rubbed it into his eyebrows, which turned in the process from
their original yellow to a jetty black. From a box of several, he
selected a waxed moustache (that most facile article of disguise),
and having attached it with a few drops of spirit-gum, covered his
scalp with a black wig, which, as is commonly the case, remained an
aggressive fraud in spite of the most assiduous adjustment. Satisfied
with the completeness of his disguise, he sallied out in search of
the offices of the 'Assyrian Rejuvenator', affecting a military
bearing which his slim but tall and straight-backed figure readily
enabled him to assume.</p>

<p>'My name is Parkins&mdash;Major Parkins,' said Pringle, as he
opened the door of a mean-looking room on the second floor of No. 82,
Barbican. He addressed an oleaginous-looking gentleman, whose curly
locks and beard suggested the winged bulls of Nineveh, and who
appeared to be the sole representative of the concern. The latter
bowed politely, and handed him a chair.</p>

<p>'I have been asked,' Pringle continued, 'by a friend who saw your
advertisement to call upon you for some further information.'</p>

<p>Now the subject of rejuvenation being a delicate one, especially
where ladies are concerned, the business of the company was mainly
transacted through the post. So seldom, indeed, did a client desire a
personal interview, that the Assyrian-looking gentleman jumped to the
conclusion that his visitor was interested in quite another
matter.</p>

<p>'Ah yes! You refer to "Pelosia",' he said briskly. 'Allow me to
read you an extract from the prospectus.'</p>

<p>And before Pringle could reply he proceeded to read from a small
leaflet with unctuous elocution:</p>

<p>'Pelosia. The sovereign remedy of Mud has long been used with the
greatest success in the celebrated baths of Schwalbach and
Franzensbad. The proprietors of Pelosia having noted the beneficial
effect which many of the lower animals derive from the consumption of
earth with their food, have been led to investigate the internal uses
of mud. The success which has crowned the treatment of some of the
longest-standing cases of dyspepsia (the disease so characteristic of
this neurotic age), has induced them to admit the world at large to
its benefits. To thoroughly safeguard the public, the proprietors
have secured the sole right to the alluvial deposits of a stream
remote from human habitation, and consequently above any suspicion of
contamination. Careful analysis has shown that the deposit in this
particular locality, consisting of finely divided mineral particles,
practically free from organic admixture, is calculated to give the
most gratifying results. The proprietors are prepared to quote
special terms for public institutions.'</p>

<p>'Many thanks,' said Pringle, as the other momentarily paused for
breath; 'but I think you are under a slight misapprehension. I called
on you with reference to the "Assyrian Rejuvenator". Have I mistaken
the offices?'</p>

<p>'Pray excuse my absurd mistake! I am secretary of the "Assyrian
Rejuvenator Company", who are also the proprietors of "Pelosia".' And
in evident concern he regarded Pringle fixedly.</p>

<p>It was not the first time he had known a diffident person to
assume an interest in the senility of an absent friend, and he
mentally decided that Pringle's waxed moustache, its blue-blackness
speaking loudly of hair-dye, together with the unmistakable wig, were
evidence of the decrepitude for which his new customer presumably
sought the Company's assistance.</p>

<p>'Ours, my dear sir,' he resumed, leaning back in his chair, and
placing the tips of his fingers in apposition&mdash;'Ours is a
world-renowned specific for removing the ravages which time effects
in the human frame. It is a secret which has been handed down for
many generations in the family of the original proprietor. Its
success is frequently remarkable, and its absolute failure is
impossible. It is not a drug, it is not a cosmetic, yet it contains
the properties of both. It is agreeable and soothing to use, and
being best administered during the hours of sleep does not interfere
with the ordinary avocations of every-day life. The price is so
moderate&mdash;ten and sixpence, including the Government
stamp&mdash;that it could only prove remunerative with an enormous
sale. If you&mdash;ah, on behalf of your friend!&mdash;would care to
purchase a bottle, I shall be most happy to explain its
operation.'</p>

<p>Mr Pringle laid a half sovereign and a sixpence on the table, and
the secretary, diving into a large packing-case which stood on one
side, extracted a parcel. This contained a cardboard box adorned with
a representation of Blake's preposterous illustration to 'The Grave',
in which a centenarian on crutches is hobbling into a species of
banker's strongroom with a rocky top, whereon is seated a youth
clothed in nothing, and with an ecstatic expression.</p>

<p>'This,' said Mr Jacobs impressively, 'is the entire apparatus!'
And he opened the box, displaying a moderate-sized phial and a
spirit-lamp with a little tin dish attached. 'On retiring to rest, a
teaspoonful of the contents of the bottle is poured into the
receptacle above the lamp, which is then lighted, and the preparation
being vaporized is inhaled by the patient. It is best to concentrate
the thoughts on some object of beauty whilst the delicious aroma
sooths the patient to sleep.'</p>

<p>'But how does it act?' inquired the Major a trifle
impatiently.</p>

<p>'In this way,' replied the imperturbable secretary. 'Remember that
the appearance of age is largely due to wrinkles; that is to say, to
the skin losing its elasticity and fulness&mdash;so true is it that
beauty is only skin-deep.' Here he laughed gaily. 'The joints grow
stiff from loss of their natural tone, the figure stoops, and the
vital organs decline their functions from the same cause. In a word,
old age is due to a loss of <i>elasticity</i>, and that is the very
property which the "Rejuvenator" imparts to the system, if inhaled
for a few hours daily.'</p>

<p>Mr Pringle diplomatically succeeded in maintaining his gravity
while the merits of the "Rejuvenator" were expounded, and it was not
until he had bidden Mr Jacobs a courteous farewell, and was safely
outside the office, that he allowed the fastening of his moustache to
be disturbed by an expansive grin.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the same evening the housekeeper of the
Barbican offices was returning from market, her thoughts centred on
the savoury piece of fried fish she was carrying home for supper.</p>

<p>'Mrs Smith?' said a man's voice behind her, as she produced her
latch-key.</p>

<p>'My name's 'Odges,' she replied unguardedly, dropping the key in
her agitation.</p>

<p>'You're the housekeeper, aren't you?' said the stranger, picking
up the key and handing it to her politely.</p>

<p>'Lor', sir! You did give me a turn,' she faltered.</p>

<p>'Very sorry, I'm sure. I only want to know where I can find Mr
Jacobs, of the "Assyrian Rejuvenator Company".'</p>

<p>'Well, sir, he told me I wasn't to give his address to anyone. Not
that I know it either, sir, for I always send the letters to Mr
Weeks.'</p>

<p>'I'll see you're not found fault with. I know he won't mind your
telling me.' A sovereign clinked against the latch-key in her
palm.</p>

<p>For a second she hesitated, then her eye caught the glint of the
gold, and she fell.</p>

<p>'All I know, sir, is that when Mr Jacobs is away I send the
letters&mdash;and a rare lot there are&mdash;to Mr Newton Weeks, at
the Northumberland Avenue Hotel.'</p>

<p>'Is he one of the firm?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, sir, but there's no one comes here but Mr
Jacobs.'</p>

<p>'Thank you very much, and good night,' said the stranger; and he
strode down Barbican, leaving Mrs Hodges staring at the coin in her
hand as if doubting whether, like fairy gold, it might not disappear
even as she gazed.</p>

<p>The next day Mr Jacobs received a letter at his hotel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="margin-left: 28.5em;">'April 7th</span><br>
</p>

<p>'Sir&mdash;My friend Col. Sandstream informs me he has
communicated with the police, and has sworn an information against
you in respect of the moneys you have obtained from him, as he
alleges, by false pretences. Although I am convinced that his
statements are true, a fact which I can more readily grasp after my
interview with you today, I give you this warning in order that you
may make your escape before it is too late. Do not misunderstand my
motives; I have not the slightest desire to save you from the
punishment you so richly deserve. I am simply anxious to rescue my
old friend from the ridiculous position he will occupy before the
world should he prosecute you.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Your obedient
servant,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Joseph Parkins, Major.</span><br>
Newton Weeks, Esq.,<br>
Northumberland Avenue Hotel.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr Jacobs read this declaration of war with very mixed
feelings.</p>

<p>So his visitor of yesterday was the friend of Colonel Sandstream!
Obviously come to get up evidence against him. Knowing old dog, that
Sandstream! But then how had they run him to earth? That looked as if
the police had got their fingers in the pie. Mrs Hodges was discreet.
She would never have given the address to any but the police. It was
annoying, though, after all his precautions; seemed as if the game
was really up at last. Well, it was bound to come some day, and he
had been in tighter places before. He could hardly complain; the
'Rejuvenator' had been going very well lately. But suppose the whole
thing was a plant&mdash;a dodge to intimidate him?</p>

<p>He read the letter through again. The writer had been careful to
omit his address, but it seemed plausible enough on the face of it.
Anyhow, whatever the major's real motive might be, he couldn't afford
to neglect the warning, and the one clear thing was that London was
an unhealthy place for him just at present. He would pack up, so as
to be ready for all emergencies, and drive round to Barbican and
reconnoitre. Then, if things looked fishy, he could go to Cannon
Street and catch the 11.5 Continental. He'd show them that Harry
Jacobs wasn't the man to be bluffed out of his claim!</p>

<p>Mr Jacobs stopped his cab some doors from the "Rejuvenator"
office, and was in the act of alighting when he paused, spellbound at
the apparition of Pringle. The latter was loitering outside No. 82,
and as the cab drew up he ostentatiously consulted a large
pocket-book, and glanced several times from its pages to the
countenance of his victim as if comparing a description. Attired in a
long overcoat, a bowler hat, and wearing thick boots of a
constabulary pattern to the nervous imagination of Mr Jacobs, he
afforded startling evidence of the police interest in the
establishment; and this idea was confirmed when Pringle, as if
satisfied with his scrutiny, drew a paper from the pocket-book and
made a movement in his direction. Without waiting for further
developments, Mr Jacobs retreated into the cab and hoarsely whispered
through the trap-door, 'Cannon Street as hard as you can go!'</p>

<p>The cabman wrenched the horse's head round. He had been an
interested spectator of the scene, and sympathised with the evident
desire of his fare to escape what appeared to be the long arm of the
law. At this moment a 'crawling' hansom came up, and was promptly
hailed by Pringle.</p>

<p>'Follow that cab and don't lose it on any account!' he cried, as
he stood on the step and pointed vigorously after the receding
hansom.</p>

<p>While Mr Jacobs careered down Barbican, his cabman looked back in
time to observe this expressive pantomime, and with the instinct of a
true sportsman lashed the unfortunate brute into a hand-gallop. But
the observant eye of a policeman checked this moderate exhibition of
speed just as they were rounding the sharp corner into Aldersgate
Street, and had not a lumbering railway van intervened Pringle would
have caught him up and brought the farce to an awkward finish. But
the van saved the situation. The moment's respite was all that the
chase needed, and in response to the promises of largesse,
frantically roared by Mr Jacobs through the trap-door, he was soon
bounding and bumping over the wood pavement with Pringle well in the
rear.</p>

<p>Then ensued a mad stampede down Aldersgate Street.</p>

<p>In and out, between the crowded files of vans and 'buses, the two
cabs wound a zig-zag course; the horses slipping and skating over the
greasy surface, or ploughing up the mud as their bits skidded them
within inches of a collision. In vain did policemen roar to them to
stop&mdash;the order fell on heedless ears. In vain did officious
boys wave intimidating arms, or make futile grabs at the harness of
the apparent runaways. Did a cart dart unexpectedly from out a side
street, the inevitable disaster failed to come off. Did an obstacle
loom dead ahead of them, it melted into thin air as they approached.
Triumphantly they piloted the narrowest of straits, and dashed
unscathed into St Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

<p>There was a block in Newgate Street, and the cross traffic was
stopped. Mr Jacobs' hansom nipped through a temporary gap, grazing
the pole of an omnibus, and being lustily anathematised in the
process. But Pringle's cabman, attempting to follow, was imperiously
waved back by a policeman.</p>

<p>'No go, I'm afraid, sir!' was the man's comment, as they crossed
into St Paul's Churchyard after a three minutes' wait. 'I can't see
him nowhere.'</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Pringle cheerfully. 'Go to Charing Cross
telegraph office.'</p>

<p>There he sent the following message:</p>

<p>'To Mrs Hodges, 82, Barbican. Called away to country. Mr Weeks
will take charge of office&mdash;Jacobs.'</p>

<p>About two the same afternoon, Pringle, wearing the wig and
moustache of Major Parkins, rang the housekeeper's bell at 82.</p>

<p>'I'm Mr Weeks,' he stated, as Mrs Hodges emerged from the bowels
of the earth. 'Mr Jacobs has had to leave town, and has asked me to
take charge of the office.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, sir! I've had a telegram from Mr Jacobs to say so. You
know the way up, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'I think so. But Mr Jacobs forgot to send me the office key.'</p>

<p>'I'd better lend you mine, then, sir, till you can hear from Mr
Jacobs.' She fumbled in her voluminous pocket. 'I hope nothing's the
matter with him?'</p>

<p>'Oh dear no! He found he needed a short holiday, that's all,'
Pringle reassured her, and taking the key from the confiding woman he
climbed to the second floor.</p>

<p>Sitting down at the secretarial desk, he sent a quick glance round
the office. A poor creature, that Jacobs, he reflected, for all his
rascality, or he wouldn't have been scared so easily. And he drew a
piece of wax from his pocket and took a careful impression of the
key.</p>

<p>He had not been in possession of the 'Rejuvenator' offices for
very long before he discovered that Mr Jacobs' desire to break out in
a fresh place had proved abortive. It will be remembered that on the
occasion of his interview with that gentleman, Mr Jacobs assumed that
Pringle's visit had reference to 'Pelosia', whose virtues he extolled
in a leaflet composed in his own very pronounced style. A large
package in the office Pringle found to contain many thousands of
these effusions, which had apparently been laid aside for some
considerable time. From the absence in the daily correspondence of
any inquiries thereafter, it was clear that the public had failed to
realize the advantages of the internal administration of mud, so that
Mr Jacobs had been forced to stick to the swindle that was already in
existence. After all, the latter was a paying concern&mdash;eminently
so! Besides, the patent-medicine trade is rather overdone.</p>

<p>The price of the 'Assyrian Rejuvenator' was such as to render the
early cashing of remittances an easy matter. Ten-and-sixpence being a
sum for which the average banker demurs to honour a cheque, the
payments were usually made in postal orders; and Pringle acquired a
larger faith in Carlyle's opinion of the majority of his
fellow-creatures as he cashed the previous day's takings at the
General Post Office on his way up to Barbican each morning. The
business was indeed a flourishing one, and his satisfaction was only
alloyed by the probability of some legal interference, at the
instance of Colonel Sandstream, with the further operations of the
Company. But for the present Fortune smiled, and Pringle continued
energetically to despatch parcels of the 'Rejuvenator' in response to
the daily shower of postal orders. In this indeed he had little
trouble, for he had found many gross of parcels duly packed and ready
for posting.</p>

<p>One day while engaged in the process, which had grown quite a
mechanical one by that time, he listened absently to a slow but
determined step which ascended the stairs and paused on the landing
outside. Above, on the third floor, was an importer of cigars made in
Germany, and the visitor evidently delayed the further climb until he
had regained his wind. Presently, after a preliminary pant or two, he
got under weigh again, but proceeded only as far as the 'Rejuvenator'
door, to which he gave a peremptory thump, and, opening it, walked in
without further ceremony.</p>

<p>There was no need for him to announce himself. Pringle recognized
him at first glance, although he had never seen him since the
eventful evening at Cristiani's restaurant.</p>

<p>'I'm Colonel Sandstream!' he growled, looking round him
savagely.</p>

<p>'Delighted to see you, sir,' said Pringle with assurance. 'Pray be
seated,' he added politely.</p>

<p>'Who am I speaking to?'</p>

<p>'My name is Newton Weeks. I am&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I don't want to see <i>you!</i>' interrupted the Colonel testily.
'I want to see the secretary of this concern. I've no time to waste
either.'</p>

<p>'I regret to say that Mr Jacobs&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes! That's the name. Where is he?' again interrupted the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>'Mr Jacobs is at present out of town.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm not going to run after him. When will he be here
again?'</p>

<p>'It is quite impossible for me to tell. But I was just now going
to say that as the managing director of the company I am also acting
as secretary during Mr Jacobs' absence.'</p>

<p>'What do you say your name is?' demanded the other, still ignoring
the chair which Pringle had offered him.</p>

<p>'Newton Weeks.'</p>

<p>'Newton Weeks,' repeated the Colonel, making a note of the name on
the back of an envelope.</p>

<p>'Managing director,' added Pringle suavely.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr Weeks, if you represent the <i>company</i>&mdash;' this
with a contemptuous glance from the middle of the room at his
surroundings&mdash;'I've called with reference to a letter you've had
the impertinence to send me.'</p>

<p>'What was the date of it?' inquired Pringle innocently.</p>

<p>'I don't remember!' snapped the Colonel.</p>

<p>'May I ask what was the subject of the correspondence?'</p>

<p>'Why, this confounded "Rejuvenator" of yours, of course!'</p>

<p>'You see we have a very large amount of correspondence concerning
the "Rejuvenator", and I'm afraid unless you have the letter with
you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I've lost it or mislaid it somewhere.'</p>

<p>'That is unfortunate! Unless you can remember the contents I fear
it will be quite impossible for <i>me</i> to do so.'</p>

<p>'I remember them well enough! I'm not likely to forget them in a
hurry. I asked you to return me the money your "Rejuvenator", as you
call it, has cost me, because it's been quite useless, and in your
reply you not only refused absolutely, but hinted that I dare not
prosecute you.'</p>

<p>As Pringle made no reply, he continued more savagely: 'Would you
like to hear my candid opinion of you?'</p>

<p>'We are always pleased to hear the opinion of our clients.'</p>

<p>Pringle's calmness only appeared to exasperate the Colonel the
more.</p>

<p>'Well, sir, you shall have it. I consider that letter the most
impudent attempt at blackmail that I have ever heard of!' He ground
out the words from between his clenched teeth in a voice of
concentrated passion.</p>

<p>'Blackmail!' echoed Pringle, allowing an expression of horror to
occupy his countenance.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir! Blackmail!' asseverated the Colonel, nodding his head
vigorously.</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Pringle, with a deprecating gesture, 'I am aware
that some correspondence has passed between us, but I cannot attempt
to remember every word of it. At the same time, although you are
pleased to put such an unfortunate construction upon it, I am sure
there is some misunderstanding in the matter. I must positively
decline to admit that there has been any attempt on the part of the
company of such a nature as you allege.'</p>

<p>'Oh! so you don't admit it, don't you? Perhaps you won't admit
taking pounds and pounds of my money for your absurd concoction,
which hasn't done me the least little bit of good in the
world&mdash;nor ever will! And perhaps you won't admit refusing to
return me my money? Eh? Perhaps you won't admit daring me to take
proceedings because it would show up what an ass I've been! Don't
talk to me, sir! Haugh!'</p>

<p>'I'm really very sorry that this unpleasantness has arisen,' began
Pringle, 'but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Pleasant or unpleasant, sir, I'm going to stop your little game!
I mislaid your letter or I'd have called upon you before this. As
you're the managing director I'm better pleased to see you than your
precious secretary. Anyhow, I've come to tell you that you're a set
of swindlers! Of swindlers, sir!'</p>

<p>'I can make every allowance for your feelings,' said Pringle,
drawing himself up with an air of pained dignity, 'but I regret to
see a holder of His Majesty's commission so deficient in
self-control.'</p>

<p>'Like your impertinence, sir!' vociferated the veteran. 'I'll let
the money go, and I'll prosecute the pair of you, no matter what it
costs me! Yes, you, and your rascally secretary too! I'll go and
swear an information against you this very day!' He bounced out of
the room, and explosively snorted downstairs.</p>

<p>Pringle followed in the rear, and reached the outer door in time
to hear him exclaim, 'Mansion House Police Court,' to the driver of a
motor-cab, in which he appropriately clanked and rumbled out of
sight.</p>

<p>Returning upstairs, Pringle busied himself in making a bonfire of
the last few days' correspondence. Then, collecting the last batch of
postal orders, he proceeded to cash them at the General Post Office,
and walked back to Furnival's Inn. After all, the farce couldn't have
lasted much longer.</p>

<p>Arrived at Furnival's Inn, Pringle rapidly divested himself of the
wig and moustache, and, assuming his official port-wine mark, became
once more the unemployed literary agent.</p>

<p>It was now half-past one, and, after lunching lightly at a near
restaurant, he lighted a cigar and strolled leisurely eastward.</p>

<p>By the time he reached Barbican three o'clock was reverberating
from St Paul's. He entered the private bar of a tavern nearly
opposite, and sat down by a window which commanded a view of No.
82.</p>

<p>As time passed and the quarters continued to strike in rapid
succession, Pringle felt constrained to order further refreshment;
and he was lighting a third cigar before his patience was rewarded.
Happening to glance up at the second floor window, he caught a
glimpse of a strange man engaged in taking a momentary survey of the
street below.</p>

<p>The march of events had been rapid. He had evidently resigned the
secretaryship not a moment too soon!</p>

<p>Not long after the strange face had disappeared from the window, a
four-wheeled cab stopped outside the tavern, and an individual
wearing a pair of large blue spectacles, and carrying a Gladstone
bag, got out and carefully scrutinized the offices of the
'Rejuvenator'. Mr Jacobs, for it was he, did not intend to be caught
napping this time.</p>

<p>At length, being satisfied with the normal appearance of the
premises, he crossed the road, and to Pringle's intense amusement,
disappeared into the house opposite. The spectator had not long to
wait for the next act of the drama.</p>

<p>About ten minutes after Mr Jacobs' disappearance, the man who had
looked out of the window emerged from the house and beckoned to the
waiting cab. As it drew up at the door, a second individual came down
the steps, fast-holding Mr Jacobs by the arm. The latter, in very
crestfallen guise, re-entered the vehicle, being closely followed by
his captor; and the first man having taken his seat with them, the
party adjourned to a destination as to which Pringle had no
difficulty in hazarding a guess. Satisfying the barmaid, he sallied
into the street. The 'Rejuvenator' offices seemed once more to be
deserted, and the postman entered in the course of his afternoon
round. Pringle walked a few yards up the street and then, crossing as
the postman re-appeared, turned back and entered the house boldly.
Softly mounting the stairs, he knocked at the door. There was no
response. He knocked again more loudly, and finally turned the
handle. As he expected, it was locked securely, and, satisfied that
the coast was clear, he inserted his own replica of the key and
entered. The books tumbled on the floor in confused heaps, the
wide-open and empty drawers, and the overturned packing-cases, showed
how thoroughly the place had been ransacked in the search for
compromising evidence. But Pringle took no further interest in these
things. The letter-box was the sole object of his attention. He tore
open the batch of newly-delivered letters, and crammed the postal
orders into his pockets; then, secreting the correspondence behind a
rifled packing-case, he silently locked the door.</p>

<p>As he strolled down the street, on a last visit to the General
Post Office, the two detectives passed him on their way back in quest
of the 'Managing Director'.</p>
