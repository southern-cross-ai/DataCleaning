  <p class="first">IT happened three winters ago. Having just returned from
  Stuttgart, where I had spent some weeks at the Marquardt in the guise I so
  often assumed, that of Monsieur Gustav Dreux, commercial traveller, of Paris,
  and where I had been engaged in watching the movements of two persons staying
  in the hotel, a man and a woman, I was glad to be back again in Bloomsbury to
  enjoy the ease of my armchair and pipe.</p>

  <p>I was much gratified that I had concluded a very difficult piece of
  espionage, and having obtained the information I sought, had been able to
  place certain facts before my Chief, the Marquess of Macclesfield, which had
  very materially strengthened his hands in some very delicate diplomatic
  negotiations with Germany. Perhaps the most exacting position in the whole of
  British diplomacy is the post of Ambassador at Berlin, for the Germans are at
  once our foes, as well as our friends, and are at this moment only too ready
  to pick a quarrel with us from motives of jealousy which may have serious
  results.</p>

  <p>The war cloud was still hovering over Europe; hence a swarm of spies, male
  and female, were plotting, scheming, and working in secret in our very midst.
  The reader would be amazed if he could but glance at a certain red-bound
  book, kept under lock and key at the Foreign Office, in which are registered
  the names, personal descriptions and other facts concerning all the known
  foreign spies living in London and in other towns in England.</p>

  <p>But active as are the agents of our enemies, so also are we active in the
  opposition camp. Our Empire has such tremendous responsibilities that we
  cannot now depend upon mere birth, wealth and honest dealing, but must call
  in shrewdness, tact, subterfuge and the employment of secret agents in order
  to combat the plots of those ever seeking to accomplish England's
  overthrow.</p>

  <p>Careful student of international affairs that I was, I knew that trouble
  was brewing in China. Certain confidential despatches from our Minister in
  Pekin had been shown to me by the Marquess, who, on occasion, flattered me by
  placing implicit trust in me, and from them I gathered that Russia was at
  work in secret to undermine our influence in the Far East.</p>

  <p>I knew that the grave, kindly old statesman was greatly perturbed by the
  grim shadows that were slowly rising, but when we consulted on the day after
  my return from Stuttgart, his lordship was of opinion that at present I had
  not sufficient ground upon which to institute inquiries.</p>

  <p>'For the present, Drew,' he said, 'we must watch and wait. There is war in
  the air&mdash;first at Pekin, and then in Europe. But we must prevent it at
  all costs. Huntley leaves for Pekin tonight with despatches in which I have
  fully explained the line which Sir Henry is to follow. Hold yourself in
  readiness, for you may have to return to Germany or Russia tomorrow. We
  cannot afford to remain long in the dark. We must crush any alliance between
  Petersburg and Berlin.'</p>

  <p>'A telegram to my rooms will bring me to your lordship at any moment,' was
  my answer.</p>

  <p>'Ready to go anywhere&mdash;eh, Drew?' he smiled; and then, after a
  further chat, I left Downing Street and returned to Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p>Knowing that for at least a week or two I should be free, I left my
  address with Boyd, and went down to Cotterstock, in Northamptonshire, to stay
  with my old friend of college days, George Hamilton, who rented a hunting-box
  and rode with the Fitzwilliam Pack.</p>

  <p>I had had a long-standing engagement with him to go down and get a few
  runs with the hounds, but my constant absence abroad had always prevented it
  until then. Of course none of my friends knew my real position at the Foreign
  Office. I was believed to be an attaché.</p>

  <p>Personally, I am extremely fond of riding to hounds, therefore, when that
  night I sat at dinner with George, his wife, and the latter's cousin,
  Beatrice Graham, I was full of expectation of some good runs. An English
  country house, with its old oak, old silver and air of solidity, is always
  delightful to me after the flimsy gimcracks of Continental life. The evening
  proved a very pleasant one. Never having met Beatrice Graham before, I was
  much attracted by her striking beauty. She was tall and dark, about
  twenty-two, with a remarkable figure which was shown to advantage by her
  dinner-gown of turquoise blue. So well did she talk, so splendidly did she
  sing Dupont's 'Jeune Fille', and so enthusiastic was she regarding hunting,
  that, before I had been an hour with her, I found myself thoroughly
  entranced.</p>

  <p>The meet, three days afterwards, was at Wansford, that old-time hunting
  centre by the Nene, about six miles distant, and as I rode at her side along
  the road through historic Fotheringhay and Nassington, I noticed what a
  splendid horsewoman she was. Her dark hair was coiled tightly behind, and her
  bowler hat suited her face admirably while her habit fitted as though it had
  been moulded to her figure. In her mare's tail was a tiny piece of scarlet
  silk to warn others that she was a kicker.</p>

  <p>At Wansford, opposite the old Haycock, once a hunting inn in the old
  coaching days, but now Lord Chesham's hunting-box, the gathering was a large
  one. From the great rambling old house servants carried glasses of sloe gin
  to all who cared to partake of his lordship's hospitality, while every moment
  the meet grew larger and the crowd of horses and vehicles more congested.</p>

  <p>George had crossed to chat with the Master, Mr George Fitzwilliam, who had
  just driven up and was still in his overcoat, therefore I found myself alone
  with my handsome companion, who appeared to be most popular everywhere.
  Dozens of men and women rode up to her and exchanged greetings, the men more
  especially, until at last Barnard, the huntsman, drew his hounds together,
  the word was given, and they went leisurely up the hill to draw the first
  cover.</p>

  <p>The morning was one of those damp cold ones of mid-February; the frost had
  given and everyone expected a good run, for the scent would be excellent.
  Riding side by side with my fair companion, we chatted and laughed as we went
  along, until, on reaching the cover, we drew up with the others and halted
  while hounds went in.</p>

  <p>The first cover was, however, drawn blank, but from the second a fox went
  away straight for Elton, and soon the hounds were in full cry after him and
  we followed at a gallop. After a couple of miles more than half the field was
  left behind, still we kept on, until of a sudden, and without effort, my
  companion took a high hedge and was cutting across the pastures ere I knew
  that she had left the road. That she was a straight rider I at once saw, and
  I must confess that I preferred the gate to the hedge and ditch which she had
  taken so easily.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the kill took place near Haddon Hall, and of the half
  dozen in at the death Beatrice Graham was one.</p>

  <p>When I rode up, five minutes afterwards, she smiled at me. Her face was a
  trifle flushed by hard riding, yet her hair was in no way awry, and she
  declared that she had thoroughly enjoyed that tearing gallop.</p>

  <p>Just, however, as we sat watching Barnard cut off the brush, a tall,
  rather good-looking man rode up, having apparently been left just as I had.
  As he approached I noticed that he gave my pretty friend a strange look,
  almost as of warning, while she on her part, refrained from acknowledging
  him. It was as though he had made her some secret sign which she had
  understood.</p>

  <p>But there was a further fact that puzzled me greatly. I had recognized in
  that well-turned-out hunting man someone whom I had had distinct occasion to
  recollect. At first I failed to recall the man's identity, but when I did, a
  few moments later, I sat regarding his retreating figure like one in a dream.
  The horseman who rode with such military bearing was none other than the
  renowned spy, one of the cleverest secret agents in the world, Otto
  Krempelstein, Chief of the German Secret Service.</p>

  <p>That my charming little friend knew him was apparent. The slightest quiver
  in his eyelids and the almost imperceptible curl of his lip had not passed me
  unnoticed. There was some secret between them, of what nature I, of course,
  knew not. But all through that day my eyes were ever open to re-discover the
  man whose ingenuity and cunning had so often been in competition with my own.
  Twice I saw him again, once riding with a big, dark-haired man in pink, on a
  splendid bay and followed by a groom with a second horse, and on the second
  occasion, at the edge of Stockhill Wood while we were waiting together he
  galloped past us, but without the slightest look of recognition.</p>

  <p>'I wonder who that man is?' I remarked casually, as soon as he was out of
  hearing.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' was her prompt reply. 'He's often out with the
  hounds&mdash;a foreigner, I believe. Probably he's one of those who come to
  England for the hunting season. Since the late Empress of Austria came here
  to hunt, the Fitzwilliam has always been a favourite pack with the
  foreigners.'</p>

  <p>I saw that she did not intend to admit that she had any knowledge of him.
  Like all women, she was a clever diplomatist. But he had made a sign to
  her&mdash;a sign of secrecy.</p>

  <p>Did Krempelstein recognize me, I wondered? I could not think so, because
  we had never met face to face. He had once been pointed out to me in the
  Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin by one of our secret agents who knew him, and his
  features had ever since been graven on my memory.</p>

  <p>That night, when I sat alone with my friend George, I learned from him
  that Mr Graham, his wife's uncle, had lived a long time on the Continent as
  manager to a large commercial firm, and that Beatrice had been born in France
  and had lived there a good many years. I made inquiries regarding the
  foreigners who were hunting that season with the Fitzwilliam, but he, with an
  Englishman's prejudice, declared that he knew none of them, and didn't want
  to know them.</p>

  <p>The days passed and we went to several meets together&mdash;at Apethorpe,
  at Castor Hanglands, at Laxton Park and other places, but I saw no more of
  Krempelstein. His distinguished-looking friend, however, I met on several
  occasions, and discovered that his name was Baron Stern, a wealthy Viennese,
  who had taken a hunting-box near Stoke Doyle, and had as friend a young man
  named Percival, who was frequently out with the hounds.</p>

  <p>But the discovery there of Krempelstein had thoroughly aroused my
  curiosity. He had been there for some distinct purpose, without a doubt.
  Therefore I made inquiry of Kersch, one of our secret agents in Berlin, a man
  employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from him received word that
  Krempelstein was back in Berlin, and further warning me that something
  unusual was on foot in England. This aroused me at once to activity. I knew
  that Krempelstein and his agents were ever endeavouring to obtain the secrets
  of our guns, our ships, and our diplomacy with other nations, and I therefore
  determined that on this occasion he should not succeed. However much I
  admired Beatrice Graham, I now knew that she had lied to me, and that she was
  in all probability his associate. So I watched her carefully, and when she
  went out for a stroll or a ride, as she often did, I followed her.</p>

  <p>How far I was justified in this action does not concern me. I had quite
  unexpectedly alighted upon certain suspicious facts, and was determined to
  elucidate them. The only stranger she met was Percival. Late one afternoon,
  just as dusk was deepening into night, she pulled up her mare beneath the
  bare black trees while crossing Burghley Park, and after a few minutes was
  joined by the young foreigner, who, having greeted her, chatted for a long
  time in a low, earnest tone, as though giving her directions. She seemed to
  remonstrate with him, but at the place I was concealed I was unable to
  distinguish what was said. I saw him, however, hand her something, and then,
  raising his hat, he turned his horse and galloped away down the avenue in the
  opposite direction.</p>

  <p>I did not meet her again until I sat beside her at the dinner-table that
  night, and then I noticed how pale and anxious she was, entirely changed from
  her usual sweet, light-hearted self.</p>

  <p>She told me that she had ridden into Stamford for exercise, but told me
  nothing of the clandestine meeting. How I longed to know what the young
  foreigner had given her. Whatever it was, she kept it a close secret to
  herself.</p>

  <p>More than once I felt impelled to go to her room in her absence and search
  her cupboards, drawers and travelling trunks. My attitude towards her was
  that of a man fallen entirely in love, for I had discovered that she was
  easily flattered by a little attention.</p>

  <p>I was searching for some excuse to know Baron Stern, but often for a week
  he never went to the meets. It was as though he purposely avoided me. He was
  still at Weldon Lodge, near Stoke Doyle, for George told me that he had met
  him in Oundle only two days before.</p>

  <p>Three whole weeks went by, and I remained just as puzzled as ever.
  Beatrice Graham was, after all, a most delightful companion, and although she
  was to me a mystery, yet we had become excellent friends.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, just as I entered the drawing-room where she stood alone,
  she hurriedly tore up a note, and threw the pieces on the great log fire. I
  noticed one tiny piece about an inch square remained unconsumed, and managed,
  half an hour later, to get possession of it.</p>

  <p>The writing upon it was, I found, in German, four words in all, which,
  without context, conveyed to me no meaning.</p>

  <p>On the following night Mrs Hamilton and Beatrice remained with us in the
  smoking-room till nearly eleven o'clock, and at midnight I bade my host good
  night, and ascended the stairs to retire. I had been in my room about half an
  hour when I heard stealthy footsteps. In an instant the truth flashed upon
  me. It was Beatrice on her way downstairs.</p>

  <p>Quickly I slipped on some things and noiselessly followed my pretty
  fellow-guest through the drawing-room out across the lawn and into the lane
  beyond. White mists had risen from the river, and the low roaring of the weir
  prevented her hearing my footsteps behind her. Fearing lest I should lose her
  I kept close behind, following her across several grass fields until she came
  to Southwick Wood, a dark, deserted spot, away from road or habitation.</p>

  <p>Her intention was evidently to meet someone, so when, presently, she
  halted beneath a clump of high black firs, I also took shelter a short
  distance away.</p>

  <p>She sat on the fallen trunk of a tree and waited in patience. Time went
  on, and so cold was it that I became chilled to the bones. I longed for a
  pipe, but feared that the smell of tobacco or the light might attract her.
  Therefore I was compelled to crouch and await the clandestine meeting.</p>

  <p>She remained very quiet. Not a dead leaf was stirred; not a sound came
  from her direction. I wondered why she waited in such complete silence.</p>

  <p>Nearly two hours passed, when, at last, cramped and half frozen, I raised
  myself in order to peer into the darkness in her direction.</p>

  <p>At first I could see no one, but, on straining my eyes, I saw, to my
  dismay, that she had fallen forward from the tree trunk, and was lying
  motionless in a heap upon the ground.</p>

  <p>I called to her, but received no reply. Then rising, I walked to the spot,
  and in dismay threw myself on my knees and tried to raise her. My hand
  touched her white cheek. It was as cold as stone.</p>

  <p>Next instant I undid her fur cape and bodice, and placed my hand upon her
  heart. There was no movement.</p>

  <p>Beatrice Graham was dead.</p>

  <p>The shock of the discovery held me spellbound. But when, a few moments
  later, I aroused myself to action, a difficult problem presented itself.
  Should I creep back to my room and say nothing, or should I raise the alarm,
  and admit that I had been watching her? My first care was to search the
  unfortunate girl's pocket, but I found nothing save a handkerchief and
  purse.</p>

  <p>Then I walked back, and, regardless of the consequences, gave the
  alarm.</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary here to describe the sensation caused by the discovery,
  or of how we carried the body back to the house. Suffice it to say that we
  called the doctor, who could find no mark of violence, or anything to account
  for death.</p>

  <p>And yet she had expired suddenly, without a cry.</p>

  <p>One feature, however, puzzled the doctor&mdash;namely, that her left hand
  and arm were much swollen, and had turned almost black, while the spine was
  curved&mdash;a fact which aroused a suspicion of some poison akin to
  strychnia.</p>

  <p>From the very first, I held a theory that she had been secretly poisoned,
  but with what motive I could not imagine.</p>

  <p>A post-mortem examination was made by three doctors on the following day,
  but, beyond confirming the theory I held, they discovered nothing.</p>

  <p>On the day following, a few hours before the inquest, I was recalled to
  the Foreign Office by telegraph, and that same afternoon sat with the
  Marquess of Macclesfield in his private room receiving his instructions.</p>

  <p>An urgent despatch from Lord Rockingham, our Ambassador at Petersburg,
  made it plain that an alliance had been proposed by Russia to Germany, the
  effect of which would be to break British power in the Far East. His
  Excellency knew that the terms of the secret agreement had been settled, and
  all that remained was its signature. Indeed, it would have already been
  signed save for opposition in some quarters unknown, and while that
  opposition existed I might gain time to ascertain the exact terms of the
  proposed alliance&mdash;no light task in Russia, be it said, for police spies
  exist there in thousands, and my disguise had always to be very carefully
  thought out whenever I passed the frontier at Wirballen.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* German name of the Lithuanian border town Virbalis.
  &mdash;RG.]</p>

  <p>The Marquess urged upon me to put all our secret machinery in motion in
  order to discover the terms of the proposed agreement, and more particularly
  as regards the extension of Russian influence in Manchuria.</p>

  <p>'I know well the enormous difficulties of the inquiry,' his lordship said;
  'but recollect, Drew, that in this matter you may be the means of saving the
  situation in the Far East. If we gain knowledge of the truth, we may be able
  to act promptly and effectively. If not&mdash;well&mdash;' and the
  grey-headed statesman shrugged his shoulders expressively without concluding
  the sentence.</p>

  <p>Full of regret that I was unable to remain at Cotterstock and sift the
  mystery surrounding Beatrice Graham's death, I left London that night for
  Berlin, where, on the following evening, I called upon our secret agent,
  Kersch, who lived in a small but comfortable house at Teltow, one of the
  suburbs of the German capital. He occupied a responsible position in the
  German Foreign Office, but, having expensive tastes and a penchant for cards,
  was not averse to receiving British gold in exchange for the confidential
  information with which he furnished us from time to time. I sat with him,
  discussing the situation for a long time. It was true, he said, that a draft
  agreement had been prepared and placed before the Tzar and the Kaiser, but it
  had not yet been signed. He knew nothing of the clauses, however, as they had
  been prepared in secret by the Minister's own hand, neither could he suggest
  any means of obtaining knowledge of them.</p>

  <p>My impulse was to go on next day to Petersburg. Yet somehow I felt that I
  might be more successful in Germany than in Russia, so resolved to continue
  my inquiries.</p>

  <p>'By the way,' the German said, 'you wrote me about Krempelstein. He has
  been absent a great deal lately, but I had no idea he had been to England.
  Can he be interested in the same matter on which you are now engaged?'</p>

  <p>'Is he now in Berlin?' I inquired eagerly.</p>

  <p>'I met him at Boxhagen three days ago. He seems extremely active just
  now.'</p>

  <p>'Three days ago!' I echoed. 'You are quite certain of the day?' I asked
  him this because, if his statement were true, it was proved beyond doubt that
  the German spy had no hand in the unfortunate girl's death.</p>

  <p>'I am quite certain,' was his reply. 'I saw him entering the station on
  Monday morning.'</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that same night, I called at the British Embassy and sat
  for a long time with the Ambassador in his private room. His Excellency told
  me all he knew regarding the international complication which the Marquess,
  sitting in Downing Street, had foreseen weeks ago, but could make no
  suggestion as to my course of action. The war clouds had gathered
  undoubtedly, and the signing of the agreement between our enemies would cause
  it at once to burst over Europe. The crisis was one of the most serious in
  English history.</p>

  <p>One fact puzzled us both, just as it puzzled our Chief at
  home&mdash;namely, if the agreement had been seen and approved by both
  Emperors, why was it not signed? Whatever hitch had occurred, it was more
  potent than the will of the two most powerful monarchs in Europe.</p>

  <p>On my return to the hotel I scribbled a hasty note and sent it by
  messenger to the house of the Imperial Chancellor's son in Charlottenburg. It
  was addressed to Miss Maud Baines, the English governess of the Count's
  children, who, I may as well admit, was in our employ. She was a young,
  ingenuous and fascinating little woman. She had, at my direction, acted as
  governess in many of the great families in France, Russia and Germany, and
  was now in the employ of the Chancellor's son, in order to have opportunity
  of keeping a watchful eye on the great statesman himself.</p>

  <p>She kept the appointment next morning at an obscure cafe near the
  Behrenstrasse. She was a neatly dressed, rather petite person, with a face
  that entirely concealed her keen intelligence and marvellous cunning.</p>

  <p>As she sat at the little table with me, I told her in low tones of the
  object of my visit to Berlin, and sought her aid.</p>

  <p>'A serious complication has arisen. I was about to report to you through
  the Embassy,' was her answer. 'Last night the Chancellor dined with us, and I
  overheard him discussing the affair with his son as they sat alone smoking
  after the ladies had left. I listened at the door and heard the Chancellor
  distinctly say that the draft treaty had been stolen.'</p>

  <p>'Stolen!' I gasped. 'By whom?'</p>

  <p>'Ah! that's evidently the mystery&mdash;a mystery for us to fathom. But
  the fact that somebody else is in possession of the intentions of Germany and
  Russia against England, believed to be a secret, is no doubt the reason why
  the agreement has not been signed.'</p>

  <p>'Because it is no longer secret!' I suggested. 'Are you quite certain
  you've made no mistake?'</p>

  <p>'Quite,' was her prompt answer. 'You can surely trust me after the
  intricate little affairs which I have assisted you in unravelling? When may I
  return to Gloucester to see my friends?'</p>

  <p>'Soon, Miss Baines&mdash;as soon as this affair is cleared up. But tell
  me, does the Chancellor betray any fear of awkward complications when the
  secret of the proposed plot against England is exposed?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The Prince told his son in confidence that his only fear was of
  England's retaliation. He explained that, as far as was known, the secret
  document, after being put before the Tzar and approved, mysteriously
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Every inquiry was being made by the confidential agents of Russia and
  Germany, and further, he added, that even his trusted Krempelstein was
  utterly nonplussed.'</p>

  <p>Mention of Krempelstein brought back to me the recollection of the tragedy
  in rural England.</p>

  <p>'You've done us a great service, Miss Baines,' I said. 'This information
  is of highest importance. I shall telegraph in cipher at once to Lord
  Macclesfield. Do you, by any chance, happen to know a young lady named
  Graham?' I inquired, recollecting that the deceased woman had lived in
  Germany for several years.</p>

  <p>She responded in the negative, whereupon I drew from my pocket a snap-shot
  photograph, which I had taken of one of the meets of hounds at Wansford, and
  handing it to her inquired if she recognized any of the persons in it.</p>

  <p>Having carefully examined it, she pointed to Baron Stern, whom I had taken
  in the act of lighting a cigarette, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Why! that's Colonel Davidoff, who was secretary to Prince Obolenski when
  I was in his service. Do you know him?'</p>

  <p>'No,' I answered. 'But he has been hunting in England as Baron Stern, of
  Vienna. This man is his friend,' I added, indicating Percival.</p>

  <p>'And that's undoubtedly a man whom you know well by repute&mdash;Moore,
  Chief of the Russian Secret Service in England. He came to Prince Obolenski's
  once, when he was in Petersburg, and the Princess told me who he was.'</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, I had not been able to include Beatrice in the group,
  therefore I had only her description to place before the clever young woman,
  who had, on so many occasions, gained knowledge of secrets where I and my
  agents had failed. Her part was always a difficult one to play, but she was
  well paid, was a marvellous linguist, and for patience and cunning was
  unequalled.</p>

  <p>I described her as minutely as I could, but still she had no knowledge of
  her. She remained thoughtful a long time, and then observed:</p>

  <p>'You have said that she apparently knew Moore? He has, I know, recently
  been back in Petersburg, therefore they may have met there. She may be known.
  Why not seek for traces of her in Russia?'</p>

  <p>It seemed something of a wild-goose chase, yet with the whole affair
  shrouded in mystery and tragedy as it was, I was glad to adopt any suggestion
  that might lead to a solution of the enigma. The reticence of Mrs Hamilton
  regarding her cousin, and the apparent secret association of the dead girl
  with those two notorious spies, had formed a problem which puzzled me almost
  to the point of madness.</p>

  <p>The English governess told me where in Petersburg I should be likely to
  find either the two Russian agents, Davidoff or Moore, who had been posing in
  England for some unknown purpose as hunting men of means; therefore I left by
  the night mail for the Russian capital. I put up at a small, and not
  over-clean hotel, in preference to the Europe, and, compelled to carefully
  conceal my identity, I at once set about making inquiries in various
  quarters, whether the two men had returned to Russia. They had, and had both
  had long interviews, two days before, with General Zouboff, Chief of the
  Secret Service, and with the Russian Foreign Minister.</p>

  <p>At the Embassy, and in various English quarters, I sought trace of the
  woman whose death was such a profound mystery, but all in vain. At last I
  suddenly thought of another source of information as yet
  untried&mdash;namely, the register of the English Charity in Petersburg, and
  on searching it, I found, to my complete satisfaction, that about six weeks
  before Beatrice Graham applied to the administration, and was granted money
  to take her back to England. She was the daughter, it was registered, of a Mr
  Charles Graham, the English manager of a cotton mill in Moscow, who had been
  killed by an accident, and had left her penniless. For some months she had
  tried to earn her own living, in a costumier's shop in the Nevski, and, not
  knowing Russian sufficiently well, had been discharged. Before her father's
  death she had been engaged to marry a young Englishman, whose name was not
  given, but who was said to be tutor to the children of General Vraski,
  Governor-General of Warsaw.</p>

  <p>The information was interesting, but carried me no further, therefore I
  set myself to watch the two men who had travelled from England to consult the
  Tzar's chief adviser. Aided by two Russians, who were in British pay, I
  shadowed them day and night for six days, until, one evening, I followed
  Davidoff down to the railway station, where he took a ticket for the
  frontier. Without baggage I followed him, for his movements were of a man who
  was escaping from the country. He passed out across the frontier, and went on
  to Vienna, and thence direct to Paris, where he put up at the Hotel Terminus,
  Gare St Lazare.</p>

  <p>Until our arrival at the hotel he had never detected that I was following
  him, but on the second day in Paris we came face to face in the large central
  hall, used as a reading room. He glanced at me quickly, but whether he
  recognized me as the companion of Beatrice Graham in the hunting field I have
  no idea. All I know is that his movements were extremely suspicious, and that
  I invoked the aid of all three of our Secret Agents in Paris to keep watch on
  him, just as had been done in Petersburg.</p>

  <p>On the fourth night of our arrival in the French capital I returned to the
  hotel about midnight, having dined at the Café Americain with Greville, the
  naval attaché at the Embassy. In washing my hands prior to turning in, I
  received a nasty scratch on my left wrist from a pin which a careless
  laundress had left in the towel. There was a little blood, but I tied my
  handkerchief around it, and, tired out, lay down and was soon asleep.</p>

  <p>Half an hour afterwards, however, I was aroused by an excruciating pain
  over my whole left side, a strange twitching of the muscles of my face and
  hands, and a contraction of the throat which prevented me from breathing or
  crying out.</p>

  <p>I tried to rise and press the electric bell for assistance, but could not.
  My whole body seemed entirely paralysed. Then the ghastly truth flashed upon
  me, causing me to break out into a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>That pin had been placed there purposely. I had been poisoned and in the
  same manner as Beatrice Graham!</p>

  <p>I recollect that my heart seemed to stop, and my nails clenched themselves
  in the palms in agony. Then next moment I knew no more.</p>

  <p>When I recovered consciousness, Ted Greville, together with a tall,
  black-bearded man named Delisle, who was in the confidential department of
  the Quai d'Orsay and who often furnished us with information&mdash;at a very
  high figure, be it said&mdash;were standing by my bedside, while a French
  doctor was leaning over the foot rail watching me.</p>

  <p>'Thank heaven you're better, old chap!' Greville exclaimed. 'They thought
  you were dead. You've had a narrow squeak. How did it happen?'</p>

  <p>'That pin!' I cried, pointing to the towel.</p>

  <p>'What pin?'he asked.</p>

  <p>'Mind! don't touch the towel,' I cried. 'There's a pin in it&mdash;a pin
  that's poisoned! That Russian evidently came here in my absence and very
  cunningly laid a deathtrap for me.'</p>

  <p>'You mean Davidoff,' chimed in the Frenchman. 'When, m'sieur, the doctor
  has left the room I can tell you something in confidence.'</p>

  <p>The doctor discreetly withdrew, and then our spy said:</p>

  <p>'Davidoff has turned traitor to his own country. I have discovered that
  the reason of his visit here is because he has in his possession the original
  draft of a proposed secret agreement between Russia and Germany against
  England, and is negotiating for its sale to us for one hundred thousand
  francs. He had a secret interview with our Chief last night at his private
  house in the Avenue des Champs Elysées.'</p>

  <p>'Then it is he who stole it, after it had the Tzar's approval!' I cried,
  starting up in bed, aroused at once to action by the information. 'Has he
  disposed of it to France?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet. It is still in his possession.'</p>

  <p>'And he is here?'</p>

  <p>'No. He has hidden himself in lodgings in the Rue Lafayette, No. 247,
  until the Foreign Minister decides whether he shall buy the document.'</p>

  <p>'And the name by which he is known there?'</p>

  <p>'He is passing as a Greek named Geunadios.'</p>

  <p>'Keep a strict watch on him. He must not escape,' I said. 'He has
  endeavoured to murder me.'</p>

  <p>'A watch is being kept,' was the Frenchman's answer, as, exhausted, I sank
  again upon the pillow.</p>

  <p>Just before midnight I entered the traitor's room in the Rue Lafayette,
  and when he saw me he fell back with blanched face and trembling hands.</p>

  <p>'No doubt my presence here surprises you,' I said, 'but I may as well at
  once state my reason for coming here. I want a certain document which
  concerns Germany and your own country&mdash;the document which you have
  stolen to sell to France.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean, m'sieur?' he asked, with an attempted hauteur.</p>

  <p>'My meaning is simple. I require that document, otherwise I shall give you
  into the hands of the police for attempted murder. The Paris police will
  detain you until the police of Petersburg apply for your extradition as a
  traitor. You know what that means&mdash;Schlüsselburg.'</p>

  <p>Mention of that terrible island fortress, dreaded by every Russian, caused
  him to quiver. He looked me straight in the face, and saw determination
  written there, yet he was unyielding, and refused for a long time to give the
  precious document into my hands. I referred to his stay at Stoke Doyle, and
  spoke of his friendship with the spy Moore, so that he should know that I was
  aware of the truth, until at last he suggested a bargain with me, namely,
  that in exchange for the draft agreement against England I should preserve
  silence and permit him to return to Russia.</p>

  <p>To this course I acceded, and then the fellow took from a secret cavity of
  his travelling bag a long official envelope, which contained the
  innocent-looking paper, which would, if signed, have destroyed England's
  prestige in the Far East. He handed it to me, the document for which he hoped
  to obtain one hundred thousand francs, and in return I gave him his liberty
  to go back to Russia unmolested.</p>

  <p>Our parting was the reverse of cordial, for undoubtedly he had placed in
  my towel the pin which had been steeped in some subtle and deadly poison, and
  then escaped from the hotel, in the knowledge that I must sooner or later
  become scratched and fall a victim.</p>

  <p>I had had a very narrow escape it was true, but I did not think so much of
  my good fortune in regaining my life as the rapid delivery of the
  all-important document into Lord Macclesfield's hands, which I effected at
  noon next day.</p>

  <p>My life had been at stake, for I afterwards found that a second man had
  been his accomplice, but happily I had succeeded in obtaining possession of
  the actual document, the result being that England acted so promptly and
  vigorously that the situation was saved, and the way was, as you know, opened
  for the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which, to the discomfiture of Germany, was
  effected a few months later.</p>

  <p>Nearly two years have gone by since then, and it was only the other day,
  by mere accident, that I made a further discovery which explained the death
  of the unfortunate Beatrice Graham,</p>

  <p>A young infantry lieutenant, named Bellingham, having passed in Russian,
  had some four years before entered our Secret Service, and been employed in
  Russia on certain missions. A few days ago, on his return to London, after
  performing a perilous piece of espionage on the Russo-German frontier, he
  called upon me in Bloomsbury, and in course of conversation, mentioned that
  about two years ago, in order to get access to certain documents relating to
  the Russian mobilisation scheme for her western frontier, he acted as tutor
  to the sons of the Governor-General of Warsaw.</p>

  <p>In an instant a strange conjecture flashed across my mind.</p>

  <p>'Am I correct in assuming that you knew a young English lady in Russia
  named Graham&mdash;Beatrice Graham?'</p>

  <p>He looked me straight in the face, open-mouthed in astonishment, yet I saw
  that a cloud of sadness overshadowed him instantly.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said. 'I knew her. Our meeting resulted in a terrible tragedy.
  Owing to the position I hold I have been compelled to keep the details to
  myself&mdash;although it is the tragedy of my life.'</p>

  <p>'How? Tell me,' I urged sympathetically.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' he sighed, 'it is a strange story. We met in Petersburg; where she
  was employed in a shop in the Nevski. I loved her, and we became engaged.
  Withholding nothing from her I told her who I was and the reason I was in the
  service of the Governor-General. At once, instead of despising me as a spy,
  she became enthusiastic as an Englishwoman, and declared her readiness to
  assist me. She was looking forward to our marriage, and saw that if I could
  effect a big coup my position would at once be improved, and we could then be
  united.'</p>

  <p>He broke off, and remained silent for a few moments, looking blankly down
  into the grey London street. Then he said,</p>

  <p>'I explained to her the suspicion that Germany and Russia were conspiring
  in the Far East, and told her that a draft treaty was probably in existence,
  and that it was a document of supreme importance to British interests. Judge
  my utter surprise when, a week later, she came to me with the actual document
  which she said she had managed to secure from the private cabinet of Prince
  Korolkoff, director of the private Chancellerie of the Emperor, to whose
  house she had gone on a commission to the Princess. Truly she had acted with
  a boldness and cleverness that were amazing. Knowing the supreme importance
  of the document, I urged her to leave Russia at once, and conceal herself
  with friends in England, taking care always that the draft treaty never left
  her possession. This plan she adopted, first, however, placing herself under
  the protection of the English charity, thus allaying any suspicions that the
  police might entertain.</p>

  <p>'Poor Beatrice went to stay with her cousin, a lady named Hamilton, in
  Northamptonshire, but the instant the document was missed the Secret Services
  of Germany and Russia were at once agog, and the whole machinery was set in
  motion, with the result that two Russian agents&mdash;an Englishman named
  Moore, and a Russian named Davidoff&mdash;as well as Krempelstein, chief of
  the German Service, had suspicions, and followed her to England with the
  purpose of obtaining re-possession of the precious document. For some weeks
  they plotted in vain, although both the German and the Englishman succeeded
  in getting on friendly terms with her.</p>

  <p>'She telegraphed to me, asking how she should dispose of the document,
  fearing to keep it long in her possession, but not being aware of the
  desperate character of the game, I replied that there was nothing to be
  feared. I was wrong,' he cried, bitterly. 'I did not recognize the vital
  importance of the information; I did not know that Empires were at stake. The
  man Davidoff, who posed as a wealthy Austrian Baron, had by some means
  discovered that she always carried the precious draft concealed in the bodice
  of her dress, therefore he had recourse to a dastardly ruse. From what I have
  since discovered he one day succeeded in concealing in the fur of her cape a
  pin impregnated with a certain deadly arrow poison unknown to toxicologists.
  Then he caused to be dispatched from London a telegram purporting to come
  from me, urging her to meet me in secret at a certain spot on that same
  night. In eager expectation the poor girl went forth to meet me, believing I
  had returned unexpectedly from Russia, but in putting on her cape, she tore
  her finger with the poisoned pin. While waiting for me the fatal paralysis
  seized her, and she expired, after which Davidoff crept up, secured the
  missing document and escaped. His anxiety to get hold of it was to sell it at
  a high price to a foreign country, nevertheless he was compelled first to
  return to Russia and report. No one knew that he actually held the draft, for
  to Krempelstein, as well as to Moore, my poor love's death was believed to be
  due to natural causes, while Davidoff, on his part, took care to so arrange
  matters, that his presence at the spot where poor Beatrice expired could
  never be proved. The spies therefore left England reluctantly after the
  tragedy, believing that the document, if ever possessed by my unfortunate
  love, had passed out of her possession into unknown hands.'</p>

  <p>'And what of the assassin Davidoff now?' I inquired.</p>

  <p>'I have avenged her death,' answered Bellingham with set teeth. 'I gave
  information to General Zouboff of the traitor's attempted sale of the draft
  treaty to France, with the result that the court martial has condemned him to
  incarceration for life in the cells below the lake at Schlüsselburg.'</p>
