  <br>
  <p class="first">HAVE you ever been flat broke, hungry as the very devil, and
  yet so down and out that you didn't even care? Looking back now, after a
  couple of months, it's hard to put it into words, but I think the low point
  was the evening old Captain Harris Henshaw dropped into my room&mdash;my
  room, that is, until the twenty-four-hour notice to move or pay up
  expired.</p>

  <p>There I sat, Jack Sands, ex-rocket pilot. Yeah, the same Jack Sands you're
  thinking of, the one who cracked up the Gunderson Europa expedition trying to
  land at Young's Field, Long Island, in March, 2110. Just a year and a half
  ago! It seemed like ten and a half. Five hundred idle days. Eighteen months
  of having your friends look the other way when you happened to pass on the
  street, partly because they're ashamed to nod to a pilot that's been tagged
  yellow, and partly because they feel maybe it's kinder to just let you drop
  out of sight peacefully.</p>

  <p>I didn't even look up when a knock sounded on my door, because I knew it
  could only be the landlady. "Haven't got it," I growled. "I've got a right to
  stay out my notice."</p>

  <p>"You got a right to make a damn fool of yourself," said Henshaw's voice.
  "Why don't you tell your friends your address?"</p>

  <p>"Harris!" I yelled. It was "Captain" only aboard ship. Then I caught
  myself. "What's the matter?" I asked, grinning bitterly. "Did you crack up,
  too? Coming to join me on the dust heap, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Coming to offer you a job," he growled.</p>

  <p>"Yeah? It must be a swell one, then. Carting sand to fill up the blast
  pits on a field, huh? And I'm damn near hungry enough to take it&mdash;but
  not quite."</p>

  <p>"It's a piloting job," said Henshaw quietly.</p>

  <p>"Who wants a pilot who's been smeared with yellow paint? What outfit will
  trust its ships to a coward? Don't you know that Jack Sands is tagged
  forever?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Jack," he said briefly. "I'm offering you the job as pilot under
  me on Interplanetary's new Europa expedition."</p>

  <p>I started to burn up then. You see, it was returning from Jupiter's third
  moon, Europa, that I'd smashed up the Gunderson outfit, and now I got a wild
  idea that Henshaw was taunting me about that. "By Heaven!" I screeched. "If
  you're trying to be funny&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But he wasn't. I quieted down when I saw he was serious, and he went on
  slowly, "I want a pilot I can trust, Jack. I don't know anything about your
  cracking up the <i>Hera</i>; I was on the Venus run when it happened. All I
  know is that I can depend on you."</p>

  <p>After a while I began to believe him. When I got over the shock a little,
  I figured Henshaw was friend enough to be entitled to the facts.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Harris," I said. "You're taking me on, reputation and all, and it
  looks to me as if you deserve an explanation. I haven't been whining about
  the bump I got, and I'm not now. I cracked up Gunderson and his outfit all
  right, only&mdash;" I hesitated; it's kind of tough to feel that maybe you're
  squirming in the pinch&mdash;"only my co-pilot, that fellow Kratska, forgot
  to mention a few things, and mentioned a few others that weren't true. Oh, it
  was my shift, right enough, but he neglected to tell the investigating
  committee that I'd stood his shift and my own before it. I'd been on for two
  long shifts, and this was my short one."</p>

  <p>"Two long ones!" echoed Henshaw. "You mean you were on sixteen hours
  before the landing shift?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean. I'll tell you just what I told the committee, and
  maybe you'll believe me. They didn't. But when Kratska showed up to relieve
  me he was hopped. He had a regular hexylamine jag, and he couldn't have
  piloted a tricycle. So I did the only possible thing to do; I sent him back
  to sleep it off, and I reported it to Gunderson, but that still left me the
  job of getting us down.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't have been so bad if it had happened in space, because there
  isn't much for a pilot to do out there except follow the course laid out by
  the captain, and maybe dodge a meteor if the alarm buzzes. But I had sixteen
  solid hours of teetering down through a gravitational field, and by the time
  my four-hour spell came around I was bleary."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder," said the captain. "Two long shifts!"</p>

  <p>Maybe I'd better explain a rocket's pilot system. On short runs like Venus
  or Mars, a vessel could carry three pilots, and then it's a simple matter of
  three eight-hour shifts. But on any longer run, because air and weight and
  fuel and food are all precious, no rocket ever carries more than two
  pilots.</p>

  <p>So a day's run is divided into four shifts, and each pilot has one long
  spell of eight hours, then four hours off, then four hours on again for his
  short shift, and then eight hours to sleep. He eats two of his meals right at
  the control desk, and the third during his short free period. It's a queer
  life, and sometimes men have been co-pilots for years without really seeing
  each other except at the beginning and the end of their run.</p>

  <p>I went on with my story, still wondering whether Henshaw would feel as if
  I were whining. "I was bleary," I repeated, "but Kratska showed up still
  foggy, and I didn't dare trust a hexylamine dope with the job of landing.
  Anyway, I'd reported to Gunderson, and that seemed to shift some of the
  responsibility to him. So I let Kratska sit in the control cabin, and I began
  to put down."</p>

  <p>Telling the story made me mad all over. "Those lousy reporters!" I blazed.
  "All of them seemed to think landing a rocket is like settling down in bed;
  you just cushion down on your underblast. Yeah; they don't realize that you
  have to land blind, because three hundred feet down from the ground the blast
  begins to splash against it.</p>

  <p>"You watch the leveling poles at the edge of the field and try to judge
  your altitude from them, but you don't see the ground; what you see under you
  are the flames of Hell. And another thing they don't realize: lowering a ship
  is like bringing down a dinner plate balanced on a fishing rod. If she starts
  to roll sideways&mdash;blooey! The underjets only hold you up when they're
  pointing down, you know."</p>

  <p>Henshaw let me vent my temper without interruption, and I returned to my
  story. "Well, I was getting down as well as could be expected. The
  <i>Hera</i> always did have a tendency to roll a little, but she wasn't the
  worst ship I've put to ground.</p>

  <p>"But every time she slid over a little, Kratska let out a yell; he was
  nervous from his dope jag, and he knew he was due to lose his license, and on
  top of that he was just plain scared by the side roll. We got to seventy feet
  on the leveling poles when she gave a pretty sharp roll, and Kratska went
  plain daffy."</p>

  <p>I hesitated. "I don't know exactly how to tell what happened. It went
  quick, and I didn't see all of it, of course. But suddenly Kratska, who had
  been fumbling with the air lock for ten minutes, shrieked something like
  'She's going over!' and grabbed the throttle. He shut off the blast before I
  could lift an eyelash, shut it off and flung himself out. Yeah; he'd opened
  the air lock.</p>

  <p>"Well, we were only seventy feet&mdash;less than that&mdash;above the
  field. We dropped like an overripe apple off a tree. I didn't have time even
  to move before we hit, and when we hit, all the fuel in all the jets must
  have let go. And for what happened after that you'd better read the
  newspapers."</p>

  <p>"Not me," said Henshaw. "You spill it."</p>

  <p>"I can't, not all of it, because I was laid out. But I can guess, all
  right. It seems that when the jets blew off, Kratska was just picked up in a
  couple of cubic yards of the soft sand he had landed in, and tossed clear. He
  had nothing but a broken wrist. And as for me, apparently I was shot out of
  the control room, and banged up considerably. And as for Gunderson, his
  professors, and everyone else on the Hera&mdash;well, they were just stains
  on the pool of molten ferralumin that was left."</p>

  <p>"Then how," asked Henshaw, "did they hang it on you?"</p>

  <p>I tried to control my voice. "Kratska," I said grimly. "The field was
  clear for landing; nobody can stand in close with the blast splashing in a
  six-hundred-foot circle. Of course, they saw someone jump from the nose of
  the ship after the jets cut off, but how could they tell which of us? And the
  explosion shuffled the whole field around, and nobody knew which was
  what."</p>

  <p>"Then it should have been his word against yours."</p>

  <p>"Yeah; it should have been. But the field knew it was my shift because I'd
  been talking over the landing beam, and besides, Kratska got to the reporters
  first. I never even knew of the mess until I woke up at Grand Mercy Hospital
  thirteen days later. By that time Kratska had talked and I was the goat."</p>

  <p>"But the investigating committee?"</p>

  <p>I grunted. "Sure, the investigating committee. I'd reported to Gunderson,
  but he made a swell witness, being just an impurity in a mass of ferralumin
  alloy. And Kratska had disappeared anyway."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't they find him?"</p>

  <p>"Not on what I knew about him. We picked him up at Junopolis on Io,
  because Briggs was down with white fever. I didn't see him at all except when
  we were relieving each other, and you know what that's like, seeing somebody
  in a control cabin with the sun shields up. And on Europa we kept to space
  routine, so I couldn't even give you a good description of him. He had a
  beard, but so have ninety per cent of us after a long hop, and he said when
  we took him on that he'd just come over from the Earth." I paused. "I'll find
  him some day."</p>

  <p>"Hope you do," said Henshaw briskly. "About this present run, now.
  There'll be you and me, and then there'll be Stefan Coretti, a physical
  chemist, and an Ivor Gogrol, a biologist. That's the scientific personnel of
  the expedition."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, but who's my co-pilot? That's what interests me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure," said Henshaw, and coughed. "Your co-pilot. Well, I've been
  meaning to tell you. It's Claire Avery."</p>

  <p>"<i>Claire Avery!</i>"</p>

  <p>"That's right," agreed the captain gloomily. "The Golden Flash herself.
  The only woman pilot to have her name on the Curry cup, winner of this year's
  Apogee race."</p>

  <p>"She's no pilot!" I snapped. "She's a rich publicity hound with brass
  nerves. I was just curious enough to blow ten bucks rental on a 'scope to
  watch that race. She was ninth rounding the Moon. Ninth! Do you know how she
  won? She gunned her rocket under full acceleration practically all the way
  back, and then fell into a braking orbit.</p>

  <p>"Any sophomore in Astronautics II knows that you can't calculate a braking
  orbit without knowing the density of the stratosphere and ionosphere, and
  even then it's a gamble. That's what she did&mdash;simply gambled, and
  happened to be lucky. Why do you pick a rich moron with a taste for thrills
  on a job like this?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't pick her, Jack. Interplanetary picked her for publicity
  purposes. To tell the truth, I think this whole expedition is an attempt to
  get a little favorable advertising to offset that shady stock investigation
  this spring. Interplanetary wants to show itself as the noble patron of
  exploration. So Claire Avery will take off for the television and papers, and
  you'll be politely ignored."</p>

  <p>"And that suits me! I wouldn't even take the job if things were a little
  different, and&mdash;" I broke off suddenly, frozen "Say," I said weakly,
  "did you know they'd revoked my license?"</p>

  <p>"You don't say," said Henshaw. "And after all the trouble I had talking
  Interplanetary into permission to take you on, too." Then he grinned. "Here,"
  he said, tossing me an envelope. "See how long it'll take you to lose this
  one."</p>

  <p>But the very sight of the familiar blue paper was enough to make me forget
  a lot of things&mdash;Kratska, Claire Avery, even hunger.</p>

  <p>The take-off was worse than I had expected. I had sense enough to wear my
  pilot's goggles to the field, but of course I was recognized as soon as I
  joined the group at the rocket. They'd given us the <i>Minos</i>, an old
  ship, but she looked as if she'd handle well.</p>

  <p>The newsmen must have had orders to ignore me, but I could hear plenty of
  comments from the crowd. And to finish things up, there was Claire Avery, a
  lot prettier than she looked on the television screens, but with the same
  unmistakable cobalt-blue eyes, and hair closer to the actual shade of
  metallic gold than any I'd ever seen. The "Golden Flash," the newsmen called
  her. Blah!</p>

  <p>She accepted her introduction to me with the coolest possible nod, as if
  to say to the scanners and cameras that it wasn't her choice she was teamed
  with yellow Jack Sands. But for that matter, Coretti's black Latin eyes were
  not especially cordial either, nor were Gogrol's broad features. I'd met
  Gogrol somewhere before, but couldn't place him at the moment.</p>

  <p>Well, at last the speeches were over, and the photographers and broadcast
  men let the Golden Flash stop posing, and she and I got into the control
  cabin for the take-off. I still wore my goggles, and huddled down low
  besides, because there were a dozen telescopic cameras and scanners recording
  us from the field's edge. Claire Avery simply ate it up, though, smiling and
  waving before she cut in the underblast. But finally we were rising over the
  flame.</p>

  <p>She was worse than I'd dreamed. The <i>Minos</i> was a sweetly balanced
  ship, but she rolled it like a baby's cradle. She had the radio on the field
  broadcast, and I could hear the description of the take-off: "&mdash;heavily
  laden. There&mdash;she rolls again. But she's making altitude. The blast has
  stopped splashing now, and is coming down in a beautiful fan of fire. A
  difficult take-off, even for the Golden Flash." A difficult take-off!
  Bunk!</p>

  <p>I was watching the red bubble in the level, but I stole a glance to Claire
  Avery's face, and it wasn't so cool and stand-offish now. And just then the
  bubble in the level bobbed way over, and I heard the girl at my side give a
  frightened little gasp. This wasn't cradle rocking any more&mdash;we were in
  a real roll!</p>

  <p>I slapped her hands hard and grabbed the U-bar. I cut the underjets
  completely off, letting the ship fall free, then shot the full blast through
  the right laterals. It was damn close, I'm ready to swear, but we leveled,
  and I snapped on the under-blast before we lost a hundred feet of altitude.
  And there was that inane radio still talking: "They're over! No&mdash;
  they've leveled again, but what a roll! She's a real pilot, this Golden
  Flash&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I looked at her; she was pale and shaken, but her eyes were angry. "Golden
  Flash, eh?" I jeered. "The gold must refer to your money, but what's the
  flash? It can't have much to do with your ability as a pilot." But at that
  time I had no idea how pitifully little she really knew about rocketry.</p>

  <p>She flared. "Anyway," she hissed, her lips actually quivering with rage,
  "the gold doesn't refer to color, Mr. Malaria Sands!" She knew that would
  hurt; the "Malaria" was some bright columnist's idea of a pun on my name. You
  see, malaria's popularly called Yellow Jack. "Besides," she went on
  defiantly, "I could have pulled out of that roll myself, and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>"Sure," I said, with the meanest possible sarcasm. We had considerable
  upward velocity now, and plenty of altitude, both of which tend toward safety
  because they give one more time to pull out of a roll. "You can take over
  again now. The hard part's over."</p>

  <p>She gave me a look from those electric blue eyes, and I began to realize
  just what sort of trip I was in for. Coretti and Gogrol had indicated their
  unfriendliness plainly enough, and heaven knows I couldn't mistake the hatred
  in Claire Avery's eyes, so that left just Captain Henshaw. But the captain of
  the ship dare not show favoritism; so all in all I saw myself doomed to a
  lonely trip.</p>

  <p>Lonely isn't the word for it. Henshaw was decent enough, but since Claire
  Avery had started with a long shift and so had the captain, they were having
  their free spells and meals on the same schedule, along with Gogrol, and that
  left me with Coretti. He was pretty cool, and I had pride enough left not to
  make any unwanted advances.</p>

  <p>Gogrol was worse; I saw him seldom enough, but he never addressed a word
  to me except on routine. Yet there was something familiar about him&mdash;As
  for Claire Avery, I simply wasn't in her scheme of things at all; she even
  relieved me in silence.</p>

  <p>Offhand, I'd have said it was the wildest sort of stupidity to send a girl
  with four men on a trip like this. Well, I had to hand it to Claire Avery; in
  <i>that</i> way she was a splendid rocketrix. She took the inconveniences of
  space routine without a murmur, and she was so companionable&mdash;that is,
  with the others&mdash;that it was like having a young and unusually
  entertaining man aboard.</p>

  <p>And, after all, Gogrol was twice her age and Henshaw almost three times;
  Coretti was younger, but I was the only one who was really of her generation.
  But as I say, she hated me; Coretti seemed to stand best with her.</p>

  <p>So the weary weeks of the journey dragged along. The Sun shrunk up to a
  disk only a fifth the diameter of the terrestrial Sun, but Jupiter grew to an
  enormous moon-like orb with its bands and spots gloriously tinted. It was an
  exquisite sight, and sometimes, since eight hours' sleep is more than I can
  use, I used to slip into the control room while Claire Avery was on duty,
  just to watch the giant planet and its moons. The girl and I never said a
  word to each other.</p>

  <p>We weren't to stop at Io, but were landing directly on Europa, our
  destination, the third moon outward from the vast molten globe of Jupiter. In
  some ways Europa is the queerest little sphere in the Solar System, and for
  many years it was believed to be quite uninhabitable. It is, too, as far as
  seventy per cent of its surface goes, but the remaining area is a wild and
  weird region.</p>

  <p>This is the mountainous hollow in the face toward Jupiter, for Europa,
  like the Moon, keeps one face always toward its primary. Here in this vast
  depression, all of the tiny world's scanty atmosphere is collected, gathered
  like little lakes and puddles into the valleys between mountain ranges that
  often pierce through the low-lying air into the emptiness of space.</p>

  <p>Often enough a single valley forms a microcosm sundered by nothingness
  from the rest of the planet, generating its own little rainstorms under pygmy
  cloud banks, inhabited by its indigenous life, untouched by, and unaware of,
  all else.</p>

  <p>In the ephemeris, Europa is dismissed prosaically with a string of
  figures: diameter, 2099 M.&mdash;period, 3 days, 13 hours, 14 seconds
  &mdash;distance from primary, 425,160 M. For an astronomical ephemeris isn't
  concerned with the thin film of life that occasionally blurs a planet's
  surface; it has nothing to say of the slow libration of Europa that sends
  intermittent tides of air washing against the mountain slopes under the tidal
  drag of Jupiter, nor of the waves that sometimes spill air from valley to
  valley, and sometimes spill alien life as well.</p>

  <p>Least of all is the ephemeris concerned with the queer forms that crawl
  now and then right up out of the air pools, to lie on the vacuum-bathed peaks
  exactly as strange fishes flopped their way out of the Earthly seas to bask
  on the sands at the close of the Devonian age.</p>

  <p>Of the five of us, I was the only one who had ever visited Europa&mdash;
  or so I thought at the time. Indeed, there were few men in the world who had
  actually set foot on the inhospitable little planet; Gunderson and his men
  were dead, save me and perhaps Kratska, and we had been the first organized
  expedition.</p>

  <p>Only a few stray adventurers from Io had preceded us. So it was to me that
  Captain Henshaw directed his orders when he said, "Take us as close as
  possible to Gunderson's landing."</p>

  <p>It began to be evident that we'd make ground toward the end of Claire's
  long shift, so I crawled out of the coffinlike niche I called my cabin an
  hour early, and went up to the control room to guide her down. We were
  seventy or eighty miles up, but there were no clouds or air distortion here,
  and the valleys crisscrossed under us like a relief map.</p>

  <p>It was infernally hard to pick Gunderson's valley; the burned spot from
  the blast was long since grown over, and I had only memory to rely on, for,
  of course, all charts were lost with the <i>Hera</i>. But I knew the general
  region, and it really made less difference than it might have, for
  practically all the valleys in that vicinity were connected by passes; one
  could walk between them in breathable air.</p>

  <p>After a while I picked one of a series of narrow parallel valleys, one
  with what I knew was a salt pool in the center&mdash;though most of them had
  that; they'd be desert without it&mdash;and pointed it out to Claire. "That
  one," I said, adding maliciously, "and I'd better warn you that it's narrow
  and deep&mdash;a ticklish landing place."</p>

  <p>She flashed me an unfriendly glance from sapphire eyes, but said nothing.
  But a voice behind me sounded unexpectedly: "To the left! The one to the
  left. It&mdash;it looks easier."</p>

  <p>Gogrol! I was startled for a moment, then turned coldly on him. "Keep out
  of the control room during landings," I snapped.</p>

  <p>He glared, muttered something, and retired. But he left me a trifle
  worried; not that his valley to the left was any easier to land in&mdash;
  that was pure bunk&mdash;but it looked a little familiar! Actually, I wasn't
  sure but that Gogrol had pointed out Gunderson's valley.</p>

  <p>But I stuck to my first guess. The irritation I felt I took out on Claire.
  "Take it slow!" I said gruffly. "This isn't a landing field. Nobody's put up
  leveling poles in these valleys. You're going to have to land completely
  blind from about four hundred feet, because the blast begins to splash sooner
  in this thin air. You go down by level and guess, and Heaven help us if you
  roll her! There's no room for rolling between those cliffs."</p>

  <p>She bit her lip nervously. The <i>Minos</i> was already rolling under the
  girl's inexpert hand, though that wasn't dangerous while we still had ten or
  twelve miles of altitude. But the ground was coming up steadily.</p>

  <p>I was in a cruel mood. I watched the strain grow in her lovely features,
  and if I felt any pity, I lost it when I thought of the way she had treated
  me. So I taunted her.</p>

  <p>"This shouldn't be a hard landing for the Golden Flash. Or maybe you'd
  rather be landing at full speed, so you could fall into a braking ellipse
  &mdash;only that wouldn't work here, because the air doesn't stick up high
  enough to act as a brake."</p>

  <p>And a few minutes later, when her lips were quivering with tension, I
  said, "It takes more than publicity and gambler's luck to make a pilot,
  doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>She broke. She screamed suddenly, "Oh, take it! Take it, then!" and
  slammed the U-bar into my hands. Then she huddled back in her corner sobbing,
  with her golden hair streaming over her face.</p>

  <p>I took over; I had no choice. I pulled the <i>Minos</i> out of the roll
  Claire's gesture had put her in, and then started teetering down on the
  underjets. It was pitifully easy because of Europa's low gravitation and the
  resulting low falling acceleration; it gave the pilot so much time to
  compensate for side sway.</p>

  <p>I began to realize how miserably little the Golden Flash really knew about
  rocketry, and, despite myself, I felt a surge of pity for her. But why pity
  her? Everyone knew that Claire Avery was simply a wealthy, thrill-
  intoxicated daredevil, with more than her share of money, of beauty, of
  adulation. The despised Jack Sands pitying her? That's a laugh!</p>

  <p>The underblast hit and splashed, turning the brown-clad valley into black
  ashes and flame. I inched down very slowly now, for there was nothing to see
  below save the fiery sheet of the blast, and I watched the bubble on the
  level as if my life depended on it&mdash;which it did.</p>

  <p>I knew the splash began at about four hundred feet in this density of air,
  but from then on it was guesswork, and a question of settling down so slowly
  that when we hit we wouldn't damage the underjets. And if I do say it, we
  grounded so gently that I don't think Claire Avery knew it until I cut off
  the blast.</p>

  <p>She rubbed the tears away with her sleeve and glared blue-eyed defiance at
  me, but before she could speak, Henshaw opened the door. "Nice landing, Miss
  Avery," he said.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it?" I echoed, with a grin at the girl.</p>

  <p>She stood up. She was trembling and I think that under Earthly gravitation
  she would have fallen back into the pilot's seat, for I saw her knees shaking
  below her trim, black shorts.</p>

  <p>"I didn't land us," she said grimly. "Mr. Sands put us to ground."</p>

  <p>Somehow my pity got the best of me then. "Sure," I said. "It's into my
  shift. Look." It was; the chronometer showed three minutes in. "Miss Avery
  had all the hard part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she was gone. And try as I would, I could not bring myself to see her
  as the hard, brilliant thrill-seeker which the papers and broadcasts
  portrayed her. Instead, she left me with a strange and by no means logical
  impression of&mdash;wistfulness.</p>

  <p>Life on Europa began uneventfully. Little by little we reduced the
  atmospheric pressure in the <i>Minos</i> to conform to that outside. First
  Coretti and then Claire Avery had a spell of altitude sickness, but by the
  end of twenty hours we were all acclimated enough to be comfortable
  outside.</p>

  <p>Henshaw and I were first to venture into the open. I scanned the valley
  carefully for familiar landmarks, but it was hard to be sure; all these
  canyonlike ditches were much alike. I know that a copse of song-bushes had
  grown high on the cliff when the <i>Hera</i> had landed, but our blast had
  splashed higher, and if the bushes had been there, they were only a patch of
  ashes now.</p>

  <p>At the far end of the valley there should have been a cleft in the hills,
  a pass leading to the right into the next valley. That wasn't there; all I
  could distinguish was a narrow ravine cutting the hills to the left.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've missed Gunderson's valley," I told Henshaw. "I think it's
  the next one to our left; it's connected to this one by a pass, if I'm right,
  and this is one I came in several times to hunt." It recurred to me suddenly
  that Gogrol had said the left one.</p>

  <p>"You say there's a pass?" mused Henshaw. "Then we'll stay here rather than
  chance another take-off and another landing. We can work in Gunderson's
  valley through the pass. You're sure it's low enough so we won't have to use
  oxygen helmets?"</p>

  <p>"If it's the right pass, I am. But work at what in Gunderson's valley? I
  thought this was an exploring expedition."</p>

  <p>Henshaw gave me a queer, sharp look, and turned away. Right then I saw
  Gogrol standing in the port of the <i>Minos</i>, and I didn't know whether
  Henshaw's reticence was due to his presence or mine. I moved a step to follow
  him, but at that moment the outer door of the air lock opened and Claire
  Avery came out.</p>

  <p>It was the first time I had seen her in a fair light since the take-off at
  Young's Field, and I had rather forgotten the loveliness of her coloring. Of
  course, her skin had paled from the weeks in semidarkness, but her cadmium-
  yellow hair and sapphire-blue eyes were really startling, especially when she
  moved into the sun shadow of the cliff and stood bathed only in the golden
  Jupiter light.</p>

  <p>Like Henshaw and myself, she had slipped on the all-enveloping ski suit
  one wore on chilly little Europa. The small world received only a fourth as
  much heat as steamy Io, and would not have been habitable at all, except for
  the fact that it kept its face always toward its primary, and therefore
  received heat intermittently from the Sun, but eternally from Jupiter.</p>

  <p>The girl cast an eager look over the valley; I knew this was her first
  experience on an uninhabited world, and there is always a sense of
  strangeness and the fascination of the unknown in one's first step on an
  alien planet.</p>

  <p>She looked at Henshaw, who was methodically examining the scorched soil on
  which the <i>Minos</i> rested, and then her glance crossed mine. There was an
  electric moment of tension, but then the anger in her blue eyes&mdash;if it
  had been anger&mdash;died away, and she strode deliberately to my side.</p>

  <p>She faced me squarely. "Jack Sands," she said with an undertone of
  defiance, "I owe you an apology. Don't think I'm apologizing for my opinion
  of you, but only for the way I've been acting toward you. In a small company
  like this there isn't room for enmity, and as far as I'm concerned, your past
  is yours from now on. What's more, I want to thank you for helping me during
  the take-off, and"&mdash;her defiance was cracking a bit&mdash;"d-during
  the&mdash;the landing."</p>

  <p>I stared at her. That apology must have cost her an effort, for the Golden
  Flash was a proud young lady, and I saw her wink back her tears. I choked
  back the vicious reply I had been about to make, and said only, "O.K. You
  keep your opinion of me to yourself and I'll do the same with my opinion of
  you."</p>

  <p>She flushed, then smiled. "I guess I'm a rotten pilot," she admitted
  ruefully. "I hate take-offs and landings. To tell the truth, I'm simply
  scared of the <i>Minos</i>. Up to the time we left Young's Field, I'd never
  handled anything larger than my little racing rocket, the <i>Golden
  Flash</i>."</p>

  <p>I gasped. That wouldn't have been credible if I hadn't seen with my own
  eyes how utterly unpracticed she was. "But why?" I asked in perplexity. "If
  you hate piloting so, why do it? Just for publicity? With your money you
  don't have to, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my money!" she echoed irritably. She stared away over the narrow
  valley, and started suddenly. "Look!" she cried. "There's something moving on
  the peaks&mdash;like a big ball. And way up where there's no air at all!"</p>

  <p>I glanced over. "It's just a bladder bird," I said indifferently. I'd seen
  plenty of them; they were the commonest mobile form of life on Europa. But of
  course Claire hadn't, and she was eagerly curious.</p>

  <p>I explained. I threw stones into a tinkling grove of song-bushes until I
  flushed up another, and it went gliding over our heads with its membrane
  stretched taut.</p>

  <p>I told her that the three-foot creature that had sailed like a flying
  squirrel was the same sort as the giant ball she had glimpsed among the
  airless peaks, only the one on the peaks had inflated its bladder. The
  creatures were able to cross from valley to valley by carrying their air with
  them in their big, balloonlike bladders. And, of course, bladder birds
  weren't really birds at all; they didn't fly, but glided like the lemurs and
  flying squirrels of Earth, and naturally, couldn't even do that when they
  were up on the airless heights.</p>

  <p>Claire was so eager and interested and wide-eyed that I quite forgot my
  grudge. I started to show her my knowledge of things Europan; I led her close
  to the copse of song-bushes so that she could listen to the sweet and
  plaintive melody of their breathing leaves, and I took her down to the salt
  pool in the center of the valley to find some of the primitive creatures
  which Gunderson's men had called "nutsies," because they looked very much
  like walnuts with the hulls on. But within was a small mouthful of delicious
  meat, neither animal nor vegetable, which was quite safe to eat raw, since
  bacterial life did not exist on Europa.</p>

  <p>I guess I was pretty exuberant, for after all, this was the first chance
  at companionship I'd had for many weeks. We wandered down the valley and I
  talked, talked about anything. I told her of the various forms life assumed
  on the planets, how on Mars and Titan and Europa sex was unknown, though
  Venus and Earth and Io all possessed it; and how on Mars and Europa vegetable
  and animal life had never differentiated, so that even the vastly intelligent
  beaked Martians had a tinge of vegetable nature, while conversely the
  song-bushes on the hills of Europa had a vaguely animal content. And
  meanwhile we wandered aimlessly along until we stood below the narrow pass or
  ravine that led presumably into Gunderson's valley to our left.</p>

  <p>Far up the slope a movement caught my eye. A bladder bird, I thought idly,
  though it was a low altitude for one to inflate; they usually expanded their
  bladders just below the point where breathing became impossible. Then I saw
  that it wasn't a bladder bird; it was a man. In fact, it was Gogrol.</p>

  <p>He was emerging from the pass, and his collar was turned up about his
  throat against the cold of the altitude. He hadn't seen us, apparently, as he
  angled down what mountaineers call a <i>col</i>, a ledge or neck of rock that
  slanted from the mouth of the ravine along the hillside toward the
  <i>Minos</i>. But Claire, following the direction of my gaze, saw him in the
  moment before brush hid him from view.</p>

  <p>"Gogroll" she exclaimed. "He must have been in the next valley. Stefan
  will want&mdash;" She caught herself sharply.</p>

  <p>"Why," I asked grimly, "should your friend Coretti be interested in
  Gogrol's actions? After all, Gogrol's supposed to be a biologist, isn't he?
  Why shouldn't he take a look in the next valley?"</p>

  <p>Her lips tightened. "Why shouldn't he?" she echoed. "I didn't say he
  shouldn't. I didn't say anything like that."</p>

  <p>And thenceforward she maintained a stubborn silence. Indeed, something of
  the old enmity and coolness seemed to have settled between us as we walked
  back through the valley toward the <i>Minos</i>.</p>

  <p>That night Henshaw rearranged our schedule to a more convenient plan than
  the requirements of space. We divided our time into days and nights, or
  rather into sleeping and waking periods, for, of course, there is no true
  night on Europa. The shifts of light are almost as puzzling as those on its
  neighbor Io, but not quite, because Io has its own rotation to complicate
  matters.</p>

  <p>On Europa, the nearest approach to true night is during the eclipse that
  occurs every three days or so, when the landscape is illumined only by the
  golden twilight of Jupiter, or at the most, only by Jupiter and Io light. So
  we set our own night time by arbitrary Earth reckoning, so that we might all
  work and sleep during the same periods.</p>

  <p>There was no need for any sort of watch to be kept; no one had ever
  reported life dangerous to man on little Europa. The only danger came from
  the meteors that swarm about the giant Jupiter's orbit, and sometimes came
  crashing down through the shallow air of his satellites; we couldn't dodge
  them here as we could in space. But that was a danger against which a guard
  was unavailing.</p>

  <p>It was the next morning that I cornered Henshaw and forced him to listen
  to my questions.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Harris," I said determinedly. "What is there about this
  expedition that everybody knows but me? If this is an exploring party, I'm
  the Ameer of Yarkand. Now I want to know what it's all about."</p>

  <p>Henshaw looked miserably embarrassed. He kept his eyes away from mine, and
  muttered unhappily, "I can't tell you, Jack. I'm damned sorry, but I can't
  tell you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. "Because I'm under orders not to, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Whose orders?"</p>

  <p>Henshaw shook his head. "Damn it!" he said vehemently. "I trust you. If it
  were my choice, you'd be the one I'd pick for honesty. But it isn't my
  choice." He paused. "Do you understand that? All right"&mdash;he stiffened
  into his captain's manner&mdash;"no more questions, then. I'll ask the
  questions and give the orders."</p>

  <p>Well, put on that basis, I couldn't argue. I'm a pilot, first, last, and
  always, and I don't disobey my superior's orders even when he happens to be
  as close a friend as Henshaw. But I began to kick myself for not seeing
  something queer in the business as soon as Henshaw offered me the job.</p>

  <p>If Interplanetary was looking for favorable publicity, they wouldn't get
  it by signing me on. Moreover, the government wasn't in the habit of
  reissuing a revoked pilot's license without good and sufficient reason, and I
  knew I hadn't supplied any such reason by loafing around brooding over my
  troubles. That alone should have tipped me off that something was screwy.</p>

  <p>And there were plenty of hints during the voyage itself. True, Gogrol
  seemed to talk the language of biology, but I'll be dogged if Coretti talked
  like a chemist. And there was that haunting sense of familiarity about
  Gogrol, too. And to cap the climax was the incongruity of calling this jaunt
  an exploring expedition; for all the exploring we were doing we might as well
  have landed on Staten Island or Buffalo. Better, as far as I was concerned,
  because I'd seen Europa but had never been to Buffalo.</p>

  <p>Well, there was nothing to be done about it now. I suppressed my disgust
  and tried as hard as I could to cooperate with the others in whatever project
  we were supposed to be pursuing. That was rather difficult, too, because
  suspicious-appearing incidents kept cropping up to make me feel like a
  stranger or an outcast.</p>

  <p>There was, for instance, the time Henshaw decided that a change in diet
  would be welcome. The native life of Europa was perfectly edible, though not
  all as tasty as the tiny shell creatures of the salt pools. However, I knew
  of one variety that had served the men of the <i>Hera</i>, a plantlike growth
  consisting of a single fleshy hand-sized member, that we had called
  liver-leaf because of its taste.</p>

  <p>The captain detailed Coretti and myself to gather a supply of this
  delicacy, and I found a specimen, showed it to him, and then set off
  dutifully along the north&mdash;that is, the left&mdash;wall of the
  valley.</p>

  <p>Coretti appeared to take the opposite side, but I had not gone far before
  I glimpsed him skirting my edge of the salt pool. That meant nothing; he was
  free to search anywhere for liver-leaf, but it was soon evident to me that he
  was not searching. He was following me; he was shadowing my movements.</p>

  <p>I was thoroughly irritated, but determined not to show it. I plodded
  methodically along, gathering the fat leaves in my basket, until I reached
  the valley's far end and the slopes back and succeeded in running square into
  Coretti before he could maneuver himself out of a copse of song-bushes.</p>

  <p>He grinned at me. "Any luck?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"More than you, it seems," I retorted, with a contemptuous look at his all
  but empty basket.</p>

  <p>"I had no luck at all. I thought maybe in the next valley, through the
  pass there, we might find some."</p>

  <p>"I've found my share," I grunted.</p>

  <p>I thought I noticed a flicker of surprise in his black eyes. "You're not
  going over?" he asked sharply. "You're going back?"</p>

  <p>"You guessed it," I said sharply. "My basket's full and I'm going
  back."</p>

  <p>I knew that he watched me most of the way back, because halfway to the
  <i>Minos</i> I turned around, and I could see him standing there on the slope
  below the pass.</p>

  <p>Along toward what we called evening the Sun went into our first eclipse.
  The landscape was bathed in the aureate light of Jupiter alone, and I
  realized that I'd forgotten how beautiful that golden twilight could be.</p>

  <p>I was feeling particularly lonesome, too; so I wandered out to stare at
  the glowing peaks against the black sky, and the immense, bulging sphere of
  Jupiter with Ganymede swinging like a luminous pearl close beside it. The
  scene was so lovely that I forgot my loneliness, until I was suddenly
  reminded of it.</p>

  <p>A glint of more brilliant gold caught my eye, up near the grove of song-
  bushes. It was Claire's head; she was standing there watching the display,
  and beside her was Coretti. While I looked, he suddenly turned and drew her
  into his arms; she put her hands against his chest, but she wasn't
  struggling; she was perfectly passive and content. It was none of my
  business, of course, but&mdash;well, if I'd disliked Coretti before, I hated
  him now, because I was lonely again.</p>

  <p>I think it was the next day that things came to a head, and trouble really
  began. Henshaw had been pleased with our meal of indigenous life, and decided
  to try it again. This time Claire was assigned to accompany me, and we set
  off in silence. A sort of echo of the coolness that had attended our last
  parting survived, and besides, what I had seen last night in the eclipse
  light seemed to make a difference to me. So I simply stalked along at her
  side, wondering what to choose for the day's menu.</p>

  <p>We didn't want liver-leaves again. The little nutsies from the salt pool
  were all right, but it was a half-day's job to gather enough, and besides,
  they were almost too salty to be pleasant fare for a whole meal. Bladder
  birds were hopeless; they consisted of practically nothing except thin skin
  stretched over a framework of bones. I remembered that once we had tried a
  brown, fungoid lump that grew in the shade under the song-bushes; some of
  Gunderson's men had liked it.</p>

  <p>Claire finally broke the silence. "If I'm going to help you look," she
  suggested, "I ought to know what we're looking for."</p>

  <p>I described the lumpy growths. "I'm not so sure all of us will like them.
  Near as I can remember, they tasted something like truffles, with a faint
  flavor of meat added. We tried them both raw and cooked, and cooked was
  best."</p>

  <p>"I like truffles," said the girl. "They're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A shot! There was no mistaking the sharp crack of a .38, though it sounded
  queerly thin in the rare atmosphere. But it sounded again, and a third time,
  and then a regular fusillade!</p>

  <p>"Keep back of me!" I snapped as we turned and raced for the <i>Minos</i>.
  The warning was needless; Claire was unaccustomed to the difficulties of
  running on a small planet. Her weight on Europa must have been no more than
  twelve or fifteen pounds, one eighth Earth normal, and though she had learned
  to walk easily enough&mdash;one learned that on any space journey&mdash;she
  had had no opportunity to learn to run. Her first step sent her half a dozen
  feet in the air; I sped away from her with the long, sliding stride one had
  to use on such planets as Europa.</p>

  <p>I burst out of the brush into the area cleared by the blast, where already
  growth had begun. For a moment I saw only the <i>Minos</i> resting peacefully
  in the clearing, then I reeled with shock. At the air lock lay a man&mdash;
  Henshaw&mdash;with his face a bloody pulp, his head split by two bullets.</p>

  <p>There was a burst of sound, voices, another shot. Out of the open air lock
  reeled Coretti; he staggered backward for ten steps, then dropped on his
  side, while blood welled up out of the collar of his suit. And standing
  grimly in the opening, an automatic smoking in his right hand, a charged
  flame-pistol in his left, was Gogrol!</p>

  <p>I had no weapon; why should one carry arms on airless Europa? For an
  instant I stood frozen, appalled, uncomprehending, and in that moment Gogrol
  glimpsed me. I saw his hand tighten on his automatic, then he shrugged and
  strode toward me.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said with a snarl in his voice, "I had to do it. They went
  crazy. Anerosis. It struck both of them at once, and they went clean mad.
  Self-defense, it was."</p>

  <p>I didn't believe him, of course. People don't get anerosis in air no rarer
  than Europa's; one could live his whole life out there without ever suffering
  from air starvation. But I couldn't argue those points with a panting
  murderer armed with the most deadly weapon ever devised, and with a girl
  coming up behind me. So I said nothing at all.</p>

  <p>Claire came up; I heard her shocked intake of breath, and her almost
  inaudible wail, "Stefan!" Then she saw Gogrol holding his guns, and she
  flared out, "So you did it! I knew they suspected you! But you'll never get
  away with it, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off under the sudden menace of Gogrol's eyes, and I stepped in
  front of her as he raised the automatic. For an instant death looked squarely
  at both of us, then the man shrugged and the evil light in his eyes
  dimmed.</p>

  <p>"A while yet," he muttered. "If Coretti dies&mdash;" He backed to the air
  lock and pulled a helmet from within the <i>Minos</i>, an air helmet that we
  had thought might serve should we ever need to cross the heights about a
  blind valley.</p>

  <p>Then Gogrol advanced toward us, and I felt Claire quiver against my
  shoulder. But the man only glared at us and spat out a single word. "Back!"
  he rasped. "Back!"</p>

  <p>We backed. Under the menace of that deadly flame-pistol he herded us along
  the narrow valley, eastward to the slope whence angled the ravine that led
  toward Gunderson's valley. And up the slope, into the dim shadows of the pass
  itself, so narrow in places that my outstretched hands could have spanned the
  gap between the walls. A grim, dark, echo-haunted, and forbidding place; I
  did not wonder that the girl shrank against me. The air was thin to the point
  of insufficiency, and all three of us were gasping for breath.</p>

  <p>There was nothing I could do, for Gogrol's weapons bore too steadily on
  Claire Avery. So I slipped my arm about her to hearten her and inched warily
  along that shadowy canyon, until at last it widened, and a thousand feet
  below stretched a valley&mdash;Gunderson's valley, I knew at once. Far away
  was the slope where the <i>Hera</i> had rested, and down in the lower end was
  the heart-shaped pool of brine.</p>

  <p>Gogrol had slipped on the helmet, leaving the visor open, and his flat
  features peered out at us like a gargoyle's. On he drove us, and down into
  the valley. But as he passed the mouth of the ravine, which by now was no
  more than a narrow gorge between colossal escarpments that loomed heavenward
  like the battlements of Atlantis, he stooped momentarily into the shadows,
  and when he rose again I fancied that a small sound like the singing of a
  teakettle followed us down the slope. It meant nothing to me then.</p>

  <p>He waved the automatic. "Faster!" he ordered threateningly. We were down
  in the talus now, and we scrambled doggedly among the rocks and fallen
  debris. On he drove us, until we stumbled among the boulders around the
  central pond. Then, suddenly, he halted.</p>

  <p>"If you follow," he said with a cold intensity, "I shoot!" He strode away
  not toward the pass, but toward the ridge itself, back along the slopes that
  lay nearest the <i>Minos</i>, hidden from view in the other valley. Of
  course, Gogrol could cross those airless heights, secure in this helmet,
  carrying his air supply like the bladder birds.</p>

  <p>He seemed to seek the shelter of an ascending ridge. As the jutting rock
  concealed him, I leaped to a boulder.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" I said. "Perhaps we can beat him through the pass to the
  ship!"</p>

  <p>"No!" screamed Claire, so frantically that I halted. "My Lord, no! Didn't
  you see the blaster he left?"</p>

  <p>The singing teakettle noise! I had barely time to throw myself beside the
  girl crouching behind a rock when the little atomic bomb let go.</p>

  <p>I suppose everybody has seen, either by eye or television, the effect of
  atomic explosions. All of us, by one means or the other, have watched old
  buildings demolished, road grades or canals blasted, and those over forty may
  even remember the havoc-spreading bombs of the Pacific War. But none of you
  could have seen anything like this, for this explosion had a low air pressure
  and a gravitation only one-eighth normal as the sole checks to its fury.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that the whole mountain lifted. Vast masses of crumbling
  rock hurtled toward the black sky. Bits of stone, whistling like bullets and
  incandescent like meteors, shot past us, and the very ground we clung to
  heaved like the deck of a rolling rocket.</p>

  <p>When the wild turmoil had subsided, when the debris no longer sang about
  us, when the upheaved masses had either fallen again or had spun beyond
  Europa's gravitation to crash on indifferent Jupiter, the pass had vanished.
  Mountain and vacuum hemmed us into a prison.</p>

  <p>Both of us were slightly stunned by the concussion, although the thin
  atmosphere transmitted a strangely high-pitched sound instead of the
  resounding <i>b-o-o-m</i> one would have heard on the Earth. When my head
  stopped ringing, I looked around for Gogrol, and saw him at last seven or
  eight hundred feet up the slope of the mountain. Anger surged in me; I seized
  a stone from the margin of the pool, and flung it viciously at him. One can
  throw amazing distances on small worlds like Europa; I watched the missile
  raise dust at his very feet.</p>

  <p>He turned; very deliberately he raised the automatic, and stone splinters
  from the boulder beside me stung my face. I dragged Claire down behind the
  shelter, knowing beyond doubt that he had meant that bullet to kill. In
  silence we watched him climb until he was but a tiny black speck, nearing the
  crest.</p>

  <p>He approached a bladder bird crawling its slow way along the airless
  heights. Up there the creatures were slow as snails, for their flight
  membranes were useless in the near vacuum. But they had normally no enemies
  on the peaks.</p>

  <p>I saw Gogrol change his course purposely to intercept the thing.
  Intentionally, maliciously, he kicked a hole in the inflated bladder,
  collapsing it like a child's balloon. He stood watching while the miserable
  creature flopped in the agonies of suffocation, then moved methodically on.
  It was the coldest exhibition of wanton cruelty I had ever witnessed.</p>

  <p>Claire shuddered; still in silence we watched the man's leisurely progress
  along the ridge. There was something in his attitude that suggested
  searching, seeking, hunting. Suddenly he quickened his pace and then halted
  abruptly, stooping over what looked to me like a waist-high heap of stones,
  or perhaps merely a hummock on the ridge.</p>

  <p>But he was burrowing in it, digging, flinging stones and dirt aside. And
  at last he stood up; if he held anything, distance hid it, but he seemed to
  wave some small object at us in derisive triumph. Then he moved over the
  crest of the hills and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Claire sighed despondently; she seemed very little like the proud and
  rather arrogant Golden Flash. "That settles it," she murmured disconsolately.
  "He's got it, and he's got us trapped; so we're quite helpless."</p>

  <p>"Got what?" I asked. "What was he digging for up there?"</p>

  <p>Her blue eyes widened in amazement. "Don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly don't. I seem to know less about this damn trip than anybody
  else on it."</p>

  <p>She gazed steadily at me. "I knew Stefan was wrong," she said softly. "I
  don't care what you were when you wrecked the <i>Hera</i>, Jack Sands; on
  this trip you've been decent and brave and a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I said dryly, but I was a little touched for all that because,
  after all, the Golden Flash was a very beautiful girl. "Then suppose you let
  me in on a few of the secrets. For instance, what was Coretti wrong about?
  And what did Gogrol dig for?"</p>

  <p>"Gogrol," she said, watching me, "was digging in Gunderson's cairn."</p>

  <p>I looked blank. "Gunderson's what? This is news to me."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. "Jack Sands," she said at last, "I don't care
  what Stefan or the government or anybody thinks of you. I think you're
  honest, and I think you've had an injustice done you somehow, and I don't
  believe you were to blame in the <i>Hera</i> crash. And I'm going to tell you
  all I know about this matter. But first, do you know the object of
  Gunderson's expedition to Europa?"</p>

  <p>"I never knew it. I'm a pilot; I took no interest in their scientific
  gibberish."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Well, you know how a rocket motor works, of course. How they
  use a minute amount of uranium or radium as catalyst to release the energy in
  the fuel. Uranium has low activity; it will set off only metals like the
  alkalis, and ships using uranium motors burn salt. And radium, being more
  active, will set off the metals from iron to copper; so ships using a radium
  initiator usually burn one of the commoner iron or copper ores."</p>

  <p>"I know all that," I grunted. "And the heavier the metal, the greater the
  power from its disintegration."</p>

  <p>"Exactly." She paused a moment. "Well, Gunderson wanted to use still
  heavier elements. That required a source of rays more penetrating than those
  from radium, and he knew of only one available source&mdash;Element 91,
  protactinium. And it happens that the richest deposits of protactinium so far
  discovered are those in the rocks of Europa; so to Europa he came for his
  experiments."</p>

  <p>"Well?" I asked. "Where do I fit in this mess?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know, Jack. Let me finish what I know, which is all Stefan
  would tell me. Gunderson succeeded, they think; he's supposed to have worked
  out the formula by which protactinium could be made to set off lead, which
  would give much more power than any present type of initiator. But if he did
  succeed, his formula and notes were destroyed when the <i>Hera</i>
  crashed!"</p>

  <p>I began to see. "But what&mdash;what about that cairn?"</p>

  <p>"You really don't know?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be double damned if I do! If Gunderson built a cairn, it must have
  been that last day. I had the take-off, so I slept through most of it. But
  &mdash;why, they did have some sort of ceremony!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Gunderson mentioned something about it when your ship touched at
  Junopolis on Io. What the government hopes is that he buried a copy of his
  formula in that cairn. They do, you know. Well, nobody could possibly know of
  the location except you and a man named Kratska, who had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"So Interplanetary, which is in bad anyway because of some stock
  transactions, was ordered to back this expedition with you as pilot&mdash;or
  at least, that's what Stefan told me. I guess I was taken along just to give
  the corporation a little more publicity, and, of course, Stefan was sent to
  watch you, in hopes you'd give away the location. The formula's immensely
  valuable, you see."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I see. And how about Gogrol?"</p>

  <p>She frowned. "I don't know. Stefan hinted that he had some connections
  with Harrick of Interplanetary, or perhaps some hold over him. Harrick
  insisted on his being a member."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" I exploded suddenly. "He knew about the cairn! He knew where
  to look!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew wide. "Why, he did! He's&mdash;could he be the
  representative of some foreign government? If we could stop him! But he's
  left us absolutely helpless here. Why didn't he kill us?"</p>

  <p>"I can guess that," I said grimly. "He can't fly the <i>Minos</i> alone.
  Henshaw's dead, and if Coretti dies&mdash;well, one of us is due for the job
  of pilot."</p>

  <p>A tremor shook her. "I'd rather be dead, too," she murmured, "than to
  travel with him alone."</p>

  <p>"And I'd rather see you so," I agreed glumly. "I wish to heaven you had
  stayed out of this. You could be home enjoying your money."</p>

  <p>"My money!" she flashed. "I haven't any money. Do you think I take these
  chances for publicity or thrills or admiration?"</p>

  <p>I gaped; of course, I'd thought exactly that.</p>

  <p>She was literally blazing. "Listen to me, Jack Sands. There's just one
  reason for the fool things I do&mdash;money! There isn't any Avery fortune,
  and hasn't been since my father died. I've needed money desperately these
  last two years, to keep the Connecticut place for my mother, because she'd
  die if she had to leave it. It's been our family home for two hundred years,
  since 1910, and I won't be the one to lose it!"</p>

  <p>It took a moment to adjust myself to what she was saying. "But a racing
  rocket isn't a poor man's toy," I said feebly. "And surely a girl like you
  could find&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A girl like me!" she cut in bitterly. "Oh, I know I have a good figure
  and a passable voice, and perhaps I could have found work in a television
  chorus, but I needed real money. I had my choice of two ways to get it: I
  could marry it, or I could gamble my neck against it. You see which way I
  chose. As the Golden Flash, I can get big prices for endorsing breakfast
  foods and beauty preparations. That's why I gambled in that race; my racing
  rocket was all I had left to gamble with. And it worked, only"&mdash;her
  voice broke a little&mdash;"I wish I could stop gambling. I&mdash;I hate
  it!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't only pity I felt for her then. Her confession of poverty had
  changed things; she was no longer the wealthy, unattainable being I had
  always imagined the Golden Flash to be. She was simply a forlorn and unhappy
  girl; one who needed to be loved and comforted. And then I remembered the
  evening of the eclipse, and Coretti's arms about her. So I gazed for an
  instant at the sunlight on her hair, and then turned slowly away.</p>

  <p>After a while we gathered some liver-leaves and cooked them, and I tried
  to tell Claire that we were certain to be rescued. Neither of us believed it;
  we knew very well that Gogrol would carry no living companion to Io; whoever
  helped him run the <i>Minos</i> would certainly be dead and cast into space
  before landing. And we knew that Gogrol's story, whatever it might be, would
  not be one likely to encourage a rescue party. He'd simply report us all dead
  somehow or other.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," said Claire. "I'm glad I'm with you."</p>

  <p>I thought of Coretti and said nothing. We were just sitting in glum
  silence near the fire when Gogrol came over the hills again.</p>

  <p>Claire saw him first and cried out. Despite his helmet, neither of us
  could mistake his broad, squat figure. But there was nothing we could do
  except wait, though we did draw closer to the area of wild and tumbled
  boulders about the central pool.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose&mdash;" asked Claire nervously. "Coretti may have
  died, or may be too injured to help." Pain twisted her features. "Yes, or
  &mdash;Oh, I know, Jack! It's that Gogrol can't plot a course. He can pilot;
  he can follow a course already laid out, but he can't plot one&mdash;and
  neither can Stefan!"</p>

  <p>Instantly I knew she must be right. Piloting a ship is just a question of
  following directions, but plotting a course involves the calculus of
  function, and that, let me tell you, takes a mathematician. I could do it,
  and Claire handled a simple route well enough&mdash;one had to in rocket
  racing&mdash;but astrogators were not common even among pilots.</p>

  <p>You see, the difficulty is that you don't just point the ship at your
  destination, because that destination is moving; you head for where the
  planet will be when you arrive. And in this case, assuming Gogrol meant to
  make for Io, a journey from Europa to that world meant speeding in the
  direction of the colossal mass of Jupiter, and if a rocket once passed the
  critical velocity in that direction&mdash;good night!</p>

  <p>A hundred feet away Gogrol halted. "Listen, you two," he yelled, "I'm
  offering Miss Avery the chance to join the crew of the <i>Minos</i>."</p>

  <p>"You're the crew," I retorted. "She's not taking your offer."</p>

  <p>Without warning he leveled his revolver and fired, and a shock numbed my
  left leg. I fell within the shelter of a boulder, thrusting Claire before me,
  while Gogrol's bellow followed the crash of his shot: "I'll shut your mouth
  for you!"</p>

  <p>There began the weirdest game of hide and seek I've ever played, with
  Claire and me crawling among the tumbled boulders, scarcely daring to
  breathe. Gogrol had all the advantage, and he used it. I couldn't stand
  upright, and my legs began to hurt so excruciatingly that I was afraid each
  minute of an involuntary groan forcing its way through my lips. Claire
  suffered with me; her eyes were agonized blue pools of torment, but she dared
  not even whisper to me.</p>

  <p>Gogrol took to leaping atop the boulders. He glimpsed me, and a second
  bullet struck that same burning leg. He was deliberately hunting me down, and
  I saw it was the end.</p>

  <p>We had a momentary shelter. Claire whispered to me, "I'm going to him.
  He'll kill you otherwise, and take me anyway."</p>

  <p>"No!" I croaked. "No!"</p>

  <p>Gogrol heard, and was coming. Claire said hastily. "He's&mdash;bestial. At
  least I can plot a course that will&mdash;kill us!" Then she called, "Gogrol!
  I'll surrender."</p>

  <p>I snatched at her ankle&mdash;too late. I went crawling after her as she
  strode into the open, but her steps were too rapid. I heard her say, "I give
  up, if you won't&mdash;shoot him again."</p>

  <p>Gogrol mumbled, and then Claire's voice again, "Yes, I'll plot your
  course, but how can I cross the peaks?"</p>

  <p>"Walk," he said, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I can't breathe up there."</p>

  <p>"Walk as far as you can. You won't die while I take you the rest of the
  way."</p>

  <p>There was no reply. When I finally crept into the open, they were a
  hundred feet up the slope.</p>

  <p>Helpless, raging, pain-maddened, I seized a stone and flung it. It struck
  Gogrol in the back, but it struck with no more force than if I'd tossed it a
  dozen feet on Earth. He spun in fury, thrust the screaming Claire aside, and
  sent another bullet at me. Missed me, I thought, though I wasn't sure, for
  pain had numbed me. I couldn't be sure of anything.</p>

  <p>Claire saw that I still retained some semblance of consciousness.
  "Goodbye!" she called, and added something that I could not hear because of
  the red waves of pain, but I knew Gogrol laughed at it. Thereafter, for what
  seemed like a long time, I knew only that I was crawling doggedly through an
  inferno of torture.</p>

  <p>When the red mist lifted, I was only at the base of the rise. Far above I
  could see the figures of Claire and Gogrol, and I perceived that though he
  strode with easy steps, protected by his helmet, the girl was already
  staggering from breathlessness. While I watched, she stumbled, and then began
  to struggle frantically and spasmodically to jerk away from him. It wasn't
  that she meant to break her promise, but merely that the agonies of
  suffocation drove her to attempt any means of regaining breathable air.</p>

  <p>But the struggle was brief. It was less than a minute before she fainted,
  passed out from air starvation, and Gogrol slung her carelessly under one arm
  &mdash;as I said, she weighed about twelve pounds on Europa&mdash;and pressed
  on. At the very crest he paused and looked back, and in that thin, clear air
  I could see every detail with telescopic distinctness, even to the shadow he
  cast across Claire's drooping golden head.</p>

  <p>He raised the revolver to his temple, waved it at me with a derisive
  gesture, and then flung it far down the mountainside toward me. His meaning
  was unmistakable; he was advising me to commit suicide. When I reached the
  revolver, there was a single unused catridge in the clip; I looked up,
  tempted to try it on Gogrol himself, but he was gone across the ridge.</p>

  <p>Now I knew all hope was gone. Perhaps I was dying from that last bullet
  anyway, but whether I were or not, Claire was lost, and all that remained for
  me was the madness of solitude, forever imprisoned by empty space in this
  valley. That or&mdash;suicide.</p>

  <p>I don't know how many times I thought of that single cartridge, but I know
  the thought grew very tempting after a few more hours of pain. By that time,
  for all I knew, the <i>Minos</i> might have taken off on its dash to death,
  for the roar of its blast could not carry over the airless heights, and it
  would be so high and small by the time I could see it above the hills that I
  might have missed it.</p>

  <p>If only I could cross those hills! I began to realize that more important
  than my own life was Claire's safety, even if it meant saving her for
  Coretti. But I couldn't save her; I couldn't even get to her unless I could
  walk along the hills like a bladder bird.</p>

  <p>Like a bladder bird! I was sure that it was only the delirium of fever
  that suggested that wild thought. Would it work? I answered myself that
  whether it worked or failed it was better than dying here without ever
  trying.</p>

  <p>I stalked that bladder bird like a cat. Time after time I spent long
  minutes creeping toward a copse of song-bushes only to have the creature sail
  blithely over my head and across the valley. But at last I saw the thing
  crouched for flight above me; I dared not delay longer lest my wounds weaken
  me too much for the trial of my plan, and I fired. There went my single
  cartridge.</p>

  <p>The bladder bird dropped! But that was only the beginning of my task.
  Carefully&mdash;so very carefully&mdash;I removed the creature's bladder,
  leaving the vent tube intact. Then, through the opening that connects to the
  bird's single lung, I slipped my head, letting the bloody rim contract about
  my throat.</p>

  <p>I knew that wouldn't be air-tight, so I bound it with strips torn from my
  clothing, so closely that it all but choked me. Then I took the slimy vent
  tube in my mouth and began an endless routine. Breathe in through the vent
  tube, pinch it shut, breathe out into the bladder&mdash;over and over and
  over. But gradually the bladder expanded with filthy, vitiated, stinking, and
  once-breathed air.</p>

  <p>I had it half filled when I saw that I was going to have to start if I
  were to have a chance of living long enough for a test. Breathing through the
  vent tube as long as there was air enough, peering dully through the
  semitransparent walls of the bladder, I started crawling up the hill.</p>

  <p>I won't describe that incredible journey. On Earth it would have been
  utterly impossible; here, since I weighed but eighteen pounds, it was barely
  within the bounds of possibility. As I ascended, the bladder swelled against
  the reduced pressure; by the time I had to start breathing the fearful stuff,
  I could feel it escaping and bubbling through the blood around my neck.</p>

  <p>Somehow I made the crest, almost directly above the <i>Minos</i>. It was
  still there, anyway. Gogrol hadn't come this way, and now I saw why. There
  was a sheer drop here of four hundred feet. Well, that only equaled fifty on
  Earth, but even fifty&mdash;But I had to try it, because I was dying here on
  the peaks. I jumped.</p>

  <p>I landed with a wrench of pain on my wounded leg, but much more lightly
  than I had feared. Of course! Jumping down into denser air, the great bladder
  had acted like a parachute, and, after all, my weight here was but eighteen
  pounds. I crawled onward, in agony for the moment when I could cast off the
  stinking, choking bladder.</p>

  <p>That moment came. I had crossed the peaks, and before me lay the
  <i>Minos</i>. I crawled on, around to the side where the air lock was. It was
  open, and a voice bellowed out of it. Gogrol!</p>

  <p>"You'll trick me, eh!" he screeched. "You'll lay a course that will crash
  us! We'll see! We'll see!" There came the unmistakable sound of a blow, and a
  faint whimper of pain.</p>

  <p>Somewhere I found the strength to stand up. Brandishing the empty
  automatic, I swayed into the air lock, sliding along the walls to the control
  room.</p>

  <p>There was something about the figure that bent in the dusk above a sobbing
  girl that aroused a flash of recognition. Seeing him thus in a shadowed
  control room with the sun shields up&mdash;I knew what I should have known
  weeks ago. Gogrol was&mdash;Kratska!</p>

  <p>"Kratska!" I croaked, and he whirled. Both he and Claire were frozen into
  utter rigidity by surprise and disbelief. I really think they were both
  convinced that I was a ghost.</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how&mdash;" squeaked Gogrol, or rather Kratska.</p>

  <p>"I walked across. I'd walk across hell to find you, Kratska." I brandished
  the gun. "Get out and get away quick, if you expect to escape the blast.
  We're leaving you here until police from Io can pick you up&mdash;on that
  <i>Hera</i> matter among others." I spoke to the dazed Claire. "Close the air
  lock after him. We're taking off."</p>

  <p>"Jack!" she cried, comprehending at last. "But Stefan's wired to a tree
  out there. The blast will incinerate him!"</p>

  <p>"Then loose him, and for Heaven's sake, quickly!"</p>

  <p>But no sooner had she vanished than Kratska took his chance. He saw how
  weak I was, and he gambled on the one shot he thought remained in the
  magazine of my weapon. He rushed me.</p>

  <p>I think he was mad. He was screaming curses. "Damn you!" he screeched.
  "You can't beat me! I made you the goat on the <i>Hera</i>, and I can do it
  here."</p>

  <p>And I knew he could, too, if he could overcome me before Claire released
  Coretti. She couldn't handle him, and we'd all be at his mercy. So I fought
  with all the life I had left, and felt it draining out of me like acid out of
  burette. And after a while it was all drained, and darkness filled up the
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>I heard curious sounds. Some one was saying, "No, I'll take off first and
  lay out the course after we reach escape velocity. Saves time. We've got to
  get him to Io." And a little later, "Oh, Lord, Stefan! If I roll her now
  &mdash;Why am I such a rotten pilot?" And then there was the roar of the
  blast for hours upon hours.</p>

  <p>A long time later I realized that I was lying on the chart room table, and
  Coretti was looking down at me. He said, "How you feel, Jack!" It was the
  first time he had used my name.</p>

  <p>"O.K.," I said, and then memory came back. "Gogrol! He's Kratska!"</p>

  <p>"He was," said Coretti. "He's dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" There went any chance of squaring that <i>Hera</i> mess.</p>

  <p>"Yep. You killed him, smashed in his head with that automatic before we
  could pull you off. But he had it coming."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, maybe, but the <i>Hera</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the <i>Hera</i>, Jack. Both Claire and I beard Kratska admit
  his responsibility. We'll clear you of that, all right." He paused. "And it
  might make you feel a little more chipper it I tell you that we got the
  formula, too, and that there's a reward for it that will leave us sitting in
  the clover field, even split three ways. That is, Claire keeps insisting on
  three ways; I know I don't deserve a split."</p>

  <p>"Three ways is right," I said. "It'll give you and Claire a good send-
  off."</p>

  <p>"Me and Claire?'</p>

  <p>"Listen, Coretti. I didn't mean to, but I saw you the evening of the
  eclipse. Claire didn't look as if she was fighting you."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "So you saw that," he said slowly. "Then you listen. A fellow
  who's asking a girl to marry him is apt to hold the girl a little close. And
  if she's got any heart, she doesn't push him away. She just says no as gently
  as possible."</p>

  <p>"She says no?"</p>

  <p>"She did that time. I'd bet different with you."</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she&mdash;" Something about the familiar sound of the blast
  caught my attention. "We're landing!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, on Io. We've been landing for two hours."</p>

  <p>"Who took off?"</p>

  <p>"Claire did. She took off and kept going. She's been sitting there fifty
  hours. She thinks you need a doctor, and I don't know a damn thing about
  running a rocket. She's taken it clear from Europa."</p>

  <p>I sat up. "Take me in there," I said grimly. "Don't argue. Take me in
  there!"</p>

  <p>Claire barely raised her eyes when Coretti slid me down beside her. She
  was all but exhausted, sitting there all those weary hours, and now up
  against her old terror of landing.</p>

  <p>"Jack, Jack!" she whispered as if to herself. "I'm glad you're
  better."</p>

  <p>"Honey," I said&mdash;her hair did look like honey&mdash;"I'm taking half
  the U-bar. Just let me guide you."</p>

  <p>We came down without a roll, and landed like a canary feather. But I
  hadn't a thing to do with it; I was so weak I couldn't even move the U-bar,
  but she didn't know that. Confidence was all she needed; she had the makings
  of a damn good pilot. Yeah; I've proved that. She is a damn good pilot. But
  all the same, she went to sleep in the middle of our first kiss.</p>
