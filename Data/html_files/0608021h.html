<h2><a id="tartary1" name="tartary1">I.&mdash;KEY TO THE
TREASURE</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">IT WAS NOT mere impulsiveness that sent
Kirby O'Donnell into the welter of writhing limbs and whickering
blades that loomed so suddenly in the semidarkness ahead of him. In
that dark alley of Forbidden Shahrazar it was no light act to
plunge headlong into a nameless brawl; and O'Donnell, for all his
Irish love of a fight, was not disposed thoughtlessly to jeopardize
his secret mission.</p>

<p>But the glimpse of a scarred, bearded face swept from his mind
all thought and emotion save a crimson wave of fury. He acted
instinctively.</p>

<p>Full into the midst of the flailing group, half-seen by the
light of a distant cresset, O'Donnell leaped, <i>kindhjal</i> in
hand. He was dimly aware that one man was fighting three or four
others, but all his attention was fixed on a single tall gaunt
form, dim in the shadows. His long, narrow, curved blade licked
venomously at this figure, ploughing through cloth, bringing a yelp
as the edge sliced skin. Something crashed down on O'Donnell's
head, gun butt or bludgeon, and he reeled, and closed with someone
he could not see.</p>

<p>His groping hand locked on a chain that encircled a bull neck,
and with a straining gasp he ripped upward and felt his keen
<i>kindhjal</i> slice through cloth, skin and belly muscles. An
agonized groan burst from his victim's lips, and blood gushed
sickeningly over O'Donnell's hand.</p>

<p>Through a blur of clearing sight, the American saw a broad
bearded face falling away from him&mdash;not the face he had seen
before. The next instant he had leaped clear of the dying man, and
was slashing at the shadowy forms about him. An instant of
flickering steel, and then the figures were running fleetly up the
alley. O'Donnell, springing in pursuit, his hot blood lashed to
murderous fury, tripped over a writhing form and fell headlong. He
rose, cursing, and was aware of a man near him, panting heavily. A
tall man, with a long curved blade in hand. Three forms lay in the
mud of the alley.</p>

<p>"Come, my friend, whoever you are!" the tall man panted in
<i>Turki</i>. "They have fled, but they will return with others.
Let us go!"</p>

<p>O'Donnell made no reply. Temporarily accepting the alliance into
which chance had cast him, he followed the tall stranger who ran
down the winding alley with the sure foot of familiarity. Silence
held them until they emerged from a low dark arch, where a tangle
of alleys debouched upon a broad square, vaguely lighted by small
fires about which groups of turbaned men squabbled and brewed tea.
A reek of unwashed bodies mingled with the odors of horses and
camels. None noticed the two men standing in the shadow made by the
angle of the mud wall.</p>

<p>O'Donnell looked at the stranger, seeing a tall slim man with
thin dark features. Under his <i>khalat</i> which was draggled and
darkly splashed, showed the silver-heeled boots of a horseman. His
turban was awry, and though he had sheathed his scimitar, blood
clotted the hilt and the scabbard mouth.</p>

<p>The keen black eyes took in every detail of the American's
appearance, but O'Donnell did not flinch. His disguise had stood
the test too many times for him to doubt its effectiveness.</p>

<p>The American was somewhat above medium height, leanly built, but
with broad shoulders and corded sinews which gave him a strength
out of all proportion to his weight. He was a hard-woven mass of
wiry muscles and steel string nerves, combining the wolf-trap
coordination of a natural fighter with a berserk fury resulting
from an overflowing nervous energy. The <i>kindhjal</i> in his
girdle and the scimitar at his hip were as much a part of him as
his hands.</p>

<p>He wore the Kurdish boots, vest and girdled <i>khalat</i> like a
man born to them. His keen features, burned to bronze by desert
suns, were almost as dark as those of his companion.</p>

<p>"Tell me thy name," requested the other. "I owe my life to
thee."</p>

<p>"I am Ali el Ghazi, a Kurd," answered O'Donnell.</p>

<p>No hint of suspicion shadowed the other's countenance. Under the
coiffed Arab <i>kafiyeh</i> O'Donnell's eyes blazed lambent blue,
but blue eyes were not at all unknown among the warriors of the
Iranian highlands.</p>

<p>The Turk lightly and swiftly touched the hawk-headed pommel of
O'Donnell's scimitar.</p>

<p>"I will not forget," he promised. "I will know thee wherever we
meet again. Now it were best we separated and went far from this
spot, for men with knives will be seeking me&mdash;and thou too,
for aiding me." And like a shadow he glided among the camels and
bales and was gone.</p>

<p>O'Donnell stood silently for an instant, one ear cocked back
toward the alley, the other absently taking in the sounds of the
night. Somewhere a thin wailing voice sang to a twanging native
lute. Somewhere else a feline-like burst of profanity marked the
progress of a quarrel. O'Donnell breathed deep with contentment,
despite the grim Hooded Figure that stalked forever at his
shoulder, and the recent rage that still seethed in his veins. This
was the real heart of the East, the East which had long ago stolen
his heart and led him to wander afar from his own people.</p>

<p>He realized that he still gripped something in his left hand,
and he lifted it to the flickering light of a nearby fire. It was a
length of gold chain, one of its massy links twisted and broken.
From it depended a curious plaque of beaten gold, somewhat larger
than a silver dollar, but oval rather than round. There was no
ornament, only a boldly carven inscription which O'Donnell, with
all his Eastern lore, could not decipher.</p>

<p>He knew that he had torn the chain from the neck of the man he
had killed in that black alley, but he had no idea as to its
meaning. Slipping it into his broad girdle, he strode across the
square, walking with the swagger of a nomadic horseman that was so
natural to him.</p>

<p>Leaving the square he strode down a narrow street, the
overhanging balconies of which almost touched one another. It was
not late. Merchants in flowing silk robes sat cross-legged before
their booths, extolling the quality of their goods&mdash;Mosul
silk, matchlocks from Herat, edged weapons from India, and seed
pearls from Baluchistan, hawk-like Afghans and weapon-girdled
Uzbeks jostled him. Lights streamed through silk-covered windows
overhead, and the light silvery laughter of women rose above the
noise of barter and dispute.</p>

<p>There was a tingle in the realization that he, Kirby O'Donnell,
was the first Westerner ever to set foot in forbidden Shahrazar,
tucked away in a nameless valley not many days' journey from where
the Afghan mountains swept down into the steppes of the Turkomans.
As a wandering Kurd, traveling with a caravan from Kabul he had
come, staking his life against the golden lure of a treasure beyond
men's dreams.</p>

<p>In the bazaars and <i>serais</i> he had heard a tale: To Shaibar
Khan, the Uzbek chief who had made himself master of Shahrazar, the
city had given up its ancient secret. The Uzbek had found the
treasure hidden there so long ago by Muhammad Shah, king of
Khuwarezm, the Land of the Throne of Gold, when his empire fell
before the Mongols.</p>

<p>O'Donnell was in Shahrazar to steal that treasure; and he did
not change his plans because of the bearded face he had recognized
in the alley&mdash; the face of an old and hated enemy. Yar Akbar
the Afridi, traitor and murderer.</p>

<p>O'Donnell turned from the street and entered a narrow arched
gate which stood open as if in invitation. A narrow stair went up
from a small court to a balcony. This he mounted, guided by the
tinkle of a guitar and a plaintive voice singing in
<i>Pushtu</i>.</p>

<p>He entered a room whose latticed casement overhung the street,
and the singer ceased her song to greet him and make half-mocking
salaam with a lithe flexing of supple limbs. He replied, and
deposited himself on a divan. The furnishings of the room were not
elaborate, but they were costly. The garments of the woman who
watched interestedly were of silk, her satin vest sewn with seed
pearls. Her dark eyes, over the filmy <i>yasmaq</i>, were lustrous
and expressive, the eyes of a Persian.</p>

<p>"Would my lord have food&mdash;and wine?" she inquired; and
O'Donnell signified assent with the lordly gesture of a Kurdish
swashbuckler who is careful not to seem too courteous to any woman,
however famed in intrigue she may be. He had come there not for
food and drink, but because he had heard in the bazaars that news
of many kinds blew on the winds through the house of Ayisha, where
men from far and near came to drink her wine and listen to her
songs.</p>

<p>She served him, and, sinking down on cushions near him, watched
him eat and drink. O'Donnell's appetite was not feigned. Many lean
days had taught him to eat when and where he could. Ayisha seemed
to him more like a curious child than an intriguing woman, evincing
so much interest over a wandering Kurd, but he knew that she was
weighing him carefully behind her guileless stare, as she weighed
all men who came into her house.</p>

<p>In that hotbed of plot and ambitions, the wandering stranger
today might be the Amir of Afghanistan or the Shah of Persia
tomorrow&mdash;or the morrow might see his headless body dangling
as a feast for the birds.</p>

<p>"You have a good sword," said she. He involuntarily touched the
hilt. It was an Arab blade, long, lean, curved like the crescent
moon, with a brass hawk's head for a pommel.</p>

<p>"It has cut many a Turkoman out of the saddle," he boasted, with
his mouth full, carrying out his character. Yet it was no empty
boast.</p>

<p><i>"Hai!"</i> She believed him and was impressed. She rested her
chin on her small fists and gazed up at him, as if his dark,
hawk-like face had caught her fancy.</p>

<p>"The Khan needs swords like yours," she said.</p>

<p>"The Khan has many swords," he retorted, gulping wine
loudly.</p>

<p>"No more than he will need if Orkhan Bahadur comes against him,"
she prophesied.</p>

<p>"I have heard of this Orkhan," he replied. And so he had; who in
Central Asia had not heard of the daring and valorous Turkoman
chief who defied the power of Moscow and had cut to pieces a
Russian expedition sent to subdue him? "In the bazaars they say the
Khan fears him."</p>

<p>That was a blind venture. Men did not speak of Shaibar Khan's
fears openly.</p>

<p>Ayisha laughed. "Who does the Khan fear? Once the Amir sent
troops to take Shahrazar, and those who lived were glad to flee!
Yet if any man lives who could storm the city, Orkhan Bahadur is
that man. Only tonight the Uzbeks were hunting his spies through
the alleys."</p>

<p>O'Donnell remembered the Turkish accent of the stranger he had
unwittingly aided. It was quite possible that the man was a
Turkoman spy.</p>

<p>As he pondered this, Ayisha's sharp eyes discovered the broken
end of the gold chain dangling from his girdle, and with a gurgle
of delight she snatched it forth before he could stop her. Then
with a squeal she dropped it as if it were hot, and prostrated
herself in wriggling abasement among the cushions.</p>

<p>He scowled and picked up the trinket.</p>

<p>"Woman, what are you about?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, lord!" She clasped her hands, but her fear seemed
more feigned than real; her eyes sparkled. "I did not know it was
<i>the</i> token. <i>Aie</i>, you have been making game of
me&mdash;asking me things none could know better than yourself.
Which of the Twelve are you?"</p>

<p>"You babble as bees hum!" He scowled, dangling the pendant
before her eyes. "You speak as one of knowledge, when, by Allah,
you know not the meaning of this thing."</p>

<p>"Nay, but I do!" she protested. "I have seen such emblems before
on the breasts of the <i>emirs</i> of the Inner Chamber. I know
that it is a <i>talsmin</i> greater than the seal of the Amir, and
the wearer comes and goes at will in or out of the Shining
Palace."</p>

<p>"But why, wench, why?" he growled impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nay, I will whisper what you know so well," she answered,
kneeling beside him. Her breath came soft as the sighing of the
distant night wind. "It is the symbol of a Guardian of the
Treasure!"</p>

<p>She fell away from him laughing. "Have I not spoken truly?"</p>

<p>He did not at once reply. His brain was dizzy, the blood
pounding madly in his veins.</p>

<p>"Say nothing of this," he said at last, rising. "Your life upon
it." And casting her a handful of coins at random, he hurried down
the stair and into the street. He realized that his departure was
too abrupt, but he was too dizzy, with the realization of what had
fallen into his hands, for an entirely placid course of action.</p>

<p>The treasure! In his hand he held what well might be the key to
it&mdash;at least a key into the palace, to gain entrance into
which he had racked his brain in vain ever since coming to
Shahrazar. His visit to Ayisha had borne fruit beyond his wildest
dreams.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="tartary2" name="tartary2">II.&mdash;THE UNHOLY PLAN</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">DOUBTLESS in Muhammad Shah's day the
Shining Palace deserved its name; even now it preserved some of its
former splendor. It was separated from the rest of the city by a
thick wall, and at the great gate there always stood a guard of
Uzbeks with Lee-Enfield rifles, and girdles bristling with knives
and pistols.</p>

<p>Shaibar Khan had an almost superstitious terror of accidental
gunfire, and would allow only edged weapons to be brought into the
palace. But his warriors were armed with the best rifles that could
be smuggled into the hills.</p>

<p>There was a limit to O'Donnell's audacity. There might be men on
guard at the main gates who knew by sight all the <i>emirs</i> of
the symbol. He made his way to a small side gate, through a
loophole in which, at his imperious call, there peered a black man
with the wizened features of a mute. O'Donnell had fastened the
broken links together and the chain now looped his corded neck. He
indicated the plaque which rested on the silk of his <i>khalat</i>;
and with a deep salaam, the black man opened the gate.</p>

<p>O'Donnell drew a deep breath. He was in the heart of the lion's
lair now, and he dared not hesitate or pause to deliberate. He
found himself in a garden which gave onto an open court surrounded
by arches supported on marble pillars. He crossed the court,
meeting no one. On the opposite side a grim-looking Uzbek, leaning
on a spear, scanned him narrowly but said nothing. O'Donnell's skin
crawled as he strode past the somber warrior, but the man merely
stared curiously at the gold oval gleaming against the Kurdish
vest.</p>

<p>O'Donnell found himself in a corridor whose walls were decorated
by a gold frieze, and he went boldly on, seeing only soft-footed
slaves who took no heed of him. As he passed into another corridor,
broader and hung with velvet tapestries, his heart leaped into his
mouth.</p>

<p>It was a tall slender man in long fur-trimmed robes and a silk
turban who glided from an arched doorway and halted him. The man
had the pale oval face of a Persian, with a black pointed beard,
and dark shadowed eyes. As with the others his gaze sought first
the <i>talsmin</i> on O'Donnell's breast&mdash; the token,
undoubtedly, of a servitor beyond suspicion.</p>

<p>"Come with me!" snapped the Persian. "I have work for you." And
vouchsafing no further enlightenment, he stalked down the corridor
as if expecting O'Donnell to follow without question; which,
indeed, the American did, believing that such would have been the
action of the genuine Guardian of the Treasure. He knew this
Persian was Ahmed Pasha, Shaibar Khan's vizir; he had seen him
riding along the streets with the royal house troops.</p>

<p>The Persian led the way into a small domed chamber, without
windows, the walls hung with thick tapestries. A small bronze lamp
lighted it dimly. Ahmed Pasha drew aside the hangings, directly
behind a heap of cushions, and disclosed a hidden alcove.</p>

<p>"Stand there with drawn sword," he directed. Then he hesitated.
"Can you speak or understand any Frankish tongue?" he demanded. The
false Kurd shook his head.</p>

<p>"Good!" snapped Ahmed Pasha. "You are here to watch, not to
listen. Our lord does not trust the man he is to meet
here&mdash;alone. You are stationed behind the spot where this man
will sit. Watch him like a hawk. If he makes a move against the
Khan, cleave his skull. If harm comes to our prince, you shall be
flayed alive." He paused, glared an instant, then snarled:</p>

<p>"And hide that emblem, fool! Shall the whole world know you are
an <i>emir</i> of the Treasure?"</p>

<p>"Hearkening and obedience, <i>ya khawand</i>," mumbled
O'Donnell, thrusting the symbol inside his garments. Ahmed jerked
the tapestries together, and left the chamber. O'Donnell glanced
through a tiny opening, waiting for the soft pad of the vizir's
steps to fade away before he should glide out and take up again his
hunt for the treasure.</p>

<p>But before he could move, there was a low mutter of voices, and
two men entered the chamber from opposite sides. One bowed low and
did not venture to seat himself until the other had deposited his
fat body on the cushions, and indicated permission.</p>

<p>O'Donnell knew that he looked on Shaibar Khan, once the terror
of the Kirghiz steppes, and now lord of Shahrazar. The Uzbek had
the broad powerful build of his race, but his thick limbs were soft
from easy living. His eyes held some of their old restless fire,
but the muscles of his face seemed flabby, and his features were
lined and purpled with debauchery. And there seemed something
else&mdash;a worried, haunted look, strange in that son of reckless
nomads. O'Donnell wondered if the possession of the treasure was
weighing on his mind.</p>

<p>The other man was slender, dark, his garments plain beside the
gorgeous ermine-trimmed <i>kaftan</i>, pearl-sewn girdle and green,
emerald-crested turban of the Khan.</p>

<p>This stranger plunged at once into conversation, low voiced but
animated and urgent. He did most of the talking, while Shaibar Khan
listened, occasionally interjecting a question, or a grunt of
gratification. The Khan's weary eyes began to blaze, and his pudgy
hands knotted as if they gripped again the hilt of the blade which
had carved his way to power.</p>

<p>And Kirby O'Donnell forgot to curse the luck which held him
prisoner while precious time drifted by. Both men spoke a tongue
the American had not heard in years&mdash;a European language. And
scanning closely the slim dark stranger, O'Donnell admitted himself
baffled. If the man were, as he suspected, a European disguised as
an Oriental, then O'Donnell knew he had met his equal in
masquerade.</p>

<p>For it was European politics he talked, European politics that
lay behind the intrigues of the East. He spoke of war and conquest,
and vast hordes rolling down the Khybar Pass into India; to
complete the overthrow, said the dark slender man, of a rule
outworn.</p>

<p>He promised power and honors to Shaibar Khan, and O'Donnell,
listening, realized that the Uzbek was but a pawn in his game, no
less than those others he mentioned. The Khan, narrow of vision,
saw only a mountain kingdom for himself, reaching down into the
plains of Persia and India, and backed by European guns&mdash;not
realizing those same guns could just as easily overwhelm him when
the time was ripe.</p>

<p>But O'Donnell, with his western wisdom, read behind the dark
stranger's words, and recognized there a plan of imperial
dimensions, and the plot of a European power to seize half of Asia.
And the first move in that game was to be the gathering of warriors
by Shaibar Khan. How? With the treasure of Khuwarezm! With it he
could buy all the swords of Central Asia.</p>

<p>So the dark man talked and the Uzbek listened like an old wolf
who harks to the trampling of the musk oxen in the snow. O'Donnell
listened, his blood freezing as the dark man casually spoke of
invasions and massacres; and as the plot progressed and became more
plain in detail, more monstrous and ruthless in conception, he
trembled with a mad urge to leap from his cover and slash and hack
both these bloody devils into pieces with the scimitar that
quivered in his nervous grasp. Only a sense of self-preservation
stayed him from this madness; and presently Shaibar Khan concluded
the audience and left the chamber, followed by the dark stranger.
O'Donnell saw this one smile furtively, like a man who has victory
in his grasp.</p>

<p>O'Donnell started to draw aside the curtain, when Ahmed Pasha
came padding into the chamber. It occurred to the American that it
would be better to let the vizir find him at his post. But before
Ahmed could speak, or draw aside the curtain, there sounded a rapid
pattering of bare feet in the corridor outside, and a man burst
into the room, wild eyed and panting. At the sight of him a red
mist wavered across O'Donnell's sight. It was Yar Akbar!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="tartary3" name="tartary3">III.&mdash;WOLF PACK</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">THE AFRIDI fell on his knees before Ahmed
Pasha. His garments were tattered; blood seeped from a broken tooth
and clotted his straggly beard.</p>

<p>"Oh, master," he panted, "the dog has escaped!"</p>

<p>"Escaped!" The vizir rose to his full height, his face convulsed
with passion. O'Donnell thought that he would strike down the
Afridi, but his arm quivered, fell by his side.</p>

<p>"Speak!" The Persian's voice was dangerous as the hiss of a
cobra.</p>

<p>"We hedged him in a dark alley," Yar Akbar babbled. "He fought
like <i>Shaitan</i>. Then others came to his aid&mdash;a whole nest
of Turkomans, we thought, but mayhap it was but one man. He too was
a devil! He slashed my side&mdash;see the blood! For hours since we
have hunted them, but found no trace. <i>He</i> is over the wall
and gone!" In his agitation Yar Akbar plucked at a chain about his
neck; from it depended an oval like that held by O'Donnell. The
American realized that Yar Akbar, too, was an <i>emir</i> of the
Treasure. The Afridi's eyes burned like a wolf's in the gloom, and
his voice sank.</p>

<p>"He who wounded me slew Othman," he whispered fearfully, "and
despoiled him of the <i>talsmin</i>!"</p>

<p>"Dog!" The vizir's blow knocked the Afridi sprawling. Ahmed
Pasha was livid. "Call the other <i>emirs</i> of the Inner Chamber,
swiftly!"</p>

<p>Yar Akbar hastened into the corridor, and Ahmed Pasha
called:</p>

<p>"Ohe! You who hide behind the hangings&mdash;come forth!" There
was no reply, and pale with sudden suspicion, Ahmed drew a curved
dagger and with a pantherish spring tore the tapestry aside. The
alcove was empty.</p>

<p>As he glared in bewilderment, Yar Akbar ushered into the chamber
as unsavory a troop of ruffians as a man might meet, even in the
hills: Uzbeks, Afghans, Ghilzais, Pathans, scarred with crime and
old in wickedness. Ahmed Pasha counted them swiftly. With Yar Akbar
there were eleven.</p>

<p>"Eleven," he muttered. "And dead Othman makes twelve. All these
men are known to you, Yar Akbar?"</p>

<p>"My head on it!" swore the Afridi. "These be all true men."</p>

<p>Ahmed clutched his beard.</p>

<p>"Then, by God, the One True God," he groaned, "that Kurd I set
to guard the Khan was a spy and a traitor." And at that moment a
shriek and a clash of steel re-echoed through the palace.</p>

<p align="center"><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>When O'Donnell heard Yar Akbar gasping out his tale to the
vizir, he knew the game was up. He did not believe that the alcove
was a blind niche in the wall; and, running swift and practiced
hands over the panels, he found and pressed a hidden catch. An
instant before Ahmed Pasha tore aside the tapestry, the American
wriggled his lean body through the opening and found himself in a
dimly lighted chamber on the other side of the wall. A black slave
dozed on his haunches, unmindful of the blade that hovered over his
ebony neck, as O'Donnell glided across the room, and through a
curtained doorway.</p>

<p>He found himself back in the corridor into which one door of the
audience chamber opened, and crouching among the curtains, he saw
Yar Akbar come up the hallway with his villainous crew. He saw,
too, that they had come up a marble stair at the end of the
hall.</p>

<p>His heart leaped. In that direction, undoubtedly, lay the
treasure&mdash;now supposedly unguarded. As soon as the
<i>emirs</i> vanished into the audience chamber where the vizir
waited, O'Donnell ran swiftly and recklessly down the corridor.</p>

<p>But even as he reached the stairs, a man sitting on them sprang
up, brandishing a <i>tulwar</i>. A black slave, evidently left
there with definite orders, for the sight of the symbol on
O'Donnell's breast did not halt him. O'Donnell took a desperate
chance, gambling his speed against the cry that rose in the thick
black throat.</p>

<p>He lost. His scimitar licked through the massive neck and the
Soudani rolled down the stairs, spurting blood. But his yell had
rung to the roof.</p>

<p>And at that yell the <i>emirs</i> of the gold came headlong out
of the audience chamber, giving tongue like a pack of wolves. They
did not need Ahmed's infuriated shriek of recognition and command.
They were men picked for celerity of action as well as courage, and
it seemed to O'Donnell that they were upon him before the Negro's
death yell had ceased to echo.</p>

<p>He met the first attacker, a hairy Pathan, with a long lunge
that sent his scimitar point through the thick throat even as the
man's broad <i>tulwar</i> went up for a stroke. Then a tall Uzbek
swung his heavy blade like a butcher's cleaver. No time to parry;
O'Donnell caught the stroke near his own hilt, and his knees bent
under the impact.</p>

<p>But the next instant the <i>kindhjal</i> in his left hand ripped
through the Uzbek's entrails, and with a powerful heave of his
whole body, O'Donnell hurled the dying man against those behind
him, bearing them back with him. Then O'Donnell wheeled and ran,
his eyes blazing defiance of the death that whickered at his
back.</p>

<p>Ahead of him another stair led up. O'Donnell reached it one long
bound ahead of his pursuers, gained the steps and wheeled, all in
one motion, slashing down at the heads of the pack that came
clamoring after him.</p>

<p>Shaibar Khan's broad pale face peered up at the melee from the
curtains of an archway, and O'Donnell was grateful to the Khan's
obsessional fear that had barred firearms from the palace.
Otherwise, he would already have been shot down like a dog. He
himself had no gun; the pistol with which he had started the
adventure had slipped from its holster somewhere on that long
journey, and lay lost among the snows of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>No matter; he had never yet met his match with cold steel. But
no blade could long have held off the ever-increasing horde that
swarmed up the stair at him.</p>

<p>He had the advantage of position, and they could not crowd past
him on the narrow stair; their very numbers hindered them. His
flesh crawled with the fear that others would come down the stair
and take him from behind, but none came. He retreated slowly,
plying his dripping blades with berserk frenzy. A steady stream of
taunts and curses flowed from his lips, but even in his fury he
spoke in the tongues of the East, and not one of his assailants
realized that the madman who opposed them was anything but a
Kurd.</p>

<p>He was bleeding from a dozen flesh cuts, when he reached the
head of the stairs which ended in an open trap. Simultaneously the
wolves below him came clambering up to drag him down. One gripped
his knees, another was hewing madly at his head. The others howled
below them, unable to get at their prey.</p>

<p>O'Donnell stooped beneath the sweep of a <i>tulwar</i> and his
scimitar split the skull of the wielder. His <i>kindhjal</i> he
drove through the breast of the man who clung to his knees, and
kicking the clinging body away from him, he reeled up through the
trap. With frantic energy, he gripped the heavy iron-bound door and
slammed it down, falling across it in semi-collapse.</p>

<p>The splintering of wood beneath him warned him and he rolled
clear just as a steel point crunched up through the door and
quivered in the starlight. He found and shot the bolt, and then lay
prostrate, panting for breath. How long the heavy wood would resist
the attacks from below he did not know.</p>

<p>He was on a flat-topped roof, the highest part of the palace.
Rising, he stumbled over to the nearest parapet, and looked down,
onto lower roofs. He saw no way to get down. He was trapped.</p>

<p>It was the darkness just before dawn. He was on a higher level
than the walls or any of the other houses in Shahrazar. He could
dimly make out the sheer of the great cliffs which flanked the
valley in which Shahrazar stood, and he saw the starlight's pale
glimmer on the slim river which trickled past the massive walls.
The valley ran southeast and northwest.</p>

<p>And suddenly the wind, whispering down from the north, brought a
burst of crackling reports. Shots? He stared northwestward, toward
where, he knew, the valley pitched upward, narrowing to a sheer
gut, and a mud-walled village dominated the pass. He saw a dull red
glow against the sky. Again came reverberations.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the streets below sounded a frantic clatter of
flying hoofs that halted before the palace gate. There was silence
then, in which O'Donnell heard the splintering blows on the trap
door, and the heavy breathing of the men who struck them. Then
suddenly they ceased as if the attackers had dropped dead; utter
silence attended a shrilling voice, indistinct through distance and
muffling walls. A wild clamor burst forth in the streets below; men
shouted, women screamed.</p>

<p>No more blows fell on the trap. Instead there were noises
below&mdash;the rattle of arms, tramp of men, and a voice that held
a note of hysteria shouting orders.</p>

<p>O'Donnell heard the clatter of galloping horses, and saw torches
moving through the streets, toward the northwestern gate. In the
darkness up the valley he saw orange jets of flame and heard the
unmistakable reports of firearms.</p>

<p>Shrugging his shoulders, he sat down in an angle of the parapet,
his scimitar across his knees. And there weary Nature asserted
itself, and in spite of the clamor below him, and the riot in his
blood, he slept.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="tartary4" name="tartary4">IV.&mdash;FURIOUS BATTLE!</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">HE DID NOT sleep long, for dawn was just
stealing whitely over the mountains when he awoke. Rifles were
cracking all around, and crouching at the parapet, he saw the
reason. Shahrazar was besieged by warriors in sheepskin coats and
fur <i>kalpaks</i>. Herds of their horses grazed just beyond rifle
fire, and the warriors themselves were firing from every rock and
tree. Numbers of them were squirming along the half-dry river bed,
among the willows, sniping at the men on the walls, who gave back
their fire.</p>

<p>The Turkomans of Orkhan Bahadur! That blaze in the darkness told
of the fate of the village that guarded the pass. Turks seldom made
night raids; but Orkhan was nothing if not original.</p>

<p>The Uzbeks manned the walls, and O'Donnell believed he could
make out the bulky shape and crested turban of Shaibar Khan among a
cluster of peacock-clad nobles. And as he gazed at the turmoil in
the streets below, the belief grew that every available Uzbek in
the city was on the walls. This was no mere raid; it was a tribal
war of extermination.</p>

<p>O'Donnell's Irish audacity rose like heady wine in his veins,
and he tore aside the splintered door and gazed down the stairs.
The bodies still lay on the steps, stiff and unseeing. No living
human met his gaze as he stole down the stairs, scimitar in hand.
He gained the broad corridor, and still he saw no one. He hurried
down the stair whereon he had slain the black slave, and reached a
broad chamber with a single tapestried door.</p>

<p>There was the sudden crash of a musket; a spurt of flame stabbed
at him. The ball whined past him and he covered the space with a
long leap, grappled a snarling, biting figure behind the tapestry
and dragged it into the open. It was Ahmed Pasha.</p>

<p>"Accursed one!" The vizir fought like a mad dog. "I guessed you
would come skulking here&mdash;Allah's curse on the <i>hashish</i>
that has made my hand unsteady&mdash;"</p>

<p>His dagger girded through O'Donnell's garments, drawing blood.
Under his silks the Persian's muscles were like taut wires.
Employing his superior weight, the American hurled himself hard
against the other, driving the vizir's head back against the stone
wall with a stunning crack. As the Persian relaxed with a groan,
O'Donnell's left hand wrenched from his grasp and lurched upward,
and the keen <i>kindhjal</i> encountered flesh and bone.</p>

<p>The American lifted the still twitching corpse and thrust it
behind the tapestry, hiding it as best he could. A bunch of keys at
the dead man's girdle caught his attention, and they were in his
hand as he approached the curtained door.</p>

<p>The heavy teakwood portal, bound in arabesqued copper, would
have resisted any onslaught short of artillery. A moment's fumbling
with the massive keys, and O'Donnell found the right one. He passed
into a narrow corridor dimly lighted by some obscure means. The
walls were of marble, the floor of mosaics. It ended at what seemed
to be a blank carven wall, until O'Donnell saw a thin crack in the
marble.</p>

<p>Through carelessness or haste, the secret door had been left
partly open. O'Donnell heard no sound, and was inclined to believe
that Ahmed Pasha had remained to guard the treasure alone. He gave
the vizir credit for wit and courage.</p>

<p>O'Donnell pulled open the door&mdash;a wide block of marble
revolving on a pivot&mdash;and halted short, a low cry escaping his
lips. He had come full upon the treasure of Khuwarezm, and the
sight stunned him!</p>

<p>The dim light must have come through hidden interstices in the
colored dome of the circular chamber in which he stood. It
illumined a shining pyramidal heap upon a dais in the center of the
floor, a platform that was a great round slab of pure jade. And on
that jade gleamed tokens of wealth beyond the dreams of madness.
The foundations of the pile consisted of blocks of virgin gold and
upon them lay, rising to a pinnacle of blazing splendor, ingots of
hammered silver, ornaments of golden enamel, wedges of jade, pearls
of incredible perfection, inlaid ivory, diamonds that dazzled the
sight, rubies like clotted blood, emeralds like drops of green
fire, pulsing sapphires&mdash;O'Donnell's senses refused to accept
the wonder of what he saw. Here, indeed, was wealth sufficient to
buy every sword in Asia. A sudden sound brought him about. Someone
was coming down the corridor outside, someone who labored for
breath and ran staggeringly. A quick glance around, and O'Donnell
slipped behind the rich gilt-worked arras which masked the walls. A
niche where, perhaps, had stood an idol in the old pagan days,
admitted his lean body, and he gazed through a slit cut in the
velvet.</p>

<p>It was Shaibar Khan who came into the chamber. The Khan's
garments were torn and splashed darkly. He stared at his treasure
with haunted eyes, and he groaned. Then he called for Ahmed
Pasha.</p>

<p>One man came, but it was not the vizir who lay dead in the outer
corridor. It was Yar Akbar, crouching like a great gray wolf, beard
bristling in his perpetual snarl.</p>

<p>"Why was the treasure left unguarded?" demanded Shaibar Khan
petulantly. "Where is Ahmed Pasha?"</p>

<p>"He sent us on the wall," answered Yar Akbar, hunching his
shoulders in servile abasement. "He said he would guard the
treasure himself."</p>

<p>"No matter!" Shaibar Khan was shaking like a man with an ague.
"We are lost. The people have risen against me and opened the gates
to that devil Orkhan Bahadur. His Turkomans are cutting down my
Uzbeks in the streets. But he shall not have the treasure. See ye
that golden bar that juts from the wall, like a sword hilt from the
scabbard? I have but to pull that, and the treasure falls into the
subterranean river which runs below this palace, to be lost forever
to the sight of men. Yar Akbar, I give you a last
command&mdash;pull that bar!"</p>

<p>Yar Akbar moaned and wrung his beard, but his eyes were red as a
wolf's, and he turned his ear continually toward the outer
door.</p>

<p>"Nay, lord, ask of me anything but that!"</p>

<p>"Then I will do it!" Shaibar Khan moved toward the bar, reached
out his hand to grasp it. With a snarl of a wild beast, Yar Akbar
sprang on his back, grunting as he struck. O'Donnell saw the point
of the Khyber knife spring out of Shaibar Khan's silk-clad breast,
as the Uzbek chief threw wide his arms, cried out chokingly, and
tumbled forward to the floor. Yar Akbar spurned the dying body with
a vicious foot.</p>

<p>"Fool!" he croaked. "I will buy my life from Orkhan Bahadur.
Aye, this treasure shall gain me much honor with him, now the other
<i>emirs</i> are dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted, crouching and glaring, the reddened knife quivering
in his hairy fist. O'Donnell had swept aside the tapestry and
stepped into the open. <i>"Y'Allah!"</i> ejaculated the Afridi.
"The dog-Kurd!"</p>

<p>"Look more closely, Yar Akbar," answered O'Donnell grimly,
throwing back his <i>kafiyeh</i> and speaking in English. "Do you
not remember the Gorge of Izz ed din and the scout trapped there by
your treachery? One man escaped, you dog of the Khyber."</p>

<p>Slowly a red flame grew in Yar Akbar's eyes.</p>

<p>"El Shirkuh!" he muttered, giving O'Donnell his Afghan
name&mdash;the Mountain Lion. Then, with a howl that rang to the
domed roof, he launched himself through the air, his three-foot
knife gleaming.</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not move his feet. A supple twist of his torso
avoided the thrust, and the furiously driven knife hissed between
left arm and body, tearing his <i>khalat</i>. At the same instant
O'Donnell's left forearm bent up and under the lunging arm that
guided the knife. Yar Akbar screamed, spat on the <i>kindhjal's</i>
narrow blade. Unable to halt his headlong rush, he caromed bodily
against O'Donnell, bearing him down.</p>

<p>They struck the floor together, and Yar Akbar, with a foot of
trenchant steel in his vitals, yet reared up, caught O'Donnell's
hair in a fierce grasp, gasped a curse, lifted his knife&mdash;and
then his wild beast vitality failed him, and with a convulsive
shudder he rolled clear and lay still in a spreading pool of
blood.</p>

<p>O'Donnell rose and stared down at the bodies upon the floor,
then at the glittering heap on the jade slab. His soul yearned to
it with the fierce yearning that had haunted him for years. Dared
he take the desperate chance of hiding it under the very noses of
the invading Turkomans? If he could, he might escape, to return
later, and bear it away. He had taken more desperate chances
before.</p>

<p>Across his mental vision flashed a picture of a slim dark
stranger who spoke a European tongue. It was lure of the treasure
which had led Orkhan Bahadur out of his steppes; and the treasure
in his hands would be as dangerous as it was in the hands of
Shaibar Khan. The Power represented by the dark stranger could deal
with the Turkoman as easily as with the Uzbek.</p>

<p>No; one Oriental adventurer with that treasure was as dangerous
to the peace of Asia as another. He dared not run the risk of
Orkhan Bahadur finding that pile of gleaming wealth&mdash;sweat
suddenly broke out on O'Donnell's body as he realized, for once in
his life, a driving power mightier than his own desire. The
helpless millions of India were in his mind as, cursing sickly, he
gripped the gold bar and heaved it!</p>

<p>With a grinding boom something gave way, the jade slab moved,
turned, tilted, and disappeared, and with it vanished, in a final
iridescent burst of dazzling splendor, the treasure of Khuwarezm.
Far below came a sullen splash, and the sound of waters roaring in
the darkness; then silence, and where a black hole had gaped there
showed a circular slab of the same substance as the rest of the
floor.</p>

<p>O'Donnell hurried from the chamber. He did not wish to be found
where the Turkomans might connect him with the vanishing of the
treasure they had battled to win. Let them think, if they would,
that Shaibar Khan and Yar Akbar had disposed of it somehow, and
slain one another. As he emerged from the palace into an outer
court, lean warriors in sheepskin <i>kaftans</i> and high fur caps
were swarming in. Cartridge belts crossed on their breasts, and
<i>yataghans</i> hung at their girdles. One of them lifted a rifle
and took deliberate aim at O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Then it was struck aside, and a voice shouted:</p>

<p>"By Allah, it is my friend Ali el Ghazi!" There strode forward a
tall man whose <i>kalpak</i> was of white lambskin, and whose
<i>kaftan</i> was trimmed with ermine. O'Donnell recognized the man
he had aided in the alley.</p>

<p>"I am Orkhan Bahadur!" exclaimed the chief with a ringing laugh.
"Put up your sword, friend; Shahrazar is mine! The heads of the
Uzbeks are heaped in the market square! When I fled from their
swords last night, they little guessed my warriors awaited my
coming in the mountains beyond the pass! Now I am prince of
Shahrazar, and thou art my cup-companion. Ask what thou wilt, yea,
even a share of the treasure of Khuwarezm&mdash;when we find
it."</p>

<p>"When you find it!" O'Donnell mentally echoed, sheathing his
scimitar with a Kurdish swagger. The American was something of a
fatalist. He had come out of this adventure with his life at least,
and the rest was in the hands of Allah.</p>

<p><i>"Alhamdolillah!"</i> said O'Donnell, joining arms with his
new cup-companion.</p>
